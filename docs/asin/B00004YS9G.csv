Bullen,"[1, 8]","I will admit that I did not read the book, but if your shocked that it's not as good as the book then you haven't watched many book adapations.(not to say I haven't been [upset] about book adaptions before however)Then you got people complaining well it's a christian movie.  Well don't look it as that way, cause even a person who Totally does not believe in the bible can find the storys in the bible to be the best storys ever written.(I am christian though)then you got christian's saying that this is so untrue etc.  well most christian ministers will tell you exactly as this movie told you.  BUT weather you believe it's a reality or not it don't matter just listen to the freaking STORY! people will go and watch a movie with the fakest storys possible and no one complains.  But yet when something TRIES to cling to a reality saying something is gonna happen, people cannot accept it as a story and they then wanna use that against certin people (christians)  I am fine with all religions and even thoughs that have no religion, But just focus on the story!  IT is NOT an action movie! it is not a Bruce Willis movie.This is not the best movie in the world! AND THANK GOD no hollywood junk here.The acting is not the best (not the worst either) BUT Sure as heck alot better then that Hollywood junk, and besides that not all great movies need good acting. I AGREE I judge acting too, but not on a movie such as this.But I sat down as a request of a friend and for the first look at the opening and such I was waiting for the point and ahhh I wasn't into it at all.The movie came along and then showed it's story!and I will be honest, it's a GREAT MOVIE! The story is really good! you also have a stephen King Feeling in the air plane scene.You have a ""good"" Feeling ending.I think this film did very well.although as I said this is not judging by the book.  NOW! if you wanna judge it by the book then your probaly best not seeing any movies made from a book again.but in anycase thoughs are your opinions and this is mine.I say watch this movie.",4,"Complain, Complain, Complain",1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,2055,"['will', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'shocked', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'many', 'book', 'adapations', 'not', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', '[', 'upset', ']', 'book', 'adaptions', 'however', 'Then', 'got', 'people', 'complaining', 'christian', 'movie', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'way', 'cause', 'even', 'person', 'who', 'Totally', 'not', 'believe', 'bible', 'can', 'find', 'storys', 'bible', 'be', 'best', 'storys', 'ever', 'written', 'am', 'christian', 'then', 'got', 'christian', 'saying', 'so', 'untrue', 'etc', 'well', 'most', 'christian', 'ministers', 'will', 'tell', 'exactly', 'movie', 'told', 'BUT', 'believe', 'reality', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'just', 'listen', 'freaking', 'STORY', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', 'fakest', 'storys', 'possible', 'one', 'yet', 'when', 'something', 'TRIES', 'cling', 'reality', 'saying', 'something', 'gon', 'happen', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'story', 'then', 'wan', 'use', 'certin', 'people', 'christians', 'am', 'fine', 'religions', 'even', 'thoughs', 'have', 'religion', 'just', 'focus', 'story', 'IT', 'NOT', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movie.This', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'world', 'THANK', 'GOD', 'hollywood', 'junk', 'here.The', 'acting', 'not', 'best', 'not', 'worst', 'BUT', 'Sure', 'heck', 'alot', 'better', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'junk', 'besides', 'not', 'great', 'movies', 'need', 'good', 'acting', 'AGREE', 'judge', 'acting', 'too', 'not', 'movie', 'such', 'this.But', 'sat', 'down', 'request', 'friend', 'first', 'look', 'opening', 'such', 'was', 'waiting', 'point', 'ahhh', 'was', ""n't"", 'all.The', 'movie', 'came', 'along', 'then', 'showed', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'GREAT', 'MOVIE', 'story', 'really', 'good', 'also', 'have', 'stephen', 'King', 'Feeling', 'air', 'plane', 'scene.You', 'have', 'good', 'Feeling', 'ending.I', 'think', 'film', 'did', 'very', 'said', 'not', 'judging', 'book', 'NOW', 'wan', 'judge', 'book', 'then', 'probaly', 'best', 'not', 'seeing', 'movies', 'made', 'book', 'again.but', 'anycase', 'thoughs', 'are', 'opinions', 'mine.I', 'say', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

So, I cannot pull apart this film as so many others before me have (who have read the book). I must say this, this is a heck of a lot better than The Omega Code(though my review on Omega Code highly favored it at the time).Why, it's less hype,minimal Hollywood special F/X and no melo-dramatics by the actors. It's in the subtlety of the f/x department for Left Behind that lets the acting and story take over this time in a film dealing with the apocalypse ! And, yes, Kirk Cameron has come quite a ways from his earlier teen acting days with ABC's Growing Pains family sit-com.While he may not be on the same acting status as Michael J.Fox in Hollywood terms, he's still commendable for his performance as a top Journalist named Buck Williams. I cannot picture Fox playing the same role with a straight face...Again, the strength in this film is it's subtlety with regards to effects. Maybe there is another spiritual message there also;Everyone expects the second coming of the Lord to be a huge spectacular laser show when,who knows, it may be a very humbling experience !Left Behind may not be overwhelmed with a roster of top Hollywood names.

560340,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00004YS9G,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[7, 7]","With the coming of the Millennium, and the Mideast situation again in the headlines, groups of Christian filmmakers have determined that the time is right to reinterpret the Biblical prophetical books (Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelations, primarily) and the stories of the Antichrist and the Rapture. The first of the current 'End of the World' films was 'The Omega Code', featuring Caspar Van Dien as a reporter involved with a charismatic leader (Michael York), who was actually the Antichrist; in 'Left Behind', the reporter is Kirk Cameron, with the leader portrayed by Gordon Currie. Both films feature 'mainstream' casts, better-than-average production values (although the FX are bargain basement, at times), and a moral that says that although even worse times are coming, God will prevail (as opposed to Hollywood's earlier Antichrist films, 'The Omen', and 'Rosemary's Baby', for example) that put Satan on top, at films' end.Where 'Left Behind' and 'The Omega Code' differ is the interpretation of when the Rapture, the Biblical-predicted ascension to Heaven of the faithful, will occur. 'The Omega Code' implies that the Antichrist will already be in place, and world events already twisting to his purpose, when the devout will disappear. 'Left Behind' follows the majority Christian opinion, that the devout will leave before the seven-year Tribulation (rule of the Antichrist) begins. In following this interpretation, the Rapture serves as a Stephen King-like opening to 'Left Behind', and provides a 'hook' that the rest of the film plays off of.One of the things that struck me as interesting about 'Left Behind' was that, as children, our church hammered into us, again and again, to accept Christ and AVOID missing the Rapture, and being left behind, at all costs! 'Left Behind' on the other hand, says, in effect, 'Hey, most of us will miss the boat, so let's face the worst of times with faith'. This may be a more honest way of seeing things, but it still feels uncomfortable!The story focuses on Brad Johnson, a career-motivated married pilot with a girlfriend on the side, who has no time to listen to his wife's Christian message (guess which one goes to Heaven in the Rapture?), and Kirk Cameron (looking VERY young!), an international reporter who witnesses first-hand the Biblical prophecies being fulfilled, yet searches for human explanations for events. Both men must reexamine their lives, and discover for themselves God's purpose.Don't expect a neat and tidy resolution to 'Left Behind'! The first of a four-film saga of the Tribulation, the story serves primarily to introduce characters, place the Antichrist as the Ruler of the Earth, and show that no human can stop or even slow down his ascent. Only faith and the love of God will help those 'left behind' to survive, elements that they lacked prior to the Rapture, but that they must embrace despite the price in suffering they will have to pay, if they want any chance of salvation!For non-Christians, this message may seem fanciful, and the story second-rate Ludlum; for those who do follow Christ, 'Left Behind' is intended as a 'Wake-Up Call', not as well-done as it might have been, but powerful, nonetheless! Is it great cinema? Not really, but it is better than the standard 'religious' film, and deserves respect for attempting to buck the 'typical' Hollywood product, with a message which may be quite timely!",3,A Fair-to-Middling  Apocolyptic Tale!,976147200,"12 7, 2000",2000,3406,"['coming', 'Millennium', 'Mideast', 'situation', 'again', 'headlines', 'groups', 'Christian', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'determined', 'time', 'right', 'reinterpret', 'Biblical', 'prophetical', 'books', 'Daniel', 'Ezekiel', 'Revelations', 'primarily', 'stories', 'Antichrist', 'Rapture', 'first', 'current', ""'End"", 'World', 'films', 'was', ""'The"", 'Omega', 'Code', 'featuring', 'Caspar', 'Van', 'Dien', 'reporter', 'involved', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'Michael', 'York', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'Antichrist', ""'Left"", 'Behind', 'reporter', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'leader', 'portrayed', 'Gordon', 'Currie', 'films', 'feature', 'casts', 'better-than-average', 'production', 'values', 'FX', 'are', 'bargain', 'basement', 'times', 'moral', 'even', 'worse', 'times', 'are', 'coming', 'God', 'will', 'prevail', 'opposed', 'Hollywood', 'earlier', 'Antichrist', 'films', 'Omen', 'Baby', 'example', 'put', 'Satan', 'top', 'films', 'end.Where', ""'Left"", 'Behind', 'Omega', 'Code', 'differ', 'interpretation', 'when', 'Rapture', 'Biblical-predicted', 'ascension', 'Heaven', 'faithful', 'will', 'occur', 'Omega', 'Code', 'implies', 'Antichrist', 'will', 'already', 'be', 'place', 'world', 'events', 'already', 'twisting', 'purpose', 'when', 'devout', 'will', 'disappear', 'Behind', 'majority', 'Christian', 'opinion', 'devout', 'will', 'leave', 'seven-year', 'Tribulation', 'rule', 'Antichrist', 'following', 'interpretation', 'Rapture', 'Stephen', 'King-like', 'opening', ""'Left"", 'Behind', ""'hook"", 'rest', 'film', 'of.One', 'things', 'struck', 'interesting', ""'Left"", 'Behind', 'was', 'children', 'church', 'hammered', 'again', 'again', 'accept', 'Christ', 'AVOID', 'missing', 'Rapture', 'being', 'left', 'behind', 'costs', 'Behind', 'other', 'hand', 'effect', 'most', 'will', 'miss', 'boat', 'let', 'face', 'worst', 'times', 'faith', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'honest', 'way', 'seeing', 'things', 'still', 'uncomfortable', 'story', 'Brad', 'Johnson', 'career-motivated', 'married', 'pilot', 'girlfriend', 'side', 'who', 'time', 'listen', 'wife', 'Christian', 'message', 'guess', 'one', 'Heaven', 'Rapture', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'looking', 'VERY', 'young', 'international', 'reporter', 'who', 'first-hand', 'Biblical', 'prophecies', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'yet', 'searches', 'human', 'explanations', 'events', 'men', 'must', 'reexamine', 'lives', 'discover', 'God', 'purpose.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'neat', 'tidy', 'resolution', ""'Left"", 'Behind', 'first', 'four-film', 'saga', 'Tribulation', 'story', 'primarily', 'introduce', 'characters', 'place', 'Antichrist', 'Ruler', 'Earth', 'show', 'human', 'can', 'stop', 'even', 'slow', 'down', 'ascent', 'Only', 'faith', 'love', 'God', 'will', 'help', ""'left"", 'behind', 'survive', 'elements', 'lacked', 'prior', 'Rapture', 'must', 'embrace', 'price', 'suffering', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'want', 'chance', 'salvation', 'non-Christians', 'message', 'may', 'seem', 'fanciful', 'story', 'second-rate', 'Ludlum', 'who', 'do', 'follow', 'Christ', ""'Left"", 'Behind', 'intended', ""'Wake-Up"", 'Call', 'not', 'as', 'well-done', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'cinema', 'Not', 'really', 'better', 'standard', ""'religious"", 'film', 'deserves', 'respect', 'attempting', 'buck', ""'typical"", 'Hollywood', 'product', 'message', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'timely']",N/A

560344,AYT4FJYVCHYLE,B00004YS9G,Brett Benner,"[5, 5]","After watching the movie and the additional passionate speeches by the actors and crew members, I hope their movie does well and it's message reaches a large and varied audience.That being said I don't know how well the film will stand up by itself for audiences not benefiting from reading the book. Obviously the task of condensing the novel down into a ninety five minute movie is daunting, but I read the book and was still confused. Storylines are thinned down to the point of anorexia, with Chloe living at home at the start of the film, and Hattie already having been hired to The U.N. People not familiar with these characters may be scratching their heads wondering how a gorgeous flight attendant could be hired to such a prestigious position. Maybe frequent flier miles? The positive though is that the screenwriters have managed for the most part to give the actors credible lines of dialogue which is more than I could say for the books.The actors physicality is all a question of opinion, but I found Brad Johnson as Rayford, and Kirk Cameron's wife, Chelsea Noble right on the money. He's a good actor that actually elevates the material, and she looks like she's in a soap opera, which for the character of Hattie isn't that far off. Kirk Cameron, of &quot;Growing Pains&quot; fame, is quite good. And speaking of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, Janaya Stephens who plays Chloe bears a creepy resemblance to his former thespian sibling Tracey Gold. The only actor I really had issues with physically was Gordon Currie as Nicolae. He has the charm and the good looks, but hardly the charisma and power necessary for the Antichrist. To me he looked more like pasty faced Michael York waiting for Liza Minnelli in the movie, &quot;Cabaret&quot;. Maybe it was the accent.On the disc/video Kirk Cameron explains the &quot;grass roots&quot; approach to why the film was released first on video. It's so the readers of the books will get out and spread the word for the folks who haven't yet read them or just have no interest in reading them. Their hope is that it will bring an entirely new group of people to the story and it's message.

Fairbanks""","[7, 9]","Made for video but given a brief, unsuccessful theatrical release, &quot;Left Behind-The Movie&quot; is based on the first of Tim LeHaye and Jerry Jenkins' popular novels fictionalizing events from the New Testament's Book of Revelation.The title refers to those earthly inhabitants who remain inhabitants of earth following the Rapture, an event many Christians believe is foretold in Bible prophecy, notably in I Thessalonians 4:16-17 which reads, &quot;For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we be with the Lord.&quot;Regardless of one's beliefs, this movie has neither the budget nor the talent to properly depict the aftermath of this event with any credibility or power. The devastation that occurs after planes without pilots and cars without drivers crash and burn is only referred to, not shown. Instead we get shots of dogs without owners, and worried looks on the faces of those (cue the ominous music) LEFT BEHIND! Imagine what Spielberg, working with a bigger budget, could do with this scenario if so inclined!Instead of Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise, we get former teen idol Kirk Cameron as our hero, a reporter named (I'm not kidding) Buck Williams. Suddenly hip to what's happening, Buck forms the Tribulation Force to oppose the Antichrist, who in LeHaye and Jenkins' tale is named (I'm still not kidding) Nicolae Carpathia. If that name isn't a dead giveaway to his villainy, Gordon Currie's suavely saturnine approach to the role should clue you in.But the film's biggest flaw is not its mediocre presentation, but its content. I don't doubt the producers' sincerity, but in their zeal to reach as wide an audience as possible they seem to have compromised their beliefs. The Lord referred to in Thessolonians (and throughout the New Testament) is Jesus Christ whom John 14:6 quotes as saying, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.&quot; But Jesus is conspicuosly left behind in this movie. Characters, including a minister, speak of, and to, &quot;God,&quot; but the deity is referred to only in the most generic way possible as if the filmmakers fear alienating any viewer who worships at a competing altar.The filmmakers may be devout Christians, but the courage of their convictions never made it to celluloid.

Let's see: FIRST, they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread. NEXT, they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget. And FINALLY, when the film hits the theaters, get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again, bus them into the multiplexes if necessary, NOT on the merits of the film itself, but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory.But THAT, of course, won't be enough. I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give &quot;Left Behind&quot; anything short of a glowing review will be deemed &quot;anti-Christian.&quot;Of course, this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn't surprise anyone. It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work. What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole &quot;Left Behind&quot; mindset. As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality, it leaves me scratching my head. It would appear that there are many, MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a &quot;Rapture&quot; is going to occur, and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR. What kind of reality, I wonder, are these people living in? Is this &quot;Rapture&quot; something they actually believe in, or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in?In a way, I almost wish that such an event would occur! What an interesting day that would be! What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion, not in the anthropomorphical sense the authors of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series have portrayed, but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production, with boiling clouds, trumpets, angels descending out of the sky, Moon turned to blood, the whole nine yards. Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true, just as the evangelists had been warning for years, and that there was something more awesome than just the cold, hard, physical reality we inhabit. Wouldn't THAT be something???Yet in the final analysis, it's that cold, hard, physical reality that I will content myself with.

It is narratively tight and faithful to the feel of the source novel.  Some of the casting did seem odd, especially comedic actor Kirk Cameron, who seems a bit uncomfortable as investigative reporter Buck Williams at times.  Brad Johnson grew into the role of Rayford Steele quite nicely, although he seemed a tad young for the part.  The offbeat surprise was Clarence Gilyard (Walker, Texas Ranger) as the left behind pastor.  He gives his big scene a personal dramatic weight that the rest of the movie needed.  If Cloud Nine and/or Namesake Productions choose to produce the next book in the series I hope and pray that Mr. Gilyard gets more screen time.The movie, like the source novel, spends less time on the spiritual/personal belief ramifications of a pre-tribulation rapture and more on the political/conspiracy story line.  A more intimate look at these earth shattering events would have been nice, but that is a pretty minor quibble.  The big one is how the movie ends just as the story seems to be getting started.  Not at all surprising considering the source material was the first book in a projected TWELVE book series, but disappointing still (it's a good sign when you don't want a story to end).

After all, according to NBC's ""Today,"" in some areas the books sell even better than ""Harry Potter"" novels! I'll take Bible-themed stories over black magic and witchcraft any day, thank you very much!Lo and behold, the first film stars one of my favorite television actors: Mr. Kirk Cameron, who played Mike Seaver on the delightful ""Growing Pains"" program. Fortunately for ""Left Behind,"" his friend Boner is nowhere to be found. Knowing that Kirk has always been very open about his Christian beliefs, I felt he was the perfect choice to headline this franchise-in-the-making. And the built-in fan-base from his hit WB show ""Kirk"" ensures that every episode in the series will be a mega-event!This gripping film depicts just what might happen if ""the Rapture"" (a Biblical moment where all faithful Christians are teleported to Heaven, leaving behind all the non-believers) came to pass in the modern world. Combining elements from ""the Langoliers,"" ""V,"" and ""the Stand,"" the story traces the paths of a number of those left behind (hence the title) and how they must face the rise of an evil villain bent on world domination. Since I disapprove of wagering, I don't often make gambling analogies--but those sound like some pretty high stakes!While most Hollywood pictures tend to be glossy, over-produced distillations of bad scripts, ""Left Behind"" goes for a more subdued, low-key feel. By spending more time on character-based arcs (like one man's crisis of faith) than budget-busting scenes of CGI chaos, ""Left Behind"" lets the viewer do the work, and fill in the blanks him or herself. Finally, a movie that allows -- no, FORCES -- me to use my own imagination!I can only hope that the trend continues, and the ""Left Behind"" film series supplants more secular entertainment on the Box-Office Charts.",5,"""Someone cracked the Seventh Seal...""",1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,1987,"['interest', 'religious-themed', 'entertainment', 'piqued', 'Hollywood', 'recent', 'offerings', 'decided', 'seek', 'out', 'film', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'Left', 'Behind', 'book', 'series', 'according', 'NBC', 'Today', 'areas', 'books', 'sell', 'even', 'better', 'Harry', 'Potter', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Bible-themed', 'stories', 'black', 'magic', 'witchcraft', 'day', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'Lo', 'behold', 'first', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'actors', 'Mr.', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'who', 'played', 'Mike', 'Seaver', 'delightful', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'program', 'Fortunately', 'Left', 'Behind', 'friend', 'Boner', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Knowing', 'Kirk', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'open', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'felt', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'headline', 'franchise-in-the-making', 'built-in', 'fan-base', 'hit', 'WB', 'show', 'Kirk', 'episode', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'mega-event', 'gripping', 'film', 'depicts', 'just', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'Rapture', 'Biblical', 'moment', 'where', 'faithful', 'Christians', 'are', 'teleported', 'Heaven', 'leaving', 'non-believers', 'came', 'pass', 'modern', 'world', 'Combining', 'elements', 'Langoliers', 'V', 'Stand', 'story', 'paths', 'number', 'left', 'behind', 'hence', 'title', 'how', 'must', 'face', 'rise', 'evil', 'villain', 'bent', 'world', 'domination', 'disapprove', 'wagering', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'make', 'gambling', 'analogies', 'sound', 'pretty', 'high', 'stakes', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'pictures', 'tend', 'be', 'glossy', 'over-produced', 'distillations', 'bad', 'scripts', 'Left', 'Behind', 'more', 'subdued', 'low-key', 'feel', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'character-based', 'arcs', 'one', 'man', 'crisis', 'faith', 'budget-busting', 'scenes', 'CGI', 'chaos', 'Left', 'Behind', 'viewer', 'do', 'work', 'fill', 'blanks', 'Finally', 'movie', 'FORCES', 'use', 'own', 'imagination', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'trend', 'Left', 'Behind', 'film', 'series', 'supplants', 'more', 'secular', 'entertainment', 'Box-Office', 'Charts']",N/A

I loved the book (the entire series actually), but felt the movie seemed to not be as impacting mostly due to the content that was left out. Of course, maybe if I had not read the book first it would have seemed better, but I just did not feel anywhere near the thrill from watching the movie that I got from the books. That being said, I think it does still give a good message and can help people understand end time prophecies by presenting one plausible scenario.

The movie adaptation on the other hand is so poor it's as un-funny as the Rapture itself.I recognize that religious communities are frustrated because they can't seem to market their messages properly in the mainstream movie industry (It has since worked with Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" and the well-done ""Prince of Egypt""), but with this film you can bet why Hollywood doesn't turn the other cheek.First let me tackle the marketing. This film boasts one of the worst marketing failures I've ever seen, and I'll tell you why. They shot ""Left Behind"" under a reasonably tight budget, then instead of just releasing it into theaters decided to put them out on DVD (and VHS) and select theaters simultaneously, so that when people BOUGHT the movie and told their friends about it, they would then be compelled to WATCH it in theaters. Needless to say, it was a dumb move and thus cements the movie-making aspect of the ""Left Behind"" franchise as a dismal failure, unless it shapes up for a ""Nicolae"" movie. It's unfortunate really, because everything about the books screams for top-notch cinematic treatment.Onto the movie. I remember praising ""Taxi Driver"" because everyone who was involved in its production, down to the lighting and cinematography, worked in flawless harmony to create a great film. The direct opposite is achieved here. The directing, the special effects, the cinematography, the continuity, and much more are all screwed up and manage to drown out considerable acting by, let's face it, washed-out actors. The character of Nicolae Carpathia, the anti-christ, is seriously underplayed. I won't delve into the unnecessary pop song that represents the film, because it is truly stupid and irritating.As I say with every bad movie, rent it first and formulate your own opinion, but I strongly recommend the books over this poor imitation of what could have been a tale of horror, excitement and the endearing power of faith and truth.",1,Read the novels instead,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2031,"['Left', 'Behind', 'series', 'books', 'are', 'superb', 'extremely', 'popular', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'other', 'hand', 'so', 'poor', 'as', 'un-funny', 'Rapture', 'itself.I', 'recognize', 'religious', 'communities', 'are', 'frustrated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'market', 'messages', 'properly', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'industry', 'worked', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'well-done', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'film', 'can', 'bet', 'why', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'turn', 'other', 'cheek.First', 'let', 'tackle', 'marketing', 'film', 'one', 'worst', 'marketing', 'failures', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'shot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'reasonably', 'tight', 'budget', 'then', 'instead', 'just', 'releasing', 'theaters', 'decided', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'select', 'theaters', 'simultaneously', 'when', 'people', 'BOUGHT', 'movie', 'told', 'friends', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'compelled', 'WATCH', 'theaters', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'dumb', 'move', 'thus', 'cements', 'movie-making', 'aspect', 'Left', 'Behind', 'franchise', 'dismal', 'failure', 'up', 'Nicolae', 'movie', 'unfortunate', 'really', 'everything', 'books', 'screams', 'top-notch', 'cinematic', 'movie', 'remember', 'praising', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'down', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'worked', 'flawless', 'harmony', 'create', 'great', 'film', 'direct', 'opposite', 'achieved', 'here', 'directing', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'continuity', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'manage', 'drown', 'out', 'considerable', 'acting', 'let', 'face', 'washed-out', 'actors', 'character', 'Nicolae', 'Carpathia', 'anti-christ', 'seriously', 'underplayed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delve', 'unnecessary', 'pop', 'song', 'film', 'truly', 'stupid', 'irritating.As', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'rent', 'first', 'formulate', 'own', 'opinion', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'books', 'poor', 'imitation', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tale', 'horror', 'excitement', 'endearing', 'power', 'faith', 'truth']",N/A

I wondered where the heck they had gotten all this information about people disappearing into thin air, and going to heaven. I flipped through my bible but couldn't find anything that matched the discription. That's when I decided to read the book. It soon all came clear to me what will soon happen, and fast. I don't want to be left behind and I think that's the point the authors and the movie makers of the book wanted to make. They don't want anyone else to be left behind either.In the movie, Captain Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) and newscaster Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron) are on a 747 bound for London when out of nowhere, passengers on the plane just disappear! It doesn't stop there though. When the plane lands, it is clear they're not the only one with this problem. All over the world, people have disappeared without a trace leaving their clothes, and belongings behind. Rayford comes home to find his wife and son gone, but his daughter (Janaya Stephens) still alive. Buck finds a few of his friends still alive, but it is obvious someone is after him as he tries to find the answer. Rayford has already found his answer, though. It all lies within one simple book, and his heart.Watching this film really opened my eyes to the truth. This is the real world. This is how it's going to be. It'll only get worse too. What the characters in the books and the movies experienced is hardly anything of what the real people will discover. The original film, A Theif in the Night, was a great source to people in the 70's, but if only more people would've paid attention to it like they did left behind, they would realize it's all around them.

I own all seven already published and am awaiting the eighth to add to my collection.  Also, I've purchased the books for other people and they love them.  But I think the movie, the screenplay behind it, was far better than the books!  I'll probably start giving copies of the movie to my friends who are interested in this subject.Some of the conversations in the book were too animated and awkward for my tastes.  Like any movie, the screenplay reads a bit differently than the book, but I think they did the &quot;story&quot; justice here in the film.  The action sequences are good, the characters are generally believable and the story doesn't lose focus.As webmaster for a Bible prophecy website, ..., and a Gospel website..., I am very familiar with pre-millennial Bible Prophecy, the Gog-Magog War of Ezekiel 38-39, the rise of the Man of Lawlessness and Christianity.  The producers treated all of these subjects fairly well without being heavy-handed, preachy or corny.  Nicolae Carpathia's ruthless actions at the United Nations was done far better than that written in the book.So I give it 4 stars.  Kirk Cameron handles his role better than our expectations of him from his 1980's sitcoms.  Kirk's wife, Chelsea Noble also does a fine job.  Brad Johnson as Rayford Steele is excellent casting.  Clarence Gilyard has come a long way since &quot;Top Gun&quot; as pastor Bruce Barnes (can you believe Gilyard is 45 years old?!?!).  Colin Fox is a favorite of mine from the &quot;Psi Factor&quot; TV series; here he's Chaim Rosenweig and easily believable as the breakthrough scientist.  Gordon Currie didn't win me over in the trailer but in the movie I came to accept his performance as the Antichrist, a true wolf in sheep's clothing.  And the Jonathan Stonagal character was decently portrayed as a globalist, capitalist who utilizes world hunger and drought to his advantage.There are a few scenes that probably warranted another take or two, but I think generally you'll enjoy the film.  If you like the book I think you'll love the movie.  It certainly ranks as one of the best, if not the best, Christian prophecy movie we've seen so far.

It only goes through about half of the story and is missing some very important details.  Moreover, the price is not something to get excited about.  I was excited about seeing Christian movies that could compete with major picture studios.  Sadly, I think we still have a long way to go.  The visual effects and acting were acceptable (though Rayford's &quot;coming to Christ&quot; scene was WAY too weepy).  The real problem was the adaptation of the screenplay.  I wish this had been developed a little further.

It was deep, intriguing, and really left the reader on the edge of their seat. Cheers to Tim LaHae and Jerry Jenkins.This movie on the other hand is a joke. Bad acting, bad scripts, bad production. Cheesy music, and it reminds me of a Lifetime special. I really wish the film followed the book better. They left out alot of important details, and summed a 500 plus page book into a 90 minute film. Talk about pushing the envelope. I think the film would have done much better without actors from the Mickey Mouse Club and stuck with better scripts. There are a few good points in the movie, such as when Rayford Steele notices his wife gone, he totally ruled that scene. Great job on that one. Nicolae looks like a choir boy, but once again, the innocent can fool people. I think the film would have been more exciting had they included a more &quot;orchestrated&quot; music piece. They stuck with Newsboys and all of those other Christian pop bands that sing pretty and try to be cool (no offense to the newsboys, but yeah). It shuts the film down completely and makes it seem like a pop teen flick.The story is good, and it is surprising how accurate some of that interpretation was by the authors. Only if they knew that Revelation would soon be unravelling in real life after they wrote that book.The film leaves alot to be desired by the viewer. The first time that I had viewed it, I had felt empty because I was expecting more. That 90 minutes went way too fast and it didn't hardly touch the magic that the written novel had.So if you're a fan of the book, it might be a good idea to skip this one if you don't want to be terribly disappointed. Once again, great book, poor movie. Most transcriptions from book to movie are poor in the first place, but alot of this gibberish is unexcuseable. I really wish the directors, producers, and actors had polished up their technique a little bit before filming this for the big screen.Keep God in your heart, time's almost up!

You've got to keep it within the bounderies of accepted dogma, yet make it interesting (and no matter what the pundits might say,'The Cross and the Switchblade' stunk mainly due to it's unbeliveability).The 'Left Behind' series of books do just that. I haven't read one yet where I didn't want to finish it. The pacing is as good as any other contemporary writers, and the lack of profanity and explicit imagery (which I previously thought were necessary to a good thriller) doesn't take away from it at all.Which is why it's so gut-wrenchingly sad to see the film adaptation come out like a bad USA cable movie. I suppose the industry will need to take some time to develop, but I really wish they wouldn't tout stuff like this as good examples of Christian filmmaking.

Virchow,"[2, 4]","&quot;In the beginning... it's a little late for that.&quot;Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron plays Buck Williams in the film adaption of the Jerry B. Jenkins/Tim LaHaye novel, Left Behind which focuses upon the oncoming events during the rapture, in which the Antichrist will be born, and unite ten kingdoms.  Brad Johnson plays Rayford Steele, a husband and father who's wife has been trying to teach him the word of God for years, but he's always ignored her.  After millions of people disappear in a blink-of-an-eye vanish, which includes his son and wife, Rayford and his daughter unite with a fallen priest and Buck to try and survive the very destructive future which they are promised to face.In a film skipping the theatrical release first in order, and going to video first, then to theaters, we realize that this film wants to get some attention.  The film seemed to be totally blown off at the box office, and little credibility was given, but as far as it has gone, it is passable.  I've never read any of the novels, because I'm not one who can just sit back and read, but I'd say that this film has a lot to show, given such a small budget, and no major actors.The film opens in the cities, and we sort of gander upon the world today.  We then head to a crop field where Buck and a foreign stand, (Buck being a reporter interviewing him) and all of a sudden planes start crashing and exploding in the air.  This is one of the signs to the earth's destruction, in which God returns to save all of his Christian followers, and leaves the rapture to those who've turned away from him.  So... the visual effects aren't top order, they are credible.There is a lot put into the acting though.  Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson are great everyday people put into the position of being caught in a world of darkness.  Because of all the children and a select few of adult people having been gone, Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia comes to the decision of radiation having killed them off.  The world is in complete chaos!  People dying and hurt everywhere.  In so happening, they are searching for a leader, someone to guide them through these times- Nicolae calls upon himself.Many readers who've followed the book of Revelation can comply with the film, but those who have no clue of the bible may be totally clueless.  yet, this is a great discipling tool for non-christians- looking for an answer that can be put into 21st Century terms.Director Vic Sarin has an imaginative appeal to create this film.  He mixes human emotion and explosive trauma to create this disaster film smuthered in cheapness and with a low balance of creativeness.  This proving- that most of the time- the novel is much better than the film.  Yet, with great characters we can relate to, and smooth charisma to show something of itself, toppled with bumpy advertising, releasing, and budget- the film does the very best it can to be an everyday motion picture.  Maybe if Touchstone or Dreamworks or 20th Century Fox had released it would have 10 times the sharpness, but with the small Cloud Ten Pictures production company, it can't deliver a whole lot.Left Behind, which I hope is followed with a string of sequels that follow the books, is thunderdome entertainment filled with good performances and story, but presented in such a street trash manner, may intrigue some audiences, but bore others.  It is a great discipling tool and good film to see, which I'm sure many will enjoy, but if only a larger production company would distribute it, it would get the praise it deserves.  Check this film out for a thought-provoking trip.Even though it isn't listed on the cover, the MPAA rated this film a PG-13, a rating it really didn't deserve- a PG I'd say.

560371,A1AMR2GU34OVJP,B00004YS9G,Matthew Newland,"[14, 17]","I caught &quot;Left Behind&quot; on tv the other night, and somehow sat through the whole thing.  I found it amusing later on, when Roman Polanski's &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, a film about the devil and satanism told from a more objective point of view, turned out to be a far better film as far as style and storytelling went (not that that was news to me: I saw &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; for the first time four years ago, bought it three years ago, and have watched it regularly since.  It just happened to be on the other night, and I was glad to have an opportunity to see it again).  In spite of the good intentions of the filmmakers, the movie still does not become watchable.Bringing to mind memories of watching Steven King's &quot;The Langoliers&quot; on tv around a decade or so ago, the crux of the movie's action is based on an event that we see occur in an airplane, which has also occured everywhere else around the world.  Lots and lots of people vanish away, leaving a selected few behind (or is it the other way around as far as selection goes?).  The filmmakers at least DID do something right by having the clothes remain when the people were taken (unlike &quot;The Langoliers&quot; ... where only metal objects like wristwatches and braces for teeth inexplicably stayed behind, but that's not enough to merit this film more than a half an extra star).  Also, there was more blood than I expected considering the wholesome demographic I know the makers were aiming for, but that isn't really a positive or negative remark so much as a semi-interesting observation.First off as far as my complaints go, this movie looks cheap.  That isn't necesarily a bad thing; I know that great things can be done with a limited budget (my own favorite &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for one), but if they aren't done properly than the thing won't have a chance to even begin doing its job: that is, entertain.  &quot;Left Behind&quot; fails at this; it looks amateurish, feels amateurish, and is therefore no fun to watch, like a bad TV movie (which is all it really is, in spite of its theatrical release).Second, the acting is atrocious.  I wasn't convinced by a single character (well, halfway by the Israeli scientist at the beginning, but I've got a fondness for those &quot;elderly wiseman&quot; types of characters), and therefore had no emotion or care invested into who they were or what happened to them.  The dialogue they were forced to say was either unconvincingly phony or sitcom-stupid, or at best somewhere in between (say, bland).Finally, there was the story, besides the characters themselves.  Okay, my religious views just don't fall in line with those presented in this movie, so I suppose it is here fair to say that the problem is to a point on my end in this regard.  But the thing is, I would have enjoyed seeing some other reactions to the supernatural occurances in the film besides those of complete unbelievers and evangelical Christians, such as Hindus, Muslims, or those of my own faith, Roman Catholics, as they attempted to deal with and understand the problem.  Also, the fact stands that the prophesies of the Bible more than likely could have more than one interpretation, or could in fact prophesy events which occured in the future for the writer but in the past for us (The Book of Daniel predicting the coming of Alexander the Great, for example, or Revelation's Antichrist being none other than Nero Caesar).  The writers limited their possibilities, and the narrow scope of the movie's story really works against it.I will finish up by saying that &quot;Left Behind&quot; was a real waste of time for me, and I honestly wish I had now done something else with my free evening.

Fundies might praise this one to high heaven, but the only time I praised was when the final credits rolled.Besides, what is it with these evangelical action flicks...why do they always pick the lamest lead actor available? In &quot;Omega Code,&quot; it was Casper Van Dien, whose only starring role was in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (classic line: &quot;This planet crawls!&quot;). Now it's Kirk Cameron from &quot;Growing Pains&quot;...couldn't they have gotten Alan Thicke to play the antichrist?On a serious note...I certainly respect Christian theology, though I disagree with it. But it's hard to maintain that respect when their theology is being crammed down your throat sideways, as it is in this film.Moreover, other films about the same type of Satan/antichrist/apocalypse subject matter (&quot;The Exorcist,&quot; &quot;Rosemary's Baby,&quot; &quot;The Omen&quot;) were entertaining without being preachy. I suspect that the goal of the producers of this film (i.e., getting &quot;the word&quot; out) could have been achieved without preaching, and that's too bad, because this could have been a much better film - and reached a far broader audience with its message - without the Jack Van Impe tone.PS...regardless of whether you like this film or not, it's being broadcast on PAX TV for free.

There are a few flaws of course, aside from the fact that yes, it does appear more as a TV movie. I haven't read the books, so I can't compare them to the movie, but being a movie buff, I thought it was great! The acting was mostly pretty bad, like in the Omega Code, but also like in the Omega Code it was thankfully ballanced with some good acting from Kirk Cameron, the antichrist character Nicolae and the Captain's (very cute) teen daughter Chloe. I must say again the antichrist character was excellent! He's going to get creepier and creepier in the sequels, and I can't wait till they get into the Mark! Looking forward to the sequels to the Omega Code too! Anyway, as for other flaws, well, it gets a bit preachy at times, which really needs to be softened up in order to reach non Christians with the message of the film. You can't be too, too obvious, though I know it's difficult in this sort of movie. The Captain's transformation into a Christian was so sudden and strong. It might have been more believable from the Preacher or someone else. The biggest flaw to my mind was the music, it just didn't seem to fit the scenes at times. I'm speaking mostly about the Ballads, not the score. There were scenes with Christian rock thrown in where it didn't seem to fit. Other than that though, it's an excellent movie. Seeing the clothes lying there after the people disappeared seemed a bit of a corny touch at first, but I suppose it does make sense. Maybe they could have been smoking or something. Give them some radiation burn like the shroud of turin. Anyway, it was a great movie, probably better than Omega Code, though that one was good too. I'm looking forward to the sequels a lot now that the groundwork is set. It was really getting interesting toward the end and left you wanting more of Carpathia!

Just two examples: at the beginning of the film, a massive air fleet, originating in Iraq, is shown crossing the Israeli border, then getting mysteriously destroyed without any intervention from the Israelis. Was Iraq being set up as a suitable target for the actual US invasion of Iraq about three years after the film was made? Did the horrific events of September 11 a year later serve to further demonize Iraq? Second: in the film, the United Nations is shown as falling under the control of the Antichrist, who plans to introduce one world government and a single world currency. Is this very far from the fevered imaginings of the UN's real enemies in the US? Much has been written about the dangers of Moslem extremism, and rightly so. But the point is that the Christian fundamentalist extremists, the kind of people who take the ""Left Behind"" garbage seriously, are right there in the driver's seat of American foreign policy, while Moslem extremists are just that -- on the margins of Islam.

(Previous examples include the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles).  I have really, really, liked the books despite myself, and was hoping that this would be a great production.  It's not.  In &quot;Roaring Lambs&quot; the late Bob Briner advised the aspiring Christian film-maker to not pick projects that would require massive scenery and special effects.  The producers have ignored his advice to their detriment.There is a reason that Tom Clancy's &quot;Red Storming Rising&quot; has never been filmed, and there is a reason Tolkien fans have had to wait FORTY years to see the Lord of the Rings on the big screen.  The scope of the production is simply too enormous and the price of failure very, very high.The thing that has made the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series a blockbuster best seller is the pleasure of seeing a valid, yet controversial system of Biblical interpretation  fully worked out in the most concrete and dramatic terms.  It's not Victor Hugo or Charles Dickens, but it is at least as good as the worst Tom Clancy and Stephen King has turned out.  What makes the books work is the use of realistic detail:  CNN, Time Magazine and the U.N. make cameo appearances.  The world is thrown in upheaval on an epic scale.  Disbelief is willingly suspended.  We are seeing our world in the not-distant future, the only thing different (the crucial difference) is that  the symbols of Revelations are entering reality.The shoe-string budget of this movie is it's fatal flaw.

From the various cinematic versions of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; to the &quot;Omen&quot; and its sequels, the interpretive dramatic events surrounding the anticipated (or feared) appearance of the Messiah has drawn large audiences.  The subject works best when there's a central, accessible character and a story that stands on its own.  LEFT BEHIND is a mutant phenomenon that slipped under the radar but impacted the secular, commercial marketplace.  First part of an evangelical best-selling series of books by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, then a direct-to-video release and then, a limited theatrical release.  This is a stupendously badly acted, written and directed sermon that is squarely aimed at the choir.  Based on a controversial interpretation of scripture not shared by all Christians, this story posits a prophetic sequence of events that includes a &quot;secret rapture&quot; when all true believers will be bodily lifted from the planet.  Per this interpretation, all those remaining on earth will endure seven years of trouble and tribulation unlike anything in history until Satan and his followers are destroyed and the earth is made new.

Leaving alone for the moment that I detest Kirk Cameron and have hated Clarence Gilyard since his days in &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, I cannot in good faith recommend this motion picture to anyone.  The production values are awful, the acting is one-dimensional and wooden, and the dialogue comes off as being rather cloying.  And did I mention the &quot;special effects?&quot;  There's nothing special about them at all.  Even &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; looks like Oscar material next to this befuddled mess of a movie.There are a number of rave reviews for &quot;Left Behind&quot; on this site.  Curiously, they seem to coincide with the impending &quot;re-release&quot; of the film in theatres (originally this picture was released direct to video).  One must seriously consider the credibility of those reviews, as many so-called &quot;Christian&quot; groups made known their intent to use any means necessary to get people to see the picture in theatrical release.  One would be well-advised to ignore the hype.  If you still want to view this movie, I recommend renting a VHS copy as a less expensive alternative to the cost of a movie ticket.&quot;Left Behind&quot; is not only the title of the movie, it describes what those thinking of buying it should do...leave it behind!

560385,A6P9HEPEJYM6J,B00004YS9G,"Scott Hay ""Music Junkie!!!""","[0, 1]","When I heard of rumours of the Left Behind movie turning into a movie, I was exstatic. When I finally received the DVD as a Christmas present, I was filled with excitement. After watching the movie, I was floored with disappointment. Let me just name a FEW of the things wrong with this film:a) It's only an hour and 20 minutes. The abridged version of the audio book is 3 hours, and the unabridged version is 10 hours! Basically, this movie is way too short!!! All types of shortcuts and deletions were taken from the book to compress this movie into a compact-sized version of the book. Important characters were removed, and even some characters from the 2nd book were introduced. Plot movement and, yes, characters that don't come around until more than half-way through the book took place in the opening 10 minutes in the movie, It was truly a huge disppointment to see all the best things from the book taken apart piece by piece and excluded from the film.b) The special effects were so corny! I mean, the opening scene was absolutely brutal. I thought I was watching my old plastic G.I. Joe figurines coming to attack Isreal!c) The acting was honestly, for the most part, terrible as well. I can never seem to tell the difference on Kirk Cameron face from when he's expressing humour and joy to when he's exressing sadness and grief! And did anyone else besides me notice that the dude who plays Ken Ritz is always smiling? Oh, and what about the guy who play Nicolae Carpathia? Obviously the guys who put this whole thing together forgot to tell him that in the book, Nicolae speaks PERFECT ENGLISH and doesn't have a Romanian accent!d) The writing overall was lousy. You never had to worry about missing anything related to plot movement because whoever wrote this 'script' would have the characters explain it to the viewer anyway. 'Those planes are going down in flames and we haven't fired a single shot' - Chaim Rosenzweig. NO, REALLY?!Basically I feel that this movie received way too much hype with all the 'high-profile actors' and 'amazing special effects' messages prior to it's release. Frankly, this is just another big let down from Cloud 10 Productions (don't even get me started on their previous releases - ie Tribulation, STARRING Gary Busey, and Howie Mandel!!! or Judgement, STARRING Corbin Bernsen and Mr. T!!!). Let's just hope this new film &quot;Waterproof&quot; (STARRING Burt Reynolds!!!) is for once a release that Christians can be proud of.The only good that has come out of this movie is that SOMEHOW it managed to sell a ton of copies on the shelves which IS a good thing for the Christian film industry. But frankly, for Left Behind fans, the best we can hope to come out of this is a remake of the film 5-10 years down the road.Check out my other reviews for great Christian CDs, books, 'movies', etc.",1,"For a film based on a book, it gets one star.",979257600,"01 12, 2001",2001,2843,"['When', 'heard', 'rumours', 'Left', 'Behind', 'movie', 'turning', 'movie', 'was', 'exstatic', 'When', 'finally', 'received', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'present', 'was', 'filled', 'excitement', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'floored', 'disappointment', 'Let', 'just', 'name', 'FEW', 'things', 'wrong', 'film', 'only', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'abridged', 'version', 'audio', 'book', '3', 'hours', 'unabridged', 'version', '10', 'hours', 'Basically', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'types', 'shortcuts', 'deletions', 'were', 'taken', 'book', 'compress', 'movie', 'compact-sized', 'version', 'book', 'Important', 'characters', 'were', 'removed', 'even', 'characters', '2nd', 'book', 'were', 'introduced', 'Plot', 'movement', 'yes', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'around', 'more', 'half-way', 'book', 'took', 'place', 'opening', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'huge', 'disppointment', 'see', 'best', 'things', 'book', 'taken', 'apart', 'piece', 'piece', 'excluded', 'film.b', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'so', 'corny', 'mean', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brutal', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'old', 'plastic', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'coming', 'attack', 'Isreal', 'c', 'acting', 'was', 'honestly', 'most', 'part', 'terrible', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'tell', 'difference', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'face', 'when', 'expressing', 'humour', 'joy', 'when', 'exressing', 'sadness', 'grief', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'notice', 'dude', 'who', 'Ken', 'Ritz', 'always', 'smiling', 'Oh', 'what', 'guy', 'who', 'play', 'Nicolae', 'Carpathia', 'Obviously', 'guys', 'who', 'put', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'forgot', 'tell', 'book', 'Nicolae', 'PERFECT', 'ENGLISH', ""n't"", 'have', 'Romanian', 'accent', 'd', 'writing', 'overall', 'was', 'lousy', 'never', 'had', 'worry', 'missing', 'anything', 'related', 'plot', 'movement', 'whoever', 'wrote', ""'script"", 'would', 'have', 'characters', 'explain', 'viewer', 'anyway', ""'Those"", 'planes', 'are', 'going', 'down', 'flames', 'have', ""n't"", 'fired', 'single', 'shot', 'Chaim', 'Rosenzweig', 'NO', 'REALLY', 'Basically', 'feel', 'movie', 'received', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'hype', ""'high-profile"", 'actors', ""'amazing"", 'special', 'effects', 'messages', 'prior', 'release', 'Frankly', 'just', 'big', 'let', 'down', 'Cloud', '10', 'Productions', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'previous', 'releases', 'ie', 'Tribulation', 'STARRING', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'Judgement', 'STARRING', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'Mr', 'T', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'new', 'film', 'quot', 'Waterproof', 'quot', 'STARRING', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'once', 'release', 'Christians', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'only', 'good', 'come', 'movie', 'SOMEHOW', 'managed', 'sell', 'ton', 'copies', 'shelves', 'good', 'thing', 'Christian', 'film', 'industry', 'frankly', 'Left', 'Behind', 'fans', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'come', 'remake', 'film', '5-10', 'years', 'down', 'road.Check', 'other', 'reviews', 'great', 'Christian', 'CDs', 'books', ""'movies"", 'etc']",N/A

I am a big fan of the Left Behind novels, and when I saw the trailers for this film, I thought it looked great and pre-ordered it.  I've never seen a Christian film before, and so I wasn't sure what to expect, although I realized it probably wouldn't havethe same production values as a ""normal"" film.This movie reminded me a lot of a USA or TNT made-for-TV film.  It obviously didn't have a large budget, but despite the lack of expensive special effects and big name actors, it is mildly entertaining and does look professional.  I just wish I had rented it instead of buying it.My biggest grip, is with the casting.  Kirk Cameron did not envision my idea of Buck, and Chloe was WAY off. When I was reading the book I never imagined that she'd be some Goth punk with a nose ring.  This type of character is never even hinted at in the novels and I think they probably took some creative license to give their film a little more ""edge.""  I tried to forget about the novels to enjoy the film, but I still couldn't believe in the actors as my favorite characters from the books.  Gordon Currie as Carpathia was an AWFUL choice.  The guy just isn't tough enough to be the anti-Christ.  He seems whiny and weak, not anything like the Carpathia portrayed in the books.Despite all of these problems, ""Left Behind"" isn't a completely horrible film, especially not if you're judging it based against other Christian films.  But as a stand-alone movie, it has a lot of problems, most notably poor acting, a weak novelized screenplay, and a dissatisfying ending.  After reading the novel, I was disappointed with the film.As far as the DVD goes, the video transfer can be a bit grainy and shaky at times, although instances of this are few and shouldn't bother you too much.  Sound quality is not really taken advantage of for a movie that had a theatrical release, and almost all audio is presented from your front speakers, so it doesn't matter if you have surround sound.  Basically, it looks like you're watching a television movie instead of a feature film.DVD extras include a 30-minute ""making of"" special, cast and crew interviews, music videos, and previews of upcoming films.  No commentary on this one.  Overall, if you're a big fan of the book, I'd recommend checking out the film, but advise against purchasing it.

This has been Hollywood's excuse ever since ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".I believe the reason most Hollywood producers wanted nothing to do with the""Christian"" genre is simple ,...they wanted nothing to do with the Christian genre.Cloud Ten Productions certainly never helped the situation, incapable directors, and screenplays a child could have written. Not to mention lackluster performances from some fairly talented actors, kept these movies on the low end of the B-movie totem pole. Then along comes ""Left Behind"" and according to Kirk Cameron this is the low budget christian film that we can really use to change Hollywoods minds. Really!!He wanted us to make posters and stuff and to tell our friends...I tried to tell my friends at MST3K but it had gone off the air.Like most of the ""Cloud Ten""  movies this one is lacking, greatly, unlike the others it had a ready made story in Tim LaHaynes great books, didnt matter, they still turned out a boring, laughable ""SciFi channelish"" production. And low budget aint got any thing to do with it as we see great and inexspensive low budget films all the time.( Robert Rodriquez made his famous El Mariachi for a mere 7000.00.)It has to do with vision,talent and skill, something the books posess and the movies do not.Most of the reviews on Amazon for this movie involve what the filmakers(i use that term loosely) were trying to accomplish, not what they failed to accomplish. So if your looking for this story well told ya have to keep waiting, cause it aint been done yet.Now however Mel Gibson has come thru big with ""The Passion"", and you can bet Hollywood sees the dollar signs.

Hmmmm, I guess all those millions of dollars these authors are making aren't taking their chances of losing any of those dollars after looking at the quality of this half-baked movie version of the popular series.  It's kinda sad, I love the books!  The soundtrack is really good too and you would think the premise of this film would inspire many to support it's cause.  Unfortunately, this movie falls on it's face halfway through the film.  This movie requires more action and suspense if you're going to market a film of apocalyptic proportions to win the masses into theatres come February.  I do have to say that the Michael W Smith song in this movie is hands down one of the best songs Michael has ever written.  This movie starts out really well though.  Plenty of action and suspense.  It just loses steam concentrating too much on Rayford Steeles quest for faith.  Kirk Cameron does fine in this movie!  He fits the character of Buck Williams to a T!  I think they need to concentrate the film more on Kirk Cameron in future films.  I also think the characters need to be (I hate to say it) &quot;more sinful.&quot;  I understand how people would want to steer kids away from this movie but the characters that are &quot;left behind&quot; just don't fit the mold of clean mouthed do-gooders gone bad.  The characters need to be much more raw than what is shown here.  Nicolae is a bit disappointing as well.  He's too skinny and weak looking.  When I read the book Left Behind the first time, I visioned someone like Christian Bale playing the role of Nicolae.  He just has that boy next door, cute and innocent but scary as hell quality he so wonderfully possessed in American Psycho. Overall this movie is somewhat entertaining for the simple fullfilment of seeing what's envisioned from a book to seeing it in a movie.  If plans are to create sequels, they need to stick to the straight to video format for now and stay away from theatres because this movie doesn't ride this story simply on entertainment (which is what theatres really are for).  This movie rides on a message that needs to be addressed in churchs, schools, between friends and family.  That just can't happen in a theatre since most people are not going to a theatre to be preached to, which this movie to some degree does.

560391,A335YAUB8CMNUF,B00004YS9G,The Actor,"[9, 12]","I must agree with the other reviewer that it feels almost cruel to review this movie. This movie has a general low-budget, B-movie feel. I will examine its poor quality in several areas:Story: lame. A hackneyed, mediocre, and unbelievable concept to begin with. Not particularly creative in either concept or story and especially well-executed. There are plenty of other Rapture films out there that have much better storylines than this. The script is often extremely preachy, even speaking as an evangelical Christian. For example, it includes the ""manditory"" scene in which someone ""accepts Jesus,"" even though this has very little to do with the story and does not advance the plot or help develop the characters and was obviously thrown in just because this is an evangelical movie and the filmmakers felt they had to ""evangelize"" people (although I wouldn't show this to my non-Christian friends for sheer embarassment, and if I weren't a Christian, I certainly wouldn't want to see it!).Visuals: not good in the least. Cinematography wasn't impressive to say the least, and the production and visual design, as well as visual elements such as sets, costumes, and makeup were very low quality. David Mamet once rightly commented that a filmmaker must, above all else, think VISUALLY, and the visuals in ""Left Behind"" are sadly lacking.Special effects: horrible. Obviously low-budget. Not convincing in the least.Acting: amateurish. Cameron is alright I guess (although he looks very young for the role), but the rest of the cast isn't. The antichrist character, for example, has a REALLY phony accent.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, Christian or non-Christian. It does not have any artistic merit.",1,Lame as it gets,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,1708,"['must', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'almost', 'cruel', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'general', 'low-budget', 'B-movie', 'feel', 'will', 'examine', 'poor', 'quality', 'several', 'areas', 'Story', 'lame', 'hackneyed', 'mediocre', 'unbelievable', 'concept', 'begin', 'Not', 'particularly', 'creative', 'concept', 'story', 'especially', 'well-executed', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'Rapture', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'that', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'storylines', 'script', 'often', 'extremely', 'preachy', 'even', 'speaking', 'evangelical', 'Christian', 'example', 'manditory', 'scene', 'someone', 'accepts', 'Jesus', 'even', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'story', 'not', 'advance', 'plot', 'help', 'develop', 'characters', 'was', 'obviously', 'thrown', 'just', 'evangelical', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'felt', 'had', 'evangelize', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'non-Christian', 'friends', 'sheer', 'embarassment', 'were', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', '.Visuals', 'not', 'good', 'least', 'Cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'say', 'least', 'production', 'visual', 'design', 'as', 'well', 'visual', 'elements', 'such', 'sets', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'were', 'very', 'low', 'quality', 'David', 'Mamet', 'once', 'rightly', 'commented', 'filmmaker', 'must', 'else', 'think', 'VISUALLY', 'visuals', 'Left', 'Behind', 'are', 'sadly', 'lacking.Special', 'effects', 'horrible', 'Obviously', 'low-budget', 'Not', 'convincing', 'least.Acting', 'amateurish', 'Cameron', 'alright', 'guess', 'very', 'young', 'role', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'antichrist', 'character', 'example', 'REALLY', 'phony', 'accent.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Christian', 'non-Christian', 'not', 'have', 'artistic', 'merit']",N/A

Ok. I'm not a Christian. Haven't been one for years. I read the books for the surrealist aspect of reading books by people that take End Times Prophecy seriously - as opposed to people that find it all a bit silly  - such as the writers of &lt;b>The Omen&lt;/b> or &lt;b>Rosemary's Baby&lt;/b>.I was impressed with this movie because it took a lot of the fat out of the book. Sure there were enough sermons to keep the funamendalists happy but, unlike the books, the sermons took a backstage to the action as Buck slowly realizes that Nicolae Carpathia (a still amusingly obvious name) is the anti-Christ. There's enough conspiracy theory and strangeness to keep audiences going and it doesn't hit you over the head with an agenda like the books.I stopped reading the books at book 3 because I was bogged down with the poor writing style, the overabundance of sermons, the constant flashbacks and the way in which most of the important stuff happened ""off-camera"" so to speak.
