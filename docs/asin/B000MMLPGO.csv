Nothing compares to Sailor Moon and the mystery factor that they have in each episode. I also enjoy Dragon Ball Z but one fight scene can drag across 6 episodes & it also contains a lot of characters just starring at one another waiting 4 something to happen.Anyways this is a great series & resembles Harry Potter somewhat as they are all male warlocks & female witches with special powers so to speak & they go to an academy dedicated to people with magic powers. The main male character can only use his powers like 8 times and 3 girls want to be with him for his DNA but only 1 truly loves him. Anyways it's a fun show & lots of fun laughs with great dubbing as usual from the folks at ADV. Price tag was a big hefty but wait till it drops before you get it. Other then that i really enjoyed this title. It didn't have the ADDICTIVE factor like Sailor Moon but it had enough of it to keep me watching the next episode. Overall i liked it but the animation can seem a bit sloppy or amateurish at times as if the artist were 1st time animators as oppose to artist that have been in the industry for 10 years & have done tons of anime series.,4,Really enjoyable =),1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,1198,"['Anime', 'titles', 'days', 'do', 'little', 'keep', 'interest', 'Nothing', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'mystery', 'factor', 'have', 'episode', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'can', 'drag', '6', 'episodes', 'also', 'lot', 'characters', 'just', 'starring', 'one', 'waiting', '4', 'something', 'happen.Anyways', 'great', 'series', 'resembles', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'somewhat', 'are', 'male', 'warlocks', 'female', 'witches', 'special', 'powers', 'so', 'speak', 'go', 'academy', 'dedicated', 'people', 'magic', 'powers', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'can', 'only', 'use', 'powers', '8', 'times', '3', 'girls', 'want', 'be', 'DNA', 'only', '1', 'truly', 'loves', 'fun', 'show', 'lots', 'fun', 'laughs', 'great', 'dubbing', 'as', 'usual', 'folks', 'ADV', 'Price', 'tag', 'was', 'big', 'hefty', 'wait', 'till', 'get', 'Other', 'then', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'title', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ADDICTIVE', 'factor', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'had', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'next', 'episode', 'Overall', 'i', 'liked', 'animation', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'sloppy', 'amateurish', 'times', 'artist', 'were', '1st', 'time', 'animators', 'oppose', 'artist', 'have', 'been', 'industry', '10', 'years', 'have', 'done', 'tons', 'anime', 'series']",Maburaho - Complete Collection

This is a light-hearted comedy romance with great writing and translation (both subtitles and dubbing). I've seen it compared to Harry Potter series. There are some obvious similarities, but there are considerable differences as well, so don't pass it up thinking it's nothing more than a cheap knock-off. The similarities pretty much end at kids in a school who can use magic. There is no actual antagonist in this series, only conflicting goals and interpersonal frictions, much like in real life. It still manages to keep a good pace and stay interesting throughout the series. It is a comedy-romance mostly, but one even us guys can find entertaining. :P  It has become one of my favorites in a very short time.

1047179,A182VTJIIEVM37,B000MMLPGO,GintaxAlvissforever,"[0, 0]","Maburaho was one of my first harem series besides Tenchi Muyo. Many people like to compare it to Tenchi Muyo because the girls have personalities and that there is a plot in comparison to other harem series that are slow (Love Hina usually comes to mind when I think of the opposite end of harems).The story sets place where magic users all have a set number of magic they can use before they die. The more magic you have, the chances are for you to live longer...But enter the protagonist Kazuki who only can use magic 8 times and he's made fun of for it. Of course, because he has so few magic spells, he can pull off the most incredible abilities such as changing the weather or stopping time.Enter the three main girls Yuna, Kuriko and Rin who go after Kazuki for his genes for different reasons that are spilled out in the very episode. And from there Kazuki starts using his magic to help the girls (thus they really start to fall for him instead of just wanting him for his genes to help their family out one way or another).Of course the series likes to lean toward the main girl Yuna and while that was fine at the beginning because she was the one that cared for Kazuki's wellbeing more so than wanting his genes, halfway through the series, they thought it would be a good idea to just make her a yandere/clingy jealous girl that pretty much ruined Yuna's character because what started out as Yuna being a caring individual makes her very selfish and only thinks about herself even more than Kazuki. That was Kuriko's role to be the mean one and its hard to sympathize with Yuna once her personality goes 180 and is still treated as the good one of the three.Personally my favorite of the three girls is Rin (the girl with blue hair). She's such a dork and generally has the most important reason to wanting Kazuki's genes. It takes her the longest to even crush on Kazuki and when she does, her affection comes off as genuine in contrast to Kuriko who I felt was faking it for most of the series (plus her double standard line about how nobody would care if a man was sexually assaulted rubbed me the wrong way) and Yuna after her personality changed for the worse.I think another thing that angered me is how the magic world is never explained. Shuffles has the same problem in which they introduce a magical world but focus more on the harem rather than the setting. The fact that Kazuki's magic is shown to constantly be shown to be powerful and could have evolved into a magical action series like Negima or Rozario Vampire is a huge disappointment when you re-watch it. Plus Kazuki is specifically hated in his class for no real reason at the beginning. Yes the girls liking him only fuels the fire but beside Kazuki saying he's a loser, we never actually see anything else on why he deserves the hate in the first place. It just seems to be there for the sole reason of Kazuki not being able to rely on anybody else except the three stalkers.Overall looking back it was a fun ride originally but when you re-watch it, there are so many things that could have been better. 70/100.",3,A Cute Harem But Has its Problems,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,3098,"['Maburaho', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'harem', 'series', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Many', 'people', 'compare', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'girls', 'have', 'personalities', 'plot', 'comparison', 'other', 'harem', 'series', 'are', 'slow', 'Love', 'Hina', 'usually', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'opposite', 'end', 'harems', '.The', 'story', 'sets', 'place', 'where', 'magic', 'users', 'have', 'set', 'number', 'magic', 'can', 'use', 'die', 'more', 'magic', 'have', 'chances', 'are', 'live', 'longer', 'enter', 'protagonist', 'Kazuki', 'who', 'only', 'can', 'use', 'magic', '8', 'times', 'made', 'fun', 'course', 'so', 'few', 'magic', 'spells', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'most', 'incredible', 'abilities', 'such', 'changing', 'weather', 'stopping', 'time.Enter', 'three', 'main', 'girls', 'Yuna', 'Kuriko', 'Rin', 'who', 'go', 'Kazuki', 'genes', 'different', 'reasons', 'are', 'spilled', 'out', 'very', 'episode', 'Kazuki', 'using', 'magic', 'help', 'girls', 'thus', 'really', 'start', 'fall', 'instead', 'just', 'wanting', 'genes', 'help', 'family', 'one', 'way', '.Of', 'course', 'series', 'lean', 'main', 'girl', 'Yuna', 'was', 'fine', 'beginning', 'was', 'one', 'cared', 'Kazuki', 'wellbeing', 'more', 'so', 'wanting', 'genes', 'halfway', 'series', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'make', 'yandere/clingy', 'jealous', 'girl', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'Yuna', 'character', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'Yuna', 'being', 'caring', 'individual', 'very', 'selfish', 'only', 'thinks', 'even', 'more', 'Kazuki', 'was', 'Kuriko', 'role', 'be', 'mean', 'one', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'Yuna', 'once', 'personality', '180', 'still', 'treated', 'good', 'one', 'three.Personally', 'favorite', 'three', 'girls', 'Rin', 'girl', 'blue', 'hair', 'such', 'dork', 'generally', 'most', 'important', 'reason', 'wanting', 'Kazuki', 'genes', 'longest', 'even', 'crush', 'Kazuki', 'when', 'affection', 'off', 'genuine', 'contrast', 'Kuriko', 'who', 'felt', 'was', 'faking', 'most', 'series', 'double', 'standard', 'line', 'how', 'nobody', 'would', 'care', 'man', 'was', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'Yuna', 'personality', 'changed', 'worse.I', 'think', 'thing', 'angered', 'how', 'magic', 'world', 'never', 'explained', 'Shuffles', 'same', 'problem', 'introduce', 'magical', 'world', 'focus', 'more', 'harem', 'rather', 'setting', 'fact', 'Kazuki', 'magic', 'shown', 'constantly', 'be', 'shown', 'be', 'powerful', 'could', 'have', 'evolved', 'magical', 'action', 'series', 'Negima', 'Rozario', 'Vampire', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'when', 're-watch', 'Kazuki', 'specifically', 'hated', 'class', 'real', 'reason', 'beginning', 'Yes', 'girls', 'liking', 'only', 'fuels', 'fire', 'beside', 'Kazuki', 'saying', 'loser', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'anything', 'else', 'why', 'hate', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'sole', 'reason', 'Kazuki', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'rely', 'anybody', 'else', 'three', 'stalkers.Overall', 'looking', 'back', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'originally', 'when', 're-watch', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', '70/100']",Maburaho - Complete Collection
1047180,ADTFUJS8HJN16,B000MMLPGO,"Hajime Takai ""Fox_FX""","[9, 9]","The series revolves Kazuki Shikimori, a kid who is basically a loser, yet in a world where magic reigns supreme, his lineage gives him the genes to give birth to the greatest magician in the world. Word of this gets around to 3 girls inparticular, one adopted to western society, another a business tycoon heir, and the third a traditional japanese family. It's gonna be a ride for Shikimori as all the girls want his genes...The series I thought had a good story line, even at 24 episodes (600+ minutes), the series could have gone on longer. The animation is extremely well as far as magic designs go and the actual characters themselves, which are very detailed. The series has alot of humor and I found myself laughing through every episode. Music choice for the series also wasn't a bad choice at all. The ending of the series (and I'm putting this cause some think it can affect the entire series) left me hanging to a degree because another question was raised, so to speak, but I was satisfied none the less because it ended the way I hoped it would for the most part.Although overall I gave the series the 5 star, there are some things that might bother others that didn't bother me. The series does contain alot, and I mean alot, of girls in there underwear, alot of sexual instances, and 2 episodes that contained a brief amount of nudity. Again, this didn't bother me in that, I myself, thought it fit with getting the message across, such as giving in to temptation and showing that Shikimori has the mind of an average 17 year old that likes girls (I think most of us guys can relate).Overall, I wouldn't get this series for anyone under 14 (as the rating suggest). The language is actually pretty clean, and with the exception of the brief nudity, everything else worked out fine for the series. Overall animation was great, story was excellent, humor is priceless, and I'd watch it all over again.

It is deliberately over the top, (just look at the size of some of those jiggling spheres...could anyone draw those with a straight face?) silly, touching and effectively hilarious. Each character retains enough emotional depth and uniqueness to remain interesting and endearing throughout. (although, admittedly, I couldn't help but feel that Rin felt somehow incongruous most of the time)Anyone who approaches this anime expecting to see the pinochle of dramatic achievement is missing the point (and, quite frankly, is the biggest boob involved in this whole thing) Despite all of its assets, Maburaho does have some substantial flaws-the story REALLY loses its steam about halfway through the series and resorts to some pretty dull filler episodes before regaining its momentum towards the end, which brings up another problem...the ending is way too convenient...it certainly doesn't ruin the series, though and may even put a smile on your face. All in all, Maburaho is simply an anime to be laughed at-it was written, directed and animated as such, so why not just sit back and do just that? Who knows?

You can skip this paragraph if you already know the plot ^_-  It is a story about a world where EVERYONE can use magic.  Worth and value are placed on people with strong magic.  Even more worth and value is placed on people who can use their magic lots of times (they can tell how many times one has left to use, by using a special magic meter).  Once a person has used up their limit of magic uses, they they turn into ash and (generally) die.  Kazuki, the hero of the show, just so happens to have the strongest magic on the planet.  His ancestors were all ridiculously powerful magicians, and his genes are worth a LOT to some of the most powerful families in Japan.  This leads to most of the girls initial contact with him, they are told by their families to either marry him and breed, or to just breed (depending on the family).  The major problem with all of this, is that Kazuki only has 8 magic uses left before he turns to ash, at the start of the show, and he seems to be burning through them pretty quickly...So, the story has a lot of heart, and it has characters you can really get behind, and cheer for.  My favorite is Rin, she is just so loveable, you just want to hug her.  Especially when she is being sad because nobody wants to see what her biology club is up to.I could make strong comparisons to any harem anim&eacute; with Maburaho, but I will use Tenchi Muyo (because that is another of my favorites).  The main character, Kazuki, is a wuss -- just like Tenchi.  He is shy around women, and will instantly cave to anything to ask of him -- just like Tenchi.  He also has a mysteriously strong inner power (in this case, his magic, and not the power of Jurai) which can overcome darn near anything -- just like Tenchi.  He also has a lot of trouble using his power -- just like Tenchi -- although in his case it is not a matter of learning to make Light Hawk Wings on his own, but instead it is due to the severely limited number of times he can use his magic.  He also has a bad case of ""Knight-on-a-white-horse"" syndrome, and he is constantly trying to save every female around him, who gets into any sort of trouble -- just like Tenchi.The 3 main girls in the show are Yuna, who behaves a lot like a combination of Aeka and Sasami from Tenchi Muyo.  Rin, who behaves a lot like Ryouko from Tenchi Muyo.  And Kuriko, who behaves a lot like Washu and borrows Mihoshi's busty blond look.The girls are in no way clones to the girls in Tenchi Muyo.  They all have their own personality quirks, and they all have character aspects that set them apart as their own characters.  Also, overall, once the show really begins to move, the girls are a lot NICER to each other, than the girls in Tenchi Muyo.I like this show because of the pretty Shonen artwork, the interesting magic aspect, and the heart and personality given to all of the characters, and the amount of comedy and general silliness in the stories.  Yes, it is another harem anim&eacute;, but I don't see that as a bad thing.",5,Just Another Harem Anim&eacute;?,1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,3347,"['just', 'picked', 'up', 'complete', 'series', 'collection', 'Maburaho', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'impressed', 'Yes', 'harem', 'anim', 'eacute', 'same', 'category', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'Hina', 'etc', 'really', 'so', 'bad', 'Here', 'quick', 'run-down', 'plot', 'case', 'review', 'be', 'first', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'Maburaho', 'can', 'skip', 'paragraph', 'already', 'know', 'plot', '^_-', 'story', 'world', 'where', 'EVERYONE', 'can', 'use', 'magic', 'Worth', 'value', 'are', 'placed', 'people', 'strong', 'magic', 'Even', 'more', 'worth', 'value', 'placed', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'use', 'magic', 'lots', 'times', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'one', 'left', 'use', 'using', 'special', 'magic', 'meter', 'Once', 'person', 'used', 'up', 'limit', 'magic', 'uses', 'turn', 'ash', 'generally', 'die', 'Kazuki', 'hero', 'show', 'just', 'so', 'have', 'strongest', 'magic', 'planet', 'ancestors', 'were', 'ridiculously', 'powerful', 'magicians', 'genes', 'are', 'LOT', 'most', 'powerful', 'families', 'Japan', 'most', 'girls', 'initial', 'contact', 'are', 'told', 'families', 'marry', 'breed', 'just', 'breed', 'depending', 'family', 'major', 'problem', 'Kazuki', 'only', '8', 'magic', 'uses', 'left', 'ash', 'start', 'show', 'be', 'burning', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'So', 'story', 'lot', 'heart', 'characters', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'cheer', 'favorite', 'Rin', 'just', 'so', 'loveable', 'just', 'want', 'hug', 'Especially', 'when', 'being', 'sad', 'nobody', 'see', 'what', 'biology', 'club', 'up', 'to.I', 'could', 'make', 'strong', 'comparisons', 'harem', 'anim', 'eacute', 'Maburaho', 'will', 'use', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'favorites', 'main', 'character', 'Kazuki', 'wuss', 'just', 'Tenchi', 'shy', 'women', 'will', 'instantly', 'cave', 'anything', 'ask', 'just', 'Tenchi', 'also', 'mysteriously', 'strong', 'inner', 'power', 'case', 'magic', 'not', 'power', 'Jurai', 'can', 'overcome', 'darn', 'anything', 'just', 'Tenchi', 'also', 'lot', 'trouble', 'using', 'power', 'just', 'Tenchi', 'case', 'not', 'matter', 'learning', 'make', 'Light', 'Hawk', 'Wings', 'own', 'instead', 'due', 'severely', 'limited', 'number', 'times', 'can', 'use', 'magic', 'also', 'bad', 'case', 'Knight-on-a-white-horse', 'syndrome', 'constantly', 'trying', 'save', 'female', 'who', 'sort', 'trouble', 'just', 'Tenchi.The', '3', 'main', 'girls', 'show', 'are', 'Yuna', 'who', 'lot', 'combination', 'Aeka', 'Sasami', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Rin', 'who', 'lot', 'Ryouko', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Kuriko', 'who', 'lot', 'Washu', 'Mihoshi', 'busty', 'blond', 'look.The', 'girls', 'are', 'way', 'girls', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'have', 'own', 'personality', 'quirks', 'have', 'character', 'aspects', 'set', 'apart', 'own', 'characters', 'Also', 'overall', 'once', 'show', 'really', 'move', 'girls', 'are', 'lot', 'NICER', 'other', 'girls', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo.I', 'show', 'pretty', 'Shonen', 'artwork', 'interesting', 'magic', 'aspect', 'heart', 'personality', 'given', 'characters', 'amount', 'comedy', 'general', 'silliness', 'stories', 'Yes', 'harem', 'anim', 'eacute', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'bad', 'thing']",Maburaho - Complete Collection
