At first glimpse I wasnt sure what I had gotten myself into with the hiphop music and thugs running around the hood of England.  Visually the film wasnt that great and the gay bashing only managed to piss me off. Then suddenly the brilliance of the director stepped forward and the movie went from ugly to beautiful when the Angel Olivier appear.  It was love at first sight. He was so beautiful in so many ways he changed the movie completely.  Yes this film is rough but it makes sense.  There is gay bashing, semi-masturbation, SERIOUS rape, male/male prostitution and alot of blood and violence.  The movie is good.  It really pulls at the heart strings and works ones emotions.  You really feel for the characters well Olivier and Cal, I wanted to kill that Nessa girl.  Cal's buddy is interesting and would make a great movie all on his own or at least a great Psychology study subject.  It all comes together nicely with a couple of weak, but interesting twists.  If you dont wanna buy it, at least rent it, its a good movie to watch at least once.",4,The Angel Olivier,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1168,"['have', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'while', 'only', 'got', 'last', 'night', 'THANK', 'GOD', 'FOR', 'NETFLIX', 'first', 'glimpse', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'what', 'had', 'gotten', 'hiphop', 'music', 'thugs', 'running', 'hood', 'England', 'Visually', 'film', 'wasnt', 'great', 'gay', 'bashing', 'only', 'managed', 'piss', 'off', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'brilliance', 'director', 'stepped', 'forward', 'movie', 'went', 'ugly', 'beautiful', 'when', 'Angel', 'Olivier', 'appear', 'was', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'changed', 'movie', 'completely', 'Yes', 'film', 'rough', 'sense', 'gay', 'bashing', 'semi-masturbation', 'SERIOUS', 'rape', 'male/male', 'prostitution', 'alot', 'blood', 'violence', 'movie', 'good', 'really', 'heart', 'strings', 'ones', 'emotions', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'well', 'Olivier', 'Cal', 'wanted', 'kill', 'Nessa', 'girl', 'Cal', 'buddy', 'interesting', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'own', 'least', 'great', 'Psychology', 'study', 'subject', 'together', 'nicely', 'couple', 'weak', 'interesting', 'twists', 'dont', 'wan', 'buy', 'least', 'rent', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'least', 'once']",N/A

1275694,A165QTRGCJVCZZ,B002L1YGRY,Elton T. Elliott,"[105, 110]","The film, ""Shank"" was one of the offerings at the 14th Annual Gay and Lesbian Film Festival at the Carolina Theater in Durham, NC from August 13th through August 16th, 2009.  It was not an easy film to watch because it depicted gang members who spent their days drinking and using drugs and filling their nights as a group picking out gay men who happened to be alone and defenseless, beating them senseless just for fun.  In that gang was a young man named Cal who was a closeted gay man fighting it with everything he was worth.  The problem was, he was in love with the defacto-leader of the gang, so much so that the desires he felt had bubbled up from their depths and in spite of himself, he found himself seeking out ways to meet those needs with strange men.  The tightrope he had to walk was this: meet those desires but at all costs never let the gang discover he was doing it.  He was so conflicted that after he would give in to his desires, he would become physically sick and woe to any man who happened to be his pickup if he assumed after the incident that Cal was gay.One night, the prey that the gang selected for their gay bashing was a young college student and before the beating completely got out of hand, Cal stopped it surprising both the gang members and the victim, as well as himself.  The victim, Oliver, was so thankful to Cal for saving him, he brought him home and treated him nicely giving Cal his first opportunity to have a decent relationship.  But, the gang members couldn't let Cal drop out of the gang.  That would be treason and would require revenge, so as each day passed they planned and plotted to win him back, but that was before they discovered his secret.  When they found out what Cal had been up to, pay-back was required and a scheme that would outrank anything they had ever done began to take shape.Again, it was not an easy movie to watch but we need to see these kind of films to be reminded that there are places in this world where gays and lesbians are not safe without others to back us up.  And don't be fooled that America is exempt from this hatred (it has only been a few short years since the incident of Matthew Shepherd occurred).  Many hate us and would rather see us dead or never born than to see us walking around gay and proud.But, back to the film itself and what I think made it not just a good movie but a great one.  Near the end of the film there was a scene where no words were spoken.  Two actions were taken by two of the characters in the film one of which was a request for forgiveness and the other was a granting of that request.  The scene simply accomplished what the most elaborate words could have never achieved.  It was a scene that will live forever in my memory.  Rent the DVD when it comes out in October and see if you can pick out the scene I'm talking about.",5,UP THERE WITH THE BEST OF MY FAVORITE FILMS,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,2853,"['film', 'Shank', 'was', 'one', 'offerings', '14th', 'Annual', 'Gay', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Carolina', 'Theater', 'Durham', 'NC', 'August', '13th', 'August', '16th', '2009', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'depicted', 'gang', 'members', 'who', 'spent', 'days', 'drinking', 'using', 'drugs', 'filling', 'nights', 'group', 'picking', 'out', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'alone', 'defenseless', 'beating', 'senseless', 'just', 'fun', 'gang', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Cal', 'who', 'was', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'fighting', 'everything', 'was', 'worth', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'love', 'defacto-leader', 'gang', 'so', 'much', 'desires', 'felt', 'had', 'bubbled', 'up', 'depths', 'spite', 'found', 'seeking', 'out', 'ways', 'meet', 'needs', 'strange', 'men', 'tightrope', 'had', 'walk', 'was', 'meet', 'desires', 'costs', 'never', 'let', 'gang', 'discover', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'so', 'conflicted', 'would', 'give', 'desires', 'would', 'become', 'physically', 'sick', 'woe', 'man', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'pickup', 'assumed', 'incident', 'Cal', 'was', 'gay.One', 'night', 'prey', 'gang', 'selected', 'gay', 'bashing', 'was', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'beating', 'completely', 'got', 'hand', 'Cal', 'stopped', 'surprising', 'gang', 'members', 'victim', 'as', 'well', 'victim', 'Oliver', 'was', 'so', 'thankful', 'Cal', 'saving', 'brought', 'home', 'treated', 'nicely', 'giving', 'Cal', 'first', 'opportunity', 'have', 'decent', 'relationship', 'gang', 'members', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'Cal', 'drop', 'gang', 'would', 'be', 'treason', 'would', 'require', 'revenge', 'so', 'day', 'passed', 'planned', 'plotted', 'win', 'back', 'was', 'discovered', 'secret', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'Cal', 'had', 'been', 'up', 'pay-back', 'was', 'required', 'scheme', 'would', 'outrank', 'anything', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'began', 'take', 'shape.Again', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'need', 'see', 'kind', 'films', 'be', 'reminded', 'are', 'places', 'world', 'where', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'others', 'back', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'America', 'exempt', 'hatred', 'only', 'been', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'incident', 'Matthew', 'Shepherd', 'occurred', 'Many', 'hate', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'dead', 'never', 'born', 'see', 'walking', 'gay', 'proud.But', 'back', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'made', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'one', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'words', 'were', 'spoken', 'Two', 'actions', 'were', 'taken', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'request', 'forgiveness', 'other', 'was', 'granting', 'request', 'scene', 'simply', 'accomplished', 'what', 'most', 'elaborate', 'words', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'achieved', 'was', 'scene', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'memory', 'Rent', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'October', 'see', 'can', 'pick', 'out', 'scene', ""'m"", 'talking']",N/A
1275695,AAPFN1BADMWMC,B002L1YGRY,"Giancarlo Croce ""Offer VOID where prohibited""","[2, 2]","""Shank"" is a brilliantly well constructed and photographed film. It's really surprising to see an independent film with production values of this quality. On this basis alone, it deserves four stars.The idea behind the story is the self-loathing and eventual self-acceptance of the main character, Cal. Cal is a sort of pimply faced, mulatto who hangs out with a Bristol street gang headed by his psychotic ex-girlfriend. He's secretly in love with beautiful, strong and deeply angry Johnno, who has some rather murky sexual identity issues of his own.  Cal satisfies his homosexual urgings by meeting men online and asking them to 'use' him. For all his tough-guy pretences in front of his gang, he enjoys being sexually passive, almost to the point of being abused.Cal's first encounter in the film is with a schoolteacher he's met online. After taking him out in the forest for sex, he bends over and allows the teacher to use him, at length. After sex, he hits the teacher in the head, and leaves him stranded and bleeding. But later, when Cal's friends attack an obviously gay, frail looking French student named Olivier, Cal is drawn to his gazelle-like beauty and grace. Cal is forced to turn against his friends to help Olivier, and when the gang turns on Cal, Cal turns to Olivier for solace. Living with Olivier, building a romantic and sexual relationship with him, Cal begins to realise that his occasional homosexual encounters have not just been one-off sexual urges, and that he truly is Gay. In fact, he falls in love with Olivier.The story line is at times a bit hard to swallow, but the over-dramatization of some scenes seems intentional. This is a tale of redemption, as we watch Cal change miraculously from Gay Basher to Gay Bashed, finally to Gay Man.  It may seem over the top and hokey at times, but it's a good story, and a nicely done film.",4,Beauty and Horror,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,1867,"['Shank', 'brilliantly', 'well', 'constructed', 'photographed', 'film', 'really', 'surprising', 'see', 'independent', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'quality', 'basis', 'alone', 'four', 'stars.The', 'idea', 'story', 'self-loathing', 'eventual', 'self-acceptance', 'main', 'character', 'Cal', 'Cal', 'sort', 'pimply', 'faced', 'mulatto', 'who', 'out', 'Bristol', 'street', 'gang', 'headed', 'psychotic', 'ex-girlfriend', 'secretly', 'love', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'deeply', 'angry', 'Johnno', 'who', 'rather', 'murky', 'sexual', 'identity', 'issues', 'own', 'Cal', 'homosexual', 'urgings', 'meeting', 'men', 'online', 'asking', ""'use"", 'tough-guy', 'pretences', 'front', 'gang', 'being', 'sexually', 'passive', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'abused.Cal', 'first', 'encounter', 'film', 'schoolteacher', 'met', 'online', 'taking', 'out', 'forest', 'sex', 'teacher', 'use', 'length', 'sex', 'teacher', 'head', 'stranded', 'bleeding', 'later', 'when', 'Cal', 'friends', 'attack', 'obviously', 'gay', 'frail', 'looking', 'French', 'student', 'named', 'Olivier', 'Cal', 'drawn', 'gazelle-like', 'beauty', 'grace', 'Cal', 'forced', 'turn', 'friends', 'help', 'Olivier', 'when', 'gang', 'Cal', 'Cal', 'Olivier', 'solace', 'Living', 'Olivier', 'building', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Cal', 'realise', 'occasional', 'homosexual', 'encounters', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'been', 'one-off', 'sexual', 'urges', 'truly', 'Gay', 'fact', 'love', 'Olivier.The', 'story', 'line', 'times', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'over-dramatization', 'scenes', 'intentional', 'tale', 'redemption', 'watch', 'Cal', 'change', 'miraculously', 'Gay', 'Basher', 'Gay', 'Bashed', 'finally', 'Gay', 'Man', 'may', 'seem', 'top', 'hokey', 'times', 'good', 'story', 'nicely', 'done', 'film']",N/A

1275697,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002L1YGRY,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","SHANK is an important debut film for director Simon Pearce (apparently only 21 years old) and writers Darren Flaxstone and Christian Martin.  The story has the courage to be honest enough to view gang behavior and the cross section of needs that gang membership provides to young lads in search of their true identity: first comes identification through 'belonging' to like lost souls, and second comes the breakthrough of self discovery.  The fact that this rather terrifying tale is based on fact as lived by the writers adds to the punch the film carries.Cal (Wayne Virgo) is the vulnerable lead lad, a member of a Bristol gang led by a rather despicable female Nessa (Alice Payne) who finds pleasure in 'filming' the gang's bashing of victims.  Cal takes on this trait by seeking out victims for release of his same sex energy, using drugs to render his victims cooperative, films his conquests using a cellphone camera, and then beats the victims bloody: an early scene illustrates this behavior with a teacher named Scott (Gary Summers) who while recovering shares the incident with an off screen therapist, gradually unfolding the fact that Scott's partner was abused by this same gang. While Cal displays this pugilistic behavior in secret, in the presence of his gang his physical attraction to fellow gang member Jonno (Tom Bott, in an impressive film debut) surfaces - an attraction that appears to be reciprocal were it not for the forbidden arena of same sex love.  The gang attacks a young French exchange student Olivier (Marc Lambert), but Cal cannot tolerate the abuse of this obviously innocent gay lad and follows him, offering him a ride home, and eventually merging into accepting his sexual identity with the kindness of Olivier's open heart.  Once the gang discovers Cal's desertion, the stalking begins and Jonno awakens to his own needs for Cal - much to the chagrin of the coarse Nessa.  There is a final confrontation between Cal and Olivier  and the gang, and Jonno exacts his revenge and devastation in a brutal attack.  The manner in which the characters resolve their needs and find themselves is the ending of the film.The young cast is excellent and the varying chemistries among them is credible.  The film is a British Indie and would be more impressive if the dialogue was not so covered with extraneous sound and by the use of Bristol accents which are all but unintelligible.  Virgo, Laurent and especially Bott make strong impressions for a debut outing. This team will likely be heard from in additional films.

1275699,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B002L1YGRY,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[15, 16]","I first saw this U.K. indie gay-themed film a few months ago ata friends' house and liked it very much. It's about a handsome young streethouligan (Wayne Virgo) who runs around with a rag-tag group of vicious streettoughs who vandalize property, steal, rob, and bash innocent gay men.Secretly though, he has conflicted gay longings and privately immerses himselfin the world of internet gay porn and hook-up sites.He often meets with middle-aged closeted or openly gay men in seedy areasof public parks to have sex, then he turns around an assults them after it's over,really assaulting his own hidden all-consuming desire for M2M relations.He is able to keep all this under the surface for the most part,though there is a definite unspoken attraction between himself and one ofthe most virulent & macho members in his gang.The two come close to acting on it a couple of times, once while getting hightogether in a parked car, but their fear of being perceived as ""gay"" andhaving their ""secret"" exposed by the other is too strong.So they channel their frustrations into more mayhem, vandalism and gay bashing.This goes on and on until one day when they bash a very graceful, kind,and somewhat effeminate openly gay exchange student who's just out shoppingand minding his own business. Something about this doesn't sit well insideWayne Virgo's character and he jumps to the defense of the bloodied & crying gay boy.This act automatically alienates him from his gang of thug friends and theyvow revenge and retaliation!Meanwhile, he and the exchange student who he rescues slowly become freindsand then of course, lovers. They strengthen their bond, get to know each other,make hot gay love, and through this, Virgo's character learns to love and accepthimself and embrace who he is. He also hides out there from his old gang's wrath.**This is the part in the film which I think a few scenes may have beencut out, because the transition from being a gay-bashing street tough whois sexually confused to being in a full on open gay relationship is very quick! (-:For that reason, I took a star from this review for a lag in the story's continuity.**In the meantime, his old gang members, who are still quite miffed attheir former friends' sudden turnaround, vow to make him pay!They show up at his old apartment and vandalize it...then they inadvertentlyfind out about his secret gay internet life and even view videos that weremade by him during his public park play sessions....FUMING, they proclaimthat he MUST DIE NOW!! Most outraged of course, is the macho gang memberwho has had the secret crush on him but never had the guts to act on it!He feels betrayed in more ways than one, and selfishly so! (Closet case!)Well, without giving much more away, it suffices to say that thereis much more drama, violence, and even a bizzare gay rape scene whichtakes place between the miffed macho gang member and Virgo's characteronce the gang finally catches up to him and his new found lover.This happens in full view of the other gang members!---STRANGE!!Especially since they are supposed to be attacking him & his loverfor being gay in the first place!---(Hmmmmm, paging Doctors Freud & Kinsky!!)Overall, though this movie is a british indie and they were obviously workingon a limited budget, they still found a way to weave together a storywhich is entertaining & engaging, though there are places where the story kindof jumps around a bit. The gay sex scenes are not done just for sensationalismor shock value (ala ""Shortbus""), but are very natural, as they would bewith two young gay men discovering themselves and expressing their blossominglove for each other would in real life.They are very graphic for the most part, but hey, I say if itbothers you that much, then why are you checking out a gay-themed indiefilm in the first place, right?

1275704,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002L1YGRY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I was intrigued when I heard that writer/director Christian Martin was doing a follow-up piece to the tough ""Shank"" from 2009.  As I hadn't seen that movie in a number of years, I decided to refresh my memory about the journey of its young protagonist Cal.  This gritty picture is really a classic coming-of-age story with a tough street punk coming to grips with his sexual identity and starting to connect with the life he wants to lead as opposed to the one he's grown accustomed to.  ""Shank"" is fairly divisive, some say it's a masterpiece while others aren't so generous.  From a technical standpoint, the movie is certainly rough around the edges (just like our hero).  Both amateurish and over-the top at times, the picture still connects on a visceral level that resonated with me.  And in that way, it is successful at what it attempts.  The sequel, 2013's ""Cal,"" is no less ambitious.  In fact, it's ideas are much more complex thematically.  But by attempting something a little bigger, Martin has come up with something that feels altogether less organic and truthful.Shank (4 Stars):  When we meet Cal (Wayne Virgo), he is a closeted bad boy that runs with his crew, secretly lusts after his best mate, and keeps up a facade even as the gang commits rather random acts of violence.  One day, something snaps in Cal as he is part of an attack on a relatively flamboyant foreign student (Marc Laurent).  He breaks up the fight and this seems to be the complete undoing of his life.  The transition itself is rough.  In one scene, he is lifelong friends with these guys but, after this event, they're willing to murder him.  As Cal takes a forced break from his mates, he has nowhere to go except into the arms of Laurent.  The relationship develops and Cal sees another chance at life.  Things continue to spiral out of control, however, until the inevitably violent conclusion brings Cal's world into focus.  Although gritty and occasionally silly, Cal's sense of hope, desperation, and need of connection are palpable and effective.  It's not a perfect movie, by any means, but it works.Cal (2 Stars):  Everything that I connected with on an emotional level is absent from the sequel.  Cal returns to Britain upon the news that his mother is ill.  Not much is referenced in way of back story so this would be perfectly fine as a stand-alone piece.  The only thing we learn is that Cal has been traveling Europe and working in the culinary trade.  Martin (as both writer and director) paints this as a significant movie by the depiction of economic despair that has brought the city to its knees.  Unrest, anger, and outright violence shadow every scene and make for a rather gloomy backdrop.  Heck, just wait until you see the assistance working sneer at a very polite and well-spoken Cal because he's asking about a job.  A little subtlety would have benefited the movie considerably.  Although never mentioned in the previous movie, Cal is taken into his mother's home by her lodger (a rather comical Emily Corcoran).  Cal is resistant to see his mother due to her disappointment about his life choices.  But aside from a nice scene at the end, not enough is made of this plot point.  Instead, Cal gets into trouble breaking up a fight in a public restroom.  A young hustler is being beaten by his handler.  Before you can say ""boo,"" Cal is pressed into the unsavory services of a new brand of thug and is once again experiencing an unlikely romance.The problem, for me, with ""Cal"" is that it wants to be too many things.  Is it a social critique of our economic decline?  Is it a reconciliation story, a continuation of the coming-of-age sage as Cal comes to terms with his family?  Or is it a look at the seamier side of prostitution?  With a little bit of focus on each, nothing really connects.  The economic side plot is so heavy handed, the family story is not developed sufficiently, and the prostitution angle is downright silly most of the time.  While I was hopeful, I just didn't care for this picture.  I still liked Wayne Virgo and the visible maturity he displays compared to his last effort in ""Shank.""  And, at least, Corcoran is good for a laugh in an over-the-top performance.  But the emotional payoff is slight (with the exception of one scene) and the action is not believable.  I'll look out for Martin's next picture, but ""Cal"" didn't do it for me.

Other reviewers have detailed the story in fuller terms so I won't repeat them, but in summary it's the story of a closeted gay gang member, attempting to find a place for himself in the world in which he lives. This he is only able to do it seems with the assitance of two outsiders, the French exchange student and the University proffessor.For me this is where the story comes apart to the point of being a little offensive and hugely patronising. Other reviewers have mentioned about the low budgets, production values etc. For me this isn't so much of a problem as is the glaringly obvious classist subtext: working class men can only understand, express and deal with their sexuality through the mediums they know best, violence and criminality (rape). BUT; they can be 'saved' and 'elevated' above the level of the beasts of the field when nice, genteel, educated, middle-class folk kindly step in (who are at the same time getting their rocks off with a piece of rough).So the French student 'teaches' the 'yob' how to dress like a 'proper' gay; and both the student and the professor rescue him from his persecutors and end with baptizing him into the Ways of the Gays by giving him a nice bath and laying him out in crisp white sheets.As far as I'm concerned this film is barely one step away from the Victorians measuring the heads of the criminal classes.",1,"Stereotyped, cliche-ridden tripe!!!",1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,1438,"['had', 'heard', 'good', 'reviews', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'go', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'detailed', 'story', 'fuller', 'terms', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'summary', 'story', 'closeted', 'gay', 'gang', 'member', 'attempting', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'only', 'able', 'do', 'assitance', 'two', 'outsiders', 'French', 'exchange', 'student', 'University', 'proffessor.For', 'where', 'story', 'apart', 'point', 'being', 'little', 'offensive', 'hugely', 'patronising', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'low', 'budgets', 'production', 'values', 'etc', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'problem', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'classist', 'subtext', 'working', 'class', 'men', 'can', 'only', 'understand', 'express', 'deal', 'sexuality', 'mediums', 'know', 'best', 'violence', 'criminality', 'rape', 'BUT', 'can', 'be', ""'saved"", ""'elevated"", 'level', 'beasts', 'field', 'when', 'nice', 'genteel', 'educated', 'middle-class', 'folk', 'kindly', 'step', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'getting', 'rocks', 'off', 'piece', 'rough', 'French', 'student', ""'teaches"", ""'yob"", 'how', 'dress', ""'proper"", 'gay', 'student', 'professor', 'rescue', 'persecutors', 'end', 'baptizing', 'Ways', 'Gays', 'giving', 'nice', 'bath', 'laying', 'out', 'crisp', 'white', 'sheets.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'film', 'barely', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'Victorians', 'measuring', 'heads', 'criminal', 'classes']",N/A

1275715,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002L1YGRY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Shank (Simon Pearce, 2009)I stumbled upon Shank while I was looking for a copy of Shanks, the infamous 1974 William Castle film starring Marcel Marceau. (Which I did eventually find, viz. my review on 2Mar2013.) This one looked interesting, so I threw it on my Netflix queue, where it joined almost four hundred other titles, and I promptly forgot about it. Fast-forward a year or more and, for various reasons, I wound up stuck in the hospital. It was the first time I'd been overnight in a hospital where I was the patient in over thirty years. Things have changed. They had to clear my friggin' laptop with the electrical department, for pete's sake. So that first night, stuck with a godawful roommate who spent the entire insufferable eighteen hours I was stuck in a room with him complaining a mile a minute to anyone who would listen (I kid you not, he did not sleep), the only way I had to watch anything other than broadcast TV, which I swore off a couple of years ago, was on a phone. And ESPN3 wasn't showing any cricket that night, so I popped open the Netflix queue, spun the scrollbar, and then stabbed at the moving queue to pick something as close to at random as I could. And thus, as a result, I spent my first night in the hospital watching Shank and Genetic Chile [below]. (The next day, I got my laptop back, and I'll tell you, I have never been so happy to see a fifteen-inch screen in my life.) None of which has more than the vaguest thing to do with Shank, other than that I was watching it on a painfully small screen and thus cannot make my usual comments about such things as cinematography, camera placement, and the like. Probably for the best, since that's the day I was introduced to dilaudid, which became my best friend for the next three weeks. How fuzzy was I? I'd actually written down the wrong film (I had Mo Ali's 2010 thriller in this spot instead of Simon Pearce's gay romance; I have never seen the former). Thankfully, I came to my senses, because by all accounts that movie is a dog's dinner. This one, despite a slow and confusing start and maybe a bit too much manufacture drama leading up to the big climax, is pretty good.Plot: Cal (Release's Wayne Virgo) is a gang member who is secretly gay; when he's not running with his buddies and concealing his sexuality from them, he's having a dalliance with an older chap (Judas Ghost's Garry Summers) he met over the Internet. All is well until Cal steps in to stop the boys beating Olivier (Marc Laurent in his only screen appearance to date), a bookish, openly gay exchange student. The two form a friendship that is threatening to become something more&#8212;something that could destroy both sides of Cal's fragile existence.If the plot is somewhat stock (and all of the outcomes of these threads predictable), it helps that Pearce handles his characters with sensitivity and never allows them to become stereotypes (at least, not too much). Writer Darren Flaxstone, turning in his first script, does a pretty credible job at character-building, though he does throw his cast into some situations that, if they happened in real life, you'd be calling patently ridiculous. (I want somehow to tie this to his day job as an editor on nature documentaries, but that would be stretching, even if it would allow me a gratuitous Berberian Sound Studio reference.) Interesting characters in stock situations...well, to be blunt, I wanted to like this a great deal more than I did, but I'm certainly not going to complain about a movie with sympathetic, well-drawn gay protagonists who react to those stock situations in believable ways. ** ",3,One blunt thrust.,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,3630,"['Shank', 'Simon', 'Pearce', '2009', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'Shank', 'was', 'looking', 'copy', 'Shanks', 'infamous', '1974', 'William', 'Castle', 'film', 'starring', 'Marcel', 'Marceau', 'Which', 'did', 'eventually', 'find', 'viz', 'review', '2Mar2013', 'one', 'looked', 'interesting', 'threw', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'where', 'joined', 'almost', 'four', 'hundred', 'other', 'titles', 'promptly', 'forgot', 'Fast-forward', 'year', 'more', 'various', 'reasons', 'wound', 'up', 'stuck', 'hospital', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'been', 'overnight', 'hospital', 'where', 'was', 'patient', 'thirty', 'years', 'Things', 'have', 'changed', 'had', 'clear', 'friggin', 'laptop', 'electrical', 'department', 'pete', 'sake', 'first', 'night', 'stuck', 'godawful', 'roommate', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'insufferable', 'eighteen', 'hours', 'was', 'stuck', 'room', 'complaining', 'mile', 'minute', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'kid', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'sleep', 'only', 'way', 'had', 'watch', 'anything', 'other', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'swore', 'off', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'phone', 'ESPN3', 'was', ""n't"", 'showing', 'cricket', 'night', 'popped', 'open', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'spun', 'scrollbar', 'then', 'stabbed', 'moving', 'queue', 'pick', 'something', 'close', 'random', 'could', 'thus', 'result', 'spent', 'first', 'night', 'hospital', 'watching', 'Shank', 'Genetic', 'Chile', '[', ']', 'next', 'day', 'got', 'laptop', 'back', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'fifteen-inch', 'screen', 'life', 'None', 'more', 'vaguest', 'thing', 'do', 'Shank', 'other', 'was', 'watching', 'painfully', 'small', 'screen', 'thus', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'usual', 'comments', 'such', 'things', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'placement', 'like', 'Probably', 'best', 'day', 'was', 'introduced', 'dilaudid', 'became', 'best', 'friend', 'next', 'three', 'weeks', 'How', 'fuzzy', 'was', ""'d"", 'actually', 'written', 'down', 'wrong', 'film', 'had', 'Mo', 'Ali', '2010', 'thriller', 'spot', 'instead', 'Simon', 'Pearce', 'gay', 'romance', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'former', 'Thankfully', 'came', 'senses', 'accounts', 'movie', 'dog', 'dinner', 'one', 'slow', 'confusing', 'start', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'manufacture', 'drama', 'leading', 'up', 'big', 'climax', 'pretty', 'good.Plot', 'Cal', 'Release', 'Wayne', 'Virgo', 'gang', 'member', 'who', 'secretly', 'gay', 'when', 'not', 'running', 'buddies', 'concealing', 'sexuality', 'having', 'dalliance', 'older', 'chap', 'Judas', 'Ghost', 'Garry', 'Summers', 'met', 'Internet', 'well', 'Cal', 'steps', 'stop', 'boys', 'beating', 'Olivier', 'Marc', 'Laurent', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'date', 'bookish', 'openly', 'gay', 'exchange', 'student', 'two', 'form', 'friendship', 'threatening', 'become', 'something', 'more', '8212', 'something', 'could', 'destroy', 'sides', 'Cal', 'fragile', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'stock', 'outcomes', 'threads', 'predictable', 'Pearce', 'characters', 'sensitivity', 'never', 'become', 'stereotypes', 'least', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Writer', 'Darren', 'Flaxstone', 'turning', 'first', 'script', 'pretty', 'credible', 'job', 'character-building', 'throw', 'cast', 'situations', 'happened', 'real', 'life', ""'d"", 'be', 'calling', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'want', 'somehow', 'tie', 'day', 'job', 'editor', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'would', 'be', 'stretching', 'even', 'would', 'allow', 'gratuitous', 'Berberian', 'Sound', 'Studio', 'reference', 'Interesting', 'characters', 'stock', 'situations', 'well', 'be', 'blunt', 'wanted', 'like', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'did', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'complain', 'movie', 'sympathetic', 'well-drawn', 'gay', 'protagonists', 'who', 'react', 'stock', 'situations', 'believable', 'ways', '**']",N/A
