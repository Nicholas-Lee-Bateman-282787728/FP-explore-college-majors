478119,A1W4TAX70B3FQ0,6305787832,A. Davis,"[0, 0]","With a title like ""REVENGE of the Twister"" one would expect this movie to be made in the 1950s along with other such films like The Monolith Monsters or It Conquered the World. And it really does fit the genre of B movie sci-fi. Zero production value, over the top acting, a pitiful attempt to have a character driven story, and a monster not seen until the very end because they couldn't afford the effects to show it. It's all here. Personally I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons. The movie is really quite silly to watch for it's ineptitude. Watch for James MacArthur (Danno from Hawaii Five 0) in his last and likely worst performance. And keep an ear open for silly self contradictory science.Recommended for MiSTies and B movie fans.",3,Must Be Taken at Face Value,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,742,"['title', 'REVENGE', 'Twister', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'made', '1950s', 'other', 'such', 'films', 'Monolith', 'Monsters', 'Conquered', 'World', 'really', 'fit', 'genre', 'B', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'Zero', 'production', 'value', 'top', 'acting', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'have', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'monster', 'not', 'seen', 'very', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'effects', 'show', 'here', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'movie', 'really', 'quite', 'silly', 'watch', 'ineptitude', 'Watch', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'Danno', 'Hawaii', 'Five', '0', 'last', 'likely', 'worst', 'performance', 'keep', 'ear', 'open', 'silly', 'self', 'contradictory', 'science.Recommended', 'MiSTies', 'B', 'movie', 'fans']",N/A

When Colorado experiences a tornado in an area where they do not normally occur, she is sent in to investigate.  Jamie works very closely with FEMA coordinator Will Stanton played by Wolf Larson.  As Will and Jamie work closely together, the two are very drawn to each other.  When they discover a facility doing illegal experiments that involve clear-cutting the nearby forests, they may have to forfeit their lives to prove it.I didn't think this movie was as bad as other reviewers.  You have to keep in mind that this is a made for TV movie, and not a blockbuster studio movie like Twister.  Of course the special effects are not going to be done up to standards of a Hollywood production.

It was after all a made for TV movie and budgets are lots lower then the theater blockbusters.The best part to me was seeing JAMES MAC ARTHUR.  Not only from 'Book 'Em' Danno fame, but from all of his wonderful Disney and young adult films of my youth.  I've always loved him and it was so great to see him on the screen again.  Hawaii 5-0 was too long ago.
