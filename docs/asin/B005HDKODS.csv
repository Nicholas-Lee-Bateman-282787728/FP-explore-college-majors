It's got some awesome humor in it and it also touches base on some very interesting points.  Jack Lord has been a fan of ours since we first started watching Hawaii 5-0 (the 70s TV series).  Watching him in here isn't much different, except he's riding a lot more and it's different scenery.  If you like watching old westerns, you'll love this series, too.  The only thing that I don't like, is that it didn't last for more seasons. Otherwise, I love it.",5,Why I like this TV series,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,554,"['got', 'Mom', 'birthday', 'just', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'got', 'awesome', 'humor', 'also', 'base', 'very', 'interesting', 'points', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'been', 'fan', 'ours', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'Hawaii', '5-0', '70s', 'TV', 'series', 'Watching', 'here', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'riding', 'lot', 'more', 'different', 'scenery', 'like', 'watching', 'old', 'westerns', ""'ll"", 'love', 'series', 'too', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'more', 'seasons', 'Otherwise', 'love']",Stoney Burke-TV Series-3 DVD Set-15 Episodes-Starring Jack Lord

1460937,A2K1UCFSVKCMIH,B005HDKODS,"Independent Voter ""Jack""","[14, 15]","This series is among the very best ever and has never gotten its proper acclaim.  It was well written, well casted, well acted, and had a great musical score.  It had expert consultation on the rodeo business and was therefore realistic.Individual episodes stand alone, but there was the underlying theme of Stoney's quest for The Gold Buckle (Saddle Bronc Champion) throughout the one-season run.  As the series wound down, he did not get the buckle and it left you hanging for the next season, which never happened.Part of the lack of recognition for this series (and probably the main reason for it) is that it is repeatedly mislabeled as a western.  What a bunch of bull!  It was a modern-day drama that happened to be set to the backdrop of the rodeo circuit.  It was not a western.This box set does not comprise quite half of the series.  I wish I could get my hands on the whole series.  There were thirty-some episodes.  Why don't the DVD producers focus on getting this series out, rather than the garbage they now peddle?",5,One of the five best TV series of all time,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,1031,"['series', 'very', 'best', 'ever', 'never', 'gotten', 'proper', 'acclaim', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'casted', 'well', 'acted', 'had', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'had', 'expert', 'consultation', 'rodeo', 'business', 'was', 'therefore', 'realistic.Individual', 'episodes', 'stand', 'alone', 'there', 'was', 'underlying', 'theme', 'Stoney', 'quest', 'Gold', 'Buckle', 'Saddle', 'Bronc', 'Champion', 'one-season', 'run', 'series', 'wound', 'down', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'buckle', 'left', 'hanging', 'next', 'season', 'never', 'happened.Part', 'lack', 'recognition', 'series', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'repeatedly', 'mislabeled', 'western', 'What', 'bunch', 'bull', 'was', 'modern-day', 'drama', 'happened', 'be', 'set', 'backdrop', 'rodeo', 'circuit', 'was', 'not', 'western.This', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'comprise', 'quite', 'half', 'series', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'whole', 'series', 'were', 'thirty-some', 'episodes', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'producers', 'focus', 'getting', 'series', 'out', 'rather', 'garbage', 'now', 'peddle']",Stoney Burke-TV Series-3 DVD Set-15 Episodes-Starring Jack Lord
1460938,A10AVEAVBRW2LJ,B005HDKODS,"J.Cooper ""JC""","[0, 0]","One of my early favorite TV shows and  difficult to find is STONEY BURKE. I was surprised  to find it at Amazon, and no where  else. The black and white episodes  were  always sharp and fast moving. Sure, you had to have a hero that would show up like Superman, yet here you had a Rodeo group of regular cowboy good guys that handled  events on and off the rodeo circuit. Jack Lord went on to make  another great TV  series, but this early one I say..was his best. It also had true rodeo stars in character parts. Too bad we can't find all of the episodes.",5,Difficult to find STONEY BURKE TV Episodes...,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,556,"['One', 'early', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'difficult', 'find', 'STONEY', 'BURKE', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'Amazon', 'where', 'else', 'black', 'white', 'episodes', 'were', 'always', 'sharp', 'fast', 'moving', 'Sure', 'had', 'have', 'hero', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'Superman', 'yet', 'here', 'had', 'Rodeo', 'group', 'regular', 'cowboy', 'good', 'guys', 'handled', 'events', 'rodeo', 'circuit', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'went', 'make', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'early', 'one', 'say..was', 'best', 'also', 'had', 'true', 'rodeo', 'stars', 'character', 'parts', 'Too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'episodes']",Stoney Burke-TV Series-3 DVD Set-15 Episodes-Starring Jack Lord
1460939,A1N9S9ZQP79WXA,B005HDKODS,"Roberta Klimovich ""Fan of Truth""","[0, 0]","I remember this series from back in the day and recall thinking Jack Lord was more than attractive.  In fact, I thought he was kinda cute!!!  This series was my first and only exposure to rodeo and rodeo riders.  The stories are more than good, they are believable and make you wish there were more people in the world like Stoney and his down home friends who stick up for each other and for people who wander thorugh their lives.Too bad Stoney never got the gold buckle as champion bronc rider, which was his goal.The quality of the films themselves leaves something to be desired but you are warned about that at the beginning so, should be no real problem there.  The acting is pretty good considering a lot of the characters are near the beginning of their careers and still honing their craft. The scripts can seem a little stilted and stiff, but this was a different time and there were more checks in place.This was a good launching pad for Jack Lord who, after this series, found his place on Hawaii Five-0 where the rest is history.No sex, no graphic violence (a few fist fights but no gunfire), no drug use (though there is some beer drinking but not by Stoney).  Takes you back to a more innocent time.  My bottom line advice, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",5,Ride 'Em Cowboy!!!,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1272,"['remember', 'series', 'back', 'day', 'recall', 'thinking', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'more', 'attractive', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'kinda', 'cute', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'exposure', 'rodeo', 'rodeo', 'riders', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'good', 'are', 'believable', 'make', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'people', 'world', 'Stoney', 'down', 'home', 'friends', 'who', 'stick', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'wander', 'lives.Too', 'bad', 'Stoney', 'never', 'got', 'gold', 'buckle', 'champion', 'bronc', 'rider', 'was', 'goal.The', 'quality', 'films', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'are', 'warned', 'beginning', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'problem', 'there', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'lot', 'characters', 'are', 'beginning', 'careers', 'still', 'honing', 'craft', 'scripts', 'can', 'seem', 'little', 'stilted', 'stiff', 'was', 'different', 'time', 'were', 'more', 'checks', 'place.This', 'was', 'good', 'launching', 'pad', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'who', 'series', 'found', 'place', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'where', 'rest', 'history.No', 'sex', 'graphic', 'violence', 'few', 'fist', 'fights', 'gunfire', 'drug', 'use', 'beer', 'drinking', 'not', 'Stoney', 'Takes', 'back', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'bottom', 'line', 'advice', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Stoney Burke-TV Series-3 DVD Set-15 Episodes-Starring Jack Lord
