Pretty poorly. There's zero extras (some of their Presley releases don't even include the trailers) and, worst of all, many of them don't even have chapter access to the SONGS. Like this one.

I have to disagree with the reviewer who thinks the songs were forgettable.  I found them quite memorable and witty.  Example: Poison Ivy League, boys in that Ivy League, give me an itch -- those ""sons of the rich.""  Granted, the song needs to be understood within the context of the movie, but for a 1964 Elvis film that's rather tongue in cheek!  Roustabout -- ""I'm just a Roustabout, drifting from town to town, no job can hold me down...""  It's a great number that really introduces us to Elvis' free-wheeling character (a set up for the movie plot)  And of course who can forget ""Little Eva.""  Little Eva came out struttin wearin nuttin but a button and bow... It's an early popular 50s tune that meshed within the Carny atmosphere of the film.  And even It's Carnival Time although very simplistic is a catchy little tune.  Stanwyck is great and so is Leif Ericson, playing a doubting dolting father-type, although I just don't know how Elvis can punch him out one minute and then suddenly they're pals the next (but that's formula).

The story:Elvis plays Charlie Rogers, a brooding loner (you can tell by his semi-comatose expression) eking out a living doing a bad impression of, well, himself at a dive called Mother's Tea House. (Look fast for Raquel Welch at one of the tables.) One night, he unwisely taunts some middle-aged college boys with a witty ditty called ""Poison Ivy League,"" gets in a fight, loses his job and sputters off on his dinky motorbike. Happening upon a jeep, Charlie is run off the road by short-fused carny Joe Lean (Leif Erickson) for flirting with his virginal daughter Cathy (Joan Freeman, who, tellingly, later became a nun). Unhurt, Charlie signs on as a roustabout in their two-bit carnival, run by Barbara Stanwyck as Maggie Morgan, a woman of backbone and bite (sorry, wrong show), until his bike can be repaired. Maggie recognizes Charlie's teen appeal after his impromptu performance of ""It's Carnival Time"" causes a sensation on the midway. Soon Charlie is packin' 'em in, and the carnival begins to turn a profit. On top of the world, Charlie steps up his romancing of Cathy while fending off the advances of an amorous fortune teller (the usually fetching Sue Ane Langdon in a hideous black wig) until a fracas with a boorish customer causes him to get ants in his pants again. His cycle fixed, Charlie dons his outrageously tacky, must-be-compensating-for-something, foot-wide studded-leather belt and accepts the generous offer of the owner (Pat Buttram, the immortal flimflam man Mr. Haney from TV's ""Green Acres"") of a big-time rival carnival. In the flick's most excruciating sequence, Charlie sings ""Little Egypt"" to a bevy of skanky exotic dancers (one of whom might be Teri Garr). Meanwhile, with Charlie no longer there to pull in the crowds, Maggie's carnival is about to go belly up, and it's up to Cathy to lure him back. She does, of course. Charlie collects his loot from Mr. Haney and returns to Maggie's show just in time to pay off her creditors. Suddenly everybody loves Charlie, his macho belt and his money, even Joe, who forgets all about protecting his daughter's chastity and his former habit of beating the stuffing out of Charlie for no good reason.

430724,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6304673078,Kevin Killian,"[9, 10]","John Rich later became a TV titan and directed many of the best episodes of the best TV series, as well as taking a hand at production.  But his feature film career is even more interesting.  Like many journeyman directors, he was assigned a brace of Elvis pictures--this one and the later, hippie-themed EASY COME, EASY GO.  But he was also responsible for some of the most under-rated programmers of the 1960s, including THE NEW INTERNS and BOEING BOEING--and WIVES AND LOVERS as well.  In ROUSTABOUT he demonstrates a flair for working with actors of all stripes, from the legendary Golden Age star represented here by Barbara Stanwyck, to the neophyte starlet--in ROUSTABOUT there are plenty of them, and the most sparkling is a very young Raquel Welch, who makes her film debut in the opening scene as a college coed mesmerized by Elvis' singing.  Raquel looks great and seems quite believable.  It's no wonder her fi;lm career soared after making this film.  As Elvis' leading lady, Joan Freeman is pretty good, and for this we can thank John Rich, he brings out colors in her otherwise cut and paste performance that we would not see again in Ms. Freeman's acting until her amusing later turn as ""Ellie Jackson"" in the Don Knotts goof-fest THE RELUCTANT ASTRONAUT.As for Barbara Stanwyck, what can you say?  She's great in the part and, even though at the time people say she was slumming by taking a supporting role in an Elvis picture, in hindsight she was pretty wise, for she was able to keep her name above the title and in Hollywood, that's all that matters.  She was one star who was able to keep working until the day she died.  As Maggie in ROUSTABOUT she adds new luster to the word, ""Termagant.""  She's bitter, she's fiery, she's curt, she's passionate and she's salty.  She's seen it all and laid down the law to bigger men than Elvis.  And yet at the end of the day, when all is said and done, she needs him to maintain her autonomy over her grand little carnival.  The two of them strike sparks together and their scenes have some of the resonance, at any rate, that Elvis brought to scenes with older women who reminded him of Gladys, his own late mother whom he adored.",5,One of John Rich's Best Films,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2192,"['John', 'Rich', 'later', 'became', 'TV', 'titan', 'directed', 'many', 'best', 'episodes', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'taking', 'hand', 'production', 'feature', 'film', 'career', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'many', 'journeyman', 'directors', 'was', 'assigned', 'brace', 'Elvis', 'pictures', 'one', 'later', 'hippie-themed', 'EASY', 'COME', 'EASY', 'GO', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'most', 'under-rated', 'programmers', '1960s', 'including', 'THE', 'NEW', 'INTERNS', 'BOEING', 'BOEING', 'WIVES', 'AND', 'LOVERS', 'as', 'well', 'ROUSTABOUT', 'flair', 'working', 'actors', 'stripes', 'legendary', 'Golden', 'Age', 'star', 'represented', 'here', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'neophyte', 'starlet', 'ROUSTABOUT', 'are', 'plenty', 'most', 'sparkling', 'very', 'young', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'who', 'film', 'debut', 'opening', 'scene', 'college', 'coed', 'mesmerized', 'Elvis', 'singing', 'Raquel', 'great', 'quite', 'believable', 'wonder', 'fi', 'career', 'soared', 'making', 'film', 'Elvis', 'leading', 'lady', 'Joan', 'Freeman', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'thank', 'John', 'Rich', 'out', 'colors', 'otherwise', 'cut', 'paste', 'performance', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'again', 'Ms.', 'Freeman', 'acting', 'amusing', 'later', 'turn', 'Ellie', 'Jackson', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'goof-fest', 'THE', 'RELUCTANT', 'ASTRONAUT.As', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'great', 'part', 'even', 'time', 'people', 'say', 'was', 'slumming', 'taking', 'supporting', 'role', 'Elvis', 'picture', 'hindsight', 'was', 'pretty', 'wise', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'name', 'title', 'Hollywood', 'matters', 'was', 'one', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'working', 'day', 'died', 'Maggie', 'ROUSTABOUT', 'new', 'luster', 'word', 'Termagant', 'bitter', 'fiery', 'curt', 'passionate', 'salty', 'seen', 'laid', 'down', 'law', 'bigger', 'men', 'Elvis', 'yet', 'end', 'day', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'maintain', 'autonomy', 'grand', 'little', 'carnival', 'two', 'strike', 'together', 'scenes', 'have', 'resonance', 'rate', 'Elvis', 'brought', 'scenes', 'older', 'women', 'who', 'reminded', 'Gladys', 'own', 'late', 'mother', 'whom', 'adored']",Roustabout VHS

It is reported he worked hard on this film to live up to Ms. Stanwyke's professional standards.Unfortunately, the scriptwriters were less demanding of themselves, and the film suffers from banal dialogue and predictable plotting. Elvis stars as Charlie Rogers, a drifter  with a chip on his shoulder who lands a job as a roustabout (handyman) with a down-and-out carnival operated by strong-willed Maggie Morgan, played by Stanwyke. When Charlie breaks into song on the midway one day, throngs of young people flock to hear him sing (which may be believable were they all penned by Lieber & Stoller). As news of his talent spreads, Maggie's carnival begins to turn a tidy profit. Charlie's good fortune continues as Cathy, a young and pretty carnival worker played by Joan Freeman, takes a romantic interest in him. However, after a misunderstanding involving a customer's missing wallet, Maggie and Cathy chide Charlie for his selfish attitudes. The embittered young Charlie quits Maggie's outfit to work for a rival carnival. When Maggie's carnival starts to go under, Charlie returns with enough money to ward off the creditors.

What I base my 4 & 1/2 stars on is the ""likeability"" factor. You and I both know that people who are not fans of Elvis would probably never watch or buy this film (or any of Elvis' movies for that matter). Therefore, most of the people who would potentially buy this film are either casual fans or die-hard fans of Elvis. Let's face it, this movie, (and all the Elvis movies) were made for and all about Elvis. That was the whole point! When watching this movie it is almost like watching a long music video of Elvis. Sure, there is some dialogue, and there is a bit of a story line, but the real point about watching this movie is to see the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley.I have many of the movies that Elvis made and I enjoy them all. I do however, take the story lines with a grain of salt. So long a one realizes that these movies were never meant to be on the same caliber as let's say, Casablanca, then the viewer can enjoy the film exactly for what it is and was meant to be... entertainment. Afterall, Elvis was a consummate entertainer. That is what he did on stage and that is what he did here in this film.

By 1964, Elvis was getting too old to be convincing as an ""angry young man,"" but he gave it his best shot. Elvis is the motorbike-riding rebel whose singing peps up business at a struggling carnival. Elvis clashes with the hard-drinking ramrod, Joe (Leif Erickson). Joan Freeman and Elvis moon around each other, but find romance a rocky road. Movie veteran Barbara Stanwyck lends stature to the film as the carnival owner. The song writing teams of Giant-Baum-Kaye and Leiber-Stoller wrote some of the music, but the results are only mixed. On the plus side, the ballad ""Big Love, Big Heartache"" and the comic ""Little Egypt"" number are worth the effort of viewing. The other music is less memorable. One amusing footnote is Pat Buttram as a rival carnival owner. This was shortly before he enjoyed popular recogniton as Mr. Haney on TV's ""Green Acres."" Given the movie's emphasis on the social mores of carnival folks, we wonder if Col. Tom Parker was in hog heaven, considering his carny background. The movie offers good Hal Wallis production values. Wallis once asserted he made flicks like this one to raise money for serious films like ""Becket."" He considered Elvis trivial but profitable. Elvis fans will be pleased with this movie, regardless.
