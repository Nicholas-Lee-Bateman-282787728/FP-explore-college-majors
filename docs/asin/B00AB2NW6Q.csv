Like others in the Fox Cinema Archives collection; it's strictly bare bones - no photos, no chapter index, no extras of any kind.The storyline of the film is pretty uneven and it has an odd, almost shorten ending. This is probably due to the original director (Ernst Lubitsch) dying during the production and another director (Otto Preminger) assigned to complete it. According to Turner Classic Movies, whole scenes were cut and whole scenes were added in order to even get the film remotely completed.There's not a heck of a lot of chemistry between Betty and her co-star, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. but I like the songs and Betty is radiant throughout.

1607540,A370TLAS04Q49K,B00AB2NW6Q,"Richard Dodge ""South San Diego Senior""","[2, 2]","After World War II ended,,,,20th Century Fox began trying to change Betty Grable into a post war commodity.  So: there are THREE films that break with GRABLE tradition ""The Shocking Miss Pilgrim""...""That Lady in Ermine"" and ""The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend"".  ""That Lady in Ermine"" is a fantasy...and Betty is a strawberry blonde in immaculate period costumes.  This film had its share of bad luck.  The most serious was the untimely death of the original director (Ernst Lubitsch).  Some unkind people said that working with Betty had killed him.  One wonders what would have happened if he had needed towork with Marilyn.  All that to one side, Betty is lovely, the costumes and sets are opulent and the film is worth having because it is lovely and the cast is charming...and it certainly does not fit the usual Grable mold.  I keep hoping for a Blu Ray package that would contain: ""Mother Wore Tights"", The Shocking Miss Pilgrim"", ""That Lady in Ermine"", Wabash Avenue"" and,,,""Meet Me After the Show""....well, I can dream.

1607541,A2TO31D8XDFPZR,B00AB2NW6Q,Roger Blunck,"[6, 6]","""That Lady in Ermine"" should have been a huge hit but had too many things against it.  Betty Grable fought against making it but with the big success of ""Mother Wore Tights"" studio chief Darryl F.Zanuck pushed her into it hoping to create a different setting for their top box-office star.  Grable gave it her all and got along very well with director Ernst Lubitsch who thought she had great beauty and comedy timing.  Shortly into production Mr. Lubitsch died leaving Betty confused and insecure.  Her leading man couldn't sing or dance and director Otto Preminger (a difficult, demanding man) took over.Betty looks great and delivers her usual professional performance. Originally eight songs were written but cut to four.  The songs are fun (particularly ""Oooo What I'll Do"" while the ballad ""This Is the Moment"" earned an Oscar nomination).  But without the other four the film is too talky.  It needs more music and only comes to life when Betty sings and dances.  Her costumes are beautiful and how could there ever be too many songs in a Betty Grable musical?  If Lubitsch had lived and the picture had been completed, as originally planned, it could have been a true gem. Sadly, we'll never know.  ""That Lady in Ermine"" wasn't a complete disaster at the box office but disappointed Betty and 20th's head office.  Her next film ""When My Baby Smiles at Me"" was rushed into production and reunited her with Dan Dailey whose star was rising and earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination.  For Betty Grable fans ""That Lady in Ermine"" is worth having simply because she is so special and a unique star.

I recently rewatched it and was disappointed.  Betty Grable is as gorgeous as ever and does a good job with what she has to work with but the story is silly and the movie drags.  Betty, in a dual role as Angelina, ruling countess of an Italian principality, and her ancestor Francesca, struggles to save her country from a Hungarian invasion.  In the process the ghost of Francesca makes the Hungarian leader fall in love with her and, by association, with Angelina.  There is the typical Hollywood happy ending even though it defies all logic.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 2]","Ernest Lubitsch's operatic comedy, ""That Lady in Ermine"" (known as ""This is the Moment"" throughout much of its making owing its climatic song) was his last.  He died of a heart attack and Otto Preminger took over, which according to its stars and cast, took all the fun out of it and Betty Grable said he was ""heavy-handed.""  Her co-star, the famous Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. had some problems with Otto, and Otto ""finished the picture"" after re-filming much of what Lubitsch had done and some of the musical numbers were excised upon decision by Daryl F. Zanuck in a way Lubitsch would never have done.  Preminger had already taken over for Lubitsch before (""A Royal Scandal"" starring Tallulah Bankhead) with more control and it was more successful than that ""That Lady in Ermine"" would eventually be.  (Preminger, present when Lubitsch had his fatal heart attack may have possibly been requested by Lubitsch to finish the film).  Fairbanks and co-star, the wonderful Walter Abel, agree the finished film is a ""split film.""  But even without this much-needed focus, the film is still quite successful and entertaining.  The fact that it toys with adultery so frivolously had it called into question by the censors and was kept an eye on.  Grable and Fairbanks are wonderful together, although Grable may have been out of her element here, but Fairbanks looks a little grizzled in some scenes, but can still be quite charming, and they are great together. Abel, again, is wonderful.  Cesar Romero is rather hammy, as usual.  I wonder what the result would have been if Zanuck would have stayed out of the editing room.  Even though the film never quite gels into something that makes it superior entertainment, it is a bizarre romantic fantasy in splendid color by Technicolor which is a real treat to watch and, it is enjoyable.  Some see the seeds of Otto's later comedy ""Skidoo"" begun in this film.  The film is definitely too Lubitsch-y for me to readily see that influence (screenplay by Samson Raphaelson), and Otto's work is ultimately uncredited. Even though this is Otto's least successful film in terms of the whole thing working, I still loved it.  The 20th Century-Fox Cinema Archives which is their MOD outlet has produced a lot of sound distortion in some reels while things are otherwise quiet.  They do not stand up very well to the Warner Archive's superior re-mastering, etc. and effort that goes into their equally pricey catalog.",5,Just Never Arrives Totally,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2446,"['Ernest', 'Lubitsch', 'operatic', 'comedy', 'Lady', 'Ermine', 'known', 'Moment', 'much', 'making', 'owing', 'climatic', 'song', 'was', 'last', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'took', 'over', 'according', 'stars', 'cast', 'took', 'fun', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'said', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'co-star', 'famous', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', 'had', 'problems', 'Otto', 'Otto', 'finished', 'picture', 're-filming', 'much', 'what', 'Lubitsch', 'had', 'done', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'excised', 'decision', 'Daryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'way', 'Lubitsch', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'done', 'Preminger', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'over', 'Lubitsch', 'Royal', 'Scandal', 'starring', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'more', 'control', 'was', 'more', 'successful', 'Lady', 'Ermine', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'Preminger', 'present', 'when', 'Lubitsch', 'had', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'may', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'requested', 'Lubitsch', 'finish', 'film', 'Fairbanks', 'co-star', 'wonderful', 'Walter', 'Abel', 'agree', 'finished', 'film', 'split', 'film', 'even', 'much-needed', 'focus', 'film', 'still', 'quite', 'successful', 'entertaining', 'fact', 'adultery', 'so', 'frivolously', 'had', 'called', 'question', 'censors', 'was', 'kept', 'eye', 'Grable', 'Fairbanks', 'are', 'wonderful', 'together', 'Grable', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'element', 'here', 'Fairbanks', 'little', 'grizzled', 'scenes', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'quite', 'charming', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'Abel', 'again', 'wonderful', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'rather', 'hammy', 'usual', 'wonder', 'what', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Zanuck', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'editing', 'room', 'Even', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'gels', 'something', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'bizarre', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'splendid', 'color', 'Technicolor', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'seeds', 'Otto', 'later', 'comedy', 'Skidoo', 'begun', 'film', 'film', 'definitely', 'too', 'Lubitsch-y', 'readily', 'see', 'influence', 'screenplay', 'Samson', 'Raphaelson', 'Otto', 'work', 'ultimately', 'uncredited', 'Even', 'Otto', 'least', 'successful', 'film', 'terms', 'whole', 'thing', 'working', 'still', 'loved', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'Cinema', 'Archives', 'MOD', 'outlet', 'produced', 'lot', 'sound', 'distortion', 'reels', 'things', 'are', 'otherwise', 'quiet', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'superior', 're-mastering', 'etc', 'effort', 'equally', 'pricey', 'catalog']",N/A
