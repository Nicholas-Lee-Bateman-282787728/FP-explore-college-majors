192621,A13PD81EKUMR7A,1581983107,Harry,"[38, 40]","I strongly reccomend this DVD for those who are just starting to learn French. This DVD covers the very basics that will be needed to understand anything French. It introduces the viewer to understanding that a verb in French (like &quot;go&quot; in english, &quot;aller&quot; in French) is different based on who is doing the action. If I &quot;go&quot;, then &quot;go&quot; is written &quot;vais&quot;; if we &quot;go&quot;, then it is written &quot;allons&quot; and pronounced differently. I found this element of learning French painful at the start, that instead of learning one word for &quot;go&quot; I had to learn six. But once I became accostumed to it, learning became much easier. You can also expect to learn a little about numbers and colors, and a few verbs and nouns.This DVD in no way will leave you knowing enough French to go and speak it. This DVD, and part II, leaves the student with enough basic information so that learning will become much easier. For example, I used the TV series &quot;French in Action&quot;. At the start of my studies with lessons 1-6, I had a great deal of trouble understanding what was going on. After watching the Standard Deviants DVD it became much easeir.One more thing about this DVD. It was entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I did not feel like I was working to learn, rather I felt more like I was watching a show and everything was sticking, that I was remembering what they taught. I highly recommend this for the absolute begenner.",5,Great for those who know zero french,1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,1493,"['strongly', 'reccomend', 'DVD', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'learn', 'French', 'DVD', 'very', 'basics', 'will', 'be', 'needed', 'understand', 'anything', 'French', 'viewer', 'understanding', 'verb', 'French', 'quot', 'go', 'quot', 'english', 'quot', 'quot', 'French', 'different', 'based', 'who', 'doing', 'action', 'quot', 'go', 'quot', 'then', 'quot', 'go', 'quot', 'written', 'quot', 'vais', 'quot', 'quot', 'go', 'quot', 'then', 'written', 'quot', 'allons', 'quot', 'pronounced', 'differently', 'found', 'element', 'learning', 'French', 'painful', 'start', 'instead', 'learning', 'one', 'word', 'quot', 'go', 'quot', 'had', 'learn', 'six', 'once', 'became', 'accostumed', 'learning', 'became', 'much', 'easier', 'can', 'also', 'expect', 'learn', 'little', 'numbers', 'colors', 'few', 'verbs', 'nouns.This', 'DVD', 'way', 'will', 'leave', 'knowing', 'enough', 'French', 'go', 'speak', 'DVD', 'part', 'II', 'student', 'enough', 'basic', 'information', 'learning', 'will', 'become', 'much', 'easier', 'example', 'used', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'French', 'Action', 'quot', 'start', 'studies', 'lessons', '1-6', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'watching', 'Standard', 'Deviants', 'DVD', 'became', 'much', 'easeir.One', 'more', 'thing', 'DVD', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'working', 'learn', 'rather', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'watching', 'show', 'everything', 'was', 'sticking', 'was', 'remembering', 'what', 'taught', 'highly', 'recommend', 'absolute', 'begenner']",N/A
192622,A33H4BO4S3TA4I,1581983107,"J. Gordon ""casual gamer""","[18, 24]","I don't know how this video got any good reviews (they're probably from someone over at ""standard deviants"").  This video is absolutely horrible.  The video's entire emphasis is on presentation.  They try to make it ""interesting"" or ""entertaining"" or whatever, but it's actually so distracting that it's annoying to watch.  They jump around about every 3 to 5 seconds to present every single little item with a different person, background, visual, etc.  It is so distracting that I think it screwed up any concept of French I already had.  If you don't know any French than this video will just give you a headache.  I don't write many reviews, but I felt like it was my civic duty to warn people out there not to buy this stupid video.  I checked it out from the public library, and boy am I glad that I didn't pay any money for this piece of crap.  This is so bad, you'll feel like you just lost an hour of your time that you'll never get back after you watch it.
