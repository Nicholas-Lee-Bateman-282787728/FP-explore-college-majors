211007,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,6300214117,A Customer,"[1, 4]","Summary:The movie is essentially about the relationship between a mother and her daughter but almost comes across as two separate movies because it follows the two women separately for a large part of the movie and then brings them back together at times.Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) is Emma Greenway Horton's mother (Debra Winger).  Aurora is over-protective and controlling, but Emma eventually finds her way out of her mother's home when she marries Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels).  Emma and Flap move away from Aurora so Flap can pursue his career as a professor.  Emma, meanwhile, is a stay at home mother and has three kids.  While Flap and Emma are away, Aurora, who has constantly had suitors visiting her, finally decides she is going to develop a relationship with her neighbor, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), who is a former astronaut and is now a drink-crazed womanizer.  As it turns out, Garrett is just the person Aurora needs to come out of her shell and their relationship turns into something more than is expected at the beginning.While Aurora is finding someone to love, Emma and Flap are doing the same - they just aren't doing it with each other.  Both end up having affairs (at least, so we think).  After discovering that Flap is becoming involved with a woman, Emma goes to the doctor for a flu shot for her and her daughter and finds out that she has cancer.Emma ends up dying, Flap goes off with the other woman, and the three kids end up with Aurora back in Texas who is continuing to develop her relationship with the slightly calmed Garrett.My Comments:The movie kept my attention throughout though it isn't particularly exciting (except when Garrett is around).  What makes the movie so interesting is the characters - which should make most movies interesting.  After watching it with some friends, I asked them what they thought and one of them said that they were all really screwed up people.  I couldn't help but think that they probably were no more screwed up in their own way than most other people are.  I think we are all strange and weird in our own ways.  And, even though the characters in this movie might be a bit more extreme than some people, they are still people just trying to find people that love them.The acting was great throughout - with the exception of some of the child actors and Emma.  I think I would have given it a higher rating if I had been more convinced by Debra Winger's character.  Perhaps it was the portrayal, or perhaps the portrayal was great and I simply didn't like the character, either way, I think Emma was my least favorite character even though she is the leading character.  The worst part about her was her laugh - it drove me nuts.  But, for some people that is probably be the best part about the movie.Overall, the movie really is very well done.  The story is simple and plausible and entertaining.  It leaves you with the feeling that this really could happen, and, more poignantly, really does happen.  People die, people cheat on their spouses, and people are not always nice.  Life is like that.",4,Very interesting characters.,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,3092,"['Summary', 'movie', 'essentially', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'almost', 'across', 'two', 'separate', 'movies', 'two', 'women', 'separately', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'then', 'back', 'together', 'times.Aurora', 'Greenway', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Emma', 'Greenway', 'Horton', 'mother', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Aurora', 'over-protective', 'controlling', 'Emma', 'eventually', 'way', 'mother', 'home', 'when', 'Flap', 'Horton', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Emma', 'Flap', 'move', 'away', 'Aurora', 'Flap', 'can', 'pursue', 'career', 'professor', 'Emma', 'meanwhile', 'stay', 'home', 'mother', 'three', 'kids', 'Flap', 'Emma', 'are', 'away', 'Aurora', 'who', 'constantly', 'had', 'suitors', 'visiting', 'finally', 'going', 'develop', 'relationship', 'neighbor', 'Garrett', 'Breedlove', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'former', 'astronaut', 'now', 'drink-crazed', 'womanizer', 'out', 'Garrett', 'just', 'person', 'Aurora', 'come', 'shell', 'relationship', 'something', 'more', 'expected', 'beginning.While', 'Aurora', 'finding', 'someone', 'love', 'Emma', 'Flap', 'are', 'doing', 'same', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'affairs', 'least', 'think', 'discovering', 'Flap', 'becoming', 'involved', 'woman', 'Emma', 'doctor', 'flu', 'shot', 'daughter', 'out', 'cancer.Emma', 'up', 'dying', 'Flap', 'other', 'woman', 'three', 'kids', 'end', 'up', 'Aurora', 'back', 'Texas', 'who', 'continuing', 'develop', 'relationship', 'slightly', 'calmed', 'Garrett.My', 'Comments', 'movie', 'kept', 'attention', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'exciting', 'when', 'Garrett', 'around', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'interesting', 'characters', 'should', 'make', 'most', 'movies', 'interesting', 'watching', 'friends', 'asked', 'what', 'thought', 'one', 'said', 'were', 'really', 'screwed', 'up', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'probably', 'were', 'more', 'screwed', 'up', 'own', 'way', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'think', 'are', 'strange', 'weird', 'own', 'ways', 'even', 'characters', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'extreme', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'people', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'people', 'love', 'them.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'exception', 'child', 'actors', 'Emma', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'higher', 'rating', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'convinced', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'portrayal', 'perhaps', 'portrayal', 'was', 'great', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'way', 'think', 'Emma', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'character', 'even', 'leading', 'character', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'laugh', 'drove', 'nuts', 'people', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'really', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'simple', 'plausible', 'entertaining', 'feeling', 'really', 'could', 'happen', 'more', 'poignantly', 'really', 'happen', 'People', 'die', 'people', 'cheat', 'spouses', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'nice', 'Life']",Terms of Endearment VHS

Well, it never did. This, in my mind, is the least deserving Best Picture Oscar winner ever. On display here are gross overacting from Shirley MacLaine and a whiny performance from Debra Winger. My former co-worker once ""termed"" this movie as the one where ""the mother and daughter talk on the phone all the time"". Well, it is.

211011,A1534MBU6VJXYN,6300214117,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[3, 4]","Perhpas the greatest film of the 1980s', James L. Brooks' 1983 masterpiece ""Terms Of Endearment"" (based on the novel by Larry McMurtly) is a powerful, motional and often hilarious story of a mother and a a daughter and the ups and downs in their often sad relation ship. Showered with awards (including an Oscar for best picture), it has not aged a bit since then.Shirley MacLaine won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Aurora Greenway, a middle agd woman dealing with a dull life hampered by a tumultuous relationship with her daughter Emma (Debra Winger). Married to the dull witted Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) and raising three kids, Aurora is dissatisfied with the lifestyle Emma has chosen. She is also unhappy with her own life. She is living alone except for her maid (Betty King), and the only man who seems to be interested in her is a short, semi-unlikable man named Vernon Dahlart (Danny DeVito). However, one man is about to change her life forever. That man is Garret Breedlove (Jack Nicholson, who deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), a carefree, boozing, womanizing former astronaut who adds a sense of la bella vita to Aurora's mundain existence. Meanwhile, Emma has suspected Flap of cheating, and she hooks up with a married banker named Sam Burns (John Lithgow, who wowed me with his performance). Unfortunately, Flap accepting a job in Nebraska ruins their chance of a true relationship. Soon, Aurora realizes that even though Garret has made her happy, she can't be with him. And to make matters worse, Emma has cancer. Everything culminates in a touching, heartwrenching finale (including MacLaine's famous ""give my daughter the shot!"" sequence) that will stay with you forever.This is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. This film set the vanguard for tearjerkers, and with the exception of ""Steel Magnolias"", no film has ever matched this film (not even the 1996 sequel ""The Evening Star""). Truly, this is one film that has earned the title ""must-see"".",5,"""I Don't Know What It Is About You, Aurora, But You Bring Out The Devil In Me""",1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,1999,"['Perhpas', 'greatest', 'film', '1980s', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', '1983', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'based', 'novel', 'Larry', 'McMurtly', 'powerful', 'motional', 'often', 'hilarious', 'story', 'mother', 'daughter', 'ups', 'downs', 'often', 'sad', 'relation', 'ship', 'Showered', 'awards', 'including', 'Oscar', 'best', 'picture', 'not', 'aged', 'bit', 'then.Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'Aurora', 'Greenway', 'middle', 'agd', 'woman', 'dealing', 'dull', 'life', 'hampered', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Married', 'dull', 'witted', 'Flap', 'Horton', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'raising', 'three', 'kids', 'Aurora', 'dissatisfied', 'lifestyle', 'Emma', 'chosen', 'also', 'unhappy', 'own', 'life', 'living', 'alone', 'maid', 'Betty', 'King', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'interested', 'short', 'semi-unlikable', 'man', 'named', 'Vernon', 'Dahlart', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'However', 'one', 'man', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'man', 'Garret', 'Breedlove', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'carefree', 'boozing', 'womanizing', 'former', 'astronaut', 'who', 'sense', 'la', 'bella', 'vita', 'Aurora', 'mundain', 'existence', 'Meanwhile', 'Emma', 'suspected', 'Flap', 'cheating', 'up', 'married', 'banker', 'named', 'Sam', 'Burns', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'who', 'wowed', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'Flap', 'accepting', 'job', 'Nebraska', 'chance', 'true', 'relationship', 'Soon', 'Aurora', 'even', 'Garret', 'made', 'happy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Emma', 'cancer', 'Everything', 'culminates', 'touching', 'heartwrenching', 'finale', 'including', 'MacLaine', 'famous', 'give', 'daughter', 'shot', 'sequence', 'will', 'stay', 'forever.This', 'truly', 'movie', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'film', 'set', 'vanguard', 'tearjerkers', 'exception', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'film', 'ever', 'matched', 'film', 'not', 'even', '1996', 'sequel', 'Evening', 'Star', 'Truly', 'one', 'film', 'earned', 'title', 'must-see']",Terms of Endearment VHS

211015,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,6300214117,Ben Adam,"[3, 5]","Larry McMurty's novel has been adapted to the screen amazingly well; the film won five Academy Awards, including the Best Adapted Screenplay Award, as well as Best Picture, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), Best Director (James Brooks), and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson). The cast includes a wealth of Hollywood celebrities -- Debra Winger, John Lithgow, Jeff Daniels, Danny DeVito -- and the performances are outstanding throughout the film.The story is one of a mother, Aurora Greenway, (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger), and how their relationship develops over the years, from the day that their husband/father dies. Aurora is a woman with more than her share of admirers, whom she takes great delight in keeping at a distance, and who has a rather contentious relationship with her daughter, whose marriage to Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) she opposes to the point that she boycotts the wedding. As it turns out, Mother is right. The marriage between Emma and Flap is less than rosy, with both having their extramarital affairs (although the extramarital affair that Emma has with Sam Burns, played by John Lithgow, comes across as endearing in the film). Almost parallel to the philandering of the daughter comes the pie-eyed former astronaut next door, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), who makes no pretenses about his intentions toward Aurora, and this time Aurora gives in. For the time that the affair lasts, Aurora is very happy. It has its run, then stops, but then starts again. Garrett, as it seems, has a problem with commitment, but he also has a problem with walking out on a good thing, too.Flap comes home one day to break the bad news that the family is moving, thereby ending Emma's affair with Sam but continuing an affair that Flap was having. Emma discovers the affair and is indignant, but by now, Emma is also a mother and dying of a terminal illness. It becomes clear that Flap is not a candidate to care for the children after Emma dies, and Aurora re-enters the picture as the grand matriarch who will take over. When the moment of Emma's death arrives, the shock is still as painful as if nobody had expected it to happen. Garrett resurfaces to comfort the grieving Aurora and her family in a gesture that surprises Aurora greatly.What really makes this film succeed is the vividness of the performances of the actors and actresses. Debra Winger's performance as the daughter who grows through a bad marriage and ultimately dies from cancer is unforgettable. Jack Nicholson's performance, as much as he has played the lecherous male before, takes on a new dimension in this film. Shirley MacLaine's performance earned her an Academy Award; she gives a superb touch in the most unforgettable scene in the film in which she approaches the nurses' station in the hospital at 10pm to tell the nurses to give her daughter her pain shot.

It is so easy to identify with all of these characters, with the entire cast of actors showing up for even the smallest of roles and nailing the part.

Shirley MacLaine finally recieved an Academy Award for her incredible work here showing amazing depth of character development.  Jack is, well, charming as usual; devilish and sly, and has many of the best lines in the film.

Three generations of a family in times of happiness and sadness. Despite this, and despite its length, it is entertaining and attention-holding throughout.

Jack plays his usual character, but as always, he does it so well that you forgive him for it. Shirley wears some truly hideous frocks and has some appalling hairstyles, but her smile manages to shine through all of this towards the end of the film. The strong ensemble cast is completed by Debra Winger and Jeff Daniels who play their parts to perfection, but these are not as detailed as MacLaine's Aurora, and maybe the film would have benefited from concentrating on one character.

Brooks).There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but the ones that come the closest compensate for any less-than-perfect scenes with life-affirming scenes that leave the viewer perceiving it as perfect just the same.  That's why ""Terms of Endearment"" belongs with the best of the best.  Spoiler Alert! Now almost 31 years old, I guess it's possible that there may be a select few who don't know what happens in the lives of ""Aurora Greenway"" (MacLaine) and daughter ""Emma"" (Winger).  If not, with your undivided attention, it would be an understatement to say that this movie will enrich your life (if you haven't seen the movie, please watch it before reading any further, to avoid spoilers).  Its beautifully fitting soundtrack is also distinctly its own.  There are certain SCENES and LINES from this movie that are better than most WHOLE movies.Examples of memorable scenes and lines from ""Terms of Endearment"" (mostly in chronological order):1.  Aurora pinches baby Emma to make sure she's breathing.  A perfect foreshadowing.2.  After his dad (""Flap Horton,"" Jeff Daniels, in a career-high performance also deserving of high praise, especially in comparison to his polar-opposite/zany performance in ""Dumb and Dumber"") comes back up the stairs of their home, after he had started to leave for work, the younger ""Tommy"" actor (Shane Serwin) puts his coat on and waits on the steps outside, as if he knows exactly why dad came back (you have to see the movie to know why).3.  When Emma doesn't have enough money at the grocery store and starts to put some things back, which include things that she then realizes she promised the kids, she starts putting smaller versions of these same items back in with the groceries (a single candy bar instead of the whole economy pack).  Then, they are miraculously saved by ""Sam Burns"" (Lithgow), a local banker (how fitting!), who then tells the clerk that she was rude and ""...must be from New York"" (I love the way the movie seamlessly alternates between comedy and drama).4.  Once leaving the grocery store, the older Tommy actor (Troy Bishop, who reminds me of a young Charles Grodin), realizing Sam is a potential threat to break up his family (because he knows his parents haven't been getting along), in a kind of last-resort desperation, unsuccessfully tries to get Emma, his mom, away from Sam so that nothing can materialize between them.5.  Aurora finally giving in to Garrett Breedlove's (Nicholson) advances, ever so cautiously creeping up his front-door steps with her hands on the rails.6.  Sam Burns:  ""Even though I'm scared and we've committed adultery, I'm just so grateful to God, or the Devil, for letting me feel this way again.""  Classic!7.  Emma in the bathroom with ""Teddy"" (Huckleberry Fox, in a performance way beyond his young years), when she asks him not to flush so that she can continue her secret conversation with Sam.8.  Garrett and Aurora's crazy car ride on the beach, at Garrett's urging, culminating in Aurora's ""Get it outta there!""  There are few movies such as this that can so easily go from one extreme to the other so effortlessly.9.  Garrett to Aurora:  ""Is the Renoit under the covers?"" and, ""I was doing laps when you called; luckily for us I only did eight.""10.  Aurora (thinking to herself, waiting for Garrett to come from next door and hearing him get there faster than she thought):  ""Oh my God, he ran it!""11.  When their baby sister ""Melanie"" gets croup, Teddy encourages his dad to help his mom with the baby, knowing that's better for their marriage, and Tommy and Teddy lovingly know exactly what Melanie needs, and where to find it, to make her feel better.12.  Emma asserts herself to Flap when suspecting infidelity:  ""If you are doing something and you're trying to make me feel crazy because I'm bearing your child, then you may have sunk to a point so low that you'll never recover.  You may have just panicked, Flap, and, trying to save yourself, you've thrown out your character and your principles.  Now the only way you can possibly redeem yourself and be the man that God intended you to be is to admit to me anything that you might've been doing last night because, if you don't do that, if you don't do that right now, you're a lost man.""13.  Emma confronting husband Flap and his mistress right on campus and Flap running after Emma with baby Melanie (a real baby, not a doll, which makes the scene, well, more real).14.  Emma, although without Flap, is ecstatic to see her mom, after having moved so far away, and literally jumps right into her arms.  Then, they walk up to the car to get the kids, and just after you hear ""Grandma, grandma, grandma,"" Tommy looks into his mom's eyes as if to say, ""Does grandma know what's really going on?""15.  Emma and Aurora drinking coffee (or tea) in bed, while lying on their stomachs, so true and very believable as mother and daughter (regardless of what may or may not have happened behind the scenes).16.  After being home for a visit and Emma goes to see best friend ""Patsy,"" even though the kids are having fun in the pool, when their dad calls their mom on the poolside phone, Tommy and Teddy make sure to listen, knowing their parents' (and the whole family's) situation.17.  Once in Nebraska, on campus, Emma:  ""Miss!""  Melanie repeats it:  ""Miss!""  Emma to mistress:  ""Don't make me run after you; I have a toddler here.""18.  When Aurora gets her daughter's diagnosis straight from the doctor and his counsel, she says, ""...And they let you get away with that?""19.  Emma is ever so relieved to hear that one of Patsy's friends' names is ""Jane"" (you have to see the movie to know why).20.  When Aurora gets a surprise visit from Garrett at the Nebraska hotel, after she recently found out her daughter's diagnosis, Aurora finally breaks down.21.  Aurora and Garrett's goodbyes at the airport, complete with butt grabs!  Garrett (after the first goodbye):  ""I was inches away from a clean getaway.""  With second goodbye, he then says, ""I love you too, kid.""22.  Aurora pleads like crazy for the nurses to give Emma the pain shot, which is probably the scene that clinched her Academy Award, by the skin of her teeth, over Winger (plus MacLaine simply having more friends in the Academy of voters because of being older and also having done more movies), but how could you not love them both?  (There has actually been a Best Actress tie before in Oscar history, but it would have been the most fitting for MacLaine and Winger.  The National Society of Film Critics, one of the top 10 award guilds, actually did award Winger as Best Actress over MacLaine.)23.  Flap and Aurora's accidental meeting in the cafeteria (with that I-guess-we-now-have-to-sit-together tension) and subsequent discussion about the custody of the kids doesn't go well.24.  Emma, on her deathbed, tells Flap that she honestly feels the kids shouldn't end up with him, and he admits that she's right.  After they mutually agree (Flap begrudgingly) that the kids should be raised by Aurora, Flap says, ""I probably had that coming.""  Pure genius.25.  Emma, on her deathbed, to son Teddy (maybe the most touching moment among many):  ""I was so scared, but I think it went really well, don't you?""  Teddy, exiting the room in tears, nods.  Emma whispers, ""Yeah?""26.  When Aurora is leaving the hospital with her 3 grandkids and they are on the grounds outside, Tommy makes the mistake of criticizing his mom right in front of his grandma, Aurora, who then slaps him (nothing fake here)...three times(!), before they embrace and Tommy says, ""I'm sorry.""  This is maybe the most powerful and authentic-feeling scene in the movie...so authentic, in fact, that I've always wondered if MacLaine needed to apologize to child actor Bishop in real life for really slapping him, three times.  That scene alone is better than five whole mediocre movies.27.  Aurora and Emma look lovingly at each other in Emma's hospital room the evening before Emma passes.  A dream?28.  Garrett's caring heart finally shines through as he comforts Tommy and walks hand-in-hand with little Melanie at the services.29.  Patsy sits with Flap to comfort him, and Flap puts his head on Patsy's shoulder.30.  Aurora asks Melanie to sit just a little bit closer, which is perhaps a foreshadowing for the sequel, ""Evening Star.""",5,"Everything a life-affirming movie should be, the best mother-daughter movie

211032,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300214117,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 4]","I've always been fascinated by good acting.  It can make a break a film for me.  TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is an acting feast, boasting stellar performances from Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger (as unlikely a biological mother/daughter combo as you can imagine, but hey, this is the movies).  Jack Nicholoson does his thing as your typical astronaut-next door, and is effective, although it's a bit surprising that he walked off with an Oscar for what was, for him, pretty much a walk-through.  John Lithgow and a young Jeff Daniels don't have all that much to do either, although like Nicholson, they are, at least, true to form.  But this is one for the ladies, and it belongs to its two female leads.I had a chuckle when I read Amazon's Tom Keough's review posted above.  ""Lumpy"" is not a bad term for this film.  It's really another one of those Hollywood adaptations, where you just know the book had to be better, even if you've never read the book.  Everything here is just a little too rushed, a little too sketchy.  You know time's flying because different child actors keep cropping up, playing the same roles at different ages.  There seems to be an inordinate haste to get to the meat of the drama, which is, of course, the illness and death of Debra Winger's character.Overall, a better and more authentic weep-fest than, say, BEACHES or LOVE STORY.  Not quite as powerful a family drama as, say, the similarly themed ORDINARY PEOPLE, however.  Well worth seeing, if like me, you've somehow missed it all these years.

She does, however, disapprove of her daughter's choice of husband.This is where the chief divide in the relationship lies.  The rift does not separate them, but this gap does provide distance, which allows them to continue to grow as characters.  Illness will bring them together.I love Debra Winger's work, and I think her character here is well done.  My hat is off though to Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson.

Brooks who was the writer and director.Mr. Brooks was a writer on  &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in the '70's and wrote the enjoyable  movie &quot;Starting Over&quot; in 1979.Shirley MacLaine stars as  Aurora and Debra Winger is her daughter Emma and the story is about their  relationship over many years.The two leads both gave fabulous performances.  Ms.MacLaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress(her one and only win)  and Ms. Winger was nominated.Jack Nicholson gave a very funny,likable  performance as the former astronaut who lives next door to Aurora.  Nicholson won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role(a  role that Burt Reynolds turned down due to a prior commitment.Reynolds  regretted it later because the movie he turned the role down for turned out  to be a flop).Actors John Lithgow and a then unknown Jeff Daniels also give  good performances in supporting roles.However, the real kudos go to  James L.Brooks who won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay  Adaptation(from the novel by Larry McMurtry)and for Best Director,very  impressive since this was his directorial debut.And,it also won Best  Picture of the year.The story has many funny moments,sad moments,and  intense moments,just like in real life.Mr.Brooks went on to write and  direct &quot;Broadcast News&quot; in 1987 and &quot;As Good As It  Gets&quot; in 1997 which were both very good pictures also.There was a  sequel to &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; some 16 years later in 1996  called &quot;The Evening Star&quot; with Ms.MacLaine and Mr. Nicholson but  with a different writer and director.&quot;The Evening Star&quot; was no  classic but &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; truly is.",5,"Funny,sad,intense,just like real life.A classic.",966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,2074,"['first', 'saw', 'quot', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'quot', 'theatre', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Christmas', '1983', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'picture', 'Then', 'saw', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'home', 'video', 'still', 'think', 'so', 'even', 'gave', 'copy', 'video', 'sister', 'birthday', 'present', 'other', 'favorite', 'movies', 'lot', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'who', 'was', 'writer', 'director.Mr', 'Brooks', 'was', 'writer', 'quot', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'quot', ""'70"", 'wrote', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'quot', 'Starting', 'Over', 'quot', '1979.Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'stars', 'Aurora', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'story', 'relationship', 'many', 'years.The', 'two', 'leads', 'gave', 'fabulous', 'performances', 'Ms.MacLaine', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'one', 'only', 'win', 'Ms.', 'Winger', 'was', 'nominated.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'gave', 'very', 'funny', 'likable', 'performance', 'former', 'astronaut', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'Aurora', 'Nicholson', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'role', 'role', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'turned', 'down', 'due', 'prior', 'commitment.Reynolds', 'regretted', 'later', 'movie', 'turned', 'role', 'down', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'flop', '.Actors', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'then', 'unknown', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'also', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'supporting', 'roles.However', 'real', 'kudos', 'go', 'James', 'L.Brooks', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Adaptation', 'novel', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Best', 'Director', 'very', 'impressive', 'was', 'directorial', 'debut.And', 'also', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year.The', 'story', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'sad', 'moments', 'intense', 'moments', 'just', 'real', 'life.Mr.Brooks', 'went', 'write', 'direct', 'quot', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'quot', '1987', 'quot', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'quot', '1997', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'pictures', 'also.There', 'was', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'quot', '16', 'years', 'later', '1996', 'called', 'quot', 'Evening', 'Star', 'quot', 'Ms.MacLaine', 'Mr.', 'Nicholson', 'different', 'writer', 'director.', 'quot', 'Evening', 'Star', 'quot', 'was', 'classic', 'quot', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'quot']",Terms of Endearment VHS

211041,A18BV4O63DOWNH,6300214117,"""juno2""","[7, 18]","and not a very lucid one, at that.  *Terms of Endearment*'s biggest problem, I think, is that it somehow misses the point:  rather than delving into an intensive character-study of a mother-daughter relationship -- which is, presumably, what the movie's supposed to be about -- we're given a chronicle of the mother's and daughter's OTHER relationships, particularly with the men in their lives.  It's not altogether clear if we're supposed to compare and contrast MacLaine's and Winger's separate stories  (and that indeed is what this movie is:  mother and daughter share surprisingly little screen-time), especially since those stories seem to have little to do with each other.  In any event, it all comes across just a tad soap-opera-ish for my taste.I do agree with the reviewer below who observed that MacLaine's and Nicholson's romance seems to be played strictly for laughs.  It's the equivalent of the old pie-in-the-face routine, and it starts to wear after the first hour.Finally, the look of the movie is extraordinarily ugly.  It's as if director James L. Brooks and his cinematographer couldn't afford new film stock, or something.  It reminds me of those ghastly-looking Altman pictures, particularly  *McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller*.  *Terms of Endearment*, made in 1983, looks much older than that, and the digital clean-up on the DVD didn't improve its appearance.I know people love this movie, and my opinion is just that:  opinion.

211042,A2Q07KQAAFWVL7,6300214117,Kristoffer Infante,"[25, 30]","Another film that made me cry! If you've read my reviews on KRAMER VS. KRAMER and RAIN MAN, then you know my story. But, yes, it's happened again! Another Best Picture Oscar-winner has allowed me to shed my tears freely and openly.Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, The Last Picture Show), TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is a &quot;family&quot; film that deals with a 30-year relationship between a flighty mother and her headstrong daughter, played to perfection by Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway, and Debra Winger as her daughter Emma Horton. The film begins by establishing the relatonship between the neurotic Aurora with her young daughter.It makes you laugh and it makes you cry! Either way, the film deserves its kudos. Created by future SIMPSONS producer James L. Brooks, we see the emotional turmoil that both Aurora and Emma face in their love lives.The cast consists of: Jack Nicholson, as Aurora's zany cosmonaut boyfriend Garrett Breedlove (a role originally intended for Burt Reynolds [YIKES!]), Jeff Daniels as Emma's philandering husband Flap Horton, John Lithgow as Emma's lover Sam Burns, and Danny DeVito, in a delightful cameo, as Vernon Dahlart.After a while, though, the film does tend to drift a bit. You have to be patient considering that the final climax, in which Emma loses her fight with cancer, is the blow that sent me (and possibly millions of other viewers) into tears. Watch Aurora's face; watch Emma's, and you'll know exactly what they're saying without them even saying a word. Simply devastating!Winner of 5 Academy Awards including: three for director Brooks for Best Picture (as producer), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay; Best Actress - Shirley MacLaine (also nominated against costar Debra Winger); and Best Supporting Actor - Jack Nicholson (nominated against costar John Lithgow).All in all, in a year (1983) where TERMS was up against THE RIGHT STUFF, THE BIG CHILL, THE DRESSER, SILKWOOD, EDUCATING RITA, and FANNY AND ALEXANDER, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT proved that even a &quot;soap opera&quot; film can be the best!

It's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other, even their sex lives.I've seen this movie several times, and everytime I cry at the end.  In spite of the death, the movie ends on a positive note, giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay.The budding relationship between Aurora and her neighbor (also brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between Emma and her husband and children.The most interesting aspect is that Emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, when she has been cheating on him as well.  Somehow though we sympathize with Emma and her gentle lover (played by the very talented John Lithgow).

But before she disappeared from Hollywood she proved that she was, among other things, one hell of a good actress. In ?Terms of Endearment? she plays Emma, a newlywed, stricken with cancer and forced to grapple with the antics of her philandering husband, Flap (Jeff Daniels). The film is a potpourri of finely wrought performances and it really gets to the heart of the oddly confrontational relationship between a mother and daughter. On this occasion Emma?s mother, Aurora Greenwood is played by Shirley MacLaine. As the grieving, scheming, ultra-concerned, overly protective and manipulative mother, MacLaine is superb. It's really no wonder or surprise that she took home the Oscar for this performance. Jack Nicholson costars as has been astronaut, Garrett Breedlove, known more for his roving eye and noncommittal, devil-may-care attitude toward the ladies than his prowess in the cockpit. His love/hate stance with Aurora blossoms into a genuinely poignant relationship as the film progresses. Danny Devito also appears in a cameo as one of Aurora?s potential suitors.Paramount Home Video has issued this movie in anamorphic widescreen. Colors are well balanced, though details get lost in darker scenes. The characteristic of the picture, overall, is one of dated 80s quality with film grain, grit and some smearing of colors and fading of fine details. Still, it's free of pixelization, edge enhancement and shimmering artifacts. The sound is flat but nicely restored. There are no extras.BOTTOM LINE: GREAT MOVIE! GOOD BUY!

Much like most of Mr. McMurtry's stories, the film takes place in Texas.  It centers around the tumultuous relationship between Aurora &amp; Emma Greenway, who are mother and daughter.  Aurora is played with a spitfire essence by Shirley MacLaine and Emma is played by Debra Winger.  Aurora is a bit overprotective of Emma and this leads to the relationship strains especially when Emma marries Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels).  The two drift apart and Aurora starts up an unusual romance with her ex-astronaut next door neighbor, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson).  The scenes between Aurora and Garrett are the best in the film and both Ms. MacLaine and Mr. Nicholson are brilliant in them.  The movie teeters on the brink of sappiness at the end as it digresses into a complete tear-jerker as Emma develops a terminal illness.  But despite that, director James L. Brooks has crafted an enjoyable film that will make you both laugh and cry.

Each  performer works to his/her potential, and the supposed fireworks between  Debra Winger (who inhabits her role so intensely she IS Emma) and Shirley  MacLaine -- who won an Oscar -- works perfectly on screen.  Jeff Daniels  pulls off a neat trick, and manages to be both reprehensible as Emma's  multi-flawed husband, but also engenders your sympathy vote as the movie  wears on.  Jack Nicholson (also Oscar winner) and MacLaine combatively  explore one of the funniest romances ever; the screenplay's distinctive  sense of humor adds much charm and much needed comic relief from the  increasingly depressing proceedings.  Michael Gore's already-classic theme  music can still inspire tears and resound with humanity.

Aurora Greenway's husband has died and she and her daughter Emma struggle with their relationship.  Emma believe that her mom does not care about her and Aurora believes Emma deliberately antagonizes her.  Emma quickly grows up and marries Hap (Jeff Daniels) against her mother's wishes.  Hap is an English teacher and for awhile they are blissfully happy.  Hap and Emma have three children.  Jack Nicholson, a womanizing, wise-cracking  former astronaut moves next door to Aurora.  His relationship with Aurora is a joy to watch.  Aurora finds him childish; he is intrigued by her.Then the unexpected happens and choices have to be made.  Aurora will have to make a very difficult choice regarding her grandchildren; Hap will have to decide if he wants to remain their father;  Jack Nicholson is more supportive than Aurora imagined.Basically Terms of Endearment is about a mother's unconditional love for her daughter.  It may not seem so at times and Emma doubts her mother loves her but eventually she will know how much Aurora loves her.I don't want to spoil this for you but it is a wonderful story.  A story you will want to watch again and again.  The Blu Ray dvd is fantastic and it gives this movie that won five academy awards the stage that it needs.The sequel to the movie is &#34;The Evening Star.&#34;",5,TERMS OF ENDEARMENT & UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1767,"['review', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'dvd', 'released', '12/2/13', 'Be', 'sure', 'change', 'audio', 'system', 'leave', 'sound', 'too', 'soft', '3', 'audio', 'selections', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'clear', 'Aurora', 'favorite', 'chair', 'crocheted', 'afghan', 'back', 'can', 'see', 'flower', 'color', 'afghan', 'quality', 'picture', 'exceptional.Most', 'know', 'story', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'brief', 'Aurora', 'Greenway', 'husband', 'died', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'struggle', 'relationship', 'Emma', 'believe', 'mom', 'not', 'care', 'Aurora', 'Emma', 'deliberately', 'Emma', 'quickly', 'up', 'marries', 'Hap', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'mother', 'wishes', 'Hap', 'English', 'teacher', 'are', 'blissfully', 'happy', 'Hap', 'Emma', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'womanizing', 'wise-cracking', 'former', 'astronaut', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'Aurora', 'relationship', 'Aurora', 'joy', 'watch', 'Aurora', 'childish', 'intrigued', 'her.Then', 'unexpected', 'happens', 'choices', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'Aurora', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'very', 'difficult', 'choice', 'regarding', 'grandchildren', 'Hap', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'remain', 'father', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'more', 'supportive', 'Aurora', 'imagined.Basically', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'mother', 'unconditional', 'love', 'daughter', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'times', 'Emma', 'mother', 'eventually', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Aurora', 'her.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'wonderful', 'story', 'story', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'dvd', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'won', 'five', 'academy', 'awards', 'stage', 'sequel', 'movie', '34', 'Evening', 'Star.', '34']",Terms of Endearment VHS

Right up there whenever I think of memorable gems of all time.We ambitiously traverse a daunting 25 years or so of a vagarious (and hence normal, loving) relationship between mother and daughter, some of which I admit are wrought with thinly veiled tear-jerking cliches, but the film does remarkably well with its intelligent pacing and a liberal sprinkling of good cheer.Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, Shirley Mclaine: need one say more! The riveting chemistry between a wine-n-women Nicholson and an eccentric Mclaine is reason enough to grab your own copy of this sprightly romp. Winger is ebulliently witty and sharp as ever. The twists and turns of the plot along with its razor-sharp dialogue more than make up for the occasional feather-weight moment that sneaked in.Some reviewers make it sound like a four-hanky chickflick. I disagree, it's topnotch heartwarming drama with some fabulous performances from best stars of our time at the top of their game.

Burt Reynolds was the producers original choice, but he had to drop out because of other commitments. Harrison Ford was offered the role, only to turn it down. At one point during filming MacLaine stated to James L. Brooks that ""he could shove the Oscar up his #$#!"". Eventually, all was settled on the set and ""Terms of Endearment"" went on to enjoy huge boxoffice and critical acclaim.

So, when I was roped into seeing this film and found myself actually caring about what happens to the characters, I was pleasantly surprised.  The performances, especially Shirley MacLaine's, are very emotionally charged, yet believable. I found myself really liking and really disliking each character in turn, but that's what makes them real.  The plot bounces right along and the film is all-together very watchable (even for a seasoned chick-flick hater such as myself). Larry McMurtry always had a penchant for entertaining story-telling, and this movie is no exception.  The only character I had trouble believing was Garrett Breedlove. As much as I respect Jack Nicholson's ability, not even he could make his corny antics work. Garrett the astronaut stuck out like a sore--albeit sometimes amusing--thumb among all the other ""ordinary"" people. Nicholson did what he could with it, but the subplot itself just seemed like it belonged in a different movie.

While I expected this to be a well made movie, I did not know this was a tearjerker. My mother and sister both started to cry in the end and this might not a suitable movie for a young and sensitive child. If you do watch it with a younger audience, I would encourage to talk and discuss the movie afterwards!Terms of Endearment is a movie about relationships, most specifically the relationship between a daughter and her mother. Aurora Greenway and her daughter Emma have been extremely attached to each other since the day little Emma was born. Her mother is very protective but loving over her. As for the father, he passed away when Emma was a child. Much to her mother's dislike, Emma marries Flap, a man who will get her out of her sheltered home and into the world. She is absolutely in love with talk and words despite him deep down being rather boring and not very successful in his job of being a college professor. Aurora refuses to attend the wedding and is disgusted when Emma announces her pregnancy. Eventually, Emma moves to Iowa and her best friend, Patsy, moves to New York to become rich due to her career driven personality. This makes an interesting comparison to Emma, who decides to be a stay at home mother instead. As the movie continues, it shows how  both Aurora and Emma's lives play out in both good and bad times of their life. One of the highlights is Aurora's romance with the neighbor Garrett who happens to be an retired astronaut who also enjoys swimming and dating women. But it is pretty obvious by the end of the film that no women had touched his heart like Aurora before. Closing up the movie, tragedy hits.This movie has absolutely beautiful performances by Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, and many others. The characters are extremely real and complex. There is no good or bad to this. It is all one big grey area. The characters we love did bad things, the characters we could not stand did good things. Just like in real life, of course. It will make you laugh, cry, and just all around care for this family. This movie is definitely not afraid of being sentimental and pulling on our heart strings. There are scenes in this that you know were shot to get us to cry out and feel bad for the characters. Not to mention, the soundtrack! Oh the soundtrack. I hear it get criticized often for being a little much but I enjoyed it. Terms of Endearment is a tearjerker and it is proud!I would highly recommend watching this movie to anyone who loves their family or a good movie. It makes a good mother/daughter movie, I am sure we can all relate even if we have not been in these exact situations ourselves.
