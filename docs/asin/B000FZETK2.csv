997307,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000FZETK2,Cubist,"[10, 11]","With the recent death of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, Wildboyz, with its irreverent, childish humour, just doesn't seem as funny anymore. Not to mention the show's concept - Jackass meets Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom - seems, well, played out. Perhaps sensing this, the third and fourth seasons spend as much time examining a country's culture as much as its animals.The boys visit Kenya with fellow Jackass alumni Wee-Man along for the ride. They try their hand at skateboarding the Savannahs and inevitably perform stunts that land them in big piles of, you guessed it, elephant poop. Do you sense a reoccurring theme, here? What makes the show work is that each episode really attempts to open a window (albeit a grotesque one) on a culture radically different from our own. So, we get to see Chris and Steve-O participate in all kinds of traditional rituals practiced by primitive tribes. It doesn't hurt that many of the rituals the two of them are subjected to fit in with the Jackass-style of gross-out humour. Are they trying to say that the Jackass tradition is as old as human culture itself? Probably not - that would be way too sophisticated for this show.The personalities of Steve-O and, to a larger degree, Chris also account for a large part of the show's appeal. Although, in season three, Steve-O becomes more of a spoil-sport, exhibiting almost diva-like behaviour so that he comes across, at times, like a big whiner. He's okay so long as the joke is not at his expense. Chris, in comparison, is much more easy-going and looks like he's always having fun, like a big kid getting to play with all kinds of wild animals. He seems willing to try anything and isn't a complainer like his partner. Their pal Manny Puig appears frequently, displaying a lot of guts... or stupidity as in one episode he sneaks up on a lion and grabs its tail!The DVD advertises itself as ""Unrated"" and while the language is indeed not bleeped, nudity is still censored.The first disc features commentaries for all the episodes in season three by Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Manny Puig, Johnny Knoxville, Wee-Man, Loomis Fall and co-creators/producers Jeff Tremaine and Dimitry Elyashkevich. These typically rowdy tracks feature everyone fighting to get a word in edge-wise while also making fun of Steve-O at every opportunity.The second disc features commentaries by the same participants for all the episodes in season four. Knoxville sits in on the Russia episodes helping deliver one of the more spirited tracks as all the ""creative"" camerawork during the ballet sequence is pointed out. They also make fun of Chris' ""cat-like reflexes"" during the hockey sequence.The third disc features ""Outtakes,"" footage of Chris and Steve-O goofing around between ""takes."" Also included is funny footage of animals being their usual unpredictable selves.""Bonus Segments"" feature footage that didn't make the cut, including Chris and Steve-O getting wasted with some drunk Russians on very potent alcohol that is quite funny to watch.""Wildboyz: Over and Out"" is a behind-the-scenes featurette. Chris, Steve-O and Knoxville all say that Russia was their favourite country to visit. Everyone tells anecdotes about what they feel are the most memorable moments that, surprisingly, doesn't repeat much of what is said on the commentaries.""Top 10 Wildboyz Moments"" features Steve-O, Chris, Manny, Knoxville and Wee-Man pick their favourite moments from the past two seasons.""Photo Gallery"" includes pictures from the last two seasons.Finally, there is ""Nintendo DS Ad - Behind the Scenes"" which takes a look at Steve-O and Chris shooting an ad for Nintendo's latest gaming system. We see them messing around before hand, killing time until the actual ad is shot.",4,More crazy cultures less crazy animals...,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,3743,"['recent', 'death', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'Wildboyz', 'irreverent', 'childish', 'humour', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'funny', 'anymore', 'Not', 'mention', 'show', 'concept', 'Jackass', 'Mutual', 'Omaha', 'Wild', 'Kingdom', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'sensing', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'examining', 'country', 'culture', 'as', 'much', 'animals.The', 'boys', 'visit', 'Kenya', 'fellow', 'Jackass', 'Wee-Man', 'ride', 'try', 'hand', 'skateboarding', 'Savannahs', 'inevitably', 'perform', 'stunts', 'land', 'big', 'piles', 'guessed', 'elephant', 'poop', 'Do', 'sense', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'here', 'What', 'show', 'work', 'episode', 'really', 'open', 'window', 'grotesque', 'one', 'culture', 'radically', 'different', 'own', 'So', 'get', 'see', 'Chris', 'Steve-O', 'participate', 'kinds', 'traditional', 'rituals', 'practiced', 'primitive', 'tribes', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'many', 'rituals', 'two', 'are', 'subjected', 'fit', 'Jackass-style', 'gross-out', 'humour', 'Are', 'trying', 'say', 'Jackass', 'tradition', 'as', 'old', 'human', 'culture', 'Probably', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'show.The', 'personalities', 'Steve-O', 'larger', 'degree', 'Chris', 'also', 'account', 'large', 'part', 'show', 'appeal', 'season', 'three', 'Steve-O', 'more', 'spoil-sport', 'exhibiting', 'almost', 'diva-like', 'behaviour', 'so', 'times', 'big', 'whiner', 'okay', 'so', 'long', 'joke', 'not', 'expense', 'Chris', 'comparison', 'much', 'more', 'easy-going', 'always', 'having', 'fun', 'big', 'kid', 'getting', 'play', 'kinds', 'wild', 'animals', 'willing', 'try', 'anything', ""n't"", 'complainer', 'partner', 'pal', 'Manny', 'Puig', 'frequently', 'displaying', 'lot', 'guts', 'stupidity', 'one', 'episode', 'up', 'lion', 'grabs', 'tail', 'DVD', 'Unrated', 'language', 'indeed', 'not', 'bleeped', 'nudity', 'still', 'censored.The', 'first', 'disc', 'features', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'Steve-O', 'Chris', 'Pontius', 'Manny', 'Puig', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Wee-Man', 'Loomis', 'Fall', 'co-creators/producers', 'Jeff', 'Tremaine', 'Dimitry', 'Elyashkevich', 'typically', 'rowdy', 'tracks', 'feature', 'everyone', 'fighting', 'get', 'word', 'edge-wise', 'also', 'making', 'fun', 'Steve-O', 'opportunity.The', 'second', 'disc', 'features', 'commentaries', 'same', 'participants', 'episodes', 'season', 'four', 'Knoxville', 'Russia', 'episodes', 'helping', 'deliver', 'one', 'more', 'spirited', 'tracks', 'creative', 'camerawork', 'ballet', 'sequence', 'pointed', 'out', 'also', 'make', 'fun', 'Chris', 'cat-like', 'reflexes', 'hockey', 'sequence.The', 'third', 'disc', 'Outtakes', 'footage', 'Chris', 'Steve-O', 'goofing', 'around', 'Also', 'included', 'funny', 'footage', 'animals', 'being', 'usual', 'unpredictable', 'selves', 'Bonus', 'Segments', 'feature', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'including', 'Chris', 'Steve-O', 'getting', 'wasted', 'drunk', 'Russians', 'very', 'potent', 'alcohol', 'quite', 'funny', 'watch', 'Wildboyz', 'Out', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'Chris', 'Steve-O', 'Knoxville', 'say', 'Russia', 'was', 'favourite', 'country', 'visit', 'Everyone', 'what', 'feel', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'much', 'what', 'said', 'commentaries', 'Top', '10', 'Wildboyz', 'Moments', 'Steve-O', 'Chris', 'Manny', 'Knoxville', 'Wee-Man', 'pick', 'favourite', 'moments', 'past', 'two', 'seasons', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'pictures', 'last', 'two', 'seasons.Finally', 'Nintendo', 'DS', 'Ad', 'Scenes', 'look', 'Steve-O', 'Chris', 'shooting', 'ad', 'Nintendo', 'latest', 'gaming', 'system', 'see', 'messing', 'hand', 'killing', 'time', 'actual', 'ad', 'shot']",Wildboyz - Complete Seasons 3 & 4 Urated
997308,A24SP9OBA2OO75,B000FZETK2,D. Ferrari,"[0, 0]",Seasons one and two were slices of fried gold.  Season's 3 and 4 were really kind of phoned in by the guys which they actually admit during the commentary.  The episodes when Knoxville joins them are the best which further solidifies him as the glue that holds Jackass together.  Overall I would absolutely recommend it because even phoned in it is really good stuff.,3,Not as good as season one and two,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,367,"['Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'slices', 'fried', 'gold', 'Season', '3', '4', 'were', 'really', 'kind', 'phoned', 'guys', 'actually', 'admit', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'when', 'Knoxville', 'are', 'best', 'further', 'solidifies', 'glue', 'Jackass', 'together', 'Overall', 'would', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'even', 'phoned', 'really', 'good', 'stuff']",Wildboyz - Complete Seasons 3 & 4 Urated
