DISHONORED LADY was one of the films she made during this time, based on a play written by Edward Sheldon and Margaret Ayer Barnes (and originally staged on Broadway by renowned Guthrie McClintic).  She plays a sophisticated magazine designer who abandons her hedonistic lifestyle, only to be implicated in a murder.  She co-stars with her husband at the time, John Loder, and they have a good onscreen rapport.

436360,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,6304819528,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[1, 3]","Hedy Lamarr at her BEST.  After her production role of the fascinating and morally complex STRANGE WOMAN (see my separate 5 star review for that), Hedy was awarded this great murder mystery, based on a true story, DISHONORED LADY.I saw this on a very poor VHS transfer (not purchased through Amazon).  The script is wonderful - a bit melodramatic, the casting is great, but the post production aspects, especially the music are a real disappointment because Hedy shines in this film with HER FINEST ACTING WORK ON FILM.  In another role that is complex and real in its portrayal of a ""party girl"" trying to straighten out her life, her self, when she becomes a murder suspect.This is a real ""slice of time"" film in that it deals with women who were working, ""like men"" who ""thought like men"" i.e. enjoied and wanted careers; which was considered a real social problem at the time as men came back from the war and wanted their jobs back.  Women were meanwhile enjoing the freedom of having their own jobs their own independence, and this was seen as transgressive, especially if the woman, like this one, was also sexually liberated.The script hits all these notes appropriately, but the awful operatic music hammers away.  Fortunately, that wasn't on the set.  Hedy gives a layered, thoughtful, and - a rarity - a relaxed, humorous, and joyful performance.  She has a ""drunk scene"" that is playful and completely real, a very subtly funny portrayal of being ""pleasantly inebriated.""  All this makes me think this must be who she truly was.  She had just finished a film she had fought for, and was working on this fantastic character who liked working and was interested in science (as she was herself).  It is simply a MUST see for any Hedy Lamar film  (as is THE STRANGE WOMAN for other reasons)- for a glimpse of her entire range.Looking at her bios, this was a turning point where she started her disenchantement with roles she was being offered.  She is beautiful and tempestuous in the later SAMPSON AND DELILAH, but her heart is not in that the way it is in this film.  And she slowed down her acting quite a bit after these.See this to see Hedy Lamar the actress surrounded by a great supporting cast (including Margaret Hamilton - Dorothy's wicked witch), in a film which I feel is her finest work.",5,A MUST SEE for Hedy Lamarr fans - HER FINEST ACTING WORK,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2308,"['Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'BEST', 'production', 'role', 'fascinating', 'morally', 'complex', 'STRANGE', 'WOMAN', 'see', 'separate', '5', 'star', 'review', 'Hedy', 'was', 'awarded', 'great', 'murder', 'mystery', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'DISHONORED', 'LADY.I', 'saw', 'very', 'poor', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'not', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'script', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'casting', 'great', 'post', 'production', 'aspects', 'especially', 'music', 'are', 'real', 'disappointment', 'Hedy', 'shines', 'film', 'HER', 'FINEST', 'ACTING', 'WORK', 'ON', 'FILM', 'role', 'complex', 'real', 'portrayal', 'party', 'girl', 'trying', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'self', 'when', 'murder', 'suspect.This', 'real', 'slice', 'time', 'film', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'working', 'men', 'who', 'thought', 'men', 'i.e', 'enjoied', 'wanted', 'careers', 'was', 'considered', 'real', 'social', 'problem', 'time', 'men', 'came', 'back', 'war', 'wanted', 'jobs', 'back', 'Women', 'were', 'meanwhile', 'enjoing', 'freedom', 'having', 'own', 'jobs', 'own', 'independence', 'was', 'seen', 'transgressive', 'especially', 'woman', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'sexually', 'liberated.The', 'script', 'notes', 'appropriately', 'awful', 'operatic', 'music', 'hammers', 'away', 'Fortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'Hedy', 'layered', 'thoughtful', 'rarity', 'relaxed', 'humorous', 'joyful', 'performance', 'drunk', 'scene', 'playful', 'completely', 'real', 'very', 'subtly', 'funny', 'portrayal', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'inebriated', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'who', 'truly', 'was', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'film', 'had', 'fought', 'was', 'working', 'fantastic', 'character', 'who', 'liked', 'working', 'was', 'interested', 'science', 'was', 'simply', 'MUST', 'see', 'Hedy', 'Lamar', 'film', 'THE', 'STRANGE', 'WOMAN', 'other', 'reasons', 'glimpse', 'entire', 'range.Looking', 'bios', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'disenchantement', 'roles', 'was', 'being', 'offered', 'beautiful', 'tempestuous', 'later', 'SAMPSON', 'AND', 'DELILAH', 'heart', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'slowed', 'down', 'acting', 'quite', 'bit', 'these.See', 'see', 'Hedy', 'Lamar', 'actress', 'surrounded', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Dorothy', 'wicked', 'witch', 'film', 'feel', 'finest', 'work']",Dishonored Lady VHS
