W.,"[3, 3]","As a recovering addict and one who has now worked in chemical dependency/psychiatry for over 15 years, I have sought to study addiction and in particular have looked for resources that would help addicts as well as non-addicts understand it.Kevin McCauley's presentation of the origin and working of addiction within the brain in a easy to understand talk is one of the finest I have ever heard. And, at just under 70 minutes in length and filmed in the majestic Utah desert, is not boring.I heartily recommend this film to addicts and their family and friends; high school classes and youth groups; to employers; to clinicians; to anyone who desires to gain some understanding to what has been most aptly described by greater minds than mine as ""cunning, baffling and powerful.""",5,The best presentation on addiction,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,779,"['recovering', 'addict', 'one', 'who', 'now', 'worked', 'chemical', 'dependency/psychiatry', '15', 'years', 'have', 'sought', 'study', 'addiction', 'particular', 'have', 'looked', 'resources', 'would', 'help', 'addicts', 'as', 'well', 'non-addicts', 'understand', 'it.Kevin', 'McCauley', 'presentation', 'origin', 'working', 'addiction', 'brain', 'easy', 'understand', 'talk', 'one', 'finest', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'just', '70', 'minutes', 'length', 'filmed', 'majestic', 'Utah', 'desert', 'not', 'boring.I', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'film', 'addicts', 'family', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'classes', 'youth', 'groups', 'employers', 'clinicians', 'anyone', 'who', 'gain', 'understanding', 'what', 'been', 'most', 'aptly', 'described', 'greater', 'minds', 'mine', 'cunning', 'baffling', 'powerful']",N/A

I'm a professional Substance Abuse Counselor and it addresses the largest obstacle between real people and real recover head on...The Choice Argument.This video also brings us into the twenty-first century for treatment and educational films.  Most Treatment films and treatment programs only ""tip their hats"" to the ""Physiology"" of Addiction but too few really understand the concept well enough to promote it.Enter Dr. McCauley.  This video is asthetically pleasing, informative, up to date and challenges the most common myth of Alcohol and Drug addiction, ""the choice argument"", in a very effective, accurate and informative way.  In one hour, this film explains what we know about choice and how it works, and how addiction effects the choices we make, and, the neurology of why.It's not spiritual (though it's certainly accepting of spiritual beliefs), it's not straight psycology (it deconstructs the idea that you could simply live a better life and be free of addiction, though it surely registers the importance of living a healthy, recovery oriented lifestyle).  It's simply the medical science that proves what researchers, scientists, doctors, and recovery experts have been saying since 1958 (or since 1935 if you consider Dr. Silkworth's Opinion) and even 1913 if Jack London's observations are accurate (John Barlycorn:Memiors of an Alcoholic) and that is that Addiction, Alcoholism, Chemical Dependency is at it's core a physiological, more accurately, a neurologic, condition.Understanding how the neurology is affected is hugely important to those who want to stay sober.  You can learn to deal with stress in many ways (especially through a Twelve Step Program). You can learn to avoid slippery people places and things through logical, rational thinking, good feedback from people you trust and rigourus Honesty with Self and others, but, everywhere you go, you bring your unique neurochemistry with you.  You can't make a three legged stool stand if you only attach two of the legs.  Completely understanding how your brain is malfunctioning helps any addict apply recovery thinking in a way that is effective, applied every single day (one day at a time) and defend against ""the ungaurded moment.""This is a great video for family members of addicts and alcoholics, for treatment professionals in both substance abuse and medical feilds, as well as mental health providers.  Anyone who needs to understand the nature of addiction and needs an answer as to ""why? after all that has happened, did this person still choose to do drugs or drink, Why?!""(on a side note.  I've had the pleasure of hearing Dr. McCauley speak and he's better in person than the film, and, I think the film is the shot in the arm that treatment needed, the next rung on the ladder of truly understanding and treating the monster that is addiction.)",5,It's about TIME!,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2914,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'video', 'close', 'one', 'hundred', 'times', 'fantastic', ""'m"", 'professional', 'Substance', 'Abuse', 'Counselor', 'largest', 'obstacle', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'recover', 'head', 'Choice', 'Argument.This', 'video', 'also', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'treatment', 'educational', 'films', 'Most', 'Treatment', 'films', 'treatment', 'programs', 'only', 'tip', 'hats', 'Physiology', 'Addiction', 'too', 'few', 'really', 'understand', 'concept', 'well', 'enough', 'promote', 'it.Enter', 'Dr.', 'McCauley', 'video', 'asthetically', 'pleasing', 'informative', 'up', 'date', 'most', 'common', 'myth', 'Alcohol', 'Drug', 'addiction', 'choice', 'argument', 'very', 'effective', 'accurate', 'informative', 'way', 'one', 'hour', 'film', 'what', 'know', 'choice', 'how', 'how', 'addiction', 'effects', 'choices', 'make', 'neurology', 'why.It', 'not', 'spiritual', 'certainly', 'accepting', 'spiritual', 'beliefs', 'not', 'straight', 'psycology', 'idea', 'could', 'simply', 'live', 'better', 'life', 'be', 'free', 'addiction', 'surely', 'importance', 'living', 'healthy', 'recovery', 'oriented', 'lifestyle', 'simply', 'medical', 'science', 'what', 'researchers', 'scientists', 'doctors', 'recovery', 'experts', 'have', 'been', 'saying', '1958', '1935', 'consider', 'Dr.', 'Silkworth', 'Opinion', 'even', '1913', 'Jack', 'London', 'observations', 'are', 'accurate', 'John', 'Barlycorn', 'Memiors', 'Alcoholic', 'Addiction', 'Alcoholism', 'Chemical', 'Dependency', 'core', 'physiological', 'more', 'accurately', 'neurologic', 'condition.Understanding', 'how', 'neurology', 'affected', 'hugely', 'important', 'who', 'want', 'stay', 'sober', 'can', 'learn', 'deal', 'stress', 'many', 'ways', 'especially', 'Twelve', 'Step', 'Program', 'can', 'learn', 'avoid', 'slippery', 'people', 'places', 'things', 'logical', 'rational', 'thinking', 'good', 'feedback', 'people', 'trust', 'rigourus', 'Honesty', 'Self', 'others', 'everywhere', 'go', 'bring', 'unique', 'neurochemistry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'three', 'legged', 'stool', 'stand', 'only', 'attach', 'two', 'legs', 'Completely', 'understanding', 'how', 'brain', 'malfunctioning', 'addict', 'apply', 'recovery', 'thinking', 'way', 'effective', 'applied', 'single', 'day', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'defend', 'ungaurded', 'moment', 'great', 'video', 'family', 'members', 'addicts', 'alcoholics', 'treatment', 'professionals', 'substance', 'abuse', 'medical', 'feilds', 'as', 'well', 'mental', 'health', 'providers', 'Anyone', 'who', 'understand', 'nature', 'addiction', 'answer', 'why', 'happened', 'did', 'person', 'still', 'choose', 'do', 'drugs', 'drink', 'Why', 'side', 'note', ""'ve"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'hearing', 'Dr.', 'McCauley', 'speak', 'better', 'person', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'shot', 'arm', 'treatment', 'needed', 'next', 'rung', 'ladder', 'truly', 'understanding', 'treating', 'monster', 'addiction']",N/A
