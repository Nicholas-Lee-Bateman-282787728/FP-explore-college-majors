Errol Flynn puts the viewer through a gamut of emotions and flexing loyalties for his character. Perhaps a flawed film, it remains intriguing for what Errol Flynn did with his character.

327807,A1345VRK5MYG7,6302682576,James L.,"[3, 8]","Ida Lupino tries really hard to inject some life and energy into this story of two brothers who fall in love with the same woman.  Lupino is the poor single mother who loves one of the brothers, Errol Flynn, a free spirit who composes music.  Gig Young is the other brother, and rich girl Eleanor Parker is the object of both brothers' affections.  The story is too complicated to summarize in a few sentences, with the locale shifting across Europe.  However, the story is never credible, and neither are the actors.  Flynn was no longer cutting much of a dashing figure by this point in his career, and he brings no depth or conviction to the character at all.  Parker never seems like the type of woman who could inspire anything, while Young barely registers as the other brother.  Lupino goes for it, as she did with pretty much every performance, but with this script and ill-defined character, there's not much she can do than appear continually overwrought.  By the half way mark of the movie, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them.  There is some good music, but the story and characters do not flow nearly as well as the orchestrations.

In this glossy Warners remake, the adorable little gamine is played by Ida Lupino, who  scampers about in what has to be her worst performance. This is one of the  duds (&quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; are the  others) that Errol Flynn made in the late forties trying to extend his  range, and which instead killed off his career as a major star.

Errol Flynn carried this film most of the way with his usual charm but even he can't perform lazarus on such a bad written screenplay. Peter Godfrey didn't help either.

I thought Errol Flynn and Ida Lupino were great. Though reviewers mock the weak screenplay and melodramatic acting, I thought the film was sweet and very enchanting!Flynn and Lupino were the best of friends before the making of this film. Yet during its filming, they became romantically involved, which I thought played so well for the characters they portrayed. There was a spark between them that was undeniable! Lupino herself said that ""the extra gleam in her eyes"" was due in part to her off-set fling with Flynn.Eleanor Parker was beautiful and her counterpart, Gig Young, were both decent in their supporting roles. The spotlight, however, does shine brightly on its two major stars. The ending is a little unsatisfying, though. The epiphany of Flynn's character is disbelieving; he didn't do much groveling for my taste! Throughout much of the film he acts horrid and irresponsible. However, he's forgiven albeit a little too easily!""Escape Me Never"" is not highly regarded as their best picture, but I still think it's worth a shot. If you're a softie like me, then you'll be crying your eyes out. As a testament, my eyes are still stinging hot and dry from all the tears I've shed.
