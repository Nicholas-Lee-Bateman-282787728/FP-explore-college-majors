There is not a bad or unfunny performance in this movie.  It is as if every actor in this film was born for their respective parts.  Rodney Dangerfield as the noveau riche real estate developer who encroaches on the staid Waspy old time members of Bushwood is great.  It is his shining moment, he deserved an Oscar!  And Bill Murray as the demented assistant Greens Keeper brings out the Tiger Woods in all of us..Yes, this film is a bit dated, but still holds up well.  A fantastically funny story, good acting, a great backdrop, and a soundtrack I still hum along too, what more can a comedy viewer ask for?  Besides, you will find yourself letting out with quotes, like ""While we're young.""  But who can forget Carl's question to the head Greens Keeper?Carl Spackler: ""Correct me if I'm wrong Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key."".Sandy: ""Not golfers, you great fool.

108665,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790741105,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 9]","I will admit that `Caddyshack' is severely overrated.  Sure, it's funny and I found enjoyment out of the film in general, but it is no where near the laugh riot that many faithful devotees will have you thinking it is.  That said, `Caddyshack' does have followers for a reason, and that is that it manages to tickle the funny bone on more than one occasion, and the star making comedic turns by many in the cast don't hurt the films iconic status.The film revolves around a posh golf course that is being destroyed by a gopher as well as a loudmouthed new member.  The film almost has no point other than to make fun of itself at every possible juncture, stringing along a slew of subplots involving a caddy contest and a doomed love affair in order to give the film a reason to exist, but when it all boils down to it there is no reason to watch other than the pointless gags and memorable one-liners.The script is not as tightly woven as it could be; that is to say that the film is not very smart.  This is kind of like the movie that is so dumb you can't help but laugh at it and since you laughed you repeat and tell you friends and then they watch it and laugh and then you all talk about it even though deep down you know the movie is kind of a waste; sort of like `Napoleon Dynamite', except this one stars Bill Murray so you think your adoration is justified, even though it's not.  Just take a moment to let the accuracy of my above words sink in, since you know I'm right even if you don't want to admit it.The acting for the most part is good.  Many have raved Murray, but I actually feel he is the weakest link here.  His performance is more slapstick than anything else, building off stupidity to get a laugh.  Rodney Dangerfield is himself, same old loud and obnoxious (and crude) character he liked to play so often, and he works to a degree.  To me Ted Knight matches and actually trumps Dangerfield, delivering a spot on portrayal of a man at wits end.  The real standout though is Chevy Chase who manages to get most of the laughs from me with his sly and steady delivery, keeping his comedy subtle yet always effective.  The rest of the cast is effective, but these four always get the recognition so I figured I'd ring in here as well.In the end I'll say that I liked `Caddyshack' and would probably watch it again, but as far as it being the best comedy out there, I have to say that it is not.  Is it the best golf movie out there?  Well, I don't watch a lot of movies about golf but of the one's I've seen this surely beats `The Legend of Bagger Vance' but doesn't even come close to the comedic energy of `Happy Gilmore' so I guess I'd have to say, no, it is not the best golf movie out there.  It's fun though, and it has a huge following, so it must have gotten some things right.",3,"It's funny, but it's not all it's cracked up to be...",1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,2807,"['will', 'admit', 'Caddyshack', 'severely', 'overrated', 'Sure', 'funny', 'found', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'general', 'where', 'laugh', 'riot', 'many', 'faithful', 'devotees', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'said', 'Caddyshack', 'have', 'followers', 'reason', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'star', 'making', 'comedic', 'turns', 'many', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'films', 'iconic', 'status.The', 'film', 'around', 'posh', 'golf', 'course', 'being', 'destroyed', 'gopher', 'as', 'well', 'loudmouthed', 'new', 'member', 'film', 'almost', 'point', 'other', 'make', 'fun', 'possible', 'juncture', 'stringing', 'along', 'slew', 'subplots', 'involving', 'caddy', 'contest', 'doomed', 'love', 'affair', 'order', 'give', 'film', 'reason', 'exist', 'when', 'down', 'reason', 'watch', 'other', 'pointless', 'gags', 'memorable', 'one-liners.The', 'script', 'not', 'as', 'tightly', 'woven', 'could', 'be', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'smart', 'kind', 'movie', 'so', 'dumb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'laughed', 'repeat', 'tell', 'friends', 'then', 'watch', 'laugh', 'then', 'talk', 'even', 'deep', 'know', 'movie', 'kind', 'waste', 'sort', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'one', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'think', 'adoration', 'justified', 'even', 'not', 'Just', 'take', 'moment', 'let', 'accuracy', 'words', 'sink', 'know', ""'m"", 'right', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'it.The', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'Many', 'have', 'raved', 'Murray', 'actually', 'feel', 'weakest', 'link', 'here', 'performance', 'more', 'slapstick', 'anything', 'else', 'building', 'off', 'stupidity', 'get', 'laugh', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'same', 'old', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'crude', 'character', 'liked', 'play', 'so', 'often', 'degree', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'matches', 'actually', 'trumps', 'Dangerfield', 'delivering', 'spot', 'portrayal', 'man', 'wits', 'end', 'real', 'standout', 'though', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'who', 'get', 'most', 'laughs', 'sly', 'steady', 'delivery', 'keeping', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'yet', 'always', 'effective', 'rest', 'cast', 'effective', 'four', 'always', 'get', 'recognition', 'figured', ""'d"", 'ring', 'here', 'well.In', 'end', ""'ll"", 'say', 'liked', 'Caddyshack', 'would', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'best', 'comedy', 'there', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'best', 'golf', 'movie', 'there', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'golf', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'surely', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'comedic', 'energy', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'so', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'not', 'best', 'golf', 'movie', 'there', 'fun', 'huge', 'following', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'things', 'right']",N/A

In terms of hilarity, I think it's slightly ahead of Stripes and just behind Blazing Saddles and Animal House.  Every single line that comes out of Rodney Dangerfield's mouth is absolutely precious.  After a little while, you become like Pavlov's dog as you are conditioned to laugh every time that he shows his face.  I've seen this movie ten times and I still howl whenever it's on.  The lines that Dangerfield says to Ted Knight and his wife are awesome (""hey honey, you must have been something before electricity"" and ""do you want to make 14 bucks the hard way?"").  Knight himself is a riot--""I've sentenced boys younger than yourself to the gas chamber.""  Even the dancing gopher is a great character.  On the whole, it's hard to imagine a better cast of characters.  Bill Murray is better than he was on most of his SNL skits and you could also say the same thing about Chevy Chase.  I'm very envious of Harold Ramis's talent as I don't know how this dialogue was ever created in the first place. The humor is so distilled that it lasts for nearly 100 minutes.

Caddyshack definitely falls in the latter catergory.

But, suprisingly enough, the movie takes these ingredients that usually signal a potential bomb and make it one of the funniest and most quotable movies of all time.  This is largely due to the inspired casting choices: Chevy Chase as a Golf Stud-...-amateur Buddhist philosopher Ty Webb, Rodney Dangerfield as a loudmouthed Real Estate salesman and Bill Murray as Karl the hapless groundskeeper.

I received it as a gift, and probably would not have bought it on my own. But that said, it is interesting and deeper than we may have thought.While it seems to be full of slapstick comedy, there are interesting aspects to it. The story seems to be attacking people who consider golf almost sacred, and people who think that because they belong to a club, they are above and beyond everyone else. (A doctor who is more worried about his golf scores than his patients, a judge who treats people quite contemptuously etc)On the other hand, we have characters like Chevy Chase who just enjoy golf, and don't need to beat anyone or play for money. We also have Danny (a caddy) who is trying to do his job to make a future for himself.Rodney Dangerfield is an interesting character who (in all his comedy)  carries the theme of the movie. (Especially when he calls the club a 'snobitaurium') And he seems to be fully aware that there is nothing sacred about a country club.It is also interesting that while the Judge is made to be the villain of the movie who hates everyone, he has some redeeming traits. (He loves his wife and is understandably hurt when Rodney makes a sexual business offer to her; he allows a student to clerk for him while he is finishing law school; and he is concerned when his friend, the Lutheran Bishop is drinking too much.) And to be fully honest, it is hard not to feel sorry for him when he comes home and finds his bed occupied by his niece and Danny. The judge is made out to be the bad guy in this story, but he is after all human.Another fine point worth mentioning is the gradual reconciliation of Danny and another caddy who have been at odds with each other from the start of the film. (Early on, they are ready to have a fist exchange; he takes some verbal shots at Danny throughout; but somehow, we never really hate him; and in the end, he is cheering Danny on at the final golf game.)The conflicts of ideology eventually lead up to an illegal  tournament. And rather than it appearing to be over who is the better golfer, somehow we get the impression that it is the ego driven players versus the more human players. (The final triumph avoids the cliche ending and instead offers a hilarious conclusion with a bang.)Granted, its not Shakespeare.

I am talking, of course, about Danny Noonan (Michael O' Keefe). As a matter of fact, the story seems to revolve around him more than anyone else.This film features Danny kissing up to Judge Smails in an attempt to get a caddy scholarship so he can go to law school. As the film goes through this story, a few new people get in. One of the other big roles is Al Czervik, who is very rich and has an ulterior motive to buy the country club. The other is Ty Webb, who plays mentor for Danny, and then there is Carl Spackler, who fanatically hunts a clever gopher.The move is excellent in itself, but do not expect it to be something random. Aside from Carl Spackler and the gopher, most of the movie seems to play as a slow comedy. You know, it employs ridiculousness rather than insanity to make people laugh. It works for the most part, but there are times when it might get too slow for some people, especially in the beginning. The movie doesn't really pick up until the moment Rodney Dangerfield appears, which is a little less than 20 minutes into the film, but it felt like an hour to me.Anyway, this film has very few problems. Dangerfield is fantastic as the rich, vulgar swinger and Murray is excellent as the fanatical groundskeeper. Knight is very good at being the snobby rich man who doesn't like Dangerfield and, except for a few flaws, Keefe is great as the kid who needs a scholarship. My only complaint lies with Chase and Cindy Morgan, actually. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Chevy Chase, but aside from a few lines, I didn't really think he was that funny in the movie. Concerning Morgan, she didn't seem to play any big role either. All she seemed to do was get a few people in trouble with Judge Smails and then disappear until she wanted to get another person in trouble.Aside from those two, I can't say there is much to complain about. The scenes were great, the comedy was expertly done, and the atmosphere was well made.

I somehow had never managed to see this movie, so I figured it was about time.I was sorely disappointed.  While it certainly had some funny moments, there simply weren't enough of them.  One can perhaps forgive Harold Ramis since it's his first picture, but you'd never know this was the genius who would later deliver Groundhog Day and Analyze This.Chevy Chase's character is odd and cool, and certainly a cut above the stupid slapstick roles he'd get later, but ultimately not interesting enough to hold the picture.  Rodney Dangerfield plays, well, himself, but if you really want to see him do his fish-out-of-water thing, he's better in Back to School.  Ted Knight chews the scenery so badly it will make you wince with pain.As for the actual storyline...well, there's no *there* there.  It follows the old porn standby of using just enough of a plot to tie the beginning to the end, in the hopes that the comedy will be enough.  In some movies, it is, but not this one.  Too much of the humor is puerile and doesn't elicit more than a chuckle or two.  Slapstick can be hilarious, but it isn't here.  The Baby Ruth scene -- revered by so many -- mystifies me.  Is there some hidden second joke that I don't see, or is all the fuss really about a candy bar in a pool that looks like, well, doody?  Har har har.

Hamlow,"[4, 4]","When I first saw the previews on HBO, it was to see Mr. Gopher, that wascally wodent, and yes, I'm ashamed to admit it, but to see Lacey Underall in action.  Hey, gimme a break!  I was thirteen, okay?  I'm not attracted by that type anymore.As for Mr. Gopher, he becomes the target of Carl (Bill Murray), the assistant groundskeeper, who is something of a basket case.  He has funny monologues with himself, watches the elderly woman golfers and mutters things with ... undertones, and seems to be living in his own little world.The previews described this as the slobs against the snobs.  Well, Judge Smales (Ted Knight), Dr. Beeper, and the bishop definitely fit the latter.  They try to keep certain people from becoming members, and are clearly the elite class.  Result, they turn Bushwood into what Al Czervik calls a ""crummy snobatorium.""  As Smales snidely tells off caddy Danny Noonan, who is unsure what to do with his life, but is aspiring for the caddy scholarship, ""Well, the world needs ditchdiggers.""  His attitude changes when Noonan saves the judge from a golf mishap, but hey, as Czervik tells him, ""Who made you pope of this dump?""The laid back Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) is probably the one who's got the best philosophy to golf, just to play it.  There's even a parodic reference to a certain George Lucas movie, when he tells Danny ""There's a force in the world that makes things happen, and all you have to do is get in touch with it.""  Let's see, three years after... that'd be right.  And I sincerely doubt that Matsuo Basho said this quote attributed to him by Ty, or if he did, it must have been in some very obscure renga verse of his:  ""A flute with no hole is not a flute, and a donut with no hole is a Danish.""In contrast, there's Al Czervik, a rich, loudmouthed, snazzily-dressed, life-of-the-party type who is full of jokes, wisecracks, and whether you like him depends on how uptight or laid back you are.  At dinner, check out his rapid-fire delivery, ""My compliments to the cook, this is low-grade dog food.  The steak still has marks where the jockey was hitting it.""  He then makes a funny face as he passes gas, and asks, ""Oh!  Someone step on a duck?""  His table dissolves with laughter.  However, when an uptight man next to him fails to laugh, Czervik says, ""The graveyard's two blocks to the left.""  Judge Smales taken an immediate dislike to Al, especially as the latter constantly needles him until he explodes in a temper.The swimming pool scene is notable for the Busby Berkeley parody number, the usual party-like hijinks in the pool, and whenever I see Baby Ruths at my local store, I inwardly snicker--no pun intended.  Although the next time I'm near a swimming pool...hmm, why not?  With a candy bar, not what it was thought... never mind!Dangerfield gets the best laughs and hands-down steals the movie as Al Czervik.  Sure, he's got a big mouth and is an instant insult machine, but it's towards the uptight snobs.  He also doesn't care too much for the club rules.  Anytime I hear Journey's ""Any Way You Want It"", I think of this movie.  And love his hi-tech gadgets! ""Einstein sold me this golf club.  Nice man--made a fortune in physics.""As for blonde Cindy Morgan (Lacey), okay, she only has one topless scene, but I've seen better looking models than her.  And although the chittering, squeaking Chuck E. Rodent, who apparently loves swaying to Kenny Loggins' theme song ""I'm Alright,"" clearly does not resemble a real gopher for laughs, he is to Bugs Bunny as Carl is to Elmer Fudd.Much of the movie relies on Rodney Dangerfield's funny lines, Ty's deadpan quips, and some cartoon-style hijinks involving Mr. Gopher.  In other words, classic 80's humor.  But Danny Noonan's quest to find himself is a major part of this movie.

108708,A2GYX971VETQBV,0790741105,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[1, 4]","If you like golf, or know someone who does, you will probably get a kick out of ""Caddyshack.""  Interestingly enough, what starts out as a film focused upon the lives of various caddies at an exclusive country club becomes a film about the various golfers (fleshed out by a very strong cast).  Chevy Chase is, hands down, my favorite actor in the film.  His slapstick humor is right on the money in ""Caddyshack.""  I get tired of certain characters, noticeably Dangerfield and Murray, but there is enough interest in the subplots to keep the film on its feet.  Many of the scenes seem to be half-improvised and yet it does not fall apart as one might expect.The truly enjoyable effect of this movie is what will happen in the next couple of days after watching it.  If you have any knack for remembering lines, you will be quoting it to yourself constantly.  This film provides a ton of one-liners that are remarkably peculiar and hilarious.

108709,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0790741105,Darren,"[0, 0]","Part of an unconnected quartet of comedies from 79 to 84 that involved Ivan Reitman, Harold Ramis, and Bill Murray in varying degrees:  ""Meatballs"", this one, ""Stripes"", and ""Ghostbusters"".  This one is, if you'll pardon the golf-related pun, the weakest link by far of the bunch.I think the problem is Reitman's absence.  Apparently Reitman was able to rein in actors; he certainly knew how to pace a film and give it tension.  ""Caddyshack"" was Harold Ramis' first job in the director's chair, and it shows: the tension is slack, there is far too much improvisation, and there's a lack of focus both in narrative and theme.  As far as the improv goes, one gets the sense that Chase, Dangerfield, and even Murray just sort of steamrolled Ramis.  I'm sure it was a fun set to be on -- perhaps too much fun.  (Ted Knight was deeply irritated by the chaos.)  Consider Dangerfield's last line of dialogue that closes the curtain on the movie:  ""Everyone's gonna get l--d!""  What does that even mean?  Why?  Because Michael O'Keefe won the golf match?  Reitman -- and a later Harold Ramis -- wouldn't have permitted that to make the cut.  Earlier, Chase and O'Keefe are on the green while playing the climactic match, and Chase starts doing a painfully unfunny bit about, well, who knows:  ""May!  Make it!  Make it!"" or something like that.  All improvised, based on an earlier bit about ""Being the ball.""  A clearly irritated O'Keefe improvises back, ""Take it easy.""  Why did this make the cut?  As far as the lack of narrative and thematic focus goes: it's easy to forget that the movie is supposed to be centered on O'Keefe's caddy character, and that the story is fundamentally about class conflict, as remembered by co-writers Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill's brother, ""Lou"" the caddyshack boss in the movie) and Ramis, both of whom worked as caddies as kids.  I think it's also supposed to critique the different manifestations of American wealth, from the old snobs who inhabit country clubs like ancient pieces of furniture to the nouveau riche gatecrashers like Dangerfield who want to pave the surrounding area with parking lots, condominiums, and shopping malls.  But all this gets lost amidst the rehearsal of Dangerfield's standup routine, Chase's mumbled ramblings, and Murray's epic battle with a cute gopher puppet.  Everyone equally vies for our attention, with the result that we don't know whom or what to pay attention to.  Let it be said at once that Ramis would not repeat these rookie mistakes in later films.  After all, this is the man who went on to write and direct the greatest American comedy -- and one of the best American movies, period -- ever made, ""Groundhog Day"".  But we all gotta start somewhere, and the learning process is painfully evident here.I think a lot of the positive reviews here are from aging Gen-Xers like me who associate ""Caddyshack"" fondly with their youth.  It has not held up, in my judgment.  I don't think I cracked a smile once while watching it just now, and it's not because I'd seen it so many times before.  (I recently enjoyed ""Stripes"" on a re-watch, so gimme a break.)  But let's not mistake nostalgia for honest criticism, shall we?  I'd recommend to Millennials who haven't seen this yet to skip it and instead watch ""Meatballs"", ""Stripes"", or ""Ghostbusters"" from this period, made by most of the same folks.  So why 2 stars instead of 1?  The second star is reserved solely for Bill Murray's immortal line while describing what he supposedly said to the Dalai Lama while caddying for him in the Himalayas: ""Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know.""

108710,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0790741105,David Baldwin,"[2, 4]","With the passing of Rodney Dangerfield this week now is a good time to revisit his film debut(and probably his best film appearance).  It's interesting that Rodney does not portray the ""no respect"" character made famous in his stand-up routines but a brassy nouveau riche contractor who takes no guff from anybody at the snooty country club.  But he does it well.  It's also interesting that years later Rodney was denied a SAG card because the guild did not think that Rodney""sufficiently stretched himself as an artist"" despite numerous successful screen appearances.  Talk about no respect.  But ""Caddyshack"" is an ensemble piece but the older performers shine infinitely more than the younger cast assembled here(except for Chevy Chase who seems to be sleepwalking through the movie, but then, Chase sleepwalked through alot of his films).  Bill Murray shines in particularly as Carl the groundskeeper whether he is discussing the time he caddied for the Dalai Lama or persuing the elusive gopher.  The scenes with the gopher have become so much a part of our vernacular that Tiger Woods recently parodied them for a television commercial.

Although not overtly funny, both Chevy Chase and Ted Knight play straight men to two funny comedians: Chase's character to Bill Murray's wacky, doped-out greenskeeper character. An example here is during the scene when Chase is visiting Murray's residential quarters, and Murray offers Chase a place to sit and relax, and Chase says: &quot;No thanks, I don't want to stick to anything&quot;. Knight and Rodney &quot;I get no respect&quot; Dangerfield have some classic exchanges throughout the movie as well. You'll have to hear them for yourself.  #2) Dangerfield is a class act all by himself in &quot;Caddyshack&quot;. With comical lines like &quot;Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it&quot;, &quot;Now I know why tigers eat their young&quot;, &quot;Hey toots, how'd you like to earn ten dollars the hard way&quot; and many others, it's easy to see why Dangerfield became a mega-superstar soon after &quot;Caddyshack&quot; was released. #3) There's also the Baby Ruth bar in the swimming pool bit, which is a must see. If you ask me, the Rodney Dangerfield barbs are alone worth the price of this classic film. Kenny Loggins' smash hit &quot;I'm Alright&quot; is a perfect mini-soundtrack for the movie. As an added bonus, there is a trailer before the movie. You'll hear from the stars themselves talk about the making of &quot;Caddyshack&quot; as well as personal moments and their memories in making this comedy masterpiece.

Judge Smails meets his nemesis in the uncouth Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), who's thinking of buying the club. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) is a rich playboy who refuses to take anything seriously and is full of skewed advice for Danny, who he takes under his wing.And then there's Carl Spackler (Bill Murray), the assistant groundskeeper who's tasked with killing the golfers... er... gophers.This is such a classic comedy. I was surprised at how long it had been since I'd seen it, because so many of the scenes remained so vivid--the Baby Ruth bar in the pool, ""see the ball, be the ball,"" the multiple attacks on the gophers.I was about to say that this was a comedy without a message, but I realized it's not, really--it's about pretension.

But when I saw this in the theater in 1980, all I did was just shake my head wondering what the hell was everybody laughing at? Goofy, unrealistic & cartoonish characters with very few clever gags on display here.Back in the late 70s and early 80s, the first string Not Ready For Primetime Players from SNL tried to get on a roll in the wake of the mega-success of Animal House with some successes (The Blues Brothers) and a lot of failures. This one falls into the latter in my opinion. Mostly just a bunch of random juvenile gags strung together into a far from cohesive plot involving an adolescent underachiever (O'Keefe) trying to make way for college while working at a snobby country club.About 90% percent of the gags just simply don't work, however, the Baby Ruth candybar IS a good one. And Rodney Dangerfield does manage to carry the bulk of what laughs there are. But that's really it! Chevy Chase and Bill Murray are just pathetic, their one scene together going on about smoking golfcourse grass from what I've heard was more or less improvised with zero results. Ted Knight just basically reprises his Ted Baxter role from The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the stiff upper-crust judge running the country club.Sorry folks, but this one just didn't do it for me.

The entire cast contributed heavily to the movie, a rarity in ""mega-star"" mega movies.The movie works best if you are inebriated or just plain stoned, although it was so well-crafted that you could (in theory) watch it with your straight-laced friends and still get quite a few laughs out of them. The movie in unabashedly sophomoric, (ala Animal House, and the later Back to School). It is a classic comedy because it succeeded where so many imitations fail: They actually hired professional writers - and (get this) paid them!

108760,A319SKSB556033,0790741105,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[7, 9]","So now you've got that going for you, which is nice.Inspired by Brian Doyle-Murray's experiences as a caddy in his youth, this wild, anarchic film is about more than just golf. Without a doubt, it's my favorite comedy, and might even be one of the greatest movies of all time. There is not a single scene without comedic chaos.Director Harold Ramis is barely able to contain the insanity. There is honestly so much in Caddyshack, there's enough for ten movies, hardly surprising since the first draft of the screenplay was 199 pages long while the first cut of the film run for 310 minutes. I imagine that there's enough cut out to make whole new Caddyshack movies. There are about five different plots developing at once throughout the movie, the funniest of which is Carl Spackler's (having been licensed to kill by the 'Government of the United Nations') attempts to assassinate a rogue gopher tearing up the golf course.Each and every actor battles with each other, and it's hard to nail down exactly who runs away with the movie, but if I absolutely HAD to choose, I'd say that Rodney Dangerfield's sleazy, slobbish, overly-friendly, and gratuitously tipping character is the most wonderful thing about it. He is the perfect foil for Judge Smails (an utterly perfectly-cast Ted Knight), a pompous, bad-tempered, self-important hypocrite who wants to reserve the pretentious Bushwood Country Club for snobs and gentlemen (despite being far from a gentleman himself).If you like comedy quotes, Caddyshack is a goldmine. There are hundreds, literally hundreds, of lines worthy of repeating in real life. You could literally get by, from cradle to the grave, just quoting Caddyshack, and it would bring you nothing but pure happiness and good fortune.The Blu Ray features a 1080p 1.78:1 picture that is a HUUUUGE step-up from the DVD, with DTS HD-MA sound, and loads of extras.",5,"If you love this film, when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total conciousness",1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,1878,"['So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'going', 'nice.Inspired', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'experiences', 'caddy', 'youth', 'wild', 'anarchic', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'golf', 'doubt', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'not', 'single', 'scene', 'comedic', 'chaos.Director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'barely', 'able', 'contain', 'insanity', 'honestly', 'so', 'much', 'Caddyshack', 'enough', 'ten', 'movies', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'first', 'draft', 'screenplay', 'was', '199', 'pages', 'long', 'first', 'cut', 'film', 'run', '310', 'minutes', 'imagine', 'enough', 'cut', 'make', 'whole', 'new', 'Caddyshack', 'movies', 'are', 'five', 'different', 'plots', 'developing', 'once', 'movie', 'funniest', 'Carl', 'Spackler', 'having', 'been', 'licensed', 'kill', ""'Government"", 'United', 'Nations', 'attempts', 'assassinate', 'rogue', 'gopher', 'tearing', 'up', 'golf', 'course.Each', 'actor', 'other', 'hard', 'nail', 'down', 'exactly', 'who', 'away', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'HAD', 'choose', ""'d"", 'say', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'sleazy', 'slobbish', 'overly-friendly', 'gratuitously', 'tipping', 'character', 'most', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'utterly', 'perfectly-cast', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'pompous', 'bad-tempered', 'self-important', 'hypocrite', 'who', 'reserve', 'pretentious', 'Bushwood', 'Country', 'Club', 'snobs', 'gentlemen', 'being', 'far', 'gentleman', '.If', 'comedy', 'quotes', 'Caddyshack', 'goldmine', 'are', 'hundreds', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'lines', 'worthy', 'repeating', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'literally', 'get', 'cradle', 'grave', 'just', 'quoting', 'Caddyshack', 'would', 'bring', 'nothing', 'pure', 'happiness', 'good', 'fortune.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', '1080p', '1.78:1', 'picture', 'HUUUUGE', 'step-up', 'DVD', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', 'sound', 'loads', 'extras']",N/A

What Caddyshack boils down to is the right cast and the right script at the right time. The cast is unrivaled. Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray and Ted Knight give Caddyshack an ensemble feel. Ted Knight's Judge Smails is my personal favorite as the ultra right wing conservative judge. Some of his lines are hilarious:Danny: ""I was hoping to go to college but unfortunately it looks like my parents aren't going to be able to afford to send me""Judge Smails: ""Well, the world needs ditch diggers too""ORSpaulding: ""I want a hamburger, no a cheeseburger, I want french fries...""Judge Smails: ""YOU'LL GET NOTHING AND LIKE IT!!!""Rodney Dangerfield turns in a star-making performance as Al Czervik, a crude, crass construction developer who upsets the balance of power at Bushwood by bringing his blue collar ways with him. Dangerfield is the KING of one-liners:Al: ""Hey honey you must have been something before electricity...How'd you like to make 14 bucks the hard way""ORAl: ""Hey Wang, what's with the pictures its a parking lot...Wang, I think this is a restricted club so don't tell 'em you're Jewish.""ORAl: ""Oh, this is worst looking hat, I've ever seen, I mean you buy a hat like that you ought to get a free bowl of soup with it...(looking at Smails who is wearing the hat)...but it looks good on you""Chevy Chase and Bill Murray are hilarious. Murray's Carl Spackler may be the most quoted sports movie character of all-time. Chase's Ty Webb has some great one-liners too, but my favorite scene with him is during the final match when Ty puts his arm around Judge Smails and starts blowing in his ear. As you can tell, I could go on and on about this movie it's just that good. The bottom line for Caddyshack is this: BUY IT, WATCH IT (REPEATEDLY) and WORSHIP IT.

This film stands strong as one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie(s) from the 80s.Chevy Chase plays Ty Webb, an intelligent, experienced, mindless golfer that doesn't believe in playing for money. He has several uncashed checks for astounding amounts laying around his house from tournaments he's won. He truly believes that golf is a sport within itself, and though he never talks of it, he thinks it's a mockery to take money for the sport.Ted Knight plays ""Judge"", the course owner and he's a rather snobbish ""we'll have no nonsense"" in all seriousness type of guy. It's funny to see what happens to him at the end of the film.Rodney Dangerfield plays Al Cervick, a filthy rich landowner who just can't keep you from rolling on the floor laughing your socks off. He barges into Bushwood acting like he owns the place, and when he meets the Judge (Ted Knight), all heck breaks loose and Ted has a grudge for him. With comments likeAl: ""I'll bet you a hundred bucks you slice it into the woods""Judge: ""Gambling is Illegal at Bushwood...  ...and I never slice""*whoosh* (slice)Al: ""Okay, you can owe me!""and""If you run a business like that, you'll end up with nothing but a popcorn fart, ya know?""*lifts leg* *brrrrrrrrrnnnn* (farts)*looks around*  ""what, did somebody step on a duck?""Rodney just leaves you laughing until you pass out!Bill Murray plays the Carl the Greenskeeper, a rather weird guy who talks to himself all the time and spends his free time hitting posies with a weed wacker and staring at elderly women. When he's not spending time dazing around, he's chasing a gopher that tears up the golf course, and it's his job on the line if he doesn't get rid of it. He also grows his own grass that you can go ""nightputting on, and when you're done, take it home and get stoned to the bajeebers on it"". Without Carl, this film certainly would be a different one.The DVD itself is also pretty neat...it has interactive menus and plenty of options to explore. The commentary is neat, you should check it out sometime...you learn alot about the film that isn't known by many people.I have absolutely no clue why this movie has a four star rating.

Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, who ironically had an on-going rivalry with Chase after Murray replaced him on SNL, the two even had an 'altercation' in the NBC Studio halls in New York prior to Murray taking the stage. What Caddyshack did is take the sports genre and throw in a lot of goofy screwball comedy, resulting in brilliance measured in hilarity. This is a favorite in the comedy genre by many people of this generation and generations of all time. This film was released at the opening period of the SNL comedies right after the likes of Animal House (John Belushi), The Jerk (Steve Martin) and The Blues Brothers (Dan Aykroyd).Again another brainchild of the SNL alumni but this time following in the footsteps of John Landis, director of both Animal House and The Blues Brothers, Harold Ramis, later to be in another comedic phenom (Ghostbusters with pals Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray) carried directing duty of this comedy. Another R rated comedy, this film inspired and innovated the raunch comedy genre and has become a staple in the genre and is still oft quoted and referenced. This is also the kind of movie that has an extremely high re-watch factor, you could literally watch it over and over. You have to appreciate the little things in movies like this of past eras where CG was only a dream.

And, of course, there was drinking - lots of it.  At the time, I thought CADDYSHACK was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen.Last night, my husband and I watched CADDYSHACK for the first time in about 25 years.  True, Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Chevy Chase all turn in outstanding, zany comic performances.  There are many scenes that have become classics, and many jokes that still elicit a loud chuckle and the occasional guffaw.  But all these years later, the humor struck us both as juvenile and crude, the plot as mindless, and the sex as, well, gratuitous and tasteless.Clearly, CADDYSHACK is a cult flick that has not aged well for the general audience.

The extras include the documentary ""The 19th Hole"", with interviews, outtakes, and deleted scenes, which is really well done, plus the excellent trailer. This disc should be in any comedy fan's colection, along with the sequel.CADDYSHACK(1980, R)Ty Webb: Chevy ChaseAl Czervik: Rodney DangerfieldJudge Elihu Smails: Ted KnightDanny Noonan: Michael O'KeefeCarl Spackler: Bill MurrayMaggie O'Hooligan: Sarah HolcombDirector: Harold RamisWriters: Brian Doyle-Murray, Harold Ramis, Douglas KenneyMOVIE: 5VIDEO: 5AUDIO: 5EXTRAS: 5MENUS: 5OVERALL: 5",5,"Caddyshack: The DVD with balls!

I have to say, after my boyfriend getting the HD, and re-watching it, I've changed my mind and deleted my old review. If you didn't like it first time round, I suggest you give it another whirl, because for me, it was better second time round. But strangely enough, first time round, I felt there should be more of Bill Murray, but second time, he did irritate me slightly.If you're not a Chevy Chase fan, he's not in this much. Which is actually quite surprising, as he is the best known of the cast. I was actually hoping he'd be in it more, because he is funny. I never did think that before, but I must admit, I did NOT get his sense of humour, and it's something I struggle with. Him & Bill both have very dry, deadpan sense of humour, and normally I prefer Bill. There's some sort of animosity between the pair off screen (probably a Paris & Nicole kind of animosity) and the one scene where they appear together, is so awkward, it's practically unwatchable. The two, who should be great friends, hate each other, and it's obvious on screen. But they do talk pure crap when they're on screen together.The gopher (NOT a mole, as I occasionally think) is definitely the highlight of the movie, and so cute. It's absolutely adorable, and all the scenes underground are surprisingly well shot. It dances when it hears music, it gets high, and it laughs. Where can I buy one of these?Caddyshack takes pot shots at every level from the class system to sex, religion, and bodily functions. No joke is too far, and no candybar is too gross to eat when it's been at the bottom of the swimming pool. These days, with Adam Sandler, and the American Pies of the world, it's all been done before, and there's something slightly sick about it all. Can you imagine Chevy humping an apple pie just for viewers pleasure? No? Didn't think so.It can be a bit hard to keep track of what subplot is going on at what time, with the film bouncing between a number of different characters, but I get the feeling I'll never fully follow Caddyshack. It's a film about golf after all. But each character has something different to bring to the film. Ted Knight's character, Judge Smails, has hilarious mannerisms, and a contagious laugh, which made me smile every time. Michael O'Keefe aka Danny Noonan, wants some time away from his madcap family, is quite loveable, but still very much a teenage boy. Rodney Dangerfield plays Al, who is quite possibly the scene-stealer, as you wonder who he is going to insult next.People rave about this film, and my boyfriend can quote lines from it on cue, but what you have to remember, is it's ultimately a movie about golf. A sport that I will never understand. I see guys I used to know from school, going to play golf, so it's not just the old men it appeals to. I don't understand the appeal, and if it hadn't been about golf, yes it could have been way better. But ultimately, a film about golf won't appeal to me. Not even if Johnny Depp or Keanu Reeves was in it.",3,"""Then how do you measure yourself with other golfers?""

108823,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0790741105,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 2]","In 1980, audiences were introduced to the world of exclusive country clubs in the hilarious comedy &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, which was the first film that Harold Ramis ever directed.  (He also co-wrote the film with Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney.)  The film's story intertwines the lives of various people at different rungs of the social ladder at the fictitious Bushwood Country Club.At the top of the social ladder are the club's elite members, which include Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), Judge Smails (Ted Knight) and his wife Mrs. Smails (Lois Kibbee).  Though he is somewhat cavalier and irreverent, Ty is a superb golfer whose skills are envied by many of the other club members, including Judge Smails.  With far less impressive golfing ability, the pompous and arrogant Judge Smails focuses much of his attention on maintaining the club's elite standards for membership.  Next are the people attempting to join the exclusive club, which include the loud &amp; obnoxious Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) and his associate Mr. Wang (Dr. Pow).  From the time they first meet, Al and Judge Smails do not like each other and Judge Smails becomes determined to prevent Al from attaining club membership.  Next are the young caddies, which include Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) and Tony D'Annunzio (Scott Colomby).  A teenage rivalry exists between Danny &amp; Tony who both aspire to be accepted one day by the club's elite.  Danny's girlfriend, Maggie O'Hooligan (Sarah Holcomb), works as a waitress at a club snackbar.  Finally, at the bottom rung is one the club's groundskeepers: the unattractive, unkempt, and unintelligent Carl Spackler (Bill Murray), who becomes obsessed with the killing of a single gopher that is damaging the club's greens (but also likes to dance).It is doubtful that a better cast could have been used in &quot;Caddyshack&quot; than Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray.  Each actor portrayed his character effectively and humorously.  Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include Carl watching several women golfing from a distance, the meeting of Al &amp; Judge Smails in the country club's pro shop, Danny attempting to impress Judge Smails, the pool party, Carl cleaning the pool, Al driving his yacht, Judge Smails and his boat, Carl caddying during the thunderstorm, Carl using extreme measures on the gopher and the final golf tournament.Another memorable aspect of the film is the music.  Kenny Loggins composed and performed the film's theme song &quot;I'm Alright&quot;, which became a top-10 hit single in 1980, as well as two of the film's other songs, &quot;Lead the Way&quot; and &quot;Mr. Night&quot;.  Kenny Loggins went on to write songs for the films &quot;Footloose&quot; (1984, the title song &amp; &quot;I'm Free&quot;) and &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991, the song &quot;No Lookin' Back&quot;).  He continues to compose and perform his own albums.Overall, I rate &quot;Caddyshack&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars for being a well-written, engaging and hilarious comedy.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  Sadly, the 1988 sequel, &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, failed to attract most of the actors from the original film (Ted Knight passed away in 1986) and was a box office disaster in spite of a return appearance by Chevy Chase and additional writing from Harold Ramis.",4,&quot;Do you know what gophers can do to a golf course?&quot;,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,3355,"['1980', 'audiences', 'were', 'introduced', 'world', 'exclusive', 'country', 'clubs', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Caddyshack', 'quot', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'ever', 'directed', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'Douglas', 'Kenney', 'film', 'story', 'lives', 'various', 'people', 'different', 'rungs', 'social', 'ladder', 'fictitious', 'Bushwood', 'Country', 'Club.At', 'top', 'social', 'ladder', 'are', 'club', 'elite', 'members', 'include', 'Ty', 'Webb', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Smails', 'Lois', 'Kibbee', 'somewhat', 'cavalier', 'irreverent', 'Ty', 'superb', 'golfer', 'skills', 'are', 'envied', 'many', 'other', 'club', 'members', 'including', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'far', 'less', 'impressive', 'golfing', 'ability', 'pompous', 'arrogant', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'much', 'attention', 'maintaining', 'club', 'elite', 'standards', 'membership', 'are', 'people', 'attempting', 'join', 'exclusive', 'club', 'include', 'loud', 'amp', 'obnoxious', 'Al', 'Czervik', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'associate', 'Mr.', 'Wang', 'Dr.', 'Pow', 'time', 'first', 'meet', 'Al', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'do', 'not', 'other', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'becomes', 'determined', 'prevent', 'Al', 'attaining', 'club', 'membership', 'are', 'young', 'caddies', 'include', 'Danny', 'Noonan', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'Tony', ""D'Annunzio"", 'Scott', 'Colomby', 'teenage', 'rivalry', 'exists', 'Danny', 'amp', 'Tony', 'who', 'aspire', 'be', 'accepted', 'one', 'day', 'club', 'elite', 'Danny', 'girlfriend', 'Maggie', ""O'Hooligan"", 'Sarah', 'Holcomb', 'waitress', 'club', 'snackbar', 'Finally', 'bottom', 'rung', 'one', 'club', 'groundskeepers', 'unattractive', 'unkempt', 'unintelligent', 'Carl', 'Spackler', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'single', 'gopher', 'damaging', 'club', 'greens', 'also', 'dance', '.It', 'doubtful', 'better', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'quot', 'Caddyshack', 'quot', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'character', 'effectively', 'humorously', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'include', 'Carl', 'watching', 'several', 'women', 'golfing', 'distance', 'meeting', 'Al', 'amp', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'country', 'club', 'pro', 'shop', 'Danny', 'attempting', 'impress', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'pool', 'party', 'Carl', 'cleaning', 'pool', 'Al', 'driving', 'yacht', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'boat', 'Carl', 'caddying', 'thunderstorm', 'Carl', 'using', 'extreme', 'measures', 'gopher', 'final', 'golf', 'tournament.Another', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'film', 'music', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'composed', 'performed', 'film', 'theme', 'song', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Alright', 'quot', 'became', 'top-10', 'hit', 'single', '1980', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'film', 'other', 'songs', 'quot', 'Lead', 'Way', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Night', 'quot', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'went', 'write', 'songs', 'films', 'quot', 'Footloose', 'quot', '1984', 'title', 'song', 'amp', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Free', 'quot', 'quot', 'Thelma', 'amp', 'Louise', 'quot', '1991', 'song', 'quot', 'Lookin', 'Back', 'quot', 'compose', 'perform', 'own', 'albums.Overall', 'rate', 'quot', 'Caddyshack', 'quot', '4', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'well-written', 'engaging', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'Sadly', '1988', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Caddyshack', 'II', 'quot', 'failed', 'attract', 'most', 'actors', 'original', 'film', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'passed', 'away', '1986', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'disaster', 'spite', 'return', 'appearance', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'additional', 'writing', 'Harold', 'Ramis']",N/A

For some reason this is the most easily quoted and most quoted movie as far as I can tell.  Even the most mild fan can quote several lines from this movie without having watched it a hundred times like some of us die-hards.  There are just so many funny lines to quote, not just one-liners but also conversations.  It's quite remarkable.  A real phenomenon.  I doubt there will ever be another movie with this characteristic.I could go on that for another 15 minutes, but instead I'll convince you on why you shouldn't just rent this movie; you should BUY it, right now, even if you've never seen it.  It's quite funny.  There's just a lot of funny one-liners and even non-one liners that you can laugh at over and over and almost more importantly laugh over and over with your friends just TALKING about them!  You can seriously sit there and do back-to-back quotes with one another and keep laughing.  There's nothing like it.  And what's even better is if you're doing it in a group or crowd of people someone overhearing it is bound to know what you're talking about!  The events in the movie are funny too, such as when Judge Smails hurls his golf club.The characters are also all very funny.  You even like Judge Smails, the ""villain"" of the movie, who is played brilliantly by the late Ted Knight.  He makes a very good villain.  I thought Bill Murray was overrated in this movie, not to mention the gopher, but after watching him for a while he did some pretty funny stuff, such as staring at the old ladies golfing and talking to himself about how he's gonna kill the gopher.  My favorite is Rodney Dangerfield's character.  Rodney's always great and always steals the show because, well, he's Rodney!  He delivers plenty of his famous one-liner jokes, some of which even people with the ""high brow"" sense of humor can laugh at.The plot is easy enough to follow and isn't exactly ""complex"".  Hey, it's a comedy.  But in any case it suits the movie and I can't comlain.  It may get a little slow in the middle around the yacht club scene and all but it picks right up soon afterwards and you may not even find that part slower at all.  But the movie definitely keeps you interested, even when Rodney disappears for a while.All in all, a great movie.  Even if you're not a particular fan of any of the actors here you may like them or just not dislike them as much and the movie will keep your attention and keep you laughing.

The film's cast is like one generation of comedic talent merged with another. Chevy Chase is at the peak of his sarcastic-irreverent self as Ty Webb, the golf club founder's sometimes flippant, sometimes murky son. Bill Murray plays Carl, the greenskeeper who's seemingly one shy a full deck. But it's Rodney Dangerfield who steals the movie as no-class contractor Al Czervik, who dresses in loud clothes, has a golf bag equipped with a beer tap, T.V., stereo & remote control for his drivers, and generally makes a nuisance of himself with sharp one-liners. And the late Ted Knight is the perfect comic foil/villain for Dangerfield's antics as Judge Smails, a snobbish, combustible member with much wealth & influence. The film's main plot has to do with Michael O'Keefe's down-on-his-luck caddy Danny trying to schmooze a caddy scholarship out of the abusive Smails. However, this is the impetus which draws all these characters into the plot which leads to a ""big showdown/high stakes"" golf game. But this is only half of the film as first-time director Harold Ramis & writers take pleasure in veering off on goofy subplots: Murray's ""Cinderella story"" golf game; a priest playing the best game of his life in the middle of a raging storm; Dangerfield disrupting the green with funny stories, rock music, and illegal betting; Chase & Murray's strange encounter when Chase's ball slices into Murray's shed/home; the rowdy ""Caddy Day"" pool scene; Chase's funny/inept romancing of Smail's niece, Lacey Underall (what a name!); and, of course, Murray's demented battle with the dancing gopher who's destroying the green.Whether it's a physical comedy bit by Chase or a good one-liner by Dangerfield that you missed the first time around, ""Caddyshack"" is the type of comedy that you can watch again & still have a great time!",5,"The ""Animal House"" of golf!",1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,1933,"['predecessor', 'Caddyshack', 'crude', 'crass', 'sophomoric', 'so', 'fun', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'cast', 'one', 'generation', 'comedic', 'talent', 'merged', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'peak', 'sarcastic-irreverent', 'self', 'Ty', 'Webb', 'golf', 'club', 'founder', 'sometimes', 'flippant', 'sometimes', 'murky', 'son', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Carl', 'greenskeeper', 'who', 'seemingly', 'one', 'shy', 'full', 'deck', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'who', 'movie', 'no-class', 'contractor', 'Al', 'Czervik', 'who', 'loud', 'clothes', 'golf', 'bag', 'equipped', 'beer', 'tap', 'T.V.', 'stereo', 'remote', 'control', 'drivers', 'generally', 'nuisance', 'sharp', 'one-liners', 'late', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'perfect', 'comic', 'foil/villain', 'Dangerfield', 'antics', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'snobbish', 'combustible', 'member', 'much', 'wealth', 'influence', 'film', 'main', 'plot', 'do', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'down-on-his-luck', 'caddy', 'Danny', 'trying', 'schmooze', 'caddy', 'scholarship', 'abusive', 'Smails', 'However', 'impetus', 'characters', 'plot', 'big', 'showdown/high', 'stakes', 'golf', 'game', 'only', 'half', 'film', 'first-time', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'writers', 'take', 'pleasure', 'veering', 'off', 'goofy', 'subplots', 'Murray', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'golf', 'game', 'priest', 'playing', 'best', 'game', 'life', 'middle', 'raging', 'storm', 'Dangerfield', 'disrupting', 'green', 'funny', 'stories', 'rock', 'music', 'illegal', 'betting', 'Chase', 'Murray', 'strange', 'encounter', 'when', 'Chase', 'ball', 'Murray', 'shed/home', 'rowdy', 'Caddy', 'Day', 'pool', 'scene', 'Chase', 'funny/inept', 'romancing', 'Smail', 'niece', 'Lacey', 'Underall', 'what', 'name', 'course', 'Murray', 'demented', 'battle', 'dancing', 'gopher', 'who', 'destroying', 'green.Whether', 'physical', 'comedy', 'bit', 'Chase', 'good', 'one-liner', 'Dangerfield', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Caddyshack', 'type', 'comedy', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'time']",N/A

108847,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790741105,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","""National Lampoon's Animal House"" may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the ""Saturday Night Live"" generation, but it could be argued that ""Caddyshack,"" directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire ""SNL genre,"" of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative.  The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and ""kiss up"" a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him ""The world needs ditch diggers, too.""  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like ""Be the Ball,"" and ""A donut with no hole is a danish,"" may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" and ""Road Trip.""  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world.  But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the ""Cinderella Boy"" on the course at Atlanta.  This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And ""Caddyshack"" is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.

Everything gets off to a lively start, thanks to Kenny Loggins' singing of ""I'm Alright."" Most of the film is alright also. Rodney Dangerfield (as the rich and vulgar real estate developer Al Czervik) dominates every scene in which he appears as does Bill Murray (as neurotic/psychotic assistant groundskeeper Carl Spackler). In fact, they have very weak competition, with the possible exception of Ted Knight (as Judge Smails) for whom Czervik immediately becomes an infuriating nemesis. Ramis and his collaborators on the screenplay apparently could not decide on a primary plot so there really is none; rather, at least three different story lines, with the adversarial conversations between Smails and Czervik generating the most laughs. Spackler has his own adversarial relationship (with gophers) which also generates some sight gags. Meanwhile, Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) cannot obtain a caddy scholarship without self-important Judge Smails' approval and assistance. Meanwhile, Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) wanders in and out of various scenes with no apparent purpose in mind. Dangerfield's Czervik really is the gravitational center of the plot; the film generally sags when he's off-camera.

108864,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,0790741105,Rons Reviews,"[2, 2]","The new release on DVD, due out on Tuesday June 8th,2010 from Warner Home Video contains nothing new.  The packaging does not even indicate an anniversary is at hand. The Blu-ray, also due out on the 8th, includes a comprehensive feature-length 30th-anniversary documentary with the movie's cast and creators, but the DVD is left with only the retrospective featurette ""The 19th Hole"" which was included in the previous three releases (2000, 2006, 2007).Yes, it has been thirty years since the classic comedy in which a group of outrageous characters converge on Bushwood Country Club hit theatres.  Caddyshack garners the status of ""Classic"" solely for its performances.  Combining the talents of Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray, and Ted Knight, with the writing and performance of Brian Doyle Murray, and the direction and writing of a young Harold Ramis, ultimately resulted in golden performance and lines of dialog still widely recognized and often referenced today.What started as a coming of age story revolving around young caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) turned into an outrageous collection of comedy scenes when the above mentioned talent signed onto the project.  Unfortunately that did happen at the expense of storytelling, but this was quite common in the late seventies and early eighties, and it certain cases such as Caddyshack, the comedic segments are strong enough to carry a ninety-eight minute outing.For those not yet equipped with Blu-ray technology, there is no way to know what new information is included in the 30th anniversary documentary.  Nonetheless, ""The 19th Hole"" presents wonderful insight into the making of the film.  The featurette delves into the details of the scene between Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, touts the talents of the late Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight, discusses the contributions of Murray through improvisation during the six days he worked on the film, and provides great detail from writer and director Harold Ramis who is not afraid to convey the youthful energy that guided him through many mistakes often made by young directors.  Questions are answered, myths are corrected, and footage not included in the film is shown.  There is even a mention made to a scene which appears in cut of the film shown on television that did not appear in the theatrical version, and is thus, not on the new DVD release.Recommendation:  Caddyshack looks and sounds great here, ""The 19th Hole"" is a solid documentary, and the memorable performances of the stars are complimented by a great supporting cast including: Cindy Morgan, Scott Colomby, Sarah Holcomb, and many more.There is no denying that viewing Caddyshack will make most laugh weather you are watching it for the hundredth time, or experience it for the first time.  Yes, the humor can be cheap at times, but the performances are strong.  If a candy bar being mistaken for fecal matter does not make you smile, you are still likely to chuckle at the pompous portrayal of Judge Smails by the legendary Ted Knight.  Though the nudity in the theatrical version may rule out the young, generally there is something here for everyone; everyone except those who have purchased the DVD in the last ten years.  In that case there is nothing here for you.",3,Caddyshack 30th Anniversary Edition Fails to Make the Cut; at least on DVD.,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,3275,"['new', 'release', 'DVD', 'due', 'out', 'Tuesday', 'June', '8th,2010', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'nothing', 'new', 'packaging', 'not', 'even', 'indicate', 'anniversary', 'hand', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'due', 'out', '8th', 'comprehensive', 'feature-length', '30th-anniversary', 'documentary', 'movie', 'cast', 'creators', 'DVD', 'left', 'only', 'retrospective', 'featurette', '19th', 'Hole', 'was', 'included', 'previous', 'three', 'releases', '2000', '2006', '2007', '.Yes', 'been', 'thirty', 'years', 'classic', 'comedy', 'group', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'converge', 'Bushwood', 'Country', 'Club', 'hit', 'theatres', 'Caddyshack', 'status', 'Classic', 'solely', 'performances', 'Combining', 'talents', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'writing', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Doyle', 'Murray', 'direction', 'writing', 'young', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'ultimately', 'resulted', 'golden', 'performance', 'lines', 'dialog', 'still', 'widely', 'recognized', 'often', 'referenced', 'today.What', 'started', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'revolving', 'young', 'caddy', 'Danny', 'Noonan', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'turned', 'outrageous', 'collection', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'when', 'above', 'mentioned', 'talent', 'signed', 'project', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'happen', 'expense', 'storytelling', 'was', 'quite', 'common', 'late', 'seventies', 'early', 'eighties', 'certain', 'cases', 'such', 'Caddyshack', 'comedic', 'segments', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'ninety-eight', 'minute', 'outing.For', 'not', 'yet', 'equipped', 'Blu-ray', 'technology', 'way', 'know', 'what', 'new', 'information', 'included', '30th', 'anniversary', 'documentary', 'Nonetheless', '19th', 'Hole', 'presents', 'wonderful', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'featurette', 'details', 'scene', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'talents', 'late', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'contributions', 'Murray', 'improvisation', 'six', 'days', 'worked', 'film', 'great', 'detail', 'writer', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'convey', 'youthful', 'energy', 'guided', 'many', 'mistakes', 'often', 'made', 'young', 'directors', 'Questions', 'are', 'answered', 'myths', 'are', 'corrected', 'footage', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'shown', 'even', 'mention', 'made', 'scene', 'cut', 'film', 'shown', 'television', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'theatrical', 'version', 'thus', 'not', 'new', 'DVD', 'release.Recommendation', 'Caddyshack', 'great', 'here', '19th', 'Hole', 'solid', 'documentary', 'memorable', 'performances', 'stars', 'are', 'complimented', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'Scott', 'Colomby', 'Sarah', 'Holcomb', 'many', 'denying', 'viewing', 'Caddyshack', 'will', 'make', 'most', 'weather', 'are', 'watching', 'hundredth', 'time', 'experience', 'first', 'time', 'Yes', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'cheap', 'times', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'candy', 'bar', 'being', 'mistaken', 'fecal', 'matter', 'not', 'make', 'smile', 'are', 'still', 'likely', 'chuckle', 'pompous', 'portrayal', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'legendary', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'nudity', 'theatrical', 'version', 'may', 'rule', 'young', 'generally', 'something', 'here', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'who', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'case', 'nothing', 'here']",N/A

It has a special place because it was the best movie available for many months, so we watched it many times, and not just for the T and A!  Caddyshack is a romantic comedy but there is allot more comedy than romance.  A teenager, Danny Noonan, needs to win the caddy tournament to be able to afford college.  He works as a caddy at Bushwood, a &quot;snobatorium&quot; according to perspective member Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), a self made millionaire real-estate baron, who is loud, full of wisecracks and doesn't always follow the rules.  Bushwood has all the stereotypical rich:  Judge Smales (Ted Knight), who runs Bushwood, Dr. Beeper (Dan Risen), and the bishop.  The struggles between Judge Smales and Czervik are the real plot of the movie which climaxes with a golf match for money.Danny caddies for Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), a very wacky, rich, bachelor, and learns a few valuable lessons about golf, like &quot;There's a force in the universe that makes things happen. And all you have to do is get in touch with it, stop thinking, let things happen, and be the ball.&quot;  Golf at Bushwood is not getting any better because a gopher has tunneled in from Czervik's construction site across from the club.  The assistant groundskeeper Carl Sparkler's (Bill Murray) job to get rid of the gopher and throughout the movie his attempts are thwarted due to the gopher's superior intellect.This movie is loaded with scenes that are sitcoms in themselves, such as the scene where Ty plays through Carl's &quot;pad&quot; (one of the storage sheds on the course), has a few hits on some home brew and weed (rumor is the entire scene is adlib).  The swimming pool scene is a classic (&quot;Everyone out of the pool!&quot;), as well as the final drudge match at the end.

108871,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,0790741105,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","""Caddyshack"" combines terrific comic writing, a top-notch cast at the top of its game, and America's love affair with the silly game of golf to form comedy gold.Using the most cliched plotlines imaginable (the ""cools versus the rules,"" and ""the little guy needs to find his way in life""), ""Caddyshack"" nevertheless breaks a lot of new ground with its timeless characters.  Chevy Chase plays golf-stuf/playboy Ty Webb, who mangles philosophy while performing dazzling golf feats on the Bushwood Country Club course -- yes, the name ""Bushwood"" is revealing.  Chase has never been better than in this film, and it's almost sad to see how phenomenal he once was when you stand this performance next to the dreck he's put out in recent years.The underappreciated Ted Knight plays Webb's nemesis, Judge Smails, an uptight petty aristocrat who plays essentially the same role as Dean Wermer in ""Animal House.""  Smails is Elmer Fudd to Webb's Bugs Bunny.Rodney Dangerfield is also in the film, playing essentially himself as an obnoxious real estate developer with zero fashion sense -- ask ten people to name the character Dangerfield plays in ""Caddyshack,"" and you'll stump ten people.  But it's likely that most of those ten will be able to quote Dangerfield's character: ""Lovely boy -- now I now why tigers eat their young!""  ""You're a caddy, huh -- for Italians, this is skilled labor.""  ""This is the ugliest hat I've ever seen, I bet when you buy this they give you a can of soup . . . but it looks good on you, though.""And last but not least, the immortal Bill Murray plays Carl the Groundskeeper.  Carl is charged with ridding Bushwood of a gopher, a varmint who loves nothing more than vandalizing golf courses and dancing to Kenny Loggins.  Murray, in a performance bordering on madness, tries various futile strategies to nab the gopher, including sniper rifles, decoys, hoses, and plastic explosives, but it's his mumbled soliloquies that are the most hilarious.  Murray's imagined golf game, whacking flowers with a rake, is one of the funniest scenes in any movie, ever.Our ""hero,"" Danny (Michael O'Keefe), is a minor character completely overwhelmed by these other characters, but his storyline is the thread that ties all the other subplots together.  He cheats on his girlfriend Maggie (Animal House alum Sarah Holcomb, inexplicably with an Irish accent) with the gratuitous slut, Judge Smails' niece Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), and finds himself pitted against the Judge in the climactic golf match.Not much of a plot.  The movie's greatness is in its execution.  The writers (Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis) find the underlying humor in the country club lifestyle and the unique culture that surrounds golf and skewer everything in sight.  Be on the lookout for comic stereotypes . . . from the spoiled rich brats to the doctor who's never in the office to the profane pastor, nobody is safe.  Fortunately, ""Caddyshack"" knows to stay just on this side of crude (coming nearest to the line with its classic ""Jaws"" parody involving a Baby Ruth) -- this is a witty film, not a cruel film.This movie is a must for every guy's film library.  Just be careful -- there's always a temptation to quote ""Caddyshack"" out on the golf course.  Be warned, only about 5 million people have done it before you, and the novelty's wearing off.Also be warned -- ""Caddyshack"" sparked quite possibly the worst sequel ever, ""Caddyshack 2.""

We were all still catching our breath from 1978's ANIMAL HOUSE and Hollywood was trying to make lightning strike again.John Landis and John Belushi went on to THE BLUES BROTHERS, also released in the summer of '80, but, as loud and as entertaining as it was, BLUES never delivered the laughs like the Deltas did two years before.Doug Kenney, the mastermind behind ANIMAL HOUSE, went on to write and produce CADDYSHACK but, according to an Esquire profile after his tragic death shortly after, he was pretty coked out by then.  The studio bosses referred to it as &quot;that coke movie down in Florida.&quot;  Harold Ramis, directing his first film, admits that it like &quot;film school&quot; since he felt like he was learning as he went.Despite all of this, CADDYSHACK was hilarious.  I think the second half loses steam, most of Chevy Chase's scenes were flat, and the central character isn't very likable or all that funny--but Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray and Ted Knight more than make up for any criticisms.I'll never forget watching it the first time in a crowded theatre.  Rodney burst onto the screen with such a comedic energy that you could hear everyone perking up when he'd show up.

108888,AK7HA5YU06NLG,0790741105,The Scenario,"[4, 4]","I had to watch this movie yet again lastnight (even though I can practically yodel it backwards in Portugese) to pay my final respects to Rodney.  What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said countless times before?  It is the ultimate male-bonding movie, one that every guy age 18-50 must memorize word-for-word so that random lines of dialogue can be quoted in social settings, ensuring that another guy will call out the very next line in the script, indicating that he is indeed part of the not-so-secret society.I can not possibly give this disc less than the full 5 stars for any reason.  Having said that however, I must say that there is no DVD on the market today in more desperate need of a re-release.  The mono soundtrack is horrendous.  Granted, this is typical of a 1980 movie, but with the remastering techniques available today, it could certainly be cleaned up quite a bit.  Dialogue seems to be swallowed up by the poor recording, no matter what setting I choose on my home theater system.  Of course, this ain't ""Star Wars"" or ""Lethal Weapon"", so full-blown surround sound is not necessary, but it still needs to be remastered in at least 2-channel stereo with better clarity.Considering this DVD was released in 2000 and thus predates the era where discs are loaded with unnecessary surplus material, it's actually got one very decent extra.  The documentary ""The 19th Hole"" is an interesting (and not over-long) retrospective featuring cast and crew, though unfortunately it features none of the four main players.  Still, it's interesting to see how people like Noonon, DiNunzio, and Lacy Underall (who looks better now than she did in the movie, IMHO) have aged over the years, and hear their anecdotes on the making of the film.So please, Paramount, re-release this on two discs with all sorts of pointless extras that I'll never watch, like a 15-minute documentary on Chevy Chase's favorite brand of chewing gum.  As long as the soundtrack and the picture get a good tune up, it'll make it well worth purchasing again.  This is the movie equivalent of ""comfort food"".

108893,A176IA89VGH46M,0790741105,Todd Bovair,"[4, 11]","Amazing because I have seen just about every movie in existance (it sometimes seems). How I have missed seeing this revered comedy all these years I don't know, but I finally bought the DVD and watched it last night. I was a bit stunned at how the laughs weren't fast and furious, considering that this is accepted as a 'classic'. Here are some thought I have come up with.First, hands down, the funniest thing about this movie is Rodney Dangerfield. He rattles off one-liners, and just about every one made me laugh. Everyone should understand though, that these jokes were written for Rodney by the screenwriters (most of them the night before the scene was to be shot). Why their comic genius didn't carry over to the rest of the script I don't know. It cannot be questioned though that Rodney gives an AMAZING performance. The movie is worth seeing twice just for Rodney's delivery.The rest of 'name' cast do a good job with what they have to work with (the caddies aren't very good actors, but their story is more of a subplot than anything else). The problem is, most of the scenes (other than Rodney's) just aren't very funny (although many are worth a slight smile). The explanation I have for this is the movie was made in the 70's, and contains 70's humor. By that I mean it was accepted at that time that comedy movies have a few funny parts/scenes. What were considered hysterical 'classic' movies in their day just don't hold up as well today. I put CLASSIC in quotes because TRUE comedy classics DO hold up well today, movies like Blazing Saddles, Airplane!, and to a lesser extent Animal House. I just don't find Caddyshack to be in the same league as the above movies. In fact If Rodney wasn't in the picture, it would be a 2 star movie, no better. Thats not to say that Rodney is the ONLY funny thing in this movie. The Jaws/ swimming pool scene jumps immediately to mind. Unfortunately, this is the only non-Rodney scene I actually laughed out loud at. Other scenes may have gotten an amused smile from me, but not laughter.Chevy is fairly funny (if you can remember way back to when Chevy was actually funny), but his act gets a little old after the first 30 minutes.Ted Knight plays a good part, and I can see it would have been funny back in the late 70's. Today though, it seems forced and only mildy amusing. Same goes for Bill Murray's portrayal of Carl (although credit MUST be given to both Caddyshack and Murray, since this groundbreaking character influenced MANY movies that came after).All in all, I just didn't think this movie was anywhere NEAR funny enough to be considered a classic. It wasn't a bad comedy by any stretch, it just wasn't a great one. I know that many people love this movie and may be offended by that, but its just the opinion of a recent first-time viewer.",3,"Amazingly, I had never seen this movie until last night.....",1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2809,"['Amazing', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'movie', 'existance', 'sometimes', 'How', 'have', 'missed', 'seeing', 'revered', 'comedy', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'finally', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'bit', 'stunned', 'how', 'laughs', 'were', ""n't"", 'fast', 'furious', 'considering', 'accepted', ""'classic"", 'Here', 'are', 'thought', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'with.First', 'down', 'funniest', 'thing', 'movie', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'one-liners', 'just', 'one', 'made', 'Everyone', 'should', 'understand', 'jokes', 'were', 'written', 'Rodney', 'screenwriters', 'most', 'night', 'scene', 'was', 'be', 'shot', 'Why', 'comic', 'genius', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'rest', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'questioned', 'Rodney', 'AMAZING', 'performance', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'twice', 'just', 'Rodney', 'delivery.The', 'rest', ""'name"", 'cast', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'caddies', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'story', 'more', 'subplot', 'anything', 'else', 'problem', 'most', 'scenes', 'other', 'Rodney', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'many', 'are', 'slight', 'smile', 'explanation', 'have', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '70', '70', 'humor', 'mean', 'was', 'accepted', 'time', 'comedy', 'movies', 'have', 'few', 'funny', 'parts/scenes', 'What', 'were', 'considered', 'hysterical', ""'classic"", 'movies', 'day', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'today', 'put', 'CLASSIC', 'quotes', 'TRUE', 'comedy', 'classics', 'DO', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'today', 'movies', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'Airplane', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Animal', 'House', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Caddyshack', 'be', 'same', 'league', 'above', 'movies', 'fact', 'Rodney', 'was', ""n't"", 'picture', 'would', 'be', '2', 'star', 'movie', 'better', 'not', 'say', 'Rodney', 'ONLY', 'funny', 'thing', 'movie', 'Jaws/', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene', 'jumps', 'immediately', 'mind', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'non-Rodney', 'scene', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'Other', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'amused', 'smile', 'not', 'laughter.Chevy', 'fairly', 'funny', 'can', 'remember', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Chevy', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'act', 'little', 'old', 'first', '30', 'minutes.Ted', 'Knight', 'good', 'part', 'can', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'back', 'late', '70', 'Today', 'forced', 'only', 'mildy', 'amusing', 'Same', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'portrayal', 'Carl', 'credit', 'MUST', 'be', 'given', 'Caddyshack', 'Murray', 'groundbreaking', 'character', 'influenced', 'MANY', 'movies', 'came', '.All', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'anywhere', 'NEAR', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'comedy', 'stretch', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'one', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'just', 'opinion', 'recent', 'first-time', 'viewer']",N/A
108894,AV5G37VFE5NVD,0790741105,Tom Benton,"[0, 1]","I saw ""Caddyshack"" for the first time when I was in fourth grade and I loved it.  There were some jokes I didn't understand, but I loved it nonetheless.  Having re-watched it recently for the first time in years, I love it more than ever.  The plot is simple: a group of slobs tick off the snobby players at the Bushwood Country Club.  Nothing special there.  Truthfully, it's the actors and the wacky script that really make the movie.Directed by Harold Ramis (who has directed many comedies and who also appeared as Egon Spengler in ""Ghostbusters""), the film's script - written by Ramis, Douglas Kenney, and Bill Murray's brother Brian Doyle-Murray - is a wacky one indeed, filled with funny lines and kooky characters.  But as I've said, it's the actors that really bring the film alive.  Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield give the performances of their careers (Chase is better than he was in ""Vacation"", and Dangerfield is better than he was in ""Back to School""!).  Chase plays a character that I suppose could be described as ""the James Bond of idiots"".  Dangerfield is outrageously funny and probably the highlight of the film as rich joker Al Czervik.  Bill Murray is also great - not to mention very funny - as crazy greenskeeper Carl Spackler, who sets out to fix the club's rodent problem.  (How many other comedies feature a gopher puppet as one of the main characters of the film?)  Ted Knight does a fine job of making stuck-up Judge Smails a hateable character.There's a good soundtrack, which includes about four songs by Kenny Loggins, as well as some fun music by Johnny Mandel.  ""Any Way You Want It"" by Journey is used in one of the film's funniest sequences.

Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is one of the favorite caddies at Bushwood and is trying to win the prominent Caddy Scholarship so that he can go to college. In his mind its either that or end up working at the lumber mill for the rest of his life. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) tries to convince Danny not to just go to college for the sake of going to college while Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight) takes a liking to Danny and sees if he will suck up enough to be given the Caddy Scholarship. But, wealthy real estate developer Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) is getting under Judge Smails skin and Danny has to decide if he wants to play politics or just live life. Meanwhile, assistant groundskeeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) tries to kill a gopher that is plaguing the golf course.CADDYSHACK was one of the first and is typical of many comedy films from the early 1980s. There really isn't much of a plot and what plot there is gets lost in the scenes of improvised comic chaos the fill up mot of the movie. As the DVD commentary and the special &#34;Caddyshack: the 19th Hole&#34; featurette explain, CADDYSHACK started out as a movie about a group of guys spending their summer working as caddies at a posh country club. However, with a cast of talent that includes Bill Murray, Ted Knight, Rodney Dangerfield, and Chevy Chase director Harold Ramis decided to beef up their roles and the caddies became secondary characters. The movie does contain some great comedy and has some of the most quoted movie lines ever, e.g. &#34;So I got that going for me.&#34;Besides just being a very funny movie that has become a must-see film for golfers, the film is notable for two reasons. First, it was the first film Harold Ramis directed. Ramis had come to prominence as the writer of ANIMAL HOUSE and MEATBALLS, but CADDYSHACK was also the first movie he directed. The second reason that CADDYSHACK is notable is because it's the only movie to star both Bill Murray and Chevy Chase.Overall, a very funny film with very little plot and one of the cutest critters ever seen on screen.Special features on the DVD include the behind the scenes featurette &#34;Caddyshack: the 19th Hole&#34;, trailer, and production notes.",5,Great Comics and Unknown Caddies,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2343,"['Being', 'caddy', 'exclusive', 'Bushwood', 'Country', 'Club', 'decent', 'summer', 'job', 'perks', 'job', 'really', 'attractive', 'Danny', 'Noonan', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'one', 'favorite', 'caddies', 'Bushwood', 'trying', 'win', 'prominent', 'Caddy', 'Scholarship', 'can', 'go', 'college', 'mind', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'lumber', 'mill', 'rest', 'life', 'Ty', 'Webb', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'convince', 'Danny', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'college', 'sake', 'going', 'college', 'Judge', 'Elihu', 'Smails', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'liking', 'Danny', 'sees', 'will', 'suck', 'up', 'enough', 'be', 'given', 'Caddy', 'Scholarship', 'wealthy', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'Al', 'Czervik', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'getting', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'skin', 'Danny', 'decide', 'play', 'politics', 'just', 'live', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'assistant', 'groundskeeper', 'Carl', 'Spackler', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'kill', 'gopher', 'plaguing', 'golf', 'course.CADDYSHACK', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'typical', 'many', 'comedy', 'films', 'early', '1980s', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'what', 'plot', 'lost', 'scenes', 'improvised', 'comic', 'chaos', 'fill', 'up', 'mot', 'movie', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'special', '34', 'Caddyshack', '19th', 'Hole', '34', 'featurette', 'explain', 'CADDYSHACK', 'started', 'out', 'movie', 'group', 'guys', 'spending', 'summer', 'working', 'caddies', 'posh', 'country', 'club', 'However', 'cast', 'talent', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'decided', 'beef', 'up', 'roles', 'caddies', 'became', 'secondary', 'characters', 'movie', 'contain', 'great', 'comedy', 'most', 'quoted', 'movie', 'lines', 'ever', 'e.g', '34', 'got', 'going', 'me.', '34', 'Besides', 'just', 'being', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'become', 'must-see', 'film', 'golfers', 'film', 'notable', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'directed', 'Ramis', 'had', 'come', 'prominence', 'writer', 'ANIMAL', 'HOUSE', 'MEATBALLS', 'CADDYSHACK', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'movie', 'directed', 'second', 'reason', 'CADDYSHACK', 'notable', 'only', 'movie', 'star', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Chevy', 'Chase.Overall', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'one', 'cutest', 'critters', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen.Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'scenes', 'featurette', '34', 'Caddyshack', '19th', 'Hole', '34', 'trailer', 'production', 'notes']",N/A
