I watch Inuyasha, Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Clannad, Kanon, Wolf's rain, etc. But I must say this is one of my most favorites. I recently purchased for Christmas and its now under my tree. The anime is a must have for horror anime fans. It's horror however there is also alot of deep emotion in it, and some things are not as they seem.It's always smart to keep an open mind in this anime as well since its not predictable at all and never fails to shock you. I will say its not for children and not for people who can't handle gore. I'd say Elfen Lied fans would really enjoy this due to the gore and horror theme.

O Gawd, is it not bright, fluffy and happy.But very, very satisfying.Not to delve too deeply into the story, this is basically a curse/ghost story. A particular class in a Japanese school is cursed, one of the class members  is a ghost, but you can't tell by touching or talking to them. And, if this ghost isn't outed - identified and killed - someone or someones in the class will die.The suspense builds very well in a properly paced fashion, you are kept guessing until well into the last episode. While I can't say the reactions of the people in the series is actually representative of actual Japanese, these reactions do reflect what is also out there in anime and Japanese popular literature (read: manga and light novels). The artwork is properly noir-ish for this indeed is a very noir series.In one respect viewing is not very repeatable; one you know the hook you know the hook and the suspense goes away. But the series is suitable for repeat viewing if only to soak in the atmosphere and the depth of the art - the voice acting and animation and music. The characters are memorable in action if not in name, the story is VERY memorable in toto. I personally count this as one of my favorite suspense-terror works. Recommended.

1641680,AT3CTIPQ1682I,B00C3JUGZA,DMDutcher,"[8, 15]","Another isn't entirely what you'd expect. A transfer student joins the mysterious class 3 of Yomiyama High School, and soon encounters a lot of weirdness. There is a mystery, a tragic history, a curse, and a strange odd girl that no one can see but him. He soon finds out that a chain of events has been set in motion that will cause a lot of carnage and death, and there seems to be no way to stop it...The best way to describe it would be an anime take on the Final Destination horror films. In both, the actions of people tend to result in a lot of death and carnage by everyday things and invisible circumstances. Another embraces this and adds a mystery to it of why this is happening and how can we stop it? I can't really describe the plot as it twists, turns, and sometimes blatantly misdirects you to keep you unsettled. It's quite good for anime horror, and escapes a lot of the traditional Japanese horror tropes into a more Western sensibility. There are even references to writers like John Saul and the movie the Omen.Like Final Destination, it's also pretty gory. Some of the deaths are brutal, and extended for shock impact, while others are brief and startling. It's winds up being less gratuitous in a way because the deaths are so unexpected, and to people you actually care about, that it is less about what cool gore scene they could include, and more about shocking you and reminding you the curse is not something cozy or benign. You also see the aftermath of the deaths, too, and your heart goes out to the poor people surviving.It's good, but there are some minor issues. The ending to me didn't really seem to be as justified as it was. Without spoilers, the most pertinent parts of why it ended the way it did were revealed at the ending and only some things were foreshadowed well. Also, the misdirection changes the story in the way you don't expect, and you may get one idea of how things are and not like the actual explanations.The whole series is streaming on Crunchyroll, but I plan to buy the blu-ray when released. It's a different take on anime horror that is quite good, and worth a spot in your collection if you like that genre.",4,Anime mystery meets Final Destination,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2168,"[""n't"", 'entirely', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'transfer', 'student', 'mysterious', 'class', '3', 'Yomiyama', 'High', 'School', 'soon', 'encounters', 'lot', 'weirdness', 'mystery', 'tragic', 'history', 'curse', 'strange', 'odd', 'girl', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'soon', 'out', 'chain', 'events', 'been', 'set', 'motion', 'will', 'cause', 'lot', 'carnage', 'death', 'there', 'be', 'way', 'stop', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'would', 'be', 'anime', 'take', 'Final', 'Destination', 'horror', 'films', 'actions', 'people', 'tend', 'result', 'lot', 'death', 'carnage', 'everyday', 'things', 'invisible', 'circumstances', 'mystery', 'why', 'happening', 'how', 'can', 'stop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'describe', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'blatantly', 'keep', 'unsettled', 'quite', 'good', 'anime', 'horror', 'lot', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'more', 'Western', 'sensibility', 'are', 'even', 'references', 'writers', 'John', 'Saul', 'movie', 'Omen.Like', 'Final', 'Destination', 'also', 'pretty', 'gory', 'deaths', 'are', 'brutal', 'extended', 'shock', 'impact', 'others', 'are', 'brief', 'startling', 'up', 'being', 'less', 'gratuitous', 'way', 'deaths', 'are', 'so', 'unexpected', 'people', 'actually', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'cool', 'gore', 'scene', 'could', 'include', 'more', 'shocking', 'reminding', 'curse', 'not', 'something', 'cozy', 'benign', 'also', 'see', 'aftermath', 'deaths', 'too', 'heart', 'out', 'poor', 'people', 'surviving.It', 'good', 'are', 'minor', 'issues', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'justified', 'was', 'spoilers', 'most', 'pertinent', 'parts', 'why', 'ended', 'way', 'did', 'were', 'revealed', 'ending', 'only', 'things', 'were', 'foreshadowed', 'well', 'Also', 'misdirection', 'story', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'may', 'get', 'one', 'idea', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'actual', 'explanations.The', 'whole', 'series', 'streaming', 'Crunchyroll', 'plan', 'buy', 'blu-ray', 'when', 'released', 'different', 'take', 'anime', 'horror', 'quite', 'good', 'spot', 'collection', 'like', 'genre']",N/A

Generally all the horror anime I watch are nothing but  excessive violence and seem to only promote shock value as a way of luring in an audience. This anime did everything right.

The intro seems to explain the theme of the story well. From the minute you start watching it seems mysterious and enticing.

The story is essentially that in one particular classroom, year after year a bunch of the students die.  The mood of the story is very well done, and I liked the two main characters a lot.  The visuals in Another are also quite appealing.  If you are a fan of gore, there are some pretty unique death scenes.  But after it was all said and done, the story really just didn't develop well...As the story begins, you wonder why do students in this class die.  But then the reason doesn't turn out to be very elaborate; it's kind of a let down...  There's good chemistry between the two lead characters, but nothing ever comes of it.  The ending had a bit of surprise, but most of it was pretty predicable...There's nothing psychological at all in the show. If you want to see gore as a result of a tormented mind or strange twist of fate like in Elfen Lied, Deadman Wonderland, or Future Diary, you will not find it here.I won't say that I didn't like Another, because as I was watching it I enjoyed it.  But looking back on the series after it was over, it just seemed empty.  If you like random gore, then by all means, watch it.

1641688,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B00C3JUGZA,Kris,"[0, 0]","Anime horror mysteries are pretty rare in general, but when they appear, are they any good? Another is an anime that is definitely worth the time of any viewer who likes horror aspects in their stories. This title explores a middle school and the unusual happenings of one particular class. A class that seems to have a ghost for a student.The main character transfers into this new class without being aware of the ghost stories and the class regulations. After a short while, people in the town start dying very gruesomely. The pacing is kind of slow for most of the story, but is was all done for the sake of building up the horror, suspense, and the mystery of trying to stop the rash of deaths in the town. Its kind of like Final Destination mixed with the Sixth Sense.The character designs in this anime are very well done; they look rather cute, which is all the more upsetting when some of the characters are killed off. In fact, this show has more in common with the anime series Higurashi than any other show. The music is also very good too, and certainly sets the mood when it comes to creeping out the viewer. The opening theme song is done by Ali Project, who also did the music for Code Geass and Rozen Maiden, which is always a plus.Probably the reason many people watch the series is because of the character, Mei Misaki, the eye patched girl on the cover. Trying to find out who she is and her story are top priorities when the viewer is introduced to her. She is very pale looking and is very quiet. Its almost like she doesn't belong in the class at all. She is acquainted with the main character early in the series, but everyone seems to be against this, or they seem to ignore her completely.It is worth noting that this series can be very bloody at times, so it is not for the faint of heart. The final two episodes are insane and hectic, and definitely for those that enjoy anime violence. Also, this show has probably the best plot twist in an anime during the final episode. Notably this anime is done by PA Works, who also worked on Angel Beats and Canaan; both of which are very good anime.This collection is distributed by Sentai Filmworks, and it is very good. Strangely enough, the DVD release has 3 discs with 4 episodes each. I am not sure why they did not put 6 episodes on two discs like other releases.

I like some terrible shows and I hate some really well-done shows. I recognize the difference between enjoyment and quality. This is both highly enjoyable (if you like suspense-horror stories) and high quality.Another is a great anime. The music is pretty good, if not super memorable. The characters are really well developed for such a short series.The animation style really tickles me. While the drawing of the characters is pretty standard, the details of the settings are some of the best I've seen in any animation. The choices of lighting and shadow, moss on cobblestones, rust on wrought-iron fences, and other little details add to the atmosphere of the show so well. There was a lot of attention to detail put into this show.And the story is great. I believe that art exists to convey emotion - even if that emotion is negative. A horror movie that succeeds in scaring the audience is a good piece of art. I am a grown man who does not scare easily and this show - even though it was animated - managed to creep me out slightly when watching alone late at night.

1641697,A2VESRVJU717IR,B00C3JUGZA,RStringini,"[6, 9]","Another is a very odd series.  While the plot reads like an anime version of Final Destination, the final product is very addictive, yet fairly flawed series.Instead of recapping the plot, which is perfectly summarized on this page already, lets focus on what the show does right.  The story, while confusing at times, is instantly entertaining.  The perfectly crafted mood and tone draw the viewer in, and then constant, hovering doom keep the show moving along.  Very rarely does the story play it safe, with pretty much all characters at risk of falling victim to class 3-3's curse.  The art enhances the mood, building a word drenched in shadows, cool colors and a hazy, almost sunset glow that settles over everything.  The pace, at least in the earlier episodes, is deliberate.  It takes time to establish mood and character.Character is another area where the show stands out. While the cast is VERY large, and focus can be pulled all over the place, the characters are very enjoyable to watch.  Note I didn't say &#34;watch die&#34;.  These kids are good group of normal teenagers who are stuck in a horrific situation.  You feel bad for them, and you don't really want to see them die, but die they do.  This show is brutal in dispatching it's cast.  The death scenes are shocking and well animated.While the show does a lot right, it also has some pretty obvious flaws.  First and foremost is the occasional CGI employed.  In some scenes it is hardly an issue, but in others it looks horrid.  The worst is a scene set at the beach, with the ocean animated with CGI.  It looks like something from an original Playstation game, and completely pulls the viewer out of the scene.  Also, because of the large cast, and the more realistic character designs, characters can be hard to tell apart, with only slight differences in hair style being the only way to separate one character from the other.  The other glaring problem is the way the story is compressed in the later half of the series.  For the first half the pace of the show is slow, taking it's time to establish character and setting.  The second half (a good marker is the beach episode) is much faster paced, with characters getting bumped off left and right.  The issue is that some of these characters are discussed as if the audience should already know who they are, and yet we have had zero exposure to them until their death scene.  It kills the impact and can cause the story to feel choppy and under developed.  The other major issue is in the final three episodes.  While the tension is high, the pace fast and the action non-stop and violent, some of the character's reactions and choices seem rather odd (like characters constantly running back into a burning building, or another character seeming to brush off a rather brutal death.Overall this series is very entertaining.  All of it's flaws do not get in the way of the viewer getting sucked into the twisting and turning story, or the over the top violent deaths.  The writers also, wisely, inject some levity into the series at times, allowing us to be reminded that these characters are kids.  For horror fans this is a must watch series.
