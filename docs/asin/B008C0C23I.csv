As the ""Air Bud""/""Buddies""/""Santa Paws"" franchise is such a fantastic series and a tremendous winner for Disney and children alike, it is beyond comprehension whose foolhardy decision it was to muck it up with this sequel.  Who in their right minds would produce a sequel only 2 years after the superb original, ""The Search for Santa Paws"", and cast the same child star (former ""America's Got Talent"" top 10 finalist, Kaitlyn Maher) as a different, motherless character in each of the films?  Does Disney believe that children have become stupid?!?  Even my four year old daughter asked how the little girl's name changed from Quinn in the original to Sarah in the sequel, where her sister went, where did the brother come from, and why did she get 2 new parents in the 1st movie and now has a different, unlikeable dad in the 2nd one.  She also insisted that I explain to her why the sequel used a ""fake"" Santa and Mrs. Claus instead of the real ones that were in the original movie.  And as if this wasn't all bad enough, the sequel is a poorly written and badly acted movie.

After sitting through several of these movies, I can tell you that most of the time they aren't made for parents at all. I refer to these types of movies as ""babysitters."" You play them for the kids and exit the room immediately. That being said, I found this holiday entry into the series tolerable and easier to watch.The Santa Pups sneak a ride on Mrs. Claus's sled as she heads to Pineville. Once they get to the town, they start granting the wishes of the children there. Unfortunately, one wish goes awry and Pineville's Christmas Spirit begins disappearing. Mrs. Claus and the Santa Pups must find a way to save the town and bring back Christmas Spirit to its citizens and the rest of the world.It's easier for me to tolerate these ridiculously cute movies when they're wrapped in Christmas paper. I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with the holiday. ""Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups"" is also made watchable thanks to the fact that it doesn't lean as heavily on the animals like most of the ""Air"" and ""Santa"" Buddies movies do. The humans are involved in the storyline to a greater degree, making it easier for adults to identify with.Cheryl Ladd stars as Mrs. Claus and pours her heart and soul into the role. It's hard to believe a Charlie's Angel is playing Santa's wife. George Newbern portrays a widowed father whose son has lost his Christmas Spirit. Most people will recognize him as Bryan MacKenzie in the ""Father of the Bride"" films. Danny Woodburn returns to the role of Eli the elf which he brought to life in the first ""Santa Buddies"" movie and its sequel, ""The Search for Santa Paws.""The audio and video quality for this release are as excellent as we've come to expect from Disney Blu-ray releases. The picture is flawless and the colors are vibrant. It's amazing how realistic the movements of the dogs' mouths look when they talk in the clarity of high-definition. The 5.1 surround is put to good use by the movie's musical numbers and magical sound effects.Special features on the Blu-ray include the ""Santa Pups Music Mash-Up"" in which they sing a mix of different holiday tunes. Merry mess-ups and other on-set antics are showcased in the featurette ""Blooper Scooper.""The ""Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups"" Blu-ray + DVD edition will bring holiday cheer to boys and girls everywhere. Although some parents might find it difficult to sit through these movies, rest assured this one is easier to take in. One thing you can count on is it's appropriate for any age child and perfect for family night in front of a fire with the dim light of your Christmas tree in the background.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups""",1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,2700,"['Disney', 'Air', 'Buddies', 'franchise', 'Santa', 'Paws', '2', 'Santa', 'Pups', 'Christmas', 'sitting', 'several', 'movies', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'parents', 'refer', 'types', 'movies', 'babysitters', 'play', 'kids', 'exit', 'room', 'immediately', 'being', 'said', 'found', 'holiday', 'entry', 'series', 'tolerable', 'easier', 'watch.The', 'Santa', 'Pups', 'sneak', 'ride', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'sled', 'Pineville', 'Once', 'get', 'town', 'start', 'granting', 'wishes', 'children', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'wish', 'awry', 'Pineville', 'Christmas', 'Spirit', 'disappearing', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'Santa', 'Pups', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'town', 'bring', 'back', 'Christmas', 'Spirit', 'citizens', 'rest', 'world.It', 'easier', 'tolerate', 'ridiculously', 'cute', 'movies', 'when', ""'re"", 'wrapped', 'Christmas', 'paper', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'anything', 'do', 'holiday', 'Santa', 'Paws', '2', 'Santa', 'Pups', 'also', 'made', 'watchable', 'thanks', 'fact', ""n't"", 'lean', 'heavily', 'animals', 'most', 'Air', 'Santa', 'Buddies', 'movies', 'do', 'humans', 'are', 'involved', 'storyline', 'greater', 'degree', 'making', 'easier', 'adults', 'identify', 'with.Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'heart', 'soul', 'role', 'hard', 'believe', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'playing', 'Santa', 'wife', 'George', 'Newbern', 'widowed', 'father', 'son', 'lost', 'Christmas', 'Spirit', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'recognize', 'Bryan', 'MacKenzie', 'Father', 'Bride', 'films', 'Danny', 'Woodburn', 'role', 'Eli', 'elf', 'brought', 'life', 'first', 'Santa', 'Buddies', 'movie', 'sequel', 'Search', 'Santa', 'Paws', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'release', 'are', 'as', 'excellent', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Disney', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'picture', 'flawless', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'amazing', 'how', 'realistic', 'movements', 'dogs', 'mouths', 'look', 'when', 'talk', 'clarity', 'high-definition', '5.1', 'surround', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'movie', 'musical', 'numbers', 'magical', 'sound', 'effects.Special', 'features', 'Blu-ray', 'include', 'Santa', 'Pups', 'Music', 'Mash-Up', 'sing', 'mix', 'different', 'holiday', 'tunes', 'Merry', 'mess-ups', 'other', 'on-set', 'antics', 'are', 'showcased', 'featurette', 'Blooper', 'Scooper', 'Santa', 'Paws', '2', 'Santa', 'Pups', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', 'edition', 'will', 'bring', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'boys', 'girls', 'everywhere', 'parents', 'might', 'find', 'difficult', 'sit', 'movies', 'rest', 'assured', 'one', 'easier', 'take', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'count', 'appropriate', 'age', 'child', 'perfect', 'family', 'night', 'front', 'fire', 'dim', 'light', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'background']",Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups

The first Santa Paws was pretty standard talking-dog kiddie fare, but this one steps it up a bit on every level - plot, special effects, casting, and especially the music. Four canine helpers to Santa (the adorable white pups in the picture) sneak onto Mrs. Clause's sleigh when she travels to Pineville, the town that previously had the highest 'Christmas Spirit' in the world, but is now slipping fast due to the death of one resident, who was the Christmas ambassador. The pups unwittingly trigger an even worse decline in Christmas spirit, and Mrs. Clause must sort it all out, in the process helping two children heal from the death of their mother (the previous Christmas ambassador.) It's full of poignant moments, and lots of fun, including a great 'jailbreak' musical number featuring Mrs. Clause and 3 townswomen called 'the Bright sisters.'Overall, this surpassed my expectations, and that of my kids (ages 6 and 8), and I highly recommend!",5,"Adorable - Better than the First, Mostly Because of the Music",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1009,"['was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'straight-to-video', 'film', 'first', 'Santa', 'Paws', 'was', 'pretty', 'standard', 'talking-dog', 'kiddie', 'fare', 'one', 'up', 'bit', 'level', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'casting', 'especially', 'music', 'Four', 'canine', 'helpers', 'Santa', 'adorable', 'white', 'pups', 'picture', 'sneak', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'sleigh', 'when', 'Pineville', 'town', 'previously', 'had', 'highest', 'Spirit', 'world', 'now', 'slipping', 'fast', 'due', 'death', 'one', 'resident', 'who', 'was', 'Christmas', 'ambassador', 'pups', 'unwittingly', 'even', 'worse', 'decline', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'must', 'sort', 'out', 'process', 'helping', 'two', 'children', 'heal', 'death', 'mother', 'previous', 'Christmas', 'ambassador', 'full', 'poignant', 'moments', 'lots', 'fun', 'including', 'great', ""'jailbreak"", 'musical', 'number', 'featuring', 'Mrs', 'Clause', '3', 'townswomen', 'called', 'Bright', 'sisters', ""'Overall"", 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'kids', 'ages', '6', '8', 'highly', 'recommend']",Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups

1550026,A36JNR4VT6YGFA,B008C0C23I,L. Sandoval,"[4, 6]",I cannot believe the original Santa and cast was not available for a real sequel.  The music was 100% better in the original.  The biggest problem I have with this is the director felt Kaitlyn Maher was old enough to be cast again in the role of the main character and that a child or adult wouldn't notice or remember she was one of the main characters in the first who was adopted by a family at the end.  You end up answering questions with your kids like &#34;What happened to Will (her &#34;sister&#34; in the first film) or her family.&#34;  Quite confusing for some children.  In addition Santa goes from an old guy to a younger Santa hence Cheryl Ladd being cast as younger Mrs. Claus.  I should note that Eli the Elf and Eddy the Elf Dog are the only original cast members that returned.Instead Kaitlyn Maher plays a little girl who lost her mother to which they don't really explain until well into the feature.  The father is played by George Newbern who was in Father of the Bride (w/ Steve Martin) as the son-in-law whom I can't believe can't find better work these days.The story is about how she her mother dies and Mrs. Claus has to go back to fictional Pineville to find another Ambassador of the Santa Cause/Claus.  The pups who recently were born by Santa Paws and his wife stow away and chaos ensues.I will be honest in saying the story was not bad I just believe the casting was a poor decision on the Director.  The Search for Santa Paws was such a good movie and our kids loved it.  Almost a classic but this one with some of the same actors in different roles or replacing people that were good fits (Santa) in the first was a disappointment and confusing to kids.,1,This is not a sequel as Disney would care for you to believe,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,1688,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'original', 'Santa', 'cast', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'real', 'sequel', 'music', 'was', '100', '%', 'better', 'original', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'director', 'felt', 'Kaitlyn', 'Maher', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'cast', 'again', 'role', 'main', 'character', 'child', 'adult', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'remember', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'family', 'end', 'end', 'up', 'answering', 'questions', 'kids', '34', 'What', 'happened', 'Will', '34', 'sister', '34', 'first', 'film', 'family.', '34', 'Quite', 'confusing', 'children', 'addition', 'Santa', 'old', 'guy', 'younger', 'Santa', 'hence', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'being', 'cast', 'younger', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'should', 'note', 'Eli', 'Elf', 'Eddy', 'Elf', 'Dog', 'are', 'only', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'returned.Instead', 'Kaitlyn', 'Maher', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'well', 'feature', 'father', 'played', 'George', 'Newbern', 'who', 'was', 'Father', 'Bride', 'w/', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'son-in-law', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'work', 'days.The', 'story', 'how', 'mother', 'dies', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'go', 'back', 'fictional', 'Pineville', 'find', 'Ambassador', 'Santa', 'Cause/Claus', 'pups', 'who', 'recently', 'were', 'born', 'Santa', 'Paws', 'wife', 'stow', 'away', 'chaos', 'ensues.I', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'saying', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'believe', 'casting', 'was', 'poor', 'decision', 'Director', 'Search', 'Santa', 'Paws', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'loved', 'Almost', 'classic', 'one', 'same', 'actors', 'different', 'roles', 'replacing', 'people', 'were', 'good', 'fits', 'Santa', 'first', 'was', 'disappointment', 'confusing', 'kids']",Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups
