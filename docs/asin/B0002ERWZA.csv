McIntyre ""Texasexpat""","[7, 7]","What female singer would dare agree to a live television 13 minute duet with Ethel Merman in 1953, when Merman was at the very top of her form? Mary Martin, that's who and Mary more than holds her own. The ladies alternate songs, but electic sparks really fly when they sing together (especially when they are each singing different songs -- sounds strange, but they hit a home run every time). This a magical duet that set the style and tone for every television duet that followed. But, you will soon forget that you are watching history in the making and listen and watch these two extraordinary women do what they do better than just about anyone else --- sing and entertain an audience. Some would argue that Broadway's finest night was June 15, 1953 in a NBC studio where this duet was sung, they would not be far wrong!",5,Perhaps Broadway's Finest Night,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,826,"['What', 'female', 'singer', 'would', 'dare', 'agree', 'live', 'television', '13', 'minute', 'duet', 'Ethel', 'Merman', '1953', 'when', 'Merman', 'was', 'very', 'top', 'form', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'who', 'Mary', 'more', 'own', 'ladies', 'alternate', 'songs', 'electic', 'sparks', 'really', 'fly', 'when', 'sing', 'together', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'singing', 'different', 'songs', 'strange', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'time', 'magical', 'duet', 'set', 'style', 'tone', 'television', 'duet', 'followed', 'will', 'soon', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'history', 'making', 'listen', 'watch', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'women', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'better', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'sing', 'entertain', 'audience', 'would', 'argue', 'Broadway', 'finest', 'night', 'was', 'June', '15', '1953', 'NBC', 'studio', 'where', 'duet', 'was', 'sung', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'wrong']",N/A
831943,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,B0002ERWZA,Jim Jr,"[8, 8]","A fantastic classic has been released on DVD. It is a magnificent record of one of the most magical nights on televison and in musical theater. There have never been and will never be two such wonderful talents an Mary Martin and Ethel Merman. Although their styles were completely different they compliment each other perfectly. There is an electric feeling that seems to come through the screen as they perform both individually and together. Their duet is MAGNIFICENT.This is a DVD that any lover of theater, great performances and magical happenings must have for their collection.The magic that each lady created in a theatre comes through wonderfully in this production even if it is in black and white and not the razor sharp image that would be available today. To have seen either one live was unforgettable and that comes through in this program. They end the duet with both singing &quot;No Business Like Show Business&quot; from &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; which both starred in - Merman on Broadway and Martin on tour and on TV.I have long cherished the original 10 inch LP that was issued at the time of the original telecast and now I have both the picture and sound.Unfortunately, both ladies are no longer with us, but they will live forever in this terrific DVD.",5,At least a TEN star program,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1283,"['fantastic', 'classic', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'magnificent', 'record', 'one', 'most', 'magical', 'nights', 'televison', 'musical', 'theater', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'two', 'such', 'wonderful', 'talents', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'styles', 'were', 'completely', 'different', 'compliment', 'other', 'perfectly', 'electric', 'feeling', 'come', 'screen', 'perform', 'individually', 'together', 'duet', 'MAGNIFICENT.This', 'DVD', 'lover', 'theater', 'great', 'performances', 'magical', 'happenings', 'must', 'have', 'collection.The', 'magic', 'lady', 'created', 'theatre', 'through', 'wonderfully', 'production', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'not', 'razor', 'sharp', 'image', 'would', 'be', 'available', 'today', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'live', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'through', 'program', 'end', 'duet', 'singing', 'quot', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Get', 'Your', 'Gun', 'quot', 'starred', 'Merman', 'Broadway', 'Martin', 'tour', 'TV.I', 'have', 'long', 'cherished', 'original', '10', 'inch', 'LP', 'was', 'issued', 'time', 'original', 'telecast', 'now', 'have', 'picture', 'sound.Unfortunately', 'ladies', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'terrific', 'DVD']",N/A
