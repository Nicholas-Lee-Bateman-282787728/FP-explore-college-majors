724206,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B0000714E7,Bruce P. Barten,"[2, 11]","The way this film starts, with a lot of people sitting in modern office workstations, I thought it was going in depth into a dazed state I might call technocracking of the brain, if I may coin a phrase for the state of mind induced by the technical problems that seem to crop up when a computer is doing something that just might not have logical solutions.  The computer worker (a woman) who is totally into a radio program (as if music were the only link with life available while working) as the only practical therapy for pushing a mind that isn't getting the answers it needs in the job-related situation, suddenly faces her boss, the well-dressed and lofty Liz Phair, shyly admits the jumping around that her computer is doing, and even suggests a solution while cringing with feelings of insignificance, if not incompetence.  Since this is a film, the irony is that the movie star on the cover of this DVD is playing the quirky, lost individual who wants to be liked, and Liz Phair, the acting novice, is the perfect picture of greatness as a mind so aloof from petty computer techniques that her mere ""Yes,"" is a devastating understatement of the degree of understanding of the confusing mental turmoil her underlings must suffer to be able to achieve anything.  The rightness of the part for Liz Phair is based on her musical ability, of which I am a fan.  Once, when she asked a crowd to sing along on her song, ""Flower,"" I was a guy singing falsetto, doing the easy repetitious part with the crowd, while she was singing ""kind of like you're underwater.""  That song seems pretty simple musically, compared to most of her songs, but her attitude is something that might be considered unique.Finn Taylor wrote and directed this movie, but many of the actors were not personally acquainted with him before shooting the film, so the most comic scenes in the Behind the Scenes Featurette were part of a series of questions which asked each of them who did they think Finn was before finding out which of the team he in fact turned out to be.  This is funny like a king disguising himself as one of his subjects, only these actors tried to rehearse all the scenes with the cameras running, and no one seemed to be telling them when the actual film was being shot.  Finn said the crew was particularly pleased when a scene was filmed with the original music from the score.  Part of the plot is how clueless some people seem when they have no background music to relate to, and life keeps putting these people into situations where they don't really fit.I don't think this really qualifies as a romantic comedy.  The fact that men and women in the film have to interact with each other doesn't lead to any relationships.  The action generates a lot of guilt feelings, but the title of the movie could have been *The Fake Natasha.*  The main feelings this is about are the feelings of fans.  The D.J. responds to the feelings of the music fans, but the fans love music more than him personally.  Even Liz Phair has become so glamorous as to be unapproachable, and the film thwarts every opportunity that it opens up.  This might be funny to the people who think this stuff up and film people doing it, but I can see how no one would want to be caught trying to get people to act this way.On a political level, I thought the title ""Cherish"" relates pretty well to how America would like the rest of the world to accept America as the sole remaining superpower.  The fact that the main character was not allowed to have a computer while locked up, because hackers had previously manipulated jail records, is a lot like the United States thinking that other nations should not have weapons of mass destruction.  The little guy who lived downstairs reminded me a lot of Kuwait.  I can't remember that Kuwait ever won a war on its own, so it seemed like a perfect candidate to become an occupied territory or annexed province when other neighborhoods in the Middle East were concerned about how the Palestinians were doing.  Little kids in the neighborhood throwing gum at the prisoner in her window was what reminded me of that political situation in the first place.  America has some friends who have at least that much trouble where they are.  This film didn't express an opinion about how likely we are to all end up in such a world.  I haven't figured out what the optional ending was for, though.",3,Who is Finn Taylor?,1040256000,"12 19, 2002",2002,4401,"['way', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'sitting', 'modern', 'office', 'workstations', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'depth', 'dazed', 'state', 'might', 'call', 'technocracking', 'brain', 'may', 'coin', 'phrase', 'state', 'mind', 'induced', 'technical', 'problems', 'seem', 'crop', 'up', 'when', 'computer', 'doing', 'something', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'logical', 'solutions', 'computer', 'worker', 'woman', 'who', 'totally', 'radio', 'program', 'music', 'were', 'only', 'link', 'life', 'available', 'working', 'only', 'practical', 'therapy', 'pushing', 'mind', ""n't"", 'getting', 'answers', 'job-related', 'situation', 'suddenly', 'boss', 'well-dressed', 'lofty', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'shyly', 'jumping', 'around', 'computer', 'doing', 'even', 'solution', 'cringing', 'feelings', 'insignificance', 'not', 'incompetence', 'film', 'irony', 'movie', 'star', 'cover', 'DVD', 'playing', 'quirky', 'lost', 'individual', 'who', 'be', 'liked', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'acting', 'novice', 'perfect', 'picture', 'greatness', 'mind', 'so', 'aloof', 'petty', 'computer', 'techniques', 'mere', 'Yes', 'devastating', 'understatement', 'degree', 'understanding', 'confusing', 'mental', 'turmoil', 'underlings', 'must', 'suffer', 'be', 'able', 'achieve', 'anything', 'rightness', 'part', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'based', 'musical', 'ability', 'am', 'fan', 'Once', 'when', 'asked', 'crowd', 'sing', 'along', 'song', 'Flower', 'was', 'guy', 'singing', 'falsetto', 'doing', 'easy', 'repetitious', 'part', 'crowd', 'was', 'singing', 'kind', ""'re"", 'underwater', 'song', 'pretty', 'simple', 'musically', 'compared', 'most', 'songs', 'attitude', 'something', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'unique.Finn', 'Taylor', 'wrote', 'directed', 'movie', 'many', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'personally', 'acquainted', 'shooting', 'film', 'most', 'comic', 'scenes', 'Behind', 'Scenes', 'Featurette', 'were', 'part', 'series', 'questions', 'asked', 'who', 'did', 'think', 'Finn', 'was', 'finding', 'out', 'team', 'fact', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'funny', 'king', 'disguising', 'one', 'subjects', 'only', 'actors', 'tried', 'rehearse', 'scenes', 'cameras', 'running', 'one', 'seemed', 'be', 'telling', 'when', 'actual', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'shot', 'Finn', 'said', 'crew', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'when', 'scene', 'was', 'filmed', 'original', 'music', 'score', 'Part', 'plot', 'how', 'clueless', 'people', 'seem', 'when', 'have', 'background', 'music', 'relate', 'life', 'keeps', 'putting', 'people', 'situations', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fact', 'men', 'women', 'film', 'have', 'interact', 'other', ""n't"", 'lead', 'relationships', 'action', 'lot', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'title', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', '*The', 'Fake', 'Natasha', '*', 'main', 'feelings', 'about', 'are', 'feelings', 'fans', 'D.J', 'feelings', 'music', 'fans', 'fans', 'love', 'music', 'more', 'personally', 'Even', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'become', 'so', 'glamorous', 'be', 'unapproachable', 'film', 'thwarts', 'opportunity', 'up', 'might', 'be', 'funny', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'stuff', 'up', 'film', 'people', 'doing', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'caught', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'act', 'way.On', 'political', 'level', 'thought', 'title', 'Cherish', 'pretty', 'well', 'how', 'America', 'would', 'like', 'rest', 'world', 'accept', 'America', 'sole', 'remaining', 'superpower', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'computer', 'locked', 'up', 'hackers', 'had', 'previously', 'manipulated', 'jail', 'records', 'lot', 'United', 'States', 'thinking', 'other', 'nations', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'lived', 'downstairs', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Kuwait', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Kuwait', 'ever', 'won', 'war', 'own', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'become', 'occupied', 'territory', 'annexed', 'province', 'when', 'other', 'neighborhoods', 'Middle', 'East', 'were', 'concerned', 'how', 'Palestinians', 'were', 'doing', 'Little', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'throwing', 'gum', 'prisoner', 'window', 'was', 'what', 'reminded', 'political', 'situation', 'first', 'place', 'America', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'least', 'much', 'trouble', 'where', 'are', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'express', 'opinion', 'how', 'likely', 'are', 'end', 'up', 'world', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'optional', 'ending', 'was', 'though']",N/A
724207,A3GVDZUVE79TK7,B0000714E7,David F. Green,"[5, 10]","&quot;Cherish&quot; is a very entertaining movie about a lonely woman named Zoe (Robin Tunney) who, as a result of being carjacked by a stalker and framed for a crime, is placed under house arrest and forced to wear an ankle bracelet so that the police can monitor her whereabouts.  The movie then becomes a brilliant character study as we watch Zoe try to cope with her isolation and eventually develop independence, all while trying to prove her innocence to Bill (Tim Blake Nelson), the deputy in charge of visiting her regularly to examine the ankle bracelet.  This good dark comedy is made into a great one thanks to the incredibly powerful performances given by the actors, ESPECIALLY ROBIN TUNNEY!I can't lavish enough praise on Robin Tunney for her brilliant portrayal as Zoe.  I never really had an opinion on Ms. Tunney before &quot;Cherish&quot;, as I usually saw her in forgettable movies like &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; and &quot;The Craft&quot;, but she blew me away in this one.  Robin nails all the necessary emotions.  In one scene, I actually had to fight back tears as Robin's Zoe begs a delivery-man to stay with her because her isolation has left her so starved for company.  In another scene, Robin's Zoe had me laughing hysterically as she tormented the tightly-wound Bill by roller-skating around her apartment while he tries to examine the bracelet.  There are many other wonderful moments as well...the kind-hearted Zoe befriending the crippled man who lives below her...the once-weak Zoe becoming fiercely independent...it's impossible to not fall in love with Zoe.  Robin Tunney grabs your attention as soon as she hits the screen and doesn't let go until the ending credits.  Plus, there is the incredible chemistry between Robin's Zoe and Tim's Bill.  In fact, according to the commentary, a growing romance between Zoe and Bill was originally not in the script, but was added in during filming because the director was so impressed by the chemistry between the two main actors.  I guarantee you will be mesmerized by this movie.So if I enjoyed watching this movie so much, why did I only give it 4 stars?  Well, my biggest problem with this movie was that I felt it really fell apart in the last few minutes and had a very unsatisfying ending.  As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the &quot;Zoe stalking her stalker&quot; scenes were not nearly as interesting as what had happened before.  And while I won't give away the ending, I'll say this... a key character does some completely illogical towards the end, and this leads to a disappointing ending.  There was no reason for this character doing what they did, except that the director was apparently trying to go for a twist at the end.  In fact, one of the people in the commentary mentions that every person who asks them about the movie asks why that character did that at the end.  NOTE TO DIRECTOR:  If everyone asks for someone to clear up the same point, then you didn't do a very good job conveying this on-screen.Another problem is that while it's a very entertaining movie, it is also very uneven and inconsistant at times.  You often wonder why characters are acting the way they are.  A perfect example is when Bill defends Zoe after a police officer makes a rude comment to her...and then Zoe &quot;thanks&quot; bill by screaming at him and throwing him out...yet in their very next scene together, Zoe is warm and openly flirts with Bill...did we miss something that happened inbetween?  And I the found it odd that at the beginning of the movie, Zoe was supposedly unable to keep a man around for longer than one date as they never called her back, yet every man who meets Zoe in this movie almost instantly falls in love with her???  The commentary reveals what I already suspected...a lot of this movie is improvised by the actors, and as a result, the movie feels uneven and it doesn't always flow well.So to summarize, I would definitely recommend this movie, mainly because of the incredible acting.  (Robin Tunney easily deserved an Oscar for her perfect performance)  The movie is sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic, and always compelling.  However, be warned that the end is somewhat unsatifying, and you may be better off just shutting the movie off once Zoe starts stalking her stalker.  Yes, the movie is flawed, but if you watch it for what it is (an incredible character study), you'll fall in love with it just like I did.  I can't wait for Robin Tunney's next starring role.",4,"If I could, I'd give Robin Tunney 10 STARS!",1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,4501,"['quot', 'Cherish', 'quot', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lonely', 'woman', 'named', 'Zoe', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'who', 'result', 'being', 'carjacked', 'stalker', 'framed', 'crime', 'placed', 'house', 'arrest', 'forced', 'wear', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'police', 'can', 'monitor', 'whereabouts', 'movie', 'then', 'brilliant', 'character', 'study', 'watch', 'Zoe', 'try', 'cope', 'isolation', 'eventually', 'develop', 'independence', 'trying', 'prove', 'innocence', 'Bill', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'deputy', 'charge', 'visiting', 'regularly', 'examine', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'good', 'dark', 'comedy', 'made', 'great', 'one', 'thanks', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'performances', 'given', 'actors', 'ESPECIALLY', 'ROBIN', 'TUNNEY', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lavish', 'enough', 'praise', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Zoe', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'opinion', 'Ms.', 'Tunney', 'quot', 'Cherish', 'quot', 'usually', 'saw', 'forgettable', 'movies', 'quot', 'Vertical', 'Limit', 'quot', 'quot', 'Craft', 'quot', 'blew', 'away', 'one', 'Robin', 'necessary', 'emotions', 'one', 'scene', 'actually', 'had', 'fight', 'back', 'tears', 'Robin', 'Zoe', 'delivery-man', 'stay', 'isolation', 'left', 'so', 'starved', 'company', 'scene', 'Robin', 'Zoe', 'had', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'tormented', 'tightly-wound', 'Bill', 'roller-skating', 'apartment', 'examine', 'bracelet', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'well', 'kind-hearted', 'Zoe', 'befriending', 'crippled', 'man', 'who', 'once-weak', 'Zoe', 'becoming', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'impossible', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'Zoe', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'grabs', 'attention', 'as', 'soon', 'screen', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'ending', 'credits', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'Robin', 'Zoe', 'Tim', 'Bill', 'fact', 'according', 'commentary', 'growing', 'romance', 'Zoe', 'Bill', 'was', 'originally', 'not', 'script', 'was', 'added', 'filming', 'director', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'movie.So', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'did', 'only', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'Well', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'really', 'fell', 'apart', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'had', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'quot', 'Zoe', 'stalking', 'stalker', 'quot', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'before', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'say', 'key', 'character', 'completely', 'illogical', 'towards', 'end', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'was', 'reason', 'character', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'director', 'was', 'apparently', 'trying', 'go', 'twist', 'end', 'fact', 'one', 'people', 'commentary', 'mentions', 'person', 'who', 'movie', 'why', 'character', 'did', 'end', 'NOTE', 'TO', 'DIRECTOR', 'everyone', 'someone', 'clear', 'up', 'same', 'point', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'on-screen.Another', 'problem', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'uneven', 'inconsistant', 'times', 'often', 'wonder', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'acting', 'way', 'are', 'perfect', 'example', 'when', 'Bill', 'Zoe', 'police', 'officer', 'rude', 'comment', 'then', 'Zoe', 'quot', 'thanks', 'quot', 'bill', 'screaming', 'throwing', 'out', 'yet', 'very', 'next', 'scene', 'together', 'Zoe', 'warm', 'openly', 'flirts', 'Bill', 'did', 'miss', 'something', 'happened', 'inbetween', 'found', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Zoe', 'was', 'supposedly', 'unable', 'keep', 'man', 'longer', 'one', 'date', 'never', 'called', 'back', 'yet', 'man', 'who', 'Zoe', 'movie', 'almost', 'instantly', 'love', 'commentary', 'what', 'already', 'suspected', 'lot', 'movie', 'improvised', 'actors', 'result', 'movie', 'feels', 'uneven', ""n't"", 'always', 'flow', 'well.So', 'summarize', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'mainly', 'incredible', 'acting', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'easily', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'perfect', 'performance', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'dramatic', 'always', 'compelling', 'However', 'be', 'warned', 'end', 'somewhat', 'unsatifying', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'shutting', 'movie', 'once', 'Zoe', 'stalking', 'stalker', 'Yes', 'movie', 'flawed', 'watch', 'what', 'incredible', 'character', 'study', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'next', 'starring', 'role']",N/A

Bowler,"[0, 0]","An emotionally young, socially awkward techie (""Zoe"") is working in downtown San Francisco, kept company by her online community and bizarre fantasies about her boss.Zoe gets talked into going to an after-work get-together. In a lapse of judgement she gets drunk on cutesy cocktails (courtesy of her boss), then hops into her car to drive home and instead gets steered into a bike-mounted policeman while struggling with a stalker.Predictably, the local court system has little patience for a tiny techie with a whopper of a tale about a lurking stalker being at fault. Of course, they don't throw the book at her... Instead they give her an ankle-bracelet and toss her in an unimproved wharehouse-space somewhere in SOMA/Mission [1].Robin Tunney's role plays to her strengths and it shows. She has a signature look of feral concentration in common with only one other major-league actor [2], and it comes out repeatedly in this film. Her acting is more than on par.Tim Blake Nelson holds it down in the role of the police-surveillance tech who checks up on her, initially increasing her supervision to ludicrous levels, then befriends her as she struggles to stay sane and eventually triumph over her stalker.Ricardo Gil deserves special mention as the wheelchair-bound neighbor downstairs, who shows her the ropes of surviving life on a short tether - in more than one way.There's a dark comedic genius at work in a number of scenes, particularly when her stalker loses track of her and has an emotional breakdown set to the 80's hit single ""She's Gone"". . .

The set up is quick and to the point, getting us into the loft and Zoe's head.

724215,A3GTH1VXNRYZS5,B0000714E7,"""j_james""","[8, 12]","While this film sports an impressively interesting premise (a woman is tragically forced into a fatal accident, charged with manslaughter and forced to live with an electronic bracelet (house arrest) in a cheap loft in a dangerous neighborhood while she awaits her trial), very good acting, a decent script, compelling set design, camera work and lighting, and a nostalgic sound track, Cherish doesn't entirely succeed.Tim Blake Nelson (O' Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Good Girl) is superb as the leading man who reluctantly falls in love with Robin Tunney's unfortunate victim, Zoe Adler. Tunney, herself, leaves little to be desired as she spends much of the feature isolated on camera. It's always an accomplishment when you spend large chunks of a picture alone and still suceed. Unfortunately, the plot details are too often unfulfilled and characters are underdeveloped. One wonders how Zoe goes from blabbering, blubbering nerd with terrible fashion and hair (who somehow still manages, at 29, to get an impressive list of first dates) to a self-assured, Run Lola Run-like independent woman without a single interlude of self-pity. Even Zoe's angry scenes--when she finally lashes out about the extreme injustice being inflicted on her--come too late and seem forced. One also wonders what it is about Zoe that causes her mysterious stalker to choose her as the subject of his fascination; her love for classic pop songs (including Tainted Love and the 60's version of Cherish) simply isn't enough. The presence of a gay, Jewish drawf bound to a wheelchair (while a frequent source of comic relief) is also jarring. Only one, relatively minor scene, discusses these identifying characteristics and, I might add, does so very quickly. It feels almost as though this character is supposed to be more significant than he actually is. In addition, there is a running string (literally) of logical inconsistencies that one cannot reconcile. Zoe has 57 feet worth of wandering room. This means she can't go down the stairs outside of her loft, but it doesn't stop her from climbing a ventilation shaft, nearly to the roof of her building. Lastly, the film evidentally spans two years, but one would be hard pressed to know it.Still--despite all of these flaws--the film is quite entertaining. There are some chilling, unconvential romantic moments between Nelson and Tunney that leave the viewer excited and laughing. In fact, Nelson's Bill Daly is the only character whose actions are never doubtful, in large part because of these scenes. There are also some biting lines of dialogue (""I wouldn't date so many men if even one would call me back"") and a lot of fun moments as Zoe attempts to escape and then circumvent her imprisonment. There is also a wonderfully suspenseful scene as Zoe--through Daly's help--seeks out the true criminal.In other words, none of the aforementioned faults are deal breakers. The viewer still watches the bulk of this film feeling fulfilled, feeling satisfied. And then comes the final sequence of the flick. While the end isn't necessarily a deal breaker either, it does come very very close, as it is unexplained and largely illogical.In the end, Cherish has several memorable moments and is certainly worth viewing, but it is not without faults.",3,Cherish,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,3284,"['film', 'sports', 'impressively', 'interesting', 'premise', 'woman', 'tragically', 'forced', 'fatal', 'accident', 'charged', 'manslaughter', 'forced', 'live', 'electronic', 'bracelet', 'house', 'arrest', 'cheap', 'loft', 'dangerous', 'neighborhood', 'trial', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'script', 'compelling', 'set', 'design', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'nostalgic', 'sound', 'track', 'Cherish', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'succeed.Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Good', 'Girl', 'superb', 'leading', 'man', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'love', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'Zoe', 'Adler', 'Tunney', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'much', 'feature', 'isolated', 'camera', 'always', 'accomplishment', 'when', 'spend', 'large', 'chunks', 'picture', 'alone', 'still', 'suceed', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'details', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'unfulfilled', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'One', 'how', 'Zoe', 'blabbering', 'blubbering', 'nerd', 'terrible', 'fashion', 'hair', 'who', 'somehow', 'still', '29', 'get', 'impressive', 'list', 'first', 'dates', 'self-assured', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run-like', 'independent', 'woman', 'single', 'interlude', 'self-pity', 'Even', 'Zoe', 'angry', 'scenes', 'when', 'finally', 'out', 'extreme', 'injustice', 'being', 'inflicted', 'come', 'too', 'late', 'seem', 'forced', 'One', 'also', 'what', 'Zoe', 'mysterious', 'stalker', 'choose', 'subject', 'fascination', 'love', 'classic', 'pop', 'songs', 'including', 'Tainted', 'Love', '60', 'version', 'Cherish', 'simply', ""n't"", 'enough', 'presence', 'gay', 'Jewish', 'drawf', 'bound', 'wheelchair', 'frequent', 'source', 'comic', 'relief', 'also', 'jarring', 'Only', 'one', 'relatively', 'minor', 'scene', 'identifying', 'characteristics', 'might', 'add', 'so', 'very', 'quickly', 'almost', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'significant', 'actually', 'addition', 'running', 'string', 'literally', 'logical', 'inconsistencies', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'reconcile', 'Zoe', '57', 'feet', 'worth', 'wandering', 'room', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'stairs', 'outside', 'loft', ""n't"", 'stop', 'climbing', 'ventilation', 'shaft', 'nearly', 'roof', 'building', 'Lastly', 'film', 'evidentally', 'two', 'years', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'know', 'it.Still', 'flaws', 'film', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'are', 'chilling', 'unconvential', 'romantic', 'moments', 'Nelson', 'Tunney', 'leave', 'viewer', 'excited', 'laughing', 'fact', 'Nelson', 'Bill', 'Daly', 'only', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'never', 'doubtful', 'large', 'part', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'biting', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'would', ""n't"", 'date', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'even', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'back', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'Zoe', 'escape', 'then', 'circumvent', 'imprisonment', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'Zoe', 'Daly', 'help', 'out', 'true', 'criminal.In', 'other', 'words', 'none', 'aforementioned', 'faults', 'are', 'deal', 'breakers', 'viewer', 'still', 'bulk', 'film', 'feeling', 'fulfilled', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'then', 'final', 'sequence', 'flick', 'end', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'deal', 'breaker', 'come', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'unexplained', 'largely', 'illogical.In', 'end', 'Cherish', 'several', 'memorable', 'moments', 'certainly', 'worth', 'viewing', 'not', 'faults']",N/A

The 2002 film also features another understated performance by Tim Blake Nelson (best seen in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""O Brother, Where Art Thou?) as the officer that checks her electronic restraint and, as the cliche goes, fall in love with the girl.That's about the only cliche you'll find in ""Cherish,"" an offbeat and original film that traverses this young woman's life from accident to house arrest to impending trial, her attempts to escape, and to an ultimate showdown with the stalker (Jason Priestly) that was responsible for her falling into the despair of house arrest. Tunney's determination to prove her innocence, and the extremes she takes to do so, is what keeps viewers involved. In the process, she exploits and loses most of the few friends.The film has other notable actors -- Liz Phair as her boss and Lindsay Crouse -- and nostalgic rock tunes from 20 and 30 years earlier help build the romantic aura that never takes off in the relationship between captive and captor-deputy Nelson.

724217,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0000714E7,L.A. Scene,"[2, 2]","Sometimes it doesn't take the big name Hollywood studio or the big name Hollywood star to make a very good movie.  Such is the case with the movie ""Cherish"".  ""Cherish"" is one of those films I happened to stumble on.  I'd categorize ""Cherish"" as an ""Indie"" (independent) film.  After watching the movie, I realized that this was one of the most entertaining movies I had seen in some time.  In addition, the movie uncovers perhaps one of the best, yet unnoticed acting performances in recent years by Robin Tunney.  I'm very surprised that Tunney did not go on to bigger and better things following ""Cherish"" because she delivers a performance that could have easily be Academy Award material.In ""Cherish"", Tunney plays Zoe Adler.  Zoe is someone who is basically socially inept and somewhat of an introvert.  Zoe struggles with her lack of social skills both in the office (where she works as a computer animator) and in the social scene as well.  She is also romanticist who loves 1970s and 1980s music and gets immersed in the songs of that era.  Unknown to Zoe, she is being pursued and followed by a stalker (played by Brad Hunt)  Zoe's life will change when the stalker finds Zoe going to her car to pick up her cell phone.  The stalker takes Zoe hostage and forces her to drive.  When a police officer discovers that something strange is going on in the car, the stalker takes control, runs down the police officer and kills him.  Following the incident, the stalker leaves the scene and Zoe is left facing a homicide charge.  While awaiting her trial, her lawyer arranges for Zoe to be put in the ""Bracelet Program"".  This is a program that essentially places Zoe under house arrest and uses a bracelet to electronically track that Zoe stays indeed under house arrest.  Once the house arrest begins, the story basically takes on three sub-plots:1) The main subplot involves a transformation in Zoe's social ineptness.  House Arrest places Zoe in an isolated mode where she is not allowed to leave her apartment.  This forces Zoe to confront her introverted personality and a good chunk of the movie will focus on Zoe's attempts to break free of the bracelet program.  This will result in a transformation from her socially inept personality to a bolder personality.  This is where you will see Tunney shine.  Tunney is completely believable in her portrayal of Zoe from beginning to end - from socially inept, through her transformation, to eventually demonstrating a bold personality.2) The second subplot involves Zoe's relationship with police officer Bill Daly played by Tim Blake Nelson.  Daly plays the officer responsible for monitoring Zoe in the bracelet program.  To some extent, Daly also suffers from social ineptitude.  At first Daly is frustrated by Zoe - in particular because she is trying to break free of the bracelet program.  This results in Daly putting stiffer restrictions on Zoe in the program.  However as the story unfolds, Daly eventually takes a liking to Zoe and develops feelings for her.  Nelson does an admirable job playing Daly, but his performance is not as strong as Tunney's.3) The third subplot involves Zoe's attempt to find out who framed her for the murder.  This wraps around the other two subplots in that Zoe eventually finds an ally in Bill Daly while at the same time takes bold steps to prove her innocence.  In a way, this completes Zoe's transformation from being a socially inept person.  It is this subplot where the film reaches an exciting climax.There are really two elements that contribute to this film - both audibly and visually.  Director Finn Taylor deserves a lot of credit for integrating these elements into the film.  From an audio standpoint, this film uses music perhaps as good as any film I have seen.  The music will grip you and match up  perfectly to the scenes.  Perhaps the best example of this is when Zoe calls her missing cell phone and gets the stalker.  The stalker responds by putting on the stereo and blasting Daryl Hall and John Oates' ""Private Eyes"" into the phone.  The opening sequence (to the song ""Cherish"") is another good example of how music is integrated with a scene.  From a video standpoint, one thing that really shines out is the setting for where Zoe is under house arrest.  Zoe is confined to a large warehouse style apartment in a seedy part of San Francisco.  The large warehouse apartment is the perfect setting for Zoe to battle her isolation for being under house arrest.  Not only does the seedy section of San Francisco provide a great backdrop to the story, but the whole city provides one as well.  Perhaps one of the best scenes of the movie is when Zoe ""escapes"" from her apartment to try to prove her innocence.  There is a terrific scene of Zoe running through the streets of San Francisco to get back to her apartment before the bracelet monitoring catches her.There are two ""larger"" name performers who have small roles in the movie.  Jason Priestly has a very small role as Andrew, a man who Zoe takes an interest in.  Pop singer, Liz Phair makes her film debut as Brynn - a woman who works in Zoe's office.  However there is one other performance that stands out - Ricardo Gil.  Gil plays Max - a disabled dwarf who lives downstairs in the same building as Zoe and befriends her.  While Zoe can't go downstairs from her apartment, Max's disability prevents him from going up to see her - yet the two strike up a friendship.This movie was released in 2002 and both the film and Tunney's performance went largely unnoticed in many circles.  I've heard some complaints about the ending, yet I was satisfied with how the film wrapped up.  This is a very good movie - and one that you certainly will watch multiple times.",5,One terrific film that went unnoticed,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,5739,"['Sometimes', ""n't"", 'take', 'big',

The plot is refreshing and original--An eccentric woman named Zoe (Robin Tunney of The Craft and End of Days) accused of murdering a cop, goes under house arrest with the bracelet program (the bracelet on her ankle sets off an alarm if she tries to leave her apartment), and begins an unlikely romance with Bill (Tim Blake Nelson of O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Good Girl), the lonely and lovestruck man who monitors the program. Finn Yaylor's directing is superb and the soundtrack of 80's music is absolutely fantastic. Add to that a supporting cast feauturing Jason Priestly (perhaps sending up his 90210 character?), Nora Dunn, and indie rocker Liz Phair, a suspenseful, edge-of-the-seat climax, plus a semi-shocking revelation, and you have a truly enjoyable, extremely memorable film.

724221,A1RVAMP05UIIN3,B0000714E7,Nieuki,"[1, 2]","CHERISH is a twisted love story between a woman under house arrest, Zo (Robin Tunney), and Bill (Tim Blake Nelson), the man who attaches her ankle-bracelet monitor. It is also a thriller -- Zo has not committed the crime she's under arrest for and she is anxious to find the guilty party, who also happens to be her stalker. This film is a little confusing, not entirely successful, but has some noteworthy elements.It's another great performance from Nelson, a top-notch character actor. Bill, all business in his short-sleeved dress shirts and striped ties, hardly knows what to make of Zo, as she skates around her kitchen/roller rink, blasting tunes from the local 80's station (great soundtrack). Zo is difficult and flirtatious, which is equally confounding and alluring for Bill. In one of my favorite Bill moments, he methodically ages a brand-new boom box for Zo, which he 'nonchalantly' presents claiming it was an old one he had around the house.Robin Tunney can't quite make up her mind as to Zo's character, but it's an admirable attempt. The story first presents Zo as the frizzy-haired neurotic outcast of her office, excluded from a coworker's hot party, falling into bed with various men who never call, with no real sense of herself. Following the trauma of her arrest she retreats into a comfortably delusional mode: dressing up in various costumes and singing into her hairdryer in the mirror. Eventually fed up with the legal process she is inspired to take a more proactive approach to her time, trying to work around the confines of her geographical limitations, first to have more physical freedom and in the process, to find her stalker.The supporting cast is a hoot, including indie-rock goddess Liz Phair and not one, but two, Beverly Hills 90210 cast members. Jason Priestly is hilarious as the floppy-haired BMOC/object of affection of Zo's office, particularly as presented in misty fantasy sequences.Hardly a life-transforming experience, but worth a rental.",4,Totally tubular tunes &amp; twisted romance,1064448000,"09 25, 2003",2003,1989,"['CHERISH', 'twisted', 'love', 'story', 'woman', 'house', 'arrest', 'Zo', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'Bill', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'man', 'who', 'ankle-bracelet', 'monitor', 'also', 'thriller', 'Zo', 'not', 'committed', 'crime', 'arrest', 'anxious', 'find', 'guilty', 'party', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'stalker', 'film', 'little', 'confusing', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'noteworthy', 'elements.It', 'great', 'performance', 'Nelson', 'top-notch', 'character', 'actor', 'Bill', 'business', 'short-sleeved', 'dress', 'shirts', 'striped', 'ties', 'hardly', 'what', 'make', 'Zo', 'kitchen/roller', 'rink', 'blasting', 'tunes', 'local', '80', 'station', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Zo', 'difficult', 'flirtatious', 'equally', 'confounding', 'alluring', 'Bill', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bill', 'moments', 'methodically', 'brand-new', 'boom', 'box', 'Zo', ""'nonchalantly"", 'presents', 'claiming', 'was', 'old', 'one', 'had', 'house.Robin', 'Tunney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Zo', 'character', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'story', 'first', 'presents', 'Zo', 'frizzy-haired', 'neurotic', 'outcast', 'office', 'excluded', 'coworker', 'hot', 'party', 'falling', 'bed', 'various', 'men', 'who', 'never', 'call', 'real', 'sense', 'herself', 'Following', 'trauma', 'arrest', 'comfortably', 'delusional', 'mode', 'dressing', 'up', 'various', 'costumes', 'singing', 'hairdryer', 'mirror', 'Eventually', 'fed', 'up', 'legal', 'process', 'inspired', 'take', 'more', 'proactive', 'approach', 'time', 'trying', 'work', 'around', 'confines', 'geographical', 'limitations', 'first', 'have', 'more', 'physical', 'freedom', 'process', 'find', 'stalker.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'hoot', 'including', 'indie-rock', 'goddess', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'cast', 'members', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'hilarious', 'floppy-haired', 'BMOC/object', 'affection', 'Zo', 'office', 'particularly', 'presented', 'misty', 'fantasy', 'sequences.Hardly', 'life-transforming', 'experience', 'rental']",N/A

724223,A27M0CNORWZLG1,B0000714E7,Sheppdawg,"[1, 1]","In my late teen years, I was at a friend's house one night in the country. This movie came on really late on this particular night. As I watched it I became very intrigued. It's not your typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood movie. It was a relatively low-budget independent film. But it is one of a kind. You will probably never see another film like this. The soundtrack is phenomenal. And there's really only two characters. Robin Tunney is Zoe Adler, a quirky kind of girl that has a unique taste in music. She works at some kind of internet design company. And there's Tim Blake Nelson's Daly.She goes out one night with a man from work and gets pretty drunk. He offers to drive her home but she tells him that she has to go back to her car to get her phone first. When she gets in the car, a guy that's been stalking her forces her to get in and drive. They come up to a red light and there is a cop crossing the street. The cop looks at the car and Zoe's stalker pops his head up. The cop motions for her to pull over and stands in front of the car. The stalker orders Zoe to push the accelerator but she won't do it. He then forces her foot onto it and she hits the cop, killing him. The stalker slips out and leaves the scene. When the police find Zoe, they naturally give her a breathalyzer which she fails. She goes to jail and her attorney gets the judge to allow Zoe to stay in her own apartment with an ankle bracelet. She isn't allowed to leave. Enter Tim Blake Nelson as Daly; the ankle bracelet monitor guy. He works with the police but doesn't carry a gun. He works for the company that makes the electronic ankle bracelet.The fact that the majority of the movie takes place in her apartment is very creative. Watching Zoe keep herself occupied and finding things to do to keep her from going bored out of her mind is very entertaining to watch. And as her court date draws closer, she must find the man who was in the car with her so that she can prove she was innocent.A very creative and original movie by director Finn Taylor.
