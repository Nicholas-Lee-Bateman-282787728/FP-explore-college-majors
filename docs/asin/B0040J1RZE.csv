1379266,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B0040J1RZE,christmas lover,"[0, 1]",Ive read many reviws by people who are disapointed that Dean Cain has such a small role in this movie. While I have to  agree with that I have never been a fan of his outside of this movie. Not to get negatitive here but the whole superman thing has been done to death. Anyway we all have an actor or actress we dont care for but there seems to be an exception to the rule. That having been said lets get to the movie. One reveiever was upset that the nanny let the kids eat junk food have fun and undermined the mom aka her boss. I read this after I ordered the movie. Then I watched it once it arrived and the first thing I thought is I would have done the same thing. The mom had the kids eating healthy which I conceed is a good thing but not all the time.They were also on a schedule to the point of being robots and werent having fun. The one time they did have fun it was at the nannys expense. Now I dont consider pancakes junk food as a general rule but after youd been eating what they had I guess they would be. One thing I forgot to mention is that after several years of having them the parents had stopped having Christmas parties and the kids wanted to have one again. In the end they got what they wanted. So did everybody else including the nanny who almost lost her boyfriend because of a white lie.
