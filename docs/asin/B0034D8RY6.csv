The songs, which the film purports to be &#34;amazing&#34; are just &#34;so-so&#34; and I've never heard of any of them.  I don't understand the attraction of Victor Mature, but then, I'm not a woman.RIta ... now there's another story!  So beautiful, charming, and feminine in the old fashioned sense (not crass, &#34;manly,&#34; or witchy as the normal models of womanhood since the 1980s).  Sadly, there's much more of Victor in this film than Rita who appears at least 30 minutes into it (seems like much longer).",3,"Rita in color in ""the gay `90s""",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,554,"['Okay', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'songs', 'film', 'be', '34', 'amazing', '34', 'are', 'just', '34', 'so-so', '34', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'attraction', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'woman.RIta', 'now', 'story', 'So', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'feminine', 'old', 'fashioned', 'sense', 'not', 'crass', '34', 'manly', '34', 'witchy', 'normal', 'models', 'womanhood', '1980s', 'Sadly', 'much', 'more', 'Victor', 'film', 'Rita', 'who', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'much', 'longer']",N/A

In glorious technicolour, the story of a budding composer Paul Dresser,(played by Victor Mature) and his pursuit of Sal (Rita Hayworth) is a delight to the eye.  The story is on par with many musicals of this time, but don't analyse it, just enjoy it.To makes even better, this would have to be one of the best transfers from Fox, surpassing their restored musicals.

Victor Mature plays the lead male role, while Rita Hayworth plays a popular singer and his love interest.I did find Victor Mature loutish in the role of the composer and his performance amateurish. I just could not take to his character, and I wondered what the character, played by Rita Hayworth, ever saw in him. I just did not sense any chemistry between these two erstwhile lovers.Rita Hayworth does look absolutely gorgeous in this film but that alone is insufficient for me to recommend this film, which I found to be somewhat tedious. Rita Hayworth, however, gives an excellent performance, as does the supporting cast.

1321254,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B0034D8RY6,Noirdame,"[11, 11]","I managed to obtain a DVD copy of this wonderful Twentieth Century Fox musical that was recorded off the Fox Movie Channel. Rita Hayworth, loaned out from Columbia, is paired with Victor Mature in this wonderful Techincolor extravaganza set in the Gay '90s. Paul Dresser (Mature) is a poor country lad who wants to make it big on the stage with his music. After he meets the comely Mae (Carole Landis, who after the first thirty minutes of the film, vanishes from the scene), he makes his way to a stage production, only to have the gorgeous redhead star Sally Elliot (Hayworth) laugh throughout the entire act. In retaliation, he takes Mae to one of Sally's shows and they return the favor. She then steals one of his songs and uses it in her act. Paul and Sally continually bring out the worst in each other, tempers flaring, cutting up each other's wardrobe, fighting the strong attraction that all this aggression masks. Typically, they finally end up together, despite all the misunderstandings along the way.I can't understand why this film is not commercially available; it has all the ingredients for a DVD release. As Fox is currently releasing many of its musicals, hopefully this one will follow suit. Hayworth (who looks beautiful throughout, her singing dubbed as usual, but her dance numbers are never dull), was romantically involved with Mature at the time of filming. Their chemistry is good, but not as strong as the electricity she shared with her five-time costar, Glenn Ford. Phil Silvers, in a small part here, would later costar with Hayworth in ""Cover Girl"" (1944).This is a throughly enjoyable movie that deserves lavish DVD treatment.",5,"""The Pity Of It All"" That This Film Is Not On DVD",1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1660,"['managed', 'obtain', 'DVD', 'copy', 'wonderful', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'musical', 'was', 'recorded', 'off', 'Fox', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'loaned', 'out', 'Columbia', 'paired', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'wonderful', 'Techincolor', 'extravaganza', 'set', 'Gay', ""'90s"", 'Paul', 'Dresser', 'Mature', 'poor', 'country', 'lad', 'who', 'make', 'big', 'stage', 'music', 'comely', 'Mae', 'Carole', 'Landis', 'who', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'vanishes', 'scene', 'way', 'stage', 'production', 'only', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'redhead', 'star', 'Sally', 'Elliot', 'Hayworth', 'laugh', 'entire', 'act', 'retaliation', 'Mae', 'one', 'Sally', 'shows', 'return', 'favor', 'then', 'one', 'songs', 'act', 'Paul', 'Sally', 'continually', 'bring', 'out', 'worst', 'other', 'tempers', 'flaring', 'cutting', 'up', 'other', 'wardrobe', 'fighting', 'strong', 'attraction', 'aggression', 'masks', 'Typically', 'finally', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'misunderstandings', 'way.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'commercially', 'available', 'ingredients', 'DVD', 'release', 'Fox', 'currently', 'releasing', 'many', 'musicals', 'hopefully', 'one', 'will', 'follow', 'suit', 'Hayworth', 'who', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'dubbed', 'usual', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'never', 'dull', 'was', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Mature', 'time', 'filming', 'chemistry', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'electricity', 'shared', 'five-time', 'costar', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'small', 'part', 'here', 'would', 'later', 'costar', 'Hayworth', 'Cover', 'Girl', '1944', '.This', 'throughly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'lavish', 'DVD', 'treatment']",N/A
