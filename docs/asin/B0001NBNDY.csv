Set up a mysterious and intriguing scenario. sprinkle it with suspense and uncertaintly and begin an almost Hitchcock-ian style premise - then develop none of it.Guns, bombs and car crashes are substituted for plot points.

811714,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B0001NBNDY,Amazon Customer,"[5, 8]","Philip K. Dick was one of America's finest science fiction writers, not so much for his characterisation or actual writing but more for the quality of ideas. Those ideas have been translated into several interesting movies including ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"". ""Minority Report"", and the less well known ""Impostor"", and ""Screamers"".Now it's the turn of former Hong Kong director John Woo to take on Philip K Dick in the movie ""Paycheck"". For uncritical John Woo fans it may have something to offer. For fans of science-fiction it's a much less rewarding enterprise.Engineering wizard Michael Jennings (played by Ben Affleck) has voluntarily agreed to have his memory wiped. He's employed by big corporations to reverse engineer the inventions of others, so that they can market the product for themselves. To escape detection they clean his memory of all knowledge of what he has done.Usually Jennings gives up a couple of months of his memories at a time, but on this occasion he takes on a three year job from an old friend Rethrick (Aaron Eckhardt). WE can see Rethrick is a bad guy in about 30 seconds, but despite having known him since they were kids, Jennings has never managed to figure this out. Maybe his brain works only on computers.Jennings is told that that job will earn him an eight figure sum in terms of stock options, and he'll never have to work again. It seems too good to be true, and it is. When he returns to the world after having had his memory wiped, he discovers that he has earned nothing at all. He's forfeited his stock options and left himself an envelope of personal possessions filled with items he doesn't recognize. He has to figure out what these items mean, or what they are for, if he wants to unravel the mystery.Not long after discovering that he has no money, Jennings is apprehended by the FBI who use their own methods to try to retrieve whatever's in his mind. He manages to escape form them using the objects he has in his envelope, and it becomes apparent - through one message he sent to himself in the envelope - that he somehow has knowledge of the future, and that if he uses these objects at the right time and in the right way he will survive it.Plot hole number one. If the future is unchangeable anyway, then it doesn't really matter what he does with the objects he has had sent to himself. And if it's changeable then much of the central concept of the film, which I won't give away too much, is complete nonsense.Of course one problem with this idea is that if the central character knows what's going to happen anyway and knows how to get out of it where's the suspense for the movie audience? Well the best thing the film-makers can come up with is one recurring image he keeps having of a bullet flying right at him that he doesn't know how to get away from. That's the only suspense we have up until the scene actually occurs.What is reality? What does it mean to be human? These are questions that fascinated Philip K. Dick. But neither John Woo nor screenwriter Dean Georgaris are really up to the task of dealing with these intellectual concerns. Instead they change it into a chase thriller, with a little cursory romance thrown in, in which the character has most of the tools needed for his survival in his hands.The cursory romance is provided by Uma Thurman as biologist Dr. Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman), who for some reason manages to research for the same company without having her memory wiped. After taking on the central role in ""Kill Bill"" it's must be a thankless task to be cast as the generic girlfriend in a John Woo movie. Romance isn't a big thing in Woo's universe, and is usually handled by having the man and woman look at each other in slow motion while the camera moves.Other elements are pinched from other movies based on Dick's stories. Two scenes are stolen from ""Minority Report"" alone, one in which he is reverse-engineering someone else's invention, the other of which takes place in a shopping mall, and uses a balloon in the right place at the right time.Not much here is not predictable. Including the fact that even though Affleck is playing the ultimate nerd, he also knows martial arts, and how to do hair riaising motor-bike stunts. You can only find yourself groaning when you see Affleck using an old kung fu movie routine to show that his memory wipe hasn't damaged his co-ordination.""Face/Off"" showed that John Woo could work well with a science fiction concept IF that sci-fi concept didn't require too much analysis or thought and if it dovetailed with his longstanding movie concerns. ""Paycheck"" is Woo on autopilot, and Philip K Dick's original idea is wasted. And someone should tell the director that repeating the same shot of a dove flying in slow motion in every darned film you make is NOT a sign of directorial style. I like birds, but I wish someone would roast this one. Spend your money on ""Paycheck"" and you might be willing to pay to have your memory wiped of that decision.",1,No Pay Off,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,4999,"['Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'was', 'one',

Dick short story, the guy who wrote the inspiration for Minority Report, which I loved.  The previews made this movie look like it had it all; a good plot, cool stunts, and great effects.  Well, more or less, it did have all of those.  The thing that it lacked was acting talent.To say that this movie disappointed me would be an understatement.  As I said, the story, effects, and stunts were all up to par, but I could not concentrate on them due to Ben Affleck's HORRIBLE performance.  The other actors were bad, but nowhere near Affleck.  Also, it seemed that whenever Affleck was on-screen, he brought down the performances of his costars.Anyway, here's the story.  A few decades in the future, Affleck plays Michael Jennings,a reverse engineer; he takes apart existing products to find out how they work, then builds newer and better models for rival companies.  When he is finished with his jobs, his old bosses erase his memory so that he won't tell the company's secrets.  Soon, Jennings is approached by his old friend Jimmy Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) with a proposal for a job that will make them both very rich men.  The catch is that it will require three years of his life to complete.  Jennings agrees, but when three years are up and his mind is erased, Jennings learns that he forfeited his paycheck, and instead receives an envelope containing nineteen strange items that don't seem to have any connection to each other, which makes sense because they have nothing to do with each other.  They each serve a purpose in helping Jennings find the truth about what he did for three years.  Along the way, he rekindles a romance with Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman), who he met during his tenure with Rethrick's company.This is a John Woo film, so we are guaranteed good action sequences.  We got his trademark motorcycle chase, and the ending shootout was good, but after a while, I started wondering how an engineer became such a Superman.  Well, I guess that there could have been worse problems with the story.I have read that Matt Damon was originally considered for the Jennings role, but he didn't take it because it was too similar to The Bourne Identity.  Why didn't he take this role?  He is such a better actor than Affleck, and he could have possibly saved this movie.  But alas, we are stuck with this Affleck-induced bomb.

There are similarities sure but no aliens, no people laying in water tanks that can see the future, no false accusations of future murders, and no secret agents hiding their identity.In short Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings, an engineer that backward engineers just about anything, then has his memory erased to avoid litigation for borrowing other peoples intellectual property or copyrights, and then take them to the next level in development. It is as though he never worked at the company or created what he creates. A bit contrived? Perhaps but that is for the lawyers to quarrel over.Good support from Thurman and Giamatti. I think the movie is entertaining. Plenty of John Woo style action, and a hero fighting the odds. Some real imagination went into this and I did not feel like I was watching some other movie.

I'm like anybody else in that I wish Hollywood would do better, but until they do, I enjoyed this movie. Ben Affleck plays an engineer who takes jobs that result in him having his memory of what he did erased at the end. He takes on a 3 year project for an old friend thinking of the massive payday when its over. When the project is over he discovers he has signed away his rights to the money and left himself an envelope of seemingly useless objects instead. He uses the objects to piece togeher the mystery of just what he did for the last 3 years. The movie is at its best in the first half as you try along with Affleck to figure out what's going on. The second half humps up the action and the number of bullets that never find their target. Uma Thurman plays the love interest but isn't given all that much to do, nor is Paul Giamatti as a trusted friend.

Chases, explosions, fight scenes- a child could string them together and come up with something more interesting than Paycheck. The heartbreak of this movie is watching its principals on the downsides of their once promising careers. Ben Affleck, whose cockiness has overshadowed his considerable talent, plays no one else but Ben Affleck&trade; here. His performance is indistinguishable from his performance in anything else he has done in the past few years. Paul Giamatti cashes his own paycheck and seems appropriately humiliated. Uma Thurman is all wrong for her role- she looks too much like her hardass Kill Bill self, not like a beautiful botanist love interest (what is it about Hollywood that is so brutal on young actresses? It's like the stress of the life etches itself on their faces) John Woo rehashes every tired trick from his movies and from apparently, from a thousand other dreary actioners. Woo recycles that tired two gun standoff cliche not once but twice. The stupity and manipulation of it is nauseating. It's an obvious crowd-pleasing ploy that will please no one.Nothing about this film seems real. The chases and fight scenes are phony and thrill-less. Not once was my blood pumping. It was all so predictable and half-hearted I wondered how it managed to avoid a February release. The plot holes are enormous: how did Affleck's character suddenly know how to use the time machine? How did Thurman's character suddenly know how to fight? For that matter, how many computer scientists do you know that can defeat hired killers? Nothing is explained about Affleck's phenomenal fighting prowess and never do understand the leaps in logic that explain how he figures out which objects to use at what point. Woo rushes thorugh the proceedings so quickly one can only assume he wants to go home and weep for his squandered promise.If I were Ben Affleck I would drop all these big-budget stinkers and go back to acting. America is going to forget why it made him a star. The guy can act, but seemingly chooses not to. John Woo- I don't know. I haven't been impressed with any of his Hollywood work. I have no interest in Uma Thurman, so I have no opinion.I just despair for the future of American movie-making if Paycheck is the best those three can manage. I'm not hard to please and I love a good popcorn movie. I also am a big fan of Philip K Dick, whose ideas are wasted here (the original story the film is based on is not one of his masterworks, truth be told). Paycheck is not a good popcorn movie.

811734,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B0001NBNDY,Daniel K.,"[20, 22]","Paycheck, the new sci-fi action thriller from John Woo delivers some great action and entertains on a high scale.  Ben Affleck is better, (eagerly trying to redeem himself after the huge debacle of Gigli).  Uma Thurman does just fine and Joe Morton and Paul Giamatti shine.Now the premise of this film might throw you off, but it shouldn't.  Knowing that this film is based on the work of Philip K. Dick who wrote Blade Runner, Minority Report and Total Recall you can expect something new.  The film while similar to The Bourne Identity definetly has its differences.  In fact, Matt Damon was originally offered the lead role in Paycheck but he declined because he said it was too similar to his role in The Bourne Identity.Essentially, Affleck plays Mike Jennings, a big computer engineer.  His clever mind has enabled him to make a new program.  Mike is soon offered a huge job offer by his good friend Jimmy Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart).  After he's done the job he gets a huge paycheck, hence the title of the film.  But his memory but be erased, and so he'll have no recollection of what his job was, since it is very secretive and confidential.  After his memory is erased he soon learns he has a girlfriend, played by Uma Thurman.  She along with his good friend Shorty played nicely by Paul Giamatti are the only ones he can trust.Though the movie isn't as predictable as it may seem, it does build up with some suspense.  And as I stated earlier it delivers with the typical action of a John Woo flick.  From here we get a great BMW motorcycle chase, (similar to M:I-2, though it's hard to say which was better) along with some other action sequences.Paycheck is rated PG-13 for Intense Action Violence and Brief Language.

What a mistake I made. Sure it's true that Ben Affleck usually has about all the charm and acting ability as a cardboard cutout of himself, but in Paycheck, he actually does occasionally show a bit more talent than usual.Affleck aside, Paycheck is a stylish mystery that does manage to more than hold your interest. John Woo's direction gives the film its' near frenetic pace, while allowing the viewer enough time to process the new clues as they are uncovered. Uma Thurman is fantastic to look at even when she has dirt on her face, and clearly, this is what Woo was intending when he put her in the role of a gorgeous scientist who steal's Ben's character's heart. Sure lady scientists who happen to border supermodels in appearance is a bit unrealistic, but no more so than the gratuitous and unnecessary motorcycle chase, so characteristic of this genre of movie.Those slight shortcomings aside, Paycheck delivers on its' promise to thouroughly engross the viewer by delivering a future scene much more feasible than other more weak kneed futuristic thrillers that only rely on special effects to catapult their stories along.

John Woo is a talented director, but he is completely unsuited for this sort of film.  The dark paranoiac style in Philip Dick's writing has not been used to greatest advantage in film except in 'Blade Runner', which ironically did not cling closely to the story, however, 'Paycheck' pushes alienation from the spirit of the story to new heights.  Neither does 'Paycheck' show the humor or spirit, director Woo's films are famous for, leaving Paycheck's unnecessary and out of place chase scenes feeling like a death mask of a John Woo film.From a performance perspective, Affleck and Thurman are ill matched romantically, with this casting choice made worse by director Woo's decision to play up the romantic aspects of the film.  The supporting actors, particularly Aaron Eckhart turn in a strong performance however.Despite the poor directing, miserable and underdeveloped script, lack of strength as either an action, or science fiction film, and an unhappy ""near future"" look that looks only Hollywoodish and phony, Paycheck is not a genuinely awful film, and someone satisfied with a generic commercial movie might not be too severely disappointed.

811739,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0001NBNDY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 4]","In 2003, popular director John Woo would return with a sci-fi thriller adapted from a short story titled ""PAYCHECK"" written by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (known for popular novels such as ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"", ""Minority Report"", ""Screamers"" and ""Next"", etc.) and a screenplay written by Dean Georgaris (""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2006) and ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"").It would bring together well-known talents such as Ben Affleck (""Daredevil"", ""Sum of All Fears"", ""Pearl Harbor"", etc.), Uma Thurman (""Kill Bill"", ""The Avengers"", ""Pulp Fiction"", etc.), Aaron Eckhart (""The Dark Knight"", ""The Wicker Man""), Colm Feore (""24', ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""Changeling"", etc.) and Paul Giamatti (""Sideways"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""Shoot `Em Up"", etc.).The film cost about $60 million to make and grossed over $96 million in the box office.  While Director John Woo received praise for his work on the film from several critics, unfortunately Ben Affleck was not so lucky as he received the worst reviews for his performance for the film, earning him the ""Worst Actor"" award for the Golden Raspberry Awards.VIDEO & AUDIO:""PAYCHECK"" features a 1080p High Definition transfer.  There are times where picture quality is good but surprisingly, there are quite a bit of dust and scratches that show up throughout the film. Because the film utilizes a lot of blacks, you can often see the white speckles showing up and for a 2003 film, I didn't think I would see so much.What works in the favor for ""PAYCHECK"" is John Woo's way of directing.  John Woo is one of the few men who edits as he shoots and has the film already preconceived in his mind and knows what shots he wants.  Joining him for the ride are talented cinematographers Jeffrey L. Kimball (""Star Trek: Nemesis"", ""Hostage"", ""Mission Impossible II"", etc.) and Steadicam operator Gregory Lundsgaard (""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"", ""The Spirit"", ""Gridiron Gang"").The shots that Woo chooses and the visuals are amazing and during the indoor scenes, you get quite a bit of darkness and the outdoor scenes, the transfer looks good.  But  again, not great.  The dust particles of course are not going to deter anyone's enjoyment of the film, but for those expecting the best transfer on Blu-ray, this is one film that needs some cleaning up.As for audio, fortunately the audio was great.  The film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital) and because of the many action scenes, you get great utilization of audio coming from all channels and even low frequency bass coming from the subwoofer.  I notice some scenes with a crowd, you will be able to hear the crowds through your rears.  Music taking advantage of bass but most of all chase scenes, crashes, explosions and bullet sounds directed through the various speaker channels quite nicely.  The audio was a major plus for this Blu-ray release.As for subtitles, subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:The ""PAYCHECK"" Blu-ray Disc release includes the following special features:* Commentary by Director John Woo - This film features on John Woo talking about the cast and the various shots and what he wanted to get.  Woo talks about the various revisions done on the film and more.* Commentary by Screenwriter Dean Georgaris - Similar to Woo, Georgaris talks about the storyline and the scenes incorporated from the short story to film.  Also, the revisions made to the screenplay.* Paycheck: Designing the Future - (18:14) Featuring interviews with Director John Woo, Producer Terence Chang, Production Designer William Sandell, Visual Effects Supervisor Gregory L. McMurry and the cast.  How John Woo took the role and his style of directing.  Both Affleck and Thurman are big fans of John Woo, so for them, it was a great experience to work with him.  Also, learning about the talents and how they prepared for the role and John Woo talks about why he enjoyed working with the cast.  From the making of the film to storyboards, set design and visual effects, this is covered in the featurette.* Tempting Fate: The Stunts of Paycheck - (16:48) Interview with Gregg Smrz (Stunt Coordinator) and John Woo about the stunts in the film.  From the motorcycle chase scene, to the building of the construction sites, how Ben Affleck wanted to do his own stunts, no CG used for the fight scenes.  Things were pre-planned.  Why they chose to go for no martial arts and more of a rugged, football/brawling fight moves and more.* Extended/Deleted Scenes - (12:37) Featuring seven deleted and extended scenes.  For example, Dr. Porter talking to her friend during the party about Jennings and trying to learn more about him.JUDGMENT CALL:""PAYCHECK"" is actually a film that had a lot of potential.  I really enjoyed the storyline of reverse engineering but also having the opportunity of seeing into the future and the ramifications if one had that technology.  Philip K. Dick's sci-fi stories from ""Total Recall"" and ""Blade Runner"" are sci-fi classics that you know that you are going to get a storyline that sci-fi geeks (like myself) can go nuts over.Having John Woo as a director is like the icing on the cake.  His camera shots, the way the film is cut, the use of his trademark dove, if there was a director that could make this film a fun, entertaining action film, John Woo is a perfect choice.With that being said, unfortunately, the screenplay by Dean Georgaris and Woo's main focus on the action took what could have been an intellectual thriller, to a film that features mostly all acting and no substance for the characters of Michael Jennings and Dr. Porter.  One is an engineer and one is a scientist, but they ended up being more superhero-like that somehow, due to the lack of any character development to make us really care for these two characters, the storyline and even the acting just falls a bit flat.The film is entertaining but somehow, Ben Affleck doesn't come alive as an engineer and action star for this film, John Woo wanted Matt Damon originally (especially since he's shown what he brought to the Bourne trilogies).  Uma Thurman, great to see her doing more action since her ""Kill Bill"" films but her character was not exactly used efficiently.  Paul Giamatti was like the comic relief of the film and Aaron Eckhart did an OK job but again, his character was not used efficiently.As for the Blu-ray release, I was a bit surprised by how much dust was evident throughout the film and that is something I really don't like to see for any film when transferred on Blu-ray.  The audio was well done but you want the picture quality to match the audio quality in HD goodness and unfortunately, it doesn't happen for this release.  Also, you are not getting anything new from the original DVD release, so if you own the DVD and wonder if it's worth double dipping, unfortunately I have to say no.""PAYCHECK"" was indeed a film with a lot of potential but for Philip K. Dick stories, you want to have a smart, sci-fi thriller in combination with the action but most of all, good character development.  Unfortunately, the film did not meet that potential.For those who want a straight-up action film, you will definitely be entertained by ""PAYCHECK"" but for those who want a storyline much deeper, unfortunately ""PAYCHECK"" suffers from lack of strong character development, not-so-effective acting and a compromised adaptation from short story to film.",3,"Blu-ray: Enjoyable John Woo action film

This tends to be a tricky and somewhat dangerous way to earn a living, but he can't turn down an offer in the range of eight figures (plus stock options) in exchange for two years of his life spent developing a very special machine.There's just one problem.  After the job is done, he awakens to find he has signed away his entire fortune in exchange for about 20 household items such as a paperclip and a can of hairspray.  It's tough enough to prove you've been swindled when your memory has been erased.  It's worse yet, when people are trying to kill you.People said 2003 would be the year of The Matrix.  It's more like the year of Uma Thurman.  Fresh off the set of Kill Bill, her alien features complement the futuristic role as ""the love interest.""  There's no chemistry between them, but it's not surprising since she stomachs the worst pick-up lines since Affleck did Pearl Harbor.Plot holes are prevalent, such as breaking into Big Scary Corp. to destroy the evil machine only to use it again for some illogical reason.  Hollywood has churned out so much implausible garbage that I'm not even affected.  My main disappointment was with the only director that I never imagined could make an ultimately boring movie.  There's none of John Woo's signature style, save for a ""dove through the doorway"" sequence.  I yawned through the motorcycle chase.  He even resorts to amateurish camera shakes to create the illusion something exciting is happening.  The story has been done before, from the philosophical future-think paranoia of Spielberg's Minority Report, to the heavy-handed action of Verhoeven's Total Recall.  John Woo takes a lot from both and ends up with a lot of neither.So what are you getting?

While it has some definite promise, the ghastly acting of Ben Affleck and the over-actioned story-line make it a mess.A man named Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a brilliant scientists, who suddenly discovers that his past job, his past boss, and the past three years have all been wiped from his brain. No, it's not some kind of bizarre hangover -- Jennings finds out that he agreed to do some kind of secret work and then have his brain wiped, in exchange for a fortune.Unfortunately, the ""paycheck"" is one that can't be cashed -- Jennings learns that he gave up the money, and left himself a bag of seemingly random items. Using them, he struggles to find out what he did before his memory was erased, and the secret machine that can change the world as we know it. But now the police are after him, and he's rapidly running out of time.Erase the scifi element from ""Paycheck,"" and you have a boringly typical action movie -- attractive love interest, hero on the lam, plenty of money and explosions. At times, the talents of Philip K. Dick peep out of the turgid plot, only to be swamped again by another action scene.""Paycheck"" is unnecessarily heavy on the action: There's a lot of motorcycle acrobatics and stuntman fights, despite the hero being a nerdy engineer. John Woo doesn't seem entirely sure what to do in the scenes that don't involve any action. And the dialogue is straight from bad cop shows: ""Hey, I said you were okay, okay?"" ""Okay!""But the overactivity of the plot would be okay.... if it didn't have so many holes in it. In any scifi plot, there are going to be holes, but the ones in ""Paycheck"" gape -- some are big enough to make the entire story utterly useless. For example, why didn't Jennings write himself a detailed letter rather than leaving himself cryptic, random clues?Ben Affleck demonstrates yet again that bland Ken-doll looks are all he has going for him. His acting is nonexistant -- an accusatory ""you erased my memory!"" has less passion in it than ""you botched my dental filling!"" Uma Thurman wanders through looking confused, as if she isn't sure what she's doing in this movie. She does her best to salvage the plot, but there is only so much she can do.

I like the movies that he chooses. I liked ""Gigli,"" alot. I enjoyed ""Daredevil."" ""Chasing Amy,"" was pretty good, and I loved ""Dogma."" But this review is about his preformance in ""Paycheck."" Nothing that he does in the past is going to change how I felt about him in this movie. I thought he was pretty bad in this movie, but he doesn't hold the candle to the preformance of Uma Thurman which was just the worst acting that I ever saw. Her preformance cost the movie a star and a half, and the other half a star was because of the weak, but good preformance of Ben Afflick. The biggest and only problem with this movie was the preformances.I really loved the story. It was just so brilliant and clever, and interesting. It begins in the present year and we are introduced to Michael Jennings who is hired by companies to update current technologies for them. But the deal is that once he does his work for them, they wipe his mind of all memory of him working there. His next client is an old friend of his, Jimmy Rethrick, and it is for three years of work. He relizes that he is not going to miss the three years of something that he is not going to remember, so he says yes. He also says yes because he is going to be working with Racheal Porter, played by Uma Thurman. He also says yes for the 90-something millions dollar paycheck.Three Years Later...He's done. They wipe his memory and he goes to collect his paycheck, when he discovers that he gave up his money in exchange for an envelope containing nineteen everyday items. What I could remember:1)key card2)crossword puzzle3)lighter4)bullet5)ringI can't remember the others but those and the other items confuse Micheal, because he can't figure out why he would give up all that money for these stupid items. More problems arise when he is arrested by two agents who demand to know what he has been doing for the past three years because it is a matter of secruity. He escapes from the police, and goes looking for Jimmy. Jimmy is surprised that Micheal is not dead yet and sends Wolfe to go and do the deed. Micheal finds Racheal and together they find out that Micheal left himself the clues to stops something horrible from happening... in the future.The great part about ""Paycheck,"" is that the story, and what happens throughout the film, is go clever and interesting that I was engaged throughout the whole film. I even liked the final twist, or trick, during the last scene of the movie. I only wish that the makers found a better actress to play Racheal then Uma Thurman because I felt that she did a terrible job in it. I thought that she was brilliant in ""Kill Bill, Volume One,"" but she just didn't make the cut in this one. This would have been a perfect film if the actors just worked alot more on their preformances. Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy was good, but Afflick and Thurman really needed some work.

It's just not up to the par of the usual John Woo flick. It just seems like Woo is going through the motions.John Woo made a name for himself in America with movies like 'Broken Arrow', 'Face/Off' & 'Mission Impossible: 2'. Those were very good action movies. They all follow the same guidelines really. John Woo has a tendency to repeat many of his ""trademarks"" in his flicks. There is the hero (Ben Affleck), the hot girl (Uma Thurman, looking a little rough here), the bad guy (Aaron Eckhart), the cool henchman (Colm Feore), the doves, the guns, the inevitable motorcycle chase scene, etc., etc.The difference between those movies and 'Paycheck' is that the story was better, the acting was better, and we hadn't seen all of this many times before. This movie tries it's hardest NOT to be a Sci-Fi flick. John Woo doesn't exactly like those kinds of movies, so he turned this into a action, romance, and drama picture.The story is average. It never seemed to pull me in as much as I wanted it to. I kept waiting for something else to happen to really grab me, but it never did. It is an interesting script and it has it's moments, but it was just missing something.And when will people realize that Ben Affleck is NOT a great actor? Some of it may be his own fault for picking the crappy movies that he does, but he just seems miscast in many of his movies. He is NOT a good action hero. He gets through this movie, I guess. But, he is no Tom Cruise.Uma Thurman is pretty much wasted here. I could think of hundreds of other actresses that they could have got for this and much cheaper. She does get to kick a little butt in the end, but she is just coasting through this role. I don't think it's really her fault, as she doesn't have much to work with.Aaron Eckhart plays the cookie-cutter bad guy. While he does an admirable job of looking somewhat evil and being a prick most of the movie, he never really takes it to that next level. I have always liked the villians in John Woo's movies, and I was excited to hear Eckhart was playing this role. He just downplays the part, which can be a good thing. I just wished there was more energy from him.The two best characters in the movie were supporting. Paul Giamatti's funny, cowardly character brings some fun to the movie. Colm Feore's henchman role is very well done. He really seems like he is having fun playing a ruthless badguy and he does it well.Other than all of that, there isn't much more to say about this movie. It's your run of the mill action flick, basically. I was just frustrated with it because it could have been so much better. The story was interesting. The acting was average. It had a good look to it and the action scenes were decent. I just expect more out of John Woo. Let's hope his next movie doesn't leave us with the feeling that he and his actors are just in it for a ""paycheck"".Special Features: There are seperate commmentaries by John Woo & the screenwriter, Dean Georgaris. There are two decent featurettes, 7 deleted and extended scenes, and that's about it. I feel that is kind thin for a ""collector's edition"", but it's not bad.

Cool!Now, after he collects his fee, he is offered another job by a college buddy named Jimmy (Eckhart). Turns out Jimmy is a bad guy, although you can see that by his evil countenance... and that of his stoogie (Colm Feore). I'm not spilling any beans here. Jimmy wants Michael to do something bad -- like build a machine that sees the future. Jimmy gets his machine, pays Michael 92 million dollars, end of story.Nope.Michael developed a conscience.

It also helps that a man who knows how to shoot an action film was at the helm, John Woo.The film follows Ben's character on his quest to find out who he is, that is of course after everything he knew has been erased by his former boss. The thing is he seems to have left himself some clues and tips along the way. Along with some items that e just may need including when he comes out of it.

""Paycheck"" provides some food for thought about memory and its relevance, as well as the possibility of predict the future and its consequences. Ok, so the characters are a bit too typical: Ben Affleck plays the average hero, Uma Thurman is his pretty and smart girlfriend, Paul Giamatti shines as the comic relief loser and Aaron Eckhart gives shape to the cold-hearted, one-dimensional villain.

811761,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0001NBNDY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","If nothing else, if this movie motivates you to look up its short story source by Philip K. Dicl&lt;, then it's already done its part. But there's more to the film adaptation than that. PAYCHECK is a crackling good science-fiction thriller in which serendipity isn't a fortuitous accident as much as it is an engineered stroke of good fortune. In the near future world of Michael Jennings, time travel is impossible, yes, but what about ""time viewing""? Michael Jennings (Affleck) is a brilliant reverse engineer. He takes on assignments in which his clients hand over (perhaps a rival company's) new piece of technology, and he then works backwards to figure out its design, maybe even improve on the design. A disclosure agreement dictates that, once a project is done, Michael undergoes a procedure which erases all memory of his time spent working on the job. Michael, a rudderless guy, is cool with this arrangement.Michael's latest secret project steals away three years of his life. Surfacing from his latest mind wipe he learns that he's forfeited his eight figure paycheck. Instead he's handed over a mysterious manila envelope containing twenty ordinary everyday objects. In the coming hours Michael Jennings will learn that these innocuous objects, one at a time and if employed properly, will transform him into an escape artist. The wild Hitchcockian man-on-the-run theme starts when Michael is taken in by the FBI on charges of treason. He may even be a suspect in the murder of a government physicist toiling in the weapons department.For me the main hook is in seeing how Michael applies these random items - a book of matches, a paper clip, a crossword puzzle, etc. - to extract himself from one life-threatening scrape after the next. It's fun watching him piece the puzzle together, although, halfway thru the film, the audience is already in on all the cogent beats. But, c'mon, don't tell me there isn't an extra kick in that the figure guiding our guy thru the maze is none other than himself, or himself when he still had his memory and had gotten a peek into the future.John Woo shallowly explores the theme of hope versus fatalism. Wrap your brain around this: The murdered physicist had been experimenting with laser-enhanced lens so powerful it could see around the curvature of the universe. The physicist had theorized that ""if you could see around a curve that went on forever, you would end up back where you started, looking at yourself,"" er, except you're not looking back at yourself now, you'll be looking at yourself in the future. Sounds like fancy gobbleby-goop to me. Suffice to say, there is now a device - which Michael had helped create - that can peek into the future.The John Woo aesthetics are in full exhibit. The constantly moving cameras, the kinetic action ballet, the sheer style, the Mexican standoff with guns, that damn bird... The action sequences are dynamically staged (mostly), the stunts are amazing. I love watching John Woo at play. But PAYCHECK is also grounded by a strong love story, which is when Uma Thurman demonstrates her acting chops. Check out her performance in the scene in which her character, biologist Rachel Porter, realizes that the man she's been with for the past three years doesn't at all remember her. It cements her as someone with whom a rudderless gent like Michael would fall in love. Michael would never abandon Rachel. He'd think ahead. But the villains realize this as well.I thought that Ben Affleck was fairly good. He's certainly got the action hero creds, and he doesn't embarass himself in the dramatic moments. The supporting cast is solid, featuring Paul Giamatti (not enough scenes), Joe Morton, Aaron Eckhart, and Colm Feore who's got one of those faces that just smacks of sinister.PAYCHECK expands on the source, but isn't as good as. And I do admit that the big climax - consisting of an explosive but dull and dragged out action set - undermines the story. Sucks that Woo would pick the last leg of the film to not deliver on the action. And yet I liked the nod to Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST and the sci-fi thriller elements, the plot twists and that Twilight Zone vibe, and I'm thinking of two episodes: ""A Most Unusual Camera"" and ""What's in the Box."" It's too bad that them shifty characters in those two episodes weren't near as savvy as our working backwards, thinking ahead engineer. They probably can't stick fight, either.The DVD's extras: Audio Commentary by director John Woo; Audio Commentary by screenwriter Dean Georgaris; ""Designing the Future"" - the Making Of the Film featurette (00:18:13 minutes long);

811766,AJA7284SMHE0T,B0001NBNDY,"Infinite Catalyst ""C. Robert Dennis""","[2, 3]","First off, John Woo cannot direct actors.  He never has and he never will be able to.  John Woo is an action director, as you all know, ergo, anyone who watched this film and can't get off on the acting should really have know better.Every director (short of himself in ""Goodwill"") has had a hard enough time directing Affleck, especially when he is in the throngs of a who-knows-what emotional crisis that really shows in his performance here.  Uma Thurman gives Woo a full plate as well, coming out of the zany postmodern antics of Tarantino's death camp . . .This being said, I really loved the premise of this film.  It contained a very ""Minority Report"" feel to it, much like a Philip K Dick short story.  I really wouldn't be suprised if Paycheck is derived from one or more of Phil's more obscure novellas.The whole theory of reverse engineer is not only  meta-fascinating to me, I think it is probably already being implimented on primitive commercial/corporate levels, and will probably evolve pretty close to the predictions here.Affleck plays an IT mercenary of sorts, out for hire to mimic/ perfect new hardware/software being produced by the worlds best corporations.  He apparently gets in over his head when he accepts a 2 year job (that involves a two year memory swipe as well) that turns out to e a disaster.  The plot interfacing with the near-future time era is inconsistent if you pay attention, yet not overly abrasive.  I feel they execute plot very well in the film.  I loved the science fiction behind all of the gadgetry and and effectual reality, and I felt the concepts were portrayed solidly.Woo does a great job in the action sequences messing with all sorts of science fiction contraptions and creating creative visual concepts in fighting scenarios.

As a sci-fi buff and a Blade Runner fan, it is hard to let this one go by.The story is different, which is what I like.  However, the thing that makes the movie neat gets old after seeing it work 5 times... and you need to watch all 20 fall into place to solve the big mystery.There was one thing that really erked me, only because it happened in Minority Report as well.  I work with computers, and therefore, security.  I've got it down so that anybody who leaves the company usually can't get back through the security system before they even leave the door the last time.  This isn't bragging, any company is like this.  However, it seems that this ex-employee (as well as the one in Minority Report) can be hunted by the company and law-enforcement and yet nobody blocks their security to prevent them from coming back in.  COME ON!!!!!!!  And the unbelievability doesn't stop there, but that is the one that had me screaming... AGAIN!!Worth watching?  For die-hard sci-fi lovers, oh yes (once)!!!  For somebody who likes explosions and intense action?  Er, that one is up in the air, that department could have been better (and more believable).  Anybody else, I would say no.

Bottom line: The jury is still out. ""Good Will Hunting"" is one of my favorite movies, but I suspect that is owing to Matt Damon & Robin Williams more than Affleck. I suspect Affleck's supporting role in ""Hunting"" is about as good as he gets. But I'm not certain--perhaps he will get some role at some point that will see him shine. I haven't seen it yet. In fact, I don't understand why he's still getting major roles. He is, however, OK in this movie. Not bad at all.This movie is nowhere near ""Blade Runner"" & it's not as good as either ""Total Recall"" or ""Minority Report.""

811769,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0001NBNDY,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 1]","John Woo's science fictionish ""Paycheck"" may be a bit much at times, (it really strains one's credibility), but it certainly holds your attention. There are echoes of ""Minority Report,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Memento"" in this action-packed mystery thriller, which entertains but doesn't quite make-it to the quality level of the aforementioned films. The movie actually feels like a compilation of former, better flicks. ""Paycheck"" is based on Philip K. Dick's short story. Unfortunately, Director Woo's version bears little resemblance to that story.Ben Affleck plays Michael Jenn, a computer genius and ""reverse engineer,"" who steals technology and applies it for other companies. He deconstructs high-tech equipment to see how it is put together and what makes it work. Then he reassembles the same equipment, which he makes even more high tech, for any company willing to pay his price. His paychecks are very high but there is a BIG catch. He must agree to have his memory deleted so that he cannot implicate himself or anyone involved in the techno theft. A Non Disclosure Agreement taken to extremes, if you will. Only the memory regarding the job is effected, however. But the memory removal process can get a little dicey. The machine which does the erasing from the brain cannot be allowed to overheat, or the person attached to the brain will become a vegetable.A friend and colleague offers Michael the job of a lifetime with Allcom Inc. It will last for three years - he will have to give up the memory of three years of his life. However the paycheck will be 90 million dollars - enough so that Michael will never have to take another job. He accepts. Three years pass in a heartbeat. Memory is removed and Michael wakes up to discover he has signed-away his 90 million dollar paycheck. He forfeited the money, seemingly voluntarily. He has no recollection why he would do such a thing. Has he been tricked into working for free? He is also given an envelope containing the belongings he had on him when he began the assignment. Michael had been asked to surrender them before beginning the job. But the 19 seemingly unrelated trinkets are not his. There are a pack of cigarettes, hairspray, matches, ball bearings, etc. - all seemingly worthless. He has never even seen them before. He soon learns the envelope's contents are worth a fortune. They are clues, but he can't remember how to use them to get what he wants.Most of the film revolves around figuring out what each item is to be used for. There is lots of action here. Michael does much running, escaping, chasing and hiding, along with his love interest, Rachel, (Uma Thurman), a somewhat ditzy biologist. There is almost too much action at times. Much of it is gratuitous and really distracts from the story. Or perhaps all the action is filler to make-up for lack of content. It's a shame, as this could have been a really intriguing mystery. There is no character development - not that kind of film. ""Paycheck"" is fun and cool, but ultimately does not deliver. It lacks the depth I prefer in a sci-fi film.JANA",3,"Intriguing Premise, But The Film Fails To Deliver!",1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,3086,"['John', 'Woo', 'science', 'fictionish', 'Paycheck', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'times', 'really', 'one', 'credibility', 'certainly', 'attention', 'are', 'echoes', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Memento', 'action-packed', 'mystery', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make-it', 'quality', 'level', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'movie', 'actually', 'compilation', 'former', 'better', 'flicks', 'Paycheck', 'based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'Director', 'Woo', 'version', 'little', 'resemblance', 'story.Ben', 'Affleck', 'Michael', 'Jenn', 'computer', 'genius', 'reverse', 'engineer', 'who', 'steals', 'technology', 'applies', 'other', 'companies', 'high-tech', 'equipment', 'see', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'what', 'work', 'Then', 'same', 'equipment', 'even', 'more', 'high', 'tech', 'company', 'willing', 'pay', 'price', 'paychecks', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'BIG', 'catch', 'must', 'agree', 'have', 'memory', 'deleted', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'implicate', 'anyone', 'involved', 'techno', 'theft', 'Non', 'Disclosure', 'Agreement', 'taken', 'extremes', 'will', 'Only', 'memory', 'regarding', 'job', 'effected', 'however', 'memory', 'removal', 'process', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'dicey', 'machine', 'erasing', 'brain', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'overheat', 'person', 'attached', 'brain', 'will', 'become', 'vegetable.A', 'friend', 'colleague', 'offers', 'Michael', 'job', 'lifetime', 'Allcom', 'Inc', 'will', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'memory', 'three', 'years', 'life', 'However', 'paycheck', 'will', 'be', '90', 'million', 'dollars', 'enough', 'Michael', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'take', 'job', 'Three', 'years', 'pass', 'heartbeat', 'Memory', 'removed', 'Michael', 'wakes', 'up', 'discover', 'signed-away', '90', 'million', 'dollar', 'paycheck', 'forfeited', 'money', 'seemingly', 'voluntarily', 'recollection', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'been', 'tricked', 'working', 'free', 'also', 'given', 'envelope', 'containing', 'belongings', 'had', 'when', 'began', 'assignment', 'Michael', 'had', 'been', 'asked', 'surrender', 'beginning', 'job', '19', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'trinkets', 'are', 'not', 'are', 'pack', 'cigarettes', 'hairspray', 'matches', 'ball', 'bearings', 'etc', 'seemingly', 'worthless', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'before', 'soon', 'envelope', 'contents', 'are', 'fortune', 'are', 'clues', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'use', 'get', 'what', 'wants.Most', 'film', 'around', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'item', 'be', 'used', 'lots', 'action', 'here', 'Michael', 'much', 'running', 'escaping', 'chasing', 'hiding', 'love', 'interest', 'Rachel', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'somewhat', 'ditzy', 'biologist', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'times', 'Much', 'gratuitous', 'really', 'distracts', 'story', 'perhaps', 'action', 'filler', 'make-up', 'lack', 'content', 'shame', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'Paycheck', 'fun', 'cool', 'ultimately', 'not', 'deliver', 'depth', 'prefer', 'sci-fi', 'film.JANA']",N/A
811770,A2A9BEEZW66YRT,B0001NBNDY,John 'Deacon Blue',"[4, 4]","It seems this film's reputation may be suffering from incorrect genre identification. This is an ACTION drama with a futuristic twist. John Woo says the original story was SciFi, but he took ""80% of that out"" so he could make a more believable movie. (Perhaps it would've received kinder reviews if he'd left more in.) The characters ARE developed well enough to create interest & empathy. Perhaps not successful as SciFi, ""Paycheck"" is a decent action flick.The actors all do an excellent job of staying real & interesting, but nobody goes over the top. Woo intentionally spreads the focus among the ensemble rather than making another Star-Driven vehicle. Oh, there are stars, and the villains do get edgy for sure; but there are no scene-stealing overacted performances. That's just fine - some of us just do not need to be visually assaulted by acting style in order to enjoy a performance. Ben Affleck continues in his understated 'regular guy' mode. Uma Thurman, fresh from her 'Kill Bill' gig, looks smart & tough, and that's exactly how she acts. If anybody in this cast does a very polished job with the action itself, it's her - BUT it's very believable & in character. She just may have become THE leading lady for sincere & skilled action. The supporting cast is excellent, the action is generally slugfest 'NFL' style instead of 'martial arts masters', and the principals do most of their own stunts.The premise is handled in a believable way (much better than the typical time-travel stories which unravel) with well done tech-FX. Chases, explosions & other stunts abound, but don't overpower the story. The action is REAL live action, mercifully not blue-screen CGI overdone to death. (OK, there are 1 too many ""mexican standoffs."")The characters actually develop & portray relationships that don't require a lot of screaming, cursing & nudity to convey. Wow. Some of us LIKE that.

Affleck plays an engineer that takes on top secret projects for money. Afterwards, he undergoes a procedure that destroys his memory of the project so he doesn't remember a thing. For the good looking, affluent player that he is is these gaps in his memory can be a problem, (like how did the Red Sox do in the playoffs?)He contracts for a top secret job that will pay him 90 million dollars. The catch? The project will take several years. He memory will be erased for all that time. When he comes back freshly scrubbed, he discovers  he has somhow forfeited all his money. Why? He doesn't know. He has fallen deeply in love with Uma Thurman. He doesn't know her. However he did leave behind a large envelope with clues from which he must figued out what happened. They are seemingly unrelated everyday objects: a diamond ring, a book of matches, a crossword puzzle, a crystal etc.He slowly starts piecing things together & getting reaquainted with Uma. There are no sex scenes, but you get the general idea that they are getting know each other all over again. He is being pursued by his former employer & the FBI.The climatic scene is the same, disappointing, cliche ending that you've seen a thousand times.

Ben Affleck does a great job as a computer programmer who does secret work for long periods of time and has his memory of it wiped.It is a slightly futurisitic movie with what would seem to be plausible technology for our world only a few years removed.  This movie is fun, the violence is mostly 'offscreen' so there is little or no blood, that was not the point of the movie, it was the action, not many real special effects, so the action was in the acting which really got to me.Affleck is definately the focus of the movie and he has two friends, one from prior to his three year excursion and one from his three years of work.  Paul Giamatti plays his best friend, Shorty.  You may remember him from Duets, he plays a really affable friend who is reliable.Uma Thurman plays Rachel, she does a great job as she helps Affleck figure out his predicament.This movie presents you with a puzzle that you are forced to figure out as Affleck figures it out.The movie is based in Seattle, so there is different scenery for those who like to view those things.If you want an edge of your seat thrill, this movie is it.

When it was first released, It didn't sound all that great, so I ignored it. Then by chance I came across a DVD of this movie and decided to watch it. What a surprise! This is now one of my favorite sci-fi movies.  Had I known that it was based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick, I might have paid more attention to begin with. Especially since he was the author of Minority report and Blade Runner (under the written title of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"").  One of the most outstanding things about this film is that there is no bloody gore, no sex, and not a lot of strong language. It is very fast paced, filled with action and suspense, great acting, and includes some of todays finest actors. I thought it one of Uma Thurman's best performances, and Ben Afflick  was at his best.

811778,A2IF5C0I5BH11F,B0001NBNDY,Kala,"[4, 7]","I went in to Paycheck with low expectations and it was just as I thought it would be - boring.The basic story is Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) plays a reverse engineer who does work for companies then gets his mind wiped afterwards, just picks up the paycheck and has no idea what he did for the last several months.  He meets up with a friend of his, Jimmy Rethrick (played by Aaron Eckhart of the Core and Erin Brockovich), who offers him a job.  The catch is that it's going to be a 3 year job and the entire 3 years will be wiped from his memory when its over.He takes the job and afterwards goes to pick up his 92 million dollar paycheck only to find he forfeited all funds and sent himself 19 apparently useless items, that end up being clues and lifesavers that help him figure out what he did the last 3 years that was so bad.  The only interesting part about the movie was seeing how each item was used in an interesting way to further the plot.  Also starring in the movie as Michael's girlfriend (whom he no longer remembers since his mind was wiped) is Kill Bill's Uma Thurmon (who can do SO much better than this!).The action scenes are just ""ok"" and very typical John Woo (lots of cars that randomly blow up.. if cars in real life blew up as easily as they do in John Woo films, I would be dead right now!).  I did enjoy the BMW motorcycle chase, which was probably the best action sequence of the entire film.The dialogue is horrible as is the casting.  Although I get made fun of a lot for it, I do like Ben Affleck and when he's cast right, I think he's a great actor.  I think he did just ok in this role.  Uma Thurmon is a fantastic actress, but the writing for her part was just horrible.  And whoever did her hair needs to find a new job - they made her look absolutely terrible.The film is full of ridiculous events, real forehead slappers.  One of the most memorable is when Michael is being questioned by the FBI, who for some reason have him in a chair that revolves around and around and around, and they have the camera moving around it as well, it almost made me dizzy.  Then for some reason, one of the FBI agents lights one of the cigarettes from Michael's envelope, which sets off a smoke detector.  You'd think these agents would KNOW there are smoke detectors and NOT light a cigarette.  Anyways, Michael fortunately has some glasses in his envelope that help him see through the powder fire prevention system that has all the FBI agents bumbling around like idiots because they can't see.  (Great system!  If there is a fire and this goes off, no one will be able to see!  They'll all fumble around like chickens with their heads cut off and eventually die because they can't get anywhere!)The concept of the film is interesting and I'm willing to forgive that most movies involving time travel or ""seeing of the future"" will have unexplainable plot holes, this one was just poorly done.  The ending especially is anticlimactic and just plain BAD.  I give it two stars because while the writing was terrible, I did enjoy parts of it (mostly I enjoyed anticipating what each item would be used for).",2,"Bland, boring, ridiculous.",1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,3133,"['went', 'Paycheck', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', 'just', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'boring.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Michael', 'Jennings', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'reverse', 'engineer', 'who', 'work', 'companies', 'then', 'mind', 'wiped', 'afterwards', 'just', 'up', 'paycheck', 'idea', 'what', 'did', 'last', 'several', 'months', 'up', 'friend', 'Jimmy', 'Rethrick', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Core', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'who', 'job', 'catch', 'going', 'be', '3', 'year', 'job', 'entire', '3', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'wiped', 'memory', 'when', 'over.He', 'job', 'afterwards', 'pick', 'up', '92', 'million', 'dollar', 'paycheck', 'only', 'find', 'forfeited', 'funds', 'sent', '19', 'apparently', 'useless', 'items', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'clues', 'lifesavers', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'last', '3', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'only', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'seeing', 'how', 'item', 'was', 'used', 'interesting', 'way', 'further', 'plot', 'Also', 'starring', 'movie', 'Michael', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'no', 'longer', 'remembers', 'mind', 'was', 'wiped', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Uma', 'Thurmon', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'SO', 'much', 'better', '.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'ok', 'very', 'typical', 'John', 'Woo', 'lots', 'cars', 'randomly', 'blow', 'up..', 'cars', 'real', 'life', 'blew', 'up', 'as', 'easily', 'do', 'John', 'Woo', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'right', 'now', 'did', 'enjoy', 'BMW', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'action', 'sequence', 'entire', 'film.The', 'dialogue', 'horrible', 'casting', 'get', 'made', 'fun', 'lot', 'do', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'when', 'cast', 'right', 'think', 'great', 'actor', 'think', 'did', 'just', 'ok', 'role', 'Uma', 'Thurmon', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'writing', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'whoever', 'did', 'hair', 'find', 'new', 'job', 'made', 'look', 'absolutely', 'terrible.The', 'film', 'full', 'ridiculous', 'events', 'real', 'forehead', 'slappers', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'when', 'Michael', 'being', 'questioned', 'FBI', 'who', 'reason', 'have', 'chair', 'around', 'around', 'around', 'have', 'camera', 'moving', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'made', 'dizzy', 'Then', 'reason', 'one', 'FBI', 'agents', 'lights', 'one', 'cigarettes', 'Michael', 'envelope', 'off', 'smoke', 'detector', ""'d"", 'think', 'agents', 'would', 'KNOW', 'are', 'smoke', 'detectors', 'NOT', 'light', 'cigarette', 'Anyways', 'Michael', 'fortunately', 'glasses', 'envelope', 'help', 'see', 'powder', 'fire', 'prevention', 'system', 'FBI', 'agents', 'bumbling', 'idiots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Great', 'system', 'fire', 'off', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', ""'ll"", 'fumble', 'chickens', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'eventually', 'die', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'anywhere', 'concept', 'film', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'willing', 'forgive', 'most', 'movies', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'seeing', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'unexplainable', 'plot', 'holes', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'done', 'ending', 'especially', 'anticlimactic', 'just', 'plain', 'BAD', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'writing', 'was', 'terrible', 'did', 'enjoy', 'parts', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'anticipating', 'what', 'item', 'would', 'be', 'used']",N/A

This was the promising beginning of John Woo's action film with popular actor Ben Affleck.It worked for about 45 minutes and seemed to peak at a certain point...until Affleck suddenly put 2 and 78 together and figured out what was going on. That came from nowhere. Then interest began to build again as the character started putting the pieces of his past together.Until the chase and fight scenes became so fantastic as to be inane, that is. Ever wonder how an actor can avoid 75 bullets shot straight at him from bad guys, who always stand perfectly still with automatic weapons, waiting for the hero to come up and kick them, knocking their weapons asunder and escaping to small spaces when none are available?If you answered yes, you'll love this movie. It has a good plot for about 40 minutes and good action for a little longer, but it falls apart from ridiculous action sequences and a plot that is simply too fantastic to believe.I enjoyed this for most of the first hour as escapist cinema but it became too much for me to accept soon thereafter.

811782,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001NBNDY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Having John Woo direct &quot;Paycheck&quot; was a big mistake because forcing this film, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, into a &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; type movie was the wrong move to make.  But after &quot;Bladerunner&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot; Hollywood apparently cannot conceive of doing one of Dick's imaginative science fiction stories as anything other than an action film.  Of course, look at the travesty they have planned for Issac Asimov's &quot;I Robot&quot; with its killer robots violating the First Law and I guess we should not be surprised.There is a major surprise in this film set up by the trailer, which introduces Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck), a brilliant scientist of some sort who does ultra secret jobs, gets his mind blanked for the period he worked, and then picks up a paycheck.  However, after his biggest job instead of a multi-million dollar paycheck he discovers that he has sent himself an envelope with 20 objects that he has never seen before (okay, he has seen them, he just does not remember any of them).  The inference in the trailer is that these are clues as to what he did and why he would give up the biggest paycheck of all.  It has to be something pretty big and pretty bad to give up all that money.  Chase scenes and fights are tangential to that and not all that impressive (the point of a motorcycle is not speed but manuverability, but apparently Jennings is not smart enough to know that and take advantage of it).But to get back to the crux of the problem with this 2003 film, those items are not clues but something more interesting that should have been the driving force of this story.  On the off chance that has not been given away already by what you have seen and heard about &quot;Paycheck&quot; I will refrain from saying more, because when I picked up on what was really happening was when I really got interested in this film.  But Woo focuses on the physical rather than the cerebral and this film jumps off the tracks.  You know things are just plain wrong when the best moves in an action film are done by a robotic machine.Ultimately, &quot;Paycheck&quot; reminds me of the few computer games I have played in the past such as &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; and &quot;Gabriel Knight,&quot; and I was excited by that idea.  This film needed to be more like &quot;Memento,&quot; where the emphasis is on being clever instead of dumbing everything down to action sequences that are decidedly unimpressive.  There are some great ideas at the heart of this movie but they were quickly forgotten and buried beneath substandard Hollywood schlock.

The day after I saw it, I asked myself if I had seen all of it. Indeed, I had. I simply could not remember how it ended because I'd lost all interest midway through. In considering the movie, the word `insipid' comes to mind.The premise is ridiculous. A man named Michael [Ben Affleck] is well paid by a nefarious corporation run by James Rethrick [Aaron Eckhart] to carry out jobs which require his memory to be erased at the end of each one. When he is offered a job which will wipe out two or three years of his life, he hesitates but is soon lured by an astronomical paycheck. When he `comes to' at the end of his mission, he finds that he has forfeited his pay. Then he receives a mysterious package containing several seemingly unrelated items. He goes on a hunt to discover the truth, no easy task considering that he can't remember anything.The plots of most sci-fi movies are ridiculous. The good ones, though, cause us to suspend disbelief, at least until after the movie is over. The great ones make us want really to believe the premise and to cast logic to the wind. [""Alien"" comes to mind.] ""Paycheck"" simply makes us roll our eyes and shake our heads.The other problem is Ben Affleck as the main character. I don't know if he really can't act, or if he has lately been so preoccupied that he doesn't feel like acting. Here, he tries vainly to act against the fine Mr. Eckhart and the incredible Uma Thurman.

But I wasn't - and I'm easily confused!The film features Ben Affleck as Michael Jennings, playing a very smart guy, who gets his memory erased after every 'job' he does (no smart jokes about Jennifer Lopez). For this, he receives a lot of money, and 8 weeks (the most he'd ever done) erased afterwards. Then he discovered he forfeited all right to getting paid beforehand, but he left himself a series of clues, to get his money back. At first, the clues seem like a load of nonsense (there's 20, but he only gets 19 - watch out for the surprise one and very cool one) It's weird, but cool, how he manages to work out the clues, solve the mystery, and grab the girl.As it's a John Woo movie, there are a couple of his trademarks. The dove (which totally doesn't make any sense), and the Mexican Stand Off (the latter of which I recognised from Face Off - it will seriously give you deja vu!)I wasn't sure about the chemistry between Ben &amp; Uma. Personally, I'm not keen on Uma as an actress - she quite often looks very weird. Joe Morton also stars in this, playing almost the same character he plays in Terminator 2, and looking loads older than he did in that and Speed - not aging well my man!There are also a lot of car-chases, guns, loud noise, and lots of running about, and holding an envelope, that despite everything it goes through, doesn't get blown up/wet/ruined once!When I saw the running time of the movie (1hr 54mins), I nearly died. But surprisingly, the film flew by, and was soon at the end.The ending was also surprisingly good, and I was filled with dread when I saw there was an alternate ending among the sparse extras. Normally, alternate endings are endings that weren't received too well at test screenings - meaning they're generally a lot of rubbish. But the alternate ending is just as good as the ending left in the movie - so much so, that I don't know which ending I prefer!This was a good film, despite what some reviewers say, and it's a very interesting concept, considering the film is basically based around 20 little, meaningless items.

When Affleck gets done with the journey he finds out that he doesnt have the money and he gave it away and he send himself 20 items to himself to help his memory.

811801,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0001NBNDY,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","Paycheck has a cool if somewhat recycled premise: our protagonist (in this case, an engineer played by square-jawed Beniffer - I mean Ben Affleck) works on reverse-engineering projects and then has his memory wiped so that there's no evidence left behind. But then comes along the job of his life - a multimillion dollar deal that has one catch...he must lose three years of his memory.So Michael Jennings (Affleck), who is a greedy bastard, takes the deal. A lot can happen in three years and of course, he manages to fall in love with the doctor (Uma Thurman) who he had a brief flirtation with at a party. He also worked on a top-secret project (it's spoiler time folks, so get ready)...[...] Jennings of course wants no part of the project so he has to send himself secret coded notes in the form of 20 generic, boring everyday items. Then he gives up all that money to ""keep him focused on those 20 items.""The movie's plot is intriguing. The initial science of memory wiping seems plausible. Jennings brain must be kept at a certain temperature or he ""turns into a vegetable"" during a process where they literally zap brain cells away. You lose brain cells every day, so this isn't quite as awful as it sounds. Of course, one of the problems is that the guy who does the zapping sees on screen what Jennings saw. So should HE have to be zapped too? Shouldn't it be an automated process run by a machine or something?There are a lot of plot holes like that, and once you go down that path the movie turns into a big, breezy pile of Swiss cheese. As I work for a Fortune 5 company myself, I know for a fact that if a highflying executive sold all his stock or gave up his shares, he'd be immediately called into an office to ask why. People don't just give up millions of dollars because they're having a bad day.The second memory wipe is also plausible - they insert a tracer into Jennings and then, when the three years are up, follow back to the point of the tracer and chemically wipe his brain. Since it's a chemical process, it's an imperfect one and Jennings has dreams and nightmares of what he saw.[...]John Woo has an issue with pacing. It's obvious he wants to show off his martial arts filming techniques and there are plenty of opportunities for Jennings to do just that. But they drag on too long. Jennings is also a fantastic motorcyclist - bizarre, since Rachel (Thurman) tells him he's ""only okay"" on the bike. Then we're subjected to a 10-minute-too-long action sequence of Jennings and Rachel being chased by cop cars, bad guys, and multiple car explosions.This happens again and again. The protagonists get into a tight spot and some of the time, Jennings McGyvers his way out. The rest of the time, he fights his way out. The engineer. Fighting his way out like a Marine.There's no chemistry between Thurman and Affleck. I'm not sure how there could be. I'm so accustomed to seeing Uma in movies where she's a tough, pushy, almost manly character that seeing her in pink and giggling seemed extremely out of character. Affleck does a fair job of trying to be bewildered and compassionate at the same time, but nowhere is there any evidence of the incredible brilliance that Jennings used to create the device or negotiate his way through the future.To sum up, Paycheck has all the twists of Total Recall but drags on its action sequences too long; it has all the mystery of Minority Report but not enough technical savvy to convince us it's a possible future; all the mind-bending antics of Memento but not enough carefully crated design to be a brilliant script, all the apocalyptic predictions of Terminator 3 but not the strength of its convictions to end the movie on a low note.",3,A cool if somewhat recycled premise,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,3707,"['Paycheck', 'cool', 'somewhat', 'recycled', 'premise', 'protagonist', 'case', 'engineer', 'played', 'square-jawed', 'Beniffer', 'mean', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'reverse-engineering', 'projects', 'then', 'memory', 'wiped', 'so', 'evidence', 'left', 'behind', 'then', 'job', 'life', 'multimillion', 'dollar', 'deal', 'one', 'catch', 'must', 'lose', 'three', 'years', 'memory.So', 'Michael', 'Jennings', 'Affleck', 'who', 'greedy', 'bastard', 'deal', 'lot', 'can', 'happen', 'three', 'years', 'course', 'fall', 'love', 'doctor', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'had', 'brief', 'flirtation', 'party', 'also', 'worked', 'top-secret', 'project', 'spoiler', 'time', 'folks', 'so', 'get', 'ready', '[', ']', 'Jennings', 'course', 'part', 'project', 'send', 'secret', 'coded', 'notes', 'form', '20', 'generic', 'boring', 'everyday', 'items', 'Then', 'up', 'money', 'keep', 'focused', '20', 'items', 'movie', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'initial', 'science', 'memory', 'wiping', 'plausible', 'Jennings', 'brain', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'certain', 'temperature', 'vegetable', 'process', 'where', 'literally', 'zap', 'brain', 'cells', 'away', 'lose', 'brain', 'cells', 'day', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'awful', 'course', 'one', 'problems', 'guy', 'who', 'zapping', 'sees', 'screen', 'what', 'Jennings', 'saw', 'So', 'should', 'HE', 'have', 'be', 'zapped', 'too', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'automated', 'process', 'run', 'machine', 'something', 'are', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'once', 'go', 'down', 'movie', 'big', 'breezy', 'pile', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'work', 'Fortune', '5', 'company', 'know', 'fact', 'highflying', 'executive', 'sold', 'stock', 'gave', 'up', 'shares', ""'d"", 'be', 'immediately', 'called', 'office', 'ask', 'why', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'up', 'millions', 'dollars', ""'re"", 'having', 'bad', 'day.The', 'second', 'memory', 'wipe', 'also', 'plausible', 'insert', 'tracer', 'Jennings', 'then', 'when', 'three', 'years', 'are', 'up', 'follow', 'back', 'point', 'tracer', 'chemically', 'wipe', 'brain', 'chemical', 'process', 'imperfect', 'one', 'Jennings', 'dreams', 'nightmares', 'what', 'saw.', '[', ']', 'John', 'Woo', 'issue', 'pacing', 'obvious', 'show', 'off', 'martial', 'arts', 'filming', 'techniques', 'are', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'Jennings', 'do', 'just', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'Jennings', 'also', 'fantastic', 'motorcyclist', 'bizarre', 'Rachel', 'Thurman', 'only', 'okay', 'bike', 'Then', ""'re"", 'subjected', '10-minute-too-long', 'action', 'sequence', 'Jennings', 'Rachel', 'being', 'chased', 'cop', 'cars', 'bad', 'guys', 'multiple', 'car', 'explosions.This', 'again', 'again', 'protagonists', 'get', 'tight', 'spot', 'time', 'Jennings', 'McGyvers', 'way', 'rest', 'time', 'way', 'engineer', 'Fighting', 'way', 'Marine.There', 'chemistry', 'Thurman', 'Affleck', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'could', 'be', ""'m"", 'so', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'Uma', 'movies', 'where', 'tough', 'pushy', 'almost', 'manly', 'character', 'seeing', 'pink', 'giggling', 'seemed', 'extremely', 'character', 'Affleck', 'fair', 'job', 'trying', 'be', 'bewildered', 'compassionate', 'same', 'time', 'nowhere', 'evidence', 'incredible', 'brilliance', 'Jennings', 'used', 'create', 'device', 'negotiate', 'way', 'future.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Paycheck', 'twists', 'Total', 'Recall', 'action', 'sequences', 'too', 'long', 'mystery', 'Minority', 'Report', 'not', 'enough', 'technical', 'savvy', 'convince', 'possible', 'future', 'mind-bending', 'antics', 'Memento', 'not', 'enough', 'carefully', 'crated', 'design', 'be', 'brilliant', 'script', 'apocalyptic', 'predictions', 'Terminator', '3', 'not', 'strength', 'convictions', 'end', 'movie', 'low', 'note']",N/A

It's not animated, but it might be better if it were. It's essentially a live action cartoon. (The Bad Guy, for example, might as well be wearing a sign that says Bad Guy.)  Once you realize that, you can have fun watching it.  But don't expect more.The plot doesn't have much to it.  The action scenes are fun  but in no way believable.  It's not a comedy but the acting is on the level of a sitcom.  Ben Affleck is a decent actor, or can be...he's been good in some movies... but is more or less monotone in this movie.  Uma Thermon is immensely talented but has little chance to show that in this film.Matt Damon is said to have turned down the role Affleck went on to play in Paycheck; it's a shame if true, because he could have transformed Paycheck into a better movie (though even he might have had a hard time delivering some of the lines believably).

If you are looking for something more along the lines of what PKD writes, this doesn't make the grade (except in one area, mentioned below), despite its origin. While I'm not familiar with the short story, I am familiar with PKD's writings and this does not fit his style.What this is, is a well-executed action-adventure film that has an element of SF in a present-day earth setting. Forget the chemistry between Thurman and Affleck (Thurman doesn't have chemistry in most of her films, anyway), the film is a nice little puzzle that carries you along with Affleck's character. After last year's raft of blockbusters, it isn't surprising to see films like this one disappoint so many people. This is no comic book adaptation of a superhero, though the previews might lead to suspect it is. It is nothing more than a mystery with an element of time travel mixed in (actually, there isn't any time travel involved... I said element and that's different).Is the story plausible? Well, the science isn't exactly current at any level, mostly because we don't have anything to remotely resemble it. So don't look for familiar theories validated through the story line. PKD never did that much, anyway... he was a futurist (i.e., Bladerunner) who liked to give us puzzles and some humor. Humor, this lacks, but that's okay because it is generally a serious film.But is the story plausible? Yes, as long as you don't try to tie in our current science (theoretical and practical).

I don't really like Affleck too much. This is the first movie of his that I really liked. There are two things that this movie excluded that most other spy movies don't: stupid superlatives and overused cliches and supercool protagonists who get all the ladies. Thank God. I get tired of James Bond's little player persona. The Bourne movies are pretty good, but Paycheck offers a pretty nice combination of action and substance, for an intelligent thriller. Spy Game had too much dialogue and not enough action.Anyway, Uma Thurman is sexy and she had an incredibly good performance. At first, she appears to be a bit manipulative toward Affleck and you find out that she is actually a genuine, loving character. People are after Affleck because he has access to something worth over $90 million, which makes all the action plausible, as opposed to Collateral, which only had $600-700 on the line. You get to see glimpses of Uma's fighting skills that she uses more often in the Kill Bill movies. There was a movie from 1995, also from Paramount, called Virtuosity, that was somewhat similar to this, but not as good in general. John Woo has delivered again. He is quietly becoming one of the best directors in cinema today. I'm not sure why so many people didn't like this - it was intelligent, but not so much as to confuse the average viewer.

811813,A1AF8GGNQ6LTBK,B0001NBNDY,Revelation Magazine,"[6, 10]","Paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do with them. These key concepts come courtesy of Philip K. Dick, via his original short story, though the film poorly represents the themes and conceits that have made his stories into unforgettable classics.  As a thriller, Paycheck depends upon our identification with its imperiled hero, but the movie is never able to make us truly care about Ben Affleck's Michael Jennings or his fragile state of mind, and that's something Dick would have found unforgivable. Only Uma Thurman really earns her paycheck here. The premise is high concept, and the prophetic threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion, but Paycheck is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes. The future world created by John Woo isn't nearly as engaging or convincing as, say, the captivating science fiction setting crafted by Stephen Spielberg for another high-profile Dick adaptation, Minority Report. For Paycheck, the comparison is not flattering. Sadly, Woo can't even keep himself from forcing his own creative preoccupations into the film, and a resulting motorcycle chase sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film's low. Some scenes are enjoyable, and there are fleeting flashes of wit and excitement, but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately conceived or placed. Paycheck isn't a smart film and, what's more, it sometimes assumes that its audience isn't even paying attention. As a result, the film never comes close to living up to its potential. The material and the audience deserve better. Unfortunately, Paycheck is forgettable fare and, truly, it is without any real payoff.--Brian A.

I love action, karate and shoot-blow-em-up movies so this fits me just right.What i find worthwhile thinking about is the line of reasoning that results from building the machine.1- we can see the future2- therefore the future is not open but determined3- therefore we have no hope4- the best we can do is move along a little faster this dytopic world.reminds me of the movie -Krull?- where the cyclops was tricked into sacrificing one of his eyes to see the future, but all the race saw was the time of their own death. the same nihilism and and resignation was the result.As an orthodox Reformed Christian i often argue for the strong deterministic side of the equation. God does know and foreordain all that passes. The trick is that He isn't telling us, except about the very end- He wins. This has always been a hopeful argument, God is in control, God is Love, therefore everything is right with the world despite immediate appearances.This movies take on open future and hope has me thinking about the various ways people have answered these questions. For example, the main character sees and modifies the future, he is hopeful and strives to overcome and change what he sees. Ignore the problems with this, for example, each item in the envelope requires a new future once it enters into the envelope etc. Just look at his reaction, prompted by the love he found while working on the time vision machine, a reaction of hope that motivates to action. He saw the future- two things, the destruction of the world and his own death. There was an element of resignation towards getting on the catwalk and dying throughout the movie, mostly in order to heighten our surprise at the watch going off. But nothing but hope and energy to save the world by destroying the world. Why would he be hopeful if the world was not?So it is still a weak determinism, he does multiple times change the future, it is probablistic not determined. His hope stills comes from the cracks, from the minor probability that he will alter events. Why would the world react differently? because of the herd effect, stupidity, the movie seems to hint at evil (get a jump on the war).Whatever your reasoning, a thinking plot like this is rare and i welcome the hours i've thought about these issues and am actively watching similiar genre, being turned on by the ideas.",4,"fun, active packed and thought provoking",1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,2390,"['interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'love', 'action', 'karate', 'shoot-blow-em-up', 'movies', 'just', 'right.What', 'i', 'find', 'worthwhile', 'thinking', 'about', 'line', 'reasoning', 'results', 'building', 'machine.1-', 'can', 'see', 'future2-', 'future', 'not', 'open', 'determined3-', 'therefore', 'have', 'hope4-', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'move', 'little', 'faster', 'dytopic', 'movie', '-Krull', 'where', 'cyclops', 'was', 'tricked', 'sacrificing', 'one', 'eyes', 'see', 'future', 'race', 'saw', 'was', 'time', 'own', 'death', 'same', 'nihilism', 'resignation', 'was', 'result.As', 'orthodox', 'Reformed', 'Christian', 'i', 'often', 'strong', 'deterministic', 'side', 'equation', 'God', 'know', 'foreordain', 'passes', 'trick', ""n't"", 'telling', 'very', 'end-', 'always', 'been', 'hopeful', 'argument', 'God', 'control', 'God', 'Love', 'therefore', 'everything', 'right', 'world', 'immediate', 'appearances.This', 'movies', 'take', 'open', 'future', 'hope', 'thinking', 'various', 'ways', 'people', 'have', 'answered', 'questions', 'example', 'main', 'character', 'sees', 'future', 'hopeful', 'overcome', 'change', 'what', 'problems', 'example', 'item', 'envelope', 'new', 'future', 'envelope', 'etc', 'Just', 'look', 'reaction', 'prompted', 'love', 'found', 'working', 'time', 'vision', 'machine', 'reaction', 'hope', 'action', 'saw', 'future-', 'two', 'things', 'destruction', 'world', 'own', 'death', 'was', 'element', 'resignation', 'towards', 'getting', 'catwalk', 'dying', 'movie', 'mostly', 'order', 'heighten', 'surprise', 'watch', 'going', 'off', 'nothing', 'hope', 'energy', 'save', 'world', 'destroying', 'world', 'Why', 'would', 'be', 'hopeful', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'still', 'weak', 'determinism', 'multiple', 'times', 'change', 'future', 'probablistic', 'not', 'determined', 'hope', 'stills', 'cracks', 'minor', 'probability', 'will', 'alter', 'events', 'Why', 'would', 'world', 'react', 'differently', 'herd', 'effect', 'stupidity', 'movie', 'hint', 'evil', 'get', 'jump', 'war', 'reasoning', 'thinking', 'plot', 'rare', 'i', 'welcome', 'hours', 'i', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'issues', 'am', 'actively', 'watching', 'similiar', 'genre', 'being', 'turned', 'ideas']",N/A

Dick story, ""Paycheck"" begins in the present day, a strange choice on the part of the filmmakers actually, for in this film's view of 2004, the technology for memory erasure seems to be in full swing and widely accepted (perhaps the producers didn't want to have to deal with the expense or bother of creating futuristic designs for their sets and costumes).  The majority of the story, however, takes place in 2007, after Jennings ""wakes up"" from a three-year stint working on a secret project about which he can remember nothing.  The trouble is that things haven't quite worked out the way Jennings planned as he finds himself the quarry of both the FBI and the organization for which he was working.  Of course, Jennings doesn't know why.  As is customary with films of this type, we uncover the clues and piece together the picture right along with the increasingly more enlightened main character.It's that piecing together that is the sole factor of interest in ""Paycheck,"" for Dick is clearly a writer with a fertile imagination and a gift for mind-bending storytelling. When the film sticks to unraveling its plot complications, it is generally sharp, intriguing and thought-provoking.  Too often, though, the film degenerates into a collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clich&eacute;s.  Although the special effects are occasionally impressive, the far-too-frequent chase sequences defy all logic and believability.  In fact, a number of scenes actually elicit a few unwanted giggles, so ludicrous and over-the-top are the setup and execution. Director Woo, past master of action spectaculars, is clearly working on autopilot in this film.There isn't much to say about the acting, either.  Although Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman - as the woman Jennings fell in love with during the three years, but whom he can no longer remember - do their best with the characters assigned to them, neither is given much chance to expand beyond the stereotypical confines of their respective roles.When it comes to all those involved in this film, I suspect that Jennings isn't the only one here working solely for the paycheck.",2,too many man-on-the-run cliches,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2899,"['**1/2', 'Though', 'futuristic', 'look', 'tone', 'John', 'Woo', 'Paycheck', 'really', 'throwback', 'oldie', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'amnesiac', 'only', 'find', 'being', 'pursued', 'authorities', 'crime', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'committed', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'built', 'premise', 'one', 'extent', 'difference', 'Michael', 'Jennings', 'amnesiac', 'choice', 'brilliant', 'engineer', 'scientist', 'job', 'develop', 'top-secret', 'inventions', 'hi', 'tech', 'corporations', 'delivered', 'goods', 'memory', 'be', 'erased', 'thereby', 'rendering', 'innocuous', 'security', 'threat', 'exchange', 'lucrative', 'paychecks', 'companies', 'offer', 'many', 'recent', 'adaptations', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'story', 'Paycheck', 'present', 'day', 'strange', 'choice', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'film', 'view', '2004', 'technology', 'memory', 'erasure', 'be', 'full', 'swing', 'widely', 'accepted', 'perhaps', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'deal', 'expense', 'bother', 'creating', 'futuristic', 'designs', 'sets', 'costumes', 'majority', 'story', 'however', 'place', '2007', 'Jennings', 'wakes', 'up', 'three-year', 'stint', 'working', 'secret', 'project', 'can', 'remember', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'worked', 'out', 'way', 'Jennings', 'planned', 'quarry', 'FBI', 'organization', 'was', 'working', 'course', 'Jennings', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'customary', 'films', 'type', 'uncover', 'clues', 'piece', 'together', 'picture', 'right', 'along', 'increasingly', 'more', 'enlightened', 'main', 'character.It', 'piecing', 'together', 'sole', 'factor', 'interest', 'Paycheck', 'Dick', 'clearly', 'writer', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'gift', 'mind-bending', 'storytelling', 'When', 'film', 'sticks', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'complications', 'generally', 'sharp', 'intriguing', 'thought-provoking', 'Too', 'often', 'though', 'film', 'collection', 'man-on-the-run', 'action', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'occasionally', 'impressive', 'far-too-frequent', 'chase', 'sequences', 'defy', 'logic', 'believability', 'fact', 'number', 'scenes', 'actually', 'elicit', 'few', 'unwanted', 'giggles', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'setup', 'execution', 'Director', 'Woo', 'past', 'master', 'action', 'spectaculars', 'clearly', 'working', 'autopilot', 'film.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'acting', 'either', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'woman', 'Jennings', 'fell', 'love', 'three', 'years', 'whom', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'remember', 'do', 'best', 'characters', 'assigned', 'given', 'much', 'chance', 'expand', 'stereotypical', 'confines', 'respective', 'roles.When', 'involved', 'film', 'suspect', 'Jennings', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'here', 'working', 'solely', 'paycheck']",N/A

The development process, for legal reasons (there is ""reverse engineering"" involved), is so secretive that Jennings typically consents to a ""memory-wipe"" after every job.  That way, he is assured of not sharing one company's secrets with another.And then the classic, ""final, big job"" is offered.  It involves a three year commitment, and a three year memory wipe.  To Jennings, it will seem like no time passed.  And with a big paycheck, time for retirement!Except... well, that is the point of this movie.  Things don't seem to be working out for Mr. Jennings, and when your memory has been wiped, you are REALLY confused when so many people are chasing you.I liked the action in the movie, although the various shooters were even worse shots that typical.  Don't the various security agents ever practice with their firearms?  And that ""secret product"" was a real stretch.

And the question remains: Even if you could see the future, do you really think you'd be able to change it for the better?Affleck doesn't really amaze anyone here, but he also doesn't detract from the story.

I would define it as &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; meets James Bond, and as happens in these productions, the creator of &quot;Paycheck&quot; goes overboard in a couple of scenes making them extremely unbelievable. Nevertheless, it is an entertaining film, which ended up being more fulfilling than I had expected, since the plot is considerably better than other action-packed films out there.Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is specialized in reverse engineering and his job consists in working non-stop for several weeks in each project he faces. Upon completion, he gets his money and his memory of that time interval is erased. The longest Michael has worked on a project is two months, but now his boss entices him to work on a three-year project. The bait is an eight-figure remuneration. Of course Michael has doubts, but the offer is too tempting for him to pass. By the time he finishes the project, he gets his one big paycheck in exchange for three years of his life: close to one hundred million dollars.Michael gets a huge surprise though, when he finds out from his attorney that he has forfeited the portfolio and that the only possessions to recover are a set of items in an envelope at the attorney's office. Michael sent these items to himself, and they all look worthless; the list includes a can of hair spray, a pair of glasses, a book of matches, a bullet, a lighter, a watch and several other little an seemingly unimportant personal effects. When the FBI comes after him, Michael realizes that there is something wrong and that the items he sent to himself are meant to help him solve the mystery and keep him alive.Even though I am not a big fan of Ben Affleck, I think he does a good job in this movie and that he fits his role very well. I am a fan of Uma Thurman though, who in the film plays the part of Dr. Porter, a lady that captivated Michael since he met her and who also works for Michael's boss. As usual, Thurman's performance is convincing and shows the passion she puts in her work. This is a good movie for spending a couple of hours entertained, but it is not one I would enjoy seeing repeatedly.",4,&quot;What you erase doesn't matter&quot;,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,2211,"['movie', 'clearly', 'characteristics', 'director', 'John', 'Woo', 'would', 'define', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'quot', 'meets', 'James', 'Bond', 'happens', 'productions', 'creator', 'quot', 'Paycheck', 'quot', 'overboard', 'couple', 'scenes', 'making', 'extremely', 'unbelievable', 'Nevertheless', 'entertaining', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'had', 'expected', 'plot', 'considerably', 'better', 'other', 'action-packed', 'films', 'out', 'there.Michael', 'Jennings', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'specialized', 'reverse', 'engineering', 'job', 'working', 'non-stop', 'several', 'weeks', 'project', 'completion', 'money', 'memory', 'time', 'interval', 'erased', 'longest', 'Michael', 'worked', 'project', 'two', 'months', 'now', 'boss', 'work', 'three-year', 'project', 'bait', 'eight-figure', 'remuneration', 'course', 'Michael', 'doubts', 'offer', 'too', 'tempting', 'pass', 'time', 'project', 'one', 'big', 'paycheck', 'exchange', 'three', 'years', 'life', 'close', 'one', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars.Michael', 'huge', 'surprise', 'when', 'out', 'attorney', 'forfeited', 'portfolio', 'only', 'possessions', 'recover', 'are', 'set', 'items', 'envelope', 'attorney', 'office', 'Michael', 'sent', 'items', 'look', 'worthless', 'list', 'can', 'hair', 'spray', 'pair', 'glasses', 'book', 'matches', 'bullet', 'lighter', 'watch', 'several', 'other', 'little', 'seemingly', 'unimportant', 'personal', 'effects', 'When', 'FBI', 'Michael', 'something', 'wrong', 'items', 'sent', 'are', 'meant', 'help', 'solve', 'mystery', 'keep', 'alive.Even', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'think', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'am', 'fan', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'film', 'part', 'Dr.', 'Porter', 'lady', 'captivated', 'Michael', 'met', 'who', 'also', 'Michael', 'boss', 'usual', 'Thurman', 'performance', 'convincing', 'passion', 'work', 'good', 'movie', 'spending', 'couple', 'hours', 'entertained', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'repeatedly']",N/A

To name a few Gigli, Daredevil, and of course this one. Don't get me wrong this movie isn't horrible it's just that it tries so hard at being clever that in the end it fells quite silly. the movie begins with a reverse engineer named Michael Jennings (played by Ben Affleck) who gets paid hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars by big industries to take new existing technology and make it better, after he is finished with his work he is required by contract to submit himself to memory erasure, the memory they erase is only the work that he has done for his clients.Afterwards we are introduced to James Rethrick (played by Aaron Eckhart) who proposes Michael a deal of a lifetime, he must give up three years of his life in order to create something that doesn't exist, as a matter of fact he doesn't even know if it can be done: but in the end if he is successful he will be paid a substantial amount of money. anyway so far the premise of the movie is good.... so what went wrong... well after that three year gap we find Michael receiving the payment  for his work... but as soon as he checks his account all the money has being dropped and instead been exchanged for nick knacks. Anyhow i don't want to ruin more it's an okay movie to watch once. The main problem with this movie is the tone, there are things that just don't fit and makes you scratch your head and go ""HUH""? For instance Uma Thurman plays a botanist that somehow knows how to fight in hand-to-hand combat (must have learned in Kill Bill) also there are some plot holes that are kind of hard to ignore, as well there are random action scenes that look better for a matrix movie.

Both Affleck and Thurmon were utterly out of place as actors. No wonder Affleck doesn't get any roles for anything any longer. Just horrible acting all around on everyone's part.The only real similarity is that he uses clues to solve a puzzle that he left in lieu of getting a paycheck. Yeah...for a brief moment, there's a Rita Dunn and some of the other main characters from the short, but that's where it ends.

Add the horrid adaptation along with even worse, stiff acting, and you have a train wreck that is actually easily something you'd rather not watch.

811826,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B0001NBNDY,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[6, 7]","It's funny how great ideas can come from the most unexpected places. John Woo is known for his high-energy action films and not for innovative science fiction. Paycheck delivers on the latter, but in a smaller dose. It's more an action/suspense movie anyway, but if you focus on what the movie is you will end up pleasantly surprised by what it turns into later on.The plot is an interesting twist on the whole man-on-the-run type theme we have seen in movies like Minority Report. And like Minority Report it delves into seeing into the future. Thankfully the similarities stop at the future seeing and hero chasing elements. While the theme is rather simple and even derivative the details around it make for an interesting show. Having our hero not know what he did for the past three years and only having a pocket full of items he left himself is a nice touch, even if the previews made it sound better than that. While the execution of the script is all well and good you don't get to the really good stuff until further into the film when Ben Afleck finds out why he is in trouble to begin with. Not only does this become a fascinating plot twist it makes the entire movie come together as an innovative story.This being a John Woo movie I am sure many of you are expecting lots and lots of action. Well it's not a full throttle John Woo movie in the action department. Don't get me wrong. There is a really exciting motorcycle chase scene and near the end you get a sweet fight sequence. There just isn't as much action in Paycheck as there are in Woo's other films. That's actually a good thing since you get more background into the story itself that wouldn't be there.There is one thing that sticks to my craw about this movie and that's Ben Afleck. Don't get me wrong. I think he did do this role well... technically. It's just I didn't feel drawn into the character at all. I wasn't convinced I was seeing Mike Jennings struggling through his predicament, just Ben Afleck. Uma and the rest did a fine job though. Sorry Ben. Technically speaking the movie is tight and you get some dynamic camera angles as well as some other neat cinematography tricks.

It's not personal, its just that I think he is a lousy actor who relies on his looks than any other substance that, unfortunately, he does not have.Paycheck did not change my mind on Affleck. It did, however, change my mind on Uma Thurman who I thought was a decent actress. What is she doing in this movie anyways? Isn't she supposed to be killing Bill? Uma overacts in Paycheck and it is very obvious from her crying scenes and the scene where she is begging Ben Affleck to change his mind and run away with her near the end of the film. Even Paul Giammatti, who is a funny actor, is not funny in this movie.The story, however, is a rip-off of almost every single movie that was made in the same genre as this (action/adventure/sci-fi). You sense the clear resemblance of Terminator 2 in the whole idea of looking into the future and this big war erupting! Armageddon, in which Affleck also starred, is ripped off at the end of the movie where Affleck will risk his life to destroy the machine and have Thurman run for her life. Minority Report is also ripped off for the obvious reasons (the whole look into the future) In a nutshell, the story's been told a million times before.In the midst of this viewing chaos, one must admit that Paycheck succeeds in gluing the eyes to the screen. It is mildly entertaining especially the very last scene which is quite funny and surprising (I will not give it away!)But the overacting, Ben Affleck, the repeated story and plot (and even images) makes this Paycheck not worth cashing.Not recommendedD",2,This Paycheck is not worth cashing,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,1570,"['do', 'not', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'not', 'personal', 'just', 'think', 'lousy', 'actor', 'who', 'looks', 'other', 'substance', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'have.Paycheck', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'mind', 'Affleck', 'did', 'however', 'change', 'mind', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'actress', 'What', 'doing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'killing', 'Bill', 'Uma', 'Paycheck', 'very', 'obvious', 'crying', 'scenes', 'scene', 'where', 'begging', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'change', 'mind', 'run', 'away', 'end', 'film', 'Even', 'Paul', 'Giammatti', 'who', 'funny', 'actor', 'not', 'funny', 'movie.The', 'story', 'however', 'rip-off', 'almost', 'single', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'genre', 'action/adventure/sci-fi', 'sense', 'clear', 'resemblance', 'Terminator', '2', 'whole', 'idea', 'looking', 'future', 'big', 'war', 'erupting', 'Armageddon', 'Affleck', 'also', 'starred', 'ripped', 'off', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'Affleck', 'will', 'risk', 'life', 'destroy', 'machine', 'have', 'Thurman', 'run', 'life', 'Minority', 'Report', 'also', 'ripped', 'off', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'whole', 'look', 'future', 'nutshell', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'million', 'times', 'before.In', 'midst', 'viewing', 'chaos', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'Paycheck', 'gluing', 'eyes', 'screen', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'quite', 'funny', 'surprising', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'overacting', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'repeated', 'story', 'plot', 'even', 'images', 'Paycheck', 'not', 'cashing.Not', 'recommendedD']",N/A

For example, ""I, Robot"" is a wonderful movie though it bears little resemblance to its source, just as ""Apocalypse Now"" remains the only decent rendering of Conrad's classic novella ""Heart of Darkness"".  Adaptation is about transposing a story from one register to another, and that obviously involves making creative choices.  The problem with ""Paycheck"" is that the choices made were all bad ones.  Subtlety and sophistication were Philip K. Dick's stock in trade, but they're clearly alien concepts to John Woo. I'm all for the occasional action film that lets you check your brain at the door - and he's made plenty of those - but ""Paycheck"" should never have been one of them. It looks great and sounds great, of course, as everything from Dreamworks does. Pity about the stupid plotting (why, exactly, do Michael and Rachel need to REACTIVATE the oracle when they've come back with the express purpose of destroying it?!), the dumbed down dialogue, relentless explosions and tired Hong Kong gun-play, and, worst of all, the offensive spectacle of Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman struggling under the dual impediment of zero chemistry and ludicrously bland characterization. It all plays like a Manga animation done with digitized humans, right down to the nauseatingly romantic, soft focus, floral epilogue. Spielberg showed us precisely how to do this kind of movie in ""Minority Report"": you can have all the high-octane fun you want, but give us a hero we care about and a plot that makes us want to keep watching.

811833,A4JHEO7H330AF,B0001NBNDY,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","PAYCHECK is a science fiction story regarding inventions, patents, induced memory loss, and a machine for predicting the future.  Ben Affleck plays a reverse engineer.  His job is to copy inventions, and then have his memory of the project erased.  Mr.Affleck eventually gets a job to reverse engineer a machine that predicts the future.  During the time frame of this project, three years, Mr.Affleck develops a love interest with a scientist (Ph.D. in biology) played by Uma Thurman.The story is one of continual intrigue, and it is not often certain who is being truthful to whom, and who is seeking to destroy whom.  But through all of this, Mr.Affleck and Ms.Thurman remain devoted and faithful to each other, though there is a period where Mr.Affleck's devotion to Ms.Thurman flags, somewhat, because his machine-induced memory loss has wiped out most of his memory of Ms.Thurman.Shortly before the end of his project with the future-predicting machine, Mr.Affleck manages to send himself an envelope containing a bunch of mundane items, namely, a bus ticket, hair spray, a ring, a paper clip, and cigarettes.  At this point in time, Mr.Affleck also willfully forfeited his entire salary for the 3-year project.  This particular part of the plot, namely, the envelope and foreiting the salary, constitutes the central (and very clever) part of the plot of this film.Please do not worry, I will not give away the ending.  But it should be noted that a similar plot can be found in Stephen King's story, I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.  And it should also be noted that a similar plot can be found in the TWILIGHT ZONE episode called, WHAT YOU NEED starring Ernest Truex.  WHAT YOU NEED concerns a street peddler, who provides simple items to people in a cafe, where these items prove essential to a hopeless man's quest for finding employment, or to another man's ability to prevent himself from being strangled to death, and eventually to the peddler's ability to save his own life.  These simple items include, a bus ticket, scissors, a leaky pen, and shoes.  It is therefore the case, that an essential part of PAYCHECK's plotline bears a striking resemblance to an episode of TWILIGHT ZONE.And now for the bad news.  PAYCHECK is a bombastic film that features a great deal of superfluous computer graphics, fist-fights, and automobile chases.  During this movie, one can almost read the director's mind.  One can almost hear the director thinking to himself, ""Hmmm, the American public is too stupid to appreciate a clever plot on its own merits, and so what we need to do, is to have computer graphics, sparks, explosions, gunfights, fist-fights, automobile chases, collapsing buildings, more explosions, and even more explosions.""

811835,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001NBNDY,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Paycheck"" is quite enjoyable if you can forget the fact that it is based on Philip K. Dick's novel, which previously inspired such films as ""Blade Runner"" ""Total Recall"" or ""Minority Report.""  As you see, his novels have many brilliant ideas, one of which ""Paycheck"" tries to use -- that is, ""wipe out your memory, and make money.""Ben Affleck is Jennings, whose shady job is to re-invent the products of rival company, and make it a better one.  After that process, he undergoes a 'wipe-out' process of his memory with a help from his only friend Paul Giamatti.  This is not a healthy job, he knows, with too much pressure on his brain, but it pays.Then the sinister-looking Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) comes to Jennings, offering the most lukelative job -- three years' work in his company.  Of course, this means that he has to erase three years memories of his life, but he can get a paycheck with huge numbers, so why not do it?But, after the three years, what he got turns out a manila envelope, in which he finds 19 seemingly meaningless objects.  Who did that, and more importantly, why?The original concept is good, but John Woo refuses to handle the matter in a way that would suit a Sci-fi genre.  His approach is more like a Hitchcock-like, cat-and-mouse chase action, which comprises many set-pieces of car chase, gun-shooting, and explosions.  And he does not forget to include a white dove and the men pointing guns to each other.What I do not understand is, though the film belongs to science fiction, it fails to convey the feeling of near-future world.  In fact, you see the year 2007, and there is little touch of futuristic world, for which Philip K Dick's name is invoked.  The technology looks scarcely progressed when the fire alarm is activated by cigarette's smoke.  In the futute (and Dick's future in particular), chances are people are not allowed to smoke.But these things can be forgivable if the actions are good.  Actually, they are not bad, just average.  However, we have seen superb ""Minority Report"" (especially its opening 15 minutes), in which the futuristic technology hightened the suspence of the impending murder in a terrific way.  We want that sense of thrill, which is not to be seen here.More problems: actors.  Ben Affleck is good in ""Daredevil,"" and usually a reliable actor who can suit the heroic figure, but his character looks very bland.  Aaron Eckhart is a typical villain, which is nothing I complain (just OK), but most disappointing is Uma Thurman, who plays the obligatory role of potential love interest to Ben's role, which is painful to see.

The one big problem I had was with the premis.

Then when that went sour the software companies staff of team killers (Just like Gates crew I bet) tried to kill him anywhere they found him regardless how many people to witness were around.  I couldn't help but wonder why they didn't just snuff him out when they sat him down for his injection to erase his memory of the past three years.  He had no idea what they actually were injecting into him.  A good dose of poison, and then they'd just have to make his body disappear for good.

This means he takes stuff apart and tries to figure out exactly how it works, and better yet, how to enhance it.His services are often used by a company owned by a friend of his. While he receives big checks, the company demands that, in order to keep their intellectual property safe, Michael's memory of the period during which he worked for them will be erased.Michael gets hired for his biggest job ever: A three year contract, worth 90 million dollars. A close friend tries to persuade him not to do it, but in vain.After the three years are up and Michael tries to cash in his paycheck, it turns out that he cancelled the check a few weeks in advance. As if that's not bad enough, his personal belongings that he had to stash away before he started the three-year period, have been switched with other stuff. This, again, was done by himself. Because his memory was erased though, Michael has absolutely no idea what's going on.To top it off, it turns out he's wanted by the Feds who want to question him about his work. This kicks off a series of events in which Michael will have to discover what he did for the company, why he would possibly sign a document waving the 90 million dollars away, and what went on during the missing three years.The story itself seems hardly original, and the same can be said about the movie. While Uma Thurman's performance is convincing, I had a hard time imagining the two of them being friends, let alone lovers. I especially had difficulty imagining Affleck as a hacker, or anyone in possession of half-a-brain for that matter.

In exchange for a big pay day, he allows the company employing him to delete his memory after each job preventing him from selling his ideas elsewhere. Selling pieces of his life and his past has become routine; if Jennings (Affleck)is like the rest of us and really just the sum of his experience, his memories, then he has made himself nothing. He's no better or worse off than a robot.He's tempted by one really big job. A billionaire (Aaron Eckart) offers him $92 million dollars for three years work and life that he'll never remember. Three years later, Jennings goes to cash in and discovers he traded in his paycheck for an envelope of trinkets. Suddenly, he's on the run and people are trying to kill him for what he can't remember. Jenning is forced to try and recreate his past using the contents of the envelope as clues. With the aid of Rachel (Uma Thurman)a woman he doesn't recall having an affair with, Jennings tries to discover what he did and it's important enough for murder.John Woo's latest cinematic action piece has all the right elements for a Summer release; it's action packed and has just enough depth to the story to make it a worthwhile investment for audiences. Nicely shot with some great set pieces, Paycheck adheres to the core of Philip K. Dick's original short story pretty well. The screenplay embellishes it in such a way that it's perfect for an action science fiction film (much how Minority Report and Total Recall were altered to fit the mood of their respective directors). The screenplay, despite some plot holes, is pretty good at holding your attention.Affleck and Thurman both turn in nicely detailed performances. While I didn't completely believe their relationship, perhaps part of that is because for Affleck's character it never really happened. Eckert gives an exceptional performance and actually could probably have played the role better than Affleck.While Paycheck isn't flawless, it's got all the right elements for an entertaining, thought provoking popcorn movie.

Okay, so I'm a kung fu poser. That's all right, because Paycheck is more of a run-of-the-mill action movie than an artistic, ""balletic"" John Woo movie (remember when everyone used the word ""balletic"" to describe Mission Impossible II?). Woo throws in some of his trademarks (a dove, Mexican standoffs, lots of action), but this movie is more Hollywood than Hong Kong.Based on a story by Philip K. Dick (author of the stories that inspired Minority Report and Total Recall), Paycheck has an intriguing setup. Ben Affleck is a reverse engineer who does freelance jobs creating competitive technology for a company (ubiquitously named ""Allcom""). At the end of each stint with Allcom, he has his memory wiped clean. He signs on for an eight-figure paycheck on a tour that will take three years of his life and memory.At the point where his three year contract ends, his memory is erased, after which he finds out that his $90 million in stock dividends has been forfeited, and all he is left with is the contents of a manila envelope. Action ensues.The setup for this movie is top notch. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first 30 minutes of the film. Although entertaining, the rest of Paycheck lapses into more predictable Hollywood action fare.This movie is not completely mind numbing, though. Paycheck is reminiscent of old Hitchcock movies, mostly North By Northwest. Affleck is styled to resemble Cary Grant-the swarthy complexion, the dark, slick hairdo, the crisp white shirts and tailored suits. He manages to shed his J-Lo/Gigli baggage for this film and turns in one of his most convincing (and best acted) performances to date.A cold-blooded Colm Feore is the only notable supporting actor in the film, delivering a mean performance as a bad guy. Uma Thurman is ungainly and awkward in her role as Affleck's love interest. Paul Giamatta's role as Affleck's right hand man is inexplicable, as he drops in and out of the story at random, almost as an afterthought.Paycheck is not a Christmas movie. If Paycheck had been released mid-autumn, it would have done moderately well. The studio suits should have realized that the hype surrounding other big movies of the weekend would drown out the weaker pull of this movie.
