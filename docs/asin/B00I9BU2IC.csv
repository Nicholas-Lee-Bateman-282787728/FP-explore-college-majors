Would recommend to anyone.The pilot episode Probe is not included.The pilot was a TV movie titled Probe (1972), which was intended to be carried over to the series. However, when NBC bought it, a little-seen science series on public television claimed rights to the title. Consequently, not only did this series air as &#34;Search,&#34; but the pilot was so retitled for the network rerun and subsequent syndication.",5,Search: The Complete Series,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,483,"['high', 'tech', 'stuff', 'Far', 'ahead', 'time', 'Great', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Would', 'recommend', 'anyone.The', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Probe', 'not', 'included.The', 'pilot', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'titled', 'Probe', '1972', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'carried', 'series', 'However', 'when', 'NBC', 'bought', 'little-seen', 'science', 'series', 'public', 'television', 'claimed', 'rights', 'title', 'Consequently', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'series', 'air', '34', 'Search', '34', 'pilot', 'was', 'so', 'retitled', 'network', 'rerun', 'subsequent', 'syndication']",Search: The Complete Series

1693763,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00I9BU2IC,Don McGregor,"[1, 1]","Warner Archives has recently brought the entire series, minus the pilot movie, &#34;Probe&#34;, to DVD. As usual, Warners has done a superb job in visuals and audio for fans of the show. The series only lasted one season, and apparently was seldom, if ever, in syndication. On a preservation level, then, Warners has made the show available for its fans and kept their high reputation for treating the episodes with respect, as they have with their other dramatic TV series DVDs.I could ask, as I have many times on Warners' superbly done late '50s Westerns series, why the bumpers are intact on Search, but missing from those shows. That's strange because those series, such as Maverick, Cheyenne and Sugarfoot, made such a big deal out of the bumper breaks.I'm just hoping by the time Warners has music clearances to its private eye series of that time period, like 77 Sunset Strip and Bourbon Street Beat, that they will have heard me bitch about it so much, they will make sure the bumpers are included with the releases.The running times on the complete series release of Search indicate the episodes are uncut versions. The color reproduction is vibrant throughout. It is easy to see why NBC would want to try to keep the show alive past one season. They had three of the top male TV actors going into the '70s as the lead performers in the series. The only thing missing in Search is Leslie Stevens's inherent vision and voice.But that is not Warners's problem.You can explore that topic on my new Riding Shotgun column on Search at comicsbulletin.com.Hope you enjoy it.Don",4,Searching Search for Leslie Stevens,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1580,"['Warner', 'recently', 'brought', 'entire', 'series', 'pilot', 'movie', '34', 'Probe', '34', 'DVD', 'usual', 'Warners', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'visuals', 'audio', 'fans', 'show', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'apparently', 'was', 'seldom', 'ever', 'syndication', 'preservation', 'level', 'then', 'Warners', 'made', 'show', 'available', 'fans', 'kept', 'high', 'reputation', 'treating', 'episodes', 'respect', 'have', 'other', 'dramatic', 'TV', 'series', 'DVDs.I', 'could', 'ask', 'have', 'many', 'times', 'Warners', 'superbly', 'done', 'late', ""'50s"", 'Westerns', 'series', 'why', 'bumpers', 'are', 'intact', 'Search', 'missing', 'shows', 'strange', 'series', 'such', 'Maverick', 'Cheyenne', 'Sugarfoot', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'bumper', 'breaks.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'hoping', 'time', 'Warners', 'music', 'clearances', 'private', 'eye', 'series', 'time', 'period', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Bourbon', 'Street', 'Beat', 'will', 'have', 'heard', 'bitch', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'make', 'sure', 'bumpers', 'are', 'included', 'releases.The', 'running', 'times', 'complete', 'series', 'release', 'Search', 'indicate', 'episodes', 'are', 'uncut', 'versions', 'color', 'reproduction', 'vibrant', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'NBC', 'would', 'want', 'try', 'keep', 'show', 'alive', 'one', 'season', 'had', 'three', 'top', 'male', 'TV', 'actors', 'going', ""'70s"", 'lead', 'performers', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'Search', 'Leslie', 'Stevens', 'inherent', 'vision', 'voice.But', 'not', 'Warners', 'problem.You', 'can', 'explore', 'topic', 'new', 'Riding', 'Shotgun', 'column', 'Search', 'comicsbulletin.com.Hope', 'enjoy', 'it.Don']",Search: The Complete Series

This was my very favorite television program when I was in high school. I was a nerd back then, and was really into computers, electronics and James Bond gadgets. This series fit on so many levels.

I was surprised this collection did not include the pilot TV movie for the series, called &#34;Probe&#34;, but one cannot have everything.

1693765,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B00I9BU2IC,Gary P. Cohen,"[8, 8]","Search was a futuristic adventure series that ran from 1972-'73.  It was futuristic when it was shown, not so futuristic today.  The show concerned a detective/investigative agency where the operatives wear little cameras at all times and microphones inserted into their ears.  As a result of this a large group of technicians can see and hear everything their operatives do. They can also monitor their investigators physical health while out on their missions.  The agency is run by the always flustered Burgess Meredith and one of the technicians is the utterly beautiful Angel Tompkins.The pilot for this series was a made-for-tv movie entitled &#34;Probe&#34; and starred Hugh O' Brian as operative Hugh Lockwood.  The pilot also starred the stunning Elke Sommer and Sir John Gielgud.  The made for films did well enough for  the series to be picked up.  Like many Warner Brothers series of the '50s and '60s, it was determined that more than one operative was needed so Tony Franciosa and Doug McClure joined the series as fellow &#34;probes&#34; to O'Brian.The show was produced and created by Leslie Stevens who earlier gave us The Outer Limits and Stoney Burke.  Robert E. Justman from Star Trek was also involved.The show aired Wednesday nights at 10PM on NBC.  It did not do well against (the far inferior) Cannon on CBS was cancelled after only one season.  I watched it and enjoyed it immensely.  If you want a well-produced, highly inventive and enjoyable series, you could do a lot worse than picking this set up.",5,Excellent Show from the 1970s that Left TV Much Too Soon,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,1528,"['Search', 'was', 'futuristic', 'adventure', 'series', 'ran', ""1972-'73"", 'was', 'futuristic', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'not', 'so', 'futuristic', 'today', 'show', 'concerned', 'detective/investigative', 'agency', 'where', 'operatives', 'wear', 'little', 'cameras', 'times', 'microphones', 'inserted', 'ears', 'result', 'large', 'group', 'technicians', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'everything', 'operatives', 'do', 'can', 'also', 'monitor', 'investigators', 'physical', 'health', 'out', 'missions', 'agency', 'run', 'always', 'flustered', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'one', 'technicians', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'Angel', 'Tompkins.The', 'pilot', 'series', 'was', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'entitled', '34', 'Probe', '34', 'starred', 'Hugh', 'O', 'Brian', 'operative', 'Hugh', 'Lockwood', 'pilot', 'also', 'starred', 'stunning', 'Elke', 'Sommer', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'made', 'films', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'series', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'many', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'series', ""'50s"", ""'60s"", 'was', 'determined', 'more', 'one', 'operative', 'was', 'needed', 'so', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'joined', 'series', 'fellow', '34', 'probes', '34', ""O'Brian.The"", 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'created', 'Leslie', 'Stevens', 'who', 'earlier', 'gave', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Stoney', 'Burke', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Justman', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'also', 'involved.The', 'show', 'aired', 'Wednesday', 'nights', '10PM', 'NBC', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'far', 'inferior', 'Cannon', 'CBS', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'want', 'well-produced', 'highly', 'inventive', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'picking', 'set', 'up']",Search: The Complete Series
1693766,A1MUKMEZ33A1PX,B00I9BU2IC,"Handsome Jack ""Jack""","[0, 0]","It's hard for me to be objective where this series is concerned. When it debuted in 1971 it was a futuristic, spy espionage series in a TV decade that was over-run with a host of gritty cop shows that sprang the the films 'Serpico' & 'The French Connection', and probably best typified by Kojak. SEARCH retained a bit of the spy genre fun & fantasy of &#34;The Man From Uncle&#34; -- and there was nothing even remotely similar to it in 1971-72. Not on American TV anyway. My favorite PROBE. was Lockwood, who launched the series with the incredibly well produced & cast TV movie PROBE (1971). Hugh O'Brian as former astronaut Hugh Lockwood, was clever, worldly, and dare I say it, cocky. Well into middle-age, Hugh O'Brian was in many ways like Sean Connery in &#34;Diamonds Are Forever&#34;, also filmed in 1971. He'd played hours upon hours of action on 'Wyatt Earp' and was nearing the end of his action star run, much like Connery was ending his tenure as Bond. And interesting, diamonds played a huge part in PROBE. Doug McClure, and Tony Franciosa, were both also very enjoyable on the series. The three made great counterparts to one another. It's been mentioned that the three had obvious &#34;peter pan&#34; complexes. Refusing to grow up. That could be the reason that the show seemed to capture a large youth audience, which is serving it well now with people my age grabbing up copies & making it  the #1 seller week after week on 'The Warner Archive Collection'.",5,Three American Bonds,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1476,"['hard', 'be', 'objective', 'where', 'series', 'concerned', 'When', 'debuted', '1971', 'was', 'futuristic', 'spy', 'espionage', 'series', 'TV', 'decade', 'was', 'over-run', 'host', 'gritty', 'cop', 'shows', 'sprang', 'films', ""'Serpico"", ""'The"", 'French', 'Connection', 'probably', 'best', 'typified', 'Kojak', 'SEARCH', 'retained', 'bit', 'spy', 'genre', 'fun', 'fantasy', '34', 'Man', 'From', 'Uncle', '34', 'was', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'similar', '1971-72', 'Not', 'American', 'TV', 'anyway', 'My', 'favorite', 'PROBE', 'was', 'Lockwood', 'who', 'launched', 'series', 'incredibly', 'well', 'produced', 'cast', 'TV', 'movie', 'PROBE', '1971', 'Hugh', ""O'Brian"", 'former', 'Hugh', 'Lockwood', 'was', 'clever', 'worldly', 'dare', 'say', 'Well', 'middle-age', 'Hugh', ""O'Brian"", 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'Sean', 'Connery', '34', 'Diamonds', 'Are', 'Forever', '34', 'also', 'filmed', '1971', ""'d"", 'played', 'hours', 'hours', 'action', ""'Wyatt"", 'Earp', 'was', 'nearing', 'end', 'action', 'star', 'run', 'much', 'Connery', 'was', 'ending', 'tenure', 'Bond', 'interesting', 'played', 'huge', 'part', 'PROBE', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'three', 'made', 'great', 'counterparts', 'one', 'been', 'mentioned', 'three', 'had', 'obvious', '34', 'peter', 'pan', '34', 'complexes', 'Refusing', 'grow', 'up', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'show', 'seemed', 'capture', 'large', 'youth', 'audience', 'serving', 'well', 'now', 'people', 'age', 'grabbing', 'up', 'copies', 'making', '1', 'seller', 'week', 'week', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection']",Search: The Complete Series

It is NOT the way I remember it, a great premise full of cool gadgets, beaufiful lonely women and double-entendres.  The PILOT had all of those things, but the series gradually lost them all.  Everybody was an old friend of Nick or Grover.  I HATED the changes to the control room and the people.  Gloria Harding appeared in WAY fewer episodes than I remembered.  Cam seemed to lose interest in warning his agents that other vital signs were nearby.  Maybe this was caused by the agents' eagerness to disobey him.  The early-1970's &#34;I don't like guns&#34; mentality bothered me at the time, and still does (see also &#34;The Rockford Files&#34;).  The last two episodes on the last diskette are out of order, shot during the first season and then just slapped on to the end of the last diskette as though the editor had grown so weary of watching the show that he just couldn't be bothered to put them in the right places.Despite everything I've said (and the stuff I decided wasn't important enough to include here), I just can't bring myself to give this series a bad score.

It was a mistake not to include it.  But I am guessing the reason may be because the pilot is sold as a separate item called PROBE.I suppose there are two reasons to watch it.  You might be wanting to see all the episodes if you have missed some as a kid; this is why I bought it.
