Out of all the yoga DVDs in my library, this series is used most frequently along with DVDs by Shiva Rea and Bryan Kest.  It's basic enough for the beginner and excellent for those of us who would like to keep our foundation strong while experimenting with more advanced poses.  Whenever someone asks for a good DVD to start out with, I always recommend this one.",5,Wonderful!,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,462,"['agree', 'Rebecca', 'Spotlight', 'review.I', ""'m"", 'intermediate', 'practitioner', 'love', 'series', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'library', 'series', 'used', 'most', 'frequently', 'DVDs', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'basic', 'enough', 'beginner', 'excellent', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'keep', 'foundation', 'strong', 'experimenting', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'Whenever', 'someone', 'good', 'DVD', 'start', 'out', 'always', 'recommend', 'one']",YOGA JOURNAL SESSION 1

801575,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0001DMXCE,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[37, 39]","Yoga can help you fully relax and prepare for meditation or just feel more relaxed while reading or cooking. Your mind will be cleansed and while the world surges around you in all directions, there will be an inner calm you can carry with you all day.While this DVD may seem to be for absolute beginners, it seems to be more for students of yoga who want to ""begin"" their own home practice. Yes, you can follow the instructions if you are an absolute beginner because there are variations if you are just starting yoga. I'd consider myself to be intermediate and the workout on this DVD completely heated my body and was challenging at places.Natasha Rizopoulos has a beautiful teaching style that allows you to fully experience the body mind connection. She encourages you to experience yoga in order to balance your life. After watching her Yoga demonstration you may start to think of Yoga as an art form and not just an exercise routine. She turns yoga into ballet and her upper body strength is astounding.This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:A 35 minute Instruction Session - You explore the postures in depth20 minutes of uninterrupted flowing practiceYou can follow the Instruction Menu, Practice Menu, go straight to the Yoga Chalk Talk (a great way to explore the poses) or Medical Commentary. The Practice menu has four sections:Begin Practice (Different from Begin Instruction)Follow Jason - This is an excellent option if you want to use props like blocks.Practice with Medical Commentary - A discussion of the nervous systems of the body and why stress hormones can affect your immune system.Practice without MusicIf you are completely new to Yoga, you might want to start with the ""Begin Instruction"" for the first few days (so your wrists get used to the poses) and then move on to the Begin Practice or practice along with the Chalk Talk to master the poses.Natasha Rizopoulos teaches you about ujjayi breathing, then teaches you how to move skillfully into downward-facing dog, cobra, upward-facing dog, simple cross-legged pose, chair pose, plank, warrior I, warrior II and extended (right) angle pose.This is the first DVD in a series of three high-quality yoga packages. You will need blocks and a mat for the first practice session. The orange mats, rich wood furniture, lamps, sage walls, sun filtering through lavender shades and a beautiful wood floor make this a beautiful and inspiring space in which to develop your own home practice.I can highly recommend this DVD and the entire Yoga Journal's Yoga Step By Step series to beginners (if they follow the initial modifications) and intermediate students (if they want a flowing practice session to warm and energize their bodies). Advanced students may enjoy this as a refresher course. Even after years of yoga practice, it is exciting to find out there is so much more to learn. This is a must-have series foranyone who is interested in yoga.~The Rebecca Review",5,Inspired Instruction,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,2975,"['Yoga', 'can', 'help', 'fully', 'relax', 'prepare', 'meditation', 'just', 'feel', 'more', 'relaxed', 'reading', 'cooking', 'mind', 'will', 'be', 'cleansed', 'world', 'directions', 'will', 'be', 'inner', 'calm', 'can', 'carry', 'day.While', 'DVD', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'be', 'more', 'students', 'yoga', 'who', 'want', 'begin', 'own', 'home', 'practice', 'Yes', 'can', 'follow', 'instructions', 'are', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'are', 'variations', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'yoga', ""'d"", 'consider', 'be', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'DVD', 'completely', 'heated', 'body', 'was', 'challenging', 'places.Natasha', 'Rizopoulos', 'beautiful', 'teaching', 'style', 'fully', 'experience', 'body', 'mind', 'connection', 'experience', 'yoga', 'order', 'balance', 'life', 'watching', 'Yoga', 'demonstration', 'may', 'start', 'think', 'Yoga', 'art', 'form', 'not', 'just', 'exercise', 'routine', 'yoga', 'ballet', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'astounding.This', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'menu', 'options', 'are', 'really', 'two', 'main', 'parts', '35', 'minute', 'Instruction', 'Session', 'explore', 'postures', 'depth20', 'minutes', 'uninterrupted', 'flowing', 'practiceYou', 'can', 'follow', 'Instruction', 'Menu', 'Practice', 'Menu', 'go', 'straight', 'Yoga', 'Chalk', 'Talk', 'great', 'way', 'explore', 'poses', 'Medical', 'Commentary', 'Practice', 'menu', 'four', 'sections', 'Begin', 'Practice', 'Different', 'Begin', 'Instruction', 'Follow', 'Jason', 'excellent', 'option', 'want', 'use', 'props', 'blocks.Practice', 'Medical', 'Commentary', 'discussion', 'nervous', 'systems', 'body', 'why', 'stress', 'hormones', 'can', 'affect', 'immune', 'system.Practice', 'MusicIf', 'are', 'completely', 'new', 'Yoga', 'might', 'want', 'start', 'Begin', 'Instruction', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'so', 'wrists', 'get', 'used', 'poses', 'then', 'move', 'Begin', 'Practice', 'practice', 'Chalk', 'Talk', 'master', 'poses.Natasha', 'Rizopoulos', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'then', 'how', 'move', 'skillfully', 'downward-facing', 'dog', 'cobra', 'upward-facing', 'dog', 'simple', 'cross-legged', 'pose', 'chair', 'pose', 'plank', 'warrior', 'warrior', 'II', 'extended', 'right', 'pose.This', 'first', 'DVD', 'series', 'three', 'high-quality', 'yoga', 'packages', 'will', 'need', 'blocks', 'mat', 'first', 'practice', 'session', 'orange', 'mats', 'rich', 'wood', 'furniture', 'lamps', 'sage', 'walls', 'sun', 'filtering', 'lavender', 'shades', 'beautiful', 'wood', 'floor', 'make', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'space', 'develop', 'own', 'home', 'practice.I', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'entire', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Yoga', 'Step', 'Step', 'series', 'beginners', 'follow', 'initial', 'modifications', 'intermediate', 'students', 'want', 'flowing', 'practice', 'session', 'warm', 'energize', 'bodies', 'Advanced', 'students', 'may', 'enjoy', 'refresher', 'course', 'Even', 'years', 'yoga', 'practice', 'exciting', 'find', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'learn', 'must-have', 'series', 'foranyone', 'who', 'interested', 'yoga.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",YOGA JOURNAL SESSION 1

I wanted to take my practice further and felt I needed alittle more detail than what the yoga class instructor could offer in a large class.

I found it difficult to follow, especially where many of the positions were at an angle that I could not see the TV screen.  And personally, I didn't care for the very serious tone of the DVD.  The Yoga language was all a bit much for me.  And I felt that the same combination was done over and over again.  This DVD would be better suited for someone with at least some yoga background and someone who is very serious about getting into the practice of yoga.  I guess I was looking more for something that just focused on stretching and lengthening with a bit of Yoga mixed in.

Having just begun doing yoga about 6 weeks ago, I wanted to have a video that I could use in between my classes.  Being cautious about just buying any DVD, I decided to try this one.  And I'm glad that I did.  Natasha was wonderful.  I did the instruction segment first then moved into the practice segment.  The practice segment is perfect for an early morning routine.  I found her to be easy to understand and follow and she was not boring nor slow.

801579,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B0001DMXCE,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[0, 0]","Rebecca Johnson wrote a great review. The instruction & detail is great in here, the extras have a quick ""chalk outline"" that shows the most popular wrong things people do such as letting their head fall into their shoulder in triangle pose that I found concise & succinct & informative.Natasha has great strength, flexibility & does move like a ballerina almost during her demonstration, but still looked stiff with little body awareness of energy.I did find the video to be too stiff for me, the instruction didn't flow and felt very long & boring. Many other people will enjoy this, but I felt it was disjointed.. some it flowed fast with stiff instruction, other parts were more like a lecture so you'd move fast, stop & watch, move fast.... The extra by having the doctor talk about the medical benefits of yoga really killed me in monotony. I learned better benefits from Wai Lana & others stated below.I did learn a few things when she was using Autumn as a model, but during the movement practice part, I didn't learn anything I didn't already learn through Gaiam's Rodney Yee, Susan Deason, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn (great detailed instruction, better analogies, more flow, etc.)I find it surprising someone had issue with using the original Sanscrit names. The words are written, and the English names are used as well to make the connection. I am sadden when true artistry, body awareness & mind/body connection intentions are destroyed so that people who have no desire or believe in learning the beauty above can demand the watered down version which is barely a reflection of the true craft, can say they practice that system too to seem cool & the true immensely knowledgeable intentions of the craft are lost through the years.You can see a clip on youtube com if you look up ""Learn Yoga - Downward Facing Dog""",3,Great for A type personality beginner yoga practitioners,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,1827,"['Rebecca', 'Johnson', 'wrote', 'great', 'review', 'instruction', 'detail', 'great', 'here', 'extras', 'have', 'quick', 'chalk', 'outline', 'most', 'popular', 'wrong', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'such', 'letting', 'head', 'fall', 'shoulder', 'triangle', 'pose', 'found', 'concise', 'succinct', 'informative.Natasha', 'great', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'move', 'ballerina', 'almost', 'demonstration', 'still', 'looked', 'stiff', 'little', 'body', 'awareness', 'energy.I', 'did', 'find', 'video', 'be', 'too', 'stiff', 'instruction', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow', 'felt', 'very', 'long', 'boring', 'Many', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'felt', 'was', 'disjointed..', 'flowed', 'fast', 'stiff', 'instruction', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'more', 'lecture', ""'d"", 'move', 'fast', 'stop', 'watch', 'move', 'fast', 'extra', 'having', 'doctor', 'talk', 'medical', 'benefits', 'yoga', 'really', 'killed', 'monotony', 'learned', 'better', 'benefits', 'Wai', 'Lana', 'others', 'stated', 'below.I', 'did', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'when', 'was', 'using', 'Autumn', 'model', 'movement', 'practice', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'learn', 'Gaiam', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Susan', 'Deason', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'great', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'better', 'analogies', 'more', 'flow', 'etc', 'find', 'surprising', 'someone', 'had', 'issue', 'using', 'original', 'Sanscrit', 'names', 'words', 'are', 'written', 'English', 'names', 'are', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'connection', 'am', 'sadden', 'when', 'true', 'artistry', 'body', 'awareness', 'mind/body', 'connection', 'intentions', 'are', 'destroyed', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'desire', 'believe', 'learning', 'beauty', 'can', 'demand', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'barely', 'reflection', 'true', 'craft', 'can', 'say', 'practice', 'system', 'too', 'seem', 'cool', 'true', 'immensely', 'knowledgeable', 'intentions', 'craft', 'are', 'lost', 'years.You', 'can', 'see', 'clip', 'youtube', 'com', 'look', 'up', 'Learn', 'Yoga', 'Downward', 'Facing', 'Dog']",YOGA JOURNAL SESSION 1
