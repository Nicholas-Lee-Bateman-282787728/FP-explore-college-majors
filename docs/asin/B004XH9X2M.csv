1432199,ADY836HK6QSYR,B004XH9X2M,"ardnam ""ardnam""","[2, 2]","This film is told from the Palestinian point of view.  It does address both Palestinian and Israeli bias. Apparently some reviewers fear that only the gullible simpletons will watch Miral.  Many of the elements in the film have no border limitations; a father's deep love for his daughter and the lengths to which he will go to ensure her safety and optimal development are not novel concepts or ones that are exclusive to any one nation.  The film is thought-provoking, inspires discussion, and encourages further investigation.  Of course, that is just one approach in viewing Miral.  The viewer could also use it as a political battering ram or view it as a work of complete fiction; it all depends upon the viewer's perspective.Some reviewers complained of  the methods in filming Miral and that it caused motion-sickness.  Although I am usually sensitive to the bobbing of hand-held cameras and 360 filming, I did not have a problem with this film.I also recommend activating subtitles when watching this film.  There are a few conversations when subtitling will prove beneficial. We began watching without subtitles and went back and activated them.",4,Thought-provoking,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,1155,"['film', 'told', 'Palestinian', 'point', 'view', 'address', 'Palestinian', 'Israeli', 'bias', 'Apparently', 'reviewers', 'fear', 'only', 'gullible', 'simpletons', 'will', 'watch', 'Miral', 'Many', 'elements', 'film', 'have', 'border', 'limitations', 'father', 'deep', 'love', 'daughter', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'ensure', 'safety', 'optimal', 'development', 'are', 'not', 'novel', 'concepts', 'ones', 'are', 'exclusive', 'one', 'nation', 'film', 'thought-provoking', 'discussion', 'further', 'investigation', 'course', 'just', 'one', 'approach', 'viewing', 'Miral', 'viewer', 'could', 'also', 'use', 'political', 'battering', 'ram', 'view', 'work', 'complete', 'fiction', 'viewer', 'perspective.Some', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'methods', 'filming', 'Miral', 'caused', 'motion-sickness', 'am', 'usually', 'sensitive', 'bobbing', 'hand-held', 'cameras', '360', 'filming', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'film.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'activating', 'subtitles', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'conversations', 'when', 'subtitling', 'will', 'prove', 'beneficial', 'began', 'watching', 'subtitles', 'went', 'back', 'activated']",Miral
1432200,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B004XH9X2M,A. Simon,"[1, 2]","I first became aware of this movie in a strange manner. I saw a preview of the movie in early summer 2011 and was flabbergasted that a film was being produced and shown that portrayed the Palestinian viewpoint. I waited for the movie to arrive. When it didn't, I looked up the film I found out that it had been made the year prior but had not been circulated; in fact, it had been already turned into a DVD. So this was the filmmaker's way of bringing attention to the movie even though it had been censored in the U.S. (it appeared in only 10 theaters here). Smart. I obtained a copy of the movie after reading the book.The movie does show the Palestinian side from the point of view of a schoolgirl, which is good and long overdue for those of us sick to death of the Zionist propaganda with which we are bombarded with here in the United States, coupled with the impregnable censorship. We get a glimpse of the constant humiliation, the atrocities, the repression, etc. One of the benefits of the CD is a q&a; segment with the staff, wherein they reveal that each time that the film was shown in a European capital, the Israeli embassies in those cities were able to have scathing reviews of the film published by sympathizers in the local media, prior to the film even being shown; what is particularly ingenious is that not only were the criticisms political, but they attacked it from an artistic angle. Very ingenious.Now, as to the movie. Some movies which are based on books, should be faithful to the book; others have no relation whatsoever other than the title (Andre Norton's The Beastmaster being one; Hemingway's To Have and Have Not being another; ditto for Poe's The Black Cat). In this particular case, more editing should have taken place so that it would have made for a smoother flow; specifically, the story of Miral's mother should have been omitted. Another flaw in the movie is that the transition from certain scenes to other scenes should have been made clearer, particularly when there was a period of years. Specifically, when Miral is released from jail after having been tortured by the Israeli police and is sent to Haifa; also, the scene where the orphanage exists is followed, without explanation, to a scene where a girl is being sodomized; one gets the impression that the act is taking place at the orphanage; in reality it is in a private home and the perpetrator is the girl's stepfather.However, these are minor complaints. The fact that the movie was made and that they tried to show it in the States, but were blocked is highly commendable. The character of Hind, the schoolteacher who, against terrible odds, creates a refuge for orphans, where they can lead a normal, educated, life, is superbly portrayed by Hiam Abbass.",4,Palestine,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,2765,"['first', 'became', 'aware', 'movie', 'strange', 'manner', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'early', 'summer', '2011', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'produced', 'shown', 'portrayed', 'Palestinian', 'viewpoint', 'waited', 'movie', 'arrive', 'When', 'did', ""n't"", 'looked', 'up', 'film', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'year', 'prior', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'circulated', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'already', 'turned', 'DVD', 'So', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'way', 'bringing', 'attention', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'censored', 'U.S.', 'appeared', 'only', '10', 'theaters', 'here', 'Smart', 'obtained', 'copy', 'movie', 'reading', 'book.The', 'movie', 'show', 'Palestinian', 'side', 'point', 'view', 'schoolgirl', 'good', 'long', 'overdue', 'sick', 'death', 'Zionist', 'propaganda', 'are', 'bombarded', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'coupled', 'impregnable', 'censorship', 'get', 'glimpse', 'constant', 'humiliation', 'atrocities', 'repression', 'etc', 'One', 'benefits', 'CD', 'q', 'segment', 'staff', 'wherein', 'reveal', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'European', 'capital', 'Israeli', 'embassies', 'cities', 'were', 'able', 'have', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'film', 'published', 'sympathizers', 'local', 'media', 'prior', 'film', 'even', 'being', 'shown', 'what', 'particularly', 'ingenious', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'criticisms', 'political', 'attacked', 'artistic', 'angle', 'Very', 'ingenious.Now', 'movie', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'books', 'should', 'be', 'faithful', 'book', 'others', 'have', 'relation', 'whatsoever', 'other', 'title', 'Andre', 'Norton', 'Beastmaster', 'being', 'one', 'Hemingway', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', 'being', 'ditto', 'Poe', 'Black', 'Cat', 'particular', 'case', 'more', 'editing', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'smoother', 'flow', 'specifically', 'story', 'Miral', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'flaw', 'movie', 'transition', 'certain', 'scenes', 'other', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'clearer', 'particularly', 'when', 'was', 'period', 'years', 'Specifically', 'when', 'Miral', 'released', 'jail', 'having', 'been', 'tortured', 'Israeli', 'police', 'sent', 'Haifa', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'orphanage', 'followed', 'explanation', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'being', 'sodomized', 'one', 'impression', 'act', 'taking', 'place', 'orphanage', 'reality', 'private', 'home', 'perpetrator', 'girl', 'stepfather.However', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'tried', 'show', 'States', 'were', 'blocked', 'highly', 'commendable', 'character', 'Hind', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'terrible', 'odds', 'refuge', 'orphans', 'where', 'can', 'lead', 'normal', 'educated', 'life', 'superbly', 'portrayed', 'Hiam', 'Abbass']",Miral

Watch it and reach your own conclusions.The ""story"" presented here presents personal stories of people affected by the creation of Israel in former Palestine, a British colony. This movie is not meant to be history, though facts of history are presented, but based on how the situation has affected people in different parts of society of Palestinians and Israelis.Although the movie is from a Palestinian perspective, I didn't feel that it was anti-Israeli, but did show how the partisan situation has affected many negatively, but mostly the Palestinians.I would urge everyone to see this movie with an eye to what happens with both colonialism and war. That some manage to survive does not mean thousands more didn't suffer greatly.This movie has some flaws, and I'll mention some here so you will not think I could not see them. While much of the cinematography is excellent there are times that I had to turn away because the cinematographer must have used a hand-held camera zoomed in so the picture is blurry. Then he moves the camera from side to side or makes a sweep and it almost gave me motion sickness and distracted from the movie. I have no idea why this was allowed, but if this bothers you, just move on because it doesn't last. Sometimes the story line seems truncated. First Miral's mother is a belly dancer then she is married to a moderate, kind, Muslim leader, not an oppositionist. Did I miss something? I think some of the narrative transitions fell on the cutting room floor.Despite any flaws I really urge you to see the movie. It has very beautiful music, excellent acting and is thought aprovoking about the situation with the Palestinians and Israelis. Its partisanship is not strident so you don't feel that it is meant to be any type of manifesto. It does leave us wondering why the Oslo agreements of 1993 were never finally agreed upon, though there are understandable reasons.

1432202,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B004XH9X2M,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[4, 4]","Julian Schnabel is a genuine artist, a true risk-taker. He is a respected painter, a writer, and he even recorded an album. And, true to his genius, he is also a filmmaker, having directed unique, non-commercial, yet critical successes as ""Basquiat"" (1996), ""Before Night Falls"" (2000), and ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" (2007). His most recent film, the passionate and eye-opening ""Miral,"" follows this special pattern, this time taking a sincere look at the lives of Palestinian women.The film is based on a true story from a book by Rula Jebreal, and it begins at a party on Christmas day, 1947. It is there that we are introduced to Hind Husseini (the wonderful Hiam Abbass), who unbeknown to us, will be the most important character - the glue, if you will -- in the movie. This party, perhaps, will be the last happy one that its guests attended. Schnabel then proceeds to show archival footage of the establishment of a Jewish state in the land of Israel, which would later be referred to as the State of Israel. We are then taken to Jerusalem in 1948, and we find Hind walking on its streets, where she meets a group of homeless children that were displaced due to bombings. She feels sorry for them, takes them home, and eight months later she successfully creates a school for Palestinian children. The director moves forward to 1967, and, as a result of the Six Day War, this time Hind is now limited to the Palestinian sector of East Jerusalem.After Schnabel introduces us to Hind, we begin meeting other Palestinian women that are victims of racial, political or sexual abuse. One of them is Miral (Freida Pinto), who is raised by her loving father. He tries his best to protect Miral against her surroundings, by sending her to Hind's school. However, it is difficult to escape reality in Palestine, especially in 1987, during the first Intifada, where Miral sees firsthand the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis. Miral, as you can imagine, will have to make some serious choices in order to survive a harsh life under occupation.Although ""Miral"" is mostly about Miral's journey in life, it is also, as I indicated earlier, about the lives of Palestinian women under difficult circumstances, both internal and external from their homes. It is also about women, like Hind Husseini, who made a difference. But Schnabel also presents a subtle, smart portrait of a society subjugated by a powerful neighbor, and how they live day by day. A real gem that deserved a better audience. The Blu-ray includes deleted scenes, making-of documentary, filmmaker Q&A;, commentaries by Schnabel and producer Jon Kilik.

1432203,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B004XH9X2M,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[1, 1]","This film, directed by Julian Schnabel and written by Rula Jebreal, is surprising in its collaboration between artists from both ""sides"" of the Israeli-Palestinian issue; its power comes from its balanced, sometimes unflinching, look at the individuals caught up in it.  Beginning with a series of segments that lead to the creation of a school/orphanage for abandoned Palestinian children, the film finally settles on Miral, a Palestinian girl who occupies two worlds, one of ""orphan"" during the week at the school and beloved daughter on the weekends.  Miral, named after one of the thousands of red flowers that line the roads and therefore serving as a metaphor for all Palestinian children, finds her way beyond the school walls and into the heart of the oppression of her people.  Her journey is not simple or sentimental or certain, and that saves the film from being yet another brutal film about political oppression.  Instead, the viewer is taken through Miral's own discovery of pain, friendship, and hope, wherever that may take her.The actors and actresses all turn in fine performances, from Freida Pinto as the teenage Miral to Hiam Abbass as Hind, the founder of the school, to Willem Dafoe as Eddie to Yasmine Elmasri as Miral's mother to Makram Khoury as Miral's father.  Even Vanessa Redgrave makes a memorable cameo appearance in the opening scene.I don't think this film is as powerful as it could be since it does not delve deeply into any one issue.  When the bulldozers raze a Palestinian refugee camp, the viewer hasn't ""been"" there long enough to feel the full impact of the situation.  The film touches upon issues and situations, then moves swiftly away.  On one hand, this removes potential melodrama, but it also feels as though at times it skims over the importance and emotional trauma of the events.  I am thankful, however, the Schnabel's camera is modest -- that is, it does not focus on violence and human suffering, but rather sweeps over the transformation of a young girl into a woman who cares deeply about her heritage.This film is not gruesome or shocking in its images.  While certainly not a light film, it contains none of the brutality of films likeOsamaorTurtles Can Fly, also films about children growing up in war/occupied zones.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,Portrait of the Palestinian Struggle Through the Eyes of Those Who Lived It,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,2302,"['film', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'written', 'Rula', 'Jebreal', 'surprising', 'collaboration', 'artists', 'sides', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'issue', 'power', 'balanced', 'sometimes', 'unflinching', 'look', 'individuals', 'caught', 'up', 'Beginning', 'series', 'segments', 'lead', 'creation', 'school/orphanage', 'abandoned', 'Palestinian', 'children', 'film', 'finally', 'Miral', 'Palestinian', 'girl', 'who', 'two', 'worlds', 'one', 'orphan', 'week', 'school', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'weekends', 'Miral', 'named', 'one', 'thousands', 'red', 'flowers', 'line', 'roads', 'therefore', 'serving', 'metaphor', 'Palestinian', 'children', 'way', 'school', 'walls', 'heart', 'oppression', 'people', 'journey', 'not', 'simple', 'sentimental', 'certain', 'film', 'being', 'yet', 'brutal', 'film', 'political', 'oppression', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'taken', 'Miral', 'own', 'discovery', 'pain', 'friendship', 'hope', 'may', 'take', 'her.The', 'actors', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'teenage', 'Miral', 'Hiam', 'Abbass', 'Hind', 'founder', 'school', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Eddie', 'Yasmine', 'Elmasri', 'Miral', 'mother', 'Makram', 'Khoury', 'Miral', 'father', 'Even', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'opening', 'scene.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'as', 'powerful', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'delve', 'deeply', 'one', 'issue', 'When', 'bulldozers', 'raze', 'Palestinian', 'refugee', 'camp', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'been', 'there', 'long', 'enough', 'feel', 'full', 'impact', 'situation', 'film', 'touches', 'issues', 'situations', 'then', 'swiftly', 'away', 'one', 'hand', 'potential', 'melodrama', 'also', 'though', 'times', 'importance', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'events', 'am', 'thankful', 'however', 'Schnabel', 'camera', 'modest', 'not', 'focus', 'violence', 'human', 'suffering', 'rather', 'transformation', 'young', 'girl', 'woman', 'who', 'deeply', 'heritage.This', 'film', 'not', 'gruesome', 'shocking', 'images', 'certainly', 'not', 'light', 'film', 'none', 'brutality', 'films', 'likeOsamaorTurtles', 'Can', 'Fly', 'also', 'films', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'war/occupied', 'zones.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",Miral

1432205,AVWWFK3FZDEL2,B004XH9X2M,D. Mckinzie,"[0, 0]","On the cover of the DVD case, below the name, ""Miral"" are the words ""Is this the face of a terrorist?""  The answer to the question is like the movie; complicated.  This is definitely NOT the type of movie that I typically like.  I feel that everyday life is hard enough; I want movies to entertain me and make me feel better.  This isn't a feel-better movie.  Miral's life has been sad in many ways and she lives in a part of the world that hasn't known peace in centuries.  She sees things that need changing and, like young people all over the world, she thinks that no one else has ever tried to change them, or they've used the wrong things.  She thinks she knows the right way.  And she gets in over her head.  Still, she's likeable and you keep thinking that she will come out right in the end, even if she can't change her world.  The movie is difficult in other ways, too.  If you speak English, be sure and turn on the subtitles or you won't have a clue as to what is happening.  And even with the subtitles, you'll be confused a lot.  It's hard to figure out a lot of things because they are just not things you encounter in the Western World.  I had no idea what a girl her age is allowed to do or not do, so I was never sure when she was going somewhere or doing something that she shouldn't.  But it also gives a little picture of what life in that world is like and the movie is, over all, well made.  You need to know that it is not a family movie.  There's a rape scene (not too graphic, but you know what has happened) and a belly-dancing scene and both aren't really suitable for kids.  It's a depressing movie in some ways, too, as Miral tries to deal with her world and her life.  I doubt that this movie is destined to be one that the average person would watch again and again, but it's worth watching at least once (and you may need to watch it twice just to understand it) if you are interested in that part of the world and what is happening.

1432206,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004XH9X2M,DVD Verdict,"[6, 6]","Judge Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict-- First and foremost, Miral is not propaganda, no matter what some reviews of the film would have you believe. I can show you propaganda, dark and evil material that is shockingly persuasive, but this is not that. Miral is more akin to Gillo Pontecorvo's incredible Battle of Algiers than it is to, say, any 1970s East German animation one might come across. Ultimately, I understand a pro-Palestinian film made by a Jewish director from an autobiographical book by Rula Jebreal, his Palestinian partner, is bound to drive opinions to already-established hard and fast views on the situation. If viewers can set those politics aside, however, they will be rewarded a gorgeous film of outward emotion and humanity, one that should be regarded as equal or greater to the rest of the catalog of director Julian Schnabel (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly), one that people owe themselves to watch.Miral receives a lovely Blu-ray package from Anchor Bay. The 2.35:1 1080p image is impeccable, featuring perfect color balance and detail. The cinematography by Eric Gaultier (Into the Wild) is impeccable, and some shots are downright chill-inducing; the disc is a fantastic showcase for his talent. The landscapes and the interiors are brilliant in their clarity, detail, and color balance; this is a reference-quality image. The 5.1 DTS-HD audio isn't quite as strong, but it's well balanced and robust. Miral is presented in English, with the occasional snippets of Arabic and Hebrew, and all of it is nice and clear. Schnabel uses a heavy amount of popular music for the score, including two Tom Waits songs as end credit music; all of it very effective.We also get a good slate of extras. Schnabel conducts an excellent audio commentary with producer Jon Kilik, filled with production information, background, and a few heartbreaking stories of people who appeared in the film. For example, one of his Palestinian actors, a theater owner in Gaza, was assassinated by a religious extremist for what he considered a too liberal production of Cinderella. That it occurred literally two weeks before Schnabel recorded the commentary makes the emotional nature of the story even more powerful. A slate of deleted scenes are all very good, most of which could have been included in the final cut. A short making-of featurette gives us time with Rula Jebreal, who explains some of the differences between the book and the movie, including scenes she deemed too painful to write, but Schnabel demanded be used in the film. A filmmaker question-and-answer session gives us more of the same, and a featurette called ""Julian Schnabel Studio Tour"" is unnecessary. All in all, an outstanding release for an outstanding film.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",5,This is an honest and beautiful film,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2772,"['Judge', 'Daryl', 'Loomis', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'First', 'foremost', 'Miral', 'not', 'propaganda', 'matter', 'what', 'reviews', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'can', 'show', 'propaganda', 'dark', 'evil', 'material', 'shockingly', 'persuasive', 'not', 'Miral', 'more', 'akin', 'Gillo', 'Pontecorvo', 'incredible', 'Battle', 'Algiers', 'say', '1970s', 'East', 'German', 'animation', 'one', 'might', 'come', 'Ultimately', 'understand', 'pro-Palestinian', 'film', 'made', 'Jewish', 'director', 'autobiographical', 'book', 'Rula', 'Jebreal', 'Palestinian', 'partner', 'bound', 'drive', 'opinions', 'already-established', 'hard', 'fast', 'views', 'situation', 'viewers', 'can', 'set', 'politics', 'aside', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'outward', 'emotion', 'humanity', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'equal', 'greater', 'rest', 'catalog', 'director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'one', 'people', 'owe', 'watch.Miral', 'receives', 'lovely', 'Blu-ray', 'package', 'Anchor', 'Bay', '2.35:1', '1080p', 'image', 'impeccable', 'featuring', 'perfect', 'color', 'balance', 'detail', 'cinematography', 'Eric', 'Gaultier', 'Into', 'Wild', 'impeccable', 'shots', 'are', 'downright', 'chill-inducing', 'disc', 'fantastic', 'showcase', 'talent', 'landscapes', 'interiors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'clarity', 'detail', 'color', 'balance', 'reference-quality', 'image', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'audio', ""n't"", 'quite', 'strong', 'well', 'balanced', 'robust', 'Miral', 'presented', 'English', 'occasional', 'snippets', 'Arabic', 'Hebrew', 'nice', 'clear', 'Schnabel', 'heavy', 'amount', 'popular', 'music', 'score', 'including', 'two', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'songs', 'end', 'credit', 'music', 'very', 'effective.We', 'also', 'get', 'good', 'slate', 'extras', 'Schnabel', 'excellent', 'audio', 'commentary', 'producer', 'Jon', 'Kilik', 'filled', 'production', 'information', 'background', 'few', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'appeared', 'film', 'example', 'one', 'Palestinian', 'actors', 'theater', 'owner', 'Gaza', 'was', 'assassinated', 'religious', 'extremist', 'what', 'considered', 'too', 'liberal', 'production', 'Cinderella', 'occurred', 'literally', 'two', 'weeks', 'Schnabel', 'recorded', 'commentary', 'emotional', 'nature', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'slate', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'final', 'cut', 'short', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'time', 'Rula', 'Jebreal', 'who', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'including', 'scenes', 'deemed', 'too', 'painful', 'write', 'Schnabel', 'demanded', 'be', 'used', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'question-and-answer', 'session', 'more', 'same', 'featurette', 'called', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Studio', 'Tour', 'unnecessary', 'outstanding', 'release', 'outstanding', 'film.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Miral

However, I never really felt like the movie sucked me in. I usually love foreign language films, even ones that take place a world away, such as Turtles Can Fly and The Stoning of Soraya M. (But I suppose this isn't a true foreign film, since they spoke in English quite often). Julian Schanbel, the director of Miral, also directed The Diving Bell & the Butterfly, which was a phenomenal film. I expected to like ""Miral,"" just as much, but I simply did not.

He said, First, I'd like to grow up."" - MiralDirected by Julian Schnabel, ""Miral"" is a fascinating and often harrowing look at three Palestinian women during the Israeli-Arab conflict.  The film begins in 1947 and ends in 1994. The first part focuses on Hind Husseini (Hiam Abbass), a woman who winds up founding and running an orphanage for young war refugees. The second looks at Nadia (Yasmine Massri) a woman ravaged by life, whose daughter, Miral, is the subject of the film's remainder.  After Nadia's death, Miral, played by Yolanda El Karam as a child, and Frieda Pinto as a teen, is placed by her father in Hind al Husseini's orphanage (he still sees her on weekends) so that she can receive a good education and advantages her mother never had.  The young adult Miral becomes involved in a youth resistance movement, which will test, then transform her convictions.We`re told that ""Miral"" is the name of a prolific roadside flower, and like her namesake, Miral is both beautiful and resilient. Her story, based on a semi-autobiographical novel, is intriguing despite a slow start to the movie.

1432209,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B004XH9X2M,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[1, 1]","This film provides insights into the lives and viewpoints of the Palestinian people in Israel as told by the life of Miral a young Palstinian girl who grew up in the region. The film covers the years primarily from 1967 up to 1994. It is based on the autobiography of Rula Jebreal who was a consultant for the film. The film features explain she provided access to actual locations and regions where events occured and to Palestinian people which made the film authentic and accurate down to the most minute detail. Julian Schnabel has produced both a realistic and artistically made film. Early on he intersperses true-to-life film footage of when Israel became a nation in 1948, as well as well placed documentary film footage of a ship that brought Holocaust victims to Israel. This way, the viewer is given a taste of the birth of the modern nation of Israel within the context of the Palestinian people's loss, the contrast is quite startling. We learn the film had become very controversial for the producer, due to its apparent one-sided focus which is the Palestinian people's suffering and, at times rebellions, which occasionally took the form of terrorist actions but it does not mean the producer condoned such actions, he was simply 'telling it like it is.'. Having viewed the film, I fail to see what is so surprising or shocking in the film. Sadly, the contents of this film, to a great extent, have been ""old news"" for many years on television. I recall viewing film footage of ""The Six Day War"" while it happened or shortly after it was over. I also remember watching Ultraorthodox Jewish settlers moving into homes built for them in the West Bank, on former Palestinian lands. At the time when the displaced Palestinian people were interviewed, it was all very very sad. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, US news stations had still provided unbiased news coverage, rather than trying to influence viewers to a particular political side. Over the years, there has been enough controversy created by both the Palestinian and Israeli sides that one film or book can not possibly examine either one properly. What Julian Schnabel has done is create a powerful, sensitive and authentic film which tells one person's life story within a particular context of time and history. He did an outstanding job!What I enjoyed most about this film is that the story was real and took place within the authentic landscapes and authentic environment on which it was based. The viewer is first introduced to ""Nadia"" who is Miral's mother. We learn of her difficult life when she was a teenager, suffering abuse under those who were supposed to protect and raise her. She left this home and struck out on her own, becoming an exotic belly dancer to earn a living. Later, she ends up in jail with a six month sentence for having slapped a woman on a bus. In jail, her cellmate is ""Fatima"" who was a nurse during the ""Six Day War"". She became sympathetic to the soldiers who were injured and took an extreme political stance by placing a bomb in an Israeli theater, luckily it did not detonate. She was sentenced to a jail term of three lifetimes. The imam of the local mosque visited Nadia in jail and later he became her husband and the father of Miral. The producer sought to make this film as ""real"" as possible. Freida Pinto portrayed Miral to perfection. Her resemblance to Rula Jebreal is unbelievable. Other outstanding actresses in this film who played unforgettable roles are Vanessa Redgrave and Hiam Abbass. The latter played Hind Husseini who had opened an orphanage for 55 displaced Palestinian children that were found in the streets of Israel in 1948. She continued running an orphanage and school for Palestinian children until her death in Sept 1994. She helped these unfortunate children to grow up under difficult circumstances, provided them a stable environment and helped them build a future for themselves.Miral's life story unfolds when she is a little girl growing up and after the suicide of her mother when she is placed Monday through Friday into the school run by Hind Husseini. We see her development into a rebellious teenager. She becomes involved with a Palestinian boyfriend who has ties to the PLO and takes part in the Intifada. Her father is a peace loving man who wants nothing to do with terrorism or rebellion and wants what is best for Miral. He tries to separate them but Miral is influenced by her boyfriend as he explains his hopes for the future of Palestine related to the signing of the Osolo Peace Accords in 1993. The views of the Palestinians are made very clear by his expressed ideas and explanations to Miral as they toward the West Bank where new housing developments had been build for Ultraorthodox Jewish settlers who emigrated to Israel from different countries. There are numerous memorable scenes within this film two of which are: the eternal sound of chanting by the Imam during Miral's father's funeral and the death of Hind Husseini which is made even more memorable by the angle of the camera which captures the arrival of her coffin, and in a long shot shows the graveyard which will become her final resting place. In conclusion, this film should be viewed by  anyone interested in the conflicts and problems between the Palestinians and Israel. On one level or another, this world event will affect us all until it is resolved to the satisfaction of both sides.

Outside the walls, the strife between Israel and Palestine builds like a volcano; humanity throughout the region is polarized.Into this scenario, director Julian Schnabel brings the story of a young girl (Freida Pinto, from 'Slumdog Millionaire'), whose devoted father (the always enjoyable Alexander Siddig) enrolls her in the school (begun and run by Hind Husseini, a real - and incredibly forward-thinking and resourceful - woman of means) after the girl's mother dies. In a land increasingly war-torn, Miral grows into a young woman fiercely patriotic to the Palestinian cause, who nonetheless her father attempts to rein in and concentrate on peace. The girl is torn between her obvious love for her doting father - himself torn because of the necessity of keeping the girl in the safety of the school, rather than at home - and her growing affinity to a rebel faction. Her attraction to the rebels is as much to do with the young man of her choice as it is by patriotism, yet she feels the pain of her people and longs to do something that will count in the overall.

Going into this I knew nothing of the actual story or the book it was based on. For some reason I thought this was going to be way more violent or something and that was it. What I got was a really good more dramatic film that had some great performances. Plus the fact that it is true makes it even more interesting.""Miral"" is actually about a few different stories all from the book from Rula Jebreal but it mainly focuses on Miral once she comes into the picture. Every character in the film is interesting and it is kind of a shame we don't have more time with each. Particularly that of Hind Husseini who comes across a bunch of homeless kids and decides to open up an orphanage/school. There could be a whole film made on her alone.The story is mainly about Miral and how her world is changed one day after she sees how her people are treated at a refugee camp. Being only 15 she does not know what to do at first but she feels she must do something. It seems that she is a bit conflicted on what she actually will do as her father and Hind Husseini want her to continue at the school and make a difference one day for her people with her education. On the flip side her boyfriend and soon to be husband is all about a more physical approach. She has to decide and come to terms with what she will choose.Like other reviewers of this film have said this is a coming of age story as we go with her from choice to choice. Good or bad and whatever consequence may come from it we get to experience with her. This is a good look at the Palestinian/Israeli conflict from different sides. Rula Jebreal adapted this from her book based on her life and it was directed by Julian Schnabel. Still the best thing about this film is the performances, everyone is great in this. From leading lady Freida Pinto as Miral all the way to Willem Defoe, but I loved Hiam Abbass as Hind Husseini.This was a really good flick full of great performances and a really interesting story. It is crazy because I almost passed on this movie. In fact the only reason I picked it up was because I found out Willem Dafoe was in it. Good thing I decided to get it because it turned into something I enjoyed. This was a pretty good take on the conflict over there and an interesting take on this women's life.

The girls are found in Jerusalem crying and huddled on a street by Hind Husseini who, together with her mother, opens an orphanage for refugee girls; the population of this orphanage burgeons quickly.  Hind primary goal is to educate all of the girls to prepare them for an intelligent and caring life.  One of those girls is Miral (we are told that this is the name of a red flowers that blooms prolifically all over the hillsides). Following the suicide of her mother, Miral, age 7, begins living in the orphanage during the week, spending weekends with her kind and loving father.  When Miral is 17, Hind sends her older students to educate Palestinian children in refugee settlements.  Miral falls in love with a Palestinian terrorist and unknowingly accompanies him on a bombing mission where the car he was driving blows up power facilities. Captured and arrested when her picture surfaces after the death of her closest friend from the orphanage  when they were caught up in the Intifada resistance, she is briefly imprisoned in an Israeli prison where she refuses to reveal the name of her lover and other terrorists (in the film they are never referred to as terrorists).  Her cellmate is serving three-consecutive life sentences for terroristic activities. Miral is an Israeli citizen and freed after 24-hours in accordance to a judge's ruling.  Miral spends time in Haifa and is distressed when she learns that her cousin is in love with an Israeli woman.  Miral's conflict throughout her adolescence is whether she should continue on her path of violence to assert her Palestinian identity or follow the teachings of Hind.  In an accord reached in Oslo in 1993, a separate Palestinian state was to have been created.  Hind dies consoled by this information. Alas, there is no happy conclusion to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; the film is based upon a novel by Rula Jebreal.  It is an interesting but not great film. Some of the footage is dizzying.  I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something is missing and muddled in this film.

The story unfolds through the eyes of a Palestinian girl and her real life account of a world divided by politics/religion, etc...

1432215,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004XH9X2M,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","It is refreshing to visit the Israeli/Palestinian conflict form a vantage too seldom shared in cinema. Director Julian Schnabel once again proves that he understands human responses in the face of political conflict. Rula Jebreal has adapted her own novel which in turn is a biography of her involvement in the history of the Palestinian conflict. It is a touching recounting of the events that took place form 1947 to the present and it leaves the window open for much conversation.The film opens with a party held by Bertha Spafford (Vanessa Redgrave) in 1947 when she asks her guest to forget the conflict outside for a celebration of Christmas: the party is attended by both her Jewish and Arabic friends, the centerpiece being the Christmas tree brought yearly by the Husseini family and then replanted to restore the earth. Hind Husseini (Hiam Abbass) is there and meets Eddie (Willem Dafoe), an American friend of Bertha. A year latter in 1948 there is an Arab-Israeli War, the Deir Yassin Massacre, and the establishment of the state of Israel. The wealthy Hind Husseini encounters 55 starving children, victims of the war, and take s them home to establish what will become the Dar Al-Tifel Institute, a school for Arab orphans that within months grew to a population of 2000. The film then jumps forward and we meet Nadia (Yasmine Al Massri), an abused alcoholic who is imprisoned and there meets devout Muslim Jamal (Alexander Siddig) who later becomes her husband: Nadia, unable to change her life, drowns herself when their child is only 7 years old. It is now 1978 and Jamal brings his daughter Miral (Yolanda El Karam) to the keeping of Hind, reassuring her that he will see her on weekends. Time passes to 1988 and the older Miral (Freida Pinto) is victim to the intifada (uprising), is sent to a refugee camp where she falls in love with the PLO leader Hani (Omar Metwally) and commits to the Palestinian movement to secure a land of peace called Palestine that will be free of the Israeli governance and jurisdiction. Hind encourages Miral to follow her heart and convictions: it is the development of change represented by Hind, Nada, and Miral that personalizes this compelling epic. Though the conflict between Palestine and Israel continues to this day, this film allows us to appreciate the Palestinian response to the loss of their land and home by a international ruling to create the state of Israel.Cinematographer Eric Gautier mixes the hot sun washed Palestine footage of the real intifada and the result is mesmerizing. The real star of this film is Hiam Abbass who as the gradually aging Hind Husseini brings the story to life. The large cast is excellent with special kudos to Alexander Siddig, Omar Metwally, and Freida Pinto: the presence of Vanessa Redgrave and Willem Dafoe add credibility tot he proceedings but their roles are minimal. Julian Schnabel is to be congratulated for bringing to light the 'other side' of the Arab/Israeli conflict. He gives us excellent food for thought. Grady Harp.

Teslovich,"[0, 0]","I wonder if the reason why most libraries have not ordered this docudrama is pressure from the AJC (either); JDL or Jewish donors to not purchase a story told mostly from the Palestinian viewpoint. As if there shouldn't be another view! To that I suggest the following pillow game: Take a side and argue for a position such as the Palestine State is a viable option; then take the opposite side to show that an Israel state is a viable option; then to the third side and show why both states are viable options; finally to argue that it's a poorly formed argument and neither is viable (just one state). The point is issues are more complex than a single side with opposite, right and wrong positions.Anyway, it was also good to see the intellectual Jewish population presented in the movie as promoting open discussions on this never ending conflict. It is interesting to see how conservative religious leaders of whatever persuasion are such an effective divisive force around the world.  I was a little disappointed that didn't show more of the economic, health, social and educational effects of the various forms of isolation imposed upon these people. Also, disappointed that the US government, mostly with the help of lobbyists, will deny a UN mandate for statehood despite overwhelming world wide support (the few other votes against, beside the US, were bought out again).",5,The Never Ending Conflict,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,1381,"['wonder', 'reason', 'why', 'most', 'libraries', 'have', 'not', 'ordered', 'docudrama', 'pressure', 'AJC', 'JDL', 'Jewish', 'donors', 'not', 'purchase', 'story', 'told', 'mostly', 'Palestinian', 'viewpoint', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'view', 'suggest', 'following', 'pillow', 'game', 'Take', 'side', 'argue', 'position', 'such', 'Palestine', 'State', 'viable', 'option', 'then', 'take', 'opposite', 'side', 'show', 'Israel', 'state', 'viable', 'option', 'then', 'third', 'side', 'show', 'why', 'states', 'are', 'viable', 'options', 'finally', 'argue', 'poorly', 'formed', 'argument', 'viable', 'just', 'one', 'state', 'point', 'issues', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'single', 'side', 'opposite', 'right', 'wrong', 'positions.Anyway', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'intellectual', 'Jewish', 'population', 'presented', 'movie', 'promoting', 'open', 'discussions', 'never', 'ending', 'conflict', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'conservative', 'religious', 'leaders', 'persuasion', 'are', 'effective', 'divisive', 'force', 'world', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'more', 'economic', 'health', 'social', 'educational', 'effects', 'various', 'forms', 'isolation', 'imposed', 'people', 'Also', 'disappointed', 'US', 'government', 'mostly', 'help', 'lobbyists', 'will', 'deny', 'UN', 'mandate', 'statehood', 'overwhelming', 'world', 'wide', 'support', 'few', 'other', 'votes', 'US', 'were', 'bought', 'out', 'again']",Miral
1432217,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004XH9X2M,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[2, 2]","A Palestinian orphan girl's story/perspective of education, love, country, and struggle while living amid conflict (psychological and historical), a longing for peace. It begins with Israel's freedom in 1947 when Hind (Hiam Abbass) starts a girl's school, Dar El Tifl, to save and educate young girls. The drama is based on ""Miral"" (auto-bio novel by Rula Jebreal), screenplay by the same writer, who literally was Miral. Miral (Freida Pinto) is sent to Dar El Tifl, thus making the connection between two powerful female characters, in film and real life. Miral's mother could be considered a 3rd important figure. But this is not a women's-lib film. It's much deeper, even much more beyond the Arab-Israel conflict itself. It's about humanity, not religious/political differences, and how common people must step up when caught up in conflict.The cinematography is excellent, beautiful and moving. Cast includes some stars, but a lot of relatively unknowns. Vanessa Redgrave, Willem Dafoe, and Alexander Siddig add the star status, but only Siddig as Miral's papa gets much screen time. The story is so good, so emotional, so compelling, that star attraction is unnecessary.  Anyone trying to turn this into something other than the struggles of people living in the midst of war/conflict is off base. It's all history, and a gutsy, powerful look at life as one generation passes off to another even while human conflict remains volatile. Is peace possible? It's not happened in real life yet. This form of human conflict living happened often in history: America's Civil War-N vs S; Irish Catholics vs British Protestants; The 60s Deep South's Black/White struggle, and other places in our world today.Recommended adult viewing. You will never forget Miral once you meet her.Rated PG-13 but I'd not recommend kids. There is violence, a rape scene, and a torture beating scene, not long, but long enough. It's just not kid friendly; it is real life amid conflict.Filmed in Jerusalem, Israel.DVD does have SUBTITLES, both Eng & Spanish.Bonus: Commentary from Director & Producer. Deleted Scenes.

Most of them bordering on anger at the behavior of its title character, Miral.  She was a child.  She had the emotional maturity of a child and she often acted without thinking.  I agree that this film brought to the forefront the suffering of the Palestinian people.  It did show both sides of a situation that is still not settled.  But whether or not Miral's actions were of any benefit to either side is highly suspect.  Now, there will be those who don't agree with me but all I saw was a petulant, spoiled child.  She made her father suffer and the headmistress of the school she attended, a school that was actually doing good by taking in children who were made refugees because of the conflict. Bravo to the director and everyone who worked on the film including all of the actors.  Initially, I requested this film because of Alexander Siddig whom I knew from his work on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.  I love his work, and he did a great job in Miral.

1432220,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B004XH9X2M,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","Miral (Freida Pinto of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") is a Palestinian student living at an orphanage in the Israeli occupied West Bank.  She feels anger and resentment as she helplessly watches the Israeli soldiers brutalize innocent Palestinian villagers.  She wants to protest, but the orphanage's wise headmistress Hind (Hiam Abbass of ""The Visitor"") instructs her to suffer in silence.  Miral joins a revolutionary group headed by Hani (Omar Metwally).  After she is arrested and beaten, she is forced to live with her aunt Tamam and cousin Samir.  When she meets her cousin`s Jewish fianc&eacute;e, Lisa, her desire for violence turns into one of healing as she wishes for peace among Palestinians and Israelis.First, I'd like to say that Julian Schnabel's ""Miral"" is not anti-Semitic, it is not pro-Palestinian, and it does not try to justify terrorism.  I think Freida Pinto summed it up quite well during the Q&A; session (see the special features) when she said that ""Miral"" is a story that could've taken place anywhere.  I agree; there are conflicts between races, nationalities and religions throughout this world.  Unfortunately, as depicted in this film, the innocent victims are usually the children.  A majority of the Palestinians and Israelis want peace; in fact, they, along with members of other nations, labored side-by-side to create ""Miral."" The politicians are the ones that need to get on the same page as their constituents.The acting is superb.  Much praise should be showered upon Freida Pinto for her wonderful portrayal of the feisty Miral who desperately cared for her fellow Palestinians.  Frieda strongly resembles the author/journalist, Rula Jebreal, on whose life this movie is based.  At publicity and award ceremonies, Frieda was often mistaken for Rula.  Yasmine Elmasri gave a stunning performance as Miral's emotionally disturbed mother Nadia.  However, the best performance came from Hiam Abbass who truly brought to life the loving, devoted Hind who possessed a kind, but firm hand when dealing with disobedient children.I can truly understand why members of the United Nations stood and applauded such a marvelous film; it depicts a universal message of peace, love and harmony among all humans.  Desert scenery; believable acting; a dramatic, historical plot; middle-eastern music and wonderful direction all combine to create a memorable viewing experience that will touch the hearts, minds and souls of many.  Speaking of direction, Julian Schnabel utilized unusual camera angles to create feelings of claustrophobia, isolation and suffocation.  Consequently, the viewer feels as though he/she is actually present during the action.Initially, I feared that the special features would bore me.  (They sometimes do for dramatic films.)  However, they were quite interesting and I believe them to be essential viewing.  For example, while re-watching the film and listening to the audio commentary, I learned the truth about Miral's birth.  I assumed when Nadia was vomiting in prison that she was having morning sickness, but she became impregnated soon after her marriage to Jamal; he is portrayed by Alexander Siddig, another superb actor.  There are the deleted scenes which provide more detail on Hind's burial and Miral becoming a journalist.  There is a tour of Julian Schnabel's studio where he paints some of the biggest portraits I've ever seen.  The ""making of"" featurette and the Q&A; session were both highly informative and entertaining.  There are English subtitles for those viewers who, like myself, are partially deaf.""Miral"" is highly recommended viewing for anyone who desires peace.  If I was a sociology teacher in high school or college, I would want my students to view it.  The film emphasizes the importance and necessity of everyone working together for peace and harmony despite differences.  At work, a friend of mine once told me that all Christian faiths should concentrate on what they have in common rather than what separates them.  This can apply to all groups of people no matter what boundaries (religious, political, geographical, social, etc.) separate them.  This film also depicts the importance of the family unit.  Jamal is a good father to Miral and I would be proud to have her as my daughter.  Love begins with the family and spreads outward to the entire world.  When the family is destroyed, love is also destroyed and the world no longer has a chance for peace.Joseph B.

1432221,A3BKNXX8QFIXIV,B004XH9X2M,"J. Finkel ""Jack of Trades""","[1, 1]","Miral is based on the true story of a girl who grows up in a damaged and conflicted world.  It is set in the Israeli controlled, disputed settlements and spans from the creation of Israel to the signing of the Oslo Accords.  While the events that occur in the film are interesting, they serve as a background for the unfolding drama of Miral's life thanks to the people around her.The film showcases several characters with distinct views and backgrounds.  Hind is the matronly headmistress of a large Palestinian orphanage who has the wisdom of her years and a pragmatic sensibility.  Jamal is Miral's father, who's an upright, religious Muslim and dedicated parent.  There is Lisa, a jewish Israeli, who's boyfriend is Palestinian and knows Miral.  The list goes on.  Each character brings something tangible to the film, adding their own voice to the collection of dissenting views.Given the sensitive subject matter - a war that still goes on to this day - it's difficult not to become preoccupied with which side this movie argues for and against.  Seeing as Miral is Palestinian and so are most of the people she knows, their perspectives paint the PLO in a better light than the Israeli Army.  However, as the film develops we see the conflict within the PLO and thanks to Lisa, a dissent within the Israeli community.  The argument evolves into a complex picture and we are at the end left to contemplate the overarching desire for peace within the vast majority of people and the inability to achieve such peace decade after decade, generation after generation.Overall, I really appreciated the way the film told the story of Miral, connecting so many purposeful supporting characters to her.  The actors altogether did an amazing job and the pace of the movie worked well to sustain a captivating flow.  There seemed a few missed opportunities to delve deeper into some of the characters, and certainly there were some major events that were majorly glossed over.  Yet, those faults seem to be in line with the style of the film in making great use of imagery and emotion while using dialogue subtly to tell the story without spelling everything out and without drawing into exposition.  It's refreshing to find a movie with graceful subtlety and skilled character study that doesn't rely on a heavy hand and shockingly horrific tall tales.",5,Subtle and Succinct,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,2350,"['Miral', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'damaged', 'conflicted', 'world', 'set', 'Israeli', 'controlled', 'disputed', 'settlements', 'spans', 'creation', 'Israel', 'signing', 'Oslo', 'Accords', 'events', 'occur', 'film', 'are', 'interesting', 'serve', 'background', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'Miral', 'life', 'thanks', 'people', 'her.The', 'film', 'showcases', 'several', 'characters', 'distinct', 'views', 'backgrounds', 'Hind', 'matronly', 'headmistress', 'large', 'Palestinian', 'orphanage', 'who', 'wisdom', 'years', 'pragmatic', 'sensibility', 'Jamal', 'Miral', 'father', 'who', 'upright', 'religious', 'Muslim', 'dedicated', 'parent', 'Lisa', 'jewish', 'Israeli', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'Palestinian', 'Miral', 'list', 'character', 'something', 'tangible', 'film', 'adding', 'own', 'voice', 'collection', 'dissenting', 'views.Given', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'war', 'still', 'day', 'difficult', 'not', 'become', 'preoccupied', 'side', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'Miral', 'Palestinian', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'people', 'perspectives', 'paint', 'PLO', 'better', 'light', 'Israeli', 'Army', 'However', 'film', 'see', 'conflict', 'PLO', 'thanks', 'Lisa', 'dissent', 'Israeli', 'community', 'argument', 'complex', 'picture', 'are', 'end', 'left', 'contemplate', 'overarching', 'desire', 'peace', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'inability', 'achieve', 'such', 'peace', 'decade', 'decade', 'generation', 'generation.Overall', 'really', 'appreciated', 'way', 'film', 'told', 'story', 'Miral', 'connecting', 'so', 'many', 'purposeful', 'supporting', 'characters', 'actors', 'altogether', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'pace', 'movie', 'worked', 'well', 'sustain', 'captivating', 'flow', 'seemed', 'few', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'delve', 'deeper', 'characters', 'certainly', 'were', 'major', 'events', 'were', 'majorly', 'glossed', 'over', 'faults', 'seem', 'be', 'line', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'great', 'use', 'imagery', 'emotion', 'using', 'dialogue', 'subtly', 'tell', 'story', 'spelling', 'everything', 'out', 'drawing', 'exposition', 'refreshing', 'find', 'movie', 'graceful', 'subtlety', 'skilled', 'character', 'study', ""n't"", 'rely', 'heavy', 'hand', 'shockingly', 'horrific', 'tall', 'tales']",Miral

Why this film? Why with the cachet of Deiss's office?Moreover, we noted, ""The Israeli Mission to the UN was not even given the minimal courtesy of being consulted in advance about the wisdom of showing such a film that deals, after all, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."" If the event went ahead, it would ""only serve to reinforce the already widespread view that Israel simply cannot expect fair treatment at the UN.""Now imagine for a moment that Deiss had opted to premiere a film that portrayed the Indian-Pakistani conflict over Kashmir, which has nearly brought the world to nuclear war, through the eyes of one side only. Or the division of Cyprus through the lens of only the Greek or Turkish perspective. Or the dispute over the Malvinas/Falklands Islands, which has led to an Argentine-British war, from one side, but not the other.All hell would break loose in the UN -- and that's no exaggeration.But along came Miral and all the rules were broken. Because it involved Israel, and not nations with far more clout in the UN system, the protest fell on deaf ears. The show went on and, once again, Israel got the short end of the stick on First Avenue.In the lead-up, the film's defenders rushed to the ramparts. In the end, they knew they'd win. They had Hollywood fame and celebrity on their side, and the UN in their corner. But, hey, a little controversy played right can only help box-office sales once the film hits the theaters, so why not milk the opportunity for all it's worth, even if it means playing fast and loose with the truth?First, they accused AJC of not having seen the film.Wrong!Our colleague, Lisa Palmieri-Billig, viewed it initially in September at the Venice Film Festival. She wrote a review for The Jerusalem Post. Her conclusion: ""Israel is portrayed as the unequivocal villain... Not only did [director Julian] Schnabel choose not to tell the whole story, but he also shirked a director's responsibility of providing the historical framework necessary for even his half of the story.""Then the film's distributor, Harvey Weinstein, proclaimed that he had invited AJC to the premiere.Wrong! No such invitation was ever received.Then Weinstein went on to invoke his teen-age daughters, Lili and Emma, who reportedly said: ""Give Mr. Harris a copy of the Constitution and point out the paragraph about free speech.""How touching!Perhaps he can explain to his daughters that this is not about the United States and First Amendment rights, but about the UN, where the Constitution doesn't quite apply. If it did, by the way, we'd have a whole lot less to worry about in the world today, beginning with the likes of Iran, Libya, Syria, North Korea, and Cuba.Don't be concerned, Lili and Emma, no one is trying to deny anyone's free-speech rights, least of all an organization so dedicated to the First Amendment that it defended the rights of American Nazis a few years back to march in this country, however utterly repulsive their views.This whole story was only -- I repeat, only -- about the appropriate role of the President of the UN General Assembly, not the neighborhood multiplex, though you wouldn't have known it from the plaintive cries of some.Then along came Jean-Viktor Nkolo, spokesman for President Deiss, who claimed, according to the Los Angeles Times, that ""hosting a premiere at the United Nations was not such an unusual occurrence, though he was unable to name another film that had premiered at the headquarters.""Not surprising that he couldn't name the UN debut of another film on a politically controversial topic, because no one else can, either.Then there's the film's producer, Jon Kilik, who said for the record, ""We made this film in order to encourage the very dialogue that AJC seems to want to prevent.""Hmm, that's quite an indictment, if only it were true.What kind of dialogue does Mr. Kilik have in mind if the Israelis are not part of the conversation? Did Mr. Kilik and his colleagues press President Deiss to discuss the film with the Israeli side in advance, if only out of common decency and the rules of diplomatic etiquette?As for what happens across the country when the film appears, be assured, Mr. Kilik, that AJC won't be involved in trying to ""prevent"" dialogue, however one-sided the film might be.After all, we're the organization that spends more time in the Arab world than any other, devotes more energy worldwide to Muslim-Jewish conversation, and opens our doors to those with whom we don't necessarily agree on every issue but need to hear from.And finally, Messrs. Schanbel, Weinstein and Kilik, if you're looking for new film ideas, here are two.How about doing a feature-length documentary on how the UN, founded in the wake of the Second World War and on the ashes of the Holocaust, has become structurally and systemically biased against the State of Israel, irrespective of what government sits in office in Jerusalem or what's happening on the ground?Evidence abounds wherever you look, beginning with the startling fact that since 1949 Israel has never had the chance to serve as a member of the Security Council, and that more than two-thirds of all resolutions adopted by the UN Human Rights Council deal with Israel alone. It would make for quite a story, one now unknown to many, especially in the hands of skillful filmmakers who profess concern for Israel.And if you want to get more personal about individual lives in the midst of conflict, as does Miral, here's another plot line yet to be touched by Hollywood -- the personal stories of Jews uprooted from Arab lands, sent packing if they were lucky enough to escape pogroms, and forcibly cut off from their ancestral lands.Pretty heart-wrenching stuff. I happen to know because I live with it every day through my wife and her family.But then again, the UN never promoted ""dialogue"" on this issue. The powerful Arab bloc, joined by their buddies, wouldn't think to allow it.Would Hollywood consider it?Given what we were recently told by a top executive, not a chance. In fact, he said, you couldn't have gotten a major studio to produce Exodus today. Too hot to handle, too risky to careers, and potentially too dangerous, for life and limb, to be associated with a film seen as sympathetic to Israel.Messrs. Schnabel, Weinstein and Kilik, please prove him wrong. You say you want to promote dialogue.

1432225,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B004XH9X2M,K. Groh,"[2, 2]","I am not the most knowledgeable on the Israeli-Arab conflict but I enjoyed this movie non-the-less. It starts out in 1948 and introduces the first character, Hind Husseini, who finds herself surrounded by orphaned village children. Hind opens a school for them and years later, is surrounded by hundreds of children. Eventually, the other characters are introduced, from jail cells, to the lead character Miral and her father. She begins in the movie as a young girl who is taken to Hind's school. This was one of the toughest scenes for me, where her father had to sneak out and leave her at this boarding school and Miral sobs her heart out calling for him. Ultimately, there are more compelling scenes but this one touched my mothering heart.The movie cuts to Miral as a teenager and continues on to show her need to be active in the politics and changes that should be happening in her country. There is great conflict between Miral and her father but ultimately, the bond is magnificently strong between them. Chaos is reining throughout the country and Miral seems to find herself in the middle of it at times.Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much. I had trouble following some of it but if I was better informed about the history of the conflict I don't think this would have been an issue. So my ignorance (which is a little less after watching Miral) should not interfere with my feelings about the movie which was well done and very well acted.I loved the personal nature of the characters and the way saw how this terrible war interfered in their lives and freedoms.",4,A Great Film of Love and Dire Conflict,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1578,"['am', 'not', 'most', 'knowledgeable', 'Israeli-Arab', 'conflict', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'non-the-less', 'out', '1948', 'first', 'character', 'Hind', 'Husseini', 'who', 'surrounded', 'orphaned', 'village', 'children', 'Hind', 'school', 'years', 'later', 'surrounded', 'hundreds', 'children', 'Eventually', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'jail', 'cells', 'lead', 'character', 'Miral', 'father', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'taken', 'Hind', 'school', 'was', 'one', 'toughest', 'scenes', 'where', 'father', 'had', 'sneak', 'out', 'leave', 'boarding', 'school', 'Miral', 'sobs', 'heart', 'out', 'calling', 'Ultimately', 'are', 'more', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'one', 'touched', 'mothering', 'heart.The', 'movie', 'cuts', 'Miral', 'teenager', 'show', 'need', 'be', 'active', 'politics', 'changes', 'should', 'be', 'happening', 'country', 'great', 'conflict', 'Miral', 'father', 'ultimately', 'bond', 'magnificently', 'strong', 'Chaos', 'reining', 'country', 'Miral', 'find', 'middle', 'times.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'was', 'better', 'informed', 'history', 'conflict', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'issue', 'ignorance', 'little', 'less', 'watching', 'Miral', 'should', 'not', 'interfere', 'feelings', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'acted.I', 'loved', 'personal', 'nature', 'characters', 'way', 'saw', 'how', 'terrible', 'war', 'interfered', 'lives', 'freedoms']",Miral
1432226,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004XH9X2M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 11]","After critical success with ""Basquiat,"" ""Before Night Falls,"" and ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly""--I was a little surprised that Julian Schnabel's latest feature ""Miral"" flew as under the radar as it did.  Based on the affecting memoir of journalist Rula Jebreal (who takes a screenplay credit as well), it tells the story of a Palestinian girl growing up amongst the eternal struggles between Palestine and Israel.  It is an unorthodox and interesting viewpoint to see events of international consequence filtered through such an intimate perspective.  Growing up under military occupation, having hatred and fear as a part of your every day existence--the potential for powerful self exploration and deep drama is inherent.  But, in many ways, the film wants to tell several stories by introducing three fascinating female characters before Miral (Slumdog Millionaire's Freida Pinto) is even in the picture.  That's fine, of course, but in the grand scheme of things--I'm not sure if those life stories (left largely unexplored) weren't inherently more interesting than the one settled on.  In particular, I wanted to spend as much time as possible with Hind Husseini (Hiam Abbass)--a truly remarkable woman who dedicated her life to caring for orphans in the war-torn area.The film's tag line ""Is this the face of a terrorist?"" also doesn't serve the movie well in setting up expectations.  This is a coming-of-age story where a young women must come to terms with the economic, social and political climate of the area and time in which she was born.  Sure, extremism and violent protest are a part of that world and Miral becomes entrenched in it--but this is hardly an examination of modern terrorism.  It is a character study of how one adapts to such an environment when it is an inherent part of life.  Miral's father leaves her with Husseini so that she may get the advantages and education that will help her avoid the pitfalls that doomed her mother.  And the strongest elements within Miral's personal journey are her bonds with both her father and her adoptive mother figure.  It is in personal moments shared between these characters that the film's quiet voice speaks much more powerfully.Schnabel incorporates plenty of stock archival footage into the film to put the historical story in context.  This is great and helpful, but you'll likely get more from the film if you have some knowledge of the political situation prior to viewing the movie.  We haven't traditionally seen too many English language films that have viewed the conflict from the Palestinian perspective, so that may be off-putting or controversial to some.  However, the story is more concerned with intimate human drama than in grand-standing.  Fans of Vanessa Redgrave and Willem Dafoe should take note that they are barely in the movie (she has one scene, he two), so if that's of primary interest--you've been alerted.  All in all, Miral is a good movie and surprisingly understated.  But seriously, Hind is the most intriguingly complex character in the film--and her story seems so much bigger than the main narrative!

I guess I was dreading the typical Arab stereotypes...or a too political message.  I didn't get either.Often Americans are prone to stereotypes about Palestinians, Arabs, and the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  We're also woefully uninformed on the history of the creation of Israel itself. Read about the creation on Wikipedia.  Look at the documents.  See how the division was meant to be--and look at it now. The only way there will ever be peace in Israel and Palestine is when we value the life of a Palestinian child as much as we do an Israeli one.  Sadly, we are very far from that point here.  It's not wrong that we're horrified if an innocent Israeli is killed.  But it is wrong that we're not equally horrified when an innocent Palestinian is killed.  Even in the recent Gaza war, when over a thousand innocent Palestinian men, women, and children died (vs. 9 Israelis--6 soldiers), we basically did nothing.  We were silent, even when it was US-made weapons and US funded troops that killed those people.  That needs to stop.Julian Schnabel's ""Miral"" is a good first step.  It shatters some stereotypes--and yes, they are stereotypes.  We meet the very real woman Hind Huseeini, a single Palestinian woman who rescued 55 orphans from the Deir Yassin massacre--and then founded a school/orphanage for them.  Her school eventually evolved into a very well respected girls school--still in existence.  No, she's not your stereotypical ""repressed"" Muslim/Arab woman.Without giving away too much, pretty much all of the characters go against stereotype which is nice.  Miral's Dad, Jamal, is an extremely loving father and husband--which is not unique in the Arab world either.I hope ""Miral"" is nominated for an Academy Award--not only was it a great film, but it deserves a wider audience.  No matter whose side (if any) you are on regarding Israel/Palestine, seeing both sides as human beings... .seeing every 17 year old arrested or killed as a real 17 year old, with hopes, dreams, friends...is vital if you truly want to work for a fair, peaceful solution for both sides.Bravo.  Highly recommended.  We need more Hind Huseeini's in the world.

1432230,A3A15L96IYUO6V,B004XH9X2M,Michael Smith,"[0, 0]","Based on a book, the autobiographical film, Miral, covers about 50 years in the Palestinian/ Israeli conflict.  Told from four different women's viewpoints, it is an artistic, stirring movie about a story that hasn't reached a happy ending yet.  Though not perfect in the story telling, especially in the beginning, it moves into a harrowing journey depicting mostly the Palestinian point of view of the conflict between two countries.  Though the ending is somewhat hopeful, it is mostly a depressing story.The four various Palestinian women have different ideas about how to live through this conflict and the beginning of the story that shifts between the four is somewhat confusing.  It's hard to grasp what their views are but all this becomes more clear by the middle of the story when their stories intersect.  Some are fighters, others are silent, and some go to prison for their views.The main character Miral is seen as a child with a strong ""father,""  a depressed mother, a compassionate tenacious teacher, and a militant boyfriend. All of these supporting characters set the stage for Miral's final reaction to the conflict.  The innocent child journeys through life, and as she matures, she ardently supports Palestinian freedoms with some surprises.The photography and stunningly artistically filmed scenes are strong, and the supporting characters do a fine job, as well. The country and war torn areas are a sad reminder of how things still are today. This movie makes you think about the social concerns that exist all over the world.

The Arab-Israeli War, namely the Deir Yassim Massacre left hundreds of orphans to live on the street.  Hind takes them home to care for and within a few months the original 55 has grown to nearly 2,000.We start following Miral (Freida Pinto) at the age of 7 following her mother's suicide when her father places her in the hands of Hind to protect her from the political turmoil continuing outside of the institutes walls.  Then, in 1988, at the age of 17, she is assigned to teach at a refugee camp where she is awakened to the reality of the Palestinian refugees. When she falls for Hani, a militant, she finds herself torn between the First Intifada of her people and Mama Hind's belief that education is the road to peace.The story is based on the book by Rula Jebreal where she pens a strongly autobiographical account of her West Bank coming of age.  She's torn between the injustice she sees at the hands of the Israeli army during the first Intifada and a desire for peace. Ray Hanania, an Arab-American Palestinian Christian journalist also known for his stand-up comedy states in his review of 3/22/2011 that: Instead of attacking the movie, I wish Israelis and Jews would watch it. I wish they would step back from their anger and try to understand our side.  He went on ""When the film was to be screened at the UN General Assembly, Israeli and American Jews went berserk. How could they dare show that film? It's anti-Semitic. It's anti-Israel. It's one sided. It's political. It's unfair. Anything they don't like is apparently anti-Israel.""Anti-Israel or not, I personally think that not only the Jews and Palestinians need to see this movie but everyone, of all mind and faith sets.  There are fanatics everywhere and we just need to find a way to coexist without sacrificing our sons and daughters to an outlandish cause.  I know there is passion out there, on both sides, but it is our beautiful children who are being denied a peaceful world to live in.This is an ambitious movie that spends too little time on the telling of any of the 4 major facets of its story lines.  Each actor is almost flawless in his part but uneven editing subtracts from the overall flow of the saga.  All in all, I'd recommend this movie without reservation.

Seeing his name as the second billed lead had me worried about the film.Thankfully, I was wrong about Miral. Freida Pinto carried what turned out to be a really compelling film about a conflict that is rarely dealt with in American cinema. I don't have any personal ties to the Israeli-Palestine conflict, but I found myself really moved by this story.My only real complaint with this film is that it was too short. At 106 minutes, Miral runs a bit short for its dramatic nature. I would've liked more time to see things develop.

I knew it would probably be sad, and interesting at the same time, while still being a drama type movie.  It definitely wasn't near what I had thought.The movie takes place throughout the 1950's on during a time when Palestine and Israel were fighting each other for their rights and country.  During this, it shows flashbacks of a school that was run by a woman who wanted to help refugees, and also of a mother who eventually would give birth to the main character of the film, Miral.  Miral is the main focus of the film and it shows her as sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians who are her people and some of the actions she takes as a rebel.  There are also clips in the movie of violence between the two groups.Characters:* Hiam Abbass as Hind al-Husseini* Freida Pinto as Miral* Yasmine Al Massri as Nadia* Ruba Blal as Fatima* Alexander Siddig as Jamal* Omar Metwally as Hani* Willem Dafoe as Eddie* Vanessa Redgrave as Bertha Spafford* Stella Schnabel as Lisa* Makram Khoury as Khatib* Doraid Liddawi as Sameer* Shredi Jabarin as AliI thought that everyone seemed to be well cast in this film.  They seemed like they were ordinary people going about their not so ordinary lives.  Hiam as Hind al-Husseini was especially inspiring because of her devotion to the refugee children that she tried to help.  Freida Pinto as the main character was cast fine, although she was frustrating at times because of her convictions.I thought the movie was interesting and I learned more about the conflict than I knew before.  I regret to say that it isn't something that I have looked too far into.  This film seems to empathize more with the Palestinians and I can't make any judgments on that at all as I don't know enough about either side to sympathize.  Not to mention that there are always two sides to every story and they could both be right and wrong.  I do know that I don't forgive any brutality on either side.The reason why I rate this film only three stars has more to do with the production than the content though.  The camera was very shaky and the way it was filmed often made me half nauseous because of the way it panned around.  It was also very disjointed in the story and while the clips of violence taken from news reels were informative, they disrupted the actual story that was being told.  Since this seems to be more of a political movie, music wasn't really a focus although the little there was seemed to be in tune with the region.An ok movie. Interesting content that could have been put together better.  It held an intriguing story that was just eclipsed by the actual trying to watch the shaky scenes.Review by M.

1432240,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B004XH9X2M,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","This independent movie provides a look on the nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Story starts in 1947 with creation of Israel, covers 1967's Six Day War and expands through 1987.  It is also a story about the woman (named Hind) who devotes her entire life to teaching her students on how to be compassionate, patient and persevering.  She is a sort of woman who believes in peaceful resolution of the conflict and that through education she can crete a generation of young people capable of finding a solution to a decades long conflict.In a middle of all of that there is a family story about a young woman, abused by her own father, who runs away from home, becomes a belly dancer in order to make her living.  As a woman with no education, she has no resources to secure decent livelihood to her own family.  It is this woman's descent from abusive childhood, painful adulthood and dissillusioned marriage that  Miral, her daughter learns about how painful life can be.  Through series of painful and life changing experiences, Miral comes to realize that it his Hind, her teacher who is the only person that can lead her to her personal salvation.  Hind's quiet patience, wise advise and limitless energy helps Miral get on a path that can redefine the rest of her life with a quiet sense of purpose.Willem Defoe and Vanessa Redgrave make brief appearances in this film.  Their roles seem to be only a little boost to the movie that had little marketing power.  This is a film about hope not only for a peaceful resolution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it is also a reflection on hope for humanity as a whole and young generations seeking to find their own identity.",3,Reflection on Palestinian conflict,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1692,"['independent', 'movie', 'look', 'nature', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'conflict', 'Story', 'starts', '1947', 'creation', 'Israel', '1967', 'Six', 'Day', 'War', '1987', 'also', 'story', 'woman', 'named', 'Hind', 'who', 'entire', 'life', 'teaching', 'students', 'how', 'be', 'compassionate', 'patient', 'persevering', 'sort', 'woman', 'who', 'peaceful', 'resolution', 'conflict', 'education', 'can', 'crete', 'generation', 'young', 'people', 'capable', 'finding', 'solution', 'decades', 'long', 'conflict.In', 'middle', 'family', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'abused', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'away', 'home', 'belly', 'dancer', 'order', 'make', 'living', 'woman', 'education', 'resources', 'secure', 'decent', 'livelihood', 'own', 'family', 'woman', 'descent', 'abusive', 'childhood', 'painful', 'adulthood', 'dissillusioned', 'marriage', 'Miral', 'daughter', 'how', 'painful', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'series', 'painful', 'life', 'changing', 'experiences', 'Miral', 'realize', 'Hind', 'teacher', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'lead', 'personal', 'salvation', 'Hind', 'quiet', 'patience', 'wise', 'advise', 'limitless', 'energy', 'Miral', 'get', 'path', 'can', 'redefine', 'rest', 'life', 'quiet', 'sense', 'purpose.Willem', 'Defoe', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'make', 'brief', 'appearances', 'film', 'roles', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'little', 'boost', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'marketing', 'power', 'film', 'hope', 'not', 'only', 'peaceful', 'resolution', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'conflict', 'also', 'reflection', 'hope', 'humanity', 'whole', 'young', 'generations', 'seeking', 'find', 'own', 'identity']",Miral
1432241,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B004XH9X2M,Robert Blake,"[3, 3]","""Miral"" is the first mainstream film distributed by a major US company (The Weinstein Company) to look at the Middle East conflict from the Palestinian point of view. Interestingly enough, Israeli filmmakers have tackled the occupation with even stronger, more graphic works (""Lebanon,"" ""Waltz With Bashir""), yet Julian Schnabel goes beyond them by trying to put us in the shoes of the Palestinian people. Hardcore Israeli nationalists or pro-Israel types will no doubt scoff at the story and images Schnabel presents, but films that dare to tell hard truths cannot please everyone, in the end that's what weakens the ending of ""Miral"" which does attempt to make everyone feel better about a conflict that one could say hasn't even reached its climax yet. Still, this is a strong, memorable film with lots of heart.The film is based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Rula Jebreal which recounts the efforts of Hindi Husseini (Hiam Abbass) to establish and run an orphenage and school for Palestinian youths, the seed is planted when she takes in numerous refugee children who's homes were destroyed during the founding of the Israeli state in 1948. In poetic fashion the film shifts in-between stories involving Husseini, a tortured woman named Nadia (Yasmine Elmarsi) who falls into the depths of alcoholism despite the love of her husband Jamal (Alexander Siddig). Their daughter Nadia ends up going to school in Husseini's institute and through her we experience the Intifada years of the 1980s, the struggle to live under occupation, the discovery of humanity despite the terror and ideas for unity which find it hard to sprout in an atmosphere of war.""Miral"" was mostly ignored when it was released in very limited fashion, few of the major critics bothered to review it, and yet this is a brave film to make in these times. Schnabel manages to create a film that isn't a soap box, it is a very human work that allows us to experience a current, geopolitical situation through the PEOPLE living it. The film does not look away from historical fact, it does not present stereotypes of Arab characters, like Salvador Carrasco's ""The Other Conquest"" it tells a story about a people who lived for centuries in an area which was suddenly chopped up, divided and parceled out. ""Miral"" doesn't turn the Palestinian people into shadows in the background, it has real characters, sharply written, not proclaiming fundamentalist, radical religious slogans, but demanding the basic right to a home free of colonial domination. In its exploration of violence and armed resistance as a product of colonial attitudes the film has moments comparable to ""The Battle Of Algiers.""As a work of cinema ""Miral"" is a visually powerful experience. The cinematography by Eric Gautier uses color to express emotions, moods, creating a hypnotic palette. There are moments of great impact where Schnabel uses his camera to poetic effect, in a scene where a characters commits suicide by walking deeper and deeper into an ocean the scene cuts to the point of view of the eyes, as wave after wave grows and encases us in a tomb of sea.One impressive revelation in ""Miral"" is Freida Pinto's performance. Here she graduates to a higher level than what we saw in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" which was more of a flashy soap opera compared to what she does here. Pinto projects real force and heart. Hiam Abbass is a strong oak of wisdom and experience.Of course what ""Miral"" will do more than inspire admiration for its craft is provoke political debates. But those expecting a purely militant, pro-Palestinian film will be surprised by the screenplay's humanity and disregard for racial/cultural barriers. One section deals with an Arab man's romantic relationship with an Israeli Jew. The scenes involving this story element don't even feel like some obvious attempt to be politically correct, the characters speak with basic common sense, like human beings living in a reality that imposes idiotic rules. Schnabel bravely shows the realities of the Israeli occupation with a fierce urgency and clarity, we see Israeli troops demolish a Palestinian home in a refugee camp based on flimsy excuses. The displacement which took place in 1948 is also shown with a surprising honesty, some will complain and offer nationalist, religious responses or attacks, but to them I can only recommend the basic scholarship such as the writings of Uri Avnery, Gideon Levy or David Hirst's excellent recent book ""Beware Of Small States.""The only weakness in ""Miral"" is it's ending which tries to find some sort of happy ending to a story which is still ongoing. The basic focus of the closure is the Oslo Accords, which collapsed and resulted in the 2000 Intifada, and today Oslo is such a weakened document that the current Netanyahu regime has even considered tossing it away (if Netanyahu can survive the current, mass social protests in Israel). The film does have enough of a convincing happy ending with where Miral's life goes, but the film seems to suggest that the Oslo Accords is the medicine to the problem when those familiar with the history know it's as good as buried. But still, ""Miral"" is a very good movie that dares to speak out from the corner of an oppressed, struggling people. Postmodernism be damned, there are groups and people fighting for dignity and freedom who deserve to have their voices expressed on the big screen. I suspect ""Miral's"" stature will grow with time and will be discovered on DVD by those seeking more meaningful films in the current sea of consumerist distraction. This is a special film that deserves to be seen, discussed, fought over and even more important: It may open the door for others.",5,A Memorable Film With Powerful Ideas And Images.,1313107200,"08 12,

It raises expectations of a different story than what we actually get.  That's not to say the question doesn't arise in an oblique way, but it isn't the focus of the film; Miral never comes close to being a terrorist.  Rather it's a story of a young woman's roots in the Palestinian tragedy, and how she is pulled in different directions by circumstances and the loves of her life.  The film ends when she is still young with most of her story still ahead of her.The style of the film shifts between semi-documentary and conventionally dramatic.  There are moments of beautiful lyricism next to clunkier expository contrivances.  (The music at the end, while it's easy to see how it fits, also clashes.)Politically, since it's about a Palestinian, it doesn't really show both sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but it isn't unfair to or hateful of any side.  Defects of Palestinians aren't ignored.  It illustrates why someone might become a terrorist, without going too deeply into the issue.There are some fine actors in the film, most importantly Freida Pinto (Latika in Slumdog Millionaire) in the title role.  The wonderful Hiam Abbass (seen recently in this country in the fine small filmThe Visitor) has a major role, and Willem Dafoe and Vanessa Redgrave pitch in with cameos.  All the major roles are compellingly played.Despite the larger issues involved, and called attention to, this is at heart a personal story.  On that level, it's partly successful.

Once you get over that small detail, Pinto puts on a strong and nuanced performance trying to find her way as a Palestinian in the Israeli world.There are two sides to every story and Miral is one of the first in the Western world that tells the story of the Israeli / Palestinian conflict from the point of view from a Palestinian who finds herself in the middle.

The character development is so poor, however, that the viewer never truly becomes invested in any of their lives or the overarching storyline.  The two women with the most intriguing backgrounds, Fatima and Nadia, are only shown for several minutes.  Miral, the main character, is not presented to the audience until about a third of the way through the film and she lacks substance from her introduction to lackluster departure.The director places tries to engage in creative filmography, which, unfortunately does not cover up the lack of a plot, a poorly written script filled with trite dialogue and mediocre acting.  The brief appearance of Williem Dafoe does not alleviate the picture's faults.This is a movie crying for direction and refinement.  There are many random tangents and unexplained details.  It is my understanding that the movie is based on a book. I'm sure if I read the book, which I never will, some of the random details would be explained.  The fact of the matter is that they never should have been included.  It is my guess that the director was blinded by his relationship with the women who wrote the book that Miral is based upon and failed to pursue aggressive editing of the movie.As this was surely someone's pride and joy, I really hate saying that this was one of the worst films I have had the unfortunate experience of watching, but that was the case.

THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSISThe topic of this film, coming of age as a Palestinian girl in Israel, will leave few viewers without strong points of view.  Each of us has a bias.  I will do my best to present the subject matter and the film's artistic value fairly.First of all, the actors were believable.  Each one embraced his/her roles and their performances gave dimension to their characters.  The use of Arabic, Hebrew, and English was appropriate depending on the scenes in which they were used.  Subtitles were supplied when English was not spoken.  (The viewer can use subtitles as an option on the DVD.)  The costuming and hairstyles were authentic to the periods covered (1947-1994).  The modes of transportation represented the times, as well.Photography was a different matter or, perhaps it was the editing.  The director made good use of fading colors in certain scenes.  It helped to convey setting and emotions.  There were times, however, while watching this video, I felt like an outsider, seeing moving snapshots, seemingly disconnected.  As the film progressed, colors were more consistent and so too, the reduction of choppiness in the editing.  Overall though, the editing was not as smooth as I would have liked as scenes transitioned.Scenery was definitely a strong point.  Whether it was in the Arab towns, the school, the Israeli checkpoints, the Arab 'suk' (market), or in various apartments, each looked quite natural and not staged.The character, Miral, is the protagonist.  We see through her eyes.  It is her point of view that speaks to us.  As a child, she lives in a school dormitory with other children who have experienced the loss of parents and homes.  Some of these losses are the result of Arab-Israeli conflicts.  From her perspective, the Israeli government is to blame.  It is allowing settlements in lands formerly occupied by Arabs.  Miral sees Israelis as her enemy.  In only one instance does she speak with an Israeli who seemingly doesn't care which side she is supposed to support.  And that confuses Miral.  I wish the film had explored further both the relationship and the feelings of these two characters.This film is poignant, focusing on relationships: of a father and daughter; a woman's love of children; and of political groups with diverging agendas.  It encompasses political passions and resonates with distrust and hatred.  Yet, the words on the screen at the finale, beseech us to seek peace.  Had the presentation of the subject been more even-handed, those words might have been meaningful.  As they stand, they are hollow.",4,Poignant and Political,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,2624,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'NEEDED', 'HERE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'NOT', 'A', 'SYNOPSISThe', 'topic', 'film', 'coming', 'age', 'Palestinian', 'girl', 'Israel', 'will', 'leave', 'few', 'viewers', 'strong', 'points', 'view', 'bias', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'present', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'artistic', 'value', 'fairly.First', 'actors', 'were', 'believable', 'one', 'embraced', 'his/her', 'roles', 'performances', 'gave', 'dimension', 'characters', 'use', 'Arabic', 'Hebrew', 'English', 'was', 'appropriate', 'depending', 'scenes', 'were', 'used', 'Subtitles', 'were', 'supplied', 'when', 'English', 'was', 'not', 'spoken', 'viewer', 'can', 'use', 'subtitles', 'option', 'DVD', 'costuming', 'hairstyles', 'were', 'authentic', 'periods', 'covered', '1947-1994', 'modes', 'transportation', 'represented', 'times', 'well.Photography', 'was', 'different', 'matter', 'perhaps', 'was', 'editing', 'director', 'made', 'good', 'use', 'fading', 'colors', 'certain', 'scenes', 'helped', 'convey', 'setting', 'emotions', 'were', 'times', 'however', 'watching', 'video', 'felt', 'outsider', 'seeing', 'moving', 'snapshots', 'seemingly', 'disconnected', 'film', 'progressed', 'colors', 'were', 'more', 'consistent', 'so', 'too', 'reduction', 'choppiness', 'editing', 'Overall', 'editing', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'smooth', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'scenes', 'transitioned.Scenery', 'was', 'definitely', 'strong', 'point', 'was', 'Arab', 'towns', 'school', 'Israeli', 'checkpoints', 'Arab', ""'suk"", 'market', 'various', 'apartments', 'looked', 'quite', 'natural', 'not', 'staged.The', 'character', 'Miral', 'protagonist', 'see', 'eyes', 'point', 'view', 'child', 'school', 'dormitory', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'loss', 'parents', 'homes', 'losses', 'are', 'result', 'Arab-Israeli', 'conflicts', 'perspective', 'Israeli', 'government', 'blame', 'allowing', 'settlements', 'lands', 'formerly', 'occupied', 'Arabs', 'Miral', 'Israelis', 'enemy', 'only', 'one', 'instance', 'speak', 'Israeli', 'who', 'seemingly', ""n't"", 'care', 'side', 'supposed', 'support', 'Miral', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'explored', 'further', 'relationship', 'feelings', 'two', 'characters.This', 'film', 'poignant', 'focusing', 'relationships', 'father', 'daughter', 'woman', 'love', 'children', 'political', 'groups', 'diverging', 'agendas', 'political', 'passions', 'resonates', 'distrust', 'hatred', 'words', 'screen', 'finale', 'beseech', 'seek', 'peace', 'Had', 'presentation', 'subject', 'been', 'more', 'even-handed', 'words', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'meaningful', 'stand', 'are', 'hollow']",Miral

1432250,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B004XH9X2M,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[1, 1]","Miral is a story of a little girl born in the 1970's Israeli- Palestinian conflict, which had been going on for over 2 decades. The film is based on Rula Jebreal's semi- autobiographical novel. The story begins after WWII in 1948, when Israel would never again be in a position to have it's people be exterminated by a madman, when they were granted permission by world leaders to have their own sovereign state, where every Jew would be welcome. The Arab Israeli conflict exploded and Arabs, mainly Palestinians left Israel in droves, not knowing what would happen if they had to live in Israel under Jewish rule.This is where Hind Husseini comes into the film. She is a Palestinian woman who sees the children left behind by the fleeing Arabs in 1948, mostly girls, by their families and takes care of them in her own home. In the beginning, she took care of a couple hundred children which later turned into 2,000. Hind Husseini turns her own estate into an orphanage and eventually a school for the Palestinian children. If she were Catholic, she would be a saint. The film definitely should have focused more on her, as she is so Ghandi-like and interesting. Hind Husseini believed strongly that peace could only come through education and intelligence.Eventually, through tragedy, Miral ends up living in the orphanage, where Hind Husseini hopes she has an impact on the girl, so she doesn't end up dead like the other young terrorists do. The movie mainly lets you see the Palestinian movement through the young eyes of Miral, along with some actual historical footage. The ending is of course telling the viewer that the Israeli-Palestinian problems have not yet been resolved even to this day. What the film doesn't tell you is why.I watched the news during the 60's and all the decades since and I can still hear Yasser Arafat stating that of the original 711,000 Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948, that their descendants who now number over 4.7 million have all rights to return to the places that their ancestors came from. These are people who were never even born in Israel. To make matters worse, every peace talk from Oslo to the Clinton talks, have all been rejected by the Palestinians, yet they have absolutely no proposals of their own. In 2010, Fatah leaders refuse to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. In 1969 alone, the PLO hijacked 82 planes. The Palestinian Liberation Organization have killed and terrorized so many innocent people on the planet- Americans, Europeans, Israelis- anyone to bring attention to themselves. Of course, this is never mentioned in the story, as it is a Palestinian child's view of her Palestinian world.The most important thing that came out of this movie is Hind Husseini's viewpoint. This truly unselfish, good woman believed that terrorism solves nothing but death and that education and intelligent people could figure out how to achieve peace. I hope someone, in a powerful position in both Palestine and Israel hear her words from someone who has seen this film, and use their brains instead of bombs to resolve their differences and learn to live together in peace forever.",4,Miral Contains A Message For Peace,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,3138,"['Miral', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'born', '1970', 'Israeli-', 'Palestinian', 'conflict', 'had', 'been', 'going', '2', 'decades', 'film', 'based', 'Rula', 'Jebreal', 'semi-', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'story', 'WWII', '1948', 'when', 'Israel', 'would', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'position', 'have', 'people', 'be', 'exterminated', 'madman', 'when', 'were', 'granted', 'permission', 'world', 'leaders', 'have', 'own', 'sovereign', 'state', 'where', 'Jew', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'Arab', 'Israeli', 'conflict', 'exploded', 'Arabs', 'mainly', 'Palestinians', 'left', 'Israel', 'droves', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'had', 'live', 'Israel', 'Jewish', 'rule.This', 'where', 'Hind', 'Husseini', 'film', 'Palestinian', 'woman', 'who', 'children', 'left', 'behind', 'fleeing', 'Arabs', '1948', 'mostly', 'girls', 'families', 'care', 'own', 'home', 'beginning', 'took', 'care', 'couple', 'hundred', 'children', 'later', 'turned', '2,000', 'Hind', 'Husseini', 'own', 'estate', 'orphanage', 'eventually', 'school', 'Palestinian', 'children', 'were', 'Catholic', 'would', 'be', 'saint', 'film', 'definitely', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'so', 'Ghandi-like', 'interesting', 'Hind', 'Husseini', 'believed', 'strongly', 'peace', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'education', 'intelligence.Eventually', 'tragedy', 'Miral', 'up', 'living', 'orphanage', 'where', 'Hind', 'Husseini', 'impact', 'girl', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'other', 'young', 'terrorists', 'do', 'movie', 'mainly', 'see', 'Palestinian', 'movement', 'young', 'eyes', 'Miral', 'actual', 'historical', 'footage', 'ending', 'course', 'telling', 'viewer', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'problems', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'resolved', 'even', 'day', 'What', 'film', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why.I', 'watched', 'news', '60', 'decades', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'Yasser', 'Arafat', 'stating', 'original', '711,000', 'Palestinians', 'who', 'fled', 'Israel', '1948', 'descendants', 'who', 'now', 'number', '4.7', 'million', 'have', 'rights', 'return', 'places', 'ancestors', 'came', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'even', 'born', 'Israel', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'peace', 'talk', 'Oslo', 'Clinton', 'talks', 'have', 'been', 'rejected', 'Palestinians', 'yet', 'have', 'absolutely', 'proposals', 'own', '2010', 'Fatah', 'leaders', 'refuse', 'recognize', 'Israel', 'Jewish', 'state', '1969', 'alone', 'PLO', 'hijacked', '82', 'planes', 'Palestinian', 'Liberation', 'Organization', 'have', 'killed', 'terrorized', 'so', 'many', 'innocent', 'people', 'planet-', 'Americans', 'Europeans', 'Israelis-', 'anyone', 'bring', 'attention', 'course', 'never', 'mentioned', 'story', 'Palestinian', 'child', 'view', 'Palestinian', 'world.The', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'came', 'movie', 'Hind', 'Husseini', 'viewpoint', 'truly', 'unselfish', 'good', 'woman', 'believed', 'terrorism', 'nothing', 'death', 'education', 'intelligent', 'people', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'achieve', 'peace', 'hope', 'someone', 'powerful', 'position', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'hear', 'words', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'use', 'brains', 'instead', 'bombs', 'resolve', 'differences', 'learn', 'live', 'together', 'peace', 'forever']",Miral
1432251,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B004XH9X2M,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","This is a film from Julian Schnabel based on the life of Hind Husseini (Hiam Abbass). She rescued some fifty five orphaned Palestinian children in 1947. This was the ending of the British mandate and the birth of Israel; and as history has shown no nation is born without pain. The pain that this film wants to expose is that of the displaced Palestinians.This handful of children soon becomes thousands and Hind opens a school for them, which is still educating such children today. The theme that runs through the film is that of education versus resistance, especially armed resistance. The paradox that is left unanswered is that the more education you have, the more aware you are of the alternatives and the increased sense of injustice has to, in certain cases, lead to armed revolt.The film uses the lives of four women to tell the story of the history of Israel from birth to the present day and the internal turmoil's of those fighting for Palestinian autonomy, including the PLO. That said this is not a bloody war based film, it is the study of people who make sacrifices for the betterment and care of others. There is frequent use of actual footage and it tends to show Israeli aggression, but I did not feel this was an anti Israeli film moreover it seemed to be saying that a peaceful coexistence could still be a reality in lieu of the enactment of the 1993 Oslo Accord which guaranteed two separate states - one Israel and one Palestine. This was a co production of France, Israel and Italy, but it is in English. With some Hebrew and some Arabic, it does tend to jump around a bit, and this may have been to attract a wider International audience, even Willem Dafoe and Vanessa Redgrave make short appearances.There are good performances all round and it both looks and sounds brilliant, if there are any criticisms it is that it takes on too big a task in trying to cover over fifty years of history and despite much effort comes across as being biased, and often spelling things out for the characters that would have been common knowledge. Once again that could have been for those new to this subject, but it still felt a bit unnecessary. That said I really did enjoy this film, it is 108 minutes long but just flew by, and it crams so much in at the beginning, that you blink and you miss something, whilst it slowed down towards the end I found that it still did not take away from the overall cause of the film.

1432253,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B004XH9X2M,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[1, 1]","Of course, this isnt really a fable, its the story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Like any two warring kingdoms, there is always the little princess left homeless and orphaned, and the Fairy Godmother who raises the hidden princess to discover her true identity. If MIRAL has a center, a purpose, that's it. Forget for a moment the historical tale of Israel told from 1947 to 1987, the time of the first Intafada, and forget that MIRAL is based on a semi-autobiography of the story's heroine. What we are seeing is the struggle of discovery, the yearning for love, peace and security, in a time and place where this is not seemingly possible. Miral's story starts out with two cameo performances by Willem Defoe and Vanessa Redgrave, who frame the young Hird Husseini as an idealistic woman thrust by the tides of history, into creating an orphanage/school, for orphaned victums of the first war against Israel in 1947. Ms. Husseini is the Fairy Godmother figure in this Fable, the face of compassion, hope and spirituality of the Palestinian people. After she opens her orphanage, the story jumps decades forward to Miral's mother, who was raped by her father. Spiritually broken, and working as a belly dancer, she becomes an alcoholic. A public altercation lands her in jail, where we meet Miral's future Aunt Fatima, a nurse in jail for an attempted terrorist bombing. The two women are cellmates, and thru Fatima, Miral's mother meets Miral's father. They get married, tho Miral's mother cheats on her newlywed husband during the reception, and becomes pregnant. Guilt and alchoholism drives Miral's mom to suicide, leaving Miral's father, a devote Muslim, with no choice but to put his 6 year old daughter in the orphanage run by his friend, Hird Husseini. Under her tuleage, Miral thrives intellectually, tho the weight of the Palistinian injustices as second class citizens weighs on her. Miral falls under the influence of a young Palistinian man associated with the PLO. She also becomes (unwittingly) involved in a failed terrorist attack, and violent demonstrations. Hird Husseini (the fairy Godmother) tries her best to stear her young protogee in the direction of being a peaceful teacher of reading and writing in the worst of the Palistinian refugee camps. At this point, Israel is seen as the instigator of severe, cruel injustices. Actually, torture at the hands of the police against Miral, the destruction of innocent people's homes, and Miral's growing rage against all Israelis, becomes a bit heavy handed. In an attempt to keep his daughter away from the PLO, Miral's father sends MIRAL to stay with her Aunt Fatima, who's Son is dating a young Jewish woman.Miral's distrust and dislike of this young jewish woman points out the central problem with relationships between Israeli Jews and Palistinians. Years of segregation, poverty, cruel treatment by Israelis who treat Palistinians like second class citizens in what was once their homeland, has built up hatred in the Palistinian people. WHen the film begins to rail against Israel, the fairy tale quality of the misplaced ""princess"" MIRAL, and the guidence by her Fairy Godmother Mama Hirn (the director of the orphanage), starts to fall apart. If there is a DRAGON, an evil socerer attempting to destroy what is good and noble in MIRAL, its HATRED of her neighbors. But what about how Israeli's view anti-Israeli demonstrations, and jihadist ideology? What the film DOES NOT SHOW, is how three surprise wars against Israel by their Arab neighbors, and routine acts of terrorism against civilians, justifies the Israelis lack trust in the Muslim Palistinians. (There are christian Palistinians, but they arent terrorists.) At times, the film comes very close to turning into an out and out diatribe against Zionist Zealots. IF the film had shown how the extremists on both sides of this issue cause most of the problems, it would have been more symetrical, more balanced. To be fair, the film ""MIRAL"" doesnt hide that this will be the Palistinin side of the story. The pro-terrorist, Muslim jihadist philosophy is embodied by Miral's boyfriend who belongs to the PLO, and her Aunt Fatima.  The ""good side"" of young, westernized Israelis is protrayed by Miral's cousin's Jewish girlfriend, who attempts to befriend the bitter, suspicious Miral. If this side of Israelis were not shown, this film would be propaganda, rather than a layered, subtle examination of the Jewish/Palistinian problem. The film's ending, when the Palistinian PLO member tells MIRAL, that ANY settlement with Israel that ends with SOME Palistinian soventry is better than 4 decades of constant war, terrorism and fighting, shows that BOTH SIDES ULTIMATELY WANT PEACE. When the OSLO agreement is reached, we realize that the Fairy Godmother's goal of giving the PRINCESS (MIRAL) her kingdom back (Palistine), has been reached. (The 1987 OSLO treaty was an agreement to create a PALISTINE state in the GAZA STRIP and the WEST BANK.) Tho here the fairy tale ends, and so does the movie. In our real life, there are no fairy tale happy endings. THis film tackels a complicated social, political, and personal narrative in only 106 minutes. In ways the film attempts to examine too many issues, and loses its focus. IF you have seen the director's other film THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (also based on an autobiography), you know his power to protray mankinds struggle against the worst of sorrowful situations, thru the dignity and hope of the human spirit. At his best, Schnabel's films have a dreamlike quality, with fluid, inventive cinematography. In MIRAL, the dream is more nightmarish, with personal problems reflecting global problems. The main character's struggle towards personal & spiritual fulfillment against the worst odds, binds MIRAL to DIVING BELL AND BUTTERFLY, on the thematic level. Even tho both films are made by a master of the cinematic art, MIRAL doesnt quite live up to the eerie beauty shown in DIVING BELL. I could more easily identify with the struggles of an intelligent person trapped in a broken body (DIVING BELL), than the story of an intelligent person trapped in a broken society. (Palistine) This is because I cant identify with the Palistinian's terrorist mindset. Many of this film's characters ARE terrorists, if only wannabe terrorists. If cinema is to function as art, your heart has to identify with the main characters. I believe its possible to identify with their pain, but not their actions. Good art needs to raise questions, including difficult ones like the muslim Palistinian question. Since MIRAL does this, and with beauty and compassion, I have to agree its a good film. If the film were more balanced in outlook, I think it would have worked better. (For example, why couldnt MIRAL's cousin's jewish girlfriend relate her fears about muslim terrorists in her society, or how she feels about 3 surprise wars against Israel, after having gone thru the Holacost?) ""MIRAL"" makes you examine an issue so difficult, most people just ignore it. And it accomplishes this with great actors, clever cinematography, a talented director, and cool music by Tom Waits, Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson.
