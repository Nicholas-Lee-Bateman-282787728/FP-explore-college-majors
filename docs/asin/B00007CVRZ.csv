726636,A1P5D6RTT42XO8,B00007CVRZ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Bleed was going to win picture of the year.  The movie certainly is not the best movie ever made.  Bleed does not add anything original to the standard slasher film premise.  So, what is Bleed and why did I give it three stars?Bleed has good production values and lots of violence and T&A.;  In this day of straight to DVD low budget horror where spit and polish are almost extinct, Full Moon took the time and money to give the movie a more professional look than many straight to DVD movies.  From the flashy graphics at the beginning to the satin finish on the rest of the movie, it looks like what you would expect to see from a bigger production company.The actors were mostly newbies when this film was made and they do come off very stilted.  Oddly enough, Rochon was a veteran of over 80 films as this point and she seemed to come off the most wooden.Even though I'm not a fan of slasher movies, I will admit that I really liked the idea behind the Murder Club and got wrapped in it quite a bit.  The poor scripting and junior level acting aside, it's a very watchable slasher film that is not meant to take your breath away, just entertain you for a while.  In the end, that is what Full Moon production does well.On the flip side, my wife read this review and laughed out loud.

726637,A3D1W9DU4XB30Q,B00007CVRZ,Bobby,"[0, 0]","Look it's almost impossible for a slasher film to be outright boring, and Bleed is definitly not boring. Sure it isn't a great movie all around, but does it really matter? Slasher fans are usually alot more forgiven when it comes to technical aspects anyways.The plot is very simple. A woman gets invited to join her new boyfriends ""murder club"", and soon enough members of the club begin to be picked off by a killler in a white mask.As you see it's pretty basic, but basic is all this film really needed to be. The directing is just ok, the acting is nothing more than passable, and there's not a scare in sight, but who cares? Bleed is never once boring, and that is all that really matters here.Now the amount of nudity in this film seems to be mentioned alot, but honestly there's not as much as people like to claim. There's a pool scene where everyone strips down (both male and female), and that's pretty much it. The cast are all in great shape, and are all attractive. It's a bit of an extended scene, but nobody's eyes are gonna be sore or anything :p. *shrug*.As for the gore? There's some gory scenes (the opening is pretty gory), but nothing over the top or anything.The dvd itself has quite a few deleted or extended scenes, some bios, a script reading, and some trailers. Most people will probably skip the extras, but there's some if people are interested.Overall I like Bleed. It's not worth watching if you don't like the genre of course, and there's plenty of other better slasher films to watch if you're just starting out on the genre, but it's worth at least one watch for slasher film superfans.",3,I actually kinda like this movie,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1619,"['Look', 'almost', 'impossible', 'slasher', 'film', 'be', 'outright', 'boring', 'Bleed', 'definitly', 'not', 'boring', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'around', 'really', 'matter', 'Slasher', 'fans', 'are', 'usually', 'alot', 'more', 'forgiven', 'when', 'technical', 'aspects', 'anyways.The', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'woman', 'invited', 'join', 'new', 'boyfriends', 'murder', 'club', 'soon', 'enough', 'members', 'club', 'begin', 'be', 'picked', 'off', 'killler', 'white', 'mask.As', 'see', 'pretty', 'basic', 'basic', 'film', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'directing', 'just', 'ok', 'acting', 'nothing', 'more', 'passable', 'not', 'scare', 'sight', 'who', 'Bleed', 'never', 'once', 'boring', 'really', 'matters', 'here.Now', 'amount', 'nudity', 'film', 'be', 'mentioned', 'alot', 'honestly', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'claim', 'pool', 'scene', 'where', 'everyone', 'down', 'male', 'female', 'pretty', 'much', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'shape', 'are', 'attractive', 'bit', 'extended', 'scene', 'nobody', 'eyes', 'are', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'sore', 'anything', 'p.', '*shrug*.As', 'gore', 'gory', 'scenes', 'opening', 'pretty', 'gory', 'nothing', 'top', 'anything.The', 'dvd', 'quite', 'few', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'bios', 'script', 'reading', 'trailers', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'skip', 'extras', 'people', 'are', 'interested.Overall', 'like', 'Bleed', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'genre', 'course', 'plenty', 'other', 'better', 'slasher', 'films', 'watch', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'genre', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'watch', 'slasher', 'film', 'superfans']",Bleed

Cook ""Scabboy""","[1, 2]","[good things]Debbie Rochon was one of the few good things, small appearances by Julie Strain, Brine Stevens, Lloyd Kauffman and Lizzy Strain also helped this movie. However, it would take more than that. The thought og the plot was actually pretty good. The way it was carried out was not. There were a couple good kills (The throat slash, and the lady Maddie kills in the parking garage) in the movie, but there was way too many slow moments.[the bad]The problem is that they tried to take a cast full of beautiful 'girl and boy next door' types and put then into this 90210 meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre situation, and it did not work. The people just turned out being jackasses and I was actually happy to see them die for tricking Maddie (Debbie Rochon). The acting, or course was horrible, there was a ball shot on a guy, which was funny, not enough female nudity, and very little blood. The ending of the movie also pissed me off.[final thoughts]Sadly, this movie is probably one of Debbie Rochon's best, character and acting-wise. Her character was great. Very likable, beautiful and well developed. That is about as deep as this movie got. I really found it hard to sit through this movie, and kept hoping for the movie to get back to Maddie's scenes. I always find it hard to hate movies, because even the worst movies have very good things about them.

As a public service, however, I will do what I can to deter people from possibly renting this piece of garbage.The plot is strictly formula slasher flick.  The killer walks around with a mask (gosh, how original) and methodically kills people.  The whole movie looks like it was made by a couple of amateurs who were given a video camera and decided to recruit their friends.  I suppose you could watch this with your own friends and have fun arguments as to whether it was the acting, direction or writing that was the worst; a good case could be made for all three.I suppose if you like seeing topless women, you might find some virtue in this movie, but you're better off renting a porn flick which will probably even have better production values.  I've given one-star reviews before, but most of those movies are virtual Citizen Kanes compared to this one.  Actually, this movie aspires to reach the one-star level.Actually this DVD does have a little worth.

Stringini ""moviman7643""","[2, 4]","I really wasn't expecting much from this movie, and in the end I thought it was just ok, but then I remembered that it was a Full Moon film (the Shadow label is under Full Moon).  That changed my view on the movie.  For a Full Moon film, this one is gold.First off, the death scenes.  The director didn't skimp one bit on those.  People are graphically gutted, stabbed,shocked, and smashed.  Deffinatly a plus, especially in an age were gore is hard to come by in slasher films.Then there is the acting.  The cast had potential.  All the actors showed some talent, but in the end the script held them back at times.  Sometimes things just seemed odd or out of place, and at others they seemed to flow fine.  This is the first film I have seen with Debbie Rochon, and I have to say that, for a Scream Queen, she is a pretty good actress.  The man who played Simon also did a decent job with what he was given.On the other hand things tend to move a little to slow for a film like this.  A slasher film really shouldn't have a deep plot.  This film attempts it, but in the end just falls flat. Although I do have to say that the ending was nice and bitter.For anyone who is looking for a nice gooey slasher film, I have to say this is a winner.  Oh, just one warning, there is an ungodly amount of guy [rear] in this movie. Almost every male character in this film (with the exception of one) is naked at some time or another.  Kind of odd for a film that is aimed at a mostly male audience.
