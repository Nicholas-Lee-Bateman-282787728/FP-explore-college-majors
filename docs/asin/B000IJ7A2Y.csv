1021017,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000IJ7A2Y,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 8]","In this Pilates workout, instructor Lizbeth Garcia puts some unique spins on a traditional Pilates matwork sequence.  Rather than begin with the hundred (in fact, the hundred does not even appear), she starts with a modified roll-up, adding an oblique move before going on to the full roll-up.  She also switches up other classic Pilates sequences such as the Series of 5:  in Liz's version of this series, you begin with a single leg sweep in and out, add leg circles, move into the single leg stretch, add criss-cross, and finish by flowing into the single straight leg stretch.  There is also quite a bit of leg/glute work here, not just with Liz's variation on the side series, but also with some moves performed on all fours as well as a challenging push-up series which adds a leg lift.  Although most of the Pilates moves that Liz includes are generally considered beginning level (ie, there are no rollovers, teasers, or other more intermediate/advanced Pilates exercises here), Liz's flowing pace combined with her unique twists make this more of an intermediate Pilates workout.This DVD also includes a ""Bonus Total-body Blitz,"" which is a 12-minute weighted workout led by another Shape instructor, Tracy York.  Tracy uses 2 sets of weights here, and after a very quick warm-up, she starts with some compound moves:  squats and lunges with biceps curls.  She also does several series of moves that flow together, such as a shoulder row, mid-back row, and overhead press combo and a second combo that includes a front raise, reverse shoulder squeeze, and elbow lower.  The moves on the floor include a push-up/leg lift combo, a chest series, and a few nice weighted abs moves.  Overall, this workout does hit a lot in a short period of time.Finally, this DVD includes a nice little booklet called ""Simple Tips to Better Health""; it contains Pointers on Pilates Form, Power Up Your Pilates (a review of basic Pilates principles), 4 Simple Calorie Blasters, and A Few Facts about Breast Health (this DVD is also sometimes referred to as ""Pilates for Pink,"" as part of the proceeds go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation).  I would say that his DVD is most ideally suited to advanced beginner to intermediate Pilates practioners who are looking to work their whole body and don't mind more non-traditional Pilates sequencing.",4,A full-body Pilates workout with some unique twists,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2337,"['workout', 'instructor', 'Lizbeth', 'Garcia', 'unique', 'spins', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'sequence', 'Rather', 'begin', 'hundred', 'fact', 'hundred', 'not', 'even', 'appear', 'modified', 'roll-up', 'adding', 'oblique', 'move', 'going', 'full', 'roll-up', 'also', 'up', 'other', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'sequences', 'such', 'Series', '5', 'Liz', 'version', 'series', 'begin', 'single', 'leg', 'sweep', 'add', 'leg', 'circles', 'move', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'add', 'criss-cross', 'finish', 'flowing', 'single', 'straight', 'leg', 'stretch', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'leg/glute', 'work', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'Liz', 'variation', 'side', 'series', 'also', 'moves', 'performed', 'fours', 'as', 'well', 'challenging', 'push-up', 'series', 'leg', 'lift', 'most', 'Pilates', 'Liz', 'are', 'generally', 'considered', 'beginning', 'level', 'ie', 'are', 'rollovers', 'teasers', 'other', 'more', 'intermediate/advanced', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'here', 'Liz', 'flowing', 'pace', 'combined', 'unique', 'twists', 'make', 'more', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'workout.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'Bonus', 'Total-body', 'Blitz', '12-minute', 'weighted', 'workout', 'led', 'Shape', 'instructor', 'Tracy', 'York', 'Tracy', '2', 'sets', 'weights', 'here', 'very', 'quick', 'warm-up', 'compound', 'moves', 'squats', 'lunges', 'biceps', 'curls', 'also', 'several', 'series', 'moves', 'flow', 'together', 'such', 'shoulder', 'row', 'mid-back', 'row', 'overhead', 'press', 'combo', 'second', 'combo', 'front', 'raise', 'reverse', 'shoulder', 'squeeze', 'elbow', 'lower', 'moves', 'floor', 'include', 'push-up/leg', 'lift', 'combo', 'chest', 'series', 'few', 'nice', 'weighted', 'abs', 'moves', 'Overall', 'workout', 'hit', 'lot', 'short', 'period', 'time.Finally', 'DVD', 'nice', 'little', 'booklet', 'called', 'Simple', 'Tips', 'Better', 'Health', 'Pointers', 'Pilates', 'Form', 'Power', 'Up', 'Pilates', 'review', 'basic', 'Pilates', 'principles', '4', 'Simple', 'Calorie', 'Blasters', 'A', 'Few', 'Facts', 'Breast', 'Health', 'DVD', 'also', 'sometimes', 'referred', 'Pilates', 'Pink', 'part', 'proceeds', 'go', 'Breast', 'Cancer', 'Research', 'Foundation', 'would', 'say', 'DVD', 'most', 'ideally', 'suited', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'practioners', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'work', 'whole', 'body', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'more', 'non-traditional', 'Pilates', 'sequencing']","Shape Pilates: Workout, Firm Up From Head to Toe"

1021019,A2S0V1HU2MEAW3,B000IJ7A2Y,"C. Nickel ""SunshineBVI""","[1, 2]","Overall, I would say there is nothing really special about this workout. It's all pretty basic Pilates, mostly all done laying on your mat. I would have liked to have some standing work mixed in to get a bit more work on the legs. It also feels really short - it's over before you work up a sweat or even feel slightly fatigued. And the sets are also too short - I like to feel my body straining to complete the last few reps before moving on - I didn't even get close in this DVD.The instructor, while not overly annoying, is definitely not one of my favorites. The way the video is edited, it seems that in between virtually every set, she is saying, ""Okay, moving on..."". I know, not that annoying, but it was noticable - especially after you do the DVD more than once.SHAPE's DVDs are normally my favorites, but this one was a bit of a disappointment.",3,"basic pilates, basic video - nothing special here",1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,855,"['Overall', 'would', 'say', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'workout', 'pretty', 'basic', 'Pilates', 'mostly', 'done', 'laying', 'mat', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'standing', 'work', 'mixed', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'work', 'legs', 'also', 'really', 'short', 'over', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'even', 'feel', 'slightly', 'fatigued', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'too', 'short', 'like', 'feel', 'body', 'straining', 'complete', 'last', 'few', 'reps', 'moving', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'close', 'DVD.The', 'instructor', 'not', 'overly', 'annoying', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'favorites', 'way', 'video', 'edited', 'virtually', 'set', 'saying', 'Okay', 'moving', 'know', 'not', 'annoying', 'was', 'noticable', 'especially', 'do', 'DVD', 'more', 'once.SHAPE', 'DVDs', 'are', 'normally', 'favorites', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment']","Shape Pilates: Workout, Firm Up From Head to Toe"
1021020,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000IJ7A2Y,Little Miss Cutey,"[10, 11]","We almost all have a resolution to workout more and get in better shape and this is a good place to begin.  I have the other Shape workouts and they are all good as is this.With the usual pilates moves and a fast paced pace, it's a good and challenging routine to do.  Lizbeth Garcia leads it, and she's motivating and she cues well.  There is a ten minute routine at the end done with dumbells and led by Tracey York.  Both are excellent instructors and the whole routine is fun and flows well.  It's a nice break from all the cardio, but just about as important.  It's about 48 minutes or so all up, and I think that if you are intermediate or advanced, then it's perfect for you.",5,Good workout for the New Year ;-),1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,682,"['almost', 'have', 'resolution', 'workout', 'more', 'get', 'better', 'shape', 'good', 'place', 'begin', 'have', 'other', 'Shape', 'workouts', 'are', 'good', 'usual', 'moves', 'fast', 'paced', 'pace', 'good', 'challenging', 'routine', 'do', 'Lizbeth', 'Garcia', 'motivating', 'well', 'ten', 'minute', 'routine', 'end', 'done', 'dumbells', 'led', 'Tracey', 'York', 'are', 'excellent', 'instructors', 'whole', 'routine', 'fun', 'well', 'nice', 'break', 'cardio', 'just', 'as', 'important', '48', 'minutes', 'so', 'up', 'think', 'are', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'then', 'perfect']","Shape Pilates: Workout, Firm Up From Head to Toe"
1021021,AT79BAVA063DG,B000IJ7A2Y,ReadNReVu,"[3, 3]","This is a really nice Pilates workout that gets right down to exercises and has little to no idle chitchat. The music is upbeat and the instructor is cheerful, yet professional, so it doesn't seem like you're spending 30 minutes doing this workout. Some of the exercises could be performed a little more slowly for greater effect, but she does stop briefly between most exercises so you can easily catch up if you choose to slow down a bit.I like the fact that it doesn't have The Hundred or The Teaser, and while others have said that this is a beginner/intermediate workout, there are several exercises where you could use very light weights that wrap around the hands or the small dumbbells with straps that walkers use (just enough weight to give some resistance) and ramp up the workout that way.The bonus workout (on a separate menu--wish this kind of thing were just put on the main menu for ease of use) is a real keeper. Different instructor, and she is also cheerful yet professional. The 12-minute workout hits just about all the major areas, and would be great to use prior to a workout like Callanetics, which is a great workout but has no upper body work to speak of.",5,"Great bonus weight workout, too.",1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,1181,"['really', 'nice', 'Pilates', 'right', 'down', 'exercises', 'little', 'idle', 'chitchat', 'music', 'upbeat', 'instructor', 'cheerful', 'yet', 'professional', ""n't"", 'seem', ""'re"", 'spending', '30', 'minutes', 'doing', 'workout', 'exercises', 'could', 'be', 'performed', 'little', 'more', 'slowly', 'greater', 'effect', 'stop', 'briefly', 'most', 'exercises', 'so', 'can', 'easily', 'catch', 'up', 'choose', 'slow', 'down', 'bit.I', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hundred', 'Teaser', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'beginner/intermediate', 'workout', 'are', 'several', 'exercises', 'where', 'could', 'use', 'very', 'light', 'weights', 'wrap', 'hands', 'small', 'dumbbells', 'straps', 'walkers', 'use', 'just', 'enough', 'weight', 'give', 'resistance', 'ramp', 'up', 'workout', 'way.The', 'bonus', 'workout', 'separate', 'menu', 'wish', 'kind', 'thing', 'were', 'just', 'put', 'main', 'menu', 'ease', 'use', 'real', 'keeper', 'Different', 'instructor', 'also', 'cheerful', 'yet', 'professional', '12-minute', 'workout', 'just', 'major', 'areas', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'use', 'prior', 'workout', 'Callanetics', 'great', 'workout', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'speak']","Shape Pilates: Workout, Firm Up From Head to Toe"
