They don't have anybody I've ever heard of and most of them are very recent. (most of them really suck too!) Thsi one is pretty  cool, about a drug company doing (illegal) experimentation on people, with nasty zombie-like side effects. There is a fair amount of character developement, and even though the whole movie was shot in an abandoned hospital (I am guessing), you really get to care about the actors.  Take it for what it is-a really low budget, possibly student, film-sit back and enjoy it. One silly thing in the movie is that they didn't bother to fix the time codes on the video cameras that show theit POV throughout the movie...according to the time codes, the whole thing happened in less than 10 seconds!

You know its the unauthorized type of medical/military/government/private industry experiments thats hush&#8230;hush and under the radar.The stories pacing reads like an EKG strip up down up down and finally flat line. When things finally start to happen they come to a screeching halt again and the test subject conflicts start up again like a broken record.You will get the basic idea of what the story is about as you follow along, but there is so much left out that will leave you feeling cheated after watching the entire movie. At the end they summarize the story for the viewer however while they are doing that the background music is so loud that you can't hear(at least I couldn't hear them talking) what they are saying about the experimental  trials.The acting ranged from decent to bad which coincided with the writing and the direction in this production. If you are a fan of shakey cam work, then you'll like this movie because it has a fair amount of it. The location setting(abandoned hospital) was probably the best part of the movie. The creatures(zombies/lab rats/guinea pigs) or whatever they were make up was ok, but nothing original. There was some low level gore (severed arm, teeth, blood and gun shot wounds) effects that were above amateur, but below professionally done. The attempted kill scenes (using firearms was so anemic that I wondered why they were even used as props with between 20 to 30 rounds fired at most) were weak and not as violent as is normally seen in the zombie? genre nor was there any nude/sex scenes in the movie. There was some foul language, but again not as intense nor used as often in this genre.This is one of those movies that some may enjoy while others can't wait until its over. I was in the latter group. To sum it up, it was a whole lot of nothing! 2 generous stars for its location.",2,"""EXPIRED""",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,1920,"['premise', 'story', 'not', 'new', 'did', 'show', 'signs', 'promise', 'know', 'unauthorized', 'type', 'medical/military/government/private', 'industry', 'experiments', 'hush', '8230', 'hush', 'radar.The', 'stories', 'pacing', 'reads', 'EKG', 'strip', 'up', 'down', 'up', 'down', 'finally', 'flat', 'line', 'When', 'things', 'finally', 'start', 'happen', 'come', 'screeching', 'halt', 'again', 'test', 'subject', 'conflicts', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'broken', 'record.You', 'will', 'get', 'basic', 'idea', 'what', 'story', 'follow', 'along', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'watching', 'entire', 'movie', 'end', 'summarize', 'story', 'viewer', 'however', 'are', 'doing', 'background', 'music', 'so', 'loud', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'least', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'talking', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'experimental', 'trials.The', 'acting', 'ranged', 'decent', 'bad', 'coincided', 'writing', 'direction', 'production', 'are', 'fan', 'shakey', 'cam', 'work', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'fair', 'amount', 'location', 'setting', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'creatures', 'zombies/lab', 'rats/guinea', 'pigs', 'were', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'ok', 'nothing', 'original', 'was', 'low', 'level', 'gore', 'severed', 'arm', 'teeth', 'blood', 'gun', 'shot', 'wounds', 'effects', 'were', 'amateur', 'professionally', 'done', 'attempted', 'kill', 'scenes', 'using', 'firearms', 'was', 'so', 'anemic', 'wondered', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'used', 'props', '20', '30', 'rounds', 'fired', 'most', 'were', 'weak', 'not', 'as', 'violent', 'normally', 'seen', 'zombie', 'genre', 'was', 'nude/sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'foul', 'language', 'again', 'not', 'intense', 'used', 'often', 'genre.This', 'one', 'movies', 'may', 'enjoy', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'was', 'latter', 'group', 'sum', 'up', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'nothing', '2', 'generous', 'stars', 'location']",Expiration

They are:1) William Hunter (Brandon Auret) is an ex-policeman. We later find out he has alcohol and cigarette addictions. He provides for inner conflict.2) Jake Butler (Ryan Macquet) has brain cancer.3) Samantha Foxx (Ingeborg Riedmaier) is a waitress with asthma.4) Dominic Black (Michael Thompson) is the brains in the group. He is in a wheel chair.The four are administered a drug and wake up somewhat free from their disorders. They are in a multilevel abandoned hospital type building with no knowledge as to what is going on. They are B-15 test subjects.The subplot consists of a B-14 test subject and an intruder running around with armed security attempting to grab them. It appears the one test subject has razor sharp teeth, a killer instinct, and some type of regenerative property.Both you and the B-15 test subjects try to figure out what is going on from the clues. To be honest, I was fooled as I went down the direction they lead me, ignoring other factors which I wrote off.The film was interesting, but the set was dull. Even though it was a horror/action/mystery/thriller I was bored during some of the middle action. The characters were a bit lame, but later I found out that was by design. Not a bad rental.
