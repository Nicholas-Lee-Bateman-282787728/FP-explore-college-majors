1678938,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00GMV89QI,ahoffoss,"[9, 13]","Ok, as with most all ""spoof"" movies, this one has it's good AND bad.  But I gotta say, this one is actually pretty entertaining!  For someone to decide to combine ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hangover"",...well, that says a bit about those people.  Two of the most opposite movies you could think of being combined into one just seems like a recipe for a total flop, but once again,...it's pretty funny!  Both actors playing Ed (Ben Begley) and Zach (Herbert Russell) could easily replace Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis in The Hangover and you'd never know the difference!  As for Bradley (Ross Nathan) and Doug (John Livingston), it took me a bit to realize which was playing which role.  Not to say they did their roles badly, quite the opposite!  They did really good roles, but didn't look the parts as well as the others did!  Rita Volk as Katnip was another pleasant surprise!  I'd never heard of her before this movie, but I'd like to see her in more movies in the future.  If you can make it to the games (about 15 minutes in) then you'll get some pretty good laughs!  Oddly enough, Bruce Jenner (who I am complete SICK of hearing about) is actually pretty funny in this movie as well.  I was REALLY surprised with that.If you're thinking about watching it with your kids, then you DEFINITELY need to rethink that parenting decision.  This movie is completely FILTHY!  Filthy in a funny way, but filthy, none the less!  It is what it is.The movie begins as ""The Hangover"" began with Bradley calling Doug's ""bride"" and saying they lost Doug and they aren't going to make it.  Of course, we cut to flashback and the real story begins.  Bladley, Doug, Zach, and  Ed arrive at the hotel for a bachelor party and Doug makes it perfectly clear they are going to remain SOBER for once, because bad things ALWAYS happen when they go out for a bachelor party.  Obviously things end up taking a turn for the worse and when they awaken the next morning, they find themselves on a train heading for ""The Hungover Games"".  Apparently, in their ""drunken/drugged"" state, they were transported to the future and volunteered as tributes.Basically, this is were the movie really takes off.  I don't want to ruin it for you, because it's way funnier going in without knowing anything about it.  I would imagine, at least.All in all, this movie isn't as funny to me as say, ""Not Another Teen Movie"", but that movie also had one specific formula it was following.  This one has MANY!  And I'm sure I'm leaving some stuff out.  This movie completely flew under the radar, but it was well worth it for me!  I enjoyed watching it and at only 1:24, there's enough to keep you watching.Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  Especially it you're drinking with some friends.If you found my review to be helpful please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below so I feel like I'm doing something right.

1678943,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B00GMV89QI,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 1]","Generally speaking, I love parodies of popular films (yeah especially if I actually watched the original).  How would I ever forget &#34;Scary Movie&#34; or Scary Movie 2, or Spaceballs, or Robot Chicken's versions of Star Wars for example?Prior to seeing Hungover Games, I'd already watched &#34;The Starving Games&#34; which I thought was pretty good (and Breaking Wind, a parody of the Twilight films).  Several things make a great parody.  One is how closely the actors and actresses resemble those in the original movie.  Here, Hungover Games gets a B-.  There's a pretty good look-alike for Ed Helms, but the girl doing Katniss does not look that close to Jennifer Lawrence.  As far as other characters, it isn't so hard to look like Elizabeth Banks' Effie, or Depp's Wonka, with all the makeup and props.  Some of the others were dreadful (like Harrelson's double).Second: it helps to have clever dialog.  Here, I give this a C-.Third: it's particularly cool when a parody manages a script that mashes up scenes from numerous other films and makes it all hang together like one story.  Again, this is somewhere below a C.  Good acting, directing and photography of course also help, and here the acting is erratic; some pretty good and some abysmal.Overall I thought Starving Games was more fun than Hungover Games.  Though if you are over 21 with the mind of an adolescent, you may find some of the nudity and some of the visual jokes worth it, but this is simply no classic parody.",2,I feel slightly hungover,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,1490,"['Generally', 'speaking', 'love', 'parodies', 'popular', 'films', 'yeah', 'especially', 'actually', 'watched', 'original', 'How', 'would', 'ever', 'forget', '34', 'Scary', 'Movie', '34', 'Scary', 'Movie', '2', 'Spaceballs', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'versions', 'Star', 'Wars', 'example', 'Prior', 'seeing', 'Hungover', 'Games', ""'d"", 'already', 'watched', '34', 'Starving', 'Games', '34', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Breaking', 'Wind', 'parody', 'Twilight', 'films', 'Several', 'things', 'make', 'great', 'parody', 'One', 'how', 'closely', 'actors', 'actresses', 'resemble', 'original', 'movie', 'Here', 'Hungover', 'Games', 'B-', 'pretty', 'good', 'look-alike', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'girl', 'doing', 'Katniss', 'not', 'look', 'close', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'As', 'far', 'other', 'characters', ""n't"", 'so', 'hard', 'look', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Effie', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'makeup', 'props', 'others', 'were', 'dreadful', 'Harrelson', 'double', '.Second', 'have', 'clever', 'dialog', 'Here', 'give', 'C-.Third', 'particularly', 'cool', 'when', 'parody', 'script', 'up', 'scenes', 'numerous', 'other', 'films', 'hang', 'together', 'one', 'story', 'Again', 'somewhere', 'C.', 'Good', 'acting', 'directing', 'photography', 'course', 'also', 'help', 'here', 'acting', 'erratic', 'pretty', 'good', 'abysmal.Overall', 'thought', 'Starving', 'Games', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'Hungover', 'Games', 'are', '21', 'mind', 'adolescent', 'may', 'find', 'nudity', 'visual', 'jokes', 'simply', 'classic', 'parody']",The Hungover Games
