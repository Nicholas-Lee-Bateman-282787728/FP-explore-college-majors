776051,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B0000CEB61,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[3, 3]","Chicago, in addition to being one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever, are also known for very dynamic live performances. Up until 2002, the only documents of them in concert were the classic but somewhat dated 1972 recording ""At Carnegie Hall"" and their 1999 live album, which was woefully lacking. But for a concise and enjoyable concert of the band performing all their hits spanning their whole career, this 2002 A&E special is near perfect. Here you have Chicago perfoming five decades worth of hit songs, including ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is"", ""Beginnings"", ""25 Or 6 To 4"", ""Saturday In The Park"", ""You're The Inspiration"", ""Look Away"" and ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"". There's not much in the way of diversity as most of these are the songs you'd hear in a standard Chicago concert, but the performances sound lively and fresh, the same way they did 30 years ago. If there's anything about the show that I didn't like, it was host Mark McEwen. He really was annoying, and I was irked when one caller requested either ""Heart In Pieces"" or ""If You Leave Me Now"", and McEwen made him choose ""If You Leave Me Now. Having the group perform ""Heart In Pieces"" or better yet the song the caller initially requested, Terry Kath's ""In Terms Of Two, (which they wouldn't have played anyway because they feel uncomfortable about playing Kath material since his untimely 1978 death) would have added some variety to the otherwise standard setlist. But other than that, this is an energetic and highly enjoyable concert, and the tributes by Jay Leno, Dick Clark and others were nice to watch. This is a dvd I would recommend to any Chicago fan.",5,A Great Chicago Live Performance,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,1652,"['Chicago', 'addition', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'rock', 'roll', 'bands', 'ever', 'are', 'also', 'known', 'very', 'dynamic', 'live', 'performances', '2002', 'only', 'documents', 'concert', 'were', 'classic', 'somewhat', 'dated', '1972', 'recording', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', '1999', 'live', 'album', 'was', 'woefully', 'lacking', 'concise', 'enjoyable', 'concert', 'band', 'performing', 'hits', 'spanning', 'whole', 'career', '2002', 'A', 'E', 'special', 'near', 'perfect', 'Here', 'have', 'Chicago', 'perfoming', 'five', 'decades', 'worth', 'hit', 'songs', 'including', 'Does', 'Anybody', 'Really', 'Know', 'What', 'Time', 'Beginnings', '25', '6', '4', 'Saturday', 'Park', ""'re"", 'Inspiration', 'Look', 'Away', 'Hard', 'Say', ""'m"", 'Sorry', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'diversity', 'most', 'are', 'songs', ""'d"", 'hear', 'standard', 'Chicago', 'concert', 'performances', 'sound', 'lively', 'fresh', 'same', 'way', 'did', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'anything', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'host', 'Mark', 'McEwen', 'really', 'was', 'annoying', 'was', 'irked', 'when', 'one', 'caller', 'requested', 'Heart', 'Pieces', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Now', 'McEwen', 'made', 'choose', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Now', 'Having', 'group', 'perform', 'Heart', 'Pieces', 'better', 'yet', 'song', 'caller', 'initially', 'requested', 'Terry', 'Kath', 'Terms', 'Two', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'played', 'anyway', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'playing', 'Kath', 'material', 'untimely', '1978', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'variety', 'otherwise', 'standard', 'setlist', 'other', 'energetic', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'concert', 'tributes', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'others', 'were', 'nice', 'watch', 'dvd', 'would', 'recommend', 'Chicago', 'fan']",N/A

It's nobody's fault that it is what it is (Terry Kath has been dead for 26 years and Cetera seems to be happy with his solo music).  One of the main reasons why this band sounded the way they did was the sound of Lamm, Kath, and Cetera's alternating lead vocals, with 2/3 of that missing, they sound like a really great cover band.  When they've done newer stuff like the Christmas album it's great because they don't have to compete with their past.

So, to buy a recording and expect hi-def DVD recording AND original band members is a bit absurd.The band, reconstituted several times over the years, is great.  The vocals are now handled by no less than 3 lead singers; somehow, the singer chosen for each song seems to be perfect and seems to be like the original.  The brass section is a bit rough and surprisingly is not up to the vocal quality level.If you're a Chicago fan like me and wanted to see a live production on stage of their hits, this is as good a recording as you will find.  The brass section is adequate, vocals are surprisingly true to the original, and the only thing lacking is vocal harmony.

776054,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B0000CEB61,Carter,"[1, 1]","There are quite a few reviews of this concert and widely varying opinions.  You have to put Chicago in proper perspective though to give the band and this DVD a fair shake.  This is no longer a band that generates new hits and they don't pretend to be.  Their continued popularity owes more to the enduring melodies and powerful sound of the hits they wrote and the generous number of them.  That devoted fans attend their live performances year after year in the U.S. and abroad is testimony to just how timeless many of the songs are and how personable the band members remain.  That said, and contrary to some of the criticisms made, I think the sound of this recording is remarkable.  You can hear every blow from the horns, every note from the base, and every beat from the drum rolls.  Add to that a beautiful stage design, great lighting and filming, the intimacy of a small venue, and handsome graphics.  What the heck more do you want?  I've seen this group live and can attest that, as a musical experience and engineering accomplishment, the DVD is better.  Yes, Champlin looks like he needs an ex-lax every time he sings.  And Scheff mangles the lyrics on (of all songs) ""Dialogue.""  But these are the dysfunctions that family members overlook, and these guys really are family.

I've owned it for several years, and was in the mood for some Chicago last night, so I popped it in again.  First of all..........like several others who have commented here, I'm a musician.  I've played drums for 44 years and have been in a number of bands, including professional gigs.  I've played some of Chicago's songs in local bands.  I also have a pretty good ear.The comments about the sound quality of this disc are correct.  The 5.1 mix is muddled, and the vocals are buried.  I have other concerts that are mixed in 5.1(including Chicago's Live at the Greek, with EWF....The Eagles Farewell One Concert from Melbourne, and others)that jump out of the speakers at you.  So....the mix on this DVD is sub-standard.For those of you who like Bill Champlin...to each his or her own, but I think his vocals suck.  He can't -- and shouldn't -- try to sing Terry Kath's songs.  My favorite of Chicago's many great tunes is 'Make Me Smile'; and Champlin absolutely butchers the song.As far as Jason Scheff's take on the Peter Cetera vocals....there's only one Cetera; Scheff does an admirable job of very tough parts.And guitarist Keith Howland does a fine job on 'If You Leave Me Now.'  The interviews with the band members between songs are insightful, although I agree with those who said that host Mark McKuen gets annoying.  He may be a longtime D.J, but he's NOT cool....and shouldn't try to be.So....my take on the performance is:  Decent song selection, picked from those who called in, sub-par sound mix...bad vocals from Champlin...but lively performance from the band, who I started listening to when they began in 1967.One added note to Chicago fans:  I saw them live at Riverend in Cincinnati two summers in a row -- 2008 and '09; Champlin is gone, and his replacement on the keys can sing Kath's parts!  Also.....an added thrill...my wife and I had front-row seats and got to shake hands with Jimmy Pankow and Walter Parazaider.  They're really regular guys.",3,"Not bad, but not their best.",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,2064,"['reviews', 'DVD', 'are', '2003', 'thought', ""'d"", 'add', 'fresh', 'perspective', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'mood', 'Chicago', 'last', 'night', 'popped', 'again', 'First', 'several', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'commented', 'here', ""'m"", 'musician', ""'ve"", 'played', 'drums', '44', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'bands', 'including', 'professional', 'gigs', ""'ve"", 'played', 'Chicago', 'songs', 'local', 'bands', 'also', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'ear.The', 'comments', 'sound', 'quality', 'disc', 'are', 'correct', '5.1', 'mix', 'muddled', 'vocals', 'are', 'buried', 'have', 'other', 'concerts', 'are', 'mixed', '5.1', 'including', 'Chicago', 'Live', 'Greek', 'EWF', '.The', 'Eagles', 'Farewell', 'One', 'Concert', 'Melbourne', 'others', 'jump', 'speakers', 'So', '.the', 'mix', 'DVD', 'sub-standard.For', 'who', 'like', 'Bill', 'Champlin', 'own', 'think', 'vocals', 'suck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'sing', 'Terry', 'Kath', 'songs', 'favorite', 'Chicago', 'many', 'great', 'tunes', 'Me', 'Smile', 'Champlin', 'absolutely', 'song.As', 'far', 'Jason', 'Scheff', 'take', 'Peter', 'Cetera', 'vocals', 'only', 'one', 'Cetera', 'Scheff', 'admirable', 'job', 'very', 'tough', 'parts.And', 'guitarist', 'Keith', 'Howland', 'fine', 'job', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Now', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'songs', 'are', 'insightful', 'agree', 'who', 'said', 'host', 'Mark', 'McKuen', 'annoying', 'may', 'be', 'longtime', 'D.J', 'NOT', 'cool', '.and', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'be.So', 'take', 'performance', 'Decent', 'song', 'selection', 'picked', 'who', 'called', 'sub-par', 'sound', 'mix', 'bad', 'vocals', 'Champlin', 'lively', 'performance', 'band', 'who', 'started', 'listening', 'when', 'began', '1967.One', 'added', 'note', 'Chicago', 'fans', 'saw', 'live', 'Riverend', 'Cincinnati', 'two', 'summers', 'row', '2008', 'Champlin', 'gone', 'replacement', 'keys', 'can', 'sing', 'Kath', 'parts', 'Also', '..an', 'added', 'thrill', 'wife', 'had', 'front-row', 'seats', 'got', 'shake', 'hands', 'Jimmy', 'Pankow', 'Walter', 'Parazaider', ""'re"", 'really', 'regular', 'guys']",N/A

One fan called in a song from Chicago IV called &quot;In Terms of Two&quot;, but the request was ignored and &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; was played instead.  I had hoped to hear some deep album cuts, but no such luck.  Additionally, it is worth noting that the band has never played a Terry Kath (deceased guitarist/vocalist)song in concert since he died.  Kath songs were not usually singles, but Chicago has ignored some great songs.  Chicago would be well advised to disband until such time as Peter Cetera is interested in returning and they need to ask drummer Danny Seraphine back.  The new drummer Tris Imboden is a good studio player, but just not in the same league as Seraphine.  Seraphone was world class and they kicked him out of the band after 23 years over business disputes.  Plus, Chicago has not put out a new album of original material since 1990.

Nevertheless, when it comes to some performers, they don't fake it at all, and Chicago is truly one of them. For over 35 years, they've made so many songs that absolutely spoke the minds of all kinds of people. It is just amazing to see them on stage, that you have to taste it, and see it for yourself. You can see anywhere they perform, or on video.Chicago: Live By Request, was a live performance the band showcased on stage in 2002, a few days before the first anniversary of 9/11. The band celebrated the triumph of Chicago's Only The Beginning. No matter what the promotion, the band still continued to make it happen. Ironically, Live By Request was the A&amp;E performance show that Chicago performed on. In fact, they were the most requested performers for the show. They performed so many unbelieveable hit songs like Free, You're The Inspiration, and Old Days. The mood was absolutely unbelieveable that night. Ironically, A&amp;E had technical problems when it came up, they actually had to put an extra set of songs after the telecast, to make-up the loss. Although they don't highlight any of the three new tracks from The Box, they highlight a lot of great songs like Beginnings, Saturday In The Park, and Look Away.I just can't believe that they still've made it happen after all these years.

I'm so glad that I kept my 'belief' on this great band, and decided to give it a try.After a long day of work, I was not hesitant again--to play this one prior to the other two, and among several 'By Request' DVDs I own, this one is undoubtedly the champ.These guys are fantastic, they are aging, but aging like red wine.  Listening to track 21 (song 11) 'Color My World's just like rediscovering something you have long forgotten, your youth, your loved ones in the past, you also remind yourself to treausre your family and frends, and to love them as much as you can 'today'--it's intersting that Jimmy Pankow who composed this song does not play it, and the song was influenced/inspired by Bach.After I finished watching the whole DVD (93 min. + 10 bonus), I took out their laser disc, a Japanes version called 'And the Band Played On--Live at Pine Knob, Detroit, Michigan 1992', which was 10 years before this DVD concert.  Comparing the two concerts, the guys are aging, but they sound much much better, especially Robert Lamm, who doesn't only sound better, he looks more mature and good-looking than 10 years ago.Peter Cetera is an excellent singer, but the performance by the other guys has outweighted the importance of his presence.If I could give this DVD 6 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.Thank you, Robert and the other guys, and God bless you all!",5,"Amazing, Awesome, Fantastic, Marvellous.",1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,1529,"['went', 'music', 'store', 'afternoon', 'planned', 'buy', 'other', 'DVDs', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'two', 'bad', 'review', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'kept', ""'belief"", 'great', 'band', 'decided', 'give', 'try.After', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'hesitant', 'again', 'play', 'one', 'prior', 'other', 'two', 'several', ""'By"", 'Request', 'DVDs', 'own', 'one', 'undoubtedly', 'champ.These', 'guys', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'aging', 'aging', 'red', 'wine', 'Listening', 'track', '21', 'song', '11', 'My', 'World', 'just', 'rediscovering', 'something', 'have', 'long', 'forgotten', 'youth', 'loved', 'ones', 'past', 'also', 'remind', 'treausre', 'family', 'frends', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'can', ""'today"", 'intersting', 'Jimmy', 'Pankow', 'who', 'composed', 'song', 'not', 'play', 'song', 'was', 'influenced/inspired', 'Bach.After', 'finished', 'watching', 'whole', 'DVD', '93', 'min', '10', 'bonus', 'took', 'out', 'laser', 'disc', 'Japanes', 'version', 'called', ""'And"", 'Band', 'Played', 'Live', 'Pine', 'Knob', 'Detroit', 'Michigan', '1992', 'was', '10', 'years', 'DVD', 'concert', 'Comparing', 'two', 'concerts', 'guys', 'are', 'aging', 'sound', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Lamm', 'who', ""n't"", 'only', 'sound', 'better', 'more', 'mature', 'good-looking', '10', 'years', 'ago.Peter', 'Cetera', 'excellent', 'singer', 'performance', 'other', 'guys', 'outweighted', 'importance', 'presence.If', 'could', 'give', 'DVD', '6', 'stars', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'do', 'so.Thank', 'Robert', 'other', 'guys', 'God', 'bless']",N/A

I admit the requests were at times annoying and of course the tributes by Dick Clark and Jay Leno, David Letterman, Sopranos and of course the annoying MCing by Marc McEwen. Besides the negatives Chicago performs nicely and really show why they lasted all these years. Jason Scheff does an adequate job singing Peter Cetera songs, I wish reviews about Scheffs singing performance on this dvd were'nt so harsh. Chicago did thier best to replace Peter Cetera, but it is hard to replace a legend like Peter Cetera. Jim Pankow and Walter Parazaider do not even mention Peter Cetera or Danny Seraphine during thier interviews with McEwen. I guess Cetera and Seraphine have bad blood with Chicago. I wish they would work out thier differences and perform together or make a new cd, wishful thinking. Terry Kath was mentioned an that was a beautiful thing , especially when Walter Parazaider talks about the story of meeting Jimi Hendrix and how Hendrix said Kath was a better gutarist than he was. This dvd watched on your regular tv will sound like Chicago performing in a fish tank. You need to watch it with a theatre system, this dvd was ment to be heard on a 5.1 theatre system, that is why Chicagos performance sounds like it is enclosed in a fish tank when watching it on a regular tv.

At first I thought that it was nit-picking by sound fanatics or engineers, but when I put this on the DVD player, I was astounded at the horrible mixing of sound that was in the DVD.  The bass was pumped up heavily (I had to bring down overall bass in my receiver), the drums were nice and present, the piano was barely there, the brass would be &quot;in and out&quot; (which is what I love about Chicago!  I couldn't hear the brass clearly) and the voices couldn't be heard (can you believe that?  THE VOICES!).  I took the DVD to a recording engineer friend's house who has a more modern sound system with digital DTS and 7 recording studio quality speakers to listen to the DVD there.  Same problems.  The problem wasn't my system, it was the DVD's sound mix.  I'm very disappointed with Chicago.  This is the only DVD that I can find of them and its sound is horrible.  I can't believe none of the members listened to this DVD and told the engineer to go back into the studio and re-mix.  If you want to see the band, the DVD is great, but if you want to HEAR the band, skip it.

I've seen some of their live documentaries post Chicago 17 and I have to admit that I hate them all. Especially at Jason Scheff (replaced Peter Cetera since Chicago 18 (1987)) which voice character IMHO didn't fit Cetera's parts. Luckily on Live By Request he only lead on several songs. Cetera's trademark on If You Leave Me Now and Old Days were handled by their latest guitarist, Keith Howland. This new dude did better than Jason. However, Jason's bass playing's getting better. I love his bass style.The brass section was always good as I remember. I love their jokes and they really enjoyed receiving every phonecalls. Robert Lamm seemed ok, although it looked like his mood was somewhere else. He's acting nice but not as enthusiastic as the other original members. But his singing and piano playing were always good as always. The drummer, Tris Imboden, was very energetic. He's a valuable asset for the band. As for Bill Champlin, the camera and sound didn't much exploit him. Perhaps his keyboard only blocked Lamm's parts. He also seemed difficult on hitting some notes. Perhaps because of the age.Overall it was an incredible performance. Although not as explosive as Earth Wind &amp; Fire, who also had their Live By Request some years before. The songs requested by fans were also great. Some unexpected songs they requested. At least I didn't recall Chicago ever played those songs recently (Old Days, Feeling Stronger Everyday). Too bad nobody requested my favourite, Byblos. Anyway, only Terry Kath could play the song perfectly.Just after the show ended, I realize how I missed Peter Cetera so much.
