When DVDs came out, I looked and even wrote snail mail letters to HBO, never hearing back. After GOOGLE came along, I only found others also searching. Then finally, my search said Amazon had it! I bought it and eagerly waited. I had built it up so much, I wondered if it would still be as terrific as I remembered, and it WAS! Sure it looks like the 80's! It was, and that just adds to the hilarity. Some will find Buddy's words offensive (that is even part of the performance) but this is classic Buddy Hackett and it is so funny, I cry laughing, every time.",5,Finally!,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,688,"['recorded', 'onto', 'VHS', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'HBO', 'playing', '30', 'years', 'sadly', 'made', 'video', 'quality', 'unbearable', 'When', 'DVDs', 'came', 'out', 'looked', 'even', 'wrote', 'snail', 'mail', 'letters', 'HBO', 'never', 'hearing', 'back', 'GOOGLE', 'came', 'along', 'only', 'found', 'others', 'also', 'searching', 'Then', 'finally', 'search', 'said', 'Amazon', 'had', 'bought', 'eagerly', 'waited', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'wondered', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'as', 'terrific', 'remembered', 'WAS', 'Sure', '80', 'was', 'just', 'hilarity', 'will', 'find', 'Buddy', 'words', 'offensive', 'even', 'part', 'performance', 'classic', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'so', 'funny', 'cry', 'laughing', 'time']","Buddy Hackett 2 Live and Uncensored At Caesar's, Atlantic City DVD (2012)"
