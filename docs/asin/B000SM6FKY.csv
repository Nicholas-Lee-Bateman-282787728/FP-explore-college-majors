1086819,A1TUZL12O7X1A9,B000SM6FKY,Alexander G.,"[1, 1]","The Condemned is one of those movies that you know right off the bat is made for one specific type of audience. If you like reading Jane Austin novels and sunsets and walks along the beach and romantic movies then this movie may not be for you. This is all out balls to the wall action movie that does not apologize for what it is. Premise is a reality series producer is putting together the ultimate survivor series on the internet. He picks ten people from the worst prisons around the world and buys them from death row and attaches a bomb to their ankles. The Bomb will go off in 24 hours the catch is simple only one can win. It's a fight to the death the prize is you get your life your freedom and a big bankroll. Trapped amongst the sadistic killers is Jack Conrad (Steve Austin) a former Navy S.E.A.L. who was recruited to do black ops types of jobs his last one went bad and he was caught in El Salvador awaiting death. All Conrad wants to do is get out of this alive and go home to his girl. But Conrad is decent man with Honor and a code of principles that will not let him take part in this sadistic game so he tries his best to survive and get help. Steve Austin does a good job in his first film As lead actor and he's gone on to make better films since his role in the EXPENDABLES is much better and you can see Austin has grown as a actor, This movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of this type of action flick.

1086821,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000SM6FKY,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[0, 1]","The Condemned is another attempt by the WWE's film producing unit to come up with a big-screen vehicle for one of its major wrestling personalities. John Cena already did his time (and not in a good way) with the laughable and unwatchable The Marine. Now WWE hoped to have better luck with The Condemned starring the Texas Rattlesnake himself, Stone Cold Steve Austin.The basic plot of the movie has some hotshot tv producer set to begin an ultraviolent reality show on the internet. The show's premise of taking ten condemned prisoners from around the globe and dropping them in the middle of a South Pacific island to fight it out for their eventual freedom is avoided like the plague by the other networks. Ronert Mammone plays the producer Ian Breckel with an over-the-top, mustache twirling performance that to say he wasn't subtle would be an understatement. Really the whole cast in the film barely register on the screen. The pace of the movie keeps dialogue to a minimum which is a blessing. The movie stands on the shoulders of the charismatic Steve Austin who actually looks like he could lay the smackdown on everyone on the screen for real. While his acting skills is quite basic there's not much more needed for him to really do. He just had to kick ass and not look cartoonish while doing it. In that respect he succeeds.The story on the other hand could've been better handled. While The Condemned brings nothing to the table that Battle Royale and Most Dangerous Game hasn't already done it does bring the whole reality-tv concept into the mix. This movie could've become one of those little B-movie gems which has over-the-top action with just enough smarts to keep it from Mystery Science Theater 3000 level. It doesn't reach that level. For a movie about a fight to the death between the worst of the worst from prisons around the world there's way too little action. The filmmakers could easily have dropped all pretenses of trying to make a point about the effects and role of violence in the media and the movie would've been way better in the end.So, while The Condemned was an average-to-good piece of pulp it could've been better if it actually concentrated on the deathmatch scenario introduced as the plot of the movie. I know this for sure and that it is ten times better than John Cena's The Marine.",3,It could've been better instead it's barely topping the level of average,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2329,"['Condemned', 'attempt', 'WWE', 'film', 'producing', 'unit', 'come', 'up', 'big-screen', 'vehicle', 'one', 'major', 'wrestling', 'personalities', 'John', 'Cena', 'already', 'did', 'time', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'laughable', 'unwatchable', 'Marine', 'Now', 'WWE', 'hoped', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'Condemned', 'starring', 'Texas', 'Rattlesnake', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'hotshot', 'tv', 'producer', 'set', 'begin', 'ultraviolent', 'reality', 'show', 'internet', 'show', 'premise', 'taking', 'ten', 'condemned', 'prisoners', 'globe', 'dropping', 'middle', 'South', 'Pacific', 'island', 'fight', 'out', 'eventual', 'freedom', 'avoided', 'plague', 'other', 'networks', 'Ronert', 'Mammone', 'producer', 'Ian', 'Breckel', 'over-the-top', 'mustache', 'twirling', 'performance', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'Really', 'whole', 'cast', 'film', 'barely', 'register', 'screen', 'pace', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'minimum', 'blessing', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'charismatic', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'who', 'actually', 'could', 'lay', 'smackdown', 'everyone', 'screen', 'real', 'acting', 'skills', 'quite', 'basic', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'needed', 'really', 'do', 'just', 'had', 'kick', 'ass', 'not', 'look', 'cartoonish', 'doing', 'respect', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'handled', 'Condemned', 'brings', 'nothing', 'table', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', ""n't"", 'already', 'done', 'bring', 'whole', 'reality-tv', 'concept', 'mix', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'become', 'one', 'little', 'B-movie', 'gems', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'just', 'enough', 'smarts', 'keep', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'level', ""n't"", 'reach', 'level', 'movie', 'fight', 'death', 'worst', 'worst', 'prisons', 'world', 'way', 'too', 'little', 'action', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'dropped', 'pretenses', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'effects', 'role', 'violence', 'media', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'way', 'better', 'end.So', 'Condemned', 'was', 'average-to-good', 'piece', 'pulp', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'actually', 'concentrated', 'deathmatch', 'scenario', 'introduced', 'plot', 'movie', 'know', 'sure', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'John', 'Cena', 'Marine']",The Condemned
1086822,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000SM6FKY,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[4, 7]","""The Condemned"", a co-production of the WWE and Lionsgate Films, is the kind of B-movie fodder reminiscent of made-for-cable action flicks of a decade ago, with a bit more gore and graphic language. While wrestling fans may get a kick out of seeing Steve Austin out of the ring, the film is routine, at best, with lapses of logic that will have you scratching your head.The concept is simple; 10 'Death Row' inmates from Third World jails are sold to an unscrupulous producer, who drops them onto an island filled with hidden cameras, and offers freedom to the last convict alive, after 30 hours, while he broadcasts the mayhem over the Internet. To make things more interesting, he attaches bombs to the leg of each contestant, which will blow up if tampered with, or at the end of the 30 hours, if the 'game' isn't over (so why didn't these bombs explode when the inmates were tossed off helicopters onto the island? Don't ask!)While the movie lacks humor, the DVD's Special Features more than make up for it, if unintentionally! Watching writers Rob and Andy Hedden claim, with straight faces, that the entire concept of the film sprang from watching 'Reality TV' shows, when key elements were 'lifted' from Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 ""The Running Man"", as well as the oft-filmed ""The Most Dangerous Game"", may bring a chuckle, as will director Scott Wiper's proud assertion that he hired 'real' actors, training them to fight, to increase the film's 'believability' (he WAS kidding, right?)Steve Austin is no great shakes as an actor, but with his size, bull neck and craggy features, he does project a kind of taciturn integrity; the real acting honors go to veteran screen baddie Vinnie Jones, whose sneering, over-the-top performance overshadows the rest of the cast.""The Condemned"" is a time-passer, at best; if you're not a wrestling fan, you may prefer to skip it!",2,"Stone Cold Steve Austin Fans, Rejoice; Others, Beware!",1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,1876,"['Condemned', 'co-production', 'WWE', 'Lionsgate', 'Films', 'kind', 'B-movie', 'fodder', 'reminiscent', 'made-for-cable', 'action', 'flicks', 'decade', 'ago', 'bit', 'more', 'gore', 'graphic', 'language', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'may', 'get', 'kick', 'seeing', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'ring', 'film', 'routine', 'best', 'lapses', 'logic', 'will', 'have', 'scratching', 'head.The', 'concept', 'simple', '10', 'Row', 'inmates', 'Third', 'World', 'jails', 'are', 'sold', 'unscrupulous', 'producer', 'who', 'island', 'filled', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'freedom', 'last', 'convict', 'alive', '30', 'hours', 'mayhem', 'Internet', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'interesting', 'bombs', 'leg', 'contestant', 'will', 'blow', 'up', 'tampered', 'end', '30', 'hours', ""'game"", ""n't"", 'so', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bombs', 'explode', 'when', 'inmates', 'were', 'tossed', 'off', 'helicopters', 'island', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'movie', 'humor', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'unintentionally', 'Watching', 'writers', 'Rob', 'Andy', 'Hedden', 'claim', 'straight', 'entire', 'concept', 'film', 'sprang', 'watching', ""'Reality"", 'TV', 'shows', 'when', 'key', 'elements', 'were', ""'lifted"", 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', '1987', 'Running', 'Man', 'as', 'well', 'oft-filmed', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'may', 'bring', 'chuckle', 'will', 'director', 'Scott', 'Wiper', 'proud', 'assertion', 'hired', ""'real"", 'actors', 'training', 'fight', 'increase', 'film', ""'believability"", 'WAS', 'kidding', 'right', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'great', 'shakes', 'actor', 'size', 'bull', 'neck', 'craggy', 'features', 'project', 'kind', 'taciturn', 'integrity', 'real', 'acting', 'honors', 'go', 'veteran', 'screen', 'baddie', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'sneering', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'Condemned', 'time-passer', 'best', ""'re"", 'not', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'may', 'prefer', 'skip']",The Condemned

With these faults this film still has many plus points that make it one of the best WWE films to date. (Of the 3)The story places Jack Riley, an ex special forces operative is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and winds up on death row. A multi millionaire is ready to give him his break as he has a concept to place 10 Death Row convicts on an Island and let them loose on each other. They are told that there must only be one man left standing after the 30 hour time limit, or they all die. The last man standing is given his freedom and Breckel, the man with the concept will capitalise off the millions of internet subscribers who want to watch a live death tournament.Jack Riley after being missing for over a year is seen by one of his old school friends and the FBI inform his wife, Sarah Cavanaugh. The only thing she can do is wait and watch and hope he wins the tournament because there's only one way out and that's to kill.Along with this being a WWE film I have to say Austin was the perfect person for the lead character. He's tough, he's got an attitude and he fears nothing. For those fans of the wrestling world they will say the pure depiction of such a personality is Austin. For those who aren't familiar with Steve Austin within the wrestling world you will still come to appreciate how much of an intimidating character Steve Austin can portray. Vinnie Jones is something special as well and presents something that can be quite scary and at times make it awkward to watch.This is a pretty mindless action movie but that's something that can gain an appreciation on its own.

1086833,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000SM6FKY,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[0, 0]","""The Condemned"" may be one of the better movies produced by the film arm of World Wrestling Entertainment, but that's not much of a compliment.After all, this rather brutal thriller's competition in that regard includes such duds as last year's duo of ""See No Evil"" and ""The Marine."" And to be honest, it barely surpasses them, thanks to a nasty mean streak toward its female characters -- a real no-no that prevents it from being simple, dumb fun.Former WWE wrestler ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin stars as Jack Conrad, one of 10 international, death-row inmates that have been shipped to a remote island to participate in a Web-exclusive ""reality"" program.Jack and the others have bombs strapped to their ankles, which are set to go off in 30 hours. The only way for him to stop the bomb -- and possibly gain his freedom -- is to kill the others.It's not a horrible setup, even if it is reminiscent of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and other like-minded thrillers. But the film's accusatory tone is somewhat ridiculous (the sleazy show producer character, played by Robert Mammone, is clearly a swipe directed at sometimes controversial ""Survivor"" producer Rob Burnett).Also, co-screenwriter/director Scott Wiper had his crews shoot most of the combat scenes in herky-jerky, ""jitter-cam"" style, which renders most of them incomprehensible.That may be for the best, though, since this isn't the brainiest material (again, despite the misplaced screeds against reality television).However, Austin does have an imposing physical presence and doesn't embarrass himself by overemoting (he really doesn't try to do much more than glare and occasionally utter wisecracks). But former soccer player Vinnie Jones outdoes him as one of the film's eminently hateful villains.Quick summary: ""The Condemned"" is rated R (In America, a 15 rating in the UK, no Ireland rating announced yet) for strong scenes of violent action (beatings, stabbings, shootings, vehicular and explosive mayhem, and violence against women, some of it sexual), strong sexual language (profanity and crude slang), gore, crude humor, racial epithets and slurs based on ethnicity or nationality and brief drug references.

1086835,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000SM6FKY,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[2, 3]","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be simple, straight-out, violent no-brains suspense and fight action.  Things get off on that note, and within 30 minutes of the nearly 2 hour film, the action begins.  I began to ask myself, how can this all out action keep on for nearly another 90 minutes?  I soon discovered the answer when the film begin to expand its direction with its story, protesting the violence it was glamorizing.  While I found myself interested in where this concept was going, i just found myself more confused to exactly what it is I am supposed to be watching.  The violence felt to glamorized to follow the ideals that this is wrong, but those some ideals kept the movie from being a simple for fun action feast.I would like to praise Austin on his performance in this film, but its hard to critique when there isn't much to go off of.  He did not receive the most screen time in this film, and the dialouge he had was kept fairly minimal.  The Condemned focused more on Vinnie Jones - the one man that predictably is going to become Austin's nemesis.  In fact, Jones arguably steals the show making a much stronger presence in his villainous role.Above all else I wanted good action and suspense with this film.  Overall, the action felt average.  The fights are brutal, bloody, and pack a punch.  The camera ruined several good fights with its over abundance of shaking and viewing angles zoomed in too far.  The editing is also extensive.  I did like that not all the fights were the same.  Some involved weapons at the fighters disposal, and others revolved around the surrounding landscape of the island, which varied from beaches to the forest and even waterfalls.  But because the point was expressed about the violence being sickening, it quickly changed the feel of the movie, making good ol fun fights history.  Then you have a few near-rape scenes on the women, which is never fun to watch.Overall, this is well made for what it is, but its hard to determine how to watch this.  Perhaps this is one of those films where no story involvement and just straight out action would have been better.  At least the point is made that violence really is sickening, though its confusing to grasp in this given form of entertainment.Acting - 3.5Action - 4Characters - 3.5Story - 3Overall - 3.5",3,[3.5] This movie can't decide what it wants to be,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,2327,"['went', 'movie', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'simple', 'straight-out', 'violent', 'no-brains', 'suspense', 'fight', 'action', 'Things', 'get', 'off', 'note', '30', 'minutes', 'nearly', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'action', 'began', 'ask', 'how', 'can', 'out', 'action', 'keep', 'nearly', '90', 'minutes', 'soon', 'discovered', 'answer', 'when', 'film', 'begin', 'expand', 'direction', 'story', 'protesting', 'violence', 'was', 'glamorizing', 'found', 'interested', 'where', 'concept', 'was', 'going', 'i', 'just', 'found', 'more', 'confused', 'exactly', 'what', 'am', 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'violence', 'felt', 'glamorized', 'follow', 'ideals', 'wrong', 'ideals', 'kept', 'movie', 'being', 'simple', 'fun', 'action', 'feast.I', 'would', 'like', 'praise', 'Austin', 'performance', 'film', 'hard', 'critique', 'when', ""n't"", 'much', 'go', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'dialouge', 'had', 'was', 'kept', 'fairly', 'minimal', 'Condemned', 'focused', 'more', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'one', 'man', 'predictably', 'going', 'become', 'Austin', 'nemesis', 'fact', 'Jones', 'arguably', 'show', 'making', 'much', 'stronger', 'presence', 'villainous', 'role.Above', 'else', 'wanted', 'good', 'action', 'suspense', 'film', 'Overall', 'action', 'felt', 'average', 'fights', 'are', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'pack', 'punch', 'camera', 'ruined', 'several', 'good', 'fights', 'abundance', 'shaking', 'viewing', 'angles', 'zoomed', 'too', 'far', 'editing', 'also', 'extensive', 'did', 'like', 'not', 'fights', 'were', 'same', 'involved', 'weapons', 'fighters', 'disposal', 'others', 'revolved', 'surrounding', 'landscape', 'island', 'varied', 'beaches', 'forest', 'even', 'waterfalls', 'point', 'was', 'expressed', 'violence', 'being', 'sickening', 'quickly', 'changed', 'feel', 'movie', 'making', 'good', 'ol', 'fun', 'fights', 'history', 'Then', 'have', 'few', 'near-rape', 'scenes', 'women', 'never', 'fun', 'watch.Overall', 'well', 'made', 'what', 'hard', 'determine', 'how', 'watch', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'story', 'involvement', 'just', 'straight', 'out', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'least', 'point', 'made', 'violence', 'really', 'sickening', 'confusing', 'grasp', 'given', 'form', 'entertainment.Acting', '3.5Action', '4Characters', '3.5Story', '3Overall', '3.5']",The Condemned

Where Ice T and Rutger Hauer failed with ""Surviving the Game"", this movie takes off and excels.An eccentric tv producer who has been shunned by the rest of the industry puts together this deathmatch, and he plans on making a lucrative profit by broadcasting it over the web, charging everyone for entry.  It's a 24-hour a day hunting channel, reality show, and sporting match.Stone Cold Steve Austin plays an American Special Forces soldier who has to use all his skill, training, and wits to survive against some of the most insane murderers and pathological killers on the planet. Unfortunately, during a mission in a foreign country, he was imprisoned.  How unfortunate...""The Condemned"" taps into raw emotion, as 10 condemned prisoners from various, vile prisons around the worldd, are purchased with the intention of their unwilling entry into a life or death struggle.  The game is simple: be the last prisoner alive, and get set free.  All others die.  In an interesting twist, another Rutger Hauer movie is tapped into (Deadlock), as each prisoner on the island has explosives strapped to their ankles.  In a short period of time, the explosive device will detonate, and the only way to get it off is to win the competition.The drama and action build as prisoners die one by one, leaving only the strongest to do battle.

It only makes sense that ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin would get his own action vehicle.  If WWE films was going to put premier wrestlers John Cena in an action movie and ""Kane"" in a horror flick, then why not put one of your most famous wrestlers in a no holds barred brawl of a movie Steve Austin does bring new meaning to term ""gravity."" With a neck as thick as his skull and two eyes that glower menacingly from beneath a shaved head, he not only looks like a stripped tree trunk, in the new action adventure The Condemned, he seems like he might topple from the screen onto the front row at any second.The Condemned follows the story of a millionaire megalomaniac who decides to take death row inmates from various prisons around the world and pit them against each other in a battle to the death.  He winner gets his freedom.  The world gets to watch the action over the internet.  Unbeknownst to the producers, one of the contestants is wrongfully imprisoned special-forces soldier Joe Conrad (played by Austin).Every once in a while we all need a film that doesn't promise high art, or any kind of art for that matter.  It is always nice to turn off your brain and watch guys beat the crap out of each other on film.  No pretense at all, just pure violent, fun.  At first glance that is exactly what you get in this film. Sadly though, the film unravels on itself.  During the making of the film, it seems that the cameraman had an epileptic fit every time he had to shoot any kind of fight scene.  You would expect a film about men killing each other would be more violent.  Several of the completely painful subplots defiled such a simple premise as ""ten men enter, one man leaves"".  The director seems to be under the impression that watching Vinnie Jones beat up someone else is only worth watching in quick cut edits, and Stone Cold Steve Austin's bests fighting moves involve a leg lock and sleeper hold.In a film that actually promotes the idea of people killing each other and really nothing more, it seems imperative to me that there should be lots of bloodshed.  The creators of the film came up with an idea to limit the actual amount of blood.  This should have been creative but instead seems to water down what action there is in the film.  Between fight scenes, we get the pleasure of watching one dimensional characters fight about whether or not it is morally reprehensible to watch convicted felons kill each other, as they watch morally reprehensible people kill each other.""The Condemned"" may not be a total disappointment as long as you know that instead of an action packed fight to the death is a generic action flick and enough awkward moments to make any enjoyable action secondary.

It's better made than the Marine and more watchable as well despite how violent and heartless it can be. Stone Cold carries this movie just as good as the Rock plus un-like the Rock I doubt Stone Cold would ever do a Disney film....thank god.Stone Cold shows some ability here, I'd rather see more of him on screen than Cena.

But it surprised me. Robert Mammone, as the tycoon sponsoring this internet viewing only battle royal to the death, has solid acting chops along with the always interesting to watch Rick Hoffman. Of the group of combatants, Manu Bennet and Dasi Ruz show real chemistry and Vinnie Jones is always believable as a murderous bastard.Okay, the premise is simple as any action movie tends to be whether it's escaping aliens (""Predator,"" ""Alien"") or stopping the thing that will end the world (""The Rock,"" ""Armagedon""). A rich, pompous, self absorbed tycoon buys convicted criminals from jails around the world, brings them to a small island and offers them freedom if they're the last one alive after 30 hours while he broadcasts on the internet for $49.95. To their ankle is strapped an explosive device that will trigger if they try to remove it.What makes a story interesting is it's execution from casting, directing, cinematography, dialogue, etc. Every romance story is the same boy meets, girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl reunite in the end. Director Scott Wiper knows he's not making a Merchant Ivory film and so focuses on the compelling fight sequences, the question of who will be left, and how they are eliminated.Now, I've read critiques about Austin's acting and I don't think these viewers get it. As the director states in the commentary, Austin, like other action heroes before him, has the confidence to do nothing. His range is limited and it plays to his advantage. Looking back on the Schwarzenegger Stallone era, does anybody remember them acting other than cool under fire? Clint Eastwood made a career out of squinting and teeth gritting. Look at your rappers supposedly turned ""actors"" like Ice-T, DMX, LL Cool J. Their entire range consists of going from snotty to snottier and back again. So Austin playing it tight and close only works for him and the role. He's the hero and viewers expect certain behavior from them. Other characters are used to portray the emotions of danger, fear and sadness that help us read the severity of the situation.Now as far as the commentary on reality shows and internet viewership, and the lust for violence I'll leave it to the sociologists and more scholarly journals.

Wish I'd seen that before I watched this piece of manipulative garbage (somewhat well-made and semi-convincing garbage, which only heightens the disgust). It ends with some weak diatribes about how we the viewers are really The Condemned, not the death row prisoners who are killing each other on the deserted island. What a joke that is.This movie absolutely glories in showing every bit of blood and bullets and knives ripping through flesh and even a long, drawn-out rape scene; it pretends to be judging the makers of reality shows, but in reality it's the makers of this movie who use this premise to create what is really just a totally sleazy piece of violence pornography.I don't mind violence if it means something useful, as in Fight Club, The Godfather, and some other films. But here it's just porn, period. And then to fatuously attach a moral at the end saying, watching sick violence is wrong? Well, what does that make the creators of this film filled with sick violence?EVERYBODY dies in this snuff-fest, except our hero, of course. As in The Shooter and so many other recent films, our hero is an ex-American military secret service guy pulled back into the fray (message: our government is run by bad guys, but there are lots of other good guys with endless weapons who fight for Good and Honor and Justice, so join the military now). Towards the end, when Vinnie starts killing everyone in sight, I actually felt queasy upon realizing that there really is no point to this film except to glamorize death via violence and rage. I felt used; there was nothing approaching any sort of redemption.I don't know what I expected; someone whose taste I thought was ok recommended it. Lesson learned. I expected something more wrestling/cartoonish; nothing cartoonish here except the level of thought. Apparently WWE thinks its audience needs this kind of pornography; it's a sad thought.Do NOT let your kids or anyone you love watch this. It will only plant nasty, brutal images and thoughts in their head, with nothing positive to add. But then, I guess a lot of hollywood movies are just ads for the glory of violence. How else can we convince a whole nation to let their tax dollars be used for killing strangers day in and day out?

Meanwhile back in Texas where Jack lives, all of his friends and his wife are watching on the computer...what is weird about this is that Jack's wife or kids have not made contact with jack in forever , not knowing of him being arrested. she knew something was wrong right away because the description of jack said that he was a KKK member and blew up a mental retardation hospital.... anyway she was watching when it looks like Jack gets killed. in the end Jack lives and wins the show and goes home to Texas.the only thing that was challenging for me was to follow the camera. it seemed like it was all over the place. but besides that minor setback this movie was great. watch it! 5 out of 5",5,"""game on"" great movie",1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,1687,"['heard', 'movie', 'buddy', 'mine', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'watch', 'went', 'out', 'bought', '3', 'bucks', 'couple', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'featured', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Manu', 'Bennett', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'movie', 'group', 'producers', 'make', 'illegal', 'TV', 'show', 'make', 'fighting', 'criminals', 'fight', 'thee', 'death', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'survive', 'whoever', 'get', 'prison', 'go', 'home', 'opinion', 'think', 'would', 'just', 'kill', 'winner', 'anyway', 'something', 'happens', 'clear', 'winner', 'actual', 'show', 'never', 'one', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'killing', 'everyone', 'found', 'way', 'home', 'own', 'help', 'illegal', 'film', 'producers', 'due', 'one', 'prisoners', 'basically', 'slaughtering', 'main', 'producer', 'was', 'down', 'jack', 'stone', 'cold', 'other', 'survivor', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'Texas', 'where', 'Jack', 'friends', 'wife', 'are', 'watching', 'computer', 'what', 'weird', 'Jack', 'wife', 'kids', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'contact', 'jack', 'forever', 'not', 'knowing', 'being', 'arrested', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'right', 'away', 'description', 'jack', 'said', 'was', 'KKK', 'member', 'blew', 'up', 'mental', 'retardation', 'hospital', 'anyway', 'was', 'watching', 'when', 'Jack', 'killed', 'end', 'Jack', 'show', 'home', 'Texas.the', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'challenging', 'was', 'follow', 'camera', 'seemed', 'was', 'place', 'minor', 'setback', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'watch', '5', '5']",The Condemned

When I watch a fight scene I don't want it to be interrupted.-And I'll be honest here: There's a subplot that involves the protagonist having a wife back home, I fast forwarded through any scenes with her as I saw it as unnecessary filler.Now for the good:-Overall the fight scenes were amazing - this movie took itself seriously-There weren't ANY bad jokes are puns that ruined the movie-The movie just did a very good job as an all around action movie, it delivers a good action flick to the male audience",4,Worth it for the Action,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1287,"['had', 'mixed', 'expectations', 'move', 'saw', 'scenes', 'was', 'intrigued', 'effort', 'went', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Also', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Battle', 'Royal', 'famous', 'japans', 'movie', 'Condemned', 'mimics', 'films', 'discredit', 'last', 'WWE', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'Marine', 'thought', 'was', 'terrible', 'greatly', 'lowered', 'expectations.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'defiantly', 'pleased', 'overall', 'had', 'few', 'complaints', '-They', 'switch', 'angles', 'fight', 'scenes', 'too', 'much', 'angles', 'make', 'fighting', 'look', 'phony-there', 'was', ""n't"", 'climatic', 'final', 'showdown', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', '-The', 'last', 'antagonist', 'die', 'so', 'lame', 'corny', 'way-Its', 'annoying', 'how', 'movie', 'constantly', 'fight', 'scene', 'people', 'watching', 'fight', 'scene', 'When', 'watch', 'fight', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'interrupted.-And', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'subplot', 'protagonist', 'having', 'wife', 'back', 'home', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'scenes', 'saw', 'unnecessary', 'filler.Now', 'good', '-Overall', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'amazing', 'movie', 'took', 'seriously-There', 'were', ""n't"", 'ANY', 'bad', 'jokes', 'are', 'ruined', 'movie-The', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'action', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'male', 'audience']",The Condemned

You could be forgiven for assuming this movie is a propaganda vehicle for wrestlers looking to break into acting, with a plot that's no deeper than brawny men beating the tar out of each other. And you'd be right.But The Condemned has higher goals in mind.  It features an online game show in which dangerous convicts are purchased by a wealthy television producer (Robert Mammone as Breckel) for use as contestants. Each contestant has 30-hours to live before an ankle-bracelet explodes.  Additionally, a ripcord on the bracelet can trigger the bomb ten seconds later.  Ten people enter an island rigged with cameras and cameramen, one killer leaves.The Condemned divides its time between the killers offing each other, the technical team conducting the game show, and the FBI investigation trying to stop the madness. As each killer dies, the game show's website gets more and more hits.  The more violent the movie gets, the more the audience loves it.  The Condemned slyly begins blurring the lines between the audience watching the film and the audience in the movie.Conrad is actually an undercover Delta Force operative, of course, and sets out to prove he's bigger and badder than everyone else on the island. It's no easy task, however -- the villainous team-up of Ewan McStanley (Vinnie Jones) and Saiga (Masa Yamaguchi) set the bar low with rape and murder under their belts.It's the rape scene that proves a turning point for the producers and the film. The technical team begins having second thoughts about the show after that, and a rebellion of sorts breaks out, only to be brutally crushed by the usual tools of archvillainy - deceit, greed, and murder. By the time McStanley's in-game violence spills into the production studio, they've long since lost their grip on morality.The Condemned is an ugly film about ugly characters.  Its biggest flaw is that Conrad isn't particularly likable. The movie takes its premise too far.  There's nobody to really root for.  Midway through, The Condemned drastically changes tone from glorifying violence to soundly condemning it, which will likely turn a lot of wrestling fans off.

There's some surprisingly good action scenes to be found here, many of which feature Austin taking on other ""contestants"" on an island where one will be left alive.

The acting is dreadful, and the film as a whole is quite predictable, but you should already know what to expect from The Condemned in the first place.

This rich media mogul buys 10 death row prisoners from various countries and sets it up so that they have to fight to the death on a remote Pacific island.The purpose is to film it all and broadcast it on the net, for a $49.99 subscription fee, of course.The point of the movie is to say something about the human propensity towards not only violence, in everyone, but the voyeuristic enjoyment that we get out of just watching fighting. The point that watching and participating, sitting in a comfortable chair at a monitor and out in the real world dying and the bifurcation of our mental worlds into false-net-computer and RL and how our morality and instinctual settings just don't seem to function right in this brave new world of on line fighting/gambling/etc.Technically the movie is great, well filmed, absolutely beautiful. The actors, despite (or maybe because of) being WWE players are pretty good. The dialog flows much above average for fight movies, the writing is well above average for movies with violence and ku-fu type martial arts and lots of bloody pieces. Now it is not a slasher movie, not a horror movie (like it could have been), but a more genuine fight movie than most movies you'd put into this genre. How would an add read: ""adrenaline pumping, action packed, no holds barred vision of big mean nasty guys (and 2 ladies) whalloping on each other for your viewing pleasure"".And that is the big point. The movie is about filming a movie about violence. The on screen movie team(those supplying the net feed of the action) are on the island, they are voyeurs and eventually RL participants in the show. But the viewers of the movie, you and i on this side of the 4th wall are also voyeurs, watching not only the violence on the net feed, but the analogous violence of those who setup and participate in creating the show. A complex set of russian dolls, but the voyeur is in all of us, because we chose and watched this movie.It is an interesting point, the brutality is a bit much, i'm glad they were not specific about the rape scene.

We're supposed to believe, for instance, that any number of the world's leading prison officials would be willing to overturn the sentences of some of their most notorious death-row inmates just so they could be taken to some remote island and forced to participate in a kill-or-be-killed, last-man-standing reality show being broadcast live on the world wide web (think of it as a ""Survivor"" knockoff where teamwork and cooperation are decidedly NOT part of a winning strategy).Director Scott Wiper has begun by filling his tank with high-octane testosterone, then setting his vehicle on autopilot, subjecting the audience to one fight-to-the-death battle scene after another, with nary a time out for storyline or character development (the latter a sure-fire action-movie buzz-killer if ever there was one).  However, in order to generate some sympathy for the characters, the filmmakers are quick to point out that a number of the unwitting contestants aren't quite the irredeemable blackguards and bad guys we'd been led to believe they were at the outset.  This applies particularly to Steve Austin`s Jack Conrad, a highly principled special ops agent who was left by his CIA bosses to rot in a Salvadoran prison after his cover was blown several years back.In a bid to earn itself some intellectual cred with the deeper thinkers in the audience, the movie gets all high-minded and sanctimonious about the role bloodlust plays in our sports and entertainment - as if ""The Condemned"" were anything but a prime example of the very thing it is purporting to rail against.

And though, I loved wrestling back in the day was a Stone Cold fan, I really didn't have the faith that he could act. (Though this role wasn't exactly a stretch for him!) Well, I can say now that the film is no where as bad as I expected, and except for very end, I rather enjoyed it. Yeah, the concept has been kinda done before (The Running Man comes to mind instantly), but this was a bit of a new twist. Plus, nowadays its hard to come up with something totally original anyway. There are some good action sequences, and co-star Vinnie Jones shines as the ultimate ""Bad Guy"". No, Stone Cold's performance won't win him an Oscar, but for what kind of film this was and role he played, he wasn't bad. And like I said, I think Vinnie Jones was the real star in the film. However, I'm not saying the film is without its flaws. First off, I didn't like the fact that there was a husband and wife included as one of the 10 condemned. Their characters seemed like some nice couple rather than death row inmates. And at certain other points in the film, some of the prisoners acted out of character. If these 10 people were supposed to be the toughest and meanest people around, they all should've acted like it. Some of the sub-plots were kinda lame as well, mainly with the backstory of Austin's character and his girlfriend/wife. I didn't like the whole scene of him finding a phone on the island and calling her. The fact that he would call her and not someone who could help him is kinda absurd. His character was supposed to be some secret government killing machine. You're telling me he wouldn't know of anyone you could've helped him in out in that situation?? Nevertheless, these are minor discrepancies compared to the glaring bullcrap that was in the very end of the film. WARNING: BIG SPOILER AHEAD!! Here's a scene where we have the ""hero"" Stone Cold throw a bomb into a helicopter as its taking off. In previous shots, the chopper looked pretty damn far up in the air, not to mention all the wind being generated from it during a take-off. Nevertheless, Austin, I assume being a Heisman quarterback, flings it perfectly into the helicopter and the bomb goes off, killing the bad guy! Its sequences just like this one that I usually stay away from these unrealistic, over-the-top action movies. Yes, there was some in this film as well, but nothing that reached this level. Another thing is that you know the ending before you watch the film. I was really hoping that this film would fool me, and that Stone Cold wouldn't be the hero of the film, or at least, wouldn't survive. But my hopes were in vain. How can someone watch a WWE produced film, with a story like this one, that has a famous WWE superstar in it, and not expect Austin to be the main star and survive?? But in any case, this film wasn't all that bad. And apart from the ending and the crappy music by Nickelback during the ending credits, I found the movie quite enjoyable. Again, this film won't be winning any awards, but its definitely worth watching, and perhaps worth owning (for the right price), if you're a fan of the genre.",3,3.5 Stars: Much Better Than I Expected!,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,3241,"['rented', 'flick', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'WWE', 'production', 'got', 'Wrestling', 'Superstar', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'lead', 'loved', 'wrestling', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'fan', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'faith', 'could', 'act', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'stretch', 'Well', 'can', 'say', 'now', 'film', 'where', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'very', 'end', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'Yeah', 'concept', 'been', 'kinda', 'done', 'Running', 'Man', 'mind', 'instantly', 'was', 'bit', 'new', 'twist', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'totally', 'original', 'anyway', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'co-star', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'shines', 'ultimate', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'No', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'was', 'role', 'played', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'said', 'think', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'was', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'flaws', 'First', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'was', 'husband', 'wife', 'included', 'one', '10', 'condemned', 'characters', 'seemed', 'nice', 'couple', 'rather', 'death', 'row', 'inmates', 'certain', 'other', 'points', 'film', 'prisoners', 'acted', 'character', '10', 'people', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'toughest', 'meanest', 'people', 'around', 'should', ""'ve"", 'acted', 'sub-plots', 'were', 'kinda', 'lame', 'as', 'well', 'mainly', 'backstory', 'Austin', 'character', 'girlfriend/wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'whole', 'scene', 'finding', 'phone', 'island', 'calling', 'fact', 'would', 'call', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'kinda', 'absurd', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'secret', 'government', 'killing', 'machine', ""'re"", 'telling', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'could', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'out', 'situation', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'minor', 'discrepancies', 'compared', 'glaring', 'bullcrap', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'WARNING', 'BIG', 'SPOILER', 'AHEAD', 'Here', 'scene', 'where', 'have', 'hero', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'throw', 'bomb', 'helicopter', 'taking', 'off', 'previous', 'shots', 'chopper', 'looked', 'pretty', 'damn', 'far', 'up', 'air', 'not', 'mention', 'wind', 'being', 'generated', 'take-off', 'Nevertheless', 'Austin', 'assume', 'being', 'Heisman', 'quarterback', 'flings', 'perfectly', 'helicopter', 'bomb', 'off', 'killing', 'bad', 'guy', 'sequences', 'just', 'one', 'usually', 'stay', 'away', 'unrealistic', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'movies', 'Yes', 'was', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'reached', 'level', 'thing', 'know', 'ending', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'film', 'would', 'fool', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hero', 'film', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'survive', 'hopes', 'were', 'vain', 'How', 'can', 'someone', 'watch', 'WWE', 'produced', 'film', 'story', 'one', 'famous', 'WWE', 'superstar', 'not', 'expect', 'Austin', 'be', 'main', 'star', 'survive', 'case', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'apart', 'ending', 'crappy', 'music', 'Nickelback', 'ending', 'credits', 'found', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Again', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'winning', 'awards', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'perhaps', 'worth', 'owning', 'right', 'price', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre']",The Condemned
1086883,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000SM6FKY,Tim Janson,"[1, 1]","If you think you've seen The Condemned before you wouldn't be entirely mistaken. It borrows elements from several films including Escape from New York, Running Man, and No Escape. Despite that, this is actually a pretty good action flick and really took me by surprise. Wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is Jack Conrad, one of ten condemned prisoners who gets a chance at freedom. A wealthy producer named Breckel has brought Conrad and the other nine prisoners to an island near New Guinea where they will battle to the death with the lone survivor winning his, or her, freedom. Breckel will broadcast the event over the internet and his team has set up hundreds of cameras all around the island to capture the brutal action. Each ""contestant"" has been fitted with an explosive ankle bracelet to keep them in control.Among the other prisoners is former SAS operative McStarley played by Vinnie Jones. Jones has virtually made a career out of playing similar tough guy roles including Juggernaut in X-Men 3. He plays McStarley to the villainous hilt. McStarley has formed an alliance with Japanese martial artist Saiga, and together they hunt down the rest of the prisoners. Yet another prisoner is played by former WWE wrestler and Strongman competitor, 6' 11"" Nathan Jones. It isn't all just a beat-em-up however. A back-story on Conrad shows that he is more than just an average prisoner. He disappeared from his home in Texas a year earlier without a word to his girlfriend. Now his entire hometown is watching the action unfold over the Internet along with millions of other viewers.Now, Steve Austin isn't a guy with a lot of acting range. But then again, guys like that (Chuck Norris, Steven Segal) have done quite well for themselves in action hero roles. The writers and director were very smart with the way they handled Austin. Even though he is the star, he isn't asked to carry the film or be in every shot. In fact, several actors, including Jones, have far more lines of dialogue than Austin does. But as the tough guy hero, he does pretty well. He's got the usual hero quips and does an excellent job with the action scenes.The movie makes a moral point about violence on TV and the internet, and the responsibility that producers of such shows have to the general public. Breckel is the stereotypical smarmy producer who is only interested in trying to get as many viewers as the Super Bowl gets...although I'm thinking forty million viewers might toast his server. The film has some plot holes to be sure...The prisoners are supposed to be on the opposite side of the island from the production facility yet Conrad travels to and from there three times so it must be one tiny island. And then there is the whole logistical issue of setting up hundreds of cameras in this tropical jungle, often having several cameras catching the action at once. That stretches believability quite a bit. There also isn't much development of the prisoners and several are killed off pretty quickly.In many ways, The Condemned is a throwback to action flicks of the 80's with a tough, no-nonsense hero, a great villain, good looking women, and lots of action. Austin does a solid job with his role but Jones truly shines as the sadistic McStarley. The DVD includes a five-part ""making of"" documentary, audio commentaries, storyboard sequences, and Stone Cold's visit to Movie World.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",4,SOLID ACTION FILM...JONES STEALS THE SHOW!,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,3403,"['think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Condemned', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'entirely', 'mistaken', 'elements', 'several', 'films', 'including', 'Escape', 'New', 'York', 'Running', 'Man', 'Escape', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'really', 'took', 'surprise', 'Wrestler', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Jack', 'Conrad', 'one', 'ten', 'condemned', 'prisoners', 'who', 'chance', 'freedom', 'wealthy', 'producer', 'named', 'Breckel', 'brought', 'Conrad', 'other', 'nine', 'prisoners', 'island', 'New', 'Guinea', 'where', 'will', 'battle', 'death', 'lone', 'survivor', 'winning', 'freedom', 'Breckel', 'will', 'broadcast', 'event', 'internet', 'team', 'set', 'up', 'hundreds', 'cameras', 'island', 'capture', 'brutal', 'action', 'contestant', 'been', 'fitted', 'explosive', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'keep', 'control.Among', 'other', 'prisoners', 'former', 'SAS', 'operative', 'McStarley', 'played', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Jones', 'virtually', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'similar', 'tough', 'guy', 'roles', 'including', 'Juggernaut', 'X-Men', '3', 'McStarley', 'villainous', 'hilt', 'McStarley', 'formed', 'alliance', 'Japanese', 'martial', 'artist', 'Saiga', 'together', 'hunt', 'down', 'rest', 'prisoners', 'prisoner', 'played', 'former', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'Strongman', 'competitor', '6', '11', 'Nathan', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'just', 'beat-em-up', 'however', 'back-story', 'Conrad', 'shows', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'prisoner', 'disappeared', 'home', 'Texas', 'year', 'earlier', 'word', 'girlfriend', 'Now', 'entire', 'hometown', 'watching', 'action', 'unfold', 'Internet', 'millions', 'other', 'viewers.Now', 'Steve', 'Austin', ""n't"", 'guy', 'lot', 'acting', 'range', 'then', 'again', 'guys', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'have', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'action', 'hero', 'roles', 'writers', 'director', 'were', 'very', 'smart', 'way', 'handled', 'Austin', 'Even', 'star', ""n't"", 'asked', 'carry', 'film', 'be', 'shot', 'fact', 'several', 'actors', 'including', 'Jones', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'Austin', 'tough', 'guy', 'hero', 'pretty', 'well', 'got', 'usual', 'hero', 'quips', 'excellent', 'job', 'action', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'moral', 'point', 'violence', 'TV', 'internet', 'responsibility', 'producers', 'such', 'shows', 'have', 'general', 'public', 'Breckel', 'stereotypical', 'smarmy', 'producer', 'who', 'only', 'interested', 'trying', 'get', 'many', 'viewers', 'Super', 'Bowl', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'forty', 'million', 'viewers', 'might', 'toast', 'server', 'film', 'plot', 'holes', 'be', 'sure', 'prisoners', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'opposite', 'side', 'island', 'production', 'facility', 'yet', 'Conrad', 'travels', 'there', 'three', 'times', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'tiny', 'island', 'then', 'whole', 'logistical', 'issue', 'setting', 'up', 'hundreds', 'cameras', 'tropical', 'jungle', 'often', 'having', 'several', 'cameras', 'catching', 'action', 'once', 'believability', 'quite', 'bit', 'also', ""n't"", 'much', 'development', 'prisoners', 'several', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'pretty', 'quickly.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Condemned', 'throwback', 'action', 'flicks', '80', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'hero', 'great', 'villain', 'good', 'looking', 'women', 'lots', 'action', 'Austin', 'solid', 'job', 'role', 'Jones', 'truly', 'sadistic', 'McStarley', 'DVD', 'five-part', 'making', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'storyboard', 'sequences', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'visit', 'Movie', 'World.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']",The Condemned

1086885,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000SM6FKY,trebe,"[0, 0]","World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Productions, The Condemned (2007), is a high energy, testosterone rich, bone crunching, often brutal, action/adventure.  Directed and co-written by Scott Wiper, and shot in Australia, the project is a star vehicle for former pro wrestler `Stone Cold' Steve Austin.  Austin is Jack Conrad, one of ten convicts condemned to die, selected to participate in a survival contest on a remote Pacific island.  The last one left alive after thirty hours wins their freedom.  Promoter Ian Breckel (Robert Mammone), has orchestrated it all to make a profit.  With cameras setup all around the island to stream live video of the deadly events, to a pay-for-view internet audience.  Breckel controls the cameras, and directs the production crew from a studio on the island.Pitting ten hardened criminals against each other soon produces results, and as contestants are eliminated from the game, the number of paying subscribers begins to climb.  It is bad news for the other contestants when psycho ex-mercenary Ewan McStarley (Vinnie Jones) and martial arts expert Saiga (Masa Yamaguchi) team up.  Breckel is manipulating the results by supplying the pair with weapons.  Another team is a husband and wife both convicted of murder, unfortunately they are the first to be eliminated by the sadistic duo.The Condemned delivers solidly in the action and fighting departments, in particular Conrad's extended fight scenes in the jungle with Saiga and McStarley are ferocious and intense.  Steve Austin may have had limited acting experience, and his dialog is sparse, but he has an immense screen presence, and does more than a credible acting job for a film of this type.  The film also attempts to be socially provocative, examining questions of morality, voyeurism, and the limits of 'reality' television.  While it may not be the most appropriate setting, these are still some interesting issues to consider.  In a taut and edgy performance, Vinnie Jones plays it straight as a pure evil villain, that you truly look forward to seeing breathe his last.  Yet interestingly, it is through McStarley that a key part of the film's message is delivered.The DVD includes an informative commentary track by director Scott Wiper, and a second commentary with Wiper, and an extremely down to earth and amusing, Steve Austin.  There are also various special features, highlighted by a fairly comprehensive and insightful making of feature.

The story of the WWE-produced film is simple. Ten death row convicts from all over the world are brought to a deserted Pacific island, where they are forced to kill each other. The battles are broadcast via internet (US$49.95 needed to view) and the last man (or woman) standing will be awarded money and a right to be free.Now, Steve Austin plays Conrad, a contestant who is ""bought"" from a Central American prison by an enterprising producer Breckel (Robert Mammone).

I have seen much worse ones. It is just that the actions in ""The Condemned,"" which look often repetitious, are ordinary, familiar and ... well, in short, nothing new.

The movie isn't bad for an action movie but it was not really good or great. The premise is ok but we have kind of seen it before with Series 7 and Running Man and probably others I can't remember. Most of it was pretty good because they didn't sugar coat alot of the people that were suppose to be murderers (except the husband and wife). Vinnie Jones, to me, was the star and should have been (the star), even though he is also limited. That brings me to the weakest part of the movie and that is Stone Cold Steve Austin. He just sucked. He has no range as an actor. And I mean NO RANGE. Every line was delivered the exact same way with the same constipated look on his face no matter if he was killing somebody, talking to his wife he hadn't seen in 2 years or any other situation. He tried to play it cool, I guess, and it just came off as somebody reading their lines, rather poorly and putting about as much effort into it as you would in a read thru. Hey Steve, when you are mad... show some rage and get mad. When you are suppose to be sad... some expression other than... I'm bitter and constipated. He was just horrible. And he wasn't all that good in his fight scenes either. He looked big and slow and he didn't move around like a guy that was suppose to be so dangerous. He looked like a beat up old wrestler who was on a little juice who kind of plodded along like a slow old worn out slug.Its worth a watch... once.

Battle Royale is more of a story driven drama involving some sad and tragic circumstances for kids who are forced to do immoral and horrible acts to survive, this movie on the other forces people who enjoy killing to kill just to be set free. This movie is a leave your brain elsewhere type movie with plenty of action, I would say it is part expendables mixed with predominantly Battle Royale. If you love action and things blowing up, this is your movie. With it being so cheap, you haave nothing to lose.",5,Not as good as Battle Royale but still entertaining,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,608,"['Even', 'prefer', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'popcorn', 'action', 'flick', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'more', 'story', 'driven', 'drama', 'involving', 'sad', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'do', 'immoral', 'horrible', 'acts', 'survive', 'movie', 'other', 'forces', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'killing', 'kill', 'just', 'be', 'set', 'free', 'movie', 'leave', 'brain', 'elsewhere', 'type', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'would', 'say', 'part', 'expendables', 'mixed', 'predominantly', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'love', 'action', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'movie', 'being', 'so', 'cheap', 'haave', 'nothing', 'lose']",The Condemned
