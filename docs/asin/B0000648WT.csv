He has learned the word ""telephone"" from it, which is not an easy word for a child of this age.  Each skit is dedicated to a different topic - singing, drawing, and telephones.Elmo asks questions such as ""who can sing?"", ""what doesn't draw?"" and ""how does the telephone work?""  Even though some of Elmo's background art work for his world is a bit hard on the eyes, this is a great introduction to these topics for the ages 2 and under.For me, it is too much Elmo, but it really isn't for me now, is it?I recommend for the toddlers!!",3,My toddler loves this.,1031702400,"09 11, 2002",2002,705,"['Elmo', 'World', 'collection', 'skits', 'are', 'Elmo', 'cute', 'little', 'furry', 'red', 'monster', 'recent', 'years', 'Sesame', 'Street.My', 'son', '20', 'months', 'old', 'video', 'learned', 'word', 'telephone', 'not', 'easy', 'word', 'child', 'age', 'skit', 'dedicated', 'different', 'topic', 'singing', 'drawing', 'telephones.Elmo', 'asks', 'questions', 'such', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'what', ""n't"", 'draw', 'how', 'telephone', 'work', 'Even', 'Elmo', 'background', 'art', 'work', 'world', 'bit', 'hard', 'eyes', 'great', 'introduction', 'topics', 'ages', '2', 'under.For', 'too', 'much', 'Elmo', 'really', ""n't"", 'now', 'recommend', 'toddlers']","Elmo's World - Singing, Drawing & More"

Thanks to the Drawing segment, my daughter has really become more interested in drawing and coloring.  I'd say that has been the most educational part of the dvd.  Singing is fun, and the tunes are catchy. The telephone segment goes through a history of the telephone, which is highly entertaining.  What kid doesn't like playing with telephones? Just make sure you have your play-phone handy so they can play right along with Elmo's World.
