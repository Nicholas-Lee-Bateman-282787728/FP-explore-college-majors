1436236,A3VCMER0BCBZWS,B00514HM06,Barbara Stephens,"[1, 5]",This movie shows superb writing and directing. The plot and subplots will keep you in suspense. It will make you think and come up with different conclusions with each viewing. It is very well done with well known actors. After seeing it in the theater I will certainly purchase it here from Amazon when it comes out. I highly recommend this movie.,5,Superb Writing and Directing,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,348,"['movie', 'superb', 'writing', 'directing', 'plot', 'subplots', 'will', 'keep', 'suspense', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'come', 'up', 'different', 'conclusions', 'viewing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'seeing', 'theater', 'will', 'certainly', 'purchase', 'here', 'Amazon', 'when', 'out', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",House of Fallen - UNRATED
1436237,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00514HM06,Michael Butts,"[2, 2]","HOUSE OF FALLEN is a horror movie that suffers from TOO much plotting...plotting that is muddled, incohesive and ultimately ridiculous.  Three different ""tales"" don't really intersect,  but do share the theme of The Watchers and the 12 chosen to watch the Watchers.  Tale One involves a group of robbers hiding out in an abandoned house besieged by one of the Watchers.  Tale Two gives us a rather gaunt C. Thomas Howell as an ex-priest griefstricken over the death of his girlfriend who is recruited by a mysterious stranger to join the 12 and also perform an exorcism on a man allegedly possessed by one of the Watchers.  Still with me?  The final tale has Corbin Bernsen as one of the 12 trying to recruit another member who is actually possessed by a Watcher.  Whew!There's lots of religious psychobabble and true identities are eventually revealed which are pretty preposterous.  Canadian Jeff Wincott shows up late in a devilish, useless cameo.The movie may have worked if it had focused on one of the tales or had better connectivity.  It ends up being tiresome and perplexing, generating no suspense or thrills.",1,FALLEN FALLS,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1119,"['HOUSE', 'OF', 'FALLEN', 'horror', 'movie', 'suffers', 'TOO', 'much', 'plotting', 'plotting', 'muddled', 'incohesive', 'ultimately', 'ridiculous', 'Three', 'different', 'tales', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'intersect', 'do', 'share', 'theme', 'Watchers', '12', 'chosen', 'watch', 'Watchers', 'Tale', 'One', 'group', 'robbers', 'hiding', 'out', 'abandoned', 'house', 'besieged', 'one', 'Watchers', 'Tale', 'Two', 'rather', 'gaunt', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'ex-priest', 'griefstricken', 'death', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'recruited', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'join', '12', 'also', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'man', 'allegedly', 'possessed', 'one', 'Watchers', 'Still', 'final', 'tale', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'one', '12', 'trying', 'recruit', 'member', 'who', 'actually', 'possessed', 'Watcher', 'Whew', 'lots', 'religious', 'psychobabble', 'true', 'identities', 'are', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'are', 'pretty', 'preposterous', 'Canadian', 'Jeff', 'Wincott', 'up', 'late', 'devilish', 'useless', 'cameo.The', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'focused', 'one', 'tales', 'had', 'better', 'connectivity', 'up', 'being', 'tiresome', 'perplexing', 'generating', 'suspense', 'thrills']",House of Fallen - UNRATED

I will teach you how to hunt and kill a fallen angel.""  After the floods were started in order to wash away evil, a few ""Watchers"" survived.  These watchers find past sinners and punish them.  It is up to a select twelve to find and kill them before it's too late.  This is a movie that after reading what it was about made me excited.  Fallen angels, battle, religion...""Constantine 2???""  About 15 min in you realize that just because it sounds good on paper doesn't always mean anything.  To be fair, this movie was not that bad overall.  The best way to describe it would be that the movie felt like the re-enactment scenes for shows like ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and the talking parts in documentaries where the subject is in a chair and looking at the camera.  If you go in expecting a lot you will be disappointed. Overall, not that exciting but watchable.  I would call it a religious horror movie.  I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - No, barely made it through once.*Also try - Constantine",2,"A religious horror movie that sounds much much cooler then it really is.

I was bemused at the trilogy of plots that opened up before me, lost count of the times that when someone's name was mentioned that I couldn't picture that character in my mind, and even gently nodded off for 10 minutes midway!Sure it got better in the final third, but man, the acting and dialogue in general for this film is simply low brow horrid. There's no beating around the bush here for it's that bad. And quite why Corbin Bernsen (obviously on hiatus from the second season of 'Burn Notice' at that time) and C. Thomas Howell (who plays a character here named, yup, Thomas!) decided to sign on is beyond me too!A paycheck film, sure, I can see that, but these such films stick with you, and your fans, trust me! As for C. Thomas Howell himself, the man (back in 2008 when this was filmed) was looking gaunt, very frail, and carried on his face a monster goatee that could quite easily have come with its own pet name!With sentences like ""You can either continue the path you're on, praying for those beyond help, or you can join me. I will teach you how to hunt and kill a fallen angel"" abounding throughout, 'House of Fallen' (basically) follows three sub plots: A house full of bank robbers just waiting to turn the gun on each other, a man possessed by the Devil himself, and a young man stuck in a beach getaway dreamscape/nightmare!A so-called religious-horror movie at its core, there are no real shocks, but there is enough bad acting to spread the wealth. Save for two: the young man who is trying to be saved by Corbin Bernsen's character Roland, William Gregory Lee as Brooks; and Marc Gable as Brian, the man possessed. They, at the very least, slide out of this mess with some acting chop dignity.For the first 20 minutes of the movie C. Thomas Howell's character keeps saying he's sorry - over and over and over - and from then on in I kept saying it to myself for having to watch 'House of Fallen' all the way to its dead end conclusion!
