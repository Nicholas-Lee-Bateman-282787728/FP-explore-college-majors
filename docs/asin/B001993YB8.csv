1162532,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B001993YB8,barry,"[2, 2]","I grew up on THE FACTS OF LIFE and was thrilled when they announced the release of season 4.  Not only was it the best season with the girls more matured and dealing with heavier issues, but we also have the very well done and emotional graduation of Jo and Blair from the Eastland Academy For Girls.  This was dealt with in two parts and was lovingly handled with great care for fans.  It was very believable that Jo and Blair had grown into young women, formed a special bond and we see how all this realistically affected all four of our girls.The most important part of this boxed set is the inclusion of the tv movie special THE FACTS OF LIFE GOES TO PARIS.  This was presented as a special weeks before season four started and received huge ratings.  It was superbly written.  Usually when tv series had movies like this they turned into slapstick silly ventures.  Here we got journeys of self exploration of all the girls including Mrs. Garrett which helped greatly to show how they had grown up when the new season premiered.  This special could easily have been sold as a separate dvd but to include such a huge special feature deserves the highest kudos.Stories on THE FACTS OF LIFE always dealt with serious and timely issues and that continues here.  Blair dates and tries to change a retarded young man.  Jo deals with possibly having to leave Eastland due to the loss of her scholarship.  I can go on and on about the plots but they were all great and displayed how our girls had blossomed.  And holding it all together as always is Charlotte Rae as Mrs. Garrett.  She was always the shining light of this show bringing some light slapstick while bringing wisdom to all the girls.  If you grew up on this show this is the best season to have.

When Sony suddenly lost interest in THE FACTS OF LIFE following the release of Season Three, fans were left wondering if we'd ever see the continuing stories of the Eastland gang.  After all, Season Four-onwards is where the show really picks up the pace!  Not to worry now, with Shout! Factory seeming to be firmly committed in seeing the rest of the sets released in a more timely fashion (Season Five is poised for a November street-date as I'm writing this review).Not only do we get all 24 episodes from Season Four, but also the complete THE FACTS OF LIFE GOES TO PARIS special!  This four-episode, movie-length story originally aired before Season Four kicked off in 1982.  Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) and the girls enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to Paris, where Mrs. G. is enrolled in an exclusive cookery seminar.  The girls are meant to be studying at a summer boarding-school but manage to break away for their own adventures.  Jo (Nancy McKeon) finds unexpected romance with a dreamy French boy.  Blair (Lisa Whelchel) sets out with similar plans but has her ideal vacation by instead letting down her guard and living in the ""moment""; whilst Tootie and Natalie befriend an American author with writer's block.Season Four of THE FACTS OF LIFE brings more drama and expectations for the girls, Blair and Jo especially.  It's their last year at Eastland and the pressures start to take their toll.  Jo's days at the Academy could be numbered when her scholarship is cut off - and the only possible way that she could stay would be to accept a grant from Warner Industries - Blair's company!  Tootie (Kim Fields) must grapple with a hearing problem; and Natalie (Mindy Cohn) faces the opportunity to meet her birth mother.

Factory is among the leader in restoring and releasing classic television shows to the home dvd purchasing community. The effort that was put into this DVD release was ""monumental"" and well worth the wait. As previous releases were released by another company, the first Shout! release gives fans hope that they will be able to complete their ""Facts of Life"" DVD collection. This is the first ""Facts of Life"" DVD release in several years and fans were worried that they might not be able to complete their DVD collection.Talk about hard work and an effort well done, the ""Facts of Life"" the Complete Fourth Season DVD opens up with a bonus that television fans probably thought they would never own on DVD. The DVD opens up with the feature length film ""The Facts of Life-Goes To Paris."" The nearly two hour movie is a 1980s classic. The movie originally aired on NBC on September 25th 1982. In the movie, the girls from Eastland, Blair, Tootie, Natalie and Jo arrive in Paris for a fun vacation filled with romance. When this movie originally aired, so many young girls were excited about the prospect of pen pals and foreign romance. It is so great the television fans will be able to own this hard to find classic on DVD. The VHS/BETA version of ""The Facts of Life-Goes To Paris"" was available for rental and purchase until about 1989, so fans of the movie will be so pleased to own this classic on television. The movie is featured on the first DVD in the four disc set.On to season four. The fourth season of ""The Facts of Life"" was in bright sparkling sharp color, when looking at the DVD you can see this high intensity NBC camera color as if they were not yet using the softer filters that they used for shows like ""Empty Nest"" and ""The Golden Girls,"" the sharpness is very noticable and the restoration for the high definition DVD release is spectacular. The theme for the fourth season appears to be independence as each girl has her own set of issues and circumstances to deal with. The fourth season of ""The Facts of Life"" aired between September of 1982 and May of 1983. The season starts with a financial debacle known as Jo is made to consider accepting money from the family of Blair Warner when she faces losing portions of her scholarship to Eastland School. Jo is full of pride and doesn't want any handouts from the Warner Foundation. This is not the only time during the season Jo has to deal with the theme of money, in the episode ""Help From Home,"" Jo is having a hard time dealing with graduating from Eastland when she realizes her family may not be able to afford college. During the 1980s, there was some controversy about the stereotyped image of the character of ""Jo"" because of her always being made to ""act"" so tough. Other cool episodes include the fan favorite episode of when a royal enrolls at Eastland and the popular episode of the Sadie Hawkins Dance when Natalie is afraid she can't find a date.The large theme of the season is ""disability"" and ""accidents"" the episodes are unforgettable. This season features the episode when Tootie has to address hearing loss. Blair once again has to display the ultimate compassion and understanding when she has to counsel a student who is handicapped. Mrs. Garrett has to deal with a medical issue-high blood pressure and the girls learn a hard lesson about drinking and driving.The season is a catalyst that may leave fans near tears-how did it happen so fast? Where did the time go? As the season ends, Blair and Jo graduate from Eastland School. So many fans from the 1980s remember the heartfelt episode episode when tough kid Jo graduates from rich preppy Eastland with school sister friend Blair, and the pain that Tootie and Natalie have to deal with knowing they will have to continue the Eastland tradition without Blair and Jo by their side.

Season 4 is one of the very best, if not the best. All of the eps are funny and well thought-out and always include very real life-affirming lessons that are still important more than 25 years later.It's hard to say who my favorite character on TFoL was. Perhaps Blair (Lisa Whelchel) because she was so self-centered and funny. Jo (Nancy McKeon) and Blair were great to watch together because they were the total yin and yang. They were the complete opposite of each other. And that's another reason why I love ""The Facts of Life"" because it showed a group of 4 girls working together and puting their differences aside while they opened their minds and learned to be a family in a way.Mrs. Garret (Charlotte Rae) totally rocked. She was everything to the girls, almost like a parent and a friend, a listener and even a stern disciplinarian. And Natalie (Mindy Cohn) and Tootie (Kim Fields) were the perfect addition to this ensemble cast. They didn't take away from the others, instead they added to an already perfect show (if that's possible.) And I loved Geri Jewell as Blair's comedienne cousin Geri.Season 4 includes a total of 24 eps (in syndication it's 25 because the season finale was an hour-long.) IMO the most memorable eps from this season are Best Sister 1 & 2. These are the ones with Blair's sister who makes the decision to become a nun, played by everyone's favorite middle-child Eve Plumb. You may remember, when things get especially heated with, Jo actually gave Blair a nice clock in the face on the second part of the ep.BTW if you're a fan of ""The Facts of Life"" you can still catch it on Comcast's Tube Time as well as online @ tv dot com. ...Remember, you'll avoid a lot of damages, and enjoy the fun of managing the facts of life.",5,"if you hear em from your brother, better clear em with your mother, better get em right, call her late at night",1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,1874,"['Facts', 'Life', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'shows', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'right', 'there', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'Season', '4', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'eps', 'are', 'funny', 'well', 'thought-out', 'always', 'include', 'very', 'real', 'life-affirming', 'lessons', 'are', 'still', 'important', 'more', '25', 'years', 'later.It', 'hard', 'say', 'who', 'favorite', 'character', 'TFoL', 'was', 'Perhaps', 'Blair', 'Lisa', 'Whelchel', 'was', 'so', 'self-centered', 'funny', 'Jo', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'Blair', 'were', 'great', 'watch', 'together', 'were', 'total', 'yin', 'yang', 'were', 'complete', 'opposite', 'other', 'reason', 'why', 'love', 'Facts', 'Life', 'showed', 'group', '4', 'girls', 'working', 'together', 'puting', 'differences', 'aside', 'opened', 'minds', 'learned', 'be', 'family', 'way.Mrs', 'Garret', 'Charlotte', 'Rae', 'totally', 'rocked', 'was', 'everything', 'girls', 'almost', 'parent', 'friend', 'listener', 'even', 'stern', 'disciplinarian', 'Natalie', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'Tootie', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'were', 'perfect', 'addition', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'others', 'instead', 'added', 'already', 'perfect', 'show', 'possible', 'loved', 'Geri', 'Jewell', 'Blair', 'comedienne', 'cousin', 'Geri.Season', '4', 'total', '24', 'eps', 'syndication', '25', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'hour-long', 'most', 'memorable', 'eps', 'season', 'are', 'Best', 'Sister', '1', '2', 'are', 'ones', 'Blair', 'sister', 'who', 'decision', 'become', 'nun', 'played', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'middle-child', 'Eve', 'Plumb', 'may', 'remember', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'especially', 'heated', 'Jo', 'actually', 'gave', 'Blair', 'nice', 'clock', 'face', 'second', 'part', 'ep.BTW', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Facts', 'Life', 'can', 'still', 'catch', 'Comcast', 'Tube', 'Time', 'as', 'well', 'online', '@', 'tv', 'dot', 'com', 'Remember', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'lot', 'damages', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'managing', 'facts', 'life']",The Facts of Life: Season 4

1162554,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B001993YB8,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 2]","THE FACTS OF LIFE was a popular sitcom that was a spinoff of DIFF'RENT STROKES pertaining to the Drummond's former maid Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who now works as the housemother of a dormitory at an all-girls only private school called Eastland School in Peekskill, New York and the series ran on NBC from Friday August 24, 1979 to Saturday May 7, 1988 throughout its whole 9-year run.The girls who were under Mrs. Garrett's care were spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), the overweight, but impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest, but gossipy Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsay(Kim Fields).This 1982-83 Season was awesome and is the season when Blair and Jo graduate from Eastland Academy in the Spring of 1983 when THE FACTS OF LIFE ranked 5th among prime-time shows.Unfortunately THE FACTS OF LIFE wasn't originally a ratings winner on Friday nights when it debuted in the Summer of 1979 or even in its second tryout in the Spring of 1980 either since it only ranked #74 out of 79 shows on the air in the year-end Nielsen ratings and was NBC's lowest-rated series for a while and didn't flourish till it hits its 2nd Season in the Fall of 1980 when the show was retooled and moved to Wednesdays ranking at a respectably moderate #26 in the ratings and was NBC's 4th highest-rated scripted series after LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, THE FACTS OF LIFE'S parent series(DIFF'RENT STROKES), and CHiPs.From there on, THE FACTS OF LIFE had continued to rank in the mid-and upper-20's in the Nielsen ratings for nearly every season until NBC kicked off its 7th Season(1985-86 Season)when it was moved to Saturdays, but its timeslot change decreased its ratings from #31 in 1986-87 and then down to #37 in its 1987-88 Season before NBC cancelled THE FACTS OF LIFE in the Summer of 1988.This 1982-1983 Season of THE FACTS OF LIFE also take me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Just Watch Us Now"" and to when I used to watch this show every Wednesday night at 9PM before watching FAMILY TIES at 9:30 PM and to when Ronald Reagan was the president and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",4,The Facts Of Life Kicks Ass!,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2221,"['FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'was', 'popular', 'sitcom', 'was', 'spinoff', ""DIFF'RENT"", 'STROKES', 'pertaining', 'Drummond', 'former', 'maid', 'Mrs.', 'Edna', 'Garrett', 'Charlotte', 'Rae', 'who', 'now', 'housemother', 'dormitory', 'all-girls', 'only', 'private', 'school', 'called', 'Eastland', 'School', 'Peekskill', 'New', 'York', 'series', 'ran', 'NBC', 'Friday', 'August', '24', '1979', 'Saturday', 'May', '7', '1988', 'whole', '9-year', 'run.The', 'girls', 'who', 'were', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'care', 'were', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'Blair', 'Warner', 'Lisa', 'Whelchel', 'tough', 'streetwise', 'Jo', 'Polniaczek', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'overweight', 'impressionable', 'Natalie', 'Green', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'youngest', 'Dorothy', 'Tootie', 'Ramsay', 'Kim', 'Fields', '.This', '1982-83', 'Season', 'was', 'awesome', 'season', 'when', 'Blair', 'Jo', 'graduate', 'Eastland', 'Academy', 'Spring', '1983', 'when', 'FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'ranked', '5th', 'prime-time', 'shows.Unfortunately', 'THE', 'FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'was', ""n't"", 'originally', 'ratings', 'winner', 'Friday', 'nights', 'when', 'debuted', 'Summer', '1979', 'even', 'second', 'tryout', 'Spring', '1980', 'only', 'ranked', '74', '79', 'shows', 'air', 'year-end', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'was', 'NBC', 'lowest-rated', 'series', 'while', 'did', ""n't"", 'flourish', 'till', '2nd', 'Season', 'Fall', '1980', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'retooled', 'moved', 'Wednesdays', 'ranking', 'respectably', 'moderate', '26', 'ratings', 'was', 'NBC', '4th', 'highest-rated', 'scripted', 'series', 'LITTLE', 'HOUSE', 'THE', 'PRAIRIE', 'THE', 'FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'parent', 'series', ""DIFF'RENT"", 'STROKES', 'CHiPs.From', 'there', 'FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'had', 'continued', 'rank', 'mid-and', 'upper-20', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'nearly', 'season', 'NBC', 'kicked', 'off', '7th', 'Season', '1985-86', 'Season', 'when', 'was', 'moved', 'Saturdays', 'timeslot', 'change', 'decreased', 'ratings', '31', '1986-87', 'then', 'down', '37', '1987-88', 'Season', 'NBC', 'cancelled', 'THE', 'FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'Summer', '1988.This', '1982-1983', 'Season', 'THE', 'FACTS', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'also', 'take', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'NBC', 'motto', 'was', 'Just', 'Watch', 'Now', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'show', 'Wednesday', 'night', '9PM', 'watching', 'FAMILY', 'TIES', '9:30', 'PM', 'when', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'president', 'when', 'had', 'budget', 'cuts', 'going', 'recession', 'had', 'back', '1981-1982']",The Facts of Life: Season 4
