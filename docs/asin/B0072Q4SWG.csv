1525058,A1Z98R6UK5T00L,B0072Q4SWG,Ben.W,"[2, 6]","Cheyenne (Sean Penn) is a retired goth-rock star who finds himself with little to do in life. But when his estranged father dies, he heads to America to attend the funeral and ends up taking a trip across the country to continue his father's search for an Ex-Nazi who tormented him when he was imprisoned in Auschwitz. Along the way, Cheyenne may learn more about himself than he ever expected.I'm not sure what I expected out of `This Must Be the Place', but in the end found it a funny and heartfelt journey. Director Poalo Sorrentino takes a slow and artful approach to shooting the film, but it never feels that way because Sean Penn is so magnetic as Cheyenne, even when he's just sitting in the kitchen staring into space, and he does an excellent job carrying the film on his shoulders, nobody does it like Sean Penn.It's also delightfully quirky and bold in that it's just littered with things that happen out of left field, like some guy appearing in Cheyenne's truck wanting a ride to nowhere for one, and the characters talking about their life philosophies really gives you something to take away when the credits roll. If you're not the type to read into the meaning of things that happen, then no biggie, because the characters say a lot of it anyway, at least the important stuff.  `This Must Be the Place' is worth seeing, who knows, like Cheyenne, you may take something out of it by the end.

1525067,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0072Q4SWG,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 2]","Sean Penn is a lot of things in the 2011 indie film ""This Must Be the Place."" He's a vampire, a zombie, a sweet child o' mine. On the surface, he's a one-time Goth rock star of the 1980s, spending his days in retirement in a Dublin castle. Patterned after The Cure's Robert Smith (The Cure - Greatest Hits), with shades of Ozzy Osbourne, he has a loving wife in Jane (Frances McDormand), who dotes on him when not serving as a local firefighter. He's adopted a youthful fan in Mary (Eve Hewson), who travels with him on daily errands, and he tries to set her up with a clean-cut Irish lass. Penn's Cheyenne lives off the millions he made as a musician, but he's been a recluse for years, disturbed by the suicide of a pair of youths who literally believed the dark messages of his music.It's difficult to categorize the crazy brilliance of Penn's performance. He's a lost soul, strolling through town pulling a suitcase like the saddest of bag-ladies. There's shades of Peter Sellers' Chance inBeing There, but that's not entirely right as Cheyenne has a subtle wit and is cognizant of his surroundings. He's certainly trapped by his past, applying make-up and lipstick to his weathered face in a daily ritual. We see rock stars today, decades past their prime, Osbourne, Keith Richards, Gene Simmons, sporting dyed hair, skull earrings and other Hot Topic adornments in comical attempts to maintain youthful rebellion. Penn's character is similar, encased within an emotional coma. Who among us surviving the 1980s, once immersed within subcultures, do not carry similar scars of what was and what became?I recently strolled a downtown street of youth, a former manic haven of live-music and raves. Back then, we dressed in black and applied makeup, arriving on the scene at midnight. Today, buildings that hosted Nine Inch Nails and Siouxsie and the Banshees are locked and quiet. A few places were open, and I passed kids half my age walking the same cement blocks. What became of these friends? What was the purpose, and when was the day I finally became old? As Tolstoy once said, it's man's greatest surprise.Okay, I suppose Penn's character is what we personally put into it, which is part of the fascination of ""This Must Be the Place."" Few actors could have played this role so effectively. With a career marked by award-winning experimentation (Milk,Carlito's Way), I think it's his greatest performance. The film was directed by Paolo Sorrentino, whoseIl Divoso inspired Penn that he insisted on working with him. So we have an interesting blend of European sensibilities and inspired whimsy. Think Jonathan Demme'sSomething Wildmixed with Jim Jarmusch'sStranger Than Paradise.Cheyenne is contacted by New York relatives and learns his father is dying. He travels to America and quietly sits next to his body, trembling hands touching him for the first time in 30 years. His father was obsessed with tracking down a Nazi war criminal who terrorized him at Auschwitz. Cheyenne asks the same question we do about Nazis, ""Aren't they all dead?"" As a matter of fact, no. The Nazi guard is evidently in his 90s, residing somewhere in the U.S.Thus begins an unlikely road trip through the west, replete with old motels, older diners and Route 66 ambiance. As usual, it's not the destination but the journey, as Cheyenne encounters similar lost souls on his hair-blown quest. He has time to catch a Talking Heads' (The Best Of Talking Heads (US Release)) concert. As we watch the performance, we realize how well their music has aged, not to mention the grace of lead singer David Byrne (in a great cameo), with a shock of gray hair, eyes sparkling, as alive as youth. In a memorable scene, Cheyenne discusses his fateful frustrations with Byrne, confessing the Talking Heads' music was true art while his own work was simply ""pop."" This is not the revelations of 1980's music per se. It is a moment's exposure of a man drowning in a monumental mid-life crisis.One of the final scenes shows an elderly man walking nude across a desolate field of snow. Like Cheyenne, he's lost in a Roman wilderness of pain. Penn's character smiles in realization, knowing full well this is his fate if he does not make peace with tragic misfortunes. He must shed the skin of his past, and leave that suitcase behind.",4,Roman wilderness of pain...,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,4304,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'lot', 'things', '2011', 'indie', 'film', 'Must', 'Be', 'Place', 'vampire', 'zombie', 'sweet', 'child', 'o', 'mine', 'surface', 'one-time', 'Goth', 'rock', 'star', '1980s', 'spending', 'days', 'retirement', 'Dublin', 'castle', 'Patterned', 'Cure', 'Robert', 'Smith', 'Cure', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'shades', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'loving', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'serving', 'local', 'firefighter', 'adopted', 'youthful', 'fan', 'Mary', 'Eve', 'Hewson', 'who', 'daily', 'errands', 'set', 'up', 'clean-cut', 'Irish', 'lass', 'Penn', 'Cheyenne', 'millions', 'made', 'musician', 'been', 'recluse', 'years', 'disturbed', 'suicide', 'pair', 'youths', 'who', 'literally', 'believed', 'dark', 'messages', 'music.It', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'crazy', 'brilliance', 'Penn', 'performance', 'lost', 'soul', 'strolling', 'town', 'pulling', 'suitcase', 'saddest', 'bag-ladies', 'shades', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Chance', 'inBeing', 'not', 'entirely', 'right', 'Cheyenne', 'subtle', 'wit', 'cognizant', 'surroundings', 'certainly', 'trapped', 'past', 'applying', 'make-up', 'lipstick', 'weathered', 'face', 'daily', 'ritual', 'see', 'rock', 'stars', 'today', 'decades', 'past', 'prime', 'Osbourne', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'sporting', 'dyed', 'hair', 'skull', 'earrings', 'other', 'Hot', 'Topic', 'adornments', 'comical', 'attempts', 'maintain', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'Penn', 'character', 'similar', 'encased', 'emotional', 'coma', 'Who', 'surviving', '1980s', 'once', 'immersed', 'subcultures', 'do', 'not', 'carry', 'similar', 'scars', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'became', 'recently', 'strolled', 'downtown', 'street', 'youth', 'former', 'manic', 'haven', 'live-music', 'raves', 'Back', 'then', 'dressed', 'black', 'applied', 'makeup', 'arriving', 'scene', 'midnight', 'Today', 'buildings', 'hosted', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'Siouxsie', 'Banshees', 'are', 'locked', 'quiet', 'few', 'places', 'were', 'open', 'passed', 'kids', 'half', 'age', 'walking', 'same', 'cement', 'blocks', 'What', 'became', 'friends', 'What', 'was', 'purpose', 'when', 'was', 'day', 'finally', 'became', 'old', 'Tolstoy', 'once', 'said', 'man', 'greatest', 'surprise.Okay', 'suppose', 'Penn', 'character', 'what', 'personally', 'put', 'part', 'fascination', 'Must', 'Be', 'Place', 'Few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'so', 'effectively', 'career', 'marked', 'award-winning', 'experimentation', 'Milk', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'think', 'greatest', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Paolo', 'Sorrentino', 'whoseIl', 'Divoso', 'inspired', 'Penn', 'insisted', 'working', 'have', 'interesting', 'blend', 'European', 'sensibilities', 'inspired', 'whimsy', 'Think', 'Jonathan', ""Demme'sSomething"", 'Wildmixed', 'Jim', ""Jarmusch'sStranger"", 'Than', 'Paradise.Cheyenne', 'contacted', 'New', 'York', 'relatives', 'father', 'dying', 'America', 'quietly', 'sits', 'body', 'trembling', 'hands', 'touching', 'first', 'time', '30', 'years', 'father', 'was', 'obsessed', 'tracking', 'down', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'who', 'terrorized', 'Auschwitz', 'Cheyenne', 'same', 'question', 'do', 'Nazis', 'Are', ""n't"", 'dead', 'matter', 'fact', 'Nazi', 'guard', 'evidently', '90s', 'residing', 'somewhere', 'U.S.Thus', 'unlikely', 'road', 'trip', 'west', 'replete', 'old', 'motels', 'older', 'diners', 'Route', '66', 'ambiance', 'usual', 'not', 'destination', 'journey', 'Cheyenne', 'similar', 'lost', 'souls', 'hair-blown', 'quest', 'time', 'catch', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'Best', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'US', 'Release', 'concert', 'watch', 'performance', 'realize', 'how', 'well', 'music', 'aged', 'not', 'mention', 'grace', 'lead', 'singer', 'David', 'Byrne', 'great', 'cameo', 'shock', 'gray', 'hair', 'eyes', 'sparkling', 'as', 'alive', 'youth', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Cheyenne', 'fateful', 'frustrations', 'Byrne', 'confessing', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'music', 'was', 'true', 'art', 'own', 'work', 'was', 'simply', 'pop', 'not', 'revelations', '1980', 'music', 'se', 'moment', 'exposure', 'man', 'drowning', 'monumental', 'mid-life', 'crisis.One', 'final', 'scenes', 'elderly', 'man', 'walking', 'nude', 'desolate', 'field', 'snow', 'Cheyenne', 'lost', 'Roman', 'wilderness', 'pain', 'Penn', 'character', 'smiles', 'realization', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'fate', 'not', 'make', 'peace', 'tragic', 'misfortunes', 'must', 'shed', 'skin', 'past', 'leave', 'suitcase']",N/A

1525069,A41BRBD6IWGOH,B0072Q4SWG,D. Kriz,"[1, 3]","An interesting take by an Italian director (Paolo Sorrentino) on the aging of a Rock Star.  Fictional rocker named Cheyenne (played by Sean Penn) had made a career of singing very poignant but very depressing songs. Now he's retired in a palatial but largely empty estate in Ireland.

On the other hand, a film whose resume also boasts Frances McDormand, Harry Dean Stanton, Judd Hirsch and a trifecta of performances (live music, a soundtrack and acting) from David Byrne deserves at least an interview.Even so, it comes very close to blowing the interview, taking an age to answer straightforward questions, seeming distracted, needlessly self-involved and with little interest, at first, in impressing the beholder.But it does warm up a bit.To give some sense of both the film's glacial slowness and its self-indulgence, at its mid-point it halts for a five minute intermezzo in which David Byrne and his group perform the title song, in its entirety, live in concert. Apropos nothing, slap-bang in the middle of the film. Now it's a good song, well performed and imaginatively staged (extraordinarily staged, really), but still it is out of all context and has the effect of staunching what gentle narrative current had begun to flow.Cheyenne (Penn) is an elderly piece of gothic jetsam, washed up from the new-wave scene of the early Eighties. He hasn't played since, yet still mopes around his Dublin castle bedecked in black and with all the boyish accoutrements a wiser man might have put away years before: Black fright wig, white face paint, red lipstick and knee high platform boots.In other words, he resembles Robert Smith, only older. The cruel would see a flash of Bono in there too. When Cheyenne puts on his half-moon reading spectacles and distractedly blows at a Gothic lock, he even looks like Shirley Williams might, were she the lead singer of the Damned.Cheyenne rattles around his castle with his firefighter wife Jane (McDormand) and a dog with a funnel on its head. They have an open house, in and out of which flow irregulars: a T'ai-Chi expert, a young singer toting a demo CD he wants Cheyenne to produce and Mary, an under-explained goth teenager who operates like the daughter Cheyenne and Jane never had. Mary isn't half as under-explained as her mother, though, who sits smoking in her room in a bedsit in the shadow of Aviva Stadium (which waggish locals, I gather, call the ""Palindrome""!) and staring wordlessly down the street every day. She seems to have some relation to Cheyenne, but despite having read the production notes I couldn't tell you what it is, and I defy anyone watching without them not to be totally flummoxed.All of this passes Cheyenne by in a hazy, laconic stupor. He slurps juice through a straw and doesn't smoke, so you suppose the drugs have long since done their work. He glumly wheels his trolley to the mall, passively copping mockery and abuse as if he were carrying a cross. Which, of course, he is.Just as we're settling into this rather surreal Irish kitchen-sink drama, we find out more about that cross. It's a cross of iron. Cheyenne's estranged father, back home in New York, is dying. He embarks, slowly (by ocean liner, of course), to see him. He arrives too late. It turns out Cheyenne is the black sheep of an observant Jewish family. His dad was an Auschwitz survivor.At this news, you may be thinking: ""oh-oh"". I certainly was. In any case, this unexpected new plot beat graunches the gears, but is neatly lubricated by David Byrne's bravura performance.So begins Act II: in his father's death, Cheyenne finds the purpose that has been eluding him over half his life: to cast off his cross. He decides to track down the Auschwitz guard who tormented his father.As a plot development, given all we know about Cheyenne, this isn't just improbable: it's preposterous. But the outcome isn't half as bad (cinematically) as it could be. Cheyenne borrows a pickup and sets off into America's great interior. He has traded his shopping trolley for a wheelie suitcase but kept the gothic garb, so be under no illusions: Cheyenne still has Baggage.The undercurrent of Lynchian weirdness in the first half of the film thereby becomes explicit - Cheyenne's meandering progress and the oddballs he meets would not be out of place inThe Straight Story(in which Alvin Straight journeys across the Midwest on a lawnmower). While this film isn't half as accomplished, there are some beautiful touches and a couple of moments of excellent slapstick (one involving a speed rollerblader in Central Park is worth the price of admission alone). The photography capturing the wide-open beauty of Utah, often through a super-wide angle lens at ankle level, is often arresting.The Nazi theme is never over-egged: it is a Macguffin of sorts, not a driving theme of the film.  The final confrontation with the ancient (and, as they go, relatively innocuous) camp guard is deftly handled. There is a startling denouement which has as much to say about the instinct for revenge as it does about the Nazi atrocities.Penn is very good throughout as Cheyenne: a tough character to play without comic exaggeration, and it must have been challenging to Penn to hold such loosely-knit film together with such an unenergetic role. He succeeds surprisingly well.This Must Be The Place won't blow the box office, and it is hard to see it finding unqualified critical support, but it has many bright moments and some surprisingly

I finally had a chance to see the movie this weekend in the theatre here in Cincinnati, and was in for quite the surprise.""This Must Be the Place"" (2011 release; 118 min.) introduces us to Cheyenne (played by Sean Penn), who has retired in Dublin from the music business for years but still dresses exactly as he did when performing 25-30 years ago (Penn is made up to look exactly like Robert Smith of the Cure). Cheyenne slowly wanders around the house. often aimlessly (think Ozzy Osbourne from the MTV reality show The Osbournes), with his still-doting wife of 35 years, Jane (played by Francis McDormand), close by. Cheyenne realizes that life is passing him by and hence decides to visit his father, whom he has not seen in decades. Cheyenne travels to New York (by boat as he has fear of flying, as we learn) but sadly he arrives just as his dad had passed away. Cheyenne learns that his dad was tormented for years by the memories of WWII, and in particluar the Nazi war criminal who humiliated and mistreated him. Cheyenne finds out that the war criminal now lives an ordinary life somewhere in the US, and decides to track him down. At this point (about 45 min. into the movie), this becomes an American road movie, plain and simple, as we see Cheyenne go to places in Michigan, New Mexico and Utah. Will Cheyenne find the Nazi war criminal? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie is an Italian-French-Irish co-production, and even though the movie plays for the most part in the US, it feels very European. I can just see the director and producers saying ""wouldn't it be cool to get Judd Hirsch and Harry Dean Stanton in small roles for this? And while we're at it, let's see if we can convince David Byrne of the Talking Heads to contribute the musical score for the movie, and of course also one Talking Heads song."" Which they were all able to do, incidentally. And titled the movie after that Talking Heads song, even though there seemingly is no connection between the song and the movie at all. Sean Penn's performance is... strange. I think it was a big mistake to make him look exactly like Robert Smith, as it simply impedes on Penn's ability to do much with the character. But all that said, there were certain parts of the movie which I really liked, in particular when Cheyenne is in New Mexico and Utah. Bottom line: the movie was very different from what the trailer made me believe it would be, so beware of that. I wouldn't call this a terrific film, but it certainly isn't ""bad"" either.

I'm not sure what, but something""We hear this phrase fairly often from the lead character Cheyenne played by Sean Penn. I wonder if they had any idea how prophetic it would become in expressing the overall feel of the film itself.Sean Penn is one of the few actors who can literally transform himself from role to role. Changing every nuance of his speech syntax, body movement, breathing rhythms perhaps it's more than a transformation it's a metamorphosis into a new being.I would wager that if someone who didn't know of Sean Penn were to screen say, Mystic River, Carlitos Way and The Assassination of Richard Nixon they would have no idea and nor would they believe it was the same actor in each film.This a rare quality and I believe a natural gift that can't be learned any more than it can be taught. Lon Chaney had it and he amazed the world for decades. Today we have Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Charleze Theron and a very few others who have this remarkable and innate ability.Mr. Penn has created an interesting and charming character in Cheyenne - and ""This Must Be The Place"" plays out  as road movie, late in life coming of age story, Father and Son introspective, Nazi hunter and love story all tied up in a very loose bow. In other words it's one rail shy of a train wreck.With very little screen time, Frances Mcdormand who I adore reprises her role from Fargo, only this time instead of a floppy police hat she wears a floppy fire fighters hat. It's odd and disturbing - but then this movie is full of old tricks.There's an old saying among comics ""They can't all be gems"" it's primarily used when jokes bomb. But I think all artists regardless of the medium they use are entitles to fail because it makes us treasure the moments when it all works.It never all works here, not entirely.

1525118,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0072Q4SWG,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 11]","""This Must Be the Place"" is a film that refuses to be pigeon-holed. Often off-beat, unpredictable and meandering, the Italian/French/Irish film is an art-house film of which bits are better than the whole.Sean Penn is Cheyenne, a fifty-year-old wealthy retired rock singer in Goth attire currently living in Dublin. When he hears that his father is dying, Cheyenne travels to New York City, where he learns about the tragic past of his long estranged father.The film is most effective when focusing its oddball characters played by the capable cast including Frances McDormand and Judd Hirsch. Harry Dean Stanton (""Paris, Texas"") briefly appears as Robert Plath, a real-life pilot who invented the first wheeled suitcase. David Byrne of Talking Heads (who provides soundtrack music with Will Oldham) appears as himself. ""This Must Be the Place"" is also notable for its beautifully shot photography.The film, however, loses its footing when it deals with more serious issues. So why does Sean Penn's character has to travel across the country to find a former Nazi SS Officer? Why does he have to be a Robert Smith-like rock singer? I suspect that director Paolo Sorrentino is not really sure of the answer. Also, I don't think Sean Penn with his heavily mannered performances is the right choice for the role of a quirky ex-rock singer.The highlight of the whimsical and moody film is a live concert sequence by David Byrne singing the titular Talking Heads song (complete with a unique stage look).
