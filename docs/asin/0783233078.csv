Apparently they are counting 20 years from the time the movie was finished shooting since it wasn't released until 1982.  Just before I saw it in 1982 (when I was 15), a local movie critic said it basically was to the 80's what &quot;Porky's&quot; was to the 50's, but I think &quot;Fast Times&quot; is a much better movie in just about every way, especially in taste.I really don't agree with some of the other reviewers who say that it was very realistic.  But what movie is?  Don't get me wrong, it was a really good movie, but most high school students don't fall into those strict catagories depicted in the movie.I saw high school as a student in the 80's and as a teacher today.  Despite popular sentiment, most schools are safer now than they were then, and at least in the suburbs, there are less drugs.But back to the subject.  The basic storylines are a bit shallow, but they are developed well and the acting is great.  Why didn't Phoebe Cates ever make it bigger?!?

A lot of areas have been covered, and a  lot of people quote their favorite parts in their preview titles. So I did the same.Did you ever have a job as a teenager you really hated? In high school, I was in the marching band and DETESTED the uniforms. So naturally, I related when Judge Rheinhold's character took the job in the fried chicken joint. He's forced to make a delivery wearing that idiotic uniform, stops at a light, finds a pretty babe in the car next to him, and she breaks up with laughter.  The next thing you know, his car's pulling away and there's food flying out the window!! Great!!As a matter of fact, all of Hamilton's jobs have drama--almost having a trainee put a burger joint up in smoke, a run-in with an a-hole customer which costs him his job, then a hero in a 24/7 convenience store.Sean Penn went on to become an accomplished dramatic actor and if you stopped him on the street and told him how pheonomenal he was in Fast Times, he'd probably punch you out. But he's sensational, he BECAME the part! Even during the breaks in shooting, he demanded to be called Spicolli, according to the late Ray WalstonFor the older critics who had a problem with the promiscuity of  the character played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, I say....lighten up! This was high school in the 80's, and it's lot worse today.Lastly, Mark Ratner's friend, Damone, is a riot!! Everyone knew a guy like that, who talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk! He's giving out advice like an encyclopedia on women; meanwhile, he's sitting at home on Saturday night watching cartoons and is lost when he gets his chance with Stacy! When Linda spray-painted his car and you see him driving to school, he turns into the parking space and you see the car is covered with cardboard, I fell out of my seat!In closing, no one associated with the film could have predicted it could become a cult classic. But it did because it relates to people, and sometimes that overcomes a low budget.",4,"AY-AY, SIR!!!

Man, it seems as though things have calmed down a bit.I guess things weren't really like that though.  I mean, come on.  Losing virginity at 13?  It happens, rarely, and people usually aren't proud of it.  Oh, and since this was made in 1982, there were still some leftover '70's fashions as well as the emerging '80's fashions.  Scary.  So, on to the film.  I must say, this was a very funny movie.  There wasn't too much of a plot, basically, the stories of about seven people at Ridgemont High School were followed over the course of a school year.  There's Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn), who takes the throne from ""The Perfect Score""'s Roy as my favorite stoner (sorry, I saw this movie last night and the Perfect Score the night before).  He's hilarious!  He even ordered a pizza to be delivered to him in history class!  Classic.  Anyway, there are the Hamilton siblings, Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Brad (Judge Reinhold), Stacy's friend Linda (the beautiful Phoebe Cates), and Mike Damone (Robert Romanus) and his pal Mark ""Rat"" Ratner (Brian Backer).  The group's exploits and misadventures are great to watch, yet looking back from 2004, seem a tad bizzare.I must say, I did find the use of the word ""time"" in the title a tad ironic because it seemed as if the writers didn't understand the concept of time.  Straight time anyway.  The kids' ages seemed to suddenly change.  I mean, at the beginning, Stacy was said to be 15, but I think she graduated at the end.  I don't know, maybe I'm just confused.This is a movie that withstands the tests of time fairly well.  I saw it for the first time in 2004, 22 years after it was made, and it was still pretty hilarious.

64398,A1534MBU6VJXYN,0783233078,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[4, 4]","Anone who has experienced the perils and perks of high school can easily relate to ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"". Even though it was made in 1981, the film is still relevant today, since this was the film that paved the way for ""American Pie"", ""Road Trip"", ""Old School"", and so many more college sex comedies. It also launched the careers of many now recognized actors, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold and, of course, Sean Penn. It also introduced everyone's favorite martian, Ray Walston, to a new generation of audiences who ate up his perfectly smarmy history teacher.It would be hard to explain what the plot of the film, since there are really several differnt plots. One tells the story of a 15 year old virgin (played perfectly by a 20 year old Jennifer Jason Leigh) trying to score, another deals with a ticket scalper (Rober Romanus) trying to get his friend Rat (Brian Backer), while another, most famously, has stoner Jeff Spigolli (Penn) getting high, hanging out with friends and getting on the last nerve of his history teacher, Mr. Hand (Walston). The funniest scene in the movie is when Hand tells Jeff to report the front office, and Jeff shoots back nonchalantly, ""You d*ck!""The special features are intersting. The soundtrack highlights really bring back memories (I've always loved music from the 1980s'), while the featurette and the commentary by writer Cameron Crowe and director Amy Heckerling is truly informative and funny. For further enjoyment, try spotting small roles by future stars Anthony Edwards, Eric Stoltz, and Nicolas Cage (credited here under his real name, Nicolas Coppola).""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" is an absolute laugh riot that will brighten up your day and put a smile on your face.

After watching this hilarious and downright touching film, you wonder why Phoebe Cates isn't a bigger star.

64404,A2582KMXLK2P06,0783233078,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I wasn't expecting much out of Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  I mean we've all seen dozens of teen movies where the teens hang around school and have fun in typical generic fashion, however this movie does it much better than most.  The question is -the mysterious question- is *what* makes this movie better than the others.  To that I have no conclusive answer.  I can say this- the acting is better than most, and the actors and actresses are top-notch and memorable but... there's more to it than that.  The storytelling is really good as well.  You actually care about all the dilemmas these teens find themselves involved in.I actually really love the ""cool, totally gnarly"" drugged out long-haired guy who had no desire whatsoever to participate in any useful or constructive way during history class and kept irritating the strict and humorless teacher as a result.  The segment where the kid orders a pizza is the highlight of the communication between the student and teacher.  Honestly every segment with this kid is absolutely priceless, and the way the teacher got his revenge at the end was terrific thanks to the timing (and the location- the teacher walks into the teens bedroom where he's smoking dope and looking at pictures of naked women and you can tell the nature of this environment totally offended the teacher, lol).The other kid who believes he can get any girl he wants and carelessly knocks up the girl that his friend is trying to impress leads to some rather serious and memorable moments.  Perhaps a little awkward and offensive how they handled the abortion segment and brushed it off as no big deal.  I can see people having a problem with this.  Actually this movie does a REALLY spectacular job showing the awkwardness of a girl and boy trying to impress each other and not having a clue how to handle the situation, so several odd things take place between the two of them.  Oh and let's not forget the teen behind the cash register having to deal with a pesky unsatisfied customer who demands his money back- this is yet another example of fantastic writing.Oh and the soundtrack is highly recommended for all fans of late 70's/early 80's music.  The Cars ""Moving In Stereo"", Jackson Browne's ""Somebody's Baby"", Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"", The Go Go's ""We've Got the Beat"", Elvis Costello, Billy Squier and several other famous artists all in one amazing package!  Given the fact Fast Times at Ridgemont High was released in the early 80's, it captures the atmosphere of both the 70's rock scene and the brand new (at the time) new wave scene, and it's a wonderful experience watching a movie caught between two crucial periods in music history.Overall, yeah a good portion of the storytelling is crude and resembles the Porky films to an extent, but old school movies like these are sort of edgy and have enough quality storyline and joke segments that they're harmless fun as far as I can see.

Our present social environment is too politically correct and repressive for it to get the green light from a major studio.  Regardless of what one thinks of Sean Penn personally, he is a dynamic and gifted actor.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in his role as Spicoli.  He is marvelous and the name of the would be surfer still evokes laughter from just about everybody I know.  Yet, the good times would be censored today as saying ""He's a f-g"" is not even remotely acceptable in the new century's Hollywood.  A comment like Mike Damone's that someone was a wuss, meaning a cross between a whimp and a p-ssy would probably be deleted from the final product.  One simply does not toss around a word like ""p-ssy"" in 2005.  Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stacy is a feminine and amazing triumph and the swimsuit scenes are more than memorable; however, the plot concerning her is more complex than we originally realized.  Twenty years later her travails would have to be radically altered.  In 1982, she was clearly depicted as a casualty of the sexual revolution.  By the final frames, despite her fellatio practice with Phoebe Cates and her one date hook-ups, she has decided that sex is not an end in itself.  She pines for romance.  Stacy learns a painful lesson that many girls would not be exposed to by the motion picture industry today.  To do so would make them feel as if they were distributing reactionary conservative propaganda instead of entertaining.  Other than AIDS, sex is usually depicted as being without cost, or, if there are costs, then they are not of any serious importance.  Stacy's experiences clash defiantly with our conventional wisdom.  She lusts not carnal lust but a meaningful connection with another human being.  The kind of intertwining that robotically occurs between two bodies is superflous to her needs.  In this way the film becomes an advertisement for restraint and self-control.Another way in which Fast Times... stands athwart our current path can be found in the ""Kill Lincoln"" buttons and displays the students wear before the big football game. Such items would never make it past a hall monitor in today's public schools.  Slogans like those would be deemed a sign of pathology and possibly warrant suspension.  Unfortunately for us, subject matter that is funny is now often condemned as being ""hurtful"" and ""hateful.""

I was about 15.  Watching it now at 34 really takes me back.  The movie gets so many things right about high school life in the 1980s.  FAST TIMES is a 5 star movie for we who were born around the mid-60s.  The things we did...and the things we WISHED we were doing.So...why did I give it only 4 stars?  The sound on the DVD was a bit disappointing.  All that great 80s music...in mono!  I read somewhere that it was originally made that way.  Sometimes there was some popping in the sound too.  What a shame. The picture, which is anamorphic widescreen, is quite a bit better.  Only a little scratchy here and there.  And Phoebe Cates looks like a shimmering princess...her inviting eyes...and her bright red lips that just seem to call out to you...oh!  Sorry.  Anyway, it all looks great.As for extras, its not too bad!  I haven't listened yet to the commentary by the writer and director.  There's some other features like production notes and cast notes.  There is even a feature that allows you to skip to different parts of the movie to view the &quot;Hangouts of Ridgemont high&quot; and &quot;music highlights&quot;.  Those are nice to have.  The documentary wouldn't run correctly on my PC-based DVD system (looked GREAT though).  However, the trailer was terrific!  I remember now why I got my friend Kevin Sloan, who looked a bit older than me but was also about 15, to buy my ticket.  God I miss those times!  There's a lot of great memories tied to this flick.

64409,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0783233078,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[4, 6]","This is actually more of an interesting movie than we would be inclined to give it credit for. It basically shows us the lives of different types of high school students. (Not to mention some teachers.)Stacey and Linda are interesting. Stacey is the young naive girl ever ready to shed her virginity. She follows the advice of her friend Linda (who means well), but does not think as much as she should. Stacey ends up getting hurt, but she grows to the point where she sees that having love and friendship is much nicer than simple sex.Linda is the more sexually experienced girl, but rather predictably, she gets hurt with her own fascination.Mark and Damone are an interesting pair. Damone is the ever sexual predator. But he carries a charm despite his repulsive actions. And to some extent, he does realize that some of his actions were wrong.Mark is the 'geek.' But we also come to realize that he is not only on the smarter side, but he is in fact a really nice person. Undoubtedly, under Linda's advice, Stacey gets upset when Mark isn't ready for sex. But the truth is that just because Mark wasn't ready for sex, that did NOT mean he didn't care about Stacey. And soon afterwards, Stacey gets HURT badly. (Going back to Mark, there is something really funny about how everyone tries to see his answers during the final exam.)Charles Jefferson is the one weak link here. He is a stereotypical Jock, and he offers no real personality. The wreck of his car is an annoying intrusion, and it really doesn't fit. Unlike the other characters, he does no real growing.Undoubtedly, the favorite pair in this movie is Sean Penn and Mr. Hand. While they have a bad teacher/student relationship, at times it looks like a father/son relationship. Mr. Hand is hard, but he is fair: ""Get used to doing your own business on your own time. You wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss U.S. History would you?"" As hard as Mr. Hand gets, he is right when he says: ""This class is for your own benefit."" The reconciliation of Mr. Hand and Sean Penn is drawn rather well.Moving on, Stacey's brother Brad is worth mentioning as well. He is probably the closest to a 'normal kid.' He works hard in jobs he really doesn't like; but he knows he needs the money. In an especially sympathetic moment, he is brutally fired from his job for a DUMB reason. And he is especially helpful to Stacey when she has BIG problem. In many ways, it's so appropriate that Brad has his moment of glory in the last scene.Another character worth mentioning is the eccentric Mr. Vargas. He appears to be a strange teacher, but he is really likable: ""Look, I am a little slow today. I just switched to SANKA. So PLEASE, have a heart."" There is something utterly comical about how the students are shocked when they see that Mr. Vargas's wife is especially beautiful. Like Mark, he is strange, but nice, as well as smart.In all honesty, this is not just empty comedy. It shows us real students who have weaknesses and problems. But they are also likable and even Damone has some notable redeeming qualities. The teachers are not without likable qualities either.This movie is worthy of at least a chance.",3,Empty Comedy?

I hadn't remembered just how dark this film is and how the lives these kids lead are really more mature than they are ready for.  I think it is a wonderfully accurate depiction of the teen lifestyle.  Having sex at 15, when many adults are not prepared for its repercussions, is simply part of their lives.  Drugs aren't really touched on so much (except for surfer marijuana use which is played for laughs), but the character of Stacy is confronted with the reality of pregnancy and subsequent abortion (although after the event, she doesn't really seem to suffer) after a one-time encounter in her pool changing room.So, okay, maybe it's not so realistic, but, hey, it's got a great cast of then-unknowns like: Phoebe Cates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Sean Penn, Judge Reinhold, Eric Stoltz, and blink-and-you'll-miss-him Nicolas Cage.  As well as an insightful screenplay by Cameron Crowe and spot-on direction from Amy Heckerling.A note on the commentary from Crowe and Heckerling:  while not terribly enlightening about the process of movie-making, one does get the impression that everyone had fun making the film, and they two seem to be having fun making this commentary.  Interestingly, it continues on well past the end of the film--almost ten minutes after.  Which isn't so entertaining, having to look at a black screen and all, but is the first time I have seen this happen.Also included: Reliving Our Fast Times at Ridgemont HighThis short documentary included on the Collector's Edition DVD and consisting mostly of interviews with the cast and director--including, surprisingly, Sean Penn!--and longish clips from the film (which, presumably, you had just watched) is entertaining, but only relatively informative.It's good, though, to revisit the cast members twenty years later and see how they have changed (all except for director Heckerling appear to have aged).  Several cast members are missing including Cates and Leigh, but the most notable absence is that of screenwriter/novelist Cameron Crowe, although he is well spoken of and pictures of him at the time are shown.  He is, however, present on the film's commentary.Enlightening enough on the subject of how fun the film was to make and how the casting process went about, and all in all a pleasant expenditure of thirty minutes.",5,Holds up over time,1015545600,"03 8, 2002",2002,2396,"['had', ""n't"", 'really', 'watched', 'teen', 'years', 'was', 'happy', 'revisit', 'characters', 'had', ""n't"", 'remembered', 'just', 'how', 'dark', 'film', 'how', 'lives', 'kids', 'lead', 'are', 'really', 'more', 'mature', 'are', 'ready', 'think', 'wonderfully', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'teen', 'lifestyle', 'Having', 'sex', '15', 'when', 'many', 'adults', 'are', 'not', 'prepared', 'repercussions', 'simply', 'part', 'lives', 'Drugs', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'touched', 'so', 'much', 'surfer', 'marijuana', 'use', 'played', 'laughs', 'character', 'Stacy', 'confronted', 'reality', 'pregnancy', 'subsequent', 'abortion', 'event', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'suffer', 'one-time', 'encounter', 'pool', 'changing', 'room.So', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'realistic', 'hey', 'got', 'great', 'cast', 'then-unknowns', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-him"", 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'As', 'well', 'insightful', 'screenplay', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'spot-on', 'direction', 'Amy', 'Heckerling.A', 'note', 'commentary', 'Crowe', 'Heckerling', 'not', 'terribly', 'enlightening', 'process', 'movie-making', 'one', 'get', 'impression', 'everyone', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'two', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'making', 'commentary', 'Interestingly', 'well', 'end', 'film', 'almost', 'minutes', 'Which', ""n't"", 'so', 'entertaining', 'having', 'look', 'black', 'screen', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'happen.Also', 'included', 'Reliving', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'HighThis', 'short', 'documentary', 'included', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'consisting', 'mostly', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'longish', 'clips', 'film', 'presumably', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'entertaining', 'only', 'relatively', 'informative.It', 'good', 'though', 'revisit', 'cast', 'members', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'see', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'director', 'Heckerling', 'appear', 'have', 'aged', 'Several', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'missing', 'including', 'Cates', 'Leigh', 'most', 'notable', 'absence', 'screenwriter/novelist', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'well', 'spoken', 'pictures', 'time', 'are', 'shown', 'however', 'present', 'film', 'commentary.Enlightening', 'enough', 'subject', 'how', 'fun', 'film', 'was', 'make', 'how', 'casting', 'process', 'went', 'pleasant', 'expenditure', 'thirty', 'minutes']",N/A

64422,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0783233078,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 3]","One of the alltime high school comedy classics harks back to 1982, based on a book written by Cameron Crowe, who disguised himself as a high schooler to get the characters and stories for said book.  Amy Heckerling's movie version of the guys, gals, their shenanigans, and trials and tribulations of the students at Ridgemont High makes this a snapshot of 80's pop culture, full of memorable characters.If I could do it over again, I'd probably hang out with the crowd of Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn), the blonde, long-haired surfer dude with David Lee Roth attitude who some say was ""stoned since the third grade.""  That's accurate enough, as he and his buds vacate the orange VW van, a puff of smoke emerges from within, just like in Scooby Doo.  His calling Mr. Hand (Ray Walston), the overstrict, overdisciplinary, Steve McGarrett (Hawaii Five-Oh) imitating history professor, a profanity is a classic, as is the pizza-in-the-class scene.  For Spicoli, surfing's not a sport.  It's a way of looking at the waves and saying, ""Hey bud, let's party!""If not, maybe with Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), ace ticket scalper and the king of cool in the school, the cooler guy who takes in the nerd as his friend.  I could've used someone like him in high school.  According to him, ""the attitude dictates that you don't care if [a girl] comes, stays, l-ys, or prays, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping, and when that happens, you have the attitude.""  He is confidence man and propper-up of the shorter and shier Mark ""the Rat"" Ratner (Brian Backer), who gets his five point plan for free.But also among most important characters is that of sweet and innocent-looking blonde Stacey Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her sultry brunette friend Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates), who are the female versions of the Ratner/Damone relationship, unexperienced vs. experienced.  The lesson with the carrot is one example, as is Stacey's nighttime jaunt with a 26-year old stereo salesman, her first experience so to say.  But there's a wowser of a fantasy scene involving Linda emerging from the swimming pool, a misty spray behind her, disrobing herself for Brad (Judge Reinhold), Stacey's brother.  And guess what Brad's doing in the bathroom?  Stacey does grow up through her trials more grown up and aware, and for the better.The hierarchy of fast food joints detailed in Crowe's book isn't touched on, but it's clear that All American Burger is at the top, and when Brad loses his job to an obnoxious customer, his social standing falls as a result.There's so much memorable dialogue here.  When Spicoli and his surfer buds take their shirts off at the All American Burger, Brad points at the sign, ""No shirt, no shoes, no dice"", then saying, ""Learn it, know it, live it.""  And science teacher Mr. Vargas' (Vince Schiavelli) first words to his class is great:  ""I'm a little slow today.  I just switched to Sanka, so have a heart.""And the hallmarks of 80's youth is evident:  the three Pat Benatar lookalikes, the Pacman videogames at Ridgemont Mall, music by the Go-Go's, and the main theme song that comes through, Jackson Browne's ""Somebody's Baby.""  Only an 80's dude could come up with this interpretation of why the Americans declared independence:  ""Jefferson said, 'we left this England place because it was so bogus so if we don't get some cool rules ourselves pronto, we'll be bogus too, yeah?""  Yeah, Spicoli, spot on, and this is coming from a history major.This is an early role for Nicholas Cage, billed as Nicholas Coppola (Brad's friend) and Eric Stoltz (Spicoli's surfer bud)It's been a while since I've seen this, and in reference to Damone, my toes are still tapping after two decades, dude!",5,Classic 80's high school comedy still has my toes tapping,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,3706,"['One', 'alltime', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'classics', 'back', '1982', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'who', 'disguised', 'high', 'schooler', 'get', 'characters', 'stories', 'said', 'book', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'movie', 'version', 'guys', 'gals', 'shenanigans', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'students', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'snapshot', '80', 'pop', 'culture', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters.If', 'could', 'do', 'over', 'again', ""'d"", 'probably', 'hang', 'out', 'crowd', 'Jeff', 'Spicoli', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'blonde', 'long-haired', 'surfer', 'dude', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', 'attitude', 'who', 'say', 'was', 'stoned', 'third', 'grade', 'accurate', 'enough', 'buds', 'vacate', 'orange', 'VW', 'van', 'puff', 'smoke', 'emerges', 'just', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'calling', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'overstrict', 'overdisciplinary', 'Steve', 'McGarrett', 'Hawaii', 'Five-Oh', 'imitating', 'history', 'professor', 'profanity', 'classic', 'pizza-in-the-class', 'scene', 'Spicoli', 'surfing', 'not', 'sport', 'way', 'looking', 'waves', 'saying', 'Hey', 'bud', 'let', 'party', 'not', 'maybe', 'Mike', 'Damone', 'Robert', 'Romanus', 'ace', 'ticket', 'scalper', 'king', 'cool', 'school', 'cooler', 'guy', 'who', 'nerd', 'friend', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'someone', 'high', 'school', 'According', 'attitude', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', '[', 'girl', ']', 'stays', 'l-ys', 'prays', 'toes', 'are', 'still', 'tapping', 'when', 'have', 'attitude', 'confidence', 'man', 'propper-up', 'shorter', 'shier', 'Mark', 'Rat', 'Ratner', 'Brian', 'Backer', 'who', 'five', 'point', 'plan', 'free.But', 'also', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'sweet', 'innocent-looking', 'blonde', 'Stacey', 'Hamilton', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'sultry', 'brunette', 'friend', 'Linda', 'Barrett', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'who', 'are', 'female', 'versions', 'Ratner/Damone', 'relationship', 'unexperienced', 'vs.', 'experienced', 'lesson', 'carrot', 'one', 'example', 'Stacey', 'nighttime', 'jaunt', '26-year', 'old', 'stereo', 'salesman', 'first', 'experience', 'so', 'say', 'wowser', 'fantasy', 'scene', 'involving', 'Linda', 'emerging', 'swimming', 'pool', 'misty', 'spray', 'disrobing', 'Brad', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Stacey', 'brother', 'guess', 'what', 'Brad', 'doing', 'bathroom', 'Stacey', 'grow', 'up', 'trials', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'aware', 'better.The', 'hierarchy', 'fast', 'food', 'joints', 'detailed', 'Crowe', 'book', ""n't"", 'touched', 'clear', 'American', 'Burger', 'top', 'when', 'Brad', 'job', 'obnoxious', 'customer', 'social', 'standing', 'result.There', 'so', 'much', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'here', 'When', 'Spicoli', 'surfer', 'buds', 'take', 'shirts', 'American', 'Burger', 'Brad', 'points', 'sign', 'shirt', 'shoes', 'dice', 'then', 'saying', 'Learn', 'know', 'science', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Vargas', 'Vince', 'Schiavelli', 'first', 'words', 'class', 'great', ""'m"", 'little', 'slow', 'today', 'just', 'switched', 'Sanka', 'so', 'have', 'heart', 'hallmarks', '80', 'youth', 'evident', 'three', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'lookalikes', 'Pacman', 'videogames', 'Ridgemont', 'Mall', 'music', 'Go-Go', 'main', 'theme', 'song', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'Somebody', 'Baby', 'Only', '80', 'dude', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'interpretation', 'why', 'Americans', 'declared', 'independence', 'Jefferson', 'said', 'left', 'England', 'place', 'was', 'so', 'bogus', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cool', 'rules', 'pronto', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bogus', 'too', 'Yeah', 'Spicoli', 'spot', 'coming', 'history', 'major.This', 'early', 'role', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'billed', 'Nicholas', 'Coppola', 'Brad', 'friend', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Spicoli', 'surfer', 'bud', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reference', 'Damone', 'toes', 'are', 'still', 'tapping', 'two', 'decades', 'dude']",N/A

This is because it doesn't impose any bogus narrative arc or spurious goal on its vignette-structured observations - its rapid, seasonal, jump-cutting storyline remains true to the developing emotional lives of its characters, where everything of the moment seems life or death, but everything flies by so quickly.  Potential traumas that might have been Ponderous Issues in a lesser film, such as drugs, teenage pregnancy or abortion are treated lightly (even if the emotion behind them are not) and absorbed into the rush of the film (although the film's authenticity quotient is somewhat undermined by actors clearly in their 20s playing mid-teens).  This gives the film its joyous energy, but also its poignancy, its admission of transience and failure - images of confinement and death recur, but never heavy-handedly.Heckerling's direction has a freshness usually missing from the genre, mixing reality, dream and fantasy with an irony undercutting some of the screenwriter's lazier assumptions, the latter evincing even at this young age a tendency towards the reactionary.  It is particularly enjoyable to see actors who have subsequently taken themselves Very Seriously, in a comic context - Jennifer Jason Leigh is especially appealing and wide-eyed and funny, like the less smart elder sister of Kirstin Dunst; Sean Penn (I forgive everything!) is hilarious as the Bill/Ted/Butthead/Jay-prototype stoner slacker with a private kind of twisted intelligence.  Despite the explicit content, there is a pervasive 50s air of innocence which avoids the sentimentality of Crowe's later work as a director.

With jargon, attitude, style, and slang included.  Also Ray Walston as Mr. Hand,the history teacher, is played very well also.  The interaction of both charactersin the movie is hilarious.  It is worth seeing just for these parts.I felt the movie also portrayed high school accurately.  Although I did notattend those years, but attended at a much later date, it appeared accurate.The lack of understanding or caring about History in regard to the students in class when Mr. Hand,the history professor is talking, is 100 percent on the mark.  Nobody ever cared about history.This lack of caring is shown in the up and coming leaders and those in charge today.  Youcan see the slow decay of knowledge, which started around this time.  Although I bring this up asa side note, since that isn't what the movie is about.  It just shows an accurate portrayal of high schoolstudents.  If not today, then during that time period of the early 1980s.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Stacy in the movie.I don't know if this movie could havebeen made today with all the moral standards people look at in movies today, in regard to teens portrayed in this movie, especiallythe parts when Stacy meets the stereo salesman.  A throwaway character you don't really feel much sympathy or care muchabout.  A guy that acts too smooth and seems very much into himself only.  What happens after with Stacy and him, I won't get into, but it brings up a lot of serious questionsin an otherwise funny movie.  Recent movies regarding teens are raunchy, but what happens in particular with thestereo salesman left me a little bothered.  Yes, there is other serious moments with Stacy, which I won't get into.  She seemsmore of a troubled teen with absolutely clueless parents.  The mother is shown briefly saying goodnight in one scene and is nevershown again.  She has to turn for help later with an older brother, who isn't much help during the first half of the movie and seems to rely moreon her peers for advice.There are other famous characters, or soon to be famous characters, with their first parts in this particular movie.  Whether for someit was their first movie or had a cameo in other movies beforehand, you can research.I can't recommend this as a family movie since there are some uncomfortable scenes.  The rating is still relevant today.  No matter howlong ago this was made, there are some serious scenes, and fun scenes as well, with nudity.  Occasional language is also included.Overall, as I mentioned, the scenes with Sean Penn are excellent.  I think there should have been more with himand Ray Walston, but of course at the time this was made, who knew they both would be the main attraction for this movie, in my own opinion andprobably many others.  Then again, maybe they both made the right number of appearances, without overdoing it.The Jeff Spicoli character also seems to be featured more prominently on the cover than in past releases, as can be seen with some research on the internet,which shows the staying power of the character.The movie makes me want to wish I had actually gone to high school in the early 1980s but then again,maybe it wouldn't have made any difference.  There was no sequel to this movie, so don't bother looking for it.  As usual, you findyourself watching a whole school year go by in less than a couple hours.  Maybe the only difference is that the movie starts in the mall before school starts and itends after school has ended for the year.  The one thing I noticed is how fast the style of clothing changed.  Since this was filmed in the very early 1980s or filmed in 1981 or 1982, you don't see too much of the late 1970s style of clothes.  Going to high school in a later time, during my years, you would hardly notice the style changes over the course of not just one year, but 4 years.  In fact some of the clothes you find in this movie, you could possibly wear today.  It makes you wonder if we are stuck in a period of repetitive blandness, but maybe I'm the only one thinking that.  It seems like creativity went awayduring this time.

My friends began constantly saying ""narly,""  sometimes re-enacting scenes from the movie.  It took me 20+ years, but I finally got around to seeing it for myself.Come to find out, I had some misconceptions about the film.  First of all, I knew that it was Sean Penn's breakthrough flick, but I had no idea it had so many other big names.  Judge Reinhold, Ray Walston, Jennifer Jason Lee, Phoebe Cates, Eric Stoltz, Forrest Whittaker,  Nicholas Cage and Anthony Edwards all had parts that ranged from major to ornamental.I also did not realize what the film was about.  I always figured it was all about Penn's character (Spigolli).  After all, mugs of Sean Penn are what're most closely associated with FAST TIMES.  I was a bit surprised to find out that Spigolli was not the focus of the film.  Rather, he is a character who more-or-less kind of floats through the storyline.Perhaps most unexpected was that the movie is more of a satire than anything else.  From the cover one would think that it glorifies teen sex, drug addiction, reckless driving, skipping school & other juvenile pranks.  Instead, it has a subtle message that says ""If this is what you do, this is what will happen.""  It does not become preachy, but it does show the downside of what many highschoolers would call ""good fun.""While I am usually not too big on bonus features, the DVD does have a good (although a bit long-winded) ""retrospective"" of many of the major actors from the movie.  Sean Penn, Judge Reinhold and Eric Stoltz (among others) share their thoughts on the film 20 years later.  The only disappointing thing is that they were apparently unable to track down (or coerce?) Jennifer Jason Lee & Phoebe Cates to come back & offer their points of view on FAST TIMES.If you're looking for a good party movie that actually has some social commentary, FAST TIMES is a film worth checking out.  The fact that Jennifer Jason Lee & Phoebe Cates remove their tops only adds to the allure of this DVD.  In the end, there are those who graduate from Ridgemont High and there are those who don't.

Jennifer Jason Leigh is perfect as the young innocent fifteen-year-old. (Amazingly she was about 20 when she played it, but you'd never know it.)And Phoebe Cates... As Amy Heckerling says in a featurette: The boys just loves Phoebe... the rental cassettes always track a lot around the place where she takes off her top, they've been freeze-framed so much...&quot; Which is as good a reason as any to get the DVD version, they slow-mo and freeze-frame a lot better... But seriously, Phoebe is a wonderful actress who has been woefully underused by Hollywood. And she is also just stunningly cute to boot. Even if this film had nothing else going for it, get it for her. (She is also excellent in the later film Princess Caraboo, and she is buck nude in the light &quot;Paradise&quot;, which I hope they will put on DVD soon.)Eolake",5,A pleasure on so many levels,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,1402,"['quot', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'quot', 'strong', 'contender', 'best', 'teen', 'movie', 'eighties.The', 'case', 'movie', 'easy', 'make', 'written', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'who', 'wrote', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'directed', 'Director', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'who', 'apart', 'being', 'awefully', 'cute', 'made', 'such', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'Clueless', 'funny', 'real', 'magnificent', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'where', 'unknowns', 'then.The', 'surfer/stoner', 'famously', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'awesome', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'perfect', 'young', 'innocent', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Amazingly', 'was', 'about', '20', 'when', 'played', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'featurette', 'boys', 'just', 'loves', 'Phoebe', 'rental', 'cassettes', 'always', 'track', 'lot', 'place', 'where', 'top', ""'ve"", 'been', 'freeze-framed', 'so', 'much', 'quot', 'Which', 'as', 'good', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'version', 'slow-mo', 'freeze-frame', 'lot', 'better', 'seriously', 'Phoebe', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'who', 'been', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'just', 'stunningly', 'cute', 'boot', 'Even', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'get', 'also', 'excellent', 'later', 'film', 'Princess', 'Caraboo', 'buck', 'nude', 'light', 'quot', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'hope', 'will', 'put', 'DVD', 'soon', 'Eolake']",N/A

Sean Penn will forever be remembered as the clueless surfer dude, Jeff Spicoli, and the late Ray Walston will probably also be associated with his role as Mr. Hand, Spicoli's teacher and nemesis (although this is, perhaps, too strong and inappropriate of a word to describe their teacher-student relationship). You will always remember the classic scenes of Mr. Hand insisting that he does not want his students to waste his time, and Spicoli challenges him, saying something to the effect of, ""If you are here and it is your time, and I am here and it is my time, doesn't that make it our time?"" This film, from the early 80s, was one of the first films I remember watching in my childhood. I was not even close to being a teenager when it came out. But I remember it making a lot of impact on me... I was just coming to understand some of the issues with which the film dealt. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Stacy a high school girl with no grand ambitions but who doesn't mind imagining herself with different guys and eventually ending up having sex with them. At some point she ends up pregnant and gets an abortion which is a pretty heavy issue with which to deal in such a film. Her best friend is played by Phoebe Cates, of whom we have not seen much in the last few decade or so. Many of the players are not even in the public eye to my knowledge, at least not to the level that Jennifer Jason Leigh or Sean Penn have been.

Ridgemont High was Venice, Taft, Mira Costa, Culver, West, SaMoHi, or any number of other high schools populating the coastal LA landscape.  And whether we identified more with Brad, Stacy, Rat, Damone, Linda, Spicoli, or Arnold, this was our story and our experience.We all knew kids like that weasel Desmond.  We all had teachers like Mr. Vargas or Mr. Hand.  We all had the fumbling, awkward dates in which our lack of self-confidence and hyper awareness of our own geekitude sabotaged our more base desires.Sure, every generation has something similar. But there was something unique about those of us born in the mid-60's who came of age in the time of Blondie and Led Zeppelin, Elvis Costello and Van Halen, Fleetwood Mac and Oingo Boingo, Tom Petty and Earth, Wind & Fire, Jackone Brown and Blue Oyster Cult.  It was after the sexual revolution, but before the sexual explosion.  It was pre-AIDS but post-Crabs.  It was when pot just mellowed you out and cocaine was restricted to Hollywood Big Shots.The real charm of Fast Times is that it captures exactly the essence of coastal LA in the late 70's - early 80's.  For some this is just a clever little comedy, but for us - we who lived it - it's a slice right out of our life, and it elicits the same sort of nostalgic laughter and bittersweetness that opening our yearbook does.",5,Like opening my senior yearbook,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1558,"['everyone', 'else', 'generation', 'especially', 'who', 'were', 'Southern', 'California', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'very', 'personal', 'level.This', 'was', 'slice', 'lives', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'was', 'Venice', 'Taft', 'Mira', 'Costa', 'Culver', 'West', 'SaMoHi', 'number', 'other', 'high', 'schools', 'populating', 'coastal', 'LA', 'landscape', 'identified', 'more', 'Brad', 'Stacy', 'Rat', 'Damone', 'Linda', 'Spicoli', 'Arnold', 'was', 'story', 'experience.We', 'knew', 'kids', 'weasel', 'Desmond', 'had', 'teachers', 'Mr.', 'Vargas', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'had', 'fumbling', 'awkward', 'lack', 'self-confidence', 'hyper', 'awareness', 'own', 'geekitude', 'sabotaged', 'more', 'base', 'desires.Sure', 'generation', 'something', 'similar', 'was', 'something', 'unique', 'born', 'mid-60', 'who', 'came', 'age', 'time', 'Blondie', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Oingo', 'Boingo', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'Jackone', 'Brown', 'Blue', 'Oyster', 'Cult', 'was', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'sexual', 'explosion', 'was', 'pre-AIDS', 'post-Crabs', 'was', 'when', 'pot', 'just', 'mellowed', 'cocaine', 'was', 'restricted', 'Hollywood', 'Big', 'Shots.The', 'real', 'charm', 'Fast', 'Times', 'exactly', 'essence', 'coastal', 'LA', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'just', 'clever', 'little', 'comedy', 'who', 'lived', 'slice', 'right', 'life', 'same', 'sort', 'nostalgic', 'laughter', 'bittersweetness', 'opening', 'yearbook']",N/A
64446,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783233078,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","`Fast Times' is the quintessential high school flick.  What `American Graffiti' did to put high school films on the map, `Fast Times' did to expand and redefine the genre.  Every hijinks film that has succeeded in  recent history owes a debt of gratitude to this film for resetting the  boundaries.This is an adaptation of Cameron Crowe's book about his  undercover high school experience.  What differentiates `Fast Times' from  its predecessors is its realism, since it was based on the actual  experiences of real kids.  The skits weren't as outrageous as other high  school flicks, and indeed this wasn't that funny a film.  But it struck a  chord, because of its frank depiction of the issues with which kids really  struggle.This film was controversial from the start.  Universal almost  didn't release it because they thought it would bomb.  Profanity, nudity  and sexual situations were just not done in high school films.  This was  the first such film to earn an R rating.  It was actually rated X until  they toned down the sex scene between Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Mike  (Robert Romanus).  The studio was sure that the only audience the film had  would be prohibited from seeing it.  Finally, Universal agreed to release  it on the west coast only with no promotional budget.  It exploded and the  rest is history.Though this was an ensemble project, the film really  belonged to Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold.  All three  gave outstanding performances and went on to successful acting careers.  This part was perfect for Penn who has made a career of playing offbeat  maverick types.  Penn may have peaked in this film, not because his skills  have diminished, but because he has not and may never again find a role  into which he can slip so seamlessly.  Jennifer Jason Leigh did not one,  but two nude sex scenes; a very gutsy move for a 20 year old actress at the  time.  In this film she became a model for the sweet girl trying to lose  her innocence.Reinhold spring boarded off this film to land  numerous successful roles in the 1980's and 90's most notably the Beverly  Hills Cop series of films.  The film also helped launch successful careers  for Eric Stolz, Forrest Whittaker, Phoebe Cates and Anthony Edwards.  Nicholas Cage was also an extra in this film and was director Amy  Heckerling's second choice for Spicoli.  She went with Penn because Cage  (then going by Nicholas Coppola) was only 17, and he was limited as to how  many hours he could work because he was a minor.The DVD has an  interesting retrospective, produced very recently, where the director and  many of the actors give their stories of the making of the film.  The only  disappointment with the DVD was that they didn't go back and re-master the  sound, which was still mono.This film changed the landscape for high  school films.  Though it has been eclipsed by numerous more recent films,  it stands as a trailblazer that made them all possible.  I rated it a 9/10.  Anyone who liked `Clueless' or `American Pie' and hasn't seen `Fast Times'  should go back and see where it all started.",5,The Quintessential High School Flick,962496000,"07 2, 2000",2000,3117,"['Fast', 'Times', 'quintessential', 'high', 'school', 'flick', 'What', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'did', 'put', 'high', 'school', 'films', 'map', 'Fast', 'Times', 'did', 'expand', 'redefine', 'genre', 'hijinks', 'film', 'succeeded', 'recent', 'history', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'film', 'resetting', 'boundaries.This', 'adaptation', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'book', 'undercover', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'What', 'Fast', 'Times', 'predecessors', 'realism', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'experiences', 'real', 'kids', 'skits', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'outrageous', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'flicks', 'indeed', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'film', 'struck', 'chord', 'frank', 'depiction', 'issues', 'kids', 'really', 'struggle.This', 'film', 'was', 'controversial', 'start', 'Universal', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'thought', 'would', 'bomb', 'Profanity', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'done', 'high', 'school', 'films', 'was', 'first', 'such', 'film', 'earn', 'R', 'rating', 'was', 'actually', 'rated', 'X', 'toned', 'down', 'sex', 'scene', 'Stacy', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Mike', 'Robert', 'Romanus', 'studio', 'was', 'sure', 'only', 'audience', 'film', 'had', 'would', 'be', 'prohibited', 'seeing', 'Finally', 'Universal', 'agreed', 'release', 'west', 'coast', 'only', 'promotional', 'budget', 'exploded', 'rest', 'was', 'ensemble', 'project', 'film', 'really', 'belonged', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'three', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'went', 'successful', 'acting', 'careers', 'part', 'was', 'perfect', 'Penn', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'offbeat', 'maverick', 'types', 'Penn', 'may', 'have', 'peaked', 'film', 'not', 'skills', 'have', 'diminished', 'not', 'may', 'never', 'again', 'find', 'role', 'can', 'slip', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'nude', 'sex', 'scenes', 'very', 'gutsy', 'move', '20', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'time', 'film', 'became', 'model', 'sweet', 'girl', 'trying', 'lose', 'innocence.Reinhold', 'spring', 'boarded', 'off', 'film', 'land', 'numerous', 'successful', 'roles', '1980', '90', 'most', 'notably', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'series', 'films', 'film', 'also', 'helped', 'launch', 'successful', 'careers', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'Forrest', 'Whittaker', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'was', 'also', 'extra', 'film', 'was', 'director', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'second', 'choice', 'Spicoli', 'went', 'Penn', 'Cage', 'then', 'going', 'Nicholas', 'Coppola', 'was', 'only', '17', 'was', 'limited', 'how', 'many', 'hours', 'could', 'work', 'was', 'minor.The', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'retrospective', 'produced', 'very', 'recently', 'where', 'director', 'many', 'actors', 'give', 'stories', 'making', 'film', 'only', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 're-master', 'sound', 'was', 'still', 'mono.This', 'film', 'changed', 'landscape', 'high', 'school', 'films', 'been', 'eclipsed', 'numerous', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'trailblazer', 'made', 'possible', 'rated', '9/10', 'Anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'Clueless', 'American', 'Pie', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Fast', 'Times', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'where', 'started']",N/A

What teenager anywhere in the world is not obsessed about sex, video/arcade games etc and has to deal with peer pressure issues?I remember my first introduction to ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" came in the form of the soundtrack which my brother bought all those years ago.  I remember I really liked the tracks which were mostly written by the individual members of one of my all-time favourite groups The Eagles or as in the case of Jackson Browne those who wrote songs for them.  Not all the great tracks from the film are on the album though as strangely enough the Go-Gos and Tom Petty's tracks are not there which may be because of contractual reasons but it was still a good album for a soundtrack.Sean Penn is very good as Spicoli but the rest of the cast also turn in very creditable performances as well and documents high school life in the U.S. in the 80s as well as ""American Grafitti"" does for the 50s.

It is not just another teen movie, though to the casual observer it might be. No, it is a time capsule into the SoCal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late 70's and 80's as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the U.S. circa 1982.Sean Penn (whom I'm not a big fan of) as Jeff Spicoli is truly inspired! I find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes. What an awesome character. When he says, ""You d*ck!"" to Ray Walston's Mr. Hand (another inspired and forever memorable character), you just wanna roll on the floor!Jennifer Jason Leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality. Phoebe Cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly ""mature"" relationship anyone has (with a college boy) is fresh and believable. Judge Reinhold as Leigh's older brother is inspired.Mike Damone is a sleaze and a great character (if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to).In fact, this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars. The script by a very young Cameron Crowe is brilliant!Fast Times came out at roughly the same time as The Last American Virgin and several years after Rock and Roll High School. Neither of those other films is anywhere on par with Fast Times. At times, light and airy, Fast Times carries a serious ""message"" that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how. It is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film. The adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home: truly, teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents.While Last American Virgin approached some of the same topics that Fast Times does, it did it in a more sinister way. Fast Times doesn't gloss over teen age problems, but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his/herself deals with them.Yes, it's a comedy and yes it is funny, but it is not just a film for kids.",4,Not just another teen movie!,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,2133,"['Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'clever', 'insightful', 'wicked', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'teen', 'movie', 'casual', 'observer', 'might', 'be', 'No', 'time', 'capsule', 'SoCal', 'lifestyle', 'pervaded', 'much', 'films', 'late', '70', '80', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'capsule', 'mindset', 'teenagers', 'U.S.', 'circa', '1982.Sean', 'Penn', 'whom', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Spicoli', 'truly', 'inspired', 'find', 'day', 'trying', 'imitate', 'dead', 'surfer', 'What', 'awesome', 'character', 'When', 'd*ck', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'inspired', 'forever', 'memorable', 'character', 'just', 'wan', 'roll', 'floor', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'nicely', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'junior', 'high', 'girl', 'struggling', 'sexuality', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'truly', 'mature', 'relationship', 'anyone', 'college', 'boy', 'fresh', 'believable', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Leigh', 'older', 'brother', 'inspired.Mike', 'Damone', 'sleaze', 'great', 'character', 'only', 'really', 'believed', 'as', 'much', 'others', '.In', 'fact', 'film', 'huge', 'numbers', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'stars', 'script', 'very', 'young', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'brilliant', 'Fast', 'Times', 'came', 'out', 'roughly', 'same', 'time', 'Last', 'American', 'Virgin', 'several', 'years', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'Neither', 'other', 'films', 'anywhere', 'par', 'Fast', 'Times', 'times', 'light', 'airy', 'Fast', 'Times', 'serious', 'message', 'teen', 'agers', 'are', 'truly', 'finding', 'way', 'life', 'best', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'somewhat', 'inspired', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'parents', 'kids', 'film', 'adults', 'see', 'are', 'whom', 'interact', 'home', 'truly', 'teenagers', 'feel', 'young', 'lives', 'are', 'more', 'affected', 'people', 'other', 'parents.While', 'Last', 'American', 'Virgin', 'approached', 'same', 'topics', 'Fast', 'Times', 'did', 'more', 'sinister', 'way', 'Fast', 'Times', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'over', 'teen', 'age', 'problems', 'perspective', 'how', 'teenager', 'his/herself', 'deals', 'them.Yes', 'comedy', 'yes', 'funny', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'kids']",N/A

The extras are slim, and  the bonus soundtrack featuring commentary from directory Amy Heckerling and  writer Cameron Crowe is unenlightening. The original trailer (showing how the studio sold the film to audiences), and the documentary (including  contemporary interviews with several of the players) are nice  bonuses.Like other seminal teen films (e.g., American Grafitti), so many  imitations sprouted in their wake, it's hard to remember the ground that  was broken with the original releases. But this was a truly groundbreaking  film in its attitude and perspective on high school life. Crowe's  undercover study yielded a dead-on portrait, and Heckerling's direction  makes the most of it.As a DVD production, though, the enhancements are  disappointing. The additional soundtrack, featuring the director and  writer in conversation is incredibly insipid, repetitive and  sycophantic.  90% of it is taken up with Heckerling complimenting Crowe, Crowe  complimenting Heckerling, and Heckerling and Crowe drooling over Sean Pean.  Very little of it concerns the actual filmmaking, and, surprisingly, given  the lucidity with which Heckerling and Crowe are able to commit their thoughts to film, they shed very little light on the film itself.Even more maddening is that Heckerling and Crowe often speak of alternate takes and extra footage included in the TV version of the film, yet none of it is included on the DVD.Move: 5 stars.

Meanwhile his little sis, a seemingly innocent Jennifer Jason Leigh, experiments with dating and sex with an amusing pair of misfits, Brian Backer and Robert Romanus.

Munson,"[2, 2]","Several great high school movies were released in the 1980s, including ""Valley Girl"" and ""The Last American Virgin"", but ""Fast Times"" has reached a cult status that no other 80s movie will probably attain.  Set in Southern California, ""Fast Times"" chronicles the lefe of several high school students who attend Ridgemont High School.  Sean Penn stars as Jeff Spicoli, the ""pot head"" who, along with his friends, always show up to school stoned out of their minds.  However, Spicoli soon finds himself in Mr. Hand's (Ray Walston) history class.  Mr. Hand is determined to set Spicoli straight, but it doesn't stop Spicoli from having a pizza delivered to class.Much of the movie takes place in the local mall, where several of the students work.  Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) work at a pizza place, while Mark ""Rat"" Ratner (Brian Backer) works at the movie theater across the mall from the pizza place.  Mark soon begins to like Stacy, but he's unsure of how to approach her, so he gets help from his buddy Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), a smooth-talker who makes his money scalping concert tickets to young kids.  After some of Damone's pointers, Brian and Stacy begin going together, but this is only the beginning for Brian, Mike, and Stacy.Judge Reinhold stars as Brad Hamilton, Stacy's older brother and self-proclaimed ""big man on campus"".  He's been dating his girlfriend for two years, but he decides that he needs his space, so he decides to break up with her, but she beats him to it.  He also has trouble holding down jobs at local fast-food places, but he becomes a hero at the end of the movie.This is an excellent movie.  The story is excellent, and there are several different sub-plots going on at the same time, from Stacy betraying Brian by sleeping with Mike and getting pregnant to Spicoli trying to pass Mr. Hand's history class.  Let's not forget the highlight of the film in which Phoebe Cates emerges from the pool topless.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Having went to high school myself in the early 80s, watching this movie and hearing the great soundtrack which includes the Go Gos and Jackson Browne brings back a lot of memories for me.  Watch this great movie and re-live the 80s.

64461,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,0783233078,JGC,"[4, 4]","""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is the quintessential teen/'80s movie. And it's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of because it's so funny.It's hard to say who my favorite person was in the film because everyone was likeable in their own way. I probably like Jennifer Jason Leigh the best as Stacy because there was a certain charm and innocence to her that none of the other characters really had. Judge Reinhold gave an exceptional performance as Stacy's older brother, Brad. He was just such an '80s type of guy, wouldn't you say? The scene with him in the bathroom when Linda (Phoebe Cates) caught him was just too much. I don't think I ever laughed so hard. Robert Romanus as Mike Damone was so hot. He totally reminded me of Ricky from ""Just One of the Guys"".My favorite part was when Stacy went and got the abortion because you just don't see that in movies, especially teen movies. It is very rare to see consequences of irresponsible behavior depicted in a movie of this genre and I do not know of any other teenage movie that actually has a character get an abortion besides this. Sure they always talk about it, but no one ever has the balls to get one. This was certainly unique in that regard.Sean Penn gave an excellent performance as Mr. Jeff Spicoli, the school's resident loser. Although he's featured on the cover of the DVD the movie is hardly about him and he receives very little screen time, compared to the others. But over time Spicoli has become so identified with this movie since his brief scenes were all very memorable (I especially like the part when he tumbles out of the van).The movie has some occasional cussing and nudity but if you're not a total prude then you certainly won't be offended. If you enjoyed this movie or think you may like it (chances are you will) then I recommend getting the DVD because the bonuses are excellent and the picture quality is stunning. But if you don't have the money (and heaven knows I'm tightening my pocketbook right now) don't worry because it comes on HBO all the time (usually in the early mornings or late at night).""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is totally a movie about nothing.

64473,A34792YZU3EH56,0783233078,J. Swagman,"[1, 1]","The first time I remember even hearing about this movie was in 9th grade. My 9th grade religion teacher was on his favorite topic: how awful pre-marital sex was. For one reason or another this is one of those speeches that stuck in my memory, and I think I remember him pretty much verbatim:""Hollywood movies always portray sex as glamorous. It's not glamorous. The only movie I ever saw that portrayed sex accurately was 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. And I can't recommend it to you because it's rated R, and it's rated R for some very good reasons. But there's a scene in the movie where a high school girl is on a date, and the guy only has one thing on his mind. And they end up having sex in the baseball bleachers and he's on top of her and she just has this look of horror on her face like 'what have I gotten myself into'.""My second encounter with this movie was back in the early days of the internet. We had a prodigy subscription at our house (remember Prodigy?) and I use to waste a lot of time on their movie review archive reading about movies I hadn't seen yet. (Scary how we never grow out of some of these childhood bad habits, isn't it? I still waste a lot of time reading junk on-line).The prodigy review compared this movie to all the other teen sex flicks in the late 70s early 80s which featured a group of boys (the reviewer claimed ""usually Southern"") who went on several amorous adventures and glorious conquests. By contrast ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" provided a much more realistic look by focusing on the unglamorous side of teen sexuality: the disappointing first sexual encounter, the sister's friend walking in on the brother masturbating, and the lady's man who suffers from premature ejaculation. Not to mention the pregnancy and the abortion.Based on these descriptions I always thought ""Fast Times"" would be a gritty somber flick. But then I began to notice I would usually hear it referenced alongside all of the other feel-good teen comedies of the 80s.Over the years I caught bits and pieces of it on TV, but never managed to catch the whole thing straight through. I even sat through a good chunk of a dubbed version on late night Japanese TV, but didn't understand most of it.And so the other day, when I saw it in my video store, I thought I might as well rent it and watch the whole thing beginning to end to see what this film was all about anyway.I suspect I was probably the last person on earth who hasn't seen this film, but just in case there is anyone more out of touch than me let me recount the premise.Journalist and child prodigy Cameron Crowe (whose own autobiographical story is told in the movie ""Almost Famous"") went back to high school at 22. He pretended to be a high school student and wrote a book about the kids he saw around him. Hollywood bought the rights to the book, and made the movie.The book apparently takes a few liberties with the truth (composite characters, a few things switched around) and the movie takes a few liberties with the book, so it is a few steps removed from the real thing, but it is usually marketed as an unflinching look at high school reality.This is a hard movie to classify. Part of it wants to be a serious look at high school problems. Part of it wants to be just another teen comedy. It's a movie that flirts with greatness, but ultimately doesn't really rise to the next level.The DVD extras and the directors commentary offer some interesting insight into the battle with studio executives that helps to explain this. The studio wanted a nice generic teen comedy, and the director and writer had to battle them on a lot of points. Also it was interesting to hear that the director hated most of the songs on the soundtrack as much as I did. The studio insisted all those cheesy soft rock ballads be used in the movie. (Although there are some cool songs snuck in there as well. Another interesting tidbit from the DVD commentary is that it is virtually impossible to get Led Zeppelin songs for sound tracks, but because of Cameron Crowe's relationship with Zeppelin as a rock journalist, they obliged and gave him ""Kashmir"").The film follows several different characters, which helps to keep it interesting, although as a consequence of that none of the plotlines are developed as much as I would have liked. And the Hollywood ending seems a bit tacked on.The film does show the unglamorous side of teen sexuality, but it does not take a puritanical view, and I imagine there is a lot in here my 9th grade religion teacher would disapprove of. The film makers themselves (again on the DVD commentary) say the only reason the film could get make in the first place is that they got in right before the conservative 80s backlash got up to full strength.But well the film may ultimately end on an unsatisfying note, it is certainly an entertaining movie to watch. Like a lot of teen movies, it showcases a lot of young future stars before they became famous.",4,Falls just short of true greatness,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,4962,"['first', 'time', 'remember',

Sure, it could've toned down it's content a bit, but it also gives a good example of growing up around friends in high school, and the pressures  that accompany that time in a person's life.  I would not suggest showing  this film to a small child, but it's good fun for the more mature.  Judge  Rinehold, and Sean Penn are both terrific in their rolls, and the film has  some really funny moments.  However, in my opinion, most notably should be  that this movie is a soundtrack for the early 1980's.  Some fantastic music  is to be found in the movie, such as &quot;Raised On The Radio&quot; and  Jimmy Buffett's &quot;I Don't Know (Spicoli's Theme)&quot;.

Sean Penn really juices up the screen as Jeff Spicoli; it's not hard to see why he went on to become a real film star.  The conflict that's established between him and Mr. Hand (Ray Walston), Spicoli's teacher, is exactly what's needed in this type of comedy and it's absolutely spot on.  The other characters are also well thought out--for the first half hour.Then what happens is a definite lessening of impact as Stacy (played by a very young Jennifer Jason Leigh) gets serious with sex.  Okay, it's true that you don't want sex to be a fount of ridicule all the time, but the transition from the first riotous half hour to these serious issues (loss of virginity, abortion, etc.) changes the film dramatically.  By the time the really funny stuff starts up again, in the last third of the film, the comedic impact has been definitely lessened.In addition, there seemed to be a number of characters (for example, those played by Eric Roberts and Anthony Edwards) who were just kind of there, not doing much at all.  These two served as sounding boards for the amazing Sean Penn.This is by no means a bad film.  Not at all.  I just found it inconsistent.

64499,A33TBHM3O9AY17,0783233078,No one of consequence,"[2, 5]","""Fast Times"" is the quintessential 80's movie and the quintessential Sean Penn role.  In my humble opinion, it was his best work, but unfortunately for him it was very early in his acting career and it has only been downhill for him since then.But enough about him, let's talk about the rest of the movie.  My wife is a lover of 80's teen flicks (I think our joint favorite is ""Better Off Dead"") and took advantage of our kids' absence this week to watch ""Fast Times"" again for the first time in many years.  Now admittedly, I'm occasionally prone to 80's nostalgia from time to time, but we were both amazed at how stark the evolution of American culture has been since 1982.  So much has changed in the past twenty plus years, and seeing the designer jeans, feathered hairclips, and Blue Oyster Cult again were quite a throwback.  It was pretty humorous to consider that we were really that goofy in those days.  It's doubly so to consider that we thought ourselves cool at the time.Aside from the obvious nostalgic energy inherent in this flick, there's one thing that struck me, and I can summarize it in a single word:  ""Lemmings!""  Every teenager depicted in this movie, with just a few exceptions, were a bunch of sex-crazed little lemmings constantly on the prowl for their next tryst.  Maybe I was just naive, but I don't remember my teen years in the early 80s being quite so hormone-driven.  I also don't remember this movie being quite so racy with the amount of gratuitous nudity.  Again, probably just the old prude in me coming to the surface.Nevertheless, ""Fast Times"" gives a great look back at a comical time in which my generation came of age.  It was alot of fun to go back and revisit those days.  I'm sure I'll probably do it again in a few years when I need another reminder not to take myself to seriously.",4,Sean Penn peaked early -- with this movie.,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,1830,"['Fast', 'Times', 'quintessential', '80', 'movie', 'quintessential', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'role', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'work', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'early', 'acting', 'career', 'only', 'been', 'downhill', 'then.But', 'enough', 'let', 'talk', 'rest', 'movie', 'wife', 'lover', '80', 'teen', 'flicks', 'think', 'joint', 'favorite', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'took', 'advantage', 'kids', 'absence', 'week', 'watch', 'Fast', 'Times', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'Now', 'admittedly', ""'m"", 'occasionally', 'prone', '80', 'nostalgia', 'time', 'time', 'were', 'amazed', 'how', 'stark', 'evolution', 'American', 'culture', 'been', '1982', 'So', 'much', 'changed', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'seeing', 'designer', 'jeans', 'feathered', 'hairclips', 'Blue', 'Oyster', 'Cult', 'again', 'were', 'quite', 'throwback', 'was', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'consider', 'were', 'really', 'goofy', 'days', 'doubly', 'so', 'consider', 'thought', 'cool', 'time.Aside', 'obvious', 'nostalgic', 'energy', 'inherent', 'flick', 'one', 'thing', 'struck', 'can', 'summarize', 'single', 'word', 'Lemmings', 'Every', 'teenager', 'depicted', 'movie', 'just', 'few', 'exceptions', 'were', 'bunch', 'sex-crazed', 'little', 'lemmings', 'constantly', 'prowl', 'next', 'tryst', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'naive', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'teen', 'years', 'early', '80s', 'being', 'quite', 'so', 'hormone-driven', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'movie', 'being', 'quite', 'so', 'racy', 'amount', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'Again', 'probably', 'just', 'old', 'prude', 'coming', 'surface.Nevertheless', 'Fast', 'Times', 'great', 'look', 'back', 'comical', 'time', 'generation', 'came', 'age', 'was', 'alot', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'revisit', 'days', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'do', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'when', 'need', 'reminder', 'not', 'take', 'seriously']",N/A

64503,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,0783233078,P Magnum,"[20, 24]","Fast Times At Ridgemont High is Cameron Crowe's first foray into the movie industry.  He started out (as chronicled in Almost Famous) as a teenage reporter for Rolling Stone.  After he left the magazine, he posed as a high schooler in a Southern California high school.  The result was a book that was turned into this movie.  Mr. Crowe wrote the screenplay and Amy Heckerling directed.  The movie follows several different students and is one of the funniest movies ever made.  Sean Penn stars as the stoner surfer Jeff Spicoli who only goal in life is to find some tasty waves and keep a cool buzz.  His history professor, Mr. Hand (played with menacing glee by the late Ray Walston), provides an adversary for Spicoli to go up against.  Judge Reinhold &amp; Jennifer Jason-Leigh play brother &amp; sister, Brad &amp; Stacy.  Brad is a senior who seems to have it all, cool car, good job at a burger joint and a perfect girlfriend.  All of this collapses on him as his girlfriend breaks up with him, he's fired from his job and is forced to work a couple of embarrassing jobs.  Stacy is a freshman and works at a pizza place in the mall (which is the center of alot of activity in the film) with the world wise Linda (played by Phoebe Cates).  Linda is constantly giving advice to the naive Stacy.  She meets an older guy and in one of the more poignant moments in the film, loses her virginity to him in a baseball dugout.  Mark Ratner works at the movie theater in the mall and has a crush on Stacy. His friend, Mike Damone (played by Robert Romanus) is a hustler who scalps tickets to concerts and he, like Linda to Stacy, gives advice to &quot;Rat&quot;.  Stacy and Rat eventual go out, but Damone ends up sleeping with Stacy.  A whole mess ensues, but in the end, every one makes up.  The movie was a springboard to the careers of Mr. Penn, Ms. Cates, Ms. Leigh and Mr. Reinhold and is riff with future stars in small roles including Nicholas Cage, Anthony Edwards, Eric Stoltz &amp; Forrest Whitaker.  The movie has a great soundtrack and is a perfect snapshot of the fashions, trends and lives of teenagers in the early 80's.  But throw away the different hairstyles, clothes, slang and music, the situations that the kids get into are the same for any generation and we can all relate.",5,Good Times,980812800,"01 30, 2001",2001,2295,"['Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'first', 'foray', 'movie', 'industry', 'started', 'out', 'chronicled', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'teenage', 'reporter', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'left', 'magazine', 'posed', 'high', 'schooler', 'Southern', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'result', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'turned', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'directed', 'movie', 'several', 'different', 'students', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'stars', 'stoner', 'surfer', 'Jeff', 'Spicoli', 'who', 'only', 'goal', 'life', 'find', 'tasty', 'waves', 'keep', 'cool', 'buzz', 'history', 'professor', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'played', 'menacing', 'glee', 'late', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'adversary', 'Spicoli', 'go', 'up', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'amp', 'Jennifer', 'Jason-Leigh', 'play', 'brother', 'amp', 'sister', 'Brad', 'amp', 'Stacy', 'Brad', 'senior', 'who', 'have', 'cool', 'car', 'good', 'job', 'burger', 'joint', 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'collapses', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'fired', 'job', 'forced', 'work', 'couple', 'embarrassing', 'jobs', 'Stacy', 'freshman', 'pizza', 'place', 'mall', 'center', 'alot', 'activity', 'film', 'world', 'wise', 'Linda', 'played', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Linda', 'constantly', 'giving', 'advice', 'naive', 'Stacy', 'older', 'guy', 'one', 'more', 'poignant', 'moments', 'film', 'virginity', 'baseball', 'dugout', 'Mark', 'Ratner', 'movie', 'theater', 'mall', 'crush', 'Stacy', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Damone', 'played', 'Robert', 'Romanus', 'hustler', 'who', 'tickets', 'concerts', 'Linda', 'Stacy', 'advice', 'quot', 'Rat', 'quot', 'Stacy', 'Rat', 'eventual', 'go', 'out', 'Damone', 'up', 'sleeping', 'Stacy', 'A', 'whole', 'mess', 'ensues', 'end', 'one', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'springboard', 'careers', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'Ms.', 'Cates', 'Ms.', 'Leigh', 'Mr.', 'Reinhold', 'riff', 'future', 'stars', 'small', 'roles', 'including', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'amp', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'movie', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'snapshot', 'fashions', 'trends', 'lives', 'teenagers', 'early', '80', 'throw', 'away', 'different', 'hairstyles', 'clothes', 'slang', 'music', 'situations', 'kids', 'get', 'are', 'same', 'generation', 'can', 'relate']",N/A

The fact that this  picture has such a cult following is a testament to its staying power and  relevancy in 2000.  I predict that in 2010 it will still be a good snapshot  at high school kids in that era.It's clear to me that amazon.com  reviewer Marshall Fine doesn't have a clue about movies when he refers to  Cameron Crowe, who scripted this picture, as an &quot;overrated  filmmaker&quot;.  To the contrary, Crowe has established himself as one of  the brightest of the most recent crop of filmmakers.  His script as well as  Amy Heckerling's direction in &quot;Fast Times&quot;, show that they really  have tapped into what makes high school kids of the 80's tick.  Sean Penn  turns in the performance of his career as Jeff Spicoli, a stoner with no  direction and little ambition (other than to have Van Halen play at his  birthday party, of course).  This movie also marks the acting debuts of  Judge Rheinhold, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Forest Whitaker, Anthony Edwards,  and Eric Stolz.  Ray Walston's brief performance as a crusty teacher is  also noteworthy.My only complaint about this motion picture is that  certain scenes which were added to the television edit of the movie were  deleted for the DVD.  They helped give some direction to the plot and will  be missed.  That aside, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; is to 80's  high school students what &quot;Porky's&quot; was to 50's high school  students and &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot; was to 60's high school  students.

What makes the movie so memorable, besides Sean Penn's awesomely funny performance, is Cameron Crowe's (Say Anything) script and the young cast who all went on to become famous actors (keep an eye out for cameos by Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz, Anthony Edwards, Vincent Schiavelli, James Russo, and Heart guitarist and Crowe's future wife Nancy Wilson).RecommendedA",5,"""Those guys are fags!""",1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1469,"['Fast', 'Times', '80', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'Look', 'Who', 'Talking', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'Brian', 'Backer', 'Moving', 'Violations', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Martian', '.The', 'film', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'American', 'High', 'School', 'students', 'Jeff', 'Spicoli', 'pothead', 'surfer', 'dude', 'played', 'scene-stealing', 'side-splitting', 'Penn', 'Mark', 'Ratner', 'played', 'Backer', 'nerdy', 'theatre', 'usher', 'who', 'obsessing', 'freshman', 'named', 'Stacy', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'Leigh', 'who', 'mall', 'pizza', 'place', 'Linda', 'Barrett', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Cates', 'Stacy', 'best', 'friend', 'Brad', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'Reinhold', 'Stacy', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'successful', 'out-of-school', 'career', 'secretly', 'infatuated', 'Linda', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'played', 'hilariously', 'Walston', 'strict', 'History', 'teacher', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'Spicoli', 'waltzing', 'room', 'late', 'regular', 'basis', 'ordering', 'pizza', 'class', 'who', 'convinced', 'kids', 'are', 'dope.Fast', 'Times', 'classic', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'memorable', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'awesomely', 'funny', 'performance', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Say', 'Anything', 'script', 'young', 'cast', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'famous', 'actors', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'cameos', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Vincent', 'Schiavelli', 'James', 'Russo', 'Heart', 'guitarist', 'Crowe', 'future', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Wilson', '.RecommendedA']",N/A

Just incase some of you don't know, Network Television has included additional scenes over the years when airing this movie. Now one would think since the previous collector's edition release didn't include the restored footage that this new special edition release would.

Other bonus features include a theatrical trailer, production notes, and mini-clips of every song on the film's sountrack.One of the reasons why Fast Times at Ridgemont High is such a classic film is because it marked the rise of a new generation of young movie stars, such as Penn, Phoebe Cates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nicholas Cage, Judge Reinhold, and Forest Whitaker. There are plenty of memorable quotes in the film (""What are you people?

Now that I am a DVD regular watcher, I have decided to try and locate some of these older films and watched them in entirety.  Particularly since DVD allows for a clearer picture and most times widescreen format (what better way to watch it).I was a teenager in 1982 so it's always nice to see a film capture that era.  This movies does that, and features a soundtrack from that time. Overall, a nice snapshot.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed FTARH even if the DVD apparently does not include all scenes.  As I said earlier, I had only seen bits and pieces of the movie over the years and hardly remembered them, so any missing scenes would not have made much difference to my viewing of the DVD.Sean Penn is excellent as the stoned surfie dude.  Phoebe Cates performance is also highly notable and she too has some hilarious moments.  Jennifer Jason Leigh also delivers a great performance.  As many are aware, FTARH launched many careers and contains a huge list of actors who went on to become big stars today.  These include:  Nicholas Cage (although only minor role for Nicholas), Anthony Edwards, and to a much lesser extent Eric Stolz.Teenagers in 1982 will love this movie. It definitely reminded me of situations that happened at High School.DVD Review: While you get the film in widescreen, the transfer is less than satisfying.  I realise the film is over 20 years old, but Universal have not spent any time restoring the picture. It's almost blurry in parts.  I'd have to rate this DVD as one of the worst transfers I've seen (please note I am basing my review on the Australian DVD transfer). The American DVD may have a better transfer.Features wise, the DVD is above average.  Universal deserves praise in this regard. Just a huge pity they decided not to include any of the well known deleted scenes that MANY Amazon reviewers have mentioned.

64544,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0783233078,Wuchak,"[6, 7]","In my humble opinion, 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and 1994's ""Dazed and Confused"" are the best high school comedy-dramas.I had a taped-from-tv VHS version of ""Fast Times"" and watched it a few times over the years; I thought the film was decent, but nothing exceptional, that is, until I recently bought the DVD and saw the film the only way it was meant to be viewed -- in its original, uncut form. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that ""Fast Times"" is indeed great and I had been seriously ripped-off in my past viewings. In fact, it seemed like I was seeing the film for the first time!The story is set in a California high school in 1982. What makes ""Fast Times"" work so well is, despite the goofy Spicoli antics, it honestly attempts to depict the high school/teenage experience in all it's glory & shame, good times & bad. Too many films of this ilk focus on raunchy shenanigans and go no deeper. ""Fast Times"" doesn't make this mistake. The film features quality characters with great depth and the viewer experiences (or re-experiences) the fun/painful high school years through them. Although there's a little nudity and sexual explicitness it's not overkill and, besides, it belongs in a film that endeavors to honestly depict the high school experience, otherwise it wouldn't be true-to-life; in other words, it'd be a lie.Damone is a great character with his smooth-talking mesmerism. He strongly believes in putting on airs to succeed and conceals any weakness. If he falls flat, so to speak, he immediately covers-up and acts like nothing happened. Never advertise your failings or the savage wolves will tear you to pieces, he seems to think. Many of his pithy sayings & beliefs are absolutely true, e.g. ""Wherever you're at, that's the place to be."" In other words, ""Live in the moment."" Although he uses a girl as a sex object and swiftly loses a good friend & follower as a result, I found it interesting that he later genuinely apologizes, which shows humility and character. The friend then sees the humanity behind Damone's smooth-talk and properly opts to forgive & forget. This is great stuff.Another quality character is Stacy Hamilton, played excellently by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's petite, cute and can cop an alluring expression for the object of her desire, which totals three in the story.The other characters are strong as well -- Stacey's likable older brother, Brad; the ""surfer dude"" Spicoli; the awkward-but-trying-hard Mark ""Rat"" Ratner; Stacey's sexy best friend, Linda (Phoebe Cates); etc.Late in the film we observe Stacey make a huge mistake and suffer the consequences. It's to the movie's merit that this episode is genuinely heartwrenching, especially considering that the film's largely a comedy. Then her brother unexpectedly shows up, faithful and dependable; he doesn't say much but it's clear he loves his sister dearly. It's scenes like this that propel ""Fast Times"" head & shoulders above the competition.Another sequence that hits home is when a certain character humorously fantasizes about his dream girl, but it goes too far and... (I can't give it away, but it's totally hilarious and true-to-life).Then there's Spicoli's relationship with Mr. Hand. On the surface these two are nemeses, but we observe a different dimension to their relationship near the end when Mr. Hand has a turtoring session with Spicoli in his bedroom. The teacher is almost enlightened when he discovers that Spicoli actually understands the principles of history, it's just that he phrases the data according to his sub-cultural lexicon. Also, as unlikely as the tutoring session in Spicoli's bedroom seems, I had to do this when I was in high school due to a broken leg and literal body cast. An older gentleman would sit by my bed and tutor me a few times a week for a few months.Of course, the soundtrack is a highlight as well. Go to IMDb's ""soundtrack listing"" for all the songs, like ""We Got the Beat,"" ""Kashmir"" and ""Somebody's Baby.""CONCLUSION: Like I said, ""Fast Times"" is one of the best high school comedy-dramas out there, along with ""Dazed and Confused."" It eschews one-dimensional and juvenile raunch for something deeper, more balanced, true-to-life and even moving. Simply put, ""Fast Times"" is a must own.",5,"""You'll laugh, you'll cry""",1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,4268,"['humble', 'opinion', '1982', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', '1994', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'are', 'best', 'high', 'school', 'comedy-dramas.I', 'had', 'taped-from-tv', 'VHS', 'version', 'Fast', 'Times', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'years', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'recently', 'bought', 'DVD', 'saw', 'film', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'viewed', 'original', 'uncut', 'form', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'Fast', 'Times', 'indeed', 'great', 'had', 'been', 'seriously', 'ripped-off', 'past', 'viewings', 'fact', 'seemed', 'was', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'story', 'set', 'California', 'high', 'school', '1982', 'What', 'Fast', 'Times', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'goofy', 'Spicoli', 'antics', 'honestly', 'depict', 'high', 'school/teenage', 'experience', 'glory', 'shame', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'Too', 'many', 'films', 'ilk', 'focus', 'raunchy', 'shenanigans', 'go', 'deeper', 'Fast', 'Times', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'film', 'quality', 'characters', 'great', 'depth', 'viewer', 'experiences', 're-experiences', 'fun/painful', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'little', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'explicitness', 'not', 'overkill', 'besides', 'film', 'honestly', 'depict', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'true-to-life', 'other', 'words', ""'d"", 'be', 'lie.Damone', 'great', 'character', 'smooth-talking', 'mesmerism', 'strongly', 'putting', 'airs', 'succeed', 'conceals', 'weakness', 'flat', 'so', 'speak', 'immediately', 'covers-up', 'acts', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Never', 'advertise', 'failings', 'savage', 'wolves', 'will', 'tear', 'pieces', 'think', 'Many', 'pithy', 'sayings', 'beliefs', 'are', 'absolutely', 'true', 'e.g', ""'re"", 'place', 'be', 'other', 'words', 'Live', 'moment', 'girl', 'sex', 'object', 'swiftly', 'good', 'friend', 'follower', 'result', 'found', 'interesting', 'later', 'genuinely', 'humility', 'character', 'friend', 'then', 'humanity', 'Damone', 'smooth-talk', 'properly', 'opts', 'forgive', 'forget', 'great', 'stuff.Another', 'quality', 'character', 'Stacy', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'excellently', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'petite', 'cute', 'can', 'cop', 'alluring', 'expression', 'object', 'desire', 'three', 'story.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'Stacey', 'likable', 'older', 'brother', 'Brad', 'surfer', 'dude', 'Spicoli', 'awkward-but-trying-hard', 'Mark', 'Rat', 'Ratner', 'Stacey', 'sexy', 'best', 'friend', 'Linda', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'etc.Late', 'film', 'observe', 'Stacey', 'make', 'huge', 'mistake', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'movie', 'merit', 'episode', 'genuinely', 'heartwrenching', 'especially', 'considering', 'film', 'largely', 'comedy', 'Then', 'brother', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'faithful', 'dependable', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'clear', 'sister', 'dearly', 'scenes', 'Fast', 'Times', 'head', 'shoulders', 'competition.Another', 'sequence', 'home', 'when', 'certain', 'character', 'humorously', 'dream', 'girl', 'too', 'far', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'true-to-life', '.Then', 'Spicoli', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'surface', 'two', 'are', 'nemeses', 'observe', 'different', 'dimension', 'relationship', 'end', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'turtoring', 'session', 'Spicoli', 'bedroom', 'teacher', 'almost', 'enlightened', 'when', 'Spicoli', 'actually', 'principles', 'history', 'just', 'data', 'according', 'sub-cultural', 'lexicon', 'Also', 'as', 'unlikely', 'tutoring', 'session', 'Spicoli', 'bedroom', 'had', 'do', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'due', 'broken', 'leg', 'literal', 'body', 'cast', 'older', 'gentleman', 'would', 'sit', 'bed', 'tutor', 'few', 'times', 'week', 'few', 'months.Of', 'course', 'soundtrack', 'highlight', 'as', 'well', 'Go', 'IMDb', 'soundtrack', 'listing', 'songs', 'Got', 'Beat', 'Kashmir', 'Somebody', 'Baby', 'CONCLUSION', 'said', 'Fast', 'Times', 'one', 'best', 'high', 'school', 'comedy-dramas', 'there', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'one-dimensional', 'juvenile', 'raunch', 'something', 'deeper', 'more', 'balanced', 'true-to-life', 'even', 'moving', 'Simply', 'put', 'Fast', 'Times', 'must', 'own']",N/A
