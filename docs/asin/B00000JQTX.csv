507269,A2D6IGKSOBQ3K9,B00000JQTX,Amethyst,"[29, 43]","I couldn't believe some of these reviews on here, I am still laughing! People up in arms because of a CARTOON. ""Secret agendas?"" I think some of you people need to open your minds and get a life. I can't believe the way people have to hate things that they fear and refuse to understand.Anyways, Scooby and the gang get tricked into helping  horror writer, Ben Ravencroft. He assures the gang that his ancestor, Sarah, was merely a Wiccan healer, not an evil witch, as the town legend says.  Ben needs the gang to help him uncover the location of Sarah's ancient spell book. His secret agenda is to invoke Sarah's ghost which is trapped in the book. Great Halloween entertainment. Great music, my daughter had to get the soundtrack she enjoyed it so much. Some people said that The Witch's Ghost is not for children under 8 or so. My daughter seen this when she was 4 and she loved it, thought it was very funny. She has been a Scooby fan since she was about 3 and collects all the movies. You have to know your child and how well they decipher real life from television. Use common sense. If ghosts and witches scare your kids, don't let them watch this.I was impressed that the creators were brave enough to educate the viewers on Wicca, a very misunderstood way of life. It is a shame that some of the other religions pull out all the stops to be sure that Wicca stays misunderstood with the general public. The real truth about Wicca can be found in many a reputable publication (see my other reviews on these books) by anyone who is open minded enough to learn something new. Someone else had mentioned that they had a problem with some of the songs in the movie talking about loving nature. Since when is that a crime? Look at the state our environment is in right now. Perhaps if more people learned to love nature and treasure it we wouln't have so many of the environmental issues we live with today. Some people need to chill out on the religious hang-ups with this cartoon. It is ENTERTAINMENT. Lets not forget it is a free country with freedom of religion. If something in this cartoon makes you feel threatened, then I feel sorry for you.",5,Scooby and the gang are back...to entertain us,1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,2151,"['could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reviews', 'here', 'am', 'still', 'laughing', 'People', 'up', 'arms', 'CARTOON', 'Secret', 'agendas', 'think', 'people', 'need', 'open', 'minds', 'get', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'way', 'people', 'have', 'hate', 'things', 'fear', 'refuse', 'understand.Anyways', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'get', 'tricked', 'helping', 'horror', 'writer', 'Ben', 'Ravencroft', 'gang', 'ancestor', 'Sarah', 'was', 'merely', 'Wiccan', 'healer', 'not', 'evil', 'witch', 'town', 'legend', 'Ben', 'gang', 'help', 'uncover', 'location', 'Sarah', 'ancient', 'spell', 'book', 'secret', 'agenda', 'invoke', 'Sarah', 'ghost', 'trapped', 'book', 'Great', 'Halloween', 'entertainment', 'Great', 'music', 'daughter', 'had', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'said', 'Witch', 'Ghost', 'not', 'children', '8', 'so', 'daughter', 'seen', 'when', 'was', '4', 'loved', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'been', 'Scooby', 'fan', 'was', 'about', '3', 'collects', 'movies', 'have', 'know', 'child', 'how', 'well', 'decipher', 'real', 'life', 'television', 'Use', 'common', 'sense', 'ghosts', 'witches', 'scare', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'watch', 'this.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'creators', 'were', 'brave', 'enough', 'educate', 'viewers', 'Wicca', 'very', 'misunderstood', 'way', 'life', 'shame', 'other', 'religions', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'be', 'sure', 'Wicca', 'misunderstood', 'general', 'public', 'real', 'truth', 'Wicca', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'many', 'reputable', 'publication', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'books', 'anyone', 'who', 'open', 'minded', 'enough', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'Someone', 'else', 'had', 'mentioned', 'had', 'problem', 'songs', 'movie', 'talking', 'loving', 'nature', 'when', 'crime', 'Look', 'state', 'environment', 'right', 'now', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'people', 'learned', 'love', 'nature', 'treasure', 'woul', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'many', 'environmental', 'issues', 'live', 'today', 'people', 'need', 'chill', 'out', 'religious', 'hang-ups', 'cartoon', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'not', 'forget', 'free', 'country', 'freedom', 'religion', 'something', 'cartoon', 'feel', 'threatened', 'then', 'feel', 'sorry']",N/A

I was happy to see new movies being produced and brought it home to watch along with my daughter who is three. My husband and I both laughed all the way through, there are many sly in-jokes.I find it amazing that so many reviewers have focused on only two issues - one that it dares to mention Wiccans in a *gasp* positive light, and two- that it is too *intense* for smaller kids. For the first issue, it's just silly to say that this movie is a lesson in Wicca. It's almost as if the other reviewers are seeing a different movie! The very few bits of dialogue that happen to mention Wicca just say that Wiccans are nature lovers or natural healers. Whoo - clap your hand over your kid's ears!!! In fact the Hex Girls explicitly say they are NOT Wiccans, they are Eco-Goths (whatever THAT means!) and that one of them is 1/16th Wiccan on her mother's side. Ohh, the horror! Their song at the end talks about loving the earth, wow what a bad idea huh? I also thought that being Wiccan is hereditary to be very funny.The second issue, that it is too intense, is also being overblown. Some have objected to the ""real"" witch. Say it with me now, people: ""iiit's aaa caar-tooon"". There, isn't that better?  Just as in most Scooby episodes, nobody is hurt, nobody dies, there's no blood, no body parts, the explosions don't hit anyone, and the ""pumpkin spiders"" as my family calls them, are just funny. I'd rather my kid watch this than most of ""kid's"" tv or video games that are far more violent.

507275,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00000JQTX,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[6, 8]","This 2nd chapter takes place almost immediately after ""Zombie Island"" concludes. While I don't consider this 2nd chapter quite as good as ""Zombie Island,"" this 2nd chapter nails down the formula for a good sequel. It brings back enough familiar elements (the gang), but it offers a different adventure. While this 2nd chapter is not quite as intense as ""Zombie Island,"" it would probably still be a good idea for parents to screen it before they give it to their children. Scooby and the gang solve a mystery (at least in part) at a museum and meet the writer Ben Ravencroft. He invites the gang to visit his 'quiet' home in Massachusetts. For an animated movie, the scenery is actually quite impressive. Well, Ben and the gang discover that the town is anything but quiet due to the publicity over the possible presence of a witch's ghost. (The Mayor and the T Shirt guy bear a striking resemblance to Boss Hogg and Sheriff Roscoe.) Naturally, our favorite gang gets curious but Scooby and Shaggy are more interested in food. (Big surprise.) There is a hilarious scene where they go to a restaurant that is too good even for them. Well, Ben and our gang meet the Hex Girls who play good music and at the same time draw some suspicion. This is a difficult movie not to ruin, but I'll try. The misleads make sense upon discovery, and just when we think the movie is over, we find out that the real horror is yet to come. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch of ""Zombie Island,"" the climax is really well done and surprisingly scarey. Again, this movie may be a little too much for young children, but older children and even some adults are bound to enjoy this.",4,"Caution Advised, But Still Great!",1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1662,"['2nd', 'chapter', 'place', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'concludes', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', '2nd', 'chapter', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Zombie', 'Island', '2nd', 'chapter', 'nails', 'down', 'formula', 'good', 'sequel', 'back', 'enough', 'familiar', 'elements', 'gang', 'different', 'adventure', '2nd', 'chapter', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'intense', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'parents', 'screen', 'give', 'children', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'solve', 'mystery', 'least', 'part', 'museum', 'meet', 'writer', 'Ben', 'Ravencroft', 'gang', 'visit', ""'quiet"", 'home', 'Massachusetts', 'animated', 'movie', 'scenery', 'actually', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Well', 'Ben', 'gang', 'discover', 'town', 'anything', 'quiet', 'due', 'publicity', 'possible', 'presence', 'witch', 'ghost', 'Mayor', 'T', 'Shirt', 'guy', 'bear', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'Sheriff', 'Roscoe', 'Naturally', 'favorite', 'gang', 'curious', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'food', 'Big', 'surprise', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'go', 'restaurant', 'too', 'good', 'even', 'Well', 'Ben', 'gang', 'meet', 'Hex', 'Girls', 'who', 'play', 'good', 'music', 'same', 'time', 'draw', 'suspicion', 'difficult', 'movie', 'not', 'ruin', ""'ll"", 'try', 'misleads', 'make', 'sense', 'discovery', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'horror', 'yet', 'come', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pack', 'punch', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'climax', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'surprisingly', 'scarey', 'Again', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'young', 'children', 'older', 'children', 'even', 'adults', 'are', 'bound', 'enjoy']",N/A

507277,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B00000JQTX,Bruce Rux,"[9, 14]","This is Scooby the way he was meant to be  -  still good, clean fun for the kids, but nostalgically campy enough to appeal to their parents, as well.  The recent feature-length live-action movie took a few hints from this (and one or two of the other newer Doos), and should have followed the lead even further.  It playfully spoofs itself with the adult sensibilities of every former child fan who has now grown up, but does so with a great deal of love and affection.Scooby and Co. begin the proceedings by solving one of their classic nutball-in-a-mask mysteries, with the usual ridiculous goings-on, delightfully underscored by the singing of the famous theme song by none other than Billy Ray ""Achy Breaky Heart"" Cyrus.  Handsome horror writer Ben Ravenscroft  -  wickedly and wonderfully voiced by Rocky Horror's Tim Curry, who excels at this kind of thing  -  then invites the gang to join him for a holiday weekend in his small New England town, which pulls out all the stops as a tourist attraction capitalizing on Ravenscroft's notorious witch ancestor.  Taking part in the proceedings is the glamorous Goth-girl group, the Hex Sisters  -  lead-voiced by Jane Weidlin  -  who, along with sundry other bizarre goings-on, suspiciously seem to indicate that something more sinister than usual is occurring at this year's Witch Fest.  Breaking the usual Scooby formula (which everyone who ever watched the show has always wanted to see happen), the Mystery, Inc. gang's quarry actually turns out, for once, to be supernatural.  Zoinks!The animation is, needless to say, far superior to that in the original Hanna-Barbera series, which is even commented on subtly and in humorous fashion by the characters.  If hearing Billy Ray Cyrus down-homely sing the theme song while idiot bad-guys are tripping over Shag's and Scoob's improvised traps doesn't have you sufficiently chuckling from the very start, you're sure to enjoy the Hex Girls' sultry rockin'  -  the music in this movie is really very good, considering what it's in.  Fred and Daphne begin to indicate that they are more than just friends, and unlucky-in-love brainy-geek Velma has her poor heart broken, but comes through it like a trouper.  And the appearance of a few real spooks, for a change, just makes it all that much more fun.The warnings that younger kids might be frightened by the supernatural goings-on are nonsense.

There ARE other religions out there, exposing your children to them is no big deal, shielding them from it is both fascist and dangerous. And to dismiss them as evil is pure insanity. Especially Wicca. This is not a 'satanic' or 'devil-worshipping' religion and saying so only promotes further ignorance. Surely something was learned from the Dark Ages and the Salem Witch hunts. But reading other reviews here...I'm having second thoughts.I'm actually quite glad Warner had the balls to have a plot involving Wicca and witches in a Scooby Doo cartoon. Okay, so ONE of them ultimately turns to be evil but there are evil people of all religions. Witch's Ghost is NOT pure Wiccan propaganda, it merely educates and enlightens on what is a highly misunderstood way of life. I would definitely prefer children to watch this.The movie itself was one of the earlier efforts in the Scooby Doo revivals. Meaning that the monster is real and the writing is stronger and the gang have updated outfits. Tim Curry has a role as whacko writer Ben Ravencroft, a sort cross between HP Lovecraft and Sutter Cane, plus there is a Goth Girl Group called The Hex Girls who have a couple of cool songs. Billy Ray Cyrus sings the theme tune this time around.There's a decent amount of mystery and humor, obviously nothing too sophisticated, to keep anyone, not just the kids, entertained. It's perfect family fun and I suggest you give it a ago and pay no attention to the insane reviews of Christian fundamentalists.The DVD is in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn, with Dolby 2.0 sound. However, my Region 2 release has a Dolby 5.1 track that was surprisingly loud and forceful with plenty of surround effects and deep bass. Sorry, but this ain't on the Region 1 version.

I'm not a big fan, but will sit through it for their sakes; however, I was very unhappy with ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost"".The first half of the show was just fine, as it was the typical Scooby formula (ie, the culprit is revealed as a regular person and the world is safe again). Unfortunately, the problem arose in the second half. You think the movie is over, but then the horror author character suddenly proclaims himself a real warlock and conjures up his witch ancestor to presumably take over the world. The next several minutes have the real witch and warlock chasing after and threatening Scooby and the Gang. This change eliminated the typical, formulaic Scooby ""safety"" of knowing that there is a real person and a logical explanation behind the scary effects. It made me quite uncomfortable and frightened my children.The other problem I had with this movie was its pro-Wiccan message.  Before any Wiccans argue with me, save it.  If you aren't bothered by it, then you'll obviously enjoy this movie more than we did.  I, on the other hand, take serious exception when the Hollywood crowd use a kid's cartoon to try and push their personal beliefs and agenda onto young, impressionable children. I think it is totally inappropriate and it actually makes me quite angry--especially when they are trying that crap with MY kids.Frankly, this Scooby has put me off of getting any more of the newer Scooby Doo movies for my kids, since I don't like the direction they have taken. Fortunately for me, I bought this thing at the thrift store and so didn't spend too much money on it. As soon as I realized the nature and intent of the movie, it was out of our home and right back at the thrift store. And, even without the ""real"" witch stuff and the pro-Wiccan message, I though it was a lousy story and my kids didn't enjoy it at all.  So, if you don't appreciate Hollywood's attempts to brainwash your kids into accepting things with which you disagree, then avoid this movie.",1,Awful,1250899200,"08 22, 2009",2009,2032,"['2-', '5-year-old', 'kids', 'love', 'Scooby', 'Doo', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'will', 'sit', 'sakes', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'unhappy', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Witch', 'Ghost', '.The', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'was', 'typical', 'Scooby', 'formula', 'ie', 'culprit', 'revealed', 'regular', 'person', 'world', 'safe', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'problem', 'arose', 'second', 'half', 'think', 'movie', 'then', 'horror', 'author', 'character', 'suddenly', 'real', 'warlock', 'up', 'witch', 'ancestor', 'presumably', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'next', 'several', 'minutes', 'have', 'real', 'witch', 'warlock', 'chasing', 'threatening', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'change', 'eliminated', 'typical', 'formulaic', 'Scooby', 'safety', 'knowing', 'real', 'person', 'logical', 'explanation', 'scary', 'effects', 'made', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'frightened', 'children.The', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'pro-Wiccan', 'message', 'Wiccans', 'argue', 'save', 'are', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'then', ""'ll"", 'obviously', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'did', 'other', 'hand', 'take', 'serious', 'exception', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'crowd', 'use', 'kid', 'cartoon', 'try', 'push', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'agenda', 'young', 'impressionable', 'children', 'think', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'actually', 'quite', 'angry', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'crap', 'MY', 'kids.Frankly', 'Scooby', 'put', 'getting', 'more', 'newer', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movies', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'direction', 'have', 'taken', 'Fortunately', 'bought', 'thing', 'thrift', 'store', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'As', 'soon', 'realized', 'nature', 'intent', 'movie', 'was', 'home', 'right', 'back', 'thrift', 'store', 'even', 'real', 'witch', 'stuff', 'pro-Wiccan', 'message', 'was', 'lousy', 'story', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Hollywood', 'attempts', 'brainwash', 'kids', 'accepting', 'things', 'disagree', 'then', 'avoid', 'movie']",N/A

No matter who you are, this film has everything.  It has comedy, drama, intrigue, suspense, magic, the paranormal, horror, and of course, Velma in her most in-depth role yet.The fact that it has EVERYTHING, however, is what causes over-protective parents to get up in arms about this film.  As those who remember Harry Potter's every-flavored beans know, sometimes having everything can be unpleasant to some.Now I am a geek who spent most of his life sucking up all the knowledge I could wrap my mind around, and in my opinion, truthful fact is never wrong, and this film mentions some important truthful facts which are often overlooked.Now, to parents, ""If you don't want to know those facts, it's your own business, but hiding them from your children will only make them less prepared if they ever need those facts later in life.""  I know.

The film itself had a darker feel to it and that worked and perhaps contributed to Mr. Curry's success in his role.

He loved the movie but was a bit frightened by it.We let our children watch Scooby because, no matter how scary the monsters look... they are always just a man in a mask.  The show used to point out how if you just use your brain you can figure out mysteries and that there are no real monsters.  That whole theory was blown out of the water by this Scooby (and Zombie Island as well).First off, the artwork is just a little different, the colors are bolder and the creatures are drawn scarier... much scarier than... say... the Miner 49er.  Then as a parent who has probably already suffered through both the best and worst of Scooby (the Reluctant Werewolf being among the worst) you will have to suffer through a bunch of Wiccan girls in a rock band called the ""Hex Girls"" who pontificate on how wonderful the Wiccan religion is.  I don't particularly care either way about the religion of the Hex Girls, and although I have nothing against the Wiccan beliefs... I just don't see where ANY religion belongs in Scooby Doo.  Just about the point where you as a parent feel your breakfast about to make a reappearance over the constant yapping about religion... the Hex Girls sing... they aren't Bad... they just aren't good.One of the better points of the movie is that Tim Curry makes a VO appearance... and is fabulous as always... Then we get to the point where the gang unmasks the bad guy... and you think to yourself... Okay FINALLY, this is over and I can get my TV back... but you are wrong.  Instead of ending it where they should have, a REAL GHOST OF A WITCH comes back and terrorizes Scooby and the gang.  I sat there in a fury after this was over.  Who the heck wrote this?  I thought... they missed the WHOLE POINT of Scooby... which is that the monsters are never real.If I had been watching this with an 11 year old I probably wouldn't have had an issue with this... but the 3-6 group, who loves Scooby with all of their hearts, and drags their Scooby Stuffed animal around with them... should be able to count on Scooby and Gang always unmasking the baddie and it being the Gardener or the Butler, or the Old man from scene 1... there should NEVER be a real monster in Scooby..
