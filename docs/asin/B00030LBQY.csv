(Odd marriages, I see.) Earlier, we see another couple on a hike, and after the husband is killed, the wife is chased around for a bit and killed off as well. (Evidently, someone's out there, killing--as if we didn't figure that out already). Anyhow, the couples plan to meet up that night after the hike starts. But, as figured, someone is out there. Sharon and Teddie, the wives, are plagued by specters of some sort, until Teddie is killed, and Sharon is sent running. Then the husbands (whose names I forgot) meet up with someone in a cave, hoping to escape the rain, and they are offered some meat cooking over the fire. (Take a wild guess at what--or rather, who--it is) The man tells them a story about himself and his wife, and their children (which pretty much explains the ghosts) and soon the men are plagued by terror. Things go on as expected from there, as Sharon fights to survive in the woods, and the evil surviving man searches for her and Teddie, until the it's-been-done-before climax.Not a terrible movie. The music is absolutely awful, and the acting is nothing to rave about, but it's still an okay film. A couple of good chase scenes, but the first one of the evil surviving man going after Sharon after he kills Teddie was just too dark. I couldn't see a thing. Now, maybe it was my TV but I don't know, it was still pretty dark. I preferred the day scenes. There were a couple of mild scares, but in the end, this is just another dull slasher with a few new twists. But, if you find it anywhere, check it out.

The awful score is the best THE FOREST has to offer over its uneventful storytelling, bloodless murders, and idiotic characters. It is simply a bore to watch, and the supernatural elements plot elements make absolutely no sense. The ghosts of the killer's family come and go at various points, interacting with the characters who seem entirely unfazed by their existence. Thankfully, a few of the poorly scripted lines make for some unintentional humor and milk entertainment, but other than that, this is a bottom of the barrel Horror with no redeeming qualities. It is clearly the work of a talentless director looking to exploit the ""Slasher in the woods"" theme.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,The Forest,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,838,"['FOREST', 'stupid', 'confused', 'Slasher-turned-ghost-story', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'are', 'stalked', 'woods', 'cannibalistic', 'killer', 'awful', 'score', 'best', 'THE', 'FOREST', 'offer', 'uneventful', 'storytelling', 'bloodless', 'murders', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'simply', 'bore', 'watch', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'plot', 'elements', 'make', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'ghosts', 'killer', 'family', 'come', 'go', 'various', 'points', 'interacting', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'entirely', 'unfazed', 'existence', 'Thankfully', 'few', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'lines', 'make', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'milk', 'entertainment', 'other', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'Horror', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'clearly', 'work', 'talentless', 'director', 'looking', 'exploit', 'Slasher', 'woods', 'theme.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A
854386,A1EM1PEMH6OYDU,B00030LBQY,"J. Cook ""Scabboy""","[4, 4]","[good things]Besides the eerie feeling of this movie, and the plot, the movie really didn't offer much. I did like the back story on the man and the children and thought the way that sub-plot was worked in was good. The scene where the guys were (unknowing) eating their friend was pretty classic itself. Since it was a typical 1980's in the woods slasher I really enjoyed it. The opening scene was the best, it's too bad that it was also the bloodiest. Otherwise, the directing and the acting was pretty good. Some of the chasing scenes were very well done, and prett intense-- some of the better parts of the movie.[the bad]The movie had some really dull moments, and the cast (aside from ) weren't very likable, and I thought the ghosts of the kids didn't really fit into the movie. That addition didn't really hurt the movie per se, but it simply made the movie into more of a supernatural movie than a maniac in the woods movie. I also did not care for the ending, as it was not carried out very well and very close to being lame, to say the least.[final thoughts]One of the lost slashers of the 1980's, yet to be released on DVD. I really think with geat attention this movie could be put onto DVD with remastering, cut scenes, featurettes, and commentary and be a gem. It's not the prototypical slasher classic like Black Sunday and never will be, but it is a solid slasher with everything we love-- blood, cannibalism, really bad characters and really ditty girls. When I got this movie and popped it in, I was instantly drawn to the television, even during the slowest parts I never blinked an eye in fear of missing a beat.",3,Great 1980's cannibal horror.,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1633,"['[', 'good', 'things', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'movie', 'plot', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'did', 'back', 'story', 'man', 'children', 'thought', 'way', 'sub-plot', 'was', 'worked', 'was', 'good', 'scene', 'where', 'guys', 'were', 'unknowing', 'eating', 'friend', 'was', 'pretty', 'classic', 'was', 'typical', '1980', 'woods', 'slasher', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'best', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'also', 'bloodiest', 'Otherwise', 'directing', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'chasing', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'prett', 'intense', 'better', 'parts', 'movie', '[', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'really', 'dull', 'moments', 'cast', 'aside', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'likable', 'thought', 'ghosts', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'movie', 'addition', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hurt', 'movie', 'se', 'simply', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'supernatural', 'movie', 'maniac', 'woods', 'movie', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'carried', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'lame', 'say', 'least', '[', 'final', 'thoughts', ']', 'One', 'lost', 'slashers', '1980', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'really', 'think', 'geat', 'attention', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'DVD', 'remastering', 'cut', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'be', 'gem', 'not', 'prototypical', 'slasher', 'classic', 'Black', 'Sunday', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'solid', 'slasher', 'everything', 'love', 'blood', 'cannibalism', 'really', 'bad', 'characters', 'really', 'ditty', 'girls', 'When', 'got', 'movie', 'popped', 'was', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'television', 'even', 'slowest', 'parts', 'never', 'blinked', 'eye', 'fear', 'missing', 'beat']",N/A
