471222,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305616027,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 3]","Remember growing up and watching this oddly funny, inspirational show that dabbled in both the absurd, the diabolical, and the genius all at the same time.  Don Adams of ""Get Smart"" fame wisely allowed his voice to be our uncanny hero, you know, the guy that couldn't save the day if his life depended on it, but thankfully had Penny and Brain there with him at all times to assist when needed.  This was a part of my growing up, thinking that the Chief would, at any time, give me a self-destructing sheet of paper with my mission was always something I was dreaming for.  Who else wanted to hold Penny's computer book for just one moment in our lives?  Was I the only one hoping to one day catch a glimpse of Dr. Claw's face?  If you are chanting ""YES. YES. YES"" along with me, then you are already aware of my feelings with Disney's debacle of a feature film presentation.  Now, this isn't to say that there weren't elements that I found entertaining (gosh, am I saying this...), but overall this seemed to forget the foundation that it was built upon - even the perverse cameo at the end sent shivers up my spine.  Where did the creators go wrong?  Let's begin by saying that this was a concept, a cartoon, that Disney had no right placing their expensive hands into.I was hooked at the beginning surprisingly.  Why?  I wanted to see the birth of Gadget and the reason why Claw and him were always pitted against each other.  I wanted to see the creation of good and evil, but after twenty minutes, I saw Disney do what they do best.  Matthew Broderick nervously steps into a role that he obviously wasn't ready for.  He plays Gadget himself, a bumbling security cop who dreams of being a police officer.  Due to Rupert Everett's whining and obvious lack of knowledge of who Dr. Claw is, the two find themselves crossing each others paths at a bio-technology  lab where a new form of artificial intelligence is being designed.  There is a pretty girl/scientist (played by Joely Fisher) whom John Brown (Broderick, pre-Gadget) pines for, but cannot win because he doesn't have the confidence to win her over.  Well, we all know where this is headed next, and Disney lays it on thick as Broderick uses every torturous gadget in his disposal to eliminate ... not Dr. Claw, but a clone that is demolishing the city ... can he win?  I can't give it away, though it would make you better film viewers if I just blurted the ending ... who would pay money for this plastic form of entertainment.Alright, characters - there was no commentary on this film, so  I only watched it once (thankfully!), but Broderick was the obvious stand out.  He tried, I know I feel bad saying this, but he did try to bring some depth to this character.  Gadget is a bumbling idiot - but he has a good heart.  I thought Broderick was a good choice personality wise, but he never took Gadget to that next cinematic level.  I wanted to have the foundation of the cartoon, but then grow into a feature film that had heart and dedication.  In this mere 78 minute short film, there was nothing.  So, on one side we have Gadget (Broderick doing his best), then on the other side we have the worst Hollywood idea ever - Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw.  This was a hazard.  This was Disney thinking they could take a enormously popular villain and give him a soul.  This was Rupert needing to ham it up more than Broderick so that there was a share of the screen.  There was no evil, there was no corruption, there was nothing that even faintly resembled the ""Claw"" that we grew up with.  The henchman seemed more in tune than Everett.  He wasn't funny, he wasn't sinister, he wasn't diabolical in any way.  He was fluff, and that wasn't the Dr. Claw that I attempted to pay money to see.  His portrayal was a disgrace to anyone that has ever even glanced at the cartoon.  Arg, it makes me mad just to mention it in this review.  Rupert Everett ruined Dr. Claw.  Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) seemed to follow the Everett style of ""Gadet-ing"", but not following her character at all.  Shouldn't there have been a prerequisite to see the cartoon prior to making the film.  Oh, filmmakers, how I shun thee.I guess if one could literally pull themselves away from the hideous acting by Everett, the rest of the film just seemed raced and pushed.  I was happy to see that it only lasted 78 minutes, and they did cover quite a bit of ground, but it just felt like they weren't willing to give the credit due to the cartoon.  This was a cult cartoon, and to see Disney play for a younger audience, care nothing for the pre-existing older audience that grew up with Gadget, make jokes that seemed clich&eacute;, and bubble the bad guy.  It was hard to watch.  I was pleased with the script, the director tried to go dark with a really random Broderick attempting to play a darker, more fun character as Gadget's clone - but overall this film just  lacked the spunk from the cartoon.  I wanted animation, I wanted excitement, I wanted an adventure that would befuddle Adams himself, but instead I had a story that seemed like it would be in the dollar bin within the week of its release.Overall, this film wasn't horrid.  The story itself wasn't anything I could watch again, but their ability to not overextend the plot, made it for simple viewing.  It was 78 minutes of filming that I didn't mind, but couldn't get myself to watch it again.  I will forever hate Everett for what he did to Dr. Claw, I think Dr. Claw will forever hate Everett as well.  His portrayal ruined this film.  It knocked it to the ground with no opportunity to pick it up again.  Broderick was watchable, but I don't think he was what this film needed.  ""Inspector Gadget"" is a perfect example of what happens when Disney puts their hands into a project and is determined to ensure that children get laughs from semi-crass physical humor.  This was a sad attempt of a film, but a part of me is happy that I watched it - now the cartoon seems better than ever!Grade: ** out of *****",2,Bad Gadget.

The plot: catch the bad guys &amp; get the girl.  That's okay, because the way  that they go about is funny. The co-star looks good.  It's predictable, but  a 180 from the cartoon (which in a way is refreshing).  Inspector Gadget  (Matthew Broderick) is &quot;not&quot; the dim-witted, feigned hero like  his cartoon counterpart.  And Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) isn't the lil'  snoop that solves all the mysteries sans credit.  In fact Penny, uh, has no  role; the director tried to stay somewhat true to the cartoon Penny.  Nor  does Brain.  You'll like the way Gadget handles his evil twin- who is  concocted from the warped mind of Dr.Claw/Cotex (and whose teeth are  incredibly white!)  The only downsets are that Cotex (Rupert Everett) is,  to my knowledge, not from the cartoon.  And I dang sure know that Dr. Claw  is supposed to be covert and... not seen! If you pay meticulous attention-  the Cartoon Dr. Claw has a bionic right hand, not left.  Anywho, what  squirmed me right out of my theater seat was the annoying Gadgetmobile  personality (D.L. Hughley). I'm sawry, but D.L. was getting on my nerves,  yall, dang!  And I thought it was kinda cruel how Gadget's on the brink of  death and they metamorph him into the next &quot;Robocop&quot; without his  permission.

It's definitely not below average.Matthew Broderick is actually a good Inspector Gadget.  I think with the way movies are, many  people tend to want to see a different Inspector Gadget, perhaps someone  more violent.  Well, if that's the case...there is the Criterion edition of  Robocop with the added gory scenes that you can buy.  This movie was made  for kids as was the cartoon and I'm a kid at heart because I grew up with  the show.One of the things you'll notice is that it's a Disney DVD with  extra's.  Yes, it's a miracle isn't it.  The majority of all Disney DVD's  don't have squat in them.  This one has a 30 minute featurette on &quot;Go  Inside Inspector Gadget&quot;.&amp;#63728;&amp;#63728; &amp;#63728;It also  has a music video from Youngstown and the trailer.

This movie has the air about it that budgets ran dry and rather than scrap the movie altogether, it was rushed to production.Disney needs to raise the bar on their live action movies.

471257,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,6305616027,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[8, 11]","I grew up watching Inspector Gadget in the 1980's, and was always fascinated by Penny's computer book. Since I only had to make do with a now obsolete Commodore 64 computer system, I thought that one book was the coolest part of the show.Sure, living with an uncle who you were smarter than would occasionally challenge the nerves, but Gadget (whose first name was never revealed) also seemed like a genuinely nice guy who tried to do the right thing.Before she ruined Buffy, Michelle Trachtenberg defamed Penny. In this movie, she appears as a brunette who lacks a computer (book) or otherwise to help Uncle Gadget---and basically save the day. In fact, Trachtenberg is not doing much of anything during this screenplay.Matthew Broderick's Gadget in contrast, is a ladies man. He meets up with Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) who ultimately is Robo Brenda. Since this is a family film, nothing bad happens but the idea of Inspector Gadget attracting anybody is really hard to take. He's SUPPOSED to be a bumbler who does not get the woman, the anti-James Bond for kids.Chief Quimby's (Dabney Coleman) appearance also poses some problems. He is too old and too thin in this movie. Chief Quimby is supposed to be a rotund person with light brown hair.Finally, the crucial part of Dr. Claw's sinister persona is that the audience only sees his hand. Rupert Everett is not supposed to show his face or have an actual claw for a hand. The studios could have saved bundles of their precious money (and made this screen play more authentic) by hiring a literal nobody to sit behind a chair and speak into a voice distorter while an animatronic MAD cat was giggling in agreement. According to the cartoon, Dr. Claw actually had a metal gloved hand with a spiked gold bracelet.Since Andy Heyward oversaw production on both the earlier cartoon and then this movie, I am really shocked by the large discrepancies. If he cannot exercise product control over his own cartoon product, I really have no sympathy for this film's poor returns.

Zwick,"[1, 3]","Children and adults alike are decidedly ill served by &quot;Inspector Gadget,&quot; a frenetic but genuinely mirthless live action take on the popular Saturday morning cartoon series that mires poor Matthew Broderick  in the role of a nerdish do-gooder who gets the chance to live out his  heroic fantasies when he is converted into a one-man, self-contained crime  fighting cybernetic arsenal.Thanks to current state-of-the-art special  effects, the filmmakers manage to effectively translate the cartoonish  aspects of the original to the live action format. Despite a few glaringly  bad shots utilizing rear screen projection, the visuals that help to  realize the infinite gadgets at the inspector's disposal are genuinely  jaw-dropping.What the movie makers couldn't (or, at least, wouldn't)  come up with is a decent script - without which all the greatest special  effects in the world cannot a quality film make. Gadget is surrounded by a  gallery of dull, poorly written caricatures ranging from a giddy,  self-absorbed mayor, to a gruff, shortsighted chief of police, and an  effete mad scientist bent on creating an army of indestructible gadget  warriors, with which, of course, he (ho hum) plans to rule the world. Even  the newly &quot;hipified&quot; gadget mobile comes across as a charmless,  grating irritant as he provides a constant stream of witless one-liners as  running commentary to the action.Of the actors, Broderick and Rupert  Everett cannot be faulted since both provide a degree of enthusiasm wholly  unwarranted by the inferior screenplay with which they are saddled.
