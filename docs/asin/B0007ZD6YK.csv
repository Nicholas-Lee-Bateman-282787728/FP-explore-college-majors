On the seventh Sunday, we were bereft.  Its brilliance is undeniable.The cast is incredible - John Simm (Life on Mars), David Morrissey (later to attempt self-immolation of his career inBasic Instinct 2 (Unrated, Extended Cut)), Bill Nighy (Still Crazyand countless other classic, untouchable pieces of droll excellence), Polly Walker (Rome - The Complete First Season) and Kelly Macdonald (No Country for Old Men)...oh yeah, and a smaller role by one James McAvoy, since gone very large in little things like, oh,The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)andAtonement (Widescreen Edition).  He gets pumped up here with middle of the cover box treatment, but his role is smaller.The excellence of the production hangs on the intersection of journalist Cal McCaffrey, as portrayed by Simm, and MP Stephen Collins, as portrayed here by Morrissey.  To complicate issues between the two, Collins' winning campaign for MP was managed by McCaffrey, and there's the not small matter of Cal's less-than-subtle pining for Collins' wife (Walker).Over 500 IMDB reviewers have weighed in with an average review of 8.8 (on a 10 scale), pretty much a chart-blower by that discriminating audience  (The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption are 9.1).",5,Left bereft after 'State of Play' was over,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,1372,"['riveting', 'mini-series', 'BBC', 'television', 'drama', 'highest', 'order', 'watched', 'over', 'period', 'six', 'weeks', 'PBS', 'seventh', 'Sunday', 'were', 'bereft', 'brilliance', 'undeniable.The', 'cast', 'incredible', 'John', 'Simm', 'Life', 'Mars', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'later', 'attempt', 'self-immolation', 'career', 'inBasic', 'Instinct', '2', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Still', 'Crazyand', 'countless', 'other', 'classic', 'untouchable', 'pieces', 'droll', 'excellence', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'Rome', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'oh', 'yeah', 'smaller', 'role', 'one', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'gone', 'very', 'large', 'little', 'things', 'oh', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andAtonement', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'pumped', 'up', 'here', 'middle', 'cover', 'box', 'treatment', 'role', 'smaller.The', 'excellence', 'production', 'hangs', 'intersection', 'journalist', 'Cal', 'McCaffrey', 'portrayed', 'Simm', 'MP', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Morrissey', 'complicate', 'issues', 'two', 'Collins', 'winning', 'campaign', 'MP', 'was', 'managed', 'McCaffrey', 'not', 'small', 'matter', 'Cal', 'less-than-subtle', 'pining', 'Collins', 'wife', 'Walker', '.Over', '500', 'IMDB', 'reviewers', 'have', 'weighed', 'average', 'review', '8.8', '10', 'scale', 'pretty', 'much', 'chart-blower', 'discriminating', 'audience', 'Godfather', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'are', '9.1']",N/A

It is not now a question of whether it was done but who knew about knew that it was being done and who ordered it to be done.This extended BBC television drama is a tense exciting view of the interactions among powerful economic, political, communications and law enforcement elites. It is best viewed with an open mind, as a drama in which some guys (male and female) can be seen as Good, some as Evil, and, most, as some combination of the two. The acting is top-notch, ditto the script, ditto the direction, ditto the filming (cinematography). Depending on one's personal outlook one will sympathize with one or another individual character. It is to the credit of the creative staff that none comes out without being tarnished in some way, everyone fails to live up to the ideals of their roles. To what extent this fiction can be generalized beyond the specific case, as probably the writers desired, certainly, I could not say. My reading of the film is that it shows clearly that nobody comes to the table with clean hands regardless of their motives; I assume that is what the film was intended to show.The film begins with a murder and adds another early on. I found the revelations with regard to the perpetrator (one who saw that these were done) to be almost entirely subordinated to other concerns.

While investigating the teenage boy's death, newspaper reporters Cal McCaffrey (John Simm) and Della Smith (Kelly McDonald) realize that the youngster made a phone call to Sonia the morning they both died.

There's another wrinkle: McCaffrey once managed the Collins election campaign; in the wake of scandal, the embattled MP and his estranged wife Anne (Polly Walker) both turn to the conflicted McCaffrey for shelter and sympathy.From there, the drama gets increasingly complicated and messy; I won't give too much away (and have probably given away too much already).  The further Della, Cal, and their fellow journalists dig into the two deaths, the more scandal and conspiracy they uncover.  Part of the drama is political, part of it is personal, and all of it is riveting.  The script (six hour-long episodes) by Paul Abbott is taut and intelligent, allowing plenty of space for both plot and character, with a perfect balance of drama, humor, intrigue, and romance.  There's some nicely crunchy stuff in there about the dangerous mix of politics and big business and the importance of a free press, but those elements never overwhelm the narrative.  The suspense is spooled out perfectly over the six hours, and some of the action sequences are strongly reminiscent of the three Bourne movies.  Once you start watching this series, it's *very* hard to stop.The cast is large, and there's any number of sub-plots, but the writing and directing (David Yates) are so skillful and the characters so distinctive that it's no problem to keep track of everything.  Paying close attention to detail is a must; some clues are dropped in with diabolical subtlety.  The denouement and resolution hit all the right notes: the protagonists' ultimate victory comes at a huge personal cost.  The closing shot in particular is just aces.With such strong material, the cast has to be at the top of their game, and it's a testament to the quality of this series that there's not one weak performance in the lot.  Morrissey achieves just the right mix of unlikeable and sympathetic, playing a man who seems to have willfully screwed up his life; Walker is particularly sharp as his wounded, angry wife.  The team of journalists has terrific rapport and camaraderie, an intelligent, warm, likeable bunch, led by their acerbic editor, Cameron Foster (Bill Nighy, simply brilliant).  Foster's scenes facing off against the local DCI (Philip Glenister) are especially fun.  Marc Warren has a great turn as an unsavory witness/ suspect in the two deaths; James McAvoy does strong work as a freelance reporter with something to prove.  There are dozens of excellent performances among the third and fourth tier players, and even the one-shot walk-on characters are cast with admirable care.Special praise is due to John Simm for his outstanding work as Cal McCaffrey.  Cal is the heart of the story, its most sympathetic character, the guy viewers will instinctively root for--even when he does something incredibly stupid, it's impossible not to like him, to want things to work out for him.  Simm gives the character all sorts of tics and quirks and layers; he plays beautifully off the other actors (Cal's final confrontation with Stephen is just devastating); he's a presence even when he's not doing anything in particular.  It's just a wonderful, wonderful performance, a standout even in this uniformly stellar cast.For icing on the cake, there's some eye-catching visuals, and the soundtrack has an edgy, urban vibe.  If the multitude of accents and Brit-slang proves too much, one can flip on the handy subtitles.  Disappointingly, the DVD set is very thin on extra features; I would have loved to see some interviews with the cast and crew.  Viewers with kids in the house should be aware that ""State of Play"" is definitely R-rated, with moderate amounts of sex, violence, and swearing, as well as characters who drink and smoke almost nonstop.The DVD set was released in advance of a big-budget Hollywood adaptation that's due to hit cinemas next year.  With Helen Mirren and Russell Crowe in the cast, it might not be bad, but I'd nevertheless recommend giving the original a spin before checking out the re-make.",5,The West Wing Meets the Bourne

Tully ""comedy lover""","[4, 4]","This is a review of the mini-series and may contain SPOILERS!!This thriller is well done in every aspect, great writing and acting, taut direction with a gritty feel and frenetic pacing resulting in a teleplay that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and felt very realistic to me.  Although there were a few niggling details that, upon reflection, might have been somewhat at odds with the final resolution, on the whole I thought the exposition of the numerous characters and the ingredients necessary to build the intrigue, mystery and suspense through the 6 hour story was masterfully done.  And, like many thrillers of this genre, not every little detail is wrapped up neatly with a bow by the end, leaving several areas for interesting discussions among the thoughtful, analytic viewers.  I thought this series was a very interesting, satisfying and compelling way to spend 6 hours.I watched 3 episodes one night and the final three the next since I got one disc at a time from Netflix.  If I had purchased the dvd set or if it had been available on a streaming service I probably would have watched all 6 episodes in one night so plan accordingly.My biggest question concerning this story is how anyone thought they could squeeze this 6 hour mini-series into a 2 hour movie.  If you want to see a study in contrasts, watch the movie first, then the series.

In fact, the BBC series, ""State of Play,"" was so good that I  sat for 360 minutes watching it in its entirety.

I can hardly wait to play the commentaries of episodes one and six (but not tonight--or rather, this morning).I especially enjoyed the performances of John Simm as the persistent, but conflicted, investigative reporter; Bill Nighy in his inimitable persona as the crusty managing editor; and James McAvoy as the son, whom Nighy deigns to hire as long as the young man uses his mother's maiden name. All the characters were well developed and one came to care about them (although the Member of Parliament at the center of the budding scandal, was cast in what I think was a thankless role in that he emerged as a bit of a whiner).The BBC has provided English subtitles, so that not a word of the fast-paced script will be missed.I recommend this engrossing suspense yarn for anyone who likes to be kept on the edge of one's seat for six hours that will seem to fly by.",5,Ripping Newspaper Yarn!,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1335,"['discovered', 'BBC', 'series', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'only', 'watching', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'comparison', 'fact', 'BBC', 'series', 'State', 'Play', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'sat', '360', 'minutes', 'watching', 'entirety', 'As', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'acted', 'intelligent', 'political', 'thriller', 'had', 'riveted', 'television', 'set', 'extent', 'could', 'think', 'doing', 'nothing', 'else', 'plot', 'complex', 'twists', 'unfolded', 'conclusion', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'play', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'one', 'six', 'not', 'tonight', 'rather', 'morning', '.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'John', 'Simm', 'persistent', 'conflicted', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'inimitable', 'persona', 'crusty', 'managing', 'editor', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'son', 'whom', 'Nighy', 'hire', 'as', 'long', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'maiden', 'name', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'one', 'came', 'care', 'Member', 'Parliament', 'center', 'budding', 'scandal', 'was', 'cast', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'thankless', 'role', 'emerged', 'bit', 'whiner', '.The', 'BBC', 'provided', 'English', 'subtitles', 'so', 'not', 'word', 'fast-paced', 'script', 'will', 'be', 'missed.I', 'recommend', 'engrossing', 'suspense', 'yarn', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'kept', 'edge', 'one', 'seat', 'six', 'hours', 'will', 'seem', 'fly']",N/A

896665,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0007ZD6YK,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 3]","Political thrillers are always very tricky and difficult, maybe even dangerous. But the BBC loves those difficulties and carries them out with grace and effectiveness. The paramour of an English MP around 2005, hence quite obviously under a Labor government, dies by being pushed in front of an underground train in London. The MP is chairing a special committee on energy and is confronted to the hostility of oil companies and other energy lobbies. At the very same time a young black man is killed in an alley and another witness of this killing is shot though not dead. Are the three events connected since they happen in exactly the same time bracket, in sequence and in the same area?It will appear that the killer of the two people on the surface is the person who pushed the lady-friend of the MP, a lady who was important because she had just been hired by the MP for her energy competence and expertise, though it will appear that she was by far not the best qualified person and that she was very directly connected with one dominant oil company. So why was she hired? Pressure on the MP or favoritism from the MP? In the middle of the series we learn that she was pregnant, which the MP ignored. Most of the investigation is done by a small team of journalists and one important editor in one London newspaper. The police is marginalized by this active press team, and they resent it for a long time, though after a while they have to reckon the journalists have methods that enable them to get more information out of the witnesses, and even eventually the MP and other members of the majority and government. Just for this responsible but obstinate and constant role of English journalists this miniseries is a lesson to the world about the media, even concerning the clear pressure they are under from political bodies and from corporations, often disguised as some kind of criminal activity.To do that job is a real fight with the world, life and even death when a witness dies before questioning, or a murderer is shot dead at point blank by the special forces of the police preventing any kind of questioning and truth discovering, which can only come after an arrest, not a burial. The second genial element in this film is of course the tremendous case of lobbies, here oil and energy lobbies, and how they infiltrate all kinds of bodies to get direct information from inside, and at times this infiltration is done with the help and support of some members of the cabinet (ministers in other words, members of the government). They also use a lot of money to cover up all kinds of shady events and to pay all kinds of bills so that the beneficiaries are more lenient and attentive to their recommendations. That kind of lobbying is clearly criminal in the fact that it is always trying to hijack the political machine and to impose their interests as the norm for everyone. It is unjust, unequal, discriminatory, unreasonable most of the time, since it is the will of the very few who gets the ears of the decision makers of a nation and it is the interests of these few that are taken into account instead of the more objective needs of the vast majority, of the many. This miniseries is crystal clear about that kind of functioning and the perverse effects it may have on the governmental and legislative machines. But the film is a lot more than just that.It is full of suspense and that suspense never stops till the very last minute of the sixth episode. The suspense is about the role of the MP, the determination of his best friend, the freelance journalist leading the investigation, the wavering of the MP's wife who should be irreversibly angry at that paramour and affair, and at the pregnancy of that outsider, and she should either accept the situation for the sake of their children, or ask for a divorce, the second probably first. But she beats about the bush and develops an affair with the journalist for the obvious reason of getting some information from him, and drops him at the end with the beautiful words ""arrogant prick"".

It says in the commentary that the first victim's killer was changed halfway through filming by the writer, something no one else here seems to mention, and to me that was only being too clever by half. Not being able to give away the plot, I can only say here that events occurred in the first half of the movie that were never answered in the second half, and that the ultimate 'killer's' motivation was totally unclear in light of previous events, and hardly cleared up in the ending. Still, I do have to give the movie 3 stars for some taut directing and excellent performances, especially by the wonderful Bill Nighy as the newspaper editor. (Although, not to denigrate the performance of the actor who played the antagonist Stephen Collin, he was forced to present us with a character of such raw emotion and physical temper that to believe he was such a successful politician that he being groomed for a cabinet post is fairly laughable.) In any event, in a thriller the script should always come first, and it was here that the movie was at least for me unnecessarily contrived and fatally flawed.

896677,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B0007ZD6YK,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 2]","It isn't often that something literally comes along and changes the standards of a viewer for an entire genre. By the time I got through the nearly six hour of State Of Play the first time around, that was exactly what had happened to me. Having watched it again in virtually one sitting I am once again surprised not only by how well the mini-series holds up during a second (or in my case fourth) viewing but just how high the quality of the mini-series really is.To begin with, the series features one essential element for any good story: good and believable characters played by fine actors. The cast of the series is top notch and is led by John Simm as newspaper reporter Cal McCaffrey and David Morrissey as British politician Stephen Collins who both give two incredibly gripping yet believable performances. While this is true of the entire series this fact is especially true during the final minutes of the series when things effectively become a two-hand play between Simm and Morrissey and their respective characters. It's easy to imagine how these characters could have been played differently but here, in this series, these performances are (to use words I don't sue very often) absolutely perfect.That's not to say that the rest of the cast is lacking by any means, far from it in fact. The supporting cast features fantastic performances that are just as gripping and believable as the performances of the mini-series two leads. The cast ranges Kelly Macdonald as reporter Della Smith, James McAvoy as reporter Dan Foster, Polly Walker as Coliins wife Anne, Stuart Goodwin as the mysterious Robert Bingham and the ever magnificent Bill Nighy as newspaper editor Cameron Foster. There is many more of course many others, but these are just a few of the fantastic performances to be found in State Of Play.There are also the production values to consider as well. One of the best things about State Of Play is the fact that one could believe that this could whole sequence of events is really just a headline away at any moment. Much of the credit of that goes to the production design of Donald Woods and the costumes of Claire Anderson both of which anchor the series firmly in reality. Then there's the incredible fly-on-the-wall cinematography by Chris Seager which manages not only to compliment the reality of the production design and costumes but gives the entire mini-series a documentary feel as well, all of which is helped by the editing of Mark Day. There's also the sparingly used, but highly effective, score by composer Nicholas Hooper which does what a good score is supposed to do: give additional emotional depth to any scene it appears in. All together the result is some of the strongest production values you're ever likely to see in a TV mini-series.The real success of the realistic feel of State Of Play lies not in how good the production values are but in the writing of scriptwriter Paul Abbott. Abbott has created a story that feels as though it could be ripped from tomorrow's headlines in a cautionary tale about the sometime fuzzy line between major corporations and those in government whoa re supposed to oversee them, in this case the corporation being a fictional but plausible British oil company and its lobbyists. The mini-series also takes a look at the modern news industry, how it gathers news, where it gets its information from and how pressure can be brought to bare if there's a story too damaging to those in high and powerful places. To do all this successfully and believably, Abbott forgoes many of the thriller clich&eacute;s of rather tired action sequences and instead (and rightfully in my humble opinion anyway) focuses on the characters and their dialogue which leads to close six hours of fantastic dialogue and an incredible plot. If anything makes State Of Play worth seeing it is the plot which sets a new standard in just how many twists and turns one can fit in a seemingly easily clich&eacute;d plot. The result is a complex a mini-series that leaves a first-time viewer ever seeking answers and those who've seen it before looking and finding new clues with every viewing. In short: it's a first class script without any doubt.So what is State Of Play? It is a fantastic thriller containing some truly fantastic yet believable performances, fine production values and a first-rate script that never sinks into clich&eacute;s. Yet it also something that is increasingly rare today. By doing all of those things it succeeds in doing something truly spectacular: it changes and raises the standards for an entire genre with it. If you can say nothing else you can say that State Of Play is what a good thriller ought to be.",5,What A Good Thriller Ought To Be,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,4702,"[""n't"", 'often', 'something', 'literally', 'along', 'standards', 'viewer', 'entire', 'genre', 'time', 'got', 'nearly', 'six', 'hour', 'State', 'Play', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Having', 'watched', 'again', 'virtually', 'one', 'sitting', 'am', 'once', 'again', 'surprised', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'well', 'mini-series', 'up', 'second', 'case', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'just', 'how', 'high', 'quality', 'mini-series', 'really', 'is.To', 'begin', 'series', 'one', 'essential', 'element', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'believable', 'characters', 'played', 'fine', 'actors', 'cast', 'series', 'top', 'notch', 'led', 'John', 'Simm', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Cal', 'McCaffrey', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'British', 'politician', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'who', 'give', 'two', 'incredibly', 'gripping', 'yet', 'believable', 'performances', 'true', 'entire', 'series', 'fact', 'especially', 'true', 'final', 'minutes', 'series', 'when', 'things', 'effectively', 'become', 'two-hand', 'play', 'Simm', 'Morrissey', 'respective', 'characters', 'easy', 'imagine', 'how', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'differently', 'here', 'series', 'performances', 'are', 'use', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'sue', 'very', 'often', 'absolutely', 'perfect.That', 'not', 'say', 'rest', 'cast', 'lacking', 'means', 'far', 'fact', 'supporting', 'cast', 'features', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'gripping', 'believable', 'performances', 'mini-series', 'two', 'leads', 'cast', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'reporter', 'Della', 'Smith', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'reporter', 'Dan', 'Foster', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'Coliins', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Stuart', 'Goodwin', 'mysterious', 'Robert', 'Bingham', 'ever', 'magnificent', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'Cameron', 'Foster', 'many', 'more', 'course', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'be', 'found', 'State', 'Play.There', 'are', 'also', 'production', 'values', 'consider', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'State', 'Play', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'believe', 'could', 'whole', 'sequence', 'events', 'really', 'just', 'headline', 'away', 'moment', 'Much', 'credit', 'production', 'design', 'Donald', 'Woods', 'costumes', 'Claire', 'Anderson', 'anchor', 'series', 'firmly', 'reality', 'Then', 'incredible', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'cinematography', 'Chris', 'Seager', 'not', 'only', 'compliment', 'reality', 'production', 'design', 'costumes', 'entire', 'mini-series', 'documentary', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'helped', 'editing', 'Mark', 'Day', 'also', 'sparingly', 'used', 'highly', 'effective', 'score', 'composer', 'Nicholas', 'Hooper', 'what', 'good', 'score', 'supposed', 'do', 'give', 'additional', 'emotional', 'depth', 'scene', 'together', 'result', 'strongest', 'production', 'values', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'TV', 'mini-series.The', 'real', 'success', 'realistic', 'feel', 'State', 'Play', 'not', 'how', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'writing', 'scriptwriter', 'Paul', 'Abbott', 'Abbott', 'created', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'ripped', 'tomorrow', 'headlines', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'sometime', 'fuzzy', 'line', 'major', 'corporations', 'government', 'whoa', 're', 'supposed', 'oversee', 'case', 'corporation', 'being', 'fictional', 'plausible', 'British', 'oil', 'company', 'lobbyists', 'mini-series', 'also', 'look', 'modern', 'news', 'industry', 'how', 'news', 'where', 'information', 'how', 'pressure', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'bare', 'story', 'too', 'damaging', 'high', 'powerful', 'places', 'do', 'successfully', 'believably', 'Abbott', 'forgoes', 'many', 'thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'rather', 'tired', 'action', 'sequences', 'instead', 'rightfully', 'humble', 'opinion', 'anyway', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'close', 'six', 'hours', 'fantastic', 'dialogue', 'incredible', 'plot', 'anything', 'State', 'Play', 'seeing', 'plot', 'new', 'standard', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'twists', 'one', 'can', 'fit', 'seemingly', 'easily', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'plot', 'result', 'complex', 'mini-series', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'ever', 'seeking', 'answers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'looking', 'finding', 'new', 'clues', 'viewing', 'short', 'first', 'class', 'script', 'doubt.So', 'what', 'State', 'Play', 'fantastic', 'thriller', 'containing', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'yet', 'believable', 'performances', 'fine', 'production', 'values', 'first-rate', 'script', 'never', 'clich', 'eacute', 'also', 'something', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'today', 'doing', 'things', 'doing', 'something', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'standards', 'entire', 'genre', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'State', 'Play', 'what', 'good', 'thriller', 'ought', 'be']",N/A

The movie is very good, but the miniseries--with its more clearly delineated characters and its greater sense of tragedy--has to be one of the best television shows I have ever seen. Paul Abbott's writing is a marvel, combining an intricate yet coherent plot with dazzling dialogue.

896682,AI0PV0FQLGEAY,B0007ZD6YK,Natalie Dressed,"[1, 2]","Forget the lame 2009 movie of the same name; the 2003 BBC miniseries that inspired it is the keeper. Think of this as an updated and sexier version of All The President's Men, but with an ending you can't guess at.I first saw this excellent six-part political murder mystery in the UK, where it enthralled everyone for weeks. It totally deserved the gaggle of BAFTAs it won. I'm delighted to have it now on DVD, especially as it features commentary for the first and last episodes.The extremely complex story starts with a bang, literally: two supposed drug-related shootings and the apparent suicide of a House of Commons researcher occur on the same morning in modern-day London. The plot thickens as these disparate incidents appear to intersect with the private life of a rising MP. We tag along as two newspaper investigative journalists assigned to cover these stories dig to expose the truth while navigating through a sea of lies and top-down opposition.State of Play is a dizzy roller coaster ride that requires a tight seat belt and rapt attention. On the technical side everything works superbly: the writing, direction, production design, camera work, editing and music are all first rate. But oh, the acting! Simply stellar.Whoever assembled the British cast for this show deserves a thank-you note for making some inspired choices. John Simm and Kelly MacDonald are spot on as hard-working reporters following an obscure trail that seems to point to  government corruption. Bill Nighy is a delight as their tough-minded, tart-tongued editor; he gets the best lines and pitches them perfectly. James McAvoy is the charming, scrappy outsider invited to join the team, and Marc Warren is hilarious as a weasily lobbyist with the IQ of a light bulb (love the coat, darling). Polly Walker is the cuckolded politician's wife who is attracted to Simm's character on the rebound; and David Morrissey (be still, my heart!) is splendid as the tall, attractive MP caught in the maelstrom.In summary: Like All The President's Men, this miniseries will never get old. Indeed, IMO it should be seen repeatedly as the years pass. Why? Because while politicians may change, their quest for power never does.

Or watching people prostitute themselves for their 15 minutes of fame by appearing on shows like The Apprentice, or Survivor.Our cable and day time TV, even worse, Dr. Phil? Please, give me the chance to be on TV and I'll let you rip me apart emotionally. But if one surfs long enough, you can find outstanding shows.The Brits don't do long dragged out series, the original Office, six episodes per season, two seasons.  MI-5, six episodes per season and we are up to six seasons. Wire In The Blood, Silent Witness, six episodes per season and still going strong.  Life on Mars which sadly the writers only allowed two seasons of 6 episodes each, concluded this year. All fine shows, made without the being lowered to lowest common denominator.State Of Play is not only in the same class as those shows referenced above, but in fact may surpass. Others have set out the plot line, and intrigue so I won't revisit or reveal more.However, I strongly suggest purchasing and viewing this excellent mini-series because as with anything of any quality, American producers have grabbed a hold of this and are going to turn it into a movie. And not like the Lord of the Rings kind of movie where all of the plots and subplots play out over three movies. No, they are going to take 350 minutes of high drama, political intrigue, and the presses inability to provide objective coverage without undue influence, and if we are lucky, we will receive 120 minutes, or approximately 1/3 of the story.Save yourself the trouble of paying for a cheap knockoff, and watch the real thing. Turn off those ""reality"" shows, tell Dr. Phil that pop psychology as entertainment is not only unethical, but pathetic, not just on the part of the shows' guests, but on the host himself.BBC may only be able to keep producing quality shows if their viewer ship extends beyond their advertising free public airwaves.

All three stand at cross-purposes, yet secretly acknowledge that none can succeed without careful consideration of the other two. Vital communication often runs deep underneath the observed interactions between the groups, taking place in back-room meetings and clandestine e-mails, and through veiled threats."" Judge ArsenaultHaving just come off the viewing of 10 weeks of the critically acclaimed HBO's TV show 'The Wire', I needed a pick me up, and wowser did I find one. This BBC 6 show series that aired in 2004 has it all and it is an even toss up with me as to which show is best, 'The Wire' or 'State of Play'. In both series the acting is superb. Bill Nighy as the wry, buttoned down, full of himself editor of the Herald hits the mark every time and won the UK's Best Actor award.  Polly Walker known to most of us from HBO's 'Rome' is the politician's wife and is flawless. David Morrissey, as the politician, John Simm and Kelly Macdonald as the intrepid reporters for the Herald mark this cast as fully realized.The shotgun murder of a drug-related killing, and the apparent accidental death of Sonia Baker, a researcher for Member of Parliament Stephen Collins seems unrelated. The one difference is the makings of a scandal when the news of Sonia's death hits the streets. Stephen Collins the Parliament member who employed Sonia is visibly shocked and upset when her death is announced.  The editor of the Herald suspects some hanky-panky and sends two of his best investigative reporters out to look the matter over. Cal McCaffrey and Della Smith find that these two deaths are not only related but were linked to the oil industry and the British government. One scandal after another is uncovered and this minor story soon leaps to the largest story of the year.The story of corruption and mayhem and lies and deceit are all realistic. The fact that the media, government and industry could all be in collusion seems all too true to those of us in the US looking at the war in Iraq and what has been wrought. What we don't count on is that once we think we have everything figured out, a new twist occurs. Some of this is a little over the top, but the superb acting counters any fallacy.'State Of Play' shines on the media, in this case, the newspaper, the Herald. Financial success is intertwined with the government, and it is not easy to convince the CEO and the board that publishing the story is the right thing to do. Everyone in this series is touched in some manner by the final decisions and actions that take place. The action, the suspense, the writing, the cinematography are all as one to produce one of the best BBC series I have viewed.  Helen Mirren and Russell Crowe are at this moment filming a movie version of this series. We have the best here, how could they ever top this series?Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-13-08The Girl in the Cafe8 1/2 Women",5,"Incestuous Interplay Between Politics, Media, and Industry",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,3175,"['more', 'compelling', 'moments', 'series', 'come', 'not', 'various', 'subplots', 'surround', 'mystery', 'front', 'great', 'mystery', 'indeed', 'how', 'indoctrinate', 'incestuous', 'interplay', 'politics', 'media', 'industry', 'are', 'modern', 'information', 'age', 'three', 'stand', 'cross-purposes', 'yet', 'secretly', 'acknowledge', 'none', 'can', 'succeed', 'careful', 'consideration', 'other', 'two', 'Vital', 'communication', 'often', 'deep', 'observed', 'interactions', 'groups', 'taking', 'place', 'back-room', 'meetings', 'clandestine', 'e-mails', 'veiled', 'threats', 'Judge', 'ArsenaultHaving', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'viewing', '10', 'weeks', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'HBO', 'TV', 'show', 'Wire', 'needed', 'pick', 'wowser', 'did', 'find', 'one', 'BBC', '6', 'show', 'series', 'aired', '2004', 'even', 'up', 'show', 'best', 'Wire', ""'State"", 'Play', 'series', 'acting', 'superb', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'wry', 'buttoned', 'down', 'full', 'editor', 'Herald', 'mark', 'time', 'won', 'UK', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'known', 'most', 'HBO', ""'Rome"", 'politician', 'wife', 'flawless', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'politician', 'John', 'Simm', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'intrepid', 'reporters', 'Herald', 'mark', 'cast', 'fully', 'shotgun', 'murder', 'drug-related', 'killing', 'apparent', 'accidental', 'death', 'Sonia', 'Baker', 'researcher', 'Member', 'Parliament', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'unrelated', 'one', 'difference', 'makings', 'scandal', 'when', 'news', 'Sonia', 'death', 'streets', 'Stephen', 'Parliament', 'member', 'who', 'employed', 'Sonia', 'visibly', 'shocked', 'upset', 'when', 'death', 'announced', 'editor', 'Herald', 'hanky-panky', 'two', 'best', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'out', 'look', 'matter', 'Cal', 'McCaffrey', 'Della', 'Smith', 'find', 'two', 'deaths', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'related', 'were', 'linked', 'oil', 'industry', 'British', 'government', 'One', 'scandal', 'uncovered', 'minor', 'story', 'soon', 'largest', 'story', 'year.The', 'story', 'corruption', 'mayhem', 'lies', 'deceit', 'are', 'realistic', 'fact', 'media', 'government', 'industry', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'collusion', 'too', 'true', 'US', 'looking', 'war', 'Iraq', 'been', 'wrought', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'once', 'think', 'have', 'everything', 'figured', 'out', 'new', 'twist', 'occurs', 'little', 'top', 'superb', 'acting', 'counters', 'fallacy', ""'State"", 'Play', 'shines', 'media', 'case', 'newspaper', 'Herald', 'Financial', 'success', 'intertwined', 'government', 'not', 'easy', 'convince', 'CEO', 'board', 'publishing', 'story', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Everyone', 'series', 'touched', 'manner', 'final', 'decisions', 'actions', 'take', 'place', 'action', 'suspense', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'one', 'produce', 'one', 'best', 'BBC', 'series', 'have', 'viewed', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'are', 'moment', 'filming', 'movie', 'version', 'series', 'have', 'best', 'here', 'how', 'could', 'ever', 'top', 'series', 'Highly', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '03-13-08The', 'Girl', 'Cafe8', '1/2', 'Women']",N/A

I discovered State of Play quite by accident when checking out James MacAvoy's filmography. John Simm was totally unknown to me and was great in the lead role. David Morissey, Bill Nighy, Kelly MacDonald, Polly Walker, and of course, James MacAvoy filled out the main cast. I was immediately drawn into the story and couldn't wait for each installment. I then made the mistake of watching the movie with Ben Affleck and Russell Crowe, for comparison. I love Ben and Russell, but it was so disappointing, even though by then I was in on the twists in the plot, the original story was so much better than the one they ended up with in the movie. Sometimes you just cannot get the same results from a story without taking some time to let the plot and characters develop. This is a case in point.
