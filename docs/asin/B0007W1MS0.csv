892045,A1X64N40QUEVZ1,B0007W1MS0,ac,"[8, 9]","It's hard to be familiar with the movies of Takashi Miike. Despite seeing the majority of his films released in America (and even a few that have yet to be released here), it's hard not to feel like I've lost something in translation. I can appreciate the humor, the violence, the plotlines, etc but there are usually parts that confuse me, and his movies typically require repeated watchings.  It's not that I'm particularly new to the films he creates or the films of Japanese directors in general (""Tetsuo"" creator Tsukamoto is probably my favorite director); the point I'm trying to illustrate is that you have to WANT to appreciate his films. You have to work hard sometimes to get into what he's doing, because he often throws conventional plot points, ""hooks"" that grab you, and structure out the window. Even his most fairly straightforward films take many detours into the bizarre (see the tank randomly showing up in ""Family"" or the rocket launcher that comes out on nowhere in at least two of his films!)...So, it's not surprising that this is one of the lesser-recieved of Miike's works. Using the ""hook"" of a sword fighting epic initially gets people interested in this film, but seeing no conventional plot or point to what is happening throws people off. This confuses me -- though I definitely didn't grasp everything upon the first viewing of this, I was still instantly amazed at what Miike has set up here: A journey through one man's tortured soul. Even if you don't feel like you understand everything that's happening, you still realize this film is genius -- maybe you just haven't figured out why yet.Upon repeated viewings, however, I figured out why. As another reviewer mentioned, you have to kind of look in between the lines. This film is powerful, epic, emotional, and even darkly comedic. On the surface, this film is basically just a journey through someone's afterlife. However, beyond that, the film pours on flashy imagery, ultraviolence, and heavy emotion to an almost suffocating degree.  In a lot of ways, this film reminds me of ""El Topo"" -- a movie that is disguised as a genre effort (El Topo being a Western, this being a samurai swordfighting film) that just uses the basic genre outlines and explores topics deeper than have ever been covered in the genre before.I think those who overlook this film simply were expecting a straightforward swordfighting movie, which this film clearly isn't. It's way better than that, and it's honestly probably the best film to come out in the last decade.  Don't write this off after one viewing, it REQUIRES repeated viewings.

It's because of my love for his movies that I'm willing to forgive him this movie.The best way to describe Izo is take a little Kill Bill Vol. 1 with The Grudge, throw it into a blender and chop the hell out of it until it's a formless, tasteless (and I mean this in more than one way) mass of senseless violence and confusing plot lines. To garnish, place laughing flowers (which make an appearance in the movie) on the side with the birth fluid (which also makes an appearance, as a woman licks it from her fingers). And then feed it to the dog and wait a while for him to go to the bathroom. What's left behind is Izo.Seriously, nothing in this movie made any sense after the first ten minutes, and I can say that even the first ten minutes made no sense, but isn't that true in all movies? The violence is indeed senseless and very repetitive. You never quite know where or at what time period Izo is at. In truth, all this movie was was an exercise in patience.

I'm not exactly sure what I just watched, but I know it was great.You've got the fierce warrior Izo, who is brutally murdered and then his soul seeks some closure.  Or rest.  But his spirit is denied at the gates of both heaven and hell.  So the soul wanders aimlessly, trapped within himself, feeling eternally restless and bitter.  He then embarks on a ruthless rampage of death, destruction, and mayhem that is visually spectacular.The plot linear structure is intentionally wavering and sporadic, maybe in an attempt to make you also feel lost.  There are some amazing action sequences that reminded me of Matrix, Kill Bill, and Ichi the Killer.  With this exploration of life after death comes a strong level of surrealism portrayed, which I thought was imaginative and entertaining.  I also loved the showdown between Izo and big Bob Sapp, way too cool.This film is generous with the blood and the swordplay, but it's abstract notions and problems with continuity might not appeal to many viewers.

It's definitely strange enough and bloody enough but it's also too long, too boring and it doesn't have that Miike feel to it, like say DEADLY OUTLAW: REKKA, ICHI THE KILLER, YAKUZA DEMON or GOZU.  It felt like Miike was just cashing a check.From what I gathered Izo was an evil samurai who's crucified and speared to death.  His spirit goes into an eternal Hell where he uncontrollably jumps from place to place throughout time and dimensions.  Wherever he lands he kills people then just jumps to somewhere else and he does this over and over again and again and again for two hours.Unless you're a diehard Miike fan I'd skip it.

And I can truly say that I have never seen a movie like this.Now I am reviewing the red sun version.  I though the picture quality could have been a lot better and it was full screened.  Thos 2 things are fine because I have seen way worst full screens and the picture quality was fine just not great for a 2004 film.  Now my biggest problem was the music.  I actually like that kind of music, but to the reviewer 2 below me, do you speak japanese or something.THE SONGS HAVE NO SUBTITLES AND THERE IS LIKE 15 MINUTES OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DIALOGUE THAT I MISSED.  I KNOW THE SONGS HAD A HUGE PART IN THE MOVIE, I MEAN THIS GUY HAD LIKE A 5 MINUTE SOLO PERFORMANCE LIKE IT WAS A MUSIC VIDEO.  I mean I just can't comment on the music because I need to know the owrds when it is just one guy and his guitar, I MEAN COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Now the way I felt about this movie is that it is a VERY unique movie.  You never really know what the hell is going on because he is always being trasported to like another dimension I guess.  Well not that, but, well, I don't know what the hell was going on!The way I felt for most of the movie was like Izo needed to keep on killing people, but the more people he kills, the more he hurts inside.  But he has to keep killing.  After about an hour it actually says just that just not in so many words.  But the killing actually comes to a halt for a little while.  But only for more obscene scenes.  So we see a lot of anti-war themes and many other analogies.  But it is all too clear what the main purpose of this movie was.  Death.I have only seen 1 other miike film, deadly outlaw: rekka.  And I have to say I like that .  Being a huge samurai film fan, I picked this up.  Me and the person who recommended this to me are going to have a talk about this though.  It really just idn't sit well with me.The only special feature is a behind the scenes with japanese suntitles only.  It is still pretty cool to watch though, so I guess a 3 out 5 for the special features.So while I cannot recommend this movie for anybody, I do have to say that I am like the only person I know that didn't like fear and loathing.  So if you check out my reviews you will see that I gave gojoe a 5/5, and that's why this was recommended to me.  And while I have reviewed at least 200 hundred kung fu movies on here, I cannot put this in the fu category.

I too am a fan of his work, mostly because he's broken so many boundaries in filmmaking that the society needs to create new boundaries just so he can break them.To say he's a cinematic genius is a bit of an understatement.  He has done so many films it's hard to really know what his style is, since he never does the same thing with each film, each time he always does something a little different.  I'm fairly certain that as we live and breathe that Miike's name will stand next to some of the other great extravagant filmmakers like David Lynch or even David Cronenberg.anyway, I'm getting off topic here.  Trying to describe or even explain just what is going on with the movie 'Izo' is not exactly easy, because you need to see the film itself.  It's not so much a film as an experience.The story essentially is about an ancient samurai warrior named Izo, he was the most brutal assassin there ever was, and he was put to death, he was crucified, but even then he couldn't die because he wasn't allowed into Heaven or even Hell.  This frustration only fuels Izo's rage and so he sets about cutting a path throughout history to find the ones in charge, the Gods if you will and to eliminate them and damn anyone who gets in his way.  And so for the next two hours we get Izo doing exactly that, killing all sorts of people, leaving a trail of bodies left and right, up and down, inside out and upside down all over the place as he makes his way to the those in charge.  it's an insane tale because no one is safe from Izo's wrath, both the guilty and the innocent, his own mother, innocent children, a couple about to get married, vampires, gun toting soldiers, no one is safe.Essentially the story can be viewed as one man's fight against the establishment, how one person all alone fights against insurmountable odds to achieve his goals.  Throughout the film people basically try and plead with him, try to reason with him to stop what he's doing to just repent before its too late, or in other words to just give up and sell out and give up his individual freedom to do what he wants, his obsession is admirable but is also a bit flawed, because this film also showcases that violence is a never ending cycle as depicted in a very brilliant scene with Izo running on the symbol of infinity.  There has to come a moment when enough is enough, because when all you know in your life is violence, there is nothing left for anything else, like love or peace or happiness, and this can be seen as over the course of the film Izo's anger, and bloodlust slowly transform him into a demonic creature, because with each life he takes he loses more and more of his humanity.The acting, the action, the special effects, the camera work, everything is awesome.  Of course its the sort of quality you tend to associate with a Miike film.After watching this film, the only thing I have to ask myself is 'what is he going to do next?'  I'm sure after you watch this film you'll be thinking the exact same thing, at least I hope you will.Highly Recommended!",5,Another classic mindtrip courtesy of Takashi Miike,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,3233,"['fiancee', 'huge', 'fan', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'most', 'part', 'huge', 'fan', 'work', 'possibly', 'most', 'certifiably', 'insane', 'man', 'ever', 'get', 'camera', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'too', 'am', 'fan', 'work', 'mostly', 'broken', 'so', 'many', 'boundaries', 'filmmaking', 'society', 'create', 'new', 'boundaries', 'just', 'can', 'break', 'them.To', 'say', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'bit', 'understatement', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'hard', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'style', 'never', 'same', 'thing', 'film', 'time', 'always', 'something', 'little', 'different', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'live', 'breathe', 'Miike', 'name', 'will', 'stand', 'next', 'other', 'great', 'extravagant', 'filmmakers', 'David', 'Lynch', 'even', 'David', 'Cronenberg.anyway', ""'m"", 'getting', 'off', 'topic', 'here', 'Trying', 'describe', 'even', 'explain', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'easy', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'experience.The', 'story', 'essentially', 'ancient', 'samurai', 'warrior', 'named', 'Izo', 'was', 'most', 'brutal', 'assassin', 'ever', 'was', 'was', 'put', 'death', 'was', 'crucified', 'even', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'die', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'Heaven', 'even', 'Hell', 'frustration', 'only', 'Izo', 'rage', 'so', 'cutting', 'path', 'history', 'find', 'ones', 'charge', 'Gods', 'will', 'eliminate', 'damn', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'so', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'get', 'Izo', 'doing', 'exactly', 'killing', 'sorts', 'people', 'leaving', 'trail', 'bodies', 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'upside', 'down', 'place', 'way', 'charge', 'insane', 'tale', 'one', 'safe', 'Izo', 'wrath', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'own', 'mother', 'innocent', 'children', 'couple', 'get', 'married', 'vampires', 'gun', 'toting', 'soldiers', 'one', 'safe.Essentially', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'man', 'fight', 'establishment', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'alone', 'fights', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'achieve', 'goals', 'film', 'people', 'basically', 'try', 'plead', 'try', 'reason', 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'just', 'repent', 'too', 'late', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'sell', 'out', 'give', 'up', 'individual', 'freedom', 'do', 'what', 'obsession', 'admirable', 'also', 'bit', 'flawed', 'film', 'also', 'violence', 'never', 'ending', 'cycle', 'depicted', 'very', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'Izo', 'running', 'symbol', 'infinity', 'come', 'moment', 'when', 'enough', 'enough', 'when', 'know', 'life', 'violence', 'nothing', 'left', 'anything', 'else', 'love', 'peace', 'happiness', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'course', 'film', 'Izo', 'anger', 'bloodlust', 'slowly', 'transform', 'demonic', 'creature', 'life', 'more', 'more', 'humanity.The', 'acting', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'camera', 'work', 'everything', 'awesome', 'course', 'sort', 'quality', 'tend', 'associate', 'Miike', 'film.After', 'watching', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'ask', 'going', 'do', 'next', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'least', 'hope', 'will.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

892059,A1JMYZA3MR27WC,B0007W1MS0,"Wux Iapan ""Fantas""","[6, 8]","A simple idea: a man is being killed somewhen far in the past but his soul turns into a wandering spirit that is drifting throught it's own inner hell. In my opinion the conclusion could be understood purely psychological: if you hate the world the world will hate you because your hate will be understood and answered the same way, like it or not.Philosophical in a way, this movie is infinitly uncompromising. Imagine Kill Bill, remove the ""Assasin squad"" and replace it with all sorts of historical enemies, ranging from samurai spirits to demon killers to demons to Yakuzas to SWAT teams to school kids to female teachers to infernal whores to a wedding banquet to your own mother... the list goes on and there's more blood and guts here than in Ichi the killer, a lot more actually. The gods are dressed like business men, commanding all those historical enemies to stop Izo from crushing them.Izo hates everything that exists and so does everything that exists hate Izo, but nothing 'really' exists. Izo is a wandering soul that has no soul, he is the ""infinite absurdity"". This movie is the most consequent version of the classic 'never ending hell' tale. Long after Izo has begun killing everyone standing in his way, he and the audience comes to realize that there is no way, there is no goal, there is only the neverending slaughter and vengeance of everything, hell is repetition with no end, violence leads to more violence. Izo somehow symbolizes the capacity of violence, so it's only logic he can't die. As long as violence comes his way in the guise of his attackers, he continues to exist. Yeah, it's that simple and the formula isn't going to change untill the very end of the movie.There's hardly a minute without arterial sprays, hardly a character that is not being slaughtered sooner or later, no matter who it is: buddha, lovers, demons, cops, kids... sometimes it's almost funny (the wedding banquet...). I believe there are certain similiarties to Miike's ""Graveyard of honor"" in which a yakuza is going to battle against the rest of the world. To me, both characters could be understood as an allegory to social behaviour and historical events.The furthermore sadistic aspect of the movie is that Izo cannot die but is suffering just as much as his victims, violence goes where violence comes from. Sometimes Izo is surrounded by a dozen enemies, he's fighting one toe-to-toe while the others keep stabbing their knives, swords and stuff into Izo's bleeding body that therefore is covered in blood with countless injuries throughout the whole film, every attack is a painful experience for Izo and is being responded with more violence. Repeat that around a thousand times and yeah, that's pretty much what this movie is all about on screen. It's like playing GTA with the ""everybody's attacking you""-cheat... It all begins with Izo's execution at the beginning of the movie which has to be one of the goriest and most painful in film history.If you truly hate somebody and need to release some mental tension, that is the movie for you. It's an endless and pretty mindless killing spree, the dialogues are beautiful, visuals as well, it's Takashi Miike, it's very brutal, and, frankly, very very boring. Sure, every sword battle is skillfully shot as if Miike has never done anything else but this sort of films. Nevertheless, it's for the first time I remember that I was watching the last 20 minutes in spooling speed. I knew these 20 minutes would show nothing else but another 100 (at minimum) sword executions and I was right but didn't want to miss the ending. It's a pretty long movie but it seems even longer reagarding it's repetive nature and background message that should be clear to anyone around 4000 deaths before the final conclusion. At the end, thank god, it all becomes symbolic when Izo is standing on a bizar platform that is part of the 'symbol of neverending infinity', realizing, that for deliverance, there has to be another way to go than hate and vengeance. One could sense a political statement here but regarding the fact that with AUDITITION there was absolutly no social commentary intended by neither the director nor the screen writer, IZO could as well be seen as just another killer freak show for pure sick entertainment.",3,takes cinematic bodycount to a whole new level,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,4284,"['simple', 'idea', 'man', 'being', 'killed', 'somewhen', 'far', 'past', 'soul', 'wandering', 'spirit', 'drifting', 'own', 'inner', 'hell', 'opinion', 'conclusion', 'could', 'be', 'understood', 'purely', 'psychological', 'hate', 'world', 'world', 'will', 'hate', 'hate', 'will', 'be', 'understood', 'answered', 'same', 'way', 'not.Philosophical', 'way', 'movie', 'infinitly', 'uncompromising', 'Imagine', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'remove', 'Assasin', 'squad', 'replace', 'sorts', 'historical', 'enemies', 'ranging', 'samurai', 'spirits', 'demon', 'killers', 'demons', 'Yakuzas', 'SWAT', 'teams', 'school', 'kids', 'female', 'teachers', 'infernal', 'whores', 'wedding', 'banquet', 'own', 'mother', 'list', 'more', 'blood', 'guts', 'here', 'Ichi', 'killer', 'lot', 'more', 'actually', 'gods', 'are', 'dressed', 'business', 'men', 'commanding', 'historical', 'enemies', 'stop', 'Izo', 'crushing', 'them.Izo', 'hates', 'everything', 'so', 'everything', 'hate', 'Izo', 'nothing', ""'really"", 'exists', 'Izo', 'wandering', 'soul', 'soul', 'infinite', 'absurdity', 'movie', 'most', 'consequent', 'version', 'classic', ""'never"", 'ending', 'hell', 'tale', 'Long', 'Izo', 'begun', 'killing', 'everyone', 'standing', 'way', 'audience', 'realize', 'way', 'goal', 'only', 'neverending', 'slaughter', 'vengeance', 'everything', 'hell', 'repetition', 'end', 'violence', 'more', 'violence', 'Izo', 'somehow', 'capacity', 'violence', 'only', 'logic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'die', 'As', 'long', 'violence', 'way', 'guise', 'attackers', 'exist', 'Yeah', 'simple', 'formula', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'very', 'end', 'movie.There', 'hardly', 'minute', 'arterial', 'sprays', 'hardly', 'character', 'not', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'sooner', 'later', 'matter', 'who', 'buddha', 'lovers', 'demons', 'cops', 'kids', 'almost', 'funny', 'wedding', 'banquet', 'believe', 'are', 'certain', 'similiarties', 'Miike', 'Graveyard', 'honor', 'yakuza', 'going', 'battle', 'rest', 'world', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'understood', 'allegory', 'social', 'behaviour', 'historical', 'events.The', 'furthermore', 'sadistic', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Izo', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'suffering', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'victims', 'violence', 'where', 'violence', 'Sometimes', 'Izo', 'surrounded', 'dozen', 'enemies', 'fighting', 'one', 'toe-to-toe', 'others', 'keep', 'stabbing', 'knives', 'swords', 'stuff', 'Izo', 'bleeding', 'body', 'therefore', 'covered', 'blood', 'countless', 'injuries', 'whole', 'film', 'attack', 'painful', 'experience', 'Izo', 'being', 'responded', 'more', 'violence', 'Repeat', 'thousand', 'times', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'movie', 'screen', 'playing', 'GTA', 'everybody', 'attacking', '-cheat', 'Izo', 'execution', 'beginning', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'goriest', 'most', 'painful', 'film', 'history.If', 'truly', 'hate', 'somebody', 'need', 'release', 'mental', 'tension', 'movie', 'endless', 'pretty', 'mindless', 'killing', 'spree', 'dialogues', 'are', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'well', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'very', 'brutal', 'frankly', 'very', 'very', 'boring', 'Sure', 'sword', 'battle', 'skillfully', 'shot', 'Miike', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'else', 'sort', 'films', 'Nevertheless', 'first', 'time', 'remember', 'was', 'watching', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'spooling', 'speed', 'knew', '20', 'minutes', 'would', 'show', 'nothing', 'else', '100', 'minimum', 'sword', 'executions', 'was', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'ending', 'pretty', 'long', 'movie', 'even', 'longer', 'reagarding', 'repetive', 'nature', 'background', 'message', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'anyone', '4000', 'deaths', 'final', 'conclusion', 'end', 'thank', 'god', 'symbolic', 'when', 'Izo', 'standing', 'bizar', 'platform', 'part', ""'symbol"", 'neverending', 'infinity', 'realizing', 'deliverance', 'be', 'way', 'go', 'hate', 'vengeance', 'One', 'could', 'sense', 'political', 'statement', 'here', 'regarding', 'fact', 'AUDITITION', 'was', 'absolutly', 'social', 'commentary', 'intended', 'director', 'screen', 'writer', 'IZO', 'could', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'seen', 'just', 'killer', 'freak', 'show', 'pure', 'sick', 'entertainment']",N/A

Anyone who wants a ""safe"" film should just put the Miike box down and walk away.  Of course, weird does not always guarantee good.Okada Izo was an actual historical figure, a samurai from the late Edo period and one of the most feared assassins of his time.  He met a messy end, being tortured and crucified, thus ensuring his transformation into a legend.  Gosha Hideo chronicled Izo's life and death in the 1969 film ""Hitokiri.""  Miike Takashi took the challenge of filming Izo's afterlife, setting his film ""Izo"" as a direct sequel to the earlier Gosha movie.The story begins with Izo's death and the resurrection of his angry spirit, which is propelled backwards and forwards in time and space on a perpetual killing spree.  Izo himself does not really understand the motivations of his actions, being guided by some other force, and while he is able to feel pain he can never die again.  He only slaughters, becoming more and more demon-like in appearance (and super-hero-like, complete with mask and cape) and his killing continues.  His ultimate target is thought to be the group that controls humanity, the military, media, scholars and religious figures who conspire to keep people ignorant and controllable.  Towards the end though, Izo has completely forgotten what he is trying to accomplish, and just cuts down anyone in front of him.In order to create some buzz and interest in a somewhat esoteric project, the producers of ""Izo"" went with a ""dream team"" casting of pairing popular auteur Kitano ""Beat"" Takeshi (Fireworks) with the rogue director Miike Takashi (Audition).  This duo alone had massive drawing power, although they decided to hedge their bets by sticking in other stars like Momoi Kaori (Love and Honor), Matsuda Ryuhei (Cutie Honey - The Movie (Live Action)) and even popular K-1 fighter Bob Sapp.With this in mind, ""Izo"" is packed with great bits.  Surprisingly, Kitano Takeshi gets very little screen time.  From the advertising, I would have thought he was a main character, but his is only a minor role.  The Bob Sapp battle was very cool, and there are several outstanding sequences. One really great piece of ""Izo"" was the interstitial sequences of the ""screaming philosopher"" and acid-folk guitaristTomokawa Kazuki.  His particular voice and style of music added a perfect grounding point to the chaos of the film.Ultimately, however, ""Izo"" just didn't really work for me.  I could see what Miike was trying to accomplish (Izo as a metaphor for humanities capacity for violence.  The thought-controlling group that dictates what people think.  How ""righteous vengeance"" can deteriorate into cruel killing for killing's sake...) but it was all just too muddled together.  There were many, many great scenes, but on the whole the film was dragging and repetitive.  Izo's grand killing spree eventually just becomes...boring.
