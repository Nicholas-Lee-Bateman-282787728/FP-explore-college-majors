Keith Wyatt is a clear and restrained teacher. His ego is completely absent.

He speaks to the point and he doesn't confuse the issue with unneeded commentary. The camera stays close so you can always see his fingers. The play along sections (simple chord progressions) are well designed visually and they sound good too.This is an excellent video for the beginning guitarist.

I also bought the Fender ""Getting Started on Electric Guitar"" DVD. Do not bother buying both DVD courses; they are essentially the same. In fact, one half of the content is exactly the same.This course is excellent. Obviously a great deal of thought went into the production of this DVD at-home guitar course. If you just got your guitar and do not even know how to tune it, this DVD is a great place to start. In fact, it will probably be best for you to start with this DVD (for about three months) before you start taking guitar lessons from a live instructor. This course probably works best with teenagers and adults. Children will probably need help from a parent (it should not matter whether or not the parent plays guitar).This course will teach you how to tune your guitar and how to play basic open-string chords. With this knowledge, you will be able to play rhythm guitar for simple songs fairly quickly. Song chords may be found in numerous places online, as well as in guitar fake books sold here on Amazon. Being able to quickly have fun playing one's guitar helps motive one to continue learning how to play. The Fender course also teaches barre chords, notes on the sixth and fifth strings (to enable you to locate the root notes and placement of barre chords), three-string power chords (for easy rock 'n' roll), and the A minor pentatonic scale (so you can play simple leads).In short, the Fender course is an excellent resource for the new guitar player. It will not teach you how to read music, and it will not teach you any music theory, but it will teach you everything most new guitar players need to learn to play chord progressions. For example, with this course alone (and songs you get from the internet), you will be able to play rhythm guitar while you sing.""Learn and Master Guitar"" by Steve Krenz is (by far) a better and more comprehensive course. If you are serious about learning guitar (it is a 20 DVD course, so you better be serious), then try that course in addition to the Fender course. That course is equivalent to two years of guitar instruction (there is even a home-school version.). Another great DVD set for the new guitar player is the Rock House ""Learn Electric Guitar"" course. A good book on music theory is Hal Leonard's ""Music Theory for Guitarists"" (by Tom Kolb). If you wish to learn how to sight-read music, a good course is the Berklee ""A Modern Method for Guitar - Volume 1: Book/DVD-ROM Pack."" Most are available here on Amazon.",5,Excellent resource for the new guitar player,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2586,"['review', 'Fender', 'Presents', 'Getting', 'Started', 'Acoustic', 'Guitar', 'Guide', 'Beginners', 'also', 'bought', 'Fender', 'Getting', 'Started', 'Electric', 'Guitar', 'DVD', 'Do', 'not', 'bother', 'buying', 'DVD', 'courses', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'fact', 'one', 'half', 'content', 'exactly', 'same.This', 'course', 'excellent', 'Obviously', 'great', 'deal', 'thought', 'went', 'production', 'DVD', 'at-home', 'guitar', 'course', 'just', 'got', 'guitar', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'tune', 'DVD', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'fact', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'start', 'DVD', 'about', 'three', 'months', 'start', 'taking', 'guitar', 'lessons', 'live', 'instructor', 'course', 'probably', 'best', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'Children', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'help', 'parent', 'should', 'not', 'matter', 'not', 'parent', 'guitar', '.This', 'course', 'will', 'teach', 'how', 'tune', 'guitar', 'how', 'play', 'basic', 'open-string', 'chords', 'knowledge', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'simple', 'songs', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Song', 'chords', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'numerous', 'places', 'online', 'as', 'well', 'guitar', 'fake', 'books', 'sold', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Being', 'able', 'quickly', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'one', 'guitar', 'motive', 'one', 'continue', 'learning', 'how', 'play', 'Fender', 'course', 'also', 'barre', 'chords', 'notes', 'sixth', 'fifth', 'strings', 'enable', 'locate', 'root', 'notes', 'placement', 'barre', 'chords', 'three-string', 'power', 'chords', 'easy', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'A', 'minor', 'pentatonic', 'scale', 'can', 'play', 'simple', 'leads', '.In', 'short', 'Fender', 'course', 'excellent', 'resource', 'new', 'guitar', 'player', 'will', 'not', 'teach', 'how', 'read', 'music', 'will', 'not', 'teach', 'music', 'theory', 'will', 'teach', 'everything', 'most', 'new', 'guitar', 'players', 'need', 'learn', 'play', 'chord', 'progressions', 'example', 'course', 'alone', 'songs', 'get', 'internet', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'sing', 'Learn', 'Master', 'Guitar', 'Steve', 'Krenz', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'course', 'are', 'serious', 'learning', 'guitar', '20', 'DVD', 'course', 'better', 'be', 'serious', 'then', 'try', 'course', 'addition', 'Fender', 'course', 'course', 'equivalent', 'two', 'years', 'guitar', 'instruction', 'even', 'home-school', 'version.', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'new', 'guitar', 'player', 'Rock', 'House', 'Learn', 'Electric', 'Guitar', 'course', 'good', 'book', 'music', 'theory', 'Hal', 'Leonard', 'Music', 'Theory', 'Guitarists', 'Tom', 'Kolb', 'wish', 'learn', 'how', 'sight-read', 'music', 'good', 'course', 'Berklee', 'A', 'Modern', 'Method', 'Guitar', 'Volume', '1', 'Book/DVD-ROM', 'Pack', 'Most', 'are', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon']",N/A
694241,A2ELYF8POXKV1G,B0000639G8,Spinner's End,"[5, 5]","This DVD is fantastic!  It's worth the price just for the looped backing tracks for practice.  I like how I can practice major, minor, power or seventh chords over the backing tracks.  It makes practicing chord transitions fun---like actually playing something---instead of a grind.The teacher is first-rate.  Yes, as previously noted, he's playing an electric guitar.  IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE LESSON.  He injects just enough music theory quickly and concisely while showing the viewer where to put his/her fingers.  Though I already knew most of the chords, I learned some preferable finger positioning for faster transitions.  I've only done half of the lessons so far, but it has already been worth my money.Some background might be helpful in your decision to purchase this DVD: I'm a beginning player, and I've only had my guitar for a month.  I have a musical background, so I feel like I'm picking it up pretty quickly.  I know about 50 chords and can play quite a few songs . . . rhythm, for the most part!
