It is worth the effort of hunting it down.Most documentaries that I watch, you have a handful of experts stating their opinions with a little bit of hard evidence thrown in. With this documentary, you do have your experts giving their opinions but there is just as much solid evidence presented as there is commentary. I watched this once then watched it again immediately afterwards.In response to another review pulling the crazy-conspiracy-theorist card, all I have to say is fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

752714,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000096IAZ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Much like Waco: The Rules of Engagement, Waco: A New Revelation is yet another damning indictment of the government's actions and dark web of lies regarding the tragedy at Waco that resulted in the deaths of seventy-six people (including twenty children and two pregnant women) at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.  In fact, this documentary reveals even more troubling evidence and unanswered questions about the government's true role in that tragedy.  I do recommend watching Waco: The Rules of Engagement first, as it provides a wider perspective on the overall siege and carnage.  Waco: A New Revelation is perhaps the more important of the two documentaries, however; it is more focused on the circumstances regarding the deadly blaze and does indeed reveal new evidence contradicting the official government account.  It also reveals that some of the most crucial evidence in this entire case has mysteriously ""disappeared"" or been ""lost"" by the government.The making of this documentary uncovered significant new evidence, resulting in a new Congressional investigation of the Waco tragedy.  After finally being granted access to Waco evidence lockers in 1998, Michael McNulty and his team of investigators found a number of pyrotechnic flash-bang devices that had been recovered from each of the three locations from which the fire started; officially ""misidentified"" as silencers and other gun parts, these incendiary devices had been fired into the compound by government forces.  Thus, we now know the government lied in saying no pyrotechnic devices had been used during the April 19, 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound.  We also know the government lied when it said no shots were fired at the compound at any point during the assault.  The government's own aerial infrared surveillance reveals multiple bursts of automatic weapons fire directed at the compound during the tank siege.  In this documentary, you can see two agents roll out of one tank and begin firing as the tank enters the compound walls.  You will also see automatic gunfire coming from a helicopter at the same time as one individual was trying to make his way out of the compound - it fires several bursts and quickly departs.  Most disturbingly, you'll witness for yourself what experts say are some 50 or 60 shots fired in the direction of the cafeteria, which was the only exit available for most Branch Davidians attempting to escape the inferno.But wait - there's more, and it involves the ""bunker"" where most of the women and children were huddled after the fire broke out.  We know that government forces fired CS gas directly into this unventilated area, knowing the effects this would have on the children.  What remains unexplained, however, is the origins of a large hole in the top of that metal-reinforced vault.  The government explains it away as an effect of a propane tank explosion during the fire, but several military and civilian experts express their belief that this hole appears to be caused by an incendiary device placed atop the roof; there is some video evidence to believe that the explosion of this charge is what immediately set off the larger propane explosion and goes a long way to explaining why the bodies inside the bunker were literally blown apart.  An examination of that rooftop could give us definitive answers.  Government forces quickly demolished the building after the fire (thereby destroying most of any evidence that might have survived the fire), but investigators finally won the right to examine the buried remnants - all of the physical remains were there except the ones where that hole was.The significance of this documentary is made even more evident by the participation of some current and former FBI and CIA agents, military professionals, and even one forensic investigator there on the scene of the destroyed compound.  Some of them appear with their identities hidden, but all of them offer serious questions about the government's story; we also get confirmation from them that agents did fire automatic weapons at the compound on April 19 and that Delta forces were not only there on the scene, they were participants in the gunfire (which is a direct violation of the Posse Comitatus Act forbidding the use of military force against American citizens).  There is also physical evidence (in the form of expended shells) that at least four shots were fired that morning from one of the sniper's nests across from the compound (from a team led by the same man who murdered Randy Weaver's wife at Ruby Ridge) despite continuing denials.Any official recognition that ""mistakes were made"" in Waco does not begin to explain what happened to the Branch Davidians in March and April of 1993.  Most of the lingering questions could be put to rest if we could just study the evidence for ourselves.  Where is the video footage of events at the door of the compound during the initial ATF raid?  The government can't find a single copy of the footage from any of four cameras that recorded it.  Where is the front door itself?  The government lost it.  What about the unexplained hole in the top of the bunker?  Golly gee, that physical evidence disappeared, too.  What about the situation reports of ATF agents after the raid or any number of files and logs that have simply vanished?  Why did Vince Foster write that the FBI had lied to him before he ""committed suicide?""  When you look at all this missing evidence in conjunction with the plethora of exposed lies the government has told us about Waco, we have no choice but to question everything we've been told about the entire affair.",5,An important and substantive followup to Waco: The Rules of Engagement,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,5653,"['Much', 'Waco', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'Waco', 'New', 'Revelation',
