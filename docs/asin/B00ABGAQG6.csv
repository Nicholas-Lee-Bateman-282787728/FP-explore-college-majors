1607670,ABIR54CL0P4HL,B00ABGAQG6,Coral Newton,"[0, 0]","This is the forth and final TV film following the progress of the special  police unit run by tough detective Cieran Hinds.  He has his usual staff working with him but is suspicious of them all, because someone has reported the mix up that was the result of episode three. Something he has tried to hide. So as he and his team work on the murder of a young actress, he is also trying to.find out who has betrayed him.  Because of the betrayal, he has lost the promotion he desperately wanted.The story is full of the usual plot twists and turns.  I do like Lynda La Plante`s TV work.  She is a master of the crime genre.  At the end of the film, there are interviews with actors and guest stars from the programme.  Most interesting.I got such a surprise at the very end of the film that I thought I might have mis-understood.  I re-played it and once again La Plante has managed to give us her trade mark shock.  Great TV and story telling.",5,Another Winner,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,942,"['forth', 'final', 'TV', 'film', 'following', 'progress', 'special', 'police', 'unit', 'run', 'tough', 'detective', 'Cieran', 'Hinds', 'usual', 'staff', 'working', 'suspicious', 'someone', 'reported', 'mix', 'up', 'was', 'result', 'episode', 'three', 'Something', 'tried', 'hide', 'So', 'team', 'work', 'murder', 'young', 'actress', 'also', 'trying', 'out', 'who', 'betrayed', 'betrayal', 'lost', 'promotion', 'desperately', 'wanted.The', 'story', 'full', 'usual', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'do', 'Lynda', 'La', 'Plante', 's', 'TV', 'work', 'master', 'crime', 'genre', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'interviews', 'actors', 'guest', 'stars', 'programme', 'Most', 'interesting.I', 'got', 'such', 'surprise', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'mis-understood', 're-played', 'once', 'again', 'La', 'Plante', 'managed', 'give', 'trade', 'mark', 'shock', 'Great', 'TV', 'story', 'telling']",Above Suspicion Series Four - Silent Scream

1607673,AF1I73TZML34O,B00ABGAQG6,Traveling1,"[1, 2]",The crimes are as grisly as they come and the police work is as seemingly frustrating as in the US. The characters come off as amazingly real; they're complicated and guarded and at the same time forthright and honest. This is a series that requires intelligent attention. A lot of back story is revealed via subtle conversational reference which explains much of the character interaction. I love it and find myself re-watching the series often.,5,great Irish program,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,446,"['crimes', 'are', 'as', 'grisly', 'come', 'police', 'work', 'seemingly', 'frustrating', 'US', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'amazingly', 'real', ""'re"", 'complicated', 'guarded', 'same', 'time', 'forthright', 'honest', 'series', 'intelligent', 'attention', 'lot', 'back', 'story', 'revealed', 'subtle', 'conversational', 'reference', 'much', 'character', 'interaction', 'love', 'find', 're-watching', 'series', 'often']",Above Suspicion Series Four - Silent Scream
