Found Footage films have been around for quite some time (Cannibal Holocaust in 1980 is credited as the first to use this format) and they do provide an effective way of adding an element of additional realism to a film. If you have a problem with this type of film don't watch it. Sounds simple enough, but quite a few people fail to grasp that.Zombie Diaries 2 picks up sometime after the events of the first film. We are seeing what occurs through the video camera of one of the members of the military unit seen at the end of the first film. It's interesting watching how the military response is to the outbreak and the total collapse of all order. The unit is quickly overrun by the zombies and the survivors flee. This film does an effective job of creating and maintaining a sense of impending dread. Once the unit encounters a gang of predators (who were also seen for a brief moment in the first film) the horror of the overall situation becomes even clearer. If something like a zombie outbreak was to occur the worst elemenets of society would prosper. The biker gang from the original Dawn of the Dead is the best example of this type of behavior, but where they were organized this group isn't. People have complained about the two rape sequences but, these really are implied more then shown and, are used to show exactly how hideous the actions of the gang are. This film is ment for mature viewers and deals with adult subject matter. Have a problem dealing with that don't watch.",3,Zombie Madness,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,1668,"['People', 'have', 'complained', 'Found', 'Footage', 'format', 'used', 'film', 'want', 'send', 'moment', 'point', 'out', 'why', 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Found', 'Footage', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'time', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', '1980', 'credited', 'first', 'use', 'format', 'do', 'provide', 'effective', 'way', 'adding', 'element', 'additional', 'realism', 'film', 'have', 'problem', 'type', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'simple', 'enough', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'fail', 'grasp', 'that.Zombie', 'Diaries', '2', 'picks', 'sometime', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'seeing', 'what', 'video', 'camera', 'one', 'members', 'military', 'unit', 'seen', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'interesting', 'watching', 'how', 'military', 'response', 'outbreak', 'total', 'collapse', 'order', 'unit', 'quickly', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'survivors', 'flee', 'film', 'effective', 'job', 'creating', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'impending', 'dread', 'unit', 'gang', 'predators', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'seen', 'brief', 'moment', 'first', 'film', 'horror', 'overall', 'situation', 'even', 'clearer', 'something', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'was', 'occur', 'worst', 'elemenets', 'society', 'would', 'prosper', 'biker', 'gang', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'best', 'example', 'type', 'behavior', 'where', 'were', 'organized', 'group', ""n't"", 'People', 'have', 'complained', 'two', 'rape', 'sequences', 'really', 'are', 'implied', 'more', 'then', 'shown', 'are', 'used', 'show', 'exactly', 'how', 'hideous', 'actions', 'gang', 'are', 'film', 'ment', 'mature', 'viewers', 'deals', 'adult', 'subject', 'matter', 'Have', 'problem', 'dealing', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch']",Zombie Diaries 2

They have heard that there is a ship at sea that is taking the remaining survivors to safety. The group is lead by Maddox (played by Philip Brodie) whom has just taken in a few more survivors at the beachside compound, which includes the sole survivor of the first movie's film crew, Leanne, (played by Alix Wilton Regan who is replacing Victoria Summer). Before long the zombies invade the compound causing Maddox, Leanne, Jonesy, who is constantly filming with his camera, and a few others to runaway.With no vehicles, they run on foot looking for any place for shelter. Eventually they come across some booby-traps and the remains of headless zombies in a wooded area. The carefully survey a cabin from a distance where a group of human bandits are watching another man sexually assault a female zombie. The deadly Goke (played by Russell Jones) comes out of the cabin and murders the man. That is when Leanne recognizes Goke and his henchman Manny as she had encountered them in the first movie.Instead of using their weapons, Maddox and the group battle the undead by hand-to-hand combat, so the bandits won't know their location, but it is too late as Goke learns that Leanne is alive and he has a special fate for her.I never even knew there was a movie called Zombie Diaries or that it had a sequel! I just happened to stumble across it at my local Walmart last week for only five dollars, so I thought I would give it a try as it had cool DVD cover. Well, let's just say that covers can sometimes be misleading, likeHellraiser: Revelations. Zombies Diaries 2, or also known as World of the Dead: Zombie Diaries, is a low-budget British horror film about a group of survivors trying to reach the shore to get to a ship that will rescue them. Has anybody seenResident Evil: Afterlife? It has similar plot, except for the fact that Zombie Diaries 2 doesn't use CGI special effects and it contains more graphic situations, including a rape scene, which I could have done without. Considering its budget, the movie was nicely filmed, but I got annoyed with all the shaky camera shots. It basically follows the same zombie rules set by George A. Romero in theNight of the Living Dead. Overall, Zombie Diaries 2 is better than your typical low-budget zombie flick, but it doesn't offer anything new, especially with the predictable ending.",3,World of the Dead,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,2484,"['Three', 'months', 'worldwide', 'zombie', 'wiped', '99.9', '%', 'population', 'small', 'group', 'British', 'survivors', 'are', 'trying', 'survive', 'have', 'heard', 'ship', 'sea', 'taking', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'safety', 'group', 'lead', 'Maddox', 'played', 'Philip', 'Brodie', 'whom', 'just', 'taken', 'few', 'more', 'survivors', 'beachside', 'compound', 'sole', 'survivor', 'first', 'movie', 'film', 'crew', 'Leanne', 'played', 'Alix', 'Wilton', 'Regan', 'who', 'replacing', 'Victoria', 'Summer', 'long', 'zombies', 'invade', 'compound', 'causing', 'Maddox', 'Leanne', 'Jonesy', 'who', 'constantly', 'filming', 'camera', 'few', 'others', 'runaway.With', 'vehicles', 'run', 'foot', 'looking', 'place', 'shelter', 'Eventually', 'come', 'booby-traps', 'remains', 'headless', 'zombies', 'wooded', 'area', 'carefully', 'survey', 'cabin', 'distance', 'where', 'group', 'human', 'bandits', 'are', 'watching', 'man', 'sexually', 'female', 'zombie', 'deadly', 'Goke', 'played', 'Russell', 'Jones', 'cabin', 'murders', 'man', 'when', 'Leanne', 'Goke', 'henchman', 'Manny', 'had', 'encountered', 'first', 'movie.Instead', 'using', 'weapons', 'Maddox', 'group', 'battle', 'undead', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'bandits', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'location', 'too', 'late', 'Goke', 'Leanne', 'alive', 'special', 'fate', 'her.I', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'movie', 'called', 'Zombie', 'Diaries', 'had', 'sequel', 'just', 'happened', 'stumble', 'local', 'Walmart', 'last', 'week', 'only', 'five', 'dollars', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'had', 'cool', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'covers', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'misleading', 'likeHellraiser', 'Revelations', 'Zombies', '2', 'also', 'known', 'World', 'Dead', 'Zombie', 'Diaries', 'low-budget', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'group', 'survivors', 'trying', 'reach', 'shore', 'get', 'ship', 'will', 'rescue', 'Has', 'anybody', 'seenResident', 'Evil', 'Afterlife', 'similar', 'plot', 'fact', 'Zombie', '2', ""n't"", 'use', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'graphic', 'situations', 'including', 'rape', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Considering', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'got', 'annoyed', 'shaky', 'camera', 'shots', 'basically', 'same', 'zombie', 'rules', 'set', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'theNight', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Overall', 'Zombie', 'Diaries', '2', 'better', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'zombie', 'flick', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'especially', 'predictable', 'ending']",Zombie Diaries 2

1444164,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B0056OZHYE,Howard M. Kindel,"[3, 5]","No, not the movie - the reviews.  The same hackneyed laundry list of criticisms  seems to follow every zombie movie made outside of a big studio - especially if it lacks the kind of puerile grossness zombie ""fans"" seem to find so engaging.  Bad acting (check); bad dialogue (check); bad direction (check); bad makeup (check).  The setting for Zombie Diaries 2 did get a Hail Mary Pass, though, so that can remain unchecked.  I thought - foolishly of course - that since the acting really was quite good, it would be left off the list this time around.  But no; bad acting is de rigueur, belonging in fact at the very top of the list, so it cannot be omitted from any conventional criticism.There is, unfortunately, another laundry list - the list of absolutely mandatory mishaps in a zombie movie - and they're present and accounted for in this movie too.  The perimeter protecting the survivors from the zombies gets breached (check).  The getaway vehicle becomes disabled (check).  One of the survivors has to go relieve him or herself and is warned not to stray far but does anyway (check).  The survivors blindly wander through a big, dimly lit building filled with corridors in search of some unspecified something or another (check).  The survivors get trapped in a dead end, be it a corridor or the landscape itself (check).To this list, the producer(s)/director of Zombie Diaries 2 added a couple unique elements.  The primary female character - Leann - was locked in a separate room within the ""safe"" compound; it's never revealed how or why she got there, but once she's given a military uniform and a gun she comes around - becoming, in fact, one of the best killing machines in the entire squad.  One member of the squad goes off to scout and learns the hard way that scouting is not his forte.  There are scenes of a group of heavily uniformed people rounding up and killing what appear to be non-zombies; but no indication if this routine is past, present or future.Finally, a good bit of criticism has been leveled at the handy-cam mode, much in vogue of late.  Reviewers find it distracting and difficult to follow.  Perhaps it has been overdone, but I think it's more than merely a gimmick.  Its roots can be traced to literature, where for decades writers have been attempting to find a way around the ""omniscient narrator""; the best they've managed to come up with is first-person narration.  In film, the parallel would be the omnipresent camera, which sees everything everywhere all the time.  By using the hand-held camera as a tool of recording what's happening, the entire movie is seen literally through one character's eyes: the audience sees what he sees, no more, no less.  Ultimately, though, as with the omniscient narrator in a novel, there simply is no adequate replacement for the omnipresent camera.",5,Soooooo Tedious,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,2833,"['not', 'movie', 'reviews', 'same', 'hackneyed', 'laundry', 'list', 'criticisms', 'follow', 'zombie', 'movie', 'made', 'big', 'studio', 'especially', 'kind', 'puerile', 'grossness', 'zombie', 'fans', 'seem', 'find', 'so', 'engaging', 'Bad', 'acting', 'check', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'check', 'bad', 'direction', 'check', 'bad', 'makeup', 'check', 'setting', 'Zombie', 'Diaries', '2', 'did', 'get', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'Pass', 'though', 'can', 'remain', 'unchecked', 'thought', 'foolishly', 'course', 'acting', 'really', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'off', 'list', 'time', 'around', 'bad', 'acting', 'de', 'rigueur', 'belonging', 'fact', 'very', 'top', 'list', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'omitted', 'conventional', 'criticism.There', 'unfortunately', 'laundry', 'list', 'list', 'absolutely', 'mandatory', 'mishaps', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'re"", 'present', 'accounted', 'movie', 'too', 'perimeter', 'protecting', 'survivors', 'zombies', 'breached', 'check', 'getaway', 'vehicle', 'disabled', 'check', 'One', 'survivors', 'go', 'relieve', 'warned', 'not', 'stray', 'far', 'anyway', 'check', 'survivors', 'blindly', 'wander', 'big', 'dimly', 'lit', 'building', 'filled', 'corridors', 'search', 'unspecified', 'something', 'check', 'survivors', 'get', 'trapped', 'dead', 'end', 'be', 'corridor', 'landscape', 'check', '.To', 'list', 'producer', '/director', 'Zombie', 'Diaries', '2', 'added', 'couple', 'unique', 'elements', 'primary', 'female', 'character', 'Leann', 'was', 'locked', 'separate', 'room', 'safe', 'compound', 'never', 'revealed', 'how', 'why', 'got', 'there', 'once', 'given', 'military', 'uniform', 'gun', 'around', 'becoming', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'killing', 'machines', 'entire', 'squad', 'One', 'member', 'squad', 'scout', 'hard', 'way', 'scouting', 'not', 'forte', 'are', 'scenes', 'group', 'heavily', 'uniformed', 'people', 'rounding', 'up', 'killing', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'non-zombies', 'indication', 'routine', 'past', 'present', 'future.Finally', 'good', 'bit', 'criticism', 'been', 'leveled', 'handy-cam', 'mode', 'much', 'vogue', 'late', 'Reviewers', 'find', 'distracting', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Perhaps', 'been', 'overdone', 'think', 'more', 'merely', 'gimmick', 'roots', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'literature', 'where', 'decades', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'attempting', 'find', 'way', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'best', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'come', 'up', 'first-person', 'narration', 'film', 'parallel', 'would', 'be', 'omnipresent', 'camera', 'everything', 'everywhere', 'time', 'using', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'tool', 'recording', 'what', 'happening', 'entire', 'movie', 'seen', 'literally', 'one', 'character', 'eyes', 'audience', 'what', 'more', 'less', 'Ultimately', 'though', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'novel', 'simply', 'adequate', 'replacement', 'omnipresent', 'camera']",Zombie Diaries 2

In fact after that movie we got tons of hand  held camera movies. Of course 'blair witch' started the whole thing but it went away until 'zombie diaries 1"". This sequel has alot more money than the first and it's still a very small budget in alot of ways. The whole hand hald camera thing should hopefully fade away in the future.  Unless you are really recording a event. The problem here is that recording hordes of zombies attacking you instead of fighting back is rather a bad idea. It barely worked in the first one and in 'survival of the dead' the cameraman is not a military man. The picture looks great on blu ray of course. And it's in widescreen which is a good thing. You can pick apart any zombie film though and find lots of characters doing really dumb things. The characters here at least make sense most of the time. ALthough a overrun barracks of soldiers with bloodless victims lying around is strange. That's how low budget this is. Sorta like chiller channels 'the remains' a zombie flick I saw last night. I recently saw the classic low budgeter 'children shouldn't play with dead things' from the early 70's and I got a kick out of it.  But to be fair non horror critics would trash 90% of all horror movies anyways. This has it's moments , for instance in spite of it's very, very low budget, they did a good job training the actors in military procedures, and they even used a decomissioned airbase in part of the story.  I love these shlocky movies and too often I give them three stars , but I just couldn't do it here because of the whole hand held cameraman thing. which to be fair this series really brought back into popularity!

Yet another shakycam attempt at a zombie movie that is utterly devoid of thrills or chills.We get three somewhat related episodes that focus on the survivors of a military base that's overrun in the first episode (this particular piece of stupidity has been savaged, quite rightly, by any number of users on the IMDB for the mechanism that allows this to happen). The second has our pals--photographer Jones (The Devil's Hand's Rob Oldfield), Maddox (Dawn of the Dragonslayer's Philip Brodie), Kayne (World War Z's Vicky Araico), Jez (Toby Bowman, whose career to date has been the Zombie Diaries franchise, and looking him up at IMDB unfortunately clued me in to the first movie's existence), and Leeann (Elemental Storage's Alix Wilton Regan)--facing off against a band of marauders who are only slightly less stupid than the biker gang in Dawn of the Dead, while the third has them trying to stay alive whilst waiting for boats they found out were on their way to England from an intercepted radio transmission. Nothing new, from the camera angles to the ""twist"" ending you likely saw coming a mile away. Some decent acting from a few of the principals is about the only thing the movie has going for it.

This movie takes place in England.Their plan is to travel through the forest to minimize zombie contact, head for the town of Hope, on the east coast and team up with another group of supposed survivors. From there, head to Holland where there exists a large colony of uninfected people. The military is disliked by the civilians because of their role in the outbreak cleansing.

But then again...we all are, aren't we?***How do they make the trailers look like they are regular movies, but it turns out to be yet another camera on the run movie, is beyond me. Or maybe it was my ADHD & I didn't pay as close attn to the trailer as I thought. Regardless, I was very disappointed, altho I was glad I rented it before buying it, which saved me some denarii. Albeit I have certainly wasted my fair share. It was all to easy to know what was going to happen. And I guess I am just too old for that caffeinated camera action. My 1st intro to the zombie world was at the Big Sky outdoor theater in Madison, WI, when Night of the Living Dead 1st came out int he 60's. I was in the middle seat behind my parents in our blue/while 1965 VW van. They fell asleep. But my mom woke up just as the girl was planting a garden in her mom's chest. My mom screamed for dad to wake up & leave ""This is a terrible movie. We're not watching it!"", or words to that effect.  It would be another 20+ yrs before I finally got to see that fateful ending. Of course, I was upset b/c the main movie I wanted to see was the last of the triple-header...""Day of the Triffids"". I now own that movie...but would you believe it, I still haven't sat down to watch it!All this to say that since I saw the ending of the ""Night..."", I never stopped watching zombie movies. I've seen good, I've seen bad, & I've seen them in-between. Unfortunately this was disappointing. Not that the George Romero movies have uncanny plots. But there is an art to making the already-known/guessable seem at least somewhat surprising. I don't want to take away from those who enjoyed it. I know there are a great many movies many find ""dumb"" quite pleasant. Therefore this rating is purely subjectable. There are of course some movies that are simply outstanding, & some that are simply too awful to even involve God in (uh, as in God-awful, for the unlearned young). I say this b/c there are those who can like the Parkinsonian-camera action (pls, anyone suffering from or know someone suffering from this debilitating, awful disease, do not take offense...it is merely referring to the action...I am fully aware in this PC-riddled, thought-police filled society that somewhere someone is going to take offense b/c they either 1) don't have a sense of humor, 2) don't have common sense, 3) don't have any sense, 4) never had mama's milk, & of course 5) all the above & below. Or maybe they just never had a life & therefore in order to make up one they have decided to make the majority suffer for their lack of humanity. And yet they call themselves liberals...but alas I digest...I mean digress...I mean, i don;t know what I mean...i want to go home, Inspector!The short of it is, this movie if only for those who like the Blair Witch camera action. If you don't like  that, save yourself the headache. If you do, & don't knowing what's going to happen (well, at least it was easy for me to figure it out), then by all means...have at it. My low rating is simply my take on it.And as always, we thank you for your support. Say goodnight Dick.
