Michelle obviously put a lot of thought into this both from the perspective of an instructor and of her students.The instruction overall had some aspects that I find very helpful.  Michelle does a great job of explaining exactly which muscles are involved in the movements.  That helped give me a better understanding of why I was having problems with a certain movement I've always struggled with. She was also good about pointing out pitfalls to watch out for.  Much of the dvd was filmed with her back to the camera in front of a mirror, too, so you don't have to mentally translate when she mentions left and right.Before she even gets to the movement drills, Michelle takes you through a bunch of well thought out strengthening exercises. Despite having taken classes and many workshops over the past several years, a lot of the strengthening exercises were new to me.  I especially liked the body roll one which should help a lot with the control of my undulations. The drills themselves progress from slow to fast and basic to layered, to layered with zils, followed by a choreography using the drills.  Again, I thought it was great that Michelle pointed out that you can train your mind to learn choreography more easily.  So, part of the dvd is a drill for your brain, as well.I can easily see it being one of those dvds that I come back to time and time again.  I will definitely be recommending it to everyone in my troupe.",5,Excellent!,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,1542,"['one', 'thought', 'kept', 'popping', 'mind', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'Wow', 'really', 'intelligent', 'Michelle', 'obviously', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'perspective', 'instructor', 'students.The', 'instruction', 'overall', 'had', 'aspects', 'find', 'very', 'helpful', 'Michelle', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'exactly', 'muscles', 'are', 'involved', 'movements', 'helped', 'give', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'was', 'having', 'problems', 'certain', 'movement', ""'ve"", 'always', 'struggled', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'pointing', 'out', 'pitfalls', 'watch', 'out', 'Much', 'dvd', 'was', 'filmed', 'back', 'camera', 'front', 'mirror', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'mentally', 'translate', 'when', 'left', 'right.Before', 'even', 'movement', 'drills', 'Michelle', 'bunch', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'having', 'taken', 'classes', 'many', 'workshops', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'lot', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'were', 'new', 'especially', 'liked', 'body', 'roll', 'one', 'should', 'help', 'lot', 'control', 'undulations', 'drills', 'progress', 'slow', 'fast', 'basic', 'layered', 'layered', 'zils', 'followed', 'choreography', 'using', 'drills', 'Again', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Michelle', 'pointed', 'out', 'can', 'train', 'mind', 'learn', 'choreography', 'more', 'easily', 'So', 'part', 'dvd', 'drill', 'brain', 'well.I', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'being', 'one', 'dvds', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'recommending', 'everyone', 'troupe']",Drills!

1145200,A1ZYA1450LWBXF,B00144Y8XG,Amazon Customer,"[68, 68]","Nobody else is as turned on by the dull word ""drill"" as belly dancers are. And turned on we are, because drills happen to be the key to making second nature of body isolations and moves. If you've ever watched a belly dancer's apparently effortless control over her movements, know that this has come from hours of determined and very careful practice. It's the drills that make moves natural enough to layer one on top of the other until you have an overall incredible result that mimics the music even as it happens.Michelle Joyce, a total godsend to the belly dance community, brings the thrill of the drill to belly dancers in a complete package on this video. If you were to look around at discussions on the internet, you'll find not just praise, but absolute gratitude from dancers. You will readily find those who are willing to give this video at least a 10 on 5. Somehow, Michelle has hit the right note with dancers and is speaking to them in a language they're comfortable with. She's covering all the essentials, organizing her material very neatly, and giving excellent advice, reminders and encouragement throughout the instruction.There's enough content on this video to keep dancers, of any level, as the title says, busy for a long time. If you're a beginner, work with some other videos (or better still, classes) for technique, and drill with this video. But my advice would be to be hugely careful about posture because this is hard work and be tough on an unconditioned back or knees. Once a certain amount of optimum strength has been developed, go go go.Before each segment, Michelle has an explanation section. That arrangement helps the instruction reach out to beginners more readily. It also refreshes the basics for already-dancers. She begins with four exercise drills to strengthen some of the essential muscle groups and your ""core"". For those of you used to tribal drills or Suhaila-style exercises, it should be familiar enough.The instruction then moves on to isolations. There's technique explanations and tips before moving on to drills that have a separate slow and fast section. What I really like about these is how Michelle has added four foot positions and arm positions to do these drills with. I do a lot of drills but I haven't come across any that call for changes in arm positions. I immediately found myself faltering on that aspect. There's a beautifully simple symbols explanation and drill next, also with arm movements.Then come two of my favorite drills on this video, the Zig Zag drill for both hips and ribcage, and isolations all layered on a grapevine traveling steps. This addition is excellent - and challenging. And if that weren't enough, we layer cymbal playing on to that lot. There are also  shimmy drills (up and down) and standing shimmy drills. What's missing is shimmies layered on other hip isolations like circles etc. But there are rib cage moves layered on hip moves. These latter sections of the video increase in difficulty level, specially when they include cymbals. But this is exactly what will overcome everyone's problems with wiring the brain to do 3 or 4 things at the same time.To end with, there's a ""choreography"" which isn't really a complete dance as the word may imply, but 3 short (and challenging) routines based on the isolations learnt on the video. You can, of course, add these into your own dancing, but here they're meant to be a different type of practice of drills. It These are really nice and are meant to help make you choreography-friendly. This again is really unique and well-planned. Dancers are already saying that this video is also a lesson in how to practice.Drills Drills Drills ties in very well with another product that actually make earlier, Pop Lock and Shimmy. On that video, these drills are taken to the next level and also go on to make up a choreography. Overall, these two videos take into account everything that dancers have been wanting for their practice.",5,Quite simply: thrilled with Drills,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,3979,"['Nobody', 'else', 'as', 'turned', 'dull', 'word', 'drill', 'belly', 'dancers', 'are', 'turned', 'are', 'drills', 'happen', 'be', 'key', 'making', 'second', 'nature', 'body', 'isolations', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'belly', 'dancer', 'apparently', 'effortless', 'control', 'movements', 'know', 'come', 'hours', 'determined', 'very', 'careful', 'practice', 'drills', 'make', 'moves', 'natural', 'enough', 'layer', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'have', 'overall', 'incredible', 'result', 'music', 'even', 'Joyce', 'total', 'godsend', 'belly', 'dance', 'community', 'thrill', 'drill', 'belly', 'dancers', 'complete', 'package', 'video', 'were', 'look', 'around', 'discussions', 'internet', ""'ll"", 'find', 'not', 'just', 'praise', 'absolute', 'gratitude', 'dancers', 'will', 'readily', 'find', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'video', 'least', '10', '5', 'Somehow', 'Michelle', 'hit', 'right', 'note', 'dancers', 'speaking', 'language', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'covering', 'essentials', 'organizing', 'material', 'very', 'neatly', 'giving', 'excellent', 'advice', 'reminders', 'encouragement', 'instruction.There', 'enough', 'content', 'video', 'keep', 'dancers', 'level', 'title', 'busy', 'long', 'time', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'work', 'other', 'videos', 'better', 'still', 'classes', 'technique', 'drill', 'video', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'hugely', 'careful', 'posture', 'hard', 'work', 'be', 'tough', 'unconditioned', 'back', 'knees', 'Once', 'certain', 'amount', 'optimum', 'strength', 'been', 'developed', 'go', 'go', 'go.Before', 'segment', 'Michelle', 'explanation', 'section', 'arrangement', 'instruction', 'out', 'beginners', 'more', 'readily', 'also', 'basics', 'already-dancers', 'four', 'exercise', 'drills', 'strengthen', 'essential', 'muscle', 'groups', 'core', 'used', 'tribal', 'drills', 'Suhaila-style', 'exercises', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'enough.The', 'instruction', 'then', 'isolations', 'technique', 'explanations', 'tips', 'moving', 'drills', 'have', 'separate', 'slow', 'fast', 'section', 'What', 'really', 'like', 'how', 'Michelle', 'added', 'four', 'foot', 'positions', 'arm', 'positions', 'do', 'drills', 'do', 'lot', 'drills', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'call', 'changes', 'arm', 'positions', 'immediately', 'found', 'faltering', 'aspect', 'beautifully', 'simple', 'symbols', 'explanation', 'drill', 'next', 'also', 'arm', 'movements.Then', 'come', 'two', 'favorite', 'drills', 'video', 'Zig', 'Zag', 'drill', 'hips', 'ribcage', 'isolations', 'layered', 'grapevine', 'traveling', 'steps', 'addition', 'excellent', 'challenging', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'layer', 'cymbal', 'playing', 'lot', 'are', 'also', 'shimmy', 'drills', 'standing', 'shimmy', 'drills', 'What', 'missing', 'shimmies', 'layered', 'other', 'hip', 'isolations', 'circles', 'etc', 'are', 'rib', 'cage', 'moves', 'layered', 'hip', 'moves', 'latter', 'sections', 'video', 'increase', 'difficulty', 'level', 'specially', 'when', 'include', 'cymbals', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'overcome', 'everyone', 'problems', 'wiring', 'brain', 'do', '3', '4', 'things', 'same', 'time.To', 'end', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'really', 'complete', 'dance', 'word', 'may', 'imply', '3', 'short', 'challenging', 'routines', 'based', 'isolations', 'learnt', 'video', 'can', 'course', 'add', 'own', 'dancing', 'here', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'different', 'type', 'practice', 'drills', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'are', 'meant', 'help', 'make', 'choreography-friendly', 'again', 'really', 'unique', 'well-planned', 'Dancers', 'are', 'already', 'saying', 'video', 'also', 'lesson', 'how', 'practice.Drills', 'Drills', 'Drills', 'ties', 'very', 'well', 'product', 'actually', 'make', 'earlier', 'Pop', 'Lock', 'Shimmy', 'video', 'drills', 'are', 'taken', 'next', 'level', 'also', 'go', 'make', 'up', 'choreography', 'Overall', 'two', 'videos', 'take', 'account', 'everything', 'dancers', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'practice']",Drills!

1145202,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B00144Y8XG,atisheh,"[8, 8]","First things first. This is not a DVD for people who have not learned the basic posture, movements and isolations of bellydance. If this describes you, go directly to a beginner's video, do not pass GO, do not collect $200.The drills Michelle offers here are, for the most part, not strenuous, but you do need to have ingrained at least some basic bellydance movements to the point where you can do them without thinking: shimmies and hip bumps should be second nature.The second key point is that the movements are, in general, geared towards helping you define your isolations, layer movements, and even use different parts of your body at different rhythms. Michelle points out several times that you may not like the moves you're drilling, and you may not want to use them in a choreography, but that they're helping you build dance skills.That said, if you *do* have bellydance experience, and you're looking for a video which will help you train for bellydance (or get some light exercise) in a ""dancey"" way, this is it. The video begins with a few strengthening exercises for the quads and abs, and then moves on to a seemingly endless series of varied drills. There are drills which will have you practicing your isolations with different foot and arm positions, drills done while dancing a grapevine, drills where you do a zig zag shape with your hips, pelvis and chest.I loved the variety. The drills are well-thought out and clearly organized, but they don't follow the same pattern. This required me to use both my body and my mind in different ways, and kept the movements from being dull. I loved the fact that Michelle puts in little reminders about proper form as you're doing it. There isn't a lot of arm work, but there's definitely greater use of the lower abdominals than I've seen in other videos.If you're like me, you will find that some things come easily to you, some take a while to click, and some things seem impossibly hard at the first go. This is absolutely a DVD to grow into. At nearly two hours of running time, there's a wealth of material, and you can always do only one part of a layering drill if you're not at Michelle's level yet. After the section on finger cymbals, the drills are also done with zill accompaniment -- this was impossible for me, but it was a great chance to repeat the drill I had just done.Most importantly, the program was fun, despite its slightly military name! The section on 3/4 shimmies is a lot looser than the early drill sections, and I found myself improvising to the beat. In other words, the drills started to become dance. My advice to dancers using this program is add your own warm-up and cool-down, but also to put on a song or two of music you really like after you're done drilling and just let go. You may just find your body reacting to the music much more readily than before, and with a greater variety of movements.",5,A great DVD.... but not for beginners,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2898,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'not', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'learned', 'basic', 'posture', 'movements', 'isolations', 'bellydance', 'go', 'directly', 'beginner', 'video', 'do', 'not', 'pass', 'GO', 'do', 'not', 'collect', '200.The', 'drills', 'Michelle', 'offers', 'here', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'strenuous', 'do', 'need', 'have', 'ingrained', 'least', 'basic', 'bellydance', 'movements', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'thinking', 'shimmies', 'hip', 'bumps', 'should', 'be', 'second', 'nature.The', 'second', 'key', 'point', 'movements', 'are', 'general', 'geared', 'towards', 'helping', 'define', 'isolations', 'layer', 'movements', 'even', 'use', 'different', 'parts', 'body', 'different', 'rhythms', 'Michelle', 'out', 'several', 'times', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'moves', ""'re"", 'drilling', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'use', 'choreography', ""'re"", 'helping', 'build', 'dance', 'skills.That', 'said', '*do*', 'have', 'bellydance', 'experience', ""'re"", 'looking', 'video', 'will', 'help', 'train', 'bellydance', 'get', 'light', 'exercise', 'dancey', 'way', 'video', 'few', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'quads', 'abs', 'then', 'moves', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'series', 'varied', 'drills', 'are', 'drills', 'will', 'have', 'practicing', 'isolations', 'different', 'foot', 'arm', 'positions', 'drills', 'done', 'dancing', 'grapevine', 'where', 'do', 'zig', 'zag', 'shape', 'hips', 'pelvis', 'chest.I', 'loved', 'variety', 'drills', 'are', 'well-thought', 'clearly', 'organized', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'same', 'pattern', 'required', 'use', 'body', 'mind', 'different', 'ways', 'kept', 'movements', 'being', 'dull', 'loved', 'fact', 'Michelle', 'little', 'reminders', 'proper', 'form', ""'re"", 'doing', ""n't"", 'lot', 'arm', 'work', 'definitely', 'greater', 'use', 'lower', 'abdominals', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'videos.If', ""'re"", 'will', 'find', 'things', 'come', 'easily', 'take', 'while', 'click', 'things', 'seem', 'impossibly', 'hard', 'first', 'go', 'absolutely', 'DVD', 'grow', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'wealth', 'material', 'can', 'always', 'do', 'only', 'one', 'part', 'layering', 'drill', ""'re"", 'not', 'Michelle', 'level', 'yet', 'section', 'finger', 'cymbals', 'drills', 'are', 'also', 'done', 'zill', 'accompaniment', 'was', 'impossible', 'was', 'great', 'chance', 'repeat', 'drill', 'had', 'just', 'done.Most', 'importantly', 'program', 'was', 'fun', 'slightly', 'military', 'name', 'section', '3/4', 'shimmies', 'lot', 'looser', 'early', 'drill', 'sections', 'found', 'improvising', 'beat', 'other', 'words', 'drills', 'started', 'become', 'dance', 'advice', 'dancers', 'using', 'program', 'add', 'own', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'also', 'put', 'song', 'two', 'music', 'really', ""'re"", 'done', 'drilling', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'body', 'reacting', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'readily', 'before', 'greater', 'variety', 'movements']",Drills!

But I thought that it would be better to do isolation drills of all the moves and then just teach choreography breaking it up into sections then altogether with instruction then without instruction but she doesn't do this she does the choreography based on drilling - I think it is better just to dance because that is what it is belly dance.  People can do other things to strengthen their muscles.  I do yoga and that gives me really strong core muscles and good posture.

1145206,AVPM4HFPBHGFK,B00144Y8XG,Deborah P,"[3, 3]","I knew that she would drill very basic moves despite the DVD title. But I thought she would drill a lot more layering type stuff than she did. I did NOT expect it would be like Sadie's Thrillin Drillin (advanced) but I thought it would be a bit closer.I have to say, I liked the longer sets of repetition. The only other bellydance instructors who gets this right (at a reasonable price) seem to be Ansuya and Jillina.I saw improvement in my 3/4 shimmy's almost immediately. I'd say she does the 3/4-ups for 2.5 minutes slow then 2.5 minutes fast. The 3/4-downs for more like 4. Then she does a straight shimmy drill for more than 5 minutes--but there's too big a jump in the speed for me from slow to fast was way to big. There could have been a speed in-between but this can easily be fixed by using the speed controls on your DVD Player.I don't like learning to music WITHOUT a definitive down beat--especially from an instructor that never counts beats out loud. Straight drums doesn't do it for me. During shimmy practice, I couldn't tell when I was sliding off the beat. And what's worse---I couldn't tell when she was...which brings me to my next point.""Tiny"" and ""controlled"" are not synonymous: There was one section point where she starts doing hip slides as she's shimmying BUT: 1) You can't see any slide and 2) her moves are so tiny (which she seems to brag about) that you can't tell there's much more than an uncontrolled wiggle (AND somehow she was hip down on the outsides when she told us we were doing UPS for the shimmy.)And back to the ""TINY"" thing --one day when I re-started the DVD at a mid-point where she was doing a box with her hips--I couldn't tell if she was moving clockwise or counter-clockwise because her hip moves were so ""tiny"" that her hips releasing back looked almost exactly like her hip contraction forwardThe other section of this that I liked was the cymbal instruction. I was expecting it to be very much geared to the absolute beginner and it was.I feel like I am an intermediate to advanced dancer. Despite the fact that I do believe as the instructor believes--that getting things into your muscle memory is important--there was not enough teaching or layering done here to claim it's for all levels. Nearly UN-defined, very UN-LUSH movement has been a major problem in her dancing for me. But usually there's more bang for your buck teaching wise. I was disappointed.I'd say that this DVD would best suit the beginner dancer moving to intermediate--but even then I'd combine it with one of Ansuya's for better explanation of some of the moves before using it as if it's a dance-partner/drilling-buddy.Beginners? They should get this if they aren't easily frustrated. And again, I'd say they'd do better if they had a companion DVD. Beginners would need more reminders about keeping the pelvis up and not letting their feet roll out and such.",3,"Very, Very basic drills, not for all levels",1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2889,"['knew', 'would', 'drill', 'very', 'basic', 'moves', 'DVD', 'title', 'thought', 'would', 'drill', 'lot', 'more', 'layering', 'type', 'stuff', 'did', 'did', 'NOT', 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'Sadie', 'Thrillin', 'Drillin', 'advanced', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'closer.I', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'longer', 'sets', 'repetition', 'only', 'other', 'bellydance', 'instructors', 'who', 'right', 'reasonable', 'price', 'seem', 'be', 'Ansuya', 'Jillina.I', 'saw', 'improvement', '3/4', 'shimmy', 'almost', 'immediately', ""'d"", 'say', '3/4-ups', '2.5', 'minutes', 'slow', 'then', '2.5', 'minutes', 'fast', '3/4-downs', 'more', 'like', '4', 'Then', 'straight', 'shimmy', 'drill', 'more', '5', 'minutes', 'too', 'big', 'jump', 'speed', 'slow', 'fast', 'was', 'way', 'big', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'speed', 'in-between', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'fixed', 'using', 'speed', 'controls', 'DVD', 'Player.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'learning', 'music', 'WITHOUT', 'definitive', 'down', 'beat', 'especially', 'instructor', 'never', 'beats', 'out', 'loud', 'Straight', 'drums', ""n't"", 'do', 'shimmy', 'practice', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'when', 'was', 'sliding', 'off', 'beat', 'what', 'worse', '-I', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'when', 'was', 'next', 'point', 'Tiny', 'controlled', 'are', 'not', 'synonymous', 'was', 'one', 'section', 'point', 'where', 'doing', 'hip', 'slides', 'shimmying', 'BUT', '1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'slide', '2', 'moves', 'are', 'so', 'tiny', 'brag', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'uncontrolled', 'wiggle', 'somehow', 'was', 'hip', 'down', 'outsides', 'when', 'told', 'were', 'doing', 'UPS', 'shimmy', 'back', 'TINY', 'thing', 'one', 'day', 'when', 're-started', 'DVD', 'mid-point', 'where', 'was', 'doing', 'box', 'hips', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'moving', 'clockwise', 'counter-clockwise', 'hip', 'moves', 'were', 'so', 'tiny', 'hips', 'releasing', 'back', 'looked', 'almost', 'exactly', 'hip', 'contraction', 'other', 'section', 'liked', 'was', 'cymbal', 'instruction', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'geared', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'was.I', 'feel', 'am', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'dancer', 'fact', 'do', 'believe', 'instructor', 'getting', 'things', 'muscle', 'memory', 'important', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'teaching', 'layering', 'done', 'here', 'claim', 'levels', 'Nearly', 'UN-defined', 'very', 'UN-LUSH', 'movement', 'been', 'major', 'problem', 'dancing', 'usually', 'more', 'bang', 'buck', 'teaching', 'wise', 'was', 'disappointed.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'DVD', 'would', 'best', 'suit', 'beginner', 'dancer', 'moving', 'intermediate', 'even', 'then', ""'d"", 'combine', 'one', 'Ansuya', 'better', 'explanation', 'moves', 'using', 'dance-partner/drilling-buddy.Beginners', 'should', 'get', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'frustrated', 'again', ""'d"", 'say', ""'d"", 'do', 'better', 'had', 'companion', 'DVD', 'Beginners', 'would', 'need', 'more', 'reminders', 'keeping', 'pelvis', 'up', 'not', 'letting', 'feet', 'roll', 'out', 'such']",Drills!

All I can say is WOW - this is the drill DVD that I've been waiting for!!I can't praise Michelle enough for the quality and quantity of information contained on this DVD, while keeping the price affordable. Which, in this out of control economy, I am sure is not an easy task.The first thing that I realized about this DVD is that, to paraphrase the back cover of the box, it truly is ""a lesson in how to practice"". I have never seen a DVD that teaches this important aspect of learning how to belly dance. I've been taking lessons for close to four years and I honestly say that I had no idea how to structure my home practice sessions until I watched this DVD! I know that, from now on, I'll be able to get the most out of the precious minutes I have to spare to work on my ""skills"" (and, in my case, I use that term loosely.)Now to the title subject - Drills! Let me tell you, these are NOT your mother's belly dance drills - these are serious drills. The kind of drills that will get you in shape and increase your belly dance skills at the same time. And what an array of drills there are! There are drills for strengthening the muscles, drills to get your shimmy in shape, drills that will truly isolate your isolations, drills that have more layers than a bakery full of cakes (mmmm..cakes...), and something that I have never seen included in ""drill"" DVDs - ZIL DRILLS!!! Yippee!!I can see this DVD staying at the very top of my list for a LONG, LONG time as it will, not only, improve my dancing and overall fitness, it will help me (finally) learn how to focus.Again, many, many thanks Michelle!!!PS - I also think this dvd would be great for any dancer no matter what genre of bellydance they study as these drills transcend style. So whether you are into Egyptian cabaret, tribal fusion, gothic tribal, Bellynesian, or whatever ""Drills! Drills! Drills!"" is an effective - and invaluable - tool that will build your overall physical strength and improve your dance skills.

It was different from other Drill dvds because of the small choreographies she used to achieve her drilling sessions. I was also happy with the zill drill she added to her unique drilling sessions. While i did not like the specific drill choreographies she used, it did give me a platform to make up my own drill choreographies using the concept that Micelle has introduced here. I really appreciate her fun method of drilling. It is so much better than standing still and watching my feet try to turn blue while i repeat a movement over and over the same way for 4 counts of 8.

I've been dancing since 2002 but I've had to go on hiatus since July of 2009. I can't practice with my troupe but 1 day of the week due to my schedule and that day is only for learning and practicing choreography. SO....I decided to get this video to get back into my groove and also get into better shape.Michelle is a demanding taskmaster, but you wouldn't know it by looking at her. Some of these drills are HARD (like the core strengthening) and the video is long. But through my years of dancing and practicing I've found out that we really don't hit our stride until 45 min or so into the practice session. Some of the moves I have trouble with (especially layering stuff over a grapevine, I'm not used to doing that), but I know if I keep doing them, one day the proverbial light bulb will switch on and I will do it correctly!I really like how Michelle talks about the importance of drilling. It is true that when a lot of dancers get past the beginning stage, they forget about the basics or think they aren't important, which is totally not true. Going back to the basics and drilling those core moves will ALWAYS make you a better dancer, no matter what level you're at. Also, her talk about posture and drilling the moves on both sides is good advice.Now for the cons:-I notice the audio cues sometimes don't come soon enough. When she tells you to do hip bumps for example, it comes right on top of when she starts doing the hip bumps.-The counts on the moves are not always even. Especially during the isolation drills where one foot changes positions. She'll do 4 of one, 6 of the next one, 5 of the next one, then 8, etc. Some people might not even notice this but I did, so I just tried my best to even out the counts of each move.-There isn't really a warm up. I chalked it up to this video being for intermediate/advanced dancers who should already know the importance of warming up, but it would still be nice to have one.I also ordered the Pop, Lock and Shimmy video so I will try that one tonight.

1145212,ASXXZIFEKXJK6,B00144Y8XG,"Melissa A. Cain ""Misha""","[20, 20]","Title:  Drills! Drills! Drills!Instructor: Michelle JoyceLevel: ""All Levels"" of dancersInfo:  115 minutesYou can practice your moves, your choreography, your improv and your performance skills, but what is the secret to flawless technique? How do you keep your locks and pops sharp and your eights and circles smooth and flowing throughout a long dance set? The ""secret"" isn't such a surprise - it takes a lot of hard work and practice of course!I've heard many students bemoan the lack of a good motivator at home to help them practice. They learn movements in class, but have trouble practicing on their own at home. Or, they're tired of instructional videos that just teach movements and want to enhance and improve what they already know.If you're looking for that cosmic ""kick in the rear"" to jump start your dancing and help tune-up your technique, this is the video for you. Michelle presents a well-organized, logical progressive approach that will appeal to pros and novices alike. As with other videos, Michelle does not just promote the dance but infuses her material with a nod towards fitness, creating a work that will help to improve all aspects of a dancer's form. Overall, this DVD is just fabulous. Michelle has put together a really well planned and executed offering for dancers of ALL abilities. This DVD is the ""total package"" of drills, providing sections to drill everything from core to isolations to layers and zils.DVD sections include:Strengthing Drills: Glutes, back, legs, thighs, lower abs and even the entire core are covered during this part of the DVD. Michelle begins with Suhalia-style glute squeezes and gives a detailed description of how, and how not, to execute the movement. A selection of drills for other parts of the body come next and trust me these exercises will definitely help you get into dancing shape! Here, too, are drills that will improve strength and control for specific movements including body rolls and undulations....Isolation Drills: Now Michelle begins to focus on various dance movements. As with the strengthening drills she explains each movement clearly and concisely. Not only does Michelle demonstrate and breakdown the movements, but she also describes the muscles that drive each move. Frequently describing weight shifts and the anatomical changes involved with each movement, Michelle covers a total of 7 isolations before moving on to the actual isolation drill itself. This drill moves out of the standard ""home"" or basic position, incorporating a variety of foot patterns and arm positions while drilling the isolations broken down earlier. Movements are performed on both sides of the body and at a variety of speeds. In this way, the isolation drill has a bonus level of complexity as it also incorporates layering of body, arm, and feet position. Not only can you tighten up your isolations but you can also work on additional layers at the same time.Finger Cymbal Drills: In the next section of the DVD, Michelle adds an additional layer to drilling by incorporating finger cymbals. First the three patterns that will be played are introduced along with explanations as to how each should be played. Michelle explains each in several different ways (according to dums and teks, counts, and hands) and there's even a bar that appears across the screen that breaks down each pattern. There's even a brief description about how to wear and play the cymbals, again making this valuable for both beginners and more experienced dancers. During the drill, Michelle plays each pattern and leads viewers through a series of arm movements.Zig Zag Drill: This one was a new concept for me and one of the best on the entire DVD (and believe me, it was hard to pick a favorite!). Here Michelle describes a unique pattern that the body will take through the drill. This pattern is repeated through the hips (repeated on each side), pelvis, and chest. After first breaking down the drill and explaining how to do each aspect of it there is a section for dancers to follow along. Michelle then ups the anti by adding in zils along with the hip, pelvis, and chest patterns. This pattern is a wonderful way to increase range of motion in each area while working on locks and pops. I confess that here alone I spent several days just playing with the zig zag!Feet and Hip Layering Drill: Another great section. Michelle breaks down the footwork (grapevine step) and then layers various movements onto the traveling step. Once again, she does a great job of explaining this section and also describes Suhalia's method of denoting when the movement will occur in conjunction to the music. As someone who's tried to briefly studied the Suhalia method (and admittedly got mired down in the nomenclature) it was very helpful to see the movement demonstrated as the step was counted. Next comes the follow along section where Michelle layers 7 movements onto the step. As with several of the other drill sections, there is a voiceover track while Michelle runs the follow-along drill. A nice touch here is all the good tips Michelle gives while demonstrating the drill. If you listen as you follow along and drill, you'll pick up a number of nice points on technique and polish. Oh, and don't worry if you're a zil enthusiast - the ENTIRE drill of the layered traveling movements is repeated with added finger cymbals.3/4 and Standing Shimmy Drills: Two different ways to perform the 3/4 shimmy are presented here: a hip-drop version and a hip up version. Michelle also demonstrates several different variations on the movement before going into the drills. Each of the two forms are drilled slowly first and then at a speedy rate. The drills aren't simply done in place, however - Michelle moves you forward, backward, and even in circles. The next section really needs no breakdown or explanation at all, and is simply a follow along shimmy drill. Once again Michelle performs the drill, adding different arms with the shimmy and varying speeds, as a voiceover plays. Here too dancers will find a number of great tips as they practice with Michelle. As the drill progresses, the shimmies change and become increasingly harder in difficulty and speed.Hip and Chest Layering Drill: Here Michelle combines hips with ribs. Breakdown first, and then a rather challenging drill. Each section of the body moves independently of the other and this will definitely provide a good challenge for most dancers. As the chest movement switches directions, the pacing of the different levels is varied, and other additional variations are presented this drill offers material for many challenging practice sessions. And, once you're comfortable with the drill layers, you can always follow along to the zil section.Choreography: The final part of the DVD is a choreography that combines all of the drills on the DVD. The inclusion of this on a drill DVD was brilliant - it provides dancers with a quick way to practice all of the various drills while also drilling their brain too! Not only can you drill your movements but you can actually practice learning material at the same time. Michelle's so sneaky! The choreography is broken down into 4 manageable sections and is then presented in full for dancers to practice.What Worked for Me:* I loved the inclusion of strengthening exercises and the thought of using these as a drill. We so frequently drill ""just the moves"" and it was great to see the idea of strength drills included on a DVD. Some of these movements were intense (see below) but once you master them you will have a wonderfully strong body on which to base your dance.* The progression of this DVD, from basic foundational material and drills to layers to zils and a full choreography, was well planned out. Each section was covered thoroughly and with a good attention to detail. Dancers of different levels will be able to adjust their practice plan accordingly rather than just having to tumble through a haphazard arrangement of drills as on some other DVDs.* The application of various speeds and pacing for many of the drills was a nice touch. Frequently drills are demonstrated at only one speed and this variation was a nice way. I also loved the idea of switching the ""leading"" hip from side to side while working on each drill.* The zig-zag drill was creative and offered me a new approach to drilling. For anyone who feels ""stuck in a drilling rut"" this new form alone would give you hours of challenging material.* Michelle explains her drills according to the music, inspiring a musicality that many other drill systems lack. Frequently drills are simply demonstrated, but here Michelle talks about matching them to the downbeat and other aspects of the music helping dancers to drill not only the moves but musical interpretation too.What Might Not Work for You:* If you're not a fan of the Suhaila style drills that are fairly intense exercises, you might not like the strength drill section of this DVD. Similarly, if you never play zils then the finger cymbal section might not be your cup of tea. The nice thing, however, is that there is still a ton of information that will benefit dancers of all levels.* At times, it was a bit difficult to see Michelle's feet. Personally this was not an issue for me once I understood which feet positions she was incorporating into her drills. But for some this might present a problem as the instructor's feet positions are only shown in the mirror behind her. For some, only seeing the feet mirrored may be a bit difficult to follow.One last note: I teach a regular, weekly drills class. I love drills, and try to think of all sorts of fun and unique ways to do various movements and dance concepts. I *really* enjoyed this DVD and was quite impressed with the approach to the isolation and zig zag drill sections in particular. If you're looking for new material to drill, or even just new ways to execute your drills, I'd really recommend this DVD.PS - This review is THIS LONG because there really is that much amazing material packed into this DVD!",5,Practice Makes Perfect?

Being a former ballet/contemporary dancer, I know the importance of keeping up with basic exercises to keep the body well conditioned for dance.I discovered belly dance about 7 years ago, and completely fell in love with the art form and decided to study it extensively.  But I always wished there was a method I could learn that is similar to the exercises I used to do in my ballet classes, in order to strengthen and tone the appropriate muscles and improve my quality and technique dance.Michelle's DVD has given me exactly what I had been craving in my belly dance practice.  It is very challenging, fun, and well produced!  She has certainly given me a lot to work on now.  Michelle has a very sweet and super friendly personality, so it's very motivating for me to put the DVD on and spend a little time practicing with her! She uses both encouragment and positive reinforcment to keep me working hard, especially through some of the more challenging drills.All in all, this is an exceptional DVD for belly dancers who wish to refine their technique.
