Rader ""ashreec""","[0, 0]","this is one of my favorite turbo jam workouts. it is great for the days when i need a longer exercise session. it stays with true turbo jam form with punches, kicks and knees. the music is really great and upbeat. my only concern is when i put it in my laptop to play it said it was playing speed 2 which makes me concerned with if it is authentic or not. i did get it from a seller through amazon. that has nothing to do with the workout though. the workout was great and everyone should try this dvd.",5,great turbo jam workout,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,502,"['one', 'favorite', 'turbo', 'jam', 'workouts', 'great', 'days', 'when', 'i', 'need', 'longer', 'exercise', 'session', 'true', 'turbo', 'jam', 'form', 'punches', 'kicks', 'knees', 'music', 'really', 'great', 'upbeat', 'only', 'concern', 'when', 'i', 'put', 'laptop', 'play', 'said', 'was', 'playing', 'speed', '2', 'concerned', 'authentic', 'not', 'i', 'did', 'get', 'seller', 'amazon', 'nothing', 'do', 'workout', 'workout', 'was', 'great', 'everyone', 'should', 'try', 'dvd']",N/A

Well, the problem is that it goes so fast, I have trouble learning the moves and I cannot stand not being in sync. Anyway, this one is not for me.

At the front of the workout Chalene says that its not as dancey - and she is right.  Its definitely not as much fun as the Cardio Party videos.  Its way too long, seems to drag on forever at 50 minutes.  Also to me some of the footwork at the end is hard to keep up with, especially the Capoiera Cooldown.

Anyways, when I tried this, I LOVE IT! I feel really great after the work out and it's not as hard as I it was said to be.  The only thing I don't like is when she goes into that Brazil thing.

1030119,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,B000JZ4TPI,Honest,"[3, 4]","I gave this video 3 stars just because it is the fast-paced movement that the average person needs to increase cardiovascular fitness. This was the first DVD I had ever done from the Turbo Jam line and I cannot help but think that this was an attempt (attempt being the operative word)to bite off of Billy Blanks' Tae Bo. However, comparing the two, I don't feel that this even comes close mainly because of some of the technique. You learn early on that this is not about the boxing technique but about dancing and bopping around while haphazardly flailing your arms. I did not see any precision in the movements. It is also very very repetitive; almost boringly so. There are three main sections denoted by a change of music and within each section you repeat the same set of movements over and over on each side. Then there's a faster-paced breakdown with a bunch of random movements followed by a slower paced capoeira section.If Tae Bo isn't your thing but you like kickboxing or martial arts-style workouts, I recommend Ilaria Montagnani workouts. However, if you like to dance or want a more relaxed workout, then you'll probably be okay with Turbo Jam.",3,It's Exercise,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1160,"['gave', 'video', '3', 'stars', 'just', 'fast-paced', 'movement', 'average', 'person', 'increase', 'cardiovascular', 'fitness', 'was', 'first', 'DVD', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'Turbo', 'Jam', 'line', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'was', 'attempt', 'attempt', 'being', 'operative', 'word', 'bite', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'However', 'comparing', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'even', 'close', 'mainly', 'technique', 'learn', 'early', 'not', 'boxing', 'technique', 'dancing', 'bopping', 'around', 'haphazardly', 'flailing', 'arms', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'precision', 'movements', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'repetitive', 'almost', 'boringly', 'so', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'sections', 'denoted', 'change', 'music', 'section', 'repeat', 'same', 'set', 'movements', 'side', 'Then', 'faster-paced', 'breakdown', 'bunch', 'random', 'movements', 'followed', 'slower', 'paced', 'capoeira', 'section.If', 'Tae', 'Bo', ""n't"", 'thing', 'like', 'kickboxing', 'martial', 'arts-style', 'workouts', 'recommend', 'Ilaria', 'Montagnani', 'workouts', 'However', 'like', 'dance', 'want', 'more', 'relaxed', 'workout', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'okay', 'Turbo', 'Jam']",N/A

I've been doing the Turbo Jam workouts for almost 2 years, and have gotten a lot out of these videos (including a better looking body!).

There is lots of kicking, punching (jabs, etc) and its very fun. This workout is almost an hour long, and it makes you SWEAT.

1030125,AV33FCIDH59N8,B000JZ4TPI,Reviewer,"[48, 49]","This is a wonderful high intensity workout.  If you haven't tried Turbo Jam, you are in for a real workout treat!  Chalene takes what might be boring punch and kick moves and turns them into exciting ab core exercises that really get you motivated and working out!  This is one of my favorite workout DVD's in the Turbo collection.  She has some wonderful combination moves that are great and get you pumped.  I've been doing Turbo Jam for a short while but lost weight and inches (read my review on Turbo Jam Fat Blaster).  This is a great workout DVD.  The moves are designed to flow with your own natural movement and there is a team member on all the DVD's, Mindy, who always does the modified version for those who need a little boost.  For the rest of us, these moves can be pumped higher and hotter to get the best cardio workout.  If you don't know about Chalene and her infectious smile and truly inspirational workout spirit, you are missing out on a great thing! This DVD has about six minutes of warm up which starts off hot and moves into the rest of its 48 minutes (total) of hard workout.  The end of the DVD has some tubular toning, just a couple of minutes or so. The tube thing is a rubber band with handles to work the deltoids and glutes (butt muscles) to tone.  I think it was a way to introduce the tube idea - I'm not so crazy about it.  (Producers should let her do what she does best and thats pump, punch, kick and jam).  On the other hand, the tubes help you learn balance and coordination which calls for a different use of your muscles.) The DVD ends with about a three minute stretching routine.  I do the tube stuff at the end as part of a cool down anyway. My only personal bias is that I wish they would have lengthened the cardio by a few minutes and dumped the tubular stuff.  You will however get your total cardio workout and will feel it at the end.  It's a great routine by design, it is a total workout and one of my absolute best in my collection.  The DVD is about 50 minutes long in total workout time.",5,One of my absolute favorite Turbo Jam DVD!,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,2045,"['wonderful', 'high', 'intensity', 'workout', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'Turbo', 'Jam', 'are', 'real', 'workout', 'treat', 'Chalene', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'boring', 'punch', 'kick', 'moves', 'exciting', 'ab', 'core', 'exercises', 'really', 'get', 'motivated', 'working', 'out', 'one', 'favorite', 'workout', 'DVD', 'Turbo', 'collection', 'wonderful', 'combination', 'moves', 'are', 'great', 'get', 'pumped', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Turbo', 'Jam', 'short', 'while', 'lost', 'weight', 'inches', 'read', 'review', 'Turbo', 'Jam', 'Fat', 'Blaster', 'great', 'workout', 'DVD', 'moves', 'are', 'designed', 'flow', 'own', 'natural', 'movement', 'team', 'member', 'DVD', 'Mindy', 'who', 'always', 'modified', 'version', 'who', 'need', 'little', 'boost', 'rest', 'moves', 'can', 'be', 'pumped', 'higher', 'hotter', 'get', 'best', 'cardio', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chalene', 'infectious', 'smile', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'workout', 'spirit', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'great', 'thing', 'DVD', 'six', 'minutes', 'warm', 'up', 'hot', 'rest', '48', 'minutes', 'total', 'hard', 'workout', 'end', 'DVD', 'tubular', 'toning', 'just', 'couple', 'minutes', 'so', 'tube', 'thing', 'rubber', 'band', 'handles', 'work', 'deltoids', 'glutes', 'muscles', 'tone', 'think', 'was', 'way', 'introduce', 'tube', 'idea', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'crazy', 'Producers', 'should', 'let', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'thats', 'pump', 'punch', 'kick', 'jam', 'other', 'hand', 'tubes', 'help', 'learn', 'balance', 'coordination', 'different', 'use', 'muscles', 'DVD', 'three', 'minute', 'stretching', 'routine', 'do', 'tube', 'stuff', 'end', 'part', 'cool', 'down', 'anyway', 'only', 'personal', 'bias', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'lengthened', 'cardio', 'few', 'minutes', 'dumped', 'tubular', 'stuff', 'will', 'however', 'get', 'total', 'cardio', 'workout', 'will', 'feel', 'end', 'great', 'routine', 'design', 'total', 'workout', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'collection', 'DVD', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'total', 'workout', 'time']",N/A
