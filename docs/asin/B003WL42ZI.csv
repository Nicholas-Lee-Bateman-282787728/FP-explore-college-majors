I really like how out of the box it is. It has a completely different feel and great music. I don't feel it is her showing off poses as some reviews said, at all. It is a very devoted yogi sharing her practice with us in a beautiful format. I like the different settings and the choices you have for practices. Maybe just watch them through once to get a feel for them. I am really happy to have added this to my collection, and would definitely recommend it!",5,Different in a GOOD way :-),1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,595,"['love', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'get', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'agree', 'not', 'beginners', 'ok', 'really', 'how', 'box', 'completely', 'different', 'feel', 'great', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'showing', 'off', 'poses', 'reviews', 'said', 'very', 'devoted', 'yogi', 'sharing', 'practice', 'beautiful', 'format', 'like', 'different', 'settings', 'choices', 'have', 'practices', 'Maybe', 'just', 'watch', 'once', 'get', 'feel', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'have', 'added', 'collection', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",Tara Stiles - Yoga Anywhere: The New York Sessions
1369589,A1TUPUD0LJR5UP,B003WL42ZI,"Adriana Dos Santos ""Ichabod Crane""","[1, 1]","Never mind about envious reviews. This is a completely awsome, STRONG and challenging 60' yoga class, with the most clear instructions that I've ever watched in Tara Stiles' videos. She guides you through the poses almost patiently, with less chatting than usual, and better shape in preparations and poses. Of course, you should know it would be a journey to complete the sequence only by breathing deeply and moving with ease... It would take time, sweat, balance, strenght and so on. This dvd is going to be your yoga companion for several months, before you can achieve a graceful performance (or even finish it with some pride). By then, your entire body would be more strong and flexible than ever. And you surely would sweat some pounds off. NOW: Some reviews complain about the bonuses: the music is so loud, the clothes are not proper, instructions are not given, Tara is just showing off yoga poses... I think the bonuses are beautiful. They show you how much you can achieve by learning from the class. The incredible freedom of yoga, the art of developing such graceful balance, and be FREE to express it ANYWHERE with ease. I found the bonuses very inspiring. You can see the development of the poses far beyond the class, not for &#34;showing off&#34;, but for YOUR motivation. For you to find your own Yoga, ANYWHERE you are.",5,My favourite Tara Stiles' DVD!,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1340,"['Never', 'mind', 'envious', 'reviews', 'completely', 'awsome', 'STRONG', 'challenging', '60', 'yoga', 'class', 'most', 'clear', 'instructions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'videos', 'poses', 'almost', 'patiently', 'less', 'chatting', 'usual', 'better', 'shape', 'preparations', 'poses', 'course', 'should', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'journey', 'complete', 'sequence', 'only', 'breathing', 'deeply', 'moving', 'ease', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'sweat', 'balance', 'strenght', 'so', 'dvd', 'going', 'be', 'yoga', 'companion', 'several', 'months', 'can', 'achieve', 'graceful', 'performance', 'even', 'finish', 'pride', 'then', 'entire', 'body', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'strong', 'flexible', 'ever', 'surely', 'would', 'sweat', 'pounds', 'off', 'NOW', 'reviews', 'complain', 'bonuses', 'music', 'so', 'loud', 'clothes', 'are', 'not', 'proper', 'instructions', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'Tara', 'just', 'showing', 'off', 'yoga', 'poses', 'think', 'bonuses', 'are', 'beautiful', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'achieve', 'learning', 'class', 'incredible', 'freedom', 'yoga', 'art', 'developing', 'such', 'graceful', 'balance', 'be', 'FREE', 'express', 'ANYWHERE', 'ease', 'found', 'bonuses', 'very', 'inspiring', 'can', 'see', 'development', 'poses', 'far', 'class', 'not', '34', 'showing', 'off', '34', 'YOUR', 'motivation', 'find', 'own', 'Yoga', 'ANYWHERE', 'are']",Tara Stiles - Yoga Anywhere: The New York Sessions

There are good & bad things about it.Good- The routine is challenging & great for people trying to improve or advance their practice; Tara is great at instruction: I find I do not need to look at the screen to figure out what she is telling to do.Neutral - The routine is OK. There's not much time for rest or easing into poses as I find this DVD for the advanced. I say I am intermediate. I do not feel at ease doing this routine. In fact, I feel more stressed out during & relieved after!Bad- The music choices are terrible. I have no idea what they were thinking!; the sound editing is not mixed very well and sometimes I have to struggle to hear her over the music; her voice can muffle at times; the bonus routines do not have instruction and are ""over-edited"" with flashy colors and all. Not sure what that's about :PThe biggest problem with this DVD is the lack of quality.Since her second DVD came out, I do not use this one anymore. I tried to go back to it, but the quality is lacking.Tara is fantastic & this DVD does not show case her at all.",3,It's OK...,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,1103,"['*Updated', 'Review*I', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'DVD', 'while', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'it.Good-', 'routine', 'challenging', 'great', 'people', 'trying', 'improve', 'advance', 'practice', 'Tara', 'great', 'instruction', 'find', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'look', 'screen', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'telling', 'do.Neutral', 'routine', 'OK', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'rest', 'easing', 'poses', 'find', 'DVD', 'advanced', 'say', 'am', 'intermediate', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'ease', 'doing', 'routine', 'fact', 'feel', 'more', 'stressed', 'relieved', 'Bad-', 'music', 'choices', 'are', 'terrible', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'sound', 'editing', 'not', 'mixed', 'very', 'well', 'sometimes', 'have', 'struggle', 'hear', 'music', 'voice', 'can', 'muffle', 'times', 'bonus', 'routines', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'instruction', 'are', 'over-edited', 'flashy', 'colors', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'PThe', 'biggest', 'problem', 'DVD', 'lack', 'quality.Since', 'second', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'one', 'anymore', 'tried', 'go', 'back', 'quality', 'lacking.Tara', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'not', 'show', 'case']",Tara Stiles - Yoga Anywhere: The New York Sessions

First, just go to her website and the first thing you see are photos of Tara posing provocatively in a nude colored body suit, on a couch with her ass in the air, like she's ready to be taken doggie style.  That's poser yoga.  Secondly, she rushes through everything and there's no time to get a real stretch.  Thirdly, on the DVD cover, she's posing with incorrect alignment (hips are optimally squared, not open to the side).  Again, to better view her long hair? So which is more important?  Proper alignment or a shot of Tara's hair? It feels like something a teenager might produce and market.... Look at my hair.... Bad sign.Sorry, but with so many really GOOD yoga DVDs out there and so many good teachers, this model who's so into herself instead of the art of the yoga practice is not necessary.  And how did she get Deepak Chopra's endorsement?

1369592,A3F68N9OI8Y67,B003WL42ZI,Fitness Fan,"[6, 9]","Wow, I sure was disappointed in this DVD!  Let me count the ways:#1 with a bullet - the music...sorry, but hip hop music and yoga Don't Mix!  I don't want to hear a singer going ""Yo, yo"" while I'm in downward dog, ok?  I mean, at least provide a music off option for those not hip enough to enjoy the music.#2 - the hair...what's up with that?  It's called a scrunchie!  Oops, I'm sorry, scrunchies are out!  How about a headband or a couple of barrettes?  If you MUST wear it loose, at least stop mentioning it every 2 minutes.#3 - the outfit....short shorts, a tank top, and leg warmers?  Is this the 70's and you are going out to roller skate after your yoga session?  Do I really need to see that much of your butt cheeks peaking out of your short shorts?It's such a shame because Tara really is a decent yoga instructor.

1369595,A10KO7JBBIYRL2,B003WL42ZI,Nanyamka Sandusky,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed Tara Stiles's Yoga Anywhere.  Although on the cover of the video it says the workout is two hours.  That is very misleading. The main session is about 52 minutes.  Then it has four different ten minute sessions showing Tara doing yoga in different places.If you want to get the most out of this workout just do the 52 minute main section.  I didn't think the music was annoying at all.  I was suprised at all the negative reviews.  She went slowly through most of the yoga postures and then did a few challenging postures that I modified.I did not like the four ten minute sessions, which is why I'm giving it four stars.  The ten minute sessions are set to loud music and she does not instruct at all.  It's just her showing off some yoga moves.  I would buy this dvd for the 52 minute session.  I was suprised at the amount of sweating I did.  She does give a lot of instructions in the main session.  The ten minute sessions were hard to follow.I did not think her clothes were too tight or revealing.  I have seen her on her utube videos with her hair in a pony tail.  She is a great instructor.  I think a lot of people may hate her because she's a beautiful young lady with a successful business.  She's got beautiful hair and she was not messing with it doing the video.  Either that or I was too busy doing the postures to care about what she was doing with her hair.  On her website she also talks about eating clean etc.  Yoginis may also be mad because at the end of the session we didn't do any kind of meditation.  That's fine with me.  I'm just trying to get more flexible.  If I want to relax a few minutes I can lay down on my mat once the session is over and work on my breathing.  I think this dvd would be great for weight loss benefits.  When I do yoga dvds I don't normally sweat.  I sweated with her workout.

The best thing about this DVD is that the one routine (60 mins) can be used at all levels. For each pose Tara starts at the beginner level and then quickly shows what you could also do with the pose (intermediate and advanced variations).

I own over 50 yoga dvds and am always looking for something interesting to add to the rotation, but this was a disappointment.Perhaps my first clue should have been when I opened the box and was greeted by Ms. Stile's come-hither look on the dvd's cover picture.  And then, there was the quote chosen for the cover: ""Tara's got to be the coolest yoga instructor ever,"" (Vanity Fair).  Oh, dear.  Seems rather un-yoga, to care about looking sexy and being ""the coolest.""Still, I gave the ""hour"" practice a shot.  Although there are some interesting balancing sequences, the poorly chosen music and/or sound mix prevents her voice from being clearly heard.  Also of no help in that matter is the fact that she wears her long hair down for the entire practice, and it -- surprise! --  keeps getting in her face.  Yo, yogini:  use a hairband.  Pony tail.  Something.  She makes many references to having to adjust her hair.  I want an instructor who cares more about clearly communicating form and sequence than needing to flip back her flowing tresses.  She also made more than one reference to yet another distraction: needing to adjust (ahem) her shorts, which are teeny, teeny, and did I mention teeny?  Acceptable working attire for a roller derby queen or lap dancer but not practical for a serious yoga instructor, who's lifting her leg way up high and...oh, where are those little bits of spandex creeping?
