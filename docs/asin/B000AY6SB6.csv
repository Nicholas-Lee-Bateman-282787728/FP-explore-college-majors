Its easy to see why every comic wanted to imitate TG so bad he ended up changing the whole comedy game.  TGs public access show is arguably his best stuff.I just caught a random cameo by TG at a comedy show and had to accept the harsh reality that TG is no longer funny whatsoever.  At least we have the memories and the DVDs.,5,Brialliant,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,414,"['TG', 'was', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'early', 'days', 'fully', 'deserved', 'skyrocket', 'success', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'comic', 'wanted', 'imitate', 'TG', 'so', 'bad', 'ended', 'up', 'changing', 'whole', 'comedy', 'game', 'TGs', 'public', 'access', 'show', 'arguably', 'best', 'stuff.I', 'just', 'caught', 'random', 'cameo', 'TG', 'comedy', 'show', 'had', 'accept', 'harsh', 'reality', 'TG', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'whatsoever', 'least', 'have', 'memories', 'DVDs']",Tom Green: Inside and Outside the Box

I bought this particular DVD for one episode I'd seen in the past that I thought was the FUNNIEST skit I'd EVER seen by ANYONE. To my disappointment, it wasn't on this DVD. If they claim to have EVERY episode on this DVD, then atleast ONE is missing. I give his parents cudos for not KILLING HIM for this episode, where they wake up in the morning to find a statue of his Father BANGING his Mother from behind on their FRONT LAWN. I remember laughing so hard at the SHOCK value of this episode and the expression on his parents faces when they discovered the statue, that I COULD NOT BREATHE because I laughed all the air out of my lungs, I swear I almost passed out from laughter! It is STILL the funniest skit I EVER seen ANYONE do and it wasn't on this box set.

Bam is the biggest Tom Green thief (and I like Bam), but Tom was torturing his parents on video years before Bam even got his first camcorder. Tom Green's goofy interviews, his obnoxious public displays and his silly characters still make me giggle harder than anything on Jackass. I am 36 years old, but this box set has me in stitches every time I watch it. A TON of these clips were used on Tom's MTV show in the late 90's. In fact, the majority of Tom's MTV show was made up of the stuff that you will find on this excellent 3 disc set. Squid Suit, Feet On Fire, Processing Juice (...), Caramel Lovin' Hick, Celebrity Interviews, Officer Green, Torturing Parents Skits, Milking The Cow(s) almost every other skit you remember is here.
