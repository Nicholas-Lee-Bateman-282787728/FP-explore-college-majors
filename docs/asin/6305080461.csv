A really fascinating segment for me was seeing the actual home movie of Denise Mc Nair and a couple of the other girls. Good job Spike. This is by far his best film.The DVD extras are very good, particularly the pathetic interview with the notorious George Wallace uncut. Poor Ed (see the film and you'll understand that last statement).Only minor complaint is that there isn't a scene selection on the DVD. You'll have to watch it all the way through. Also, it would be nice if some mention was made of Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware (the two little boys who were also killed on that fateful Sunday, which is another story waiting to be told).But that aside, it's great that Spike did this while so many of those who were around to remember all this are still alive.

447690,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6305080461,Anyechka,"[9, 9]","This powerful documentary is a wonderful tribute to the four young girls whose lives were cut short in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama on 15 September 1963.  First and foremost, it focuses on their lives, those who knew them, and the events going on in Birmingham while they were growing up.  It doesn't put the entire or primary focus on how they tragically were murdered, although naturally the bombing, the funerals, and the (rather belated) trials of the sick excuses for life who carried out the bombing are covered.  It's a celebration of life, not death.  (There are some brief graphic shots of the post-mortem photos, but as disturbing as these images might be, they carry home the impact of what really happened.)  It really is amazing that their friends, neighbors, and family members were able to retain such dignity and composure even when talking about such sad events and calling to mind people who had such short lives and who died in such an unnatural way.  While they'll be mourning for the rest of their lives, they haven't let the racist murderers destroy their lives.  They've bravely carried on as best they can.For many young people today, be they white or African-American, the events of the Civil Rights Movement are ancient history.  This documentary brings that struggle to life, using great archival footage and making clear how long these injustices had been going on, showing how the authorities let people get away with discrimination and often even cracked down on nonviolent protests themselves.  They would even turn on people who came to these events as observers, like one photographer who wanted to take pictures of the Freedom Riders getting off of the bus.  We're also treated to footage of an old and decrepit George Wallace claiming he wasn't a racist, that he's changed, that his best friend in the world, whom he's travelled all over with, is African-American.  (This guy, Ed, did not look or act like someone who were Wallace's best friend when he was coaxed on-camera; the footage of Wallace claiming he'd changed was pretty unconvincing and seemed as though he were patting himself on the back and rewriting history.)  It really makes the struggle these brave people went through seem real, significant, meaningful, not just something that happened in the distant past and which is no longer relevant.  It's hard to believe that these things were going on only a few decades ago.The opening and closing segments are very, very moving and powerful, and really give the viewer a sense of all that was lost that September day.  These were beautiful promising young girls who were loved by all and who loved everybody, and they were caught up in the middle of a racist society that hated and wanted to kill those who were different, murdered by people who were so filled with hate that they would even murder children.  They could have been doctors, lawyers, human rights advocates, teachers, writers, scientists, or just ordinary people who made a difference in their communities and who lived fine upstanding lives.  Instead they're remembered as civil rights martyrs, and people are left to ponder what might have been.",5,Not to be missed,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,3198,"['powerful', 'documentary', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'four', 'young', 'girls', 'lives', 'were', 'cut', 'short', 'Sixteenth', 'Street', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'bombing', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', '15', 'September', '1963', 'First', 'foremost', 'lives', 'who', 'knew', 'events', 'going', 'Birmingham', 'were', 'growing', 'up', ""n't"", 'put', 'entire', 'primary', 'focus', 'how', 'tragically', 'were', 'murdered', 'naturally', 'bombing', 'funerals', 'rather', 'belated', 'trials', 'sick', 'excuses', 'life', 'who', 'carried', 'out', 'bombing', 'are', 'covered', 'celebration', 'life', 'not', 'death', 'are', 'brief', 'graphic', 'shots', 'post-mortem', 'photos', 'as', 'disturbing', 'images', 'might', 'be', 'carry', 'impact', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'really', 'amazing', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'family', 'members', 'were', 'able', 'retain', 'such', 'dignity', 'composure', 'even', 'when', 'talking', 'such', 'sad', 'events', 'calling', 'mind', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'such', 'short', 'lives', 'who', 'died', 'such', 'unnatural', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'mourning', 'rest', 'lives', 'have', ""n't"", 'let', 'racist', 'murderers', 'destroy', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'bravely', 'carried', 'best', 'can.For', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'be', 'white', 'African-American', 'events', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'are', 'ancient', 'history', 'documentary', 'brings', 'struggle', 'life', 'using', 'great', 'archival', 'footage', 'making', 'clear', 'how', 'long', 'injustices', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'showing', 'how', 'authorities', 'let', 'people', 'get', 'away', 'discrimination', 'often', 'even', 'cracked', 'down', 'nonviolent', 'protests', 'would', 'even', 'turn', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'events', 'observers', 'one', 'photographer', 'who', 'wanted', 'take', 'pictures', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'getting', 'off', 'bus', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'footage', 'old', 'decrepit', 'George', 'Wallace', 'claiming', 'was', ""n't"", 'racist', 'changed', 'best', 'friend', 'world', 'whom', 'travelled', 'African-American', 'guy', 'Ed', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'act', 'someone', 'who', 'were', 'Wallace', 'best', 'friend', 'when', 'was', 'coaxed', 'on-camera', 'footage', 'Wallace', 'claiming', ""'d"", 'changed', 'was', 'pretty', 'unconvincing', 'seemed', 'were', 'patting', 'back', 'rewriting', 'history', 'really', 'struggle', 'brave', 'people', 'went', 'seem', 'real', 'significant', 'meaningful', 'not', 'just', 'something', 'happened', 'distant', 'past', 'longer', 'relevant', 'hard', 'believe', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'only', 'few', 'decades', 'opening', 'closing', 'segments', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'moving', 'powerful', 'really', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'was', 'lost', 'September', 'day', 'were', 'beautiful', 'promising', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'were', 'loved', 'who', 'loved', 'everybody', 'were', 'caught', 'up', 'middle', 'racist', 'society', 'hated', 'wanted', 'kill', 'who', 'were', 'different', 'murdered', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'filled', 'hate', 'would', 'even', 'murder', 'children', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'human', 'rights', 'advocates', 'teachers', 'writers', 'scientists', 'just', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'difference', 'communities', 'who', 'lived', 'fine', 'upstanding', 'lives', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'remembered', 'civil', 'rights', 'martyrs', 'people', 'are', 'left', 'ponder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been']",4 Little Girls VHS

447694,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6305080461,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, I deposit my two-cents' worth on Spike Lee's well-composed depiction of this tragedy, which came only two weeks after the March on Washington.We are ushered into this powerful piece with the sound of Joan Baez's ""Birmingham Sunday"", an old folk tune turned into a tribute to each of the victims as four young faces brimming with potential flash before us.Through the interviews with the parents of the youngest victim, 11-year-old Denise McNair ,Chris and Maxine, as well as Denise's aunt, Helen Pegues, the mother of 14-year-old victim, Carole Robinson, Alpha Robertson, along with friends and relatives of Addie Mae Collins, and Cynthia Wellesley, who were both also 14, we relive the memories of the days of Bull Connor's turning fireman's hoses on peaceful Civil Rights demonstrators, and learn how even young children who had nothing to lose after being brutalized by Jim Crow laws from birth, engaged in acts of moral and certainly physical courage in order to help achieve justice for all under the American system. Chris McNair relates that having to tell his daughter why she couldn't enjoy patronage of certain places due to her race and seeing her hurt by that revelation was no worse than having to remove an embedded piece of mortar from her skull after the blast.It was the belief of villainous Ku Klux Klansmen Robert Chambliss, and Bobby Frank Cherry that their terrorist act would make blacks beg for segregation again. Decades would pass before they were brought to justice, by which time, a third Klansman also involved in the bombing, Herman Cash, had died.One aspect featured in this documentary is the impact it had on the Court of World Opinion. This incident made headlines around the world, and an interviewee relates that members of the International Rotary Club who were from Birmingham were attending a meeting in Tokyo, Japan at the time, were repeatedly asked about this incident to the point where it drove them crazy and made them state, ""We can't take much more of this!"". Omitted from this documentary is the fact that the new hobby of people in many non-white nations was throwing Americans out of their countries as  a result of this incident. If that is what Americans could do to  four young girls worshipping God and preparing for a church pageant simply because of their race, America's credibility as far as its human rights record was definitely lax! The ""Yankee Go Home"" posters were abound in many quarters!We learn why only three of the girls had joint funerals, and what it was like for some of the mourners to have their loved ones eulogized by Dr. Martin Luther King. King's widow, Coretta relates that her husband wrote letters of condolence to the victim's families the following Christmas.--Expressions of love in sharp contrast to footage of the bombing's aftermath, as well as quickly flashed coroner's photos of each of the young girls. Addie Mae's younger sister, Sarah Collins, was injured in the bombing, but survived.The Reverend Jessie Jackson and comedian Bill Cosby also reflect upon this tragedy. In contrast former Governor George Wallace, whose segregationist stance led him to stand defiantly in the doorway of the registry office of the University of Alabama to oppose Federally enacted desegregation laws the previous June is also interviewed. Wheelchair bound and barely able to speak due to a 1972 shooting during that year's Presidential campaign by one Arthur Brenner(a white man, ironically), the once charismatic arch segregationist is now cowed and pathetic looking in his final years with a black aide by his side trying to convince the world that he's changed. Sadly, he had the chance to tell Alabama to turn things around at that crucial moment, and failed.While Alpha Robertson has expressed forgiveness towards her daughter's killers, and the accompanying strains of ""Birmingham Sunday"" create a sad sense of resignation and having to move on as she speaks, there is still something hopeful and determined about this piece, as America has vastly improved.The final footage of the victims dressed up for Easter, a celebration of resurrection, with their loved ones around them should create a sense of renewal and purpose in all of us.....And may the choir keep singing of freedom!",5,Reliving the Outrage,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,4361,"['eve', '50th', 'anniversary', '16th', 'Street', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Bombing', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama',

447695,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6305080461,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[13, 13]","September 15, 1963 is a date that remains imprinted in the minds of many--particularly, those from Birmingham, Alabama.  This was the day that four innocent young girls died in a racially motivated bombing at an African American Baptist church.  Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins were innocent casualties in a race war that raged on in the Southern United States, as well as the rest of the country.  This was a time when people of all ages were getting involved in the civil rights movement.  This included young children as young as twelve years old (the same age, relatively as the four young girls who were murdered).  This horrific crime motivated people to become more involved in activism, out of a sense of obligation, also to speak out against racially motivated violence, such as the bombing.  Director Spike Lee does a beautiful job of integrating film reel footage from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, along with segments featuring family, friends, and religious leaders connected with the victims, recalling the events that lead up to the tragedy.  What's more, Coretta Scott King (late widow of Martin Luther King, Jr.), Rev. Jesse Jackson and Bill Cosby add their perspective  to the mix.  One of the most chilling parts of the film, for me, was an unsettling clip of the late Governor George Wallace, a notorious advocate for segregation.  When the elderly politician presents his African American ""right hand man"" as his best friend, a chill ran up my spine.This is a really important documentary to see for several reasons.  For starters, I believe everyone should be aware of what took place on that fateful day in Birmingham.  Secondly, the film presents this tragic event in a very beautiful and respectful way.  Spike Lee is a tremendous storyteller and this piece is very understated, and, yet profound.  It's great to see that Lee knows how to make a great statement without resulting in exploitative tactics or manipulation of his audience.  The story speaks for itself and this is not an ego trip on the part of the filmmaker in any way.  It is a tribute to a tragedy that became a catalyst in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the eventual prosecution of Robert Chambliss, one of three racists responsible for the bombing.

I'm an avid viewer of good documentaries, and this is one of the most moving, disturbing I've ever seen. Spike Lee's film of the 1963 bombing of The 16th Street Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which took the lives of four little girls, and became a symbol of the civil rights movement, is not a film that will make you feel comfortable, and it shouldn't. Told through the recollections of their family members and friends, the sense of loss is overwhelming. The fact that all those interviewed, especially the little girls parents, display such eloquent dignity only makes it all the more moving. Though I have none of the ""attributes"" of the hateful leaders of prejudice shown in this film, such as George Wallace and the repulsive ""Bull"", as a caucasian male, my sense of shame, and, my outrage, only increased as the story forebodingly unfolds to the inevitable event itself. The segment where a modern day, supposedly repentant Wallace fumbles witlessly and unconvincingly is especially poignant. Spike Lee has not only crafted a work of art, but allowed the tragic story to tell itself. An unbelievably moving film that will leave you deeply saddened at the irrational, hateful taking of the lives of four beautiful little girls, whose futures, if they can be compared to any one of their family members or friends, held such undoubted promise.

447699,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6305080461,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 5]","Director, Spike Lee, was determined to not let these girls be faceless victims; he wanted us to learn as much as possible about each of them. The girls and their ages were: Denise McNair, 11, Addie Mae Collins, 14, Cynthia Wesley, 14, and Carole Robertson, 14. Lee could have made a movie that described the events and put them in historical perspective of the civil rights movement. This is how documentaries were made in the past. It's not widely known that today's documentaries have changed. Many top directors have been experimenting with this medium, and they're revolutionizing it. Here, Lee has made a very personal film, and we get to know each participant as the person they were at the time and the person they are now.We do so mostly through interviews. Lee talks to one person at a time, and frames them in such closeup, the tops of their heads are frequently cut from the shot. It's very intimate. As you get to know each person, you feel as if you can reach out and feel the sorrow they endured. This is not a sorrowful film, however. The tone is nostalgic, as each person wistfully remembers something different about their deceased daughter, sister, or friend. As they say, time heals all wounds, and these families have had 24 years to grieve. They cherish the memories they have, and they want to share them with us. I don't really know why Lee interviewed Bill Cosby (he doesn't say much that any of us couldn't have said), but the rest of his choices (including Wallace) are impeccable. We listen to the deep sadness of Chris McNair (father of Denise) remembering Denise's first encounter with racism, or the resigned grace of Alpha Robertson (mother of Carole) renouncing any hatred of the man who killed her daughter, and we may wonder if we would have the strength to endure what they did. And such activists as Andrew Young and Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth are living history texts illuminating the fear and loathing (and hope) of the era.As we learn about the girls, we also learn about the events that led to the bombing. These events are critical in understanding why the church was bombed and in realizing the girls did not die in vain. They died tragically and senselessly, but their deaths were a wake-up call to America. They became martyrs.

It was being screened as part of Black History month, which is in October here in the UK. It's a powerful piece of filmmaking. The movie had barely started and I was already feeling its power. The scenes of the brutality and injustice that black people had to endure during the civil rights movement, combined with the mournful voice of Joan Baez singing ""Birmingham Sunday"" were just too much. The tears came easily. I immediately knew I just have to have it on DVD.Spike Lee earned an Oscar nomination for this documentary in 1997. I think he should have won, (the statue went to Mark Jonathan Harris's ""The Long Way Home""), as I think this is possibly one of the most significant movies he's ever made. He surprises by avoiding the firebrand rhetoric he is known for and he tells this story of how four young African American girls were murdered by white supremacist bombers back in 1963, without voice-over narration, opting instead for the story to be told by those who were there; namely the girls' friends and families, and civil rights activists who were in Birmingham at the time.Using these interviews, some of which are joyful (those who prefer to remember the girls the way they lived), some which are excruciatingly painful (those still grieving for their loss) and some of which verge on the ridiculous (namely, that of former Alabama Governor George Wallace - you have to see it to believe it) and interlacing them with archive footage, Lee firmly establishes the segregational fervour and hysteria that existed in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. The bomb went off on September 15th of that year and we are given a run up of the significant events that preceded the act and the devastating consequences that followed it. It is made very clear how Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Carole Rosamund Robertson died and while it is made equally clear (by the comments from Bill Cosby, for instance), how the world is a much poorer place without them. More significantly - although this will probably never give the girls' families and friends any solace - it is strongly suggested that their deaths acted as the catalyst that led to the upward surge of the civil rights movement in the south, the black vote and the end of segregation.

One mother even admitted that she doesn't even harbor any hate anymore and has resigned herself to the fact that that would simply not do any good at this point; at the same time this is something that she STILL has to work on daily through the grace of her religious convictions.An even more chilling scene was where George Wallace, segregationist EXTRAORDINAIRE who supposedly modified his beliefs in his later years, was insisting that he and this black man were and always had been the best of friends!!!...it is obvious to the naked black eye, that the man in question most certainly did NOT think that but knew it best to let senile old George Wallace believe that if he must.

It was first broadcast nationwide on Home Box Office. It is a remarkably clear-eyed telling of an incendiary tale--how four young black girls, ages 11 to 14, were killed in a 1963 bombing in Birmingham, Alabama.I hesitate to compare 4 Little Girls to Schindler's List, and yet it has that same quality of being a restrained, dignified recounting of an emotional incident. Spike Lee had been wanting to tell this story since before he became a noted filmmaker, and Lee brings all of his remarkable talents to bear. The movie is not flashy, just quietly gripping.Lee frames the incident within the bigger picture of the Southern civil rights movement, particularly as it took place within an inflamed Birmingham. We see the town's police commissioner, Bull Connor--described by one interviewee as &quot;the dark spirit of Birmingham&quot;--keeping order in town while driving a tank painted white, an image that is sure to bring gasps to those who aren't familiar with the full story (which, I humbly admit, included me). And we see a repentant Gov. George Wallace, dragging a reluctant black colleague on camera so that Wallace can introduce him as &quot;my best friend in the world.&quot; (Notably, the &quot;friend&quot; looks quite unconvinced.)It is that Wallace footage that might seem the most showy in a documentary otherwise bereft of editorializing. But it seems right to include the footage after seeing how the segregationist tactics of Wallace and others led indirectly to the deaths of Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins, and Cynthia Wesley. Using little more than home movies and interviews with surviving family members, Lee brings the dead girls back to life and shows us that, when racial stereotypes are accepted and even honored, individual tragedies are the result.Mostly, the story is told through simple, heartbreaking facts. Chris McNair tells us of the day he had to explain to his daughter Denise how she was taken by the aroma of a cooking hamburger at a lunch counter but could not eat there because she was black. And the film comes full circle by pointing out the inexplicable resurgence of black church bombings in the 1990's.Most of the victims' relatives, understandably, become quite emotional on-camera. It can't have been easy to reopen these old wounds, but 4 Little Girls makes you grateful that they endured their pain to do it. I only wish the movie had been up for Best Picture, as it is worth a dozen L.A.

I was recently at the 16th Street Baptist Church where Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole and Denise died. I also spent time across the street in Kelly Ingram Park which is a memorial to the battle for freedom the schoolchildren and adults of Birmingham fought through.  In the middle of that park are four reflecting pools that I think symbolize the lives of the four girls depicted in Spike Lee's documentary.  There are also four pillars with broken tops - one for each of those young lives.  I saw parts of Birmingham that I visited in this movie and it was chilling knowing I'd stood there weeks earlier, and that those girls must have walked through that same park on their way to church.  The only consolation in the face of such tragedy is that those girls have long been happy in the presence of God while we're still here trying to make sense of hatred so strong it would celebrate killing children...

So often in documenteries during the time of the civil rights movement you hear this story ""BRIEFLY"". 4 little girls went to Sunday School...and suddenly the church is bombed. But this film gives the viewer a closer look at who these 4 little girls were, their parents, & siblings & neighborhood friends share memories of these young ladies with the viewer. And that is the LIGHT in this film.The DARK side to this film is when you learn a BOMB has went off inside the church. You learn that the girls was in the basement of the church or close to where this bomb goes off at. And when the images, of those gilrs bodies later flash across that TV screen it paints the UGLY FACE of just how EVIL the SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE (& KKK) were during this time particular time period. It emotionally UPSETS you to see the damage to these girls bodies after that bombing.The worse part about most of the cases in the south where civil rights activists or innocent people and children were killed was that none of these MURDERERS were brought to JUSTICE (JAILED for MURDER) because the ""all WHITE"" Jury always found them ""NOT GUILTY"", or would dismiss all the charges. The judges were white, the jury was always ""all white"". The police department was always all ""WHITE"". Now fast foward to more recent times or say the 1990's, most of these same EVIL, KKK white people are now DEAD or EXTREMEMLY OLD. But in some cases they were re trialed (anyway) & sentenced these same murderers to a sentence they should have been sentenced to back when they commited these terrible crimes in the 50's & 60's. But they are so old that they'd DIE shortly after the new sentence. All those years they were FREE & should have been locked up or even sentenced to the electric chair.What gives any person the RIGHT to kill anybody? Just shoot them like dogs in the street, or hang them from trees, or burn/bomb their houses & churches- Simply because they just want to be treated equally like the ""human beings"" they are?

I have always felt that the turning point was when the Black population realized that they grossly outnumbered the Whites and capitalized on naive but touching events like Rosa Parks' story to exercise their economic power. Certainly the story of Emmitt Till and the subsequent publication of his open coffin funeral in The Chicago Defender, the nation's most important Black newspaper at the time.Since this time, Blacks have demonstrated their power in numbers, won the Civil Rights Act (ironically signed by Texan President Lyndon Johnson) and saw the Delta economy shift away from Agriculture with the arrival of the cotton picking machine, and economically to Tunica MS (the third most popular gambling destination in America)leaving the Blacks who won the civil right movement to work as dealers, maids and fish cleaners on the Catfish farms which dot the southern delta. The political gains (as with rights granted during Reconstruction) lost to mechanization, share cropping and the recommendations of government committees studying ""the Negro Problem"" and never speaking to one. Why Clinton is so respected by Blacks escapes me. As late as 1999, the president was from Arkansas, the vice president from Tennessee and the speaker of the house from Mississippi. Civil rights and Delta Blacks had lost their economic power after sacreficing these 4 Little Girls, Emmitt Till and so many lynching victim, free but living in poverty in a land where they grossly out-number the While population. It's a story worth studying and this is a video worth watching along with the stories of Rosa Parks, Emmitt Till, and Miss Evers Boys. Think it through; it's not changed much since those days. The Delta goes on forever; it gives new meaning to ""You Can Run But You Can't Hide.""In its wake, it has given us John Lee Hooker, Sam Cooke, David Ruffin, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Muddy Waters, Pine Top Perkins, Al Green (from Arkansas), Robert Johnson, James Cotton, Robert Lockwood, Jr, Rev.
