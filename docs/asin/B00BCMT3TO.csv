I read all the customer reviews, and it appeared the entertaining pilot for the show, Powderkeg, wasn't part of the package. A major gaffe by whoever put this product out as that would have been icing on the cake. I had fond memories of watching the pilot as a 12-year-old and recognizing Thunderball Bond girl Luciana Paluzzi among the cast. Man, she was a knockout (and probably still is), and she really added to the show's prestige in my book. Some good observations by other reviews can be read in this forum, so there's little need for me to add upon what generally has come across as customer satisfaction for this three-disc set.

1625575,AI1QOZ8AMDR3Q,B00BCMT3TO,Bruce Burke,"[2, 2]","***IMPORTANT NEW INFO ADDED FOR MY REVIEW*** -- I must apologize for the lack of one important fact I did not make clear:  The PILOT for this series is called ""POWDERKEG"" AND IT DEFINITELY DOES NOT COME WITH THIS SET due to the different ownership video rights at this time. The ""Powderkeg "" Pilot is available on DVD separately and there was a 4th slot in this case and when we watched it, we accidently put the pilot in this same case with the 3 released discs for this set instead of in the Pilot's separate case. So I'am really sorry I did not remember this Pilot was not included.  As I aforementioned, the Pilot Powderkeg is available on disc separately. The disc will say remastered, however it is definitely of Tape transfer quality and not perfectly remastered new like these 3 discs in the episodes set. This series set is perfect and contains all 13 Hour broadcasted episodes. The separate Pilot, even though not of the same quality is a must buy for this series-it really is a good film with guest star Fernando Lamas-so buy the Pilot separately.  I really like this show even better now than when it was first on the air on CBS in the 1970's.  Rod Taylor and Dennis Cole are great together. It was unfortunate that it was only on for half of one season with 13 series episodes & a Movie Pilot-( Pilot not included in this set). At the time critics constantly said the Stuz Bearcat Car was the star of the show. That was not entirely true. Most of the stories were very good as well as the acting of the regulars and very good guest stars. The car made it interesting and accented the time frame of the stories filmed. It was suggested then also at that time, it may have become CBS-Tv's  answer for a similar series comparison to ""The Wild, Wild West"" and  many fans were disillusioned to that series' cancellation.  Anyway this is a short 3 disc set. All the 13 hour long episodes are remastered like new.  For the price, I highly recommend this set for the escapism/fun from 1970's tv . If you buy the Pilot ""Powderkeg"" separately, even though remastered, it looks like from tape stock-it won't be of the same quality as these episodes, but it is still good enough quality to watch-it is the only version available at this time, and that also is a very good movie.",5,Bearcats-Complete Series DVD Set-*Important New Info Added*,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2279,"['***IMPORTANT', 'NEW', 'INFO', 'ADDED', 'FOR', 'MY', 'REVIEW***', 'must', 'apologize', 'lack', 'one', 'important', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'clear', 'PILOT', 'series', 'called', 'POWDERKEG', 'IT', 'DEFINITELY', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'COME', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'SET', 'due', 'different', 'ownership', 'video', 'rights', 'time', 'Powderkeg', 'Pilot', 'available', 'DVD', 'separately', 'there', 'was', '4th', 'slot', 'case', 'when', 'watched', 'accidently', 'put', 'pilot', 'same', 'case', '3', 'released', 'discs', 'set', 'instead', 'Pilot', 'separate', 'case', ""I'am"", 'really', 'sorry', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'Pilot', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'aforementioned', 'Pilot', 'Powderkeg', 'available', 'disc', 'separately', 'disc', 'will', 'say', 'remastered', 'however', 'definitely', 'Tape', 'transfer', 'quality', 'not', 'perfectly', 'remastered', 'new', '3', 'discs', 'episodes', 'set', 'series', 'set', 'perfect', '13', 'Hour', 'broadcasted', 'episodes', 'separate', 'Pilot', 'even', 'not', 'same', 'quality', 'must', 'buy', 'series-it', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'guest', 'star', 'Fernando', 'Lamas-so', 'buy', 'Pilot', 'separately', 'really', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'now', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'air', 'CBS', '1970', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'Dennis', 'Cole', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'only', 'half', 'one', 'season', '13', 'series', 'episodes', 'Movie', 'Pilot-', 'Pilot', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'time', 'critics', 'constantly', 'said', 'Stuz', 'Bearcat', 'Car', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'Most', 'stories', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'regulars', 'very', 'good', 'guest', 'stars', 'car', 'made', 'interesting', 'accented', 'time', 'frame', 'stories', 'filmed', 'was', 'suggested', 'then', 'also', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'CBS-Tv', 'answer', 'similar', 'series', 'comparison', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'disillusioned', 'series', 'cancellation', 'Anyway', 'short', '3', 'disc', 'set', '13', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes', 'are', 'remastered', 'new', 'price', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'escapism/fun', '1970', 'tv', 'buy', 'Pilot', 'Powderkeg', 'separately', 'even', 'remastered', 'tape', 'stock-it', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'quality', 'episodes', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'quality', 'watch-it', 'only', 'version', 'available', 'time', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",Bearcats!

I have always been a fan of Rod Taylor, he brings his trademark charm and style to anything he does. Dennis Cole as his young sidekick aids in the heavy action parts and the chemistry between them is good. Powderkeg which is not included with this dvd set started off the series with a decent story and budget, much like another great action movie called The Professionals, with Lee Marvin and Burt Lancaster. The series however falls short of the movie, it was a good idea and still is, that given a longer run might of produced better stories.

1625583,A3FNITVBF7GWZK,B00BCMT3TO,H. Keller,"[11, 11]","If you remember this series, it probably isn't because you hate it - you probably recall it because you loved it. It had likable characters, action-packed (if not always logical) scripts, minimalist settings (the great Southwest), and it was set in pre-Vietnam, Pre-World War Two, pre-World War One America when high tech was a motorcar and a machine gun - where a crafty plan could outsmart evil doers every week.Over the years I taped the pilot, ""Powderkeg"" off TV, then bought it on VHS (terrible quality, but all there was), later on DVD (an awful transfer that suggested a version recorded on the VHS slow speed was simply moved to the DVD), and a year or so back the complete series set (I think) by EMT from Amazon. This set was an improvement in quality, but while the images didn't seem to bleed color, they were a bit soft.I received the new Shout Factory! version yesterday and watched two eps last night. Though not a Blu-Ray disc, I used a Blu-Ray player and ran it to an HDTV. I was stunned at the quality. You can see metal fatigue in equipment, long use wear in leather holsters, and an amazing level of texture in clothing. Wow.

1625584,A34UX3N0AO73CK,B00BCMT3TO,HollyNYC,"[3, 3]","If you were a fan of TV action adventure shows in the early 1970s, there's a good chance you may have been a fan of ""Bearcats!"" a short-lived yet memorable CBS series from the fall of 1971. The show starred Rod Taylor and Dennis Cole as Hank Brackett and Johnny Reach, two soldiers of fortune who drive around the American southwest in 1914 in their Stutz Bearcat! The basic premise of the show was that Brackett and Reach would only take on ""impossible"" jobs; their fee a signed blank check with the amount filled in once the job was completed. If you could put a price tag on it, you didn't need them. They were sort of a Wilsonian-era ""A Team.""It was an intriguing premise, one that would seem to offer a world of potential story-lines. However, most of the episodes pivoted around one of three plot devices: Villainous German agents up to World War I style intrigue (even though America hadn't even entered the war yet), villains who got their hands on a major piece of dangerous military weaponry, or villains who would take innocent people hostage (sometimes individually, sometimes collectively) as part of a wider scheme. Each episode climaxes with Hackett and Breach riding in to the rescue, guns blazing and music blaring on the soundtrack.Especially by today's standards of TV storytelling, the stories are often paper thin, and most episodes contain obvious filler material to stretch the show out to fill approximately 48 minutes or so of TV time. To be sure, the scripts got better as the series went along.Several of the episodes touch on moral and ethical concerns, such as a town that engaged in mob-style justice or a law-and-order judge who finds the tables turned. Issues which were prevalent at the time are also touched on, if sometimes obliquely, such as Vietnam and Native American rights. One episode features a Che Guevara-style figure.Also noteworthy is how  the directors and cinematographers who worked on the show made great use of the wide-open vistas and classic Western scenery provided by filming the show in the Arizona desert. Most episodes feature several panning and tracking shots, including aerial shots, that are cinematic in scope. Small wonder one or two of the directors who worked on the show, including Richard Donner, went on to have feature film careers. The action sequences are also first-rate, and are often of a scope not normally found on network TV, especially of that era. At times the show even shows influences of ""revisionist"" Western directors such as Sergio Leone and Sam Peckenpah (without, of course, the graphic violence they were know for, while ""Bearcats!"" does try to push some boundaries, it is still a primetime network show).Rod Taylor, a movie star who's work spanned  Disney comedies (""101 Dalmatians"") classic science fiction (""The Time Machine""), Hitchcock horror (""The Birds"") and classic action adventure  (""Dark of the Sun"") successfully transfers his skills and charisma to the small screen, and elevates every scene he's in. Dennis Cole has a charming screen presence and handles the physical  requirements of his role well, but his acting range is, as they say, limited. Typically the villains are played by the stock company of actors who made a living guest-starring on TV shows in the q970s -- John Vernon, Leslie Nielsen, Keenan Wynn, William Smith.This Timeless Media Group DVD does not contain the series' pilot movie, ""Powderkeg,"" presumably  because of rights issues. There are no extra features, which is fine with me, I rarely watch them anyway. The picture quality is generally fine, occasionally, especially in bright-lit outdoor shots, the film does show its age. The audio quality is excellent, which I  have found is not always the case with DVD offerings of TV shows fromn the 1960s and 1970s.Best episodes: ""The Devil Wears Armor,"" ""Bitter Flats,"" ""The Feathered Serpent,"" ""The Hostage,"" ""Assault on San Saba.""Recommended for: Fans of action adventure TV shows from the 1960s and 70s, especially westerns or quasi-westerns, which deliver hours of honest escapist entertainment.",4,Stutz 'R Us,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,4073,"['were', 'fan', 'TV', 'action', 'adventure', 'early', '1970s', 'good', 'chance', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Bearcats', 'short-lived', 'yet', 'memorable', 'CBS', 'series', 'fall', '1971', 'show', 'starred', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'Dennis', 'Cole', 'Hank', 'Brackett', 'Johnny', 'Reach', 'two', 'soldiers', 'fortune', 'who', 'drive', 'American', 'southwest', '1914', 'Stutz', 'Bearcat', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'was', 'Brackett', 'Reach', 'would', 'only', 'take', 'impossible', 'jobs', 'fee', 'signed', 'blank', 'check', 'amount', 'filled', 'once', 'job', 'was', 'completed', 'could', 'put', 'price', 'tag', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'were', 'sort', 'Wilsonian-era', 'Team', 'was', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'one', 'would', 'seem', 'offer', 'world', 'potential', 'story-lines', 'However', 'most', 'episodes', 'pivoted', 'one', 'three', 'plot', 'devices', 'Villainous', 'German', 'World', 'War', 'style', 'intrigue', 'even', 'America', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'entered', 'war', 'yet', 'villains', 'who', 'got', 'hands', 'major', 'piece', 'dangerous', 'military', 'weaponry', 'villains', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'innocent', 'people', 'hostage', 'sometimes', 'individually', 'sometimes', 'collectively', 'part', 'wider', 'scheme', 'episode', 'climaxes', 'Hackett', 'Breach', 'riding', 'rescue', 'guns', 'blazing', 'music', 'blaring', 'soundtrack.Especially', 'today', 'standards', 'TV', 'storytelling', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'paper', 'thin', 'most', 'episodes', 'contain', 'obvious', 'filler', 'material', 'stretch', 'show', 'fill', 'approximately', '48', 'minutes', 'so', 'TV', 'time', 'be', 'sure', 'scripts', 'got', 'better', 'series', 'went', 'along.Several', 'episodes', 'touch', 'moral', 'ethical', 'concerns', 'such', 'town', 'engaged', 'mob-style', 'justice', 'law-and-order', 'judge', 'who', 'tables', 'turned', 'Issues', 'were', 'prevalent', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'touched', 'sometimes', 'obliquely', 'such', 'Vietnam', 'Native', 'American', 'rights', 'One', 'episode', 'Che', 'Guevara-style', 'figure.Also', 'noteworthy', 'how', 'directors', 'cinematographers', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'made', 'great', 'use', 'wide-open', 'vistas', 'classic', 'Western', 'scenery', 'provided', 'filming', 'show', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'Most', 'episodes', 'feature', 'several', 'panning', 'tracking', 'shots', 'including', 'aerial', 'shots', 'are', 'cinematic', 'scope', 'Small', 'wonder', 'one', 'two', 'directors', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'including', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'went', 'have', 'feature', 'film', 'careers', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'first-rate', 'are', 'often', 'scope', 'not', 'normally', 'found', 'network', 'TV', 'especially', 'era', 'times', 'show', 'even', 'influences', 'revisionist', 'Western', 'directors', 'such', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Sam', 'Peckenpah', 'course', 'graphic', 'violence', 'were', 'know', 'Bearcats', 'try', 'push', 'boundaries', 'still', 'primetime', 'network', 'show', '.Rod', 'Taylor', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'work', 'spanned', 'Disney', 'comedies', '101', 'Dalmatians', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Hitchcock', 'horror', 'Birds', 'classic', 'action', 'adventure', 'Dark', 'Sun', 'successfully', 'skills', 'charisma', 'small', 'screen', 'scene', 'Dennis', 'Cole', 'charming', 'screen', 'presence', 'physical', 'requirements', 'role', 'well', 'acting', 'range', 'say', 'limited', 'Typically', 'villains', 'are', 'played', 'stock', 'company', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'living', 'guest-starring', 'TV', 'shows', 'q970s', 'John', 'Vernon', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'William', 'Smith.This', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'DVD', 'not', 'contain', 'series', 'pilot', 'movie', 'Powderkeg', 'presumably', 'rights', 'issues', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'fine', 'rarely', 'watch', 'anyway', 'picture', 'quality', 'generally', 'fine', 'occasionally', 'especially', 'bright-lit', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'film', 'show', 'age', 'audio', 'quality', 'excellent', 'have', 'found', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'DVD', 'offerings', 'TV', 'shows', 'fromn', '1960s', '1970s.Best', 'episodes', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Armor', 'Bitter', 'Flats', 'Feathered', 'Serpent', 'Hostage', 'Assault', 'San', 'Saba', 'Recommended', 'Fans', 'action', 'adventure', 'TV', 'shows', '1960s', '70s', 'especially', 'quasi-westerns', 'deliver', 'hours', 'honest', 'escapist', 'entertainment']",Bearcats!

Filmed on location with high production values, a excellent cast and guest stars, it was everything a car crazy kid could have asked for.Rod Taylor and Dennis Cole manage to inject a bit of humor into many of the episodes without ever crossing the line into campiness.Yes, a couple of episodes have holes in their plots big enough to drive a Stutz Bearcat through...but it's easy to forgive them and just enjoy the action and interplay between the stars.The car itself is a joy to look at. Famed Hollywood car customizer-builder George Barris made two for the series and they certainly look the part...he had a  real '14 Bearcat to model them on. They have hand formed metal bodies on custom chassis and are powered by 60s Ford powertrains. The first car built (and the one used in most of the filming) had a 4 speed (you can see the gear shift lever in many shots), the second had an automatic transmission. Happily, both survive...the one has lived in my garage for the last 15 years.The quality of the DVD transfer is outstanding, with excellent picture and sound.It's great fun and a great value...enjoy.",5,A fun series and excellent quality,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1219,"['Bearcats', 'one', 'programs', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'anymore', 'family', 'friendly', 'action', 'adventure', 'show', 'Filmed', 'location', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'cast', 'guest', 'stars', 'was', 'everything', 'car', 'crazy', 'kid', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'for.Rod', 'Taylor', 'Dennis', 'Cole', 'manage', 'inject', 'bit', 'humor', 'many', 'episodes', 'ever', 'crossing', 'line', 'campiness.Yes', 'couple', 'episodes', 'have', 'holes', 'plots', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'Stutz', 'Bearcat', 'easy', 'forgive', 'just', 'enjoy', 'action', 'interplay', 'stars.The', 'car', 'joy', 'look', 'Famed', 'Hollywood', 'car', 'customizer-builder', 'George', 'Barris', 'made', 'two', 'series', 'certainly', 'look', 'part', 'had', 'real', ""'14"", 'Bearcat', 'model', 'have', 'hand', 'formed', 'metal', 'bodies', 'custom', 'chassis', 'are', 'powered', '60s', 'Ford', 'powertrains', 'first', 'car', 'built', 'one', 'used', 'most', 'filming', 'had', '4', 'speed', 'can', 'see', 'gear', 'shift', 'lever', 'many', 'shots', 'second', 'had', 'automatic', 'transmission', 'Happily', 'survive', 'one', 'lived', 'garage', 'last', '15', 'years.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'outstanding', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sound.It', 'great', 'fun', 'great', 'value', 'enjoy']",Bearcats!

Stuff you could watch with grandma, the kids, the grandkids, etc.  These days, it's not so easy to find, especially if you have tastes that run conservative in any direction. Unless you delve into reruns from the aforementioned era.The release of ""Bearcats!"" lets you have it all: classic reruns from that bygone age, and newness (while a few of us may remember this series, nobody remembers the episodes).Like ""Gilligan's Island,"" it's fun escapism for all ages, not intended for much scrutiny (such as ""Where do our heroes get gasoline for their car, out in the middle of the desert? Why are there so many level (and even PAVED) roadways in an age with so few horseless carriages...in a desert?  Why is there so much post-1914 technology in a series set in 1914?"").In that context, the acting's good and, when mixed with strong writing in this genre, it makes for some suspense and some well executed humor.I was four years old when this series first aired and I loved it.  All these years later, I'd say it holds up well for adult viewing. I still enjoy it, now with my daughter.

The problem which is highlighted in the comments and responses to another reviewer is that it is unclear that this version includes the pilot, which is called ""Powder Keg.""  According to one source, copyright to the pilot and series are held by different sources and getting the rights to one does not mean getting the rights to both.I hope the pilot is included since it was one of the best episodes with Fernando Lamas as the villain.  I have however noted that Amazon.com sells a collection called 20 Great Westerns which lists Powder Keg as one of the movies that it includes and this collection is very inexpensive.  It is the right year and the right actors so it is THAT Powder Keg. So if the series does not include the pilot, I will buy the 20 Great Western collections and get it that way.
