311100,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,6302413508,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 1]","I haven't looked at any reviews dating from when this movie was first released, but I suspect that this was a prestige stage adaptation that fizzled at the box office. It also probably gave MGM yet another reason to jettison Joan Crawford from the prestigious gate.The premise of this one is pretty simple. Susan (Crawford) and Barry(Fredrick March) aren't even trying to maintain the external appearance that their marriage is good. Still circumstance reunites them with their only child teen daughter Blossom(Rita Quigley) while Susan is just itching to rid herself of Barry and move on to her latest passion religion. In what I can only describe as an over-the-top performance, self absorbed Susan immerses herself in evangelical fervor much to the consternation of her high society friends while she pushes her husband away as he tries to make amends for his own pathetic drunken behavior of the past and tries to provide Blossom with a sense of family. Susan is full of love of God and the larger scheme of things as she nervously goes through the process of eternal salvation, but remarkably disconnects from the fact that her husband and daughter need her to step up and notice them and become a wife and mother first.The thing that seemingly hurts this movie the most is the obvious fact that it drags on interminably to get to a point of resolution. Strange because George Cukor is normally a great director who does wonders with stage adaptations. While the cast is populated with good actors, the pace really starts to slow down by the time it is halfway over. Crawford mugs it up and is a hyperactive mess through most of it as she goes through her spiritual evolution. Her performance is awkward and strange and very campy. March is good as Barry, a randy guy who has seen the error of his ways and is making a serious attempt to turn things around. Quigley is very good as an awkward teen who just wants to fit in and desperately needs maternal guidance from Susan.I find this movie interesting, but I suspect a lot of viewers would probably be bored by the machinations of Susan. It's the banter of her doubting and skeptical friends that add an extra layer of interest to the whole premise of this movie and provide the laughs.",4,I Like It For Its Campy Treatment,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2243,"['have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'reviews', 'dating', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'suspect', 'was', 'prestige', 'stage', 'adaptation', 'fizzled', 'box', 'office', 'also', 'probably', 'gave', 'MGM', 'yet', 'reason', 'jettison', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'prestigious', 'gate.The', 'premise', 'one', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Susan', 'Crawford', 'Barry', 'Fredrick', 'March', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'maintain', 'external', 'appearance', 'marriage', 'good', 'Still', 'circumstance', 'only', 'child', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Blossom', 'Rita', 'Quigley', 'Susan', 'just', 'itching', 'rid', 'herself', 'Barry', 'move', 'latest', 'passion', 'religion', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'absorbed', 'Susan', 'immerses', 'evangelical', 'fervor', 'much', 'consternation', 'high', 'society', 'friends', 'husband', 'away', 'make', 'amends', 'own', 'pathetic', 'drunken', 'behavior', 'past', 'tries', 'provide', 'Blossom', 'sense', 'family', 'Susan', 'full', 'love', 'God', 'larger', 'scheme', 'things', 'nervously', 'process', 'eternal', 'salvation', 'remarkably', 'disconnects', 'fact', 'husband', 'daughter', 'need', 'step', 'up', 'notice', 'become', 'wife', 'mother', 'first.The', 'thing', 'seemingly', 'movie', 'most', 'obvious', 'fact', 'interminably', 'get', 'point', 'resolution', 'Strange', 'George', 'Cukor', 'normally', 'great', 'director', 'who', 'wonders', 'stage', 'adaptations', 'cast', 'populated', 'good', 'actors', 'pace', 'really', 'slow', 'down', 'time', 'halfway', 'Crawford', 'up', 'hyperactive', 'mess', 'most', 'spiritual', 'evolution', 'performance', 'awkward', 'strange', 'very', 'campy', 'March', 'good', 'Barry', 'randy', 'guy', 'who', 'seen', 'error', 'ways', 'making', 'serious', 'attempt', 'turn', 'things', 'Quigley', 'very', 'good', 'awkward', 'teen', 'who', 'just', 'fit', 'desperately', 'maternal', 'guidance', 'Susan.I', 'find', 'movie', 'interesting', 'suspect', 'lot', 'viewers', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'bored', 'machinations', 'Susan', 'banter', 'doubting', 'skeptical', 'friends', 'add', 'extra', 'layer', 'interest', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'provide', 'laughs']",N/A

I hate it when Joan's in a movie and she's not the center of attention and she's almost just there to liven things up and capture an audience. Even though the story was built around her character it seemed like she was missing in action for most of the movie (in both mind, body and spirit.) My favorite scene was towards the beginning when Susan made her grand entrance on the speed boat. This movie reminded me of ""When Ladies Meet"" which is another one that I'm not too crazy about. Excepts for perhaps ""Strange Cargo"" most of her later MGM pictures weren't nearly as good as the ones she made after or before them.

311103,A207IYGZTAF0DS,6302413508,NoWireHangers,"[3, 3]","In ""Susan and God"", Joan Crawford plays Susan Trexel, a wealthy socialite who returns home from Europe, not to her husband, whom she wants to divorce, but to her friends, eager to tell them about her religious awakening. She's full of love for other people, she says, but it's obvious to everyone (except herself) that she's still extremely self absorbed. Her religious fervour seems to be a new way to become the center of everyone's attention. She's not really interested in trying to save her marriage or to devote any time to the daughter she hasn't seen in a long time.While Susan is the center of the story and the most influential person in the lives of the people around her, we don't get to meet her until after we've been introduced to just about everybody else, including her long-suffering alcoholic husband Barrie (Fredric March) and her neglected daughter, Blossom (Rita Quigley), and they're the ones we really get to care about, as we realize their happiness depends on whether Susan will undergo some real (as opposed to her present self-righteous) personal transformation or not. Everybody in the cast do a great job. Crawford is a bit theatrical in the way we (or at least I) like about her, and March and Quigley are very likable.

311104,A3KJ9UTP3TSDJW,6302413508,"Professor Emeritus P. Bagnolo ""Slugger/BIGGUY""","[4, 5]","This is one of the ""Archived Warner Brothers Collections"" films pressed into a DVD format.Without giving, away too much, Joan Crawford as Susan Trexel, is a rich, spoiled, sort of a ditz-brained ""eccentric."" She is stricken quite suddenly with having `seen the light,' so off she goes into a religious conversion, into which she drags her entire entourage, husband, child, friends and acquaintances, imposing upon them a life altering experience. However, hold on, this is not St. Paul Struck from his horse by the thunder of God; it is scatterbrain Susan, off on only the latest of her romps. Her much suffering (from neglect) husband, friends and their loves, affairs, what have you, is also massively to minutely affect by her peccadillo `le choix du jour'.Crawford coveted this role and she put her career on the line, as, as many men and women of talent in the old studio days did, she blurted out to Warner, ""I'd play Wally Beery's grandmother if it's a good part.""WB, took her at her word and handed her a witty, dramatic part, with a superb cast: Fredric March, Ruth Hussey, John Carroll, Nigel Bruce, and the very young `Rita Hayworth.' Crawford thus battled her way into a part made famous by Gertrude Lawrence on Broadway, a very brave, and calculated move on Crawford's part. One misstep by Crawford under the stress of competing with the flawless handling of Susan Trexel's persona (by Gertrude Lawrence) would most likely doom her own career.However, it appeared that Warner Brothers believed in Crawford, because they backed her up with a strong investment, great supporting actors, a great director- George Cukor, with screenplay by Anita Loos, from the Play by Rachel Crothers, which paid off nicely and lifted her from the sleazy shop-girl, chorus girl parts in which they continued to cast her, into true stardom. I saw this film as a kid at a local theater, which in summer often played old film classics.Crawford (real name Lucille Fay LeSueur on March 23, 1905 in San Antonio) followed this film with most of her very best parts in movies like; A Woman's Face (1941) as Anna Holm, When Ladies Meet (1941) as Mary 'Minnie' Howard, They All Kissed the Bride (1942) as Margaret J. 'MR.' Drew, Reunion in France (1942), as Michelle 'Mike' de la Becque, Above Suspicion (1943), as Frances Myles, Mildred Pierce (1945), as Mildred Pierce Beragon, Humoresque (1946), as Mrs. Helen Wright, Possessed (1947) as Louise Howell, Daisy Kenyon (1947),  as Daisy Kenyon, Flamingo Road (1949),  as Lane Bellamy, The Damned Don't Cry (1950), as Ethel Whitehead, Harriet Craig (1950), as  Harriet Craig, Goodbye, My Fancy (1951) as Agatha Reed, This Woman Is Dangerous (1952) as Elizabeth 'Beth' Austin.Crawford and Warner both profited well from her rebellion from the studio game of type casting purgatory. It is a witty, sometimes serious movie and Crawford does well in a role a bit apart from her previous studio contrived pattern.Marketing Prediction!The only misgiving I have about Warner Brothers marketing this series of old films at $25-$29 each (and some pot boiler B movies, labeling them as ""Classics"" which some of them, are quite definitely NOT), is that whomever now has the Warner Copyrights for these older films, is vastly overcharging for these conversions to the DVD format.

When Crawford is being intellectually frivolous, it's merely tiresome.  The director, George Cukor and the scenarist, Anita Loos, must certainly have been aware of the problem, because Loos supplied some new characters and Cukor lavished affection on the actresses - Marjorie Main and Constance Collier - who played them. Joan plays a woman who finds religion and drives her husband (Frederic March) and friends up the wall with her pious attitudes and newly found graces. Rita Quigley plays her discontented daughter and Marjorie Main steals the show when Susan insists that she (as the housekeeper) refer to her by her first name. Susan enters her summer cottage and asks Main how long ago the new decorating was done. Main replies heartily &quot;About six months ago - SUSAN!!&quot; to a hilariously shocked Joan.

311107,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302413508,Simon Davis,"[5, 6]","The beginning of the 1940's decade saw the start of the &quot;changing of the guard&quot;, at MGM illustrated in the tapering off of the careers of the resident movie queens of MGM from the 1930's, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford. In her own effort to retain her position in the MGM pecking order Joan Crawford, long dissatisfied with many of the scripts handed to her, began to actively seek out more prestigious vehicles for her future starring roles. When Norma Shearer turned down the lead in the highly successful Rachel Crother play &quot;Susan and God&quot; which had been a smash hit on Broadway starring Gertrude Lawrence, fearing to  play the mother of a teenage girl Joan jumped at the chance and turned in one of her most interesting later day MGM performances. Comedy and religion dont normally go together in 1940's comedy and that is what gives this Crawford vehicle it's own unique interest.Featuring the only teaming on screen for Joan Crawford and Fredric March this film has two distinct parts to it with the high comedy prominent in the first half being replaced by a more traditional Crawford type dramatic slant in the second. &quot;Susan and God&quot;, tells the story of society matron Susan Trexel (Joan Crawford) who after an extended trip to Europe arrives back home in a flurry of excitement over her newly discovered religious beliefs which to all her society friends appear to be just the  latest fad embraced by Susan in her normally frivolous existence. Those beliefs based on the idea of a public confession of one's own shortcomings begin however to cause troubles between her jaded society friends and more importantly within her disfunctional home life with husband Barrie (Fredric March) and daughter Blossom (Rita Quigley). Susan's meddling in her friend's married life also causes problems between Hutchie (Nigel Bruce) and his much younger wife Leonora (Rita Hayworth in an early role). Susan  however is no shining example of the advise she so piously dispenses and she experiences a complete estrangement from her normally loving husband who has been driven to drink by her repeated lack of care, and from her daughter who is socially withdrawn and simply wants a loving home environment with both parents. Barrie sees that Susan's religious pontificating is simply another of her wild schemes for attention and like all she does has no sincerity or lasting value below the surface gloss. Being the loving father that he is however Barrie decides to ask Susan for the sake of their daughter to begin a new life together again. Agreed to reluctantly at first by the superficial Susan, as time passes she begins to realise the real damage that she has caused over the years to those closest to her by her self centred attitude. Seeing the real hurt she has been responsible for Susan begins to realise that running away from her responsibilities is not the answer or the way of finding the personal salvation she has been talking so much about. Seeing the total lack of any real love in her immediate family circle Susan does an about face and begins to make a real effort to really practice what she has been preaching so lighly to all and sundry since her return.This most unusual topic of the detrimental effects that religion has on a family was a theme rarely explored in Hollywood at this time and it is a pity that this film, like the celebrated stage play it was based on have been largely forgotten with the passing of time. Directed by veteran George Cukor who always worked well with strong female performers and with Joan in particular as seen in their next film together the classic &quot;A Woman's face&quot;, here he has a difficult task on his hands with an essentially unsympathetic and unlikeable lead female role that somehow must being able to logically reform as the story progresses. It reveals the much larger range that Joan Crawford was rarely allowed to show in her MGM years and her change from shallow society queen out for more attention into a mature and reflective individual thinking of others for the first time really is a stunning showcase for her by now experienced talents. The gifted Fredric  March has the far less colourful role here of the husband who is largely a victim of Susan's latest caprices however being the strong actor he is manages to make something of his weak character who gains inner strength and purpose. Rita Hayworth was beginning to emerge at this time from her years as a &quot;B&quot; movie actress and her scenes reveal the glowing freshness that became so much of her later appeal. Rose Hobart and Ruth Hussey as Susan's friends Charlotte and Irene also make most favourable impressions in their scenes dealing with Susan's latest wild schemes, Hussey in particular excellent in the love scenes she shares with Fredric March.Backed up by the expertise in every department that one comes to expect from MGM this film  nowadays certainly has curiosity value for it's unorthodox subject matter and largely non traditional role undertaken by Joan Crawford. It revealed her talents in full bloom backed up by solid direction and great attention to detail. I recommend this different Crawford vehicle made just prior to the end of her legendary career as a top star at MGM.",4,Joan Crawford In An Enjoyable Non Traditional Role,1065916800,"10 12,

Many actresses were approached about playing Susan such as Norma Shearer and Greer Garson, but the part ultimately went to Crawford.The film deals with a woman whose life is falling to pieces as she is estranged from her husband and has a teenaged daughter that she is finding difficult to get along with. Upon her return from Europe Susan discovers God and is determined to change her life for the better.At first Joan couldn't understand the part and how a woman who had everything would give it all up for the sake of religion. On the movie's very first day of filming director George Cukor took Crawford aside and described the part and how she should play it. It did become one of Joan's favorite films and was proud she starred in it.Rita Hayworth also has a supporting role.",5,"""Not A Bad Crawford Soap Melodrama""",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,939,"['One', 'two', 'superb', 'films', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'would', 'release', '1940', 'Susan', 'God', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'was', 'commercial', 'flop', 'when', 'released', 'theatres', 'Many', 'actresses', 'were', 'approached', 'playing', 'Susan', 'such', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'part', 'ultimately', 'went', 'Crawford.The', 'film', 'deals', 'woman', 'life', 'falling', 'pieces', 'estranged', 'husband', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'finding', 'difficult', 'get', 'return', 'Europe', 'Susan', 'God', 'determined', 'change', 'life', 'better.At', 'first', 'Joan', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'part', 'how', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'everything', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'sake', 'religion', 'movie', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'filming', 'director', 'George', 'Cukor', 'took', 'Crawford', 'aside', 'described', 'part', 'how', 'should', 'play', 'did', 'become', 'one', 'Joan', 'favorite', 'films', 'was', 'proud', 'starred', 'it.Rita', 'Hayworth', 'also', 'supporting', 'role']",N/A
