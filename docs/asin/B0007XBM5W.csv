893298,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B0007XBM5W,,"[3, 3]","Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) must solve the mystery behind events that happened when he was a child in order to save the planet from being destroyed by monsters from another dimension.OK, I'll admit, ""Alone in the Dark"" is not on my best films of all time list, but it's not on my worst films list, either. It may be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all of Boll's other films are like this, then Boll has been grossly underestimated, because I have seen a lot of films that are far worse than this one (for example, ""The Stepford Wives"" remake).The script is based on a video game, which gives it that ""video game"", moving from level to level, feel that you get with a lot of films of this type (such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but that didn't so much put me off the film as make me want to go out and play the game. Not being a gamer, this was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"", and I found the story to be interesting enough to maintain my interest for the duration of the film. The acting is uneven in quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) both turn in decent performances, but Tara Reid is so unconvincing as a scientist that she actually adds to the entertainment value of the film. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are just too long. There is a fight scene at about the 1 hour mark that comprises about 15 minutes of people shooting at monsters with very little dialogue, which became tedious after a while. In spite of that, I still liked the film and would be prepared to watch it again.",2,"Not great, but it could have been a lot worse",1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,1652,"['Former', 'government', 'agent', 'Edward', 'Carnby', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'must', 'solve', 'mystery', 'events', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'order', 'save', 'planet', 'being', 'destroyed', 'monsters', 'dimension.OK', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'not', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'list', 'not', 'worst', 'films', 'list', 'either', 'may', 'be', 'directed', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'who', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'worst', 'director', 'time', 'Boll', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'then', 'Boll', 'been', 'grossly', 'underestimated', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'one', 'example', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'remake', '.The', 'script', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'video', 'game', 'moving', 'level', 'level', 'feel', 'get', 'lot', 'films', 'type', 'such', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Doom', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'film', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'play', 'game', 'Not', 'being', 'gamer', 'was', 'first', 'encounter', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'interesting', 'enough', 'maintain', 'interest', 'duration', 'film', 'acting', 'uneven', 'quality', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'government', 'agent', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'so', 'unconvincing', 'scientist', 'actually', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'main', 'criticism', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'fight', 'scene', '1', 'hour', 'mark', '15', 'minutes', 'people', 'shooting', 'monsters', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'became', 'tedious', 'while', 'spite', 'still', 'liked', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'prepared', 'watch', 'again']",Alone in the Dark

893300,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0007XBM5W,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 4]","Have you ever wondered why most horror films are so awful these days? Let's take a look back into 2005, one of the worst years in the history of cinema. A year in which the majority of the films that came out were really bad. This was one of them and went down as one of the worst horror films of all time (A score of 9 out of 100 on Metacritic), which is ironic because in the same year we saw one of the best horror films ever made, The Descent. Since 2005, Hollywood has not recovered and continues to deliver a lot of awful films. Uwe Boll, I'm willing to defend the House of the Dead film you made, but only because it was so bad it was hilarious. Alone in the Dark on the other hand is one of the worst horror films ever created. This film makes House of the Dead look like a glorious George A. Romero zombie film. Here's what the film is; take Alien, take Resident Evil, and take AVP, butcher the hell out of them, stitch them together and call it Alone in the Dark. It doesn't even have the ""so bad it's good"" vibe going for it. This film easily lands itself a spot in my top five worst films I've ever seen list. Now let's review this horrendous film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: You know the film from the beginning is going to be an atrocious mess when you have to read a long line of text that is narrated to you because test audiences complained they didn't understand the plot (Though I'm pretty sure that wasn't their only complaint). 10,000 years ago, the Abkani people were an advanced race of people who mysteriously disappeared overnight after letting an evil force of mysterious creatures loose. The film's main focus is on Edward Carnby, played by washed up and long-forgotten actor Christian Slater. Edward Carnby had a rough childhood, he grew up in an orphanage and was experimented on by a mysterious organization. Fast forward years later into adulthood, and Edward Carnby is a paranormal investigator who searches for remnants of the lost civilization. The story is also focuses on an archaeologist named Aline Cedrac; played by Tara Reid (The worst actress I've ever seen) who just so happens to be Carnby's ex-girlfriend.  When a mysterious artifact is salvaged from the bottom of the ocean and opened the creatures once again roam the Earth. Now all the children (Who are now adults) who were experimented on at Carnby's orphanage are going missing because they are infected and are becoming the creatures. Now Carnby and Cedrac, with the help of Carnby's rival government agent Richard Burke; played by Stephen Dorff must stop these creatures by means of shooting them in a bunch of lame action scenes and investigate the remnants and artifacts. A series of horribly scripted plot twists occur from then on.MUSIC: This was one of the only redeeming qualities of such a horrendous horror flick. It actually has a nice score to it.ACTING: Oh my God. This film contains some of the worst acting in the history of cinema. Christian Slater's performance is utterly atrocious to watch and plagued by horrifically bad dialogue. Tara Reid's acting is even more appalling. The only thing worse than her acting is her cottage cheese thighs and a$$. Stephen Dorff's acting is slightly better, but that's not exactly saying anything. Most ironic of all, is the fact that two actors from House of the Dead appear in this film despite the overwhelmingly negative reception of the film. That right there seems to suggest that these actors sold their souls to Uwe Boll, there for never earning another role in anything again. If you play in a Uwe Boll film, you're lucky to get a role in a crappy sitcom that won't even last two months on the air. These actors had their careers officially destroyed by this film, and now they will never get a respectable role in anything ever again. No part of the acting is believable and it seemed as if the actors had to improvise at times. It makes the House of the Dead actors worthy of Oscars compared to this.ACTION: If you thought the Matrix-style/martial arts action in House of the Dead was bad, this film makes it look like a brilliantly choreographed action flick. The gore is the only good part of the badly scripted action scenes. The film is loaded with bad camera angles and they obscure the action scenes. Not to mention, most of the action scenes don't even make much sense like the car chase at the beginning of the film. Worst of all, the shooting scenes in the film are boring to watch (How the hell do you accomplish this?). This film also runs into the problem of being too dark to see (Think about the awful AVP: Requiem film, but much worse!). The creature designs look like reject alien creatures from the Alien films. The CGI in this film isn't the worst, but it certainly is bad and poorly done. For an action-horror flick it's really boring and utterly atrocious. Oh, this film is also the 23rd zombie film I've watched because it does feature the zombies, and it's earned the nomination as worst zombie film I've ever seen, on top of being one of the worst films I've ever seen.OVERALL: Don't even think about it. This film is an abomination of man who's only home should be in landfills or your garbage can. This film will die in the bargain bin.THE GOOD: The music and the gore.THE BAD: Everything else.",1,"A DREADFUL, APPALLING, HACKNEYED PIECE OF HORROR FILM CINEMA  1.5 OUT OF 10",1235865600,"03 1,

I have to say though, that if you rank this ""film"" as a comedy, then it deserves 5 stars, sadly, I'm pretty certain that Uwe Boll didn't mean it as such (though i'm sure he would say otherwise). Despite this movie being as bad as it is, I have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that I have ever had, the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad, that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in Mystery Science Theater fashion. The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like  ""don't be insane!"" and virtually every word to come out of Tara Reid's mouth, but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend Marco and literally 5 people, including myself, couldn't resist the urge to yell ""polo"" at the screen. This is one of those movies that's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art (if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is). It amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie, I can't think of a single use for it, though I can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in Sadam Huisein's palace during operation Iraqi freedom, then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that Saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction.",1,I'm confused....,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,1439,"['saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'actually', 'have', 'say', 'rank', 'film', 'comedy', 'then', '5', 'stars', 'sadly', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'certain', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'such', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'say', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'being', 'as', 'bad', 'have', 'say', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'going', 'experiences', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'consesus', 'viewing', 'audience', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'noone', 'minded', 'one', 'bit', 'when', 'everyone', 'theater', 'started', 'heckling', 'out', 'loud', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', 'fashion', 'movie', 'was', 'fool', 'great', 'moments', 'memorable', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'insane', 'virtually', 'word', 'come', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'mouth', 'best', 'part', 'came', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'called', 'out', 'lost', 'friend', 'Marco', 'literally', '5', 'people', 'including', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'urge', 'yell', 'polo', 'screen', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'unbelieveably', 'bad', 'being', 'art', 'consider', 'taking', 'dump', 'puppy', 'artistic', 'expression', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'may', 'actually', 'like', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'use', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'copy', 'film', 'were', 'found', 'Sadam', 'Huisein', 'palace', 'operation', 'Iraqi', 'freedom', 'then', 'certainly', 'going', 'war', 'proof', 'Saddam', 'had', 'least', 'one', 'weapon', 'mass', 'distruction']",Alone in the Dark

893304,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0007XBM5W,Alex Udvary,"[2, 3]","""Alone in the Dark"" is without doubt one of the worst movies of 2005. It is not offensive bad, no racial remarks, no sexist points of view, just pure and simple Hollywood studio system trash. I heard a lot of people say this is a bad movie. The critics bashed it left and right, but, I'm stubborn. I never believe public opinion. I alway think people over do things. They make movies out to be worst than they actually are. Well, for once I agree with the mass majority, ""Alone in the Dark"" is a diaster. But you may ask why? I shall explain.There is a term used by screenwriters known as ""beat"". You may not be familiar with the term, but, trust me you know the device. A beat is that twsit that happens in a movie. It's that big action sequence or the moment when we find out the character's mother is really her sister, or it's that moment when we find out Bruce Willis is really dead. Are you starting to catch on? Screenwriters keep these scenes in so the audience won't get bored. Hollywood seems to believe that an MTV generation has a short attention span, now, maybe they (Or I should say ""we"", I'm 22) do, but the movie is just a big pile of action sequences and no story. Like clockwork every 15 minutes we get a big action scene, the movie even starts off with one. That was my first indication I was in trouble. When a movie starts off with a big action sequence it is a set-up of what to expect; all action , no plot or character development. But it's not just the action scene that bothered me. Going into a movie like this you have to expect that. But, what I didn't expect was the lousy editing, acting, dialogue and directing. The movie tries to be stylish for no reason at all. There is a scene where the camera gets inside opf a gun so we can see a bullet fly out and hit its target. Why was this done? I don't know, maybe director Uwe Boll has watched too many John Woo films. The difference is with Woo the device is used to place importance on the fight scene and create suspense, in ""Alone in the Dark"" it tries to make the movie look ""important"". It's an attempt by the director to say ""Hey look! I'm an artist!"". The movie's editing is so frantic that we can hardly keep an image in our head. Everything is going go so fast, except the time oddly enough, because it felt like this movie was 4 hours!And what about this cast. Granted I'm not a big fan of Christian Slater or Tara Reid or even Stephen Dorff, but, you can't be serious with this fellas. Did any of you really think this was going to turn out to be a good movie. Please tell me you were paid a large sum of money for this. And what about Tara Reid? She has been going through a slump it seems. For a while she was making headline and just as fast she has become a b-list celebrity. Reid plays Aline Cedrae an intelligent scientist. How do I know she's intelligent? Why because she wears glasses of course! That is about the only contribution she makes to this movie. The glasses and the fact that she's the only one with long hair seperate her from everyone else. She has no dialogue, and what ever she does have is no more to 1 line or 2 and what lines! All the dialogue comes off as phony. It's what I call people acting normal trying to act normal. You can't act naturally. Either you are or you aren't. The dialogue and acting reminds us of those 1940, 1950 sci-fi movies. Think along the lines of Ed Wood without the big budget. But, I shouldn't just pick on Reid. It's not only her it's everyone! They are all terrible in this this. We don't sense who any of these people are. Nothing is developed. This is a low-point for everyone involved.How a movie like this got made is beyond me. And people wonder why I stay away from these action pack big budget movies. From now on all I have to say it ""Did you see ""Alone in the Dark""?"" Please I'm warning you stay away from this movie. There are so many better films out there that you could watch. If you like sci-fi movies, hey, that's fine watch ""Alien"", which is kind of what the ""creatures"" look like.

893309,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B0007XBM5W,Arch Stanton,"[1, 2]","Sometimes I wonder if Uwe Boll doesn't secretly have an actual sense of humor. Maybe he's not as bad as he seems to be and is actually playing an elaborate joke on the viewer. I can only hope so because otherwise the guy is nothing but a delusional narcissistic no-talent egomaniac. And God do I  love watching his movies. It's like Ed Wood with a budget. Same ridiculous plots. Same nonsensical lines. Same cliches repeated over and over. Sure, he's no Ed Wood but his films are still funny as hell. So why the one-star? Well honestly that's what it deserves. I don't think that movies should really get credit for being entertaining if they only achieve it by accident. After all, this movie isn't trying to be funny, it's trying to be gloomy and atmospheric. But boy is it fun to watch it fail!Since the fun is in the details the plot description shall be brief. Basically, Christian Slater plays a guy who was one of twenty orphans who were experimented on. Except that he's different of course. Not that it matters. That plot point turns out to be irrelevant despite all the focus they put on it. And if you can't figure out what makes him different by the 40 minute mark then you are as stupid as Boll seems to think you are. Anyways, this experience has made him into a grim and moody man who is always monologing about how dangerous the world is yet tells his entire life's story to anyone at the turn of the hat. Can't have the audience wondering why he's so gloomy. Better explain it within about 2 minutes of meeting him. Anyways, apparently he's a paranormal investigator who never does any actual investigating in the entire film. In fact, he doesn't really do much of anything now that I think about it. He just sort of stands there and lets things happen to him. Hmm. I guess that means the plot description is over. Now onto the fun part. The random crazy bits and mysterious plot holes.As I was watching the film I couldn't help noticing a few problems. In fact, I made a list:1 minute 30 second long opening text. This basically tells you every secret in the movie in needlessly complicated detail. This isn't background information, it's information that the characters will be finding out as they go along. Since his target audience can't read Boll has kindly had them read aloud to us.Christian Slater never speaks normally. Every line is dark and brooding and bad film noir knockoff-ly. He also narrates everything. EVERYTHING. Including things that you saw him do about 20 minutes before (in case you forgot already), things that he couldn't possibly know, and things that actually have no relevance to the plot or even to what's happening at that moment. Sometimes they even narrate plot points that they forgot to show.Action scenes show up randomly with no set up and no reasoning. People just show up and attack him.Also in action scenes is a terrible misuse of slow motion. We're not talking Zack Snyder levels, but at least when Snyder uses slomo he uses it in the right places. Or for the entire fight... Anyway, the problem with Boll is that he throws the slomo in at random. There is nothing happening that the characters should be moving in slow motion. Imagine watching someone tie their shoe in slow motion. How exciting would that be? It's just silly.Another problem with action scenes: Several times in the middle of the scene one guy just stops and waits for the other guy to get up and see him. Just stands there and waits. The silliest example of this comes near the end when a snake thing pops out of the ground, pauses over a woman, the guys point their guns at it, the snake looks at the woman, the guys aim their guns at it, the snake finally bites the women, they immediately start shooting as the snake dives into the ground. Don't you feel so clever now?Yet another problem with the action scenes: the sound editing is terrible. The music is just the same drum roll over and over again. They don't even add any sound effects to distract from it. It gets tiresome real fast.Last thing about the action scene I promise. This one is a question. If you shoot a guy and he keeps running at you what do you do? If your answer is run at the guy and punch him in the face then congratulations! You're an idiot. That is of course exactly what he does.Eerie music should go over eerie scenes. Putting eerie music on when someone's walking down the street does not make that scene eerie. Especially when absolutely nothing happens.On the same note, having creepy camera movies and sound effects in a scene kind of implies that you're going somewhere with them. Throwing them in when he's (again) walking down the street adds nothing to the film.This one's more of a pet peeve of mine. The Abkani civilization is described as being 10,000 years old which just another example of sloppy writing and complete lack of any research into the subject that their characters are supposed to be experts in. There was no civilization 10,000 years ago. OK, there was the town of G&ouml;bekli Tepe in Anatolia but everywhere else was just beginning agriculture. Certainly there was nothing in the Americas anywhere near that time.The villain monologues are depressingly mundane for this type of movie. He just talks normally and doesn't laugh maniacally or sneer or anything. He also seems to have no reason to be doing any of it. He is entirely without motivation or menace. Surprising really. If there's one performance in the film that should be over the top it's this one, yet he's given nothing to do and is astonishingly low key. Odd.The technobabble is unusually bad since this is supposed to take place nowadays.The acting. Christian Slater's not actually doing that bad. he's sort of phoning in his performance but then the writers and director phoned in theirs so why should he care? Those long, boring monologues that make up most of his dialogue in the film were never going to work no matter how much he tried to sell them. Tara Reid gives what is one of the single worst performances ever seen on screen. She makes Denise Richards look believable as the brilliant scientific type. The rest of the acting is mediocre at best with many of the bit players either reading it utterly flat or hamming it up to the extreme.Christian Slater's 'former' bosses provide no resistance to him whatsoever. He basically gets supplied by them with no trouble whatsoever despite getting in fights with their commander.Those crazy camera angles. You can tell that Boll just looks at other films and goes, ""ooh that looks cool. I'm gonna put that in my next film,"" without any relevance or context. There is no originality in this film. None whatsoever. From the creature design on down.Best scene in the film: it starts as a 'dramatic' scene in Bureau 713's headquarters when suddenly a bad romance song comes on and we switch to Christian Slater where out of the blue a girl comes in and decides to have a sex scene. I have never seen a sex scene so unnecessary or hamfistedly forced into a movie. There is no warning, it just cuts to it and then suddenly it cuts away and that's that.Boll frequently forgets to add tension to scenes. He just puts in noises and shock sounds. Worse, he shoots them from a distance. Scary scenes are scary in part because you can't see what's coming. That's why so many horror films have close ups on the actor's faces. You can't see the threat but you know it's there. By having wide panning shots Boll just ruins any fear you might be feeling. No amount of music or screeching can make up for that.A guy's wife dies and he just says, ""Sarah. Oh God Sarah,"" as if he's reading it out of a book. That entire plot thread made no sense incidentally.Slater shows no emotion at killing his friend and when he repeats it to Reid she just monotones, ""you had no choice,"" and that's the end of any angst he might have had. How is this character supposed to be gloomy again? He doesn't seem to care at all.There is a real inconsistency in the monster's portrayal. Are they men or beasts? They seem to switch between them at will. While that might have been intentional, it does raise the question of why they always face Christian Slater in human form but everybody else as monsters?After all that boring plot exposition they decide that they needed to actually conclude the work. Since Christian Slater hasn't done anything the entire movie the Bureau just shows up and tells him that they've solved the entire thing rendering all the time we were following him completely useless. When your main characters can be removed from the plot without consequence you know you have a problem on your hands. Incidentally, the 'discovery' they make was explained to us during the opening scrawl rendering the hour between that and this an utter waste of time.There is a very stereotypical shot of a whole army of monsters running at the camera. Anyone who's ever seen a movie trailer before knows exactly what's gonna happen. One of the monsters is gonna jump up at the camera and it will all fade to black. And indeed it does. After about 30 seconds of monsters running through the forest. Why?Incidentally, for a film calledAlone in the Darkyou get to see the monsters pretty clearly. They're not very scary since they're just a conglomeration of tired old movie monsters. They never even appear unexpectedly either except to bit players who wander off on their own. Everyone else can see them coming from a mile away.An engraving in a cave reads ""once you've made it this far alive you're already dead."" A brilliant line. Which raises the question of who built it, who carved out the rooms, who installed the laboratory, and why are they not already dead?A badguy points his gun at three guys who are pointing guns at him and tells them to put them down. Naturally they obey. Very obedient our heroes. And of course our villain does the old 'never kill your enemies' bit and holds them at gunpoint when he has no reason to keep them alive. Also, how'd he get down there with all those military guys and monsters in the way?The nun running the orphanage is helping the bad guy. That's no spoiler since they reveal it in the first five minutes. What is surprising is that they never explain why. She's established as a good person so why help him? Did they forget to write that scene? Jesus.There are plenty of problems that I skipped over because they were boring or too spoiler-heavy but those are the big ones.

Following up his previous crapfest 'House Of The Dead' is this film, 'Alone In The Dark'.  And once again, he sodomizes us with one of the worst film ever put to celluloid.Probably my favorite thing about Boll is his complete disregard for continuity or coherent story, and he desregards both in spades in 'Alone In The Dark'.  There is no thread of a plot in this film's running time.  Nothing makes any sense.  People show up randomly to places that you have no idea why they are there.  The special effects are marginally better than a completely low budget flick.  The action scenes are absolutely pathetic.  The acting is pathetic:  Tara Reid is the worst scientist ever, Christian Slater is completely lame(any one who says here that he did the only good acting in this film is insane), and Stephen Dorff rocks a mullet.Put in plain english:  this movie is crap in its purest form.  Now, while 'Alone In The Dark' is not quite as crappy as 'House Of The Dead', don't be fooled into thinking its better.  It isn't.  It just sucks in a slightly different way.

893312,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0007XBM5W,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 12/07Rate: 112/07: After reading much about Uwe Boll, I finally managed to see one of his films. This time, it is titled Alone in the Dark. It was proclaimed as the worst film of the year, and was in running for the title as worst of the worst. Naturally, my expectations were low. After the first half of the picture, I thought it was badly mediocre, or in other words, not so bad for a bad film. The second half came and produced a very heavy, deep sleep for me. Now, as I've been warned before, Alone in the Dark is a major(!) bore. The special effects were dreadful. The feel of the film was of made-for-TV quality. Christian Slater is too good for this junk; must he reduce himself to this? Of all acting performances, Tara Reid may have just killed the movie. As far as the story goes, I had no idea what was going on; it was just pointless for me in trying to recall it. It's best to leave it...in words of Nigel Tufnel...unsolved. When I saw the protective gear the soldiers wore, I thought they were gearing up for some rollerblade race. The monsters in Alone in the Dark seemed to be a carbon copy of the aliens from Alien and Aliens. And the script along with the lines? Man, I need to sniff a lot of glue to lose many brain cells to understand it better. Well, ladies and gentlemen, Ed Wood did everything ten times better in Plan 9 from Outer Space than Uwe Boll did in Alone in the Dark, and that's an embarrassment.

I play video games and love the thin backstories for the interactive videogame experience. However, most of these movies should never have seen the light of day.I knew it would be trouble when the movie opens with the longest narrated text thread I have ever witnessed. Whatever happened to the protagonist explaining the setup as part of the movie? The story opens with a decent action sequence, but the movie makes little sense.The strange secret government task force looks ridiculous and are as ever ineffectual. They need to rely on the rogue former agent (Christian Slater) to save the day. Slater really sleepwalks through this film but who could blame him. None of the other acting is better. Tara Reid stumbles with her dialogue and Stephen Dorff could not have been more ridiculous as the leader of Section 713.The movie ends mysteriously and open ended. Hopefully no sequel is in the making. One thing that occurred to me in reflecting on ""Alone in the Dark"" was how much it seemed like the movie was made as cutscenes for the videogame.

893320,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B0007XBM5W,Brian A. Schar,"[3, 5]","""Alone in the Dark"" fails miserably as both a regular film and as something that might be appreciated as a bad movie, primarily because it commits the cardinal sin of being boring.  Hey, this is a movie with ancient civilizations and an ancient McGuffin, a government paranormal research team, and some monsters that look like Alien.  You can make a bad movie with those elements, but making that movie _boring_ on top of that is quite an achievement.  What makes ""Alone in the Dark"" even worse is that the first five minutes actually have kind of a goofy energy that is missing from the remainder of the movie.  Those first five minutes are like a promise to the audience that is broken by the rest of the film.  Even ""House of the Dead,"" Boll's previous video game movie, is entertaining as a bad movie because of its wacky energy - it keeps things moving and takes advantage, on a B-movie level, of its key story elements.

It's amazing to me that Tara Reid and Uwe Boll still manage to find work in the business.  Reid's puny acting skills seem to deteriorate further with every film she makes, while Boll has to be the worst ""big name"" director of the twenty-first century.  Apparently, the movie was originally intended to have an actual storyline, but Uwe Boll decided to scrap it in favor of more explosions.  I don't know how a decent actor like Christian Slater got involved with this movie or how he made it through the filming with his sanity intact, but he's pretty much the only thing this film has going for it.This film bears little resemblance to the original trilogy of Alone in the Dark games.  I don't have any experience with the later releases in the series, but the Edward Carnby of the original game was a regular private investigator who was sent to find a piano in the house of a man who committed suicide and suddenly found himself attacked by ghostly monsters.  In the movie, he's a veritable action adventure hero with a mysterious childhood and a former career as an agent for a top secret paranormal investigation unit called Bureau 713.  The whole story is built around the discovery of a previously unknown race of American Indians called the Abskani, who disappeared quite suddenly thousands of years ago after opening up a gateway to another dimension or something and letting something really, really bad into the world.  Carnby (Christian Slater) left the bureau because all of the Abskani artifacts he found were immediately classified, thus preventing him from finding out the truth.  It turns out that this truth has a lot of personal meaning for him, as a missing chunk of his childhood can be traced back to a secret Abskani-related experiment conducted by rogue scientist Professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker).  You don't have to remember all of this now, though, because most of it is explained in an interminably long prologue at the opening of the film.  The actual movie consists mostly of badly-shot special effects featuring alien entities attacking Carnby, his archaeologist girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid), and the new commander of Bureau 713 (Stephen Dorff).Since Uwe Boll thinks action and things that go boom are all that is needed to make a movie, you would think he would take the trouble to learn how to shoot those types of scenes.  The man doesn't even know how to use slow motion properly, and he apparently chooses his camera angles completely at random, thus ruining the whole effect of most of the action scenes.  Of course, no explosion can be big enough to absorb the plot holes in the story or the black hole of acting generated by Tara Reid.  With multiple awards for worst directing, worst special effects, and worse acting, this is a film that really should be left alone in the dark.",2,You can't say you haven't been warned,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,3003,"['only', 'real', 'entertainment', 'can', 'get', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'reading', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'many', 'are', 'hilarious', 'no-holds-barred', 'skewering', 'film', 'amazing', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'still', 'manage', 'find', 'work', 'business', 'Reid', 'puny', 'acting', 'skills', 'seem', 'deteriorate', 'further', 'film', 'Boll', 'be', 'worst', 'big', 'name', 'director', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'have', 'actual', 'storyline', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'decided', 'scrap', 'favor', 'more', 'explosions', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'decent', 'actor', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'got', 'involved', 'movie', 'how', 'made', 'filming', 'sanity', 'intact', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'it.This', 'film', 'bears', 'little', 'resemblance', 'original', 'trilogy', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'games', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'later', 'releases', 'series', 'Edward', 'Carnby', 'original', 'game', 'was', 'regular', 'private', 'investigator', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'find', 'piano', 'house', 'man', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'suddenly', 'found', 'attacked', 'ghostly', 'monsters', 'movie', 'veritable', 'action', 'adventure', 'hero', 'mysterious', 'childhood', 'former', 'career', 'agent', 'top', 'secret', 'paranormal', 'investigation', 'unit', 'called', 'Bureau', '713', 'whole', 'story', 'built', 'discovery', 'previously', 'unknown', 'race', 'American', 'Indians', 'called', 'Abskani', 'who', 'disappeared', 'quite', 'suddenly', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'opening', 'up', 'gateway', 'dimension', 'something', 'letting', 'something', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'world', 'Carnby', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'left', 'bureau', 'Abskani', 'found', 'were', 'immediately', 'classified', 'thus', 'preventing', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'out', 'truth', 'lot', 'personal', 'meaning', 'missing', 'chunk', 'childhood', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'secret', 'Abskani-related', 'experiment', 'conducted', 'rogue', 'scientist', 'Professor', 'Hudgens', 'Matthew', 'Walker', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'remember', 'now', 'though', 'most', 'explained', 'interminably', 'long', 'prologue', 'opening', 'film', 'actual', 'movie', 'mostly', 'badly-shot', 'special', 'effects', 'featuring', 'alien', 'entities', 'attacking', 'Carnby', 'archaeologist', 'girlfriend', 'Aline', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'new', 'commander', 'Bureau', '713', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', '.Since', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'action', 'things', 'go', 'boom', 'are', 'needed', 'make', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'take', 'trouble', 'learn', 'how', 'shoot', 'types', 'scenes', 'man', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'properly', 'apparently', 'camera', 'completely', 'random', 'thus', 'ruining', 'whole', 'effect', 'most', 'action', 'scenes', 'course', 'explosion', 'can', 'be', 'big', 'enough', 'absorb', 'plot', 'holes', 'story', 'black', 'hole', 'acting', 'generated', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'multiple', 'awards', 'worst', 'directing', 'worst', 'special', 'effects', 'worse', 'acting', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'dark']",Alone in the Dark

Compared to the acclaimed Worst Director of All Time, I think Boll's even worse that him.  Ed Wood may not have the budget (or logic) for any of his movies, but his movies are certainly original, or at least have original elements to stand out; can you think of a movie about aliens that raise people from the dead to threaten humanity for peace, or a movie that ended with the scientist fighting an octopus that explodes?  Boll does not have that same creative and ambitious mind, he prefers to take whatever exists in the media (i.e. video games) and defecate all over it.  His first film, ""House of the Dead"", is the bottom of the barrel of awful movies: the plot and characters are dumb, the camera shots are obnoxious awful (yea, let's have every survivor have 360 effect), the action had no substance, and it makes an asinine use of video game footage for scene transitions.  It was an incoherent, immature monstrosity.""Alone of the Dark"" isn't as bad the director's first disemBOLLment, but that's like saying a plate of excrement is better than a mountain-pile of it.  The plot was functional and it ties all the elements together (sans for the last few scenes), and at least Boll toned down the stupid camera effects for this film.  That being said, the camera effects still exist for insubstantial reasons, like the infamous monster shootout in the storage area where the camera pans and moves around like a 3D cartoon or the first-person POV during a walk in the alley when the camera makes sudden motion shifts.  I understand what the film's trying to present in those moments, but those effects aren't necessary; they're so exaggerated, they ended up losing their intended mood.  Boll makes a dubious effect to use these visual aspects for all of his movies; it's like he's trying to be Paul W.S. Anderson, but he doesn't quite understand his style.Everything else is standard Boll badness.  The actors are phoning it in, there's a lot of dragging, the special effects barely rise above those from Sci-Fi original movies, and overall uneventful to sit through.  ""Alone in the Dark"" is a weak effort, not even the director's cut can fix it.  As far what I know about this version (besides the intended framing of 2.35 instead of 1.78), the love scene between Tara Reid and Christian Slater in the original was cut; not like there was anything going on in that love scene, so it wasn't a big loss.",2,The darkness can't hide this movie's ugliness,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,2476,"['Uwe', 'Boll', 'often', 'called', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'current', 'film', 'industry', 'Compared', 'acclaimed', 'Worst', 'Director', 'All', 'Time', 'think', 'Boll', 'even', 'worse', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'logic', 'movies', 'movies', 'are', 'certainly', 'original', 'least', 'have', 'original', 'elements', 'stand', 'out', 'can', 'think', 'movie', 'aliens', 'raise', 'people', 'dead', 'threaten', 'humanity', 'peace', 'movie', 'ended', 'scientist', 'fighting', 'octopus', 'Boll', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'creative', 'ambitious', 'mind', 'take', 'exists', 'media', 'i.e', 'video', 'games', 'defecate', 'first', 'film', 'House', 'Dead', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'awful', 'movies', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'dumb', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'obnoxious', 'awful', 'yea', 'let', 'have', 'survivor', 'have', '360', 'effect', 'action', 'had', 'substance', 'asinine', 'use', 'video', 'game', 'footage', 'scene', 'transitions', 'was', 'incoherent', 'immature', 'monstrosity', 'Alone', 'Dark', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'director', 'first', 'disemBOLLment', 'saying', 'plate', 'excrement', 'better', 'mountain-pile', 'plot', 'was', 'functional', 'elements', 'together', 'sans', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'least', 'Boll', 'toned', 'down', 'stupid', 'camera', 'effects', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'camera', 'effects', 'still', 'exist', 'insubstantial', 'reasons', 'infamous', 'monster', 'shootout', 'storage', 'area', 'where', 'camera', 'pans', 'moves', '3D', 'cartoon', 'first-person', 'POV', 'walk', 'alley', 'when', 'camera', 'sudden', 'motion', 'shifts', 'understand', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'present', 'moments', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', ""'re"", 'so', 'exaggerated', 'ended', 'up', 'losing', 'intended', 'mood', 'Boll', 'dubious', 'effect', 'use', 'visual', 'aspects', 'movies', 'trying', 'be', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'style.Everything', 'else', 'standard', 'Boll', 'badness', 'actors', 'are', 'phoning', 'lot', 'dragging', 'special', 'effects', 'barely', 'rise', 'Sci-Fi', 'original', 'movies', 'overall', 'uneventful', 'sit', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'weak', 'effort', 'not', 'even', 'director', 'cut', 'can', 'fix', 'far', 'what', 'know', 'version', 'intended', 'framing', '2.35', 'instead', '1.78', 'love', 'scene', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'original', 'was', 'cut', 'not', 'was', 'anything', 'going', 'love', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'loss']",Alone in the Dark

Uwe Boll's adaptation of the video game is the sort of movie that usually gets relegated to discount bins for four bucks, but isn't ever purchased -- oh yes, people, it pushes new boundaries of horrendous silliness.It opens with an explanation about the Abskani, an ancient civilization who apparently worshiped demons -- and were somehow destroyed by them. Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, and you find that the adage about ""those who don't learn from history"" is true: Professor Hudgens (Mathew Walker) is obsessed with using Abskani artifacts, and only Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), a clone of Agent Mulder, can hope to stop him.Carnby is haunted by nightmares that are somehow connected to those ancient demons, and by experiments that Hudgens performed years ago. He teams up with his museum-curator ex-girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid -- no joke!) to stop Hudgens from using some ancient statue to release interdimensional aliens, who may destroy the entire human race.""Alone in the Dark"" is an orgy of ridiculous idea, a steaming pile of rancid celluloid that should have been relegated to 2AM showings on the Sci Fi Channel. In fact, it's difficult to understand why this video game adaptation wasn't relegated to the ""Direct to Video"" bins, along with all the other bad F-movie horror flicks.And where to begin? What bad aspect about this disaster is the worst?Let's start with Uwe Boll's direction -- it's leaden and uneven, full of slow-motion and quick cuts at all the wrong moments. Apparently nobody told Boll that alien beasties jumping out does NOT count as a shocking plot twist. At least Boll wasn't directly responsible for the script, which includes a sex scene for the sake of having one, and such delightfully illogical scenes as Aline reading ancient scripts by memory.The acting never becomes much better than the script or direction -- Slater and Dorff are sleepwalking through their roles, probably counting the seconds until they can punch out for the day. And Tara Reid manages a bit of hilarity as a scientist -- Boll lets us know she's brilliant, because she wears glasses. It's like watching Paris Hilton pretend to be a particle physicist.After the so-bad-it's-bad trainwrecks of late, Uwe Boll's reputation as the worst filmmaker alive -- perhaps ever -- is cemented in place, to the point where he could probably ruin a nature special with wooden acting and cracked-out camerawork.

Being directed by Uwe Boll, it's not the best sci-fi action film in the world, not the best video game adaption in the world, but it's all right. Mind you, I am being a tad generous giving it three stars.If you've seen a bit of sci-fi, you'll know that lost civilizations have a lot to answer for. The lost civilization of ""Alone in the Dark"", the Abskani, discovered a door to the world of darkness, inhabited by a race of near-invisible dinosaur-like creatures who have the ability to posess bodies of the dead with snake-like parasites inserted into the spine. Because of their meddling with the door, the Abskani are wiped out, but their artifacts remain, scattered around the world. In the present day, a secret US government organization is gathering these artifacts, and much more besides. Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a former member of this organization, and after being assaulted by an undead fellow is determined to get some answers. As he searches with with his anthropologist girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid) he discovers a horrible, dark secret(pun intended) from his past, and has a lot of gunfights.I did think to myself that this would be the sort of film that Ed Wood would make if he were still alive, (the living dead, aliens, scientists, all his favourites are here) but I like Ed Wood, so I didn't mind so much, I like the B-grade atmosphere, and I didn't take this film too seriously. The film, however, takes itself very seriously, there's not one decent quip or joke to lighten the mood. Would have helped a bit.Special features include a behind-the-scenes featurette where everyone is very excited about the film (Tara Reid tells us its the first time in her career where she gets to use a gun), a featurette about special effects and how they were made, an animatic of the ""bullet time"" sequence (where Edward shoots two bullets which pierce both a large block of ice and his bad guy target) and a couple of galleries worth of photographs.I recommend this to fans of the video game series, though I suppose it would be an all right film to invite a few friends around and make fun of, if you're into that sort of thing.",3,Uwe Boll Keeps Us In The Dark,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2289,"['Christian', 'Slater', 'stars', 'Edward', 'Carnby', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'extension', 'story', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'series', 'video', 'games', 'Being', 'directed', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'not', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'world', 'not', 'best', 'video', 'game', 'adaption', 'world', 'right', 'Mind', 'am', 'being', 'tad', 'generous', 'giving', 'three', 'stars.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bit', 'sci-fi', ""'ll"", 'know', 'lost', 'civilizations', 'have', 'lot', 'answer', 'lost', 'civilization', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'Abskani', 'discovered', 'door', 'world', 'darkness', 'inhabited', 'race', 'near-invisible', 'dinosaur-like', 'creatures', 'who', 'have', 'ability', 'posess', 'bodies', 'dead', 'snake-like', 'parasites', 'inserted', 'spine', 'meddling', 'door', 'Abskani', 'are', 'wiped', 'out', 'artifacts', 'remain', 'scattered', 'world', 'present', 'day', 'secret', 'US', 'government', 'organization', 'gathering', 'artifacts', 'much', 'more', 'besides', 'Edward', 'Carnby', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'former', 'member', 'organization', 'being', 'assaulted', 'undead', 'fellow', 'determined', 'get', 'answers', 'anthropologist', 'girlfriend', 'Aline', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'horrible', 'dark', 'secret', 'pun', 'intended', 'past', 'lot', 'gunfights.I', 'did', 'think', 'myself', 'would', 'be', 'sort', 'film', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'would', 'make', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'living', 'dead', 'aliens', 'scientists', 'favourites', 'are', 'here', 'like', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'B-grade', 'atmosphere', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'seriously', 'not', 'one', 'decent', 'quip', 'joke', 'lighten', 'mood', 'Would', 'have', 'helped', 'bit.Special', 'features', 'include', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'where', 'everyone', 'very', 'excited', 'film', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'first', 'time', 'career', 'where', 'use', 'gun', 'featurette', 'special', 'effects', 'how', 'were', 'made', 'animatic', 'bullet', 'time', 'sequence', 'where', 'Edward', 'two', 'bullets', 'pierce', 'large', 'block', 'ice', 'bad', 'guy', 'target', 'couple', 'galleries', 'photographs.I', 'recommend', 'fans', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'suppose', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'film', 'invite', 'few', 'friends', 'make', 'fun', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing']",Alone in the Dark
893344,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B0007XBM5W,Ghoulie Guru,"[4, 5]","We should all congratulate Uwe Boll.  He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for XBox and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them.This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I wouldn't be disappointed. Even the $5 you will spend on this DVD if you buy it used off one of Amazon's sellers is too much. You will regret it.

893352,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0007XBM5W,Jeffrey Leach,"[60, 66]","We saw ""House of the Dead"" and blanched in sheer horror at the ineptness apparent in every scene. We gaped at the use of actual videogame footage spliced into the aforementioned movie. We shrieked in terror, not at the so-called horror elements of the film, but at the fact that Jurgen Prochnow deigned to appear in such trash. And we absolutely wept with soul shattering intensity to see the venerable character actor Clint Howard saddled with an annoying lisp while sporting a cheesy looking yellow rain slicker. As the credits rolled in ""House of the Dead,"" we felt a moment of elation because we realized calling Jack Kevorkian was not necessary, that we would recover from the worst film experience many of us had witnessed in some time. Such was the experience of many viewers' regarding their first encounter with the indomitable Uwe Boll's freshman cinematic disaster. Then came ""Alone in the Dark,"" and the nightmare continued. Who among us will have the bravery to climb to the peak of the highest mountain and shriek at the top of their lungs, ""Get thee behind me, Uwe Boll?"" From the looks of it, just about everyone who has seen this disaster. No one, thankfully, pulls any punches in describing this train wreck.Christian Slater's character Edward Carnby has a serious problem. No, it's not appearing in Uwe Boll's film, although that would certainly classify as an insurmountable difficulty. Carnby's primary problem, first elaborated on in an introductory screen scrawl that roughly equals the length of the Oxford English Dictionary, involves an ancient race of technologically advanced people called the Abracadabras...er, I mean the Aldonovas...darn, the Abskani! Yeah, that's it, the Abskani. I think. Anyway, these prehistoric yahoos accidentally opened up some portal between the world of light and the world of dark, thus allowing evil creatures that look like something H.G. Giger upchucked after a Jagermeister binge to enter our world. The Abskani died off as a result, but they left behind a bunch of artifacts scattered throughout the world that, if properly collected and utilized, will allow humanity to close the portal once again. If it's been opened in the first place, that is, which apparently occurs when some old coot named Professor Hudgens (Mathew Walker) conducts some crackpot experiment with a bunch of kids. One of these kiddies was Eddie Carnby. Now a whole bunch of years later, Carnby is trying to find out what happened to him when he was just a wee lad.You'll forgive me if my memory starts to blank at this point, but I'll be darned if I can form a coherent narrative concerning the rest of the film. Hudgens had something to do with forming a top-secret government agency entitled Bureau 713 charged with investigating the paranormal. Carnby was once a member but has since struck out alone much to the chagrin of his former colleague Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the middle of all of this artifact gatherin' we meet Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), a brainy archeologist and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Hudgens who just happened to date Carnby at some point in the past. I'd appreciate it if you stop laughing over the idea of Reid as an archeologist and keep reading the review. Thank you. Anyway, some superhuman yutz tries to kill Carnby but fails, and our hero soon turns up to engage Aline in his current quest to discover his missing past. Boll starts tossing out scene after scene of pure schlock, most of which involve highly stylized gunfights involving Carnby, Cedrac, the jackbooted thugs over at Bureau 713, and the Giger beasties. Everything is just as it seems as ""Alone in the Dark"" judders to its closing credits amidst a shriek of screeching metal and smashing glass. Will Carnby uncover his past? Will Aline Cedrac start wearing contact lenses? Will Richards quit striking macho poses? Who cares?""Alone in the Dark"" is to film what Chernobyl is to nuclear power. Aside from a few interesting shots, primarily the beasties running through a forest and the glimpses we see of the demons' hiding place, nothing works. The cackhanded script, written by no less than three now unemployable hacks, is so full of plot holes that any attempt to explicate on them here at length is an exercise in futility. The dialogue is the equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard, the pacing moves in fits and starts, and the acting is utterly hopeless. Tara Reid as a scientist? Strikes one, two, and three right there. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff try to do right with a horrible script, but I think it's safe to say both men might want to reconsider their career options after appearing in this atrocity. I hear Kmart is hiring. Dorff especially is in big trouble. With ""Feardotcom"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" on his resume, he'll be lucky to qualify for welfare. Congratulations, Uwe Boll--you've managed to wreck more careers than the Hollywood blacklist.What really frightens me about Boll is his upcoming project ""Bloodrayne."" I feel that I should go see this film in the theater. Why? Because the inevitable comparisons between this director and Ed Wood practically demand that lovers of bad cinema should sit up and pay attention. I never had the chance to see ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" on the big screen, but I do have the opportunity to see an Uwe Boll disaster at the local multiplex. One day that might mean something. Or it might keep me out of heaven. Either way, Herr Boll's formidable prowess at churning out total pap seems impervious to the outraged shrieks of the viewing public.

893353,ACTG0NWGJMNSM,B0007XBM5W,"John Larsen ""Johncritic""","[3, 4]","If you want to be alone while watching Alone In The Dark, there's good news and bad news. The good news is you will get your wish. The bad news is that misery loves company.Being dangled by red hot nipple clamps over a pit of cactus and scorpions would be less painful than sitting through this menage a trash about aliens, monsters, nefarious scientists, abducted children, a paranormal putz and Tara Reid as a museum curator. Pinch me, I must be dreaming.Better a pinch than a slap in the face, which is what this hokey poky of a film delivers. Alone in the Dark is supposedly based on an old Atari game, one that I've never heard of. What I do remember about old Atari games was their rudimentary graphics and storylines. I doubt the film= s extended back story was even a consideration.So in order to fill in the blanks, writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer borrow and steal from other films. Better films. Films that make you realize you= re not just watching an imitation, but a really bad imitation, like Chuck Norris doing his one man tribute to Judy Garland. I'll admit his rendition of Easter Parade had me in tears, but only because he was kicking me in the face.That's what it felt like watching Alone in the Dark. I don= t mind dumb, stupid horror films, but I hate dumb, stupid horror films that refuse to acknowledge that fact. Alone in the Dark arrives with such a poker face its impossible to know if we= re supposed to take any of this seriously. We are, but we don= t, or more precisely, can= t. There= s no leeway in the script, direction or acting.Government conspiracies abound (after a slavishly long opening crawl) in Alone in the Dark, which finds paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) teaming up with an elite group of government agents to defeat an ancient evil. As an orphan, Edward escaped the clutches of unscrupulous government agent/scientist Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), whose depraved experiments turned children into crossbred zombies. Now that Hudgens has found the final key to unlock the portal between dark and light, it's up to Edward, former lover and curator Aline Cedrac (Reid) and commando leader Burke (Stephen Dorff) to save mankind.Yeah, that= s who I would call when ultimate evil decides to bitch slap humanity: two actors riding that direct-to-video rail and an actress best known for flashing paparazzi. Was this a casting decision or payback? Director Uwe Boll (The House of the Dead) isn=t much help, never allowing the actors to step outside of the paper-thin box or express any emotion beyond the written word. If everyone in front or behind the camera just acknowledged the obvious, Alone in the Dark would have been a hoot. Computer-generated monsters that never seem to occupy the same frame as the actors, trigger-happy commandos, a convoluted plot that makes no sense, paper doll characters, all the trappings of a goofy good time.Too bad the folks behind Alone in the Dark didn=t fall into that trap.",1,ALONE AGAIN UNNATURALLY,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,3003,"['want', 'be', 'alone', 'watching', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'good', 'news', 'will', 'get', 'wish', 'bad', 'news', 'misery', 'company.Being', 'dangled', 'red', 'hot', 'nipple', 'clamps', 'pit', 'cactus', 'scorpions', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'painful', 'sitting', 'menage', 'trash', 'aliens', 'monsters', 'nefarious', 'scientists', 'abducted', 'children', 'paranormal', 'putz', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'museum', 'curator', 'Pinch', 'must', 'be', 'dreaming.Better', 'pinch', 'slap', 'face', 'what', 'hokey', 'poky', 'film', 'delivers', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'supposedly', 'based', 'old', 'Atari', 'game', 'one', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'What', 'do', 'remember', 'old', 'Atari', 'games', 'was', 'rudimentary', 'graphics', 'storylines', 'doubt', 'film=', 's', 'extended', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'consideration.So', 'order', 'fill', 'blanks', 'writers', 'Elan', 'Mastai', 'Michael', 'Roesch', 'Peter', 'Scheerer', 'borrow', 'steal', 'other', 'films', 'Better', 'films', 'Films', 'make', 'realize', 'you=', 'not', 'just', 'watching', 'imitation', 'really', 'bad', 'imitation', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'doing', 'one', 'man', 'tribute', 'Judy', 'Garland', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'rendition', 'Easter', 'Parade', 'had', 'tears', 'only', 'was', 'kicking', 'face.That', 'what', 'felt', 'watching', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'don=', 't', 'mind', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'horror', 'films', 'hate', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'horror', 'films', 'refuse', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'poker', 'face', 'impossible', 'know', 'we=', 're', 'supposed', 'take', 'seriously', 'are', 'don=', 't', 'more', 'precisely', 'can=', 't.', 'There=', 'leeway', 'script', 'direction', 'acting.Government', 'conspiracies', 'abound', 'slavishly', 'long', 'opening', 'crawl', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'Edward', 'Carnby', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'teaming', 'up', 'elite', 'group', 'government', 'agents', 'defeat', 'ancient', 'evil', 'orphan', 'Edward', 'escaped', 'clutches', 'unscrupulous', 'government', 'agent/scientist', 'Lionel', 'Hudgens', 'Matthew', 'Walker', 'depraved', 'experiments', 'turned', 'children', 'crossbred', 'zombies', 'Now', 'Hudgens', 'found', 'final', 'key', 'unlock', 'portal', 'dark', 'light', 'up', 'Edward', 'former', 'lover', 'curator', 'Aline', 'Cedrac', 'Reid', 'commando', 'leader', 'Burke', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'save', 'mankind.Yeah', 'that=', 's', 'who', 'would', 'call', 'when', 'ultimate', 'evil', 'bitch', 'slap', 'humanity', 'two', 'actors', 'riding', 'direct-to-video', 'rail', 'actress', 'best', 'known', 'flashing', 'paparazzi', 'Was', 'casting', 'decision', 'payback', 'Director', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'House', 'Dead', 'isn=t', 'much', 'help', 'never', 'allowing', 'actors', 'step', 'paper-thin', 'box', 'express', 'emotion', 'written', 'word', 'everyone', 'front', 'camera', 'just', 'acknowledged', 'obvious', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hoot', 'Computer-generated', 'monsters', 'never', 'seem', 'occupy', 'same', 'frame', 'actors', 'trigger-happy', 'commandos', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'sense', 'paper', 'doll', 'characters', 'trappings', 'goofy', 'good', 'time.Too', 'bad', 'folks', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'didn=t', 'fall', 'trap']",Alone in the Dark
893354,A332MW6OA1LYDF,B0007XBM5W,John Noodles,"[0, 2]","This movie is about as entertaining as watching someone else play a video game, and badly.  There is the thinnest of plots, which involves little more than the characters shooting their ways through one situation after another with cool guns.Stephan Dorff plays Burke, leader of what we are supposed to believe is some sort of elite government fighter squad organized to battle paranormal monsters.  They consist of burly men who look the part, and super-foxy women of color who don't.  They aren't very good at their jobs, either, because killing them is as easy as stepping on ants. Stephen Dorff has one one emotion in this movie, the same one he relies on in every movie:  intense.  He scowls and looks intense.  It's hard to buy because, well, he looks so short.  And he always leads them into a building via the easiest route possible:  They rapel in slow motion through skylight windows.Tara Reid...well.  She's easy to look at, I guess, but she squeaks her lines, and we're supposed to believe that a woman THAT young has somehow managed to become assistant curator of a large museum.  (IMDB says that Reid's trademark is her deep raspy voice--DEEP?  Well, maybe she cultivated the squeak through voice lessons.) But Burke is impressed enough with her credentials as an anthropologist to let her accompany him (with Slater's character, Carnby) on a mission to Destroy All Monsters, and can't seem to wait to give her high-powered weaponry, which she uses masterfully without any training whatsoever. Yeah, government agents are always that eager to give guns to bimbos. Maybe she was a Navy SEAL before landing the gig at the museum, who knows.There are no suprises in this movie.  It consists of one  battle after another, with no sense of rising tension or progressive complication.

He used to work for Bureau 713 (not to be confused with the popular Bureau 13) of the FBI.  An ancient Native American tribe (the Abkane) seems to be connected with anything occult.  Carnby has just come into possession of one of their artifacts when an attempt is made on his life.Carnby's past, the Abkane, and the natural human fear of the dark all combine to make this movie.  It has plenty of action, suspense and creepiness.  Carnby has his hands full dealing with the government, monsters, and megalomaniacs.  It all comes together in a race against time that results in a surprise ending (the scope of which was not entirely clear).There is much talk on the disk about making the film true to the games.  Other than the name of the main character I found little resemblance to the games (the first one could be played without Carnby).  The claim is that the stories of the games make up his past but I still can't see it.  Also, Carnby is never alone in his adventures.  He has no end of help when facing the darkness but I guess they didn't want to call this A Crowd in the Dark.So we know what this film is not.  It is not a good adaptation of the popular games.  But it is a seriously good creepy movie (other than not being specific enough right at the end).  If you like action, monsters, suspense and a good thriller, then you will probably like this film.

Where did that come from?! Anyways...this movie has a stupid plot, and is very confusing. It makes NO sense whatsoever.

I thought I was watching my brother's high school senior project, but then I realized that had some production value. Sure, you have to use your imagination when watching someone jump off the roof of a house when it is suppose to be a cliff ledge, but we are talking a shoestring budget that didn't cover the cost of coke and corn nuts. This was no big budget film that made its way (unforuntatly) into theatres nation wide. But when you see Stephen Dorf in his base of operations for the first time the same thing might cross your mind. They spent all there money on beer anad pizza so all they could afford was third rate props and put them in a condemned building. Never mind the small things like, covering the walls so we can at least keep the illusion that we are in some secret base.My brother's movie also had a story that was interesting. It was a combination of the Goonies meet Indian Jones. Maybe Mr. Spielberg might have thought it was cute or just sued them. I dunno. The point is that there was a story there that you could follow and even enjoy. These elements were all missing from AITD. There is not a story here that you can get into or know exactly what is going on.I think that that the director and my brother had this in common- they were making it up as they were going along. However, my brother, remember what happened the scene before and this guy did not.You may not have heard of Billy Wright, Steven Jacobs, or Greg Rast, but let me tell you after you watch AITD you will wish you never heard the names Slater, Ried, or Dorf again. At least my brothers buddies were doing it for a grade so they could get out of high school. These three were doing it for a paycheck. When was the last time that you heard from Slater? Besides when he is going to prison or getting busted for something? Exactly. I would use one word in paticular to describe all three of them, but Amazon would not like it too much and  ban me for life. Give you a hint, it rhymes with ""bore.""I hear this guy is making another film, Maybe I should dust off the super 8 camcorder and mail it my brother. Hey, if this pinhead can do it why can't my brother? He can use his 2 kids this time around.Oh, and for you all that gave this thing above 2 stars- get a clue, get a life. Just because it came from a videogame that you played in the basement, nostop becasue no one would go out with you on a Friday night, is no reason to think it is the second coming of movie greatness.I will end this with one thing. If you have not seen this do not see it. You may be tempted to check it out at the local dollar theatre. Sure, it's just a buck. But we are talking about time from your life you will never get back. Same goes with renting it. And for the love of everything that you hold sacred and dear in this world, DO NOT BUY THE DVD. If you want to get rid of twenty dollars donate it to a charity. But, if  you do go against my advice, I am one of those people that will say ""told you so.""",1,CAN I GET 2 HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,3244,"['could', 'have', 'given', 'thing', 'less', 'one', 'star', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'need', 'correct', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'waste', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'lost', 'one', 'hour', 'life', 'cut', 'losses', 'could.Anyhoo', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'thing', 'got', 'made', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'brother', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'project', 'then', 'realized', 'had', 'production', 'value', 'Sure', 'have', 'use', 'imagination', 'when', 'watching', 'someone', 'jump', 'roof', 'house', 'when', 'suppose', 'be', 'cliff', 'ledge', 'are', 'talking', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'cost', 'coke', 'corn', 'nuts', 'was', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'made', 'way', 'unforuntatly', 'theatres', 'nation', 'wide', 'when', 'see', 'Stephen', 'Dorf', 'base', 'operations', 'first', 'time', 'same', 'thing', 'might', 'cross', 'mind', 'spent', 'money', 'beer', 'anad', 'pizza', 'could', 'afford', 'was', 'third', 'rate', 'props', 'put', 'condemned', 'building', 'Never', 'mind', 'small', 'things', 'covering', 'walls', 'can', 'least', 'keep', 'illusion', 'are', 'secret', 'base.My', 'brother', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'combination', 'Goonies', 'meet', 'Indian', 'Jones', 'Maybe', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'just', 'sued', 'dunno', 'point', 'was', 'story', 'there', 'could', 'follow', 'even', 'enjoy', 'elements', 'were', 'missing', 'AITD', 'not', 'story', 'here', 'can', 'get', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'on.I', 'think', 'director', 'brother', 'had', 'common-', 'were', 'making', 'up', 'were', 'going', 'along', 'However', 'brother', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'scene', 'guy', 'did', 'not.You', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'Billy', 'Wright', 'Steven', 'Jacobs', 'Greg', 'Rast', 'let', 'tell', 'watch', 'AITD', 'will', 'wish', 'never', 'heard', 'names', 'Slater', 'Ried', 'Dorf', 'again', 'least', 'brothers', 'buddies', 'were', 'doing', 'grade', 'could', 'get', 'high', 'school', 'three', 'were', 'doing', 'paycheck', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'heard', 'Slater', 'when', 'going', 'prison', 'getting', 'busted', 'something', 'Exactly', 'would', 'use', 'one', 'word', 'paticular', 'describe', 'three', 'Amazon', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'too', 'much', 'ban', 'life', 'Give', 'hint', 'bore', 'hear', 'guy', 'making', 'film', 'Maybe', 'should', 'dust', 'off', 'super', '8', 'camcorder', 'mail', 'brother', 'Hey', 'pinhead', 'can', 'do', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'brother', 'can', 'use', '2', 'kids', 'time', 'around.Oh', 'gave', 'thing', '2', 'stars-', 'get', 'clue', 'get', 'life', 'Just', 'came', 'videogame', 'played', 'basement', 'nostop', 'becasue', 'one', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'Friday', 'night', 'reason', 'think', 'second', 'coming', 'movie', 'greatness.I', 'will', 'end', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'may', 'be', 'tempted', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'dollar', 'theatre', 'Sure', 'just', 'buck', 'are', 'talking', 'time', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'Same', 'renting', 'love', 'everything', 'hold', 'sacred', 'dear', 'world', 'DO', 'NOT', 'BUY', 'THE', 'DVD', 'want', 'get', 'rid', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'donate', 'charity', 'do', 'go', 'advice', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'told', 'so']",Alone in the Dark

I had low expectations going into the film and found myself thinking it was good, if you also have low expectations for Alone in the Dark then you might enjoy it. A couple a bad things about the film is that it is slow paced and pretty confusing film, along with Tara Reid being apart of the casting which did hurt the film. I am a fan of both Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff, so in my opinion that helped the film along with I did like the creatures designs but it is executed with bad CGI. I never played the game that it was based on so that didn't affect me from judging the film.I do like the action scenes it does have and I didn't mind the acting with the exception of Tara Reid. I don't think Uwe Boll is the worst director ever because I have to admit I enjoyed Alone in the Dark as well as House of the Dead which was Boll's first film.

First of all, Tara Reid is as annoying as usual in her role as archaeologist Aline Cedrac. Perhaps if she took off her top it would have made the movie a bit more watchable. Chrisitian Slater is an excellent actor. He does a fine job here as well. How he got sucked in to this role must have been the result of losing a bet..

His cases delve into the dark corners of the world, searching for truth in the occult remnants of ancient civilizations. Now, the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, archeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), and his bitter rival, government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it cannot kill you!""According to the character of Carnby, fear of the dark is what keeps us alive. Sadly, however, fear of crappy movies doesn't keep us from renting them. Despite the horrible reviews, I decided to give into the temptation of renting Alone In The Dark (I had a free rental, so I figured there couldn't be much of a loss). It was even worse than I'd expected...For one, the creatures that are unleashed from the depths of darkness -- or whatever cliche horse feces is shoveled around in the story -- are pathetic CGI dino-beasts. Anything interesting, frightening, or even simply ""cool"" about them? Nope. Just pointless computer-generated monsters that fail at entertaining the audience in the slightest way. For two, the acting is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid on the DVD's main credits made me roll my eyeballs, but seeing her attempt to act as an archeologist in a sci-fi action flick just made me laugh. The only half-way decent acting is given by Christian Slater, but it's still not enough to cover up for the rest. And for three, the movie is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh sure, a few unknown bumps here and there, some creatures flashing across the screen, and a little gore is included. But true action? Very little. The small amounts of action it did include is the reason I gave this stinker two stars. I hate to see a movie suffer, but this one deserves it.In conclusion, don't make the same mistakes most of these reviewers made by renting the movie, knowing how terrible it must be.

Yet, having never seen an Uwe Boll's creation I was curious, and thought that at only $3.00 I wouldn't lose much. Also, it was supposed to be so incredibly pathetically awful that I became eager to discover this contender for "" world's worst movie"". In that respect I was sorely disappointed: Alone in the Dark is an honest B horror picture, and certainly hardly half as bad as purported to be by so many.Certainly it is not on par with Alien, but in such a comparison the overwhelming majority of science fiction horror films fall short. As with most horror flicks, one should not expect a masterpiece of world cinema nor an Academy Award winner. Alone in the Dark is not a masterpiece and never pretends that it could ever be one, but it is certainly not an awful movie, nor even a bad movie in this genre. It works well for what it was supposed to do: provide 96 minutes of escapism.Unlike many reviewers, I found Alone in the Dark coherent, never lacking in continuity, easy to follow and understand (but then I never needed Dune to be explained to me by a flyer!), suspenseful, fast-paced and attention grabbing; I was never bored a second.The flashbacks illustrate adequately all connections with the past, and they are very intriguing in themselves. The close combat scenes are fascinating and perfectly choreographed. The creatures are quite impressive and disquieting if not absolutely original; one will also notice a definite Starship Troopers' influence in the combats between creatures and 713 agents, but it doesn't spoil anything. The sets are completely satisfactory and perfectly complement the action. The special effects are flawless and well worth being replayed several times. All of which is highly laudable when one remembers that it was a very modest budget movie. The twist and turns of the story, although not always unpredictable, work sufficiently well to let one go with the flow. The ending might leave some a little bewildered or unsatisfied, but it has its own logic and I respect that. This is a movie that some time from now I will watch again with pleasure.The extras or special features are numerous and very interesting. I will be looking for other titles by Uwe Boll. I certainly do not regret having bought Alone in the Dark and not having let myself be deterred by the negative criticism; to amateurs of unpretentious honest horror B movies I would definitely recommend it.",3,A fine horror flick for a rainy night.,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2654,"['am', 'loss', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'bashing', 'movie', 'so', 'rabidly.I', 'looked', 'up', 'reviews', 'watching', 'movie', 'were', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'negative', 'almost', 'decided', 'return', 'Big', 'Lots', 'get', '3.00', 'back', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'creation', 'was', 'curious', 'thought', 'only', '3.00', 'would', ""n't"", 'lose', 'much', 'Also', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'incredibly', 'pathetically', 'awful', 'became', 'eager', 'discover', 'contender', 'world', 'worst', 'movie', 'respect', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'honest', 'B', 'horror', 'picture', 'certainly', 'hardly', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'purported', 'be', 'so', 'many.Certainly', 'not', 'par', 'Alien', 'such', 'comparison', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'films', 'fall', 'short', 'most', 'horror', 'flicks', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'world', 'cinema', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'never', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'one', 'certainly', 'not', 'awful', 'movie', 'even', 'bad', 'movie', 'genre', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'provide', '96', 'minutes', 'escapism.Unlike', 'many', 'reviewers', 'found', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'coherent', 'never', 'lacking', 'continuity', 'easy', 'follow', 'understand', 'then', 'never', 'needed', 'Dune', 'be', 'explained', 'flyer', 'suspenseful', 'fast-paced', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'second.The', 'flashbacks', 'illustrate', 'adequately', 'connections', 'past', 'are', 'very', 'intriguing', 'close', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'fascinating', 'perfectly', 'choreographed', 'creatures', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'disquieting', 'not', 'absolutely', 'original', 'one', 'will', 'also', 'notice', 'definite', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'influence', 'combats', 'creatures', '713', 'agents', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'sets', 'are', 'completely', 'satisfactory', 'perfectly', 'complement', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'flawless', 'well', 'worth', 'being', 'replayed', 'several', 'times', 'highly', 'laudable', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'modest', 'budget', 'movie', 'twist', 'turns', 'story', 'not', 'always', 'unpredictable', 'work', 'sufficiently', 'well', 'let', 'one', 'go', 'flow', 'ending', 'might', 'leave', 'little', 'bewildered', 'unsatisfied', 'own', 'logic', 'respect', 'movie', 'time', 'now', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'pleasure.The', 'extras', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'numerous', 'very', 'interesting', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'other', 'titles', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'having', 'bought', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'not', 'having', 'let', 'be', 'deterred', 'negative', 'criticism', 'amateurs', 'unpretentious', 'honest', 'horror', 'B', 'movies', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",Alone in the Dark

I actually heard how bad this movie was, and was warned from watching it, but curiosity got the better of me, so I picked it up anyway and decided to see why people ditched this movie so much. I have seen a lot of awful movies, but after watching `Alone in the Dark' I can easily say that it is the most pathetic thing that I have seen ever!The story is about Edward Carnby, who doesn't remember his childhood, but remembers that something really bad happened to him at this orphanage as a child. Somehow, since he can see the dead sometimes, he just knows it has something to do with the Abkani (even though he doesn't tell us why), so he goes after searching for the artifacts in various continents. Another guy called Hudgens is after the artifacts too, for some other reason, I'm guessing to probably control the world or something, and he has to get it first before Carnby does. What follows later is just a lot of running in the dark, and a lot of shooting.After watching the whole movie, I still do not understand the concept of the movie! Some of the MANY  questions that came up in my head were:1) Where did that mad scientist, Hudgens, even get those parasites like creatures from anyway?2) They go all the way trying to find out the missing pieces of the Abkani artifacts and in the end, they don't want to open the door (even though Carnby feels like all the answers to his life are on the other side), so what is the point of collecting it in the first place? But since the door opens anyway due to other reasons, why do they go in, when they know that they shouldn't? And they didn't even know that Hudgens was behind the operation, so it's not like they were trying to stop him from collecting the artifacts!3) And finally, HOW does Carnby know that he has to go after the Abkani artifacts? I mean, he mentions in the beginning that his entire memory of the orphanage is erased, so how does he know the answers lie in the artifacts or that it has something to do with the Abkani in the first place?!? Ok so he can see creatures in the dark, but so can Tara Reid when it attacks her in the museum! What is going on? And let's not forget something that he mentions in the beginning of the movie ""My name is Edward Carnby, and I am here to protect you from the things that you don't believe in""...WHO is he talking to (and if it is to the audience, what does that have to do with the story??)Apart from the senseless storyline that raises more questions than answers (and makes you feel like slapping yourself for wasting your time), the CGI of this movie is really bland and nothing new! I mean, the scene where Carnby fires the bullets on Pinkerton, we've seen that in every other James Bond intro titles, and the creatures looks just like something taken from the alien/predator films! Christian Slater didn't act so badly, but his role was bad enough to begin with. Tara Reid was simply awful! I liked her in `Josie and the Pussycats', but this is just not her. I don't even want to go through how bad the rest of the cast was, since that will probably take more than a few hundred words.

The setting up of the bad creatures sucked, the cg wasn't great, the characters were one dimenshional (but not bad for one dimenshional), prior relationships among characters are just thrown in left and right, one of the bad guys comes out of nowhere, the ending sucked, the film wants us to think we know these characters when we don't, characters get killed off screen after being prominant for the last few minutes, the film poorly transitions between major story marks and the scene showing the layer of the creatures was a clear ripoff of event horizon.Still, I had just enough enjoyment of bad action to give it two stars.

893385,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0007XBM5W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 7]","Alone in the Dark (Uwe Boll, 2005)Will someone in Hollywood eventually realize that Uwe Boll is utterly incapable of making a good movie? More to the point, that he's utterly incapable of making even a bad horror film? His action films are mediocre, but if you're filming horror videogames, perhaps you should look for a horror director, not an action director.After being blindsided by the mindless-action fare that was House of the Dead, I at least managed to have an idea of what I was in store for with this schlockfest, though I did hold out some hope that a much higher-powered cast this time round would help Boll at least make a decent action film. No such luck.Christian Slater stars as Edward Carnby, intrepid hunter of things that go bump in the night. Tara Reid is his girlfriend, Aline Cedrac, the stereotypically sexy bookworm holed up in the museum all the time (unless, of course, she's either having sex with the male lead or getting herself into some sort of danger). Stephen Dorff plays Richard Burke, a commander in the paranormal investigation team of which Carnby was recently a member. They're trying to find out what sort of odd, nasty monster is loose in the world and, of course, stop it.Now, there's enough here to make a half-decent movie. Instead, what Boll delivers, much like he did in House of the Dead, is a mishmash, of other, better films. Those who have seen, especially, Resident Evil and Pitch Black will see a lot of similarities not just in the substance of the shots, but in the way those shots are set up. There wasn't an original thought in Boll's head the whole time he was making this movie. Even if Mastai (the writer on this project with the most experience-- his most famous script before this was for MVP: Most Valuable Primate II) had delivered a script that were actually worth anything, Boll would have found a way to screw it up.Even though I should know better by now, I know I'm going to get sucked in again. Boll's next project, BloodRayne, scored the twin coups of getting both Michelle Rodriguez and Sir Ben Kingsley, either of whom could act rings around any ten actors in previous Boll releases. After that, he's got a Dungeon Siege adaptation coming out whose cast makes all three of the aforementioned Boll pics look like shoddy crapfests where all the actors were no-names working for half-scale. (Well, okay, House of the Dead was. But the point stands.). I know both are going to disappoint me just as terribly as this did. But, unfortunately, I keep seeing Boll movies like I keep not moving out of the country when we elect morons; they keep promising, and I keep hoping that someday they will actually deliver. Alone in the Dark fails spectacularly. *",1,Craptacular!,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,2719,"['Alone', 'Dark', 'Uwe', 'Boll', '2005', 'Will', 'someone', 'Hollywood', 'eventually', 'realize', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'utterly', 'incapable', 'making', 'good', 'movie', 'More', 'point', 'utterly', 'incapable', 'making', 'even', 'bad', 'horror', 'film', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'mediocre', ""'re"", 'filming', 'horror', 'videogames', 'perhaps', 'should', 'look', 'horror', 'director', 'not', 'action', 'director.After', 'being', 'blindsided', 'mindless-action', 'fare', 'was', 'House', 'Dead', 'least', 'managed', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'schlockfest', 'did', 'hold', 'out', 'hope', 'much', 'higher-powered', 'cast', 'time', 'round', 'would', 'help', 'Boll', 'least', 'make', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'such', 'luck.Christian', 'Slater', 'stars', 'Edward', 'Carnby', 'intrepid', 'hunter', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'girlfriend', 'Aline', 'Cedrac', 'stereotypically', 'sexy', 'bookworm', 'holed', 'up', 'museum', 'time', 'course', 'having', 'sex', 'male', 'lead', 'getting', 'sort', 'danger', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Richard', 'Burke', 'commander', 'paranormal', 'investigation', 'team', 'Carnby', 'was', 'recently', 'member', ""'re"", 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'sort', 'odd', 'nasty', 'monster', 'loose', 'world', 'course', 'stop', 'it.Now', 'enough', 'here', 'make', 'half-decent', 'movie', 'Instead', 'what', 'Boll', 'much', 'did', 'House', 'Dead', 'mishmash', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'especially', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'will', 'see', 'lot', 'similarities', 'not', 'just', 'substance', 'shots', 'way', 'shots', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'thought', 'Boll', 'head', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'Even', 'Mastai', 'writer', 'project', 'most', 'experience', 'most', 'famous', 'script', 'was', 'MVP', 'Most', 'Valuable', 'Primate', 'II', 'had', 'delivered', 'script', 'were', 'actually', 'worth', 'anything', 'Boll', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'screw', 'up.Even', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'now', 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'sucked', 'again', 'Boll', 'next', 'project', 'BloodRayne', 'scored', 'twin', 'coups', 'getting', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'either', 'whom', 'could', 'act', 'rings', 'ten', 'actors', 'previous', 'Boll', 'releases', 'got', 'Dungeon', 'Siege', 'adaptation', 'coming', 'out', 'cast', 'three', 'aforementioned', 'Boll', 'pics', 'look', 'shoddy', 'crapfests', 'where', 'actors', 'were', 'no-names', 'working', 'half-scale', 'Well', 'okay', 'House', 'Dead', 'was', 'point', 'stands.', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'disappoint', 'just', 'as', 'terribly', 'did', 'unfortunately', 'keep', 'seeing', 'Boll', 'movies', 'keep', 'not', 'moving', 'country', 'when', 'elect', 'morons', 'keep', 'promising', 'keep', 'hoping', 'someday', 'will', 'actually', 'deliver', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'spectacularly', '*']",Alone in the Dark

This all basically means that some will hate it, some will enjoy it.The most extreme comment I had read against the film was booms and other gear in shot; well, where does this occur? I never saw this in the theatre, and not in the DVD. The only ""error"" that is visible in the DVD, is the wire removal sequences where the pull of the wire is left in, and the wire is gone. A trivial criticism.The film works as a slow develop up to about 40 minutes, then  fires on all cylinders in the last half hour. So, if you get angry about the slow and detailed development of the story, then you miss the best scenes which have an awesome lovecraftian feel.The DVD  bonuses are very good. The BEHIND THE SCENES and the FX featurettes are very good, and the commentary by Uwe Boll is very good: Tells  a lot about the movie as well as the making of the movie. Also, Uwe's opinion about the film release tactics for films around the time of release of ALONE IN THE DARK, and how they affect the run of the film ALONE IN THE DARK. It's a very good and open commentary about the film.OVERALL: Its a fun popcorn film( which in many respects goes beyond the popcorn style of film), its exciting, and the bonuses are great DVD  fare.

Uwe Boll's perception of an ideal horror/action flick is putrid!For starters, the film makes absolutely no sense at all (the best you'll get out of a storyline is the three minute read intro) & constantly jumps from scene to scene (one moment, Slater's on a plane, the next he's involved in a Taxi Cab chase/collision).  The battle sequences are downright laughable.  You'll frequently be seeing humans interacting with CGI monsters for the remainder of the film.Come to think of it, the film doesn't have a single positive trait (except for when it ends) just a bunch of bloody-senseless action, comprised with CGI effects to supposedly live true to the game's original essence (or at least in Boll's lethargic eyes).  The film brings absolutely nothing new to the table & is simply painful to watch.What's really baffling is how (after watching the behind-the-scenes footage) the film's producers actually thought they were crafting something phenomenal when developing the movie.  Slater himself stressed as to how much of a ""Masterpiece"" the film would expectedly turn out to be (the film was supposedly to place his ill-faded career back on the map) for he was very passionate about taking part in AITD.

893400,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0007XBM5W,Terry Mesnard,"[12, 16]","Uwe Boll is systematically trying to ruin the videogame to movie path.  I decided to give it a chance after seeing the horribly abysmal House of the Dead due to the lower budget and the fact that the game House of the Dead had no plot, so why should the movie.  However, this new movie has a bigger budget and a more capable cast.  Yet the results are the same.  Uwe Boll is turning into a modern day Ed Wood--except much less interesting.  Hey, at least Ed Wood wore Cashmere.Alone in the Dark marked the start of the survival horror genre in video games.  While Resident Evil is often credited with it, the truth is that Alone in the Dark came first.  Resident Evil just made it popular.  My problem with the movie comes from the simple fact that Uwe Boll ignored everything Alone in the Dark had to offer and instead relied on a silly sleep-walking/zombie plot that involved blowing everything up in silly sparkly explosions.Here is where Uwe Boll first went wrong.  The original concept of Alone in the Dark was to be just that:  ALONE in the dark.  The movie would have been much more scary and intense if it were only a set group of people surviving against the horrors that lurk in the dark around them.  A group of people surviving with limited ammo and only a flashlight to help them (sorta like Pitch Black) would have been immensely rewarding and a TRUTHFUL adaptation of the video game.Instead we have a task force that seems to have radar and cameras all over the world and can have a task force to the trouble area quicker than you can say crappy movie cliche.  They show up just in the nick of time at least 2-3 times in the movie, spoiling any sense of tension.  The movie quickly goes from a quasi-interesting plot involving H.P. Lovecraft themes (which the game is based from) and turns into a bullets flying miasma.On top of that, it's just plain silly.  Sleep-walkers who become white-faced zombies who hiss, moan and generally act stupidly (and who also look like rejects from Uwe Boll's first video game movie House of the Dead)?  Monsters who can become invisible but would rather run into the light and stay in sight so they can be shot at?  Explosions that look like they belong in an episode of Power Rangers?  Action that is neither interesting nor exciting?  You too can have all this and $8 ripped from your hands if you go see this movie.I think the most telling part of how ignorant Uwe Boll is of his audience comes directly from his mouth.  In a recent interview with IGN, Uwe Boll states that audiences can't follow a more complicated plot than what happened in Alone in the Dark, that (quote): ""if the movie has two plots or something, if a movie gets a little complicated, then it's too much for the audience.""  I think this is very telling of Uwe Boll as a director and what he believes of his intended audience.  He has since decided to pick up the rights to a good 5-6 QUALITY video games.  Be afraid, be very afraid.Not that video game movies have to be oscar worthy performances, but sticking close to the source material would be nice.  Stick with the game and don't support Uwe Boll's systematic destruction of video game movies.

Even Lara Croft was only two-dimensional, whereas the characters in ALONE IN THE DARK, and every other videogame based movie, are barely one-dimensional.That's one reason ALONE IN THE DARK is so BOOOOOOOORRIIING!  Cardboard non-characters that just move from level to level, pointlessly killing monsters.  (My God, how far Christian Slater has fallen since he showed so much promise in HEATHERS! -- and Tara Reid in this film was just dreadful; vapid and empty and one-dimensional and just so boring to watch and listen to).Apart from the thin characters, ALONE IN THE DARK has no real story.  A long expository monologue fills us in on the background (things already known to game players but unknown to film viewers).  Then it's off to a pointless non-story as characters kill monsters in each new setting, just like in a video game.  No real story, or theme, or developing characterizations.And the monsters and ""scary scenes"" are so cliche-ridden, things we've seen in so many other films.  The dark museum with an artifact/monster brought to life, which museum is suddenly then invaded by SWAT teams -- RELIC already did it.  The mountain of skulls lining the cave walls -- JEEPERS CREAPERS had it, to name just one film.As for bloopers, you have a SWAT team leader going underground, leaving his men above ground.

Yes, Uwe Boll has become the Ed Wood of the 2000's with only two video-game films to his name.  (From what I understand, he has purchased rights to several more).  If you think Uwe Boll's ""House of the Dead"" was bad, you are in for a huge surprise.There is so much wrong with this movie, I don't know where to start.  First of all, the casting director that had the idea to use Tara Reid as an archaeologist should be banned from Hollywood.  The creatures blatantly rip off those in ""Pitch Black"", and my three-year-old daughter's Curious George book has a deeper story than this pile of dung.Christian Slater plays a paranormal investigator that teams up with his archaeologist ex-girlfriend and a rival government agent to solve a mystery stemming from his past.  This movie is much too bad to compare to the X-Files, and almost too bad to compare to the Sci-Fi channel's original movies.

893410,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007XBM5W,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","The film is terrible, but you know that already. The thing is, I'm not complaining about the ridiculous costume of Tara Reid as archeologist wearing tight pants. That part I can really love. The film is based on a video game, but that' s OK with me. I love `Tomb Raiders,' its silliness and all. The real problem is that `Alone in the Dark' is no fun to watch. Some films provide us with the `so bad so good' fun; this one doesn't. All you can see is an incredibly dull Grade B horror picture that goes on more than 90 minutes without knowing where to go.Christian Slater is a treasure hunting hero who wants to be an Indiana Jones. Well, it seems like that because his character is chased by an assassin who follows and tries to kill him. After showing the so-so stunt works including the brief car chase and kung-fu kicking, the film goes on to the next chapter without letting us know enough about the situation.Never mind, because anyway you stop caring. There is a certain set of established rules about telling a story in moviemaking, but director Uwe Boll ignore everything. Continuity and editing? No such thing. Character and its motive? No such luck. Convincing production designs? Nothing. After the initial 15 minutes, dullness settles in. Who is the boy escaping from the institute? What is this government agency investigating the paranormal phenomena? Why open the door that leads to the forbidden world in the first place? No one in the film seems to know, not even the director.And the action sequences are utterly thrill-free experience. The creatures are mostly cheaply done, and the soldiers shooting them look quite uncomfortable because the actors know they are only pretending to shoot. What is the point of making least exciting shooting scenes when the film is inspired by a shooting game?One more thing, and I'm done. Three principle characters are played by Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff. Now, I want to say, ""What are they doing in this career killer?"" Someone, please, someone, send them a better script before it's too late. Isn't John Woo available now?For most of the people `Alone in the Dark' would be instantly the worst film they have ever seen. Some may claim, understandably, that there are Ed Wood films. Ed's films are certainly cheesy and amateurish, but still his films are actually fun to see (depending on the definition of fun, of course), and its badness is somehow lovable. `Alone in the Dark' is, sadly, not even that.",1,Terrible.

He does the best he can with the script he was given, but still it is a movie based on a video game that should have stayed a video game.

So my recommendation is that you save your hard earned money (and an hour and a half of your life) for another movie.QUICK SYNOPSISEdward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator and ex-member of a government run paranormal response team called 713.
