954529,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000C20VVE,A Customer,"[0, 2]","Justin Cobb (Lou Pucci) is a moody and troubled boy. At seventeen, he lacks confidence, is prone to panic attacks, and has a short attention span. Most disturbing, is that after all these years, he still sucks his thumb, much to the alarm of his father, Mike (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mike, once a college football star now sidelined by a knee injury, lives with his lovely wife Audrey (Tilda Swinton) in a roomy home on the outskirts of Portland Oregon.Audrey is a registered nurse obsessed with a TV heartthrob (Benjamin Bratt), whom she's determined to meet up with. She loves Justin dearly, but she's concerned about his lack of ability to fit in with other students. Mike is also concerned, but he remains emotionally distant, leaving Audrey to shoulder most of the family's burdens.  And Justin is to self-preoccupied to regard his resilient and independent younger brother Joel (Chase Offerle) anything other than a nuisance.His new age, stringy haired orthodontist Dr. Lyman (Keanu Reeves) suggests that Justin may be able to conquer his penchant for thumb sucking though hypnosis therapy and instructs Justin to draw strength from his ""power animal."" But it doesn't work, and the young Justin becomes even more irascible. In desperation, the school board following the advice of Mr. Geary his debating coach (Vince Vaughan) puts Justin on the drug Ritalin.Geary declares that Justin, though bright, is doing poorly in school because he suffers from attention-deficit disorder. Now swallowing back pills at a moments notice, Justin is transformed into a confident achiever, a master debater, articulate, fluent and conceited; he even turns into a debate champion. But his newfound success and self-belief comes at a price. Prone to bouts of anger, Justin not only alienates his family, but also must come to terms with his inner-demons and those of his parents. He eventually realizes that the ""answer"" is that there is no one answer.Thumbsucker is well acted and nicely directed, with Pucci, who appears in almost every scene, giving the film a much-needed edge. There's also the commanding Ms. Swinton, whose formidable acting talents are more than well on display here. But the film seriously lacks dramatic heft; it plays Jason's self-discovery and ultimate redemption as some kind of profound insight, when in reality it's all really quite banal and rather perfunctory.Occasionally amusing and intermittently engaging, Thumbsucker just lacks the necessary bite to make it compelling entertainment. Whilst the thematic elements are well-intentioned with a main character who learns that ""normal"" is a myth and that people's flaws are what makes them human, the story is quite dull and for some reason has little emotional pull.There have been so many movies made over the last few years about dysfunctional myopic middle-class families ensnared in constricted lives in conventional suburbia, the Chumscrubber being the most recent.  About the only new angle here is the thumb sucking which is obviously a metaphor for psychological disturbances over identity issues and feelings of inadequacy.There's no doubt that Thumbsucker has noble aims, and it has a nicely naturalistic feel that makes you really believe that this is a real family living today in suburban America, dealing with real issues, but the efforts towards satire whilst broaching serious subjects like the pressures put on young people today, and the need to conform, comes across as rather tired, stale, and obligatory.

Lou Taylor Pucci nails his difficult role as, well, the titular thumbsucker. His portrayal of a character slowly emerging as more than just another close-mouthed adolescent is fascinating. (Er, make that another ""sullen"" adolescent.) In fact, the whole cast, delivers the goods. Against all odds, Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as a deadpan and shamanesque orthodontist. And even Vince Vaughan (who I usually find untalented and somewhat repellent) is amusing as the faux-cerebral debate coach.3.) Director Mike Mills takes a patient and open approach to this semi-strange story. The movie is funny and absurd, but the characters don't seem to realize this. The result is a film that becomes downright magical at times.NOTE: Please don't let the film's less-than-market-savvy title keep you away.",5,"You don't need your thumb, and your thumb doesn't need you.",1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,928,"['have', 'number', 'reasons', 'liking', 'excellent', 'film:1', 'based', 'novel', 'gifted', 'witty', 'writer', 'Walter', 'Kirn.2', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'difficult', 'role', 'well', 'titular', 'thumbsucker', 'portrayal', 'character', 'slowly', 'emerging', 'more', 'just', 'close-mouthed', 'adolescent', 'fascinating', 'Er', 'make', 'sullen', 'adolescent', 'fact', 'whole', 'cast', 'goods', 'Against', 'odds', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'deadpan', 'shamanesque', 'orthodontist', 'even', 'Vince', 'Vaughan', 'who', 'usually', 'find', 'untalented', 'somewhat', 'repellent', 'amusing', 'faux-cerebral', 'debate', 'coach.3', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'patient', 'open', 'approach', 'semi-strange', 'story', 'movie', 'funny', 'absurd', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'result', 'film', 'downright', 'magical', 'times.NOTE', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'film', 'less-than-market-savvy', 'title', 'keep', 'away']",N/A

954532,A1VE6V339DU1L9,B000C20VVE,B. Wheeler,"[0, 0]","I just watched ""Thumbsucker"" and I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that a movie about a 17 year old kid that sucks his thumb would be really awkward to watch. But actually... Okay you're right. Watching a 17 year old kid suck his thumb is a little weird. But the thumb sucking part doesn't really last too long. The movie is about Justin Cobb (Played by a very good Lou Taylor Pucci.) and his journey through his last year of high school. There are girls, there are drugs, there's a debate team and there's even a (Slightly creepy.) orthodontist played by Keanu Reeves. And if this sounds like sort of standard teen-angst independent movie fair, well, that's because it's sort of standard teen-angst independent movie fair. It is, however, well written, well shot, nicely edited and boasts an outstanding cast. Vincent D'Onorfio (Didn't know the name but recognized the face.) and Tilda Swinton (Who's always good.) are great as Justin's parents and Vince Vaughn does a very solid, understated turn as the teacher who leads the debate team. (I would also mention that Kelli Garner is very sexy as the girl Justin has a crush on but since she's playing 17 and I'm a middle aged man it would be kind of creepy. So I'm just going to let it go.) So all in all? This is pretty good movie.",4,A Boy.  A Girl.

954533,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000C20VVE,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","I HEART BROKEN that Thumbsucker kind of dissipated like a diaphanous mist at the end instead of tying the ribbons into a perfect bow, but there is so much good stuff going on that maybe I HEART BROKEN that it had to end at all.First, let me say that new comer Lou Taylor Pucci as Thumbsucker Justin Cobb really carried the film with a subtle, nuanced performance, resisting the urge to overact. There was quite a connection with his mother, Audrey Cobb (Tilda Swinton). I'll get to that later, but there seemed to be not only a physical resemblance, but they were also connected on some kind of mental/spiritual plane as well--in spite of some inappropriate and embarrassing behavior on Audrey's part. Even their father, Mike Cobb (Vincent D'Onofrio) comments at one point that he ""never knows what you two are thinking."" I, however, know exactly what he was thinking; that they were two peas in a pod.The plot is basically a coming of age saga, but it takes so many twists and turns--there's the thumbsucking; hypnosis from his orthodontist, Dr. Perry Lyman (Keanu Reeves); but then there is Ritalin, which leads to him becoming a master debater; and tied up with that there is his first love Rebecca (Kelli Garner), first heart break; and worries that his mother may be having an affair with popular actor Matt Schramm (Benjamin Bratt), or at the very least concern that she is extremely unhappy in her marriage, and there are lots of problems relating to his father, an ex jock bitter about the athletic career he might have had, who puts a lot of pressure on him to be a winner; and then finally, there is him trying to get into college, not to mention the dream sequences. Through all the ch-ch-ch-ch-changes that Justin Cobb goes through, Lou Taylor Pucci is right there.Audrey Cobb wants to enter a contest to win a dream date with Matt Schramm. She enlists the aid of Justin, who up until now has been her co-conspirator, but she has crossed a line and he just doesn't feel comfortable helping her write an essay on why her mother, who is married to her father, should go on a dream date with a cheesy actor, nor does he enjoy helping her choose a seductive outfit for the photo, especially when he has to help her zip it up from the back. Kids. Go figure. Tilda Swinton relishes these kinds of complicated roles, and the Oscar winning actress is fabulous here, as the part really suits her quirky brand of talent.Dr. Perry Lyman is Justin's orthodontist, but he thinks of himself as more than that, a shaman, perhaps, and indeed, sensing that Justin is a thumbsucker, he tries some very unorthodox treatment. It is all very hippy-dippy, even lighting incense, and having Justin gaze at the moon in his wolf painting while he puts him into a hypnotic trance. He suggests that Justin choose a power animal to be his protector and solace whenever he feels anxious or afraid.-------------------------Justin Cobb: What's your power animal?Dr. Perry Lyman: That's personal.================================================Keanu Reeves is the perfect choice to play Dr. Perry Lyman. There was recently a photo series of Mr. Reeves in various roles, and through them all he maintained that stone face. Who better to play Klaatu in the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still? Gort! Klaatu barada nikto! Stone-faced Reeves plays his Dr. Lyman part, but it is also a very clever self parody of the kind of roles he plays. He gives Justin a post-hypnotic suggestion that makes his thumb taste like Echinacea.He stops sucking his thumb, but without thumbsucking all his pressures build and he has no outlet. He is like Linus denied his security blanket. He starts acting out and the school counselor prescribes Ritalin. This seems to help--at first. He reads Moby Dick in a single night, and then, in the debating team which he only joined to get close to Rebecca, he starts to excel, becoming a master debater.Mr. Geary (Vince Vaughn) is pleased that his youthful ward has stepped up to the plate now that Rebecca has left the Debate Club. Indeed, Justin was so smitten by Rebecca that he wouldn't even debate her. He agreed with her, causing Mr. Geary to say, 'this is Debate Club, not Agree Club.' Vince Vaughn has created a great character. You just know he is gay, but he keeps it well hidden. It is like a parody of a kind of teacher who wants to help his students achieve their full potential, especially if that includes sleep overs while competing in State Wide Debate Matches. As Justin becomes a force to reckon with on the Debate scene, he crosses over the line, winning at any cost. Besides, the Ritalin is starting to catch up to him. His lucid and well thought out arguments are starting to dissolve into meaningless gibberish. Mr. Geary is only too happy to throw him under the bus, as he has become a liability and a threat to his career in academia, for instance if that six pack he gave the team to unwind with becomes public knowledge, his teaching career would be toast.-----------------------Mr. Geary: It's my professional opinion that you've become a monster.=======================================Justin's little brother, Joel Cobb (Chase Offerle), has a beef with him too. It seems with all his teen trauma drama, it leaves little room for him to chase off his own heebie jeebies:------------------------------------Joel Cobb: You ever think maybe you're so busy being weird, that I have to step up and be normal?=========================================================Vincent D'Onofrio perhaps doesn't have the plum role, since he is almost the heavy in the oedipal drama that is Thumbsucker. Still, though he isn't the most sympathetic character, and has to be the enforcer of the 'No Thumb Sucking Zone' he has his own issues, and even dumb jocks sometimes earn our sympathy if their leg is broken and a promising career in athletics is struck down in its prime. Once we get to know Mike, we are sorry to see him go. Likewise, he to Justin:------------------Mike Cobb: [on hearing Justin's going away to college] I was just... getting used to you.===========================================On the other end of the spectrum, Benjamin Bratt has perhaps the best role of all, besides the leading man slot. Maybe he is the leading man, at least with regards to Audrey Cobb. But what I like about Bratt is he gets to do a parody of himself, as the empathetic police officer in TV cop shows who is so politically correct and sensitive to the diverse nature of the population he has promised to protect and serve. But then, Bratt (or Schramm, the Bratt parody he plays) shows his all too human side, a hopeless drug addict. When he tries to sneak his stash into rehab it results in an all too embarrassing incident. Hey, who hasn't been there? Anyway, after all the cheesy roles he's played, all the 'man sandwich' Razzie award winning boyfriends, this is his chance to skewer our perceptions of him and show his human frailty and vulnerability. Bravo for Benjamin Bratt. It's all about the Benjamin.Kelli Garner gave perhaps the best performance of all. I've saved the best for last. Sometimes as she read her lines, she was kind of like the mature beyond her years would be girlfriend if only she didn't see through your immaturity, but perhaps a little two-dimensional, burdened as she was with the weight of the script's aspiration for profundity. But when she would just give her little winks and those flirtatious facial expressions, she was totally in character. A revelation was she. Also, she was the main and completely understandable reason why I HEART BROKEN. Hey, I just want to experiment with you. Who hasn't been there?One more thing: the music is well integrated into the whole cinematic Thumbsucker experience, and there are some songs by the late Elliot Smith that seem as if they were composed especially for Thumbsucker, but that is preposterous, because he was dead (of suicide?) long before this film was made.I didn't think I was going to like Thumbsucker, but I was so very wrong. I mean, a movie about a guy who can't stop sucking his thumb? But it was so well done, and really, more about the crazy pressure of life, felt most acutely when we are going through a hormone addled adolescence. Who hasn't been there?--------------------Dr. Perry Lyman: There's only so much I can do with traditional orthodontics. Justin, are you ready to let go of your thumb?Justin Cobb: Why are you talking like that?=====================================LOU TAYLOR PUCCIThe Chumscrubber(2005) ....

The story was adapted from an autobiographical 1999 novel by Walter Kirn, and while it is uniformly well acted the basic problem is that it is yet in another of the series of `American suburbia is hell' films. Given the last few years of terrorism and war this simply does not resonate as strongly as it did a decade or so ago, and even then the horrors of being well-fed, having a good roof over one's head, and having to listen to one's parents was, to say the least, a tad overdone.But, the thing that is missing is the screenplay. Having not read the novel I have to put the blame on filmmaker Mills. There is just something a bit too ABC Afterschool Special or Doogie Howser about this film. Yes, drugs are bad, and life is tough for a teenager. So? This is where the failings of the script come in, because once the film was over, I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters, unlike, say, the flawed but better Mean Creek, or even a weaker film like Igby Goes Down. As good as Pucci is there is a blandness to him that any of the Culkin actor boys does not have. One can believe that those kids, with their slightly inbred looks and glassy eyes, really do suffer in silence, as they say. Pucci, well, he's just too white bread and charmed. And things like cute girls who catch you sucking your thumb on an airplane and then flirting with you do not occur. Also, the scenes with his parents, when Justin is about to go off to college, are just a wee too precious, with tears welling in the eyes. This is where the film really goes ABC Afterschool Special, and hits the viewer over the head with the message that life is about suffering and growing. To emphasize the point, Mills even has Perry Lyman return to say these very things before Justin leaves. And even though hi scharacter seems to have gotten over his hippy phrase, he still tosses off bon mots like, `The trick is living without an answer.' Whoa, dude....that's heavy, like. Note to Mills: condescension is never a good thing in the arts.

I half-way expected it perhaps to form a cinematic trilogy about icky teen problems, along the lines of ""Thumbsucker"" + ""Nosepicker"" + ""Buttscratcher"".  I was envisaging ""Thumbsucker"" to be akin to John Waters` ""Cry Baby"" or ""Pecker"", or, on another hand, that wonderful pair of Bill & Ted movies of yore which Keanu Reeves (the New Age dentist in ""Thumbsucker"") made with Alex Winter, something along that line.The film is not that at all, but rather an endearing ""coming of age"" story of how an adolescent male transitioning from high school years to university overcomes the childhood regressive trait of the film`s title and, more significantly, a lot of other personal problems much more important than mere thumbsucking, gaining focus and self-assurance to realise his personal hopes and ambitions. The dentist, too, Keanu Reeves' character, comes to terms with his human limitations and grows on his own path in life, as do most of the personages in the movie.

Such is the case for THUMBSUCKER, a quiet little examination of the fragility of family life in the society we have created.  Other films such as this one include Pieces of April, The Chumscrubber, Junebug, In the Bedroom, The Mudge Boy, Mean Creek etc - films that take unpopular subjects and use that as a pivotal point for opening superficial wounds in the integument of family units.Adapted from the novel by Walter Kirn, screenwriter and new director Mike Mills introduces us to the Cobbs, a Portland, Oregon family of four, each with secrets or private problems that prevent them from functioning at full capacity: father Mike (Vincent D'Onofrio) fractured his knee at the brink of a brilliant football career and married Audrey (Tilda Swinton) who, lost in the routine of a boring life, works as  a nurse who fantasizes about a TV star Matt Schramm (Benjamin Bratt) to the point of entering contests to meet him; youngest son Joel (Chase Offerle) is not allowed a life in the household dominated by the bizarre behavior of older brother Justin (Lou Taylor Pucci) who is a chronic underachiever and geek and still sucks his  thumb at age 17!  Justin is the pivotal role, ashamed of his addiction to thumbsucking but unable to control it until his orthodontist Perry (Keanu Reeves) applies hippie hypnosis in aversion therapy, putting Justin in touch with his inner 'Power Animal'.  Justin's failing grades and bizarre behavior prompt the school psychologist to diagnose ADD and Justin begins to take Ritalin.  Pow!  Life changes: Justin becomes a star on the debate squad guided by teacher Mr. Geary (Vince Vaughn), finally is approached by a mixed up girl Rebecca (Kelli Garner) who even introduces him to pot. No longer sucking his thumb, Justin becomes a champ - and an arrogant overachiever!Audrey is assigned as RN to a drug rehab facility where one of her patients just happens to be Matt Schramm, her cocaine and multi-addicted actor/patient. Justin discovers his mother's connection to her fantasy as does Mike and the men of the family think Audrey is having an affair. Incidents occur which draw distant Mike and Justin together, solidify the close relationship of Audrey and Justin, and give Joel a special place of importance in the family.  The kinks are ironed out in a well-orchestrated ending.Not much of a story, but if the film is examined as a series of character developments, folks whose lives influence each other, provide changes in self perception and acceptance, and suggest that maturation is an ongoing matter of evolving, then the power of the movie is significant.  Each of the roles is filled by actors who surpass even their own standards: Tilda Swinton is amazing in the breadth of her emotional role; Lou Taylor Pucci may be only 20 years old but he is a dynamite actor; Vince Vaughn, Keanu Reeves, Benjamin Bratt and Vincent D'Onofrio - each out of their element - prove that given the right material they can produce subtle, nuanced performances.  Mike Mills directs with the manner that makes us feel as though he is giving his talented cast utter freedom to create while maintaining the reins on the flow of the story.  Outside of an obnoxious musical score that covers the lines of the actors whenever it is concurrent on the track there are few flaws.Yes, similar stories exist, and yes, the film could use some editing polish, but for a first film directing venture Mike Mills has a lot to say and orchestrates a fine cast in a memorable movie.  Recommended for those who appreciate little films that quietly move us.

""A New Yorker""","[0, 1]","I found ""ThumbSucker"" to be an emotionally honest film, but not tedious as the film looks for some outlandish opportunities thankfully. It seems a pretty confident debut for someone working with ""big"" names: Keanu's unorthodox orthodontist, Vincent D'Onofrio as a self-silencing sort with a hint Donald Sutherland maybe, Vince Vaughan still funny without banging on the funny bone and Tilda Swinton delivers a performance both lucid and opaque. Lastly Lou Pucci in the middle of it all with an earnest innocence that doesn't feel vapid. He works as an EveryBoy for me, plus the way his looks mimic Swintons (and the younger boy's mimic D'Onofrio I wonder if that was conscious casting??)There are some great lines in this film, two by Swinton in a pivotal scene, and actually Benjamin Bratt reveals those to us. D'Onofrio also says something like ""I'm just getting used to you"" at a crucial point, and that captures the sad fleeting nature of being a parent with doubt. Aside from parents, I also loved the dialog with the younger brother at the end of the film; a nice solipsism shattering scene, and probably one beloved by younger siblings the world round. And the three stages of Keanu are both funny and illuminating.The film may be a little slow to find itself, and on the commentary there was some conversation about how taboo thumbsucking is, so perhaps that has something to do with my initial reaction? Maybe thumbsucking is such a strong but subjugated symbol of mother-love, or a sort of surreally sensual one?? The film is lifted by humor (when not always expected, Vaughan applying mascara to a debate d&eacute;butante, he must of ad-libbed that??!?), yet the film is also riveted by relaxed-yet-focused performances by *everyone* (again a testament to Mike Mills the director).I do have to give a hand (or a thumb for that matter) to Lou Pucci who does a formidable job in his acting debut as Justin the Thumbsucker.

This is considered socially unacceptable behavior in a 17-year-old.  What's his problem?  What deep dark secret childhood trauma is causing him to do this?  There must be one...right?  Adults keep trying to intervene, but end up only making things worse.  Finally, he is put on Ritalin, which works wonders.  He becomes the genius star of the debate club.  There's only one drawback; as his debate coach (Vince Vaughn) puts it: ""In my professional opinion...you've become a monster.""Thumbsucker is one of those off-beat, coming-of-age movies...like Donnie Darko without the science fiction.  It chronicles the horrors and the humor of being seventeen and different.  The movie benefits from great performances.  At its heart is newcomer Lou Pucci, who manages to be off-putting or cute as the film requires.  He calls his parents by their first names.  His mother (Tilda Swinton) fantasizes about running away with a movie star and his father (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a jock who lives in the shadow of a ruined football career and who doesn't know what to make of his son.  Surprisingly, one of the best performances comes from Keanu Reeves, who almost plays a parody of himself; he is Justin's orthodontist, but he acts more like his psychiatrist.This movie will probably develop a cult following over the years.

He simply cannot stop sucking his thumb. As a teenager, this causes all sorts of undue anxiety. Everyone tries to help. His step-father writes his initials on the thumb, saying, and I paraphrase, ""There. Stop it for me."" His hippie orthodontist suggests finding a power animal, and later, attempts hypnosis. Eventually, pharmaceuticals, lust, and marijuana come into play as well. Somewhere in the middle of all this churning angst, the heat and suspense of Debate Club enters the picture. All actors involved with credible performances, particularly Keanu Reeves as the cigarette-smoking orthodontist and Kelli Garner as Justin's love interest whose ulterior motives are surprising and rather depressing: nerdy beauty-with-a-heart-of-gold she is not. Thumbsucker, upon its release along the surreal Chumbscrubber, was deemed by many to be the superior film. Years later, this holds true, though the film seems a touch slow in retrospect. Of course, the snail's pace is deliberate. This is a thoughtful, meditative film that focuses on character development more than furious plot-spanking action. Justin's plight is psychological and so the film which contains it dips occasionally into softly-lit philosophical territory--though the score from The Polyphonic Spree keeps things from getting too dour. Mike Mills shows himself to be a director of affability and poise, and this film is far more focused than his sprawling, depressive sophomore effort Beginners.

Igby and this thumbsucking kid were not funny; they are merely self-absorbed for no particular reason and thoroughly unlikeable.This movie deserves kudos for partially exposing the drug Ritalin as the societal blight that it is, but that's about the only positive thing to be said about it.The supporting cast is very talented, but their talent is largely wasted: For example, Vincent D'Onofrio is an extremely talented actor, but watching him in this movie, I felt sorry for him, and I wondered why he ever took the part: Although he is playing the role of a father and husband, practically all the script calls for him to do is to shrug his shoulders and grunt or let his mouth hang open in silent stupidity. Did they want D'Onofrio to reprise his Private Pyle character or what???Keanu Reeves's acting was a wooden as ever, but at least the part he played was initially interesting. However, this subplot, just like all plots and subplots of this movie, go nowhere.There is also an insidious theme of misandry running throughout this movie: Every single male character has some inherent attenuating flaw: D'Onofrio's character is a moron; Reeves's character is a space cadet; Vaughn's character is a teacher chaperoning on a field trip who books the same hotel room for both his male and female students, and then buys them alcohol!; Bratt's character is a drug addict; Pucci's character doesn't know what the heck he is--only Tilda Swinton's character stands alone as not suffering from any such flaw. She possesses wisdom, is capable of love and sacrifice, is successful, is heroic, is patient with her moronic husband, etc.So many movies evince a misandric theme like this these days, and I am getting sick of it.Basically--and you knew this was coming--thumbsucker sucks indeed.",1,Thumbsucker Sucks,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2136,"['Igby', 'Goes', 'Down', 'long', 'list', 'other', 'failed', 'teenage-angst', 'flicks', 'sucker', 'also', 'down', 'What', 'made', 'novel', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'such', 'success', 'was', 'teenage', 'protagonist', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'had', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'full', 'self-absorbed', 'angst', 'death', 'little', 'brother', 'Allie', 'also', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'was', 'funny', 'endearing', 'Igby', 'thumbsucking', 'kid', 'were', 'not', 'funny', 'are', 'merely', 'self-absorbed', 'particular', 'reason', 'thoroughly', 'unlikeable.This', 'movie', 'kudos', 'partially', 'exposing', 'drug', 'Ritalin', 'societal', 'blight', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'it.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'talented', 'talent', 'largely', 'wasted', 'example', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'extremely', 'talented', 'actor', 'watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'sorry', 'wondered', 'why', 'ever', 'took', 'part', 'playing', 'role', 'father', 'husband', 'practically', 'script', 'do', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'grunt', 'let', 'mouth', 'hang', 'open', 'silent', 'stupidity', 'Did', 'want', ""D'Onofrio"", 'reprise', 'Private', 'Pyle', 'character', 'what', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'acting', 'was', 'wooden', 'ever', 'least', 'part', 'played', 'was', 'initially', 'interesting', 'However', 'subplot', 'just', 'plots', 'subplots', 'movie', 'go', 'nowhere.There', 'also', 'insidious', 'theme', 'misandry', 'running', 'movie', 'single', 'male', 'character', 'inherent', 'attenuating', 'flaw', ""D'Onofrio"", 'character', 'moron', 'Reeves', 'character', 'space', 'cadet', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'teacher', 'chaperoning', 'field', 'trip', 'who', 'books', 'same', 'hotel', 'room', 'male', 'female', 'students', 'then', 'alcohol', 'Bratt', 'character', 'drug', 'addict', 'Pucci', 'character', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'heck', 'only', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'character', 'alone', 'not', 'suffering', 'such', 'flaw', 'wisdom', 'capable', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'successful', 'heroic', 'patient', 'moronic', 'husband', 'etc.So', 'many', 'movies', 'evince', 'misandric', 'theme', 'days', 'am', 'getting', 'sick', 'it.Basically', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'thumbsucker', 'sucks', 'indeed']",N/A

The casting was superb; and the acting so well done that I found it a delight to watch this quirky comedy. The script was great, too; and both the cinematography and the choreography shine. The plot moves along at a very good pace and I never got bored; there's also plenty of character development and that's great.When the action starts, we meet young Justin Cobb (Lou Taylor Pucci), a seventeen year old high school student with mediocre grades and a lack of interest in doing much schoolwork. Justin has his eyes on a young girl who is heavily into the environmental movement in their debate club; but he's shy and understandably clumsy about bringing up the topic of intimacy with her.However, Justin has something else on his plate: curiously enough, at the age of seventeen he still sucks his thumb--not in public; but even the private habit angers his father Mike (Vincent D'Onofrio) and puzzles his well meaning mother Audrey (Tilda Swinton). When Justin's nutty dentist (Keanu Reeves) suggests hypnosis to rid Justin of his thumb sucking problem; it works--but then poor Justin has to find a way to get through life with yet another crutch. And wow, how this new crutch becomes an issue!I came away from this movie wanting to yell ""bravo"" while standing up in my theater seat! The story is told with such tenderness that it truly touched me; and it goes to great lengths to show just how hard it can be to be an adolescent. Some people will say, of course, that Justin's behavior isn't always too endearing; and they certainly have a point. However, teenagers are at a tough age; many of us behaved like Justin behaves at one time or another when we were teenagers. If I was disappointed with the lack of development of anyone's character, it might be Justin's father Mike who always feels sorry for himself about a knew injury that kept him from playing pro football many years prior--if he were to make it to that level, of course. Look also for an outstanding performance by Tilda Swinton as Justin's mother Audrey; and Keanu Reeves provides some comic relief as the flaky dentist who wants to help Justin grow spiritually. In addition, Kelli Garner plays Rebecca wonderfully and Vince Vaughn plays Mr. Geary, the debate club teacher.The DVD comes with a few extras. There is a ""behind the scenes"" featurette and there is an optional audio commentary with writer/director Mike Mills. There is also a conversation with director Mike Mills and novelist Walter Kirn.Thumbsucker is a terrific, quirky comedy that still manages to tackle a number of issues at once and this impresses me.

According to his whacked-out Orthodontist (a flower child-like Keanu Reeves), Justin sucks his thumb because he was not breast fed or some such oral fixation problem. In other words, no one knows why until Justin's counselor decides that Justin has an attention disorder problem and encourages Audrey and Mike to have a physician prescribe Ritalin. And so they do and Justin's life suddenly becomes bigger, brighter, better focused and takes on forward propulsion: he excels in all areas of his school and personal life. But at what price?The ideas behind ""Thumbsucker"" are good ones:  children are over-medicated, too fat, watch too much television, spend too much time in front of the computer screen, etc., etc.But director Mike Mills cannot seem to form a coherent point of view here. Instead, he throws all his ideas at the wall and hopes one will stick. He points fingers, assigns blame but where are his solutions...or his resolutions?Despite all of Mills' indecisive, muddled direction, he has gathered a great cast: Pucci strikes all the right notes as a basically normal kid caught up, no really mangled by the supposed goodwill of his elders, Swinton, an actress with promethean acting skills, plays a goodhearted Mom who loves her son and only wants the best for him and finally D'Onofrio, who is totally free of his patented tics and schtick and manages in several warm and thoughtful scenes to really connect with Justin.Ultimately though, ""Thumbsucker"" is a case of lost opportunities and thwarted chances to make a real and important statement about young people, their place in our lives and the harm we infict upon them in the guise of ""helping"" them.",3,We're All Addicts,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1973,"['Justin', 'Cobb', 'put-upon', 'sad', 'sack', 'Leo', 'Pucci', '17', 'thumb', 'concerned', 'parents', 'Audrey', 'Mike', 'luminous', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'reserved', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'are', 'loss', 'why.Justin', 'nice', 'enough', 'guy', 'OK', 'school', 'aspirations', 'go', 'NYU', 'what', 'up', 'According', 'whacked-out', 'Orthodontist', 'flower', 'child-like', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Justin', 'thumb', 'was', 'not', 'breast', 'fed', 'such', 'oral', 'fixation', 'problem', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'why', 'Justin', 'counselor', 'Justin', 'attention', 'disorder', 'problem', 'Audrey', 'Mike', 'have', 'physician', 'prescribe', 'Ritalin', 'so', 'do', 'Justin', 'life', 'suddenly', 'bigger', 'brighter', 'better', 'focused', 'forward', 'propulsion', 'areas', 'school', 'personal', 'life', 'what', 'price', 'ideas', 'Thumbsucker', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'children', 'are', 'over-medicated', 'too', 'fat', 'watch', 'too', 'much', 'television', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'front', 'computer', 'screen', 'etc.', 'etc.But', 'director', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'form', 'coherent', 'point', 'view', 'here', 'Instead', 'ideas', 'wall', 'one', 'will', 'stick', 'fingers', 'assigns', 'blame', 'where', 'are', 'solutions', 'resolutions', 'Mills', 'indecisive', 'muddled', 'direction', 'gathered', 'great', 'cast', 'Pucci', 'right', 'notes', 'basically', 'normal', 'kid', 'caught', 'up', 'really', 'mangled', 'supposed', 'goodwill', 'elders', 'Swinton', 'actress', 'promethean', 'acting', 'skills', 'goodhearted', 'Mom', 'who', 'son', 'only', 'best', 'finally', ""D'Onofrio"", 'who', 'totally', 'free', 'patented', 'tics', 'schtick', 'manages', 'several', 'warm', 'thoughtful', 'scenes', 'really', 'connect', 'Justin.Ultimately', 'Thumbsucker', 'case', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'thwarted', 'chances', 'make', 'real', 'important', 'statement', 'young', 'people', 'place', 'lives', 'harm', 'infict', 'guise', 'helping']",N/A

He refers to both of his parents (Vincent D'Onofrio and Tilda Swinton) by their first names since calling them ""mom"" and ""dad"" makes them feel old. His dad lives each day as if it should not happen. He is the manager of a sporting goods store, which is a far cry from the professional football player apparently everyone expected him to be, before the injury. His mother is a nurse with a not-so-secret and maybe not-so-innocent crush on a television star.As a senior in high school, Justin was looking at college. His parents suggested local state schools. The explanation was that he may as well have stayed close to home since he would not have many options to go far because his grades would not have raised any eyebrows with admissions departments. Very matter-of-factly they pointed out that he just lacked the things that students need to get into the colleges worth attending.Justin was socially awkward and had even less interaction with peers than he did with his parents. Issues with his parents and with school, primarily in Mr. Geary's (Vince Vaughn) debate club, kept Justin rattled. He coped...by sucking his thumb.Justin had a very unique support group. His younger brother Joel was his conscience and his orthodontist (Keanu Reeves) was his spiritual and philosophical mentor. They helped kept things in perspective.To relieve the anxiety that led to his unfocused approach to school, a counselor suggested medication. A.D.H.D. was the explanation given to Justin's parents. His pills and the hypnosis administered by his orthodontist served as the one-two punch to break his dependency on sucking his thumb.Aside from his orthodontist, no one ever really wanted to help Justin. He was the natural scapegoat for the problems that faced his family. His father's life had turned out entirely differently than was planned. He chose to ignore that fact rather than deal with it, though he used Justin as his aggressive release, though it was verbal and emotional and never physical. He channeled his self pity into disappointment in his older son.Justin's mother had a similar attitude. Though she claimed she fell in love with Justin's father when he suffered the knee injury, there appears to be a rather ironic lingering-resentment. Any pent-up hostility she has about how her life did not turn out anything like her fantasies of being with a big-shot became impatience towards her older son.Justin's younger brother, Joel, viewed him as a loser. He pointed out Justin's social short-comings throughout the movie. His frustration was not known until the end when he had to tell Justin how hard it was to be the normal one since Justin had monopolized being different.Towards the end of the movie, they almost became a real family. While on the medication, Justin became a very successful debater. For the first time in his life, Justin's parents were proud of him. They were able to ignore the pangs of personal regret and accept that their son had talent. Vicariously through him, they were able to forget their own failures. Though it is in short supply, he gave them hope. They focused their issues on him, but later it was in a more positive fashion.A parent should arguably never be more supportive than when a child strives to meet a personal goal. Justin wanted to go to college out of state, though as mentioned above he was never encouraged to try. When it becomes clear that, even if it is without his family's blessing, Justin was leaving, his family pushed back. His dad said that he was just getting used to his son and his mom accused him of flying the coop, alleging he would never come back. Their motives were selfish ones, for with Justin out of the house, their own problems could not be ignored. What he really needed was to get away. Leaving the house, the town, the state could do nothing but good for him.No one performance stuck out above the rest, though everyone did a decent job. The movie was relatively thought provoking, which is a plus.I liked Thumbsucker. I liked how Justin was able, through trial and error (with emphasis on error), to realize how to be himself. He began to see how he was like his dad by never being open with the things that bothered him. And how he was like his mother by desiring a life outside his own family. He knew that while taking his pills, it was a glimpse of who he could be, but not who he was. He even tried recreational drugs before seeing that his way out was not through drugs, but rather on an airplane.",3,I'd give it 3.5 if I could.,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,4569,"['Justin', 'Cobb', 'Lou', 'Pucci', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'rather', 'unusual', 'family', 'parents', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'first', 'names', 'calling', 'mom', 'dad', 'feel', 'old', 'dad', 'day', 'should', 'not', 'happen', 'manager', 'sporting', 'goods', 'store', 'far', 'cry', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'apparently', 'everyone', 'expected', 'be', 'injury', 'mother', 'nurse', 'not-so-secret', 'maybe', 'not-so-innocent', 'crush', 'television', 'star.As', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'Justin', 'was', 'looking', 'college', 'parents', 'suggested', 'local', 'state', 'schools', 'explanation', 'was', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'stayed', 'close', 'home', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'options', 'go', 'far', 'grades', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'admissions', 'departments', 'Very', 'matter-of-factly', 'pointed', 'out', 'just', 'lacked', 'things', 'students', 'need', 'get', 'colleges', 'attending.Justin', 'was', 'socially', 'awkward', 'had', 'even', 'less', 'interaction', 'peers', 'did', 'parents', 'Issues', 'parents', 'school', 'primarily', 'Mr.', 'Geary', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'debate', 'club', 'kept', 'Justin', 'rattled', 'coped', 'sucking', 'thumb.Justin', 'had', 'very', 'unique', 'support', 'group', 'younger', 'brother', 'Joel', 'was', 'conscience', 'orthodontist', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'was', 'spiritual', 'philosophical', 'mentor', 'helped', 'kept', 'things', 'perspective.To', 'relieve', 'anxiety', 'led', 'unfocused', 'approach', 'school', 'counselor', 'suggested', 'medication', 'A.D.H.D', 'was', 'explanation', 'given', 'Justin', 'parents', 'pills', 'hypnosis', 'administered', 'orthodontist', 'served', 'one-two', 'punch', 'break', 'dependency', 'sucking', 'thumb.Aside', 'orthodontist', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'wanted', 'help', 'Justin', 'was', 'natural', 'scapegoat', 'problems', 'faced', 'family', 'father', 'life', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'entirely', 'differently', 'was', 'planned', 'chose', 'ignore', 'fact', 'rather', 'deal', 'used', 'Justin', 'aggressive', 'release', 'was', 'verbal', 'emotional', 'never', 'physical', 'channeled', 'self', 'pity', 'disappointment', 'older', 'son.Justin', 'mother', 'had', 'similar', 'attitude', 'claimed', 'fell', 'love', 'Justin', 'father', 'when', 'suffered', 'knee', 'injury', 'be', 'rather', 'ironic', 'lingering-resentment', 'pent-up', 'hostility', 'how', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'anything', 'fantasies', 'being', 'big-shot', 'became', 'impatience', 'older', 'son.Justin', 'younger', 'brother', 'Joel', 'viewed', 'loser', 'pointed', 'out', 'Justin', 'social', 'short-comings', 'movie', 'frustration', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'end', 'when', 'had', 'tell', 'Justin', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'be', 'normal', 'one', 'Justin', 'had', 'monopolized', 'being', 'different.Towards', 'end', 'movie', 'almost', 'became', 'real', 'family', 'medication', 'Justin', 'became', 'very', 'successful', 'debater', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Justin', 'parents', 'were', 'proud', 'were', 'able', 'ignore', 'pangs', 'personal', 'regret', 'accept', 'son', 'had', 'talent', 'Vicariously', 'were', 'able', 'forget', 'own', 'failures', 'short', 'supply', 'gave', 'hope', 'focused', 'issues', 'later', 'was', 'more', 'positive', 'fashion.A', 'parent', 'should', 'arguably', 'never', 'be', 'more', 'supportive', 'when', 'child', 'meet', 'personal', 'goal', 'Justin', 'wanted', 'go', 'college', 'state', 'though', 'mentioned', 'was', 'never', 'encouraged', 'try', 'When', 'clear', 'even', 'family', 'blessing', 'Justin', 'was', 'leaving', 'family', 'pushed', 'back', 'dad', 'said', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'used', 'son', 'mom', 'accused', 'flying', 'coop', 'alleging', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'motives', 'were', 'selfish', 'ones', 'Justin', 'house', 'own', 'problems', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'What', 'really', 'needed', 'was', 'get', 'away', 'Leaving', 'house', 'town', 'state', 'could', 'do', 'nothing', 'good', 'him.No', 'one', 'performance', 'stuck', 'out', 'rest', 'everyone', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'movie', 'was', 'relatively', 'thought', 'provoking', 'plus.I', 'liked', 'Thumbsucker', 'liked', 'how', 'Justin', 'was', 'able', 'trial', 'error', 'emphasis', 'error', 'realize', 'how', 'be', 'began', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'dad', 'never', 'being', 'open', 'things', 'bothered', 'how', 'was', 'mother', 'desiring', 'life', 'own', 'family', 'knew', 'taking', 'pills', 'was', 'glimpse', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'who', 'was', 'even', 'tried', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'seeing', 'way', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'drugs', 'rather', 'airplane']",N/A

The kids don't talk about booze and sex.  They use drugs and sex, but don't let the obvious put you off.  The director, Mike Mills has created a good one.PS: Lou's family is a secular American family.  In film today, no one goes to church or uses religious principles to work a problem.

He can't exactly pinpoint what it is that separates him from others, but the one obvious manifestation of his uniqueness is the fact that he still sucks his thumb when nervous.  This is the cause of endless consternation to his ex-jock dad (Vincent D`Onofrio), who is struggling with his own sense of failure and, thus, builds a wall between himself and his ""unconventional"" son that Justin, no matter how hard he tries, just can never manage to break through.  Justin's mother (Tilda Swinton) is considerably more sympathetic to and protective of her boy, but even she lives in a fantasy world of celebrity fandom, dreaming of the day when she will win a contest and meet her favorite TV star, hunky Matt Schramm (played by Benjamin Bratt).  Justin struggles with problems both at home and at school, but when he is put on medication, he is suddenly able to focus his mind and excel in areas - such as becoming a master debater - that he never dreamed possible before.  However, Justin seems emotionally unprepared for such a transformation, as he turns into something of an arrogant jerk, alienating those around him with his condescending tone and know-it-all attitude.  But Justin, who is heartbreakingly portrayed by Lou Taylor Pucci, is a young man who is open to learning from his mistakes, a fact which leads to a genuinely touching and inspiring conclusion to the film.Expertly written and directed by Mike Mills (based on the novel by Walter Kirn), ""Thumbsucker"" is an observant, poignant tale that anyone who has ever felt that he ""just didn't quite fit in"" - and that would clearly be everyone - can certainly relate to.  Mills brings a quiet, low-keyed tone to the film, perfectly reflected in the bucolic atmosphere of the movie's small town Oregon setting.  Mills doesn't envision his characters as either heroes or villains, but rather as ordinary, average people trying the best they can to cope with a world that simply doesn't come with any kind of convenient road map to help us chart our course through it.  Justin isn't a ""bad"" kid; he's just awkward, frightened and confused - as are the rest of us - by this messy thing we call life.  Even the two key non-parental adults in his life - a well-meaning but often brusque debate coach (Vince Vaughn) and an equally well-meaning but somewhat spacey New Age orthodontist (Keanu Reeves) who tries to hypnotize Justin out of sucking his thumb - are portrayed as flawed but caring individuals.Mills has drawn rich and beautiful performances from his entire cast - even Keanu Reeves, who gets to sum up the movie's message in his climactic speech:  that we spend so much time trying to find ways to ""fix"" ourselves that we wind up becoming eternally frustrated and utterly miserable in the process.

There was just one big room with a lot of chairs and he went from patient to patient after his assistants finished with the cleanings.  I only mention this because the orthodontist portrayed by Keanu Reeves in ""Thumbsucker"" operates in a tiny room decorated with paintings of wolves.  He's more than an orthodontist, you see.  He also offers spiritual guidance to Justin, the movie's main character, who gets different forms of guidance from a handful of people in the movie, including his parents, his little brother, the debate team coach, and a girl at school.The film basically follows Justin through his last year of high school.  He's a social reject, as his little brother let's us know.  He's also awkward with girls.  And, much to his dad's chagrin, he still sucks his thumb.  But things change for Justin once he stops sucking his thumb and starts using drugs to control his attention deficit disorder.  He suddenly becomes confident and more self-assured, though this doesn't really solve his problems--it just causes different ones.""American Beauty"" and ""Donnie Darko"" are just a couple of the witty, teen angst movies that might have inspired Mike Mills when he made this movie.  If you liked either of those movies then this might be worth checking out.  Personally, I felt like the director started off with the best intentions, but in the end everything seemed a little too borrowed.  For example, you have Kelli Garner, who looks like Mena Suvari, playing the manipulative female character.  The little brother is the foul-mouthed comic relief.  The dad is a typical ex-jock who settled for marriage and a job at a sporting goods store.  And the kid is the same confused teen you've seen in a thousand other movies.  In the end, I just felt like there were too many twists and turns that I'd seen in other films.

His father, Mike (Vincent D'Onofrio) seems more concerned about it than his mother, Audrey (Tilda Swinton). One day, Justin's dentist Perry (Keanu Reeves) talks to him about this habit, among other things, and Justin stops sucking his thumb becoming a chaotic individual who has to use Ritalin to calm down. The transformation is miraculous and he becomes a fantastic student and a brilliant member of the debate team headed by Mr. Geary (Vince Vaughn).""Thumbsucker"" written and directed by Mike Mills is a very good look at what life is like for a teenager and their parents.Pucci won an award at Sundance for his performance. He does a very good job of portraying the low key teen and his character is fun to watch as he changes to the new Justin. One moment, he is a surly, confused teen who would prefer to sleep and then after he starts taking Ritalin, he becomes Super Student, always full of energy and raring to go. His performance is very natural and it is deserving of the award at Sundance. But I have to wonder how much of the `naturalness' comes from his age? Perhaps he simply hasn't had the time to become `an actor', to `emote'. But I don't think that gives him full credit. Even new actors generally take some time to find their place, appearing awkward and unnatural unless guided by a good director. I think the majority of us have all appeared in some sort of school play and know how it feels to be onstage in front of a bunch of staring eyes. Pucci appears to be naturally gifted and hopefully will continue to show this skill in many more films.The supporting cast is filled with interesting and varied actors. Tilda Swinton and Vincent D'Onofrio are great as Justin's parents. They seem in a state of constant shock that they actually have two children. At one point, Mike professes that he is afraid Justin is smarter than he is. Mike, a one promising athlete who got injured, is the manager of a sporting goods store. He may not like the job, but he gives it everything he has, because he has a family to support. Audrey (Swinton) is a nurse at a local hospital who has a major crush on actor Matt Schramm (Benjamin Bratt), the star of a television cop show. She asks for Justin's help with an essay to win a date with the actor. Both are strange, unusual and completely natural. They are supportive and loving of their children, but unsure of how to deal with them.Keanu Reeves is humorous as Justin's New Age dentist, the man who sets him on the right path. Reeves is perfectly cast for the role, allowing his surfer dude dialect to complete the portrayal.Vince Vaughn is also great as the Debate Club advisor. He seems thrilled to be along for the ride as Justin begins winning debates, taking their team to the state finals. Mr. Geary is a mellower version of the ""Vince Vaughn"" character he has played many times. At one point, he asks Justin to bring the girls on the debate team into the boy's bathroom, for a quick pep talk. Justin hesitates. Then Vaughn says ""That's okay. I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher."" It is a funny moment and very low key for Vaughn.The best thing about the film is that everything seems very natural. Yes, Justin calls his mother and dad by their first names, but that seems to fit. Yes, some crazy stuff is going on in the family, but that works as well. The film portrays a sort of heightened naturalness which works and makes the film all the more enjoyable.Writer/ Director Mills keeps the story moving at a good pace, holding our attention as Justin makes his journey through the story. At one point, early on, Justin announces that he would like to attend NYU. Mike snorts and then states that his grades aren't good enough. I get the feeling he is also reacting to the possibility he may have to pay thousands of dollars to help his son go to a college like NYU. After he becomes a super student, he decides to apply anyway and writes an essay about his family life. When he is accepted, he tells his shocked parents the good news. They aren't shocked because they don't believe in him, but shocked because they don't want their son to move that far away. After Audrey lets this news sink in a little, Justin approaches her to try to comfort her. She states ""You're already gone."" This scene is a nice example of the style of relationship Justin has with just about everyone in the film. The scenes ring true and the dialogue is very good.""Thumbsucker"" is a quirky, interesting, well-made film. If you are a huge fan of independent films, you should definitely see it. If you are normally used to louder, bigger budget films, you will probably have to adjust to the film.

954570,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000C20VVE,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","First I want to say `Thumbsucker' is a very good movie. It never bores you, is presented with imagination, and well-acted. The film is supported by its capable cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Vince Vaughn, Vincent D'Onofrio, Benjamin Bratt and Keanu Reeves, but the most amazing is Lou Taylor Pucci who convincingly plays a troubled high school boy named Justin living in a small town in Oregon.The film is a portrait of the life of Justin and the people surrounding him drawn with a low-key approach. When Justin decides to break his habit of thumb-sucking, first by the hypnosis (at the office of dentist played by Keanu Reeves), and then by taking small pills, he faces a more difficult situation involving his parents (Vincent D'Onofrio and Tilda Swinton), his teacher (Vince Vaughn), and Rebecca (Kelli Garner) his only friend in school.Whatever your idea about teenagers in America is, some of you may think Justin is not a typical teenager. Sure, his addiction to thumb may look like unusual topic for a film, but what it represents has a universal meaning. In short, through his habit he comes to know it is OK to be different, and the film in fact never shows judgmental attitudes toward any of the characters who share some kind of addition or peculiar traits more or less.At the same time it must be said that, good and well-meaning as it is, this message (set against the background of American culture in suburbia) has been told many times before in other films. Moreover, someone looking for more emotional drama would be disappointed with the style of director Mike Mills, who clearly belongs to the generation of Sofia Coppola (whose name appears in `Thanks' at the end credit). The film is very sensitive, but its sensitivity with which he describes Justin may be not to your taste.And sorry, but the film turned out that way for me. Younger people would find it easy to relate to the central character, but perhaps not the older ones like me, who stick to the older values that Justin's father seems to have. Not that `Thumbsucker' is a bad film, though, but it is still true that for me the film is a head-scratching experience hard to define, like the mixed feelings about memories of reading such books as, say, Salinger.
