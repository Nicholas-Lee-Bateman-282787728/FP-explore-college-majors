1267023,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002FUIIWA,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","I wasn't expecting much from Bigfoot since most of us know the story behind his supposed existence and it's all been explained and detailed for years.  However in this case, the movie writers did a smart thing by keeping Bigfoot in the forest where he belongs, which adds to the mystery and the phenomenon of Bigfoot (at least, as much mystery as possible).It's a comedy movie and a family-friendly one at that.  It's about a teenage boy who stumbles across Bigfoot while attempting to free himself from a group of southern boys who are looking for some payback after the boys throws fluid at them.  They take exception and, while on his bike, the boy has to free himself from the southern boys that chase the kid in their truck.When his bike wrecks and he later wakes up on the ground, he awakes to find Bigfoot standing over him.  Naturally he freaks out!  He tries to run away from the hairy creature but gets his foot stuck between two rocks.  Those rocks helped to assure the boy that getting stuck was actually a great thing because now he quickly discovers that Bigfoot is friendly and searching for some food.Well the boy wants to keep Bigfoot a secret because he knows that outsiders wouldn't know how to handle it if they were to discover that Bigfoot is for real, so the boy frequently visits Bigfoot with his guitar and, oh, of course he brings plenty of food!  Bigfoot LOVES food!  The storyline turns more adventurous and serious just as soon as the southern boys find out about Bigfoot and attempt to capture him.  It's all done in a swearing-free kind of way so the movie is totally appropriate for kids.The one actress, who's a hottie that goes by the name Nicole Badaan, becomes friends with the teenage boy who discovered Bigfoot much to the displeasure of her uptight friends.  At first I thought she was just a terrible actress, but later we discover that what initially seemed to be horrible acting is actually her attempt at portraying a fake sassy cheerleader personality, so I'll let her performance off the hook.The two southern boys are actually hilarious because one of them is very serious and determined while the other is clueless and frequently makes costly mistakes in their Bigfoot hunting routine, which results in his southern buddy criticizing him.I take exception to that ""fantasy land"" remark by the boys mother.  She says (about her son) ""All he does is sit around listening to music, surfing the internet, and watching youtube videos"".  AHEM!  That's not a bad thing lady!  Leave us alone!Well there ARE some storyline holes (such as a certain segment later on when the father didn't bother asking why his son just stole a truck... what?) but those are insignificant given the fact it's a playfully written movie for kids.  That's why it's easy for me to forgive the writing.  And the movie actually IS pretty exciting.  All the appropriate lines are given, there's consistency in the flow of the storyline, and everything is perfectly fine.
