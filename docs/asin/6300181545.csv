200021,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300181545,Acute Observer,"[4, 21]","Saint Dominic's parish needs a new furnace, and is behind on its mortgage. The banker explains the business to his son, and why churches are poor risks. Father Charles O'Malley meets pastor Father Fitzgibbons under conditions that are not ideal, but humorous. ""There is joy in giving, especially if its something you don't want."" Father O'Malley came from East St. Louis; I wonder what it was like then? He is to become the man in charge to try to fix the parish problems. We see that their parishioners are also poor. Some boys are known to the police for getting into trouble. Father O'Malley tries to advise a teenage girl to stay at home, however humble it is. Some of the humor is dated. O'Malley works with the young boys to keep them off the street and out of trouble. [No mention of their home life, but you can read between the lines.] Fitzgibbons meets with the bishop, and learns what is planned for St. Dominic's.The film shows a double-Decker bus. [I wonder when they stopped using them?] An old friend meets ""Chuck"" and we get a few minutes of an opera. Then Mrs. Quint reports on a neighbor, and Father O'Malley visits to check things out. Which way is she going? The film turns serous again when the banker visits the apartment to find his son. The younger generation seems so different today! Then the father learns why the son quit his job. Father O'Malley has written a song, and they try to promote it to the music industry. But this song does not meet their current needs. Another humorous song has commercial merit. [No one went broke by underestimating the public.] The collection brings in enough money to pay off the parish debts. All seems well. Who said ""schmaltz"" dozen't sell?Later we see the priests playing golf. Father Fitzgibbons plans a long-delayed trip back home. But a disaster in the form of a church fire changes everything! More news brings financial aid, but Father O'Malley will be transferred to a new parish. And so the film ends with a happy ending, and a surprise for Father Fitzgibbons. The people in this film seem to have an incredible amount of luck for that time. There is a serious question in this story: which way are you going?",3,A Happy View of Life,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2182,"['Saint', 'Dominic', 'parish', 'new', 'furnace', 'behind', 'mortgage', 'banker', 'business', 'son', 'why', 'churches', 'are', 'poor', 'risks', 'Father', 'Charles', ""O'Malley"", 'meets', 'pastor', 'Father', 'Fitzgibbons', 'conditions', 'are', 'not', 'ideal', 'humorous', 'joy', 'giving', 'especially', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'came', 'East', 'St.', 'Louis', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'become', 'man', 'charge', 'try', 'fix', 'parish', 'problems', 'see', 'parishioners', 'are', 'also', 'poor', 'boys', 'are', 'known', 'police', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'advise', 'teenage', 'girl', 'stay', 'home', 'however', 'humble', 'humor', 'dated', ""O'Malley"", 'young', 'boys', 'keep', 'off', 'street', 'trouble', 'mention', 'home', 'life', 'can', 'read', 'lines', ']', 'Fitzgibbons', 'meets', 'bishop', 'what', 'planned', 'St.', ""Dominic's.The"", 'film', 'double-Decker', 'bus', '[', 'wonder', 'when', 'stopped', 'using', ']', 'old', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'get', 'few', 'minutes', 'opera', 'Then', 'Mrs.', 'Quint', 'reports', 'neighbor', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'visits', 'check', 'things', 'out', 'Which', 'way', 'going', 'film', 'serous', 'again', 'when', 'banker', 'apartment', 'find', 'son', 'younger', 'generation', 'so', 'different', 'today', 'Then', 'father', 'why', 'son', 'quit', 'job', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'written', 'song', 'try', 'promote', 'music', 'industry', 'song', 'not', 'meet', 'current', 'needs', 'humorous', 'song', 'commercial', 'merit', 'one', 'went', 'broke', 'underestimating', 'public', ']', 'collection', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'parish', 'debts', 'well', 'Who', 'said', 'schmaltz', 'doze', ""n't"", 'sell', 'Later', 'see', 'priests', 'playing', 'golf', 'Father', 'Fitzgibbons', 'long-delayed', 'trip', 'back', 'home', 'disaster', 'form', 'church', 'fire', 'changes', 'everything', 'More', 'news', 'financial', 'aid', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'will', 'be', 'transferred', 'new', 'parish', 'so', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'surprise', 'Father', 'Fitzgibbons', 'people', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'incredible', 'amount', 'luck', 'time', 'serious', 'question', 'story', 'way', 'are', 'going']",Going My Way VHS

It was sweet, really sweet.Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby) has been assigned to ""assist"" Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald, in the part he seems to have been born to play), the priest who has been at St. Dominic's for 45 years. In fact, he built it. But the Bishop thinks Fitzgibbon is getting too old, and he's really looking for O'Malley to be in charge without hurting Fitzgibbon's feelings.Father O'Malley is modern, and what's more wears a St. Louis Browns jacket and grew up in St. Louis. I guess that does bias me in his favor, but there's also the fact that he sings as beautifully as Bing Crosby, you know? He rescues an 18-year-old girl who has run away from her over-strict parents. He turns the local juvenile delinquents into a choir, pacifies the old grouch who holds the mortgage on the church, and generally does all sorts of good, kind things in an artful, gentle way.He also writes songs, including the title song ""Going My Way"" which is not very good, and ""Swinging on a Star"" which is, of course, just great. He runs into an old girlfriend, who just happens to have become the star of the opera ""Carmen"" and is played by a real opera star, Rise Stevens. She likes O'Malley's song ""Going My Way,"" and sets up an audition of it with a song publisher at the opera house with O'Malley playing piano, the boys choir doing backup, and she sings the main part quite beautifully. But the publisher is not interested. He says it's too good for his cut-rate publishing company. But he accidentally overhears the kids and O'Malley sing ""Swinging on a Star"" and loves it. That he wants to publish.Just when O'Malley has things under control and is attempting to persuade Fitzgibbon to take that trip to Ireland to visit his mother that he's been planning for 45 years, the church burns to the ground. Of course O'Malley finds a way to raise the money to rebuild.It's classic schmaltz, but it's pleasant schmaltz.

200030,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6300181545,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[3, 4]","""Going My Way"" is a multiple Oscar winner from 1944, including best picture, actor, supporting actor, director, screenplay, original story, and song.  It's also the kind of movie that's been lampooned multiple times over the years, for good reason; its naivete is matched only by its charm.  The hokey story involves a young priest who must gently take over a parish from the old priest who built the church building 45 years earlier, and his struggles to quietly do things in a new, progressive way that makes the old fella uncomfortable.  He also has to turn a street gang into a choir, guide a female 18-year-old runaway onto the straight and narrow, and cope with a mortgage that's about to swallow the parish whole.  And naturally, all of this is accomplished without anyone ever coming dangerously close to losing their temper.It's as corny as anything you'll see, this story.  Furthermore, looked back at through the passage of time and ugly headlines, it's almost painful to see a priest in charge of a large number of young boys and a pretty teenage runaway.  But this film was made in a far different time than ours, and who's the worse for that, us or them?  Viewed as an artifact from a time when our nation was in the throes of defeating Hitler, the people sacrificing and rationing to help make it happen, this feel-very-good story must have been a real tonic.  And what's really surprising, in this cynical day and age, is that it is a tonic today as well.  Still, if they're going to have Bing pretend to play the piano while he sings, the least he could do is move his arms at least just a little bit to simulate playing.In spite of the above misgivings, at the end of this 2-hour film I found myself wishing there were more.  Oh, yes, the story drags a bit in a few places, but by the time we sense ""The End"" approaching it makes us sad to know it's coming.

Everybody is nice and candid (yes, even the old gossipy lady, why, there's no malice in her). The action flows like on clouds, at such an unpreoccupied pace that is so relaxing. This is the most remarkable thing about it: its lingering scenes and no hurry pace. Yes, as some one mentioned already, the chess scene is a good example of this style. Seinfeld fans might want to check if this is finally their ideal film: a film about nothing, where nothing happens... it's wonderful. But things do happen, but no one cares because it's mostly the feeling of being part in a dream that remains with you.The story is simple enough (but so are Spielberg's -I mean, not like Antonioni, for example-), there are 2 Catholic priests, one old and one young. The bishop thinks that the old one (Barry Fitzgerald) needs to leave his place to Bing Crosby, who is much more ""progressive"" (in those times it didn't have the bad connotation it has now).

200036,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6300181545,Classic film buff,"[2, 3]","I suppose I will always have a soft spot for this film if for no other reason than during my Catholic boyhood of the 1960's, in both my church and parochial school I was fortunate enough to know several young priests that were very much like Bing Crosby's Father ""Chuck"" O'Malley, warm, humorous, bright, kindly and engaging without being overly sanctimonious.  Yet, like Father O'Malley they took their religion seriously but wore it lightly, and we students and altar boys were treated with respect, with not even a hint of impropriety.  Yes, I was extremely blessed and lucky, and viewing this movie brings back fond, nostalgic memories of those gentlemen who positively influenced my life.  That being said to be honest I do have to say I also knew some stern, rigid, cantankerous clerics as well the way Barry Fitzgerald's Father Fitzgibbon could be at times, and they weren't always aged either!Saint Dominic's, a Roman Catholic parish in one of Manhattan's inner city neighborhoods in the early 1940's, is facing hard times.  The elderly pastor Father Fitzgibbon (Fitzgerald) is wearied and burned out after devoting over 40 years of hard work to his parish, and the reins of control are beginning to slip through his fingers.  The mortgage on the church is in arrears for several months, and the bank is pressing for payment.  There is a teenage gang of boys in the parish that is well on the way to juvenile delinquency.  Enter Father O'Malley (Crosby), a youthful, progressive priest appointed by the bishop to take over and put St. Dominic's back on its feet again.  However, Father O'Malley doesn't want to hurt Father Fitzgibbons feelings, so he is secretly in charge, and officially the new curate and assistant.  Initially the relationship is a rocky one, Father Fitzgibbon's age and conservative, traditional outlook clash with the younger priest's easy going, enlightened ways.  However, by the films conclusion they have both come to appreciate and respect one another, developing a strong almost father/son relationship, and St. Dominic's having weathered and survived a tragedy is rising out of the ashes like a phoenix, the stronger for it.Playing Father O'Malley was Bing Crosby's bridge in motion pictures from crooner and comic to an actor who sang.  Like his singing, his acting looks deceptively easy and simple; at its best the naturalistic style is very reminiscent of Spencer Tracy.  This is a rich, thoughtful performance full of nuanced detail, and well deserving of the Best Actor Oscar that was bestowed on Crosby.  So as not to disappoint his fans, Bing also sings several songs flawlessly including the delightful ""Swinging on a Star!"", ""Ave Maria"", ""Too Ra Loo Ral Loo Ral"", and the title song but they are not gratuitous; all are pertinent to the story.When we first meet Father Fitzgibbon, he's not very likeable, although careworn and befuddled he's too crusty and austere for no good reason towards the very sympathetic Father O'Malley. However Barry Fitzgerald is such a skilled player, that he soon reveals the priest's vulnerability as someone who has grown old and tired through his dogged devotion to St. Dominic's and his parishioners.  As we begin to understand him better, he becomes very endearing, and soon we begin to like him.  Fitzgerald has an expert comic touch, and brings out the wry humor in his character.  Both Crosby and he play superbly off one another like two champion athletes; each brings out the best in the other.  Fitzgerald made Oscar history in the first and only time that an actor was nominated in both the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories for the same role, the rules were changed shortly thereafter to prevent additional occurances.  Fitzgerald brought home the Supporting  Actor trophy, as was right.Mezzo-soprano Rise Stevens from the Metropolitan Opera plays opera singer Genevieve Linden, a very close friend of Chuck's who comes back into his life, and very possibly still holds a torch for him.  She has a warmhearted sincerity that works well, plus there is the added bonus of her soaring singing.  Some reviewers have complained about the aria she sings from Bizet's opera ""Carmen"" being inappropriate to the film and slowing it down.  I disagree; Ms. Stevens was a legendary, sexy, fiery Carmen and she sounds glorious.  It's fitting that at least a small portion of one of her most famous roles is captured for posterity, and what's wrong with trying to introduce the audience to a new art form such as opera?Two seasoned character actors, Frank McHugh and Gene Lockhart give excellent support as respectively Father Timmy O'Dowd, Father O'Malley's best friend and Ted Haines Sr. the banker who holds the mortgage.  James Brown and Jean Heather are appealing as a pair of young lovers that Father O'Malley counsels. In a small cameo William Frawley, the future ""Fred Mertz"" of ""I Love Lucy"" fame is amusing as an irascible music publisher. Finally, I'd like to mention Stanley Clements and Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer (yep, from the ""Little Rascals"") who play the gang leaders that Father O'Malley sets on the right path, they have a gritty urban authenticity.""Going My Way"" swept the 1944 Oscars winning 7 out of 10 Academy Awards, besides Bing's and Barry's wins, the major wins include Best Picture, Best Director Leo McCarey, Best Screenplay to Frank Butler and Frank Cavett and Best Song for ""Swinging on a Star!"".  I'm not sure I agree with the Best Picture, Director and Song, I think they should have been won for ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", it's director Vincente Minnelli and it's song ""The Trolley Song"".  ""Going My Way"" while an excellent film isn't as fresh, innovative and timeless as ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", but I have to confess I'm not impartial since ""St. Louis"" is one of my top all time favorite movies.Still, this is a film that was lovingly made, and carries its own special warmth in getting out a positive message, how giving unselfishly of oneself to help others can be a very beautiful, rewarding thing.  Yet at the same time, this lesson is presented in a very absorbing and entertaining fashion without pontificating.  For me it's a must see every Christmas season, and I highly recommend it to all.  And unless you've got a block of granite in your chest, the final touching scene will bring at least one tear to your eye!",5,"""You can be better than you are, you could be swingin' on a

It is such a warm story written and directed by Leo McCarey (who also wrote Love Affair, Bells of St. Mary's and An Affair to Remember as well as directed the latter two).The movie's warmth owed much to the wonderful performance of Barry Fitzgerald (Best Actor in a Supporting Role), as the lovable and respectable elderly Father Fitzgibbon, despite his old school of strict rules and hardships expected of a clergyman. And Bing Crosby(Best Actor), as Father O'Malley, came to rescue the old church with utmost regard of Father Fitzgibbon's delicate feeling. Bing Crosby's portrayal of a sensible, upright Father who enjoyed a close relationship with the younger generation was most impressive. The joyful and buoyant Father O'Dowd (Frank McHugh) provided the optimistic mood often needed to uplift the morale of the other two Fathers. The personal sacrifice made by Fitzgibbon, his longing to see his mother far away, the subplots of a radiant contralto of Metropolitan Opera Association (Rise Stevens) with a gold heart, the father and son money lenders, a nave run away 18-year old (Jean Heather) all make a wonderful story.In addition, there is much good music performed by Bing Crosby (Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra, Silent Night, Swinging on a star - Best Original Music) and Rise Stevens (Ave Maria, Habanera of Carmen)with the Robert Mitchell Boychoir. There is just a right balance between the good Christmas spirit and delightful Christmas music.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Catholic priests were the good guys and likable actors like Pat O'Brien, Spencer Tracy and even Bing Crosby made them even more attractive. Since the '60s, Hollywood went in the opposite direction and made them villains more than anything else.Frankly, I never found a nun who looked like Ingrid Bergman or Audrey Hepburn, or a priest who could sing like Bing Crosby, but, what the hell, er heck....better to see a positive cleric image than a negative, I believe.The first hour of this movie was very good and the film might have wound up a favorite of mine but the second half petered out quickly and never regained steam, except for a nice ending. The films bogs down with a romance that has nothing to do with the story. The music also lost its appeal to me when Crosby's fine voice was finished for the film, replaced by the operatic high notes of Rise Stevens.Overall, the film has a number of nice, touching moments and Crosby is very likable but the story goes on too long and is not one I would watch a second time.",4,When Priests Were The Good Guys On Film,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,1141,"['always', 'been', 'strange', 'movie', 'buff', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'change', 'decades', '1940s', '1950s', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'were', 'good', 'guys', 'likable', 'actors', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'even', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'attractive', ""'60s"", 'Hollywood', 'went', 'opposite', 'direction', 'made', 'more', 'anything', 'else.Frankly', 'never', 'found', 'nun', 'who', 'looked', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'priest', 'who', 'could', 'sing', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'what', 'hell', 'er', 'heck', '.better', 'see', 'positive', 'cleric', 'image', 'negative', 'believe.The', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'favorite', 'mine', 'second', 'half', 'petered', 'out', 'quickly', 'never', 'regained', 'steam', 'nice', 'ending', 'films', 'bogs', 'down', 'romance', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'music', 'also', 'lost', 'appeal', 'when', 'Crosby', 'fine', 'voice', 'was', 'finished', 'film', 'replaced', 'operatic', 'high', 'notes', 'Rise', 'Stevens.Overall', 'film', 'number', 'nice', 'touching', 'moments', 'Crosby', 'very', 'likable', 'story', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",Going My Way VHS

Yet those of us who tend towards nostalgia would find this a relaxing, fun, highly memorable film.There is no coherent plot, and action moves from one (barely developed) sub-&quot;story&quot; to another. The underlying story works best when it deals realistically with life in a rather poor parish: the super-religious gossip, kids in a bit of trouble, young couple who are sleeping together (but making it sound innocent), pastor faced with financial problems, charismatic younger priest who is a good influence on the young in spite of themselves. (I must add that those of us who have known the &quot;real life&quot; counterparts of all, as I certainly have, will find it refreshing that political correctness does not distort them!) Unfortunately, several major influences in the story are distracting and rather annoying. I've known many a &quot;real&quot; Father O'Malley, and his organising kids into a group (to their great benefit) is indeed realistic, but their emerging as a highly polished classical choir in short order is absurd. Fr Chuck's totally &quot;by chance&quot; meeting with the old girlfriend who just happens to be headlining at the Met, and who both gets the entire Metropolitan Opera orchestra to present the demonstration of Chuck's tiresome tune to publishers, then arranges a highly lucrative concert tour for the now-brilliant boy choir, would have best been eliminated, since it gives the production an entirely artificial quality - as bizarre as their having been granted three wishes! Nor is anything accomplished by the church going on fire...Yet there is enough here that one cannot help but love - and which are true but no longer possible to find. I, for one, greatly miss the days when such colourful characters as Mrs Quimp and Father Fitzgibbons were standard in many a parish - when working class, city neighbourhoods like this had not been either reduced to slums nor turned into luxury flats for the rich - when many kids were helped immensely by associations with dedicated priests. As well, it is a light-hearted, affectionate presentation, with much of the type of delightful humour that died out with Irish priests of Bing's generation.It's like a visit to the old neighbourhood, with lots of friends with whom to renew acquaintance. For a restful few hours, one can relax and pretend that one could still turn a corner and find that it is all still there.",4,Nostalgia comes no better,1008892800,"12 21, 2001",2001,2496,"['literary', 'level', 'are', 'many', 'deficiencies', 'Going', 'Way', 'musical', 'gem', 'who', 'tend', 'towards', 'nostalgia', 'would', 'find', 'relaxing', 'fun', 'highly', 'memorable', 'film.There', 'coherent', 'plot', 'action', 'moves', 'one', 'barely', 'developed', 'sub-', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'underlying', 'story', 'works', 'best', 'when', 'realistically', 'life', 'rather', 'poor', 'parish', 'super-religious', 'gossip', 'kids', 'bit', 'trouble', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'sleeping', 'together', 'making', 'sound', 'innocent', 'pastor', 'faced', 'financial', 'problems', 'charismatic', 'younger', 'priest', 'who', 'good', 'influence', 'young', 'spite', 'must', 'add', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'quot', 'real', 'life', 'quot', 'counterparts', 'certainly', 'have', 'will', 'find', 'refreshing', 'political', 'correctness', 'not', 'distort', 'Unfortunately', 'several', 'major', 'influences', 'story', 'are', 'distracting', 'rather', 'annoying', ""'ve"", 'known', 'many', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'organising', 'kids', 'group', 'great', 'benefit', 'indeed', 'realistic', 'emerging', 'highly', 'polished', 'classical', 'choir', 'short', 'order', 'absurd', 'Fr', 'Chuck', 'totally', 'quot', 'chance', 'quot', 'meeting', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'headlining', 'Met', 'who', 'entire', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'orchestra', 'present', 'demonstration', 'Chuck', 'tiresome', 'tune', 'publishers', 'then', 'highly', 'lucrative', 'concert', 'tour', 'now-brilliant', 'boy', 'choir', 'would', 'have', 'best', 'been', 'eliminated', 'production', 'entirely', 'artificial', 'quality', 'as', 'bizarre', 'having', 'been', 'granted', 'three', 'wishes', 'anything', 'accomplished', 'church', 'going', 'fire', 'enough', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'love', 'are', 'true', 'longer', 'possible', 'find', 'one', 'greatly', 'days', 'when', 'such', 'colourful', 'characters', 'Mrs', 'Quimp', 'Father', 'Fitzgibbons', 'were', 'standard', 'many', 'parish', 'when', 'working', 'class', 'city', 'neighbourhoods', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'either', 'reduced', 'slums', 'turned', 'luxury', 'flats', 'rich', 'when', 'many', 'kids', 'were', 'helped', 'immensely', 'associations', 'dedicated', 'priests', 'well', 'light-hearted', 'affectionate', 'presentation', 'much', 'type', 'delightful', 'humour', 'died', 'out', 'Irish', 'priests', 'Bing', 'generation.It', 'visit', 'old', 'neighbourhood', 'lots', 'friends', 'whom', 'renew', 'acquaintance', 'restful', 'few', 'hours', 'one', 'can', 'relax', 'pretend', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'turn', 'corner', 'find', 'still', 'there']",Going My Way VHS

Then you had your spirited, fun-loving priests (and nuns), who weren't above playing a few innings of baseball or running a sack race.GOING MY WAY touches, very lightly, upon the clash of those two strains among the clergy of the era. As it turns out, the more traditional Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald) is more irascible than truly terrifying. And young Father O'Malley can be as all business behind the charm and easy going manner. He just knows that you win more flies with honey than vinegar. And he knows how to get things done. He also knows that he can loosen up the older priest with a few rounds of golf and some fresh air.The plot amounts to little more than ""Let's put on a show to save the parish church."" Almost absurdly, a famous opera star (played by famous opera star Rise Stevens) shows up to help out, and high power music publishers rush to buy the young priest's ""original"" composition ""Swinging On a Star"" after hearing Bing and his choir of former street kids sing it as a lark. It's hokum, of course, but it's almost guaranteed to make viewers nostalgic for a more innocent era--even if it's one before their own time.Film historians and popular culture scholars would likely have a field day analyzing this film as a product of the WWII era.  God and country themes are never too far from the surface, as one might expect.  And these are certainly ideals that one would not expect to be challenged in any American film of the era.  But the film is a bit more complex that its current day critics might suggest.

200058,A1K714PEGLE3MV,6300181545,Jon Oye,"[85, 86]","Some movies are simply beyond criticism. Despite having been written off in recent years by many mainstream critics - with much repeated, off-base allegations of over-sentimentality - this is one of them. It belongs in the pantheon of truly great films. The cynicism of the world we live in today no doubt prevents countless viewers (and critics) from looking beneath the placid surface of ""Going My Way"", but it's definitely worth the effort.Part of this reluctance to delve may be due to the film's pastoral (no pun intended) ambience and relaxed pace, which could have inspired the producers of the Andy Griffith Show a few years later (check out the checker game scene). It takes its time, telling its story on its own terms, and this simply doesn't sit well with the majority of modern multi-taskers who've been fed a steady diet of breakneck action orgies, sophomoric sex comedies, and formulaic, artificial romantic comedies. But if you give it a chance and let it work its charms it will eventually win you over. To borrow a line from the film, it will ""grow on you."" Maybe not in the first viewing, maybe not even in the first few years...but eventually.Its charms worked instantly on audiences in need of hope, inspiration, and a chuckle or two during the Second World War, making it a huge box office hit in 1944. It even won over critics of the day: James Agee stated that ""Going My Way"" ""points the way to the great films which will be possible when Hollywood becomes aware of the richness and delight of human character for its own sake."" It earned seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and a Best Actor Oscar for Bing Crosby (as Father Chuck O'Malley), who was starting his run as the #1 box office star for a record five consecutive years.Not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, this slice-of-life piece gently sets an example of all generations helping one another, ultimately working together as one extended family. While only a couple of scenes take place at Christmastime, the whole film is basically an enactment of how one person can make a difference by helping his neighbor - one of the reasons for the first Christmas. That helpful, caring attitude is infectious to the point that disparate members of an urban neighborhood eventually come together as a community. The twist is in Father O'Malley's appealingly relaxed methods, which appear unorthodox to the staid, older, by-the-book (small ""b"") Father Fitzgibbon, providing the conflict of the main plotline.Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald, Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner) has been the pastor of St. Dominic's Parish for forty-five years, and as the neighborhood around him has changed, his old school ways have become less effective. Gangs of unsupervised boys roam the streets getting into trouble (a real-life consequence of fathers fighting overseas and mothers working in war production plants during WWII), and the church is deeply in debt and about to be foreclosed on. The financial state of the church reflects the spiritually bankrupt community around it, and the physical structure itself will ultimately undergo a literal baptism by fire in order to be born again. In the meantime, young Father O'Malley is sent by the bishop to put things right, basically being assigned to take over for Fitzgibbon without letting the old man know it.After assuming he's no longer needed, and having left in despair (only to be summarily returned by the local beat cop), the contrite Fitzgibbon eventually comes to understand and embrace O'Malley and his methods, and puts complete faith in the younger man. It all comes together in a delightfully subdued, justly celebrated scene in which the two men bond over a ""wee drop of the creature"", as Bing endearingly intones a couple of choruses of ""Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral"" while sitting at the convalescing Fitzgibbon's bedside (!). When they came up with the term ""screen chemistry"" they must have had this scene in mind.Sooner or later, nearly everyone in the film gives of themselves: young Ted Haines, the son of the banker who's foreclosing on the church, leaves his father's line of work to volunteer for military service; an opera star (Rise Stevens) auditions a Father O'Malley-penned song for a music publisher, the royalties of which it is hoped will raise badly needed funds for St. Dominic's; the members of a street gang provide their (previously unrealized) singing talents for the (also previously unrealized) church choir; even the greedy banker (Gene Lockhart) forgives the church its mortgage. All the giving is sparked by the efforts and example of O'Malley, whose ultimate gift is saved for a no-dry-eye-in-the-house ending, just before he leaves for another parish he's been called on to save.Sentimental? Certainly. But every iota of moisture in every teardrop is earned, and one doesn't feel foolish blubbering like a fool.That's partly due to the effortlessly smooth, confident persona Crosby projects in an immaculate performance, which is the perfect counterweight to the story's inherent sentiment. Bing's acting has often been dismissed as that of someone merely playing himself (perpetuated by the self-effacing Crosby), and his Oscar win has been attributed to the fact that much of the crop of `40s actors was away in the service (which was also maintained by Bing). But just watch him - he carries the movie, despite sharing scenes with a couple of the best scene-stealers in the business, Frank McHugh and especially Abbey Theatre alum Fitzgerald. Crosby's acting style appears modern in an era of now-antiquated theatrics. We look across the years at him and he seems familiar, contemporary.He handles the role of a priest convincingly - a daunting task for the best of actors in any era - and almost casually, without the slightest hint of stiffness or self-consciousness. There is no trace of the sanctimoniuosness that frequently crept into Spencer Tracy's performances in the ""Boys Town"" films, and Pat O'Brien's in ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" Crosby's priest comes across as likeable guy, yet one who's just tough enough to deal with whatever situation is at hand - without having to use his fists. Perhaps the greatest tribute to his achievement is that young men in the 1940s and `50s actually joined the priesthood because of their having been inspired by the Father O'Malley of ""Going My Way"" and its sequel, ""The Bells of St. Mary's"".""Going My Way's"" Oscar winning writer-director Leo McCarey probably summed up his film best when he stated his storytelling philosophy: ""I love when people laugh. I love when they cry, I like a story to say something, and I hope the audience feels happier leaving the theatre than when it came in."" From where I'm sitting, ""Going My Way"" succeeds on all counts. If it doesn't for you, give it a chance. It just may grow on you.",5,One For the Ages,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,6832,"['movies', 'are', 'simply', 'criticism', 'having', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'recent', 'years', 'many', 'mainstream',

The fact is that I have loved this movie since the very first time I saw it with my parents when I was 10 or 11 years old. Watching ""Going My Way"" has been a holiday tradition for me ever since.""Going My Way"" stars Bing Crosby as Father Chuck O'Malley, a young Catholic priest who has drawn a very difficult assignment. He has been sent by the Bishop to St. Dominic's in the inner city to help the struggling parish extricate itself from the dire financial straits it finds itself in. For 45 years this parish has been led by Father Fitzgibbon (played masterfully by Barry Fitzgerald). Father O'Malley's task is to implement the needed changes without hurting the old man's feelings...a very sticky wicket indeed! From the outset the two priests are at loggerheads over a number of issues. Over the objections of his pastor Father O'Malley plows ahead with his plans to revive the parish. He starts a boy's choir and if you look very closely you just might spot an extremely young Andy Williams in the group. Father O'Malley also dabbles in songwriting and has a tune he calls ""Going My Way"" that he has high hopes will be published and earn him some cash. This is one of the ways the the good Father hopes to get his parish out of the red.Along the way we meet a number of other delighful charactors including Frank McHugh as Father Timothy O'Dowd and Metropolitan Opera star Rise Stevens as opera singer Genevieve Linden. Also featured in ""Going My Way"" are Gene Lockhart as mean old banker Ted Haines, Sr. and James Brown as the bankers irrepressible son Ted Jr. What is so great about ""Going My Way"" is that it will make you laugh one minute and make you cry the next. And there are some great tunes including one of Bing Crosby's biggest hits ever ""Swinging On A Star"". I just love that tune! And I must warn you....the final scene will bring a tear to your eye....guaranteed! It did the first time I saw it when I was 10 and it did again last night when I watched this film for the umpteenth time. Very touching!""Going My Way"" was a huge hit back in 1944. The film was nominated for a total of 10 Academy Award and walked away with 7 including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.

200079,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,6300181545,Phil Berardelli,"[0, 0]","At first glance, this simple story about an aging priest and his new assistant struggling to keep a Catholic parish financially solvent might seem like hopeless schmaltz. But movie audiences loved it and made it the biggest hit of the year, and if you give it a little time, you might also find its sincerity working its way into your heart. Under McCarey's considerable skills, Going My Way never strikes a wrong note and manages to hit some surprisingly poignant ones, particularly the final scene, which is likely to leave you in tears. Bing Crosby won his only Oscar as the young priest, and Barry Fitzgerald won for his supporting performance as the older pastor. The rest of the cast is fine, including Gene Lockhart as a mortgage banker, William Frawley (best known as Fred Mertz on the classic I Love Lucy TV series) as a talent scout, and Metropolitan Opera diva Ris (pronounced REE-seh) Stevens playing ... well ... an opera diva.

200081,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6300181545,Reviewer,"[25, 27]","In ""Going My Way,"" director Leo McCarey taps into one of the basic tenets of human nature, that being the fact that even the most selfless individual has wants and needs that often go unrecognized or unexpressed.  It's a matter of understanding the human condition, being sensitive to what drives our fellow man and responding to it.  A young woman of eighteen leaves home because of a conflict with her parents, yet has nowhere to go; a man with a touch of ""Scrooge"" in him, who runs a Savings &amp; Loan has trouble setting his priorities; a gang of street-wise kids need some direction; an elderly priest after forty-five years has allowed his parish to slip into financial straits.  All circumstances that are affecting in their innate humanity, and it's into this that McCarey taps directly with his story, and it's the reason for the success of his film.  Simply put, it has heart-- and it makes it timeless.Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald) has been at St. Dominic's in New York since it was built, but the financially strapped parish is in arrears on the mortgage payment, and Mr. Ted Haines Sr. (Gene Lockhart), of the S&amp;L that holds the note, would like nothing better than to be able to foreclose on the church, because then he could raze the building and turn it into a parking lot.  Meanwhile, the Bishop has sent a young priest, Father Chuck O'Malley (Bing Crosby) to St. Dominic's to look into the situation, and very quickly the good Father finds that he has his hands more than full.Sent to take charge without ""taking charge,"" in deference to Father Fitzgibbon's tenure, Father O'Malley has his work cut out just trying to save the church; but that's not all he has to contend with.  Found alone on the street by a local policeman, a girl named Carol James (Jean Heather) is brought to St. Dominic's, and Father O'Malley realizes that without some help, she's headed for nothing but trouble.  He also encounters a lad named Tony Scaponi (Stanley Clements), the leader of the gang that has been terrorizing the neighborhood, and turning that situation around becomes a priority on Father O'Malley's ""to-do"" list.  Then there is Mr. Haines Sr. to deal with.  But most especially in need of all (though he doesn't realize it himself) is Father Fitzgibbon, and this, too, Father O'Malley recognizes.  Now it's just a matter of addressing all of these needs at once; and as Father O'Malley finds out, it's no easy task.There's something of the Angel, Dudley (played by Cary Grant in ""The Bishop's Wife""), in Father O'Malley, as he is not only sensitive to the needs of those he encounters, but knows how to resolve their conflicts in a way that suits the best interests of all concerned.  His solutions may be those of a perfect, pie-in-the-sky world and not necessarily a reflection of reality, but it works because it captures the spirit of what this movie is all about:  caring and lending a helping hand to those who need it.  The solutions may be unrealistic and overly simplified, but the feelings and emotions of the characters are very real, and McCarey's ability to capture that essence of humanity is what earned this film the Oscar for Best Movie of 1944 (McCarey received Oscars, as well, for Best Director and Original Story).As Father O'Malley, Bing Crosby gives one of his best performances, which earned him an Oscar for Best Actor.  But as good as he is in this part, the award is something of a surprise; the Father O'Malley Crosby presents has the patience of a Saint and insight to match, and his mild mannered approach to the character makes his portrayal the kind that are usually overlooked and under-appreciated because of the apparent facility of the delivery.  And Crosby does make it look easy-- which also makes it very real, striking a chord as perfect as the solutions to the problems he solves along the way.  It's interesting to note that when Crosby recreated the role a year later in ""The Bells of St. Mary's,"" though he slipped back into the character readily enough, it didn't seem to have that same depth or impact as in this one, but more of a ""been there, done that"" feel.  Then again, this story and the characters with which he is surrounded here are much richer and have much more definition than those of the sequel, and this film is much more emotionally involving.Barry Fitzgerald received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Father Fitzgibbon, and well deserved it was.  Father O'Malley may be the anchor of this film, but Father Fitzgibbon is it's soul.  And the final scene-- unexpected and extremely moving-- leaves no doubt about it.  That scene, in fact, so powerful in it's simplicity, veritably sums up the sentiment of the entire movie.  It's a triumph for Fitzgerald, as well as McCarey, but the one who really comes out the winner is the viewer.The supporting cast includes Frank McHugh (Father Timothy), William Frawley (Max), James Brown (Ted Haines, Jr.), Rise Stevens (Genevieve Linden), Eily Malyon (Mrs. Carmody), Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer (Herman) and Adeline De Walt Reynolds (Mrs. Molly Fitzgibbon).  A heart-felt and uplifting discourse on the brighter side of the human condition, ""Going My Way"" reflects the good there is to be found in humanity if we but take the time to seek it out.  An entertaining, feel-good film, this is what the magic of the movies is all about.",5,McCarey Taps Into the Human Condition,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,5376,"['Going', 'My', 'Way', 'director',

200095,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,6300181545,"""weirdo_87""","[3, 10]","""Going My Way"" is not exactly one of the most perfect of all movies ever made. And it's not the most deserving ""Best Picture"" winner of 1944 either. The reasons I make those statements are 1.) It's somewhat corny and simplistic, with a few subplots and scenes that do work but still could have been left out. And 2.) Many people, including myself, would name ""Double Indemnity"", ""Gaslight"", ""Laura"", ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or ""Murder, My Sweet"" as more deserving winners. But awards aren't really the best way to judge a movie's greatness because it's a matter of personal opinion. And ""Going My Way"" is a really good movie, despite these flaws.The movie is a great star vehicle for Bing Crosby, who portrays a priest named Father O'Malley sent to help another church run by cranky old Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). Fitzgibbon, who's run the church for 45 years (""46 in October""), is in debt problems with the savings and loans run by Ted Haines Sr. (Gene Lockhart). Fitzgibbon, at first, is not excited by his new assistant's unorthodox methods of practice, such as wearing a baseball uniform when his priest clothing gets wet. He also doesn't care much for O'Malley's liking of golf along with fellow priest Father Timothy (Frank McHugh), remarking that there is too much work to allow games. Fitzgibbon tries to go to the bishop to get O'Malley transferred. But after hearing good things about Father O'Malley and being patient, O'Malley starts to grow on him. Eventually, the old bat starts to lighten up until, by film's end, his church is out of debt and he claims to be ten years younger. He even starts playing golf and other games.Fitzgerald is very good in the role, being sensitive or strict when the time comes. The interaction that he and Crosby have is marvelous. I also love his leprechaunish voice, which is most likely because he comes from Ireland. He received Oscar nominations for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, the only such incident in the academy's history, and deservedly won Supporting Actor.But Bing has several very good to great scenes, which were probably a major factor in his Best Actor win. His performances of the title song and, with the help of the choir, ""Swinging on a Star"" are upbeat and entertaining. I also enjoyed the scene where he gives advice to a troubled young girl named Carol James (Jean Heather) on how to be a better singer and she follows it (A wise move I might add).Now for the movie's problems. There are a couple scenes that could have been excised from the film at the cutting room. About half an hour through the film, after visiting the bishop, Fitzgibbon is talked into keeping O'Malley at the church. But then, he leaves the church at night only to return some hours later. What does this scene mean? I think it was meant to show Fitzgibbon is thinking about whether he wants to stay in charge, for when he returns he says its only temporarily. Also, after that scene, there is one between him and O'Malley that shows character development for Fitzgibbon in how he longs to see his mother, whom he hasn't meet in 45 years. Yet another scene that could have been taken out is when O'Malley watches a performance of ""Ava Maria"" at the Metropolitan by singer Genevieve Linden (Rise Stevens), an old friend of ""Chuck"" (The nickname used by his friends). Both the song and Steven's performance of it are great, but it doesn't do much except slow the pace. And her impressive singing isn't enough to sway a publisher into buy some of Chuck's songs.There are also a couple of subplots. First with Carol and Ted Haines Jr. (James Brown), son of the Savings and Loans manager. This plot shows how O'Malley's advice helped the two straighten out their lives. Ted Sr. visits his son to find out why he quit his job, and finds out it was for a reason relevant to the time. There is also a plot that has some punk kids, who are more of a nuisance than a threat, getting help from O'Malley by forming a choir. By the film's end, they are straightened out and like singing even more than baseball or, the worst of their crimes, hijacking poultry trucks.The movie has several touching moments, most notably the ending when Fitzgibbon receives a big surprise. The surprise was arranged by O'Malley whom, since he is being transferred out, did it as a farewell gift. I admit that I'm not one for crying, having been hardened by too many action movies (Plus I wasted a lot of tears of ""Titanic"" back when I was 10 years old). But my eyes were just a bit misty as the choir started ""Too-ra-Loo-ra-Loo-ra"". Maybe in a few years I will come back and find this to be even sadder. For now, I'll read more of mother's Harlequin romances.I found certain themes here to be similar to those covered in a later movie: ""It's a Wonderful Life"". O'Malley influences and helps out many people in the movie who wouldn't have been better off without him. The only difference is that O'Malley, unlike the later film's protagonist, already knows that he has done great things before the movie ends. At the end, he walks out of the church with no formal thanks. He doesn't need one because he's the kind of person who doesn't ask in return.With a fine supporting cast, great songs, many humorous and touching scenes, ""Going My Way"" is movie I'm glad I watched. It may not be the best Oscar winner, but it made me sigh in one respect: Though ""Double Indemnity"" is an excellent (One of my favorites), how many remakes, homages, and spoofs have been done of that compared to ""Going My Way""?
