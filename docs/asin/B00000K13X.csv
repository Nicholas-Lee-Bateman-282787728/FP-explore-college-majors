508923,A24PTVSZSM8968,B00000K13X,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","This is a very enjoyable romantic movie. It's about a guy named Victor who gets a second chance to make his relationship work though a magic spell, only to have it all fall apart anyway. Along the way, he meets someone new (the Penelope Cruz character). The ending is especially interesting. On the one hand, the lead up makes it seem like he might end up with his original girlfriend, only to have him reject her and stay with the new girl. However, the same people who helped Victor magically have a second chance find his rejected girlfriend, thus hinting that it might not be the end of the story.",5,Nice little gem,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,601,"['very', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'movie', 'guy', 'named', 'Victor', 'who', 'second', 'chance', 'make', 'relationship', 'work', 'magic', 'spell', 'only', 'have', 'fall', 'apart', 'anyway', 'way', 'someone', 'new', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'character', 'ending', 'especially', 'interesting', 'one', 'hand', 'lead', 'up', 'seem', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'original', 'girlfriend', 'only', 'have', 'reject', 'stay', 'new', 'girl', 'However', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'Victor', 'magically', 'have', 'second', 'chance', 'find', 'rejected', 'girlfriend', 'thus', 'hinting', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'story']",N/A
508924,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,B00000K13X,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[3, 4]","True, the plot of TWICE UPON A YESTERDAY, a british movie directed by Mar&iacute;a Ripoll in 1998, will ring a bell in you. If reviewers have already pointed out that the screenplay of SLIDING DOORS ( also a 1998 movie ) is very similar to Rafa Russo's TUY screenplay, I've personnally thought about GROUNDHOG DAY while watching the movie. But who cares after all, only counts the result.I didn't like so much the first third of the movie, fearing the worst after two or three so so scenes of comedy implying Douglas Henshall who plays the main character. But as soon as Victor Bukowski, rejected into the past, is trying to fight against destiny in order to keep Lena Headey at his side, the movie gains a new dimension.Mar&iacute;a Ripoll could have chosen to stay in the comedy field but has preferred the tragi-comedy domain, a domain very difficult to master. So TWICE UPON A YESTERDAY becomes then a little pearl of melancholy and nostalghia about love and missed opportunities. Of course, the (late) apparition of Pen&eacute;lope Cruz cannot but elevate the level of the film (word of a fan!).As bonus features, only a trailer and different subtitles.

508926,A38L1FZNX9MU0X,B00000K13X,Harold A. Fretheim,"[2, 2]",This is a fun movie- and makes a lot more dramtic sense than you might think. It has unexpected twists. Yes there is the fantasy of going back to fix what went wrong in a relationship- but even though the fix happens the result is different from what is expected.  But it is only on the second viewing that I caght the idea that the reason for the 'time travel' was to enable our main character to escape from 'enchantment'- and that the analogy was a literary one drawn from Don Quixote. In a way the real theme is about what happens when one is willing to chnage and to learn.  Does our hero get what he desires in the end? NO- and yes.,5,Watch it at least twice,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,638,"['fun', 'movie-', 'lot', 'more', 'dramtic', 'sense', 'might', 'think', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'fantasy', 'going', 'back', 'fix', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'relationship-', 'even', 'fix', 'result', 'different', 'what', 'expected', 'only', 'second', 'viewing', 'caght', 'idea', 'reason', ""'time"", 'travel', 'was', 'enable', 'main', 'character', 'escape', ""'enchantment'-"", 'analogy', 'was', 'literary', 'one', 'drawn', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'way', 'real', 'theme', 'what', 'when', 'one', 'willing', 'chnage', 'learn', 'Does', 'hero', 'get', 'what', 'end', 'NO-', 'yes']",N/A
