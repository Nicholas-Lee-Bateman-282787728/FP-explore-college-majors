Initially Jennifer is happy when Chris asks her to marry him. He wants to join the Navy and he promises to protect her. But when they move to California strange things start happening on base--a peeping Tom starts looking in women's windows and eventually women start being raped. Jennifer's husband admits that he looked in some windows but promises that nothing else happened. Since Jennifer is pregnant, she decides to give him a second chance. When they return home to New Mexico, once again women are being raped and Jennifer begins to suspect that her husband is to blame.The Stranger Beside Me is classic Lifetime. Tiffani Amber Thiessen has made some of my favorite Lifetime movies, including She Fought Alone, and she excels in her role as a wife who can't trust her husband. This movie isn't great by any means, but if you're in the mood for a little drama that will keep you entertained, you don't have to look much further than this.",3,"Not the best movie I've ever seen, but entertaining enough",1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,1041,"['Tiffani', 'Amber', 'Thiessen', 'Jennifer', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'past', 'full', 'secrets', 'Initially', 'Jennifer', 'happy', 'when', 'Chris', 'marry', 'join', 'Navy', 'protect', 'when', 'move', 'California', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'base', 'peeping', 'Tom', 'looking', 'women', 'windows', 'eventually', 'women', 'start', 'being', 'raped', 'Jennifer', 'husband', 'looked', 'windows', 'promises', 'nothing', 'else', 'happened', 'Jennifer', 'pregnant', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'When', 'return', 'home', 'New', 'Mexico', 'once', 'again', 'women', 'are', 'being', 'raped', 'Jennifer', 'suspect', 'husband', 'blame.The', 'Stranger', 'Beside', 'Me', 'classic', 'Lifetime', 'Tiffani', 'Amber', 'Thiessen', 'made', 'favorite', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'including', 'Fought', 'Alone', 'role', 'wife', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'husband', 'movie', ""n't"", 'great', 'means', ""'re"", 'mood', 'little', 'drama', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'much', 'further']",The Stranger Beside Me

But the cover of the movie had something that made me change my mind; the look kind of spooky so I picked it up. After viewing it I was surprised to say that it was worth the try, the movie is wonderfully paced and has a well brought out story.The film begins with Jennifer (played by Tiffany Amber Thiessen) a young single girl who meets the wrong guy. At first this guy seems nice, wants to help, and even wants to marry and establish a family. Everything goes wrong when they start living together; he becomes a peeping tom and rapist. She begins to suspect on him when he arrives late and begins to lie. Now the story may be a bit generic but the actors do such a good job at bringing something new to an old story that in the end it feels like a whole different story. Great solid flick, it will make me think twice about Lifetime Originals.MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5",4,It's What You Don't Know That Can Kill You,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1122,"['When', 'first', 'checked', 'movie', 'out', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'first', 'thing', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'was', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'not', 'lifetime', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'generic', 'dramatic', 'cover', 'movie', 'had', 'something', 'made', 'change', 'mind', 'look', 'kind', 'spooky', 'picked', 'up', 'viewing', 'was', 'surprised', 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'try', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'paced', 'well', 'brought', 'out', 'story.The', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'played', 'Tiffany', 'Amber', 'Thiessen', 'young', 'single', 'girl', 'who', 'wrong', 'guy', 'first', 'guy', 'nice', 'help', 'even', 'marry', 'establish', 'family', 'Everything', 'wrong', 'when', 'start', 'living', 'together', 'peeping', 'tom', 'rapist', 'suspect', 'when', 'late', 'lie', 'Now', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'generic', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'something', 'new', 'old', 'story', 'end', 'whole', 'different', 'story', 'Great', 'solid', 'flick', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'Lifetime', 'Originals.MY', 'PERSONAL', 'RATING', '4', 'OUT', '5']",The Stranger Beside Me
