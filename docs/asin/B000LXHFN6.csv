1041677,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B000LXHFN6,Julie Neal,"[17, 18]","This DVD features two episodes of the computer-animated ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" television series. The first is an Easter special, Mickey's Great Clubhouse Hunt. In this double-length (49-minute) episode, when Mickey invites his friends over to celebrate the holiday, Pete seeks revenge when he is left out. There's a good song, ""The Best Easter Party Ever."" A second episode, ""Donald Hiccups"", finds the ""duck with all the bad luck"" unable to sing on Clarabelle Cow's TV show when he comes down with the spasms.Both shows include the typical Playhouse Disney dose of basic arithmetic, decision-making, music and puzzles. Other characters appearing include Ludwig von Drake, Chip 'n Dale (briefly), even Willie the Giant from the classic cartoon ""Mickey and the Beanstalk.""
