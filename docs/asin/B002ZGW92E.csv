However, don't be too discouraged. ""Couples Retreat"" isn't all that bad. However, it's not noticeable either. The cast is all great with the exception of Kali Hawk, whose role could've honestly been played by any up-and-comer young pretty thing actress. I enjoyed the other Vince Vaughn-Jon Favreau vehicleFour Christmasesmore than this one.The concept and structure of the story felt all too ""sitcom special-goes-to-Hawaii,"" with each couple's problems magically getting resolved within one vacation. And although I could see a pair like Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl (inKnocked Up - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)) as a couple, the pairing of Vaughn and Malin Akerman seemed a little too unbelievable to me. I know Vaughn's a funny guy and all (I'd love to hang out with the guy), but it felt a bit too plotted and not real. Then again, this is a movie!Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell shine as actors but are annoying as a couple who I would dread if I was friends with them in real life. This movie is enjoyable enough for those who enjoy nice, little romantic comedies, but it shouldn't be at the top of their queue to view.

1314112,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZGW92E,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","Okay, so a while back (a long while back) I was lambasted for scrutinizing `Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married'.  I'm about to get some more heat for this one, but in my opinion, `Couples Retreat' does a far better job handling the same scenario.  Before you start getting all antsy and inching your mouse towards the `unhelpful' button, hear me out.  Tyler Perry's successful film was decent.  It had some good acting and a great message, but Perry doesn't know how to edit himself and thus his film became unapologetically preachy and unbelievably forthright.  It just didn't carry any sense of realism.  The characters wound up feeling more like caricatures than anything else.  Now, I'm not saying that the characters in `Couples Retreat' are more realistic (I mean, come on) but I will say this; the splashes of humor (at times bucketfuls) really help create a more fluid, enjoyable and meaningful film.  Sure, the end results for most of the couples doesn't make a lot of sense (the ending did seem almost thrown together) but the process of getting there seemed to really elaborate on something real.  The film is, without hesitation, a slapstick comedy, but it has a layer of maturity within context that makes it forgivable.  Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau are hilarious here, and they deliver their lines with earnest intensity, which also helps elevate the films obvious direction.  It's a lighthearted comedy, yet it maintains a level of genuine concern that I think sets it apart a bit.  Believe me, this is a surprise to me.  I kind of expected to hate this, or at best consider it serviceable (albeit lazy) entertainment.  In the end, I was actually moved by it.  Like I said, the ending is not very believable, but getting there sheds light on some realistic scenarios and the truth that no relationship is perfect.  In fact, everyone has its fare share of problems.",4,Take that Tyler Perry...,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,1881,"['Okay', 'while', 'back', 'long', 'back', 'was', 'lambasted', 'scrutinizing', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', ""'m"", 'get', 'more', 'heat', 'one', 'opinion', 'Couples', 'Retreat', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'handling', 'same', 'scenario', 'start', 'getting', 'antsy', 'inching', 'mouse', 'unhelpful', 'button', 'hear', 'out', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'successful', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'had', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'message', 'Perry', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'edit', 'thus', 'film', 'became', 'unapologetically', 'preachy', 'unbelievably', 'forthright', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'sense', 'realism', 'characters', 'wound', 'up', 'feeling', 'more', 'caricatures', 'anything', 'else', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'characters', 'Couples', 'Retreat', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'mean', 'come', 'will', 'say', 'splashes', 'humor', 'times', 'bucketfuls', 'really', 'help', 'create', 'more', 'fluid', 'enjoyable', 'meaningful', 'film', 'Sure', 'end', 'results', 'most', 'couples', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'ending', 'did', 'seem', 'almost', 'together', 'process', 'getting', 'there', 'seemed', 'really', 'elaborate', 'something', 'real', 'film', 'hesitation', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'layer', 'maturity', 'context', 'forgivable', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'are', 'hilarious', 'here', 'deliver', 'lines', 'earnest', 'intensity', 'also', 'elevate', 'films', 'obvious', 'direction', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'level', 'genuine', 'concern', 'think', 'sets', 'apart', 'bit', 'Believe', 'surprise', 'kind', 'expected', 'hate', 'best', 'consider', 'serviceable', 'lazy', 'entertainment', 'end', 'was', 'actually', 'moved', 'said', 'ending', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'getting', 'there', 'sheds', 'light', 'realistic', 'scenarios', 'truth', 'relationship', 'perfect', 'fact', 'everyone', 'fare', 'share', 'problems']",N/A

I never rate comedies high to begin with because once you've seen the joke it's never as funny again. Great comedies like Blazzing Saddles and Something About Mary are awesome because they have so much going on. You always seem to find something new and funny with each viewing. Couples Retreat is very funny. It is even funnier if you can relate to 1 of the 4 couples (A divorced couple, A young couple struggling with their marriage, a normal couple with kids and a couple who got married in high school because they got pregnant and feel they missed out on being single). The yoga scene and ""couples building"" scenes really are the best parts of the flick. In the end you walk away from this movie happy and with hope, which is nice in this day and age. Oh!

One couple is going because they need to, the others are going cause they want to party and they want to support their marriage-in-trouble friends. Hilarious right? You'd think. I mean, we've seen Vince Vaughn in ""4 Christmas'"", ""Fred Claus"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Anchorman"", ""Dodgeball"", and Kristen Bell in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", or Jason Bateman who typically is known for T.V. roles is funny in ""Arrested Development"". Yet, I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny, or the trailer just made it look like it was supposed to be funny, but ultimately, the jokes come running at you left and right, but time after time, fail miserably.If you approach this movie in the proper manner, you might enjoy it. The movie is about love and relationships and stress surrounding relationships and and how our quirks can polorize our partner or how we get lost in our lives and forget to tell and show each other how much we care for them. Nothing funny about that. In fact, it's very truthful. That's how COUPLES RETREAT is. It is very truthful about relationships, yet, based on the trailer and its stars, you're looking for FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, or WEDDING CRASHERS and... it isn't.Yet, I'm confused because my intuition tells me that the creators were TRYING for the humor we got in the previous mentioned movies, but their jokes just didn't pan out. It just plain, isn't all that funny.I mean, there's a whole scene of Vince Vaughn stumbling upon a previously stiff employee of the resort playing Guitar hero and they have a Guitar hero competition.

1314129,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZGW92E,Craig Whittle,"[0, 3]","COUPLES RETREATSTARRING: Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Kristen Bell, Faizon Love, Malin Akerman, Kristin Davis, Jean Reno, Kali Hawk, Peter Serafinowicz, Carlos Ponce and Tasha SmithWRITTEN BY: Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn and Dana FoxDIRECTED BY: Peter BillingsleyRated: PG - 13Genre: ComedyRelease Date: 09 October 2009I don't think Vince Vaughn can help but steal any scene he's in. Couples Retreat was lucky to have him; without him the film would have been a mediocre, predictable comedy.It's not a bad movie, but this was not what I was expecting. For a movie starring legends Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Jason Bateman, and co-written by Vaughn and Favreau, it was on the verge of being disappointing. I'm a huge fan of all three, along with the rest of the cast, and have high expectations of them.The film is still entertaining and visually nice to look at. First time director, Peter Billingsley (the little kid from A Christmas Story) captures some amazing, tropical scenery.  It makes the film more likable. It's so perfect that Favreau's character Joey has a great line describing the island looking like a screen saver.Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell play Cynthia and Jason: a couple going through a rough patch. They schedule a meeting with their close friends, who make up three other couples, to shoot them a proposal; a romantic get-away to an island paradise. But ALL must commit in order to get a reduced rate. Cynthia and Jason decide to neglect to mention that they will all have to partake in couple's therapy.Some of the funniest moments in the film were the montages of the couple's therapy sessions. They were well acted and cleverly spliced together, making them even more entertaining. The cast had great chemistry. They were all convincing and led me to believe they would be friends outside of the film. You can catch some hilarious extended versions of these scenes on the DVD.Although Cynthia and Jason's relationship appears to need the most help, the film focuses primarily on couple, Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman).This was no surprise, as Vaughn is hands down one of the best in the biz when it comes to delivering laughs.  Unfortunately, I felt like he was unintentionally carrying the movie. And because he had to focus on bringing everyone else's share of comedy to the table, we weren't really able to indulge in his performance. Yet still, he gives us several humorous moments with well-timed dialogue that is more than satisfactory.Vaughn and Favreau are masters of improvisation but it seemed that they didn't get to dabble in this art as they have so religiously in past films such as the flawless, The Break-Up.  Also, Jason Bateman was good for a few laughs but he too seemed to be constricted from his usual long tangents of dry, sarcastic bliss.About 60 percent of the jokes fall short before the punch-line. There is opportunity after opportunity that could have had us rolling in stitches and instead leave us with only a soft chuckle.Take the scene where Vaughn's character Dave is left to fend for himself in a swarm of vicious sharks. None of the other characters offer any additional comedy whatsoever. This was an unsettling occurrence repeated throughout the entire course of the film.In another scene Favreau attempts to have an `alone time' session, if you will, and it is spoiled by an intruder. This scene had great potential but fell short. I feel he may not have been granted the freedom to take it to the next level.Because of the highly respected, enjoyable talents involved in Couples Retreat, my expectations were set too high and thus were not fulfilled. The film was not a downer and I'm sure a lot of folks will enjoy it immensely. I look forward to all of their future projects and hope they do not again retreat from delivering their full potential of comedy.",4,Couples Retreat Review,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,3849,"['COUPLES', 'RETREATSTARRING', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Kali', 'Hawk', 'Peter', 'Serafinowicz', 'Carlos', 'Ponce', 'Tasha', 'SmithWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Dana', 'FoxDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Peter', 'BillingsleyRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '09', 'October', '2009I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'can', 'help', 'steal', 'scene', 'Couples', 'Retreat', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mediocre', 'predictable', 'comedy.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'movie', 'starring', 'legends', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'co-written', 'Vaughn', 'Favreau', 'was', 'verge', 'being', 'disappointing', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'three', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'them.The', 'film', 'still', 'entertaining', 'visually', 'nice', 'look', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Peter', 'Billingsley', 'little', 'kid', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'amazing', 'tropical', 'scenery', 'film', 'more', 'likable', 'so', 'perfect', 'Favreau', 'character', 'Joey', 'great', 'line', 'describing', 'island', 'looking', 'screen', 'saver.Jason', 'Bateman', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'play', 'Cynthia', 'Jason', 'couple', 'going', 'rough', 'patch', 'schedule', 'meeting', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'three', 'other', 'couples', 'shoot', 'proposal', 'romantic', 'get-away', 'island', 'paradise', 'must', 'commit', 'order', 'get', 'reduced', 'rate', 'Cynthia', 'Jason', 'decide', 'neglect', 'mention', 'will', 'have', 'partake', 'couple', 'therapy.Some', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'were', 'montages', 'couple', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'were', 'well', 'acted', 'cleverly', 'spliced', 'together', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'were', 'convincing', 'led', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'friends', 'film', 'can', 'catch', 'hilarious', 'extended', 'versions', 'scenes', 'DVD.Although', 'Cynthia', 'Jason', 'relationship', 'need', 'most', 'help', 'film', 'primarily', 'couple', 'Dave', 'Vaughn', 'Ronnie', 'Malin', 'Akerman', '.This', 'was', 'surprise', 'Vaughn', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'biz', 'when', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'Unfortunately', 'felt', 'was', 'unintentionally', 'carrying', 'movie', 'had', 'focus', 'bringing', 'everyone', 'else', 'share', 'comedy', 'table', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'able', 'indulge', 'performance', 'still', 'several', 'humorous', 'moments', 'well-timed', 'dialogue', 'more', 'satisfactory.Vaughn', 'Favreau', 'are', 'masters', 'improvisation', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'dabble', 'art', 'have', 'so', 'religiously', 'past', 'films', 'such', 'flawless', 'Break-Up', 'Also', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'was', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'too', 'seemed', 'be', 'constricted', 'usual', 'long', 'tangents', 'dry', 'sarcastic', '60', 'percent', 'jokes', 'fall', 'short', 'punch-line', 'opportunity', 'opportunity', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'rolling', 'stitches', 'instead', 'leave', 'only', 'soft', 'chuckle.Take', 'scene', 'where', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'Dave', 'left', 'fend', 'swarm', 'vicious', 'sharks', 'None', 'other', 'characters', 'offer', 'additional', 'comedy', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'unsettling', 'occurrence', 'repeated', 'entire', 'course', 'film.In', 'scene', 'Favreau', 'have', 'alone', 'time', 'session', 'will', 'spoiled', 'intruder', 'scene', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'fell', 'short', 'feel', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'granted', 'freedom', 'take', 'next', 'level.Because', 'highly', 'respected', 'enjoyable', 'talents', 'involved', 'Couples', 'Retreat', 'expectations', 'were', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'thus', 'were', 'not', 'fulfilled', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'downer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'folks', 'will', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'projects', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'again', 'retreat', 'delivering', 'full', 'potential', 'comedy']",N/A

1314136,A2U2E37IQMBI08,B002ZGW92E,Dr. Feel,"[1, 5]","This was a missed opportunity to make a hilarious movie if ever there was one. The premise is four couples who are friends and each having their own marital problems decide to go on a couples retreat in order to spice up their dull marriages, as suggested by one of the couples who've been experiencing problems conceiving a child for years. They end up at a private, upscale beach resort called ""Eden"". ""Eden West"" specializes in providing counseling for married couples. (The other side of the island is called ""Eden East"" and is for singles.)The premise has all of the right ingredients for a potentially great, fun and hilarious romantic comedy. But the problem with ""Couples Retreat"" is that the dialogue is boring, the jokes are not funny, and there are no real comedians in the movie. Vince Vaughn is OK, and Faizon Love and his ghetto-fabulous girlfriend have a few funny moments. Of the few scenes that will make you LOL, you've already seen in the previews on TV. You'll get all of your laughs in (if you laugh at all) during the first 20 minutes of the film.During the rest of the movie the couples enjoy marriage counseling sessions, yoga, massages, snorkeling and other trivial exercises lead by a strict leader/instructor who tends to be overly philosophical. And get this - the husbands spend 2/3 of the movie bitchin' at each other. That's right, the fellas are cat-fighting while their wives enjoy themselves and eventually end up at ""Eden East"" partying with the singles. Totally stupid! Then the movie ends along the lines of ""The Wizard of Oz"" with the instructor giving each couple a philosophical lecture on love & life, and passing out carved wooden  animals??? I was so glad when this movie ended.Your best bet is to save your money and skip ""Couples Retreat"".

Shenanigans ensure.  We meet the other couples through Vince Vaughn's character who along with Kristin Bell comprise the stable couple (oddly enough).  Jason Bateman is an OCD husband with his and his wife's marital issues as the impetus for the trip, John Favreau can't stand his wife, or her him and Faizon Love's character is separated and just started dating a 20 year old.There are some light comedic moments leading up to the retreat (That's not a real toilet son!) but it seems to take too long to get there.  Once there we know what's going to happen (the ""couples therapy"" will turn out to be mandatory, check, the director makes them do crazy things, check, the yoga instructor will take overly sexualized positions with the class, check) we have but to wait and see if they are funny or not.I'll say that overall I got a few laughs.  Mostly these came along with the dialog of Vince, John and Jason as these three are good at quick witty dialog.  For instance Vince's overreaction to a ""shark attack"" is quite funny, as is John's dialog after getting... over excited... during a massage.  Jason's whole demeanor as a super OCD guy was humorous to me as he seems so laid back in other roles.  Even Faizon's interaction with his 20 year old amused me.  No offense but the ladies were markedly less funny in my opinion in this film.  But with every joke that flew an equal amount fell (as in flat).  John's attempt to... relax himself... which could have been a very funny outrageous moment turned into a lame ""I see nothing"" sort of joke.  Vince's whole job was only there so an extended video game joke could happen later on.On the flip side the movie also tries to take relationships seriously making for an uneven experience.  Am I supposed to laugh then immediately turn pensive to contemplate the seriousness of relationships and therapy?  Some of the therapy sessions were downright serious then at the end we're supposed to laugh at a silly joke.

Along the way they decided to make a movie.  Conveniently enough, the movie is about friends and their spouses taking a vacation.When PowerPoint Ranger Jason (Jason Bateman) and his wife Ronnie (Malin Akerman) start to have problems in their relationship - most likely brought on by their OCD and obsession with slideshows - they drag fellow couples Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell), Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis), & Shane (Faizon Love) and his new fling to Eden, a vacation hot-spot for couples-building that looks like a screen saver, with promises of jet-skiing and beachside alcoholic drinks.  Unfortunately for them, they are going to Eden West, a place for married couples to get new-age counseling with team-building, psychiatry, trust exercises and oddball philosophy involving early awakenings and shark adventures.  What it's lacking, however, is fun; it's lacking Eden East, the singles side of the island.  As contrived and predictable as this is, you already know where this is going.Missing the ""are you for scuba""-vibe fromAlong Came Polly, I spent the majority of the movie, and especially the trailer highlight shark scene - one claimed by many as the most comical - wishing for a repeat of the shark scene fromThe Beach.Despite the cast's obvious chemistry and solid acting, there was just too much kvetching about relationship quandaries to hold throughout the movie, and very little comedy for the mortar.  As I've commented on another's review, the reason the rom-coms lose steam in the last act is the requirement to learn heart warming lessons.  Made all the more unbelievable because the lessons are learned at a party on Eden East, a place and event just as vacuous as the movie itself.  I guess my appreciation for the cast set me up for failure, and potential was not met.Jason Elin",3,"Did you see the trailer?

Everyone else goes as they figure they can have a vacation while Jason and Cynthia work their issues out, but sadly the cheap travel rate they all get comes with the clause that all couples involved must participate.What follows is every couple finding out that not all is well with their current relationships, Jean Reno (""The Professional"") is the head of this therapy session and its quite sad to see him reduced to this type of role. The movie was written by two of the stars Jon Favreau (director of ""Iron Man"") and Vince Vaughn (""Wedding Crashers"") also another writer Dana Fox, but the jokes are very tired, stale and honestly just not funny at all.I do remember that the tropical setting provided some great visuals for the viewer, unfortunately that's all the movie has going for it, well outside of actresses like Kristen Bell and Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") that can easily keep the attention of most male viewers. From the opening scenes, to the couple's all trying to save their marriages and questioning whether its right to stay together or not, to the whole sappy story, it drags on from frame to frame.I really don't get how people like Reno, Favreau & Vaughn who are all credible and at times funny actors get locked into crap like this.

Eden is the tropical island resort that helps couples work out problems in the marriage.  One couple had decided to divorce due to problems conceiving, but this trip was a last chance to make their marriage work.  The other three couples enabled all to go half price, but they did not want counseling - they were there to play, to enjoy the sun and jet ski.Counseling  is mandatory at 6 a.m as a group and then individual couples counseling sessions as well.  A satire of psycho-therapists that cause problems or complicate the couples lives ensues - whether steam baths with snow, snorkeling, yoga, New Age philosophy, or Asian teachings.  It becomes too much for all of them, and nothing is helping.  Soon they all end up on ""Eden East"" - the singles side of the island.

This should NEVER have been marketed as a comedy, it just isn't funny enough. Was ""Thirty-Something"" a comedy?

1314202,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002ZGW92E,Robert Moore,"[2, 4]","This is a moderately entertaining comedy.  The truth is that we are currently at one of the low points in film history for comedies in general and romantic comedies in particular (not that I'm saying that this is in any sense a romantic comedy -- it isn't) and by today's standards, this isn't all that bad.  So while this isn't all that great, by today's standards it is actually a tad above average.  The plot is simple.  A married couple with relationship problems gets a group rate for both them and three of their couple friends to go along with them (which makes no sense internally, because it is repeated several times that the resort has a long waiting list -- who the heck would have a group discount when you have a long waiting list?).  The cast has some people I like, in particular Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) as well as some people that I don't mind, though it also features Vince Vaughan, who I never like, and Jon Favreau, who I sometimes like and sometimes don't.  And can I just add that Kristin Davis looks spectacular?The film has some decent moments, but not enough of them.  The film has too many moments that drag and it has a central premise that leads to conclusions that you pretty much anticipated twenty minutes after it starts.  The writing simply isn't that strong.  But like I said, by today's standards the film is better than average.  I've wondered about this lately.  I think a lot of it is the influence of Jud Apatow on recent film comedy.  I enjoyed his two TV series, but his films have been remarkably bland, but have come to dominate the shape of current film comedy.  So current film comedy is suffering by an endless string of weak imitations of the Apatow Combine.  But I think there is also a staggering lack of creativity at the moment.  There are no great comedy directors, no great comedy writers, and no great comedy actors.  Not too long ago we had people like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks (before he shifted to dramatic roles) making lots of good comedies.  But there are also some inexplicable group lapses in taste.  How else can anyone explain how people like Wil Ferrell and Seth Rogen became stars?  One thing is for sure:  if in fifty years someone does a list of the one hundred great comedies of all time, few and more probably none will come from today.  We are living in the comedic dark ages.So, is this a good movie?  No.  Is it a bad movie?  No.  Is it better than average by today's standards?  Yes.

Vince Vaughn co-wrote the script and I feel that it was much better than the film turned out to be. Despite a talented cast of actors the movie is not as fun to watch as it should really be and leaves much to be desired. I got a few laughs out of Vaughn and Jon Favreau especially and liked Kristen Bell's acting as always but it seems that even those actors couldn't make anything great out of the script. I thought I'd ignore the negative reviews given to this movie give it a chance and enjoy it for what it was.Jason and Cynthia invite other couples to their house to give them a presentation on Eden Island to interest them in a vacation. They announce that things aren't going so well with their own couple and are considering divorce; this will be a therapeutically vacation to them and is a chance for them to turn things around. While Jason and Cynthia work on their relationship and go in couple therapy the other couples are free to enjoy the Island's fun activities. After much arguing the couples all agree to go. When they arrive on Eden they are disappointed to learn that they all have to go through couple therapy which is not what they expected. The idea of sending four couples on an Island vacation mixed up with a few troubles here and there seemed like a somewhat enjoyable movie. Some moments were moderately funny and others came out to be not funny at all, I think some things supposed to make the audience laugh didn't work as thought out. I felt some parts of the movie dragged on and contributed to the movie receiving negative reviews.It's not a horrible movie neither is it excellent, it's a little had to define and ranks somewhere between the two. It does have its fun parts that's for sure and some enjoyable moments but as far as this comedy go it's not really worth more than a rental. You could do a lot worse than rent this movie on a boring night but you could also do much better as well.
