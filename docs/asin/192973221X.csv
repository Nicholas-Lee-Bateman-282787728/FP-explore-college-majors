Demizrahi,"[8, 8]","The Devil's ArithmeticThe Devil's Arithmetic:This is an outstanding visual performance where a Jewish teenager, rather secular indeed, goes against her will and innermost beliefs to celebrate the Passover festivities at an ants' house.  Rather discontent with the festivities, she is chosen by traditions to open a door and then she goes into a trip that will change her religious attitudes forever.She trespasses the limits of time, as inside a time machine, and finds herself immersed into the World War II epoch. She experiences firsthand the atrocities that the Nazis performed on the Jews- and others for that matter- and has first hand understanding of what living in the concentration camps really was about and meant.As I watched this rather inspiring and educational movie, the only thing that crossed my mind was to pass the DVD to my children so they could learn more vividly and insighfully about the Holocaust, its violence, its murderers, its atrocities, and all its nonsense.Of course, I have not read the book on which this movie is based, but for starters, I utterly believe it is a great choice.If you are a Jew, it would be a great idea to pass it to your children, and if you happen not to be a Jew it would also be an extremely educational experience for your children and for all the family.Highly Recommended!",5,Highly Recommended !!!,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1332,"['Devil', 'ArithmeticThe', 'Devil', 'Arithmetic', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'performance', 'where', 'Jewish', 'teenager', 'rather', 'secular', 'indeed', 'will', 'innermost', 'beliefs', 'celebrate', 'Passover', 'festivities', 'ants', 'house', 'discontent', 'festivities', 'chosen', 'traditions', 'open', 'door', 'then', 'trip', 'will', 'change', 'religious', 'attitudes', 'forever.She', 'limits', 'time', 'time', 'machine', 'immersed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'epoch', 'firsthand', 'atrocities', 'Nazis', 'performed', 'Jews-', 'others', 'matter-', 'first', 'hand', 'understanding', 'what', 'living', 'concentration', 'camps', 'really', 'was', 'meant.As', 'watched', 'rather', 'inspiring', 'educational', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'crossed', 'mind', 'was', 'pass', 'DVD', 'children', 'could', 'learn', 'more', 'vividly', 'insighfully', 'Holocaust', 'violence', 'murderers', 'atrocities', 'nonsense.Of', 'course', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'starters', 'utterly', 'believe', 'great', 'choice.If', 'are', 'Jew', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'idea', 'pass', 'children', 'happen', 'not', 'be', 'Jew', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'extremely', 'educational', 'experience', 'children', 'family.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

Decades after.What I know of it, I know of books, movies and stories told to me by those who lived through it and experienced it first hand (or even second hand). To that end, I have no true reference point to say whether or not this movie was true to life. What I do know is that it stayed true to the horrors that were the holocaust. What I do know is that it runs parallell to virtually every story I've ever been told about this horrific series of events.The images are powerful and stark, but not so disturbing that a Junior High child will be scarred for life. I do believe it will move them. I do believe it will give them their first real glimpse into this horrifying period of Mankind's history. It will give them a tiny glimpse into the heart of true EVIL. I do believe it will cause many inquisitive children to want to learn the truth about this tragedy. It will give them pause to talk to Grandma or Great Grandma about what they experienced as a child. It will breed empathy and sympathy. I know this because I've seen it have this effect on kids.The movie itself takes a fantasy approach to a real world, historical event. You're carried into the dream world of Hannah, (Dunst) who is somehow magicaly transported back to the days of World War 2. What she experiences transforms her from a typical ""apathetic"" teen to a wisdom-possessing child on the verge of womanhood. It grants her an understanding of the world few children can ever truly possess. Through this dream (or is it a dream?) her eyes are opened to reality. The line between good and evil becomes a bit more clouded, though the truth about Mankind's existence becomes all too clear.A great way to introduce children to this disturbing period of history. a strong story, worthy of praise.

I wasn't sure what to expect. To be certain, Kirsten Dunst (Hannah) is popular with teens today, yet I could not guess how a film dealing with Passover Seders, Hebrew traditions, and a war so far away from the life of modern teens would go over in my classroom.To my surprise, the film proved to be the most riveting and attention-holding movie I can ever recall showing. In it are contained superb acting, eerie (and effective) musical interludes, and a suspense of time-travel that will hold teenagers absolutely spellbound!Dustin Hoffman's poignant introduction reveals his passion that young people today never forget the holocaust. As long as this film is available to be watched, they won't.At times, the suffering of the Jews (made personal by Dunst's wonderful performance) pushes the emotional limit of what I felt my students could take. Yet, with craft and artistry, we are spared in ""The Devils' Arithmetic"" the emotional overload of ""Schindler's List"". This is as it should be. ""The Devil's Arithmetic"" is geared to teenagers.If ever a theme of love, sacrifice, and the horror of hatred needed portrayal outside the realm of religion, one could not do much better than to show this film. What Hannah does for her best friend at the movie's conclusion is as gut-wrenching as it is predictable, and Nazi treatment of the Jews is brutally captured with appropriate reserve--no easy task! In the end, a young Jewish girl who began only with an interest in tattoos  learns the lessons of history, tradition, and above all--life's priorities. In a nutshell, how lives and a culture can change in an instant is the strength of ""The Devil's Arithmetic"".Be very sure--this film will make a powerful impact on young teens!

Make no mistake, Devil's Arithmatic is brutal and honest -- and definitely not for younger viewers. However, it is  an excellent introduction to the reality of the Holocaust for junior high  or middle school students.Hannah is like most contemporary teenagers --  she'd really rather be with friends than participate in her family's  Passover Seder.(The fact that it's Passover and she's hanging out watching  her friend get a tattoo doesn't even strike her as ironic. Hannah is a  child of the '90s.) She grudgingly does go to the Seder, because, well, she  doesn't have a choice.Instead of actually participating, Hannah gets  tipsy. Then, things start to get interesting.  Devil's Arithmatic is  a lesson distguised as a time-travel story. How Hannah ends up in Poland in  1942 isn't important. She's there. And she's rounded up along with  everybody else. Suddenly,  all those stories old people insist on telling  over and over begin to make sense.The brutality of life in a  concentration camp becomes a living breathing thing -- not just a number on  her Aunt Eva's arm. Being a Jew begins to have meaning she never imagined.  Hannah finds that what you believe can not only give you strength -- it can  define you and your world. More importantly, it can give you the knowledge  to choose. Choice is power. In the the world of the unnamed camp, one can  either choose humanity or spiritual death. Hannah chooses humanity.I  really don't want to reveal too much of the plot, because the twists make  Devil's Arithmatic extremely affecting.Normally, I do not like fiction  about the Holocaust. To me, fictionalising the Shoah is disrepectful; it is  like lying. This movie, however, is respectful and in its own way very  haunting.

The research indicates when any ""human"" group is a target of abuse and exploitation -- the ""human"" group doing the exploitation will deny their victims the creation of their own names and the use of names, marriages, families, their own heritage, their own culture and religion and they will be beaten and starved and tortured and raped and burned and killed one by one or in masses and sometimes the graves are covered up and the existence of the people will be wiped from history.  The people are killed during atrocities by lynchings, burnings, scalpings, gassings, drowings, in any and all ways. It's that other realm, that other spirit, that other side in the comprehension of reality where all this seems sensible and even right.  HOW CAN I DO SUCH RESEARCH? Because there is hope:  We are all human, we all bleed: we can all cooperate to obliterate atrocity from human existence if we can see the light in all of us and help it to ""burn"" (energetically) bright.  This is not just ideal, this is real; it is possible in the human anatomy.  THIS, is what it's all about: fighting the real enemy, fighting the common enemy.  THERE WERE 11-16 million people killed in that German Holocaust, to only speak of one group conspicuously is highly political and there lies the spark and the seeds for future atrocity.  It's called vengeance.  BUT, then again, one who is of that conspicuous ancestry ""currently"" could argue that if their group didn't keep this particular atrocity on the minds of contemporaries, then, atrocity may happen again to others.  BUT, it does happen to others; it is happening to others now because we don't see it as a human (or inhuman(e)) problem. We seem to see it as the problem of one particular conspicuous group as if atrocity is not possible toward all groups.  Some of us are getting there. We can see the horizon. We are beginning to see that war is not the answer to much if at all anything but then ""proper"" INTERVENTIONS are highly necessary when groups go haywire into the other realm.  We can always know who those humans are . . . because they don't look for a way out; they don't look for a way to stop the atrocity. Compromise is forever the higher ground especially when the lower ground is ""unleashed"" atrocity.  So be my sermon.

195758,AAW58LG72PG7I,192973221X,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 3]","THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC belongs to the quasi-real world of time travel.  Mark Twain in A CONNECTICUT YANKEE, Dorothy in THE WIZARD OF OZ and Sam Tyler in LIFE ON MARS all tell a similar tale of one who travels through time and space to meet a past that intermingles with the present. Here, Kirsten Dunst is Hannah Stern a 1990's Jewish girl who cannot comprehend why her elders take their Jewishness so seriously.  At a Passover ceremony, she asks her mother why do we attend such services, and the reply her mother makes (because we have to) is a dramatic counterpoint to the ritual question asked during the Seder ceremony: ""Why is this night different from all other days?""  The answer, of course, is that we choose to make it to remind us that what makes us both human and Jewish is our stubborn unwillingness to forget our blood purchased past merely to embrace the joys of being a Valley Girl.  Hannah is just such a valley girl whose greatest concern is to decide what tattoo to carve on her arm.  This tattoo motife carries somewhat greater import later in the film when Hannah has a different tattoo burned onto her arm--a death camp number.  During the Seder, Hannah drinks too much only to find that she has time and space travelled to Poland in 1941.  There she meets younger versions of her family that in future years make up her relatives in New Rochelle. Soon she is whisked off to a concentration camp where survival is unsure.THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC is a sanitized version of SCHINDLER'S LIST.  The number of deaths is minimized and the actors, though wearing camp garb, are reasonably fit.  Director Donna Deitch intended this as a Showtime television movie suitable for younger audiences, many of whom are probably not unlike Hannah in seeing their Jewish roots as little more than a cracker thing. Deitch takes the novel by Jane Yolen and does not flinch from being melodramatic.  The Bad Guys are stereotypical Nazi camp commandants, possibly since the historically ""real"" Nazis were far more prosaic and mundane in their genocide.  What is worse, the film argues--to kill in the momemt of passion as the Nazis do in this film or to kill as part of a dispassionate Master Plan a Final Solution?  In either case, Hannah can see that the dull lessons learned on the Holocaust are being re-enacted right in front of her knowing eyes.  Dullness, she learns, is a quality that soon disappears when one has a reason to pay attention.  It is this ability to bring life to a horror beyond horrors that imbues THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC with the realization that when one's elders speak in hushed tones of long gone Days of Evil, then the younger generation, like Hannah, ought not to forget why this night is different from all others.",4,Passover: It's the Cracker Thing,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2743,"['DEVIL', 'ARITHMETIC', 'belongs', 'quasi-real', 'world', 'time', 'travel', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'A', 'CONNECTICUT', 'YANKEE', 'Dorothy', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'Sam', 'Tyler', 'LIFE', 'ON', 'MARS', 'tell', 'similar', 'tale', 'one', 'who', 'time', 'space', 'meet', 'past', 'present', 'Here', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Hannah', 'Stern', '1990', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'why', 'elders', 'take', 'Jewishness', 'so', 'seriously', 'Passover', 'ceremony', 'mother', 'why', 'do', 'attend', 'such', 'services', 'reply', 'mother', 'have', 'dramatic', 'counterpoint', 'ritual', 'question', 'asked', 'Seder', 'ceremony', 'Why', 'night', 'different', 'other', 'days', 'answer', 'course', 'choose', 'make', 'remind', 'what', 'human', 'Jewish', 'stubborn', 'unwillingness', 'forget', 'blood', 'purchased', 'past', 'merely', 'embrace', 'joys', 'being', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'Hannah', 'just', 'such', 'valley', 'girl', 'greatest', 'concern', 'decide', 'what', 'tattoo', 'carve', 'arm', 'tattoo', 'motife', 'somewhat', 'greater', 'import', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'Hannah', 'different', 'tattoo', 'burned', 'arm', 'death', 'camp', 'number', 'Seder', 'Hannah', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'find', 'time', 'space', 'travelled', 'Poland', '1941', 'younger', 'versions', 'family', 'future', 'years', 'make', 'up', 'relatives', 'New', 'Rochelle', 'Soon', 'whisked', 'off', 'concentration', 'camp', 'where', 'survival', 'unsure.THE', 'DEVIL', 'ARITHMETIC', 'sanitized', 'version', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'number', 'deaths', 'minimized', 'actors', 'wearing', 'camp', 'garb', 'are', 'reasonably', 'fit', 'Director', 'Donna', 'Deitch', 'intended', 'Showtime', 'television', 'movie', 'suitable', 'younger', 'audiences', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'Hannah', 'seeing', 'Jewish', 'roots', 'little', 'more', 'cracker', 'thing', 'Deitch', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Yolen', 'not', 'flinch', 'being', 'melodramatic', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'Nazi', 'camp', 'commandants', 'possibly', 'historically', 'real', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'prosaic', 'mundane', 'genocide', 'What', 'worse', 'film', 'kill', 'momemt', 'passion', 'Nazis', 'do', 'film', 'kill', 'part', 'dispassionate', 'Master', 'Plan', 'Final', 'Solution', 'case', 'Hannah', 'can', 'see', 'dull', 'lessons', 'learned', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'being', 're-enacted', 'right', 'front', 'knowing', 'eyes', 'Dullness', 'quality', 'soon', 'when', 'one', 'reason', 'pay', 'attention', 'ability', 'bring', 'life', 'horror', 'horrors', 'imbues', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'ARITHMETIC', 'realization', 'when', 'one', 'elders', 'speak', 'hushed', 'tones', 'long', 'gone', 'Days', 'Evil', 'then', 'younger', 'generation', 'Hannah', 'ought', 'not', 'forget', 'why', 'night', 'different', 'others']",N/A

Young,"[0, 0]","The book, The Devil's Arithmatic was pretty much introduced me to the suffering that millions of people suffered in the concentration camps during the Holocaust. When I saw that there was a movie based on the book, I was interested and cautious because Kirsten Dunst was in the leading role of Hannah who looked to be about sixteen years old on the cover when Hannah was about twelve in the book. Don't be worried, while they changed some of parts of the story, it is just as powerful as the book. Both Kirsten Dunst and Brittany Murphy were wonderful in their roles and their friendship was beautiful. The movie is about Jewish teenager, Hannah Stern who would rather hang out with her friends instead of going her families Passover Sedar and hear about her relatives talk about the past. But when she symbolicly opens the door to let in the prophet Elijah, she finds herself in Europe of the 1940s. Things go from bad to worse when everyone in the Jewish village her family is living is taken by the Nazis to a concentration camp. I feel that one of the most powerful scene in the movie was when Hannah stare in horror at her concentration camp tattoo and says that she could never believe that she ever wanted a tattoo of her own. I also enjoyed how Hannah was able to keep hopes of the people in the camp alive by telling stories like the Wizard of Oz to them. Hannah's choice in the end is both tragic and powerful since you grow to care about Hannah herself. I think that this is a movie that everyone needs to see so they can learn about this tragic time in history and make sure that something like this never happens again.",5,"Not like the book, but just as good.",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,1632,"['book', 'Devil', 'Arithmatic', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'introduced', 'suffering', 'millions', 'people', 'suffered', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Holocaust', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'was', 'interested', 'cautious', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'leading', 'role', 'Hannah', 'who', 'looked', 'be', 'sixteen', 'years', 'old', 'cover', 'when', 'Hannah', 'was', 'twelve', 'book', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'worried', 'changed', 'parts', 'story', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'book', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'were', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'friendship', 'was', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'teenager', 'Hannah', 'Stern', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'hang', 'out', 'friends', 'instead', 'going', 'families', 'Passover', 'Sedar', 'hear', 'relatives', 'talk', 'past', 'when', 'symbolicly', 'door', 'let', 'prophet', 'Elijah', 'Europe', '1940s', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'everyone', 'Jewish', 'village', 'family', 'living', 'taken', 'Nazis', 'concentration', 'camp', 'feel', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Hannah', 'stare', 'horror', 'concentration', 'camp', 'tattoo', 'could', 'never', 'believe', 'ever', 'wanted', 'tattoo', 'own', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Hannah', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'hopes', 'people', 'camp', 'alive', 'telling', 'stories', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Hannah', 'choice', 'end', 'tragic', 'powerful', 'grow', 'care', 'Hannah', 'think', 'movie', 'everyone', 'see', 'can', 'learn', 'tragic', 'time', 'history', 'make', 'sure', 'something', 'never', 'again']",N/A

It is also a delicate subject to discuss, read about, or watch on the big screen.I rented this movie because I am a fan of Ms. Dunst and because this time period in history fascinates me.  I can barely stand to think about the Holocaust, yet it is something that keeps calling my name, so I try to read about it and learn all I can.This movie -- also a book -- was well done.  A young girl, a typical teenager who does not want to partake in her family's religious rituals or listen to stories from the survivors of death camps, is magically transported back to 1941.  The entire town, including Hannah, are immediately picked up and put into a death camp.  This would include her favorite aunt, who is now a young teenage girl in 1941.  A few other 1980 relatives are also present at the camps.  As Hannah's story is told we are witness to such tragedy and evil, yet the goodness of human nature is also evident over and over again.Ms. Dunst plays Hannah, past and present with style and grace. The conditions of concentration camps are horrible enough when reading about them but when you actually see and hear and witness this first-hand through the wonder of movies, it is heart-breaking.I totally enjoyed this movie and cried myself senseless throughout.  Because senseless is what the Holocaust was.  If movies like this can help educate and show people how things were, it is a great learning tool.

Called upon to symbolically ""open the door"" for the prophet Elijah, the blase teen is transported back to 1941 Poland as a completely different Hannah. According to her cousin Rivkah (Brittany Murphy), a sweet girl her own age, she's still recovering from an illness that killed her parents so she and Rivkah's mother Mina (Lilo Baur) are her only family now. While attending a local wedding, Hannah along with all of the villagers are rounded up and sent to a Nazi death camp. Hannah knows what horrors lay ahead and experiences the hardships and torment of her ancestors firsthand and ponders ""What's worse? Knowing or not knowing?""Based on the famous children's book, The Devil's Arithmetic does a great job of showing young people how important it is to remember the atrocity that was the Holocaust so that we might never allow anything like it to happen again. Fans of the book should know that some elements of the novel are slightly altered and a few characters are missing, but it doesn't radically change the story. There is some violence, but it's mild and therefore more appropriate for the target audience.I liked the nod to the film The Wizard of Oz in that some people and situations Hannah encounters in her regular life are mirrored by those in Poland. The way it was executed was admirable.Kirsten Dunst's acting could've used some work (sometimes she comes across forced and almost wooden), but she does well for the most part trying to make sense of the desolate misery she's found herself in while also losing her memory of her past life as time goes on. The one who really steals the show is the late Brittany Murphy. Everything from her authentic Polish accent and wide, expressive eyes to her kind, delicate spirit on the verge of breaking is downright spellbinding. It's a shame she's no longer with us.If you need a flick to help educate a young crowd about the Holocaust, be sure to pop in The Devil's Arithmetic.

This was a good, entertaining movie which I would recommend. Certainly it is a story that has been told before, this one is somewhat different as it presents a time travel element.Because it is about Jews ""the conspicuous people"" as Margarert calls them, she deems this unnecessary viewing as other people have been hurt too.The Nazi Regime and its allies deliberately murdured 6.6 million people, 5.9 million of those were Jews. These were not innocent civilians killed as a byproduct of a modern/mechanized war (collateral damage). Yes, many millions of innocent civilians were killed as a result of bombing, shelling, and other sad aspects of war. That is terrible enough. These 6.6 million were robbed of their citizenship, property, and transported to industrialized killing centers in a preplanned methodically executed continental campaign to wipe out a people from existence. This had never happened before, and has not since on such a large scale.Because these people were murdered specifically because of their religion, and have been victim to smaller yet perpetual atrociities through out history, makes it interesting. How can such a people endure?, yet they do. This is real life drama, and drama is what movie makers are looking for. That is why we see it portrayed so much in film.Should we see the portrayel of other atrocities, yes we should, and finally we are seeing some. Most recently the atrocities of mass murder are revelaed on screen in the well done ""Hotel Rwanda"". We still have not seen too much portraying the millions killed in Stalin's assassination machine and Russia is still trying to cope with its murderous recent history. But is it the ""conspicuous people's"" fault we don't see this in the movies?I agree any atrocitiy committed on any people is horrible, but to blame the Jews for being the victims of atrocities and monopolizing the media's portrayal of atrocities is the type of behavior that leads to more atrocities. Her views specifically lead to atrocities on Jews. For that reason we need to continue to show what happened to these people and must continue doing so.So thumbs up for the Devil's Arithmetic",4,A Necessary Story,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2243,"['first', 'review', 'write', 'response', 'Margaret', 'review', 'listed', 'earlier', 'was', 'good', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'Certainly', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'before', 'one', 'somewhat', 'different', 'time', 'travel', 'Jews', 'conspicuous', 'people', 'Margarert', 'unnecessary', 'viewing', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'hurt', 'too.The', 'Nazi', 'Regime', 'allies', 'deliberately', 'murdured', '6.6', 'million', 'people', '5.9', 'million', 'were', 'Jews', 'were', 'not', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'killed', 'byproduct', 'modern/mechanized', 'war', 'collateral', 'damage', 'Yes', 'many', 'millions', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'were', 'killed', 'result', 'bombing', 'shelling', 'other', 'sad', 'aspects', 'war', 'terrible', 'enough', '6.6', 'million', 'were', 'robbed', 'citizenship', 'property', 'transported', 'industrialized', 'killing', 'centers', 'preplanned', 'methodically', 'executed', 'continental', 'campaign', 'wipe', 'out', 'people', 'existence', 'had', 'never', 'happened', 'not', 'large', 'scale.Because', 'people', 'were', 'murdered', 'specifically', 'religion', 'have', 'been', 'victim', 'smaller', 'yet', 'perpetual', 'atrociities', 'history', 'interesting', 'How', 'can', 'such', 'people', 'endure', 'yet', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'drama', 'what', 'movie', 'makers', 'are', 'looking', 'why', 'see', 'portrayed', 'so', 'much', 'film.Should', 'see', 'portrayel', 'other', 'atrocities', 'should', 'finally', 'are', 'seeing', 'Most', 'recently', 'atrocities', 'mass', 'murder', 'are', 'revelaed', 'screen', 'well', 'done', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'portraying', 'millions', 'killed', 'Stalin', 'assassination', 'machine', 'Russia', 'still', 'trying', 'cope', 'murderous', 'recent', 'history', 'conspicuous', 'people', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movies', 'agree', 'atrocitiy', 'committed', 'people', 'horrible', 'blame', 'Jews', 'being', 'victims', 'atrocities', 'monopolizing', 'media', 'portrayal', 'atrocities', 'type', 'behavior', 'more', 'atrocities', 'views', 'specifically', 'lead', 'atrocities', 'Jews', 'reason', 'need', 'continue', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'people', 'must', 'continue', 'doing', 'so.So', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Devil', 'Arithmetic']",N/A

In this Showtime made-for-TV adaptation, introduced and produced by Dustin Hoffman (himself from a family of Polish Jews), the novel is brought to life in a way that shows younger viewers the horrors of the Holocaust without being overtly gory.Modern teenager Hannah Stern resents being made to participate in her Aunt Eva's Passover celebrations, feeling no attachment to her religion.  As her relatives, all concentration camp survivors, try to recount their experiences, Hannah turns away, bored.  All of this changes as Hannah is chosen to perform the ritual act of opening the door for the Prophet Elijah--instead of the hallway of her aunt's apartment, Hannah is transported to rural Jewish Poland, circa 1941.Hannah attempts to make sense of her old life, and the girl her new Polish ""family"" expects her to be.  As time passes, more and more of her old life becomes a dream.  Hannah and her cousin Rivkah explore the town before attending a wedding, at which point Nazis round up the wedding guests and load them onto trucks.The remainder of the film focuses on the day-to-day struggle to live in the concentration camp in powerful moments of stolen identities: the grim shearing of hair, the painful tattoos of blue numbers, the bitter cold and backbreaking labour.  Although this is a children's film, there are plenty of grim realities: the beating and hanging of several men who attempt to escape, women suffocating in a gas chamber.Several previous reviewers have mentioned inaccuracies (swing music, banned by Hitler in 1938, is played in a lounge), but despite the small flaws, for a low-budget film, it captures the drama and power of the original novel.  Much of the original plot has been changed, mostly for the better, but readers may find some transitions confusing.The film's acting, cinematography, costumes, and sound editing are all top-notch.  There are moments of quiet beauty, of love that transcends time, of the will to survive against the odds.  Kirsten Dunst gives a stunning performance as a spoiled teen that learns the meaning of ultimate sacrifice, cherishing her heritage and religion when confronted with the horrors of the Holocaust.

Snedden ""SilverAquarius""","[1, 1]","Dustin Hoffman's poignant introduction reveals his passion that young people today never forget the  horrors of the holocaust.  To my surprise, the film proved to be a most riveting and attention-holding movie, ""The Devil's Arithmetic"" is geared to teenagers.Modern teenager Hannah Stern, feeling no attachment to her religion, resents being made to participate in her Aunt Eva's Passover celebrations,. As her relatives, all concentration camp survivors, try to recount their experiences, Hannah turns away, bored. All of this changes as Hannah is chosen to perform the ritual act of opening the door for the Prophet Elijah--instead of the hallway of her aunt's apartment, Hannah is transported to rural Jewish Poland, circa 1941.Hannah attempts to make sense of her old life, and the girl her new Polish ""family"" expects her to be. As time passes, Hannah and her cousin Rivkah explore the town before attending a wedding, at which point Nazis round up the wedding guests and load them onto trucks going to the concentration campIf ever a theme of love, sacrifice, and the horror of hatred needed portrayal outside the realm of religion, one could not do much better than to show this film. What Hannah does for her best friend at the movie's conclusion is as gut-wrenching as it is predictable, and Nazi treatment of the Jews is brutally captured with appropriate reserve--no easy task! In the end, a young Jewish girl who began only with an interest in tattoos learns the lessons of history, tradition, and above all--life's priorities. In a nutshell, how lives and a culture can change in an instant is the strength of ""The Devil's Arithmetic"".Be very sure--this film will make a powerful impact on young teens! The dropping of the gas pellets at the conclusion of the dream sequence is intense...very intense. Yet how can the Holocaust be portrayed without such reality? With younger teenagers, take care that background preparation, as well as a reflective time for discussion is provided.",4,Excellent Resources fosr World War II When Used with the Book,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,1995,"['Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'poignant', 'introduction', 'passion', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'never', 'forget', 'horrors', 'holocaust', 'surprise', 'film', 'proved', 'be', 'most', 'riveting', 'attention-holding', 'movie', 'Devil', 'Arithmetic', 'geared', 'teenagers.Modern', 'teenager', 'Hannah', 'Stern', 'feeling', 'attachment', 'religion', 'resents', 'being', 'made', 'participate', 'Aunt', 'Eva', 'Passover', 'celebrations', 'relatives', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivors', 'try', 'recount', 'experiences', 'Hannah', 'away', 'bored', 'changes', 'Hannah', 'chosen', 'perform', 'ritual', 'act', 'opening', 'door', 'Prophet', 'Elijah', 'instead', 'hallway', 'aunt', 'apartment', 'Hannah', 'transported', 'rural', 'Jewish', 'Poland', 'circa', '1941.Hannah', 'attempts', 'make', 'sense', 'old', 'life', 'girl', 'new', 'Polish', 'family', 'be', 'time', 'passes', 'Hannah', 'cousin', 'Rivkah', 'explore', 'town', 'attending', 'wedding', 'point', 'Nazis', 'round', 'up', 'wedding', 'guests', 'load', 'trucks', 'going', 'concentration', 'campIf', 'ever', 'theme', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'horror', 'hatred', 'needed', 'portrayal', 'realm', 'religion', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'film', 'What', 'Hannah', 'best', 'friend', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'as', 'gut-wrenching', 'predictable', 'Nazi', 'treatment', 'Jews', 'brutally', 'captured', 'appropriate', 'reserve', 'easy', 'task', 'end', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'who', 'began', 'only', 'interest', 'tattoos', 'lessons', 'history', 'tradition', 'life', 'priorities', 'nutshell', 'how', 'lives', 'culture', 'can', 'change', 'instant', 'strength', 'Devil', 'Arithmetic', 'very', 'sure', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'powerful', 'impact', 'young', 'teens', 'dropping', 'gas', 'pellets', 'conclusion', 'dream', 'sequence', 'intense', 'very', 'intense', 'how', 'can', 'Holocaust', 'be', 'portrayed', 'such', 'reality', 'younger', 'teenagers', 'take', 'care', 'background', 'preparation', 'as', 'well', 'reflective', 'time', 'discussion', 'provided']",N/A
195771,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,192973221X,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""The Devil's Arithmetic"" is the movie adaptation (there's an excellent introduction by Dustin Hoffman) of Jane Yolen's book of the same name. Fans of the book looking for a faithful adaptation will be disappointed, but I still found this an engrossing watch. It is one of the few movies about the Holocaust apart from the three screen versions of The Diary of Anne FrankThe Diary of Anne Frank,The Diary of Anne Frank, andThe Diary of Anne Frank (As Seen On BBC)that portrays the point of view of a teenager enduring the Holocaust without being overly graphic in its depiction of brutality, and thus  proves invaluable as a resource for use in History, Social Studies, and Language Arts lessons at the middle school level and up.Kirsten Dunst plays Hannah, a young Jewish girl who feels detached from her Jewish identity and disinterested in learning about her culture. Whilst attending (out of reluctance) a relative's Sabbath meal, Hannah is chosen to open the door for Elijah, and when she enters the room, she finds herself transported to a different time altogether - that of 1941 Poland, where she finds herself under the care of her aunt and cousin Rivka (Brittany Murphy). Hannah struggles to come to terms with this amazing change in her life, and just when she thinks events could not possibly get worse, she finds herself, Rivka and the rest of the Jewish population in their small village rounded up by the Nazis and taken to a concentration camp. Hannah endures a lot - hunger, mental turmoil, fear, etc. but still manages to 'entertain' the other female inmates with her fantastical stories which actually describe her life back in the present day. Hannah also finds herself making some life-changing choices towards the end.As I said, the movie is not exactly an exact translation of the book and neither does it accurately portray all aspects of camp life (it is not even stated which camp the Jews are incarcerated in, and there were no kapos or supervisors in the camp), but I think it is well-made enough to appeal to a teenage audience and can be used as a valuable teaching tool in the classroom. The main actors especially Dunst and Murphy do a credible job in conveying the fear and turmoil they experience as they are abused and imprisoned in the camp. The ending is quite powerful and makes for excellent discussion.
