1695320,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00J2G4ZJU,Cindy Navarro,"[0, 0]","When Calls the Heart: A Telling Silence is a feature length film made from episodes of the television series, When Calls the Heart. The series is the story of Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), a teacher who was raised in a wealthy family but whose first assignment is a small coal mining town that recently suffered a tragedy that resulted in the deaths of many of the miners. Another newcomer, Canadian Mountie, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing), and Elizabeth have sparks flying with a few clashes but also a budding romance and friendship developing.In this episode, young Rosaleen (Mamie Laverock) has not spoken since the mining accident which took the life of her father. Elizabeth reaches out to help her young student, and is highly suspicious of a man who seems to strike fear into the child each time she sees him. She brings her concerns to Jack and it looks like her fears may have been realized when Rosaleen suddenly disappears.Jack is also busy investigating the suspicious fire that destroyed the town church. The pastor (Adrian Hough) is getting a lot of pressure from the head of the mining company about the drop in attendance, especially since the townspeople are flocking to hear Cat Montgomery (Chelah Horsdal) speak each Sunday. Cat lost her husband during the mining accident, and was one of the few who did not attend the memorial service. Evidence is building against her and even her son, Gabe (Mitchell Kummen) has doubts of his mom's innocence.My Review: I love this series! The characters are people you get to know and love ( or loathe) as their stories unfold. There is enough drama, comedy, mystery, and romance to keep my attention, and leaving me wanting to see more of the story. This particular episode revealed new layers to one of my favorites, Cat Montgomery. (The actor who plays her son always stand out to me; I expect to see a lot more of Mitchell Kummen in the future.) There was much to be learned from the this storyline, but it was achieved through the art of telling a story and telling it well. Ken LaZebnik wrote this episode and it was directed by Michael Landon Jr.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received the above DVD for free from Edify Media in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

It was the third dvd in the When Calls the Heart movie series, A Telling Silence. The only thing missing was the popcorn. Should have thought ahead on that one. ~smile~Elizabeth Thatcher is a young teacher working to make a difference in the company coal mining town of Coal Valley on the western Canadian frontier. Jack Thornton is a Canadian Mountie assigned to the town to keep the law. Sparks fly when a young girl disappears and the town must find her. Elizabeth's friend is accused of burning down the town church, and Jack must investigate. This puts everyone in an uproar. The local pastor is accusing, the local drunk is frightening, the local coal boss is intimidating, and Jack and Elizabeth must make sense of it all. He comes across as the knight in red wool in this family friendly movie. Throw in a little puppy love and a whole lot of family love, and it makes for an entertaining and safe for all ages movie.

Such is the case in the latest DVD addition to the When Calls The Heart series that has been showcased on the Hallmark Channel from best selling author Janette Oke. In A Telling Silence, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) is called upon to investigate the destruction of the town's church that was destroyed by a fire. The church's pastor believes that it wasn't an accident and asks Jack to look into a possible cause by Cat Montgomery, one of the women in town that has taken it upon herself to continue church services among the trees until a new church is built. But did Cat really have anything to do with burning down the church? What evidence will Jack uncover that will point to one of the only people in town to have purchased whale oil, the cause of the fire?While Jack continues to look for other sources of who purchased the whale oil, Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), Coal Valley's school teacher notices that Rosaleen Sullivan fails to speak due to what her mother believes was caused by losing her father in the coal mine explosion. Yet as intelligent as Rosaleen appears, Elizabeth believes there is more to her story than anyone realizes. Especially when she seems more than terrified of a strange man that appears in town. Elizabeth believes that there is more to the story than anyone knows and convinces Jack to investigate the circumstances surrounding the child's fear. But will Elizabeth believe what Jack discovers or will she take matters into her own hands?Fan's of Little House on the Prairie will love this timeless series that Janette Oke breathed life into and with the direction of Michael Landon Jr have brought it to reality through Hallmark Channel. Now available on DVD through Word Films, A Telling Silence is the third DVD to bring this series back into your home. The romantic tension between constable Jack Thornton and Elizabeth Thatcher is pure romantic chemistry and show cases the lives of the residents of Coal Valley, a town created by the Northwest Mining company. When an explosion claimed the lives of many of the town's men, the women remained to raise their children and took it upon themselves to hire Miss Thatcher as a school teacher. Believing there is more to life than coal mining, she reaches out to her students in extraordinary ways.I received When Calls the Heart: A Telling Silence compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own.
