I will readily agree that there are some wonderful aspects to this film.  The cinematography is quite good and the acting by the three main leads is excellent.  But there are problems that bear mentioning. The story definitely follows a common Chinese convention of melodrama, which seems odd and unreal given the realistic portrayal of settings and even facial expressions, done with exacting detail. On top of this, the movie is ponderously slow in places, which actually took away some of the rich texture and tone of the movie.  Worst of all was the soundtrack.  It is pure ""lifetime television"" type of music, and grossly overplayed in so many scenes (to help establish emotional content)as to become downright annoying. In effect, the music tells us what we're supposed to be feeling.  Done to the extent as in this movie, it is a poor excuse for the lack of emotions that should be coming from the acting and the story itself.  Finally, the name, ""Eternal Summer"". What's it mean?  How does it tie into the plot? the setting? or anything else for that matter?! I haven't a clue.  Did I like this movie. Well, yes, actually.  But the deep sentimentality evoked isn't enough to cover or excuse some of its other (obvious) flaws.

1095168,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000UJ48PO,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 8]","The plot of ""Sheng xia guang nian"" (""Eternal Summer"") (2006) is a common and simple one:  a case of unrequitted love, of a shy, studious young man for his more popular, athletic best friend.  The difference, in this film from Taiwan, is in the telling, in the hands of a skilled director working with a cast of talented young actors.  It essentially forcuses in on the blurred line between ""best friends"" and ""love"" between two young men from childhood through their university days.It is a teacher who first brings them together, with a plan that Jonathan's study habits and obedient nature will rub off on class troublemaker Shane.  The two develop a close working relationship, which carries them through their teen years, where it becomes obvious to the camera that Jonathan has a crush on Shane, who is the star of their high school basketball team.  As they make the transition to the university, a new girl in school comes between them.  First interested attracted to Jonathan, but guessing that he isn't interested in a sexual relationship with any girl, she pursues and begins an affair with Shane, which they keep from Jonathan so as to not ""distract"" him from his studies.  Not surprisingly, the later revelation of their secret drives the two friends apart, despite Shane's perhaps-drunken attentions to Jonathan to smooth things over.Beautifully photographed, well-acted and generally realistic in the character portrayals, I only had two problems with the film.  The first, relatively minor, is the music, which I found to be overly dramatic and really not fitting the mood of the scenes.  I also didn't like the end of the film, which left unresolved the basic question posed at the end of my first paragraph above.  I would have liked to hear the characters open up with their feelings a lot more than they did.  Other than that, this is a great film, one of the best gay Asian films I have seen.  Film is in Mandarin, with subtitles. Unrated, but likely would be an R for gay content, partial nudity and simulated sexual activity.  DVD has director and actors' commentaries, deleted scenes and both the US and Taiwan trailers. I'd rate it four stars out of five.",4,"Sweet, beautiful story of unrequitted love, leaves one wanting more.",1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2179,"['plot', 'Sheng', 'xia', 'guang', 'nian', 'Eternal', 'Summer', '2006', 'common', 'simple', 'one', 'case', 'unrequitted', 'love', 'shy', 'studious', 'young', 'man', 'more', 'popular', 'athletic', 'best', 'friend', 'difference', 'film', 'Taiwan', 'telling', 'hands', 'skilled', 'director', 'working', 'cast', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'essentially', 'blurred', 'line', 'best', 'friends', 'love', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'childhood', 'university', 'days.It', 'teacher', 'who', 'first', 'together', 'plan', 'Jonathan', 'study', 'habits', 'obedient', 'nature', 'will', 'rub', 'off', 'class', 'troublemaker', 'Shane', 'two', 'develop', 'close', 'working', 'relationship', 'teen', 'years', 'where', 'obvious', 'camera', 'Jonathan', 'crush', 'Shane', 'who', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'make', 'transition', 'university', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'First', 'interested', 'attracted', 'Jonathan', 'guessing', ""n't"", 'interested', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'girl', 'affair', 'Shane', 'keep', 'Jonathan', 'so', 'as', 'not', 'distract', 'studies', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'later', 'revelation', 'secret', 'two', 'friends', 'apart', 'Shane', 'perhaps-drunken', 'attentions', 'Jonathan', 'smooth', 'things', 'over.Beautifully', 'photographed', 'well-acted', 'generally', 'realistic', 'character', 'portrayals', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'problems', 'film', 'first', 'relatively', 'minor', 'music', 'found', 'be', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'really', 'not', 'fitting', 'mood', 'scenes', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'film', 'left', 'unresolved', 'basic', 'question', 'posed', 'end', 'first', 'paragraph', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'characters', 'open', 'up', 'feelings', 'lot', 'more', 'did', 'Other', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'gay', 'Asian', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'Film', 'Mandarin', 'subtitles', 'Unrated', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'R', 'gay', 'content', 'partial', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'activity', 'DVD', 'director', 'actors', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'US', 'Taiwan', 'trailers', ""'d"", 'rate', 'four', 'five']",N/A

1095170,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000UJ48PO,Grady Harp,"[12, 12]","ETERNAL SUMMER (Sheng xia guang nian) is a delicate, quiet, understated and eloquent study of youthful interpersonal relationships form Taiwanese  director Leste Chen from a screenplay by Cheng-Ping Hsu based on the novel by the same name by Chi-yao Wang. The style of the film allows a wide audience to appreciate the sexual challenges of teenagers and understand the need for finding love and acceptance in a world at times too busy to care.The story begins in grade school where Jonathan Kang (Bryant Chang) is a gifted student asked to 'supervise' another young boy in his class, Shane Yu (the dazzlingly gifted young actor Joseph Chang) who has an apparent learning disorder/attention deficit.  Shane is rambunctious and athletically gifted  while Jonathan is the quiet, reserved, brilliant student.  The boys bond as children and grow up together into young men facing the exams for university entrance. A young girl Carrie (Kate Yeung) meets the two boys: first she challenges the studious Jonathan to take a trip to Taipei (ditching school) where she hopes to have a physical encounter.  The hotel room is a disaster and Jonathan feels isolated from both Carrie's desires and from deserting his duties at school - and with Shane, who Jonathan loves far more than merely a best friend.  Shane gradually moves into Jonathan's position as Carrie's physical companion and the resulting triangle results in confessions and incidents that allow each of the three involved young people to grow and understand the spectrum of love.The story is captured with exceptionally beautiful cinematic effects by cinematographer Charlie Lam and the atmosphere of play and passion is enhanced by the musical score by Jeffrey Cheng.  Yet it is the sensitive direction by Leste Chen that encourages the three superb young actors to become immersed in their roles. Chen knows when to say enough (the sex scenes are sensual and suggestive without even approaching an R rating) and when to allow scenes of quiet and eye contact to carry the drama. This is a very fine film that deserves a wide audience, both young and old.  Highly recommended. In Mandarin with English subtitles.

1095171,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000UJ48PO,J. Martin,"[0, 0]","The only consistently outstanding thing about Eternal Summer is the photography. It's gorgeous. There are times when the way the camera moves through a scene is so fascinating, so evocative and sensual, that I neither know nor care what the actors are doing - which is a good thing, because they're rarely doing anything worth watching.The girl and the boy who plays Shane are pretty good sometimes, and the boy who plays Jonathan is great in the very first scene, when he looks into the camera and smiles before leading us out the door and into the past - his only smile in the whole movie.The mostly piano score stays comfortably in the background except in crucial scenes, when it swells intrusively and annoyingly in its attempt to force us to be caught up in the drama we see, and succeeds only in detracting from it.The big sex scene is sweet enough, but it's about as believable as if Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford did one. Some straight actors can pull it off - better than many gay actors - but not these two.I like the slightly ambiguous ending, but the fact that the whole movie is a flashback means the first scene helps a lot in tying the end together. The story is unusual enough that it could have been interesting, and it actually is, sometimes, but not often enough to carry the movie.There's nothing new about a gay boy in love with his straight best friend, or about a girl who's in love with the gay but settles for the straight. What IS new is the marvelous extent to which this straight guy is willing to become whatever his friend needs him to be - without at all compromising his strong sense of himself - and with no resentment at all, no holding his nose while he does something that disgusts him, no hint of martyrdom - only love.That alone makes this movie - despite its many weaknesses and faults - very special. If there actually were even one such straight man on the face of the earth, this world would be a better place.(The DVD cover is misleading. There is no such scene in the movie, with the three of them lying entwined together in the sand, or anywhere else - not even in the deleted scenes.)",4,"Beautifully photographed, mostly disjointed and mediocre, but with one story point so great it makes it all worthwhile",1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,2132,"['only', 'consistently', 'outstanding', 'thing', 'Eternal', 'Summer', 'photography', 'gorgeous', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'way', 'camera', 'scene', 'so', 'fascinating', 'so', 'evocative', 'sensual', 'know', 'care', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'good', 'thing', ""'re"", 'rarely', 'doing', 'anything', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'girl', 'boy', 'who', 'Shane', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'sometimes', 'boy', 'who', 'Jonathan', 'great', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'camera', 'smiles', 'leading', 'door', 'past', 'only', 'smile', 'whole', 'movie.The', 'mostly', 'score', 'stays', 'comfortably', 'background', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'when', 'intrusively', 'annoyingly', 'attempt', 'force', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'drama', 'see', 'only', 'detracting', 'it.The', 'big', 'sex', 'scene', 'sweet', 'enough', 'as', 'believable', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'did', 'one', 'straight', 'actors', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'better', 'many', 'gay', 'actors', 'not', 'two.I', 'slightly', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'flashback', 'first', 'scene', 'lot', 'tying', 'end', 'together', 'story', 'unusual', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'actually', 'sometimes', 'not', 'often', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie.There', 'nothing', 'new', 'gay', 'boy', 'love', 'straight', 'best', 'friend', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'gay', 'settles', 'straight', 'What', 'new', 'marvelous', 'extent', 'straight', 'guy', 'willing', 'become', 'friend', 'be', 'compromising', 'strong', 'sense', 'resentment', 'holding', 'nose', 'something', 'hint', 'martyrdom', 'only', 'alone', 'movie', 'many', 'weaknesses', 'faults', 'very', 'special', 'actually', 'were', 'even', 'one', 'such', 'straight', 'man', 'face', 'earth', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'DVD', 'cover', 'misleading', 'such', 'scene', 'movie', 'three', 'lying', 'entwined', 'together', 'sand', 'anywhere', 'else', 'not', 'even', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

1095173,A3SZOI769OV86F,B000UJ48PO,Mike Ross,"[1, 1]","This is an brilliant, absolutely beautiful film. It has been described, here and elsewhere, as gorgeous, delicate, exquisitely touching, poignant, affecting, and sublime; I echo and add to those sentiments as well.  The screenplay is intelligent and the direction, photography, music, editing, and the exceptional and high calibre of acting bring this film into the category of true excellence.I won't re-iterate the plot or sketch the principal characters, as this has been done amply by other reviewers, but I would like to add the movie gives generous room for character development, arriving at a fully rounded, vibrantly coloured portrayal of each individual lead. The characters, the relationships are multi-layered, and like peering through several panes of coloured glass, we can see certain nuances, emotional intensities and thoughts exposed just below the surface. The actors are absolutely wonderful in their roles, and the sense that these are people who have known each other for a long time and can gauge each other is readily apparent. The camera work is incisive, introspective, showing stolen glances, hidden insecurities, suppressed silences, fleeting thoughts, emotional pangs, and unrequited love -- teenage angst, all reflected in the smallest of gestures, haunted faces and turbulent eyes. Like music, where the spaces between the notes have as much import as the notes themselves, the quiet scenes, the silent passages, most often carry the most impact and take the film to greater emotional depths and searing heights.As in many great stories the movie finishes, not with a too neat dovetailing of all the story threads, but with a, somewhat, open end. I think it is part of our nature to want completion, to end a cycle neatly, to have a dissonance turn into a final consonant chord. Life doesn't always afford such neat solutions so we invent fiction. But it is precisely that which makes the story linger in our minds. We hunger for resolution. It haunts us. It haunts me. I've watched the film several times now and come to the same teary film conclusion, and my mind begins it's own invention. I pick up the loose threads and continue on my own.This film has become a favourite of mine into which I occasionally dip from time to time.
