To add to AGPym's formatting issue, Shanachie has also issued 7 episodes and labeled the dvd as season 1. According to the PBS web site I printed out with the Bramwell retrospective, listing all seasons and episodes, this dvd combines seasons 1 and 2 (which originally totalled 8 episodes)and leaves off the final episode of season 2. This missing episode involves a subway (underground) train crash which I did originally see when the series was new.

Somewhere along the line the first season was lost, so I re-ordered it. Unfortunately, it came in shreds. All the credits for each episode were cut out and it was impossible to watch in order.

One I picked up a year or so ago, that we finally got around to viewing, is Bramwell, Series 1.Bramwell is the story of Eleanor Bramwell, one of the first (though fictional) female Doctors in Victorian England. Bramwell follows Eleanor's trials, tribulations and surprisingly ""realistically grusome"" medical cases, as well as her acceptance or nonacceptance in the ""man's world"" of Victorian era Medicine. The costuming and sets are accurate and to die for. Eleanor's  ""Gibson Girl"" leg o mutton blouses and frocks are drool-worthy :)The show stars the beautiful Jemma Redgrave (yes, THAT Redgrave family-she is the daughter of Corin Redgrave and niece of Vanessa/Lynn Redgrave) and the incomparable Ruth Sheen who is one of the best Veteran UK Character actors around as Nurse Carr.The show ran 4 seasons and I eagerly look forward to renting and viewing seasons 2-4 :) Recommended-5 stars.PS-seeing the other reviews here-yes, my edition did not have the eighth episode on it. I agree with the other reviewers-I'm highly disappointed in the company who manufactured the DVD (they'd get zero stars) the five stars is for the show itself.",5,fantastic Victorian era drama...,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,1287,"['love', 'search', 'Period', 'Piece', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'will', 'invariably', 'find', 'many', 'great', 'ones', 'especially', 'UK', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'One', 'picked', 'up', 'year', 'so', 'ago', 'finally', 'got', 'viewing', 'Bramwell', 'Series', '1.Bramwell', 'story', 'Eleanor', 'Bramwell', 'one', 'first', 'fictional', 'female', 'Doctors', 'Victorian', 'England', 'Bramwell', 'Eleanor', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'surprisingly', 'realistically', 'grusome', 'medical', 'cases', 'as', 'well', 'acceptance', 'nonacceptance', 'man', 'world', 'Victorian', 'era', 'Medicine', 'costuming', 'sets', 'are', 'accurate', 'die', 'Eleanor', 'Gibson', 'Girl', 'leg', 'mutton', 'blouses', 'frocks', 'are', 'drool-worthy', 'show', 'beautiful', 'Jemma', 'Redgrave', 'yes', 'Redgrave', 'family-she', 'daughter', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'niece', 'Vanessa/Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'incomparable', 'Ruth', 'Sheen', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'Veteran', 'UK', 'Character', 'actors', 'Nurse', 'Carr.The', 'show', 'ran', '4', 'seasons', 'eagerly', 'look', 'forward', 'renting', 'viewing', 'seasons', '2-4', 'Recommended-5', 'stars.PS-seeing', 'other', 'reviews', 'here-yes', 'edition', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'eighth', 'episode', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers-I', ""'m"", 'highly', 'disappointed', 'company', 'who', 'manufactured', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'get', 'zero', 'stars', 'five', 'stars', 'show']",Bramwell - The Complete First Season
