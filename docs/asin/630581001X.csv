Even though it's about a small hockey team in a small fictional town of Alaska (called Mystery) that badly wants the opportunity to play the New York Rangers, for some reason, there's lots of comedy bits that involve punching people in the face, and sexual themes with SEVERE cuss words that make the movie entirely inappropriate for children.  So this is NOT recommended for fans of the Mighty Ducks.You also have a chilly Little Richard making an appearance, an old woman who complains a lot, cheating housewives, Russell Crowe playing with his hair (what a weird guy) and then serious stuff like the hockey team training on the ice and facing the Rangers.  The movie wants you to get into the small town and absorb the feel of the people and the way they go about their lives, but it never really works because the story is supposed to be about ice hockey.

Many movies try to dazzle you with an all star cast and huge special effects budget,  but in the end only disappoint you because at the core of the film  there's  no actual story. &quot;Mystery Alaska&quot; is the story of a quirky little  town that revolves around the Saturday hockey game played on the local  pond.  Being a member of the team is a prestigious and revered position in  Mystery. There is no pay or  world wide fame gained from being in the  Saturday game, but the men  play because their fathers played, and their  fathers played. It's funny to watch the men obsess over the their spot on  the team, because only a select few hold those spots. When one of the men  is replaced by the young up and comer in town, it's almost as though  someone has died. &quot;Mystery Alaska&quot; does boast a great cast,  including: Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Colm Meany (Con Air) &amp; Burt  Reynolds.

According to this film, Alaska has the following:cold, hockey, freezing snow, adultery, bitter cold, underage sex (maybe because of the cold), and hockey.And that's just about it.Now if you're not familiar with M. Jay Roach, he's the director of theAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery/The Spy Who Shagged Me/Goldmemberfilms, so I was expecting this movie to be funnier. There are some reallly funny moments, but it made me appreciate how much the humor of Austin Powers should be attributed to Mike Myers. The director is just there to help manage things. Mystery, Alaska tries to be funny, and it manages sometimes, but it's really an ensemble romantic film tied around a Rocky story.It's no Rocky, though. That movie had real gravitas. This one has Burt Reynolds, who should, like the Rolling Stones (No Stone Unturned + 7 Bonus Tracks), quit. He's absolutely the worst part in this movie. He made me want to relive my junior high days. They were more fun than watching him. Russel Crowe is great, of course, but his acting is beside the point. He's only one small part of this larger town, and the movie doesn't focus on him, not like it should in order to be labeled a good movie.The fact is, though--I guess I should admit it--I enjoyed Mystery, Alaska. It was a feel good movie about how it's okay to live in a small town. The people in small towns are just as good as the jerks from the big cities who look down on them and call them ""hicks"" or even ""lumberjacks"" in this case. Being from a small town in South Carolina, I sympathized with that point. It made me feel warm inside.And the characters are likeable, too. I found myself caring about them. I wanted them to make good. I wanted their lives to be enjoyable. I wanted them to win their big hockey game.But these things do not a good movie make.

That is until they are made a huge offer, one that they can't refuse.

Former team player and local Sheriff John Biebe (Russell Crowe) is assigned to play coach but he doesn't want it and feels that Judge Burns (Burt Reynolds) would be the best choice...but he doesn't want it either.  In the meantime, Charles is making the moves on Biebe's wife Donna (Mary McCormick) his ex-flame and that alone tests the grounds and fabric of the whole operation, for if the coach gives up, well then there goes the team.

Of all the hockey initiated films that I have seen, Mystery, Alaska is the most accurate.  The lives of the hockey players in the movie are just like my true life and my life is sad.  At about the age of 14, hockey becomes very vicious, brutal and intimidating.  A lot of my teammates were dirty goons who only played the sport for it's open violence and, off the ice were sex obsessed.  This is just how the movie is portrayed and that's just what hockey is like.  It isn't a topic that should have been made into a movie unless it was proving a point. It doesn't tell in any way, tell that the greatness at all levels of hockey is diminishing, but it is.  Soon enough, it won't even be a sport anymore. This movie just repeats the sad truth.  It is damned sad that most players either don't care about anything but hockey, or don't give enough respect to the sport. Mystery, Alaska reinstates this and by making this movie, they worsened the chance of hockey shaping up.  As for the plot, the pond game was boring and having the heroes lose didn't give it any kind of original cleverness or genius ending.

479365,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,630581001X,Deborah Earle,"[3, 4]","The glistening white world of "" Mystery, Alaska"" presents us with a tale of a hockey town its quirky characters, and the opportunity of their local team to play the New York Rangers, presented to them by Hank Azaria's cocky sports reporter, Charles Danner, a former resident of Mystery.Amid this pure, alabaster-looking world is a community dominated by the members of its hockey team. It's not an easy town for women to live in, and many a local lass, including the Mayor's wife, has compromised or almost compromised her virtue with the town heroes, who are full of crass fraternity hijinks and like many townsfolk, equally crass language.Burt Reynolds gives a great performance as Judge Walter Burns, the town mentor, who taught numerous kids to skate, and who tries to keep his teenaged daughter, played by Rachel Wilson, away from the lecherous hockey players whereas Judith Ivey's Mrs. Burns seems slightly more passive about the situation, although she confronts her daughter about it at one point. Scott Grimes plays Reynolds' son who feels his future lies in hockey rather than academics.Colm Meany hides his Irish accent well as the Mayor who is betrayed by his wife, played by Lolita Davidovitch when she sleeps with the notorious Skank Marden(Ron Eldard). The depths of betrayal don't seem to affect the couple as much as they might in real life once they come to terms with it.Russell Crowe's mastery of the subtle, smoldering glance is not lost in his portrayal of the town Sherriff and hockey team Captain, John Biebe. Tossing his moreno-colored, chestnut- streaked mane of hair, squaring shoulders as mountainous as the Canadian scenery(which doubled for Alaska), and speaking with an accent that sounds slightly Nova Scotian, he is one of the more dignified characters in the film with one of the most solid marriages. Azaria's return to town threatens him because his wife, Donna, is Azaria's former girlfriend. Mary McCormack gives a warm-hearted, sympathetic portrayal of Donna Biebe, eventually reassuring her husband that she has no regrets about marrying him. Their reconciliation after a heated argument is poignant, coltish, and downright sexy without revealing too much flesh.Maury Chaykin's Bailey Pruitt is the lawyer who gives his life trying to secure the hockey match when it is nearly cancelled. Michael McKean plays the wounded Price World Representative who shows us how not to behave when accidentally shot by a hockey player in a hockey town, if we want a jury to decide in our favor. Kevin Durand's Tree is the stereotypical dim-witted but kind-hearted jock. Comical moments include Megan Price's Sarah Heinz putting the disreputable Skank in his place, and Crowe's unsuccessful attempt to suppress his laughter when dealing with the case.There are fun cameos by Little Richard and Mike Myers during the game. Perhaps the best moments of the game are when Crowe's tender family man pauses to signal ""I love yous"" to his wife and sons while on the ice, and flash that brilliant smile to the audience.The outcome of the match is unsatisfyingly realistic. But when Sheriff Biebe places a puck on the grave of the man who fought to prevent the game's cancellation, a bit of foliage before the cross, pushing its way up through the relentless snow, somehow symbolises the determination of the Mystery team in the face of great odds. --A great metaphor for the citizens of Mystery within itself.",4,"Raunchy, Quirky, Comical, Poignant, Truthful",1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,3426,"['glistening', 'white', 'world', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'tale', 'hockey', 'town', 'quirky', 'characters', 'opportunity', 'local', 'team', 'play', 'New', 'York', 'Rangers', 'presented', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'cocky', 'sports', 'reporter', 'Charles', 'Danner', 'former', 'resident', 'Mystery.Amid', 'pure', 'alabaster-looking', 'world', 'community', 'dominated', 'members', 'hockey', 'team', 'not', 'easy', 'town', 'women', 'live', 'many', 'local', 'lass', 'including', 'Mayor', 'wife', 'compromised', 'almost', 'compromised', 'virtue', 'town', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', 'full', 'crass', 'fraternity', 'hijinks', 'many', 'townsfolk', 'equally', 'crass', 'language.Burt', 'Reynolds', 'great', 'performance', 'Judge', 'Walter', 'Burns', 'town', 'mentor', 'who', 'taught', 'numerous', 'kids', 'skate', 'who', 'keep', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Wilson', 'away', 'lecherous', 'hockey', 'players', 'whereas', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'Mrs.', 'Burns', 'slightly', 'more', 'passive', 'situation', 'daughter', 'one', 'point', 'Scott', 'Grimes', 'Reynolds', 'son', 'who', 'future', 'hockey', 'rather', 'academics.Colm', 'Meany', 'hides', 'Irish', 'accent', 'well', 'Mayor', 'who', 'betrayed', 'wife', 'played', 'Lolita', 'Davidovitch', 'when', 'notorious', 'Skank', 'Marden', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'depths', 'betrayal', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'affect', 'couple', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'real', 'life', 'come', 'terms', 'it.Russell', 'Crowe', 'mastery', 'subtle', 'smoldering', 'glance', 'not', 'lost', 'portrayal', 'town', 'Sherriff', 'hockey', 'team', 'Captain', 'John', 'Biebe', 'Tossing', 'moreno-colored', 'chestnut-', 'streaked', 'mane', 'hair', 'squaring', 'shoulders', 'as', 'mountainous', 'Canadian', 'scenery', 'doubled', 'Alaska', 'speaking', 'accent', 'slightly', 'Nova', 'Scotian', 'one', 'more', 'dignified', 'characters', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'marriages', 'Azaria', 'return', 'town', 'threatens', 'wife', 'Donna', 'Azaria', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'warm-hearted', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'Donna', 'Biebe', 'eventually', 'reassuring', 'husband', 'regrets', 'marrying', 'reconciliation', 'heated', 'argument', 'poignant', 'coltish', 'downright', 'sexy', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'flesh.Maury', 'Chaykin', 'Bailey', 'Pruitt', 'lawyer', 'who', 'life', 'trying', 'secure', 'hockey', 'match', 'when', 'nearly', 'cancelled', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'wounded', 'Price', 'World', 'Representative', 'who', 'how', 'not', 'behave', 'when', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'hockey', 'player', 'hockey', 'town', 'want', 'jury', 'decide', 'favor', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Tree', 'stereotypical', 'dim-witted', 'kind-hearted', 'jock', 'Comical', 'moments', 'include', 'Megan', 'Price', 'Sarah', 'Heinz', 'putting', 'disreputable', 'Skank', 'place', 'Crowe', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'suppress', 'laughter', 'when', 'dealing', 'case.There', 'are', 'fun', 'cameos', 'Little', 'Richard', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'game', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'moments', 'game', 'are', 'when', 'Crowe', 'tender', 'family', 'man', 'signal', 'love', 'yous', 'wife', 'sons', 'ice', 'flash', 'brilliant', 'smile', 'audience.The', 'outcome', 'match', 'unsatisfyingly', 'realistic', 'when', 'Sheriff', 'Biebe', 'puck', 'grave', 'man', 'who', 'fought', 'prevent', 'game', 'cancellation', 'bit', 'foliage', 'cross', 'pushing', 'way', 'relentless', 'snow', 'somehow', 'determination', 'Mystery', 'team', 'face', 'great', 'odds', 'great', 'metaphor', 'citizens', 'Mystery']",Mystery Alaska VHS

479367,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,630581001X,Duane Thomas,"[8, 9]","If you're interested in this movie, it's probably because it stars Russell Crowe. But if you thought that was the only reason to see this film, have I got some good news for you.Mystery, Alaska, population 633, is a town obsessed with hockey. From the time they're children, every Mystery boy's dream is to be a member of the town's unnamed hockey team in the weekly ""Saturday game."" Through a sequence of events only slightly farfetched, the Mystery team is scheduled for an exhibitition game with the visiting New York Rangers, an event of only slightly less importance to this hockey-struck town than the Second Coming. One of the many great things about this movie is the town's reaction to news of the impending game. They're not awestruck by the Rangers, the visiting demi-gods; their first reaction is, ""Can we win?"" If Mystery plays, they intend to win. The Rangers might be big league American hockey, but Mystery has faith in its boys. It knows they're great even if the rest of the world doesn't.The movie is about how the town and its inhabitants are affected by the upcoming game. The game itself, though perfectly realized in the film, is almost incidental. Colm Meaney (late of Star Trek: The Next Generattion and Deep Space Nine) plays the town mayor who discovers his wife (Lolita Davidovich) is sleeping with a member of the hockey team. Hank Azaria is Charles Danner, the home town boy who was never respected growing up, became a reporter out in the great big world, brings back to Mystery the NEW YORK RANGERS....and finds he's still not respected. Donna Biebe (Mary McCormack) is the girl Charles loved in high school, now married to team captain and town sheriff John Biebe (Crowe). Burt Reynolds, who still has it, and in spades, after all these years, plays town judge Walter Burns. Walter as a young man wasn't good enough for the Saturday game, a fact he's never forgotten and a source of conflict with his son, who's made the current team. But Walter was good enough for minor league hockey in the lower 48, making him the perfect choice to coach the team for and through the big game. He's the only person in town who really understands North American hockey. For his own reasons, he refuses.Then there's Russell Crowe as John Biebe. The big game comes at the tail end of John's career. After 13 years in the Saturday game - a Mystery record - he's cut from the team just before news of the Rangers' visit hits town. And the town fathers, whose most solemn duties involve administering the hockey team, don't want him back. A man of quiet strength but not good at expressing his softer emotions, John doesn't know how to tell his wife how much he loves her when he sees Charles flirting, and her flirting back. The way he figures out finally to do that is both inventive and touching.Though this movie ""stars"" Russell Crowe, it's not a star driven vehicle, it's an ensemble piece. And while Russell is wonderful as John Biebe, for my money the best performance in the film is Ron Eldard as ""Skank"" Marden, Mystery hockey player and dedicated fornicator. The scene where Skank appears on the mayor's doorstep one frozen night to apologize to the man he's cuckolded is, I think, the highlight of the film. It's fascinating to watch the unexpected decency, sensitivity, and dignity emerge from what til then seemed an indecent, shallow, undignified man.The hockey game footage is convincing - thrilling, actually. Russell learned to ice skate for this role, and, with the help of some careful editing, looks pretty darn good on the ice. Numerous Rangers play themselves.Mystery, Alaska has been called ""Rocky On Ice"" and that's a fair description. Yes, the film deals with a hockey game, but that's not what makes it special. This isn't a dumb, gimmicky, braindead hockey flick like The Mighty Ducks. It's a character driven, imaginative, well-acted drama....that happens to work within the framework of a story about a hockey game. By the time the Rangers arrive in Mystery you're totally on the home team's side, rooting for them because you've come to care for the Mystery boys, and respect the sacrifices they, and the town as a whole, have made for this game. Like Rocky, Mystery, Alaska shows you don't need a huge budget to make a good movie when you have a great script, solid direction, good actors, and the film possesses that quality indefinable but impossible to mistake or ignore: ""heart.""So, can a team of pond hockey players from Mystery, Alaska REALLY beat the New York Rangers?

Some of his preoccupations with sex and the courtroom are evident here. And his sense of quirky characters and situations abounds as well.This is by no means a bad movie, just don't expect anything out of the  ordinary. They set up the situations in the first 20 minutes or so, so the viewer can pretty much see where things are headed. The only real question is how they are going to deal with the big showdown between the New York Rangers and the locals. I did rather enjoy the outcome.The ensemble cast is good. The directing is adequate and Carter Burwell's music score is very good. He chose to write the pieces with a Native American tinge to them. It put a very nice touch on things. Though Russel Crowe is the headliner he does not get the screen time one might expect. Quite a few of the characters get heard throughout.My biggest disappointment was the big game itself.

Kelley, so it's no great surprise that I also loved &quot;Mystery, Alaska.&quot; Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Colm Meaney, Ron Eldard, and Kevin Durand all turn in convincing, heart-warming performances, and the setting (in Banff) is just spectacular.The story takes places in the fictional town of Mystery, deep in Alaska's mountains. It's incredibly cold there, and the town's favorite pasttime is hockey. The Mystery boys are undefeated on pond ice, and the Saturday game is a huge deal for the little burg. Hank Azaria's character had left Mystery to pursue a writing career, and made the town famous with an article in &quot;Sports Illustrated,&quot; which caught the eye of NHL bigwigs. The bigwigs signed the New York Rangers, one of the NHL's long-standing great teams, to come up and play an exhibition game against the Mystery team.The results of that decision are what drives this movie, and in the end, winning or losing the game itself isn't what's important. It's a story about communities, relationships, and the strong bonds between teammates. Don't let this fool you into thinking it's a chick flick, tho; it's a movie that men and women alike will enjoy. There are laugh-out-loud moments, and lot of big grin moments, and a few very heart-touching ones as well, but nothing overly-sappy.The DVD extra features are sadly lacking, though, the only one of interest being an exceedingly brief behind-the-scenes featurette, which has a few moments of interest, but generally doesn't have anything overwhelming to offer. I would have loved to have seen some outtakes of skating mishaps and cut-ups.

479374,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,630581001X,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","This is a likeable film using the hackneyed ""obscure underdog"" storyline.  David E. Kelley tries his hand at writing another feature film after the bizarre `Lake Placid'.  This is certainly better than that abomination, but  the plot presents us with nothing new or fresh and meanders around town  doing random character studies on unimportant characters.  Still, it's hard  not to like a film where a small town hockey club roughs up the New York  Rangers.The story revolves around the small town of Mystery, Alaska  where the only thing to do or talk about is hockey.  John Biebe (Russell  Crowe) is the sheriff and a veteran of the Saturday hockey game, which is  the focal point of Mystery's culture.  As a result of an article written in  Sports Illustrated, the NHL and the NY Rangers think it would be a good  promotional gimmick for the Rangers to play this scrappy bunch of amateurs.  So now the town is in a tizzy over this defining moment in their  history.Kelley's script expands this film to be much longer than it  should have been.  He spends far too much time following the gossip of  who's sleeping with whom among ancillary characters, and not enough time in  character development of the players other than Biebe.  Director Jay Roach  does a good job, however of keeping the viewer engaged through the use of  excellent hockey action shots that take you right onto the ice.  Also, how  can you not love the majestic mountain backdrops in just about every  outdoor scene.Once the film at long last gets to the game, it succeeds  at accomplishing what the formula intends, that is, it gets us to pull hard  for the underdog.For Russell Crowe, this was much less intense than his  roles in `The Insider' and `Gladiator'.  He did a nice job of portraying  the old warhorse, giving the character steadiness, dignity and  determination.  I wonder where a guy from Australia learned to ice skate so  well.  Colm Meaney gave a good performance as the mayor but Burt Reynolds  was a little stiff as the judge (maybe it's rigor mortis).Though there  is a lot to criticize about this film, it is still entertaining and for  those who love hockey, it does a good job of providing some up-close action  footage of the game.

He is not particularly talented and makes the same faces in every film, and it drives me CRAZY! In this case, we have what could have been an okay movie, but Russell Crowe poisoned the whole thing with his very presence.""Mystery, Alaska"" has the potential to be a decent movie. It's about the small Alaskan town of Mystery, a place where everybody knows everyone else and each resident is obsessed with the game of hockey.

The people of Mystery must learn to put aside their various differences and pull together in preparation for the event of a lifetime.This film is sentimental and can basically be summed up in one cliche: ""It's not about whether you win or lose; it's how you play the game."" There are several strong performances in this movie, including Hank Azaria as Mystery's prodigal son and Burt Reynolds as the town judge/coach. However, Russell Crowe spoiled the whole film for me. He plays the town sheriff/hockey player/coach, and he's basically just a big cocky oaf on ice. There's this one scene where Crowe's character is supposed to have a ""touching"" moment with his wife. He crosses out a bunch of words in a newspaper column and instructs his wife to read the remaining characters out loud. I think the intention of the scene was for Crowe's character to come across as being all sentimental and deep, but it was just incredibly stupid and serves as a perfect example of how every movie Crowe is in basically turns to garbage.If ANYONE but Russell Crowe had been cast in the role of John, ""Mystery, Alaska"" might be worth watching.

479402,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,630581001X,Michael Butts,"[5, 5]","What makes MYSTERY ALASKA such a joyful movie experience is its heart, and the remarkably good cast.  In the vein of such films as ROCKY, the story of the Mystery Alaska team facing the New York Rangers is merely a means to the end.  What this movie is really about is pride, loyalty and the sense of courage to go against seemingly unreachable odds and come out with your pride and honor intact.  This is not a ""Russell Crowe"" movie, although the Oscar winner is superb as John Biebe.  This is a group effort and the cast has some shining moments:  Ron Eldard (The Runner) plays Skank, the team's sexually active member, who is screwing the mayor's wife (Lolita Davidovich).  In a memorable scene, Eldard confronts the Mayor (Colm Meany) and apologizes to him, with a sense of sincerity you hadn't seen before.  One expects Meany to throw a punch or yell and scream; watch to find out how it plays out.  Lolita Davidovich and Meany also have a tense but touching moment when she tells him why she slept with Eldard; Crowe and Mary McCormack as his wife share several touching scenes that show how deep a love can go; Burt Reynolds as the gruff judge/coach has a shining moment when he addresses the townspeople in a trial of a player who shot a visiting department store magnate in the foot; Maury Chaykin as Bailey Pruitt has key scenes and a very poignant one in the courtroom; Judith Ivey as Reynolds's wife has a wonderful moment when she's discussing sex with her teenage daughter (Rachel Wilson).  The movie is full of nice scenes, and refreshing changes of pace thanks to the screenplay by David E. Kelley (Picket Fences).

479414,A1J2931UBBJPXM,630581001X,Reviewer,"[5, 6]","It's cold in the small hamlet of Mystery, Alaska, but there's plenty of warmth in ""Mystery, Alaska,"" the film, directed by Jay Roach, about the  town and the sport that is ingrained in the collective consciousness of the  community.  Hockey is the game, and when a former resident, now a  journalist, writes a story about Mystery's home-town team and their  ""Saturday Game,"" and it ends up as a three page spread complete with  pictures in Sports Illustrated, it has far reaching effects on the populace  of this small dot on the map.  Soon the town is turned upside down,  embroiled in an event, the proportions of which, to them, are huge.  Needless to say, it involves hockey and an encounter with a high-profile  professional team.  Yes, there is a lot of hockey in this movie, but be  advised, this film is not ""about"" hockey; this is a movie about people-  real people- and what makes them tick.  Roach has crafted a  thoroughly entertaining and emotional story of want and need, dignity and  desire, obsession and love, and he's captured it all through the winning  performances of a stellar ensemble cast, the most prominent of which is  Russell Crowe.  The charismatic Crowe, finally on his way to superstardom  thanks to his turn in ""Gladiator"" plays John Biebe, Mystery's sheriff and  captain of the hockey team.  His rugged good looks and persona fit the  character perfectly, and he puts all of his myriad personal resources to  work to put it across, and that he does.  Also notable is the personable  Mary McCormack as John's wife, Donna, who does a great job of fleshing out  the character of this woman who made what she deems to be the right choices  in her life, without regrets or apologies to herself or anyone else.  It's  a refreshing portrayal, and the chemistry between her and Crowe is  unmistakable.  Also adding to the overall texture of this film are Hank  Azaria, as Charles Danner, the journalist who gets the whole thing rolling;  Burt Reynolds, as Judge Walter Burns, a man forced to deal with his own  personal issues, which include a son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), a member of  the hockey team; Colm Meany, as Scott Pitcher, Mayor of Mystery, and Lolita  Davidovich as his wife, Mary Jane; Maury Chaykin, as Bailey Pruitt, the man  who seems to personify the very essence of Mystery's spirit; and Ron Eldard  as ""Skank,"" another member of the team who's good for two things-suffice to  say that hockey is one of them.  Mercifully, ""Mystery, Alaska"" never  pursues the beat-the-dead-horse cliched mentality that sports ""teaches one  to be a team player and builds character.""  Instead, Roach has given us a  worthwhile, memorable movie with a human touch, and because of that, in the  end these are people you care about, as individuals as well as a community.  The climactic game is exciting and far from predictable, beginning with  the celebrity they bring in to sing the National Anthem.  This may not be  one of Russell Crowe's biggest or highest profile movies, but this is one  he's going to be able to look back upon with pride, because it's right up  there with his best.  Remember, you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy  this movie; all that's required is that you have a membership in the club  know as Mankind.",5,"There's Warmth In &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot;",966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,3258,"['cold', 'small', 'hamlet', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'plenty', 'warmth', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'film', 'directed', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'town', 'sport', 'ingrained', 'collective', 'consciousness', 'community', 'Hockey', 'game', 'when', 'former', 'resident', 'now', 'journalist', 'story', 'Mystery', 'home-town', 'team', 'Saturday', 'Game', 'up', 'three', 'page', 'spread', 'complete', 'pictures', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'far', 'reaching', 'effects', 'populace', 'small', 'dot', 'map', 'town', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'embroiled', 'event', 'proportions', 'are', 'huge', 'Needless', 'say', 'hockey', 'encounter', 'high-profile', 'professional', 'team', 'Yes', 'lot', 'hockey', 'movie', 'be', 'advised', 'film', 'not', 'hockey', 'movie', 'people-', 'real', 'people-', 'what', 'tick', 'Roach', 'crafted', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'emotional', 'story', 'want', 'need', 'dignity', 'desire', 'obsession', 'love', 'captured', 'winning', 'performances', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'most', 'prominent', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'charismatic', 'Crowe', 'finally', 'way', 'superstardom', 'thanks', 'turn', 'Gladiator', 'John', 'Biebe', 'Mystery', 'sheriff', 'captain', 'hockey', 'team', 'rugged', 'good', 'looks', 'persona', 'fit', 'character', 'perfectly', 'myriad', 'personal', 'resources', 'work', 'put', 'Also', 'notable', 'personable', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'John', 'wife', 'Donna', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'what', 'be', 'right', 'choices', 'life', 'regrets', 'apologies', 'herself', 'anyone', 'else', 'refreshing', 'portrayal', 'chemistry', 'Crowe', 'unmistakable', 'Also', 'adding', 'overall', 'texture', 'film', 'are', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Charles', 'Danner', 'journalist', 'who', 'whole', 'thing', 'rolling', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Judge', 'Walter', 'Burns', 'man', 'forced', 'deal', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'include', 'son', 'Birdie', 'Scott', 'Grimes', 'member', 'hockey', 'team', 'Colm', 'Meany', 'Scott', 'Pitcher', 'Mayor', 'Mystery', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Maury', 'Chaykin', 'Bailey', 'Pruitt', 'man', 'who', 'personify', 'very', 'essence', 'Mystery', 'spirit', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Skank', 'member', 'team', 'who', 'good', 'two', 'things-suffice', 'say', 'hockey', 'one', 'Mercifully', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'never', 'beat-the-dead-horse', 'cliched', 'mentality', 'sports', 'teaches', 'one', 'be', 'team', 'player', 'builds', 'character', 'Instead', 'Roach', 'given', 'worthwhile', 'memorable', 'movie', 'human', 'touch', 'end', 'are', 'people', 'care', 'about', 'individuals', 'as', 'well', 'community', 'climactic', 'game', 'exciting', 'far', 'predictable', 'beginning', 'celebrity', 'bring', 'sing', 'National', 'Anthem', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'biggest', 'highest', 'profile', 'movies', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'back', 'pride', 'right', 'there', 'best', 'Remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'sports', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'required', 'have', 'membership', 'club', 'know', 'Mankind']",Mystery Alaska VHS

I was very pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying Mystery, Alaska; it's actually  a very well-edited, well-written film which overcomes its cliches through  good acting and an unusual plotline.Anyone who has lived in a small  town and experienced small town sports will immediately find a soft spot  for this movie.  Much like the boys in Hoosiers, the heroes of Mystery,  Alaska are the over-achieving yet mysteriously talented local boys who play  an entirely different brand of hockey than the glitzy millionaires from New  York. Yet the millionaires don't get villified; the movie isn't about them  at all. This is a movie about community more than sports.One of the  most effective elements of the film is the opening credits. The stunning  visual imagery of a young man skating a frozen river in the middle of  nowhere is just plain cool, in my humble opinion!Mystery, Alaska is a  movie about friendship and support in adversity, and how you can always  forgive one of your own when they set off for &quot;bigger and better  things.&quot;  I would highly recommend Mystery, Alaska for anyone who  sometimes just wants to go home again.",4,Small town sports at its best,957830400,"05 9, 2000",2000,1282,"['figured', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'movie', 'something', 'see', 'wife', 'Saturday', 'night', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'enjoying', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'actually', 'very', 'well-edited', 'well-written', 'film', 'cliches', 'good', 'acting', 'unusual', 'plotline.Anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'small', 'town', 'experienced', 'small', 'town', 'sports', 'will', 'immediately', 'find', 'soft', 'spot', 'movie', 'Much', 'boys', 'Hoosiers', 'heroes', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'are', 'over-achieving', 'yet', 'mysteriously', 'talented', 'local', 'boys', 'who', 'play', 'entirely', 'different', 'brand', 'hockey', 'glitzy', 'millionaires', 'New', 'York', 'millionaires', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'villified', 'movie', ""n't"", 'movie', 'community', 'more', 'sports.One', 'most', 'effective', 'elements', 'film', 'opening', 'credits', 'stunning', 'visual', 'imagery', 'young', 'man', 'skating', 'frozen', 'river', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'just', 'plain', 'cool', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'movie', 'friendship', 'support', 'adversity', 'how', 'can', 'always', 'forgive', 'one', 'own', 'when', 'set', 'off', 'quot', 'bigger', 'better', 'things.', 'quot', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'anyone', 'who', 'sometimes', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'again']",Mystery Alaska VHS
479424,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,630581001X,Scott Schiefelbein,"[5, 5]","""Mystery, Alaska"" juggles quite a few cliches, but it does so with wonderful charm and a constant nudge in the ribs.A small town in the frozen North of Alaska, Mystery loves its hockey beyond all reason.  The famed ""Saturday Game,"" played each week with religious fervor, has been brought to the pages of Sports Illustrated by a Mysterian (Hank Azaria) who has left the town for bigger and better things -- although it may be because everyone in town says he plays hockey ""like a homosexual"" (this is an example of the surprisingly frank and profane language Mysterians like to use, which can be jarring in what is otherwise a sweet movie).The team, led by John Biebe (Russell Crowe in a nice understated performance), is your typical bunch of loveable small-town lugs, each given either one defining characteristic (babe hound, son struggling with sense of inadequacy, hot young prodigy nervous about playing with the ""big boys,"" etc.) or is mere entertaining window dressing.  Otherwise content with the local fame brought by playing in the Saturday game, the guys are exhilirated and terrified to learn that the NHL wants the New York Rangers (at the time, a good team!) to visit Mystery to play the locals as a publicity stunt.Biebe, who is also the town sheriff, is our lens into this quirky town going through this tumultuous development.  A fixture of the Saturday Game for years, he is surprisingly demoted and asked to coach.  One of his best players 'accidentally' shoots a representative from Price World, a Wal-Mart clone.  Another player cuckolds the mayor of the town.  And Azaria returns to make overtures to Biebe's wife.  The tranquil little burg has never seen such excitement.All of this unfolds in a lighthearted manner and builds to the ""big game"" against the Rangers -- which is only brought about by the untimely demise of a lovable local resident.The game is handled very well, with the proper ""underdog"" notes played, but not overly so.  The hockey action flows quickly, and feels like a game rather than someone filming a pretend game (a common problem in sports movies -- the action is not realistic enough).  One problem - we rarely see Russell Crowe actually skate, which undercuts his status as the team leader and reminds us that he's a Hollywood star in a hockey film.Perhaps the movie's most inspired moment is the mayor's unique way of invoking Mystery's home-ice advantage during the national anthem (with a hilarious cameo by Little Richard - yes, you heard me).  Watch also for a great cameo by Mike Meyers, who has worked with director Jay Roach on the Austin Powers films.In the end, all loose ends are tied up nicely . . . and perhaps too conveniently for some.  Nothing in the movie is a great shock, but that's life in a small town for you.While in many respects a good family movie, the language and humor is definitely not for younger viewers.  And the ""romantic"" overtures of Skank, the team horn-dog, can be quite shocking to some.  Still, a good movie and a fun time.",4,Slapshot Meets Bad News Bears Meets Our Town Meets Fargo,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,3014,"['Mystery', 'Alaska', 'quite', 'few', 'cliches', 'so', 'wonderful', 'charm', 'constant', 'nudge', 'ribs.A', 'small', 'town', 'frozen', 'North', 'Alaska', 'Mystery', 'hockey', 'reason', 'famed', 'Saturday', 'Game', 'played', 'week', 'religious', 'fervor', 'been', 'brought', 'pages', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'Mysterian', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'who', 'left', 'town', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'everyone', 'town', 'hockey', 'homosexual', 'example', 'surprisingly', 'frank', 'profane', 'language', 'Mysterians', 'use', 'can', 'be', 'jarring', 'what', 'otherwise', 'sweet', 'movie', '.The', 'team', 'led', 'John', 'Biebe', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'nice', 'understated', 'performance', 'typical', 'bunch', 'loveable', 'small-town', 'lugs', 'given', 'one', 'defining', 'characteristic', 'babe', 'hound', 'son', 'struggling', 'sense', 'inadequacy', 'hot', 'young', 'prodigy', 'nervous', 'playing', 'big', 'boys', 'etc', 'mere', 'entertaining', 'window', 'dressing', 'content', 'local', 'fame', 'brought', 'playing', 'Saturday', 'game', 'guys', 'are', 'exhilirated', 'terrified', 'learn', 'NHL', 'New', 'York', 'Rangers', 'time', 'good', 'team', 'visit', 'Mystery', 'play', 'locals', 'publicity', 'stunt.Biebe', 'who', 'also', 'town', 'sheriff', 'lens', 'quirky', 'town', 'going', 'tumultuous', 'development', 'fixture', 'Saturday', 'Game', 'years', 'surprisingly', 'demoted', 'asked', 'coach', 'One', 'best', 'players', ""'accidentally"", 'shoots', 'representative', 'Price', 'World', 'Wal-Mart', 'clone', 'player', 'mayor', 'town', 'Azaria', 'returns', 'make', 'overtures', 'Biebe', 'wife', 'tranquil', 'little', 'burg', 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'excitement.All', 'unfolds', 'lighthearted', 'manner', 'builds', 'big', 'game', 'Rangers', 'only', 'brought', 'about', 'untimely', 'demise', 'lovable', 'local', 'resident.The', 'game', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'proper', 'underdog', 'notes', 'played', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'hockey', 'action', 'quickly', 'feels', 'game', 'rather', 'someone', 'filming', 'pretend', 'game', 'common', 'problem', 'sports', 'movies', 'action', 'not', 'realistic', 'enough', 'One', 'problem', 'rarely', 'see', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'actually', 'skate', 'status', 'team', 'leader', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'hockey', 'movie', 'most', 'inspired', 'moment', 'mayor', 'unique', 'way', 'invoking', 'Mystery', 'home-ice', 'advantage', 'national', 'anthem', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Little', 'Richard', 'yes', 'heard', 'Watch', 'also', 'great', 'cameo', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'who', 'worked', 'director', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'films.In', 'end', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'nicely', 'perhaps', 'too', 'conveniently', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'great', 'shock', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'you.While', 'many', 'respects', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'language', 'humor', 'definitely', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers', 'romantic', 'overtures', 'Skank', 'team', 'horn-dog', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'shocking', 'Still', 'good', 'movie', 'fun', 'time']",Mystery Alaska VHS

But that won't stop your enjoyment of it.  David Kelley's ability to capture the essence of a place through  interesting characters has long been demonstrated on television, and he's  in good form, here.  Mind you, his characters here are somewhat ordinary by  PICKET FENCES or ALLY MCBEAL standards, but they're still more  attention-grabbing than characters usually offered up in sports movies.Indeed, if the film has a real fault it's that Kelley has so enjoyed his  own visit to Mystery that he's written about almost too many characters.  The film would probably have been helped by a little judicious editing, or  by more closely linking the subplots, but the meander is far from  unpleasant.This is no doubt because these many characters are played by  fine actors.  The cast is fairly loaded with talent, and all of them get  at least a few memorable lines.  By far most impressive is Burt Reynolds,  whose acting continues to improve even after decades in the business.  He's clearly gone to some effort, here, creating a precise vision for his  character that goes so far as to include an especially subtle Alaskan  accent.Parents should be warned, however, that amidst what is  otherwise a family film are some fairly long stretches of adult language  that, while character-appropriate, may be objectionable to some. This  should be a minor concern to most parents, however, as the ultimate message  of the movie is entirely praiseworthy and could spark useful and  instructive family discussions.(DVD notes: This is an unfortunately  sparse DVD with nothing of particular value to film students.  There are no  audio commentaries, and the &quot;making-of&quot; featurette is woefully  short and does more to rehash the plot than to discuss how the film was  made.)",4,Characters curse and bless this non-mystery of a plot,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,1889,"['wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'lot', 'MYSTERY', 'ALASKA', 'new', 'kind', 'sports', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoyment', 'David', 'Kelley', 'ability', 'capture', 'essence', 'place', 'interesting', 'characters', 'long', 'been', 'demonstrated', 'television', 'good', 'form', 'here', 'Mind', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'somewhat', 'ordinary', 'PICKET', 'FENCES', 'ALLY', 'MCBEAL', 'standards', ""'re"", 'still', 'more', 'attention-grabbing', 'characters', 'usually', 'offered', 'up', 'sports', 'movies.Indeed', 'film', 'real', 'fault', 'Kelley', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'visit', 'Mystery', 'written', 'almost', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'helped', 'little', 'judicious', 'editing', 'more', 'closely', 'linking', 'subplots', 'meander', 'far', 'unpleasant.This', 'doubt', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'fine', 'actors', 'cast', 'fairly', 'loaded', 'talent', 'get', 'least', 'few', 'memorable', 'lines', 'far', 'most', 'impressive', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'acting', 'improve', 'even', 'decades', 'business', 'clearly', 'gone', 'effort', 'here', 'creating', 'precise', 'vision', 'character', 'so', 'far', 'include', 'especially', 'subtle', 'Alaskan', 'accent.Parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'however', 'amidst', 'what', 'otherwise', 'family', 'film', 'are', 'fairly', 'long', 'stretches', 'adult', 'language', 'character-appropriate', 'may', 'be', 'objectionable', 'should', 'be', 'minor', 'concern', 'most', 'parents', 'however', 'ultimate', 'message', 'movie', 'entirely', 'praiseworthy', 'could', 'spark', 'useful', 'instructive', 'family', 'discussions', 'DVD', 'notes', 'unfortunately', 'sparse', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'particular', 'value', 'film', 'students', 'are', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'quot', 'making-of', 'quot', 'featurette', 'woefully', 'short', 'more', 'rehash', 'plot', 'discuss', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made']",Mystery Alaska VHS
