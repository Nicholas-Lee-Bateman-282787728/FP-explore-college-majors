1532659,A30NVSLEMRKEW1,B007K7IC6K,"Eric ""OhioGuy""","[9, 10]","TARZAN fans can rejoice. This memorable series is at long last now available on DVD, and they've done an outstanding job with this release. The quality is awesome,with bold colors, and superior, crisp definition. It looks so good in fact, that it's hard to believe what you're viewing is over 45 years old. Ron Ely's take on the character always impressed me as a kid, and revisiting these episodes now as an adult did not dissapoint. Each episode is really like a short movie, with unusually high production values for the period, and excellent performances from a stable of fine actors in guest roles, most notably former movie-Tarzan Jock Mahoney.

He was bitten by a lion on the forehead and thigh on two different occasions.He singed his feet and legs running through fires, He ripped the skin off his feet sliding down a hill.While swinging on those vines they have broken at least three times falling 25 feet sustaining a separated shoulder,a broken shoulder, tons of cuts and bruises including both wrists and three ribs.Now thats really a trooper for and actor to really want to make the series believable.Ely is also famous for playing Doc Savage.For years the syndication prints have been horrible with really faded color prints, Update: Now that I have seen them they look remastered to me.You really can enjoy every episode like never before since they were made.The blues and greens are incredible and enhance the scenery.If you can't get one on amazon the WB archives sell it and part two as well to complete season one.",5,A uniqe series long over due!Ron Ely was a great Tarzan,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,1448,"['Tarzan', 'time', '1966-1968', 'was', 'great', 'action', 'series', 'neat', 'locations', 'sets', 'actors.Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'Don', 'Marshall', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Supremes', 'Helen', 'Hays', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'Nemiah', 'Persoff', 'Lloyd', 'Haynes', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Nancy', 'Malone', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'enliven', 'series', 'great', 'actors.Ron', 'Ely', 'was', 'excellent', 'shape', 'time', 'play', 'character', 'two', 'seasons.Ron', 'really', 'took', 'role', 'seriously', 'rarely', 'used', 'stunt', 'double.During', 'first', 'season', 'sustained', 'least', '17', 'separate', 'injuries', 'was', 'bitten', 'lion', 'forehead', 'thigh', 'two', 'different', 'occasions.He', 'singed', 'feet', 'legs', 'running', 'fires', 'ripped', 'skin', 'feet', 'sliding', 'down', 'hill.While', 'swinging', 'vines', 'have', 'broken', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'falling', '25', 'feet', 'sustaining', 'separated', 'shoulder', 'broken', 'shoulder', 'tons', 'cuts', 'bruises', 'including', 'wrists', 'three', 'ribs.Now', 'thats', 'really', 'trooper', 'actor', 'really', 'want', 'make', 'series', 'believable.Ely', 'also', 'famous', 'playing', 'Doc', 'Savage.For', 'years', 'syndication', 'prints', 'have', 'been', 'horrible', 'really', 'faded', 'color', 'prints', 'Update', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'look', 'remastered', 'me.You', 'really', 'can', 'enjoy', 'episode', 'never', 'were', 'made.The', 'blues', 'greens', 'are', 'incredible', 'enhance', 'scenery.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'amazon', 'WB', 'sell', 'part', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'season', 'one']",Tarzan - Season One: Part One

It is one of my favorites from my childhood. The scenery depicting the African jungle contributed to my fascination with the entire African continent which endures to this day.  My deep love for African wildlife was no doubt shaped by this show.  I didn't know at the time the profound effect the show would have upon me.From what I have read, they have done an excellent job in presenting these episodes I assumed would be lost forever.  I am so glad to see them on the market finally.  I only wish it was available as a regular dvd, not a DVD-r format.  I believe that format will not hold up as long as a regular dvd.  Make a backup is all I can tell you.  Even in this format, I intend to buy, if they release both seasons.  I am just waiting for the price to be a much more attractive. I refuse to pay the full going rate for a show that is placed on inferior media.  That's what dvd-r is, inferior.This set is no doubt like a time capsule from the second half of the 1960s.
