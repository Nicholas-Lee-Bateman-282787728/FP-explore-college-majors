Come on, a plot that focuses on *debating* and debate clubs?The kid who plays the lead character has a speech problem. He can't speak clearly around girls, or whenever he's nervous. The girl he tries making out with in the janitors closet talks at lightning speed because she is a huge part of this debate team that she wanted the boy to join.It's just not a very good plot if you ask me.Perhaps I just didn't get the appeal of this one (having never been a part of a debate team and never having trouble speaking clearly) but to me this was one lousy movie based on the storyline alone. A terribly uninteresting storyline, and nothing that's seriously worth your time. The humor they tried throwing in at certain spots (such as the one kid wearing a bra and the female neighbor spotting this through the window) was decent enough, but not frequent enough to save the film I'm afraid.Rent the movie because people apparently like it, but I don't see the appeal of it.",2,somewhat boring,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,1071,"[""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'couple', 'reasons-One', 'not', 'memorable', 'storyline', 'begin', 'Come', 'plot', '*debating*', 'debate', 'clubs', 'kid', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'speech', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'clearly', 'girls', 'nervous', 'girl', 'making', 'out', 'janitors', 'closet', 'talks', 'lightning', 'speed', 'huge', 'part', 'debate', 'team', 'wanted', 'boy', 'join.It', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'ask', 'me.Perhaps', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'appeal', 'one', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'part', 'debate', 'team', 'never', 'having', 'trouble', 'speaking', 'clearly', 'was', 'one', 'lousy', 'movie', 'based', 'storyline', 'alone', 'terribly', 'uninteresting', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'seriously', 'worth', 'time', 'humor', 'tried', 'throwing', 'certain', 'spots', 'such', 'one', 'kid', 'wearing', 'bra', 'female', 'neighbor', 'spotting', 'window', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'not', 'frequent', 'enough', 'save', 'film', ""'m"", 'afraid.Rent', 'movie', 'people', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'appeal']",N/A
1119656,APVNDUMOTRJ78,B000YEROYC,E. Drake,"[0, 0]","I liked this film quite a bit for a number of reasons which compliment most of the departments working to put together a movie. Acting, for example was  exceptional. Surely Reece Thompson's Hal Hefner (the main character) is on par with Ellen Page's Juno. The Directing was covered with a unique up-and-coming mind and eye, Jeffrey Blitz. There is that indie-feeling all over this film, which is both comforting and, well, comfortably annoying. As for writing (also in Jeffrey Blitz' hands) his latest film was lovingly made with exceptional attention being paid to teenage angst. As I watched the film, I felt it, I recalled it and I can even say I relived it at times.  The fact that Hal was a stutterer is just icing on the cake.  Te bottom line was that great care was taken into the writing of this story for an awkward boy who is in love or infatuated or simply didn't care what he was. I also loved Eef Barzelay, musical score. Eef Barzelay was/is apart of the indie-folk/rock/country band Clem SnideYour Favorite MusicThe Ghost of FashionThese are two relaxing, very suburban New Jersey feeling albums.However............I guess this film just caught me at the wrong time. After seeing a number of fairytales and fantasies, I simply needed something real and ""Rocket Science"", which I am the first to say was very true in its representation of the mind of the teenager, just wasn't real enough for me. In my very suburban high school (which just so happens to be in New Jersey like this film), no one could ever talk and think the way these great debaters in the film could, no one (no matter how high on LSD) could or would ever throw a cello through a living room window, and lunch ladies would wait ever-so-motherly for you to say whether you want pizza or fish. Oh and brothers did not have Brooklyn accents, when I spoke with a more common New Jersey/General American accent.Aside from these few annoyances...for indie- film lovers, satisfaction is almost guaranteed.",4,"Not Real, But Good Anyways",1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,1980,"['liked', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'number', 'reasons', 'compliment', 'most', 'departments', 'working', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'Acting', 'example', 'was', 'exceptional', 'Surely', 'Reece', 'Thompson', 'Hal', 'Hefner', 'main', 'character', 'par', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Juno', 'Directing', 'was', 'covered', 'unique', 'up-and-coming', 'mind', 'eye', 'Jeffrey', 'Blitz', 'indie-feeling', 'film', 'comforting', 'well', 'comfortably', 'annoying', 'writing', 'also', 'Jeffrey', 'Blitz', 'hands', 'latest', 'film', 'was', 'lovingly', 'made', 'exceptional', 'attention', 'being', 'paid', 'teenage', 'angst', 'watched', 'film', 'felt', 'recalled', 'can', 'even', 'say', 'relived', 'times', 'fact', 'Hal', 'was', 'stutterer', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'Te', 'bottom', 'line', 'was', 'great', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'writing', 'story', 'awkward', 'boy', 'who', 'love', 'infatuated', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'was', 'also', 'loved', 'Eef', 'Barzelay', 'musical', 'score', 'Eef', 'Barzelay', 'was/is', 'apart', 'indie-folk/rock/country', 'band', 'Clem', 'SnideYour', 'Favorite', 'MusicThe', 'Ghost', 'FashionThese', 'are', 'two', 'relaxing', 'very', 'suburban', 'New', 'Jersey', 'feeling', 'albums.However', 'guess', 'film', 'just', 'caught', 'wrong', 'time', 'seeing', 'number', 'fairytales', 'fantasies', 'simply', 'needed', 'something', 'real', 'Rocket', 'Science', 'am', 'first', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'representation', 'mind', 'teenager', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'enough', 'very', 'suburban', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'New', 'Jersey', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'talk', 'think', 'way', 'great', 'debaters', 'film', 'could', 'one', 'matter', 'how', 'high', 'LSD', 'could', 'would', 'ever', 'throw', 'cello', 'living', 'room', 'window', 'lunch', 'ladies', 'would', 'wait', 'ever-so-motherly', 'say', 'want', 'pizza', 'fish', 'Oh', 'brothers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Brooklyn', 'accents', 'when', 'spoke', 'more', 'common', 'New', 'Jersey/General', 'American', 'few', 'annoyances', 'indie-', 'film', 'lovers', 'satisfaction', 'almost', 'guaranteed']",N/A

1119658,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B000YEROYC,Howard Schumann,"[27, 29]","For some, the joys of being a teenager include excelling at sports, having a girlfriend or boyfriend, being part of a close circle of friends, or just having fun. For others, there is only the constant feeling of being an outsider looking in. For some, even the thought of getting out of bed in the morning to go to school is filled with dread. Case in point - Hal Hefner, a fifteen year old attending Plainsboro High School in New Jersey, who is trying to make sense of growing up but is burdened by a stutter so debilitating that he cannot even tell the cafeteria worker at school that he wants pizza instead of fish. Rocket Science, the second feature by Jeffrey Blitz (Spellbound), who overcame his own stuttering disability, is a teen comedy that poignantly captures the painful loneliness of adolescence.While on paper Rocket Science sounds like other coming of age films such as Election and Rushmore, it manages to capture something unique and very special about being a teenager without having to rely on grossness, stereotypes, or implausible situations. Brilliantly played by Vancouver actor Reece Thompson, Hal's sweetness and innocence is totally captivating and we identify with his pain and root for him to succeed. His family support, however, is virtually nonexistent. His brother Earl (Vincent Piazza) is a compulsive thief and bully who calls him by girls' names, his father has moved out of the house and his mother (Lizbeth Bartlett) has a Korean boyfriend, a Small Claims judge, (Steve Park) who laughs inappropriately and whose son Heston (Aaron Yu), a bisexual, shows an unusual amount of interest in him.Hal has a speech therapist, Mr. Lewinsky (Maury Ginsberg), but he is so incompetent that he tells him that he wishes Hal was hyperactive so he would know how to treat him. Under these circumstances, the last place he would want to be is on the high school debating team, a collection of driven, super-confident word magicians who can speak with authority at breakneck speed on both sides of an issue. Surprisingly however, Hal is recruited by top debater Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick) to be her debate partner after her former partner Ben Wekselbaum (Nicholas D'Agosto) went blank at last year's championship match.Ginny, a charming but overly aggressive super student, tells Hal that ""deformed people"" make good competitors because they have so much anger to express.  Hal's first inclination is to say no but he is so taken with Ginny and flattered that someone could see some possibility in him that he accepts. Giving it the old high school try, he stumbles badly both in pursuing his romance and in debating the subject of sexual abstinence in high school, so badly in fact that he often has to hide in the janitor's closet from embarrassment.Mr. Lewinsky advises Hal to try singing the words of the debate to the tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic, or speaking with a foreign accent and he does both with hilarious effect. Partly out of revenge and partly out of desperation, he turns to failed debater Ben Wekselbaum, now working in Trenton in a cleaners, to be his new partner after Ginny transfers to a different school. The ending is ripe for the big debate in which all the pieces fit neatly together but Blitz does not go there. Instead he relies on the inner strength of the characters to see them through, not on a contrived narrative.While there are some predictably oddball characters like Philosophy major Lionel (Jonah Hill), pint-sized Josh (Lewis Garrles) who spies on Ginny for him (and models her bra that he has stolen), and an older couple who practice the Kama Sutra and play Violent Femmes ""Blister In The Sun"" duets on the cello and piano, Rocket Science has few false notes. It is wise, honest, funny, touching, and painfully sad with Oscar-caliber performances.

It's a story of teens that actually captures that cinematic chimera: how it feels to be a real teenager. Lots of movies try to capture that feeling -- of being alien, inferior, bold, romantic, clueless, and brilliant -- but Rocket Science actually bottles it. For that reason, alone, I recommend it highly. But, Rocket Science is also a carefully crafted story with creative flourishes aplenty, a slew of strong performances, and an inventive story. If there is a flaw, it is with the central device of the young protagonist getting roped into being on the debate team -- I'm not sure how well thought out the plan is ... what does it achieve, really?

He trudges through each day being noticed by as few people as possible, but one day he found out that he could not escape Ginny. She is the star of the debate team and she tries to recruit Hal so his ""hidden talent"" can come out. Her words inspire him...almost as much as her looks. He devotes his free time to learning her craft and winning her affection.When I saw this was a movie about a kid trying to find himself amongst his problems by joining the debate team, I was terrified it was Thumbsucker all over again. While the movies, on a broad scale, seem to encompass many of the same issues, they are very different movies. (And for what it is worth, I liked Rocket Science a good deal more than I did Thumbsucker.)The story itself was decent, but I was impressed more with the details. Each character was great; there was not a single one I would have left out. Reece Thompson was great as Hal. I think I was impressed most with how he was able to make the part so complex. But all secondary and tertiary characters from Hal's brother, to his mom's new boyfriend, to the little 12-year-old pervert who lives across the street from Ginny added to the experience.I loved how the movie glorified debate. I love how the movie glorified New Jersey. And I love how the movie glorified the sweet revenge of giving someone the finger.Rocket Science had a few scenes that were weird enough to notice, but not to keep me from enjoying this movie or recommending it to others. I thought the writing was well done and more mature than the movie's high-school setting might suggest. Rocket Science had some of the genuine character that seems to only hover around smaller movies and draws me away from Hollywood more each year.

In the case of Hal Hefner, his stuttering is downright troubling especially when everyone can easily tease and bully your insecurities.  Hal becomes very aware of it and becomes the target of Virginia Ryerson, debate team queen.  In many ways, Ginny is the best thing that happens to Hal.  He tackles his stuttering problem in front of everyone.  Miracles don't happen overnight so this film keeps true to life's obstacles.  I won't give away what happens, but the film in general charms you in the way that you realize life's journey is a series of small steps forward.The soundtrack to this film is pretty good with alot of independent artists.  So, I will be checking out the CD soundtrack to this film.  The bonus features on the DVD are the music video to a song in the film as well as making the film documentary.  Personally, the music video was more interesting than the making the film documentary.  To be fair to the documentary, the director does explain how he got his idea behind the film.  So, it's worth to hear about his life lessons which he tries to put into the film.  I think that I can personally relate to Hal since I always had a fear of public speaking.  In college, I joined the speech and debate team and my partner was this girl who made debating seem like child's play.  So, I felt like a dead weight in our competitions.  But, you make the best of every situation and try to get over your weakness of stage fright.",3,Life In General Isn't Rocket Science,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1599,"['Well', 'think', 'movie', 'honest', 'attempt', 'childhood', 'struggles', 'Part', 'frustrations', 'life', 'not', 'having', 'problems', 'completely', 'solved', 'case', 'Hal', 'Hefner', 'stuttering', 'downright', 'troubling', 'especially', 'when', 'everyone', 'can', 'easily', 'tease', 'bully', 'insecurities', 'Hal', 'very', 'aware', 'target', 'Virginia', 'Ryerson', 'debate', 'team', 'queen', 'many', 'ways', 'Ginny', 'best', 'thing', 'Hal', 'stuttering', 'problem', 'front', 'everyone', 'Miracles', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'overnight', 'so', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'obstacles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'film', 'general', 'charms', 'way', 'realize', 'life', 'journey', 'series', 'small', 'steps', 'forward.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'alot', 'independent', 'artists', 'So', 'will', 'be', 'checking', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'are', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'film', 'documentary', 'Personally', 'music', 'video', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'making', 'film', 'documentary', 'be', 'fair', 'documentary', 'director', 'explain', 'how', 'got', 'idea', 'film', 'So', 'worth', 'hear', 'life', 'lessons', 'put', 'film', 'think', 'can', 'personally', 'relate', 'Hal', 'always', 'had', 'fear', 'public', 'speaking', 'college', 'joined', 'speech', 'debate', 'team', 'partner', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'made', 'debating', 'seem', 'child', 'play', 'So', 'felt', 'dead', 'weight', 'competitions', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'try', 'get', 'weakness', 'stage', 'fright']",N/A
