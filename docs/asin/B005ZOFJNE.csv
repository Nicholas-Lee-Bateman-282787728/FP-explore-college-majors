1505924,A1H57S6ZRGQG84,B005ZOFJNE,"Elder Dave ""adman62""","[0, 0]","I was very much  appreciative of the work of the filmmakers in presenting a reverential biography of Dogen that focuses on the founding of the Soto school of Zen in Japan. I was most struck by its allegorical and metaphorical nature. Though some have seen little or no value in the Orin subplot, it seems to me a largely parallel story to that of Jesus' ministry and the conversion (at least in terms of church history which was apparently mistaken) of Mary Magdalene who was styled as a prostitute but ultimately became very important in the founding of Christianity. The truth of the film lies in the struggle of faith against adversity and the elevation of the purity of the basic tenets of Zen,  meditation--in Dogen's case, shikantaza, as inseparable from enlightenment, the awakening to the Original Self and the falling away of the illusive structures of mind. The shadow of the Jesus story reinforces the universal longing for, and attainability of, redemption.The cinematography is beautifully done, with images of landscape, sky, moon, water and other symbols that serve to underscore the teachings of Dogen and serve as metaphors. The acting is heartfelt and reverential. As with most films of Jesus, Dogen is portrayed as a dauntless leader who perseveres and is loved by his followers who, in this film, give a number of strong performances. Dogen, himself, is played by a kabuki actor who handles the role with great care and investment.Any telling of a man's story, his accomplishments, his process, is an allegory of the abstract notion of the human condition. This film points the finger at Zen and it's place in the experience of each individual, and it persuades us to forget the finger and just do the sitting. I feel refreshed by the honesty of it, and I would highly recommend this film .",5,A Reverential Historical Biography and Allegory,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1810,"['was', 'very', 'much', 'appreciative', 'work', 'filmmakers', 'presenting', 'reverential', 'biography', 'Dogen', 'founding', 'Soto', 'school', 'Zen', 'Japan', 'was', 'most', 'struck', 'allegorical', 'metaphorical', 'nature', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'value', 'Orin', 'subplot', 'largely', 'parallel', 'story', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'conversion', 'least', 'terms', 'church', 'history', 'was', 'apparently', 'mistaken', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'who', 'was', 'styled', 'prostitute', 'ultimately', 'became', 'very', 'important', 'founding', 'Christianity', 'truth', 'film', 'struggle', 'faith', 'adversity', 'elevation', 'purity', 'basic', 'tenets', 'Zen', 'meditation', 'Dogen', 'case', 'shikantaza', 'inseparable', 'enlightenment', 'awakening', 'Original', 'Self', 'falling', 'away', 'illusive', 'structures', 'mind', 'shadow', 'Jesus', 'story', 'universal', 'longing', 'attainability', 'redemption.The', 'cinematography', 'beautifully', 'done', 'images', 'landscape', 'sky', 'moon', 'water', 'other', 'symbols', 'serve', 'underscore', 'teachings', 'Dogen', 'serve', 'metaphors', 'acting', 'heartfelt', 'reverential', 'most', 'films', 'Jesus', 'Dogen', 'portrayed', 'dauntless', 'leader', 'who', 'loved', 'followers', 'who', 'film', 'give', 'number', 'strong', 'performances', 'Dogen', 'played', 'kabuki', 'actor', 'who', 'role', 'great', 'care', 'investment.Any', 'telling', 'man', 'story', 'accomplishments', 'process', 'allegory', 'abstract', 'notion', 'human', 'condition', 'film', 'finger', 'Zen', 'place', 'experience', 'individual', 'forget', 'finger', 'just', 'do', 'sitting', 'feel', 'refreshed', 'honesty', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Zen
