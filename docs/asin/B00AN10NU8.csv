1614068,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00AN10NU8,John's Horror Corner,"[3, 4]","Charlie (Marc Singer; The Beastmaster, Beastmaster 2), Don (Art LaFleur; The Rig, Hostage) and their families (wives and two teenagers) both happen to be house hunting when their paths cross as they come upon a lonely house in the woods.  Both men find the lonely house in the pristine land appealing, but the mood immediately changes when they stumble across a strange, battered, terrified young lady (Rebekah Kennedy; Season of the Witch, Creature) with her tongue cut out running in the woods from something.  In an attempt to drive her to a hospital they find that the road continues to somehow return them to the house.  Again and again they drive away from the house only to be returned by some supernatural force.Forced to stay in the house overnight, their sanity is tested and they begin to lose patience with one another.  There is no electricity, it's cold, and they find seven cans of ""stew"" in a cupboard--and there's seven of them.  Weird yet?  It gets weirder.  They see a strange man walking his dog who somehow disappears in front of them before they could ask him about the house and the next morning the cupboard has been somehow restocked with seven cans of stew.  Don's son Jason insists that the strange tongueless girl knows what's going on or, worse, that she is behind it somehow.Days go by, stew is restocked, and attempts to leave on foot continue to return them to the house.  Another oddity is Jason, who taunts and comes on to Charlie's daughter and is clearly attracted to her stepmother as well.  Yet more weird, they start seeing other people that simply ""aren't there.""  This begins to steer character psychology and interactions.As they do what they can to keep their limited sanity, passing time in the house, they learn that some of them are connected to the previous owners.  But as the days wear on, the number of stew cans restocked in the cupboard drops to six and things continue to get weirder.This film never seems to go anywhere, yet it has no problem maintaining my interest.  This is one of those weird movies that keeps you guessing while giving you nothing.  There's not a lot of blood, but there's a lot to keep our attention.Give this film a shot.

Grandcolas ""Stiggs""","[0, 0]","I have a few reservations but taken on a whole (suspending your disbelief a bit in order to accept the premiss) House Hunting is on par with some of the better haunted house films.  Unfortunately the bloody photo of Marc Singer on the cover of the DVD package is mis-leading - making the film appear to be a slasher movie which it isn't. (at least not very much) This type of marketing will disappoint gore hounds while causing the rest of us to miss this spooky little film.The fact is that House Hunting a very good understated horror film relying on interesting characters, excellent acting, eerie atmosphere and an imaginative story  - not slashings, gore or CG. Director Eric Hurt showed great restraint by keeping special effects and the usual tired attempts at shocks to a bare minimum. What Mr. Hurt did create was a very well acted, interesting little horror film that draws you into the troubled world of the characters and their ""non-adjustment"" to a house they visited and may never leave.The film moves along at a well timed, deliberate pass and boasts a nice moody soundtrack that is never overdone or cliched. Speaking of cliches - the characters in the cast could very easily been turned into walking cliches but for the most part all the actors and director kept this from happening.  all the actors were top notch and there were no show offs and no weak spots in the cast. I would recommend this film to audience's who appreciate films along the lines of the original Haunting, the Shining, The Innocence or some of the great Val Lewton films (mind you House Hunting is not quite their equivalent) I subtracted one star - why? read spoilers below if your interested - but do not read them before you see the film.The following are my only reservations about this good Haunted House film - These are spoilers!!! There are a few shots of the ghosts where we see them for what they are - which I can only describe as appearing like the ""open mouth demon-like faces"" from ""The Ring.""  This has become an over-used cliche that only takes the viewer out of the film. The ghosts could have been more ambiguous  - is it ghosts or madness?  The final ""tongue cut scene"" in the film is rather obvious and tacky. This scene should have been implied not shown. The obvious ending was a disappointment.  Finally there are numerous holes in the story, and a number of things that just don't add up: The spirit of a little girl returns to her mother which causes a problem between the parents - This plot point is interesting but is given no explanation.  There is no attempt at logical communication with the mute girl - anyone heard of writing? - simply not logical.  Finally the film seems to indicate that the ghosts are out for revenge  - if this is the premise -  then there is no logical explanation as to why the ghosts victimize the innocent Emma or the parents of the the teenage hit and run driver or for the ghost's to victimize the previous visitors or the following visitors for that matter.",4,Top Haunted House film,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3008,"['have', 'few', 'reservations', 'taken', 'whole', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'bit', 'order', 'accept', 'premiss', 'House', 'Hunting', 'par', 'better', 'haunted', 'house', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'bloody', 'photo', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'cover', 'DVD', 'package', 'mis-leading', 'making', 'film', 'appear', 'be', 'slasher', 'movie', ""n't"", 'least', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'type', 'marketing', 'will', 'disappoint', 'gore', 'hounds', 'causing', 'rest', 'miss', 'spooky', 'little', 'film.The', 'fact', 'House', 'Hunting', 'very', 'good', 'understated', 'horror', 'film', 'relying', 'interesting', 'characters', 'excellent', 'acting', 'atmosphere', 'imaginative', 'story', 'not', 'slashings', 'gore', 'CG', 'Director', 'Eric', 'Hurt', 'showed', 'great', 'restraint', 'keeping', 'special', 'effects', 'usual', 'tired', 'attempts', 'shocks', 'bare', 'minimum', 'What', 'Mr.', 'Hurt', 'did', 'create', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'interesting', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'troubled', 'world', 'characters', 'non-adjustment', 'house', 'visited', 'may', 'never', 'leave.The', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'timed', 'deliberate', 'pass', 'nice', 'moody', 'soundtrack', 'never', 'overdone', 'cliched', 'Speaking', 'cliches', 'characters', 'cast', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'been', 'turned', 'walking', 'cliches', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'director', 'kept', 'happening', 'actors', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'were', 'show', 'offs', 'weak', 'spots', 'cast', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'audience', 'who', 'appreciate', 'films', 'lines', 'original', 'Haunting', 'Shining', 'Innocence', 'great', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'films', 'House', 'Hunting', 'not', 'quite', 'equivalent', 'subtracted', 'one', 'star', 'why', 'read', 'spoilers', 'interested', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'see', 'film.The', 'following', 'are', 'only', 'reservations', 'good', 'Haunted', 'House', 'film', 'are', 'spoilers', 'are', 'few', 'shots', 'ghosts', 'where', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'appearing', 'open', 'mouth', 'demon-like', 'Ring', 'become', 'over-used', 'cliche', 'only', 'viewer', 'film', 'ghosts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'madness', 'final', 'tongue', 'cut', 'scene', 'film', 'rather', 'obvious', 'tacky', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'implied', 'not', 'shown', 'obvious', 'ending', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Finally', 'are', 'numerous', 'holes', 'story', 'number', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'spirit', 'little', 'girl', 'returns', 'mother', 'problem', 'parents', 'plot', 'point', 'interesting', 'given', 'explanation', 'attempt', 'logical', 'communication', 'mute', 'girl', 'anyone', 'heard', 'writing', 'simply', 'not', 'logical', 'Finally', 'film', 'indicate', 'ghosts', 'are', 'out', 'revenge', 'premise', 'then', 'logical', 'explanation', 'why', 'ghosts', 'victimize', 'innocent', 'Emma', 'parents', 'teenage', 'hit', 'run', 'driver', 'ghost', 'victimize', 'previous', 'visitors', 'following', 'visitors', 'matter']",House Hunting
