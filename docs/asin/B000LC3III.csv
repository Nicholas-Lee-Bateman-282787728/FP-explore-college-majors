1038000,A3CDJ2DVD5MZ3C,B000LC3III,"B. Lovian ""blovian""","[0, 3]","Some straight to DVD documentaries leave you wanting more.  This one, if anything, is too long.  I ended up fast-forwarding through parts where it was obvious they would have a bunch of interviewees saying basically the same thing.  It could have used tighter editing.As for the Horsemen, it's clear from this account that they should have retired this gimmick well before they were down to 2 original members.  They kept reforming, with one short-lived arrangement after the other -- some so bad they were laughable.When Arn Anderson was shown in his mid 20s, he looked about 40.  When he retired at 40, he looked 40.  In his interviews for this DVD, he still looks pretty much the same as he always has.Unfortunately, Ric Flair is barely recognizable from the man he was just 10 years ago.  I grew up watching him in his heyday and as a sincere and true fan of his, I wish he would have retired after the final match on WCW he had vs. Sting.  He's been mainly a sideshow on WWE, although a year ago he had an incredible (and dangerous) table,ladder,chair match vs. Edge and got the hell beat out of him.  I don't know how he does it, I have all the respect for him in the world, but the Ric Flair I remember wasn't the ""good guy"", didn't show up to matches as an underdog old man to make you feel sorry for him.  He was ""the man"", the dirtiest player in the game, the World Champion -- but in order to extend his career past 50 he's had to assume the role of someone else entirely.  And while Vince McMahon still looks and sounds good with charisma to spare at 62 (despite his apparently declining mental capacity as reflected in his increasingly terrible ""creative"" decisions), Flair does not, despite being younger.Some people have different ""peak"" years.  Vince didn't really hit his stride until his 50s.  Flair was at his best in his late 30s-early 40s.  Britney Spears was past her prime by 19.

1038001,A18CEASUWUTJ1J,B000LC3III,Bob Millwood,"[2, 16]",I've been waiting a long time to see a dvd about the Horsemen since I've only watched them during the time that Sullivan was the booker and he kinda hated Benoit and Pillman.  I do hope that they include some of the viewpoints from the members of the Horsemen that are still alive I mean the WWe has a chance to really make this a great dvd and I hope they include some of Benoit's matches with Sullivan on this dvd.  I mean sure the matches might not have been tag team matches but they was done during the time that he was a member of the Horsemen also I hope they include the tag team match between Ric Flair and Arn Anderson going against the Late Brian Pillman and Steve Austin which in my opinion was one of the greatest tag team matches of all time.  I'm also hoping they include some of Flair's matches with Sting and some of Arn's matches on this dvd as well as Ole's matches since there really isn't a place to watch those anymore unless you get WWe 24-7.,5,Been waiting a long time,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,965,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'dvd', 'Horsemen', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'time', 'Sullivan', 'was', 'booker', 'kinda', 'hated', 'Benoit', 'Pillman', 'do', 'hope', 'include', 'viewpoints', 'members', 'Horsemen', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'mean', 'WWe', 'chance', 'really', 'make', 'great', 'dvd', 'hope', 'include', 'Benoit', 'matches', 'Sullivan', 'dvd', 'mean', 'sure', 'matches', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'tag', 'team', 'matches', 'was', 'done', 'time', 'was', 'member', 'Horsemen', 'also', 'hope', 'include', 'tag', 'team', 'match', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'Arn', 'Anderson', 'going', 'Late', 'Brian', 'Pillman', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'tag', 'team', 'matches', 'time', ""'m"", 'also', 'hoping', 'include', 'Flair', 'matches', 'Sting', 'Arn', 'matches', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'Ole', 'matches', 'really', ""n't"", 'place', 'watch', 'get', 'WWe', '24-7']",Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen

1038003,A1FIVS87ALL6WH,B000LC3III,Bran,"[1, 1]","This is a very good overall DVD.  The first DVD featured the documentary portion which is almost always incredible for most of the WWE releases so this one is no exception.  There is only one beef I have with the documentary portion of the DVD and most of the comments written before me already touched on it which was; Arn Anderson damn near stayed in ""character"" on the DVD which he should not have been.  The only reason why I gave it four out of five stars was because there wasn't enough matches on the second DVD and I feel like it should have been more than that.  My favorite stable of the 4 Horsemen were:  Anderson, Blanchard, Flair and Windham.  I think at that point they were at the pinnacle of the stable and their careers.  I do think that if Pillman stayed in WCW in the later 90's (with the Horsemen) that would have been incredible too.Which brings me to the next point.  The people who should've never been considered Horsemen are:  McMichael (can't wrestle), Roma (especially him!), Sting (why would WCW toy with that idea?), Vicious (terrible) and Jarrett (pathetic!).Overall I highly recommend to add it to your wrestling DVD connnection just to bring back the memories.  I wonder if the WWE will release a DVD on Ravishing Rick Rude or Ricky Steamboat.

1038007,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B000LC3III,D.P.,"[9, 9]","Before the nWo, DX, and Evolution...there was the Four Horsemen. This was the elite stable/faction in wrestling that dominated the late 1980's in the NWA to the point where they're influence on wrestling is still being felt to this day & will be felt on throughout professional wrestling. In this DVD, you get comments from almost all the horsemen except Brian Pillman (R.I.P.), Sting, Sid, Ole Anderson, Lex Luger, Jeff Jarrett, and Steve McMichael. With that said, you hear from all other members of the Horsemen and how they rated each member of the group.The documentary starts on Ric Flair helping Arn Anderson break into the NWA with his resemblance to Ole Anderson forming the Minnesota Wrecking Crew. The real story behind the Anderson's ""family ties"" with Flair is discovered along with quick profiles on Flair & Tully Blanchard before the story of how all 4 men united against Magnum T.A. & Dusty Rhodes is told. How J.J. Dillion was factored into the equation, the story behind the ""4 Horsemen"" name and the impact they had as a group is also chronicled. Their feud with Dusty Rhodes is discussed including hearing the story behind the Horsemen attacking Dusty Rhodes in a parking lot & how that resulted in fans demanding that they would be brought up on police charges. The ""high roller"" lifestyle that the Horsemen lived & talked about on promos is highlighted before moving on the story of behind Lex Luger replacing Ole Anderson in the Horsemen. The funniest part of the documentary is next when Ric & Dillion talk about the Precious angle where Ric Flair won a date with her & how they were building it up until Ronnie Garvin (dressed like a woman) ruined the whole thing. The concept behind the War Games match & how important a role Dusty & Arn had in it is heavily discussed with additional comments from Road Warriors manager Precious Paul Ellering. The tag team of Arn & Tully is glossed upon before getting to the story behind Lex Luger leaving the Horsemen & Barry Windham eventually taking his place. The story behind the Horsemen having a monopoly on the championships and how that lead to problems in the locker room is discussed before Arn & Tully talk about leaving the NWA because they felt like they were being underpaid to the point where Tully mentioned that J.J. got paid 3x's more than he did for a PPV match. The aftermath of Arn & Tully leaving, the NWA being bought by Ted Turner, and the placement of Jim Herd in WCW's management is discussed along with the story behind Kendall Windham's association with the Horsemen with comments from Kendall himself. Hiro Matsuda replacing J.J. Dillion and how that made things even worse for the current state of the Horsemen is discussed along with the story behind Arn Anderson returning WITHOUT Tully Blanchard & Barry Windham himself leaving. The true story behind Sting becoming a Horsemen and his rivalry with Ric Flair is heavily discussed including the infamous ""Black Scorpion"" angle that Flair himself even admit was embarrassing. The story behind Sid Vicious being put into the group to the heavy disapproval of Ric Flair is brought up before Flair discusses how he left WCW (which was heavily censored), why his WWE run didn't live up to expectations, and his return back to WCW. This is one of the most interesting parts of this DVD as they talk about Paul Roma joining the Horsemen with Roma himself talking about what he brought more to the table that ""Pillsbury dough boy"" Anderson & ""98 year old"" Flair couldn't. The hotel incident involving Sid Vicious stabbing Arn Anderson with scissors and how that led to the Roma version of the Horsemen ending. The brief Anderson/Flair rivalry in late '95 that eventually lead to the '96 version of the Horsemen with Pillman, Benoit, and eventually Steve McMichael is gone into detail including how much of a role the ladies (Elizabeth, Woman, Debra McMichael) played on & off the camera. The storyline behind Jeff Jarrett becoming a member of the Horsemen is briefly discussed...in a negative light...before the importance of Arn Anderson's retirement is heavily discussed. The problems between them, Eric Bischoff & the nWo is heavily discussed as the story behind Ric Flair disappearing in '98 is told from both sides along with comments regarding the nWo's mockery of Anderson's retirement speech. The last version of the Horsemen is discussed along with why it didn't work out with everyone going their separate ways before ending the DVD on the legacy the 4 Horsemen left on the sport.Matches Include:Ric Flair, Arn & Ole Anderson vs. Pez Whatley, Italian Stallion, Rocky King - Despite what the chapter menu & insert booklet advertised, Tully Blanchard wasn't in this match, it was Ole Anderson.  This was your typical TV match in which it was an exibition for the future Horsemen showcasing both their offensive & defensive skills.""NWA World Championship Wrestling"" June '85Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky Morton - Ricky Morton was out for revenge here against Flair for the Horsemen breaking his nose & as a side note, Ric Flair sure knew how to make one hell of an entrance for this event.  Ricky took the fight right to Flair in the beginning & even ""made an ass"" out of him at one point.  Flair heavily targeted his broken nose using the steel cage to assist him while Morton returned the favor with the cage later on.  This was a match that went back & forth with Morton coming so close various times to getting the victory.NWA Great American Bash '86First Blood Match: Tully Blanchard vs. NWA Television Champion Dusty Rhodes - This match had a very comedic beginning with the antics of both Tully & James J. Dillion resulting in Dillion bleeding worse than anyone else involved in the match.  With the way this match was structured, this was a different encounter than usual as both men were wrestling more of a defensive style & heavily protecting shots to the head while also giving out more impactful blows to the other's head.  This was a good match with great storytelling by both men.NWA Starrcade '86War Games Match: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham, James J. Dillion vs. Dusty Rhodes, Lex Luger, Steve Williams, Nikita Koloff, Paul Ellering - For those who never seen a War Games match, it's a two ringed cage match with a caged top on it & the first two wrestlers go in for 5 minute period. A coin toss is held (which the heels always seem to win) to determine who goes in next and the teams alternate wrestlers entering the match. When the final wrestler enters the cage, the only way to win is by submission or surrender.After reading some of the other reviews, I know some would have opted for one of the two original War Games matches however this one is a special treat as this is a rare match concidering how it never happened on PPV or was released onto video tape unlike all the other War Games matches.  This was just a battle as it got real bloody & violent with all men just beating the crap out of each other with their bare fist before ""The Match Beyond"" actually began.  This is really just a unique match to sit back & watch to see how so many different styles came together for this match.NWA July '88NWA World Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Nikita Koloff - They went to the 20 min. draw here but it was a solid match here from beginning to end. You saw the traits of what made Arn & Tully one of the greatest tag teams as they cut the ring in half & always kept their opponetts in control while Sting & Nikita held their own here as well.NWA Great American Bash '88(""Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams"")NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - The team also known as the ""Twin Towers"" dominated the first half of this match to the point where Luger he got the Torture Rack on Tully in the first minute & Barry had a sleeperhold so tight on Tully that he was able to keep it on when they both rolled out of the ring. The Horsemen later caught up & did what they did best in tag team wrestling by cutting the ring in half & making their quick tags having this match go back & forth between both teams with the crowd hot the entire time. James J. Dillion got involved in the end as this match didn't go long but it was non-stop action from start to finish.""NWA Clash Of The Champions"" Mar. '88(""Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers"")Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson - As they talked about on the documentry, this was a match that nobody would ever thought they see but deep down...was curious about & did want to see to the point where you saw various WCW talent sitting in the audience just to see what happens.  Since both men knew each other so much, this had various moments where both men ended up showing each other up at one point & hitting their trademark moves while at times countering the other person's moves.  This lived up to the hype it had down to the commentary putting over just how close & personal this match was but with who got involved in the end & how things ended up happening within the next month, this match would be the starting point to the reunion of the next generation of the Horsemen.WCW Fall Brawl '95Other DVD extras include interview outtakes such as the story behind the Horsemen interviews & ""The Four Horsemen Vitamins"", J.J. Dillion talking about this pre-War Games match & getting surgery, Tully Blanchard remembering a college kid buying a Rolex because the Horsemen did, Jim Ross' relationship with the Horsemen, Barry Windham remembering being busted open by Lex Luger, Ric Flair on his wildest night in the business, and Dean Malenko talking about how he met Arn Anderson & a funny story about a hardcore Chris Benoit fan who had no thumbs. 10 Horsemen promos are included such as Ric Flair's WCW return in '98, Sting being kicked out the group, and J.J. Dillion receiving a ring as a gift from the Horsemen. Easter eggs include two hidden Horsemen promos, Dusty Rhodes talking about Arn & Tully leaving, Ric Flair discussing Bischoff's reaction to Sting beating him, and the true story behind J.J. Dillion's ring.Overall, WWE did another legend (or in this case legends) justice as they presented not just the best or worst but the complete story of the Horsemen. Plus as a fan of old school wrestling, getting the chance to see some of this old footage is just an added plus. The only thing negative I could say is that I wish they had the original War Games match on here since that was the one talked about on the documentary and it didn't make any sense for Dean Malenko to have comments in the extras section but none in the documentary. Besides those two little things, I highly recommend for any TRUE fan of wrestling.",5,DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER...AND SO ARE THE HORSEMEN!,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,10761,"['nWo', 'DX', 'Evolution',

1038011,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,B000LC3III,Ervin Griffin,"[21, 26]","The reason I am giving this set a 5 star rating is mostly for the bio! True, Arn Anderson is in character for most of this but quite frankly, there is little difference between his in-ring character and the real man so I didn't get upset about that at all.As for the bio itself, it was great but you can get some negative vibes at times (especially when discussing Ole Anderson, Paul Roma, former WCW Executive Vice President Jim Herd and Eric Bischoff)! I know some fans would've liked to have heard from other former members like Lex Luger, Sting or Ole Anderson but you have to remember something here. Sting currently works for TNA (at the time that I am writing this) so there was no way he was going to be on this project and neither Lex nor Ole are on good terms with WWE. Plus, with the way Ole bashed Ric recently in his own autobiography, I doubt they would've wanted him on the project anyway as a lot of people have grudges against him. Still, I would've rather heard from Ole than ROMA! That guy is VERY DELUSIONAL! Even at near 60, Flair can still work a better match than Paul Roma in his prime! I'll take a 100 year old Flair over Roma any day! You got to hear the comments. This guy is on crack!As it was, the bio was great as they discussed the different groups and how a lot the changes were made more for political reasons rather than good business sense. They also said that some changes were made by non-wrestling officials (which I tend to believe myself). Overall, just a great trip down memory lane. To paraphrase Jim Ross' words, ""WITHOUT THE HORSEMEN, THERE WOULD'VE BEEN NO DX, NO DANGEROUS ALLIANCE AND THERE DAMN SURE WOULD'VE BEEN NO NWO!"" Get this to see the rise and fall of the ""symbol of excellence.""MINI-UPDATE:Recently, I read an article in Pro Wrestling Illustrated that WWE 24/7 has re-edited this piece due to their unoffical ""DON'T MENTION CHRIS BENOIT"" stance.As a result, however, the Brian Pillman part of the Horsemen saga is shortened and the chapters mentioning Steve McMichael, Jeff Jarrett and possibly the big reunion in 1998 in Greenville, SC have been removed! The DVD release, however, has not been recalled or re-edited yet so for those that want the history with no edits, I would DOUBLY RECOMMEND this release!

1038012,A1M5405JH9THP9,B000LC3III,golgotha.gov,"[8, 9]","RIC FLAIR AND THE FOUR HORSEMENactual documentary is a little over 2 hoursWow!  Or should I say... Wooo!  Like many others, I am a big fan of the Horsemen and have been for some time.  Due to the fact that the WWE had nothing to do with the legendary stable, I was almost certain that they would mess this DVD up, but to my surprise they delivered a quality product!  And yes I believe its still true: The Four Horsemen are the greatest wrestling stable of all time!The DVD starts off in the pre-Horsemen days, with Gene Anderson and Ole Anderson wrestling together as sibling tag team (the team actually predated Ole but maybe that's another DVD...).  Ole was joined by Arn Anderson, who was noticing the potential in a young man who we now know as Ric Flair.  Along with their ""sparkplug"" Tully Blanchard, the group joined to become the Four Horsemen and were managed by J.J. Dillon.  The group would famously isolate a certain body part (i.e.- leg, hand, whatever) and ""work on it"" to wear it down.  They were also known as much for their flamboyant lifestyles outside the ring as they were for their wrestling skills.  This led to a great combination of exciting interviews and classic arcs in the history of the NWA/WCW where each member held a belt (Ric- World champ, Arn and Tully- Tag champs, 2nd generation member Barry Windham- US champ) amounting to one of the greatest forces in the wrestling industry.In the way of history, this DVD has most of what you need to know.  Naturally we get a large segment dedicated to their historic feud against Magnum T.A. and Dusty Rhodes (another one of my favorite wrestling personalities), not to mention Ric Flair's ""open secret"" disgust with various WCW figureheads including Eric Bischoff.But part of why I like this DVD so much is it also devotes considerable time to some things that were just confusing as a fan.  For example what about the half-induction of Kendall Windham (Barry's brother) into the group, the brief selection of Hiro Matsuda as manager or the infamous ""3 Horsemen"" lineup with jobber Paul Roma?  You will also hear the Horsemen's thoughts on Lex Luger, Sting and the notorious incident between Arn and Psycho Sid.  I am a huge Brian Pillman fan and even though he wasn't as important as some of the other members, I was happy to see his inclusion on this DVD.  Finally we get to the late WCW version of the group with Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko and former Chicago Bear Steve ""Mongo"" McMichael.  The Curt Hennig/nWo angle is covered but after that point the ""story"" of the DVD kind of disintegrates as the final years of WCW were so fragmented and weird that nobody really knew if the Four Horsemen (or Flair's contract) were still in existence.It is true that Arn Anderson is in character for this DVD.  As a fan who grew up on 1980s wrestling, I like that.  Also it is clear that he is giving ""real"" answers when he needs to, for example when he comments on whether or not he took the nWo skit about him personally.  However, there are a couple points when a ""shoot"" response would've been nice, such as a better explanation about Ole's expulsion from the group.  For wrestling reviews, I normally include a list of matches referenced or included.  Its true that the shortage of some of the important matches may be the set's only shortcoming.  Well that and no recent footage of Ole (although that was probably more his doing that WWE's).The last thing I will say about this DVD is that I'm very happy that it didn't cover any of the WWE allusions to the Horsemen (like they did on the 'nWo: Back in Black'  DVD) and also  that somehow it didn't turn into a back-patting session for the McMahons ('Monday Night War' DVD).

It made me wish that WCW had just let the group go into the sunset instead on insisting on adding odd members and dragging the group out like it was just any other hodgepodge of guys.The DVD does an incredible job noting the switching of some horsemen from WCW to WWE and back.

Ric Flair speaks so honestly and candidly on thoughts of the various incarnations of the 4 Horsemen. I liked hearing what he had to say on Luger, Roma, and Bischoff, worth the price alone.The other thing I liked was hearing from Barry Windham, I always enjoyed his work. He was a Florida boy, when I used to live there. It was great to hear what he had to say, sad to see him get so heavy.Arn Anderson, and Tully were interesting. I was such a big fan of the horsemen back in the day, to go down memory lane and hear them talk about what was happening behind the scenes was awesome.

1038032,A1L7PH0CS9BHP6,B000LC3III,Tom,"[1, 1]","Long before the NWO,the Studd Stable, DX, Evolution and countless other super groups there was the 4 Horsemen.  It was around 1985 when 4 of the greatst stars of their era came together:  Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Tully Blanchard.  They added JJ Dillion and thus the Horsemen were born.  The first part of the DVD set that u get to see is the documentary on the group which details the formation of the group plus most if not all of the incarnations of the Horsemen.  So many awesome talents have been Horsemen and all are told in this set:  Sting and his subsequent forced removal from the group, Lex Luger, the very underrated Barry Windham, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, etc.  I did like how they explained the so called family ties with in the original members of the group which told that Arn, Ole and Flair were all cousins.  This is finally answered.  They do show when the Horsemen very viciously attacked Dusty Rhodes within a steel cage and ""broke"" his leg.  I remember at the time this was such a huge deal within the NWA.  They also like home video footage of the Horsemen attacking Dusty outside of some store or plumber place or something and breaking his arm.  Awesome stuff that we don't get to see today.  Of course they talk about Ole leaving the group and Luger joining.  I never got why they chose him but they did.  We also get some history in the War Games match as at one time this was considered the Horsemen's match.  They do talk about Barry Windham joing the group who in my opinion is just a fantastic member.  I think he was a perfect fit to the group and in a lot of people's opinions formed the best group of the Horsemen along with Tully, Arn and Flair.  Some people wonder why Ole isn't on the cover of this set and I think it's cuz of Barry being a more popular member and the fact that Ole is so hated within the wrestling community that it isn't funny.  Next they talk about Sting and his brief time within the Horsemen and his getting kicked out in one of the greatest moments in wrestling history.  They also talk about Sid and don't have a lot of good things to say about him.  They even talk about the hotel room/stabbing incident with Sid and Arn.  One of the funniest moments on this set is when the group for some unknown reason decided to add Paul Roma to the group.  You've just got to hear Roma and how full of himself he is.  I mean he basically says that he was good for the group cause he was so good looking he gave people something good to look at.  Give me a break!  We hear about Benoit being added and Pillman and then Mongo and then Dean Malenko and some others.  All in all just a great documentary.  I'm hoping that with the induction of the Horsemen in the hall of fam this year that this will lead to yet another dvd set of the Horsemen.  The extras were good and included Flair talking about the wildest night in the business, the footage of them attacking Dusty in that parking lot, a Barry Windham story on Lex Luger that is just funny as crap and some interviews plus more.  The matches were good as well and included:Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Ric Flair vs. Pez Whatley, the Italian Stallion and Rocky King from NWA tv 6/22/1985:  This was just your standard television match for that time period but it is cool to see the Anderson's and Flair together.Ric Flair vs. Ricky Morton from Great American Bash 7/5/1986 in a cage match:  Morton was a part of the Rock and Roll Express but has a beef with Flair cuz of his attack on Morton and breaking his nose.  Awesome match from start to finish (Ricky was really underrated and proved it in this match).  Of course there was blood and just some very exciting back and forth action from both.  It did look like at times that Ricky would pull this off and win the title but to no avail.  By the way, check out Flair's awesome entrance before the match.  Great one.Tully Blanchard vs. Dusty Rhodes from Starrcade 1986 11/27/1986 in a first blood match for the TV title:  This was a pretty good match but they would have better ones including some fantastic cage matches and a ladder/barbed wire from GAB 1987.  This match was good but we do see both guys wrestling fairly defensively due to the first blood stip in the match and I think this hindered what would have been a very good match.Four Horsemen vs. Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, Lex Luger, Steve Williams and Paul Ellering from Great American Bash 7/16/1988 in a War Games match:  This match was not near as good as some of the previous War Games matches that took place.  This match was conjured up by Dusty Rhodes and is still considered one of the most brutal matches of its kind.  I do think there is a misprint in the date for this match.  I think in 1988 there was only GAB event with Luger and Flair main eventing.  I thought this match took place at the Citrus Bowl in 1987 when the GAB went on a tour.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Anyway, this match is good but near as good as the first two that took place in 1987 on that tour.  Also there is on commentary for this one which normally doesn't bother me but I just think u need that in a War Games match.  Still plenty of action and blood for everyone.Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard vs. Sting and Nikita Koloff at Great American Bash 7/10/1988:  Great match with lots of back and forth action.  I have often felt that Blanchard and Anderson were very underrated as a tag team and just freaking brilliant to watch in the ring.  I know Shawn Michaels really loved to work with them when he was in the Rockers.  Anyhow great match here that goes to a 20 min time limit draw.  Oh if only they could have added just 10 more mins.Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard vs. Barry Windham and Lex Luger at Clash I for the NWA Tag titles 3/27/1988:  Awesome match and fantastic title change.  The fans are so into this one that it's hard not to get caught up in it.Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson at Fall Brawl 9/17/1995:  They said it wud never happen but it did and boy what a great wrestling match this was.  From start to finish these guys gave us everything they had and then some.  Most people do get pissed off because Brian Pillman interfered in the match and caused Flair to lose (I think most wanted to see a straight up match just to see who was truly better) but still this match is probably the best one they have on this set.All in all this is a great DVD set with a lot of classic matches and a great story about how the greatest super group of all time was created and ran rough shod over the NWA and WCW.  Could u just imagine what these guys could have done in the WWE back in the day?  Great set that will stand the test of time and as I stated earlier:  It wud be nice to see another Horsemen set come out with more interview, more footage of them attacking other wrestlers and more matches on it.  That wud just be great.  Get this set!

1038033,A3G3JZCV5RMCGS,B000LC3III,W. Gantt,"[4, 19]","A ""historical"" documentary on this Horsemen DVD seems as endless as Ric Flair's career. Flair and his fellow creaky wrestling comrades, Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, engage in self congratulatory stories about their questionable antics from another century that occurred both inside and outside the ring.  The DVD gives top billing to Flair who, most notoriously today, wrestles at an advanced age and attracts a mocking response from modern audiences when he appears at arenas in his sequined house robes (suitable attire for an old man) accented by an entrance theme from a stale science fiction movie. Flair, Anderson, and Blanchard are just as Has-Been as the ""2001"" anthem.  Finally, a Horseman of much younger vintage and with more true ring athleticism, Paul Roma, rescues the DVD and infuses it with life.  Roma stands his ground in the documentary against charges that he was not a team player from molding doughboys Flair and Anderson and their sycophant Triple H.  Roma rescued the Horsemen from antiquity in the Nineties and brought both class and renewed audience support to the decaying team. Evidently he did not subscribe to the Horsemen's frat boy rules of conduct, so now they try to punish him with their cheap shots in the documentary.  Triple H chimes in as the self proclaimed wrestling ""historian"" who conveniently forgets that Paul Roma was a solo powerhouse in the ring plus a member of championship tag teams The Young Stallions, Power and Glory, and Pretty Wonderful.  During his portion of the interview, Roma responds to the cheap shots with his own observations about his former colleagues that are more accurate and have the targeted power of one of his patented wrestling high kicks.  Bravo Roma!  The full star rating from this Amazon customer is exclusively for you.  You survived the Horsemen with your credibility and integrity intact.
