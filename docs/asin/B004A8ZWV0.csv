1391314,AU510CVD9XDG,B004A8ZWV0,"4Nbahu ""Free Book Hunter""","[0, 0]","I ordered this after watching a trailer, with such a star studded cast how could it not be wonderful.  The problem was I thought this was a story about a man coming out of the closet. When in fact it is a man learning how to be a man by watching how his father, recently out of the closet and diagnosed with cancer, lives out his last days.While some of my issues stem from wrong expectations, the other issues stem from the fact that many times I felt like I was watching this through a fog.  I felt that Oliver was emotionally numb due to his upbringing.  His mother knowingly married a closeted gay man, which led all of them to live a half life.This movie will not make you jump up with joy, as the father and son learn to face their futures, it is at times excruciating slow.  And as in life sometimes changes and wins come slowly and quietly, not with bands and whistles.The print was clear and the disk was not scratched.Regarding the extras, I enjoyed watching the extras.  Seeing the people that this story was loosely based upon made the story better for me.If you can handle a slow moving dramatic and at times humorous film, I recommend this.  However, if you need something to happen every 10.6 seconds or are looking for a gut laugh comedy wait until you are in the mood for something a bit deeper and then watch this.",3,"Beginners Starting Out Slow, but Like the Tortoise Comes Out a Winner.",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1332,"['ordered', 'watching', 'trailer', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'wonderful', 'problem', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'story', 'man', 'coming', 'closet', 'When', 'fact', 'man', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'man', 'watching', 'how', 'father', 'recently', 'closet', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'out', 'last', 'days.While', 'issues', 'stem', 'wrong', 'expectations', 'other', 'issues', 'stem', 'fact', 'many', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'fog', 'felt', 'Oliver', 'was', 'emotionally', 'numb', 'due', 'upbringing', 'mother', 'knowingly', 'married', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'led', 'live', 'half', 'life.This', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'jump', 'up', 'joy', 'father', 'son', 'learn', 'face', 'futures', 'times', 'excruciating', 'slow', 'life', 'sometimes', 'changes', 'come', 'slowly', 'quietly', 'not', 'bands', 'whistles.The', 'print', 'was', 'clear', 'disk', 'was', 'not', 'scratched.Regarding', 'extras', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'extras', 'Seeing', 'people', 'story', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'made', 'story', 'better', 'me.If', 'can', 'handle', 'slow', 'moving', 'dramatic', 'times', 'humorous', 'film', 'recommend', 'However', 'need', 'something', 'happen', '10.6', 'seconds', 'are', 'looking', 'gut', 'laugh', 'comedy', 'wait', 'are', 'mood', 'something', 'bit', 'deeper', 'then', 'watch']",N/A
1391315,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004A8ZWV0,A kids review,"[4, 5]","Partially based on writer/director Mike Mills' own father, Beginners is one of those smaller independent films that I liked but hardly anyone else I knew saw. Told primarily in various flashbacks, the film stars Ewan McGregor as thirty-something Oliver, whose father Hal comes out as a homosexual at age 75 after the passing of his wife and proceeds to live a full life as a gay man until his death. Oliver also meets a French actress named Anna, played by Melanie Laurent, who sparks those initial memories of Hal, and attempts to navigate his relationship with her with the same vigor Hal exhibited in his last years. I appreciate the film's multi-generational exploration of romance with wit and depth, even if it wore its heart on its sleeve. Though it might be a tad sentimental for some, I considere it a thoughtful delight, so if your interest is piqued, you might as well give it a shot.",4,Beginners,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,895,"['Partially', 'based', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'own', 'father', 'Beginners', 'one', 'smaller', 'independent', 'films', 'liked', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'else', 'knew', 'saw', 'Told', 'primarily', 'various', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'stars', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'thirty-something', 'Oliver', 'father', 'Hal', 'out', 'homosexual', 'age', '75', 'passing', 'wife', 'proceeds', 'live', 'full', 'life', 'gay', 'man', 'death', 'Oliver', 'also', 'French', 'actress', 'named', 'Anna', 'played', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'who', 'initial', 'memories', 'Hal', 'attempts', 'navigate', 'relationship', 'same', 'vigor', 'Hal', 'exhibited', 'last', 'years', 'appreciate', 'film', 'multi-generational', 'exploration', 'romance', 'wit', 'depth', 'even', 'wore', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'might', 'be', 'tad', 'sentimental', 'considere', 'thoughtful', 'delight', 'interest', 'piqued', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'shot']",N/A
1391316,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004A8ZWV0,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","I want everyone to go out and watch this movie now.  Honestly, this film is so powerful and moving and certainly far removed from anything I was expecting that mere words cannot convey how much I truly do adore this film.  From a purely emotional standpoint, it may be the finest film I've seen this year for it brought me to a place I haven't been in a long time; completely swelled within my own realities captured by someone and something else entirely.`Beginners' is beautiful.`Beginners' tells the story of Oliver.  Oliver is not a very lucky lover.  He hasn't had a stable relationship and quite frankly, he seems allergic to them.  His father has recently died, and he lives in a world consumed in beginning to understand who his father really was.  Shortly after his mother's passing, Oliver's father Hal came out of the closet.  Hal has been gay his whole life and yet he loved his wife and she wanted to `fix him', convinced that her love could do the trick.  He lived a heterosexual life with her, but now that she was gone he wanted to explore the life he kept locked away for so long.  This obviously took Oliver by surprise, but watching his father's eyes brighten and his soul open up he became to understand a sense of happiness he had never seen in his years growing up.  After losing his father, Oliver has a chance meeting with the beautiful Anna.  While he at first seems resistant, her charm and allure is too much for him, and soon Oliver finds himself experiencing something he didn't understand, but through memories of his father's growing spirit, Oliver is able to accept the gift he has been given.I'm just floored at the sincerity in this film's screenplay, for the way it fleshes out these characters is just amazing.  Oliver is sullen and lost yet completely consumed with this young woman who offers an answer to his apathetic sadness.  Ewan McGregor is outstanding in the role; finding such depth of emotion in those eyes.  Christopher Plummer is on his way to winning an Oscar, and rightfully so.  He delivers a fearless performance, one that is not only brave because of subject (is it really brave to play gay nowadays?) but because of the way he just jumps right in.  He builds a believable and grounded older man who is ecstatic to finally be living his life, even though he's at the end of it.  But, for me, this film was all about Melanie Laurent.  Her performance as Anna was so delightful, so soulful and full of sensual allure.  She played with McGregor with such flawless chemistry, and yet she understood the importance of driving it home when needed; and her breakdown after moving in with Oliver was so magically believable...so soft and understated in all the right ways.The beauty of `Beginners' comes from the way that it conveys its message with subtle touches and a real sense of being.  The idea that we can learn so much from our parents is a strong guiding light here.  Our parents help form who we become, whether in a good or bad way, but sometimes we miss out by disregarding their actions as not influential.  Hal's decision to be open with himself and those around him affected Oliver in ways unexpected, but their impact was revolutionary.  `Beginners' is, above all else, an ode to that bond between father and son; and yet there is more here that makes it even deeper and more effecting to those of us not sincerely attached to that aspect of the prose.  The fact that new beginnings are possible to those who make them is a compelling argument made here as well.  A friend of mine likes to use the phrase, ""it's not how you start but how you finish"" and I find that truth to be made so eminent in this beautiful film.To call this a masterpiece is truly a subjective thought, since a large part of why I adore this film is for personal reasons, but from an emotional perspective, `Beginners' gets everything right.",5,Let's start at the beginning...,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,3876,"['want', 'everyone', 'go', 'out', 'watch', 'movie', 'now', 'Honestly', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'moving', 'certainly', 'far', 'removed', 'anything', 'was', 'expecting', 'mere', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'convey', 'how', 'much', 'truly', 'do', 'adore', 'film', 'purely', 'emotional', 'standpoint', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'brought', 'place', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'completely', 'swelled', 'own', 'realities', 'captured', 'someone', 'something', 'else', 'entirely.', 'Beginners', 'beautiful.', 'Beginners', 'tells', 'story', 'Oliver', 'Oliver', 'not', 'very', 'lucky', 'lover', ""n't"", 'had', 'stable', 'relationship', 'quite', 'frankly', 'allergic', 'father', 'recently', 'died', 'world', 'consumed', 'beginning', 'understand', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'was', 'Shortly', 'mother', 'passing', 'Oliver', 'father', 'Hal', 'came', 'closet', 'Hal', 'been', 'gay', 'whole', 'life', 'yet', 'loved', 'wife', 'wanted', 'fix', 'convinced', 'love', 'could', 'do', 'trick', 'lived', 'heterosexual', 'life', 'now', 'was', 'gone', 'wanted', 'explore', 'life', 'kept', 'locked', 'away', 'so', 'long', 'obviously', 'took', 'Oliver', 'surprise', 'watching', 'father', 'eyes', 'brighten', 'soul', 'open', 'up', 'became', 'understand', 'sense', 'happiness', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'years', 'growing', 'up', 'losing', 'father', 'Oliver', 'chance', 'meeting', 'beautiful', 'Anna', 'first', 'resistant', 'charm', 'allure', 'too', 'much', 'soon', 'Oliver', 'experiencing', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'memories', 'father', 'growing', 'spirit', 'Oliver', 'able', 'accept', 'gift', 'been', 'given.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'floored', 'sincerity', 'film', 'screenplay', 'way', 'characters', 'just', 'amazing', 'Oliver', 'sullen', 'lost', 'yet', 'completely', 'consumed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'answer', 'apathetic', 'sadness', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'outstanding', 'role', 'finding', 'such', 'depth', 'emotion', 'eyes', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'way', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'rightfully', 'so', 'fearless', 'performance', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'brave', 'subject', 'really', 'brave', 'play', 'gay', 'nowadays', 'way', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'believable', 'grounded', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'ecstatic', 'finally', 'be', 'living', 'life', 'even', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'performance', 'Anna', 'was', 'so', 'delightful', 'so', 'soulful', 'full', 'sensual', 'allure', 'played', 'McGregor', 'such', 'flawless', 'chemistry', 'yet', 'understood', 'importance', 'driving', 'home', 'when', 'needed', 'breakdown', 'moving', 'Oliver', 'was', 'so', 'magically', 'believable', 'so', 'soft', 'understated', 'right', 'ways.The', 'beauty', 'Beginners', 'way', 'conveys', 'message', 'subtle', 'touches', 'real', 'sense', 'being', 'idea', 'can', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'parents', 'strong', 'guiding', 'light', 'here', 'parents', 'help', 'form', 'who', 'become', 'good', 'bad', 'way', 'sometimes', 'miss', 'out', 'disregarding', 'actions', 'not', 'influential', 'Hal', 'decision', 'be', 'open', 'affected', 'Oliver', 'ways', 'unexpected', 'impact', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'Beginners', 'else', 'ode', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'yet', 'more', 'here', 'even', 'deeper', 'more', 'effecting', 'not', 'sincerely', 'attached', 'aspect', 'prose', 'fact', 'new', 'beginnings', 'are', 'possible', 'who', 'make', 'compelling', 'argument', 'made', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'mine', 'likes', 'use', 'phrase', 'not', 'how', 'start', 'how', 'finish', 'find', 'truth', 'be', 'made', 'so', 'eminent', 'beautiful', 'film.To', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'truly', 'subjective', 'thought', 'large', 'part', 'why', 'adore', 'film', 'personal', 'reasons', 'emotional', 'perspective', 'Beginners', 'everything', 'right']",N/A
1391317,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B004A8ZWV0,Andy Orrock,"[8, 10]","My enthusiasm for this gem from Mike Mills is unbounded. I loved everything about it, from knowing that it springs from Mills' own life experiences, to its casting (Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer and M&eacute;lanie Laurent -- brilliant all), to the care with which Mills crafted his work (he's clearly an artist first), to the delightful surprises he embedded within his work (suddenly turning the screen over to the colors of the rainbow flag one by one is yet one dazzlingly original touch).  Always destined for the art house, it deserves a wider audience.Best and, for me, the most memorable scene among many: a costume party in which McGregor's character, Oliver, goes as Sigmund Freud.  Soon, in character, he's psychoanalyzing party guests.  Suddenly, a wordless M&eacute;lanie Laurent slides on to the couch.  Eyeing him, she turns the tables: ""Why are you so sad?"" she pens in quick note to him.  He's surprised: he thought he was fooling everyone.  Clearly, she's seen through it.  ""How did you know?"" he asks.  Another note: this one, simply a drawing of his sad eyes.  That scene - equal parts crafty, neat humor and sorrow - is emblematic of the film.  From Oliver's reaction, you know straight away that Laurent's Anna will become a very important person in his life.And that's not even getting to the heart of the movie: the tale of Oliver's father, Hal, his coming out in his late 70s, and the evolving relationship between father and son.  Hal's tale - and the tale of Mills' own father - is both heartbreaking for a life lost but, at the same time, uplifting for the spirit of grabbing what you can while there's still time left.  Christopher Plummer has never been better.  He looks and sounds terrific here.I listened to an interview with Ewan McGregor after the film was released.  He noted that he'd formed such a bond with 'Arthur' - his father's erstwhile Jack Russell Terrier - that he went 'looking for a replacement' after the film had ended.  [He adopted a poodle mix .]  That bond is clearly evident on the screen.",5,Mike Mills is clearly an artist -- 'Beginners' deserves a wider audience,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,2047,"['enthusiasm', 'gem', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'unbounded', 'loved', 'everything', 'knowing', 'Mills', 'own', 'life', 'experiences', 'casting', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'brilliant', 'care', 'Mills', 'crafted', 'work', 'clearly', 'artist', 'first', 'delightful', 'surprises', 'embedded', 'work', 'suddenly', 'turning', 'screen', 'colors', 'rainbow', 'flag', 'one', 'one', 'yet', 'one', 'dazzlingly', 'original', 'touch', 'Always', 'destined', 'art', 'house', 'wider', 'audience.Best', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'many', 'costume', 'party', 'McGregor', 'character', 'Oliver', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Soon', 'character', 'psychoanalyzing', 'party', 'guests', 'Suddenly', 'wordless', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'slides', 'couch', 'Eyeing', 'tables', 'Why', 'are', 'sad', 'quick', 'note', 'surprised', 'thought', 'was', 'fooling', 'everyone', 'Clearly', 'seen', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'note', 'one', 'simply', 'drawing', 'sad', 'eyes', 'scene', 'equal', 'parts', 'crafty', 'neat', 'humor', 'sorrow', 'emblematic', 'film', 'Oliver', 'reaction', 'know', 'straight', 'away', 'Laurent', 'Anna', 'will', 'become', 'very', 'important', 'person', 'life.And', 'not', 'even', 'getting', 'heart', 'movie', 'tale', 'Oliver', 'father', 'Hal', 'coming', 'out', 'late', '70s', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'Hal', 'tale', 'tale', 'Mills', 'own', 'father', 'heartbreaking', 'life', 'lost', 'same', 'time', 'uplifting', 'spirit', 'grabbing', 'what', 'can', 'still', 'time', 'left', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'terrific', 'here.I', 'listened', 'interview', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'noted', ""'d"", 'formed', 'bond', ""'Arthur"", 'father', 'erstwhile', 'Jack', 'Russell', 'Terrier', 'went', ""'looking"", 'replacement', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'adopted', 'poodle', 'mix', ']', 'bond', 'clearly', 'evident', 'screen']",N/A

Dad left behind his Jack Russell terrier, Arthur (who provides comic relief with his profound thoughts appearing as subtitles throughout the film), and his much younger boyfriend (Goran Visnjic).Oliver's current story is told with frequent flashbacks to his childhood (where it was obvious to him that there was emotional detachment between his parents, though he had no idea why at the time) as well as his father's exploits after embracing his gay self.

And when, and why, after so many years, do  we begin to be our true self again? These questions are asked and answered in Mike Mills' autobiographical film ""Beginners.""Oliver Fields (Ewan McGregor;, playing a film variation of Mills himself) is a graphic designer who can't seem to communicate his feelings or maintain  a long-term emotional relationship. Oliver, though not verbally expressive or emotionally demonstrative, does express his emotions through graphic design and illustration.  The movie flashes back into the past and flashes forward again into the present or more recent past. As we see Oliver's relationship with his parents, we see how he became so emotionally conditioned. His parents endured a distant 45 year marriage, in an environment where emotions and secrets were never revealed. After his mother's  (Mary Page Keller)  death, his 75 year old father Hal (Christopher Plummer; ""Hamlet,"" ""The Sound Of Music"", ""Inside Man"") finally comes out of the closet as a gay man. ""And I don't want to be just theoretically gay,"" he says, ""I want to do something about it."" And, in the final years of his life, Hal embraces his life with gusto and passion ; becoming an active member of the gay community and having a loving relationship with a much younger man (Goran Visnjig). In the last years of his life, Hal finally begins to be his true self, and Oliver finally begins to know and love the father that he never knew before. In the end, Hal refuses to acknowledge the cancer that will end the life he has just begun to live.In the present day, inspired by his father's example, Oliver decides to embark upon a relationship with the beguiling and seemingly free-spirited Anna (Melanie Laurent). Interestingly, in a movie filled with characters who can't communicate on one level or another, when Oliver and Anna first meet, she has laringytis and, therefore, cannot speak. Turns out, Anna also has issues concerning her distant father.  In a sweet touch, an adorable dog named Arthur serves as the emotional connection between all the characters, past and present, dead or alive, here.Christopher Plummer's deservedly award-winning performance is a subtle but wonderful revelation. You can see the twinkle in his eyes, you can feel his joy, when he finally embraces his true self. In many ways, Oliver is just as full of child-like wonder and astonishment in his relationship with Anna as his father was when he came out of the closet. I am thrilled that Plummer received awards, but I wish Ewan McGregor's equally heartfelt performance and Mike Mills' beautiful  screenplay, had also received the same recognition. But, regardless of awards, ""Beginners"" is a warm and human film; to be cherished.",5,"WHEN, AND HOW, DO WE BEGIN TO BE OUR TRUE SELF?",1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,2763,"['When', 'do', 'stop', 'being', 'true', 'self', 'why', 'when', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'do', 'begin', 'be', 'true', 'self', 'again', 'questions', 'are', 'asked', 'answered', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'Beginners', 'Oliver', 'Fields', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'playing', 'film', 'variation', 'Mills', 'graphic', 'designer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'communicate', 'feelings', 'maintain', 'long-term', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'Oliver', 'not', 'verbally', 'expressive', 'emotionally', 'demonstrative', 'express', 'emotions', 'graphic', 'design', 'illustration', 'movie', 'back', 'past', 'flashes', 'forward', 'again', 'present', 'more', 'recent', 'past', 'see', 'Oliver', 'relationship', 'parents', 'see', 'how', 'became', 'so', 'emotionally', 'conditioned', 'parents', 'endured', 'distant', '45', 'year', 'marriage', 'environment', 'where', 'emotions', 'secrets', 'were', 'never', 'revealed', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Page', 'Keller', 'death', '75', 'year', 'old', 'father', 'Hal', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Hamlet', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Man', 'finally', 'closet', 'gay', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'just', 'theoretically', 'gay', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'final', 'years', 'life', 'Hal', 'life', 'gusto', 'passion', 'becoming', 'active', 'member', 'gay', 'community', 'having', 'loving', 'relationship', 'much', 'younger', 'man', 'Goran', 'Visnjig', 'last', 'years', 'life', 'Hal', 'finally', 'be', 'true', 'self', 'Oliver', 'finally', 'know', 'love', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'end', 'Hal', 'acknowledge', 'cancer', 'will', 'end', 'life', 'just', 'begun', 'live.In', 'present', 'day', 'inspired', 'father', 'example', 'Oliver', 'embark', 'relationship', 'beguiling', 'seemingly', 'free-spirited', 'Anna', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'Interestingly', 'movie', 'filled', 'characters', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'one', 'level', 'when', 'Oliver', 'Anna', 'first', 'meet', 'laringytis', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'out', 'Anna', 'also', 'issues', 'concerning', 'distant', 'father', 'sweet', 'touch', 'adorable', 'dog', 'named', 'Arthur', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'past', 'present', 'dead', 'alive', 'Plummer', 'deservedly', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'subtle', 'wonderful', 'revelation', 'can', 'see', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'can', 'feel', 'joy', 'when', 'finally', 'true', 'self', 'many', 'ways', 'Oliver', 'just', 'full', 'child-like', 'wonder', 'astonishment', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'father', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'closet', 'am', 'thrilled', 'Plummer', 'received', 'awards', 'wish', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'equally', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'beautiful', 'screenplay', 'had', 'also', 'received', 'same', 'recognition', 'regardless', 'awards', 'Beginners', 'warm', 'human', 'film', 'be', 'cherished']",N/A

1391332,A3TKLTWVLB43XQ,B004A8ZWV0,"DukeD1989 ""Film Buff""","[4, 6]","I honestly cannot think of another film I have seen this year that I found as charming and heartfelt as `Beginners' which stars Ewan McGregor as Oliver, a middle aged man who has just lost his father Hal to lung cancer. Oliver reveals to us, through narration, that after the death of his mother a few years back his father came out, having been gay throughout the 40 plus years of his marriage. Oliver's life following his father's passing is a lonely one that often leads to him talking to Arthur, his father's dog. One night at a party he meets a beautiful actress named Anna. The two hit it off quickly and the rest of the film follows the development of their relationship, set among flashbacks of Oliver's parents and his father's new life as a gay man in the years before his death. Through these memories we get a better understanding, as to why Oliver has been alone, and why his time with Anna may be short lived; he has had 4 relationships in the past, but left them all. The result is a film about being open and honest, and finding love and happiness through from it.This idea of being honest was difficult for Oliver because of his parents. Their hollow marriage cast a shadow on his view of love. Wanting to avoid what they had created, this constant uncertainty and sadness caused him to think love was doomed and so he would break relationships off in fear of what he thought was their inevitable conclusion.Luckily Oliver is able to find inspiration in his father who was able to be open and honest in the final months of his life. Through the memories of Hal, Oliver is able to take those steps towards true joy. One reason being that when he found out his father was gay it finally dawned on him why his parents' marriage seemed so empty. It wasn't genuine and so not a good example of how things really are. Which brings up another important theme, that being change and starting over.The title `Beginners' refers to both Oliver and Hal being at the beginning of their new respective lives. Anna points out towards the end of the film, after reading a funny but sweet personal ad Hal had made, that Oliver's father ""Didn't give up"". Even facing death, in his 70's, Hal wanted to be happy and be himself by embracing his sexuality. It is in remembering these moments, seeing how happy his father was, that Oliver is able to look forward in a positive light, with a new perspective on love and an understanding of why his mother was always so sad. Oliver too has a new beginning and like Hal can now be open and embrace his love for Anna.What held this whole story together for me were the characters, and more importantly the chemistry between them. I felt the dynamic between Anna and Oliver, the feelings and time they shared was incredibly sweet. Upon first seeing him Anna instantly recognized Oliver's sadness. She too felt alone, having spent most of the past few years going from one hotel room to another. It is the sort of relationship in which the one thing that makes the love between them so poignant is that they can save each other, filling the voids in each other's hearts. This makes it harder to watch as Oliver's misconceptions on love cause a divide between them. At the beginner Oliver worries, like he did in his previous relationships, where this one is heading. He fears Anna will become his mother, unhappy and bitter. But when Oliver does change, and get her back, the result is an incredibly sweet ending.All of this is done with a collection of small, genuine and heartfelt moments that build upon one another to form something much greater. On top of that were three wonderful performances. Christopher Plummer was so lovable as Hal, and clearly had a lot of fun with the character. Melanie Laurent was mesmerizing and sweet, she is so beautiful and easy to fall for. Ewan McGregor was also fantastic, and the real stand out here, carrying a great deal of pain adding depth to his performance in a way I've rarely seen him do. The structure and visual devices also worked incredibly well, helping to give it a unique feel. I really loved the use of photographs, montages to the 50's and how it handled the history of the gay rights movement. The music was also lovely and fit the tone perfectly. It is a score that I've listened to a few times since watching the film.Honestly, it had me smiling from start to finish. It just had this emotional resonance that clicked for me in a way that can hardly be explained. I ended up watching it two nights in a row just because I loved it so much the first time and I just wanted to watch the characters again soon after. It saddens me that so few people seemed to have seen it. I can easily say that `Beginners' is a charming, smart, funny, sentimental and quirky film, one of my new favorites and I loved every single moment of it.",5,Genuine and Heartfelt,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,4823,"['honestly', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'found', 'charming', 'heartfelt', 'Beginners', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Oliver', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'Hal', 'lung', 'cancer', 'reveals', 'narration', 'death', 'mother', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'father', 'came', 'out', 'having', 'been', 'gay', '40', 'years', 'marriage', 'Oliver', 'life', 'following', 'father', 'passing', 'lonely', 'one', 'often', 'talking', 'Arthur', 'father', 'dog', 'One', 'night', 'party', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'named', 'Anna', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'quickly', 'rest', 'film', 'development', 'relationship', 'set', 'flashbacks', 'Oliver', 'parents', 'father', 'new', 'life', 'gay', 'man', 'years', 'death', 'memories', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'Oliver', 'been', 'alone', 'why', 'time', 'Anna', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'lived', 'had', '4', 'relationships', 'past', 'left', 'result', 'film', 'being', 'open', 'honest', 'finding', 'love', 'happiness', 'it.This', 'idea', 'being', 'honest', 'was', 'difficult', 'Oliver', 'parents', 'hollow', 'marriage', 'cast', 'shadow', 'view', 'love', 'Wanting', 'avoid', 'what', 'had', 'created', 'constant', 'uncertainty', 'sadness', 'caused', 'think', 'love', 'was', 'doomed', 'so', 'would', 'break', 'relationships', 'fear', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.Luckily', 'Oliver', 'able', 'find', 'inspiration', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'open', 'honest', 'final', 'months', 'life', 'memories', 'Hal', 'Oliver', 'able', 'take', 'steps', 'towards', 'true', 'joy', 'One', 'reason', 'being', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'father', 'was', 'gay', 'finally', 'dawned', 'why', 'parents', 'marriage', 'seemed', 'so', 'empty', 'was', ""n't"", 'genuine', 'so', 'not', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'Which', 'up', 'important', 'theme', 'being', 'change', 'starting', 'over.The', 'title', 'Beginners', 'refers', 'Oliver', 'Hal', 'being', 'beginning', 'new', 'respective', 'lives', 'Anna', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'reading', 'funny', 'sweet', 'personal', 'ad', 'Hal', 'had', 'made', 'Oliver', 'father', 'Did', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'Even', 'facing', 'death', '70', 'Hal', 'wanted', 'be', 'happy', 'be', 'embracing', 'sexuality', 'remembering', 'moments', 'seeing', 'how', 'happy', 'father', 'was', 'Oliver', 'able', 'look', 'forward', 'positive', 'light', 'new', 'perspective', 'love', 'understanding', 'why', 'mother', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'sad', 'Oliver', 'too', 'new', 'beginning', 'Hal', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'open', 'embrace', 'love', 'Anna.What', 'held', 'whole', 'story', 'together', 'were', 'characters', 'more', 'importantly', 'chemistry', 'felt', 'dynamic', 'Anna', 'Oliver', 'feelings', 'time', 'shared', 'was', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'first', 'seeing', 'Anna', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'Oliver', 'sadness', 'too', 'felt', 'alone', 'having', 'spent', 'most', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'going', 'one', 'hotel', 'room', 'sort', 'relationship', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'so', 'poignant', 'can', 'save', 'other', 'filling', 'voids', 'other', 'hearts', 'harder', 'watch', 'Oliver', 'misconceptions', 'love', 'cause', 'divide', 'beginner', 'Oliver', 'did', 'previous', 'relationships', 'where', 'one', 'heading', 'Anna', 'will', 'become', 'mother', 'unhappy', 'bitter', 'when', 'Oliver', 'change', 'get', 'back', 'result', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'ending.All', 'done', 'collection', 'small', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'build', 'one', 'form', 'something', 'much', 'greater', 'top', 'were', 'three', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'was', 'so', 'lovable', 'Hal', 'clearly', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'character', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'sweet', 'so', 'beautiful', 'easy', 'fall', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'was', 'also', 'fantastic', 'real', 'stand', 'here', 'carrying', 'great', 'deal', 'pain', 'adding', 'depth', 'performance', 'way', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'do', 'structure', 'visual', 'devices', 'also', 'worked', 'incredibly', 'well', 'helping', 'give', 'unique', 'feel', 'really', 'loved', 'use', 'photographs', 'montages', '50', 'how', 'handled', 'history', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'lovely', 'fit', 'tone', 'perfectly', 'score', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'few', 'times', 'watching', 'film.Honestly', 'had', 'smiling', 'start', 'finish', 'just', 'had', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'clicked', 'way', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'explained', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'two', 'nights', 'row', 'just', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'wanted', 'watch', 'characters', 'again', 'soon', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'seemed', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'Beginners', 'charming', 'smart', 'funny', 'sentimental', 'quirky', 'film', 'one', 'new', 'favorites', 'loved', 'single', 'moment']",N/A

1391334,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004A8ZWV0,Ed Uyeshima,"[71, 78]","There's an emotional acuity to this bittersweet 2011 dramedy that makes the loose structure of the first-person narrative easier to take than one would expect. Director/screenwriter Mike Mills bases his movie on a series of events that occurred in his own life. Just months after Mills' own mother passed away, his 75-year-old father announced that despite their 44-year marriage he was gay and intended to spend his remaining days exploring the hidden side of his libido. Cancer cut short those plans but not the life affirming spirit with which he explored his new lifestyle. It certainly helps that Mills cast 81-year-old Christopher Plummer as the father since his naturally erudite manner complements his character Hal's innately fey quality in a way that makes his late-blooming emotional emancipation all the sweeter. It's a lovely performance well worth remembering during next year's award season.The protagonist of the story is Oliver, a sensitive cartoonist who is nearing forty and finding himself unable to sustain a lasting relationship. Family dysfunction has taken its toll on Oliver given that he discovers six months after his mother Georgia's death that Hal was in the closet most of Oliver's life, thus explaining why his parents never appeared to connect emotionally. Oliver is obviously concerned a similar fate of repressed feelings will befall him as he rummages through Hal's things after his death. Flashbacks show a childhood dominated by Georgia's eccentric manner with Hal relegated to the shadows of doorways always on his way to another business trip. Meanwhile, closer to the present, Oliver meets a free-spirited French actress named Anna, whose flirtatious manner gives way to her own vulnerability since she has her own family-related challenges in developing romantic connections. Mills intertwines his characters' destinies with the unwieldy nature of life in all its familiarity. There is little one could call pat and predictable in this film.As Oliver, Ewan McGregor (last seen in the underratedThe Ghost Writer) has never come across more comfortably onscreen, making it easy to empathize with his plight without the contrivance of standard Hollywood convention.

Mike Mills is definitely old enough to know better, so it's hard for me to understand how he could have written a script that sounded like it came from the mind of a 12-year-old.The story could have been interesting. Oliver Fields (Ewan McGregor) is a single man approaching middle age whose father, at age 75, had just come out of the closet. The film is basically Oliver's reflections on his childhood, going back and forth in time to early childhood with his lovely, but lonely, mother, to adulthood with his dying, but happy, father. It is clear that although Oliver has not formed any lasting relationship, he, like both his unfulfilled parents, longs for intimacy without quite knowing how to achieve it. Hence the title.Although the film was cute, and nicely organized, it fell short of the one goal it had set for itself: to show that love is possible even amongst those who haven't the faintest idea of how to go about getting (or giving) it. Why were Oliver and Anna together? We have no idea what they saw in each other. Neither seemed to have a job, or any mutual interests, and aside from walking backwards in a park, and playing with the dog, they didn't seem to share any activities other than ... well, you know. And even that was on the bland side. Oliver's father, who is admirably played by Christopher Plummer, is the only character who seemed to have any depth. The rest are rather shallow versions of what Hollywood has historically deemed to be quirky, but lovable idiots. The girl is a mixed-up French type. The guy is a clueless, scruffy, sad-eyed type. The father's lover is a clown. The dog is a Jack Russell terrier.It's a pity that this film ended up missing the boat.

1391339,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004A8ZWV0,Grady Harp,"[9, 12]","BEGINNERS is an apt title for this quiet, gentle, loving film created by writer/director Mike Mills. It is so refreshing when films of this caliber take on controversial (to some) subject matter and instead of bandstanding the issues, elect to weave them in and out of a tapestry of a story about how we each find our identity and satisfy our need of love in a world not always conducive to emotional 'beginners'.The film opens in 2003. 38 year old graphic designer Oliver (Ewan McGregor) has just lost his father Hal (Christopher Plummer) to stage IV lung cancer. Hal is alone - his mother Georgia (Mary Page Keller) - died from cancer five years ago.  Oliver packs his father's belongings, comes across Hal's correspondence which he saves, and takes possession of Hal's Jack Russell terrier, and attempts to go about his life as a flailing designer.  His sole friend Elliot (Kai Lennox) tries to pry Oliver from his intense fear of intimacy by taking Oliver, costumed as Sigmund Freud, to a Halloween party where Oliver, behind the protective disguise as Freud can sit by a couch and offer 'therapy' to the party guests. One of those guests is Anna (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) who has laryngitis and therefore must communicate with Oliver's Freud by means of a little tablet and pencil (Anna's equal fear of intimacy shield).  Some sparks unite and Oliver and Anna begin a tenuous relationship.  Oliver shares his father's death, but more important he shares his father's life: when Georgia died, Hal came out as a gay man at age 75 and plunged into his new life with gusto, finding a lover named Andy (Goran Visnjic) and found happiness being his true self - sharing all of this with Oliver who was completely accepting of his father's beginning.  The scenes describing his father and his mother are presented as flashbacks as Oliver explains his history to Anna.  And we soon realize that Hal's love of life as a gay man influences Oliver to try intimacy  - and the traveling actress Anna shares her own fears of intimacy as they explore their growing relationship.One of the innumerable joys of this film is how Mike Mills uses the ever-present adorable dog (even giving us dog thoughts in subtitles as the story develops!) who is able to relate to all of the characters - Hal, Andy, Oliver, Elliot, Anna - in a rather exemplary manner! The scenes between Oliver as a young boy (Keegan Boos) with both Hal and Georgia are very touching: Georgia knows of Hal's sexuality and accepts it, except since Hal is not Jewish and Georgia is she explains to young Oliver that is why Hal is not more passionate!  The influence of Hal on Oliver in Hal's final months encourages Oliver to seek a truly meaningful relationship - and that is where the story leaves us - wondering if Oliver and Anna have that beginning.Ewan McGregor gives his best performance yet and Christopher Plummer finds just the right level of humor and angst to make us love his character completely.  The entire cast is excellent.  The film is accompanied by a genteel musical score by Roger Neill, Dave Palmer and Brian Reitzell.  But it is to the ultimate credit of Mike Mills for writing and directing this little masterpiece about human relations.  It is enriching to see; it deserves to be nominated as best film of the year.

This little fellow, who is in practically every scene, steals the show, hands down.  ""Beginners"" had received a lot of publicity so perhaps I was expecting too much from it. Starring  Christoper Plummer and Ewan McGregor and written and directed by Mike Mills, it is all about a father and a son, a father  who comes out at 75 as a gay man after his wife of many years has died and a son who has had four failed relationships and is seeking another, this time with Melanie Laurent. As I watched this too-long film, I kept wondering what the man's problem was. If you are into women, surely Laurent is the one.There are many good things about this film, however, even if the sum is not as good as the parts. All three actors, two-legged that is, are good even if they cannot compete with their four-legged competition.  Plummer is perfect as a man in his seventies who has  spent many years not able to live his life as he wanted. His tragic story is that of many gay men of his generation whose better choice of  bad ones seemed to be marriage. He loved his wife and was honest with her when they married. She thought she  could change him. Sound familiar?  His relationship with his accepting son is always moving. McGregor has the uncanny ability to play many different parts and never appear to be Ewan McGregor, at least to me.I suppose we are to compare and contrast Plummer's quest for love at his age with that of his son. He is much better at it. Even the dog cannot figure why McGregor cannot move off  his dime. The film goes back and forth between the present, the recent past when Plummer was late-blooming as a gay man--joining Prime-timers, a group for older gay men,  watching ""The Times of Harvey Milk,"" getting involved in gay rights--some of the footage will break your heart--and the distant past when we see his quirky wife.I believe this quiet little film would grow on you on a second viewing.

Their relationship (somewhat puzzled, though loving, on Oliver's side) and Hal's happy embrace of his new-found, though brief, freedom is seen in flashbacks. In the present (actually 2003) Oliver is closing his father's house, adopting his Jack Russell terrier (who has as charming a screen presence as any of the human actors), and hesitantly embarking on a relationship with Anna (M&eacute;lanie Laurent), an actress as wary of emotional commitment as he is. Occasionally there are even more distant flashbacks to Oliver's childhood, where the viewer gets glimpses of his witty, unhappy mother as well.Besides the non-linear time frame, ""Beginners"" employs other cinematic devices that seem intended to create distance from the heavy emotions that could be engendered by this narrative: spoken narration, whimsical samples of Oliver's work and even subtitles for a dog's imagined thoughts. Director Mike Mills is skillful enough to keep the effects from becoming too cute; in fact, he manages to draw a parallel between the viewer's enforced detachment and the characters' difficulties in acknowledging their true desires and emotions. He is helped by an excellent cast, headed by the estimable Christopher Plummer, whose presence is so compelling that it has the unfortunate side effect of making the events after his character's death seem less interesting. (Goran Visnjic of ""ER"" fame, looking a bit long in the tooth, has some nice scenes as Hal's lover.) Also, the course of Oliver's and Anna's bumpy romance is not particularly well-charted; one moment they're happy and moving in together, the next they are broken up. Still, Plummer's presence and the screen charisma of McGregor and Laurent lift ""Beginners"" and make it an engaging, and ultimately gripping experience. The DVD adds a brief, not particularly relevatory black-and-white documentary about the making of the film in addition to the usual trailers and voice-over commentaries by the director.",4,"A parent, a child, and their loves",1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,2276,"['Beginners', 'tells', 'chronologically', 'fluid', 'fashion', 'story', 'Oliver', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'graphic', 'artist', 'mourning', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'Hal', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'gay', 'man', 'seventies', 'forty-four', 'years', 'marriage', 'only', 'discover', 'had', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'soon', 'afterward', 'relationship', 'somewhat', 'puzzled', 'loving', 'Oliver', 'side', 'Hal', 'happy', 'embrace', 'new-found', 'brief', 'freedom', 'seen', 'flashbacks', 'present', 'actually', '2003', 'Oliver', 'closing', 'father', 'house', 'adopting', 'Jack', 'Russell', 'terrier', 'who', 'as', 'charming', 'screen', 'presence', 'human', 'actors', 'hesitantly', 'embarking', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'actress', 'wary', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'Occasionally', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'distant', 'flashbacks', 'Oliver', 'childhood', 'where', 'viewer', 'glimpses', 'witty', 'unhappy', 'mother', 'non-linear', 'time', 'frame', 'Beginners', 'other', 'cinematic', 'devices', 'seem', 'intended', 'create', 'distance', 'heavy', 'emotions', 'could', 'be', 'engendered', 'narrative', 'spoken', 'narration', 'whimsical', 'samples', 'Oliver', 'work', 'even', 'subtitles', 'dog', 'imagined', 'thoughts', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'skillful', 'enough', 'keep', 'effects', 'becoming', 'too', 'cute', 'fact', 'draw', 'parallel', 'viewer', 'enforced', 'detachment', 'characters', 'difficulties', 'acknowledging', 'true', 'desires', 'emotions', 'helped', 'excellent', 'cast', 'headed', 'estimable', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'presence', 'so', 'compelling', 'unfortunate', 'side', 'effect', 'making', 'events', 'character', 'death', 'seem', 'less', 'interesting', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'ER', 'fame', 'looking', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'nice', 'scenes', 'Hal', 'lover', 'Also', 'course', 'Oliver', 'Anna', 'bumpy', 'romance', 'not', 'particularly', 'well-charted', 'one', 'moment', ""'re"", 'happy', 'moving', 'together', 'next', 'are', 'broken', 'up', 'Still', 'Plummer', 'presence', 'screen', 'charisma', 'McGregor', 'Laurent', 'lift', 'Beginners', 'make', 'engaging', 'ultimately', 'gripping', 'experience', 'DVD', 'brief', 'not', 'particularly', 'relevatory', 'black-and-white', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'addition', 'usual', 'trailers', 'voice-over', 'commentaries', 'director']",N/A

Mills combines his memories of his father's last years with a parallel love story in the life of Oliver (Ewan MacGregor), a Los Angeles graphic designer in his late 30s with a string of failed relationships behind him. A few months after his father dies, Oliver meets Anna (M&eacute;lanie Laurent), a French actress who is in LA for a job. Oliver and Anna hit it off, and we see the last years of Oliver's father Hal's (Christopher Plummer) life unfold in flashback as his relationship with Anna grows. We also get a glimpse of Oliver's relationship with his mother (Mary Page Keller) when he was a boy.The film examines a number of relationships: Oliver and Anna, Oliver and Hal, Oliver and his mother, and Hal and his much younger boyfriend Andy (Goran Visnji'). Of these, I found Oliver's mother and father the most interesting, but that is probably to be expected, considering they are the most personal to the director. I wish we saw more of Oliver's neglected, frustrated mother, as Mary Page Keller gives a stand-out performance in this small role. It's interesting to compare the neurotic behavior of the younger generation to the reserved acceptance of the older generation as well. ""Beginners"" runs longer than it should due to unnecessary scenes, but it has an honesty that ""relationship movies"" usually don't, and the cast and characters are appealing.The DVD (Universal 2011): There are two featurettes and an audio commentary. ""A Short Film about Making Beginners"" (14 min) is in black-and-white and includes interviews with Mike Mills, the cast, and behind-the-scenes footage. ""Beginners Promo"" (1 min) is a very short film illustrating the history of love with black-and-white sketches. The audio commentary by writer/director Mike Mills is constant and informative. He compares the characters in the film to his own parents, discusses lighting, score, the actors, the film's emotions, and technical details. It's not strictly a scene-by-scene commentary, but it is a personal one. Subtitles are available fro the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French.

Oleson,"[2, 2]","Most of the noise surrounding this little film centers around a possible supporting Oscar nod for Christopher Plummer as Hal, the 75 year old father of Oliver played equally well by Ewan McGregor.  A couple years after Oliver's mother died, Hal comes down with lung cancer and it is inoperable.  That shock follows Hals's gay announcement once his wife had died.  This really is a secondary plot however.  Oliver, it seems has had no success at love which he has now concluded was because he wasn't given proper guidance when growing up.  After all, how could a gay father offer advice to a son who wants to chase women?At a costume party he meets and falls for a beautiful young actress (gorgeous Melanie Laurent, ""Inglorious Basterds"").  She too has had her romantic failures and the two of them tippy-toe around their hopeful connection.  This pairing and their growing relationship are artfully portrayed by the actors who do have real chemistry.The film jumps around between multiple time periods in Oliver's life including a prelude to those sections where director Mike Mills has Oliver narrate a series of photos of the time and what they represent.  One of the best additions to the film is subtitled text of what Arthur, a Jack Russell terrier, is thinking.  This only happens a few times throughout the film, but it's very witty and unexpected.  Recognizing time constraints, I wish we could have seen more of Oliver's mother Georgia (Mary Page Keller), a slightly off kilter art director.  She was the most interesting character in the film and Ms. Keller gives her a real identity even in her brief scenes.  This is a wonderful film, full of surprises and great performances.The Blu ray transfer is solid and looks great.  The film comes with a DTS HD soundtrack that is mostly upfront where it belongs.

There is a love story with flashbacks of the life and death of his father peppered throughout the film. There are cool little personal touches to the film which I loved.

The filmmaker appears not to know how to put together a movie except as a pastiche of clever but repetitive slide shows, screen tricks, voiceovers, a mugging dog, mooning faces, an absurdly miscast and misdirected Goran Visnjic, tinkly piano music, arbitrary scenes irrelevant to the story, and random flashbacks. The boy-girl love story is completely unbelievable and distracts from any true feeling the movie intended. It's got to be one of Plummer's worst career choices, since his coming out and his character are 2-dimensional at best, and are never dramatized.

1391361,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B004A8ZWV0,RMurray847,"[21, 28]","BEGINNERS has many nice elements to it, and it is a sweet movie overall.  But it is also very uneven and frustrating too.The essential concept is what interested me (that and the actors) in watching this.  A son (Ewan McGregor), well into his thirties and still quite single, has to grapple with the death of his mother, followed closely by the announcement from his father (Christopher Plummer) that he is gay and intends to start enjoying an open, gay lifestyle.  And not long after, the father develops cancer and is gone all too soon.  I'm not spoiling anything, because we learn all this in the opening moments of the film, which is a series of intertwining flashbacks.  One series shows the young boy experiencing his home life growing up with a distant father and a moody, unhappy mother.  The other shows him observing how happy and generous and open his father has become once out of the closet.  And the last shows his father's last days...when the old man was still warm, funny and open.  Finally, mixed in with the flashbacks are scenes of a developing romance between McGregor and Anna, an actress and ""free spirit"" (Melanie Laurent, so wonderful in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS).Plummer is fantastic in the film, and the Oscar talk is certainly deserved.  When Plummer was younger (back in the SOUND OF MUSIC DAYS)...I don't think he was a very good actor.  Stiff and cold.  In his old age, he's given some marvelous performances.  It's as though he no longer worries about how he looks and just lets himself BE and DO whatever the part calls for.  Ironically, even though he's in his `80s, he comes off more virile and passionate now than he ever did 40 years ago.  And even though the costume designer thinks all old, gay men wear ridiculous scarf-type thingies...he pulls of his free-wheelin' gay lifestyle with wonderful grace.  He is making up for decades of lost time, and boy, does he give it his all, this man.  Parties, clubs, boyfriends, and fun.  And he finally is able to develop a close relationship with his son.  He has the love in his life that he always truly craved, and doesn't have to hold back for anyone.McGregor handles these scenes very well.  He's perplexed by dad, but also moved by his stories of being in the closet and arranging secret rendezvous with other men.  He's angry at what his dad put his mom through...but he's also moved by the joy his father now experiences.  And he does very well in the scenes with his dad at the end nears.But the romance scenes with Laurent don't work so well.  First of all, Melanie Laurent is a glowing actress, but her English is quite hard to understand.  The pillow talk between these two is almost one sided, because I could so seldom understand her whispers.  Her character is also quite unbelievable.  She's a successful enough actress, apparently, to be put up in a huge luxury suite at a luxury hotel...yet she has lots and lots of time to gallivant around with McGregor, never needing to be on set, apparently, and never being recognized by anyone.  She is more of an ""idea"" from the scriptwriter than a real person.  Again, Laurent is not the problem...the fact that English is not her language and the character isn't believable can't be pinned on her.  And McGregor seems a bit too misty-eyed in these scenes.  He's such a milquetoast!  And again, the clothes he's asked to wear (striped shirts dangerously close to Marcel Marceau-land) do NOT help him.  One almost wonders if he needs to come out of the closet too.  (Not trying to lean on stereotypes, but the thought does occur.)And worst of all is the character of Andy, as played by Goran Visnjic (once a regular on ER).  This is Plummer's steadiest boyfriend, the lover who is there at the end.  Visnjic plays him so utterly unconvincingly that I almost cringed to see him.  He minces about with such unbridled fervor that it feels like a Benny Hill caricature.  The script is no help to him...but he takes what he has to work with it and turns it into utter garbage.  I felt sorry for the other actors having to share a sound stage with him.Overall the film has many very nice moments.  It was clearly made with love by writer/director Mike Mills (apparently semi-autobiographical).  But what it needed, I think, was more of a critical, dispassionate 2nd opinion from someone not quite so close to the material.  Some tightening of the script, better development of the secondary characters (including Laurent's character) and a far better costume designer could easily have turned this from a three-star, soon-to-be-forgotten film into a 4.5 star, memorable exploration of the human heart.",3,Touching but uneven and disappointing too.,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,4630,"['BEGINNERS', 'many', 'nice', 'elements', 'sweet', 'movie', 'overall', 'also', 'very', 'uneven', 'frustrating', 'too.The', 'essential', 'concept', 'what', 'interested', 'actors', 'watching', 'son', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'well', 'thirties', 'still', 'quite', 'single', 'grapple', 'death', 'mother', 'followed', 'closely', 'announcement', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'gay', 'start', 'enjoying', 'open', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'not', 'long', 'father', 'cancer', 'gone', 'too', 'soon', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'learn', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'series', 'intertwining', 'flashbacks', 'One', 'series', 'young', 'boy', 'experiencing', 'home', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'distant', 'father', 'moody', 'unhappy', 'mother', 'other', 'observing', 'how', 'happy', 'generous', 'open', 'father', 'become', 'once', 'closet', 'last', 'father', 'last', 'days', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'still', 'warm', 'funny', 'open', 'Finally', 'mixed', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'scenes', 'developing', 'romance', 'McGregor', 'Anna', 'actress', 'free', 'spirit', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'so', 'wonderful', 'INGLOURIOUS', 'BASTERDS', '.Plummer', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Oscar', 'talk', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'When', 'Plummer', 'was', 'younger', 'back', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'DAYS', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'Stiff', 'cold', 'old', 'age', 'given', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'no', 'longer', 'worries', 'how', 'just', 'lets', 'BE', 'DO', 'whatever', 'part', 'Ironically', 'even', '80s', 'off', 'more', 'virile', 'passionate', 'now', 'ever', 'did', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'even', 'costume', 'designer', 'old', 'gay', 'men', 'wear', 'ridiculous', 'scarf-type', 'thingies', 'free-wheelin', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'wonderful', 'grace', 'making', 'up', 'decades', 'lost', 'time', 'boy', 'give', 'man', 'Parties', 'clubs', 'boyfriends', 'fun', 'finally', 'able', 'develop', 'close', 'relationship', 'son', 'love', 'life', 'always', 'truly', 'craved', ""n't"", 'have', 'hold', 'back', 'anyone.McGregor', 'handles', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', 'perplexed', 'dad', 'also', 'moved', 'stories', 'being', 'closet', 'arranging', 'secret', 'rendezvous', 'other', 'men', 'angry', 'what', 'dad', 'put', 'mom', 'also', 'moved', 'joy', 'father', 'now', 'very', 'well', 'scenes', 'dad', 'end', 'romance', 'scenes', 'Laurent', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'First', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'glowing', 'actress', 'English', 'quite', 'hard', 'understand', 'pillow', 'talk', 'two', 'almost', 'one', 'sided', 'could', 'so', 'seldom', 'understand', 'whispers', 'character', 'also', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'successful', 'enough', 'actress', 'apparently', 'be', 'put', 'up', 'huge', 'luxury', 'suite', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'yet', 'lots', 'lots', 'time', 'gallivant', 'around', 'McGregor', 'never', 'needing', 'be', 'set', 'apparently', 'never', 'being', 'recognized', 'anyone', 'more', 'idea', 'scriptwriter', 'real', 'person', 'Again', 'Laurent', 'not', 'problem', 'fact', 'English', 'not', 'language', 'character', ""n't"", 'believable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'pinned', 'McGregor', 'bit', 'too', 'misty-eyed', 'scenes', 'such', 'milquetoast', 'again', 'clothes', 'asked', 'wear', 'striped', 'shirts', 'dangerously', 'close', 'Marcel', 'Marceau-land', 'do', 'NOT', 'help', 'One', 'almost', 'wonders', 'come', 'closet', 'too', 'Not', 'trying', 'lean', 'stereotypes', 'thought', 'occur', 'worst', 'character', 'Andy', 'played', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'once', 'regular', 'ER', 'Plummer', 'steadiest', 'boyfriend', 'lover', 'who', 'there', 'end', 'Visnjic', 'so', 'utterly', 'unconvincingly', 'almost', 'cringed', 'see', 'such', 'unbridled', 'fervor', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'caricature', 'script', 'help', 'what', 'work', 'utter', 'garbage', 'felt', 'sorry', 'other', 'actors', 'having', 'share', 'sound', 'stage', 'film', 'many', 'very', 'nice', 'moments', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'love', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'apparently', 'semi-autobiographical', 'what', 'needed', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'critical', 'dispassionate', '2nd', 'opinion', 'someone', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'close', 'material', 'tightening', 'script', 'better', 'development', 'secondary', 'characters', 'including', 'Laurent', 'character', 'far', 'better', 'costume', 'designer', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'turned', 'three-star', 'soon-to-be-forgotten', 'film', '4.5', 'star', 'memorable', 'exploration', 'human', 'heart']",N/A

1391364,A3I81NDLJKJ7E5,B004A8ZWV0,Roger O. Thornhill,"[0, 2]","This movie is so bad on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin. It's a crime that you can't RENT it on Amazon, you have to BUY it, and then you've spent way too much (10 bucks) and you're stuck with it. Its view of homosexual love is: that kind of love contains no rough waters, no clouds, no complications. No, a man need only fall gratefully into it (if he is Christopher Plummer in his seventies and is your father), and everything will be smooth sailing from then on... until he dies of a tragic illness a couple years later. Though he came out at such a late age, he immediately has a delightful entourage of gay folks; his lover is young and handsome and smiley and though he screws around on your dad, your dad doesn't resent it for a moment, because being gay makes everything... so full of joy. The movie's view of heterosexual love is the opposite -- but just as one-dimensional. For straights, love is so fraught, so artificial, such a mine field, that the only way to find love is to meet cute at a party while carrying around a Jack Russell terrier, and the woman you meet must have made a whimsical vow not to speak, so she writes on a pad of paper and everything is magical and exotic, and what the two of you fall in love WITH is your sheer, reckless lack of knowledge of each other. Even after she begins to talk, in a French accent of course, she continues to play it mysterious and yet oddly available, and you are fascinated by her, because she cleverly makes you feel so... camera-worthy. So the two of you cavort through scenes in which bad movie piano music supplies the lack of dialog, always self-regarding, always with that poor exploited dog to make you seem anything but a couple who might have to know each other and live any kind of normal life with normal problems. Fortunately, you and your father seem to have limitless money. And you have one of those Hollywood jobs, as some kind of philosophical cartoonist -- something we can all relate to, no? And after endless scenes where she smiles for no reason and you act faintly tragic, something must go wrong in the second-last act -- so you break up with her. That is so that you can remember the Lesson of the Piece: with what sunniness all the gay people greeted the impending death of your father (and how brightly he endured it too), and thus can you realize that being with a woman you don't know in any real way must surely, after all, be just the thing for you. So, in the end, you and she get together -- and it isn't long before more of that bad piano music signals that we had better cut now, because it's clear that two such self-absorbed people will crash and burn within minutes after the movie's end -- as soon as they have to deal with everyday issues. Asides: the performances are uniformly excellent; and the money scenes, the ones we really want to see acted out, are buried in fancy abstractness. For example, we don't see in real time the moment where dad tells son he's gay (a fact which son, of course, never suspected). We need to see that scene, we want to -- it might have been gut-wrenching or at least illuminating; but no, it is cutely framed as a placeless interview where the only issue is what was dad wearing. The main idea of this misbegotten mess is that straight love, because it isn't on the ""forbidden road"", must summon up every artifice possible to keep itself afloat -- but gay love is incapable of sinking -- incapable, in fact, of putting a furrow on the heart.",1,Gay is the answer to all problems - at least for straight people!,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,3499,"['movie', 'so', 'bad', 'many', 'levels', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'crime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'RENT', 'Amazon', 'have', 'BUY', 'then', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'way', 'too', 'much', '10', 'bucks', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'view', 'homosexual', 'love', 'kind', 'love', 'rough', 'waters', 'clouds', 'complications', 'No', 'man', 'need', 'only', 'fall', 'gratefully', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'seventies', 'father', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'then', 'tragic', 'illness', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'came', 'out', 'late', 'age', 'immediately', 'delightful', 'entourage', 'gay', 'folks', 'lover', 'young', 'handsome', 'smiley', 'dad', 'dad', ""n't"", 'resent', 'moment', 'being', 'gay', 'everything', 'so', 'full', 'joy', 'movie', 'view', 'heterosexual', 'love', 'opposite', 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'straights', 'love', 'so', 'fraught', 'so', 'artificial', 'such', 'mine', 'field', 'only', 'way', 'find', 'love', 'meet', 'cute', 'party', 'carrying', 'around', 'Jack', 'Russell', 'terrier', 'woman', 'meet', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'whimsical', 'vow', 'not', 'speak', 'pad', 'paper', 'everything', 'magical', 'exotic', 'what', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'WITH', 'sheer', 'reckless', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'other', 'Even', 'talk', 'French', 'accent', 'course', 'play', 'mysterious', 'yet', 'oddly', 'available', 'are', 'fascinated', 'cleverly', 'feel', 'so', 'camera-worthy', 'two', 'cavort', 'scenes', 'bad', 'movie', 'piano', 'music', 'lack', 'dialog', 'always', 'self-regarding', 'always', 'poor', 'exploited', 'dog', 'make', 'seem', 'anything', 'couple', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'know', 'other', 'live', 'kind', 'normal', 'life', 'normal', 'problems', 'Fortunately', 'father', 'seem', 'have', 'limitless', 'money', 'have', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'jobs', 'kind', 'philosophical', 'cartoonist', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'endless', 'scenes', 'where', 'reason', 'act', 'faintly', 'tragic', 'something', 'must', 'go', 'wrong', 'second-last', 'act', 'so', 'break', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'remember', 'Lesson', 'Piece', 'what', 'sunniness', 'gay', 'people', 'greeted', 'impending', 'death', 'father', 'how', 'brightly', 'endured', 'too', 'thus', 'can', 'realize', 'being', 'woman', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'way', 'must', 'surely', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'So', 'end', 'get', 'together', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'more', 'bad', 'piano', 'music', 'signals', 'had', 'better', 'cut', 'now', 'clear', 'two', 'such', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'will', 'crash', 'burn', 'minutes', 'movie', 'end', 'as', 'soon', 'have', 'deal', 'everyday', 'issues', 'Asides', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'money', 'scenes', 'ones', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'acted', 'out', 'are', 'buried', 'fancy', 'abstractness', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'time', 'moment', 'where', 'dad', 'son', 'gay', 'fact', 'son', 'course', 'never', 'suspected', 'need', 'see', 'scene', 'want', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'gut-wrenching', 'least', 'illuminating', 'cutely', 'framed', 'placeless', 'interview', 'where', 'only', 'issue', 'what', 'was', 'dad', 'wearing', 'main', 'idea', 'misbegotten', 'mess', 'straight', 'love', ""n't"", 'forbidden', 'road', 'must', 'summon', 'up', 'artifice', 'possible', 'keep', 'afloat', 'gay', 'love', 'incapable', 'sinking', 'incapable', 'fact', 'putting', 'furrow', 'heart']",N/A

That's the message of ""Beginners,"" a muted indie drama about two men - a father and a son - who alter the course of their lives in unexpected and dramatic ways.For Hal (Christopher Plummer), that change is particularly stunning, since he has lived the first seven decades of his life as a closeted gay man, husband to a woman (Mary Page Keller) who believed she could ""change"" him and father to a son who bewilderingly stood witness to what he thought was nothing more than a loveless marriage. Only after his wife's death is Hal able to reveal the truth about himself to the world and to his son, and, in his 70s, he makes his long-delayed entrance into the ""gay scene,"" even going so far as to procure a young immigrant boyfriend (Goran Visnjic) for himself. Unfortunately for Hal, the experience turns out to be a short-lived one, for, as the movie opens, we discover that Hal has recently died of cancer, and Oliver, who narrates the story, is still trying to cope with his perplexity and grief.The real focus of the movie is on Oliver (Ewan McGregor), who, like many men of his generation, finds it impossible to form lasting ties with the women he meets.  Does this fear of commitment arise from having observed the unfulfilling relationship, the wasted lives of his own parents?  Possibly. But Oliver may be running out of excuses, for he now has in his father a new role model to follow, that of a man who, after a lifetime of dishonesty and compromise, chose to grab at his one chance of happiness, to shake off the dust of an ossified existence and make his life count for something at the end.  The good news for Oliver is that he has the opportunity to make that same resolution at a much earlier stage in his life, a possibility that becomes all the clearer when he falls for an alluring French actress (Melanie Laurent) who would like to start a serious romance with this troubled fellow.Writer/director Mike Mills, who based the story on his own father, weaves a complex series of flashbacks to relate his story, never violating the hushed, respectful tone of the piece with big dramatic confrontations or corny melodramatics. - though he isn't averse to finding the humorous and playful side of life either, even in its darkest moments.  For the most part, though, he simply shows us brief moments in these characters' lives, captured for posterity by the eye of the camera, poignant in the sense of sadness, loss, redemption, fulfillment and hope they convey.Plummer and McGregor are, of course, flawless in their performances, but special note should be taken of Cosmo (""Hotel for Dogs""), the most scene-stealing pooch since Uggie in ""The Artist.""",4,It's never too late to change,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2698,"[""'re"", 'never', 'too', 'old', 'change', 'message', 'Beginners', 'muted', 'indie', 'drama', 'two', 'men', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'alter', 'course', 'lives', 'unexpected', 'dramatic', 'ways.For', 'Hal', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'change', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'lived', 'first', 'seven', 'decades', 'life', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'husband', 'woman', 'Mary', 'Page', 'Keller', 'who', 'believed', 'could', 'change', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'bewilderingly', 'stood', 'witness', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Only', 'wife', 'death', 'Hal', 'able', 'reveal', 'truth', 'world', 'son', '70s', 'long-delayed', 'entrance', 'gay', 'scene', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'procure', 'young', 'immigrant', 'boyfriend', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'Unfortunately', 'Hal', 'experience', 'out', 'be', 'short-lived', 'one', 'movie', 'discover', 'Hal', 'recently', 'died', 'cancer', 'Oliver', 'who', 'story', 'still', 'trying', 'cope', 'perplexity', 'grief.The', 'real', 'focus', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'who', 'many', 'men', 'generation', 'impossible', 'form', 'lasting', 'ties', 'women', 'fear', 'commitment', 'arise', 'having', 'observed', 'unfulfilling', 'relationship', 'wasted', 'lives', 'own', 'parents', 'Possibly', 'Oliver', 'may', 'be', 'running', 'excuses', 'now', 'father', 'new', 'role', 'model', 'follow', 'man', 'who', 'lifetime', 'dishonesty', 'compromise', 'chose', 'grab', 'one', 'chance', 'happiness', 'shake', 'off', 'dust', 'ossified', 'existence', 'make', 'life', 'count', 'something', 'end', 'good', 'news', 'Oliver', 'opportunity', 'make', 'same', 'resolution', 'much', 'earlier', 'stage', 'life', 'possibility', 'clearer', 'when', 'alluring', 'French', 'actress', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'start', 'serious', 'romance', 'troubled', 'fellow.Writer/director', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'who', 'based', 'story', 'own', 'father', 'complex', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'relate', 'story', 'never', 'violating', 'hushed', 'respectful', 'tone', 'piece', 'big', 'dramatic', 'confrontations', 'corny', 'melodramatics', ""n't"", 'averse', 'finding', 'humorous', 'playful', 'side', 'life', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'simply', 'brief', 'moments', 'characters', 'lives', 'captured', 'posterity', 'eye', 'camera', 'poignant', 'sense', 'sadness', 'loss', 'redemption', 'fulfillment', 'hope', 'convey.Plummer', 'McGregor', 'are', 'course', 'flawless', 'performances', 'special', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'Cosmo', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', 'most', 'scene-stealing', 'pooch', 'Uggie', 'Artist']",N/A

I was looking forward to a film that really focused on Plummer's character and his exploration of his fully-accepted homosexuality after decades of married life.  That concept alone had a lot of comedic potential.  This film however, is not a comedy.  It's a very laborious, pensive and even dark story about a very, very, VERY depressed young man dealing with the death of both parents.I could tell where it was all leading--to a message such as, ""Take advantage of now, because now is all we have.  Be true to yourself and take a chance on love because it might not come again.""  Those are admirable messages, but this film misses the opportunity to emphasize those ideas because it jumps all around in time, from past to present and back again with little continuity.  It can be jarring.  This film has a VERY independent feel, meaning that it's NOT a linear story, the dialogue is often interrupted with LONG, gaping silences that suck the life out of any momentum the story might have provided.I got through sad films like The Hours and The Piano, even The Crucible just fine, but I HAD to turn this off.  It just seemed pointlessly depressing for no reason and did not really focus on the journey of Plummer's character in a way that really spoke to those challenges.  It's really Ewan McGregor's character's story and that's FAR less interesting.  Give this one a pass.

1391372,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004A8ZWV0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Happiness for Beginners...""Beginners"", the new film from writer/director Mike Mills (""Thumbsucker""), is a really well-made film about one man's relationship with his elderly father after he is shocked by two announcements his father makes.Oliver (Ewan McGregor) is a graphic artist who lives in a pretty bare house. Oliver seems to be going through the motions. He moves slowly, reacts slowly, and doesn't seem to register things. He is almost too lonely. At work, he becomes obsessed with making a booklet for a group's CD depicting the various stages of loneliness. Oliver tries to take care of his elderly dad, Hal (Christopher Plummer), but Hal reveals two things to his son in fairly quick succession. Shortly after Georgia (Mary Page Keller), his wife, dies, Hal comes out and reveals he was pretty much always gay. Sure, he loved Oliver's mother, but she knew he was gay as well. A couple of years later, Hal learns he is sick. Very sick. Too sick to operate sick. So, just as he is about to begin living life again, he finds his life will be cut short. But Hal refuses to let this news dampen his newfound lust for life and doesn't want Oliver to tell Andy (Goran Visnjic), his boyfriend.Part of the beauty of this film is that Oliver makes changes in his life, slight changes to his attitude and outlook when he sees how his father doesn't let his illness or impending death faze him. He makes an effort to let someone into his life when he realizes it is never too late. And this realization also comes from watching his dad fall in love again.Love for Beginners...When Hal comes out, he immediately embraced everything he can about being gay. He joins various groups and lets the members meet at his house, he places singles ads, he goes to a gay club. He is so entranced by his new life, he immediately calls Oliver late one night to tell him all about the club. He is almost giddy and starts mimicking the music, trying to get his son to help him identify it. It is a cute, nice moment and helps depict his newfound lust for life, the happiness he has now found.But more importantly, he falls in love. And Oliver watches Hal and Andy and quickly embraces their new relationship. But as he sees their love develop, he decides to embrace love again and happens to meet a French actress, Anna (Melanie Laurent, ""Inglourious Basterds"") at a costume party. They talk and then go back to her hotel room (she is here to film a movie) and then start a relationship. As they spend more time together, they talk, they take walks at night, they share, they make love. They also spend a lot of time with Hal's Jack Russell Terrier, Arthur, following them around.Then, as most relationships do, Oliver and Anna experience some problems and they decide to part ways rather than deal with the problems and try to build a stronger, better relationship.As each man navigates the new waters of a relationship, they seem to learn from each other.Oliver worries that he may be repeating the same mistakes, because he tells us he let each of his previous relationships unravel or end unattended. Relationships are work and he and Anna need to put in some effort. But will they realize that in time.Life for Beginners...From what I understand, this film is based on events that happened to Mills. I don't know how much of the story is semi-autobiographical, but this puts things in a different slant for me and helps me to understand the chronological layout of the film. Rather I should say the lack of chronology. The narrative jumps back and forth giving us snippets of time after Hal has passed away, after he comes out and begins exploring his new lifestyle, as his relationship with Andy grows, when he becomes sick, as he embraces the various groups he joins.These moments are used, more or less, to illustrate Oliver's life, and how he changes throughout his Dad's new life. It almost seems like he is remembering key moments, leading to a memory of another key moment and he moves backwards, until he is a small boy watching his mom deal with her feelings of loneliness. What we quickly learn is that Oliver is always learning from those around him. In these early moments, he is learning about loneliness and this is something that will follow him throughout his life.As the narrative begins to move back and forth, each moment seems to inform the next, and these moments seem to inform earlier scenes, giving the movie a more concise feel. Normally, this wouldn't be a noteworthy comment, but because the film is concise, it feels like it moves, like we are getting a great picture of the lives of the characters, like we are really spending quality time with them. This narrative structure allows Mills to skip over unnecessary bridging moments and show us just what we need to know.Also, because Oliver narrates the story, and does so in a sort of stream of consciousness way, we really get the feeling we are watching his memories. The story begins with Oliver dealing with his father's passing, but then he starts to remember how his father came out and his dad is suddenly in the story. Because very little else changes throughout, it is difficult to keep yourself oriented in the timeline. But this is exactly what Mills wants because it allows him to jump around and give us more of a portrait of the characters and focus less on getting from point A to point B.All three leads are great, but I have to say Christopher Plummer really stands out. The performance is really well-rounded, very believable and completely natural. His newfound lust for life is simply infectious and he begins to affect us, much like he changes his son's life. As an elderly man who suddenly comes out, who suddenly has the freedom to live as he wants, he digs into the lifestyle wholeheartedly. Naturally, as he is doing all of this for the first time, his eyes are open wide with anticipation. When he goes to a nightclub for the first time, he is eager to take the whole experience in, even though he realizes gay men are not so interested in a man of his age. Later, as Oliver goes through his dad's possessions, he finds a hand written draft of a personal's ad. It is interesting to see how Hal adapted to his new lifestyle, how quickly he was learning, and yet realize how far he had to go.Then, when he meets Andy (Goran Visnjic), it is sweet to watch how in love these two men are.Plummer gives Hal a lot of depth, informing his character in very subtle ways. Initially, Oliver is a little put off to learn his dad was always gay, throughout his marriage to his mother, but Hal isn't bitter about it or dismissive of the love Oliver's parents shared, so Hal's son accepts the revelation more. Sure, it explains a lot, and there were some awkward moments throughout Oliver's childhood, but Hal is happy and Oliver is happy to see his dad have some joy so late in his life.As Hal becomes sick, Plummer guides us through the various stages. At one point, when he learns just how sick he is, he puts on a smile and makes Oliver promise he will not tell Andy. It is a subtle performance and the subtlety makes it a memorable role for an actor who has already had so many memorable performances.Ewan McGregor is also very good. Oliver is a deeply lonely person, so lonely he starts talking with Arthur, his Dad's Jack Russell Terrier. Even Arthur comments that Oliver has to do something or the loneliness will completely engulf them. Initially, Oliver and Arthur only have each other and they spend a lot of time together. In fact, whenever Oliver tries to leave Arthur with someone else, the little Jack Russell starts to bark and yip causing Oliver to take him along. As they talk, Arthur's responses are printed on the screen while the dog simply stars at Oliver. You may be reading this with some skepticism, ""The dog talks with a human?"", but Mills presents it in a low key, no nonsense way and you just come to accept it. It's a cute and sometimes funny idea.Oliver narrates the film, giving us his views and insights. Often, he will say something and then change his mind and we see the same image but in a slightly different way. Later, we see some of Oliver's art, surprisingly vibrant black marker drawings, which he uses to illustrate his feelings, or to give us portraits of the women he has had relationships with in the past. It is a nice touch giving the film's overall sense of discovery a touch of whimsy.When Oliver meets Anna, you can see a little light come on. It's still buried deep within, but you get the sense she may be able to lead him back to life.And the more time they spend together, the more Oliver seems infatuated with her.Melanie Laurent is also very good. When Oliver first meets her, at a costume party, they barely speak but she is oddly attracted to the man who is dressed as Sigmund Freud and encourages him to talk and ask questions.Goran Visnjic has less time to make an impact as Andy, Hal's new, younger boyfriend. And he isn't around in a few scenes, but because of the mixed up chronology it is difficult to tell if Andy is just not present at that moment, if they broke up, if he is absent because of Hal's sickness, whatever reason. When he does have a few lines, he seems to be trying to portray the character as needy and effeminate. He stares at Oliver in a way telling us he is trying to figure out his boyfriend's son. At one point, he confronts Oliver with his feelings, trying to get to the heart of the matter. It is certainly a different performance for the sex symbol who once starred on TV's ""ER"", but I didn't feel it was entirely successful.""Beginners"" is a near-great look at the growing pains a father and son experience late in their lives. But they learn from or help each other which makes the film very sweet and almost endearing.You really should see it. If you give a film like this your patronage, you are encouraging filmmakers to make more films like this and, more importantly, making it easier for them to be seen at your local theater.",4,"Not the

1391377,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004A8ZWV0,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","An offbeat comedy drama ""Beginners,"" written and directed by Mike Mills (""Thumbsucker""), has a life-affirming message and some interesting characters. The part autobiographical film is often funny, sweet and touching. Christopher Plummer is deservedly Oscar nominated for his wonderful portrayal of Hal. But what I don't understand is ... why not just tell his story in a simple, straightforward way?In ""Beginners"" Christopher Plummer is Hal, 75-year-old. Hal has lost his wife, with whom he had lived for 44 years. Now being terminally ill, he comes out as gay and is dating a young male Andy (Goran Visnjic). Hal reveals everything to his only son Oliver. Hal's life changes after that. All these events are told in flashbacks (sometimes with old photos).Ewan McGregor is Oliver, a thirty-something artist, mild-mannered and afraid of starting a new relationship. M&eacute;lanie Laurent is Anna, a French actress, beautiful, delectable and free-spirited.Using intertwined flashbacks, Mike Mills attempts to connect their story with that of Oliver's father, while giving us almost no reason for us to care Oliver and Anna. Who are they? They are obviously nice persons, but not as interesting as they should.Some cites ""Annie Hall"" and compare its story structure with that of ""Beginners,"" in which episodes about Oliver as a young boy are inserted. I see the point these reviewers are making, but Woody Allen's film, stylish, witty and sentimental - all these things ""Beginners"" strives to be - has strength that the latter doesn't have: Annie Hall, a fleshed-out heroine who also is the film's cornerstone.The film's cornerstone comes in the form of Hal played by Christopher Plummer, who brings an authentic ring to what Hal has to say to his son. Hal's message, based on his happiness and regret, is moving and real.

1391378,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004A8ZWV0,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The great strength of 'Beginners' (as well as its greatest weakness) is how close the film's creator is to the material. The story is by Mike Mills, whose real life father came out of the closet at the age of 75 and declared he was gay, five years before his death. Christopher Plummer magisterially recreates Mills' real-life father in the role of Hal Fields, a retired museum director who maintained a closeted relationship with his wife for years, until her death from cancer.'Beginners' is slow-going and lacks external conflict all-around. Nonetheless it's the father's internal arc that Mills knows so well and Plummer is given the plum assignment of making that explicit to us. The essential question is whether Hal will succumb to his cancer diagnosis and give up on life or will he embrace it, even while he is dying? As it turns out, much to the chagrin of his only son, Oliver, he decides to act as if every minute of his life must be lived to the fullest. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, Hal marches forward despite his physical limitations. He's quite sensitive to others, especially when he recommends to Oliver that he should hide his terminal diagnosis from his much younger lover, Andy.Not only do we become privy to Hal's inner life but his many friends in the gay community come off as real people, who also happen to have their biases. Nonetheless, when push comes to shove, they're seen as basically sensitive souls, who go out of their way to make Hal feel comfortable, especially in his last days. Andy in particular is a nuanced portrait of a gay man who falls in love with an older lover. He's troubled by Oliver's lack of warmth toward him and suspects that it's because he's gay. The bigger picture is that Oliver is generally cut off from his emotions and is depressed by his father's illness and subsequent death.Perhaps the most fascinating character is Oliver's mother, Georgia, seen in flashbacks when he was a child. Georgia is highly intellectual and cynical; today she might be labeled 'bi-polar'. She plays games with Oliver--including one that involves pointing her finger at her son, simulating the discharge of a firearm she pretends to hold in her hand. On cue, Oliver crumples to the ground but then pops up-- repeating the macabre ritual, several more times before the game is over!The bad news is that Mills doesn't know how to create drama out of his own character; the end result is the muddled exploration of Oliver's romance with a troubled French actress, Anna, who he meets by chance at a costume party. A good part of their initial meeting is a virtual one-way communication, as Anna has laryngitis, and can only write notes to indicate what she's thinking. Both Oliver and Anna had troubled childhoods, particularly in their relationship to their fathers. Oliver has a history of break-ups with women and at one point does indeed cut the cords with Anna. There's a semi-comic scene where he flies to NYC after she moves there, only to find that she went back to LA a few days earlier. In sum, there's nothing at all distinctive about the couples' relationship and they both seem mired in the muck of past bad karma. Despite the seeming happy reconciliation at film's end, 'Beginners' is bogged down by the boring interplay between the two non-descript sad sacks!'Beginners' has some great visual scenes, especially when Oliver narrates his own as well as his family's past history (there's a montage of both old photos and objects, that brilliantly illustrate the past). There's also Oliver's downbeat illustrations, as he designs CD covers for musicians (I believe that follows Mills' past line of work in real life).'Beginners' is truly a mixed bag, with a bravura Christopher Plummer performance undermined by the son's soulless quest for equilibrium, much of which I had a hard time caring about. 'Beginners' is the type of film for the patient film goer. There are rewards here but many discouraging bumps also along the way. Proceed with an open mind and you'll be rewarded to a certain extent--if you're willing to put up with the other moments, that don't always ring true.",3,Superb Plummer performance of out of the closet elderly father tempered by downbeat son's bond with troubled paramour,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,4175,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***The', 'great', 'strength', ""'Beginners"", 'as', 'well', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'how', 'close', 'film', 'creator', 'material', 'story', 'Mike', 'Mills', 'real', 'life', 'father', 'came', 'closet', 'age', '75', 'declared', 'was', 'gay', 'five', 'years', 'death', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'magisterially', 'Mills', 'real-life', 'father', 'role', 'Hal', 'Fields', 'retired', 'museum', 'director', 'who', 'maintained', 'closeted', 'relationship', 'wife', 'years', 'death', 'cancer', ""'Beginners"", 'slow-going', 'external', 'conflict', 'all-around', 'father', 'internal', 'arc', 'Mills', 'so', 'well', 'Plummer', 'given', 'plum', 'assignment', 'making', 'explicit', 'essential', 'question', 'Hal', 'will', 'succumb', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'will', 'embrace', 'even', 'dying', 'out', 'much', 'chagrin', 'only', 'son', 'Oliver', 'act', 'minute', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'lived', 'fullest', 'Instead', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'Hal', 'forward', 'physical', 'limitations', 'quite', 'sensitive', 'others', 'especially', 'when', 'Oliver', 'should', 'hide', 'terminal', 'diagnosis', 'much', 'younger', 'lover', 'Andy.Not', 'only', 'do', 'become', 'privy', 'Hal', 'inner', 'life', 'many', 'friends', 'gay', 'community', 'come', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'have', 'biases', 'Nonetheless', 'when', 'push', 'shove', ""'re"", 'seen', 'basically', 'sensitive', 'souls', 'who', 'go', 'way', 'make', 'Hal', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'especially', 'last', 'days', 'Andy', 'particular', 'nuanced', 'portrait', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'older', 'lover', 'troubled', 'Oliver', 'lack', 'warmth', 'gay', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Oliver', 'generally', 'cut', 'off', 'emotions', 'depressed', 'father', 'illness', 'subsequent', 'death.Perhaps', 'most', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Oliver', 'mother', 'Georgia', 'seen', 'flashbacks', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Georgia', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'cynical', 'today', 'might', 'be', 'labeled', ""'bi-polar"", 'games', 'Oliver', 'including', 'one', 'pointing', 'finger', 'son', 'simulating', 'discharge', 'firearm', 'hold', 'hand', 'cue', 'Oliver', 'ground', 'then', 'up', 'repeating', 'macabre', 'ritual', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'game', 'bad', 'news', 'Mills', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'create', 'drama', 'own', 'character', 'end', 'result', 'muddled', 'exploration', 'Oliver', 'romance', 'troubled', 'French', 'actress', 'Anna', 'who', 'chance', 'costume', 'party', 'good', 'part', 'initial', 'meeting', 'virtual', 'one-way', 'communication', 'Anna', 'laryngitis', 'can', 'only', 'write', 'notes', 'indicate', 'what', 'thinking', 'Oliver', 'Anna', 'had', 'troubled', 'childhoods', 'particularly', 'relationship', 'fathers', 'Oliver', 'history', 'break-ups', 'women', 'one', 'point', 'indeed', 'cut', 'cords', 'Anna', 'semi-comic', 'scene', 'where', 'NYC', 'there', 'only', 'find', 'went', 'back', 'LA', 'few', 'days', 'earlier', 'sum', 'nothing', 'distinctive', 'couples', 'relationship', 'seem', 'mired', 'muck', 'past', 'bad', 'karma', 'seeming', 'happy', 'reconciliation', 'film', 'end', ""'Beginners"", 'bogged', 'down', 'boring', 'interplay', 'two', 'non-descript', 'sad', 'sacks', ""'Beginners"", 'great', 'visual', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'Oliver', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'past', 'history', 'montage', 'old', 'photos', 'objects', 'brilliantly', 'illustrate', 'past', 'also', 'Oliver', 'downbeat', 'illustrations', 'CD', 'covers', 'musicians', 'believe', 'Mills', 'past', 'line', 'work', 'real', 'life', ""'Beginners"", 'truly', 'mixed', 'bag', 'bravura', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'performance', 'undermined', 'son', 'soulless', 'quest', 'equilibrium', 'much', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'caring', 'about', ""'Beginners"", 'type', 'film', 'patient', 'film', 'goer', 'are', 'rewards', 'here', 'many', 'discouraging', 'bumps', 'also', 'way', 'Proceed', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'certain', 'extent', ""'re"", 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'other', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'ring', 'true']",N/A
