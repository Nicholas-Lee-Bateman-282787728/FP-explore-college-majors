285599,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6301976460,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 2]","""Solarbabies"" is a hilariously cheesy movie about a group of teenagers-led by Jason (Jason Patric) and Terra (Jami Gertz) with their cute sidekick Danny (Lukas Haas) It's an epic that has rollerskating--just likePrayer of the Rollerboysstarring the late Corey Haim, andXanadu - Magical Musical Edition (With Complete Soundtrack CD)(no wonder there's a tent that has the word ""Xanadu"" on it) This movie also led toThe Lost Boys (Two-Disc Special Edition), since Jason Patric recommended Jami Gertz on account of this very movie.In ""Solarbabies"",children are raised in massive orphanages, to become part of the System. The Solarbabies, led by Jason and Terra, dream of liberation. Danny comes on a glowing ball that calls itself ""Bodhi."" Yes, a glowing ball will lead the way... and a child shall lead them. The children are taught about the evil ""eco-warriors"" (yeah, shades ofThe Forbidden Dance is Lambadathat's all about saving the environment) There's Dark Star, the pseudo-Native American with his shamanic birds... and is his name a nod toDark Star? In their escape, the Solarbabies come upon a settlement that used to be an amusement park inhabited by pseudo-Native Americans. The wise old sage, in an interesting twist, lives in an abandoned wax museum. Next, they come to a frontier town/wasteland that's not unlike the ones inThe Ice PiratesandThe Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Double Feature). Like ""Ice Pirates"",the aim of the Solarbabies is to free the world's water. One expects to see Mel Gibson, Robert Urich, Anjelica Huston or Tina Turner. In the end, the Solarbabies defeat evil and there's a group hug.""Solarbabies"" is about the triumph of good over evil--and cheesiness!!!!",5,Children of the Sun,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1706,"['Solarbabies', 'hilariously', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'group', 'teenagers-led', 'Jason', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Terra', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'cute', 'sidekick', 'Danny', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'epic', 'rollerskating', 'just', 'likePrayer', 'Rollerboysstarring', 'late', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'andXanadu', 'Magical', 'Musical', 'Edition', 'Complete', 'Soundtrack', 'CD', 'wonder', 'tent', 'word', 'Xanadu', 'movie', 'also', 'led', 'toThe', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'recommended', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'account', 'very', 'movie.In', 'Solarbabies', 'children', 'are', 'raised', 'massive', 'orphanages', 'become', 'part', 'System', 'Solarbabies', 'led', 'Jason', 'Terra', 'dream', 'liberation', 'Danny', 'glowing', 'ball', 'Bodhi', 'Yes', 'glowing', 'ball', 'will', 'lead', 'way', 'child', 'shall', 'lead', 'children', 'are', 'taught', 'evil', 'eco-warriors', 'yeah', 'ofThe', 'Forbidden', 'Dance', 'Lambadathat', 'saving', 'environment', 'Dark', 'Star', 'pseudo-Native', 'American', 'shamanic', 'birds', 'name', 'nod', 'toDark', 'Star', 'escape', 'Solarbabies', 'come', 'settlement', 'used', 'be', 'amusement', 'park', 'inhabited', 'pseudo-Native', 'Americans', 'wise', 'old', 'sage', 'interesting', 'twist', 'abandoned', 'wax', 'museum', 'Next', 'come', 'frontier', 'town/wasteland', 'not', 'ones', 'inThe', 'Ice', 'PiratesandThe', 'Road', 'Warrior', '/', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Beyond', 'Thunderdome', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Ice', 'Pirates', 'aim', 'Solarbabies', 'free', 'world', 'water', 'One', 'see', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'end', 'Solarbabies', 'defeat', 'evil', 'group', 'hug', 'Solarbabies', 'triumph', 'good', 'cheesiness']",Solarbabies VHS

285608,A3T0OTH5072YRE,6301976460,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","So this was one of the weirder movies I've seen in awhile.  In fact it was so weird it was kind of funny, which I guess made it worth watching.  Surprisingly, being a child of the eighties, I hadn't actually watched too many movies from that time ( I was stuck on the tv shows apparently) and so I'm making up for it now by watching a few.  I can definitely see why that whole decade was considered a bit odd now.It's a post-apocalyptic future where children are gathered and sent to camps that will force them to become a part of the Eco-Protectorate (a group that controls the dwindling water supply).  At this camp their main function is to roll around on roller skates it would seem, playing games. They sometimes sneak off the camps to play games though and at one such time something wonderful happens.  One little boy, Daniel, finds a mysterious orb of light that he names Bodhai that can do wondrous things and he and his friends (a roller team called the Solarbabies) must protect it at all costs.  They also find a new goal for themselves, to save the water from the evil Eco Protectorate.  The only problem is it is near impossible to escape from the camps, and when Daniel goes missing, they have to find a way to rescue him.Characters:Richard Jordan as GrockJami Gertz as TerraJason Patric as JasonLukas Haas as DanielJames LeGros as MetronClaude Brooks as RabbitPeter DeLuise as TugPeter Kowanko as GavialAdrian Pasdar as DarstarSarah Douglas as ShandrayCharles Durning as The WardenFrank Converse as GreentreeTerrence Mann as IvorAlexei Sayle as MaliceBruce Payne as DoggerThe characters are very eighties in this movie.  They've got the big hair, big attitude, and love to skate with a whole lot of drama mixed in.  The bad guys are complete evil with no redeeming qualities and also have big hair.  Throw in some weird dance scenes and that should pretty much round out the picture of this cast.  None of them were particularly good actors in my opinion, but as said before the movie was so amusing I could almost ignore that.The plot seemed fairly standard for a post-apocalyptic world.  They have to save a resource and share it with the people, in this case water.  The roller skates though, added a whole new dimension.  There wasn't anywhere these kids couldn't skate.  Made me want to go put on a pair myself and roll through my  lawn just to see if it was skate-able.  Probably a good thing I didn't though because I don't think it would have gone as smoothly as their skating.  Since its a kids movie it is appropriate for all ages and I can see younger viewers identifying with Daniel pretty easy as he was a cute kid who gets to play with the mysterious ball of light.Definitely a weird movie but if you haven't seen it, give it a watch just for a giggle.  It is average in all ways, but highly amusing.Review by M.

He talks different from the whites. (""Hey Bodee."" ""His name's Bodhi!"" ""Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine."" Or something to that effect.)2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. ""Sphere of longiness""? Ech!I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the ""I love the 80's"" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, ""Prayer of the Rollerboys"" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect.",1,Racist Movie - Worst Black Stereotyping I Have Ever Seen,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,3161,"['movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'awful', 'am', 'ranking', '1', 'star', 'then', 'according', 'reviewer', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'soul', 'Hey', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'movie', 'worst', 'black', 'stereotyping', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'particularly', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'worse', 'blaxploitation', 'films', '70', 'were', 'least', 'entertaining.This', 'movie', 'group', 'teenage', 'white', 'kids', 'one', 'token', 'black', 'thrown', 'just', 'hell', 'just', 'how', ""'black"", 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'Well', 'movie', 'clear', 'true', 'soul', 'man', 'way', 'establish', 'facts:1', 'different', 'whites', 'Hey', 'Bodee', 'name', 'Bodhi', 'Well', 'say', 'way', ""'ll"", 'say', 'something', 'effect.', '2', 'know', 'black', 'people', 'can', 'breakdance', 'ca', ""n't"", '3', 'basketball', 'Again', 'white', 'person', 'black', 'people', 'basketball', 'are', 'good', 'right', '4', 'person', ""n't"", 'truly', 'black', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'hip-hop', 'can', ""'m"", 'white', 'guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'racism', 'issues', 'watching', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'such', 'blatant', 'black', 'stereotype', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'quite', 'embarassing', 'watch', 'actually', 'What', 'where', 'thinking', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'way', 'today', 'day', 'age.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'lame', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'roller-blading', '/', 'cyberpunk', 'craze', '80', 'usual', 'bleak', 'dystopian', 'future', 'typical', 'movies', 'days', 'also', 'funky', 'little', 'ball', 'named', 'Bodhi', 'weirdest', 'most', 'nonsensical', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'almost', 'bad', 'dream', 'somebody', 'wrote', 'down', 'as', 'soon', 'woke', 'up', 'was', 'later', 'worked', 'screenplay.This', 'movie', 'so', 'stupid', 'painful', 'watch', 'only', 'good', 'reason', 'see', 'see', 'few', 'young', 'actors', 'such', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Twister', 'Still', 'Standing', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Logan', 'Run', 'as', 'well', 'stunning', 'Sarah', 'Douglas', 'Superman', 'II', 'Conan', 'Destroyer', 'starring', 'villainess', 'roll', 'usual.Sarah', 'Douglas', 'really', 'make', 'good', 'villain', 'too', 'too', 'bad', 'talent', 'was', 'so', 'wasted', 'crapfest', 'movie', 'Sphere', 'longiness', 'Ech', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'mean', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'be', 'just', 'love', '80', 'nostalgia-factor', 'kicking', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'rational', 'reason', 'phenomenon.And', 'please', 'Skating', 'overgrown', 'road', 'Skating', 'dirt', ""'d"", 'get', '10', 'feet', 'rock', 'stuck', 'skates', 'went', 'flying', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'can', 'make', 'believe', 'rollerblades', 'work', 'sand.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'other', 'dystopian', 'future', 'skating', 'flick', 'Prayer', 'Rollerboys', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'course', 'ai', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'stinks', 'something', 'else', 'ANYTHING', 'else', 'not', 'then', 'least', 'show', 'black', 'people', 'world', 'little', 'basic', 'human', 'respect']",Solarbabies VHS
