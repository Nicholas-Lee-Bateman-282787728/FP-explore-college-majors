The Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto was one of the works that, as witness his recordings, always seemed to provoke disagreements with his soloists.  The same is true here.  On the other hand, the disagreements sparked performances of excitement.  That is also true here.  Kissin plays brilliantly and the orchestra performs up to their usual high standards and the result is an exciting performance of this much performed work. The other music is also performed beautifully ... up to the orchestra's high standards.",4,A Battle of Wills,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,675,"['Von', 'Karajan', 'magnificent', 'work', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'well', 'known', 'battle', 'soloists', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'integral', 'part', ""'his"", 'organization', 'Tchaikovsky', 'First', 'Piano', 'Concerto', 'was', 'one', 'works', 'witness', 'recordings', 'always', 'seemed', 'provoke', 'disagreements', 'soloists', 'same', 'true', 'here', 'other', 'hand', 'disagreements', 'sparked', 'performances', 'excitement', 'also', 'true', 'here', 'Kissin', 'brilliantly', 'orchestra', 'usual', 'high', 'standards', 'result', 'exciting', 'performance', 'much', 'performed', 'work', 'other', 'music', 'also', 'performed', 'beautifully', 'up', 'orchestra', 'high', 'standards']",Herbert Von Karajan - New Year's Concert 1988 - Prokofiev Symphony No. 1 & Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 / Kissin
510524,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,B00001AQZD,David M. Goldberg,"[1, 2]","There is a near-unanimity among those who have reviewed this DVD that the performance of the 17-year-old pianist ranks with that of any of the giants of the keyboard of any age. With this assessment, I am in full agreement, and for me his phenomenal playing was even more wondrous as, without knowing his true age when I first played the disc, he looked to me no older than a Bar-mitzvah boy. Karajan's contribution has also attracted a wealth of favourable comment, deservedly so. It is the first disc of the many I have from this Sony Legacy series where he raises his eyes from the floor and actually opens them. He even manages to replace his perpetual scowl with the occasional smile and expression of joy. I would like to think that this was the result of his astonishment at his soloist's prowess as much as the occasion itself ---- Christmas Eve in the Philharmonie. The BPO responded magnificently to his direction, and though the overall pace was slower than usual, this allowed the music to shine with majestic grandeur, and made one oblivious of the moments of vulgarity to which the composer succumbed. In short, the finest orchestral account of this work, bar none. Put this soloist and orchestra together and you have as close to a definitive version of this work as I have heard, and the sound quality does it full justice. Some reviewers have criticized the camera work as old-fashioned, but I strongly disagree. Kissen's fingerwork gets plenty of exposure, and a good balance is maintained between soloist, conductor and orchestra. The utter excitement of this triumphant performance could not be better conveyed by Large, Burton or anyone else using state-of-the-art equipment. Worth every one of 5 stars. The only deficit I felt was the cutting short of the applause at the end. This is a big factor in creating the illusion of being actually present in the flesh, and I missed it badly.In this context, one can regard Prokofiev's 1st Symphony as something of a bonus. Again, it is awfully well played, with Karajan and the BPO once more on top of their form, but there were times when I felt that the weight of the orchestra was too heavy for the score. It is the essence of lightness and good humour, intended to add a modern dress to the symphonic music of the Mozart/Haydn era. One hundred instrumentalists is way too many.",5,Age meets youth,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2347,"['near-unanimity', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'performance', '17-year-old', 'pianist', 'ranks', 'giants', 'keyboard', 'age', 'assessment', 'am', 'full', 'agreement', 'phenomenal', 'playing', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'wondrous', 'knowing', 'true', 'age', 'when', 'first', 'played', 'disc', 'looked', 'older', 'Bar-mitzvah', 'boy', 'Karajan', 'contribution', 'also', 'attracted', 'wealth', 'favourable', 'comment', 'deservedly', 'so', 'first', 'disc', 'many', 'have', 'Sony', 'Legacy', 'series', 'where', 'eyes', 'floor', 'actually', 'even', 'replace', 'perpetual', 'scowl', 'occasional', 'smile', 'expression', 'joy', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'result', 'astonishment', 'soloist', 'prowess', 'as', 'much', 'occasion', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Philharmonie', 'BPO', 'responded', 'magnificently', 'direction', 'overall', 'pace', 'was', 'slower', 'usual', 'allowed', 'music', 'shine', 'majestic', 'grandeur', 'made', 'one', 'oblivious', 'moments', 'vulgarity', 'composer', 'succumbed', 'short', 'finest', 'orchestral', 'account', 'work', 'bar', 'none', 'Put', 'soloist', 'orchestra', 'together', 'have', 'as', 'close', 'definitive', 'version', 'work', 'have', 'heard', 'sound', 'quality', 'full', 'justice', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'camera', 'work', 'old-fashioned', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'Kissen', 'fingerwork', 'plenty', 'exposure', 'good', 'balance', 'maintained', 'soloist', 'conductor', 'orchestra', 'utter', 'excitement', 'triumphant', 'performance', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'conveyed', 'Large', 'Burton', 'anyone', 'else', 'using', 'state-of-the-art', 'equipment', 'Worth', 'one', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'deficit', 'felt', 'was', 'cutting', 'short', 'applause', 'end', 'big', 'factor', 'creating', 'illusion', 'being', 'actually', 'present', 'flesh', 'missed', 'context', 'one', 'can', 'regard', 'Prokofiev', '1st', 'Symphony', 'something', 'bonus', 'Again', 'awfully', 'well', 'played', 'Karajan', 'BPO', 'once', 'more', 'top', 'form', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'weight', 'orchestra', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'score', 'essence', 'lightness', 'good', 'humour', 'intended', 'add', 'modern', 'dress', 'symphonic', 'music', 'Mozart/Haydn', 'era', 'One', 'hundred', 'instrumentalists', 'way', 'too', 'many']",Herbert Von Karajan - New Year's Concert 1988 - Prokofiev Symphony No. 1 & Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 / Kissin

510526,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,B00001AQZD,Ghost(Ghost(M)),"[0, 1]","The highlight of this remarkable recording is an energetic, playful, scintillating performance of Prokofiev's Symphony No.1. It truly bursts with joy and mirth; first time around, I just couldn't get enough of it; I don't know of a better version of this piece. The video is worth having just for this part alone (they play it first).The remaining part of the concert is given to the First Piano Concerto of Tchaikovsky. Well, this piece is less striking to me, maybe subjectively (I noticed that with age my love of Tchaikovsky diminished), or maybe because it's simply played too much, like Mendelssohn's wedding march -- one becomes numb to it. However, Kissin is probably still in his teens here and is quite a sight, so I think, his fans will like this part too. I felt that Karajan applied brakes a bit during this number; I feel it should be played faster. Well, ""should"" is a big word: maybe I'm just used to it played faster, I'm not sure -- I don't mean this is not a good performance; it certainly is.Bottomline: enthusiastically recommeneded. Plus, this DVD is sold so cheaply, it's a no-brainer.

510527,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B00001AQZD,I. Giles,"[5, 5]","This is a very important historical document in so far as it shows Karajan in a real concert situation as opposed to his various other `staged' productions of the same period. As a result we see far more of his evident enjoyment of the occasion and of the musical results he achieved with his orchestra as the concert proceeds. This, despite the obvious pain he is experiencing in this final part of his life evident as he is helped to the podium at the start of the concert.What we then see is close attention to every nuance of the delivery of the music. This is achieved through minimal gesture of hand, finger, eyebrow or glance. The idea that he conducted exclusively with his eyes shut is here disproved. Instead, as The Gramophone Magazine once remarked, `his gimlet eye' misses nothing and the players respond with complete concentration throughout.This is very much conductor in charge and not music making by group consensus. It is, of course, a bygone approach and typical of other such conductors - Reiner, Szell and others of that generation. It may also explain why so many of those earlier recordings by strong-willed conductors have survived into the modern age with interpretations that are revered as `classic' reference points.This recording is also priceless insofar as the greater playing part of the disc features a very young Kissin performing the Tchaikovsky 1st Piano concerto with utter concentration and composure coupled with musicianship and technical skill. It is a remarkable achievement and Karajan is with him in totally close support all the way. Where the balance of interpretation lay, Kissin's, Karajan's or a mutual collaboration, it is impossible to say. Sufficient to report that the performance is deeply satisfying on its own terms - as indeed it is in the Prokofiev symphony that precedes it.The recording is in completely serviceable sound for the period (1988). The imaging cannot deliver definition on long shots but is more than adequate for closer work which accounts for at least 95% of the total. For these technical reasons one has to drop a star but not for any other consideration. This is a fascinating record of an historically important time in the life of the B. P. O. with Karajan at the helm as well as documenting the emergence of one of the finest of the modern generation of pianists today. This disc is highly recommended on those terms therefore.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one.

Karajan is in very good mood despite the pain in his back that kept him leaning back  (instead of his customary forward position) in the special supporting  device prepared for him in the conductor's podium. The octave motif that  makes the main theme of the fisrt movement of Prokofiev's 1st is played  with almost comical accuracy, as if imitating Mozart. I never liked this  symphony before. Now, after listening this interpretation I really learned  to enjoy it. I have mixed feelings about the piano concerto. The young  Kissin (just a boy then) exudes so much adrenaline; you can see in the  little man's face the weight of being playing with the best orchestra in  the world, conducted by a living legend. He seems very aware that the last  recording of this concerto with Karajan-Berliner, was performed by no other  than Sviatoslav Richter. The performance, though, although not note  perfect, is very good. The only flaws were caused mostly by the boy excess  of energy. I listened this version on CD years ago, but in the video, the  boy generates such tension that it's almost distracting. The best part is  the last movement, were the boy's tension matches so well with the  character of the music. The final part is unforgettable, it keeps you at  the edge of the seat until the last chord.

Probably played five minutes longer than Horowitz or Gilels would have required. The break between the 2nd and 3rd movements surprised me.
