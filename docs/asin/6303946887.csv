Some non-latinos may say that the white people in the movie may be unfairly stereotyped as racist or that the hispanics may be unfairly stereotyped, unless you have a million dollars!  But is it stereotying, or is it a reflection of reality? Watch the movie and you decide!There are cameo appearances by Cheech Marin and a small, but important part played by Edward James Olmos.  The leading lady is a babe, but I have never seen her in any other movies.",3,"Funny, but may appear stereotypical to non-latinos",1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,614,"['story', 'mexican', 'american', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'birth', 'US', 'therefore', 'treated', 'illegal', 'alien', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'would', 'non-latinos', 'may', 'say', 'white', 'people', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'unfairly', 'stereotyped', 'racist', 'hispanics', 'may', 'be', 'unfairly', 'stereotyped', 'have', 'million', 'dollars', 'stereotying', 'reflection', 'reality', 'Watch', 'movie', 'decide', 'are', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'played', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'leading', 'lady', 'babe', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'movies']",Million to Juan VHS

As a result, it's very awkward and clumsy to watch. The only character that bears any credibility is Polly Draper's. She perfect for her role. Lovely, and a real pleasure to watch. But every moment away from her is too stereotypical to be taken serious, from Juan's pleading little boy, to Larry Linville giddy banker. This movie was actually a little embarrassing, to me at least. Here's the funny part: it's one of those so bad, I've watched it more than once. So to it's credit, this movie does have its appeal to certain audiences. This much I will say definitively: this is one of the worst movie title's of all time.",1,Below average movie with one of the all time worst titles.,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,752,"['sweet', 'kind', 'movie', 'Yes', 'touching', 'also', 'very', 'hammy', 'full', 'caricatures', 'cliches', 'developing', 'anything', 'result', 'very', 'awkward', 'clumsy', 'watch', 'only', 'character', 'credibility', 'Polly', 'Draper', 'perfect', 'role', 'Lovely', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'moment', 'away', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'Juan', 'pleading', 'little', 'boy', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'giddy', 'banker', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'embarrassing', 'least', 'Here', 'funny', 'part', 'one', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'So', 'credit', 'movie', 'have', 'appeal', 'certain', 'audiences', 'much', 'will', 'say', 'definitively', 'one', 'worst', 'movie', 'title', 'time']",Million to Juan VHS

Gubar ""Sports Car Enthusiast""","[0, 0]","Loosely based on a short story by Mark Twain called ""The 10,000 Pound Note"", ""A Million to Juan"" is updated for the 90's and set in East LA.  Paul Rodriquez stars as a single father who is given a million dollar check by a mysterious stranger with the stipulation that the check be returned.  So what good is it?  You'd be suprised! Employing a mostly Latino cast including Edward James Almos, Tony Plana, and Gerardo Mejia, Rodriguez explores a gentle, often comical and sometimes heartbreaking side to life that is mostly overlooked in today's films.In today's environment of ""gritty"", honest and mostly violent films, A Million To Juan"" should be treasured, and not to be missed.

You have this Hispanic widower(Rodriguez) raising his son with his brothers,battling dirty landlords,immigration issues,stereotypes,and the whole nine yards. He runs into a guy who hands him a check and the story runs from there. why I consider it a beautiful love story is due to the underplot with Juan and the Immigration lady(Polly Draper). Why I love it so much is because despite the stuff that Juan went through, he always had a dream, and he kept his head up no matter what. And he was a good father for his son. I just happened to catch this movie on cable some years back, and I became hooked.
