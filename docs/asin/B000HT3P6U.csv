1016206,A275HMOASH2BVX,B000HT3P6U,AlienZ,"[0, 0]","Season four has gotten both rave and bad reviews and mostly for the same reasons.  First of all Family guy is a hilarious poke at pop culture.  There is nothing that is sacred with them as I have reported in previous volumes.  Here the point, people try to read to much into the episodes thus they don't get the simplicity of the jokes, for example people complained about patriot games where Peter is recruited by Tom Brady to play for the Patriots and then traded to the london Silly nillys after to much show boating, Does this sound like anyone we know.  But the secondary story line is even funnier as Brian bets $50 on celebrity boxing with lone shark Stewie and then doesn't pay in time.  The abuse Stewie puts Brian trough is hilarious.  As is every other episode if you don't overthink it.

If you are familiar with the series enough and have seen all of the shows already, then what are you waiting for?  You need to add this to your collection!  If you are new to the show, then be warned, the humor contained within is not for impressionable kids or people who have a hard time with off-color humor on television.This collection contains the second half of the 4th season, 14 episdoes in all.  To say they are hilarious would be an understatement.  It's great to see the cameos from all the bit players from the first three seasons, before Fox shot themselves in the foot when they first cancelled the show.  Its resurrection continues to keep the fans happy and draws in new viewers every week.  Who can blame them, when we see Dubya cowering in a treehouse in Texas after a disaster hits.  What about when Quagmire decides to hang up the handcuffs (his rather raucous sex life) and settle down with a wife?  What will Peter do with the Indian skull he unearths in his backyard?  Can Brian control his drinking when he teams up with Frank Sinatra, Jr.?  Will Mayor Adam West's solid gold statue to Dig 'Em the Sugar Smacks frog continue to stand?As for the extras, the third disc is fairly well packed with a goodly amount of bonus material, including a great amount of deleted scenes.  (One in particular comes to mind, when the 'greased-up-deaf-guy' dresses as the Great American Hero for the 80's TV convention).  There are a couple of featurettes worth watching, too.  The bonuses round out a great and hysterical collection that could easily stand on its own without.

Family Guy is way, way better. I am a Simpson fan, but could never latch onto the other two. Family Guy is a show unlike no other I have seen. Very few shows can have a barrel full of laugh out loud moments in every episode. FG is one of those. After it's cancelation, FG came back stronger, funnier, and pushing the envelope more than ever. This second volume of season 4 episodes hits the mark every time. While The Simpsons is still funny, it can't match the outrageous, over the top lunacy and humor that FG has going. FG is filled with funny, interesting, endearing characters(unlike a Stone/Parker series, which apparently had an episode trying to kill FG off. Jealousy is an ugly thing). This box set is further proof that Seth MacFarlane know funny, and know it's audience. First off, let's go through the special features. The best thing about this set is that there are 5 uncensored episodes here. If Peter or whoever says the ""S"" word or drops the ""F"" bomb, you hear it. Peter Shin shows you how to draw Stewie. Adam West gets a tour of Family Guy central(by Mike Henry), and there is a featurette on directing the show. Now, the episodes themselves. There is a lot to be enjoyed here. ""PTV"" has Peter starting his own network after too much censoring on regular TV. A classic. ""The Fat Guy Strangler"" has Lois's brother visiting and revealing his penchant for stalking the obese. ""You May Know Kiss The..Uh...Guy Who Receives"" is filled with expected jokes about Brian's gay cousin getting married. There is a spoof of 'Poltergeist' in ""Petergeist"", and Brian The Dog heads back to campus in ""Brian Goes Back To College"", while Peter and his crew become the new A-Team. Good stuff. As usual, there are a number of commentaries on episode by cast and crew. The show is quite brilliant in it's execution of razor sharp jokes, pop culture references, and break aways to something that happened or something the characters did. This has always been a strong suit of the show, and it hasn't lost it's edge, or humor. FG continues to surprise me with some of the things they say and do. A lot of the time I can't believe they get away with it, unlike other shows who seem to do these things just for the noticeability factor and forget to factor the ""funny"" in. In the world of Peter Griffin and his brood, things can go on for many more years.

The features are pretty nice and it includes an uncensored audio track which is optional.BOXED SET:The front cover shows a nude Peter (he is revealed on the inside to have pants on) popping out of a cake with the rest of the Griffin clan standing around him in a celebratory manner. The back cover has some nice artwork with the usual description for the set including features and such.The Inside contains three thin plastic cases for each disc. With artwork of Peter slowly getting out of the cake (by the third cover he has fallen into the cake and splattered it! =D) The backside of these covers contains Episode Titles, their descriptions, airdate, and directors. It also has the bonus material that is included on that disc. For the first time, inside each disc case there is artwork pertaining to the episode ""PTV"" where everything gets censored. Each special inside artwork also has a somewhat funny quote on it.SLIM SET:The front and back cover are exactly the same. The slim set doesn't have a boxed set feel. It is just like a normal 2-Disc DVD case, but with an extra spot for disc 3. There's not as much artwork inside anymore and now it is only The Disc Number with Episode Titles that are on each disc. No more airdate and such things. Bonus material is still the same, however.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you don't mind having a slim set or you bought the slim set of Volumes 1-3, go ahead and order from amazon.If you really like the boxed set look better, or already have Volumes 1-3 in boxed sets, look for it on [...]Thanks for reading!",5,Family Guy Volume Four,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1826,"['review', 'Old', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'verison', 'new', 'Slim', 'Set', 'version.VOLUME', 'FOUR', 'IN', 'GENERAL', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Volume', 'Four', 'final', '14', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Four', 'Episodes', '28-30', 'are', 'unincluded', 'were', 'released', 'movie', 'Stewie', 'Griffin', 'Untold', 'Story', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'uncensored', 'audio', 'track', 'optional.BOXED', 'SET', 'front', 'cover', 'nude', 'Peter', 'revealed', 'inside', 'have', 'pants', 'popping', 'cake', 'rest', 'Griffin', 'clan', 'standing', 'celebratory', 'manner', 'back', 'cover', 'nice', 'artwork', 'usual', 'description', 'set', 'including', 'features', 'such.The', 'Inside', 'three', 'thin', 'plastic', 'cases', 'disc', 'artwork', 'Peter', 'slowly', 'getting', 'cake', 'third', 'cover', 'fallen', 'cake', 'splattered', '=D', 'backside', 'covers', 'contains', 'Episode', 'Titles', 'descriptions', 'airdate', 'directors', 'also', 'bonus', 'material', 'included', 'disc', 'first', 'time', 'disc', 'case', 'artwork', 'pertaining', 'episode', 'PTV', 'where', 'everything', 'censored', 'special', 'inside', 'artwork', 'also', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'quote', 'it.SLIM', 'SET', 'front', 'back', 'cover', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'slim', 'set', ""n't"", 'have', 'boxed', 'set', 'feel', 'just', 'normal', '2-Disc', 'DVD', 'case', 'extra', 'spot', 'disc', '3', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'artwork', 'anymore', 'now', 'only', 'Disc', 'Number', 'Episode', 'Titles', 'are', 'disc', 'more', 'airdate', 'such', 'things', 'Bonus', 'material', 'still', 'same', 'however.FINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'slim', 'set', 'bought', 'slim', 'set', 'Volumes', '1-3', 'go', 'ahead', 'order', 'amazon.If', 'really', 'boxed', 'set', 'look', 'better', 'already', 'have', 'Volumes', '1-3', 'boxed', 'sets', 'look', '[', ']', 'Thanks', 'reading']","Family Guy, Volume Four"

Sure there's jokes throughout this season that's funny but many of them don't even have the hilarity they had from previous seasons. This review will center on set highlights:Set opener ""PTV"" has Peter getting offended by the FCC's control over vulgarity and starts his own TV station filled with it, prompting the FCC to try to censor Peter himself. ""Brian Goes to College"" has him having to of course, go back to school, so he can get his job back at the New Yorker. ""The Father, The Son and the Holy Fonz"" has Peter starting a church dedicated to the Fonz when his dad shows up while Stewie's trapped in a Bubble Boy situation.""Brian Sings and Swings"" has Brian becoming a hit when he sings with Frank Sinatra Jr only to find himself hitting the bottle hard. Stewie's brother from Emissionary Impossible comes back and they both declare war on each other in ""Sibling Rivalry"". ""D*** Throats""(not sure if they'll censor it so...) has Brian trying to expose Mayor West as a fraud while Peter and Lois try to rekindle their musical days with marijuana.""Peterotica"" has Peter writing erotic novels but having to help his father-in-law when a lawsuit bankrupts him. ""You May Now Kiss the...Uh... Guy who Receives"" has Jasper trying to marry his boyfriend only West proposes a ban on gay marriage. In a great parody of Poltergeist, ""Petergeist"" has Stewie sucked into the TV when Peter finds a native skull and defiles it.One of the main selling points of the show was the random cutaways. Phrases like ""this is worse than that time than..."" or ""remember when..."" are very commonplace and they were pretty fun season 3 and before. Now it's as if they're random for the sake of being random. The show has this idea that by the joke's nature it should be funny. An example is Soundwave from Transformers showing up. He actually doesn't make a joke but it's as if just the very idea of Soundwave is supposed to be funny enough. Also the show seems to develop a taste for jokes that go on for too long. Fat guys in ""Fat Guy Strangler"" are featured for quite awhile and the scene itself wasn't even funny to begin with. Then we have Stewie violently going after Brian or barbershop singers singing about sexual harassment: the former was just not funny as a principle while the latter WAS funny until they focused on it excessively.Now if it sounds like I'm naysaying, I'm not. Many of the scenes were funny but many of the jokes just fell flat, just plain odd or repeated well beyond the funny zone. But if you're into the show, it's worth picking up anyway.",4,3.5; step-down from the first 3 seasons,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,2986,"['was', 'time', 'where', 'would', ""'ve"", 'defended', 'Family', 'Guy', 'one', 'more', 'funnier', 'shows', 'television', 'Sure', 'Simpsons', 'formula', 'unrelated', 'first', 'half', 'major', 'story', 'show', 'cutaways', 'least', 'many', 'were', 'just', 'outright', 'funny', 'were', 'resurrected', '8th', 'layer', 'Hell', 'known', 'Cancellation', 'seemed', 'trip', 'back', 'scared', 'now', ""'re"", 'just', 'resting', 'laurels', 'Sure', 'jokes', 'season', 'funny', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'hilarity', 'had', 'previous', 'seasons', 'review', 'will', 'center', 'set', 'highlights', 'Set', 'opener', 'PTV', 'Peter', 'getting', 'offended', 'FCC', 'control', 'vulgarity', 'own', 'TV', 'station', 'filled', 'prompting', 'FCC', 'try', 'censor', 'Peter', 'Brian', 'Goes', 'College', 'having', 'course', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'can', 'get', 'job', 'back', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Father', 'Son', 'Holy', 'Fonz', 'Peter', 'starting', 'church', 'dedicated', 'Fonz', 'when', 'dad', 'up', 'Stewie', 'trapped', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'situation', 'Brian', 'Sings', 'Swings', 'Brian', 'becoming', 'hit', 'when', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Jr', 'only', 'find', 'hitting', 'bottle', 'hard', 'Stewie', 'brother', 'Emissionary', 'Impossible', 'back', 'declare', 'war', 'other', 'Sibling', 'Rivalry', 'D***', 'Throats', 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'censor', 'so', 'Brian', 'trying', 'expose', 'Mayor', 'West', 'fraud', 'Peter', 'Lois', 'try', 'rekindle', 'musical', 'days', 'marijuana', 'Peterotica', 'Peter', 'writing', 'erotic', 'novels', 'having', 'help', 'father-in-law', 'when', 'lawsuit', 'May', 'Now', 'Uh', 'Guy', 'who', 'Jasper', 'trying', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'only', 'West', 'ban', 'gay', 'marriage', 'great', 'parody', 'Poltergeist', 'Petergeist', 'Stewie', 'sucked', 'TV', 'when', 'Peter', 'native', 'skull', 'it.One', 'main', 'selling', 'points', 'show', 'was', 'random', 'cutaways', 'Phrases', 'worse', 'time', 'remember', 'when', 'are', 'very', 'commonplace', 'were', 'pretty', 'fun', 'season', '3', 'Now', ""'re"", 'random', 'sake', 'being', 'random', 'show', 'idea', 'joke', 'nature', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'example', 'Soundwave', 'Transformers', 'showing', 'up', 'actually', ""n't"", 'make', 'joke', 'just', 'very', 'idea', 'Soundwave', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'enough', 'Also', 'show', 'develop', 'taste', 'jokes', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'Fat', 'guys', 'Fat', 'Guy', 'Strangler', 'are', 'featured', 'quite', 'awhile', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'begin', 'Then', 'have', 'Stewie', 'violently', 'going', 'Brian', 'barbershop', 'singers', 'singing', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'former', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'principle', 'latter', 'WAS', 'funny', 'focused', ""'m"", 'naysaying', ""'m"", 'not', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'funny', 'many', 'jokes', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'just', 'plain', 'odd', 'repeated', 'well', 'funny', 'zone', ""'re"", 'show', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'anyway']","Family Guy, Volume Four"

1016228,A17E28QEX42YU0,B000HT3P6U,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[0, 0]","Definitely a step down from season three, but still worth it. The second half of this volume is particularly weak for 'Family Guy', but I think most of us can forgive it, as we're well aware that MacFarlane had his new-born baby to groom whilst this season of the show laid way (the spawn being 'American Dad').The main reason I can't be too hard on the show, even amidst a lot of the mediocrity displayed on the DVD here, is because I really do love it. Even though it has been a powerful catalyst in the ever-growing, obscene nature of modern television, it has always to me remained endearing amongst its perverse humor. And by God, it surely is perverse by this point -- while not as subtly cynical as early 'Simpsons' or outrageously crass as current 'South Park', it finds itself somewhere in between the two. Personally, I really dig this fine line they walk; even though it is a completely desensitized, cruel show, one of the main reasons I always boot it back up is because of how much I love the Griffin family -- the show is edgy, but part of that edge comes in its hidden sentimentality. To again bring up early 'Simpsons' for comparison, 'Family Guy' might lack the overt humanity that involves one beyond the comedic aspects, but it still does captivate somewhat because its characters are so likable. To be more specific, the dynamics between Peter, Brian and Stewie form this bond, and it's not surprising that these just happen to be the three members of the household MacFarlane voices.One very cool feature is that every episode has a commentary now; the first few 'FG' DVD's only had a few select episodes. Yet, there might as well only have been a few. I only listened to a few commentaries on the discs, but they reflect my thoughts on a lot of 'FG'. The first I listened to was the disturbingly bizarre episode where we dive into the old perverted neighbor's fantasies about Chris, because I figured with such an awfully twisted subject, some interesting thoughts from its creators had to come from it... Nope. At one point, one of the guys says ""people who listen to these must have too much time on their hands; how could anybody listen to one of these?"". He then goes on to declare that the only commentary he's ever listened to was the cast & crew commentary of 'American Pie'........ Need I say more? MacFarlane, at least, attempts to rip him a new @#%h@le on the commentary for saying something as such so shamelessly, but the point is made... A lot of the guys working on this show aren't brilliant -- they're not even that funny; they're not that passionate or respecting of the work, either. If they all had been, the show probably wouldn't float in limbo so much as it does in this DVD -- when one man's dedication is split in two due to outside circumstances ('American Dad' in this case), that of the team should be able to hold the boat above water... But they can't. MacFarlane shouldn't be experimentally improving as much as he can be seen doing here, but you don't really have a choice when you're a one-man army without other creative input (and I don't mean to dismiss a few of the other great minds who DO contribute... something I'm obviously doing to gross effect).Redemptively, though, there ARE some awesome episodes on this DVD, and enough priceless moments within the collective 13 that I can overlook an enormous amount of jokes that derail completely. Surely Stewie's ""uncontrollable laugh"", as Brian calls it, is one of the funniest things I've -- ever -- seen (and probably one of those MacFarlane-experiments gone beautifully right). Or when Brian, on his first day as a Taxi Cab driver, nervously bypasses his first potential customer because he's black (Cleveland, who, after the fact, roars and rages in Brian's rear view mirror). There are at least two dozen of these individually beyond-hysterical moments, and it becomes a showcase of how the highest highs can completely overshadow long lengths of lows.",4,The MacFarlane Show,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,3965,"['Definitely', 'step', 'down', 'season', 'three', 'still', 'second', 'half', 'volume', 'particularly', 'weak', ""'Family"", 'Guy', 'think', 'most', 'can', 'forgive', ""'re"", 'well', 'aware', 'MacFarlane', 'had', 'new-born', 'baby', 'groom', 'whilst', 'season', 'show', 'laid', 'way', 'spawn', 'being', ""'American"", 'Dad', '.The', 'main', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'show', 'even', 'lot', 'mediocrity', 'displayed', 'DVD', 'here', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'Even', 'been', 'powerful', 'catalyst', 'ever-growing', 'obscene', 'nature', 'modern', 'television', 'always', 'remained', 'endearing', 'amongst', 'perverse', 'humor', 'God', 'surely', 'perverse', 'point', 'not', 'subtly', 'cynical', 'early', ""'Simpsons"", 'outrageously', 'crass', 'current', ""'South"", 'Park', 'somewhere', 'two', 'Personally', 'really', 'dig', 'fine', 'line', 'walk', 'even', 'completely', 'desensitized', 'cruel', 'show', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'always', 'boot', 'back', 'up', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Griffin', 'family', 'show', 'edgy', 'part', 'edge', 'hidden', 'sentimentality', 'again', 'bring', 'up', 'early', ""'Simpsons"", 'comparison', ""'Family"", 'Guy', 'might', 'lack', 'overt', 'humanity', 'one', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'still', 'captivate', 'somewhat', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'likable', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'dynamics', 'Peter', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'form', 'bond', 'not', 'surprising', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'three', 'members', 'household', 'MacFarlane', 'voices.One', 'very', 'cool', 'feature', 'episode', 'commentary', 'now', 'first', 'few', 'DVD', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'select', 'episodes', 'Yet', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'only', 'listened', 'few', 'commentaries', 'discs', 'reflect', 'thoughts', 'lot', ""'FG"", 'first', 'listened', 'was', 'disturbingly', 'bizarre', 'episode', 'where', 'dive', 'old', 'perverted', 'neighbor', 'fantasies', 'Chris', 'figured', 'such', 'awfully', 'twisted', 'subject', 'interesting', 'thoughts', 'creators', 'had', 'come', 'Nope', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'guys', 'people', 'who', 'listen', 'must', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'how', 'could', 'anybody', 'listen', 'one', 'then', 'declare', 'only', 'commentary', 'ever', 'listened', 'was', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentary', ""'American"", 'Pie', '..', 'Need', 'say', 'more', 'MacFarlane', 'least', 'attempts', 'rip', 'new', '@', '%', 'h', '@', 'le', 'commentary', 'saying', 'something', 'such', 'shamelessly', 'point', 'made', 'lot', 'guys', 'working', 'show', 'are', ""n't"", 'brilliant', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'funny', ""'re"", 'not', 'passionate', 'respecting', 'work', 'either', 'had', 'been', 'show', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'float', 'limbo', 'so', 'much', 'DVD', 'when', 'one', 'man', 'dedication', 'split', 'two', 'due', 'outside', 'circumstances', ""'American"", 'Dad', 'case', 'team', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'boat', 'water', 'ca', ""n't"", 'MacFarlane', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'experimentally', 'improving', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'doing', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'choice', 'when', ""'re"", 'one-man', 'army', 'other', 'creative', 'input', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'dismiss', 'few', 'other', 'great', 'minds', 'who', 'DO', 'contribute', 'something', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'doing', 'gross', 'effect', '.Redemptively', 'though', 'ARE', 'awesome', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'enough', 'priceless', 'moments', 'collective', '13', 'can', 'overlook', 'enormous', 'amount', 'jokes', 'derail', 'completely', 'Surely', 'Stewie', 'uncontrollable', 'laugh', 'Brian', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'one', 'MacFarlane-experiments', 'gone', 'beautifully', 'right', 'when', 'Brian', 'first', 'day', 'Taxi', 'Cab', 'driver', 'nervously', 'first', 'potential', 'customer', 'black', 'Cleveland', 'who', 'fact', 'roars', 'rages', 'Brian', 'rear', 'view', 'mirror', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'dozen', 'individually', 'beyond-hysterical', 'moments', 'showcase', 'how', 'highest', 'highs', 'can', 'completely', 'overshadow', 'long', 'lengths', 'lows']","Family Guy, Volume Four"

1016234,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000HT3P6U,Kaya Savas,"[40, 49]","REVIEW: Family Guy is one of the best shows on television. I am a huge fan and am so glad to see how far it has come. I smile every Sunday night because I know Family Guy will be on. I remember when it was cancelled, I remember doing online petitions, I remember sending emails, and I remember sending letters. Yes, Family Guy was that important to me. It was that rare breed of comedy that worked, that was hilarious, it was intelligent, and completely crude. The pop references are absolutely hilarious, and I'm sure everyone loves it when they get a pop reference and their friends don't. So if nothing else, Family Guy makes you feel smart.This 3 disc set is the second half of season 4 and is labeled as volume 4. In this set we truly have some of the funniest episodes to come from the series. ""Brian Goes Back To College"" is one the best episodes on this set and has some of the series' most quotable lines. Stewie and Brian make a large presence in these episodes and the writing is incredibly sharp. We have an amazing musical number where Peter and the New England Patriots perform ""Shipoopi"" from The Music Man. It truly is pure genius comedy. Fans of the show will snap this one up in no time and will get the most out of the episodes with constant references to the past seasons. Another bonus of this DVD is that there are so many restored scenes that are put back into the episodes that were originally cut due to time constraints.VIDEO: The difference between before the show got cancelled and after it came back on air is quite notable. The crew utilizes CGI in a few episodes and the image and animation gets better with every episode. The transfer is in 1.33:1 fullscreen and is absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to animation. Colors are sharp with no bleeding, the images are sharp.AUDIO: In terms of sound we get a really great 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. There are a lot of musical numbers in this volume and they seriously benefit from the surround mix. There is an optional censored audio track for those who are offended by the un-bleeped language.SPECIAL FEATURES: The highlight of the special features for me were definitely the commentaries. Honestly, I am not a commentary type of guy, I think they are uninvolving. However, I love television series commentaries, and no one gives better commentaries than the cast and crew of Family Guy. Seth MacFarlane gives so much info behind the jokes and the process of making the episodes. The writers and producers such as David Goodman and Mike Henry add lots of stuff too. The great thing about the commentaries are that they are f*cking hilarious. Seth and gang cuss, laugh, sometimes go into character, make fun of each other, yet still provide informative comments. Some episodes also have multi angled sequences to show the animation process in greater depth. On disc three is where you'll find the featurettes. There are over 40 deleted scenes, mostly cutaway and filler stuff, but there were some hilarious scenes. They are also completely finished and animated (lacking music and finished sound effects though), not just pre-visualizations like in previous sets. The ""Director's Life"" featurette is a look at how animation directors do their job and how their jobs differ from live action directors. Seth MacFarlane has nothing but respect for his directors, and this featurette is dedictated to the hard work they do on the show. The next little segment is animator Peter Shin doing a demonstration of how to draw Stewie. The final featurette is a behind the scenes look at the Family Guy offices. Adam West is toured through the offices by Mike Henry and we get to meet some of the great people behind the scenes, it's fun and entertaining. Overall, this set offers a great amount of new content that is on par with the past sets.BOTTOM LINE: Family Guy will make you laugh loud and hard.

1016242,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000HT3P6U,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[30, 31]","First off, what is with the selection screens?  I have to adjust my television just to read the options!  Anyway, several episodes here are up to the high standards of previous Family Guy seasons.  My favorites are ""PTV,"" ""The Fat Guy Strangler,"" ""Father, Son, and the Holy Fonz,"" and ""You May Now Kiss..."" (Jasper is funny).  Others, however, I found to be mediocre or just plain bad (""Patriot Games"").  There are not as many episodes I want to see over and over as there are on volumes 1-3, but this season is still good enough for 4 stars.  There are a lot of extras on disc 3, too.  44 deleted scenes and you can select all and have them play one after the other (some of these jokes are better than the ones that got left in the shows).  The featurettes are very interesting where many of the directors and artists are interviewed on what all is entailed in putting a show together. Also, these episodes are uncensored (there is an F-Bomb dropped or two) but there is a censored option (isn't it usually the other way around?).  Anyway, here are the episodes:Disc 1""PTV"": A wardrobe malfunction involving David Hyde Pierce at the Emmys causes the FCC to censor all tv--""The `bleep' Van `bleep' Show, Starring `bleep' Van `bleep.'  So Peter starts his own network featuring such highbrow programs as ""The Side-Boob Hour"" and ""Dogs Humping.""""Brian Goes Back to College"":  The New Yorker magazine is interested in Brian as a contributor but requires a college degree.  Brian had dropped out of Brown University. It's strange to think of an animated dog in this way, but I'd always thought Brian was so cool and together.  Hearing him lament about how he never finishes anything put a new spin on his character.""The Courtship of Stewie's Father"":  Chris works for that disgusting old man who likes young boys while Stewie and Peter bond over something they both enjoy immensely:  terrorizing Lois.  This episode almost makes one sympathize with that old pediaphile (well, almost).""The Fat Guy Strangler"":  My favorite of this volume.  Lois finds out she has a brother who went crazy after seeing their mother having relations with Jackie Gleason (hence his hatred of fat men).  Meanwhile, Peter makes the shocking discovery that he is fat and starts the NAAFP.""The Father, the Son and the Holy Fonz"":  Peter's father baptizes Stewie with tainted holy water and he has to be quarantined in a plastic bubble.  Meanwhile, Peter starts the church of the Fonz--""Please rise.....Now sit on it.""Disc 2:""Brian Sings and Swings"": A near-death experience causes Brian to feel he must live for the moment so he hooks up with Frank Sinatra Jr. as part of the New Rat Pack.  A funnier side story is Meg pretending to be a lesbian to be accepted into a club.""Patriot Games"":  This has to be the most stupidest Family Guy ever.  Peter meets Tom Brady and joins the New England Patriots (along side Diet Pepsi machine?) but is transferred to a London team for showboating. Meanwhile, Brian fails to pay a debt and Stewie gives him a beat-down mob-style.""I Take Thee Quagmire"":  Quagmire gets married and soon realizes it was a mistake.  Meanwhile, Lois is weaning Stewie but he finds he is addicted to breast milk.""Sibling Rivalry"":  Peter donates to a sperm bank and Stewie's rival baby is born (remember ""Emission Impossible""?).  Meanwhile, Peter stops having relations with Lois after his vasectomy and Lois gets fat.  I like that part.  Another highlight: Chris's shoebox diarrhea of the evolution of man.""Deep Throats"": After getting what he deemed to be an excessively high parking ticket, Brian wants to find dirt on Mayor West and sees him dating his young intern: Meg.Disc 3""Peterotica"": First off, that Quagmire stuff in the beginning is very annoying.  Anyway, Peter writes erotic novels and uses Lois's father's name as the publishing company.  When someone gets into a car accident listening to Peter's book on tape (read by Betty White), Mr. Pewterschmidt loses everything and must move in with the Griffins.""You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives"":  (You get it?  Hahaha).  Brian's gay cousin Jasper plans on marrying his partner but Brian first must fight Mayor Wests' ban on gay marriage.""Petergeist"":  Peter digs in the yard and finds an Indian skull and weird things start to happen.  Part of the plot is similar to that Simpsons Treehouse of Horrors where a 3D Homer is stuck in another dimension.""The Griffin Family History"":  The Griffins are stuck in a panic room while their house is being robbed so Peter tells them stories of his ancestors Nate the slave, Willie ""Black-Eyed"" Griffin the silent comedy star, and Peter H*tler who was the brother of...yeah.",4,"""Why do we

The episodes contained in this collection, under the title of Season 4 Part 2, feature the same kind of bawdy lunacy you'd come to expect from the residents of Quahog.  In these episodes, Peter creates his own religion dedicated to the Fonz while Stewie has to live in a plastic bubble after being baptised by tainted holy water (yes, you read that right), Lois decides to stop breast feeding Stewie later on, and Stewie ends up going to war with his just as power hungry brother Bertram (voiced by Wallace Shawn).  Quagmire is in fine form as well in these episodes (giggity!) as well, as he comes close to getting married to a psychotic bride (Nicole Sullivan).  There's plenty of laugh out loud moments, as you would come to expect from the series, and even though by now the joke conventions have worn thin (as they were brilliantly spoofed on South Park), the way that they are weaved into the stories are still nicely done, and still oh so funny.

1016249,A3QJT3VQ5ZA8FB,B000HT3P6U,"WayneXtreme ""Reading Fiend""","[16, 17]","I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this collection since the end of the 3rd volume.  But instead of boring you with all my details here it is, my review.I received this edition for Christmas, actually, I received the Target Collector's Edition.  With this edition (along with the DVD's) comes a book of Artist Series Postcards containing pictures of Peter, Quagmire, 2 of Brian, 2 of Stewie, a postcard of Peter and Brian, and a postcard featuring Meg.  This edition also comes with 3 storyboard cards, one from each of the 3 previously released volumes (""If I'm Dyin' I'm Lyin'"" from Volume 1; ""Lethal Weapons"" from Volume 2, and ""North by North Quahog"" from Volume 3).The edition also contains the uncernsored tracks to five of the episodes, though there isn't really much difference in adding those tracks in my opinion.  Was a little surprised to hear the F-word a couple of times, but that was all.The episodes contained on this volume are...Disc 1:PTV: Television has been heavily censored by the FCC, Peter takes action by performing his own ""as nature intended"" channel.  This leads the FCC to take more drastic action censoring the people of Quahog themselves.Brian Goes Back to College: After being snubbed by the staff of The New Yorker for not graduating, Brian returns to college to get his degree.  All the while, Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire, form the ""new"" A-Team.The Courtship of Stewie's Father: Chris breaks one of old man Herbert's windows and must do chores in order to pay back his debt.  Stewie and Peter start hanging out with each other doing their most favorite activity, tormenting Lois.The Fat Guy Strangler: Lois finds out that she has a long lost brother living in an insane asylum, but is haunted by his troubled past.  Peter creates the NAAFP (Natinal Association for the Advancement of Fat People).The Father The Son, and The Holy Fonz: Peter's devout Catholic father returns for a visit and Peter decides to create his own religion for worshippers of ""The Fonz"".Disc 2:Brian Sings and Swings: Following a car accident, Briand falls into a deep depression, but is quickly brought out of it by meeting and singing with Frank Sinatra Jr in a local nightclub.Patriot Games: During his 25-year high school reunion, Peter meets Patriots QB Tom Brady who recruits Peter for the team because of his runing skills.I Take Thee Quagmire: After Peter wins a week of free maid service on a game show, Quagmire falls in love for the maid, and they soon plan to wed.  Until Quagmire, learns about that his bride to be is a few fries short of a happy meal.Sibling Rivalry: Nine months after a mishap at the sperm bank, Stewie's half brother Bertram is born to a lesbian couple and the two battle it out for world domination.Deep Throats: After Meg lands an internship in the Mayor's Office, Brian and Stewie go undercover in an attempt to expose Mayor West.Disc 3:Peterotica: Peter becomes a best selling novelist for erotica, but ruins his father-in-law after a book of Peter's is published on tape resulting in a big lawsuit.You May Now Kiss The ...Uh...Guy Who Receives: Brian's gay cousin comes to visit the family, bringing his fiance along with him.  After the two decide to marry, a same-sex marriage ban is proposed as Brian works ferersihly to reverse Mayor's West decision.Petergeist: Peter disturbs an ancient burial site in an attempt to one-up Joe after he gets his new home theater system.  The spirit of the dead indian leader then wreaks havoc on the Griffin family.The Griffin Family History: After burglars break into the Griffin house, the family hides in a panic room.  Now faced with imminent death, Peter retells the history of the family in their last hours of life.And that's all of the episodes that come along with this volume.  However, with my edition, I received a special bonus disc with a sneak peek at Seth Macfarlane's new show ""The Winner"".  It also contains an episode of American Dad: Roger 'N' Me.I really enjoyed this volume of Family Guy and look forward to more seasons from this great show.",5,A Freaking Sweet Collection,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,4065,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'release', 'collection', 'end', '3rd', 'volume', 'instead', 'boring', 'details', 'here', 'review.I', 'received', 'edition', 'Christmas', 'actually', 'received', 'Target', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'edition', 'DVD', 'book', 'Artist', 'Series', 'Postcards', 'containing', 'pictures', 'Peter', 'Quagmire', '2', 'Brian', '2', 'Stewie', 'postcard', 'Peter', 'Brian', 'postcard', 'featuring', 'Meg', 'edition', 'also', '3', 'storyboard', 'cards', 'one', '3', 'previously', 'released', 'volumes', ""'m"", 'Dyin', ""'m"", 'Lyin', 'Volume', '1', 'Lethal', 'Weapons', 'Volume', '2', 'North', 'North', 'Quahog', 'Volume', '3', '.The', 'edition', 'also', 'uncernsored', 'tracks', 'five', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'difference', 'adding', 'tracks', 'opinion', 'Was', 'little', 'surprised', 'hear', 'F-word', 'couple', 'times', 'was', 'all.The', 'episodes', 'contained', 'volume', 'are', 'Disc', '1', 'PTV', 'Television', 'been', 'heavily', 'censored', 'FCC', 'Peter', 'action', 'performing', 'own', 'nature', 'intended', 'channel', 'FCC', 'take', 'more', 'drastic', 'action', 'censoring', 'people', 'Quahog', 'themselves.Brian', 'Goes', 'Back', 'College', 'being', 'snubbed', 'staff', 'New', 'Yorker', 'not', 'graduating', 'Brian', 'college', 'get', 'degree', 'while', 'Peter', 'Joe', 'Cleveland', 'Quagmire', 'form', 'new', 'A-Team.The', 'Courtship', 'Stewie', 'Father', 'Chris', 'one', 'old', 'man', 'Herbert', 'windows', 'must', 'do', 'chores', 'order', 'pay', 'back', 'debt', 'Stewie', 'Peter', 'start', 'hanging', 'out', 'other', 'doing', 'most', 'favorite', 'activity', 'tormenting', 'Lois.The', 'Fat', 'Guy', 'Strangler', 'Lois', 'out', 'long', 'lost', 'brother', 'living', 'insane', 'asylum', 'haunted', 'troubled', 'past', 'Peter', 'NAAFP', 'Natinal', 'Association', 'Advancement', 'Fat', 'People', 'Father', 'Son', 'Holy', 'Fonz', 'Peter', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'father', 'returns', 'visit', 'Peter', 'create', 'own', 'religion', 'worshippers', 'Fonz', '2', 'Brian', 'Sings', 'Swings', 'Following', 'car', 'accident', 'Briand', 'deep', 'depression', 'quickly', 'brought', 'out', 'meeting', 'singing', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Jr', 'local', 'nightclub.Patriot', 'Games', '25-year', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'Peter', 'Patriots', 'QB', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'who', 'Peter', 'team', 'runing', 'skills.I', 'Take', 'Thee', 'Quagmire', 'Peter', 'week', 'free', 'maid', 'service', 'game', 'show', 'Quagmire', 'love', 'maid', 'soon', 'plan', 'wed.', 'Quagmire', 'bride', 'be', 'few', 'fries', 'short', 'happy', 'meal.Sibling', 'Rivalry', 'Nine', 'months', 'mishap', 'sperm', 'bank', 'Stewie', 'half', 'brother', 'Bertram', 'born', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'two', 'battle', 'out', 'world', 'domination.Deep', 'Throats', 'Meg', 'internship', 'Mayor', 'Office', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'go', 'undercover', 'attempt', 'expose', 'Mayor', 'West.Disc', '3', 'Peterotica', 'Peter', 'best', 'selling', 'novelist', 'erotica', 'father-in-law', 'book', 'Peter', 'published', 'tape', 'resulting', 'big', 'lawsuit.You', 'May', 'Now', 'Uh', 'Guy', 'Who', 'Brian', 'gay', 'cousin', 'visit', 'family', 'bringing', 'fiance', 'two', 'decide', 'marry', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'ban', 'proposed', 'Brian', 'ferersihly', 'reverse', 'Mayor', 'West', 'decision.Petergeist', 'Peter', 'ancient', 'burial', 'site', 'attempt', 'one-up', 'Joe', 'new', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'spirit', 'dead', 'indian', 'leader', 'then', 'havoc', 'Griffin', 'family.The', 'Griffin', 'Family', 'History', 'burglars', 'break', 'Griffin', 'house', 'family', 'panic', 'room', 'Now', 'faced', 'imminent', 'death', 'Peter', 'history', 'family', 'last', 'hours', 'life.And', 'episodes', 'come', 'along', 'volume', 'However', 'edition', 'received', 'special', 'bonus', 'disc', 'sneak', 'peek', 'Seth', 'Macfarlane', 'new', 'show', 'Winner', 'also', 'episode', 'American', 'Dad', 'Roger', 'N', 'Me.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'volume', 'Family', 'Guy', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'seasons', 'great', 'show']","Family Guy, Volume Four"
