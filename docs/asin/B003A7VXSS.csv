1334697,AAZRWLML88IZK,B003A7VXSS,A kids review,"[7, 8]","Standard movie runtime has been universally accepted at 90 to 120 minutes. Expand beyond that and you better give up the goods -- robots, or war, or time travel, or stories of unrequited transdimensional love triangles. But a 237 minute movie about the art of upskirt photography? Now that's bold. Such is the case with Love Exposure, a 2008 film by Sion Sono that has charming topics like lust, religion, and coming of age in a world where being a panty shot photographer is a normal thing. The film has had a long run of success at festivals, but its odd topic and story have kept it from reaching any audience in America -- until now. It is now on dvd and I would urge everybody to rent this film.",5,Love Exposure,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,700,"['Standard', 'movie', 'runtime', 'been', 'universally', 'accepted', '90', '120', 'minutes', 'Expand', 'better', 'give', 'up', 'goods', 'robots', 'war', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'unrequited', 'transdimensional', 'love', 'triangles', '237', 'minute', 'movie', 'art', 'upskirt', 'photography', 'Now', 'bold', 'Such', 'case', 'Love', 'Exposure', '2008', 'film', 'Sion', 'Sono', 'charming', 'topics', 'lust', 'religion', 'coming', 'age', 'world', 'where', 'being', 'panty', 'shot', 'photographer', 'normal', 'thing', 'film', 'had', 'long', 'run', 'success', 'festivals', 'odd', 'topic', 'story', 'have', 'kept', 'reaching', 'audience', 'America', 'now', 'now', 'dvd', 'would', 'urge', 'everybody', 'rent', 'film']",Love Exposure (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Region 2]

One scan of the internet (including IMDB and Sion's home page) will confirm that Sion has a massive list of movies under his belt, with more coming, and so far I can only find seven of his movies on DVD in the US. It took us late into 2011 before Love Exposure (released in Japan in 2008) was even released as a US region code DVD, and even before that it was hard to find at all, let alone for a fair price, in other region codes. A three year wait for a hot commodity? Someone is sleeping on the job.Oh, but you wanted to read about the movie right?Love Exposure, like all Sion movies, is impossible to learn about from reading the back of the box or any review anyone can write about it. The basic description is something like this...Yu becomes tired of fabricating sins he didn't commit in order to please his father, a crazy priest who reprimands Yu whenever he DOESN'T do things wrong. So Yu starts committing every sin he can, joining a street gang and eventually, to really prove to his dad he's a sinner, becomes a peek-a-panty photographer. Things become complicated when he meets his dream girl, Yoko, in the midst of a street fight and now must win her heart.Yeah, ""things get complicated"" alright. That's the understatement of the century. After all of the above happens we still have about three hours left in the film. Let's just say Yu's ""I want to sin so I can confess"" perspective gets him into a fair bit of trouble, not the least of which is drawing the attention of a cult promoter who takes a special interest in him.And all the while, Yu keeps his focus on Yoko, despite everything that happens to him as a result, including her relentless scorn toward him, which only increases as he tries even harder to win her over. But will he succeed...?Yep. It's a love movie. Love is not an alien concept in Sion's movies but in this one it is the thread that connects everything that happens through all 237 minutes of the film. This is 237 minutes without a single dull moment, mind you, so if you're adverse to watching a four hour film just free up your schedule and go for it. It's worth it.American romance movies, suck on this. Oh, and I'll take more Sion movies, please and thank you.",5,Sion's best in 2008,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2333,"['First', 'Sion', 'movies', 'are', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'slowly', 'trickling', 'US', 'bit', 'annoying', 'One', 'scan', 'internet', 'including', 'IMDB', 'Sion', 'home', 'page', 'will', 'confirm', 'Sion', 'massive', 'list', 'movies', 'belt', 'more', 'coming', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'seven', 'movies', 'DVD', 'US', 'took', 'late', '2011', 'Love', 'Exposure', 'released', 'Japan', '2008', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'US', 'region', 'code', 'DVD', 'even', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'let', 'alone', 'fair', 'price', 'other', 'region', 'codes', 'three', 'year', 'wait', 'hot', 'commodity', 'Someone', 'sleeping', 'job.Oh', 'wanted', 'read', 'movie', 'right', 'Love', 'Exposure', 'Sion', 'movies', 'impossible', 'learn', 'reading', 'back', 'box', 'review', 'anyone', 'can', 'write', 'basic', 'description', 'something', 'Yu', 'tired', 'fabricating', 'sins', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'order', 'please', 'father', 'crazy', 'priest', 'who', 'Yu', 'whenever', ""N'T"", 'do', 'things', 'wrong', 'So', 'Yu', 'starts', 'committing', 'sin', 'can', 'joining', 'street', 'gang', 'eventually', 'really', 'prove', 'dad', 'sinner', 'peek-a-panty', 'photographer', 'become', 'complicated', 'when', 'dream', 'girl', 'Yoko', 'midst', 'street', 'fight', 'now', 'must', 'win', 'heart.Yeah', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'alright', 'understatement', 'century', 'above', 'still', 'have', 'three', 'hours', 'left', 'film', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Yu', 'want', 'sin', 'so', 'can', 'confess', 'perspective', 'fair', 'bit', 'trouble', 'not', 'least', 'drawing', 'attention', 'cult', 'promoter', 'who', 'special', 'interest', 'him.And', 'while', 'Yu', 'focus', 'Yoko', 'everything', 'result', 'including', 'relentless', 'scorn', 'only', 'even', 'harder', 'win', 'over', 'will', 'succeed', 'Yep', 'love', 'movie', 'Love', 'not', 'alien', 'concept', 'Sion', 'movies', 'one', 'thread', 'everything', '237', 'minutes', 'film', '237', 'minutes', 'single', 'dull', 'moment', 'mind', 'so', ""'re"", 'adverse', 'watching', 'four', 'hour', 'film', 'just', 'free', 'up', 'schedule', 'go', 'worth', 'it.American', 'romance', 'movies', 'suck', 'Oh', ""'ll"", 'take', 'more', 'Sion', 'movies', 'please', 'thank']",Love Exposure (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Region 2]

Some of the main themes such as religion, cult and sexuality are brought in to the forefront.  If you are uncomfortable with these controversial themes at all, this probably isn't the movie for you.  Were a rating to be released in the US for this movie, it would probably be an R or higher.  That being said, these themes are acknowledged tastefully and with a purpose.The characterization is beautiful and the acting is so breathtaking.  It's no surprise that Love Exposure won 14 awards and was nominated for 2 others.The storyline follows three characters, teenagers who have been abused by their parents.  The main male character, Yu, is a devout Catholic whose father entered priesthood after the death of their wife and mother.  However, his father becomes involved with a woman who eventually runs off.  His father changes and forces Yu to come to confessionals every day and force him to confess sins that he didn't commit.  Yu is forced to lie to his father but when he is discovered, he feels he must actually commit sins so he won't lie be lying to his father.  These sins become more and more heinous until finally he starts taking sneak pictures up girl's dresses.  He doesn't take these pictures to be turned on, but instead to merely have sins he can confess.One day, his friends dare him to dress as a woman and go kiss a girl he likes.  He helps to save a girl, Yoko, from thugs and kisses her before he runs away.  His life takes a turn when his father's lover returns with Yoko in two and the two become adopted siblings.  However, there is someone on the outside, the third character, who is craftily maneuvering their lives so as to induct them into the cult religion, the Zero Church.  It's up to Yu to maintain his own faith as he travels through the underworld in order to find the third girl out and save his family from being converted into the cult.This story is twisted from start to finish and the cinematography is well-thought out and gorgeous.  The movie is four hours long, but flies by.  Every second is filled with a fantastic romance meets comedy meets thriller storyline.  I rate the story five stars out of five.  This movie has easily become one of my favorite films of all time.",5,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2300,"['First', 'feel', 'must', 'give', 'warning', 'potential', 'watchers', 'film', 'main', 'themes', 'such', 'religion', 'cult', 'sexuality', 'are', 'brought', 'forefront', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'controversial', 'themes', 'probably', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Were', 'rating', 'be', 'released', 'US', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'R', 'higher', 'being', 'said', 'themes', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'tastefully', 'purpose.The', 'characterization', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'so', 'breathtaking', 'surprise', 'Love', 'Exposure', 'won', '14', 'awards', 'was', 'nominated', '2', 'others.The', 'storyline', 'three', 'characters', 'teenagers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'abused', 'parents', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'Yu', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'father', 'entered', 'priesthood', 'death', 'wife', 'mother', 'However', 'father', 'involved', 'woman', 'who', 'eventually', 'off', 'father', 'changes', 'forces', 'Yu', 'come', 'confessionals', 'day', 'force', 'confess', 'sins', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'Yu', 'forced', 'lie', 'father', 'when', 'discovered', 'must', 'actually', 'commit', 'sins', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'be', 'lying', 'father', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'heinous', 'finally', 'taking', 'sneak', 'up', 'girl', 'dresses', ""n't"", 'take', 'pictures', 'be', 'turned', 'instead', 'merely', 'have', 'sins', 'can', 'confess.One', 'day', 'friends', 'dare', 'dress', 'woman', 'go', 'kiss', 'girl', 'save', 'girl', 'Yoko', 'thugs', 'away', 'life', 'turn', 'when', 'father', 'lover', 'returns', 'Yoko', 'two', 'two', 'become', 'adopted', 'siblings', 'However', 'someone', 'outside', 'third', 'character', 'who', 'craftily', 'maneuvering', 'lives', 'so', 'induct', 'cult', 'religion', 'Zero', 'Church', 'up', 'Yu', 'maintain', 'own', 'faith', 'underworld', 'order', 'find', 'third', 'girl', 'save', 'family', 'being', 'converted', 'cult.This', 'story', 'twisted', 'start', 'finish', 'cinematography', 'well-thought', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'flies', 'Every', 'second', 'filled', 'fantastic', 'romance', 'meets', 'comedy', 'meets', 'thriller', 'storyline', 'rate', 'story', 'five', 'stars', 'five', 'movie', 'easily', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time']",Love Exposure (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Region 2]
