It sounded like it was from a child. No way would an older woman's voice sounds like that. I like it how Devon's character has to understand his new and emerging feelings, and realize that he's not the only one that feels that way. It's nice to know that his soon to be ex-girlfriend is the understanding type. She's even involved in the end when it comes to uncovering the truth about Devon's step-dad. That's a true friend.I felt so bad seeing Brian in such a bad shape when Devon rescued him after he was beaten up. I was gonna cry. He said that he was raped and that's just one topic that always gets me. My heart just goes out to the victim. I'm glad that earlier in the movie he becomes willing to share his feelings more with Devon, and actually calls him back after they get into their first fight. Brian cried once he hung up the phone and that always shows a more sensitive part of the man and that's such a turn on for me.Good movie...I've seen better when it comes to acting, but it was still good. I'm glad that I bought it, but would've liked to have seen more of the Devon and Brian relationship. Oh well. Good job.

1000745,A2SXQBMWCYNMX7,B000GALHQK,D. C. Mappin,"[8, 10]","I am not sure what the filmmakers of this train wreck were striving for when they made this low budget movie. I think the film is nothing more than an excuse to film young male actors nude. The film wants to be something it is not--it wants to be a mystery film when in reality it is a no-class softcore porn flick. To call this movie cinema is an insult to filmmakers and to viewers fooled into watching it!Needless to say I think this film has few, if any, redeeming features. Where to begin? The plot is weak asking us to believe in characters doing things that no one with one ounce of logic would do (for example, the mother leaves home for a few days to visit an aunt knowing her husband recently slugged her son in the face without provocation).I did not believe for one single moment any of the situations that were happening. The acting? Hmmm. Okay, I'll give the two young male leads some credit here. They made the best of a bad situation. In fact, most of the the young actors were passable (just passable), however, the adults are another story entirely. I would venture the entire movie's dialogue, especially the well-intentioned actress playing ""Devon's"" mother, was looped. The voices don't sound right. The acting ability of the actor portraying the step-father was about as subtle as the smell of a fertilizer plant... i.e., he reeked!This movie has cardboard characters possessing no real sense of believability. For those who claim this movie is camp is doing that genre a disservice. I read a few reviews that complained that the young male actors weren't hot enough-- what a ridiculous notion! Those comments miss the point of this film entirely. This was not supposed to be a story about hot men, but about teen exploitation. In effect, what this story tries to warn the viewer against is exactly what the film becomes. The actors were used and used badly by this film's production team.I lay the blame entirely at the feet of the producer, the writer and director. This amatuer drivel is the worst kind of schlock available to buyers. I could go on and on about how bad this movie truly is. As a writer I can say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Save your money. There are pleny of other gay-themeed films that are worthy of your money and your time. It is not often a film makes me so angry. Stay away from this one!",1,"What a piece of crap!

Even judging by the worst porn industry standards, this is a crappy film. It's like a bad porn, without the sex.There's a formula for this sort of mess. Start with a cast of nondescript to unattractive boys that can't act their way out of a paper bag. Add about three mature actors that obviously never got hired for anything in Hollywood that got them closer than a half mile from a camera. Mix them in a large, tired plot. And sprinkle with lousy music. Then tie your audience down for an hour or so of torture. Even for soft porn, this was disappointing. And generally speaking, I can manage to enjoy a little soft porn, no matter how bad the plot or the acting. Maybe that's because even the worst soft porn films find cute actors to take your mind off the sex you won't be seeing. You feel like you get a little eye candy. Something pleasing to watch.

1000747,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GALHQK,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","Steven Vasquez directed and co-wrote with James Townsend, the star, this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions: make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller.  So why doesn't it work?For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film, dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters.  Not that that is a bad thing: it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes.  The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder.  It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.Devon (James Townsend) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna (Sarah Kelly) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian (Alex Wilson) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level.  They bond, Devon comes out, and the mysteries begin: boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devon's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Dan Swett) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon's consoling mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship.  It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl McDougle) who apparently is investigating the missing boys...  Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick.  And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc.Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye (and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently!) but the degree of acting is at an all time low.  The only thing that makes us forgive that (and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved.  Yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his trade.  But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level.  Maybe their next one will be more polished.

From the very first scene, I was hooked. Not only is it full of total hotties (most appearring in the movie naked at least once!), but the story is great. Everytime I thought I had someone/something figured out, another loop was thrown into the path of things. Moer gay movies need to be like this-- erotic but with a solid story and good talent.

Some of the supporting characters are terrific and do deserve larger roles in any upcoming projects they may be a part of. To add to it all, the erotic aspect of the film is very pleasing. It is so great to see a gay film with erotic content done in a tasteful way. I enjoy how it shows you a lot sexually, but at the same time leaves that much more to the imagination.

The countless eye-candy in the movie can be blamed for that! This is how I like my movies. Sideline Secrets is the perfect blend of eroticism, twists and more. If you like erotic films that push the boundaries with their sex scenes but still come across very tasteful, this is one to get. It is not porn (which is a very good thing), so dont be mistaken if that is your cup of tea. The teenage characters all feel very real. Devon's confusion, depression, timidness to accept happiness is all legit. He is the persona of what a lot of young kids, coming out with their sexuality, not in the best atmosphere, experience. The characters' emotions and personalities are all accurate and feel real because of it. I for one would love to see a sequel. I think there is a lot of story we dont know yet as a viewer. Yes-- why is Devon's mom eastern european? Does the villian come back? Is there more to Nicole and Andrew that we don't know about yet? What truly happens with Devon and Brian's romance? I like to think they are all questions that are left open for a sequel! Turn off the lights, grab a pillow and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.

It is truly a ""little engine that could""! It is easy to point finger and knock down points for a film because it is low budget and stuff, but there really isn't much room to do so with this one. Sideline Secrets takes a few seeds and manages to plant an entire orchard. What I am saying is the fact that this film does best with what it has and in the end it comes out as a true winner. The actors are great. All adorable! I think we will be seeing some of them in bigger projects in the near future as they clearly have a passion and comfort for what they do. The story is very dark. It touches upon a lot of controversial subject matter involving molestation, rape, physical abuse, alcoholism, and more. But, dont get too frightened, although much of the subject matter is serious, the movie knows how to tie it all into a somewhat complicated yet very entertaining story. The romantic story at the core in nice to see. I am glad to see movies like this climbing the charts (right now being #2 on this site). For me it is no wonder why.

Poking fun at itself, in good manner, with dialogue such as ""and how come we never get to see the guy's dick?!"" then cutting to a full frontal shower shot.... venturing into campy Nancy Drew type mystery and much more, it is a very entertaining piece of work. The young actors all have something great going for them! James Townsend comes across very natural as the innocent high schooler struggling with realizations of himself. Brandon Alexander is hysterical as the drag queen. Summer Smith steals every scene, as the comedic and very ""open"" lesbian friend... Sarah Kelly has a presence about her that makes you want to have her as your best fag-hag! She is beyond sweet and possesses something many young hollywood actresses lack. Reading reviews on other sites, some people have made comment of certain adult characters being a little weak. But, I have to disagree, the film isnt necessarily about the adults, but moreso about how the teens view their changing world, and react to the pressures thrown against them. The adults may seem a little distant, out of character, but it works for me! The films does its best with what it has to work with. Obviously the budget was very low, but in many scenes, you would have no clue of such. The film is done very professionally with a lot of attention to detail. Pay close attention to a pink squirrel that pops up in unexpected places, the pink color schemes to much of the film, etc. I have a feeling that in the years to come, In The Pink Productions will be a studio to keep a very close eye on. They will be doing some great stuff once they have the resources to do so... As for the erotic content in the film... simply stated-- HOT HOT HOT!!! You may have some trouble containing yourself...""Great fun and cute bodies""DVDwhore wrote:A very pleasant surprise! Although not perfect, the film, coming from the small budget it does, and managing to make use of everything in a very collaborative effort, is great fun! ""Sideline Secrets"" is one of those wonderful films you can toss on in the company of a bunch of friends and just have fun with. It has been awhile since I have enjoyed a film of such level in such a long time. I very much enjoyed everything about it. What starts out as a sweet coming-of-age tale of the adorable Devon (James Townsend) coming to terms with his sexuality amongst the pressures of his girlfriend (Sarah Kelly) and high school, soon takes a turn into being a campy mystery that keeps you guessing till the end. No one is really quite who they seem-- as each character possesses some secret of their own, one way or another. The challenge of keeping the film light, yet dealing with such dark subject matter is handled with much intellect. For, the film is full of wonderful comedic and romantic moments. Yet, it also deals with serious issues such as rape, molestation, sexual abuse and more. You find yourself falling in love with the characters... feeling their happiness, sadness and fears. The young cast is terrific! I can easily see a number of the actors (both male and female) moving on to much larger films in the future. This film does indeed possess much talent. The chemistry between the characters of Devon (Townsend) and Brian (Alex Wilson) is terrific as you watch their relationship grow from awkward nervousness, to first-love romance. Perfect pair! On another level, the film does contain quite a bit of nudity. It is all very well done and is not afraid to explore the issue. Some of the nudity/sexual situations are erotic, downright HOT!!! showing just enough, leaving much to the imagination-- very typical of scenes you would see in something like a Queer as Folk episode... while others are included to make you feel a sense of dread and discomfort for those involved-- not afraid to show it all, and in thus push forth a sense of pure reality. It works amazingly, hitting its target each time. I must say, it is nice to see strong story lines willing to cross the erotic-line without becoming full-fledged porn. We are seeing it more and more lately. So many straight-films get away with it-- take it for granted. It is time, that gay cinema gets its share as well in such a caliber as this. On a negative level, the film does suffer some sound problems-- which is typical of such low-budget films. However, it does not take away from the story at all. There may be a word here and there that doesn't exactly match up with the actors moving lips, and you may encounter the buzz of room ambiance in a scene, yet it is nothing to worry about. This too happens in many big-budget films. On another note, it would have been great to see more of a relationship between Brian and his best friend, Shawn, who pops into the movie every once in awhile. The movie is also filled with plenty of homages, tributes (whatever they may be called) to a lot of pop culture, films, icons, etc. Very nice touches that add to the fun... I definitely had to giggle in seeing that the film takes place in Ciccone, CA... (Ciccone, correct me if I am wrong-- being Madonna's last name?)... there are quite a few David Lynch references (streets, the way the nightclub is presented in subtitles in the earlier part of the film, etc), and an Adam & Eve type idea where Devon and Brian share an apple before all hell breaks loose in the story!!! All subtle touches that easily bring a smile. Overall, Sideline Secrets is great! I can't wait to get this movie and watch it with friends. So, when is the sequel?!Very Good Sexual Identity ThrillerArt wrote:I saw this film as screener and it was very good. The story has a number of plot twist that are unexpected which definately keeps the viewers interest. The lead character, Devon, is struggling with his sexual identity, while also dealing with a turbulant home life due to an evil step-father. Though there is plenty of nudity in this film, it is not the nudity that makes this one a stand-out effort for Director Steven Vasquez and Screenwriter James Townsend, who also plays the lead role. The storyline takes some unexpected turns, that you will have to get this one to see how Devon fairs in the end. Does he get the boy or does he fall victim to the evil around him? I give this one three and a half stars.ImpressedMovieWatcher1383 wrote:I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to watching ""Sideline Secrets"". A friend had invited me to a screening of the film in Los Angeles, and to say the least my expectations were low for a film of its scale. Boy, was I wrong! For a low-budget film, this one breaks the boundaries. It seems to start out like your typical coming-of-age story, but right when you think you have it pegged and are ready to fall into familiar boredom, it takes a completly different turn again and again. Full of steamy romance, comedy, thrills and more, ""Sideline Secrets"" has become a perfect movie for a night in with the boys. Sit back, relex, have a few drinks and be ready to have a lot of fun. Also-- be on the lookout for cameos by several adult-models such as the Fisher Twins of Miami studios, Brandon Paradine and more.

The review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it, evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs, instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it.Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music ... what else goes into a movie? Whatever it is, here it's as bad as it gets. If it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. I kept watching it thinking it must get better, because I hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable.It does not take a lot of money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant's amazingMala Noche, but there are many others.

I like finding new film makers, but this is the second or third in this genre that totally sucked. I can't figure out who the real target audience is for this film. The script itself is just bad. The scenes that take place in a supposed bar are so laughable and look like they were done in someone's living room. Some of the nudity seems to be just put in to make up for the lack of substance, because it doesn't need to be there for any other reason. Its not even good soft porn.

For low-budget indie films that's a tipoff that the filmmaker (and in this case 'filmmaker' is a very generous term) is going to try to substitute soft-core porn for any semblence of a real movie. Which is fine if that's what you want. I don't. Call me wacky but I expect more from my moviegoing experience; hmm...let's see...a plot would be nice, some continuity, some decent production values, and some acceptable acting.I've said it before: Just because a film is low-budget doesn't mean it has to look low-budget.

But they accomplished just that in this movie. And who else could have accomplished that other than the worst director in the history of directing? This movie is hilarious and for all the wrong reasons. The climax in particular is just hysterical. When the two bad guys shoot each other...omg. And when the mother busts in with the gun? I completely lost it. I highly recommend this as a rental.

Bad lighting, bad photography, bad sound.  The dialogue is terrible, the plot incomprehensible.  (It has something to do with missing boys, dysfunctional families, crooked cops, infidelity, alcoholism, coming out, and a bunch of other things.)  But the worst aspect of all is the acting.  This is one of those movies that is painful to watch.  It is embarrassing to see these amateurs attempting to act.  What were they thinking of?  What was the director thinking of?Apparently ""Sideline Secrets"" is so popular that there is a ""director's cut"" version of this thing.  I can't even begin to imagine what the deleted scenes were like.I won't say ""Sideline Secrets"" is the worst movie ever made.  I haven't seen them all.

Most of the acting was good. Some of the sets could have been a little better, but this was a film without a large budget. The nudity was a nice surprise and was included in all the appropriate places in the film. And the #1 reason I love the film is because it is a gay film with a positive ending. Everyone knows there is a shortage of those. Too many people don't want the glbt community to have happy endings, including bitter people within our own community.
