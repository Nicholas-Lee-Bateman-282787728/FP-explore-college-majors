1443694,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B0056031NW,FYI,"[83, 89]","The superb acting and character development of Kevin Whately as Detective Inspector Robert Lewis, and Laurence Fox as his partner, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, are a treat. Laurence Fox as Hathaway is a great surprise, playing a wryly humorous ex-seminarian with issues of his own. Kevin Whately as Lewis is perfect as a widowed survivor, in search of the perpetrator of the hit-and-run that left him bereft. Clare Holman as Dr. Laura Hobson adds another rich dimension to the narratives, as does Rebecca Front as the formidable ""Mum,"" Chief Superintendent Innocent. The wonderful Dr. Hobson first arrived in the previous series,Inspector Morse, Set Ten, Disk 2, ""The Way Through the Woods."" The introductions by Alan Cummings are informative and fun. For those of you going throughMidsomer Murders: The Early Cases CollectiontoMidsomer Murders: Set 18withdrawal, this will more than heal thy wounds. One can't always be a Badger of Badger's Drift, hoping for help from the wry team of Barnaby and Jones. Although Lewis and Hathaway are another duo altogether, and this series lacks the tongue-in-cheek self mocking of Midsomer, ""Lewis"" is well worth exploring. Of course, it's a treat to meander through Oxford's beautifully filmed spires, cobbled streets, and nearby countryside. The tensions between upper-class academics and regular citizens of Oxfordshire are explored. Lewis may start me on a long-term sandwich and ale streak, as the sustenance looks delicious and some viewers are highly suggestible in terms of gluttony, if not violence. I prefer food. Just wish Lewis could have kept the cat who devours fish & chips. The last excellent mystery, ""The Gift of Promise,"" features the deadpan, super-smart Hathaway advising a gifted child that growing up angry makes finding one's place in the world much more difficult. The whole series balances the relationship between Lewis and Hathaway marvelously, each with his own strengths, no egos running amuck. Enjoy!PS: After finishing this wonderful collection, there's a new prequel to Inspector Morse:Masterpiece Mystery: Endeavour. And if you're still hesitant to leave the U.K., you may want to sample a lesser-known series, based on Reginald Hill's Yorkshire mysteries (rough Chief Inspector Andy Dalziel & long-suffering Inspector Peter Pascoe):Dalziel and Pascoe: Season OnethroughDalziel & Pascoe: Season Five. Later seasons are available (see reviews for Season Five & Series 6 for How-To with Region 2 DVDs). WARNING: Only ""Dalziel & Pasco"" Series 6 & 7 are worth buying in Region 2, after that, the quality of the series declines drastically, also noted by reviewers in the U.K. Even in the U.K., subtitles require turning-off (easy, see reviews for info), as the Dutch are the prime market for the later Series.

Morse's former sergeant, the eponymous Lewis, is now promoted to inspector. Whereas before Lewis was the down-to-earth, sensible, working class figure balancing the sensitive, aesthetic, lonely, somewhat tortured Morse, he is now the down-to-earth, sensible, working-class figure balancing the sensitive, aesthetic, lonely, somewhat tortured Hathaway. The difference is that Lewis has become the boss and he must take responsibility for using Hathaway's talents effectively and for solving the crimes.At first, you may find (if you had previously watched 'Morse') it's a little difficult to think of Lewis as the man in charge, so completely was he the subordinate in his previous role. However, stick with it; soon you will find that your mind re-orients itself and accepts the notion that Lewis, obviously Hathaway's intellectual inferior, nevertheless brings sturdy common sense and reliability to the senior position and uses Hathaway's complementary qualities just as Morse used to use his. This requires considerable skill from the actors involved and Kevin Whately as Lewis and Laurence Fox as Hathaway play their parts very convincingly.Laura Hobson the pathologist (played by Clare Holman) first appeared in the later part of the 'Morse' series and here she has an expanded role. Lewis's wife has been killed (not a spoiler, it doesn't happen in the show) and Laura is a friend who just might become more than that. The writers cleverly allow the possibility to remain in the background while the mysteries play out, and the added depth the relationship brings to the characters adds to the empathy which we feel for them. The other principal supporting character is Lewis's boss, Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent (Rebecca Front), whose name belies her sharp and shrewd personality. There is, as usual in British mysteries, a splendid list of guest stars as murderers, victims and suspects.A very fine series and a worthy successor to Morse. The only slight quibble I have is that it's very difficult to work out which series is which, as for TV purposes they were divided differently in the US from the original UK order. This box set goes some way towards rectifying that, but you should note that this is NOT the complete Lewis collection. There is another series, series 5 in the UK, 6 in the US, which has just been released. The DVD releases are in the UK numbering system, so if you have this set plus the newly released season 5, you have all the 6 seasons released in the US.

But that's a good thing indeed.The show, based on characters created by Colin Dexter, is now itself a long-running spinoff of the longer-running mystery drama Inspector Morse, which featured John Thaw as the titular detective--wary of authority and enamored of opera, real English beer, and his Jaguar--who was ceremoniously killed off in 2000.Like its predecessor, Lewis revolves around police investigators attempting to solve murders in Oxford, where town and gown sit uncomfortably side by side. In Lewis, the gruff Robbie Lewis--widowed after a hit-and-run driver killed his wife--is joined by the reserved, erudite Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, a Cambridge-educated copper who dropped out of the seminary to pursue police work.Rather than follow the conventions of the run-off-the-mill pair of cops, Lewis and Hathaway have settled into a comfortable amiability. Lewis's existence--microwaved dinners eaten standing up, an ongoing simmering flirtation with forensic pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson-underscores a haunting loneliness, an unwilling return to bachelorhood in the face of loss.In many respects, Hathaway is like Morse: he's knowledgable about the finer things in life--poetry, philosophy, mythology--and the mysteries of religion. In Oxford, where the suspects are often university students or dons, it pays to have a partner who knows a thing or two about Nietzsche or Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark.Television needs more subtle and engaging shows like this one, which blends together intoxicating mysteries with a deep and abiding appreciation for literature, music, and art.

Morse (Robert Thaw) is so good and Lewis (Kevin Whately) his &#34;common man&#34; assistant in the most well written series I have ever seen.

With his background as a former theology student at Cambridge, it's Hathaway who is most likely to recall some obscure detail, of interest only to scholars, to help solve a case he and Lewis are investigating.If you enjoy Morse, Lewis, and Hathaway as I do, you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius, available at Amazon.

1443742,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0056031NW,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on Inspector Morse - Complete Collection stars as Detective Inspector Lewis in ""Inspector Lewis"", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).This boxed set contains the following episodes:Pilot EpisodeWhom the Gods Would Destroy - When an Oxford don's former classmate is found murdered, he comes under suspicion, but Lewis and Hathaway need to tread with care given the sensitive nature of the case.Old School Ties - Lewis is not happy when he is assigned ""babysitting"" duties with Hathaway. The celebrity in need of protecting is a reformed criminal turned celebrity author. When an attractive young student turns up dead, there are many suspects to choose from - her circle of college mates who all seem to be rather ambivalent in their feelings toward the girl, and also the celebrity himself. When the celebrity himself ends up murdered, Lewis' past comes back in the attractive form of his ex-schoolmate and ex-girlfriend, who turns out to be the widower/ agent of the dead man.Expiation - An apparent suicide of a North Oxford housewife perplexes Lewis. There was no suicide note, and the dead woman's life seemed too perfect to be true. Lewis and Hathaway dig deeper to get at the truth.And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garroted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.Counter Culture Blues - rock star Esme Ford returns to Oxford after thirty-five years to re-establish her band Midnight Addiction, though she was thought to have drowned decades earlier. Everything is veiled in secrecy, but not for long, as bodies begin to pile up.The Dead of Winter - DS Hathaway finds the past coming back to haunt him when he is assigned to work on a homicide linked to the Crevecouer Estate, where Hathaway's dad once worked as an estate manager. As he finds himself attracted to an old childhood acquaintance, he finds the family may be harboring some very dark secrets, enough to warrant murder.Dark Matter - A professor of astronomer is found dead in the university observatory soon after confession in church. His widow believes he was having an affair. When another victim is found, Lewis and Hathaway discover that someone has knowledge of the connections between the victims and what motivated the killings. Trouble is, the person who can help is a retired porter who is living in a home and senile.Your Sudden Death Question - It is a Bank Holiday weekend, and Lewis is making plans for a night at the opera with the coroner, Laura (Hathaway is off at a world music festival), but their plans are ruined by a murder at Oxford during a quiz weekend. One of the participants, Ethan Croft, a brilliant ex-student who left Oxford over sexual harassment allegations, is found murdered. Soon after, another participant, Eve, who had been seen with Croft earlier is also found dead. Lewis and Hathaway have to work out if this is merely a crime of passion or something more.Falling Darkness - One of my favorite episodes. Dr. Laura Hobson is planning a Halloween get-together with her two ex-college roommates, when one of them, Ligeia, is found murdered. Then, Ellen Jacoby, Laura's other friend, is attacked but survives. What is the killer's motivations and is Laura revealing all that she knows? This episode sees DI Lewis placed in a difficult position as he has to determine if Laura, whom he is extremely fond of, is actually being honest with him, and this places strain on the burgeoning relationship between the two.This boxed set also contains cast interviews and extras.I have become a fan of Inspector Lewis and his devoted sergeant Hathaway. Lewis may not be Morse, but this series is charming in its own right - there's a high sense of atmosphere, and the scenic Oxford setting makes it a series of high aesthetic value. The cinematography and score are beautifully done. The plots are not as intricate as those in the Morse series, but I love the wonderful chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway, not to mention the lovely pathologist Hobson.",5,Lewis and Hathaway make a
