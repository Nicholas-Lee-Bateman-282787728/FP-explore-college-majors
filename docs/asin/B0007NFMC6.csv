Cantthey get a better title?The doll was played by a very pretty model turned actress named remi koch, save for her annoying voice, she is very pretty andshe plays great as a doll (she doesnt move, just lies still)The movie allows viewers to see that some people have weird fetishes, and even the most successful couple can still have weirdproblems that not even medicine can cure.Overall I think this movie is great if you like a bit of dark comedy and some gore.",5,"Dont mind the critical critics.

883857,A2J57EQ9KPGXR9,B0007NFMC6,"H. A Huffman ""haumf""","[9, 10]","...then you have some serious problems. Dead Doll is a very disturbing film about an loopy artist who kills his wacky girlfriend then preserves her body with some chemicals so he can keep her around. Even more disturbing is that the cadaver gets stolen by one sicko then another, to be defiled again and again; ending in madness and murder.I guess the director/writer was trying to make a statement, in a very shocking and sometimes humourous way, about obsession and beauty and how some people get messed up by these concepts. The pacing of the film could be better along with its production values but it did not bore me.",3,Boring??

That distinction used to go to ""Dumb & Dumber"" but that finally got beat. (Granted, I saw that one when I was a teenager and never made it through the whole thing because I was so grossed out. Who knows if I would feel the same today, as movies have gotten grosser than ever, what with shock value and all.)So, as if sex scenes these days haven't gotten nasty enough... who wants to see horny men all over a doll? Yuck, yuck, yuck. But I must admit I did get a giggle out of the scene with the blade of glass. Too bad all rapes aren't as horrible for the man as well as the woman like that!!! Oh, and the scene where the guy's girlfriend was more turned on by the doll than him (because she ""had never been with a woman before and she was so pretty!"") was a little bit amusing. At least there was one guy who wanted to be with someone alive!Then there's the guy who flips out at the doll for leaving the apartment (she seems to come alive now and then). ""Where've you been?"" ""Shopping."" ""That's f***ing bulls***."" Repeat conversation four times. And they've been in a ""relationship"" like two days. The next time she leaves, the guy trashes the apartment.All I can figure is that the moral of the story is that men are pigs. Not that I always disagree, but it really seems like a dumb lesson to put in a movie... especially when the writer, producer, and director are all men.This movie isn't even getting donated to the library. It's going in the trash. I wouldn't want anyone to realize it came from me. (By the way, I didn't even purchase it in the first place. It belonged to a friend. I watched a few of her movies to see if any were worth keeping before giving them to the library. I am sure glad I did. Just a disclaimer there.)",1,Worst movie I've ever seen!,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1796,"['be', 'stupidest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'distinction', 'used', 'go', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'finally', 'got', 'beat', 'Granted', 'saw', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'never', 'made', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'grossed', 'out', 'Who', 'would', 'feel', 'same', 'today', 'movies', 'have', 'gotten', 'grosser', 'ever', 'what', 'shock', 'value', 'So', 'sex', 'scenes', 'days', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'nasty', 'enough', 'who', 'see', 'horny', 'men', 'doll', 'Yuck', 'yuck', 'yuck', 'must', 'admit', 'did', 'get', 'giggle', 'scene', 'blade', 'glass', 'Too', 'bad', 'rapes', 'are', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'woman', 'Oh', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'more', 'turned', 'doll', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'woman', 'was', 'so', 'pretty', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'amusing', 'least', 'was', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'someone', 'alive', 'Then', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'doll', 'leaving', 'apartment', 'come', 'alive', 'now', 'then', 'Where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Shopping', 'f***ing', 'bulls***', 'Repeat', 'conversation', 'four', 'times', ""'ve"", 'been', 'relationship', 'two', 'days', 'next', 'time', 'guy', 'apartment.All', 'can', 'figure', 'moral', 'story', 'men', 'are', 'pigs', 'Not', 'always', 'disagree', 'really', 'dumb', 'lesson', 'put', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'writer', 'producer', 'director', 'are', 'men.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'getting', 'donated', 'library', 'going', 'trash', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'realize', 'came', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'purchase', 'first', 'place', 'belonged', 'friend', 'watched', 'few', 'movies', 'see', 'were', 'worth', 'keeping', 'giving', 'library', 'am', 'sure', 'glad', 'did', 'Just', 'disclaimer', 'there']",Dead Doll
