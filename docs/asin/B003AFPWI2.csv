1334765,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B003AFPWI2,Amazon Customer,"[16, 16]",I work out 7 days a week and have used exercise DVDs for many years (I own about 250 or so - I'm an addict :| - and I always look for the advanced ones) and this workout is incredibly challenging. It is just amazing. It actually works more than what it says. You get some upper body and cardio in too plus there are also some kettlebell moves. A great variety but with lots of reps to really fatigue the muscles (and they will be toast!) and for reasons I can't explain it was fun at the same time. I did it in the morning and by afternoon my buns were screaming. If you're looking for a challenge this is the one to get.,5,No Mercy and worth every Penny,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,621,"['work', 'out', '7', 'days', 'week', 'have', 'used', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'many', 'years', 'own', 'about', '250', 'so', ""'m"", 'addict', '|', 'always', 'look', 'advanced', 'ones', 'workout', 'incredibly', 'challenging', 'just', 'amazing', 'actually', 'more', 'what', 'get', 'upper', 'body', 'cardio', 'too', 'are', 'also', 'kettlebell', 'moves', 'great', 'variety', 'lots', 'reps', 'really', 'fatigue', 'muscles', 'will', 'be', 'toast', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'was', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'did', 'morning', 'afternoon', 'buns', 'were', 'screaming', ""'re"", 'looking', 'challenge', 'one', 'get']","PERFECT LEGS, GLUTES & ABS: Michele Olson, PhD - NEW DVD"

I will do one leg segment and the following ab segment and feel it the next day. If you want real torture do the whole thing. Warning some parts of this dvd hurt!

1334768,A32CVWPHQI86QS,B003AFPWI2,"Nikisue ""Luvtoshop""","[14, 16]","I was surprised that someone said that these exercises don't hurt your knees because mine were hurting almost immediately after I completed the legs & glutes section. I do believe that these are good effective exercises for legs & glutes(haven't done the abs sections yet) and she does do a ton of reps to the point where you may be begging for mercy depending on your fitness level. But I find it interesting that in her intro, she didn't discuss any of the reasons why she chose specific exercises since she is an exercise physiologist. In Tamilee Webb'sThe Science of Fitness with Tamilee: I Want Those Buns! [VHS] Tamilee goes into detail about how the exercises in her DVD have been proven to be the best ones to tone up that area, and that's why she chose them. I expected to hear something like that in this one but she didn't spout any scientific basis. Surprising since she's a PhD. Also, she doesn't discuss proper form when doing the lunges and squats which is crucial for not hurting yourself. She just says things like ""Go down only as far as is comfortable for you"", which I don't find all that helpful. If you already know proper form, this will not be too much of an issue but I think reminders are always appropriate and helpful. If you have bad knees and don't know proper form, you could end up doing a ton of reps that can hurt you. Often, she takes a fast pace with the reps and it's easy to lose form which is what may have happened to me and why my knees were hurting, or it could just be that squats & lunges in general, are hard on the knees (especialy if you already have issues with them, which I do) even with good form. I'm not sure why people thought this workout was so ""fun"". I don't get that part unless those were people who know her, putting in good reviews. Fun? Ok well, she is not annoying like some fitness instructors, the set is fine, and the exercises, I believe, will be effective if I can find a way to do them without hurting myself but I would not call it fun. But it is a good DVD overall and I would recommend it. Just with reservations for those with knee issues. I would've liked to know all the things I mentioned before purchasing. Hope this helps you.",4,"If you have bad knees, read this",1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,2204,"['was', 'surprised', 'someone', 'said', 'exercises', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'knees', 'mine', 'were', 'hurting', 'almost', 'immediately', 'completed', 'legs', 'glutes', 'section', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'good', 'effective', 'exercises', 'legs', 'glutes', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'abs', 'sections', 'yet', 'do', 'ton', 'reps', 'point', 'where', 'may', 'be', 'begging', 'mercy', 'depending', 'fitness', 'level', 'find', 'interesting', 'intro', 'did', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'reasons', 'why', 'chose', 'specific', 'exercises', 'exercise', 'physiologist', 'Tamilee', ""Webb'sThe"", 'Science', 'Fitness', 'Tamilee', 'Want', 'Buns', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'Tamilee', 'detail', 'how', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'proven', 'be', 'best', 'ones', 'tone', 'up', 'area', 'why', 'chose', 'expected', 'hear', 'something', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'spout', 'scientific', 'basis', 'Surprising', 'PhD', 'Also', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'proper', 'form', 'when', 'doing', 'lunges', 'squats', 'crucial', 'not', 'hurting', 'just', 'things', 'Go', 'down', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'comfortable', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'helpful', 'already', 'know', 'proper', 'form', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'issue', 'think', 'reminders', 'are', 'always', 'appropriate', 'helpful', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'proper', 'form', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'ton', 'reps', 'can', 'hurt', 'Often', 'fast', 'pace', 'reps', 'easy', 'lose', 'form', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'why', 'knees', 'were', 'hurting', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'squats', 'lunges', 'general', 'are', 'hard', 'knees', 'especialy', 'already', 'have', 'issues', 'do', 'even', 'good', 'form', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'thought', 'workout', 'was', 'so', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'part', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'putting', 'good', 'reviews', 'Fun', 'Ok', 'well', 'not', 'annoying', 'fitness', 'instructors', 'set', 'fine', 'exercises', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'effective', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'do', 'hurting', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'fun', 'good', 'DVD', 'overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'Just', 'reservations', 'knee', 'issues', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'know', 'things', 'mentioned', 'purchasing', 'Hope', 'helps']","PERFECT LEGS, GLUTES & ABS: Michele Olson, PhD - NEW DVD"

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE this DVD! It works muscles in your legs & butt you never knew you had. The Mega series works on the larger leg muscles. I was surprised at how much cardio it provided with the Mega series. The Master Leg segment is great as well and really works deep leg, calf & thigh muscles. I was really looking for a quality DVD that would provide better definition for my legs & this is it! Dr. Olson helps to push you though it and works all the moves right along with you - with a smile on her face! I have not found any pain in my knees like some other workout DVDs. I am VERY pleased and am continuing to use this DVD in my weekly routine.CONS: (but by no means deal breakers - buy the DVD!)The cool up & warm down are a bit short in my opinion, the AB segments are tough, and a bit short too. I do wish you could play each 25 minute Mega & Master series separately, instead of choosing each piece on the main menu. You can 'play all' & work both sets - which will provide about a 1 hour workout - but I am not ready for both yet!",5,OMG!
