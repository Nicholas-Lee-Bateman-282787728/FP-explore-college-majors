1695179,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00J0BTESO,,"[3, 5]","This is based on Operation Icarus that took place in dusty Helmand province in 2006. A squad of British soldiers led by a Captain are sent out on a patrol to be seen by the locals and deter Al Qaeda and co from getting up to bad shenanigans. They have two Land Rovers that have 50 calibre machine guns mounted on them and an array of other equipment.The story seems to be being told through the Captain being interviewed but then we go to what seems to be real time and the story becomes linear in context. The squad are not exactly one big happy family and the Territorial Army member is called STAB which stands for `stupid TA barstewrad' or some such stuff.Anyway things happen and the patrol gets lengthened and they all start to show the stress which manifests itself in complaining about rubbish equipment like the SA80 rifle; `The Guardian' wrote an article about the SA80 in 2002 called `ready, aim, jam!' Then the fall outs begin.Now I had recently seen `Lone Survivor' about a US Navy Seal operation in 2004 and I though we might have a British answer to Mr Wahlberg's efforts - sadly not. There is a little bit of action but it is basically firing a big gun at something in the distance and then shouting a lot. This is about the stress and interplay of the men and the efforts of the Captain to try to maintain order. When it finished I thought I must have missed something - like the point. Then having thought on it for a few days it never said it was going to be an action fest, it was that my expectations were not met. So not brilliant but also not as bad as I thought it was - hence my 3 star rating.",3,Brit Afghan Soldiers Story,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,1618,"['based', 'Operation', 'Icarus', 'took', 'place', 'dusty', 'Helmand', 'province', '2006', 'squad', 'British', 'soldiers', 'led', 'Captain', 'are', 'sent', 'out', 'patrol', 'be', 'seen', 'locals', 'deter', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'co', 'getting', 'up', 'bad', 'shenanigans', 'have', 'two', 'Land', 'Rovers', 'have', '50', 'calibre', 'machine', 'guns', 'mounted', 'array', 'other', 'equipment.The', 'story', 'be', 'being', 'told', 'Captain', 'being', 'interviewed', 'then', 'go', 'what', 'be', 'real', 'time', 'story', 'linear', 'context', 'squad', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'one', 'big', 'happy', 'family', 'Territorial', 'Army', 'member', 'called', 'STAB', 'stupid', 'TA', 'barstewrad', 'such', 'stuff.Anyway', 'things', 'happen', 'patrol', 'lengthened', 'start', 'show', 'stress', 'complaining', 'rubbish', 'equipment', 'SA80', 'rifle', 'Guardian', 'wrote', 'article', 'SA80', '2002', 'called', 'ready', 'aim', 'jam', 'Then', 'fall', 'begin.Now', 'had', 'recently', 'seen', 'Lone', 'Survivor', 'US', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'operation', '2004', 'might', 'have', 'British', 'answer', 'Mr', 'Wahlberg', 'efforts', 'sadly', 'not', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'basically', 'firing', 'big', 'gun', 'something', 'distance', 'then', 'shouting', 'lot', 'stress', 'interplay', 'men', 'efforts', 'Captain', 'try', 'maintain', 'order', 'When', 'finished', 'thought', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'point', 'Then', 'having', 'thought', 'few', 'days', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'action', 'fest', 'was', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'not', 'brilliant', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'was', 'hence', '3', 'star', 'rating']",The Patrol

There are many more war films much better than this slow moving and unbelievable times the enemy was there but immune to the British team.

There is some shooting at unseen assailants & one of the Brits is shot but mostly it's about patrolling in a desolate landscape against an unseen enemy among people you don't understand nor understand you.

This story is loosely linked to operation Achilles and might be more accurately stated ""inspired"" by true events rather than based upon. We get to know the characters by their nicknames, Smudge, Stab, Ginge (ginger) and Welch. The banter between them is not the healthy kind as they concentrate on their differences. Once one in the group dies, the troops begin to question the war and their mission while their commanding officer who has the same thoughts is forced to toe the company line.The film is about the relationships of a diverse unit who question their leadership. The war acts as a background to escalate tension. This is not your classic war film about combat and killing the enemy. It is a war drama, one where young men are placed in combat roles and don't believe the cause is worth their life.In anything, this is more of an anti-war film, showing how someone like Bowe Bergdahl could do and say the things of which he has been accused, although the message is not heavy.Parental Guide: F-bomb.",4,OURS IS NOT TO REASON WHY,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,1104,"['group', 'soldiers', 'are', 'patrol', 'Afghanistan', 'fiction', 'operation', 'known', 'Icarus', 'story', 'loosely', 'linked', 'operation', 'Achilles', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'accurately', 'stated', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'rather', 'based', 'upon', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'nicknames', 'Smudge', 'Stab', 'Ginge', 'ginger', 'Welch', 'banter', 'not', 'healthy', 'kind', 'concentrate', 'differences', 'Once', 'one', 'group', 'troops', 'begin', 'question', 'war', 'mission', 'commanding', 'officer', 'who', 'same', 'thoughts', 'forced', 'toe', 'company', 'line.The', 'film', 'relationships', 'diverse', 'unit', 'who', 'question', 'leadership', 'war', 'background', 'escalate', 'tension', 'not', 'classic', 'war', 'film', 'combat', 'killing', 'enemy', 'war', 'drama', 'one', 'where', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'placed', 'combat', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'cause', 'life.In', 'anything', 'more', 'anti-war', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'someone', 'Bowe', 'Bergdahl', 'could', 'do', 'say', 'things', 'been', 'accused', 'message', 'not', 'heavy.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb']",The Patrol
