I'm streaming via Amazon and the video quality is quite good (obviously the audio suffers compared to a blu ray).  Excellent humor and interesting side plots.  The weakness is that the main plot is too simple and undeveloped compared to later seasons but it's a nice start to a really captivating series.,4,Building momentum,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,491,"['Tons', 'personality', 'character', 'interaction', 'unique', 'most', 'characters', 'start', 'not', 'liking', 'one', 'process', 'building', 'friendships', 'quite', 'slowly', ""'m"", 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'video', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'obviously', 'audio', 'suffers', 'compared', 'blu', 'ray', 'Excellent', 'humor', 'interesting', 'side', 'plots', 'weakness', 'main', 'plot', 'too', 'simple', 'undeveloped', 'compared', 'later', 'seasons', 'nice', 'start', 'really', 'captivating', 'series']",Farscape - The Best of Season One
702470,A3TMC106MIY8S5,B000067IVT,A. Edward Azad,"[2, 2]","Farscape is a weird beast. Rarely have I felt such a sense of culture shock watching something. The first couple of episodes are like Trek meets Mad Max, with the added novelty of naked nymphomaniac aliens. These things don't inspire confidence, especially to the uninitiated.But Farscape is sneaky. It slams you with plot turns that you don't see coming, and suddenly becomes one of the most emotional, artfully-crafted series ever produced. You need to ease into the waters slowly, though.One example is John Crichton: on the surface, he's a snarky Peter Parker-wannabe, insulting all the aliens around him with 90s pop culture references. Ben Browder's style of acting can easily be mistaken for wooden, especially in the first couple of episodes when all he does is crack wise. However, as the plot wears on, you learn to keep on your toes with Crichton, because he's a multifaceted hero. He doesn't react to things the way ""TV"" characters normally do, especially for this genre; this unpredictability makes him seem more human to a general viewer. Crichton is also effortlessly cool. He grows on you quick.Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun is the glue which holds the story together. This chick can seriously emote. It's a basic Sci-Fi action girl role, but Black invests it with an untold amount of depth. One senses this transition early on; in the first few episodes, there's not much clockwork inside Aeryn and you can predict her story arc pretty handedly. Judging from the commentaries, I suspect the show producers didn't realize what kind of supernova actress had fallen into their hands. They expected to cast a token bombshell and ended up with a seasoned genre actor who's ""been around the block"", in a good way. I can't gush about Claudia enough, so I won't try.So, in short: This quickly went from being one of my least-favorite sci-fi shows ever to one of my Top 3.",5,So frelling cool.,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,1877,"['Farscape', 'weird', 'beast', 'Rarely', 'have', 'felt', 'sense', 'culture', 'shock', 'watching', 'something', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'Trek', 'meets', 'Mad', 'Max', 'added', 'novelty', 'naked', 'nymphomaniac', 'aliens', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'confidence', 'especially', 'uninitiated.But', 'Farscape', 'sneaky', 'plot', 'turns', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'suddenly', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'artfully-crafted', 'series', 'ever', 'produced', 'need', 'ease', 'waters', 'slowly', 'though.One', 'example', 'John', 'Crichton', 'surface', 'snarky', 'Peter', 'Parker-wannabe', 'insulting', 'aliens', '90s', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'style', 'acting', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'mistaken', 'wooden', 'especially', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'when', 'crack', 'wise', 'However', 'plot', 'wears', 'learn', 'keep', 'toes', 'Crichton', 'multifaceted', 'hero', ""n't"", 'react', 'things', 'way', 'TV', 'characters', 'normally', 'do', 'especially', 'genre', 'unpredictability', 'seem', 'more', 'human', 'general', 'viewer', 'Crichton', 'also', 'effortlessly', 'cool', 'quick.Claudia', 'Black', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'glue', 'story', 'together', 'chick', 'can', 'seriously', 'emote', 'basic', 'Sci-Fi', 'action', 'girl', 'role', 'Black', 'untold', 'amount', 'depth', 'One', 'transition', 'early', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'not', 'much', 'clockwork', 'Aeryn', 'can', 'predict', 'story', 'arc', 'pretty', 'handedly', 'Judging', 'commentaries', 'suspect', 'show', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'kind', 'supernova', 'actress', 'had', 'fallen', 'hands', 'expected', 'cast', 'token', 'bombshell', 'ended', 'up', 'seasoned', 'genre', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'block', 'good', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'gush', 'Claudia', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try.So', 'short', 'quickly', 'went', 'being', 'one', 'least-favorite', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'ever', 'one', 'Top', '3']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

I actually liked the main characters in this series better when they became part of the Stargate SG1 family, although at that juncture, Stargate had most likely reached its saturation point and the producers needed fresh blood in an attempt to rejuvenate and re-inspire its fanbase.Perhaps I would need to watch more than the first few minutes in the initial episode of Farscape, but I tired quickly of outlandish characters reminiscent of the bar scene in Star Wars: Episode IV, A New Hope. (Incidentally, as everyone knows, that particular movie was re-subtitled only to legitimize the prequels. I enjoyed it only as a farcical, juvenile romp that Harrison Ford - and only he, Ford - used as an audition for later, more satisfying roles. I even think the Star Trek prequel, with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, was a better prequel to a better series.)I get more enjoyment from such offbeat series in this genre as Firefly, which didn't attempt to outdo its competition with the most outlandish alien beings.

M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[9, 10]","Though I can't say much about Stargate, nothing bad or good haven't seen it, I can say that this is by far the best sci fi series I have seen since Deep Space Nine.In terms of quality it far surpasses most other shows right from the getgo.  Most shows will have a shaky first season, then pick up once they are allowed a bigger budget.  This one hit you with its high quality costumes and surreal imagery from the first episode.The charaters are well balanced and interesting.  They are all former prisoners, and not all good people, but they all have a certain depth to them.  The noble but violent D'argo, the peaceful and sexual Zhan, the selfless Pilot, the arrogant and devious Rygel(my favorite), the emotionally challeged but fierce and competent Aeryn Sunn, the sometimes thick headed but innovative Crichton, and Chiana the classic preachers daughter(wild and willing to do anything).The storylines were interesting and had an energy to them.  Aliens being some of the best in years, all had a surreal and organic quality to them.  Not like the sterile and too human Star Trek NG types.The bad guys were threatening and had depth.  The Peacekeepers being a totalitarian millitary regime, remenicent of the Federation from Starship Troopers.  Supposedly supporting peace and order, but brutalizing and killing to achieve that and enforcing their ways on others.  The character Crais was excellent as the crazed general hunting down Crichton for allegedly killing his brother.  Scorpius in the later part of the series creates a classic villian, well spoken, cold, calculating, intelligent, mysterious, and ruthless when getting what he wants.  He isn't some screaming psychopath that rants and rages, he is a cool and collected baddie, which I find much more menacing.  His interrogation of Crichton was one of the creepier parts of the series.This series has appealed to many types of people, including those who normally don't like sci fi.

702484,A47OISX4AV8I,B000067IVT,AngelosOne,"[3, 3]","Too much to say, and sadly, not matter how flowery or refined my words will try to be, they will never do justice to the greatness of this show.I'm a recent addition to the 'Scapers' movement, meaning that unfortunately, while the series was on Sci-fi, I was unable to watch it. Mostly because I was away in College, and their cable package did not include the Sci-fi channel.  I always did hear good things about it, but I never got to see this beautifully done series.I'm a lover of Sci-fi in general, and after having purchased the Babylon 5 series, I started looking around for other great Sci-fi series to buy.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw that Farscape was now available as box sets- I was jumping up and down in glee, when I realized I could watch the entire run of the series-another reason to love DVDS.Needless to say, I bought the entire Farscape run in one swoop (It was probably the best half grand that I've ever spent). I also got the Peacekeeper wars.The moment the first episode began to play, I was sucked immediately into the world of Farscape, I knew then, that I would never regret buying this series.  The quality of it was just so amazing, considering that it was a TV show. The characters were interesting and fluid, Rygel was just so freaking funny, I always forgot he was a puppet- the Henson company did a tremendous job on animating him and giving him a personality and character of his own.And then, there was Claudia Black.  She captivates me like no other female character in Sci-fi has ever done.  Her eyes, her mannerisms, and the way she acts, Aeryn Sun is the archetype of the sci-fi female heroine.I'm also, for the most part, a hopeless romantic, so the instant chemistry you see between Aeryn and John told me that this was going to be a Sci-fi romance for the ages.  They way the two actors play off each other makes you get involved in their struggle to understand each other, and their own initial denial to what they are both feeling is just so enticing.  The fact that Aeryn is a Sebacean, an alien who looks a lot like a human, makes their interaction all the more interesting.  She's a genetically bred warrior, a PeaceKeeper, who has been raised in a society where she only knows how to fight but not feel.  It must have been exasperating to John, trying to figure her out- no more so, when in one episode he asks her, ""what about compassion?""  It's not a surprise that there is no Sebacean word for compassion, as Aeryn tells him, and that she's never felt the feeling he's trying to describe.So far, I've only completed season 1, but already I'm seeing how John's humanity is starting to affect Aeryn, and how maybe, they'll find that they aren't so different after all, and that love can cross all boundaries....I'm sad that this show only had 4 seasons, and while I'm glad it got closure with the follow-up mini series, The Peacekeeper Wars, I do hope that they will make either a feature film, or somehow, someway, get funding for season 5.  It's been almost 2 years since it went off air, I think, but you never know, sometimes miracles do happen.

So let me assure you that the quality of the video in this streaming version, while not HD, was absolutely acceptable. We watched it on a 55"" screen with the 4:3 aspect ratio maintained. The picture looked crisp and we didn't notice any oddness in movements on the screen, which happens fairly often with streaming video.As to the show itself, we'd never seen it and were pleasantly surprised. I particularly liked an exchange early on between the star, Ben Browder and Kent McCord, who played his father in this episode. It was touching, honest, and satisfying ... a very well crafted piece of dialogue.Special effects were quite acceptable looking, certainly seeming to match the standards of Star Trek shows and Stargate. The characters introduced were an interesting mix, and were convincingly acted. As a big sci-fi fan, I'm not sure quite how I missed this for so long.

702496,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000067IVT,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[2, 2]",1998 ushered in a new type of sci-fi television show. This was a show that dared to explore character development and story arcs that would last for more than a few shows. It was also a time when the Jim Hensen Creature Shop came into its own on television instead of just in feature films. However for all of its innovation the series had some hit and miss episodes and several bumps in the road on the way to what it would become in future seasons.Farscape is the story of John Crichton (Ben Browder) who has been sucked through a wormhole and into a different part of the galaxy where a war is raging between a group of fugitives who have stolen a living spaceship and the galactic Peacekeepers who are supposed to represent order. Through 22 episodes Crichton and his fellow travelers encounter new problems and races of aliens that must be dealt with.If you are a fan you are familiar with the premise of the show so this review will focus on the box set released by ADV Films. The set released in a number of editions has been long out of print. This has created a seller's market that is finally stabilizing. I bought my set for over 300 dollars but now the price is around 150.00. The episodes are presented two per disc with both Dolby 2.0 and Dolby 5.1 sound. While the surrounds are impressive sometimes the soundfield overwhelms the dialogue making individual episodes hard to understand. The picture quality is superb and makeup and black levels come across almost perfectly.The extras are a series of video profiles of individual characters and crew and are well worth watching. The commentaries on eight individual episodes are also well worth a listen. Because of its cost this is a box set designed more for fans than for casual watchers of the series but it is well worth seeking out.,4,Farscape's First Season,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,1802,"['1998', 'ushered', 'new', 'type', 'sci-fi', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'show', 'dared', 'explore', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'arcs', 'would', 'last', 'more', 'few', 'shows', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'when', 'Jim', 'Hensen', 'Creature', 'Shop', 'came', 'own', 'television', 'instead', 'just', 'feature', 'films', 'However', 'innovation', 'series', 'had', 'hit', 'miss', 'episodes', 'several', 'bumps', 'road', 'way', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'future', 'seasons.Farscape', 'story', 'John', 'Crichton', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'who', 'been', 'sucked', 'wormhole', 'different', 'part', 'galaxy', 'where', 'war', 'raging', 'group', 'fugitives', 'who', 'have', 'stolen', 'living', 'spaceship', 'galactic', 'Peacekeepers', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'represent', 'order', '22', 'episodes', 'Crichton', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'encounter', 'new', 'problems', 'races', 'aliens', 'must', 'be', 'dealt', 'are', 'fan', 'are', 'familiar', 'premise', 'show', 'so', 'review', 'will', 'focus', 'box', 'set', 'released', 'ADV', 'Films', 'set', 'released', 'number', 'editions', 'been', 'long', 'print', 'created', 'seller', 'market', 'finally', 'stabilizing', 'bought', 'set', '300', 'dollars', 'now', 'price', '150.00', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'two', 'disc', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'surrounds', 'are', 'impressive', 'sometimes', 'soundfield', 'overwhelms', 'dialogue', 'making', 'individual', 'episodes', 'hard', 'understand', 'picture', 'quality', 'superb', 'makeup', 'black', 'levels', 'come', 'almost', 'perfectly.The', 'extras', 'are', 'series', 'video', 'profiles', 'individual', 'characters', 'crew', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'commentaries', 'eight', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'listen', 'cost', 'box', 'set', 'designed', 'more', 'fans', 'casual', 'watchers', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

When in reality, ""Farscape"" is far from any type of Sci-Fi show you may have seen before. The critically acclaimed series that ran for four years on the Sci-Fi channel destroys all of the conventions of is predecessors, by driving the series through the characters instead of techno-babble. The grand irony of it all is that this approach ultimately doomed the series to cancellation for being too serialized. But through it's four season run, ""Farscape"" created a fiercely loyal following of fans. So much so, that when the announcement of it's cancellation by the Sci-Fi channel was made, fans banded together to purchase a full page add in ""Variety"" magazine ($$) to try and save the show. And it worked, at least to a certain extent.""Farscape"" returns in October for a limited time with an eight-hour mini-series that will tie up most of the loose ends created by the abrupt end of the show.If you are curious and wish to get familiar with the series before it airs, then this is a great place to start.Ben Browder (Party Of Five) stars as protagonist John Crichton, an astronaut shot through a wormhole while testing his experimental spacecraft. He ends up in a far quadrant of the galaxy in league with a group of escaped prisoners. The subsequent relationships he forms, and they way these diverse characters interact are the heartbeat of the show. Browder is perfect as the flawed hero doing his best to cope as the fish out of water, and the range of emotion and humor he brings to the role creates an innovative approach to the genre. The chemistry between he and leading lady Claudia Black, as Officer Aren Sun, is unmistakable. The underlying love story between the two of them is the lifeblood of the series. The cast is rounded out by a wonderful group of Australian and British born actors (and even a few puppets) that are forced to fulfill their roles through layers of heavy make up and prosthetics, and each one does so flawlessly.But don't be fooled by the special effects and the elaborate sets, this series boils down to simple character development.

A year ago I went over to her house; she was sitting on her couch watching a show. ""Hey Dee, whatcha watching?"" I asked. No answer. ""Dee?"" ""Ssshh!!"", she said irritably, ""Farscape. Go away."" I thought anything  that got Dee that excited was worth checking out, and that is how I fell madly, hopelessly, totally in love with ""Farscape"", the most incredibly creative, heartfelt, inspired television show I have ever seen.Ben Browder stars as Commander John Crichton, a peaceful, laid-back astronaut who is accidentally flung through a wormhole and straight into some forsaken part of the universe. Over the course of the first few episodes, John teams up with an assortment of bizarre alien life-forms, including a race that look very similar to humans (but are considerably, uh, tougher). The first season chronicles John's wild adventures with his new crew on the starship Moya, as through many intense trials they first fuse into a team, and then gradually become a family.The cast is uniformly excellent, with standouts being Gigi Edgley as the mischievous Chiana and Claudia Black as the fearsome ex-mercenary Aeryn Sun. Black is especially good in her scenes with Ben Browder, they have spectacular chemistry and watching their evolving relationship is a absolute joy. Browder, in fact, manages to create the most interesting male character to appear on TV in many a moon; his Crichton is innately honorable and decent, and despite being completely clueless in his new surroundings time and again demonstrates an amazing talent for thinking outside of the box.Great dialogue, cool sets, bright costumes and moving character development round out the first chapter in the Crichton saga. If you have never seen ""Farscape"", go ahead and buy the Box Set and watch the first season unfold like a rich, satisfying novel. Commander Crichton's tale is a thrilling ride, and you won't be sorry.GRADE: A+",5,"A Better Leader,  A Better Man",1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,2105,"['have', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'kind', 'sci-fi', 'guru', 'thousands', 'literally', 'sci-fi', 'novels', 'movies', 'time', 'something', 'read', 'watch', 'can', 'bet', 'going', 'blow', 'mind', 'year', 'ago', 'went', 'house', 'was', 'sitting', 'couch', 'watching', 'show', 'Hey', 'Dee', 'whatcha', 'watching', 'asked', 'answer', 'Dee', 'Ssshh', 'said', 'irritably', 'Farscape', 'Go', 'away', 'thought', 'anything', 'got', 'Dee', 'excited', 'was', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'how', 'fell', 'madly', 'hopelessly', 'totally', 'love', 'Farscape', 'most', 'incredibly', 'creative', 'heartfelt', 'inspired', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Ben', 'Browder', 'stars', 'Commander', 'John', 'Crichton', 'peaceful', 'laid-back', 'astronaut', 'who', 'accidentally', 'flung', 'wormhole', 'straight', 'forsaken', 'part', 'universe', 'course', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'John', 'up', 'assortment', 'bizarre', 'alien', 'life-forms', 'including', 'race', 'look', 'very', 'similar', 'humans', 'are', 'considerably', 'uh', 'tougher', 'first', 'season', 'John', 'wild', 'adventures', 'new', 'crew', 'starship', 'Moya', 'many', 'intense', 'trials', 'first', 'fuse', 'team', 'then', 'gradually', 'become', 'family.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'standouts', 'being', 'Gigi', 'Edgley', 'mischievous', 'Chiana', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'fearsome', 'ex-mercenary', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'Black', 'especially', 'good', 'scenes', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'have', 'spectacular', 'chemistry', 'watching', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'absolute', 'joy', 'Browder', 'fact', 'create', 'most', 'interesting', 'male', 'character', 'appear', 'TV', 'many', 'moon', 'Crichton', 'innately', 'honorable', 'decent', 'being', 'completely', 'clueless', 'new', 'surroundings', 'time', 'again', 'amazing', 'talent', 'thinking', 'outside', 'box.Great', 'dialogue', 'cool', 'sets', 'bright', 'costumes', 'moving', 'character', 'development', 'round', 'first', 'chapter', 'Crichton', 'saga', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Farscape', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'Box', 'Set', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'unfold', 'rich', 'satisfying', 'novel', 'Commander', 'Crichton', 'tale', 'thrilling', 'ride', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry.GRADE', 'A+']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

Fresh, original, funny, innovative . . . in short - Exceptional!  For fans of later Star Trek series such as The Next Generation, this show may be a little too chaotic.  This is not a nice, ordered universe but one in which anything might and probably will happen.  The show also achieves something rarely accomplished in the Science Fiction TV arena - being sexy without coming across as completely contrived (the new Battlestar Galactica reeks of this poison).  An exceptional cast of mostly Australians give performances that are unforgetable.  Anthony Simcoe's character (Kar'Dargo) takes risks that most actors would flee screaming from.  Gigi Edgley gives an amazing performance as Chianna (comes in later in season one) which is unlike anything I have ever seen!  Virginia Hey as Zhan portrays a character which is probably one of the most unique spiritual characters ever put to film.  And of course the chemistry between exceptional actors Claudia Black and Ben Browder lights up the set!  This is a show that will move you on many levels.  Good on ya mate!  Too bad it was cancelled after only four seasons and one miniseries!  Its one flaw is probably that jumping into the middle of a season or missing a show will leave you lost.

702531,A1KXG4PK3416JJ,B000067IVT,dijon99,"[0, 0]","John CrichtonJohn Robert Crichton, Jr. /&#712;kra&#618;t&#601;n/, played by Ben Browder, is an International Aeronautics and Space Administration (most commonly referred to on the show as IASA) astronaut who, in the opening few minutes of the pilot episode, is accidentally catapulted through a wormhole across the universe, thus setting the scene for the show as a whole. As the only regularly appearing human on the show, he is the main focus and is the main character as he narrates the weekly credits and is the only character to appear in every episode. Along with Michael Shanks' character of Daniel Jackson in Stargate SG-1, Browder's Crichton has been called one of the sexiest male characters in science fiction.[1]Although Crichton is a heroic and unwaveringly loyal character, he is also a mischievously comical one, so much so that he is the primary source of humor for the series. The show derives much of its humor from Crichton's habitual (and extensive) use of Earth-related pop culture references, often used as witty mockery in the face of danger or opponents who, being unfamiliar with the references, are unaware that they are being insulted. Although an occasional reference will provoke curiosity or confusion to his friends, Crichton's fellow shipmates are largely unaffected by these comments because they simply assume them to be native Earth terms that cannot be interpreted by translator microbes and merely extrapolate the meaning from its context.Information about John Crichton's life before the first episode is only revealed slowly over the course of the series. He was the middle child born to Jack (an astronaut) and Leslie Crichton. He has two sisters, Olivia (his younger sister) and an older sister, Susan. He has a childhood friend named Douglas &#34;D.K.&#34; Knox. John's mother died of cancer four years before his Farscape One accident. John Crichton followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an astronaut, flew on two missions prior to the Farscape incident and was Mission Commander on one of those missions.In the first episode of season one, during a test flight designed to prove a scientific theory concerning the use of planetary gravity as a means for spaceship acceleration, a wormhole appears, and John and his 'Farscape One' module are pulled into and through it. On his exit from the wormhole, he finds himself in the middle of a spaceship dogfight, during which he accidentally causes the death of Tauvo Crais, the brother of Peacekeeper Captain Bialar Crais. Crichton's craft is pulled aboard a large spaceship named Moya, a Leviathan (a biomechanoid, i.e., a 'living ship'), where John meets his first aliens (Zhaan, D'Argo, Aeryn Sun and Rygel). Shortly after, John meets Bialar Crais, who wants revenge for his brother's death. John has to adapt rather quickly to a life with aliens, guns, and space travel, without the comfort of Earth culture. Toward the end of season one, Crichton encounters a mysterious alien race known only as The Ancients, who hide a repository of wormhole knowledge into his brain to guide him home, beginning a series-long chase by a Sebacean-Scarran hybrid Peacekeeper called Scorpius who hunts John and the rest of the Farscape crew to obtain that information.Early in season two, Crichton learns that Scorpius has implanted a neural chip into his head, which causes hallucinations of a 'neural clone' of Scorpius, whom he dubs &#34;Harvey&#34;. These hallucinations influence Crichton in an effort to get at the hidden wormhole knowledge. As a result, Crichton's behavior grows more erratic and unpredictable, even as he continues to have romantic feelings for Aeryn Sun. In the end of Season 2, the neural chip takes complete control over Crichton (resulting in a Scorpius/Crichton mixed personality with extremely dark humor) and transmits a message to Scorpius. Shortly after that Harvey defeats Aeryn in an aerial dogfight and kills her. After Aeryn's death, Crichton regains control. The chip is removed, but stolen by Scorpius. With the beginning of Season three, Harvey still remains in Crichton's head. A few episodes later, Crichton is &#34;twinned&#34; by another alien. Neither of the Crichtons can be called a copy, but are &#34;equal and original.&#34; After the duplication it was soon discovered that Harvey was twinned as well. Eventually, the crew of Moya is split across the two Leviathans, Moya and Talyn, and they are subsequently separated from each other. Each ship has one Crichton. The Crichton aboard Talyn begins a romantic relationship with Aeryn while the Crichton on Moya continues studying wormholes, helped by the repository in his brain. Jack the Ancient finds the Talyn Crichton, forcibly extracts Harvey and unlocks the wormhole knowledge. Crichton later dies of radiation poisoning from a wormhole weapon. When the survivors of the two crews are reunited, Aeryn (in her grief) is very cold to the remaining Crichton(due to him having different memories about the last few months). The crew members of Moya start going their separate ways at the end of season three. Just after Aeryn Sun leaves Crichton, seemingly for good, he learns that she is pregnant with his child(whether the child belongs to the original Crichton or the Talyn Crichton is left unknown).Early season four leaves Crichton with nothing but time to work on his wormhole theories. He eventually reunites with the crew members of Moya and Aeryn and Scorpius, who has fallen out of favor with Peacekeeper high command. Shortly, after arrival, Scorpius offers to remove Harvey. Due to the neural clone's longer presence within and increased familiarity with Crichton, Harvey's reaction includes persuasion and appeal to sympathy rather than threats. Crichton still agrees to allow Scorpius to remove the lingering neural spillover. Halfway through the season, Crichton finds his way back to Earth, but he voluntarily gives up the dream of Earth and returns to Moya. After a series of dangerous events (including Harvey's resurrection), Crichton and Aeryn find time alone together. Aeryn tells him he is the father of her child, and Crichton proposes to her. The moment she accepts, an alien craft melts the two and ends the season.Crichton and Aeryn are revived at the beginning of The Peacekeeper Wars mini-series, and Crichton uses his wormhole knowledge to successfully force a peace treaty between the warring Peacekeepers and Scarrans. The wormhole knowledge in his brain is finally removed by Einstein the Ancient. During the mini-series, Aeryn gives birth to their son named D'Argo Sun-Crichton in honor of their late comrade.",5,Fascinating,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,6628,"['John', 'CrichtonJohn', 'Robert',

Other than that, I thought that the character interplay was unique so I believe I watched the last episode/mini-movie about 10-times and decided I would find out more about this show that was made by son of a legend Jim Henson.  Brian Henson and his pals got together and allowed the actors to explore the characters and this is what resulted.The bad guys and girls are totally vicious and malevolent.  The good guys pull out of the fire at the very last moments always and the show always has time to be sexy.  There are more push-up bras than at JC Penney's.  Aside from the obvious unlike Star Trek; you have a bunch of thieves, killers, ex-prisoners and maniacs on a living ship with a symbiotic pilot that becomes a target for every criminal in the galaxy.  Like I say a good mix of action, violence, good guy to the rescue with consequences and throw in a liberal amount of sexy and you have ""Not Your Mother's Star Trek!  Good stuff.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","From the very first episode onward, it's pretty obvious that ""Farscape: The Complete Season 1"" is no ordinary sci-fi story -- the characters are outlaws, the ship is alive, and distant galaxies are full of gloriously weird and grotesque Muppets. Fortunately, it's not just unusual but brilliant -- full of irreverent humor, strange alien species, heart-pounding action and eerie sci-fi.IASA astronaut John Crichton is planning to slingshot his experimental craft, Farscape One, as a one-small-step into interstellar exploration. Instead, he gets thrown through a wormhole, and ends up drifting in a firefight between a vast living prison ship called Moya and the hypermilitaristic Peacekeepers. Obviously, he wants to go home, but isn't sure how.So he begins a journey with a gang of escaped criminals -- the Delvian priestess Zhaan, the bombastic warrior D'Argo, deposed dominar Rygel, and the prickly, surly ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun, and the grafted-into-Moya Pilot. But his new shipmates aren't the only problem for Crichton.Among their problems: shapeshifting space bugs, a mad scientist who decides to transform Aeryn, Peacekeeper bounties on their heads, an energy-sucking sorcerer, a planet of turnip-farming hippies, a primitive planet's power struggles, a cult of insane Delvians, a century-old Peacekeeper with some sadistic personal hobbies, an allergy-causing asteroid, and the unexpected pregnancy of their ship. Yes, Moya gets PREGNANT.But the biggest problem is Crais, a vengeful Peacekeeper commander who is determined to revenge himself on Crichton for the death of his brother. And with the Scarran/Sebacean hybrid Scorpius, he may get the chance to obliterate Moya's crew.Most first seasons of a great show are either utterly brilliant, or are a slow ramp-up to the brilliance that the show will have in the future. ""Farscape: The Complete Season 1"" actually manages to be both -- it introduces a pretty amazing universe, full of flying Muppets, squeaking insectile robots, Leviathans, and blue-skinned telepathic plant people. There are lots of overarcing storylines twined with clever, intricate one-off episodes and solid personal subplots (such as Zhaan's struggle with her darker self).And the dialogue is appallingly awesome (""I'm sure your world has no force so ruthless, so disciplined."" ""Oh, we call them linebackers. Or serial killers, depends on if they're... professional or amateur""). Crichton in particular sprinkles his dialogue with fun pop culture references and quotables (""Out the door, turn left at the creature"") but everybody gets great lines (""Mother always said I was the best looking. That's why she had my older brothers banished"").Ben Browder's Crichton is a thoroughly likable hero -- he seems a bit flaky and utterly fish-out-of-water, but he's also clever, selfless and kind. And while Aeryn is hard-nosed and cold at first, the awesome Claudia Black chips away her iciness and reveals her fears and insecurities. Virginia Hey is brilliant as the walking talking plant-priestess (""You're a VEGETABLE?"") whose serenity hides a terrible past, and Gigi Edgley and Anthony Simcoe give good performances as the rebellious Chiana and hotheaded Luxan warrior. And while Rygel and Pilot are technically played by Muppets, they are gloriously three-dimensional and expressive -- think Yoda, but better.The first season of ""Farscape"" is awash in the glorious, the grotesque, and some really hilarious science fiction stories. A must-see for those who like their space opera with an edge.",5,"There's life out here, Dad.

702546,ARPI7ILEOQ848,B000067IVT,"EnglishTeacher ""scubabear""","[10, 29]","Let me dispense with a few negative comments, and then finish with compliments.1) They used Fox studios in Australia.  If I'd known that Fox had any part in the making tof this film then I wouldn't have bought it.  Fox's politics are reprehensible, and giving them money is a way of rewarding bad behavior.2) Ads.  On several of the DVDs in this set, one is launched AUTOMATICALLY into advertisements for non-Farscape crap, as the DVD launches.  Pushy advertising, on something WE PAID TO SEE, is 100% unacceptable.  On this basis alone, I won't be buying any more in this series, if this is what they do on later DVDs.3) Sometimes the plots are a little ... unoriginal.  Elements like EVERY attractive woman flirting with Our Hero, and characters ALWAYS surviving their exploits, are a little tired.4) Characters are too often bipedal, human-sized, human-lookin'.  One wishes that a SF series would embrace a higher standard of experimentation.OK--- on to the compliments.A) Refreshing dialogue, at times.  Our Hero is a slightly too-super, too-successful guy, but at least he's a normal guy thrust into a spectacular world, and able to SAY all the things that we SF fans would want to say-- &quot;Hey, he looks like Yoda !&quot;  &quot;Shut up, Darth Vader Wannabe !&quot;B) Good special effects.  The DNA Mad Scientist, for example, has refolded legs that bear watching and re-watching...and the lip-synching done on The Pilot and Rigel are terrific. (Although, the sound company and the person who plays Rigel are not present in later seasons.  So, perhaps later seasons won't have this quality.  Drat.)C)  Things EVOLVE.  One annoying aspect of almost any TV series is, things never change.  Episodes can be re-run in any order, with viewers never noticing a change.  FarScape, however, has broken free of this mode.  Episodes make regular references to events earlier on, characters evolve, plots evolve.  Main characters DO get added (and, I hope, subtracted).",3,"Has Unavoidable Ads, &amp; has elements of Fox network in it.",1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,1967,"['Let', 'dispense', 'few', 'negative', 'comments', 'then', 'finish', 'compliments.1', 'used', 'Fox', 'studios', 'Australia', ""'d"", 'known', 'Fox', 'had', 'part', 'making', 'tof', 'film', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'Fox', 'politics', 'are', 'reprehensible', 'giving', 'money', 'way', 'rewarding', 'bad', 'behavior.2', 'Ads', 'several', 'DVDs', 'set', 'one', 'launched', 'AUTOMATICALLY', 'advertisements', 'non-Farscape', 'crap', 'DVD', 'launches', 'Pushy', 'advertising', 'something', 'WE', 'PAID', 'TO', 'SEE', '100', '%', 'unacceptable', 'basis', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'more', 'series', 'what', 'do', 'later', 'DVDs.3', 'plots', 'are', 'little', 'unoriginal', 'Elements', 'EVERY', 'attractive', 'woman', 'flirting', 'Hero', 'characters', 'ALWAYS', 'surviving', 'exploits', 'are', 'little', 'tired.4', 'Characters', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'bipedal', 'human-sized', 'human-lookin', 'One', 'SF', 'series', 'would', 'embrace', 'higher', 'standard', 'experimentation.OK', 'compliments.A', 'Refreshing', 'dialogue', 'times', 'Hero', 'slightly', 'too-super', 'too-successful', 'guy', 'least', 'normal', 'guy', 'thrust', 'spectacular', 'world', 'able', 'SAY', 'things', 'SF', 'fans', 'would', 'want', 'say', 'quot', 'Hey', 'Yoda', 'quot', 'quot', 'Shut', 'up', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'Wannabe', 'quot', 'B', 'Good', 'special', 'effects', 'DNA', 'Mad', 'Scientist', 'example', 'refolded', 'legs', 'bear', 'watching', 're-watching', 'lip-synching', 'done', 'Pilot', 'Rigel', 'are', 'terrific', 'sound', 'company', 'person', 'who', 'Rigel', 'are', 'not', 'present', 'later', 'seasons', 'So', 'perhaps', 'later', 'seasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'quality', 'Drat', 'C', 'Things', 'EVOLVE', 'One', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'almost', 'TV', 'series', 'things', 'never', 'change', 'Episodes', 'can', 'be', 're-run', 'order', 'viewers', 'never', 'noticing', 'change', 'FarScape', 'however', 'broken', 'free', 'mode', 'Episodes', 'make', 'regular', 'references', 'events', 'earlier', 'characters', 'evolve', 'plots', 'evolve', 'Main', 'characters', 'DO', 'get', 'added', 'hope', 'subtracted']",Farscape - The Best of Season One
702547,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000067IVT,Enjolras,"[1, 3]","I love the Hensons work and I love sci-fi shows, so I thought Farscape would be a slam dunk. However, the show just feels amateurish. The acting is at times cringe-worthy, even worse than the old Star Treks.  However, what really undermines the show for me is the pacing. Especially during the first season, it's really slow. The pacing and editing drag the story down rather than give it energy. I found myself getting distracted while watching the show.The dialogue is pretty straightforward - with a few exceptions, nothing memorable or witty. D'argo is like a Klingon, but without the rich cultural layers and energy. Zhaan is sometimes interesting, sometimes boring. Crichton is a bit too much the &#34;all-American&#34; with goofy references to pop culture. Aeryn Sun's character had potential as a former soldier adjusting to life amongst the crew. But so far I haven't fallen in love with any of the characters. There's no Data or Worf from TNG.That said, I have to admit the special effects are pretty good.

702548,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000067IVT,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 4]","Farscape was something I kept hearing about off and on but never really knew much about. The user reviews finally got to me so I thought I'd give it a go. At least the 1st season. I figured I'd better hedge my bet and I'm glad I did. I liked it but not as much as the real fans.First off I need to say I am a fan of Firefly and the two are strikingly similar. But as Firefly debuted in 2002 and Farscape debuted in 1999 I have to give Farscape the nod for format. In both series you have a group of disparate renegades on the run from the powers that be. Each group has a religious person, a soldier type and a guy who thinks out of the box to get them through tense situations.The production values are similar as well. Many/most scenes take place within the ship but the outdoor scenes between the two seem similar, even though Farscape is Australian and Firefly is....American(?). In the 3rd or 4th episode of Farscape, after the exposition has been established, the crew decide to take on a freight job to get enough moolah to keep going. This is the center of nearly every Firefly episode.Some user reviews figure Farscape to be far and away the best TV Sci-Fi series ever. I've not seen the ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboots or ""Stargate"" reboots or some of the others so I can't really say. But as good as it might be, it didn't knock my socks off so I'll probably stop with the the viewing of the first season.",3,Not a HUGE Fan,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1415,"['Farscape', 'was', 'something', 'kept', 'hearing', 'off', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'much', 'user', 'reviews', 'finally', 'got', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'go', 'least', '1st', 'season', 'figured', ""'d"", 'better', 'hedge', 'bet', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'liked', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'real', 'fans.First', 'need', 'say', 'am', 'fan', 'Firefly', 'two', 'are', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'Firefly', 'debuted', '2002', 'Farscape', 'debuted', '1999', 'have', 'give', 'Farscape', 'nod', 'format', 'series', 'have', 'group', 'disparate', 'renegades', 'run', 'powers', 'be', 'group', 'religious', 'person', 'soldier', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'box', 'get', 'tense', 'situations.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'similar', 'well', 'Many/most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'ship', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'two', 'seem', 'similar', 'even', 'Farscape', 'Australian', 'Firefly', '.American', '3rd', '4th', 'episode', 'Farscape', 'exposition', 'been', 'established', 'crew', 'decide', 'take', 'freight', 'job', 'get', 'enough', 'moolah', 'keep', 'going', 'center', 'nearly', 'Firefly', 'episode.Some', 'user', 'reviews', 'figure', 'Farscape', 'be', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'TV', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'reboots', 'Stargate', 'reboots', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'as', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'socks', 'so', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'stop', 'viewing', 'first', 'season']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

702559,A23GV1WCLQUXC4,B000067IVT,Glenda,"[0, 0]","Not only was Farscape one of my all time favorite shows, it has been one of the best kept secrets of the Sci-fi genre.  It's no wonder that when NBC acquired the Scifi network and abruptly canceled Farscape that the outcry among the fans was so loud and long; NBC had no choice but to give them a mini-series on Sci-fi to provide the closure required to such a phenomenal show in 2005, nearly a year and a half after the show was canceled.Filmed in Australia and conceived by Rockne S. O'Bannon and Brian Henson, Farscape used CGI, puppetry of the Henson Creature Shop and lots of special effects, and a large variety of make-up, making it an expensive show to produce per episode.  As a result, the entire first season was shot as the pilot.  The show was highly successful for four seasons, always having a cliff hanger season finale which made the fans hungry for more.  Farscape developed an audience of highly devoted fans growing each year; not since Star Trek, has there been such a following.John Crichton (Ben Browder) and his friend D.K. are conducting a ground breaking experiment to determine if a manned spacecraft can overcome atmospheric friction and exponentially increase its speed using only a planet's gravitational pull to propel a ship further into space; creating the first concrete step toward interstellar travel, if successful.  During the experiment an electromagnetic wave appears and opens a wormhole that John accidentally travels through.  He ends up in the middle of a battle in space, completely oblivious to what is actually going on around him, when a ship clips his module and crashes.  Suddenly his module is being maneuvered onto an extremely huge ship whose control he cannot break.Once aboard, John is forced, by small maintenance robots (Diagnostic Repair Drones) to join the crew, in their frantic attempt to escape their attackers.  Members of the crew attempt to speak to John, but naturally, he doesn't understand, until a DRD painfully inserts something in his foot; a translator microbe that colonizes at the base of the brain to allow each of the aliens (and John) to understand one another.It turns out that John was brought aboard because, to them, his ship appeared out of nowhere, technology they were not familiar with and were hoping would help them to escape.John, in his confusion, learns that he is aboard a bio-mechinoid (living) prison ship, a Leviathan named (Moya), whose only weapon of defense is a technique called starburst, that causes the ship to disappear into a blinding flash of light to teleport to another location.  The ship has three very unique prisoners;General Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) a Luxan warrior,Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan (Virginia Hey), a beautiful Delvian priestess andDominar Rygel the XVI (the voice of Jonathan Hardy) a Hynerian ruler of over 600 billion, deposed from his throne, exiled and imprisoned while he slept.Add to the crew one of their attackers, Officer Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), a violent Sebacean Peace Keeper soldier that happens to look human and you get the start of an interesting show.The pilot of the ship that clipped John on his arrival belonged to the brother of Captain Bialar Crais (Lani Tupu, also the voice of Moya's pilot), the commander of the Peace Keeper ship that was attacking Moya; who does not care or believe that the accident was an accident and vows to kill John to avenge his brother's death.  When Aeryn tries to vouch for John, saying that she does not believe him to be brave enough or smart enough to have attacked Crais' brother or any other Peace Keeper, she is deemed irreversibly contaminated, a crime punishable by death.The ship's crew are strangers that must rely on one another for their survival, not sure if they can trust one another and reluctant to remain together while having nowhere else to go.The result is a never ending escapade of Crichton and the rest of the crew running for their lives and being doggedly pursued by the Peace Keepers and an array of other aliens into the uncharted territories.As the ship's crew travels through space trying to avoid the Peace Keepers they find themselves dealing with problem after problem and for some reason, none of their plans ever works; at least not the way they plan them.The crew of Moya develops a reputation so infamous that they not only are becoming well known throughout the galaxy, they begin drawing the attention of many other powerful Peace Keeper commanders and other alien species.  Moya's crew struggles with the reality that as the number of pursuers of her crew increases, so does the body count attributed to them.  All the while, Crichton, the subject of experiments and alien tortures, struggles to successfully to hold on to what is left of his sanity, as he searches for a way home through the use of wormhole technology he, at first, is unaware he has been gifted and doesn't know how to use.For various reasons they acquire new crew members that are also misfits who cleverly fit into their Jerry Springer type family (John's description) and help to both muck up and save the day.Farscape was a smart, funny, well written, funny, fun and completely action packed show.  One of the things that continue to make Farscape such a successful program is that rarely, if ever, did the writers insult the viewer's intelligence and the viewer is nearly always given a reasonable explanation why a condition exists or happens.  Even now, having been off the air since 2003, Farscape continues to acquire fans worldwide.",5,A real Farscape review,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,5520,"['Not', 'only', 'was', 'Farscape', 'one',

Right up to the point where the Sci-Fi Channel short-sightedly cancelled the show and it ended after 4 seasons on a major cliffhanger.Season One is uneven, especially during the first half, while the writers and production team are trying to find the show's voice and direction. But even mediocre Farscape is better than most other shows at their best, and it becomes clear as the season progresses that (1) this show is not about the FX, the action, or any of the other things most SF shows are about - it's about the characters, who grow and change as time passes,(2) the production team are willing to take major risks with the sotorylines, which typically pays off handsomely, and (3) despite the focus on the characters, the production values are superb (acting, FX, all are absolutely top-notch.)If you like character-driven SF, I can't recommend this enough.

Many believe they may a have put some new effort into the box set by releasing an 12th disc to fit the last case, but all is just speculation.The discs will have the same stuff, down the the very menus, but the cases that they are stored in are being re-designed to fit the first season better. Hopefully the open side will be very presentable like the StarGate SG-1 box sets with un-cluttered spines like many ADV cases never seem to do.

Without a doubt, this is one of the most compelling science fiction television series I've come across; it is clearly a vast improvement over both ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" with respect to the writing and acting. Whether it is really as good as ""Babylon 5"", the best American science fiction television series which ever aired, remains to be determined. I've greatly enjoyed Ben Browder's John Crichton and Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun. I've also marvelled over the special efforts and the excellent puppetry from Henson Entertainment, which have created for television a science fiction space opera series that is unlike any I have seen.

I know how I have missed it since the SCI_FI channel never plays this show, which I have since found out is still the number one show they ever had. But all I can say is WOW!!! This show has blown me away, I bought the season after catching a few minutes of the Peacekeeper Wars on a PBS replay, I turned it off immediately, and ordered the first season because I wanted to know and understand it all. I have now completed season 1 and now am wrapping up Season 2, 3 and 4 and the PK Wars are on the way.This show captures you, I can not watch just one, I am forced to go on and on. I am furious that SCI-FI just up and cancelled such a succesful show simply over cost, that is when you cut back, have a flashback episode, limit and cut back, but do not up and cancel a show when you had a 5 year deal with them. Allowing a 5th season would have done wonders, but I guess SCI FI is happy with the nonsense original movies they keep launching.Anyway if you have the time, make FARSCAPE one of your next purchases, just know once you do, you will be as hooked as I am.

702593,A32BF9QS78G3KL,B000067IVT,J. Winter,"[3, 6]","I'm surprised with the number of 5 star ratings for this show.  Soooo much of it is completely over the top.  They are constantly screaming and yelling, running around like chickens with their heads chopped off.  Firefights are embarrassing as literally 95%-99% of their shots miss, even when shooting from 3 feet in front of the target.  Then their lack of wanting to shoot at anything even when it's obvious they need to.  I.e. the enemy is shooting at them, attacking them and obviously trying to kill them, they will back up and go ""get away or I'll kill you"" then keep backing up, falling over, screaming in pain while they are being attacked, getting stabbed, and so on, but they won't pull the stupid trigger on the gun until it's almost too late, then of course they miss the target even though it's two feet away and the bad guy gets away to attack again later in the episode, sometimes over and over. It gets truly painful to watch.  I'm currently watching Episode 6 from season three ""Eat me"" and the main villain doesn't get shot at at all.  Even though he's just walking around attacking everyone, taking prisoners, etc.  The crew just plays the victim over and over.  Yelling, no no don't don't etc.  Then you notice they all have guns at their side the whole time, but never do they pull one out.  Arrrg!And then many of the episodes themselves have just plain stupid themes.  By the time I got to season 2, I had started skipping episodes because they were just too stupid of a theme. Plus the whole ""we are in this together but we are going to constantly screw each other over every chance we get gets a bit old as well.  I also can't tell you how many times they get taken prisoner and have to be rescued.  probably 1/2 the episodes involve at least someone getting captured and needing to be rescued.With each episode I watch it's gets more and more difficult to watch the next, and I'm a true blue sci-fi/fantasy fan watching tons of stuff that would be considered b movies at best.All and all, I just don't recommend it.",2,Terrible writing,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,2041,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'number', '5', 'star', 'ratings', 'show', 'Soooo', 'much', 'completely', 'top', 'are', 'constantly', 'screaming', 'yelling', 'running', 'around', 'chickens', 'heads', 'chopped', 'off', 'Firefights', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'literally', '95', '%', '-99', '%', 'shots', 'miss', 'even', 'when', 'shooting', '3', 'feet', 'front', 'target', 'Then', 'lack', 'wanting', 'shoot', 'anything', 'even', 'when', 'obvious', 'need', 'I.e', 'enemy', 'shooting', 'attacking', 'obviously', 'trying', 'kill', 'will', 'back', 'up', 'go', 'get', 'away', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'then', 'keep', 'backing', 'up', 'falling', 'over', 'screaming', 'pain', 'are', 'being', 'attacked', 'getting', 'stabbed', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pull', 'stupid', 'trigger', 'gun', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'then', 'course', 'miss', 'target', 'even', 'two', 'feet', 'away', 'bad', 'guy', 'away', 'attack', 'again', 'later', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'truly', 'painful', 'watch', ""'m"", 'currently', 'watching', 'Episode', '6', 'season', 'three', 'Eat', 'main', 'villain', ""n't"", 'get', 'shot', 'Even', 'just', 'walking', 'around', 'attacking', 'everyone', 'taking', 'prisoners', 'etc', 'crew', 'just', 'victim', 'over', 'Yelling', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'etc', 'Then', 'notice', 'have', 'guns', 'side', 'whole', 'time', 'never', 'do', 'pull', 'one', 'out', 'then', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'themes', 'time', 'got', 'season', '2', 'had', 'started', 'skipping', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'theme', 'whole', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'going', 'constantly', 'screw', 'other', 'chance', 'get', 'bit', 'old', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'get', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'have', 'be', 'rescued', 'probably', '1/2', 'episodes', 'involve', 'least', 'someone', 'getting', 'captured', 'needing', 'be', 'rescued.With', 'episode', 'watch', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'next', ""'m"", 'true', 'blue', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'fan', 'watching', 'tons', 'stuff', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'b', 'movies', 'best.All', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

The universe in which it takes place, the approach to creature effects, the pop-culture influences are all amazing.  This show is, in my opinion, the only successful blend of a voice from the present in a futuristic world, and we have Ben Browder's performance to thank for that.

702630,AAD3V7FQUXO2Z,B000067IVT,Nathan Alderman,"[30, 33]","If you don't know what Farscape's about, Amazon's plot synopsis will give you an idea much better than I could. Here's what makes Farscape Season 1 special:- Irreverent humor. Farscape's unique among sci-fi shows in that its hero is himself a sci-fi fan. Seeing Ben Browder's John Crichton toss off references to Star Wars, Star Trek and other classic sci-fi tales is funny. Seeing his alien crewmates' puzzled reactions is even funnier.- Unpredictability. Like Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Farscape gleefully takes all the worn-out stereotypes of its genre and blows them to pieces. If you're used to sci-fi where the good guys never make mistakes, and you always know how the show will end well before the third act, get ready for something very different.- An unconventional hero. In later seasons, tragic and fairly nasty experiences will lead John Crichton to adopt a draw-your-gun-first, ask-later viewpoint. In Season 1 he's still full of wonder and scientific curiosity, and he's prone to think his way out of a crisis rather than relying on firepower.- An equally unusual crew dynamic. Later seasons see the crew getting along more or less harmoniously. Season 1 allows new viewers the genuine treat of watching a group of irritable and potentially dangerous protagonists forced to work together to save their own lives. Moya's crew members don't always like or trust one another, and it makes for satisfying and intriguing entertainment.If you've ever wished that someone would apply Buffy's signature mix of humor, darkness and intelligence to space opera; if you've ever wondered what Star Trek would be like without that gigantic stick up its port nacelle; or if you're simply curious to see what the company that brought you The Muppet Show can do with science fiction... Farscape will thrill and entertain you tremendously.",4,An excellent launching point for one of TV's best.,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,1835,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Farscape', 'about', 'Amazon', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'will', 'give', 'idea', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'Here', 'what', 'Farscape', 'Season', '1', 'special', 'Irreverent', 'humor', 'Farscape', 'unique', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'hero', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'Seeing', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'John', 'Crichton', 'off', 'references', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'other', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'tales', 'funny', 'Seeing', 'alien', 'crewmates', 'puzzled', 'reactions', 'even', 'funnier.-', 'Unpredictability', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Farscape', 'gleefully', 'worn-out', 'stereotypes', 'genre', 'pieces', ""'re"", 'used', 'sci-fi', 'where', 'good', 'guys', 'never', 'make', 'mistakes', 'always', 'know', 'how', 'show', 'will', 'end', 'well', 'third', 'act', 'get', 'ready', 'something', 'very', 'different.-', 'unconventional', 'hero', 'later', 'seasons', 'tragic', 'fairly', 'nasty', 'experiences', 'will', 'lead', 'John', 'Crichton', 'adopt', 'draw-your-gun-first', 'ask-later', 'viewpoint', 'Season', '1', 'still', 'full', 'wonder', 'scientific', 'curiosity', 'prone', 'think', 'way', 'crisis', 'rather', 'relying', 'firepower.-', 'equally', 'unusual', 'crew', 'dynamic', 'Later', 'seasons', 'see', 'crew', 'getting', 'along', 'more', 'less', 'harmoniously', 'Season', '1', 'new', 'viewers', 'genuine', 'treat', 'watching', 'group', 'irritable', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'protagonists', 'forced', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'own', 'lives', 'Moya', 'crew', 'members', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'like', 'trust', 'one', 'satisfying', 'intriguing', 'entertainment.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wished', 'someone', 'would', 'apply', 'Buffy', 'signature', 'mix', 'humor', 'darkness', 'intelligence', 'space', 'opera', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'Star', 'Trek', 'would', 'be', 'gigantic', 'stick', 'up', 'port', 'nacelle', ""'re"", 'simply', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'company', 'brought', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'can', 'do', 'science', 'fiction', 'Farscape', 'will', 'thrill', 'entertain', 'tremendously']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 3]","When Farscape premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1999, there was something about it that set it apart from other original shows that aired on the cable channel: it was good.  Working from conventions associated with Star Trek and Babylon 5, Farscape took leaps and steps beyond the grain by having vast production sets, amazing and imaginitive make up and effects, and superb writing.  As the series begins, we are introduced to astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder), whose experiment in wormhole technology sling shots him to the other side of the universe where he finds himself in the middle of an interstellar prison break.  Now, John is a passenger on board a living ship called Moya, and he finds himself allied with the convict alien beings on board including the warrior Dargo (Anthony Simcoe), a blue skinned priestess named Zhaan (Virginia Hey), and an exiled diminutive king named Rygel who is brought to life via Jim Henson's Creature Shop.  John is also the target of the Peacekeepers, a group of intergalactic, fascist cops who are similar to humans, and renegade Peacekeeper Aeryn (Claudia Black) is also a passenger on board Moya, as John finds himself inexplicably drawn to her.  Later on in the season, we are introduced to who would become Crichton's arch nemesis, the nefarious Scorpious (Wayne Pygram) who will do anything to get the wormhole technology that a whole war will develop over.  This is just skimming the surface of the series however, as there is much more to be had as revelations are abound, and the season finale will have you salivating for more.  All in all, the first season of Farscape marked the way sci-fi TV should be: intelligent, amusing, cerebral, and full of brilliant ideas.",5,Brilliant since the beginning,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1723,"['When', 'Farscape', 'premiered', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', '1999', 'was', 'something', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'original', 'shows', 'aired', 'cable', 'channel', 'was', 'good', 'Working', 'conventions', 'associated', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Babylon', '5', 'Farscape', 'took', 'leaps', 'steps', 'grain', 'having', 'vast', 'production', 'sets', 'amazing', 'imaginitive', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'superb', 'writing', 'series', 'are', 'introduced', 'astronaut', 'John', 'Crichton', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'experiment', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'sling', 'shots', 'other', 'side', 'universe', 'where', 'middle', 'interstellar', 'prison', 'break', 'Now', 'John', 'passenger', 'board', 'living', 'ship', 'called', 'Moya', 'allied', 'convict', 'alien', 'beings', 'board', 'including', 'warrior', 'Dargo', 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', 'blue', 'skinned', 'priestess', 'named', 'Zhaan', 'Virginia', 'Hey', 'exiled', 'diminutive', 'king', 'named', 'Rygel', 'who', 'brought', 'life', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Creature', 'Shop', 'John', 'also', 'target', 'Peacekeepers', 'group', 'intergalactic', 'fascist', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'similar', 'humans', 'renegade', 'Peacekeeper', 'Aeryn', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'also', 'passenger', 'board', 'Moya', 'John', 'inexplicably', 'drawn', 'Later', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Crichton', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'nefarious', 'Scorpious', 'Wayne', 'Pygram', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'whole', 'war', 'will', 'develop', 'over', 'just', 'skimming', 'surface', 'series', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'had', 'revelations', 'are', 'abound', 'season', 'finale', 'will', 'have', 'salivating', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'Farscape', 'marked', 'way', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'should', 'be', 'intelligent', 'amusing', 'cerebral', 'full', 'brilliant', 'ideas']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

There are elements of this series that are reminiscent of &#34;Buck Rogers In The 25th Century&#34; with Gil Gerard back in the seventies.  Where Buck Rogers was a man out of time, John Crichton became a human out of place.  Due to an experiment in space travel gone wrong this John Wayne like astronaut finds himself far from home.  The aliens who become his companions, tutors and sometimes students take the viewer on a journey of alien worlds, cultures and  ways of thinking.This story is truly one of the most innovative ideas in contemporary science fiction.  Ironically, John Crichton played by Ben Browder is an astronaut forced to live among aliens with no way to get home thanks to a wormhole accident.  Ben Browder later joined SG1 and traveled through wormholes each weak to the series' conclusion.  In this case he was the human who forced himself onto aliens and experienced the politics of his own people not mixing with other cultures.Ben Browder's most recent experience in Sci Fi allowed him to play out his John Wayne like image to its ultimate expression as the sheriff of an old west town in an episode of Doctor Who.One thing is for sure, Ben Browder seems destined to be a human among aliens in much of his career and for those who loved the pseudo western sci-fi of Firefly, Farscape is a good option to feel that same sense of testosterone driven, semi-sci-fi, semi-western persona on a large scale.",5,More inventive than Star Trek,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,1540,"['Who', 'ever', 'thought', 'create', 'story', 'human', 'was', 'straight', 'man', 'alien', 'characters', 'technology', 'are', 'elements', 'series', 'are', 'reminiscent', '34', 'Buck', 'Rogers', '25th', 'Century', '34', 'Gil', 'Gerard', 'back', 'seventies', 'Where', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'was', 'man', 'time', 'John', 'Crichton', 'became', 'human', 'place', 'Due', 'experiment', 'space', 'travel', 'gone', 'wrong', 'John', 'Wayne', 'astronaut', 'finds', 'far', 'home', 'aliens', 'who', 'become', 'companions', 'tutors', 'sometimes', 'students', 'take', 'viewer', 'journey', 'alien', 'worlds', 'cultures', 'ways', 'thinking.This', 'story', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'contemporary', 'science', 'fiction', 'Ironically', 'John', 'Crichton', 'played', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'astronaut', 'forced', 'live', 'aliens', 'way', 'get', 'home', 'thanks', 'wormhole', 'accident', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'later', 'joined', 'SG1', 'traveled', 'wormholes', 'weak', 'series', 'conclusion', 'case', 'was', 'human', 'who', 'forced', 'aliens', 'experienced', 'politics', 'own', 'people', 'not', 'mixing', 'other', 'cultures.Ben', 'Browder', 'most', 'recent', 'experience', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'allowed', 'play', 'out', 'John', 'Wayne', 'image', 'ultimate', 'expression', 'sheriff', 'old', 'west', 'town', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'Who.One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'destined', 'be', 'human', 'aliens', 'much', 'career', 'who', 'loved', 'pseudo', 'western', 'sci-fi', 'Firefly', 'Farscape', 'good', 'option', 'feel', 'same', 'sense', 'testosterone', 'driven', 'semi-sci-fi', 'semi-western', 'persona', 'large', 'scale']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

During the experiment Crichton is catapulted through a wormhole and into a far distant part of the galaxy, smack-dab in the middle of a prison escape. Three dangerous alien criminals have taken over their prison-vessel and are being pursued by the galaxy's military arm: the Peacekeepers. After accidentally causing the death of the Peacekeeper Captain Crais's brother, Crichton falls in with the convicts on board their ship: an organic and sentient vessel known as Moya. Moya is piloted by a forth alien aptly named ""Pilot,"" who acts as mediator between ship and crew, and who is complicit in her rejection of the Peacekeeper control collar.Ironically, these escaped prisoners are Crichton's best chance for survival in this strange new world. They include the warrior D'Argo, the mystical priestess Zhaan, and the dispossessed monarch Rygel, each with their own mysterious back-stories centered on the crimes that originally landed them in custody. Seeing no other alternative, they grudgingly admit Crichton into their crew. But also on board is Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun, exiled after she deemed contaminated by extended exposure to the convicts. With nowhere else to go, she remains aboard Moya.Now she's wanted along with the rest of the crew, a pursuit that is expounded by Crais's desire for vengeance against the man who ""murdered"" his brother. With single-minded intensity Crais hunts the fugitives across uncharted space, much akin to Captain Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick (a fitting analogy considering Moya, like the famous white whale, is known as a ""leviathan""). This motley crew is forced to work together in order to survive, evade the law, and adapt to the living conditions in a ship that is alive, conscious, and infinitely mysterious - such interactions make up the emotional backbone of the show.The first three-quarters of Farscape's first season are rather episodic. No episode impinges on the next, and the events therein are so self-contained that they are often never again mentioned by characters after they occur. Without the presence of a strong story-arc, it does initially feel a little random at times. However, toward the end of the season things become a little clearer. Plots are tighter and the stakes are raised, particularly in the two-part special ""Nerve"" and ""The Hidden Memory."" By this stage the consequences of crucial events are carried on from one episode to the next, and reoccurring characters help to make us feel as though we're watching an unfolding multi-part story rather than a series of singular episodes that are constantly being clean-slated.Before the plotting and characterization really begins to take off, the show's biggest draw-card is its stunning visual style. Designers utilize full-body prosthetics and make-up, expansive sets, gorgeous costumes, elaborate puppetry (courtesy of the Jim Henson Company) and surprisingly sophisticated CGI to make ""Farscape"" a feast for the eyes. From the organic halls of Moya to the starscapes of the galaxy, from the hours that the actors must have endured in order to don their costumes, to the expressive mannerisms of Rygel (who you soon forget is a puppet and regard as a fully-realized character), everything is crafted with an incredible eye for detail.This is especially true of the cast of colorful characters that make up the main cast. Ben Browser plays Crichton as a surprisingly easy-going astronaut who relies on a constant stream of pop-culture references to keep his sanity intact. He's the typical all-American hero, a personality in stark contrast to Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun, the exiled Peacekeeper who also has to cope with a new life completely removed from all that she's known. Efficient, intolerant and droll, she ends up being the funniest character of the season what with her increasing exasperation with her surroundings.D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) is the typical proud, brash warrior, with elaborate facial accruements and a volatile temper, and yet is allowed to display on several occasions both a gentle side and a sense of humor, whereas Virginia Hey endures blue body-paint as an alien priestess whose calm and wise exterior hides a darker side to her personality. This core cast is joined later in the game by Chiana (Gigi Edgley), a devious little fiend who would like nothing better than to rob them all blind, but whose sense of fun keeps her hanging around the one ship that's guaranteed to get her into trouble.At first glance, each would seem to be basic archetypes (the stoic warrior, the mystic, the trickster, etc) but the actors are talented enough to bypass any initial clich&eacute;s, and the writers soon follow up with stories that delve into each character's past. In such a large ensemble cast, it's easy to pick a favorite character and watch their development unfold.The first season of ""Farscape"" is all about the actors, writers and audience settling into the show. With viewer's interest piqued, it's a strong base upon which to build bigger, richer stories and to expand on the characters and world that is already well-established by the finale. Ending on something of a cliff-hanger, the season as a whole is entertaining, imaginative, exciting, amusing, visually splendid, and a promising start to a strong story arc and a great show.",5,"""There's Life Out Here.

702655,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000067IVT,Robert Moore,"[8, 8]","This DVD set is perplexing.  The television series FARSCAPE is one of the finest television shows of recent years, and is unquestionably one of the great Sci-Fi series in the history of television, joining a short list of shows such as the various Star Trek series, BABYLON FIVE, and FIREFLY.  Apart from the various design and technical problems that other reviewers have noted, it is very definitely not priced to own.  While comparable series--such as the BUFFY THE VAMPIRE and ANGEL sets--currently retail for $60, this set retails for $150! making it one of the most expensive series available anywhere.I should dock the set a star for the cost and/or the poor design, but it is such a superb show that it is almost impossible to do so.  FARSCAPE comes across as STAR TREK: VOYAGER crossed with the pop cultural savvy of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  In some ways it is a very traditional Sci-Fi series in bringing together a group of humanoid aliens for a journey across space.  It is, however, unusual in the degree to which it makes the characters differ from one another.  For instance, on of the major characters is actually a plant-based life form, one humanoid is especially sensitive to heat, another has three stomachs, while all have significantly better eyesight than the lone human on the ship.  The ship itself is alive, helped made believable by having bonded with a pilot who can speak for the ship.  All of this stretches the Sci-Fi genre in new and interesting ways.  Only FIREFLY has surpassed it in breaking down traditional Sci-Fi conventions (e.g., by having no aliens at all).The show in the first season is often flawed.  The acting isn't always the greatest (Ben Browder is appealing as John Crichton, but he is not Laurence Olivier), and I personally detest the puppet character Rygel (though the puppet Pilot is superbly done).  Although there is an overall arc, too often the show has a stand-alone feel to the episodes.  Inevitably in a show like this, where alien life forms constantly tax the powers of invention, some of the aliens are less than convincing.  Nonetheless, the sheer inventiveness and passion of the show's makers overcomes all lesser deficiencies.  Most of all the show succeeds because everyone involved is willing to take chances.The first season introduces several of the major characters who will appear in the series as a whole, beginning with John Crichton, a human, an astronaut who accidentally enters a worm hole in an experimental early 21st century spacecraft and pops out in a completely different part of the universe.  He enters a living spaceship named Moya where he meets and eventually befriends (though only gradually) a warrior named D'Argo, a priestess named Zhaan, a flatulent toad-like dethroned emperor named Rygel, and the ships pilot.  They quite accidentally take on a Peacekeeper (they are the chief bad guys on the show) who is forced to join them named Aeryn Sun (played by the beautiful and talented Claudia Black).  Later in the season they shelter the catlike Chiana.  While the first season is not as good as the show would get in later seasons, it was by any standard a most auspicious beginning.Anyone who loves Sci-Fi will love this.  I only hope that they bring out an affordable edition of this otherwise superb television show.",5,Great show but a disappointing DVD set,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,3315,"['DVD', 'set', 'perplexing', 'television', 'series', 'FARSCAPE', 'one', 'finest', 'television', 'shows', 'recent', 'years', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'great', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'history', 'television', 'joining', 'short', 'list', 'shows', 'such', 'various', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'BABYLON', 'FIVE', 'FIREFLY', 'Apart', 'various', 'design', 'technical', 'problems', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'very', 'definitely', 'not', 'priced', 'own', 'comparable', 'series', 'such', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'ANGEL', 'sets', 'currently', 'retail', '60', 'set', '150', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'expensive', 'series', 'available', 'anywhere.I', 'should', 'dock', 'set', 'star', 'cost', 'poor', 'design', 'such', 'superb', 'show', 'almost', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'FARSCAPE', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'VOYAGER', 'crossed', 'pop', 'cultural', 'savvy', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ways', 'very', 'traditional', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'bringing', 'together', 'group', 'humanoid', 'aliens', 'journey', 'space', 'however', 'unusual', 'degree', 'characters', 'differ', 'one', 'instance', 'major', 'characters', 'actually', 'plant-based', 'life', 'form', 'one', 'humanoid', 'especially', 'sensitive', 'heat', 'three', 'stomachs', 'have', 'significantly', 'better', 'eyesight', 'lone', 'human', 'ship', 'ship', 'alive', 'helped', 'made', 'believable', 'having', 'bonded', 'pilot', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'ship', 'Sci-Fi', 'genre', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'Only', 'FIREFLY', 'surpassed', 'breaking', 'down', 'traditional', 'Sci-Fi', 'conventions', 'e.g.', 'having', 'aliens', '.The', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'often', 'flawed', 'acting', ""n't"", 'always', 'greatest', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'appealing', 'John', 'Crichton', 'not', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'personally', 'detest', 'puppet', 'character', 'Rygel', 'puppet', 'Pilot', 'superbly', 'done', 'overall', 'arc', 'too', 'often', 'show', 'stand-alone', 'feel', 'episodes', 'Inevitably', 'show', 'where', 'alien', 'life', 'forms', 'constantly', 'tax', 'powers', 'invention', 'aliens', 'are', 'less', 'convincing', 'Nonetheless', 'sheer', 'inventiveness', 'passion', 'show', 'makers', 'lesser', 'deficiencies', 'Most', 'show', 'everyone', 'involved', 'willing', 'take', 'chances.The', 'first', 'season', 'introduces', 'several', 'major', 'characters', 'who', 'will', 'appear', 'series', 'whole', 'beginning', 'John', 'Crichton', 'human', 'astronaut', 'who', 'accidentally', 'worm', 'hole', 'experimental', 'early', '21st', 'century', 'spacecraft', 'out', 'completely', 'different', 'part', 'universe', 'living', 'spaceship', 'named', 'Moya', 'where', 'eventually', 'befriends', 'only', 'gradually', 'warrior', 'named', ""D'Argo"", 'priestess', 'named', 'Zhaan', 'flatulent', 'toad-like', 'dethroned', 'emperor', 'named', 'Rygel', 'ships', 'pilot', 'quite', 'accidentally', 'take', 'Peacekeeper', 'are', 'chief', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'who', 'forced', 'join', 'named', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'played', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'Later', 'season', 'shelter', 'catlike', 'Chiana', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'show', 'would', 'get', 'later', 'seasons', 'was', 'standard', 'most', 'auspicious', 'beginning.Anyone', 'who', 'Sci-Fi', 'will', 'love', 'only', 'hope', 'bring', 'out', 'affordable', 'edition', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'television', 'show']",Farscape - The Best of Season One

Darko, the alien warrior; Aerin, the former Peacekeeper; the priestess Zann; and the pompous, arrogant, selfish Hinerian, Rigel.Many of the creatures are made with Animatronics which is really fascinating and different to see, produced by the Jim Henson Company (Sesame Street, etc.).  Brian Henson, the producer on the show, gives a couple of programs, a ""making of"" where he explains why the Australian area was the best place to film.Production Value:They didn't know how to do a fight scene with gymnastics, or how do you shoot with a green screen and process shooting.  They had to make up new ways for all this.  The result is one of the best polished science fiction program, unique and new, so innovative a series as Far-Scape.Brian gives a lot of kudos to the SyFy Channel in picking up the show.  The show ran for four seasons!""Creative liberating, logistically tough,"" says Brian.Episodes:Yeah, I'll give you a list, but I want to say a few of my favorites.  All of the episodes deal with Captain Crace, who wants revenge against John Crichton for killing the captain's brother (it was an accident).I liked the shows where the biomechanic ship Moya had her baby and how the ship was trying to give birth to a new ship with weapons.Or another show where John mistakenly assumes Moya has abandoned him and ends up on a green planet full of men and women who are like the Native Americans of today and where the women pick their mates.Another show introduced Scorpius, a real bad, juicy Nazi-like character.Episodes:' Premiere  #10101' I, E.T.  #10102' Exodus from Genesis  #10103' Throne for a Loss  #10104' Back and Back and Back to the Future  #10105' Thank God it's Friday.

702672,A3V43IU15LA3HA,B000067IVT,snow47,"[0, 0]","I felt that it might be useful to give my brief opinion on Season 1 of Farscape. This is the only season that I have watched, so I cannot comment on the subsequent progression of the show. However, based on this season, it truly astounds me that other reviewers say things like &#34;arguably the best SF ever produced for television&#34; and so forth. I almost wonder if I was watching the same show as them.But I will allow that maybe it gets better. The first season is very slow, and does not even become baseline interesting (for me) until maybe the latter third of its episodes. It took me well over a year to watch Season 1, because I lost interest early and only came back many months later because I was bored and did not have anything else on hand. It does get better with episodes like &#34;Nerve&#34; and &#34;Bone to be Wild&#34; and once the character Scorpius is introduced. Great? No, but decent.Have you heard/read the premise for this show? An astronaut gets sucked by a wormhole to someplace else in the universe? Not a revolutionary concept, but okay. He finds himself in the middle of a jailbreak, surrounded by aliens? More like gets drunk and wakes up on the set of a much less witty version of the Muppet Show. I love the Muppets, but most of these feel more like puppets (the pilot being the exception). They are all on a living spaceship? More like they're all on a nice television set that we are repeatedly told is a living spaceship. Claudia Black's character is an alien? Yes, but she looks like a human, just with invisibly different physiology. I say all of these things not to insult this show, but to point out that it's not quite as actually exotic or fantastic as it sounds. Again, maybe in Season 2+ it does live up to its hype. But not in Season 1.The most unique thing about this show is its incorporation of Henson creatures, i.e. basically sci-fi Muppets and imaginitive costume and makeup creations. A few of them are outstanding, such as the pilot, the menacing catlike &#34;DNA Mad Scientist&#34; character and a few others. But some of them are like Halloween costumes, or cheap puppets. So this show cannot sell itself as too terribly serious. Okay, but does it have lots of humor? Not from my perspective. Ben Browder's character is a wisecracking, pop-culture-referencing type, but that only goes so far. The acting is not anything too outstanding. Is the writing good? Occasionally, but for as much people talk about Farscape being unique or surprising, Season 1 at least feels like just another cliche-ridden, predictable sci-fi series. Probably great if you are a kid. I really mean that. But as an adult, it just feels flat.I love science fiction television, including most of the Star Trek versions (maybe not Voyager). I adore Babylon 5 and Firefly, and have a lot of respect for Battlestar Galactica. I've watched all ten seasons of Stargate SG-1. Amongst all of those, Farscape is clearly at the bottom in my opinion. Now, there is no accounting for subjective tastes. But making a case for this show as one of the greatest in sci-fi television seems like unwarranted hyperbole to me.

Sadly I was one who could not devote my friday nights to watching a show but I knew I was missing out on something special. Thanks to TV on DVD I can make up for past mistakes. Watching this show is such a treat, not only are all the witty pop references hilarious, but the Jim Henson company have done wonders and truly show why they are still the best despite the wide use of CGI instead of electronics. It sorta makes you wonder why George Lucas didn't incorporate their talents for the new Star Wars movies.

I am not even halfway done with season 1 and I am in complete awe at it's instant character development. Everytime you THINK you have a character figured out something comes up that makes them more conflicted, complex, and far more interesting then they were before. It truly takes risks with it's material and plot twists. I am now a fan (far too late I'm afraid) but I do look forward to experiencing all 4 seasons thanks to the greatness of TV on DVD.It's not just hype. This show was proof that TV doesn't have to be mindless reality shows or cliche family  sitcoms. If you're into Farscape I highly suggest Buffy the Vampire Slayer (has alot of character depth as well) or the X-Files.

702700,A2JA7C0WEMB1M7,B000067IVT,"Virgil ""Virgil""","[116, 125]","Farscape is arguably the best SF ever produced for television. It takes a fairly common storyline of a group of travelers thrown together and being pursued by individual of near obsessive (and evil) qualities. This formula has gone bad before in several genres, western, SF, road movies etc. Here, an contemporary American astronaut is sucked through a wormhole into another side of the galaxy where he is immediately caught up in a ""prison break"" in space. What makes Farscape so successful is a mixture of qualities.First the casting is excellent. Filmed in Australia, most of the characters (except the lead, John Crighton's) are from there giving it an ""off"" feel to American ears which contributes to it's alieness. Each of the character's is part colorful stereotype, has weaknesses and is extremely individual. The chemistry is fantastic, especially after the first two or three shows in the series. Especially notworthy is the chemistry between the love interests played by Claudia Black and Ben Browder (John Crighton).Another plus is the writing. Non-stop action and story telling is the hallmark of this series. Little time is spent creating mood or atmosphere (that is done by the characters and background), everything advances the plot line. Additionally, most episodes are connected in that previous storylines are built upon and create a chronology of events for the later stories.Farscape space is inhabited by aliens who pass gas, burp, have intimate relations, love, hate, get hungry and can be fairly dirty in their habits. Add to this the great cultural references made by Crighton, the viewer gets the feeling that this is a bit like what space would really be like. A far cry from the antiseptic cleanliness and ""wonder"" of the Star Trek franchise.Lastly Farscape has a timeline in the sense that it's not an endless variety of adventures for no particular reason there is an actual endstate the writers and producers have in mind at the end of the series.Let's hope that Sci Fi Channel has the good sense to let Farscape complete its last season and reverse its cancellation.

He's in new territory never experienced by a human before. That's not to say that his primative spacecraft (a modified Space Shuttle)couldn't hold its own--Crichton's quite proud of his little ship and he should be because it's propelled us and him into the best written show on television.It all happened one stormy evening in 1998 on, of all places, the sci-fi channel (yes, the same folks who cling to inept series like Crossing Over and that new ... dream interpretation program). This was when the channel actually had ambition. Between Dune and Farscape, Sci-Fi managed to trump all the networks. Not only did they have the best adaption of a science fiction novel for television (anybody remember the wretched Martian Chronciles?)but they also [took] the crow from Star Trek.Ben Browder is terrific as sarcastic, energetic and confused (at least for the first season)John Crichton. When Scorpius is finally introduced the series really gained steam; he's the ultimate villian akin to Q from Trek but without any redeeming social value. Any television series is only as good as its villans and Farscape has terrific bad guys hidden up every sleeve.The DVD collection basically collates the entire single disc two episode releases. There's no additional extras that I could see--but each disc already came with audio commentary on key episodes by creator Rockne O'Bannon and the cast, as well as, previous unseen footage. There's also deleted scenes on a number of the discs and production notes, etc. So while this doesn't have anything new to add to the mix, bit does bring together the entire set in an affordable package (you'd pay twice as much to buy individual disc). Since the discs are arranged chronologically, if you buy some there's a good chance you'll get both the duds and the classic episodes and miss out on some of the best episodes.The packaging isn't anything to write home about (unlike, say The Next Generation) and the information enclosed isn't all that great (unlike, say, the Back to the Future set)but you get them all the good, the bad and the ugly.

I kinda expected one total package that folded out like most other seasons you'll find. For all I know there is a version of season one like that. If there is I'll kick myself later.

The story lines, characters, action, and sci-fi cinematography, etc., was pretty advanced for its time as well as within its (frequently painfully obvious) low budget.

There's no way - after having it for free - that I'm compelled to buy the product or rent it for any price. I'll find a friend who's got it and borrow it.
