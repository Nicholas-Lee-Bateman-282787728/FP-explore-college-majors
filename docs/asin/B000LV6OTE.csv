1040784,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000LV6OTE,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","The film focuses on a powerful moving drama of a young boy, Eero, 9, is confused with the emotions of abandonment, rejection, love and acceptance.  Haunted by the past, 60ish Eero confronts his mother about what transpired in his youth.Told in flashback, the story begins during WWII, Young Eero's father has died.  He is one of 70,000 Finnish children who were sent to Sweden families for temporary custody and safety.  Eero is sent to a childless family where he doesn't understand the language, is unwanted by the surrogate mother, Signe, more accepting by the father Hjalmar, and often confused about the whereabouts of his own mother, confused by her actions.Although the relationship between Signe and Eero is cold and distant, predictably, the mood changes when Signe confides in Eero the truth about the death of their child.The 2005 film is based upon a book but directed by Klaus Haro and received numerous awards for his second film.  His fame is his debut filmElina: As If I Wasn't There ( Elina - Som om jag inte fanns )].  Notice the ""Film Movement"" on the packaging, a company that distributes foreign films that have otherwise, not been accessible in the mainstream.  The films are quality, good writing, with great directing and actors.About the film, Klaus Haro, the director, said:  ...... we can  capture something universal in the feelings of exclusion and rootlessness that we associate with the experiences of the war children. The themes are strongly relevant to any child who has been separated from his/her parents, to anyone for whom growing up has generally been hard due to the secrets they carry in their heart"".This is true, many people will be touched by this film, understanding the anguish of abandonment, rejection, love, acceptance, etc.The cinematography illustrates beautiful sweeping views of  the countryside, beautiful but low key mood music.  The film is touching, see it with the entire family. .....Rizzo",5,A touching film that many will relate to,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,1948,"['film', 'powerful', 'moving', 'drama', 'young', 'boy', 'Eero', '9', 'confused', 'emotions', 'abandonment', 'rejection', 'love', 'acceptance', 'Haunted', 'past', '60ish', 'Eero', 'confronts', 'mother', 'what', 'transpired', 'youth.Told', 'flashback', 'story', 'WWII', 'Young', 'Eero', 'father', 'died', 'one', '70,000', 'Finnish', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'sent', 'Sweden', 'families', 'temporary', 'custody', 'safety', 'Eero', 'sent', 'childless', 'family', 'where', ""n't"", 'understand', 'language', 'unwanted', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'Signe', 'more', 'accepting', 'father', 'Hjalmar', 'often', 'confused', 'whereabouts', 'own', 'mother', 'confused', 'relationship', 'Signe', 'Eero', 'cold', 'distant', 'predictably', 'mood', 'changes', 'when', 'Signe', 'Eero', 'truth', 'death', 'child.The', '2005', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'directed', 'Klaus', 'Haro', 'received', 'numerous', 'awards', 'second', 'film', 'fame', 'debut', 'filmElina', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Elina', 'Som', 'om', 'jag', 'inte', 'fanns', ']', 'Notice', 'Film', 'Movement', 'packaging', 'company', 'foreign', 'films', 'have', 'otherwise', 'not', 'been', 'accessible', 'mainstream', 'films', 'are', 'quality', 'good', 'writing', 'great', 'directing', 'film', 'Klaus', 'Haro', 'director', 'said', 'can', 'capture', 'something', 'universal', 'feelings', 'exclusion', 'rootlessness', 'associate', 'experiences', 'war', 'children', 'themes', 'are', 'strongly', 'relevant', 'child', 'who', 'been', 'separated', 'his/her', 'parents', 'anyone', 'whom', 'growing', 'up', 'generally', 'been', 'hard', 'due', 'secrets', 'carry', 'heart', '.This', 'true', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'film', 'understanding', 'anguish', 'abandonment', 'rejection', 'love', 'acceptance', 'etc.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'sweeping', 'views', 'countryside', 'beautiful', 'low', 'key', 'mood', 'music', 'film', 'touching', 'see', 'entire', 'family', '..Rizzo']",N/A

I can only say that the setting of the film is spectacular, the acting flawless, casting is perfect for the requirements of each role, and the progression of human emotions in this heart-wrenching story reaches deep into one's soul, making one realize just how vulnerable our children are and how indispensable mother's love really is.

This film personalizes that history by focusing on one family's story. The film begins when Eero Lahti makes an emotional return to Sweden as an adult for the funeral of the mother who welcomed him into their home, and with him confessing to his aged mother about his lifelong feelings of abandonment by her. The movie then reverts to 1943 when Eero was only nine years old. The Swedish host family, Hjalmar and Signe, had its own motives, both good and bad, for hosting a ""war child"" from Finland, and then its own ways of dealing with Eero once he was with them. Eero's biological mother, Kirsti, had her own deeply mixed emotions of guilt, regret, and love, along with horrible choices to make during the war. In between these two mothers is little Eero who as an adult still deals with the psychological complexities of two mothers who loved him in their deeply human but broken ways.

""Mother of Mine"" is set in Finland and southern Sweden in the last years of World War II, but war per se is only a backdrop, a cause without a Cause, to the tragedy of the boy Eero, whose father has been killed in battle and whose mother sends him away for his own safety. Eero is twelve years old, speaks only Finnish, but he is taken to live on a farm in Skne, a rural province of Sweden, by an agency that transported at least 70,000 Finnish children as refugees to such safety. The Swedish family that accepts Eero has recently been traumatized by the death of their own child, and the Mother find's Eero's arrival horribly painful. Meanwhile, Eero's natural mother has found another ""man"" to love; she will eventually need to choose between the new man and the son whom she's given away.The film narrative is structured as a 'flashback' in the mind of Eero as a 70-year-old man, summoned to the funeral in Sweden of his adoptive mother. Returning from Sweden, Eero visits his birth mother in a nursing home, despite the truth that he has never reconciled himself to her 'abandonment' of him. In a lovely reversal of the usual cinematography, the story of Eero's boyhood is filmed in color, while Eero's visitations after most of a lifetime are filmed in black-and-white.The War, nevertheless, was a presence in my mind while watching this film, possibly because I spent some of my own childhood in Sweden, possibly because I'm just old enough to remember the post-war years clearly. Finland was aligned with Germany in that War; Eero's father fought against the ""Allies"", specifically against Russia, and Eero's mother worked for the German Occupation Forces. Her new lover was a German soldier. Sweden was purportedly a 'neutral' country, but Swedes of a certain age will forever feel a certain discomfort about that neutrality, which allowed the Germans to transit and attack Norway. At the same time, large numbers of Norwegian Jews fled to Sweden for asylum, and it's true that throngs of Finnish children were fostered during and after the War. It's also true that children of many nations were separated from the families and sheltered in foreign lands. The greatest WW II novel of all, in my opinion -- Austerlitz, by WG Sebald -- tells the story of a Jewish German boy rescued to exile in England.Most viewers, I'm sure, will accept this film on its own a-polotical, a-historical terms. It's a potently sentimental story, a heart-render with an unexpectedly 'gentle' ending. The acting is incredible. Why is it that unknown, never-seen-before-or-again actors are so much more skillful in their portrayals on the screen than all the touted, overpaid, Oscar-acclaimed stars? Eh? Oh well ...

Gregg,"[5, 5]","Subtitled, but there is not so much talk that you miss the movie and acting for trying to read all the text.At the beginning of WWII, Sweden wanted to help its war-torn neighbor Finland by offering the more than 70,000  Finnish ""war children""  temporary homes with Swedish families.  (Can you imagine how incredibly hard that must've been for the parents to do - or how scary and hard it must've been for the children?)The kids were put on boats, and then a train - LOTS of children, very few adults to look after them.  Young kids trying to take care of and calm their baby siblings, stoically trying to protect them only to have them taken away as siblings were generally separated. So the poor kids had to deal with so much fear and grief and on top of that the guilt of not being able to protect their younger sibling. They didn't even speak the same language.  First they picked the youngest and then the prettiest girls, so they had to also suffer the torture of being picked over in that way.  And after a time the children started to get settled in their new life - and then they were uprooted again to be returned home.War is HARD on EVERYONE and its effects are long lasting. And we should all remind ourselves of this during peace times, so we can appreciate the peace and work hard to avoid war. And younger generations need to understand it too, not only to appreciate what they have but to also understand that hard times are survivable and it is our loved ones that are valuable - not our possessions.This is the fictional story of one child.  It is heart-wrenching at times, and it will make you want to just slap some of these people at times.  But humans aren't perfect.  It is a GOOD story, a good movie and at the end of the movie, I think you will be glad you watched it - and I hope you share this with others.",4,"Heart-wrenching, but worth watching - and sharing.",1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,1832,"['Subtitled', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'talk', 'miss', 'movie', 'acting', 'trying', 'read', 'text.At', 'beginning', 'WWII', 'Sweden', 'wanted', 'help', 'war-torn', 'neighbor', 'Finland', 'offering', 'more', '70,000', 'Finnish', 'war', 'children', 'temporary', 'homes', 'Swedish', 'families', 'Can', 'imagine', 'how', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'parents', 'do', 'how', 'scary', 'hard', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'children', 'kids', 'were', 'put', 'boats', 'then', 'train', 'LOTS', 'children', 'very', 'few', 'adults', 'look', 'Young', 'kids', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'calm', 'baby', 'siblings', 'stoically', 'trying', 'protect', 'only', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'siblings', 'were', 'generally', 'separated', 'poor', 'kids', 'had', 'deal', 'so', 'much', 'fear', 'grief', 'top', 'guilt', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'protect', 'younger', 'sibling', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'First', 'picked', 'youngest', 'then', 'prettiest', 'girls', 'had', 'also', 'suffer', 'torture', 'being', 'picked', 'way', 'time', 'children', 'started', 'get', 'settled', 'new', 'life', 'then', 'were', 'uprooted', 'again', 'be', 'returned', 'HARD', 'EVERYONE', 'effects', 'are', 'long', 'lasting', 'should', 'remind', 'ourselves', 'peace', 'times', 'can', 'appreciate', 'peace', 'work', 'hard', 'avoid', 'war', 'younger', 'generations', 'need', 'understand', 'too', 'not', 'only', 'appreciate', 'what', 'have', 'also', 'understand', 'hard', 'times', 'are', 'survivable', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'valuable', 'not', 'possessions.This', 'fictional', 'story', 'one', 'child', 'heart-wrenching', 'times', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'just', 'slap', 'people', 'times', 'humans', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'GOOD', 'story', 'good', 'movie', 'end', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'watched', 'hope', 'share', 'others']",N/A

Meanwhile I am still catching up on Film Movement releases from years past.""Mother of Mine"" (2005 Finnish-Swedish release; 110 min.) brings the story of Eero, a Finnish boy of about 8-9 yrs., and how his family is struggling in WWII. Eero's dad is killed while fighting the Russians and at that point Eero's mom breaks down and is unable to care further for the boy. Eero gets shipped of to a family in a remote part of Sweden. Eero is having a hard time adjusting to the family and his new environment, and the Swedish mom does not make things easier for him as she appears cold and uncaring, making us wonder why she is so hostile. Fortunately the Swedish dad is gentler and Eero gets along great with him, although Eero still longs for home in Finland. Why is the Swedish mom so cold to Eero? Will Eero eventually settle in with his Swedish foster family? Will Eero ever see his mom again in Finland? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is a moving family drama without being too sentimental. The acting performances are ace throughout, although none more so than from the little boy who plays Eero. Keep you eye out also for the Swedish dad, played by Michael Nyqvist, yes he of the Mikael Blomkvist character in the Dragon Tattoo/Millenium trilogy! Last but not least, at the beginning of the movie we are told that in real life about 70,000 Finnish kids were sent to Sweden during WWII to shield them from the war. Bottom line: I very much enjoyed this movie, and it is yet another worthy addition to the rich Film Movement catalog.

I just want to add my five star rating to the others to encourage viewers to watch this.I will say that the story is fascinating.  We get a bit of what happened to Finland during WWII.  (In my ignorance I didn't know that Finland had sided with Germany.)  It's not a political story, though, it's a human one, set against the trials of their circumstances.  The film is so well done, the script, the cinematography, the actors, that anyone can relate to the lives of these people.  They had hard choices to make and they had to live with them. Despite the hardships the film is not at all depressing.  There is a lot of love and beauty in it.  We see the sea, the Skane geese, the beautiful but simple homes, as well as the beauty of the people involved.I won't spoil the experience of possible new viewers by revealing too much of the plot.
