My interest is more from the standpoint of a model railroader and can appreciate the work and intricate detail that went into the production of the early episodes.

Lodge,"[6, 6]","To quote another reviewer, ""Toddlers and preschoolers will want these dvds over and over and over again!"" - forgot to add in ""and their train-loving parent"" too! I really enjoy the shows for the excellent model railroading skills the producers used in making the show. Supremely realistic model work, scenery, and operation. In these shows, when the train are running along the tracks, they are actually PULLING A TRAIN, unlike some of the new computer generated shows where the trains just run around all day, apparently not doing the work that locomotives do, which is PULL TRAINS! I'm still waiting for the complete 2nd season - I bought this set years and years ago, and so far no season 2 yet.",5,Eagerly awaiting season 2,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,698,"['quote', 'reviewer', 'Toddlers', 'preschoolers', 'will', 'want', 'dvds', 'over', 'again', 'forgot', 'add', 'train-loving', 'parent', 'too', 'really', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'excellent', 'model', 'railroading', 'skills', 'producers', 'used', 'making', 'show', 'Supremely', 'realistic', 'model', 'work', 'scenery', 'operation', 'shows', 'when', 'train', 'are', 'running', 'tracks', 'are', 'actually', 'PULLING', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'new', 'computer', 'generated', 'shows', 'where', 'trains', 'just', 'run', 'around', 'day', 'apparently', 'not', 'doing', 'work', 'do', 'PULL', 'TRAINS', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'complete', '2nd', 'season', 'bought', 'set', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'far', 'season', '2', 'yet']",Thomas & Friends: The Early Years: Season 1

In fact, one of my sons wanted to change his name to Gordon as that was his favorite train.  As these stories were written by a Reverend, they have a subtle message which supports good character and virtue.  The vocabulary is a little richer than the average childhood story.  My sons could sit for hours and watch these.  Ringo Starr was a fun plus to these episodes.
