Knox must prove his worth and rise above suspicion before he is completely accepted by his rescuers. Peace is short lived, however, when an attack by a rival group of ex-military raiders leaves their camp devastated. It's up to Knox and those who survived the attack to gather their resources and launch a rescue mission on the raiders' fortress. All the while facing a land overrun by zombies.As far as the movie, itself, is concerned; it's not that bad. However, Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption tries too hard to be too many things. I think, that is the one thing that brings the movie down. I believe if things were more focused that the movie might have been alot more worthwhile.  Really the only redeeming quality to me, with this movie, is Fred Williamson.As it stands, though, Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is your basic low-budget zombie movie with a high body count but with little else going for it.

1442613,A1ADEVDXQLIUXB,B0055CP9S6,"Patrick S. Dorazio ""Author of The Dark Trilogy""","[5, 5]","Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is a bare bones, low budget movie made by folks who appear to be having fun with what was clearly a labor of love.  The basic synopsis of the plot is that John Knox, the main character, is condemned to death by the group of Apocalyptic Raiders he fell in with after the dead have risen and the world is overrun by zombies.  The reason for his sentence is that he no longer wants to follow the leader Rome, who like Knox is ex-military, but is a psychopath that slaughters for fun and for no other discernible reason.  Knox is allowed to escape by one of the other members of the group who apparently also doesn't like Rome much either (and gets executed for his troubles).  The escape isn't without hardships, since Knox is left handcuffed and is sent out into the desert.  He manages to avoid getting devoured by a zombie and gets rescued by a band that roams the wastelands doing their best to fend for themselves.  They are led by a man named Moses (Fred Williamson) who is likely the only member of the cast that the vast majority of the audience might know.  Knox does his best to help his new found friends, even though trust is hard to come by given the fact that they know of his raider past.  At the same time, his old nemesis, Rome, wants Knox found and executed, and so the hunt is on.  Of course, the two groups end up clashing and in the end this tale becomes a battle between good and evil, with a horde of the undead smack dab in the middle of it all.I was provided this movie for review because I am essentially a zombie-fiend.  I review mainly zombie and other horror-type novels, but now and then I will review a movie.  Yes, this is a very low budget movie and is very much a b-grade flick.  Some of the dialog was a bit rough and every now and then unintentionally amusing.  Jerry Lynch, who plays the head bad guy, appears to be fond enough of chewing scenery that he probably got indigestion after he was done here.  Nope, this one won't win any major awards, but for me, it was a fun post apocalyptic zombie flick.  You sort of have to just go with it-accept the limitations of having minimal budget, no real known actors, and a simple apocalyptic premise.  If you can do that, this movie is fun to watch.  The concept is workable, with a bit of a Road Warrior type feel to the bad guys with their mishmash of armor and a deluded leader who craves power.  Fred Williamson might be a bit too old to be doing fight scenes (he is over 70, after all), but even watching him do that after having seen him in plenty of classic B-Grade action flicks of the past brought a smile to my face.  This is a simple, rock 'em, sock 'em zombie flick with a high body count and no hidden meanings.  Pick your side, grab a weapon, and kill both the undead as well as the living that would kill you first if they had the chance.  Go in knowing what to expect here and you will probably have some fun with this one.",4,Go in knowing what to expect and you'll have fun,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,2948,"['Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'Redemption', 'bare', 'bones', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'made', 'folks', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'what', 'was', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'basic', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'John', 'Knox', 'main', 'character', 'condemned', 'death', 'group', 'Apocalyptic', 'Raiders', 'fell', 'dead', 'have', 'risen', 'world', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'reason', 'sentence', 'no', 'longer', 'follow', 'leader', 'Rome', 'who', 'Knox', 'ex-military', 'psychopath', 'slaughters', 'fun', 'other', 'discernible', 'reason', 'Knox', 'allowed', 'escape', 'one', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'who', 'apparently', 'also', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rome', 'much', 'executed', 'troubles', 'escape', ""n't"", 'hardships', 'Knox', 'left', 'handcuffed', 'sent', 'out', 'desert', 'avoid', 'getting', 'devoured', 'zombie', 'rescued', 'band', 'wastelands', 'doing', 'best', 'fend', 'are', 'led', 'man', 'named', 'Moses', 'Fred', 'Williamson', 'who', 'likely', 'only', 'member', 'cast', 'vast', 'majority', 'audience', 'might', 'know', 'Knox', 'best', 'help', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'even', 'trust', 'hard', 'come', 'given', 'fact', 'know', 'raider', 'past', 'same', 'time', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Rome', 'Knox', 'found', 'executed', 'so', 'hunt', 'course', 'two', 'groups', 'end', 'up', 'clashing', 'end', 'tale', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'horde', 'undead', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'was', 'provided', 'movie', 'review', 'am', 'essentially', 'zombie-fiend', 'review', 'mainly', 'zombie', 'other', 'horror-type', 'novels', 'now', 'then', 'will', 'review', 'movie', 'Yes', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'b-grade', 'flick', 'dialog', 'was', 'bit', 'rough', 'now', 'then', 'unintentionally', 'amusing', 'Jerry', 'Lynch', 'who', 'head', 'bad', 'guy', 'be', 'fond', 'enough', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'probably', 'got', 'indigestion', 'was', 'done', 'here', 'Nope', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'major', 'awards', 'was', 'fun', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'zombie', 'flick', 'sort', 'have', 'just', 'go', 'it-accept', 'limitations', 'having', 'minimal', 'budget', 'real', 'known', 'actors', 'simple', 'apocalyptic', 'premise', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'concept', 'workable', 'bit', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'type', 'feel', 'bad', 'guys', 'mishmash', 'armor', 'deluded', 'leader', 'who', 'power', 'Fred', 'Williamson', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'doing', 'fight', 'scenes', '70', 'even', 'watching', 'do', 'having', 'seen', 'plenty', 'classic', 'B-Grade', 'action', 'flicks', 'past', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'simple', 'rock', 'sock', 'flick', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'Pick', 'side', 'grab', 'weapon', 'kill', 'undead', 'as', 'well', 'living', 'would', 'kill', 'first', 'had', 'chance', 'Go', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'here', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'fun', 'one']",Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption
1442614,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0055CP9S6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption (Ryan Thompson, 2011)I loathed Zombie Apocalypse; in my review of that one, I said (and Amazon saw fit to quote), ""There is not a single thing about this movie that might make you want to watch it."" And yet I just found myself watching the sequel, Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption, the lowest-rated movie on my Netflix queue. I was entirely unsurprised at how awful this movie was; it is, in fact, even worse than Zombie Apocalypse. What did surprise me, however, is the ways in which it was awful. Redemption has sweet FA to do with the original movie. Now, had Ryan Thompson learned a few things about how to make movies between filming the first one and filming the second, that might have been a good thing. Unfortunately, he didn't.Plot: Redemption takes place in the same universe as the original film, at some point in the future, after someone (it is never explained who) has decided to bomb the planet in order to get rid of the zombie problem. As a side effect, this has turned most of the planet's surface into a desert wasteland where bands of survivors prey on one another for food, water, and other supplies while avoiding the zombies that remain. Knox (Whip It's Johnny Gel), a former military man and former raider, finds himself taken in by a band of survivors led by the enigmatic Moses (M*A*S*H's Fred Williamson, who looks damn good for being over seventy). Unfortunately, the leader of his former crew, Rome (The Spirit of Mumbai's Jerry Lynch), will stop at nothing to retrieve his former employee...and anyone who gets in the way can be considered collateral damage, living or undead.There's really nothing to say about this movie other than ""it's godawful."" As with the first film, every last aspect of it--the acting, the direction, the lighting in the interior scenes, the soundtrack, anything else you would consider while thinking about making a movie--ranges from substandard to downright inept.

I popped this DVD into my player with a bit of concern. After all, I am a bit of a movie snob, and especially when it comes to the zombie genre. That said, I had a great time watching this movie. Some of the fun was seeing Richard act like a goon for the bad guys...but some of it was just being able to have fun and NOT take this film seriously. Now, that might sound bad to some, but the reality is that this is an indie film. Not that there aren't amazing bits of cinema out there from the indies, but for those who watch the SyFy movies...those are gems of fun if you take them as such and don't try to get too serious.Some observation, the women were so over the top, the outfits were...well let's just say they were NOT dressed for an apocalypse. The central ""hero"" was a poor man's C. Thomas Howell. And Fred Williamson, bless his heart, when he jumped across the hood of the truck ""Dukes of Hazzard"" style...well it brought me to tears.

Governments of the world attempted to use nuclear weapons to fight the millions of undead, which had no effect, and screwed over the remaining survivors even more. Not surprisingly, the survivors form different groups and fight over what little resources are left.The main character, Johnny Knox, falls in with a group led by a drug-addicted psycho named Rome. Knox has trouble following Rome's orders, and is sentenced to death. His brother takes him out to the desert, rather than watch Knox be burned at the stake. Knox is nearly killed by some zombies, when he is rescued by another group of survivors. They are led by a guy named Moses, played by none other than Hollywood B-movie legend Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson. When Rome finds out that Moses and his fellow survivors are harboring Knox, he orders his raiders to completely wipe out the camp, including the women and children.There is no lack of action in this movie, and the special effects are better than what you often find in a SyFy weekend movie. The dialogue was pretty entertaining as well, with some great lines, and a talented cast that did not disappoint.
