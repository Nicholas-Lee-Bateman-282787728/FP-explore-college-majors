My husband has been riding for over 50 years, and for him it's not a choice to not ride. He tells me it keeps him sane, grounded, and he looks forward to riding every chance he gets.

It starts off as a very exciting documentary for motorcycle development & motorcycle racing history in the US.  But, it ultimately fails, because it very quickly turns into a far-fetched infomercial about how motorcycle riding cures cancer, motorcycle riding makes your kids eat their vegetables, and by golly motorcycles actually make criminals into model law-abiding citizens, dog darn it!  (Yah, right.)  Look.  All riders -love- motorcycles for different reasons.  But, please don't insult our intelligence with all the mushy stuff.  There are good ppl who ride bikes, and there are also hoodlums and criminals.
