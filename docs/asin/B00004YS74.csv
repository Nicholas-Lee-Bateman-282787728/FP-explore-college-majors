The story is sweet but not over the top. The child performers are excellent! The Christmas scene on the train that becomes Foy's epiphany is touching.

560059,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00004YS74,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS (1955) is narrated by Foy boy #2, Charley, who sounds just like kid brother Eddie Jr. Accepting that this musical biopic is mostly fiction, its 93 minute running time would have greatly benefited by the addition of a single reel. Foy Sr.'s early song and dance routines are most interesting (as are his later on-stage struggles with the children). Once Eddie (still a 'single') graduates from vaudeville to Broadway, career success and the passage of time are noted by the use of a series of lighted ad signs that proclaim his hit shows. An opportunity to present a song highlight from each is squandered here. To have done so would've added greatly to this film's depth and in hindsight, its value as a source of theatrical history.Jimmy Cagney appears briefly as George Cohan. In a testimonial dinner highlight, he mounts a long, shiny black table top and performs his famous ""Yankee Doodle Boy"" steps fromYANKEE DOODLE DANDY(1942). Although 13 years older and clearly heavier, Cagney has lost only a little of that loose-jointed flexibility. Hope (as Eddie Foy) follows him and delivers a vigorously impressive tap routine. They conclude with a precision softshoe duet.In typical Hollywood fashion, all this frivolity unfolds while Foy, who's just returned to NY, is unaware that Madeleine (Milly Vitale), beloved wife and mother of his seven children, has died from a lengthy illness that she kept hidden from him.Angela Clarke is Aunt Clara, the deceased's meddling older sister who, incensed that they must play the Palace during Christmas week, tries to wrest the kids away from Eddie by getting the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children involved (this organization's actual name was the Gerry Society). Foy has his brood do their pathetic stage specialties for the presiding judge and he rules that they aren't performers. Although defeated, Aunt Clara decides not to return to Italy and on one auspicious Sunday, Eddie actually makes it to church with the family! Bells all across New Rochelle announce the miraculous news. Finis.(Watch for a priestly cameo by Joe Flynn, best known as Capt. Binghamton on TV'sMCHALE'S NAVY.)",4,Twice the size of the Four Cohans but not half as talented,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,2168,"['SEVEN', 'LITTLE', 'FOYS', '1955', 'narrated', 'Foy', 'boy', '2', 'Charley', 'who', 'just', 'kid', 'brother', 'Eddie', 'Jr', 'Accepting', 'musical', 'biopic', 'mostly', 'fiction', '93', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'benefited', 'addition', 'single', 'reel', 'Foy', 'Sr.', 'early', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'are', 'later', 'on-stage', 'struggles', 'children', 'Once', 'Eddie', 'still', ""'single"", 'graduates', 'vaudeville', 'Broadway', 'career', 'success', 'passage', 'time', 'are', 'noted', 'use', 'series', 'lighted', 'ad', 'signs', 'proclaim', 'hit', 'shows', 'opportunity', 'present', 'song', 'highlight', 'squandered', 'here', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'would', ""'ve"", 'added', 'greatly', 'film', 'depth', 'hindsight', 'value', 'source', 'theatrical', 'history.Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'briefly', 'George', 'Cohan', 'testimonial', 'dinner', 'highlight', 'long', 'shiny', 'black', 'table', 'top', 'performs', 'famous', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Boy', 'steps', 'fromYANKEE', 'DOODLE', 'DANDY', '1942', '13', 'years', 'older', 'clearly', 'heavier', 'Cagney', 'lost', 'only', 'little', 'loose-jointed', 'flexibility', 'Hope', 'Eddie', 'Foy', 'vigorously', 'impressive', 'tap', 'routine', 'conclude', 'precision', 'softshoe', 'duet.In', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'frivolity', 'Foy', 'who', 'just', 'returned', 'NY', 'unaware', 'Madeleine', 'Milly', 'Vitale', 'beloved', 'wife', 'mother', 'seven', 'children', 'died', 'lengthy', 'illness', 'kept', 'hidden', 'him.Angela', 'Clarke', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'deceased', 'meddling', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'incensed', 'must', 'play', 'Palace', 'Christmas', 'week', 'tries', 'wrest', 'kids', 'away', 'Eddie', 'getting', 'Society', 'Prevention', 'Cruelty', 'Children', 'involved', 'organization', 'actual', 'name', 'was', 'Gerry', 'Society', 'Foy', 'brood', 'do', 'pathetic', 'stage', 'specialties', 'presiding', 'judge', 'rules', 'are', ""n't"", 'performers', 'defeated', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'not', 'return', 'Italy', 'one', 'auspicious', 'Sunday', 'Eddie', 'actually', 'church', 'family', 'Bells', 'New', 'Rochelle', 'miraculous', 'news', 'Finis', 'Watch', 'priestly', 'cameo', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'best', 'known', 'Capt', 'Binghamton', ""TV'sMCHALE"", 'NAVY']",The Seven Little Foys

560061,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B00004YS74,CodeMaster Talon,"[37, 37]","A rarely seen Bob Hope gem, ""The Seven Little Foys"" is well worth seeking out. The film is based on the true story of Eddie Foy, a vaudvillian who, after the unexpected death of his wife, decides to make his seven children into a stage act in order to keep on eye on them while on the road. That his children are one and all completely deviod of any talent whatsoever doesn't faze him much. After all,  famous for being dreadfully untalented is still famous.The first half of the movie drags a bit while detailing the courtship of Eddie Foy and his long-suffering wife, but the second half has Bob playing off of seven terrific child actors and the results are very entertaining. (For example, racking his brain on how to get his kids on stage, Bob asks them what they can do. His littlest replies cheerfully, ""I can dance!"" and proceeds to careen around the room in a drunken manner. ""Keep your opinions to yourself"", Bob observes.)To Eddie's surprise, the kids are so bad they're a huge hit, and though dysfunctional, the Foys are ultimately a loving and tightknit bunch. Bob and the kids have a great chemistry, and he also has a great foil in the Italian actress that plays the children's aunt. (At one point she grouses that the house Eddie has bought is ""falling apart"", ""Nobody complains about you"", Bob shoots back. )And of course, there is the famous scene when Bob and Jimmy Cagney do a wondeful softshoe atop a banquet table; this scene alone is worth the price of the DVD.If you're a fan of Bob Hope or like turn of the century period films , be sure not to miss ""The Seven Little Foys"".",5,That's Entertainment!,1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,1599,"['rarely', 'seen', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'gem', 'Seven', 'Little', 'Foys', 'well', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Eddie', 'Foy', 'vaudvillian', 'who', 'unexpected', 'death', 'wife', 'make', 'seven', 'children', 'stage', 'act', 'order', 'keep', 'eye', 'road', 'children', 'are', 'one', 'completely', 'deviod', 'talent', 'whatsoever', ""n't"", 'faze', 'much', 'famous', 'being', 'dreadfully', 'untalented', 'still', 'famous.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'bit', 'detailing', 'courtship', 'Eddie', 'Foy', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'second', 'half', 'Bob', 'playing', 'seven', 'terrific', 'child', 'actors', 'results', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'example', 'racking', 'brain', 'how', 'get', 'kids', 'stage', 'Bob', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'littlest', 'replies', 'cheerfully', 'can', 'dance', 'proceeds', 'careen', 'room', 'drunken', 'manner', 'Keep', 'opinions', 'Bob', 'Eddie', 'surprise', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'huge', 'hit', 'dysfunctional', 'Foys', 'are', 'ultimately', 'loving', 'tightknit', 'bunch', 'Bob', 'kids', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'also', 'great', 'foil', 'Italian', 'actress', 'children', 'aunt', 'one', 'point', 'house', 'Eddie', 'bought', 'falling', 'apart', 'Nobody', 'Bob', 'back', 'course', 'famous', 'scene', 'when', 'Bob', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'do', 'wondeful', 'softshoe', 'banquet', 'table', 'scene', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'turn', 'century', 'period', 'films', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'miss', 'Seven', 'Little', 'Foys']",The Seven Little Foys

The movie itself is rather predictable but Bob Hope helps move it along as he delivers wisecracks as only he can.I was surprized that the movie began in 1898 because I knew that Eddie Foy had what must have been an interesting career before that.  In a biography I had read of Wyatt Earp, I was surprized to discover that Eddie Foy was an entertainer in the Dodge City of Earp's era.  Couldn't there have been 5-10 minutes on what that part of Foy's life must have been like?I would have rated this movie ""3 Stars"" but for the scene that I had been waiting for.  James Cagney won the Best Actor Oscar for his role as George M. Cohan in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""; one of my favorite movies.  I would have thought that the Cagney of ganster movie fame would have been miscast in ""YDD"" but he was quite a hoofer then as well as his encore preformance in ""The Seven Little Foys"".  What I really appreciated, along with the top-notch bantering between Hope and Cagney, was that the duo was given three songs to strut their stuff.  Both Hope and Cagney are very adept at tap dancing as well as ""the old soft shoe"".  Cagney's stiff-legged style is worth the price of admission to (or purchase of) any movie he dances in and I got more than my money's worth in this one.
