I watched the first few episodes of' 24' but soon tired of it, never bothered with 'Lost'. And because I haven't got satellite, I have missed 'Heroes' and other so-called 'must-see' TV. Third Watch was different. Firstly I never made an effort to watch it. I came across it by accident, flicking the channels one work day afternoon. I enjoyed what I had seen, and checked the schedules to see when it was next on. For the next few months, even through Channel 4, here in the UK, chopped & changed the times, I stayed with it, only missing a couple of episodes. When my sister, who lives in New York, mentioned that it had been cancelled, I was determined to get the DVD collection, which i did via amazon.co.uk.

I've been a faithful fan since the very first episode in 1999 and it just keeps getting better.  The different personalities of the characters in this changing ensemble cast seems to work rather well.  You've got Sully, the veteran patrol cop, who is teamed up with young pup Davis (the son of his slain partner)  Then, you have Yokas (who's trying her best to do triple duty as officer/wife and mother)paired up with Bosco (who never seems to know when to quit, much less when to keep his mouth shut or his ego in check.)  Add to it your paramedics and firefighters:  Doc (who seemed to make his work his life and ended up burned out,) Carlos (who seems to never change his self-centered personality,) Kim (who's on again/off again relationship with ex-hubby Jimmy Doherty gives plenty to talk about.)  They're all out there, working the 3-12 shift and trying to do the right thing, on duty and off.

Who the H**L does the ratings on these shows?  They sure aren't checking with the viewing public!  THIRD WATCH was one of the best shows on the network.  I've never seen a bad review on it.  The show was real; the characters played their roles so true to the heart.  Being in EMS myself, this was the closest to true life I've ever seen on TV.  The show portrayed things that go on in the field very realistically.  It isn't always a happy ending in real life either.  The things these characters were going through were genuinely portrayed.  Good cops and not so good cops... mistakes in the field happen.  Paramedics, police, hospital workers and firefighters dealing with personal problems while on duty, being torn in different directions is truly a constant battle.  What is the point in getting a good show on the air and then slap the actors and your viewing public in the face by cancelling it?  Someone's seriously lying if they said they did a survey and found no one was watching it.  The Nielson Ratings system is total fraud and a joke.  And why is it that you can't even get the third season that was filmed to show on the air?  Does someone in upper management of the network have something against this show?  You can't even get it in DVD.  God knows, they've already got the first 3 seasons of 24 out and they're in their 4th season.  You can get anything else in the world on DVD but not THIRD WATCH.

It's a positive view of life.It reveres love, life and decency while portraying the world as it is, gritty realism and all. And it does it without four letter words. It's this positive view of life that offends the literati, who seem to be stalled in their maturation at the middle school level.It may be years until the dinosaurs at the studios release this series.

Future episodes get even better..hope they continue until their all released. My favorite is Molly Price as Faith Yokas. She's tuff but I just love her. Bosco and Doc are my next favorites.
