1242948,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001V7UX4O,Acute Observer,"[5, 5]","Perry Mason Season 4 Volume 1These sixteen TV films from 1960 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with firearms. Smoking was very common [a tobacco sponsor]. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings (no need for a jury). A story adapted from a novel has the year.Treacherous Toup&eacute;e 09/17/60; Credulous Quarry 09/24/60;Ill-fated Faker 10/01/60; Singular Double10/08/60.Lavender Lipstick 10/05/60; Wandering Widow 10/22/60;Clumsy Clown 11/05/60;  Provocative Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 11/12/60.Nine Dolls 11/19/60;  Loquacious Liar 12/03/60;Red Riding Boots 12/10/60; Larcenous Lady12/17/60.Envious Editor 01/17/61; Resolute Reformer 01/14/61;Fickle Fortune 01/21/61; Waylaid Wolf (1960) 04/04/61.",5,The Original Courtroom Drama,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,2397,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'Season', '4', 'Volume', '1These', 'sixteen', 'TV', 'films', '1960', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'original', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'informative', 'tell', 'stories', 'life', 'unknown', 'most', 'people', 'books', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'films', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'books', 'tell', 'ropers', 'rough', 'smooth', 'shadows', 'how', 'evade', 'surveillance', 'avoid', 'leaving', 'back', 'trail', 'may', 'question', 'legality', 'ethics', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'tactics', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'modern', 'legal', 'rules', '1960s', 'backgrounds', 'tell', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'difficult', 'film', 'scene', 'night', 'easy', 'describe', 'book', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'was', 'founder', 'Court', 'Last', 'Resort', 'sought', 'free', 'many', 'unjustly', 'convicted', 'persons', 'Gardner', 'others', 'sought', 'use', 'scientific', 'means', 'find', 'guilty', 'rather', 'using', 'hunches', 'guesses', 'alone.Often', 'original', 'stories', 'were', 'modified', 'TV', 'theme', 'music', 'typical', 'late', '1950s', 'Note', 'style', 'clothing', 'culture', 'ladies', 'wore', 'white', 'gloves', 'People', 'seldom', 'lock', 'doors', 'prices', 'date', 'films', 'One', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'many', 'automobiles', 'era', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'Note', 'slimness', 'people', 'smoking', 'familiarity', 'firearms', 'Smoking', 'was', 'very', 'common', 'tobacco', 'sponsor', ']', 'seeming', 'reality', 'stories', 'due', 'part', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'Watch', 'how', 'actors', 'express', 'emotions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'camera', 'sharpness', 'quality', 'excellent', 'films', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'today', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'hero', 'stories', 'often', 'use', 'misinterpretation', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'usually', 'Preliminary', 'Hearings', 'need', 'jury', 'story', 'adapted', 'novel', 'year.Treacherous', 'Toup', 'eacute', '09/17/60', 'Credulous', 'Quarry', '09/24/60', 'Ill-fated', 'Faker', '10/01/60', 'Singular', 'Double10/08/60.Lavender', 'Lipstick', '10/05/60', 'Wandering', 'Widow', '10/22/60', 'Clumsy', 'Clown', '11/05/60', 'Provocative', 'Prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', '11/12/60.Nine', 'Dolls', '11/19/60', 'Loquacious', 'Liar', '12/03/60', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Boots', '12/10/60', 'Larcenous', 'Lady12/17/60.Envious', 'Editor', '01/17/61', 'Resolute', 'Reformer', '01/14/61', 'Fickle', 'Fortune', '01/21/61', 'Waylaid', 'Wolf', '1960', '04/04/61']","Perry Mason: Season 4, Vol. 1"

1242951,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B001V7UX4O,Bobby Underwood,"[72, 78]","Perry Mason is as much a part of American culture as apple pie and mom. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone of any age who doesn't at least recognize the name. Erle Stanley Gardner's books have millions of devoted fans. The television show it spawned was fabulous as entertainment, and today is widely regarded as one of the best shows the medium ever produced. Perry was the attorney you wanted on your side in a jam.Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered as Perry Mason. It was Gardner himself who picked Burr, even though the studio only agreed to let him test for Perry if he would test for Burger too! Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger would almost be ready to gloat, Lt. Tragg (Ray Collins) not far behind, when Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer on the witness stand. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.Season four was terrific. Releasing them in half seasons, the first half on volume one, the second on volume two, is indeed an effective but annoying marketing scheme. I agree the price should be lowered, but at the same time agree that entertainment wise, this is an incredible value. So, much like gasoline, you pay what you have to. Hopefully at some point, Amazon or Paramount will make an effort to still make a profit with a sure-fire hit, while giving fans a better purchase price.Season four episodes, beginning in September of 1960 and ending in June of 1961, are as follows: The Case of the Treacherous Toupee--The Case of the Credulous Quarry--The Case of the Ill-Fated Faker--The Case of the Singular Double--The Case of the Lavender Lipstick--The Case of the Wandering Widow--The Case of the Clumsy Clown-- The Case of the Provocative Protege--The Case of the Nine Dolls--The Case of the Loquacious Liar--The Case of the Red Riding Boots--The Case of the Larcenous Lady--The Case of the Envious Editor--The Case of the Resolute Reformer--The Case of the Fickle Fortune--The Case of the Waylaid Wolf--The Case of the Wintry Wife --The Case of the Angry Dead Man--The Case of the Blind Man's Bluff--The Case of the Barefaced Witness--The Case of the Difficult Detour--The Case of the Cowardly Lion--The Case of the Torrid Tapestry--The Case of the Violent Vest--The Case of the Misguided Missile--The Case of the Duplicate Daughter--The Case of the Grumbling Grandfather--The Case of the Guilty ClientsThis was one of the best dramas ever to hit the air. Seeing it today reminds us just how good television can be, but is often not. It's a bit of nostalgia and a lot of entertainment for TV fans. Fred Steiner's ""Park Avenue Beat"" remains one of the most recognizable themes ever heard.

Ware Cornell Jr. ""anotherlawyer""","[6, 6]","During the last few months of the third season and for the first half of the fourth season Bill Talman, the quintessential Hamilton Burger was off the show for violating the morals clause of his contract for having been arrested during a raid at a ""wild nude party.""So when the fourth season opens with an episode with Talman in the DA's chair I had to wonder. The answer was clear as soon as my wife started screaming, ""That's Robert Redford"". Sure enough it was Redford six  years younger than he was inBarefoot in the Parkin one of his first roles. And Redford was good  even if I won't say if he did it or not.But the inclusion of the Redford episode tells the viewer that this compilation is not exactly a chronological recreation of the fourth season. The tryouts for the new DA have a few assistant district attorneys with some fire and personality but for the most part they were reading lines writen for Talman. His absence clearly detracts from the series.The many superb character actors that appeared on the series is one of primary strengths of the show. These actors never walked the red carpet at the Oscars but they worked year in and year out in Westerns, B-movies and sitcoms. A face like Dabbs Greer's could never bring a leading role, but he appeared on screen and on television in 288 roles (some of them continuing characters) during his career. Greer is one of many just like him that inhabited the Perry Mason set.In short, this volume has its limitations but it remains one that any Perry Mason fan will want to own.",5,"Much Mason, Rare Redford but not enough Ham Burger",1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,1541,"['last', 'few', 'months', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'fourth', 'season', 'Bill', 'Talman', 'quintessential', 'Hamilton', 'Burger', 'was', 'show', 'violating', 'morals', 'clause', 'contract', 'having', 'been', 'arrested', 'raid', 'wild', 'nude', 'party', 'So', 'when', 'fourth', 'season', 'episode', 'Talman', 'DA', 'chair', 'had', 'wonder', 'answer', 'was', 'clear', 'as', 'soon', 'wife', 'started', 'screaming', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Sure', 'was', 'Redford', 'six', 'years', 'younger', 'was', 'inBarefoot', 'Parkin', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'Redford', 'was', 'good', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', 'not.But', 'inclusion', 'Redford', 'episode', 'viewer', 'compilation', 'not', 'exactly', 'chronological', 'recreation', 'fourth', 'season', 'tryouts', 'new', 'DA', 'have', 'few', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorneys', 'fire', 'personality', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'reading', 'lines', 'writen', 'Talman', 'absence', 'clearly', 'series.The', 'many', 'superb', 'character', 'actors', 'appeared', 'series', 'one', 'primary', 'strengths', 'show', 'actors', 'never', 'walked', 'red', 'carpet', 'Oscars', 'worked', 'year', 'year', 'out', 'Westerns', 'B-movies', 'sitcoms', 'face', 'Dabbs', 'Greer', 'could', 'never', 'bring', 'leading', 'role', 'appeared', 'screen', 'television', '288', 'roles', 'continuing', 'characters', 'career', 'Greer', 'one', 'many', 'just', 'inhabited', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'short', 'volume', 'limitations', 'one', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'own']","Perry Mason: Season 4, Vol. 1"
