577151,A17JB4W8FLI546,B00005AFT5,A. Commentator,"[17, 18]","Yes, 'Attila' is not totally accurate in its historical details, and yes, it was intended to ride on the fame of 'Gladiator.'  However, I have found that 'Attila' does have a few things to recommend it to the discriminating viewer.  If you can see past the mighty armies of a few hundred men, the plastic armor and the soundtrack that borrows motifs from the score to 'Gladiator,' 'Attila' does make a statement.I remember my college World History 101 professor lecturing about the mysterious &quot;hordes from the steppes of Eurasia&quot; that cropped up from time to time during the Bronze and Iron Ages.This is what 'Attila' is all about.  After a millenium of glory, Rome is corrupt, decadent and weak.  A new band of people, the Huns, have come down from the steppes and are full of energy, but are disorganized and lack direction.  There is only one man who can rebuild Rome- Aetius; and one man who can unite the Huns- Attila; which will prevail and lead the world into a new era?What really makes 'Attila' stand out from other epic historical dramas is its treatment of its protagonists.  Most epic characters from films, like 'Spartacus' or William Wallace from 'Braveheart', are brimming with honor and nobility-- these are people you wish you could have for next-door neighbors. In 'Attila,' however...Aetius, the potential savior of Rome, has all the cunning and stoic determination of previous Roman leaders-- but is not portrayed as a young go-getter like the Julius Caesar of 'Spartacus' or a man in the prime of life like Maximus in 'Gladiator'-- instead he is a middle-aged man who, when the film begins, has already bungled his best chance to seize the throne of the Caesars and is rotting in prison.  Attila, on the other hand, is a handsome and charismatic young man who was traumatized by witnessing the murder of his family as a child and, perhaps as a result, is not quite right in the head.  Attila's idea of a good time is to ride into a defenseless village and massacre the peasants he finds there.One of the film's major achievements is that it manages to make the audience sympathize with these rather unsavory characters.  Also, the emperors of the two halves of the empire are given a different treatment than is usual for toga flicks: rather than being a maniac, the Roman emperor Valentinian is simply a moron- while the Byzantine emperor Theodosius is a corpulent and bitter degenerate for whom assassination is just a useful political tool.'Attila,' although definitely an action movie, is also politically correct.  The misogyny of the Romans is clearly shown to be one of the empire's weaknesses, while the Hun empire turns out to be an egalitarian paradise that treats people from all over eastern Europe equally.  The pagan beliefs of the Huns are also shown to have more substance than the weak version of Christianity practiced by the Romans.Whether or not this has anything to do with real history is highly questionable.  In the end, the view the film takes of the era is that history was at a crossroads: either Aetius could have rebuilt Rome, Attila could have forged a Hun empire, or the Western World would be plunged into the Dark Ages (which do you think happened?).Especially intriguing are certain lines that imply that modern America has certain similarities to late-stage Rome (such as a remark on the excessive salaries of Roman athletes).  One could ask if America is on the verge of being overthrown by barbarians.As a DVD the film has some nice pluses.  On the DVD is a trailer and 'making of' featurette originally aired on USA to promote the film, and a the rather complicated web-interfacing picture gallery.  A Dolby 5.1 version of the audio is included, which is really fantastic.  Also, the video is in widescreen 'theatrical' format which is an improvement from its t.v. debut.  Strangely, the video is a little soft on darker colors- one review I read elsewhere said that it was due to a low quality film being used during filming.Another technical note: as the 'making of' bit reveals, very little cgi was used for special effects.  'Attila' harkens back to an old-fashioned way of making movies using optical effects, which is a nice change from modern Hollywood- where all too often the plot is used to support the effects, and not the effects to support the plot.Bottom line: if you can appreciate a brooding epic that does not glorify its protagonists and portrays 'history' on the grand scale, this is for you.  If you want a really 'Hollywood' film that is not going to make you think and will leave you feeling good, you won't like it.",4,A Pleasant Surprise,1002844800,"10 12, 2001",2001,4607,"['Yes', 'not', 'totally', 'accurate', 'historical', 'details', 'yes', 'was', 'intended', 'ride', 'fame', ""'Gladiator"", 'However', 'have', 'found', ""'Attila"", 'have', 'few', 'things', 'recommend', 'discriminating', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'mighty', 'armies', 'few', 'hundred', 'men', 'plastic', 'armor', 'soundtrack', 'motifs', 'score', ""'Gladiator"", 'make', 'statement.I', 'remember', 'college', 'World', 'History', '101', 'professor', 'lecturing', 'mysterious', 'quot', 'hordes', 'steppes', 'Eurasia', 'quot', 'cropped', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'Bronze', 'Iron', 'Ages.This', 'what', ""'Attila"", 'millenium', 'glory', 'Rome', 'corrupt', 'decadent', 'weak', 'new', 'band', 'people', 'Huns', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'steppes', 'are', 'full', 'energy', 'are', 'disorganized', 'lack', 'direction', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'rebuild', 'Rome-', 'Aetius', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'unite', 'Huns-', 'Attila', 'will', 'prevail', 'lead', 'world', 'new', 'era', 'What', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'epic', 'historical', 'dramas', 'treatment', 'protagonists', 'Most', 'epic', 'characters', 'films', ""'Spartacus"", 'William', 'Wallace', ""'Braveheart"", 'are', 'brimming', 'honor', 'nobility', 'are', 'people', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'next-door', 'neighbors', ""'Attila"", 'however', 'Aetius', 'potential', 'savior', 'Rome', 'cunning', 'stoic', 'determination', 'previous', 'Roman', 'leaders', 'not', 'portrayed', 'young', 'go-getter', 'Julius', 'Caesar', ""'Spartacus"", 'man', 'prime', 'life', 'Maximus', ""'Gladiator"", 'instead', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'film', 'already', 'bungled', 'best', 'chance', 'seize', 'throne', 'Caesars', 'rotting', 'prison', 'Attila', 'other', 'hand', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'traumatized', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'family', 'child', 'perhaps', 'result', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'head', 'Attila', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'ride', 'defenseless', 'village', 'massacre', 'peasants', 'there.One', 'film', 'major', 'achievements', 'make', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'rather', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'Also', 'emperors', 'two', 'halves', 'empire', 'are', 'given', 'different', 'treatment', 'usual', 'toga', 'flicks', 'rather', 'being', 'maniac', 'Roman', 'emperor', 'Valentinian', 'simply', 'moron-', 'Byzantine', 'emperor', 'Theodosius', 'corpulent', 'bitter', 'degenerate', 'whom', 'assassination', 'just', 'useful', 'political', 'tool', ""'Attila"", 'definitely', 'action', 'movie', 'also', 'politically', 'correct', 'misogyny', 'Romans', 'clearly', 'shown', 'be', 'one', 'empire', 'weaknesses', 'Hun', 'empire', 'out', 'be', 'egalitarian', 'paradise', 'people', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'equally', 'pagan', 'beliefs', 'Huns', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'have', 'more', 'substance', 'weak', 'version', 'Christianity', 'practiced', 'Romans.Whether', 'not', 'anything', 'do', 'real', 'history', 'highly', 'questionable', 'end', 'view', 'film', 'era', 'history', 'was', 'crossroads', 'Aetius', 'could', 'have', 'rebuilt', 'Rome', 'Attila', 'could', 'have', 'forged', 'Hun', 'empire', 'Western', 'World', 'would', 'be', 'plunged', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'do', 'think', 'happened', '.Especially', 'intriguing', 'are', 'certain', 'lines', 'imply', 'modern', 'America', 'certain', 'similarities', 'late-stage', 'Rome', 'such', 'remark', 'excessive', 'salaries', 'Roman', 'athletes', 'One', 'could', 'ask', 'America', 'verge', 'being', 'overthrown', 'barbarians.As', 'DVD', 'film', 'nice', 'pluses', 'DVD', 'trailer', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'originally', 'aired', 'USA', 'promote', 'film', 'rather', 'complicated', 'web-interfacing', 'picture', 'gallery', 'A', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'version', 'audio', 'included', 'really', 'fantastic', 'Also', 'video', 'widescreen', ""'theatrical"", 'format', 'improvement', 't.v', 'debut', 'Strangely', 'video', 'little', 'soft', 'darker', 'colors-', 'one', 'review', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'said', 'was', 'due', 'low', 'quality', 'film', 'being', 'used', 'filming.Another', 'technical', 'note', ""'making"", 'bit', 'reveals', 'very', 'little', 'cgi', 'was', 'used', 'special', 'effects', 'harkens', 'back', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'making', 'movies', 'using', 'optical', 'effects', 'nice', 'change', 'modern', 'Hollywood-', 'where', 'too', 'often', 'plot', 'used', 'support', 'effects', 'not', 'effects', 'support', 'plot.Bottom', 'line', 'can', 'appreciate', 'brooding', 'epic', 'not', 'glorify', 'protagonists', 'portrays', ""'history"", 'grand', 'scale', 'want', 'really', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'think', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like']",N/A

He was uncouth, bloody, savage, unaccustomed to the usual rules of brigade-oriented warfare; yet he was also a shrewd tactician who cared deeply about the welfare of his people, genuinely believed his conquered subjects were better off under him, and therefore strived to rule with justice.The adult Attila is played by Gerard Butler, who is quite good at capturing Attila's warlike side and his more cerebral, introspective side.  As Attila goes from becoming a mere chieftan to the ruler of an empire, his challenges go from providing his people mere sustenance to outthinking those clever Romans and outfighting those vicious Visigoths.  Along the way he encounters his share of personal triumphs and tragedies and Butler plays this meaty role with relish.  There isn't a false note among the supporting cast, most of whom will be unknown to American audiences, but look for Tim Curry as a Byzantine politician in, well, Byzantium.The production standards for this epic are of cinematic quality, and if not for its relatively long length this piece could easily have played in American movie houses.  Just because it was commissioned by the USA Network, don't assume there were any movie-of-the-week shortcuts taken in locations, casting, writing or direction, all of which are first-rate.  &quot;Attila&quot; has an old-fashioned feel for what an historical epic should be, and I mean that as a compliment.I found this movie utterly riveting.  I do not assume it represents the full truth, for movie epics of this type are usually written to set up historical coincidences that did not exist in fact.

577158,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B00005AFT5,Arch Stanton,"[2, 2]","I'm going to begin with the unusual tack of dealing with what's wrong with this film before going into what's right. Because what's wrong with this film is pretty basic: the Huns. Gerard Butler as the title character isn't too bad. He doesn't look like a Hun (think Asian, but mixed with the races of the various peoples between Hungary and China) and he overacts terribly. Every emotion is broadcast to the world and he seems to believe that a wide-eyed stare is the best way to convey his madness (MADNESS!?). I would have greatly preferred to have seen him play Attila with the same 'restraint' with which he playedLeonidas. However, since all the other Huns ham it up to an equal or worse extent he actually comes across as almost being understated. The worst of these is the witch Galen. Her character is atrociously conceived and written at the best of times, and is only made worse by her performance. Her acting is bad even for this series, and she isn't helped by wearing what appears to be a bird's nest on her head. She is comically out of place in what generally tries to be a serious miniseries. I am unable to watch the scenes with her in them so I skip them every time I watch the film, but she is so integrally entwined in some of the scenes that it is impossible to skip her scenes without skipping the plot. The scenes which take place with the Huns alone are almost universally dreadful.Fortunately, all is not lost. For there are Romans in this film. Good ones. The leading role is that of Powers Boothe who turns in an excellent performance as Flavius Aetius. Having never seen him do a period piece before (outside ofwesterns) it was a thrill to see him playing a Roman general. Aetius is slimy and manipulative, but loyal to his country. He may be a devious, conniving fella but you hate and admire him at the same time. He will do anything to gain power, provided that it doesn't come at the cost of Roman power. Which makes him ultimately a tragic character. Also excellent is Alice Krige as Galla Placidia and Tim Curry of all people as Theodosius II. They turn in highly entertaining performances which add to the film, even when the script lets them down. The only disappointment is the actor who plays Valentinian III. He's a spoiled, whiny brat, but that doesn't mean that he needs to wave his arms pathetically and pout all the time. As a character he's not well-written, but it's the performance that is painful. The Roman story is far more compelling since it is filled with intrigue and treachery. The Huns are remarkably free of that, although there is initially a fair amount of jockeying for power between the two heirs. They also resort to rather cheesy religious mumbo-jumbo that they clearly made up. They also make much of his discovery of a magic sword, which could have been cool if he'd found it the way he was supposed to (horse gets bloody hooves and they find a sword buried in their path) instead of having it all revolve around the witch.It's nice to see a movie where there isn't a clear-cut villain. Aetius is just trying to protect Rome while Attila is only trying to pillage everything in his path. Oh. I guess that Attila is the villain. But at least he's an honest one. All of the treachery and deceit comes from the Roman side. I admire this film for taking as its focus what should be such unlikeable characters and making them sympathetic. It also features a wonderful musicalscorewhich manages to be unique even though it is clearly imitatingGladiator.There are other problems with this miniseries but they're problems inherent in the format: The 'huge' battle scenes consist of maybe 200 people running around with swords; the Roman armor is from another era; the city of Rome is only one narrow road; etc. I'm not really gonna take points off for that because they do what they can with what little they have. Every scene with the Romans (particularly Aetius) is compelling. Every scene with nothing but Huns is boring. The scenes where both of them are together tends to elevate the Hunnic story to the Roman level. If you want to see an equally inaccurate take on Attila with better costumes but less story then check outWarriors. For a '50s take on Attila with a surprisingly good performance by Jack Palance seeSign of the Pagan. Oddly enough, the flaws are reversed there: the Huns are interesting and the Romans boring. But the best movie about Attila is still this one. It's consistently entertaining, except for those parts with Galen, and features a great turn by Powers Boothe.

Improbably, Attila and Aetius did share a friendship, and the whole 'Excalibur' center of the film, which I laughed at hardest, was based on fact: Attila did use a war sword found by one of his subjects as a sign of his power.There are small lapses: Theodosius and Placidia were both dead by the time Attila invaded Gaul, and the western empire's power, wealth and creativity at the time is exaggerated.  To be fair, the movie does suggest a nation in decline.  But ""Attila"" stumbles in its depiction of the Huns.  They were not white.  The Huns were an Asiatic people, closer to the Mongolians than the wandering tribe of Welshmen depicted in the film. Attila himself was short and squat, with an extremely thin beard and an imperious manner.Gerard Butler, who plays Attila, is a tall, leonine man who tries to convey the hard edge of the conqueror in his performance.  He bears a strong resemblance to Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart,"" but Butler's performance suggests a guy who got a horse for the weekend and decided to invade France with his buddies.  Half of his problem is the script, which wants the king of the Huns to be the Scourge of God and the Sensitive Teen, occasionally at the same time.  But Butler lacks subtlety.  He drops his voice when he's sad, and raises it when he's angry, and there's no in-between.  Some unintentionally funny moments arise from the performance: ""We could RULE the WORLD!"" forced a chuckle out of me.Powers Boothe, as Aetius, is superb, and nails his character's contradictions in the manner you would have expected from Butler.  When he's on screen, the film takes on the later Roman Empire's blend of decadence, depravity and determination.  It's fascinating, and nearly raises ""Attila"" to the level of minor classic.  Alice Krige also does well as his Roman nemesis, Placidia.  The battle scenes look cheap, though that's forgivable for a mini-series.  The ending feels a bit rushed, even for a three-hour movie.""Attila"" will hold your attention.  It's worth a rental.

All in all, however, it is a film that is well done & well worth viewing.It is a fact that Attila did set foot inside the walls of Rome as a guest.  However, it is false that he was the guest of Flavius Aetius while both were grown men.  As a matter of fact, as a boy the two were ""exchanged.""  Atilla lived in Rome while Flavius Aetius lived amongst the Huns.  It was then that Attila swore that he would return one day not as a guest of Rome, but as its conquerer.It is dubious that Attila obtained a liking for the hot baths of Rome during his youthful sojourn in the city.  By all accounts of the period historians, the king of the Huns lived a very simple and Spartan existence, despite the excesses of his officers and his extravagant wealth.  Gerard Butler also portrays a bit more of a debonair and ""GQ looking"" Atilla than I ever imagined the historical Atilla.  However, that is forgivable.  After all, this is Hollywood, right?It is a fact that Valentian III personally murdered Aetius (bad idea) in 454 A.D.  As someone supposedly told Valentian, ""With your left hand, you have cut off your right hand.""  Also, the Romans did sign a treaty with the Visigothic king Theoderic I to aid in fighting the Huns.  This was a reversal from earlier times when the Romans and Huns ganged up on the Visigoths.  This is recounted accurately in the film.All in all, this was an extremely good effort.  It is very hard to display the dwindling years of an empire's hegemony in 3 short hours.  This movie does an excellent job with the material at its disposal.  The battle scenes are fairly well done, and they even pull off a passable battle of the Catalaunian Plains in the climactic sequence.  However, the armies are a bit undersized;  it quickly becomes evident that the film's budget did not have the resources for an extensive use of extras.  But, the battle scenes are well choreographed & do show off the ""tortiose"" formation of the Legions.After the death of Attila, Rome held on to her supremacy for a few more decades before finally seeing her empire fade into the darkness.  Rome was one of the greatest and most long-lasting empires the world has ever seen. It was people like Atilla and Shapur who helped push it over the precipice.  As such, Atilla became one of the most feared, hated and respected men in all of history.

577181,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00005AFT5,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[0, 0]","Attila the Hun is a shadowy character in history. This is primarily due to the fact that the Huns and other peoples allied with and subject to them left little by way of written documentation. Most of what we know comes through Roman Imperial sources; even the legends that originated beyond the borders of the Eastern and Western Imperial lands were transcribed (and no doubt modified in the process) by the writers to suit their world view, if not particular political intentions.Much of the legendary Attila has been re-worked over time so that many nations in Europe and Asia have claimed at one time or another either kinship with or victory over or subjugation to Attila. Some of these legends show forth in the movie, and others do not. This movie does not get high marks for historical accuracy. The Roman political scene is not as it is described; save for a few of the names that have been preserved, few of the events and intrigues presented in the film have any historical accuracy. Unlike films that play fast and loose with history while maintaining some integrity with the subject (notable examples include Elizabeth, I Claudius, and Pearl Harbor), this movie is, apart from the most general of frameworks of characterization, a work of fiction.The primary historical argument I would have (beyond the fictional political intrigues which provided much of the plot) was the nearly-complete absence of the early church and its influence. This was a period in which the old Roman order was failing, both in the East and West, and the power of bishops, including Leo, bishop (pope) of Rome, was on the rise. There is virtually no mention of the church at all, and the power brokers of the church are absent - history records that, often as not, it was the bishop of the cities being attacked that negotiated peace or terms or surrender, and not the imperial diplomatic corps. Leo himself is credited with keeping Attila from attacking Rome. One would never gather this from the film. Of course, these scenes are not given to great drama. However, earlier films on Attila have included something of these scenes.Likewise, we do not know that Attila had a fascination with red-haired women (a key element in the film), or that he was murdered after his wedding by a disgruntled-captive-become-queen. These are speculation, but there are legendary sources that could lend support. I can forgive a movie like 'Gladiator', which does not purport to be based on actual events more than I can overlook such issues in a movie designed to present an actual historical figure. Attila's legendary death is recorded by various sources in differing ways - some by slaves, some by freeborn, some by a wife revenging herself, some by natural causes, some by angels bent on protecting the young, developing Christendom. Most likely he was murdered, as many Hun and other tribal leaders were, but as the records are sketchy at best, and his body laid to rest in an unknown place, it is unlikely we shall ever know definitely.These criticisms aside, the movie is entertaining. Gerard Butler, a newcomer Scotsman, does a serviceable job as Attila (and, as a note of historicity, it is appropriate that a Celt should play this role, as an enemy of Rome). He has played smaller roles in films such as 'Mrs. Brown' and 'One More Kiss', but this is his first major role.A few mentions should be given to Powers Boothe (who plays the Roman general Flavius Aetius) and Alice Krige (who plays the mother of the Western emperor Valentian), who give powerful performances, albeit with stilted scripts and direction. They perform their roles well. Sian Phillips (from 'I Claudius' fame, among others) is lost potential in her small cameo at the beginning, and Tim Curry is under-utilised as the Eastern Emperor Theodosius. Mention should also be made of Andrew Pleavin, as the honourable and loyal general to Attila, Orestes (ironically, again, this shining character is based upon what one historian calls 'the most unprincipled turn-coat in history'). His role is brief but memorable.The battle scenes are fair, although it is apparent that low budgets caused many corners to be cut, both for numbers (yes, we have been spoiled by the Cecil B. DeMille epic styles) and for equipment/settings. The same is true for the overall sets. (Apparently Rome only had one street and three buildings.) In setting up the contrast between Roman opulence and barbarian simplicity, the sets were effective. However, there was insufficient attention to detail to give it believability.Alas, there is not much more to say. My friends and I have often used the phrase 'USA movie' to denote that type of film that is not bad, but not really great, that is entertaining to a degree, but not inspiring. A fairly generic film. The music was passing fair, but far from memorable. The overall direction and cinematography was competent but generic. This is a film worth watching, but only once, and then followed by an intensive course of reading to see what the world was really like.If there is one great advantage of the film, it is that it might inspire people to learn more about Attila and the Roman Empire during the period of its decline.",4,The finctional hun...,1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,5206,"['Hun', 'shadowy', 'character', 'history',

But it should be enjoyed as the modern classic that it is.The movie begins with Attila at 10, who see's his father and family butchered by local tribesman, somewhere in the plains of Eastern Europe, and the adorable little red haired boy (who could just as easily resemble the young King David of Israel or the young King Arthur of Britain), soon proves his mettle by stabbing one of the Barbarians in the leg and then stealing his horse.Attila grows up at the camp of his uncle King Ruah of the Huns. With the aid of a local young sorceress, Gaylin, who has visions of his greatness, and his own magnetic personality and prowess in battle, he soon makes a name for himself (played by Gerard Butler) , before helping the Romans to defeat the Visigoths, traveling to Rome with the Roman General Aetius, where we see the full pomp , intrigue and decadence of the imperial court, and where Attila makes a mark for himself, meeting the pathetic Roman Emperor Valentinian and his wicked mother, bedding the sexy but scheming Princess Honoria.When he returns back to Germany he defeats and kills his evil brother Bleda, seizing the Hunnish crown, marrying a red headed slave girl and carving for himself, through warfare, an empire stretching across Europe, before threatening the Roman Empire.Attila was known in history as `The Scourge of G-D'.

Well, this is another great addition to the loosely history based battle epic movie genre.When I watch movies like this, I always wonder how they will make it different from past movies like Braveheart. Unlike Braveheart, Atilla the hun is not a nice character. He is an extreme womanizer, a warlord, and sometimes irrational. This makes it hard to cheer for a happy ending, because both sides are somewhat evil.  Also unlike Braveheart, this movie is alot deeper in story.

The movie does not faithfully follow the original sources on Attila the Hun, rather it is INSPIRED by these, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the real accounts. One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied History, you know the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration of course was when dealing with Attila himself, who is portrayed as ""really nice guy"" who is ""determined"" to have his way, when in actual fact he was one of the most brutal/lethal people to have existed (what so many tend to call a ""butcher"" and a ""tyrant"" these days...).  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that one must never do so at the expense of accuracy i.e. the truth. Why? Because Attila was a REAL person and a very important historical figure and not part of some modern twentieth century novel!  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read the actual sources) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually did.  Consequently, due to this distortion, the movie poses a very serious danger of producing armies of misinformed people who think they know Attila's history when they really do not.  Not good!On the positive side, the movie does succeed in transporting the viewer back in time when the Roman Empire had recently been divided into Eastern and Western parts, following Emperor Theodosius's death in 395 AD and the subsequent division of the Empire between his two sons: Arcadius and Honorius.The film does a great job of presenting these times and therefore providing a very accurate and thus, contradicting Decadent West (Rome) compared to the Pious East (Constantinople).The movie is action packed, the acting is very good and the cast are wonderful.  The actors' performances are outstanding, especially Tim Curry playing the Byzantine Emperor, steals the show, but also the rest of the actors who have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  Hopefully, more movies will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.  And hopefully they will be historically accurate as well!In short, it is my belief that the movie deserves 4 stars for the top quality and entertainment it provides, but falls short of 5 stars for deviating so much from the original and creating a sense of confusion among viewers.",4,"Good movie, but lacking historical accuracy!

Atilla was a made-for-tv movie, and thus puts it in a seperate category. Do I judge it in comparison to hollywood? Or in comparison to other TV movies?... it's tricky but here's a go...Atilla is a biographical, historical film about many epic, but by no means original, themes - destiny, war, power, love, betrayal. The man commonly known to history as Atilla the Hun was voted one of the most hated men in all history (apparently he even beat hitler!). The infamous legend depicts a brutal barbarian warlord, who saight to destroy rome. An upstart tribe of barbarians threatening the end of the most powerful empire on earth is an appealing enough plot, but atilla takes a different direction, paying more close attention to the realer side of Atilla the hun - which isnt as anything like the horrible rap history gives him (history is written by the winners).Atilla is shown in the movie as abhoring the roman way of life - the decadence, and coruption - the lies and trickery and politics. He does however, respect and admire it's power and status. ""Civilization belongs to whoever is strong enough to take it"" he says in the one scene. Seeing it as his destiny to destroy rome and rule the world, the inevitable result is war.The plot and historical material is the strongest point of the film, being fairly accurate to the context of this point in history. Rome is shown as it was at this time as being in a constant internal power struggle, and ussing trickery, bribery and cleverness to divide and conquer it's enemies and thus keep its place in the world despite it's declining strength. The movie has some good points, but some negatives. The acting is pretty good sometimes, but overall isnt very good at all. The sounds arent very good, and effects are poor. You can tell this was a tv movie.The first time I watched this movie I didnt like it, but it grew on me. I began to like both atillas character and the development of his relationship with rome (admiration and awe mixed with hatred and despise). The battle scenes are good for a tv movie but wouldnt hold a candle to cinematic masterpieces like brave heart or gladiator (the manuevers are more or less correct though, so that was a good point).All in all... if this were a hollywood movie Id give it a solid 2 stars... maybe 3 just out of the kindness of my heart. But since most tv movies are so much worse than this, and since I actually did like the movie after rewatching it a few times, Im inclined to give it a very generous 4 stars.

The movie is entertaining but is light on historical and anthropological accuracy.The film isn't faithful to history in its depiction of the Huns. The Huns cared for little else than their nomadic existence; ride your horse free, kill and plunder whatever you come across. Very much like Genghis Kahn's famous quote almost eight centuries later, what was best in life for the Huns was to crush the enemy; see them driven before them; take their cattle; and hear the lamentation of their women. Butler's performance fails to show that ethos. His performance is forced and his dilemma is partially due to a poor script; this is made all too obvious in his apologetically soft and withheld exclamation, &quot;We should rule the world!&quot; The movie would have held more sway if it would have depicted the Huns for what they really were, Asiatic nomads, supreme cavaliers, and masters of archery who plundered their victims by either outright pillaging and massacre or exaction of tribute by threatening the latter. The Huns must have been barbaric indeed if they could even bring the still very barbaric Gothic tribes of Northern Europe to submission. Another fearful element of the Huns is that they were godless heathens who didn't share the Christian values of many Germanic tribes or their Roman rulers: as such, notions of respecting the sanctity of the church, sophisticated diplomacy, or sparing innocent civilians, was quite foreign to them.On the Roman side, Powers Boothe as Aetius is probably one of the better performances in this film but its nothing to brag about. The mannerisms and culture of Rome depicted are stereotypical. The movie tries to create an impression of Rome as a pagan and decadent state but Christianity had significantly taken its hold since it was made the official state religion by Constantine almost two centuries before. The ritualized orgy depicted in the film was therefore out of place. The costumes were also either a mix between futuristic or more of the early empire and late republic.In terms of historical accuracy, the battle scenes were obviously under a limited budget. The actual battles involved far more than the few hundred shown in the film and both the legionary tactics and equipment were horribly out of date by several centuries. The tactics of the legions had shifted to the extensive use of cavalry while infantry had been relegated to marginal uses. The age of the legendary Roman infantry with pilum and gladius was a thing of the past.The movie was a brave attempt and not too bad for a T.V. miniseries and, in that context, deserves three stars.

Rome Trembled.And Audiences Giggle.Cross Lord of the Rings with a bodice-ripper romance and mix in a little Gladiator and you have this two-part movie starring hunky Scot Gerard Butler as the marauding king of the Scythian hordes known as the Huns. The Romans called him the Scourge of God, and the real Attila brought Europe to its knees, but Attila in this movie is played by Butler as a tormented man with a sexy overbite and some family dysfunction. There is intrigue and bloodwash aplenty. The Huns are depicted as a rather Celtic, not Asian, tribe, complete with wood sprite who delivers prophecies to Attila, King-Arthur style. These involve a gaining ownership of a sword, with which one rules the world. Okaaaay....Decent, albeit comic, performances are given as Romans by Tim Curry and some other guy as emperor of Rome about this time frame (the year 452 or thereabouts). Powers Boothe is Roman General Flavius Aetius who alternately conspires with and against Attila. The emperor's sister, a hot-looking Roman princess in a corsety-type thing I am pretty sure did not exist in that timeframe, seduces Attila in a bath, even though he's supposed to be in love with the red haired woman his tribe captured from a village. Men never change. Alice Krige as the emperor's mother is much prettier here than she was as the Borg Queen in Star Trek but she's bitchy and conspires against everybody, even her own children.Gerard Butler makes a sexy Attila, and he can invade my village anytime. However, he's Scottish, and seems to be affecting some kind of weird accent here, where syllables fall out of his mouth in an oddly non-commanding warrior way. Fearsome Attila gets his comeuppance on his wedding night, all right, but not in the historically accurate way. But USA's way is much more romantic and candle-lit.

On the one hand, Attila the Hun is depicted in a fairly favorable light as a Barbarian warlord bent upon raising his steppe-dwelling people up from poverty to world domination.  General Flavius Aetius, wonderfully acted by Powers Boothe, is depicted as the &quot;last of the Romans,&quot; intent upon frustrating Attila's conquests and thereby preserving the tottering Roman Empire.  Thus, the stage is set for a great mano-i-mano battle between the haves and the have-nots of the world.  As history, the film gets the essential elements correct: Attilla and Aetius did exist and do most of the things depicted.  The film is also rich in the tensions evident in a decaying Roman empire and a seething mass of Barbarians awaiting the final death throes.  However, the film also abbreviates and alters a great many of the particulars of this classic late-empire struggle.Aetitius was in fact something of a barbarian himself.  Although the film depicts him as imprisoned by the conniving regent, the mother of the Emporer Valentinian III, Aetitius in fact spent three years (430-433 AD) hiding out with the Huns after an unsuccessful power struggle.  There were virtually no &quot;Roman&quot; troops left for Aetitius to command and he relied heavily on Huns and Goths to fill out his ranks.  The film's depiction of Roman troops in 1st Century AD uniforms and equipment is erroneous.  Attila's troops are also depicted as ethnic Europeans when in fact, they were of central Asian origin.  The more bizarre but factual Hun traits, such as ritual mutilation of their faces to make themselves seem more fearsome, are not shown. The final Battle of Chalons is not represented accurately at all, but it still interesting.  Many such aspects of this film will be annoying to historians for lacking in veracity.In fact, it is rather surprising to see such a favorable impression of the Huns.  Personally, I was cheering when Attila drinks poison at the end, because he was one of the most evil and dangerous men in history.  Attila's entire legacy consists of devastation, arson, looting and murder.  He and his Huns were only capable of destruction, not creation, as this film suggests. Had he been more successful, Christianity might have been destroyed in infancy.Unlike the flashier film Gladiator, Attila has much more character depth and plot outline.  The twenty-year struggle of Attila versus Aetitius is far more interesting than a simple revenge movie.  While many small details are incorrect, the film does get the major issues correct.  There are not many films about the later years of the Roman Empire, but this film is probably one of the best.",5,Inaccurate but Good,990316800,"05 20, 2001",2001,2744,"['Attila', 'attempts', 'portray', 'struggle', 'two', 'men', 'two', 'cultures', '433', '453', 'AD', 'one', 'hand', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'depicted', 'fairly', 'favorable', 'light', 'Barbarian', 'warlord', 'bent', 'raising', 'steppe-dwelling', 'people', 'poverty', 'world', 'domination', 'General', 'Flavius', 'Aetius', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'depicted', 'quot', 'last', 'Romans', 'quot', 'intent', 'frustrating', 'Attila', 'conquests', 'thereby', 'preserving', 'tottering', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Thus', 'stage', 'set', 'great', 'mano-i-mano', 'battle', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'world', 'history', 'film', 'essential', 'elements', 'correct', 'Attilla', 'Aetius', 'did', 'exist', 'do', 'most', 'things', 'depicted', 'film', 'also', 'rich', 'tensions', 'evident', 'decaying', 'Roman', 'empire', 'seething', 'mass', 'Barbarians', 'awaiting', 'final', 'death', 'throes', 'However', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'many', 'particulars', 'classic', 'late-empire', 'struggle.Aetitius', 'was', 'fact', 'something', 'barbarian', 'film', 'imprisoned', 'conniving', 'regent', 'mother', 'Emporer', 'Valentinian', 'III', 'Aetitius', 'fact', 'spent', 'three', 'years', '430-433', 'AD', 'hiding', 'out', 'Huns', 'unsuccessful', 'power', 'struggle', 'were', 'virtually', 'quot', 'Roman', 'quot', 'troops', 'left', 'Aetitius', 'command', 'relied', 'heavily', 'Huns', 'Goths', 'fill', 'out', 'ranks', 'film', 'depiction', 'Roman', 'troops', '1st', 'Century', 'AD', 'uniforms', 'equipment', 'erroneous', 'Attila', 'troops', 'are', 'also', 'depicted', 'ethnic', 'Europeans', 'when', 'fact', 'were', 'central', 'Asian', 'origin', 'more', 'bizarre', 'factual', 'Hun', 'traits', 'such', 'ritual', 'mutilation', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'fearsome', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'final', 'Battle', 'Chalons', 'not', 'represented', 'accurately', 'still', 'interesting', 'Many', 'such', 'aspects', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'annoying', 'historians', 'lacking', 'veracity.In', 'fact', 'rather', 'surprising', 'see', 'such', 'favorable', 'impression', 'Huns', 'Personally', 'was', 'cheering', 'when', 'Attila', 'poison', 'end', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'dangerous', 'men', 'history', 'Attila', 'entire', 'legacy', 'devastation', 'arson', 'looting', 'murder', 'Huns', 'were', 'only', 'capable', 'destruction', 'not', 'creation', 'film', 'Had', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'Christianity', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'infancy.Unlike', 'flashier', 'film', 'Gladiator', 'Attila', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'depth', 'plot', 'outline', 'twenty-year', 'struggle', 'Attila', 'versus', 'Aetitius', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'simple', 'revenge', 'movie', 'many', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'incorrect', 'film', 'get', 'major', 'issues', 'correct', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'later', 'years', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'best']",N/A

577216,AJ2RU4VJ470IU,B00005AFT5,Robert Law,"[3, 5]","Attila could easily have been a theatrical release. For a made-for-television miniseries event, that is perhaps one of the highest compliments that I can pay. Attila has some of the best production values ever seen for such a film, and uses them to grand effect. Even the score (which closely, and no doubt intentionally,resembles Hans Zimmer's from Gladiator) achieves an usual level of excellence.Gerard Butler (an up-and-coming Scottish actor with a fair share of talent) stars as Attila the Hun,the intelligent and ambitious warlord who gave the Roman Empire a run for its money. His friend and rival, a Roman general named Flavius Aetius (portrayed solidly by Powers Boothe), is all that stands between Attila and the destruction of the Empire that he so adores. Their relationship and rivalry is at the heart of the film, and is also the highlight of the production. While some made-for-television epics go more for special effects and massive battles, Attila is character-driven, and delightfully so. There are grand battles as well, and fine visuals that bring Rome and the Huns to life, but none of these things can make a good film on their own(which is something that Jason and the Argonauts should have learned). Fortunately for Attila, it is blessed with clever writing, good direction, and above-average performances. It's no Gladiator or Braveheart, but it's come closer than any miniseries has ever come before.There are doses of the supernatural in Attila that seem rather out-of-sorts and silly in a film of this type, and yet Attila offers a cynical dose of realism with its leading characters. Neither Attila nor Flavius are the most sympathetic of people, and yet at the same time they are both likable, even admirable, in their own way in spite of their many immoral failings. When Attila and Flavius square off to decide the fate of Rome and the newfound Empire of the Huns, it is almost impossible to chose a side, and that makes the outcome somewhat unfulfilling. The whole of the production is a rising action that somehow manages to fizzle disappointingly upon its conclusion. And yet, as a whole, Attila is a remarkable film, espesially given that it was made for USA Network.As a feature film, it might be worth 3 stars - but as a made-for-television film, it earns 4 with flying colors...",4,The Best Epic Miniseries Thus Far,997920000,"08 16, 2001",2001,2318,"['Attila', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'theatrical', 'release', 'made-for-television', 'miniseries', 'event', 'perhaps', 'one', 'highest', 'compliments', 'can', 'pay', 'Attila', 'best', 'production', 'values', 'ever', 'seen', 'such', 'film', 'grand', 'effect', 'Even', 'score', 'closely', 'doubt', 'intentionally', 'resembles', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Gladiator', 'usual', 'level', 'excellence.Gerard', 'Butler', 'up-and-coming', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'fair', 'share', 'talent', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'intelligent', 'ambitious', 'warlord', 'who', 'gave', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'run', 'money', 'friend', 'rival', 'Roman', 'general', 'named', 'Flavius', 'Aetius', 'portrayed', 'solidly', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Attila', 'destruction', 'Empire', 'so', 'relationship', 'rivalry', 'heart', 'film', 'also', 'highlight', 'production', 'made-for-television', 'epics', 'go', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'massive', 'battles', 'Attila', 'character-driven', 'delightfully', 'so', 'are', 'grand', 'battles', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'visuals', 'bring', 'Rome', 'Huns', 'life', 'none', 'things', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'own', 'something', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'should', 'have', 'learned', 'Fortunately', 'Attila', 'blessed', 'clever', 'writing', 'good', 'direction', 'above-average', 'performances', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'come', 'closer', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'come', 'are', 'doses', 'supernatural', 'Attila', 'seem', 'rather', 'out-of-sorts', 'silly', 'film', 'type', 'yet', 'Attila', 'cynical', 'dose', 'realism', 'leading', 'characters', 'Attila', 'Flavius', 'are', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'people', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'likable', 'even', 'admirable', 'own', 'way', 'spite', 'many', 'immoral', 'failings', 'When', 'Attila', 'Flavius', 'square', 'off', 'decide', 'fate', 'Rome', 'newfound', 'Empire', 'Huns', 'almost', 'impossible', 'chose', 'side', 'outcome', 'somewhat', 'unfulfilling', 'whole', 'production', 'rising', 'action', 'somehow', 'fizzle', 'disappointingly', 'conclusion', 'yet', 'whole', 'Attila', 'remarkable', 'film', 'espesially', 'given', 'was', 'made', 'USA', 'Network.As', 'feature', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'worth', '3', 'stars', 'made-for-television', 'film', '4', 'flying', 'colors']",N/A

I was pleasantly shocked! I watched the ""Making of..."" featurette before watching the actual series and could not believe how much the makers were able to create with so little. There was only one moment in the entire series where the low budget revealed itself and made me flinch: the Roman market in the moonlight looked drawn with a pencil...  Employing Lithuanian mounted police with their own horses and recent military recruits as the Roman Army was a stroke of genius! So, two thumbs up to the quality of the production...(I will say nothing of the quality of the supporting cast; just watch it for yourself and you will be impressed!).With that said, the historical inaccuracies were unbearable... Very quickly into the movie I decided to watch it strictly for its entertainment, rather then educational (which was none) value. This was more of a fairytale/love story, then an accurate reflection of the reality of those days....Last, but not least: Butler as the real Attila would have been a bust (for one thing, Attila is described by historians as short and, as a pure blood Hun, indefinitely ugly by western standards; Butler is 6'2"" and, shall we say, MUCH closer to the current standard of beauty). However, he made a charismatic hero of a fable...(though I could have done with less hair extensions and no eyeliner). I wish the wardrobe department would have re-thought Attila's undergarmets. One in particular, a diaper like loin cloth, was just too much. Every time the diaper made an appearance, my house would echo with hysterical laughter (my viewing companion and I thought there was enough fabric there to fully cloth at least two grown men). I am sure it was not the intention of the producers to turn Attila's romantic escapades into comedic entertainment, but...Anyway, entertaining story, as long as you do not look to learn anything historically factual from it, with a lead who is easy on the eyes...

I'm not talking about plot details -- to tell a good story you've got to make stuff up, like Attila going to Rome and boffing the emperor's sister -- but rather about the false picture of Roman society this film conveys. To begin with, the orgy scene: the idea that the Romans were wallowing in sensual pleasure while the barbarians were at the gates is utter nonsense. Roman morals were strict, especially once Christianity had taken hold. And speaking of Christianity, we get scarcely a glimpse of the now-powerful Church and its grip on the court, not even a hint of the Pope's famous embassy that kept the Huns out of Italy.Another reviewer has pointed out the inaccurate picture of Roman warfare. I'd add that it seems very odd that the close-ranked legionaries with their rectangular shields -- themselves an anachronism -- break ranks as soon as they get within striking distance of the enemy, thus sacrificing all the advantages of their formation!Still, it's fun to see the stuff they did get right. Aetius was indeed raised among the Huns and was a friend to their kings, and his remarkable career merits greater fame. Honoria did send Attila a letter with her ring, which served as the pretext for attacking the western Empire. Valentinian may indeed have personally murdered Aetius.

It's possible to quibble over details of history -- no film ever seems to get it right, and this one plays extremely loosely with numerous facts about Attila and his era -- but this is a dramatic, colorful production sure to please anyone who loves tales of epic conflict. The battle scenes are undermanned but are well executed and convincing, particularly in the final 30 minutes of the three-hour saga. There is also a great deal of pageantry, with excellent costumes and sets and a lush setting for the tale. But this story doesn't end on the battlefield and, while some will say the final portion is anticlimactic, it does add a historically accurate wrap to events.",3,"An intense Attila, arrogant and brooding.",1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,842,"['Television', 'making', 'bold', 'strides', 'competition', 'big', 'screen', 'making', 'powerful', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'mini-series', 'such', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'now', 'Attila', 'possible', 'quibble', 'over', 'details', 'history', 'film', 'ever', 'get', 'right', 'one', 'extremely', 'loosely', 'numerous', 'facts', 'Attila', 'era', 'dramatic', 'colorful', 'production', 'sure', 'please', 'anyone', 'who', 'tales', 'epic', 'conflict', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'undermanned', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'convincing', 'particularly', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'three-hour', 'saga', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'pageantry', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'sets', 'lush', 'setting', 'tale', 'story', ""n't"", 'end', 'battlefield', 'will', 'say', 'final', 'portion', 'anticlimactic', 'add', 'historically', 'accurate', 'wrap', 'events']",N/A

It's surprisingly well directed, has some good locations and production design and boasts a better use of colour than most TV productions shot in Eastern Europe. It never gets too bogged down with the 'prophecy' guff that sank 'Vercingetorix/Druids,' although the script has much more fun with the Romans and their plots, counterplots and betrayals than the nominal lead - so much fun that it's a disappointment to be dragged back to those pesky Huns. Too often the film grinds to a halt when Attila is onscreen, with only the Romans providing any forward momentum.The major problem is the gaping void at the centre of the show. Where it needs a charismatic, commanding and dangerous star, it gets the frankly underwhelming Gerard Butler. It's not just that Butler is an extremely limited and startlingly dull actor (he even moves badly) or that his bizarre hybrid Scottish-American accent seems so completely out of time and place. He completely fails to command the screen, his lack of screen presence rendering an already underwritten role even more anonymous. He seems more like an expendable extra from 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad' than a man who could create an empire and take on the greatest superpower the world has ever known. It's hard to imagine anyone following him to the pub on a stag night let along across Europe on a trail of destruction.Not that Butler is the only eccentric casting in the film - Pauline Lynch's bizarre Jolly Hockey Sticks accent makes her sound more like a refugee from the Chalet School than a credible pagan soothsayer, Reg Rogers puts such a unique spin on the obligatory idiotic emperor that you really, really hope he really is just acting, while Alice Krige's bizarre (and quickly discarded) lisp in her early scenes is very distracting. But generally it's the supporting cast that shines, with Powers Boothe the genuine star of the show. Yes, there are some misjudged moments, but he dominates the drama in a way that Butler never does.Well worth watching, but you might find yourself wanting to use the fastforward button more than a few times in the second half.",3,Rome saves the day again,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,2205,"['not', 'exactly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'mini-series', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'directed', 'good', 'locations', 'production', 'design', 'better', 'use', 'colour', 'most', 'TV', 'productions', 'shot', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'never', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', ""'prophecy"", 'guff', 'sank', ""'Vercingetorix/Druids"", 'script', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'Romans', 'plots', 'counterplots', 'betrayals', 'nominal', 'lead', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'disappointment', 'be', 'dragged', 'back', 'pesky', 'Huns', 'Too', 'often', 'film', 'halt', 'when', 'Attila', 'onscreen', 'only', 'Romans', 'providing', 'forward', 'momentum.The', 'major', 'problem', 'gaping', 'void', 'centre', 'show', 'Where', 'charismatic', 'commanding', 'dangerous', 'star', 'frankly', 'underwhelming', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'not', 'just', 'Butler', 'extremely', 'limited', 'startlingly', 'dull', 'actor', 'even', 'badly', 'bizarre', 'hybrid', 'Scottish-American', 'accent', 'so', 'completely', 'time', 'place', 'completely', 'command', 'screen', 'lack', 'screen', 'presence', 'rendering', 'already', 'underwritten', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'anonymous', 'more', 'expendable', 'extra', ""'The"", 'Golden', 'Voyage', 'Sinbad', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'create', 'empire', 'take', 'greatest', 'superpower', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'following', 'pub', 'stag', 'night', 'let', 'Europe', 'trail', 'destruction.Not', 'Butler', 'only', 'eccentric', 'casting', 'film', 'Pauline', 'Lynch', 'bizarre', 'Jolly', 'Hockey', 'Sticks', 'accent', 'sound', 'more', 'refugee', 'Chalet', 'School', 'credible', 'pagan', 'soothsayer', 'Reg', 'Rogers', 'such', 'unique', 'spin', 'obligatory', 'idiotic', 'emperor', 'really', 'really', 'hope', 'really', 'just', 'acting', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'bizarre', 'quickly', 'discarded', 'lisp', 'early', 'scenes', 'very', 'distracting', 'generally', 'supporting', 'cast', 'shines', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'genuine', 'star', 'show', 'Yes', 'are', 'misjudged', 'moments', 'drama', 'way', 'Butler', 'never', 'does.Well', 'worth', 'watching', 'might', 'find', 'wanting', 'use', 'fastforward', 'button', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'second', 'half']",N/A
