I also really do not recommend practicing yoga without taking classes, if classes are not available to you then read as many books as you can on the subject particulary paying attention to alignment principles.  You will eventually injure yourself if you do not fully understand how to do the asanas.  Look for an Iyengar teacher as they are excellent in teaching alignment.  Use this dvd as a complement to your classes.This workout has two sections, forward bending and backbends, as they are complementary to each other.  The forward bending workout is more attainable for beginners, and Patricia Walden provides excellent instruction.  The backbending workout is more challenging and if you do not have sufficient strength it will be impossible.  I would recommend doing bridge pose instead of upward bow until your strength is improved.  Also Patricia instructs you to ""step your feet in"" Once you are up in upward bow to shorten the distance between hands and feet to intensify the backbend.  This is pretty advanced and most people won't be able to do this.  My yoga instructor has not taught us to do this yet as a lot of people in my class just have a hard time getting into the pose.  So don't do this until you are totally comfortable in the original position!Another reviewer said that the workout didn't provide enough warm-up before the difficult part and I like to do some sun salutations from Shiva Rea's excellent dvd Yoga Shakti before doing this workout.  I still do build a lot of heat by really focusing on the preliminary poses in this dvd though.I would give this dvd five stars, but because it is not stated as  a more advanced workout and could be misleading, I gave it four.  I really love this dvd, I believe I get the best workout in the shortest amount of time of any dvd I own.  I love the instruction, and the length of time the poses are held.  You really get acqainted with the asana!  For me, this is the next best thing to my classes.",4,Not for beginners!!!!,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,2055,"['am', 'glad', 'see', 'dvd', 'not', 'touted', 'beginners', 'vhs', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'taking', 'classes', 'classes', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'then', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'can', 'subject', 'particulary', 'paying', 'attention', 'alignment', 'principles', 'will', 'eventually', 'injure', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'do', 'asanas', 'Look', 'Iyengar', 'teacher', 'are', 'excellent', 'teaching', 'alignment', 'Use', 'dvd', 'complement', 'classes.This', 'workout', 'two', 'sections', 'forward', 'bending', 'backbends', 'are', 'complementary', 'other', 'forward', 'bending', 'workout', 'more', 'attainable', 'beginners', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'backbending', 'workout', 'more', 'challenging', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'sufficient', 'strength', 'will', 'be', 'impossible', 'would', 'recommend', 'doing', 'bridge', 'pose', 'instead', 'upward', 'bow', 'strength', 'improved', 'Also', 'Patricia', 'step', 'feet', 'are', 'up', 'upward', 'bow', 'shorten', 'distance', 'hands', 'feet', 'intensify', 'backbend', 'pretty', 'advanced', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'not', 'taught', 'do', 'yet', 'lot', 'people', 'class', 'just', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'pose', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'are', 'totally', 'comfortable', 'original', 'position', 'reviewer', 'said', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'enough', 'warm-up', 'difficult', 'part', 'like', 'do', 'sun', 'salutations', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'excellent', 'dvd', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'doing', 'workout', 'still', 'do', 'build', 'lot', 'heat', 'really', 'focusing', 'preliminary', 'poses', 'dvd', 'though.I', 'would', 'give', 'dvd', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'stated', 'more', 'advanced', 'workout', 'could', 'be', 'misleading', 'gave', 'four', 'really', 'love', 'dvd', 'believe', 'get', 'best', 'workout', 'shortest', 'amount', 'time', 'dvd', 'own', 'love', 'instruction', 'length', 'time', 'poses', 'are', 'held', 'really', 'get', 'acqainted', 'asana', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'classes']",N/A

Even as an intermediate yoga practicioner, I did not like this tape, primarily because it throws you into the difficult poses without first generating sufficient heat in the body. The warm-up poses are minimal, static, and do not prepare your body sufficiently for the extensions and compressions of the advanced postures that follow. Besides all that, the instruction goes from excrutiating detail to not enough information (you have to break concentration and look to see what's going on) in the course of a single series of poses. Very frustrating. As if that weren't bad enough, the instructor's amazing flexibility is about the only inspiring aspect of the tape; her monotone delivery and the spare studio setting with no students make for a no fun experience.",1,"Not for Beginners, or anyone else",1037923200,"11 22, 2002",2002,950,"['Attempting', 'difficult', 'poses', 'even', 'modified', 'versions', 'sure-fire', 'way', 'discourage', 'beginners', 'practice', 'make', 'feel', 'inadequate', 'not', 'what', 'Yoga', 'should', 'cultivate', 'Even', 'intermediate', 'yoga', 'practicioner', 'did', 'not', 'tape', 'primarily', 'difficult', 'poses', 'first', 'generating', 'sufficient', 'heat', 'body', 'warm-up', 'poses', 'are', 'minimal', 'static', 'do', 'not', 'prepare', 'body', 'sufficiently', 'extensions', 'compressions', 'advanced', 'postures', 'follow', 'instruction', 'excrutiating', 'detail', 'not', 'enough', 'information', 'have', 'break', 'concentration', 'look', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'course', 'single', 'series', 'poses', 'Very', 'frustrating', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'instructor', 'amazing', 'flexibility', 'only', 'inspiring', 'aspect', 'tape', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'spare', 'studio', 'setting', 'students', 'make', 'fun', 'experience']",N/A

314961,A1RXOMZTOSAP1O,6302481872,Mary Bryant,"[2, 2]","Watching Patricia Walden in the amazing introduction gave me goosebumps.  I was a little scared that she was going to make me try it with her.  This was a gift to me from a friend.  I was very hesitant to even try Yoga, because of my Christian background.  My friend sent two DVDs on Yoga to me because of my horrible battle with degenerative arthritis.  She said that it would help, and it has.I found that Patricia Walden was very pleasant.  The sessions were not easy.  The fact that I have been working out for many years made it a little easier for me, but I still had a week of very sore muscles.  I thought I was flexible, until I saw Patricia.  The advise I give anyone who is new to working out is that you need to respect and honor your limitations.  I love to feel the sensation of going a little past my comfort zone, but I never will be able to do every move exactly like Patricia.  I cannot put my bottom on my feet.  My knee joint is not good, but I adjust my poses to honor my body.  (Brian Krest said it this way, ""There is no perfect pose.  Just find a place of sensation and hang out with it"".  I personally have an easier time with the backbend session than the forward bend session.  I found out that my hamstrings and hip flexors are tight.This is a really good DVD. I don't use it as often as some of the newer ones, but I still do like it.  It never makes me feel uncomfortable as far as my Christian convictions go.",5,My first Yoga DVD,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,1440,"['Watching', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'amazing', 'introduction', 'gave', 'goosebumps', 'was', 'little', 'scared', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'try', 'was', 'gift', 'friend', 'was', 'very', 'hesitant', 'even', 'try', 'Yoga', 'Christian', 'background', 'friend', 'sent', 'two', 'DVDs', 'Yoga', 'horrible', 'battle', 'degenerative', 'arthritis', 'said', 'would', 'help', 'found', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'sessions', 'were', 'not', 'easy', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'many', 'years', 'made', 'little', 'easier', 'still', 'had', 'week', 'very', 'sore', 'muscles', 'thought', 'was', 'flexible', 'saw', 'Patricia', 'advise', 'give', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'working', 'out', 'need', 'respect', 'honor', 'limitations', 'love', 'feel', 'sensation', 'going', 'little', 'past', 'comfort', 'zone', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'move', 'exactly', 'Patricia', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'bottom', 'feet', 'knee', 'joint', 'not', 'good', 'adjust', 'poses', 'honor', 'body', 'Brian', 'Krest', 'said', 'way', 'perfect', 'pose', 'Just', 'find', 'place', 'sensation', 'hang', 'out', 'personally', 'have', 'easier', 'time', 'backbend', 'session', 'forward', 'bend', 'session', 'found', 'out', 'hamstrings', 'hip', 'flexors', 'are', 'tight.This', 'really', 'good', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'as', 'often', 'newer', 'ones', 'still', 'do', 'never', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'as', 'far', 'Christian', 'convictions', 'go']",N/A

Her form, style, flow, cueing, everything is just spot on. i purchased this dvd thinking that my beginning practice could use a step up as far as flexibility was concerned. Well although Patricia makes it look easy, and she provides suggestions for modifications and props, I suggest you start a little slowly with this one. It's a good dvd if you're looking for flexibility, but you really need to know a little about what you're doing to really follow her. I suggest that you keep on with your Rodney Yee, or whom ever you're doing, and just add this in a little at a time.
