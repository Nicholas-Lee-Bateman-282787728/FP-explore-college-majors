Those tend to be feel-good movies. This is not a feel-good movie. While the main characters are somewhat likable, they are not terribly interesting and the movie is not a feel-good affair. The main character loses his girlfriend over some forgettable incident and somehow takes an interest in a somewhat introverted girl. She starts out seeming like a studious and serious girl, but the guy who is drinking or drunk in every scene quickly converts her into a drunk. together they have some inexplicable and forgettable experiences before graduating from high school. While the final scene seems to suggest that the guy gets his act together a bit and goes off in search of the girl at college, there really isn't much to grab on to. Somehow, for me it doesn't seem realistic or enthralling to think that an underage high school student would have beer or a flask of booze on him 24-7, be drunk pretty much 24-7 and not get arrested, killed in an accident or end up in some other catastrophe.

He is effortlessly charming, but carries that ineffable pain behind his eyes.

1643265,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00C7BZYRO,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Teen angst films are not all that uncommon.  In fact, there are so many of them you start to lose count of just how many are gracing the screen at any given moment, or how many you&#8217;ve never heard of are going &#8216;direct to video&#8217; or appearing on Lifetime.  Adolescence is a rough time in almost everyone&#8217;s life, but it is also the most crucial because it shapes you, starts to define you, and in many instances can ruin you.  It is rare that a film can capture all of these things without beating you over the head with self-indulgent &#8216;importance&#8217; and so it can become a chore to wade through the murky waters of teen angst films to discover the few (and far in-between) that actually manage to say something without saying EVERYTHING.When I saw the trailer for &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; and then read some comments from people anticipating the film, I got slightly nervous.  There is some weighty material here, and combining alcoholism and teen abandonment, terrible fathers and overworked mothers and &#8216;new love&#8217; and &#8216;damaged love&#8217; and all that goes with it into one film and then trying to look like a quirky indie romantic comedy just felt like something that was going to fail, miserably.Thankfully, &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; doesn&#8217;t.Telling the story of Sutter Keely, &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; opens with Sutter working on an assignment where he is supposed to describe a life changing moment.  So, he starts by telling about his breakup with Cassidy.  As he&#8217;s telling the story another issue becomes very clear; Sutter is an alcoholic.  He doesn&#8217;t take anything seriously, he lives for the party, he&#8217;s reckless and he can&#8217;t put down the bottle.  Booze makes everything better.  His home life is nearly non-existent.  His mother works hard but provides no real guidance outside of a quip here or there, and he doesn&#8217;t know where his father is and hasn&#8217;t spoken to him for years.Then he meets Aimee.In everyone&#8217;s life there is that special someone how helps you become a better person, not because of what they say to you or what do to you but mostly because of what they don&#8217;t say and don&#8217;t do.  For Sutter, that person is Aimee.For me, &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; lives and dies in the same breath, and so it makes it hard for me to really form a review or critique that sounds focused, since I admire and yet nitpick at the same quality.The film is so laid back.Like I said, I initially was skeptical.  How can a film that covers so many weighty moments be this quirky love story, and yet it is.  It has this mellow balance of tone that feels so effortless and natural.  You can&#8217;t help but fall in love with Amy and Sutter and feel this bond grow and this natural progression of character that is so fluid and likable.  The dramatics and theatrics and &#8216;heaviness&#8217; that could have been associated with themes such as alcoholism and broken dreams just don&#8217;t take root here, and so &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; establishes an easy atmosphere that is agreeable.  Despite Sutter&#8217;s alcoholism, it never becomes a hard-nosed focal point.  We aren&#8217;t force fed these stereotypical &#8216;drinking will ruin you&#8217;, &#8216;Sutter is wasting his life&#8217;, &#8216;REMOVE THE BOOZE FROM HIS HANDS&#8217; statements, and even Aimee, this beacon of light, doesn&#8217;t give Sutter this life changing speech.  She falls into his trap.  She takes up drinking and never once berates him for his obvious habit.  She&#8217;s blinded by love.  That is why her relationship with Sutter is so important and so meaningful, because she changes him not by her pleading for him to change but by accepting him and loving him and needing him.But with all this praise for this beautiful directorial decision, the lack of any real emotional drama makes &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; almost too easy.  It doesn&#8217;t stick.  It&#8217;s a delight to watch, and it swells in all the right places while you are watching it, but once it is over, it&#8217;s over and that is that.  You don&#8217;t recall it in the same way that you recall similar films.  I thought of &#8216;(500) Days of Summer&#8217; a lot while watching this, that easy vibe and effortless quality, and yet that film balanced out the ease with a real memorable quality.  It made a bigger impact.&#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217; just kind of fades from memory.I liked this, and it was a great showcase for young talents (Teller and Woodley are wonderful here) and it was nice to see Kyle Chandler make a real impact this year (his brief scene colors in so much backstory), but at the end of the day &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217;

1643280,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00C7BZYRO,Darren,"[0, 0]","[This review is for those who've seen the film already, so proceed with caution]What a surprise -- a movie about real teenagers.Not sure if it works as well without the talented young lead actors, Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley.  Of course, &#34;Divergent&#34; has apparently made both of them stars, especially Ms. Woodley.  I've not seen that film, but I doubt their work there is better than what they do here, which, in certain moments like before they make love for the first time, is painfully real.  Brings back so many memories for this aging bad boy who had his fair share of romances with nice girls.  The writers and director -- all male, basing their work on a novel by a male writer -- decided to go for total honesty, dredging up memories of their assorted first loves.  The realism thus engendered in the dialogue helps the young actors along, who speak their lines as if they're the first things out of their mouths rather than words from a script.  All in all, the movie captures the intense joy and pain of adolescent romance without resorting to overhyped dramatic situations.Teller plays Sutter, a popular high school senior who is, in a rather unlikely manner, generous in his popularity, open to all friendships, including ones with hot girls, lanky nerds, and ponytailed ingenues like Woodley.  He doesn't even resent the young man who steals his first girlfriend -- in fact, Teller gives the guy some sound love-life advice, because, you know, bros.  As I said, the performances, rather than the characters per se, make this believable.  While Teller's character is clearly a novelist's construct, Woodley's &#34;Aimee&#34; surprisingly comes across as the more genuine character.  She is just emerging from the chrysalis of childhood, trembling around all over the place like a newborn colt, and, quite inevitably, falling hard for the first guy who speaks to her in a friendly way.  The fascination with the &#34;awesome&#34; manga super-heroines and such falls by the wayside as soon as Teller introduces her to his flask and gives her her first kiss.  Before long, she drapes herself around her beau like ivy, making plans for the future that include shacking up in Philadelphia while she matriculates.  (&#34;Sounds great,&#34; Teller says uncertainly.)  Woodley delivers a touching performance; I'm predicting major stardom that will go beyond the current cinematic adaptation of the latest YA dystopian fiction.But this is Teller's show.  He conveys to perfection an easy-going youth on the surface who is meanwhile seething with self-doubt, resentment over a missing father, and an underlying sense of doom.  He bops around the high school campus and his job selling menswear carrying a flask in his pocket and his convenience-store cups of spiked soda always in-hand, and we can't help but worry about him. (It helps that Teller seems like such a likable kid.)  Certain young people start anesthetizing themselves from the pain of life with a constant supply of booze even before they've lived long enough to become proper alcoholics, and other young people take it upon themselves to try to save these budding alcoholics by offering the steadiness and responsibility of a sexual relationship.  (It's usually the females who try to do the saving, but sometimes it's the other way around.)  And, as in all codependent relationships, each partner is getting something from the other: in his case, a nonjudgmental lover who adores him, and in her case, some &#34;boyfriend experience&#34; to be stored up for more mature encounters later in life.  And indeed -- remember, I warned about spoilers -- the last shot of the film shows us a young woman who has moved quite beyond Teller after just a few short months of separation, regardless of whether or not Teller has matured or quit drinking.  The guarded smile by Woodley is masterful.  I wonder if this ending is actually preferable to the book's ending, which apparently has Sutter drunk in a bar congratulating himself on setting his girlfriend free because he wasn't good enough for her.  The screenwriters set up a happy ending as a possible alternative, only to make it even more complicated and, in my view, far better than what novelist Tim Tharp came up with.4 stars out of 5.  The fifth star is withheld because the story veers dangerously close to Nicholas Sparks territory (cf. &#34;A Walk to Remember&#34;) and because the writers have Teller say unrealistic, screenwriterish things to teachers and employers.  But, still, this one is definitely a cut above.",4,The real thing,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,4555,"['[', 'review', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'already', 'proceed', 'caution', ']', 'What', 'surprise', 'movie', 'real', 'teenagers.Not', 'sure', 'as', 'well', 'talented', 'young', 'lead', 'actors', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'course', '34', 'Divergent', '34', 'apparently', 'made', 'stars', 'especially', 'Ms.', 'Woodley', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'doubt', 'work', 'better', 'what', 'do', 'here', 'certain', 'moments', 'make', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'painfully', 'real', 'Brings', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'aging', 'bad', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'romances', 'nice', 'girls', 'writers', 'director', 'male', 'basing', 'work', 'novel', 'male', 'writer', 'decided', 'go', 'total', 'honesty', 'dredging', 'up', 'memories', 'assorted', 'first', 'loves', 'realism', 'thus', 'engendered', 'dialogue', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'speak', 'lines', ""'re"", 'first', 'things', 'mouths', 'rather', 'words', 'script', 'movie', 'intense', 'joy', 'pain', 'adolescent', 'romance', 'resorting', 'overhyped', 'dramatic', 'situations.Teller', 'plays', 'Sutter', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'rather', 'unlikely', 'manner', 'generous', 'popularity', 'open', 'friendships', 'including', 'ones', 'hot', 'girls', 'lanky', 'nerds', 'ponytailed', 'ingenues', 'Woodley', ""n't"", 'even', 'resent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'girlfriend', 'fact', 'Teller', 'guy', 'sound', 'love-life', 'advice', 'know', 'bros.', 'said', 'performances', 'rather', 'characters', 'se', 'make', 'believable', 'Teller', 'character', 'clearly', 'novelist', 'construct', 'Woodley', '34', 'Aimee', '34', 'surprisingly', 'more', 'genuine', 'character', 'just', 'emerging', 'chrysalis', 'childhood', 'trembling', 'place', 'newborn', 'colt', 'quite', 'inevitably', 'falling', 'hard', 'first', 'guy', 'who', 'friendly', 'way', 'fascination', '34', 'awesome', '34', 'manga', 'super-heroines', 'such', 'falls', 'wayside', 'as', 'soon', 'Teller', 'flask', 'first', 'kiss', 'long', 'beau', 'ivy', 'making', 'plans', 'future', 'include', 'shacking', 'up', 'Philadelphia', '34', 'Sounds', 'great', '34', 'Teller', 'uncertainly', 'Woodley', 'touching', 'performance', ""'m"", 'predicting', 'major', 'stardom', 'will', 'go', 'current', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'latest', 'YA', 'dystopian', 'fiction.But', 'Teller', 'show', 'perfection', 'easy-going', 'youth', 'surface', 'who', 'meanwhile', 'seething', 'self-doubt', 'resentment', 'missing', 'father', 'underlying', 'sense', 'doom', 'high', 'school', 'campus', 'job', 'selling', 'menswear', 'carrying', 'flask', 'pocket', 'convenience-store', 'cups', 'spiked', 'soda', 'always', 'in-hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'worry', 'Teller', 'likable', 'kid', 'Certain', 'young', 'people', 'start', 'anesthetizing', 'pain', 'life', 'constant', 'supply', 'booze', 'even', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'become', 'proper', 'alcoholics', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'take', 'try', 'save', 'budding', 'alcoholics', 'offering', 'steadiness', 'responsibility', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'usually', 'females', 'who', 'try', 'do', 'saving', 'other', 'way', 'codependent', 'relationships', 'partner', 'getting', 'something', 'other', 'case', 'nonjudgmental', 'lover', 'who', 'case', '34', 'boyfriend', 'experience', '34', 'be', 'stored', 'up', 'more', 'mature', 'encounters', 'later', 'life', 'indeed', 'remember', 'warned', 'spoilers', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'moved', 'quite', 'Teller', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'separation', 'regardless', 'not', 'Teller', 'matured', 'quit', 'drinking', 'guarded', 'smile', 'Woodley', 'masterful', 'wonder', 'ending', 'actually', 'preferable', 'book', 'ending', 'apparently', 'Sutter', 'drunk', 'bar', 'congratulating', 'setting', 'girlfriend', 'free', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'screenwriters', 'set', 'up', 'happy', 'ending', 'possible', 'alternative', 'only', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'view', 'far', 'better', 'what', 'novelist', 'Tim', 'Tharp', 'came', 'up', 'with.4', 'stars', '5', 'fifth', 'star', 'withheld', 'story', 'veers', 'dangerously', 'close', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'territory', 'cf', '34', 'Walk', 'Remember', '34', 'writers', 'have', 'Teller', 'say', 'unrealistic', 'screenwriterish', 'things', 'teachers', 'employers', 'still', 'one', 'definitely', 'cut']",The Spectacular Now

1643296,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00C7BZYRO,FNDNreview,"[2, 5]","Directed by James Ponsoldt (Smashed), The Spectacular Now stars Miles Teller as Sutter Keely, a popular high school student that recently broke up with his girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson).  After a night of drinking, Sutter blacks out and eventually wakes up on the front lawn of a schoolmate's house, Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley).  Through sheer coincidence, he enjoys Aimee's company and enlists her help with his flailing school work.  However, Sutter is still dealing with his feelings for his former girlfriend, even though he continues to fall for and spend time with Aimee.  While his classmates are getting into college, Sutter struggles with his fears of the future as he works at his job, blows off vital schoolwork, and constantly drinks - so much so that he starts to question his choices and place in the world.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kyle Chandler, and Jennifer Jason Leigh also star in supporting roles.The Spectacular Now, based on the novel of the same name (written by Tim Tharp), is perfectly described by its title - spectacular.  There are very few coming-of-age films that focus on the serious tone of teen adolescence, young love, and dealing with difficult choices in regards to the future.  This particular story clearly has its finger directly on the pulse of the new generation and is full of smart, quick-witted dialogue.  The tale of Sutter Keely follows a true, honest course, sending the film in an emotionally fulfilling and sincere direction, which is a direction most generic young adult films completely avoid.  Naturally, there have been recent teen flicks that carry a heavy tone, but The Spectacular Now just does it better, having a similar feel films, like The Breakfast Club or The Perks of Being a Wallflower.In the majority of teen films these days, filmmakers are usually so focused on partying, sex, and comic relief (ex. American Pie, Project X, The To Do List, etc.) that they never bother to add any heart to their stories.  Initially, The Spectacular Now's story appears to be focused on teens falling in love, but it quickly becomes evident that the message of this film is so much stronger than a clich&eacute;d, one-dimension love story.  Teens are usually depicted as casual, happy-go-lucky kids that can expect to get the girl/boy, ignore consequences, and just wait for a happy ending.  However, this film portrays teens in a serious light, focusing on how one single person has the ability to impact or change another person's life.  Better yet, it spotlights the real life choices young people are forced to make and how these choices can have dire consequences.Miles Teller, a young actor known for playing the role of the typical teen party animal (as seen in his roles in Project X and 21 & Over), really steps into this dramatic role quite nicely.  Compared to his previous roles, it was a bit of a stretch for him to pull off this emotionally uncertain, borderline alcoholic character.  Teller's charisma is truly intoxicating and mesmerizing, giving him endless potential for future roles and making him easily comparable to well-known actor Shia LaBeouf.  Teller's co-star, Shailene Woodley, is also a relatively unfamiliar face to the big screen - most well-known for her role in The Descendants or possibly even for being cast as Mary Jane Watson in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (only to be cut from the film after she finished filming her scenes).  Regardless, she's a rising star and it's very evident in her role as Aimee Finecky.  Even though Woodley is not as charismatic as Teller, she still provides a handful of screen-stealing scenes - most notably of which comes during a heated exchange in a car with co-star Teller.  As far as the rest of the cast goes - it's impossible not to mention Kyle Chandler's appearance as a deadbeat dad, which is ironic since it's the complete opposite of the character he previously played for five seasons on TV's Friday Night Lights.Overall, The Spectacular Now features a plot and cast that exudes potential and excitement. There's no denying the sheer genius in the film's writing and direction - indicating director James Ponsoldt might also have a potentially fruitful career on the horizon.  This film deals with relatable themes involving the difficulties teens face while balancing the stresses of school, relationships, and family life.  Even more notable is the underlying theme depicting the possibly devastating effect alcohol can have on self-esteem and the decision-making process.  And, while teen films typically end in the same predictable manner, this story stays true to its roots, creating a purely pragmatic story from beginning to end.  It might not have the most desirable ending, but it is the most logical ending.  Collectively, this coming-of-age drama is an absolute breath of fresh air and is highly recommended.GRADE:  AFNDNreview.com",5,'The Spectacular Now' a prefect coming-of-age teen drama,1377734400,"08

Often many films don't even scratch the root level of their own theory and work on sheer amusement and drama purposes. To add to that ragatag they go ahead and introduce a catchy soundtrack. But seldom are they confident enough to express a determination to grab the full five stars.THIS IS WHERE &#34;Spectacular Now&#34; shines. The protagonist isn't your run of the mill jock.

I was afraid it was going to be non-stop talking heads. We join a blabbermouth young man who is clearly a sociopath, finds all the right words, charms all in his path and serves his own needs, all the while taking liberal sips from his ever-present whiskey flask. We soon realize he is experiencing black-out drunks, so we start to worry. Eek!When Director James Ponsoldt crafts a second-act meeting with the young man's long-absent father, things start to gain traction.We watch:* Miles Teller (""Footloose"" 2011) is our hard-partying hero, never at a loss for words, impervious to insults and indifferent to school. This charming character is a far cry from his pathetic lost boy in ""Rabbit Hole."" Good for Teller!* Shailene Woodley (""The Descendants"") is the awkward misfit who is unexpectedly targeted by our hero. It starts as a lark, but once he gets to know her...* Jennifer Jason Leigh (""Revenge"") is our hero's mother, distracted by her responsibilities and reluctant to mar his happy memories of his father.* Kyle Chandler (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is that absent father, whom he tracks down so they can reminisce about his happy childhood.Several things were said that I appreciated: a Geometry teacher says, ""If a student fails, the teacher fails."" A classmate meets with him and as he leaves he turns and says, ""You're not the joke everyone thinks!"" A friend says he needs ""someone to yank you out of neutral!""This is notable for several extremely long scenes between the two young stars. Very few older actors can sustain scenes this long.

1643312,A3697UKT5TIN04,B00C7BZYRO,"John ""pianoman""","[0, 1]","The Spectacular Now is based on Tim Tharp's novel. The story revolves around high school senior Sutter Keely trying to convince himself that to just live in the moment and not worry about the future is the path that he should take in life. Always with a drink in his hand, Sutter is quite content with just passing by. The story of the novel, or should I say the setup, is virtually the same in the movie. However, as the movie got underway and the first thirty minutes seemed to just fly by, I began to notice how much I really liked this movie. It seemed easy, and the relationship between Sutter and Aimee seemed real and spot on. The movie also presented Sutter in a more toned down manner than in the book, which I found all for the better. My one beef with the book was its portrayal of Sutter to be quite honest. At times he was utterly unlikable; so unlikable that I put down the book, not wanting to pick it up again. While the movie still keeps the general tone of Sutter, he is more likable, and a little more easy to care about. The film also leaves out a few scenes that the book really spent some time on, but in the whole grand scheme of things, they were pretty much unimportant to the central plot. The ending of the movie is generally different from the book, and once again I felt that the movie improved upon the book. Without giving anything away, the book left me a bit cold and wanting for more, but the film's ending was both heartwarming and gave the story closure. After a story such as this, closure is what it really needs. Very rarely does a movie ever surpass the novel (I think Holes might be the only example), but The Spectacular Now improves upon the novel, fleshing out the themes, improving the character, and closing the story off with sentiment and charm.

I watched The Spectacular Now with anticipation but the movie moved in a different rhythm than I expected.

1643314,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00C7BZYRO,J. Richardson,"[3, 5]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Coming-of-age films are constantly being pumped out year after year, but few of them leave any real emotional impact on the viewer they try so hard to impress. The mere act of watching someone mentally grow is rarely enough to satisfy the needs of the audience, which is why The Spectacular Now surprises in the best way possible. There is no predictability, and it&#8217;s almost impossible to guess where the story is heading. These characters and their problems are not larger-than-life, but rather grounded, relatable, and realistic. As a result, there is an unusual intensity that fuels every passing second, and what we are left with is a film that truly is spectacular.Meet Sutter Keely (Miles Teller), a high school senior who has been a part of everyone&#8217;s high school career. Everyone knows a Sutter in real life, and this enables the audience to connect with him almost instantly. On the surface, Sutter is an alcohol-obsessed party animal with no plans for his future. Why worry about the future when you should be living in the now, right? Upon meeting the quiet and reserved Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley) after a hard night of partying, Sutter forms a bond with her, but informs his friend that he&#8217;s only doing this to help her out. What he doesn&#8217;t know, however, is that he can use her help just as much as she could use his, and this is when Sutter finally gets a grip on the reality surrounding him.Contrary to popular belief, teenagers are actually very complex members of society, and everything they do is the result of some unrelated event that happened earlier in life. This is very easy to forget due to the parties, casual sex, and constant relationship problems, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less true. The Spectacular Now is a film that explores this reality, and it does so with a great deal of confidence, heart, and understanding. There is never any judgement, and the writers make it a point to explore this territory carefully, which results in one of the most honest and authentic representations of the teenage student. These are fictional characters who appear very real on screen due to their believable personal issues, and I found myself surprised at how much I began to care for them.The film&#8217;s narrative progresses at a very natural pace, and even though the audience only sees the big events in their relationship, there is no denying how comfortable everything feels. The characters and the world they inhabit are so familiar that the finer details need no explanation. The viewer understands simply from experience, and this in and of itself is an extraordinary accomplishment. Looking back on past teenage dramas, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve ever experienced anything quite like this, but it was truly remarkable. I chuckled when Sutter told a joke, I felt sad when there was obvious emotional pain, and worried when someone got physically injured. Film&#8217;s rarely pull me into their world like this, but I was there, and I didn&#8217;t want to leave.However, there were a few story elements that were extremely annoying due to how unbelievable they felt in such a realistic setting. One of Sutter&#8217;s more undesirable traits is his clear addiction to alcohol. If he had a drink in his hand, it was probably an alcoholic beverage, and it didn&#8217;t matter if he was at a party, at work, or somewhere else entirely. This obvious alcoholism gets explained later on, but here was my issue: he would have reeked. Consuming that much alcohol on a consistent basis would leave the body smelling terrible, and you&#8217;re trying to tell me none of his teachers said anything? Better yet, he consumed that much alcohol and was still able to properly operate his car? I don&#8217;t buy it.Furthermore, Aimee is supposed to be this good, straight-laced girl, but she gives in almost instantly when Sutter offers her a drink from his flask. She gave the usual, &#8220;That&#8217;s disgusting&#8221; remark, but two seconds later she was drinking like a pro, and doing so on a daily basis for the remainder of the film. To be fair, it was only a small amount here and there, but still. I also had a hard time believing that a character like Aimee would be completely fine with Sutter&#8217;s drinking and driving, especially with her in the car. She had her own personal issues, sure, but she was a good student who didn&#8217;t have a death wish. As previously stated, these were only annoying because of how realistic everything else felt in comparison.These minor issues aside, The Spectacular Now is blessed not only in its script, but also in its cast. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley performed wonderfully as Sutter and Aimee, and their chemistry was both genuine and immensely satisfying. Shailene has come a long way since Amy on Secret Life, and her performance as Aimee really shows her potential as an actress. Teller surprised me the most, though. What I expected to be a flat, predictable performance turned out to be an emotional roller coaster, and Teller pulled out all the stops. There were also some small, yet memorable performances from Brie Larson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Bob Odenkirk. Although neither had a massive amount of screen-time, they still fit in perfectly with the overall tone of the film.Overall Score: 8.7/10 - The Spectacular Now essentially tells the story of what it&#8217;s like to be a teenager, but how it executes this task is unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen before. The writers created a world that was both beautiful and relatable, and the storytelling manages to pull you in and keep you there until the credits begin to role. There were some small flaws in the characters and the world that surrounds them, but these errors are easily forgivable due to the emotional impact left by the film&#8217;s final arc. This is one I definitely recommend you check out.",4,8.7/10 - Beautiful film with some minor flaws.,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,5943,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed',

1643316,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00C7BZYRO,judy,"[0, 0]","Ok, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't anticipating this film, because I was for at least a year sense I read the plotline, it seemed sweet, but I never came around to viewing it until it most recently hit DVD, so here I am January 21st watching The Spectacular Now, finally. After reading reviews I was sold, I was all like 'Shailene Woodley' and 'Miles Teller' are in the same movie together, this could be great. Was I right? Was it great? Well it's time to find out whether or not this film was spectacular or not. Now for this spectacular review (The jokes just keep coming) of 'The Spectacular Now'.'The Spectacular Now' follows stud Sutter Keely (Played by Miles Teller) a cool, popular, social, party dude who follows the motto of living in the now. Failing at school Stutter winds up meeting Aimee Finecky (Played by Shailene Woodley) a sweet, smart, sensitive girl who believes in planning for the future. Sutter begins to hang out with her, they both begin to help each other and form a tight bond, and eventually Sutter begins to fall in love with her.When you get down to it the plot is very simple. While it overall works, I just feel it's a bit too simple, too unoriginal. Not much is brought to the table, plot wise. When I watched this I never felt surprised at the twists as I knew I'd seen it before, nothing really jumped at me as un-expected. But you see, it was how they forwarded the plot that overall made it worth watching, and new. The situations all seem very real, and the plot somehow manages to use that to help twist something new together, ad overall it helps make this seem like something new.Now the casting is what makes 'The Spectacular Now' spectacular. Instead of giving us glamorous, beautiful, spotless, squeaky clean people we get a cast of teenagers that (honest to god) look like real teenagers that you might see in real high schools. We don't watch any Marilyn Monroe on screen or Zac Efron's. We get real looking teenagers, that look, and talk, and feel like teenagers. Excellent is the casting of the two young leads, 'Miles Teller' and 'Shailene Woodley' both of whom are up-and-coming stars of the future. Both of them, even with their 20+ age give off perfectly realistic performances as two awkward teenagers just trying to find their way in life. 'Miles Teller' gives us a very emotional performance as a boy wounded by his lack of a father-figure, and just downright not good parenting. I really feel that 'Miles Teller' can lead a film, he's impressed before with his solid supporting work, but now he's shown he can lead a film by himself, and carry the weight of giving the audience someone to look forward to seeing, to root for, or to feel for in this film's case, and I'm just glad they saw that and cast him. 'Shailene Woodley' has always impressed me. She can play an innocent, nice character who you feel sad for, if that character gets her feelings heart or something. You love her, always; she just can play an awkward, yet kind and compassionate character, as she does here. Shailene (as always) I tip my hat to you, you are indeed spectacular, and your casting was an excellent choice. I also feel that Miles and Shailene had great chemistry with each other, and made for a realistic and sweet couple. And with our supporting cast we get solid performances from 'Brie Larson' who plays the hot girl, who is very pretty, but doesn't come off as a too hot to be in high school type character as usually happens in these kind of movies, she is pretty but not freaking 'Beverly Hills'. 'Kyle Chandler' also gives nice performance as Stutter's drinking dad in a small, cameo like appearance.The script is actually not too deep as I would have liked it to be. What I mean is, I would have loved for it to have explored more of Aimee and Stutter's every growing relationship. I feel it was a bit underdone, and wish there would have been more story there, as well as with Stutter's father. I wish Stutter got to better know him, and for his father to develop better senses in the way of getting to know his child, and who his child is. But while the script isn't as dark as I wished it was, the dialogue is actually pretty solid. I loved the dialogue it was witty, and sounded pretty much like something teenagers would say without all the annoying uses of the word like.The character development both works and doesn't. While I feel Stutter developed rather nicely and solidly throughout the whole film, I feel like every other character never really progressed like Stutter did. The script usually forgets the supporting characters as to spend more time with the main one, and while it works to develop his character nicely, everyone else comes off as just there. Aimee somewhat gets some development but not as much as you'd definitely feel she needed. And as for the rest of them, well they're all for supporting and not developing farther beyond their types.The direction from 'James Ponsoldt' is really solid. The film walks down the right path every time and never starts down the exact opposite way, 'James Ponsoldt' directs his cast and crew with ease even if he hasn't had as much experience as he should have.The music is spot on, it engages you and really emotionally tunes every scene that plays in the film, either nice, or sad, and I doubt 20 years from now it will sound dated, I really do.The editing is sharp, with every shot coming along smoothly and professionally, and in the end it all flows perfect.All an All 'The Spectacular Now' is spectacular even if I feel it's not anything you'd never seen before, but with the help of an amazing cast, and a very solid, likeable central character, the film ends up leaving a mark on you, in a good way and it will overall be the original film you wanted to watch, even if it isn't, it is. B+ 1/21/14P.S: To end this review, I'd just love to wish my father a very happy 50th birthday. His life has been spectacular so far, and now he's lived half a century, while I'm writing this in advance, by the time this is released it'll be his birthday, so Happy Birthday Dad! To another 50 years of good health!",4,Spectaculer to say the least,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,6122,"['Ok', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'anticipating', 'film', 'was', 'least',

1643328,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B00C7BZYRO,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[0, 1]","I have mixed emotions on this film. A part of me loves it. The other part of me doesn't quite know what to think. The movie takes you into the life of Sutter, a bit of a self-proclaimed womanizer and widely known as the school's &#34;life of any underage party&#34;. After a recent break-up, he finds himself oddly attracted to Aimee; a shy and not necessarily popular girl at his school. Sutter's entire life he's been made out as a bit of a bad boy. He's been demeaned and praised for his not-so-great behavior. And in walks Aimee. Who is essentially the complete opposite. A motivated young lady with life dreams and a yearning to do good in the world. And so the story begins.Starting off, the first thing you'll notice about this film is that the characters are not 'primped'. They're natural. Every single one of the actors was left untouched by make-up or hair stylists. They're appearances mimicked those of true teens experiencing high school across small-town America. Sutter, the main character, was not made up to be an extremely attractive super-fit guy. Aimee wasn't the over-beautified good girl. Both were left in their natural state. It was... it was really awesome. So many films choose to portray every single character as &#34;Hollywood attractive&#34;. It was so refreshing to see people who just appeared normal. And by being normal, they became even more attractive than the overdone Hollywood types.The story takes you on a bit of a roller coaster. It honestly portrays every aspect of young love- in a way that is so awe-inspiringly real that I felt as though I was watching a documentary rather than a fiction film. The script was immaculate. The actors were extremely talented and fit their characters perfectly. Every single aspect of the dialogue clicked in this film. It felt so real, that during a sex scene (that typically I'm very nonchalant about) I felt a bit awkward about. I felt as though I was watching two real-life teenagers experiencing a first time. It was almost hard to watch. But that just shows how truly real I connected to the actors. They did their parts so well, that I actually believed they were real while watching the film. I've rarely felt that with other films.If I were to judge this film on pure accuracy of teen romance- I would give it 5 stars hands down. If I were to judge this film on the acting- 5 stars for every single name on the credits. If I were to judge this film on uniqueness- 5 stars. So why isn't my rating 5 stars?There was nothing that really connected me to this film. I'm 22- I'm guessing around the targeted demographic? I don't think this movie is appropriate for anyone under 15. There is a lot of adult-themes in the film including alcohol and an almost constant use of curse words. In all honesty- the script was done that way because it's how teens talk. But that doesn't make it any more appropriate for younger teens. I would not recommend this one to parents of teens. BUT, for me, at 22- I could watch the film in a way that took me back to high school. I got it all. I knew it all. It was literally like going back in time for me. But there was nothing I could honestly stick to. I can't find a reason to root for this storyline. It's beautiful in it's own unique way- but I myself couldn't connect to it. Perhaps it's because my first love came after I graduated. Or perhaps it's because I was the Aimee who never got a guy. Or perhaps it was because I come from a fairly stable family- and neither of these characters did. Nevertheless, I just couldn't connect and I think that really prohibited me from enjoying the film. I think a lot of people out there will be able to really see this film for it's honesty and appreciate it for what it is. I'm just not sure I'm the right audience to appreciate it's beauty. It was an entertaining film that was EXTREMELY well done. But I just didn't feel that connection to it that's going to make it one I want to watch again. For me, it wasn't memorable. I can't begin to stress how amazing the performances were. By far some of the best I've ever seen. And I wish I could bring myself to rate it 5 stars for that reason. But because of the fact I just couldn't quite grasp the film, I have to rate it 4. With that being said I think others, who can in some way relate to the characters- will find this a 5 star movie. And I recommend everyone glancing through the reviews watch it. It's definitely worth a view.",4,"Extremely Well-Acted, But I Couldn't ""Connect"" To The Storyline",1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,4446,"['have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'film', 'part', 'other', 'part', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'life', 'Sutter', 'bit', 'self-proclaimed', 'womanizer', 'widely', 'known', 'school', '34', 'life', 'underage', 'party', '34', 'recent', 'break-up', 'oddly', 'attracted', 'Aimee', 'shy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Sutter', 'entire', 'life', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'bit', 'bad', 'boy', 'been', 'demeaned', 'praised', 'not-so-great', 'behavior', 'walks', 'Aimee', 'Who', 'essentially', 'complete', 'opposite', 'A', 'motivated', 'young', 'lady', 'life', 'dreams', 'yearning', 'do', 'good', 'world', 'so', 'story', 'begins.Starting', 'off', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'not', ""'primped"", ""'re"", 'natural', 'single', 'one', 'actors', 'was', 'left', 'untouched', 'make-up', 'hair', 'stylists', ""'re"", 'appearances', 'mimicked', 'true', 'teens', 'experiencing', 'high', 'school', 'small-town', 'America', 'Sutter', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'up', 'be', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'super-fit', 'guy', 'Aimee', 'was', ""n't"", 'over-beautified', 'good', 'girl', 'were', 'left', 'natural', 'state', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'awesome', 'So', 'many', 'films', 'choose', 'portray', 'single', 'character', '34', 'Hollywood', 'attractive', '34', 'was', 'so', 'refreshing', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'appeared', 'normal', 'being', 'normal', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'attractive', 'overdone', 'Hollywood', 'types.The', 'story', 'bit', 'roller', 'coaster', 'honestly', 'aspect', 'young', 'love-', 'way', 'so', 'awe-inspiringly', 'real', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'rather', 'fiction', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'immaculate', 'actors', 'were', 'extremely', 'talented', 'fit', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'Every', 'single', 'aspect', 'dialogue', 'clicked', 'film', 'felt', 'so', 'real', 'sex', 'scene', 'typically', ""'m"", 'very', 'nonchalant', 'felt', 'bit', 'awkward', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'real-life', 'teenagers', 'experiencing', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'almost', 'hard', 'watch', 'just', 'how', 'truly', 'real', 'connected', 'actors', 'did', 'parts', 'so', 'well', 'actually', 'believed', 'were', 'real', 'watching', 'film', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'felt', 'other', 'films.If', 'were', 'judge', 'film', 'pure', 'accuracy', 'teen', 'romance-', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'down', 'were', 'judge', 'film', 'acting-', '5', 'stars', 'single', 'name', 'credits', 'were', 'judge', 'film', 'uniqueness-', '5', 'stars', 'So', 'why', ""n't"", 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'nothing', 'really', 'connected', 'film', ""'m"", '22-', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'targeted', 'demographic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'anyone', '15', 'lot', 'adult-themes', 'film', 'including', 'alcohol', 'almost', 'constant', 'use', 'curse', 'words', 'honesty-', 'script', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'how', 'teens', 'talk', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'teens', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'one', 'parents', 'teens', 'BUT', '22-', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'way', 'took', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'got', 'knew', 'was', 'literally', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'honestly', 'stick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'reason', 'root', 'storyline', 'beautiful', 'own', 'unique', 'way-', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'love', 'came', 'graduated', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Aimee', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'guy', 'perhaps', 'was', 'come', 'fairly', 'stable', 'family-', 'characters', 'did', 'Nevertheless', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'think', 'really', 'prohibited', 'enjoying', 'film', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'see', 'film', 'honesty', 'appreciate', 'what', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'right', 'audience', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'was', 'entertaining', 'film', 'was', 'EXTREMELY', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'connection', 'going', 'make', 'one', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'stress', 'how', 'amazing', 'performances', 'were', 'far', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'wish', 'could', 'bring', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'reason', 'fact', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'grasp', 'film', 'have', 'rate', '4', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'others', 'who', 'can', 'way', 'relate', 'characters-', 'will', 'find', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'glancing', 'reviews', 'watch', 'definitely', 'worth', 'view']",The Spectacular Now

1643335,A2WOGEE6LKMA4R,B00C7BZYRO,"Mathew Klickstein ""Hat box""","[3, 5]","I enjoyed The Spectacular Now, ironically, in fleeting moments -- which is ironic, as that is one of the underlying themes of the film.It certainly lacks the depth, ingenuity and originality of 500 Days of Summer, but it's not too horrendous of a follow-up for the team that brought us this film.One thing that really saves Spectacular from being anything but is the casting and acting. I really felt like I knew this characters and although some of them -- such as the female protagonist -- could DEFINITELY have been developed more (as it is, she's more of a foil for our unwitting male protagonist; she's really just a sounding board for him and his insecurities), they really LOOKED like &#34;real people&#34; and acted in kind.Even the &#34;hotter&#34; ex-girlfriend is not unrealistically attractive for an average high school in Anytown, USA, and she acted like a normal person without any of the hackneyed hang-ups of such a character in a typical high school dramedy. These were real people who reminded me of my friends and myself in high school, and I really appreciated the choices both the filmmakers and actors made to achieve this.Even celeb cameos by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bob Odenkirk did not wrench me out of the reality of the film because they both looked and acted like, again, &#34;regular&#34; people. I at first didn't even notice Leigh was in the film, they all did such a good job of keeping her inconspicuous; she was just &#34;Mom.&#34;But, again, the movie still grossly failed to really develop the characters beyond certain superficialities, even within the well-drawn reality of the film. I wanted more, which can be a good sign for a film -- &#34;Always keep them wanting more&#34; -- but really there were times I was just frustrated that the characters didn't want more, too ... even though that, again, was one of the underlying themes of the film.I guess I just felt as stuck WATCHING this film as the characters did INSIDE of the film, and I don't believe that this was always intentional (or should have been, if it was; it made certain parts of the film seem needlessly repetitive and even interminable; it didn't have that fun horror film effect of wanting to slap the character around, &#34;Don't go through that door!&#34;; it just felt like the screenwriters or, perhaps in this case, novelist was/were lazy; there's more to life than this, etc.).The filmmaking itself was equally lazy.What I loved about 500 Days of Summer was ITS director really took the fantastic script from the Spectacular boys and made something that was wholly alive and kinetic without relegating the material to choppy and frenetic music video fare. Spectacular Now, however, opts for a filmmaking style that is as languid as the plot and character development and was part of what made certain sections drag.There was no oomph or life to the cinematography, editing or even music, and this was disappointing as there were some scenes that really could have used a bit more playfulness or, dare I say, imagination.

Oleson,"[1, 3]","There may be spoilers.I think I will have to clear room on my Top Ten list for 2013 for this beautiful little film about two teenagers finding each other.  Director James Ponsoldt has affectionately taken Tim Tharp's novel and slowly allows the characters to fall in love while the audience watches.  I can't say enough about Miles Teller (""Project X"") and Shailene Woodley's (proving her performance in ""The Descendants"" was no fluke) strong chemistry together which results in exceptional performances.  Nothing seems like dialog, just extemporaneous words flowing from their mouths.Sutter (Teller) is a high school senior who is perhaps best known as the class clown.  He's funny, easily approachable and good to be around.  He's not a jock nor the smartest kid in school.  But he likes school.  His biggest problem is that he is drunk most of the time.  Sometimes just pleasantly drunk, sometimes very drunk.  One day after a party, he shows up on the lawn of a classmate he barely knows.  Aimee (Woodley) helps her mom deliver newspapers and her never-seen mom got in late, so Aimee scoops up Sutter and off they go delivering papers at 6 AM.The casting is perfect for this movie.  Both actors (and supporting actors as well) look and talk like high school seniors.  Neither are the traditional Hollywood studs and starlets you typically find in movies like this.  While I suspect their looks were purposely dressed down, they look...well... average.  So does Sutter's ex-girlfriend and his best friend.  So does Aimee's friend.  How refreshing.  As the shy Aimee and extroverted Sutter spend more time together, bad and good characteristics rub off on each other.  Each helps the other confront their mothers.In Sutter's case, his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) won't tell him about his father's whereabouts.  It's been years since he's heard from him.  I expected the bomb to be dropped that dad is in prison or something.  When he eventually gets the phone number from his married sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he and Aimee make the 3 hour drive.  Unfortunately dad (Kyle Chandler) is a drunk womanizer, pretty much like his mother suggested.No matter how old we are, everyone can remember that first love.  It never leaves our memory.  I can promise that ""The Spectacular Now"" will give those memories a bit of a jolt.  This is an authentic film about young love.  Highly recommended.",5,4 1/2 stars.

1643354,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7BZYRO,Paul Allaer,"[28, 35]","""The Spectacular Now"" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Sutter (played by Miles Teller), a HS senior who is enjoying life in the moment, with no worry in the world as long as he has his whisky flask or other alcoholic beverages nearby (which is all the time). One day Sutter gets dumped by his girlfriend Cassidy and after a drunken night out, he wakes up in someone's front yard (not knowing how he got there). He gets found by Aimee (played by Shailene Woodley), a HS classmate of his. Aimee is the complete opposite of Sutter in every which way: withdrawn, smart, considerate. Yet Sutter takes an interest in her. Along the way, we learn that Sutter is dealing with `daddy issues'.  His dad left when he was a little kid. Sutter confronts his mom to try and get his dad's contact details. Will Aimee fall for Sutter? what about the other way around? And what's with this mysterious past of Sutter's dad? why did Sutter's parents really break up? To tell you much more of this plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments:  this is the third feature film from director James Ponsoldt, who just last year brought us another top quality indie movie called Smashed (starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul). Interestingly, alcohol dependency also plays a critical role in this movie. The script is based on the book by Tim Tharp (I did not read the book, so cannot comment to what extent, if any, the movie's plot deviates from the book). Despite the gorgeous movie poster and the cute trailer for the movie, ""The Spectacular Now"" is at times not an easy movie to watch, in the sense that Sutter is a mostly unlikeable and self-absorbed jerk whom you'd like to give a slap in the face and yell ""wake up!"". When Sutter gets dumped by Cassidy, his boss at work comments ""I really thought she would be the one to yank you out of neutral"", to which Sutter responds ""But I'm in overdrive!', completely clueless. All the more credit to Teller for playing this character with authority and credibility. But what about Woodley's performance! After playing lead in TV's ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"", she burst out of nowhere on the big screen a few years ago in ""The Descendants"" (playing George Clooney's on-screen daughter). It is Woodley's screen time that makes this movie as enjoyable as it is in the end. And if you wonder about that quote I put in my review title: just watch the movie...This movie made a splash when it debuted at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, and it's easy to see why. So glad this finally made it to Cincinnati. This opened here today at the local art-house theatre, and the matinee screening that I saw this at was very well attended, I am happy to say. I read somewhere that this movie was shot on a budget of just $2.5 mill., mere peanuts in Hollywood terms, and proving once again you don't needs a comic action hero or a $200 mill. budget to make a movie that engages the audience. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this.

1643360,A1NW04AD2WTUDY,B00C7BZYRO,Rosie,"[1, 3]","The Spectacular Now is a film adaptation of the popular novel by the same name from author Tim Tharp. The film follows the book fairly closely and is about a popular boy, Sutter Keely, who likes to party way too much, and a shy straight-arrow girl, Aimee, who befriends Sutter and then falls for him. It is at first a very unlikely coupling but Sutter and Aimee grow on each other, each getting something from the other that they couldn't have found on their own. The story follows the young romance as it strengthens and gently unwinds, as most young romances do, because sometimes what you each come to the other as is what you end up remaining, no matter what kind of influences enter your life. I love that the ending is realistic.The actors couldn't have been more perfect. Miles Teller was so good in Rabbit Hole and he brings to life an entirely different personality here and is a perfect casting. Shailene Woodley was incredible in another of my favorite films, The Descendants, and she too plays a quite different character in The Spectacular Now and so believably so.I found this film about teens refreshing. For once, kids from blue-collar existences and not upper-middle-class homes are portrayed. And for a change, cookie-cutter characters are nowhere to be found. The ""stoner,"" ""goody two-shoes,""  ""jock"" and ""class clown"" are here, for sure, but as with real people in real life they are fleshed out to portray people with more than one dimension.There's an excellent supporting cast, especially Kyle Chandler as Sutter's dad.This film gets you to thinking--or rethinking--about your teen years and where you may--or may not--have fit in.

1643372,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B00C7BZYRO,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[1, 2]","There's a very real danger in simply living in the moment. While it may sound exciting and adventurous, it also invites complacency and stagnation, a dangerous cocktail made more lethal when alcohol is thrown into the mix. While this may sound like a proper lead-in for director James Ponsoldt's previous Sundance hit, Smashed, it serves equally well for his wonderful coming of age story, The Spectacular Now.Teen romances are a dime a dozen, but it's rare to find one that has so much meaning and isn't just an excuse to pair up two beautiful people. The film deals believably and honestly with teen anxieties about the future, while also exploring the familial impact of addiction. If that sounds like potentially weighty stuff, that's because it is. Emotions run high from the very beginning and never let up even for a moment, from the joys of first love to painful examinations of one's self worth. Aided by tremendous performances by Miles Teller and Golden Globe nominee Shailene Woodley, we may be looking at one of the year's first truly great films.Before it gets to all that, the story may look and feel quite familiar. Sutter Keely(Teller) has everything that a high school senior could want. He's popular, forming the elite power couple with his girlfriend Cassidy(Brie Larson), and is always the life of the party. He's also a functioning alcoholic, taking quick sips from his flask at all hours of the day. As the school year begins to draw to a close, thoughts turn to the future. Cassidy, wanting more for herself than just a fun time, dumps him suddenly. Dealing with it the only way he knows how, Sutter drinks himself into a stupor, waking up on the lawn of Aimee Finicky(Woodley), an average and mostly invisible girl from school.Aimee is a beauty, but doesn't have the confidence in herself for others to see it. On the other hand, Sutter is the complete opposite. A completely charismatic figure with no fear of anything, the two begin a relationship that quickly blossoms into something more. Ponsoldt captures their budding love sweetly and without pretension. The two are a perfect mix on the surface. He emboldens her to stand up for herself and live a little, while she keeps him grounded enough to prevent a total meltdown. Through one another, they learn to deal with their various family issues with strength. Both come from broken homes, albeit via different means, and the added responsibility from such an arrangement has impacted them both. Most telling is the disappearance of Sutter's father (Kyle Chandler), who left the family under bad circumstances years earlier, leaving his mother(Jennifer Jason Leigh) to fend for herself. Sutter carries hopes that his father will someday enter back into his life, despite his family, including his sister(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hoping for the complete opposite.The film smashes all genre cliches with its authentic portrayal of the two lead characters. It's always a trap of teen romances to turn it into yet another version of She's All That, with a quick make-over and a cool new boyfriend changing the female's life forever. It's not that simple here, and Woodley captures Aimee's shyness and vulnerability without pushing it on us. While she was excellent in The Descendants and deserving of the acclaim she received, this is a role that requires more maturity and nuance, and the results may again see her in awards company. Teller, who gave as good as he got opposite Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole, is no less extraordinary as a guy trying to mask his insecurities under a shield of jokes and liquid courage.Movies like this tend to do great business at festivals, but don't always measure up after general audiences get done with them. Although writers Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter know a thing or two about turning teen romance into a critical and box office powerhouse, having written the whimsical (500) Days of Summer a few years ago. Much like that film, The Spectacular Now isn't satisfied with giving us the same old fluff, it aims for something deeper and lands a direct hit.",5,"Best Movie of 2013, Honest and Heartfelt in Ways Teen Movies Usually Aren't",1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,4080,"['very', 'real', 'danger', 'simply', 'living', 'moment', 'may', 'sound', 'exciting', 'adventurous', 'also', 'complacency', 'stagnation', 'dangerous', 'cocktail', 'made', 'more', 'lethal', 'when', 'alcohol', 'thrown', 'mix', 'may', 'sound', 'proper', 'lead-in', 'director', 'James', 'Ponsoldt', 'previous', 'Sundance', 'hit', 'Smashed', 'equally', 'well', 'wonderful', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Spectacular', 'Now.Teen', 'romances', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'rare', 'find', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'just', 'excuse', 'pair', 'up', 'two', 'beautiful', 'people', 'film', 'deals', 'believably', 'honestly', 'teen', 'anxieties', 'future', 'also', 'exploring', 'familial', 'impact', 'addiction', 'potentially', 'weighty', 'stuff', 'Emotions', 'run', 'high', 'very', 'beginning', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'even', 'moment', 'joys', 'first', 'love', 'painful', 'examinations', 'one', 'self', 'worth', 'Aided', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominee', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'one', 'year', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'films.Before', 'story', 'may', 'look', 'feel', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Sutter', 'Keely', 'Teller', 'everything', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'could', 'want', 'popular', 'forming', 'elite', 'power', 'couple', 'girlfriend', 'Cassidy', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'always', 'life', 'party', 'also', 'functioning', 'alcoholic', 'taking', 'quick', 'sips', 'flask', 'hours', 'day', 'school', 'year', 'draw', 'close', 'thoughts', 'turn', 'future', 'Cassidy', 'wanting', 'more', 'herself', 'just', 'fun', 'time', 'suddenly', 'Dealing', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'Sutter', 'stupor', 'waking', 'up', 'lawn', 'Aimee', 'Finicky', 'Woodley', 'average', 'mostly', 'invisible', 'girl', 'school.Aimee', 'beauty', ""n't"", 'have', 'confidence', 'herself', 'others', 'see', 'other', 'hand', 'Sutter', 'complete', 'opposite', 'completely', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'fear', 'anything', 'two', 'begin', 'relationship', 'quickly', 'something', 'more', 'Ponsoldt', 'budding', 'love', 'sweetly', 'pretension', 'two', 'are', 'perfect', 'mix', 'surface', 'stand', 'up', 'herself', 'live', 'little', 'grounded', 'enough', 'prevent', 'total', 'meltdown', 'one', 'learn', 'deal', 'various', 'family', 'issues', 'strength', 'come', 'broken', 'homes', 'different', 'means', 'added', 'responsibility', 'such', 'arrangement', 'impacted', 'Most', 'telling', 'disappearance', 'Sutter', 'father', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'who', 'left', 'family', 'bad', 'circumstances', 'years', 'earlier', 'leaving', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'fend', 'Sutter', 'father', 'will', 'someday', 'enter', 'back', 'life', 'family', 'including', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'hoping', 'complete', 'opposite.The', 'film', 'smashes', 'genre', 'cliches', 'authentic', 'portrayal', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'always', 'trap', 'teen', 'romances', 'turn', 'yet', 'version', 'quick', 'make-over', 'cool', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'changing', 'female', 'life', 'forever', 'not', 'that', 'here', 'Woodley', 'Aimee', 'shyness', 'vulnerability', 'pushing', 'was', 'excellent', 'Descendants', 'deserving', 'acclaim', 'received', 'role', 'more', 'maturity', 'nuance', 'results', 'may', 'again', 'see', 'awards', 'company', 'Teller', 'who', 'gave', 'as', 'good', 'got', 'opposite', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'less', 'extraordinary', 'guy', 'trying', 'mask', 'insecurities', 'shield', 'jokes', 'liquid', 'courage.Movies', 'tend', 'do', 'great', 'business', 'festivals', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'measure', 'up', 'general', 'audiences', 'get', 'done', 'writers', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Weber', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'turning', 'teen', 'romance', 'critical', 'box', 'office', 'powerhouse', 'having', 'written', 'whimsical', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Much', 'film', 'Spectacular', 'Now', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'giving', 'same', 'old', 'fluff', 'something', 'deeper', 'direct', 'hit']",The Spectacular Now

1643374,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00C7BZYRO,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'The Spectacular Now' is directed by James Ponsoldt, who gave us last year's alcohol-themed drama, 'Smashed'. This film is also partly about alcoholism but overall it's a coming of age story, focusing on the trials and tribulations of one Sutter Kelly (played by an engaging Miles Teller).Sutter is an 18 year old well-liked and outgoing high school student, who appears not to have any problems aggressively pursuing women. His very good-looking girlfriend, Cassidy, eventually decides to leave him because Sutter is fast developing a rather nasty drinking problem and has no real ambitions, except living in the 'spectacular now'. One night Sutter gets drunk and ends up on a stranger's lawn. He's awakened by Cassidy's opposite, the semi-shy 'good girl', Aimee Finecky (played by Shailene Woodley of 'The Descendants' fame').In the first half of 'The Spectacular Now', you're led to believe that the film is going to be about Sutter's conflict over the two girls, but soon that doesn't turn out to be the case. Sutter and Aimee both challenge each other to stand up to their mothers. In Aimee's case, she wants to go to college in Philadelphia but her mother wants her to remain home, helping her with her paper route job. Sutter wants his mother to give him his long-lost father's phone number, so he can get in touch with him (for years the Mom has refused to comply).The second half of the film's narrative veers in a decidedly different direction. We soon find out that Sutter's charming demeanor is a mask for a severe lack of self-esteem. He drives for hours with Aimee to see his father, who turns out to be a hopeless alcoholic, makes the teenagers pay the tab for their dinner at a bar and then fails to return after he promises to within an hour. Devastated by his encounter with his father, Sutter pushes Aimee away despite her expressions of love for him; an argument ensues on the way back home and Sutter orders Aimee out of the car. As she steps out, she's hit by a car by fortunately only breaks her arm.Sutter's downward spiral continues as he fails to see Aimee off to school at the bus station. He then goes on a bender and drives drunk back home, knocking down the mailbox on the front lawn, in front of his horrified mother. She, however, consoles him with a heavy dose of motherly love and manages to convince him that he is loved, despite his claims to the contrary.'The Spectacular Now' is a well-made, conventional coming of age story. It's well-acted but the narrative doesn't have a great deal of twists and turns. The resolution of the story is heart-warming, but a bit pat, since that heavy dose of motherly love is enough to turn the troubled Sutter around. For those who like happy endings, 'Now' is for you. But given the extent of Sutter's lack of self-esteem, a few hugs and soothing words from this mother, probably would not have turned him around so fast, in real life.",3,"Solid, coming of age tale of troubled teenager derails slightly with abrupt happy ending",1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2949,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'The"", 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'directed', 'James', 'Ponsoldt', 'who', 'gave', 'last', 'year', 'alcohol-themed', 'drama', ""'Smashed"", 'film', 'also', 'partly', 'alcoholism', 'overall', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'focusing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'one', 'Sutter', 'Kelly', 'played', 'engaging', 'Miles', 'Teller', '.Sutter', '18', 'year', 'old', 'well-liked', 'outgoing', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'problems', 'aggressively', 'pursuing', 'women', 'very', 'good-looking', 'girlfriend', 'Cassidy', 'eventually', 'leave', 'Sutter', 'fast', 'developing', 'rather', 'nasty', 'drinking', 'problem', 'real', 'ambitions', 'living', ""'spectacular"", 'now', 'One', 'night', 'Sutter', 'drunk', 'up', 'stranger', 'lawn', 'awakened', 'Cassidy', 'opposite', 'semi-shy', ""'good"", 'girl', 'Aimee', 'Finecky', 'played', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', ""'The"", 'Descendants', 'fame', '.In', 'first', 'half', ""'The"", 'Spectacular', 'Now', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'Sutter', 'conflict', 'two', 'girls', 'soon', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'Sutter', 'Aimee', 'challenge', 'other', 'stand', 'up', 'mothers', 'Aimee', 'case', 'go', 'college', 'Philadelphia', 'mother', 'remain', 'home', 'helping', 'paper', 'route', 'job', 'Sutter', 'mother', 'give', 'long-lost', 'father', 'phone', 'number', 'can', 'get', 'touch', 'years', 'Mom', 'refused', 'comply', '.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'narrative', 'veers', 'decidedly', 'different', 'direction', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Sutter', 'charming', 'demeanor', 'mask', 'severe', 'lack', 'self-esteem', 'hours', 'Aimee', 'see', 'father', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'hopeless', 'alcoholic', 'teenagers', 'pay', 'tab', 'dinner', 'bar', 'then', 'return', 'hour', 'Devastated', 'encounter', 'father', 'Sutter', 'Aimee', 'away', 'expressions', 'love', 'argument', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'Sutter', 'orders', 'Aimee', 'car', 'out', 'hit', 'car', 'fortunately', 'only', 'arm.Sutter', 'downward', 'spiral', 'see', 'Aimee', 'school', 'bus', 'station', 'then', 'bender', 'drunk', 'back', 'home', 'knocking', 'down', 'mailbox', 'front', 'lawn', 'front', 'horrified', 'mother', 'however', 'heavy', 'dose', 'motherly', 'love', 'manages', 'convince', 'loved', 'claims', 'contrary', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'well-made', 'conventional', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'well-acted', 'narrative', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'twists', 'turns', 'resolution', 'story', 'heart-warming', 'bit', 'pat', 'heavy', 'dose', 'motherly', 'love', 'enough', 'turn', 'troubled', 'Sutter', 'who', 'like', 'happy', 'endings', ""'Now"", 'given', 'extent', 'Sutter', 'lack', 'self-esteem', 'few', 'hugs', 'soothing', 'words', 'mother', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'turned', 'around', 'so', 'fast', 'real', 'life']",The Spectacular Now

1643378,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00C7BZYRO,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[2, 5]","Directed by James Ponsoldt from a screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber based on the novel by Tim Tharp, The Spectacular Now is a marvelously crafted film about teenagers on the threshold of adulthood, centered around the character of Sutter Keely, an amiable slacker (and more-than-borderline alcoholic) who's content to live in what he calls 'the spectacular now' with no thought of - or regard for - the future. Or for the consequences of his actions.The film begins with Sutter (Miles Teller) working on a college application, responding to an essay question asking him to describe a hardship he's faced. His response is a self-indulgent rant about how everything in his life was going great until his ""perfect high school couple"" girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson) broke up with him over a misunderstanding, which is then shown in flashback, where we learn more about Sutter. Later at a party, he runs into Cassidy again and tries to patch things up with her, only to learn that she's moved on and has a new boyfriend, Marcus (Dayo Okeniyi). Sutter reacts by getting more drunk than usual, ending up passed out on a stranger's lawn with no idea how he got there or where his car is. He is found and woken awake by a girl from his high school named Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who was driving by in the course of delivering newspapers for her mom. Partly out of gratitude and partly because he needs to find his car, Sutter helps Aimee deliver the rest of her papers, and on an impulse asks her to have lunch with him, to which she hesitantly agrees, not being used to being the object of any boy's interest. A relationship begins to develop between the two, in spite of the misgivings of their friends. Aimee's friend Bethany (Ava London) is protective, not wanting Aimee to get hurt because she knows Sutter's party-boy reputation. Sutter's best friend Ricky (Masam Holden) is also concerned because he _knows_ Sutter. He knows that Aimee - who's kind of shy and likes reading sci-fi and Japanese manga - isn't the kind of party-girl Sutter usually gets involved with. And most of all, he knows that, even if Sutter's intentions are harmless, the consequences of his behavior are not.Many things make The Spectacular Now stand out from the usual Hollywood teens-coming-of-age comedy/drama. One of the best things is how it shows how Sutter's amiable slacker who's content to just drift along is the exception, that most of his friends _are_ conscious of impending adulthood and are concerned about their futures. And they do worry about what they're going to do next and whether they're making the right decisions. Cassidy, for example, voices these concerns when she tries to explain to Cutter - who keeps making impulsive attempts to get back together with her - why she prefers Marcus to him: it's because Marcus, while he's not as much fun to be with, is serious. Marcus has a future ahead of him, a future that he's actively moving towards, a future of the kind that she wants to have, and Sutter... doesn't. There's a sweet and wistful sadness to the scene, a consciousness on Cassidy's part that she's growing up and Sutter just isn't, which she tries to soften by telling him ""You'll always be my favorite ex-boyfriend."" Which is what finally manages to penetrate Sutter's willful obliviousness and makes him realize that it really is over between them.The cast is truly excellent, giving performances that make their characters - teenaged and adult alike - both believable and sympathetic, even when their short-comings are on painful display.Highly, highly recommended.",5,A spectacularly realistic portrayal of teens on the threshold of adulthood,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,3596,"['Directed', 'James', 'Ponsoldt', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Weber', 'based', 'novel', 'Tim', 'Tharp', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'marvelously', 'crafted', 'film', 'teenagers', 'threshold', 'adulthood', 'centered', 'character', 'Sutter', 'Keely', 'amiable', 'slacker', 'more-than-borderline', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'content', 'live', 'what', ""'the"", 'spectacular', 'now', 'thought', 'regard', 'future', 'consequences', 'actions.The', 'film', 'Sutter', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'working', 'college', 'application', 'responding', 'essay', 'question', 'asking', 'describe', 'hardship', 'faced', 'response', 'self-indulgent', 'rant', 'how', 'everything', 'life', 'was', 'going', 'great', 'perfect', 'high', 'school', 'couple', 'girlfriend', 'Cassidy', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'broke', 'up', 'over', 'misunderstanding', 'then', 'shown', 'flashback', 'where', 'learn', 'more', 'Sutter', 'Later', 'party', 'Cassidy', 'again', 'tries', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'only', 'learn', 'moved', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Marcus', 'Dayo', 'Okeniyi', 'Sutter', 'reacts', 'getting', 'more', 'drunk', 'usual', 'ending', 'up', 'passed', 'out', 'stranger', 'lawn', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'where', 'car', 'found', 'woken', 'awake', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'named', 'Aimee', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'course', 'delivering', 'newspapers', 'mom', 'Partly', 'gratitude', 'partly', 'find', 'car', 'Sutter', 'Aimee', 'deliver', 'rest', 'papers', 'impulse', 'have', 'lunch', 'hesitantly', 'not', 'being', 'used', 'being', 'object', 'boy', 'interest', 'relationship', 'develop', 'two', 'spite', 'misgivings', 'friends', 'Aimee', 'friend', 'Bethany', 'Ava', 'London', 'protective', 'not', 'wanting', 'Aimee', 'get', 'hurt', 'Sutter', 'party-boy', 'reputation', 'Sutter', 'best', 'friend', 'Ricky', 'Masam', 'Holden', 'also', 'concerned', 'Sutter', 'Aimee', 'who', 'kind', 'shy', 'likes', 'reading', 'sci-fi', 'Japanese', 'manga', ""n't"", 'kind', 'party-girl', 'Sutter', 'usually', 'involved', 'most', 'even', 'Sutter', 'intentions', 'are', 'harmless', 'consequences', 'behavior', 'are', 'not.Many', 'things', 'make', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'stand', 'out', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'teens-coming-of-age', 'comedy/drama', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'how', 'how', 'Sutter', 'amiable', 'slacker', 'who', 'content', 'just', 'drift', 'along', 'exception', 'most', 'friends', '_are_', 'conscious', 'impending', 'adulthood', 'are', 'concerned', 'futures', 'do', 'worry', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'next', ""'re"", 'making', 'right', 'decisions', 'Cassidy', 'example', 'concerns', 'when', 'explain', 'Cutter', 'who', 'making', 'impulsive', 'attempts', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'why', 'Marcus', 'Marcus', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'be', 'serious', 'Marcus', 'future', 'ahead', 'future', 'actively', 'moving', 'towards', 'future', 'kind', 'have', 'Sutter', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'wistful', 'sadness', 'scene', 'consciousness', 'Cassidy', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'Sutter', 'just', ""n't"", 'soften', 'telling', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Which', 'what', 'finally', 'penetrate', 'Sutter', 'willful', 'obliviousness', 'realize', 'really', 'them.The', 'cast', 'truly', 'excellent', 'giving', 'performances', 'make', 'characters', 'teenaged', 'adult', 'alike', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'when', 'short-comings', 'are', 'painful', 'display.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Spectacular Now
