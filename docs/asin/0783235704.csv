A good plot twist has the government against Newman, and the couple race from place to place trying to find their way back to the U.S.  A lot of edge-of-the-seat memorable scenes and the stars in it make for a classic that is very re-watchable.",4,Suspense Behind the Iron Curtain,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,537,"['34', 'Torn', 'Curtain', '34', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'late', '1960', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'American', 'scientist', 'who', 'Cold', 'War', 'country', 'tell', 'fiancee', 'played', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'tho', 'many', 'times', 'go', 'home', 'follow', 'heart', 'good', 'plot', 'twist', 'government', 'Newman', 'couple', 'race', 'place', 'place', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'U.S.', 'A', 'lot', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'stars', 'make', 'classic', 'very', 're-watchable']",N/A

The only reason for four stars instead of five was that I couldn't help comparing it to Hitchcock's best. It's good, but it's not his best.Dr. Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) is a physicist attending a conference in Copenhagen and his assistant and fiancee, Dr. Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews), has come along despite his reluctance to bring her. We soon learn why he didn't want her to come along: he tells her he has to go to another city (don't remember what it was, but somewhere in the West), but actually heads for East Berlin. She finds out where he's going accidentally, and follows him.Complicated? Of course it's complicated. They are greeted in East Berlin by a gaggle of reporters and photographers eager to see the defecting American scientist.Defecting? Sarah is aghast, and does not know what to make of it all. But of course the authorities want her to go home, and she does not want to leave without Michael. Reluctantly, she agrees to stay.No, I haven't told you too much. All this, and a good bit more, happens in the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie. I could not help sympathizing with Sarah's sorrow and confusion, but ultimately I understand that a woman, even a beautiful woman, would be very reluctant to let Paul Newman (young and at his peak) get away from her.Hitchcock's cameo is a cute one.

In fact, it's likely the most unimpressive color film Hitchcock ever made.  Is it unwatchable?  Certainly not.  Paul Newman is amusingly flinty, Julie Andrews is tolerable to look at, and, very occasionally, there is some recognizable (but nowhere inspired) Hitchcock mise-en-scene to chew on.  Nonetheless, the overall mediocrity of the film can become excruciating.As the most recent reviewer has ably noted, the implausibilities here are outrageous.  Would a prized defector really be allowed to walk out of the hotel the morning after his arrival and disappear who knows where?  And what the devil was the purpose of running into the museum to start with (and why was there not a soul present to protect East German cultural treasures from the grubby proletariat)?  And why did he have to go all the way out to the farm, exposing himself to such risk, for the sake of an uninstructive conversation on a tractor, which could have been had much less riskily by the American agent coming to Berlin to find Dr. Armstrong instead?  And where the heck was the old chap when they were fighting for their lives in the farmhouse?!?!?And this is just the comparably better first act.Indeed, even that famous farmhouse fight is, in my opinion, a somewhat lesser Hitchcock setpiece, though it suffers by the context of the film it's inclosed within.  As for the other big setpieces-- the bus ride and the ballet sequence-- there is simply nothing to be said in their defense.  The bus sequence is excruciatingly slow and laughably ridiculous, and the ballet is simply a nonstarter.  As for the coffehouse interlude with our Polish countess, I'm not quite sure whether to laugh or cry.  Perhaps it is a comment on the pathos of those trapped inside the Iron Curtain, or perhaps Hitchcock is simply amusing himself with comic relief, or relieving himself, as it were, of responsibility for this film.  At any rate, it is a more excusable exercise in mannerism than that impossible Dr. Lindt, who we might have hoped had choked on a bite of ham somewhere in the intervening years since he left Constance Petersen behind.  But why is ""Torn Curtain""s East Germany about as menacing as Michael Barone's notion of Sweden anyway?  The universities are all modern, the skirts are reasonably short, and their museum, after all, is hardly ""strictly for the birds"".  One might almost suspect Hitchcock of subverting Cold War hysteria, except that he surely understood the totalitarian mindset all too well.  Rather, I blame a slack script and Hitch's own understandable sense of distance from this pitiful project.

I read that this film wasn't very good, but a friend of mine said it was wonderful, so I decided to see for myself. It was better than Topaz (which I think is Hitchcock's worst), but only just barely better enough because I managed to sit through it until the end. I don't like Paul Newman - and I've given him chance after chance. He's like a block of wood. Julie Andrews seemed to be putting forth no effort here either, and I know she can act (see The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins for proof). I did think it a bit strange that she never burst into song either.The pattern of the travels of Michael Armstrong and Co. was a bit hazy and unrealistic. I mean, in East Germany, you are not going to have all those narrow escapes. The woman in the strange hat and rainbow scarf was a mystery to me as well - what she really had to do with anything I don't know. The story was weak and pointless, really, and Paul and Julie extremely unconvincing as a couple madly in love. And contrary to my description of my location above, wire-taps did not play into this tale at all.The scene when Gromek is following Michael through the museum is probably the only artistic moment in the whole movie.The climax was not at all thrilling, just laughable. Fire, yells Paul Newman, but he had better look out that his wooden acting doesn't catch fire cause it's all he's got! But on the other hand, that might not be a bad thing, if it DID catch...I do not recommend this movie unless you're a Hitchcock enthusiast. That's why I watched it and I will not watch it again...

66632,A854E5FCL8X1I,0783235704,customer,"[2, 2]","""Torn Curtain"" stars Paul Newman as Professor Michael Armstrong, an American scientist who defects to East Germany when Washington does not support his ""Gamma-5"" project. He planned to keep his defection secret from his girlfriend/assistant Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). When Sarah discovers a message intended for Michael, she decides to follow him behind the Iron Curtain. Later, when he reveals to Sarah his true intentions for coming to East Germany, it is an exciting chase for them to escape with their lives.The film seems to have all the necessary ingredients to make a classic Hitchcock political thriller, right? Yes and no. The film has some very suspenseful qualities, but it has its flaws,too. The best moments in the film are the nail-biting and eerily silent museum sequence, the gruesome murder scene of the suspicious inspector Gromek, the bus scenes, and the climax in the theater (reminiscent of ""The Man Who Knew too Much"").The film's problems start with that it is just a little bit long. It could have cut maybe five or ten minutes and I would not have complained. Secondly, the film's music. Hitchcock fired his longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann (who wrote the music for ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", and ""Psycho"" among others) when he and Universal were unsatisfied with his musical score. So, they hired a new composer, John Addison. Frankly, Addison's music is not nearly as good as Herrmann's would've been. It feels out of place and just wrong for some scenes. Last but not least is Julie Andrews. While I think Paul Newman was a fine choice in the role of Armstrong, Julie Andrews just doesn't fit the part of a Hitchcock leading lady as well as Grace Kelly or Kim Novak. I think she is too stiff and librarianish. Apparently, neither of them were Hitchcock's first choice, for they were both chosen for him by Universal because of their popularity at the time.The DVD is very nice. I had no problems with picture or sound. The disc has good bonus features including a thirty minute making-of documentary called ""Torn Curtain Rising"", an interesting look at what certain scenes would be like with Herrmann's music, the theatrical trailer for the film, and production notes and photographs.Overall, this film is very good Hitchcock, not excellent Hitchcock. 4 stars.",4,"""Torn Curtain"", very Underrated!",1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,2303,"['Curtain', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Professor', 'Michael', 'Armstrong', 'American', 'scientist', 'who', 'East', 'Germany', 'when', 'Washington', 'not', 'support', 'Gamma-5', 'project', 'planned', 'keep', 'defection', 'secret', 'girlfriend/assistant', 'Sarah', 'Sherman', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'When', 'Sarah', 'message', 'intended', 'Michael', 'follow', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'Later', 'when', 'Sarah', 'true', 'intentions', 'coming', 'East', 'Germany', 'exciting', 'chase', 'escape', 'lives.The', 'film', 'have', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'make', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'political', 'thriller', 'right', 'Yes', 'film', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'qualities', 'flaws', 'too', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'nail-biting', 'eerily', 'silent', 'museum', 'sequence', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'scene', 'suspicious', 'inspector', 'Gromek', 'bus', 'scenes', 'climax', 'theater', 'reminiscent', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'too', 'Much', '.The', 'film', 'problems', 'start', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'maybe', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'complained', 'Secondly', 'film', 'music', 'Hitchcock', 'fired', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'who', 'wrote', 'music', 'Vertigo', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Psycho', 'others', 'when', 'Universal', 'were', 'unsatisfied', 'musical', 'score', 'So', 'hired', 'new', 'composer', 'John', 'Addison', 'Frankly', 'Addison', 'music', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Herrmann', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'place', 'just', 'wrong', 'scenes', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'think', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'fine', 'choice', 'role', 'Armstrong', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'part', 'Hitchcock', 'leading', 'lady', 'as', 'well', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'think', 'too', 'stiff', 'librarianish', 'Apparently', 'were', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'choice', 'were', 'chosen', 'Universal', 'popularity', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', 'had', 'problems', 'picture', 'sound', 'disc', 'good', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'thirty', 'minute', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'called', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'Rising', 'interesting', 'look', 'what', 'certain', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'Herrmann', 'music', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'production', 'notes', 'photographs.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'Hitchcock', 'not', 'excellent', 'Hitchcock', '4', 'stars']",N/A
66633,A35LWA8VY66G8F,0783235704,Daniel G. Madigan,"[1, 5]","Torn Curtain has many Hitchcock associates not involved with this fiolm, and it shows. The Bernard Hermann score is not here, the Robert Burks cinematography is not here, and the casting is not very good.Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins, a governess, and Maria Von Trapp, a governess, or a one dimensional secretary in Throughly Modern Millie. She is not Grace Kelly or Kim Novak or Janet Leigh, great stars and great artists. Paul Newman, a great actor,  struggles with Andrews' monotone deliveries, and it seems as though Hitchcock has given up on the film less than half way through, as set pieces with no drive accumulate.For example: There are many scenes with Julie and Paul eating, in a theatre staring, waiting for the next thing to occur. It's flat in these scenes and Paul Newman becomes more and more inaccsessible to us as Julie Andrews almost fades away. Paul did this sort of backing away in Exodus and in The Silver Chalice. He just cannot deal with low end talents, and so shuts down.The best scene is the killing of a person in a kitchen. Very good Hitchcock and very good Newman. Andrews is not there, fortunately.Lila Kedrova drops in for a long cafe scene, describing at great length her need for a Spnsor to go to the great USA, followed by a long speech on the awful quality of Soviet cigarettes. Newman and Andrews stare at her, and Julie manages a smile and a tentative offer of assistance. Kedrova then  takes Paul and Julie  to the Post Office , and here we have a long Q and no A scene that goes on and on; not Hitchockian at all; he would have edited this for speed and suspense. It's boring, but again, as some have said, interesting in terms of waiting for inefficient communist systems to work. However, we are far from Psycho or Vertigo or Frenzy with respect to artful suspense.Indeed,  count the number of scenes in restaurants and airports and class rooms and bed rooms, and post offices and street scenes, where Paul and Julie are without dialogue and we are caught up in dull, local matters, as we wait for them to act.Suspense? This film has about as much suspense as a bus 'ticket round trip.But, maybe a ticket does have suspense, however, not here.Note well too, Julie's wardrobe, and her beautiful hair and manicures. This is not East Germany, or even West Germany.And too, note the excellent camera work in the classroom scene with Paul and that out of control professor of Rocket science. What is happening?So, there are things, but go back to Marnie even, or The Birds, definately, and of course Psycho.. the credits of Psycho alone, with the old crew on board, the great scripts, the non stop deliberate set pieces that turn into hair raising suspense and , as in Psycho, leave one breathless, anxious for more, and yet dreading it. Note too, drawn out sces as in Torn Curtain, but witjh great differfences: the mezmerizing artistic handling by Hitchcock in the interrogation in Vertigo with all that color and scenery, including discreet, disturbing shots of the fatal tower where Madeleine falls to her death. And in the same scene Henry Jones tearing James Stewart to shreds as an incompetent detective, and Stewart's face, ready to take Jones up the tower(we can imagine) and give him a needed push. The monologue of Jones, almost insane at times in his obvious hatred of Stewart.  And then, when all is over and the other detective is trying to get Stewart to leave, we have the museum interposition  with the portrait of Madeleine Valdez, and Novak's necklace in the painting. A long scene, but the dynamics and the interplays between Stewart and Jones and the assistant cop are startling.  Brillance on  so many levels. Torn Curtain has none of this beacuse Hitchcock cannot teach Andrews how to act (noone can), and he cannot get Paul Newman out of that shut down coma he's in, and, Hitchcock does not have his old crew oir any kind of a dramatic script.BUT,  There isn't afilm like Torn Curtain anywhere; it's so camp and crazy and badly acted by Andrews, and you can't stop watching.

This is not good Hitchcock, but even bad is better than lots of other things one could have seen then and now.There is a great scene, the death of a motorcyclist in a remote German farm house. Both Paul Newman and this farm housewife try everythinbg to kill this leather-clad commie &quot;type,&quot; and their efforts are truly bizzare. Knives, shovels, suasage dishes, and finally gas from the oven finishes him off. I always wondered how much gas came out of that oven, and why neither Newman nor the woman felt its effects.In any case, this scene is not to be missed, so buy the DVD for it. The rest of Torn Curtain is unintentionally funny, with  the weird scenery, with flase backdrops here and there, and, toward the end of the film, a surreal busride, where everyone seems to be in the same seat...a delight!Hitchcock had not lost it here; he didn't have his usual crew on tap, and he had Andrews, who shows here how bad she is for suspense and the screen in general..(after Mary Poppins and Millie, never a good film,) and how Paul Newman picks up on her ineptitude. It is one of his worst performances. But is has that scene , and  Lila Kedrova overacting, and a hilarious ending. Don't pass this up.

The film gets an extra star simply for the gorgeous photography and excellent farm house sequence,  other than that there is very little to offer with this snooze fest.  Newman and Andrews are pretty much wasted as a couple in Berlin posing as spies.  They do the best they can with a suspenseless (a word I thought I would never use when reviewing a Hitchcock film) story.  The whole movie was just so damn lethargic.

This Cold War thriller features Paul Newman and Julie Andrews as prominent US physicist Michael Armstrong and his assistant/fiance Sarah Sherman, in a tense story of espionage and betrayal.As the movie opens, Michael and Sarah are on their way to Copenhagen for a scientific conference.  Michael's erratic behavior begins to alarm Sarah, and when he suddenly defects to East Germany, she impulsively follows him through the Iron Curtain.  Michael, an expert on missile defenses, is warmly received by East German State Security, and Sarah is invited to stay on with him.  However, Michael's agenda is rather more complicated than a simple defection, and Sarah is soon made a more or less willing accomplice.Hitchcock's habitually superb craftsmanship is very much in evidence in ""Torn Curtain.""  After a slow start, the movie picks up speed with a stalking sequence through a museum, followed by an agonizingly explicit fight-to-the-death in a remote farmhouse.  Michael's enterprise is placed at risk, and much of the last half of the movie is an incredibly suspenseful chase, broken by moments of almost jarring humor.Superb location shooting and a promising plot are marred by sometimes clunky dialogue.  Newman and Andrews put in a solid performance but never quite become compelling as a couple.

66646,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0783235704,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","At the height of the Cold War, American nuclear physicist Michael Armstrong is playing a very deep game. On the surface it seems as if  the discontented professor has defected to East Berlin, to beyond the Iron Curtain. But this is a Hitchcock thriller and ""on the surface"" only means that the story's just getting started, and that first glances can be deceiving. Hold on for that switcheroo. It's coming.When you ponder Alfred Hitchcock's best suspense thrillers, TORN CURTAIN probably doesn't surface on the memory until very late. TORN CURTAIN, THE PARADINE CASE, and THE WRONG MAN tend to wallow in obscurity while more celebrated films like NORTH BY NORTHWEST and TO CATCH A THIEF always seem to get the spotlight. And rightly so.Hitchcock got the idea for TORN CURTAIN from a real life incident in 1951 when two British diplomats, Guy Burges and Donald  McClain, defected to Russia. Hitchcock went on to muse: ""What did Mrs. McClain think of the whole thing?"" TORN CURTAIN is broken up in three acts, and we view the first act thru Julie Andrew's eyes. She plays Michael Armstrong's fiancee and assistant, Dr. Sarah Sherman, and we witness her growing disquiet as Michael begins to behave very suspiciously. She catches him in a lie and trails him to East Germany, and she promptly becomes a complication Professor Armstrong did not at all envision.The second act begins and the viewpoint switches to that of Armstrong as we follow his initially puzzling movements. In fact, it's not until around the 44 minute mark that we finally for certain get wise to the true goings on. The third act is basically comprised of a series of chase scenes, and Hitchcock unveils another suspenseful permutation of his patented man-on-the-run concert hall sequence.One scene towers above the rest. On the heels of those flashy James Bond thrillers, Hitchcock had intended to demonstrate the dirty side of the spy game and how noticeably out of depth Newman's amateur operative is with the cloak and dagger business. In particular Hitchcock wished to demonstrate just how hard it truly is to kill someone. I'm not about to forget that extended murder scene in the farm house, in which the victim gets put in a stranglehold, stabbed, whacked with a shovel, and then asphyxiated (that last one does the trick). Don't think I didn't catch the irony of the East German agent finally getting his via a gas oven. But, no, murder ain't easy.There's no denying the moments of sluggishness. Several things factored into TORN CURTAIN being dismissed as an artistic flop. MARNIE's death at the box office had something to do with it, as an unsure Hitchcock then allowed the studio to interfere with his creative process. Julie Andrews was an actress he didn't want for the film, but the studio insisted and then her limited availability made Hitchcock rush into production before he was entirely satisfied with the script. Then he was forced to fire his longtime collaborator, composer Bernard Herrmann, and in hindsight Herrmann's work would probably have elevated the film. Hitchcock clashed with Paul Newman, an outspoken gent who had his own issues with the script. Newman and Andrews could have displayed better chemistry onscreen; a fiery romance would've tremendously helped the story. And, other than the oven scene, I don't recall much of Hitchcock's penchant for black humor.DVD features include: the ""TORN CURTAIN Rising"" documentary which explores the themes in the movie as well as detailing the film's troubled shooting history (00:32:24 minutes); scenes scored by composer Bernard Herrmann before Hitchcock fired him; this includes Herrmann's scoring for the extended murder scene, which by the way improves it (00:14:36); production photos; 7 pages of production notes; and the theatrical trailer.Has the march of time improved Hitchcock's 50th film? I'm no expert, but it's pretty evident that it's not in the same stratosphere as the more heralded stuff by the Master of Suspense. But TORN CURTAIN, irregardless of chemistry issues, does have two all-time movie stars playing the leads - but, no, Julie Andrews doesn't sing. The tension-fraught set pieces aren't quite as tension-fraught as Hitchcock's masterpieces, but they're still heaps better than most other director's efforts. Who else but Hitchcock can jangle one's nerves merely by a bus gradually catching up to the camera? Heck with it, I'm rating this 4 out of 5 stars. You can't mess with Hitchcock.But someone hand some mustard to the aging Lila Kedrova, who plays the raggedy countess so frantic to escape to America.

66649,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0783235704,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 4]","Hitchcock was not brilliantly inspired with this film, even and maybe especially in 1966. It is true it was a very deep period in the Cold War, but because the trap of a war the US were already largely engaged in and involved in, the Vietnam War, was literally starting to shake the whole world with horror and to menace that world on its very basis after the sigh of relief we all let out after the Cuban missile crisis. So Hitchcock had to do a cold war film, so what, and he chose the easiest target he could find, East Germany, though that was rather easy, but even if it was easy it did not take him away from the good old European or Western tradition he would have lost if he had gone further East, and then he would have been lost in translation. And at the same time we feel there is at least one tongue in one cheek, and I would say on both sides of the mouth. What makes it a whole farce in a way? It is the whole vanity of the spying-counter-spying mission  of that poor Professor Armstrong. To get out of an East German scientist the key scientific element of a discovery that could save the world from any nuclear war. First it was absurd to imagine the East doing some research to guarantee peace since western propaganda was repeating day after and night after night and week after week that their standard identity was that of a war-mongering empire. But the best of it all is that they send a scientist to get that element out of this East German, and that that amateur spy is getting the secret by tricking the East German into revealing him that secret out of vanity. And of course the East German professor understands he has been tricked by an ignoramus, but slightly too late. And every detail is going that way. Every situation is absurdly upside down. And these impossible elements become some kind of black, very black, blacker than black humor. Blacker than I you die, as the saying could have it. You'll have to watch the film to get a good laugh. In the entirely collectivized agriculture of East Germany you have one farm worker on his tractor doing nothing in the middle of a field, alone, and running around on his tractor waiting for the arrival of our Armstrong to tell him who knows what about who knows what. That is probably the most incredible element in that film, that absolutely solitary person in a regime that was based on the total absence of solitude. And what about the girl in the totally isolated farm alone again and her carelessness of not erasing the symbolic PI from the dirt in the farmyard. And once again what was that solitary farm doing in a collectivized agriculture? And the escape is more than a laugh. It is sad today to be so naively funny. Escape upon escape with so thin threads to hold it all up that we wonder if it is not some kind of joke. But the best is the female ballet dancer who recognizes Armstrong and his girlfriend in the middle of the opera from the stage with all limelight and overhead lights and all other lights on and blaring their dazzling light. Anyone who has any knowledge about that kind of situation will say it is impossible. Stage lights are like an unbreakable cocoon of light for the artists on the stage. Really that kind of humor is like ""everyone wants to go to heaven, but no one wants to go now"". The final stages of the escape I can't tell because they are too sad in their fun, especially the episode of highwaymen on East German roads. If there was something typical of East Germany, it was their extraordinary honesty. Stealing was not even a crime that had to be banned or forbidden because stealing was just foreign to their minds. That was probably the best achievement of these communist societies: they ignored crime, not because it was not advertised, but just because it did not exist, or was so marginal that it was anachronic to mention it. At the same time Hitchcock captured some of the traits of that East German society so well that it is better than ""Goodbye Lenin"", even if the mention of ""good"" coffee is so nostalgically true. I am afraid a modern audience might find it boring because it is, since every single detail has to be remembered out of oblivion.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,One of Hitchcock's films that has aged badly,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,4312,"['Hitchcock', 'was', 'not', 'brilliantly', 'inspired', 'film', 'even', 'maybe', 'especially', '1966', 'true', 'was', 'very', 'deep', 'period', 'Cold', 'War', 'trap', 'war', 'US', 'were', 'already', 'largely', 'engaged', 'involved', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'literally', 'starting', 'shake', 'whole', 'world', 'horror', 'menace', 'world', 'very', 'basis', 'sigh', 'relief', 'let', 'out', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'do', 'cold', 'war', 'film', 'what', 'chose', 'easiest', 'target', 'could', 'find', 'East', 'Germany', 'was', 'rather', 'easy', 'even', 'was', 'easy', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'good', 'old', 'European', 'Western', 'tradition', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'had', 'gone', 'further', 'East', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'translation', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'least', 'one', 'tongue', 'one', 'cheek', 'would', 'say', 'sides', 'mouth', 'What', 'whole', 'farce', 'way', 'whole', 'vanity', 'spying-counter-spying', 'mission', 'poor', 'Professor', 'Armstrong', 'get', 'East', 'German', 'scientist', 'key', 'scientific', 'element', 'discovery', 'could', 'save', 'world', 'nuclear', 'war', 'First', 'was', 'absurd', 'imagine', 'East', 'doing', 'research', 'guarantee', 'peace', 'western', 'propaganda', 'was', 'repeating', 'day', 'night', 'night', 'week', 'week', 'standard', 'identity', 'was', 'war-mongering', 'empire', 'best', 'send', 'scientist', 'get', 'element', 'East', 'German', 'amateur', 'spy', 'getting', 'secret', 'tricking', 'East', 'German', 'revealing', 'vanity', 'course', 'East', 'German', 'professor', 'been', 'tricked', 'ignoramus', 'slightly', 'too', 'late', 'detail', 'going', 'way', 'situation', 'absurdly', 'upside', 'down', 'impossible', 'elements', 'become', 'kind', 'black', 'very', 'black', 'blacker', 'black', 'humor', 'Blacker', 'die', 'saying', 'could', 'have', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'get', 'good', 'laugh', 'entirely', 'collectivized', 'agriculture', 'East', 'Germany', 'have', 'one', 'farm', 'worker', 'tractor', 'doing', 'nothing', 'middle', 'field', 'alone', 'running', 'around', 'tractor', 'waiting', 'arrival', 'Armstrong', 'tell', 'who', 'what', 'who', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'incredible', 'element', 'film', 'absolutely', 'solitary', 'person', 'regime', 'was', 'based', 'total', 'absence', 'solitude', 'what', 'girl', 'totally', 'isolated', 'farm', 'alone', 'again', 'carelessness', 'not', 'erasing', 'symbolic', 'PI', 'dirt', 'farmyard', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'was', 'solitary', 'farm', 'doing', 'collectivized', 'agriculture', 'escape', 'more', 'laugh', 'sad', 'today', 'be', 'so', 'naively', 'funny', 'Escape', 'escape', 'so', 'thin', 'threads', 'hold', 'up', 'wonder', 'not', 'kind', 'joke', 'best', 'female', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'Armstrong', 'girlfriend', 'middle', 'opera', 'stage', 'limelight', 'overhead', 'lights', 'other', 'lights', 'blaring', 'dazzling', 'light', 'Anyone', 'who', 'knowledge', 'kind', 'situation', 'will', 'say', 'impossible', 'Stage', 'lights', 'are', 'unbreakable', 'cocoon', 'light', 'artists', 'stage', 'Really', 'kind', 'humor', 'everyone', 'go', 'heaven', 'one', 'go', 'now', 'final', 'stages', 'escape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'are', 'too', 'sad', 'fun', 'especially', 'episode', 'highwaymen', 'East', 'German', 'roads', 'was', 'something', 'typical', 'East', 'Germany', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'honesty', 'Stealing', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'crime', 'had', 'be', 'banned', 'forbidden', 'stealing', 'was', 'just', 'foreign', 'minds', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'achievement', 'communist', 'societies', 'ignored', 'crime', 'not', 'was', 'not', 'advertised', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'was', 'so', 'marginal', 'was', 'anachronic', 'mention', 'same', 'time', 'Hitchcock', 'captured', 'traits', 'East', 'German', 'society', 'so', 'well', 'better', 'Goodbye', 'Lenin', 'even', 'mention', 'good', 'coffee', 'so', 'nostalgically', 'true', 'am', 'afraid', 'modern', 'audience', 'might', 'find', 'boring', 'single', 'detail', 'be', 'remembered', 'oblivion.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Paul Newman is either miscast or he decided he wasn't going to do anything with his part.  And the part is stupid to begin with.  Julie Andrews isn't very good either.  I didn't for a minute feel like the character of Armstrong was really defecting--absolutely no suspense or intrigue there.  And so many stupid things happen.  I will only take the time to list a few:  when it is known that Armstrong went to the farm, he admits it and says that he was visiting relatives.  Oh, in all the conversations he had with the East Germans leading up to his defection he never once mentioned that he had relatives in East Germany?  It is so implausible that he would be believed, yet no one questions him.  In the murder scene, the gal hits the legs of the bad guy with a shovel, but then when he continues to fight, she wastes all this effort dragging him and Armstrong over to the stove.  Why didn't she whack the bad guy on the head a few times with the shovel?  And then Armstrong is almost in the oven as much as the bad guy yet seems not to be overcome by the gas.  Later when the security police realize that the bad guy was probably killed on the farm, they go out to investigate.  They are shown digging in grassy areas.  Hello, if the guy had been buried in one of those areas even a week before, you would know it immediately! Then scene after scene of ordinary people becoming suspicious and immediately calling the police and suddenly the place is swarming with cops.  And the whole scene with the lady who wanted a sponsor--stupid and it drags on and on.  Paul Newman looks like he's totally embarrassed in this scene.  And then she takes them to the post office--dressed in her bright clothes which would attract all kinds of notice and then loudly tries to get the attention of every employee and announces the name of the ""secret"" contact loud enough for everyone to hear--so much for being discreet.  And then you guessed it, the place is crawling with cops.  The scene at the theater is also painfully drawn out--and then Armstrong yells ""FIRE""--in English!!!  Even the very first scene of Armstrong and Sarah in bed together goes on and on. There's never any doubt that all will eventually be well, but no one cares--at least I didn't.

66656,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0783235704,Joker,"[2, 4]","For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this Hitchcock movie...Torn Curtain (1966) is a very interesting Hitchcock movie.  Not only because of the fact that Hitchcock made a Cold War spy thriller (whether it was his idea or the studio's), but also because of the time period in which the movie was made and the period it was in Hitch's career.  This movie was made when Hitch was entering the twilight of his career as a movie maker.  It was also the first movie made after Hitch had a falling out with his favorite movie score composer, Bernard Herrmann.  It was also a time when movie audiences' taste in movies started to change, and Hitch was starting to be viewed as ""behind the times"".  It was also a time when Hitch's use of blonde leading ladies was in decline, with his last iconic blonde leading lady 'Tippi' Hedren having had a falling out with Hitch a few years earlier.  It really was the beginning of a new era in Hitch's career, whether he liked it or not.  The end result is a movie that pretty much reflects this new era.  Torn Curtain is not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie, either.  It's average Hitchcock at best.  People either like it or they don't like it, it seems.  I'm in the middle.  The movie has some great moments, but it's on the dull side as well.  A lot of people say there's no chemistry between Paul Newman and Julie Andrews.  I'm not so sure about that.  I think they have adequate chemistry, but it could be better.  Some of the movie drags in places.  Paul Newman comes across as unemotional much of the time, but really this is vintage Paul Newman.  I think his character is supposed to come across this way, anyways.  Both Newman and Andrews try their best in this movie, but compared to other leading men and leading ladies in other Hitchcock movies, they really can't compare to such pairings as Cary Grant/Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant/Grace Kelly, Cary Grant/Eva Marie Saint, Jimmy Stewart/Grace Kelly, Jimmy Stewart/Kim Novak, Rod Taylor/'Tippi' Hedren, etc.  It's not a horrible pairing, but it's not in the same league as the above mentioned pairings.One of the pluses of this movie for me is the fact that it takes me back in time (as most Hitchcock movies do) to a simplertime.  When I see the female flight attendant in this movie, I immediately think of the word ""stewardess"".Overall, not a bad movie.

However, in between those scenes is a ho-hum Cold War story, Snidely Whiplash villans and, most unusual for Hitchcock, technical sloppiness (the scene where Newman tells Andrews he's not really a defector was obviously filmed on a soundstage despite the outdoor location). In addition, Newman and Andrews have very little chemistry onscreen -- it's easy to see why they never worked together again. In addition, Hitchcock made the huge mistake of casting off Bernard Herrmann and his musical score in favor of a more commerical score.

66667,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0783235704,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I believe this was Alfred Hitchcock's 50th film and while it has some interesting stylistic scenes, there are other technical aspects of the film that are glaring weaknesses.  Julie Andrews, fresh off her success in Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Sound of Music,"" was an interesting choice to play the heroine, Sarah.  She is the companion, both professionally and romantically, of Prof. Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman).  They are travelling to Copenhagen for a conference of nuclear physicists.  Newman, in a role usually reserved for Cary Grant or James Stewart, has the acting chops for the role but little of the humor.Armstrong, engaged to Sarah, defects to East Germany without her knowledge.  She follows, which creates additional complications for the couple.  Michael's defection has the premise of the U. S. cancelling his funding on a project that would neutralize atomic weapons.  What he's actually doing is trying to pick the brain of one of a Russian scientist who is working on a similar project.There are a couple memorable scenes in the film which are pure Hitchcock.  In one scene, Michael is trying to ditch his German bodyguard and the pair travel through a large art museum.  One with gigantic ceilings and marble floors.  The museum is empty so all you hear are footsteps.  First following Michael as he makes his way to an exit door.  Then his pursuer.  High camera angles, all very interesting.  In perhaps the most memorable scene, the bodyguard (Wolfgang Kieling) eventually catches up to Michael at a farm house.  This was where Michael meets with a CIA operative.  Michael and Gromek (Kieling) fight to the death.  This is hand to hand combat.  While Gromek would seem to have the advantage, Michael is assisted by the ""wife"" of the farmer/CIA agent.  The struggle goes on for quite a while and involves mostly choking each other rather than throwing punches.  Hitchcock is said to have wanted a scene showing how hard it actually is to kill someone.  He had two musical pieces ready for the scene but ultimately filmed it without music.  That certainly gives the scene an eerie feel.My complaints are mostly with the painted backdrops and very fake looking scenes using patched in shots obviously not done on location.  Even a restaurant scene has a fake looking backdrop.  Hitchcock liked to work on a soundstage and was never keen to shoot on location.  But he seemed to be losing his grip a bit on modern filmmaking.  The actors are credible, the story is interesting but does bog down on occasion.  I would consider ""Torn Curtain"" a modest effort in the Hitchcock legacy.The Blu ray version of this film is a considerable update on previous DVDs.  The 1080p transfer has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good.  Aside from an instance or two of visual ""noise"" there is little to complain about.  Colors and skin tones are lifelike.  Black levels are good.  Some of the jitter in some scenes are the result of the fake backdrops originally used and not the transfer.The audio is also very good.  The disc provides a DTS-HD Master Audio Mono mix.  Everything is crystal clear and is particularly effective in the previously mentioned fight to the death scene at the farm house.  John Addison takes over from Hitchcock's long time musical director Bernard Hermann and provides a fine score for the film.There are Spanish and English SDH subtitles available.  Extras are scant, but there is a 30 minute critique of the film called ""Torn Curtain Rising"" which I found interesting.  Other than that you get a trailer, some photos and scenes shot with Hermann's score before he was fired by Hitchcock.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for a Cold War thriller,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,3630,"['believe', 'was', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '50th', 'film', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'scenes', 'are', 'other', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'glaring', 'weaknesses', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'fresh', 'success', 'Disney', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sound', 'Music', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'play', 'heroine', 'Sarah', 'companion', 'professionally', 'romantically', 'Prof.', 'Michael', 'Armstrong', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'are', 'travelling', 'Copenhagen', 'conference', 'nuclear', 'physicists', 'Newman', 'role', 'usually', 'reserved', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'James', 'Stewart', 'acting', 'chops', 'role', 'little', 'humor.Armstrong', 'engaged', 'Sarah', 'East', 'Germany', 'knowledge', 'additional', 'complications', 'couple', 'Michael', 'defection', 'premise', 'U.', 'S.', 'cancelling', 'funding', 'project', 'would', 'neutralize', 'atomic', 'weapons', 'What', 'actually', 'doing', 'trying', 'pick', 'brain', 'one', 'Russian', 'scientist', 'who', 'working', 'similar', 'project.There', 'are', 'couple', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'pure', 'Hitchcock', 'one', 'scene', 'Michael', 'trying', 'ditch', 'German', 'bodyguard', 'pair', 'travel', 'large', 'art', 'museum', 'One', 'gigantic', 'ceilings', 'marble', 'floors', 'museum', 'empty', 'so', 'all', 'hear', 'are', 'footsteps', 'First', 'following', 'Michael', 'way', 'exit', 'door', 'Then', 'pursuer', 'High', 'camera', 'angles', 'very', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'bodyguard', 'Wolfgang', 'Kieling', 'eventually', 'up', 'Michael', 'farm', 'house', 'was', 'where', 'Michael', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Michael', 'Gromek', 'Kieling', 'fight', 'death', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'Gromek', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'advantage', 'Michael', 'assisted', 'wife', 'farmer/CIA', 'agent', 'struggle', 'while', 'mostly', 'choking', 'other', 'rather', 'throwing', 'punches', 'Hitchcock', 'said', 'have', 'wanted', 'scene', 'showing', 'how', 'hard', 'actually', 'kill', 'someone', 'had', 'two', 'musical', 'pieces', 'ready', 'scene', 'ultimately', 'filmed', 'music', 'certainly', 'scene', 'eerie', 'feel.My', 'complaints', 'are', 'mostly', 'painted', 'backdrops', 'very', 'fake', 'looking', 'scenes', 'using', 'patched', 'shots', 'obviously', 'not', 'done', 'location', 'Even', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'fake', 'looking', 'backdrop', 'Hitchcock', 'liked', 'work', 'soundstage', 'was', 'never', 'keen', 'shoot', 'location', 'seemed', 'be', 'losing', 'grip', 'bit', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'actors', 'are', 'credible', 'story', 'interesting', 'bog', 'down', 'occasion', 'would', 'consider', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'modest', 'effort', 'Hitchcock', 'legacy.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'considerable', 'update', 'previous', 'DVDs', '1080p', 'transfer', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'very', 'good', 'Aside', 'instance', 'two', 'visual', 'noise', 'little', 'complain', 'Colors', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'lifelike', 'Black', 'levels', 'are', 'good', 'jitter', 'scenes', 'are', 'result', 'fake', 'backdrops', 'originally', 'used', 'not', 'transfer.The', 'audio', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'disc', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Mono', 'mix', 'Everything', 'crystal', 'clear', 'particularly', 'effective', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'fight', 'death', 'scene', 'farm', 'house', 'John', 'Addison', 'Hitchcock', 'long', 'time', 'musical', 'director', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'fine', 'score', 'film.There', 'are', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'available', 'Extras', 'are', 'scant', '30', 'minute', 'critique', 'film', 'called', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'Rising', 'found', 'interesting', 'Other', 'get', 'trailer', 'photos', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Hermann', 'score', 'was', 'fired', 'Hitchcock']",N/A

The McGuffin is the trick not the subject.Here, the film is actually suspenseful as Newman and Andrews actually seek to get out of East Berlin.  Though perhaps not as compelling as Hitchcock classics such as North By Northwest, Psycho, or others, the film nonetheless has a lot to recommend for it.Some have mentioned here that the fim has some unbelievable elements.  I would disagree, The film itself does not set out to be world-shattering.  It is simply a fun exercise.  Beautiful scenery, an exciting chase, intrigue, gorgeous people, a Hitchcock sighting, good music - what else would you be looking for in a film.Having really never seen too many Paul Newman or Julie Andrews films, I'll be sure to watch more from now on.As for criticisms, my only one is that having been to Communist Berlin, I can only say that this film makes the place look too nice.

66672,A14SOHUCCL0606,0783235704,Nowhere Man,"[3, 10]","I've read a lot of reviews trying to rehabilitate this mid-60's Hitchcock film from the dustbin into which history has thrown it.  The film has all the elements that go into a Hitchcock classic: that high-toned gloss that he perfected in such 50s films as &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Rear Window&quot;; a servicable plot that allows for potential suspense set pieces; and the sure use of location which made &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; so intriguing.But the film is like soda pop left open too long: all the ingredients, no fizz. Hitch's staging is way off here - the film is slow at the start and it never shakes this lethargy.  Paul Newman plays an American scientist defecting, supposedly, to East Berlin and Julie Andrews, his financee, follows him there.  There's no banter or rapport between these two, unlike say Robert Donat and Madeline Carroll in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; or Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in &quot;North by Northwest.&quot;  Newman looks miserable here; he's drawn-in and remote; naturally, his character has to remain guarded but Newman closes the audience off too.  It was rumored that he and Hitchcock frequently fought on the set and Newman, who can be sly and witty, is defensive throughout.  He seemed a lot happier working on a prison farm in his subsequent film, &quot;Cool Hand Luke.&quot;As for Julie Andrews, she has nothing to do.  Hitch sets us up to believe that her pursuing Newman into East Germany will trigger the action but its really an event totally unrelated to her - the murder of Gromek - that sets the story off.  While Janet Leigh was cleverly set up as a MacGuffin in &quot;Psycho&quot;; here this strange enervation of Julie Andrews' role seems like poor plotting (and the interview scene at Leipzig Univ. a paltry attempt to correct this).Hitchcock piles up the bad calls throughout.  In his best films, you may have seen how Hitchcock was manipulating the story (and your emotions) but his style made it a perverse pleasure - witness Grace Kelly's breaking into Raymond Burr's apartment in &quot;Rear Window.&quot;  Here the wit and style are missing so the suspense mechanisms are laid bare.  When Newman is racing against the clock to obtain a secret formula from an East German scientist, you know your heart should be pounding.  But all I was thinking was... you mean that's it? Two actors writing mathematical formulas on a blackboard?  And in the big escape from Leipzig, Hitchcock shows that it would take another 28 years, with &quot;Speed&quot;, for a bus to be used as a dramatic intensifer.Despite what its defenders claim, &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; is a failure; only the incomprehensible &quot;Topaz&quot; is worse.  Its not just that this Cold War story seems especially moldly today; but what really kills it is the lack of any apparent conviction by anyone involved. A couple mildly suspensful scenes - and I'm sorry, the murder of Gromek is *not* the masterly set-piece that its often claimed to be - do not compensate for this thin gruel.  Buy it if you're a Hitchcock completist but you're money would be better spent buying a second copy of &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (or &quot;The Rules of the Game.&quot;)",2,"For completists only...

In Europe you had Nouvelle Vague pouring out of France and comparable new styles coming from Sweden (Bergman) and Italy (Fellini, Antonioni).In the US the Actors' Studio was changing the style of acting completely.  Out was the old, glib, surface charm of the fifties, where Hitchock thrived and who actors such as Cary Grant shone.  Paul Newman, coming out of Actors'Studio was wonderful in intense psychological dramas.  He certainly has the looks and natural charm to make a splash in this film, but it obviously wasn't his style.  He wanted to know what made his character say a certain line and Hitchcock replied ""because it's written in the script, dear boy.""  Obviously the two were not on the same page and it really shows in this movie.  Newman gives the worst performance I've ever seen him give.Perhaps no one really had their heart in it.  Hitchcock is reported not to have wanted to make it but did it only at the insistence of the studio.  Apparently the studio wanted Julie Andrews, who was hot at the time, although Hitchcock didn't want her.  That was a huge mistake.  Hitchcock loved his beautiful actresses and got great performances out of them.  Andrews just doesn't have the looks, or the charisma to make us believe that the Newman character would ever want to be on the same screen with her, let alone the same bed.  The dreadful hairstyle and terrible dreary wardrobe certainly didn't help. (As another reviewer said, Hud met Maria von Trapp!)  (or Mary Poppins). I think that if a more appealing actress had been cast, that the whole film might have come alive.The supporting cast is terrific, though.  The fellow who plays the original bodyguard, Gropek, is very funny with his American slang. Why do Eastern European villains wear those awful black leather coats?  The famous farmhouse scene was hilarious, too.  Carolyn Conwell who played the heroic farmer's wife was really wonderful.  Some people felt the Leipzig professor was too over-the-top and I can see that, although I did enjoy him, especially in the restaurant, when he happened to mention, while a Viennese waltz was playing, that his sister was hit by a tram in Vienna.  Lila Kedrova as the Polish countess was almost too good for the film.  Her performance was so deeply moving that it broke through the surface of the film.  She and Newman belong in their own film.When you think of other Cold War spy films, this is so poor.  None of it is convincing, so it fails on that level, too.

There are lots of stories around it - Paul Newman and Julie Andrews were not among Hitch's favorites (he insisted on using favorites like Cary Grant and Gregory Peck), but he had to yield to pressure from Universal to use top stars of the time. He wanted a light hearted comedy on the lines of North by Northwest but studio did not think the theme was suited to elements of comedy (which was perhaps true). Newman had a very casual, american style and Hitch was used to more formality and respect as he saw it - that turned him off at once. Julie Andrews was English herself but still she did not find Hitchcock's style appealing either - she thought he treated actors like 'pieces of furniture'. Further there was no real chemistry between Andrews and Newman although it does not seem obvious but both did not vibe well or enjoy each other's styles of acting. But they were professionals and turn out a stellar performance. Some of Hitch's great directorial touches are in the bus scene, the murder in the cottage and the final scene when Newman's identity is revealed.

Not only does it move too slowly, but there are so many scenes that don't ring true, either wildly improbable or unrealistic in their mechanics.  There were a number of incidents that gradually diminished the credibility of the film until I was just waiting for it to get over with.First of all, how could ANdrews have gotten on an airplane for East Germany without a visa?  Perhaps this is an anachroinistic question, but without a return ticket at least she would have been questioned.  Second, how could a trained security policeman both follow Newman into the countryside right after his arrival without radioing it in immediately (it is a totalitarian state, afterall) and then allow a university professor to off him so easily?  He is a trained killer.  This badly underestimates the lock control of a police state.  Third, when Newman is trying to escape the university, it appears that he stumbles into the correct room, where help is waiting, this after he is forced to change course.  That is way too awkward for what we expect from Hitchcock.  Fourth, how could they ever have gotten past the check points?  Newman surely would have been recognized.  Moreover, how could the robber army guys ever have controlled their own territory?  Fifth, how could the escape network people have kept themselves secret and safe?  How could they be ""non-political""?  How could the authorities have shot at them in the street without the city shutting down?THese questions being asked, there are a number of nice twists in the film.  That fact that ANdrews unexpectedly came along adds a fun dimension, the spy having to escape with a fiancee.  She is the most original character in the whole thing.  The executive east German security professionals are also menacing in subtle ways, even if their bag men are rather bumbling.  THere are plenty of nice moments of suspense, such as the double bus problem.  The desperate, somewhat crazy woman was also well acted, as her indiscretions nearly doomed the pair while helping them.

66682,A16QODENBJVUI1,0783235704,Robert Moore,"[1, 3]","TORN CURTAIN is widely considered to be one of Hitchcock's worst films, definitely one of his worst films after moving to the United States in 1939.  An initial viewing of the film tends to underwhelm.  But after seeing this again for the first time after several years, I was mildly surprised at how decent it was.  Good?  No.  It is certainly not a good film by any standards.  But neither is it a bad film.The film was hurt both by a poor script and weak casting.  Paul Newman was a great actor, but he was simply inappropriate for the lead in this film.  He could be many things in various roles, but he simply was not convincing as a nuclear physicist.  Julie Andrews in the film was a needless decoration, adding very little to it in any way and Hitchcock was very open about her being one of his least favorite leads.There are a number of decent scenes and interesting moments.  Hitchcock is not widely regarded as an experimental filmmaker or an avant-garde director, but in fact, throughout his career he was constantly trying out new techniques and new technology.  For instance, in THE BIRDS he used, in conjunction with composer Bernard Hermann, an extremely early version of the synthesizer, perhaps the first time it was used in any film.  In TORN CURTAIN, Hitchcock wanted to emphasize the recognition of Newman's character in a theater by a ballerina.  He used an unusual freeze frame technique.  As the ballerina, who had met Newman and Andrews on a flight into East Berlin, pirouettes, the film is briefly frozen as she looks out into the crowd.  There is also an excellent scene in which a fake bus, which has left ten minutes earlier than a real bus, is overtaken by the latter.But the highlight of the film, and one of the most memorable death scenes in any Hitchcock film, is the killing of the German agent in a small farmhouse in the East German countryside.  In a scene in which Hitchcock wants to show how difficult it is to kill someone, Newman and the woman who lives in the house struggle over the course of several minutes to kill him.  There is some great cutting reminiscent of the best moments of the shower scene in PSYCHO.  It shows that even in some of his weakest films he could still do some remarkable things.",3,Not as bad as widely thought,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,2248,"['TORN', 'CURTAIN', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'worst', 'films', 'definitely', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'moving', 'United', 'States', '1939', 'initial', 'viewing', 'film', 'underwhelm', 'seeing', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'mildly', 'surprised', 'how', 'decent', 'was', 'Good', 'No', 'certainly', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'standards', 'bad', 'film.The', 'film', 'was', 'hurt', 'poor', 'script', 'weak', 'casting', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'simply', 'inappropriate', 'lead', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'various', 'roles', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'convincing', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'film', 'was', 'needless', 'decoration', 'adding', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'very', 'open', 'being', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'are', 'number', 'decent', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'moments', 'Hitchcock', 'not', 'widely', 'regarded', 'experimental', 'filmmaker', 'avant-garde', 'director', 'fact', 'career', 'was', 'constantly', 'trying', 'out', 'new', 'techniques', 'new', 'technology', 'instance', 'BIRDS', 'used', 'conjunction', 'composer', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'extremely', 'early', 'version', 'synthesizer', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'TORN', 'CURTAIN', 'Hitchcock', 'wanted', 'emphasize', 'recognition', 'Newman', 'character', 'theater', 'ballerina', 'used', 'unusual', 'freeze', 'frame', 'technique', 'ballerina', 'who', 'had', 'met', 'Newman', 'Andrews', 'flight', 'East', 'Berlin', 'film', 'briefly', 'frozen', 'out', 'crowd', 'also', 'excellent', 'scene', 'fake', 'bus', 'left', 'ten', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'real', 'bus', 'overtaken', 'latter.But', 'highlight', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'death', 'scenes', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'killing', 'German', 'agent', 'small', 'farmhouse', 'East', 'German', 'countryside', 'scene', 'Hitchcock', 'show', 'how', 'difficult', 'kill', 'someone', 'Newman', 'woman', 'who', 'house', 'struggle', 'course', 'several', 'minutes', 'kill', 'great', 'cutting', 'reminiscent', 'best', 'moments', 'shower', 'scene', 'PSYCHO', 'even', 'weakest', 'films', 'could', 'still', 'do', 'remarkable', 'things']",N/A

Not wishing to involve her, he lets her think he's a traitor, but when her confusion jeopardizes his position, he tells her the truth... Overjoyed, she helps him, and they end up in a series of chases and escapes...Newman does come across as unemotional, or at least not very warm; in fact, critics complained that he was too intense and gloomy in a part that they thought required humor... But coldness and seriousness are actually essential to the character and to Hitchcock's conception...Initially, we are supposed to share Andrews' alienation from him... Later, when we learn that he's not a traitor, we may want to view him differently, but immediately afterward he commits a gruesome killing, of a most likable villain, which again distances us from him... From that point, even though he's apparently the ""hero,"" his actions are never purely motivated... His attitude toward Andrews is indicative: by following him, she endangers herself, which concerns him slightly, but she also endangers the mission, which is what really troubles him...Hitchcock, therefore, is portraying an anti-hero--not a glamorous spy, patriotically following his country's orders, or an innocent, sympathetic victim (Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest""), but a man on his own, deliberately pursuing a selfish goal (the formula might get him back his job).Newman is therefore well-cast: his indifferent rejection of the woman, his ruthlessness, his willingness to endanger lives and engender chaos, are familiar aspects of the Newman image...

His superb knack for creating suspence and tension is evident from the first frame and makes for a terrific piece of film making. Once the story gets going the pace and suspence never lets up as  the main characters move from Norway to Copenhagen to East Berlin behind the Iron Curtain, hence the title. I feel Paul Newman and Julie Andrews...at first thought  not an expected combination, work extremely well together and come across as a believable combination. Julie Andrews certainly doesn't have as flashy a role in ""Torn Curtain"" as she does in ""The Sound of Music"" ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" or ""Star"" but she nevertheless handles her role of Sarah Sherman, personal secretary to the brilliant rocket scientist Professor Michael Armstrong (Newman),in a most interesting manner. Julie is always such an attractive performer and in ""Torn Curtain"" she gives her all in what is essentially a difficult role and one fraught with lots of unpredictable situations.The story line of Paul Newman's character pretending to defect to East Germany to obtain valuable information on a new secret formula from a scientist in Leipzeig might appear dated now but it makes for a very clever and fast moving story. Newman's character pretends to go over to the Eastern Bloc only to discover that Andrews has followed him out of not only love but to see what he is actually up to. Their time in East Berlin is action packed and colorful to say the least as they encounter ""personal guides"" such as the infamous Gromek, the sweaty, gum chewing villian of the piece who ends up being murdered in one of the most memorable and painstaking murder sequences of Alfred Hitchcock's career aside from the shower sequence in ""Psycho"". It is a totally awe inspiring moment and while I dont like violence for violence sake this sequence is magnificently done, with no dialogue, and is easily, along with the nail biting bus chase, the most memorable part of the film and indeed in Hitchcock's career.Hitchcock not only keeps the action moving at a break neck pace but he also populates his story with many interesting characters along the way as Newman and Andrews plan their escape from East Germany when they are exposed. One memorable character is the Polish Countess Kuchinska played by actress Lila Kedrova, who only wants a sponsor to be able to get to the United States.

Equally memorable is Check ballet dancer Tamara Toumanova who reappears  a few times in the story and is almost responsible for intercepting the main characters escape. She is excellent in what is essentially a small but stand out part.The overraul look of the film benefits from the many beautiful European locations utilised during filming and although East Berlin was impossible to film in circa 1966, an excellent use of similiar locations has been incorporated to give the effect of the dull and uninteresting Eastern Bloc existence.As a piece of entertainment dealing with the Cold War ""Torn Curtain"" is first rate and never fails to be a great piece of viewing entertainment with two terrific performers in Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in the leads.",4,Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in an interesting combination,1021507200,"05 16, 2002",2002,3715,"['really', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'great', 'little', 'film', 'superbly', 'tense', 'story', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'always', 'dismissed', 'disappointment.On', 'contrary', 'always', 'been', 'favourite', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'mine', 'certainly', 'not', 'standards', 'classic', 'Rebecca', 'even', 'North', 'Northwest', 'still', 'tense', 'piece', 'film', 'making.It', 'was', 'Hichcock', '50th', 'film', 'certainly', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'truly', 'good', 'films', 'directed', 'illustrious', 'career', 'superb', 'knack', 'creating', 'suspence', 'tension', 'evident', 'first', 'frame', 'terrific', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'story', 'going', 'pace', 'suspence', 'never', 'up', 'main', 'characters', 'move', 'Norway', 'Copenhagen', 'East', 'Berlin', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'hence', 'title', 'feel', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'first', 'thought', 'not', 'expected', 'combination', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'together', 'come', 'believable', 'combination', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'flashy', 'role', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Thoroughly', 'Modern', 'Millie', 'Star', 'nevertheless', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Sherman', 'personal', 'secretary', 'brilliant', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'Professor', 'Michael', 'Armstrong', 'Newman', 'most', 'interesting', 'manner', 'Julie', 'always', 'such', 'attractive', 'performer', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'what', 'essentially', 'difficult', 'role', 'one', 'fraught', 'lots', 'unpredictable', 'situations.The', 'story', 'line', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'character', 'pretending', 'defect', 'East', 'Germany', 'obtain', 'valuable', 'information', 'new', 'secret', 'formula', 'scientist', 'Leipzeig', 'might', 'appear', 'dated', 'now', 'very', 'clever', 'fast', 'moving', 'story', 'Newman', 'character', 'go', 'Eastern', 'Bloc', 'only', 'discover', 'Andrews', 'followed', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'see', 'what', 'actually', 'up', 'time', 'East', 'Berlin', 'action', 'packed', 'colorful', 'say', 'least', 'encounter', 'personal', 'guides', 'such', 'infamous', 'Gromek', 'sweaty', 'gum', 'chewing', 'villian', 'piece', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'murdered', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'painstaking', 'murder', 'sequences', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'career', 'aside', 'shower', 'sequence', 'Psycho', 'totally', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'moment', 'dont', 'violence', 'violence', 'sake', 'sequence', 'magnificently', 'done', 'dialogue', 'easily', 'nail', 'biting', 'bus', 'chase', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'indeed', 'Hitchcock', 'career.Hitchcock', 'not', 'only', 'action', 'moving', 'break', 'neck', 'pace', 'also', 'story', 'many', 'interesting', 'characters', 'way', 'Newman', 'Andrews', 'plan', 'escape', 'East', 'Germany', 'when', 'are', 'exposed', 'One', 'memorable', 'character', 'Polish', 'Countess', 'Kuchinska', 'played', 'actress', 'Lila', 'Kedrova', 'who', 'only', 'sponsor', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'United', 'States', 'tragic', 'thought', 'provoking', 'interlude', 'main', 'characters', 'race', 'beat', 'German', 'authorities', 'border', 'Equally', 'memorable', 'Check', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Tamara', 'Toumanova', 'who', 'few', 'times', 'story', 'almost', 'responsible', 'intercepting', 'main', 'characters', 'escape', 'excellent', 'what', 'essentially', 'small', 'stand', 'out', 'part.The', 'overraul', 'look', 'film', 'benefits', 'many', 'beautiful', 'European', 'locations', 'utilised', 'filming', 'East', 'Berlin', 'was', 'impossible', 'film', 'circa', '1966', 'excellent', 'use', 'similiar', 'locations', 'been', 'incorporated', 'give', 'effect', 'dull', 'uninteresting', 'Eastern', 'Bloc', 'existence.As', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'dealing', 'Cold', 'War', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'first', 'rate', 'never', 'be', 'great', 'piece', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'two', 'terrific', 'performers', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'leads']",N/A

66696,AP3B615GM191G,0783235704,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 4]","In my opinion, great (or even just good) movies must contain some facet that goes above and beyond the other fare, whether that rests with the characters, plot, direction, or any number of different things.  ""Torn Curtain"", despite being a Hitchcock production, stands out in absolutely no area.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on the unexpected defection of American scientist Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) to Soviet Russia.  He is followed by his assistant (and subsequent love interest) Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews) as she tries to ascertain the reasons for his strange behavior.There is nothing abhorrently wrong with the overall plot of this movie, but it just doesn't generate any excitement in any facet of the experience.  It is a very typical ""Cold War spy"" tale that could have been written by anyone from amateur to seasoned film veteran.  Seeing Hitch's name attached to such a pedestrian project makes one pause considering his other incredible works.The only thing that can save a mediocre plot, of course, is terrific acting, and this film fails to deliver that piece of the puzzle as well.  Newman is decent as the leading man, but Andrews is pretty much a blank slate as the female lead.  I don't even think it is the ""Mary Poppins/Sound of Music"" typecast bias here, either.  Her role is just not crafted very well at all in the script.Overall, then, ""Torn Curtain"" is one of the poorer Hitchcock movies I've seen (even the middling ""Topaz"" packs more thrills than this one).
