I admit that when I found out about a new Final Destination film I couldn't wait to watch it and it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me. When I watched it, I was letdown. It wasn't that interesting or entertaining, it was somewhat boring compared to the first 4. It was slow and lacking in suspense that made the first 4 films. It isn't better than The 4th film, not even half as good.",2,"Disapointing,",1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,514,"['4th', 'film', 'was', 'labeled', 'Final', 'Destination', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'final', 'chapter', 'series', 'admit', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'new', 'Final', 'Destination', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movies', 'year', 'When', 'watched', 'was', 'letdown', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'was', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'compared', 'first', '4', 'was', 'slow', 'lacking', 'suspense', 'made', 'first', '4', 'films', ""n't"", 'better', '4th', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'half', 'good']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)
1404045,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B004EPZ08O,A. Estes,"[3, 6]","Try as you might, you just can't beat Death. For over ten years, the ""Final Destination"" franchise has weathered a wave of remakes and torture flicks to become one of the most wild and inventive (not to mention, profitable) horror series of its time. Unfortunately the series went stale rather quickly, culminating in 2009's underwhelming fourth and ""final"" installment, ""brilliantly"" titled ""THE Final Destination."" But just as Jason and Freddy taught us oh so many years ago, you can't keep a good franchise down. In that spirit, a mere two years later, ""Final Destination 5"" is upon us. Can a fifth installment in the series make up for the sins of its predecessor while keeping things fresh and original, not to mention faithful, to its origins? The answer is a surprising ""Yes.""The plot this time revolves around a group of co-workers on their way to a company retreat. A handful of them manage to survive a colossal bridge collapse thanks to the unexplainable premonition of Sam (Nick A'Gosto), who is nice enough to save his cold-hearted girlfriend (Emma Bell) just minutes after dumping him. What a guy. In true ""Final Destination"" fashion, things take a turn for the worse as Death comes calling for the group, picking them off one by one in unimaginably brutal and outlandish ways. Back in the picture is the morbid mortician played by Tony Todd to enlighten the group about death's design, leading a member of the group to take matters into his own hands. Now not only do the remaining survivors have death on their back, but they also have to be cautious of each other and even of themselves.First time director Steven Quale gives the series a serious shot in the arm after the previous two installments (tackled by original Final Destination director James Wong and Final Destination 2 director David R. Ellis, respectively) lowered the bar both visually and story-wise. Quale, who has spent a considerable amount of his career working under James Cameron, obviously has a keen sense of humor as well as dread, and it shows through in what is not only the series' most insane and over-the-top installment, but also one of the most intense as well. Not only is the film gruesome and gross, but it is also grim and unpredictable to boot. The script, penned by Eric Heisserer (whose credits include 2010's less than stellar ""Elm Street"" remake and the upcoming ""The Thing"" prequel), freshens up the formula quite a bit, adding dimension to characters and giving the third act some much needed tension. Not only does the ending take a left-turn for once, but it also serves to wrap the series up in a nice bow, complete with a montage set to the tune of AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood, You Got It."" Add to that a batch of well-executed 3D effects and you've got a package that just can't be beat.Sure, it's still pretty formulaic at its heart, but ""Final Destination 5"" has enough tricks up its sleeve to surprise and satisfy those seeking a genuine roller-coaster ride of horror. No sequel could ever hope to top the 2000 original (which was pretty unique in its time) but this one comes about as close as possible. Go into it expecting a gory and gross good time that plays with your expectations and you'll have a good time. It's rare a horror film comes along these days that does its job this efficiently, so enjoy it while you can.",4,Death Springs Back To Life,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,3342,"['Try', 'might', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Death', 'ten', 'years', 'Final', 'Destination', 'franchise', 'weathered', 'wave', 'remakes', 'torture', 'flicks', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'wild', 'inventive', 'not', 'mention', 'profitable', 'horror', 'series', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'went', 'stale', 'rather', 'quickly', 'culminating', '2009', 'underwhelming', 'fourth', 'final', 'installment', 'brilliantly', 'titled', 'Final', 'Destination', 'just', 'Jason', 'Freddy', 'taught', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'good', 'franchise', 'down', 'spirit', 'mere', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Final', 'Destination', '5', 'Can', 'fifth', 'installment', 'series', 'make', 'up', 'sins', 'predecessor', 'keeping', 'things', 'fresh', 'original', 'not', 'mention', 'faithful', 'origins', 'answer', 'surprising', 'Yes', 'plot', 'time', 'group', 'co-workers', 'way', 'company', 'retreat', 'handful', 'manage', 'survive', 'colossal', 'bridge', 'collapse', 'thanks', 'unexplainable', 'premonition', 'Sam', 'Nick', ""A'Gosto"", 'who', 'nice', 'enough', 'save', 'cold-hearted', 'girlfriend', 'Emma', 'Bell', 'just', 'minutes', 'dumping', 'What', 'guy', 'true', 'Final', 'Destination', 'fashion', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'Death', 'calling', 'group', 'picking', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'unimaginably', 'brutal', 'outlandish', 'ways', 'Back', 'picture', 'morbid', 'mortician', 'played', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'enlighten', 'group', 'death', 'design', 'leading', 'member', 'group', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Now', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'have', 'death', 'back', 'also', 'have', 'be', 'cautious', 'other', 'even', 'themselves.First', 'time', 'director', 'Steven', 'Quale', 'series', 'serious', 'shot', 'arm', 'previous', 'two', 'installments', 'tackled', 'original', 'Final', 'Destination', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'director', 'David', 'R.', 'Ellis', 'respectively', 'lowered', 'bar', 'visually', 'story-wise', 'Quale', 'who', 'spent', 'considerable', 'amount', 'career', 'working', 'James', 'Cameron', 'obviously', 'keen', 'sense', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'dread', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'series', 'most', 'insane', 'over-the-top', 'installment', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'gruesome', 'gross', 'also', 'grim', 'unpredictable', 'boot', 'script', 'penned', 'Eric', 'Heisserer', 'credits', 'include', '2010', 'less', 'stellar', 'Elm', 'Street', 'remake', 'upcoming', 'Thing', 'prequel', 'up', 'formula', 'quite', 'bit', 'adding', 'dimension', 'characters', 'giving', 'third', 'act', 'much', 'needed', 'tension', 'Not', 'only', 'ending', 'take', 'left-turn', 'once', 'also', 'wrap', 'series', 'up', 'nice', 'bow', 'complete', 'montage', 'set', 'tune', 'AC/DC', 'Want', 'Blood', 'Got', 'Add', 'that', 'batch', 'well-executed', '3D', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'got', 'package', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat.Sure', 'still', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'heart', 'Final', 'Destination', '5', 'enough', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'surprise', 'satisfy', 'seeking', 'genuine', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'horror', 'sequel', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'top', '2000', 'original', 'was', 'pretty', 'unique', 'time', 'one', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'Go', 'expecting', 'gory', 'gross', 'good', 'time', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'rare', 'horror', 'film', 'days', 'job', 'efficiently', 'so', 'enjoy', 'can']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

This time around, a bunch of coworkers are saved from a collapsing bridge when one of them has an eerie premonition, and Death slowly hunts them down, one by one.

1404054,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004EPZ08O,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I never tire of the Final Destination series, AHHH!!!I really don't.  It's a winning formula to me.  Cheat death, think you've miraculously survived, only to find out later that you were SUPPOSED to die!  Your death was planned out ahead of time unbeknownst to you!  Everything happens for a reason!However let's be totally honest, this is the worst one in the series by far.  Wanna know why?  Well for one thing, by now we all realize that the lack of storytelling is because there's no actual way to improve upon the writing.  This is why all the lines delivered by the characters are short and sweet, and really generic and predictable- we've already HEARD this story four times already!  The movie writers didn't even bother to elaborate on the ""been there, done that"" aspect of the storyline.  That's why, for example, the teens pretty much figure out that they're supposed to die in the exact order that the one teen envisioned without any further elaboration!  The movie writers expect that you already KNOW this!  That's actually a dead giveaway (har har!) that it's time to stop the series altogether however...Me being me, and loving (and craving!) the apparent endless ways to graphically kill the teenagers who missed destiny's call, I can't help but sit through another one of these films and *enjoy* it.  Since I already fully understand the way the movie writers build the suspense, the best thing I can hope for is a build up to a graphic, violent and tragic death... which this movie executes just splendidly!  It's also obvious the movie writers are trying hard to make the deaths more violent by the way the blood and the body part-chopping is more plentiful than ever.So... I like the movie.  Sorry!This doesn't excuse the horribly bland, exaggerated, and terrible writing that is the airplane segment at the end though.  Take what's already been shown several times in other movies (that being, an airplane splitting in half and the people flying off and clinging onto the remaining parts for their lives) and make it to the point of total exaggeration so you're laughing at it instead of feeling fear.

And, really, I liked 3 for the creativity, especially the tanning salon, the train, the truck engine, and the nail gun deaths. All of that was great.I really think that 5, while clearly more intelligent, psychological, and well-written and acted than any of the others, bar none, still lacks what I thought made 2, which is IMO the best in the whole series, stand out: Suspense, brutality, and of course, Clear Rivers, the only person to survive the original FD, but not unscathed, to say the least.See, 5's deaths are just not all that interesting. When you compare them to what happened in the far more brutal 2 and 3, they just aren't as interesting. I didn't find any of them particularly memorable (except the very last, of course, which is a huge WHAM of an ending that you might even see coming from a few hints in the beginning), and I can't agree that the eye surgery scene was that gruesome. Yes, we get Bludworth again, and this time his role really means something. We also get another suspicious cop who thinks the whole thing is screwed up (which, if you don't know the ending of this one, you can't understand why he doesn't sympathize like the other cop in FD2), and the film seems to take itself seriously for once.Like video game exploits that are patched up after release, the FD series seems to add some new mechanic that can potentially foil Death's plan. This time, though, that *really* makes for a killer ending. (As they say, love makes you crazy...especially when you're doomed to die, anyway.)In any case, if you want to rinse out the sourness from 4 which practically turned it into a violent and stupid comedy, 5 is definitely the ticket you're looking for. It's hard to imagine that they would have anywhere else to go with this series, since everything was supposed to have already played out in 4, but they managed to get more in there with 5 in a special way...What else is there? If they did any more, none of the other films would really make sense. So, while I'd love to see another, unless they really find a creative story to throw in there with a brilliant new mechanic, I don't think we'll be seeing another FD again.A very solid replacement ""conclusion"" of sorts to a series that initially ended on a very meh note.",4,"Highly intelligent ""conclusion"" for the series",1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,2451,"[""'d"", 'like', 'first', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'FD', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'crazy', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', '4', 'was', 'disaster', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', '*that*', 'bad', 'really', 'liked', '3', 'creativity', 'especially', 'tanning', 'salon', 'train', 'truck', 'engine', 'nail', 'gun', 'deaths', 'was', 'great.I', 'really', 'think', '5', 'clearly', 'more', 'intelligent', 'psychological', 'well-written', 'acted', 'others', 'bar', 'none', 'still', 'what', 'thought', 'made', '2', 'IMO', 'best', 'whole', 'series', 'stand', 'out', 'Suspense', 'brutality', 'course', 'Clear', 'Rivers', 'only', 'person', 'survive', 'original', 'FD', 'not', 'unscathed', 'say', 'least.See', '5', 'deaths', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'When', 'compare', 'what', 'happened', 'far', 'more', 'brutal', '2', '3', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'very', 'last', 'course', 'huge', 'WHAM', 'ending', 'might', 'even', 'see', 'coming', 'few', 'hints', 'beginning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'eye', 'surgery', 'scene', 'was', 'gruesome', 'Yes', 'get', 'Bludworth', 'again', 'time', 'role', 'really', 'something', 'also', 'get', 'suspicious', 'cop', 'who', 'whole', 'thing', 'screwed', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ending', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'other', 'cop', 'FD2', 'film', 'take', 'seriously', 'once.Like', 'video', 'game', 'are', 'patched', 'up', 'release', 'FD', 'series', 'add', 'new', 'mechanic', 'can', 'potentially', 'foil', 'Death', 'plan', 'time', 'though', '*really*', 'killer', 'ending', 'say', 'love', 'crazy', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'doomed', 'die', 'anyway', 'case', 'want', 'rinse', 'out', 'sourness', '4', 'practically', 'turned', 'violent', 'stupid', 'comedy', '5', 'definitely', 'ticket', ""'re"", 'looking', 'hard', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'anywhere', 'else', 'go', 'series', 'everything', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'already', 'played', 'out', '4', 'managed', 'get', 'more', '5', 'special', 'way', 'What', 'else', 'there', 'did', 'more', 'none', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'So', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'really', 'find', 'creative', 'story', 'throw', 'there', 'brilliant', 'new', 'mechanic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'FD', 'again.A', 'very', 'solid', 'replacement', 'conclusion', 'sorts', 'series', 'initially', 'ended', 'very', 'meh', 'note']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

I heard it started going downhill after and I'm starting to believe it. If people are willing to give this movie a 5 star review then that can only mean the last two must have been extremely awful because this one is the easily and by far the worst Final Destination movie I've seen. Let me rephrase that: this is the only Final Destination movie I've seen that I didn't like. If you've seen the first and the second (or just the first is enough), then you won't be surprised, you won't be engaged, you won't even be interested in knowing what happens next as it's so obvious. Characters are uninteresting and straightforward. Movie does not even attempt to add anything extra to the series and seem to be more like a remake (or spiritual replacement) of the first movie. Put it this way, story and character wise is plain boring (unless this is your first entry into the series).With all that said, reason why I'm giving this a 2 star compared to a 1 star is the first action scene and the 3D effects. Both were pretty well. The first scene won't blow your mind away but it was definitively entertaining to watch. The use of 3D effects really added a lot to the scenes of interest and I think it had one of the best uses of it. Although out of the movie, maybe you get 15-20 minutes of good 3d action.Conclusion: If you watched the first or the second movie and you don't care about 3d, I highly recommend skipping this movie. Not worth your time. If you've never watched a Final Destination movie then this one could be interesting for you.

1404065,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004EPZ08O,Dark Faerie Tales,"[1, 5]","The Review:It's another Final Destination movie. Along with the Saw franchise, this is one of Hollywood's old standbys that's ridden a pretty original idea into the ground-well not all the way into the ground. It still manages to be fun as long as you manage your expectations.The Final Destination formula is the same. Right before a major disaster -- think plane crash, roller coaster, huge traffic accident -- the protagonist has a vivid premonition of things to come. Right after he or she sees their own death they snap back to a point right before the disaster and warn their friends to get off of, or out of whatever, or wherever the disaster is about to strike. The twist is that death doesn't like to be cheated and through a series of gory Rube Goldberg like accidents, it will claim the lives of anyone who escaped the initial disaster. The protagonist and his circle of friends take a little while to catch on, but inevitably the series of improbable deaths of everyone who escaped the initial disaster clues the dwindling survivors in. At this point some contrivance is discovered by which the remaining survivors might be able to cheat death.I've just described the plot of every Final Destination film, which is kind of why I'll never recommend you watch any of the later films for the storytelling. The premise of the Final Destination films was fresh until the second sequel. Final Destination is now about one thing and one thing only. That is the insane, weird, and horrible ways in which the cast is killed off. It is a fundamentally shallow movie going experience. There is very little character development, and no proper villain, unless a concept like death can be a villain. This lack of a villain has always made the Final Destination films less about horror than about shock value. Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch and Ring had moments of real terror. Final Destination relies exclusively on shock value. It's a subtle difference, but why, at least in this viewer's opinion, it's not going to rank up there with movies like the aforementioned Paranormal Activity or the more recent Insidious.Now, while this review has not been glowing, I did in fact have a good time with Final Destination 5. A huge part of that was I saw the film in 3D and the film was shot in 3D. I have also seen all the other movies in the franchise and knew what to expect and what not to expect. In other words, I managed my expectations. Hopefully, this is in fact the final Final Destination, and if it is, the filmmakers have given the series a decent, and even clever ending. I recommend this one for fans of the series and if you do see it, I highly recommend you watch the 3D version.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",2,Dead Is Coming...Again!,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,2738,"['Review', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movie', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'old', 'standbys', 'ridden', 'pretty', 'original', 'idea', 'ground-well', 'not', 'way', 'ground', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'as', 'long', 'manage', 'expectations.The', 'Final', 'Destination', 'formula', 'same', 'Right', 'major', 'disaster', 'think', 'plane', 'crash', 'roller', 'coaster', 'huge', 'traffic', 'accident', 'protagonist', 'vivid', 'premonition', 'things', 'come', 'Right', 'own', 'death', 'snap', 'back', 'point', 'right', 'disaster', 'warn', 'friends', 'get', 'whatever', 'wherever', 'disaster', 'strike', 'twist', 'death', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'cheated', 'series', 'gory', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'accidents', 'will', 'claim', 'lives', 'anyone', 'who', 'escaped', 'initial', 'disaster', 'protagonist', 'circle', 'friends', 'take', 'little', 'catch', 'inevitably', 'series', 'improbable', 'deaths', 'everyone', 'who', 'escaped', 'initial', 'disaster', 'dwindling', 'survivors', 'point', 'contrivance', 'discovered', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'cheat', 'death.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'described', 'plot', 'Final', 'Destination', 'film', 'kind', 'why', ""'ll"", 'never', 'recommend', 'watch', 'later', 'films', 'storytelling', 'premise', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'was', 'fresh', 'second', 'sequel', 'Final', 'Destination', 'now', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'insane', 'weird', 'horrible', 'ways', 'cast', 'killed', 'off', 'fundamentally', 'shallow', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'proper', 'villain', 'concept', 'death', 'can', 'be', 'villain', 'lack', 'villain', 'always', 'made', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'less', 'horror', 'shock', 'value', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Ring', 'had', 'moments', 'real', 'terror', 'Final', 'Destination', 'exclusively', 'shock', 'value', 'subtle', 'difference', 'why', 'least', 'viewer', 'opinion', 'not', 'going', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'movies', 'aforementioned', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'more', 'recent', 'Insidious.Now', 'review', 'not', 'been', 'glowing', 'did', 'fact', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Final', 'Destination', '5', 'huge', 'part', 'was', 'saw', 'film', '3D', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '3D', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'franchise', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'what', 'not', 'expect', 'other', 'words', 'managed', 'expectations', 'Hopefully', 'fact', 'final', 'Final', 'Destination', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'given', 'series', 'decent', 'even', 'clever', 'ending', 'recommend', 'one', 'fans', 'series', 'do', 'see', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', '3D', 'version.FTC', 'Advisory', 'purchased', 'own', 'tickets']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)
1404066,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B004EPZ08O,D. C. Obraztsov,"[1, 1]","This is definitely the best Final Destination since the second movie, without a doubt.  The concept of Final Destination is simple and quite a clever concept that can be done a million different ways.  Thankfully, we finally have a FD that doesn't suck on all levels.  The past few have had god-awful CGI, terrible dialogue, and were just flat-out stupid.  This isn't on the same tier as Final Destination 1, but it's way better than what I could have possibly expected.Storyline - the premise is the same as all FDs, but with a twist.  Kid foresees accident/catastrophe right before it happens, comes back to their senses and then tries to get everyone out of the situation.  Since they ""cheated death,"" death obviously comes back for them in the most gruesome and disgusting ways.  They always die in order of the vision the kid sees them die in.  The twist of this movie is that you can avoid your ""comeuppance"" by taking another person's life.  A little odd but it adds a new element.CGI - the CGI is really, really great.  Some of the deaths look a little bit goofy, but for the most part it's stellar.  The accident scene at the beginning has actually received much critical acclaim.  It's top-notch stuff.Dialogue/acting - the dialogue is a definite improvement over the last few FDs.  Nothing groundbreaking or terrific, but I didn't roll my eyes every time someone spoke a sentence.  The actors were decent, but I'm not sure if that was from improved dialogue or better actors.  Either way, both were better overall.Deaths - this is important since everyone watches FD for the deaths.  The deaths are super gruesome and crazy.  I also enjoyed how they made them totally unpredictable.  At first you're certain the victim is going to be electrocuted, then you think they're going to drown, and then all of the sudden a bear jumps out and eats them.  That's not an actual example, but that's about how unpredictable it is.  Very disgusting and unique.  And that's the point of the movie, right?Overall, great movie for what it is.

And for those action sequences alone, this is deserving of at least 3.5 stars... maybe a solid 4.The bridge scene, which really kicks off the whole movie, is the absolute highlight, and in the 3D presentation it's even better. you really get the sense of vertigo you feel from being high up on a bridge over water. Add to that the death sequences, which literally pop out at you, and you've got a really fun scene worthy of watching in three dimensions. Before that, the opening title sequence is also a blast, with stuff literally coming out at you over the credits.After that, the movie cools down a bit and no other sequence quite matches the 3D spectacle that preceded it (well, the very end--which echoes back to the first Final Destination movie--comes close, I suppose). The plot's pretty predictable, but it's great fun to see how the death scenes are set up and paid off. One in a massage parlor is particularly gratifying.In short, nothing mind-blowingly awesome, but it's definitely a fun, short entertaining 3D film.",4,Worth it for the 3D death sequences,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1397,"['Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', '*really*', 'stupid', 'fact', ""'re"", 'more', 'thrill', 'park', 'rides', 'movies', ""n't"", 'kind', 'thing', 'watch', 'character', 'development', 'sharp', 'layered', 'writing', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'player', 'looking', 'Instead', 'get', 'thrill', 'park', 'ride', 'short', 'bursts', 'plot', 'thrown', 'action', 'sequences', 'action', 'alone', 'deserving', 'least', '3.5', 'stars', 'maybe', 'solid', '4.The', 'bridge', 'scene', 'really', 'whole', 'movie', 'absolute', 'highlight', '3D', 'presentation', 'even', 'better', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'vertigo', 'feel', 'being', 'high', 'up', 'bridge', 'water', 'Add', 'death', 'sequences', 'literally', 'pop', 'out', ""'ve"", 'got', 'really', 'fun', 'scene', 'worthy', 'watching', 'three', 'dimensions', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'also', 'blast', 'stuff', 'literally', 'coming', 'out', 'credits.After', 'movie', 'down', 'bit', 'other', 'sequence', 'quite', '3D', 'spectacle', 'preceded', 'well', 'very', 'end', 'back', 'first', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movie', 'close', 'suppose', 'plot', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'great', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'paid', 'off', 'One', 'massage', 'parlor', 'particularly', 'gratifying.In', 'short', 'nothing', 'mind-blowingly', 'awesome', 'definitely', 'fun', 'short', 'entertaining', '3D', 'film']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

1404075,ASIEGG17K1UID,B004EPZ08O,"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas""","[0, 0]","I have loved this movie franchise since the very start. I felt the original was a novel approach to &#34;horror&#34; with the &#34;murderer&#34; not being a person but an entity.  The subsequent movies were a let down as each had a diminishing story line in lieu of more ways that death could kill people, lesser known or talented actors as in the first and less believability and character cohesion.  Still, I would watch them for the entertainment value, more than any other &#34;shock&#34; value.  So, I purchased this to add to the collection, not expecting much, and for the most part that is what I received.  The acting was sub-par on all fronts, the story line was plausible but the death scenes were not (which is not to say using the opening bridge sequence was not a brilliant move as it was; it was the deaths afterwards that were foolish). There were continuity errors in some of the scenes and the cast just seemed like they were going through the motions.So, why would I give it 4 stars?  I found it odd that this was &#34;set&#34; in NY as was the first movie (well, NY as seen through the eyes of Vancouver), and that Tony Todd was back in it after a two movie hiatus. I felt the franchise had come full circle. What I did not anticipate was the last 10 minutes of the movie.  My eyes and ears peaked each time I heard the word &#34;France or Paris&#34; and even more so, when I saw the &#34;Voulee Airlines&#34; jet. What happened next, while all the clues were there, was still a shocker. I felt like I was watching a Quentin Tarantino movie..it all came back to the start.  For that, and for solely that reason, I gave it a 4 star review.The first installment of the franchise is still the best.",4,It all goes full circle (A POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT),1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,1715,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'franchise', 'very', 'start', 'felt', 'original', 'was', 'novel', 'approach', '34', 'horror', '34', '34', 'murderer', '34', 'not', 'being', 'person', 'entity', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'were', 'let', 'down', 'had', 'diminishing', 'story', 'line', 'lieu', 'more', 'ways', 'death', 'could', 'kill', 'people', 'lesser', 'known', 'talented', 'actors', 'first', 'less', 'believability', 'character', 'cohesion', 'Still', 'would', 'watch', 'entertainment', 'value', 'more', 'other', '34', 'shock', '34', 'value', 'purchased', 'add', 'collection', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'most', 'part', 'what', 'received', 'acting', 'was', 'sub-par', 'fronts', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'plausible', 'death', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'not', 'say', 'using', 'opening', 'bridge', 'sequence', 'was', 'not', 'brilliant', 'move', 'was', 'was', 'deaths', 'afterwards', 'were', 'foolish', 'were', 'continuity', 'errors', 'scenes', 'cast', 'just', 'seemed', 'were', 'going', 'motions.So', 'why', 'would', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'found', 'was', '34', 'set', '34', 'NY', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'well', 'NY', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Vancouver', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'was', 'back', 'two', 'movie', 'hiatus', 'felt', 'franchise', 'had', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'anticipate', 'was', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'eyes', 'ears', 'peaked', 'time', 'heard', 'word', '34', 'France', 'Paris', '34', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'saw', '34', 'Voulee', 'Airlines', '34', 'jet', 'What', 'happened', 'next', 'clues', 'were', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'shocker', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movie..it', 'came', 'back', 'start', 'solely', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'star', 'review.The', 'first', 'installment', 'franchise', 'still', 'best']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

I don't understand this one, like it completely confused me. I don't get it so I'm hoping someone can answer some of my questions who is more involved in the movies or at least has seen them all. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie but it was anything special. It's the exact same as all the other movies, some person has a premonition and saves a bunch of people from death and then they all die in a gruesome way in the order they died in the movie.'Final Destination 5' is about this guy and he saves people from a bridge collapse. The only thing that I really like about the 'Final Destination' movies are the deaths. You can always expect them to be inventive and completely ridiculous...in a good way. Hands down, the deaths are the best part. The thing I liked about this one compared to the other one is that it makes you think the people are going to die one way but then they completely flip it around so it's not what you expect.Overall, 'Final Destination 5' wasn't terrible but it wasn't amaze-balls either. One of the questions I'd like someone to answer, there is this guy in the movie...he plays the coroner right. And so they ask him what's going on and he's all ""You can't cheat death, blah, blah, blah. I've seen this once before!"" But then, at the end of the movie, some of the survivors die in the plane crash from the first movie? That confuses me SO much lol.

Mostly, the 3D effects add depth (when viewed at home). This film does utilize things that jump out at you on your home 3D hardware.In the final minutes of the movie they show short segments of all the previous editions of this series, set to music, like a 3D horror music video, a really nice feature.I think this is the best in the five film series. Plus it features one of my favorite actors, Tony Todd playing the role of the coroner.This is the story about a group of office coworkers from a N.W. USA papermill taking a team building excursion via a large bus (like a Greyhound bus), the bus along with other traffic is halted on a large suspension bridge due to highway construction on the bridge. The bridge collapses sending the bus and dozens of people and cars hundreds of feet to the large river far below the bridge. One worker has a vision of the impending collapse then urges others to get off the stopped bus before the disaster even starts. Few people heed his warning. Like so many disaster films the worst part is the predictability of the deaths of the characters.

Saw V: awful. Halloween 5: appalling. Strangely many of them use 3D as a way of pulling in the punters for gore effects that splatter into three dimensions. Final Destination 5 is nothing new and no exception to this rule despite not being completely awful.A bunch of cronies on an office retreat survive a suspension bridge collapse after one of the group inexplicably has a premonition (sounds overly familiar) of said disaster. Death doesn't like to be cheated...Tony Todd...ironic accidents...blah blah...exposition...you're all going to die...yadda yadda...one by one...blah blah blah blah. It's the same old rehashed plot, recycled dialogue, and overdone deaths that seem to defy logic and physics. As usual there is a last minute twist, which by this point you're just waiting to be revealed and get it finished with, that doesn't quite add up for many reasons, but coherence has hardly been a strong point of the series.Basically, all this film offers are a few scenes of dread and tension which are all undone by cheap, fake, quick, deflating CGI gore effects.

It sure was worth it, too, as I am a hardcore fan of hers. Jacqueline truly wrung out every scene she had, right down to her screams.  Normally, on B & B, she doesn't do that sort of thing so it was really nice to see Jacqueline out of her element.  My favorite part was after being stuck in the surgical chair, she kept screaming, ""Heeelp me -- HEEELP ME!!!"" right before she fell out the multi-story eye doctor's window and crashed to her doom.  I loved, loved, LOVED the bridge part of the movie too.  Again, Jacqueline was superior when she screamed falling into the water and a car smashed her to death.To be fair, the other actors were terrific as well.  I don't think I will get acupuncture anytime soon after witnessing the poor guy Isaac being set on fire!  :(  All joking aside, I jumped out of my seat watching how everyone else got killed in the end.

Even though they recycled the same plot with different actors and kills scenarios, I always found them to be very fun. The fourth, however, really dropped the ball. I may have enjoyed a few scenes, but there was a noticeable drop in quality and I was left bitterly distrustful of the series. That said, I had high hopes for this fifth installment which was directed by new blood director Steven Quale, who has never been at the helm of a movie, but assisted Cameron on Avatar. I purchased my ticket willingly and with optimism.Not only did this movie make up for the Shakespearian tragedy of its immediate predecessor, but I enjoyed completely unexpected levels of quality. For one thing, they got some funny actors (David Koechner of Anchorman, Waiting; P. J. Byrne of BET's The Game, Horrible Bosses) who delivered a degree of inter-kill-scene comedy which the other movies lacked. This comedy did not make the exciting anticipation of the next kill any less intense. In fact, these deaths mixed gasp-inducing red herrings, ""oh my God"" shocking moments, and comedic 80's-esque execution with excellent CGI effects.P. J. Byrne really stole the show. To look at him, he's clearly no womanizer. But the things he says to woman after woman over the phone remind us of our self-absorbed frat buddies who couldn't be more rude to the opposite sex. Then there's Koechner, whose lines are as great as his death scene in the opening act.Here's an out-of-left-fielder. I actually enjoyed the 3D. This is the first time EVER that I have seen a movie in 3D without disfavoring it to the standard 2D. My Bloody Valentine was carefully made for 3D enjoyment, but it really seemed second to this. The writing, CGI, kill creativity, tactful cast, humor and production value made for a grippingly funny and overall well-made horror flick. For its high-budget-B-horror genre, the greatness of this movie was almost unwarranted. It reminded me of another movie which truly shocked me with overall quality: Jennifer's Body. Both movies may have been deliberately campy, but both also had the actors, writers, direction and effects reserved for films of much greater magnitude and far displaced from the realm of modern horror. Also, the ending, following suit with the rest of the movie, was delivered with a twist so clever that I'll bet no one sees it coming!If you love horror see this movie.",5,Best of the franchise with a super ending twist!,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,2457,"['Can', 'get', 'amen', 'really', 'loved', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'franchise', 'Even', 'recycled', 'same', 'plot', 'different', 'actors', 'kills', 'scenarios', 'always', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'fun', 'fourth', 'however', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'scenes', 'there', 'was', 'noticeable', 'drop', 'quality', 'was', 'left', 'bitterly', 'distrustful', 'series', 'said', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'fifth', 'installment', 'was', 'directed', 'new', 'blood', 'director', 'Steven', 'Quale', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'helm', 'movie', 'assisted', 'Cameron', 'Avatar', 'purchased', 'ticket', 'willingly', 'optimism.Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'make', 'up', 'Shakespearian', 'tragedy', 'immediate', 'predecessor', 'enjoyed', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'levels', 'quality', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'funny', 'actors', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Anchorman', 'Waiting', 'P.', 'J.', 'Byrne', 'BET', 'Game', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'who', 'delivered', 'degree', 'inter-kill-scene', 'comedy', 'other', 'movies', 'lacked', 'comedy', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'exciting', 'anticipation', 'next', 'kill', 'less', 'intense', 'fact', 'deaths', 'mixed', 'gasp-inducing', 'red', 'herrings', 'oh', 'God', 'shocking', 'moments', 'comedic', ""80's-esque"", 'execution', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'effects.P', 'J.', 'Byrne', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'look', 'clearly', 'womanizer', 'things', 'woman', 'woman', 'phone', 'remind', 'self-absorbed', 'frat', 'buddies', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'rude', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Then', 'Koechner', 'lines', 'are', 'as', 'great', 'death', 'scene', 'opening', 'out-of-left-fielder', 'actually', 'enjoyed', '3D', 'first', 'time', 'EVER', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', '3D', 'disfavoring', 'standard', '2D', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'was', 'carefully', 'made', '3D', 'enjoyment', 'really', 'seemed', 'second', 'writing', 'CGI', 'kill', 'creativity', 'tactful', 'cast', 'humor', 'production', 'value', 'made', 'grippingly', 'funny', 'overall', 'well-made', 'horror', 'flick', 'high-budget-B-horror', 'genre', 'greatness', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'unwarranted', 'reminded', 'movie', 'truly', 'shocked', 'overall', 'quality', 'Jennifer', 'Body', 'movies', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'deliberately', 'campy', 'also', 'had', 'actors', 'writers', 'direction', 'effects', 'reserved', 'films', 'much', 'greater', 'magnitude', 'far', 'displaced', 'realm', 'modern', 'horror', 'Also', 'ending', 'following', 'suit', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'delivered', 'twist', 'so', 'clever', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'one', 'coming', 'love', 'horror', 'see', 'movie']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

So like the previous Final Destination films these people are naturally doomed to die in silly and elaborate ways.A young man named Sam starts getting a creepy feeling once he gets on a bus for a company retreat, said bus heads over the a high up bridge part of which is under some major construction. So its only natural a man with concrete saw somehow sets off a chain reaction of cracks and eventually leads to the collapse of the massive structure.The rest of the film is a series of death scenes and the usual banter about how you can't cheat death. Tony Todd makes his appearance as a mortician who talks about what they must do to survive. After the great first film, decent second, so-so third and terrible fourth we can put this one somewhere between the third and fourth flick.Number 5 isn't so terrible that it bears tons of scorn, however its not too much above receiving some scorn as it features a fairly unfamiliar and very one dimensional cast. Besides some office nerd who survives the opening sequence there isn't really one villain to loathe but no one the viewer wishes would live in the end.Spoiler Alert (Stop reading if you don't want to know anything major)The tie in to the events of the first film just felt so forced, I was literally shaking my head from the moment I saw them on the plane.

Not only does death not like to be cheated, it apparently has a sense of irony, a macabre sense of humor, and compared to the previous movies in the series, seemingly endless and original ways of restoring the balance.I went to see this with two friends, one of whom had never seen a Final Destination movie, and she definitely did not want to see this one, she wanted to sneak into the Smurf movie instead.  If FD was bad, she would leave and go home and take my other friend, because she was his ride.So, as the movie introduces us to our usual collection of destiny deceivers, it presents the different characters in new and interesting ways.  This time, a group of people going on a company retreat, though not all of the people work for the company.  This time it's not a plane about to take off, a freeway pileup, or racing cars in a stadium. It's a bus on a bridge, and I was surprised to be so gripped by what happened on the bridge I forgot what happened in previous movies.  The further you get into the movie, the more gripping it gets.If my friend wanted to flee she could not, maybe because she was rooted to her seat.  Amateurs.FD5 offers an interesting twist on a successful formula.  Death has a new rule, by which it can be successfully cheated, and this creates an ethical dilemma for our participants.  We get the stock characters, the suspicious police detective, who thinks the accident was no accident.  The creepy mysterious guy who turns up at every scene and tells our survivors death does not like to be cheated.  Is he death personified, you wonder? And then the bodies start piling up.""If they didn't deserve to die, then why do you deserve to live.""The scenes are great, and highly inventive, and they tease and taunt you.Particularly the gymnastic routine, will it be the pointy screw on the balance beam, the loosening bolt on the parallel bar, the frayed wire to the fan, spilling water creeping across the floor, or the defective and shaky over head air conditioner.As the girl prepares for the Lasik scene, you think, doesn't she know?  For the Lasik scene. I had to close my eyes at times. How it toys with your emotions. You can be squirming one moment while anticipating the next.As I looked around I noticed many people covering their eyes at certain points.  A little kid sitting next to me seemed strangely unperturbed by the goings on.And, as a trainee chef ambles into the restaurant and there are naked flames and long skewers, and sharp knives everywhere, you wonder what is he thinking.With our usual assortment of up and coming actors, I wondered who the survivors would be. I remember thinking she is too pretty to die early, but that was short sighted of me, as death does not respect the pretty.Having seen almost all the Final Destination movies, I consider this the best since the original.  Obviously, these types of movies are not for everyone, particularly not my smurf loving friend.  But, if you have enjoyed Final Destination before, you will undoubtedly enjoy this one again.  I loved the twist at the end.I hope you found this review helpful, and I think you will enjoy the movie.",4,I am beginning to notice a pattern :),1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,3175,"['Death', 'not', 'like', 'be', 'cheated', 'Not', 'only', 'death', 'not', 'be', 'cheated', 'apparently', 'sense', 'irony', 'macabre', 'sense', 'humor', 'compared', 'previous', 'movies', 'series', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'original', 'ways', 'restoring', 'balance.I', 'went', 'see', 'two', 'friends', 'one', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movie', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'wanted', 'sneak', 'Smurf', 'movie', 'instead', 'FD', 'was', 'bad', 'would', 'leave', 'go', 'home', 'take', 'other', 'friend', 'was', 'ride.So', 'movie', 'usual', 'collection', 'destiny', 'deceivers', 'different', 'characters', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'time', 'group', 'people', 'going', 'company', 'retreat', 'not', 'people', 'work', 'company', 'time', 'not', 'plane', 'take', 'off', 'freeway', 'pileup', 'racing', 'cars', 'stadium', 'bus', 'bridge', 'was', 'surprised', 'be', 'so', 'gripped', 'what', 'happened', 'bridge', 'forgot', 'what', 'happened', 'previous', 'movies', 'further', 'get', 'movie', 'more', 'gripping', 'gets.If', 'friend', 'wanted', 'flee', 'could', 'not', 'maybe', 'was', 'rooted', 'seat', 'Amateurs.FD5', 'interesting', 'twist', 'successful', 'formula', 'Death', 'new', 'rule', 'can', 'be', 'successfully', 'cheated', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'participants', 'get', 'stock', 'characters', 'suspicious', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'accident', 'was', 'accident', 'creepy', 'mysterious', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'scene', 'survivors', 'death', 'not', 'like', 'be', 'cheated', 'death', 'personified', 'wonder', 'then', 'bodies', 'start', 'piling', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'die', 'then', 'why', 'do', 'deserve', 'live', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'highly', 'inventive', 'tease', 'taunt', 'you.Particularly', 'gymnastic', 'routine', 'will', 'be', 'pointy', 'screw', 'balance', 'beam', 'loosening', 'bolt', 'parallel', 'bar', 'frayed', 'wire', 'fan', 'spilling', 'water', 'creeping', 'floor', 'defective', 'shaky', 'head', 'air', 'girl', 'Lasik', 'scene', 'think', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lasik', 'scene', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'times', 'How', 'emotions', 'can', 'be', 'squirming', 'one', 'moment', 'anticipating', 'next.As', 'looked', 'noticed', 'many', 'people', 'covering', 'eyes', 'certain', 'points', 'little', 'kid', 'sitting', 'next', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'unperturbed', 'goings', 'on.And', 'trainee', 'chef', 'restaurant', 'are', 'naked', 'flames', 'long', 'skewers', 'sharp', 'knives', 'everywhere', 'wonder', 'what', 'thinking.With', 'usual', 'assortment', 'coming', 'actors', 'wondered', 'who', 'survivors', 'would', 'be', 'remember', 'thinking', 'too', 'pretty', 'die', 'early', 'was', 'short', 'sighted', 'death', 'not', 'respect', 'pretty.Having', 'seen', 'almost', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'consider', 'best', 'original', 'Obviously', 'types', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'particularly', 'not', 'smurf', 'loving', 'friend', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Final', 'Destination', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'enjoy', 'one', 'again', 'loved', 'twist', 'end.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'helpful', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

1404116,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B004EPZ08O,M. Bullions,"[3, 6]","After witnessing 2009's cinematic train-wreck, and I was hoping, last, installment of the ""Final Destination"" series, I was kind of appalled and disgusted when I heard that there was going to be yet another one. I generously gave ""The Final Destination"" a D- grade, for many reasons. It gave into the at-the-time lucrative and exciting 3D gimmick, and didn't deliver on the concept as it was said to. It was a typical horror movie, not bringing anything new to the table at all. While that was expected, it did give some mildly entertaining death scenes, while not necessarily being creative. It featured lousy acting, and an ending that made me happy I didn't pay to see it, as I was working at the movie theatre at that time. It wasn't even good, on a comedic level.However, I left ""Final Destination 5"" a little happier than I did its previous installment. While it's still only for horror fans, it's pretty damn entertaining, and it's more character-driven than the last couple installments have been. Its death scenes are just as creative and fun as they should be, and it made me regain a little bit of my hope in 3D film-making.It's the same story as it's always been. A gifted (and hot) early twenty-something (Nicholas D'Agosto) with apparently psychic abilities has a vision of him and all of his friends dying in a dramatic accident. He tells everybody, and witnesses them all die one-by-one, doing everything he can to stop it, but realizing, death can't be cheated. In this one, though, there's a little twist, which is a small reason why this film isn't bad as the last few have been. While there's a selected list of who dies next, if the person who's next kills someone, death skips them...or does it?It's no spoiler, as it's been proven in the four previous movies, each character meets their coup de grace in a quite dramatic way. This one gives you a brief, but worthwhile back-story on each of its characters. It makes you see them as semi-established characters, rather than just teenagers who are about to kick the bucket.However, why I liked this one is because of its death scenes. They were ten kinds of awesome. There's even a little montage at the end, of creative death scenes from the previous four movies, like a compilation. While its death scenes have never been plausible, as if they could happen in real life, they don't ask to be taken seriously. In a particularly good (and kind of sad) scene, a character is killed by a Lasik surgery machine. That could never happen in real life, for a lot of reasons. But, it's great fun to watch. As is the death-by-acupuncture scene.Also, the film should be noted, because it was filmed in 3D. It shows. As you might already have noticed, I don't particularly like 3D films. I'd forever opt to see the 2D version of a film, if it was offered in addition to the 3D, this is because most films are shot in 2D, and converted to 3D at the last minute. This was CLEARLY filmed in 3D, and it makes damn good use of it. Stuff pops out at you, almost constantly, throughout the film, and it looks, and feels kind of awesome.This is probably not the last film in the series, as it will more than likely be a box-office success. I feel like this is a good time for them to end the series. They made two good ones, had a couple lousy ones, and if they end the series now, they will have bowed out on a relatively good note.

And by God, they're right.  FD5 is the best entry since the first and in some ways, it's the best of them all.  There's a darker undertone and not as much humor in this one.  The opening disaster on the suspension bridge is extremely well done--it's nervewracking, jawdropping and even though it's just under five minutes, it seems endless and really horrifying.  Eschewing the usual vapid teen characters, we get young business professionals as our doomed survivors.  The cast does a good job in bringing a little more diversity than usual and the chain of events leading to the gruesome deaths is inventive and suspenseful.  As for the ending, I did not see that coming!!  Not to mention the new ""rule"" Tony Todd slyly interjects that adds a sinister twist.I really enjoyed FD5 and if they can keep the franchise going at this level, I'll be right there.P.S.  Fans of TV's Bold and the Beautiful who really hate the character of Steffi (played by the foxy Jacqueline McInnes Wood) will find a ghoulish satisfaction in her grim demise!

This one's premises are the same as every other FD movie, this time the group of survivors cheat death after getting off of a bus that falls victim to strong winds that bring down a large motorway bridge (similar to the Golden Gate Bridge).Of coarse as expected, Death comes for them one by one and they figure this out, and try to avoid it. The last 2 movies had something that just didn't make them as great as the first 2, almost like they where made for ""direct to DVD"" release, but this one here, you may expect ""they are just cashing in on the franchise now"" but this one had some thought put into it and the effects looked pretty good, so it was well worth a cinematic release.Make sure you stick around for the closing credits as AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood"" roars through the speakers and you get an awesome montage of pretty much every death from the FD series... in 3D!I'm not sure how that is going to look when it comes to home viewing, but in the cinemas it looked absolutely awesome!",3,"Still not as good as 1 & 2, but better then 3 and 4!",1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,1239,"['think', 'more', 'then', 'fair', 'say', 'most', 'peoples', 'favorites', 'series', 'are', '1', '2', 'then', '3', '4', 'where', 'little', 'disappointing', 'much', 'surprise', '5th', 'installment', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'had', 'awesome', 'death', 'scenes', 'one', 'premises', 'are', 'same', 'other', 'FD', 'movie', 'time', 'group', 'survivors', 'cheat', 'death', 'getting', 'off', 'bus', 'victim', 'strong', 'winds', 'bring', 'down', 'large', 'motorway', 'bridge', 'similar', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', '.Of', 'coarse', 'expected', 'Death', 'one', 'one', 'figure', 'out', 'try', 'avoid', 'last', '2', 'movies', 'had', 'something', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'great', 'first', '2', 'almost', 'where', 'made', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'one', 'here', 'may', 'expect', 'are', 'just', 'cashing', 'franchise', 'now', 'one', 'had', 'thought', 'put', 'effects', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'well', 'cinematic', 'release.Make', 'sure', 'stick', 'closing', 'credits', 'AC/DC', 'Want', 'Blood', 'speakers', 'get', 'awesome', 'montage', 'pretty', 'much', 'death', 'FD', 'series', '3D', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'going', 'look', 'when', 'home', 'viewing', 'cinemas', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'awesome']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

1404127,AR22YY31EO2QT,B004EPZ08O,"M. M ""M M""","[3, 6]","Personally, I'm REAALY tired and VERY annoyec by the increasingly improbable Rube Goldberg-esque moronic new and improved ways to die. Plane crash in FD1, scary. Massive car wreck in FD2, scary sick, even in spite of some implausible things--ie, falling logs DO NOT bounce, they boringly just lie there or roll off to the side. That was something I discovered FROM the filmmakers in the film's Bio. By the time we get to FD3, which I waited MONTHS for, I was extremely disappointed. OK, carnival accident. Carnies aren't normally seen as responsible individuals, so maybe...but frankly, I just DIDN'T CARE. FD4, with the car race...hey, wait, didn't we DO that already??? Why not a horribly evil fire, ie, The Cocoanut Grove in real life, that killed 475 people, or the Iroquis in Chicago, the most devastating fire in US history, with DOUBLE the death toll of the famous Chicago fire, as 602 people died. In ONE building. Ford Motor Co now owns the old Oriental, without even so much as a little marker on the wall, but then, I never forgave them for killing all these dumb young people with the Pinto back in the 70's anyway. I only say dumb, because you can't buy a decent car for a dollar a pound, and the Pinto's case in point.Not that RECENT historical fires make a difference, if you count the Station fire in the earlier 00's. With one or two tiny bits of dumb, it boosted whatever was fourth deadliest off the list. Or, happening right in that same week, a crowd stampede would be scary. The E2 nightclub stampede was days away from the Station tragedy.Of course, the point isn't to dramatize real events and say 'look, isn't this fun as well as sick?"" But that it could be more like the Titanic in terms of a GOOD story with scary events involved.We SAW that water and electrictricty do not mix in at least ONE of the other films. I mean, if someone were writing for this series, and wanted odd deaths, there was a book by a pathologist about weird deaths, including the Pill and a vitamin/supplement OD. One REALLY freakish one involved a harder who tripped over her junk, and the hairbrush she had in her hand got her in the eye socket.I'm having a VERY hard time even watching this one, even the parts that have ""the creepy black guy,"" Bludworth, is it? Played by Tony Todd. he was scary as hell in the freakin' Candyman, which is STILL scary 25-30 years later, and STILL a GREAT horror film. For those who like odd trivia, I HIGHLY recommend the Candyman, and that the building they drive under in the title scene at the very start of the film is the old post office. Now closed, I think. As is Cabrini Green--it's been razed, last building went down last summer, tho it wasn't as bad to drive around as it was at the time of the Candyman, when it really was a DMZ. Vanessa Williams the singer is the main character's best friend.If you insist on watching the awful, less than one star worthy film, PLEASE request it from your library as I did, so at least it's FREE!Oh, the bridge scene. I'm a facts dork, but not an engineer. I believe that perticular bridge would have had more redundancy, ie, structures, once they're up, REALLY like to STAY up. It takes some doing to get them to fall. While there are bridges that WOULD fall due to some miniscule crack, I don't think this is one of those designs. There's one that looks like a bicycle chain, and one of those DID fall due to an eighth-inch crack. Plus, I'd be moving a bit more seriously if I even THOUGHT a bridge I was on was going to drop. Trust me, you don't NEED glasses to get off a bridge. As near-sighted as I am, I can still see a CAR! And even I wouldn't be looking for them if they fell off my face. And you generally DON'T live after you drop from a bridge. Nice job getting a pristine 25-ish year old LeBaron convertible to drop on that character, as well as the other car aquiring, though.Isn't it CA? Why not an earthquake, already??

1404128,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004EPZ08O,M. Oleson,"[0, 1]","All of the ""Final Destination"" movies pretty much blend into one big blob of killing beautiful young people in creative ways.  I would offer that FD 5 sticks to the same formula and does it well.  Twenty or so office workers are headed to an off-site retreat when they become stuck on a large bridge under repair.  Suddenly high winds cause a series of events (always fun to watch) that begin to destroy the bridge.Minutes earlier one of the young workers (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a vision of what will happen.  Like the previous movies, he's not sure what he's seeing but he knows that he must get others off the bus and the bridge.  Six or seven do (sorry I lost count) and manage to reach safety.  As in earlier episodes ""Death"" is not happy so begins to pick the survivors off one by one.  There really is no other plot.  There is some young romantic angst between Sam (D'Agosto) and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell, ""Frozen"", & TV's ""The Walking Dead"") but it isn't important.  For those who like this franchise in general, you shouldn't be disappointed.Director Steven Quayle and his writing and visual effects team are highly creative in coming up with unusual ways to die.  FD 5 isn't really scary but there is no question tension is built as we try to guess things like when the gymnast is going to step on the metal screw on the balance beam.  I'm not sure when this series will end but the surprise at the end suggests this isn't the last of the films and not in the way you might think.The Blu ray transfer is crisp and clear in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The DTS HD Master Audio has plenty of action in all the speakers.  Snapping bridge cables will have you ducking.

The writing and acting are borderline terrible at times, but that's not the reason why this series has been successful. The really inventive and often complex death scenes are some of the best in the entire franchise. You think one thing is going to happen, then another, until finally the suspense builds to a crescendo of gory goodness. The ending was also a pleasant surprise. Oh, and how awesome was it to hear AC/DC blaring while a recap of deaths from all the FD films plays before the end credits.The 3-D was well worth the extra $4.00. You could tell this was shot with the format in mind. The opening title sequence alone has more stuff flying at you than the majority of 3-D films I've seen.I'm rating this four stars based on this franchise alone.

It is creative but that's not all... if you've read all my reviews of Final Destination after part 1 then you should know that I wish the sequels could be more Original... hell yeah this was Original! The most original thing about this was the main focus point which was to kill or be killed which basically meant that if you kill somebody you get there life and however long theirs lasts it could be seconds or it could be years!Plot: After a crazy bridge collapse.... a group of young adults (Not Teens Anymore!!!!) must find a way to cheat death but the person who had the premonition sees when each person is going to die and with the help of Tony Todd they realize that they can take someone else's life to keep there own! Will it be uncertain death or surviving there final destination! Watch and find out!Review: Epic and Amazing..... This movie can win over some of the most brutal and graphic death scenes I've seen in a long time! This also has my favorite opening premonition and it had a song playing that let you know that death was coming which I haven't seen since Part 2! This movie was totally refreshing and brilliant it had all good, clean aspects and had a great feeling to it as well!Acting: This had amazing acting! And some of the sheer terror in the screams will send shivers up your back! Especially Jacqueline MacInnes Wood's (Olivia's) ""Help Me"" scream almost made me shed a tear... she was the best actor out of them all In My Opinion!Gore: A whole lot of gore..... Impalements (my favorite being the sailboat death), a painful look melting body scene, bodies get sliced in half, a girl falls and snaps in half, a missing eye ball that pops when a car runs over it.... and much more... very, very brutal!Bottom Line: Wicked awesome movie that doesn't hold back on it potential.....

1404141,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004EPZ08O,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[1, 3]","Allow me to preface this review by saying that as you may have guessed from the trailer, this film is absolutely no different from the previous 4. So if you're going to this movie expecting a bit of a shake-up, you may want to skip it. But if you're going to this movie for how it should be viewed: good old gory and stupid fun, I'd say go right ahead.I was a little bit disenchanted with the series after I saw the fourth movie. Maybe it was because I was getting tiredof the series at the time, but I just wasn't drinking the kool-aid anymore. Furthermore I was dumbfounded when they were making a 5th movie, wondering how they could after the fourth movie was called ""The Final Destination"". However, the trailer looked fun, and some 3D gore fare will be some bang for my buck.I'm glad to report that this was a big Improvement. In fact, dare I say it, this has been a good year for fives. While I'm not a fan of the Fast And Furious movies, I enjoyed Fast Five in IMAX. And so I figured maybe the fifth FD movie could be good and I was surprised at how much I liked it.The dreaths are probably the most gory and brutal in the series. I kid you not, the filmmakers really do go for broke, the deaths in your face like a lunatic. In other words, death is pissed the frack off in this. One particular death pretty much sums up why I will never do gymnastics, in the same way that FD3 confirmed why I won't ever step foot into a Tanning salon, nor will I go on a roller coaster. Oh, and David Koechner is in this too, which I will say is a nice surprise.There is a lot of humour too. And thankfully so, because the previous installments took themselves too seriously. The spa scene had me laughing to the point of tears. Also, the deaths are beautifully campy, and I must say I found myself laughing at pretty much all the gore.In addition the 3D is a nice campy touch.  There's stuff flying out at you, like the Ships mast near the beginning, as well as the opening credits with the wooden logs, the burnt bodies and the broken glass and what not. In fact, I'd say go for the 3D alone.However, I can't give this a higher rating because it is exactly the same as the first four. I mean really, things happen the exact same way They did in the previous movies. I mean, as with the other movies, there's little to no surprise, so if you're expecting something fresh, do skip this.Overall, this movie is good for some light fun and campy, gory entertainment. If you liked the previous four, you'll like this one. If not... Well, you get the idea.OVERALL: 6/10Pros: Final Destination 5 is good, campy gory entertainment for those wanting just a bit of brainless (no pun intended) fun.Cons: The film is exactly th same as the first four. Plus, it would have sucked out loud in 2D, but 3D was good fun.",3,Gettin' deathy with it,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,2796,"['Allow', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'trailer', 'film', 'absolutely', 'different', 'previous', '4', 'So', ""'re"", 'going', 'movie', 'expecting', 'bit', 'shake-up', 'may', 'want', 'skip', ""'re"", 'going', 'movie', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'good', 'old', 'gory', 'stupid', 'fun', ""'d"", 'say', 'go', 'right', 'ahead.I', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'disenchanted', 'series', 'saw', 'fourth', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'was', 'was', 'getting', 'series', 'time', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'drinking', 'kool-aid', 'anymore', 'was', 'dumbfounded', 'when', 'were', 'making', '5th', 'movie', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'fourth', 'movie', 'was', 'called', 'Final', 'Destination', 'However', 'trailer', 'looked', 'fun', '3D', 'gore', 'fare', 'will', 'be', 'bang', 'buck.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'report', 'was', 'big', 'Improvement', 'fact', 'dare', 'say', 'been', 'good', 'year', 'fives', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'Fast', 'Five', 'IMAX', 'so', 'figured', 'maybe', 'fifth', 'FD', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'it.The', 'dreaths', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'gory', 'brutal', 'series', 'kid', 'not', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'do', 'go', 'broke', 'deaths', 'face', 'lunatic', 'other', 'words', 'death', 'pissed', 'frack', 'off', 'One', 'particular', 'death', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'why', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'gymnastics', 'same', 'way', 'FD3', 'confirmed', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'step', 'foot', 'Tanning', 'salon', 'will', 'go', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Oh', 'David', 'Koechner', 'too', 'will', 'say', 'nice', 'surprise.There', 'lot', 'humour', 'too', 'thankfully', 'so', 'previous', 'installments', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'spa', 'scene', 'had', 'laughing', 'point', 'tears', 'Also', 'deaths', 'are', 'beautifully', 'campy', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'laughing', 'pretty', 'much', 'gore.In', 'addition', '3D', 'nice', 'campy', 'touch', 'stuff', 'flying', 'out', 'Ships', 'mast', 'beginning', 'as', 'well', 'opening', 'credits', 'wooden', 'logs', 'burnt', 'bodies', 'broken', 'glass', 'what', 'not', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'go', '3D', 'alone.However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'exactly', 'same', 'first', 'four', 'mean', 'really', 'things', 'happen', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'previous', 'movies', 'mean', 'other', 'movies', 'little', 'surprise', 'so', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'fresh', 'do', 'skip', 'this.Overall', 'movie', 'good', 'light', 'fun', 'campy', 'gory', 'entertainment', 'liked', 'previous', 'four', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'not', 'Well', 'get', 'idea.OVERALL', '6/10Pros', 'Final', 'Destination', '5', 'good', 'campy', 'gory', 'entertainment', 'wanting', 'just', 'bit', 'brainless', 'pun', 'intended', 'fun.Cons', 'film', 'exactly', 'th', 'same', 'first', 'four', 'would', 'have', 'sucked', 'out', 'loud', '2D', '3D', 'was', 'good', 'fun']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

Final Destination 2 was also pretty good....It was a good sequel but a lot of the suspense that the first one had was gone because you pretty much were familiar enough with the concept to know that Death was coming fast and ugly for those that cheated It.Then comes like 2 or 3 more Final Destinations and it's more about the freaky death scenes than it is about story. (Okay, I guess it was always more about the freaky death scenes.) But while the past couple of Final Destinations had almost 0 suspense, there was something a bit more well done about Final Destination 5. You know the formula: Anyone that cheats Death in the initial scene of the movie is still doomed...it's just a matter of time before some kind of grotesque accident will befall the cheaters.Death and gore lovers will have a field day with Final Destination 5. There's all kinds of death and mutilation, and in some demented way it was all amazing to watch due to how real it looked due to the FX and CGI. The movie follows the predictable pattern of building up to the next gruesome death with some torturous B acting. It was easier to watch the deaths than the acting in between the deaths.

The movie introduces the characters, in this case they are a group of office workers. They travel. One has a premonition of death and saves the group only to find out there exists an unseen expiration date on all of us, and if you go past that date you must die in a bizarre abnormal manner. If you have sat through all the ""Friday the 13th"" movies and thought they were all different, you might try this series. As for me, knowing basically the whole plot before it unfolds...over the last 5 films is a bit boring. The re-addition of Tony Todd issuing a warning as if he is ""Death"" himself was one of the highlights. Many of the main characters are named after famous horror directors: Peter Friedkin is named after ""The Exorcist"" director William Friedkin; Candice Hooper is named after Tobe Hooper who directed ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and ""Poltergeist"";and Olivia Castle is named after William Castle who directed ""The Tingler"" and the original ""House on Haunted Hill.""Death has rules, just like killing vampires and zombies. You would think if you cheat death, then you must die. However, that is not the case. If you kill someone who wasn't supposed to die, you get their years.It is my understanding the DVD will have an alternate ending. The gore was fairly decent.

1404166,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B004EPZ08O,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 2]","When Final Destination 4 (also called The Final Destination, FD 3D) came out in 2009 it was intended to close the series. Then this third sequel did good at the box office and an idea for a fifth entry in the franchise  I felt that Final Destination 4 relied perhaps a little too much on the 3D effects. While 5 is still in 3D it has a better story and is on the predictable side it's still an overall better film than the fourth. The story this time goes as follows: Sam Lawton is on a bus on his way to a company retreat and while on a bridge he has a vision that the bridge they're driving on is going to collapse and he, his friends and co-workers are going to die. He manages to save his friends and it leaves everyone confused. They were supposed to die on that bridge and now death has come to get them one by one as you could expect from the series previous films.The Final Destination films have really mastered the art of making viewers think what happens is predictable, causing them to a except a certain death and then the poor victim dies in a completely different (and often stupid) way.  For example you think this guy is going to die burned because that's what the movies tells you to think and then he dies differently. Some of the deaths are ridiculous and over the top, funny and dumb but they are creative and different from previous FD films. I liked how during the credits they show deaths from the other FD movies it was a cool way to close the movie.Final Destination 5 was filmed entirely in 3D and the result is fantastic visuals and I say that not being a fan of 3D movies. The effects are better than last time and they still manage to obtain the disgusting/gross feel they were so obviously aiming for. The bridge scene early in the film was fantastic from a visual standpoint, a highlight for sure. The death scenes were satisfying. As a nice addition Tony Todd reprises the role of mortician William Bludworth he played in the first two Final Destination movies. Todd said that if Final Destination 5 did well at the box office it was possible that movies 6 and 7 would follow.The Final Destination movies are described as being aimed at teenagers and I can't really argue with that. I don't think there is anything wrong, the FD films have always seemed to be made for teenagers more than any other group (and not the horror buff), they're just good fun. I thought they really exploited the 3D tactic in the last movie and it turned out to be a successful movie but this one makes better use of it and it's not all about 3D this time around. Not the best Final Destination but still an entertaining one and much better than the fourth in my opinion. At this point you know if you either like or hate the Destinations, if you're a fan of the series this one is a good addition but those movies have quite frankly become a bit predictable. 3/5 *.",3,Death doesn't like to be cheated...,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,2877,"['When', 'Final', 'Destination', '4', 'also', 'called', 'Final', 'Destination', 'FD', '3D', 'came', 'out', '2009', 'was', 'intended', 'close', 'series', 'Then', 'third', 'sequel', 'did', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'idea', 'fifth', 'entry', 'franchise', 'felt', 'Final', 'Destination', '4', 'relied', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'much', '3D', 'effects', '5', 'still', '3D', 'better', 'story', 'predictable', 'side', 'still', 'overall', 'better', 'film', 'fourth', 'story', 'time', 'as', 'Sam', 'Lawton', 'bus', 'way', 'company', 'retreat', 'bridge', 'vision', 'bridge', ""'re"", 'driving', 'going', 'collapse', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'save', 'friends', 'everyone', 'confused', 'were', 'supposed', 'die', 'bridge', 'now', 'death', 'come', 'get', 'one', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'series', 'previous', 'films.The', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'have', 'really', 'mastered', 'art', 'making', 'viewers', 'think', 'what', 'predictable', 'causing', 'certain', 'death', 'then', 'poor', 'victim', 'dies', 'completely', 'different', 'often', 'stupid', 'way', 'example', 'think', 'guy', 'going', 'die', 'burned', 'what', 'movies', 'think', 'then', 'differently', 'deaths', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'funny', 'dumb', 'are', 'creative', 'different', 'previous', 'FD', 'films', 'liked', 'how', 'credits', 'show', 'deaths', 'other', 'FD', 'movies', 'was', 'cool', 'way', 'close', 'movie.Final', 'Destination', '5', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', '3D', 'result', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'say', 'not', 'being', 'fan', '3D', 'movies', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'last', 'time', 'still', 'manage', 'obtain', 'disgusting/gross', 'feel', 'were', 'so', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'bridge', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'visual', 'standpoint', 'highlight', 'sure', 'death', 'scenes', 'were', 'satisfying', 'nice', 'addition', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'role', 'mortician', 'William', 'Bludworth', 'played', 'first', 'two', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'Todd', 'said', 'Final', 'Destination', '5', 'did', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'possible', 'movies', '6', '7', 'would', 'follow.The', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'are', 'described', 'being', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'argue', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'wrong', 'FD', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'made', 'teenagers', 'more', 'other', 'group', 'not', 'horror', 'buff', ""'re"", 'just', 'good', 'fun', 'thought', 'really', 'exploited', '3D', 'tactic', 'last', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'successful', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'use', 'not', '3D', 'time', 'around', 'Not', 'best', 'Final', 'Destination', 'still', 'entertaining', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'fourth', 'opinion', 'point', 'know', 'either', 'hate', 'Destinations', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'one', 'good', 'addition', 'movies', 'have', 'quite', 'frankly', 'become', 'bit', 'predictable', '3/5', '*']",Final Destination 5 (DVD)
