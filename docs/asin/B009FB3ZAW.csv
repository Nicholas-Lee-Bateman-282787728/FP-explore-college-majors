Bad acting, everything terrible. A complete waste of time.And what's worse is of course, the director Richard Halpern has written a review here, the first one (5 stars! Saw this at a packed screening blah blah blah). I assure you there was no packed screening for this amateurfest. The same guy also reviewed one other movie called ""Burned"" and guess who the director was? I've said it before, I'll say it again - people who worked on the cheapo amateurfests should not be allowed to also ""review"" them and pretend to be someone who watched it.

1596234,A26O0OR2X21GDB,B009FB3ZAW,Scottbis,"[0, 0]","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSWhat did I learn about wilderness survival from ""Bigfoot County?""1. You must always antagonize your creepy guide, and accuse him of being lost even when it is obvious you are not.2. When your guide begins to leave, you MUST stay right where you are. You'll be fine out in the mountains all on your own!3. When threatened at gunpoint by crazy hillbillies, who give you five minutes to ""leave my land"" or suffer severe consequences, agree with one another to comply and then quickly decide to ignore the threat (at gunpoint) and stay the night right where you are. After all, what's the worst that a shotgun-wielding crazed hillbilly who almost just raped your girlfriend can do? Just be sure to put all of your survival necessities in a bag, so they will be safely left behind if you have to leave quickly.4. When being stalked by crazed hillbillies, be sure to stop and yell as loud as you can every few yards; would not want them to be able to find you and kill you, now would we?5. Hillbillies in NW California are magical. They can cast a spell that suddenly yanks away your companions through thick forest, with no explanation. The proper way to respond is not to immediately pursue your companion, but instead to stand still yelling their name over and over, to yell to them you plan on coming to rescue them, and THEN to begin to move. Some cynical persons would suggest this delay obviously gives the film crew time to hide, but in reality this counters the magical hillbilly spell.6. Never arm yourself when fighting for your life. Even when the hillbillies leave a highly effective weapon for you, be sure to throw it into the woods.7. Always leave a light on at night. Some would wonder why you would want all the hillbillies to know where you are sleeping, but the light actually keeps the magical hillbillies away.8. If you are caught, you will be raped. If you are male.I could go on and on, but will stop here.
