They moan about the slightest thing,sometimes not even knowing what they are talking about. They moan about sets being split in two, they moan about the value, the way they are packaged, the fact that there are no EXTRAS. One reviewer under the name of 'MovieMan' from Los Angeles writes the following remarkes about GUNSMOKE Season 2-Vol.1---------------------------------------------------""I recall a reviewer indicating Paramount/CBS botched Season 2 Volume 1 because they pulled episodes from another season and placed them on this volume...and people are paying for the mess.""---------------------------------------------------------I have this season and all episodes are intact and belong to the appropiate season as well as being in date order - they are not a mess.I really do not know why so many complain at the value of a lot of these sets, such as ""Gunsmoke"" ""Rawhide"" ""The Untouchables"" and many more by the well studios like CBS.The digitally re-mastered quality of these type of DVDs are excellent and represent usually very good value for money. A lot of Americans do not know how lucky they are with the prices.  If supposedly buyers keep on complaining about such paltry issues as I have described then it may well put studios off from producing these high quality and very entertaining programmes on to DVD, then they will have nothing.  I personally do not mind seasons being split up as they are easier to buy that way. Obviously it would be nice if series that were long running in their day, like ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Rawhide"" could be issued quicker than they are. For example ""Gunsmoke"" will take 20 years at the rate of present of issue.  I say to studios like ""Paramount/CBS"", keep up the good work, keep producing these excellent series of the past and keep up the excellent quality.

These were made when TV was trully a pleasurable form of entertainment and the stars of this series were good normal human beings off screen. Compare James Arness to today's Charlie Sheen and you'll see what I mean.The complaints about the way they are being released are justified and the guy who says we should stop complaining about getting ripped off or CBS might just stop making them must be kidding. They know when they have a good thing going and I'm sure as they get more of us hooked on collecting the set they will raise the price and probably divide it into even more DVDs. I only hope James Arness is getting a share of it but I really doubt that he is. Greedy CBS probably doesn't even know he exists anymore.I remember how we looked forward to Gunsmoke every week and I'm enjoying these early years even more than the later years that have been shown on TV Land and Encore in recent years.

But after all of our hopes were raised by the first release, the second release dashed our hopes just as low.If the studio never intended to release the entire series in DVD format, they should have waited.
