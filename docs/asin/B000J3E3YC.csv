My son has learned a great deal with this video and all the videos from Kathy Oxley. It's repetitive and the characters are so darn cute. I have rented about 4 of them already and I will continue to until my son learns the whole program. A must have, from one parent to another.

It shows the colors and also shows the different shades of those colors.

My son can learn all sorts of things from these videos that he was unable to learn in preshcool.  With just days of ""Meet the Numbers"" he knew several numbers and with 2 weeks of ""Meet the Letters"" he was able to name many letters on the cover of Meet the Numbers.  This is a big deal because just saying words clear enough for us to understand is hard yet he was able to say these things.  I even consider somewhat of a speech therapy while he does the video because he talks along with them.  With the simple & repetitive style it is very easy to pick up and they associate the characters with what they are leraning and are able to generatlize it into every day activities.  I HIGHLY recomend this item not only for normal children but for those with special needs.  We use our's in the car on the way to school.

1024259,A2AVYSXICESSTK,B000J3E3YC,E. Kerby,"[0, 0]","I was really excited to buy Meet the Colors because my 16 month old daughter is obsessed with colors right now.  I saw a preview of it and I could understand why it has won so many awards: it mimics what we do all the time, by pointing out stuff that is each color, and saying only the color name (which avoids confusion).  It is slow paced, so there are probably not the same TV issues that some other programs have.  Sure, it may be annoying to listen to, and I was prepared for that, but as parents we can handle minor annoyances for the sake of enriching our kids' learning experiences.  So many reviewers talk about their kids loving these programs, so I was excited to let my daughter watch it.Yeahhhhh, so much for that.  My daughter is totally bored by it.  She rarely watches any media, so it's not that she's used to more stimulation from TV, either. The first time she watched this she got about halfway through.  We've tried to get her to watch it a few more times since then, and she won't sit for it for more than a couple minutes.  It is kind of pathetic watching her try to watch it, even.  She yawns a lot, and then starts looking around for something else, and then she starts to close my computer.  I'm done trying to get her to watch it.  If she is so uninterested in this program, I don't think I should push it.Instead, we're doing basically the same thing in real life: pointing stuff out that is different colors, and talking about it. So far she LOVES yellow, she knows blue, green, red, and purple, and sometimes she knows pink and orange.  That's good enough for a 16 month old baby, anyway, and I'm sure as we continue talking about colors she will continue to get better and better with them.  She talks about colors ALL DAY every day right now, as she is constantly pointing them out everywhere, and also pointing out plaid, stripes, and dots, so we'll get there.I don't know why I kind of hoped she could just watch a little TV program and learn them all instantly.  It's not so bad to be personally involved in her learning.  It's kind of fun to help her figure things out.So, the best thing about this movie for us is that it helped me decide not to spend any money on the other similar shows (I was thinking about doing lowercase letters and phonics, plus Spanish ones).  It's not terrible, but it is very boring, and I can't in good conscious pressure my baby to watch more tv than she is interested in.",2,"Seems PERFECT, but it just isn't.",1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2438,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'buy', 'Meet', 'Colors', '16', 'month', 'old', 'daughter', 'obsessed', 'colors', 'right', 'now', 'saw', 'preview', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'what', 'do', 'time', 'pointing', 'out', 'stuff', 'color', 'saying', 'only', 'color', 'name', 'confusion', 'slow', 'paced', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'same', 'TV', 'issues', 'other', 'programs', 'have', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'annoying', 'listen', 'was', 'prepared', 'parents', 'can', 'handle', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'sake', 'enriching', 'kids', 'learning', 'experiences', 'So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'talk', 'kids', 'loving', 'programs', 'was', 'excited', 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'it.Yeahhhhh', 'so', 'much', 'daughter', 'totally', 'bored', 'rarely', 'media', 'not', 'used', 'more', 'stimulation', 'TV', 'either', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'got', 'about', 'halfway', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'get', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'more', 'couple', 'minutes', 'kind', 'pathetic', 'watching', 'try', 'watch', 'even', 'lot', 'then', 'looking', 'something', 'else', 'then', 'close', 'computer', ""'m"", 'done', 'trying', 'get', 'watch', 'so', 'uninterested', 'program', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'push', 'it.Instead', ""'re"", 'doing', 'basically', 'same', 'thing', 'real', 'life', 'pointing', 'stuff', 'different', 'colors', 'talking', 'So', 'far', 'LOVES', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'purple', 'sometimes', 'pink', 'orange', 'good', 'enough', '16', 'month', 'old', 'baby', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'sure', 'continue', 'talking', 'colors', 'will', 'continue', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'colors', 'DAY', 'day', 'right', 'now', 'constantly', 'pointing', 'everywhere', 'also', 'pointing', 'out', 'plaid', 'stripes', 'dots', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'kind', 'hoped', 'could', 'just', 'watch', 'little', 'TV', 'program', 'learn', 'instantly', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'personally', 'involved', 'learning', 'kind', 'fun', 'help', 'figure', 'things', 'out.So', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'helped', 'decide', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'other', 'similar', 'shows', 'was', 'thinking', 'doing', 'lowercase', 'letters', 'phonics', 'Spanish', 'ones', 'not', 'terrible', 'very', 'boring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscious', 'pressure', 'baby', 'watch', 'more', 'tv', 'interested']",Meet the Colors
