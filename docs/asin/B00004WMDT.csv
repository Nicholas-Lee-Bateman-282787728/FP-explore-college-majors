555926,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00004WMDT,Alex Udvary,"[1, 2]","Here's a movie about hopes and dreams and what it takes to accomplish those dreams, about doing want YOU want vs what your parents or parent wants you to do. It's about learning to follow your HEART instead of your HEAD. At times it can be a heartfelt, poignant, and even amusing. When this movie first came out, I had no interest to go see it, maybe it's because I'm a guy, I don't know. As I sat down and watched it, I was hooked. I went along with all the characters, I was even smiling while I was watching it. It turned out to be a true &quot;sleeper&quot; in my opinion. It's because of all of this, I would even go as far as to say, it's one of the best films of the year! The story concerns three different and unique girls (Amanda Schull, Susan May Pratt, and Zoe Saldana) simply following their hearts. Jody Sawyer get accepted to the American Ballet Theater, a place she has waited ten years to get into. It's been her life long goal to make it as a ballerina. Schull is a new face to me, and quite a talent, not to mention a looker  lol. She's a wonderful jazz and ballet dancer. In time, I think, she will really hit it big, her talent will not go unseen. Then we have Maureen (Susan May Pratt). She's been at the A.B.Theater for 9 years, mostly thanks to her mother. She is considered the best dancer in the entire school. And also one of the most stuck up. Then we have Eva (Zoe Saldana), who to me, doesn't really seem to care where she is. It's mostly all fun and games with her. She'll say what she wants when she wants and to who she wants, in other words, she's never at a lost for words. These three girls have their own struggles to overcome before they can make it to their dreams. Jody(Amanda Schull), has fallen for Cooper Nielson (Ethan Stiefel). The problem is, as she later puts it in the movie, &quot;(He) sucks as a boyfriend.&quot; He plays with her emotions when she the most vulnerable, after being told &quot;(she) has bad feet.&quot; I know it sounds funny to some. She now must work harder to reach her dream. Maureen (Pratt) is suffering from bulimia and if that wasn't enough she's having doubts about her future as a dancer. She's come to the conclusion, that she just doesn't have the &quot;heart&quot; for it. It's not what she really wants out of life. And as for Eva (Saldana), she tries to forget about all the hard work dancing can be, and the pressure put on her by the A.B. Theater, and remembers why she first wanted to dance, because she loves it. This is a movie filled with enjoyable characters that are fun to watch and you even begin to care about them. It easy to follow, and has great dance scenes in it, the one at the end is amazing! This is a movie everyone should hurry up and buy, you won't be disappointed.  p.s- a little something for the guys. Don't be so quick to pass this one up.

Some were bad, some were good, some were awful, some were great and then some were cheesy fun with no real redeeming value.  `Center Stage' is probably in that category.  It is fun, albeit pointless, but when all is said and done you won't be kicking yourself for having watched it.`Center Stage' pretty much regurgitates the same formula we see in many films within this genre.  This time we are spending time in at a ballet school (The American Ballet Company) where students attempt to achieve greatness.  The main student we are focusing our attention on is Jody Sawyer.  She is the typical girl next door who wants to be a ballet dancer but possesses a funky edge that is better suited for jazz.  Still, she has drive and potential.Clich&eacute;s abound.The films dance sequences (especially towards the finale) are what save this film from being a total failure.  Some of the acting is spirited (and this did help spawn the career of Zoe Saldana, so I'm grateful for that) but overall this is not an `actors' film.  This is a dancers film, and those dancers (most of the cast had training or were dancers before actors) shine brightly in the numbers they are given to perform.  The final dance numbers are provocative and engaging.The film, outside of the dancing, is a clich&eacute; ridden mess, but at least it has some spunk.  You are engaged, even if you have seen it all before and know exactly what is going to happen (why do most teenage dramas follow such a `paint-by-numbers' formula?).  You have the overbearing stage mom, the girl who doesn't really want to be there, the one who doesn't quite stack up, the questionable love interest, the arrogant showoff, the demanding instructor...the list goes on and on.Still, it is fun while it lasts.",3,The dancing elevates this predictable film...,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,1857,"['Really', ""'m"", 'first', 'review', 'Dance', 'movies', 'were', 'kind', 'place', 'place', 'decade', 'were', 'bad', 'were', 'good', 'were', 'awful', 'were', 'great', 'then', 'were', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'real', 'redeeming', 'value', 'Center', 'Stage', 'probably', 'category', 'fun', 'albeit', 'pointless', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'kicking', 'having', 'watched', 'it.', 'Center', 'Stage', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'formula', 'see', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'time', 'are', 'spending', 'time', 'ballet', 'school', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Company', 'where', 'students', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'main', 'student', 'are', 'focusing', 'attention', 'Jody', 'Sawyer', 'typical', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'be', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'funky', 'edge', 'better', 'suited', 'jazz', 'Still', 'drive', 'potential.Clich', 'eacute', 'abound.The', 'films', 'dance', 'sequences', 'especially', 'finale', 'are', 'what', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'total', 'failure', 'acting', 'spirited', 'did', 'help', 'spawn', 'career', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'overall', 'not', 'actors', 'film', 'dancers', 'film', 'dancers', 'most', 'cast', 'had', 'training', 'were', 'dancers', 'actors', 'shine', 'brightly', 'numbers', 'are', 'given', 'perform', 'final', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'provocative', 'engaging.The', 'film', 'dancing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'mess', 'least', 'spunk', 'are', 'engaged', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'why', 'do', 'most', 'teenage', 'dramas', 'follow', 'paint-by-numbers', 'formula', 'have', 'overbearing', 'stage', 'mom', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stack', 'up', 'questionable', 'love', 'interest', 'arrogant', 'showoff', 'demanding', 'instructor', 'list', 'fun']",Center Stage VHS

555939,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B00004WMDT,Carlisle Wheeling,"[1, 1]","I love this movie, really, basic formula plotline and all.  The stories of the 3 main girls are typical of what you see in movies and TV shows aimed at younger audiences, but so what?  The dancing is so phenominally good that you just don't mind some of the less-than-brilliant acting by a cast that's mostly all professional dancers.  With the exceptions of Zoe Saldana who plays Eve, by far and away the most interesting character in the film, Susan May Pratt who unfortunately  got the worst and most intolerable role as the anorexic dancer who was badgered constantly by a worse character in her mother, and Peter Gallagher, the acting was so-so for the rest with the exception of former New York City Ballet's Ethan Stiefel who actually shows potential.As for Stiefel--cocky dancing/coreographing stud muffin Cooper Nielsen--you can't take your eyes off him for a moment in any dancing sequences, because he is truly one amazing and gifted dancer.  Wow, talk about self-discipline and outstanding physical form!  Also of note are Amanda Schull, who plays pretty girl-next-door Jodi Sawyer in a grow-up-fast role as she is torn between Cooper and sweet Charlie--Sasha Radetsky, who is also among the best of the main casted dancers.  Where this movie falls flat in plotline is made up for in spades by the dancing sequences and the depicted reality of the cut-throat world of ballet.  There is also salsa dancing fueled by the music of Elvis Crespo, some high energy rock-jazz, and a sizzlingly hot finale which combines all the above elements into Cooper's program that is based obviously on his rivalry with Johnathan (Gallagher) over his former girlfriend.What spoiled this movie for me somewhat was listening to Nicholas Hytner's drab, largely removed commentary of his own project.  It went something like this:  ""I'm from the theater, know nothing about ballet, but love it so I made this movie...Um...er...(big looooong pause)We had to stretch the truth here a bit, because that probably wouldn't really happen in real life, but this is only a movie...I'm from the theater...er...um...That's not really Zoe and Ilia dancing Swan Lake...um...This is just a film.""  Yeah, that's exactly it.  He seldom discusses the plot...er...um, well, maybe once.  It's pretty obvious he just wanted to work with ballet dancers, and kept referring to them as ""natural"" actors:  in literal translation, he had to work with what he had.  It's sad to see this man think so little of his own work, and it was disappointing to hear him say so indirectly and with such transparency.  My advice is to skip the audio commentary and just enjoy the movie itself.  The other extras, the featurette in particular, are not so hot outside of the Stars and Stripes extended dance scene.  Hytner didn't totally spoil things for me, so I am warning you ahead of time; if you buy this version, just ignore the commentary lest YOUR bubble be burst.

Prior to watching Center Stage, I thought it would be purely a dancing moving. To my surprise, it had a good story line and character development in it. The movie hosted real actual dancers as the actors, rather than actors portraying dancers. So the acting in the movie was sub-par, but it gave a FEEL to the movie as well. You can relate to the characters as everyday individuals, instead of the TOO Hollywoodish movies that we're used to.The main character is Jody Sawyer (a Jenny Garth look-alike), a young, beautiful and nieve girl who's ambition is to be part of the ABC (American Ballet Company). It seems like she would do ANYTHING to achieve this dream! She is one of the few that are selected to attend the ABA (American Ballet Company). There, she meets her dorm friends Maureen (a bolimic), Eve (outgoing/energetic) and a few others. The main goal of the students... to be one of the three male or three females to make the cut for the ABC.The one thing I did notice was the strong stereotyping in the movie. They had the African-American team up with each other during a dance sequence, they happened to have a Russian couple named Sergey and Gallina, and they made an African-American the bad/rebellious person in the movie.

They had been unable to stay for my 9th birthday, which was the following day.Given my penchant for paying attention to babies, I realize the possibility that I may have even encountered her as an infant, when I recall a sleeping little one I saw in shopping cart in a store with her mother close at hand.Well, whether I did encounter her or not, it was a pleasure to witness the onscreen debut of this ""Honolulu Baby"" as Jody Sawyer in this film about ballet dancers competing for places in New York's fictional American Ballet Association.Her parents(Stephen Stout, Maryann Plunkett) help her settle in, and she meets her new roomates, the salty-tounged and streetwise rougue, Eva Rodriguez(Zoe Saldana), and the pale, staid, and very focused Maureen Cummings(Susan May Pratt),the star pupil, whose overbearing stage mother, Nancy(Debra Monk), has an executive position with the company.The most influential instructors there are Jonathan(Peter Gallagher), and Juliette Simone( Donna Murphy). From her classmates, who also include Anna(Megan Pepin), and Victoria Born's Emily(whose healthy appetite will ultimately be to her detriment as a dancer), Jody learns about the love triangle between Jonathan, his new wife, Kathleen Donahue(Julie Kent) and the Ballet's young choregrapher, Cooper Nielsen (Ethan Stiefel), of whose affections Jody will have to try to stay wary.On a gala night after Cooper and Kathleen dance the lead roles in ""Romeo and Juliet"". The students hawk expensive memorabilia carried in baskets at the after party. A few of them, including, Anna, Emily, Jody, Charlie(Sasha Radetsky), and Erik Jones(Shakiem Evans)and Sergei(1998 Olympic Figure Skating Gold Medalist Ilia Kulik), overhear a quarrel between Cooper and Kathleen in the seating area of the otherwise empty auditorium as the former lovers walked in while the students were scouting out the stage on which they will perform.--A glimpse of the drama of which they will soon become a part.That night, Maureen has an encounter with a medical student named Jim Gordon(Elon Bailey), who works as a caterer at the event, which will also change her life for the better.We observe the students' routines and rehearsals, and those familiar with classical music will recognize the works of Albeniz, Delibes, Tchaikovsky, and Adam.But there are livlier moments when Jody and the gang spend a night on the town dancing Salsa, having too much to drink, and paying for it the next day. Even as they pay the penalties for being out of bounds, they have fun, and Maureen becomes painfully aware of how her rarified circumstances exclude her from the mainstream as she sneaks a peak at them.The rigors of dance make Jody concerned about her ""turn-out""-- the positioning of her feet, as well as her body type. This film does not shrink from the issue of eating disorders among the dancers,which are visible among Maureen, Kathleen, as well as Eva.The ballet gains a new patron named Joan Miller(Elizabeth Hubbard), who will witness the love triangle that develops between Jody and two other dancers.In the meantime, when Cooper and Jody attend a class at the Broadway Dance School(Jody doing so against ABA policy), we enjoy a rousing performance to Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground"" under the guidance of Cooper's friend Jazz Teacher, Priscilla Lopez.Invited to star in Cooper's new company, Jody thrives amid personal problems with Cooper himself.In the finale, the students perform in the workshop in which classical music gives way to pop music, led by Michael Jackson's ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", which puts the audience more at ease, and tells a great story which those involved have already lived, amid some spectacular dance moves.The dynamics among the students shift, ambitions change,some dreams are fulfilled, some hearts are broken, and well, that's showbiz, kids!In the meantime, I've had the satisfaction of watching a very talented ""Saturday's Child"" work hard for a living, and do a great job!",5,Saturday's Child...,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,4320,"['Having', 'lived', 'Honolulu', 'time', 'Amanda', 'Schull', 'birth', 'there', '1978', 'can', 'recall', 'what',

While charming at times with a very upbeat ending, the story is ultimately just another jejune and unoriginal teen flick.  Instead of teens in jeans, we have teens in tights.  Otherwise, the storylines are indistinguishable, lacking anything that approaches novelty, depth or substance.That having been said, this likeable film was easy to watch and the dancing was exquisite.  If only there had been more of it.  The fact that the cast was filled with real dancers instead of actors pretending to be dancers improved its realism and delivered fantastic dancing scenes without the need for stunt dancers.  Unfortunately, the flip side of this decision was the fact that the acting was generally mediocre.Two standouts were Amanda Schull (Jody Sawyer) and Zoe Saldana (Eva Rodriguez).  Schull was affable yet determined and was most credible in her portrayal of a struggling dancer.  Saldana played the irreverent bad girl who was brilliantly talented but had trouble with authority.  She emerged as the most complete of any of the cast members, being both a good dancer and an excellent actor.On the terrible side, we have Susan May Pratt (Maureen), who has done a string of teen flicks (""Drive Me Crazy"", ""Ten Things I Hate About You"").  As always, she was consistently puerile and abrasive.  Peter Gallagher is not known for lighting up the screen, but he was flat even for him (if that is possible).I rated this film a 7/10 because I love ballet and all kinds of dance.

I never stuck with it, my parents didn't make me practice and they let me off the hook too easily when I didn't want to keep pushing to do it.  You never get to the reward if you don't push through that phase.  Oh well....the story in this movie is excellently done and it's never stupid or unbelievable.  I've got enough dance background to know that they did their research when filming it.  Also one of the male leads, Ethan Steifel, is a professional ballet dancer and you can really tell.  His dancing is phenomenal.Character tensions are developed nicely without making you hate the bad girl.... issues like eating disorders, bloody toes from pointe shoes, frustration and sexual chemistry are present but not made into a soapbox.  You'll really be rooting for them all at the end....My favorite part is the jazz class the ingenue character takes midway through the movie.  The class is shown doing a warmup routine and then a dance routine that is actually very stimulating to watch and makes you feel really good.

You've seen this story before, with just slight variations--girl pursues her dreams of stardom, meets some guys along the way, discovers her true self in unexpected places. All the elements are there, the stereotypes abound, you find yourself saying &quot;Oh, come ON now!&quot; yet you stay glued.Part of the appeal comes from second guessing all these familiar devices, but part of it comes from watching these characters say what you wish they'd say in other movies.

Lizzi,"[6, 7]","After seeing this movie twice on television, I bought the DVD solely for the dancing, which is by far the highlight of this movie.Storywise, ""Center Stage"" has much that I'd seen before in movies with a dance theme:  jealousies and affairs among directors, choreographers, principals and/or students; ballerinas with eating disorders, lack of desire, lack of talent, attitude problems or pushy parents; two guys exercising their egos in a ""dance duel"" . . . you know how it goes.  Stereotypes abound, but the characters are engaging enough so that a predictable plot can still render a movie that is watchable.Now, for the REALLY good part.  There is excellent dancing in this movie:  Ethan Stiefel, Julie Kent and Sascha Radetsky each provide eye-catching performances.  Zo Saldana, Amanda Schull and many of the others are also worth a look.  I thought the portrayal of the trials and tribulations that accompany dance academies were both interesting and entertaining.  A pleasant surprise under the ""Special Features"" menu is Radetsky's fantastic solo dance scene which wound up being deleted from the final cut (why?).  Stiefel and Kent show us why they're stars in the excellent ""extended dance sequences"" (although the video quality of these bonuses is way below that of the feature presentation, big disappointment).  There's also a cool music video by Mandy Moore, featuring the dancing of Radetsky in a more upscale setting.

555977,A26IJ3A2TRQZAO,B00004WMDT,Kayla,"[9, 9]","The story is old but the energies are new in ''Center Stage,'' and that's all this film needs to carry it past its familiar backstage elements. A spirited ensemble of appealing young newcomers essentially takes us through a year at a thinly disguised American Ballet Theatre school that will end with advancement for a very few and heartbreak for most. This is made bluntly clear at the outset by the company's kingpin, played by Peter Gallagher with a certain arrogance, but also in a way that convinces us he's not wrong to be as demanding as he is. In one of the film's many echoes of past backstage sagas, he reminds us of the godlike choreographer in ''A Chorus Line.''Before long, we're also sensing the ghosts of ''The Turning Point,'' ''Stage Door,'' ''Flashdance,'' ''Gypsy,'' and ''Saturday Night Fever.'' But ''Center Stage'' is kept from seeming old and hackneyed by the explosions of freshness from its young performers. One, Ethan Stiefel, is a bona fide ABT star. In the film, he plays a prominent soloist who's feeling confined by the strict parameters of the company's repertoire and wants to push off into a looser, freer kind of choreography. He's also coming off the short end of a romantic triangle involving Gallagher's top dog and the prima ballerina for whose affections both competed.Not surprisingly, the big climactic dance he devises for the academy graduation recital at a Lincoln Center benefit mixes a romantic triangle with a devolution from classical ballet into something more street-flavored. You expect as much, given that his way of relaxing is to ride his motorcycle from Lincoln Center to a Broadway dance studio and exchange Kenneth MacMillan for Bob Fosse as a change of pace. When he meets Amanda Schull's young ballet maverick, Jody, there, it isn't long before they're doing their own variations on ''Romeo and Juliet.''''Center Stage'' is filled with mavericks. Schull (in real life a San Francisco Ballet corps member) keeps dancing on pure determination, having been told from day one that her body type is not the balletic ideal. But she works hard, and projects charisma and glow. These mavericks also are uninhibited about mouthing off to their teachers, especially Zoe Saldana's Eva. But one of the quietest young dancers (from the ABT corps), Sascha Radetsky's Charlie, has his eye on Jody, too, and is remarkable for his airy elevations besides. Not all of the characters are portrayed by dancers. Ilia Kulik, who plays the resident Russian in the troupe, is Russian, but is an ice-skating champ.The ''Stage Door'' echo comes in the competitive roommating of Jody, Eva, and Susan May Pratt's unhappy, bulimic prize pupil, Maureen, being shoved toward stardom by her unfulfilled mother (Debra Monk), the film's ''Gypsy'' connection. As the most prominent of the teachers, Donna Murphy contributes emotional depth to a film that doesn't get enough from its simplistically pitched battle between aspiring youth and manipulative fogeys. Oddly enough, although the film does a good job capturing the backstage world of dance, the dance sequences themselves often seem pedestrian. Still, the producers were right to cast dancers who could act rather than try the reverse. They're easy to watch, easy to like, and they vault over the speed bumps placed in their way by the script. Anybody who's ever laced on toe shoes, or wanted to, will find something to take away from ''Center Stage.''",3,'Center Stage' makes old story fresh,991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,3435,"['story', 'old', 'energies', 'are', 'new', 'Center', 'Stage', 'film', 'carry', 'familiar', 'backstage', 'elements', 'spirited', 'ensemble', 'appealing', 'young', 'newcomers', 'essentially', 'year', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theatre', 'school', 'will', 'end', 'advancement', 'very', 'few', 'heartbreak', 'most', 'made', 'bluntly', 'clear', 'outset', 'company', 'kingpin', 'played', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'certain', 'arrogance', 'also', 'way', 'not', 'wrong', 'be', 'as', 'demanding', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'echoes', 'past', 'backstage', 'sagas', 'godlike', 'choreographer', 'A', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'long', ""'re"", 'also', 'sensing', 'ghosts', 'Turning', 'Point', 'Stage', 'Door', 'Flashdance', 'Gypsy', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Center', 'Stage', 'kept', 'seeming', 'old', 'hackneyed', 'explosions', 'freshness', 'young', 'performers', 'One', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'bona', 'fide', 'ABT', 'star', 'film', 'prominent', 'soloist', 'who', 'feeling', 'confined', 'strict', 'parameters', 'company', 'repertoire', 'push', 'off', 'looser', 'freer', 'kind', 'choreography', 'also', 'coming', 'off', 'short', 'end', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'involving', 'Gallagher', 'top', 'dog', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'affections', 'competed.Not', 'surprisingly', 'big', 'climactic', 'dance', 'academy', 'graduation', 'recital', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'benefit', 'mixes', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'devolution', 'classical', 'ballet', 'something', 'more', 'street-flavored', 'expect', 'much', 'given', 'way', 'relaxing', 'ride', 'motorcycle', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'Broadway', 'dance', 'studio', 'exchange', 'Kenneth', 'MacMillan', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'change', 'pace', 'When', 'Amanda', 'Schull', 'young', 'ballet', 'maverick', 'Jody', ""n't"", 'long', ""'re"", 'doing', 'own', 'variations', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Stage', 'filled', 'mavericks', 'Schull', 'real', 'life', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Ballet', 'corps', 'member', 'dancing', 'pure', 'determination', 'having', 'been', 'told', 'day', 'one', 'body', 'type', 'not', 'balletic', 'ideal', 'hard', 'projects', 'charisma', 'glow', 'mavericks', 'also', 'are', 'uninhibited', 'mouthing', 'off', 'teachers', 'especially', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Eva', 'one', 'quietest', 'young', 'dancers', 'ABT', 'corps', 'Sascha', 'Radetsky', 'Charlie', 'eye', 'Jody', 'too', 'remarkable', 'airy', 'elevations', 'besides', 'Not', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'dancers', 'Ilia', 'Kulik', 'who', 'resident', 'Russian', 'troupe', 'Russian', 'ice-skating', 'champ.The', 'Stage', 'Door', 'echo', 'competitive', 'roommating', 'Jody', 'Eva', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'unhappy', 'bulimic', 'prize', 'pupil', 'Maureen', 'being', 'shoved', 'stardom', 'unfulfilled', 'mother', 'Debra', 'Monk', 'film', 'Gypsy', 'connection', 'most', 'prominent', 'teachers', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'emotional', 'depth', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'simplistically', 'pitched', 'battle', 'aspiring', 'youth', 'manipulative', 'fogeys', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'backstage', 'world', 'dance', 'dance', 'often', 'seem', 'pedestrian', 'Still', 'producers', 'were', 'right', 'cast', 'dancers', 'who', 'could', 'act', 'rather', 'try', 'reverse', ""'re"", 'easy', 'watch', 'easy', 'like', 'vault', 'speed', 'bumps', 'placed', 'way', 'script', 'Anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'laced', 'toe', 'shoes', 'wanted', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'take', 'away', 'Center', 'Stage']",Center Stage VHS

The problem was that none of them wanted to see a movie with Peter Gallagher.  I even advertised on line for a date, and got not one reply.Well, I went to see it at the bargain matinee at the SONY Metreon here in San Francisco, and even on a small screen I was captivated.  The story is filled with cliches, but they're my cliches!  They're actually the cliches of every 20th Century Fox movie from the 1920s onward that focuses on three girls in the big city, from How to Marry a Millionaire through The Best of Everything and even Valley of the Dolls.  Often, in this formula, there's a fourth girl who doesn't exactly fit in with the others in some way--really it's a three and a half girl movie formula.  Like in Valley of the Dolls you have Helen Lawson.  Often the fourth girl is more tragic than the others, attempts suicide or something.  This happens in Where the Boys Are for example.  Well, in CENTER STAGE the three girls are Jody, the blonde heroine; Eva, the black middle class girl who's always smoking a cigarette (my wife says that Zoe Saldana relies entirely on cigarettes to perform her idea of characterization) and Maureen, the perfect dancer who is the victim of an emotionally abusive stage mother (Debra Monk).  The fourth girl, Emily, is too small a part really to count, but she's the chubby one.The men are a mixed bag but Ethan Stiefel dances beautifully.  He is no Baryshnikov in looks however, and that hairdo is a mistake gone wild!  (Even Baryshnikov couldn't have carried off that haircut.)

A lot of previous reviewers have complained about all the stereotypes in the movie, but the fact of the matter is, those stereotypes EXIST.  In mass quantities, I might add!  MOST dancers fall into one of those categories; if they had not been in there, quite frankly, it wouldn't have been very true to reality.  So I was glad they put them in.I do agree that some of the acting isn't exactly earth-shattering.  On the other hand, this is a movie about DANCE, and I would rather see them employ DANCERS than actors.  There is nothing more annoying than watching an actor who can't dance try and pull it off, it just doesn't work.  So I was glad they went with that particular choice.  The actors they had that didn't dance didn't actually HAVE to.  For example, Peter Gallagher.  Peter Gallagher wouldn't have been my first choice to cast as the director of a major company, but when he first came onto the screen, I laughed out loud!  He played the role PERFECTLY!  I watched him and thought, &quot;Oh, my gosh, it's all the directors and teachers that I had when I was a ballet dancer!&quot;  He couldn't have done it any better if he actually WAS a ballet director.The story, though predictable, was still sweet, and the characters ended up being pretty likable.But, of course, the dancing is why you watch this movie.  The dancing is wonderful.  The only thing that bothered me AT ALL was the fact that some of the final dance number is blatantly IMPOSSIBLE to do onstage, but oh well, it was incredibly fun to watch anyway!  I love classical ballet, but when you can successfully mix the classical and the funk, that's fabulous too!All in all, a very good movie, one of the best dance movies out there!

There are several love triangles and some surprises in the plot.But most of all -- there is the dancing.  Ah, the dancing!  There's classical ballet and Latin dancing and a finale that combines elements of jazz, modern and ballet.  The music is perfect for the dance pieces.

I was as tired as hell, but I couldn't not watch it.  I fell in love with the dancing, the music and Sascha Ridetski.  It's about a group of up and comming dancers who want to make it into the best ballet school and their struggles with their performances, weight and love lives.  It's not necessarily only a chick flick, but obviously has that as it's main fan base.  A lot of the main characters are actuall ballet dancers in real life and therefore their acting isn't as strong as it could have been, but even so, it's done well overall.  It even stars Ilya Koulik who is an Olympic Gold medalist in ice-skating.

The plot is contrived as anything...the naive new ballerina Jody Sawyer (played by real life ballet dancer Amanda Schull) gets accepted to the premier ballet school in New York, feels inadequate compared to her technique-saavy classmates, ends up sleeping with a cocky choreographer, gets screwed over by him, and ends up stealing the show in the end...AND getting the nice guy to boot.Other cast members are as equally contrived...""Maureen"", the prima donna bulemic who ends up finally getting a real life and realizing she hasn't been dancing for the right reasons.  ""Eve"" the girl with the attitude and a heart of gold who ends up with as equally contrite a happy ending as Jody.  All in all, the typical recipe for your standard chick flick.What sets this apart...the dancing!  It is great that they cast actual ballet dancers in this movie.  It lends both credibility and a breath of fresh air to the film (I can't imagine if they tried making the entire cast actors;  it would have been totally fake and ridiculous to watch).  Featuring both a principal (the callous ""Cooper Nielson"") and a corps dancer (the TOTALLY hunky ""Charlie"") from the actual American Ballet Theater, you get a real glimpse of what ballet really is up close.  Just watching it will make you want to work harder at whatever you do....these dancers work their tails off!The DVD also features Mandy Moore's video for the theme (""I Wanna Be With You"") as well as bios for some of the cast and a very brief and uninformative featurette on the movie.

After Jody gets hired, she moves in with two roommates, named Eva and Maureen. They all become really good friends with three other guys that stay in the same building: Eric, Sergei, and Charlie. During all this Maureen finds herself in a position where she decides the rest of her life and stops dancing.The main reason why I picked this movie is because I related to them learning dances and for the most part dancing. One of the scenes during the movie shows them in class choreographing a part and they repeat it over and over to make sure it's correct. This movie is truly about people who love to dance and what they go through on a day-to-day basis. When I first watched this movie I felt a connection when they performed certain choreographs. During one scene we see dancers fixing their shoes and warmingup before class. This shows how much effort dancers really put into each particular step.Another major thing I can relate to in Center Stage is how these six people moved to New York to dance. When I was seven I went to New York with my dance company and went through many things they did. We all came to dance, danced hard, went site-seeing, and enjoyed our stay.

Better, yes... good, even... but not as great as the previews make it seem like she is going to get. The plot, to me, seemed hackneyed and weak... a young girl going after something she wants, another young girl going after it just because it was her mother's dream, a rivalry between two guys for one girl, a guy treating a girl badly, eating disorders in young successful girls... these simple and overdone themes were not even treated in a deep or different way.

Sasha Radetsky as the sweet and talented dancer Charlie was so endearing in this movie and his dancing and acting in the movie were more than perfect. Peter Gallagher fit the part perfectly as Jonathan who runs the American Ballet Company, his character is both egotistical and harsh and Peter does it so well.

Unfortunately, the Company will only accept three boys and three girls from the Academy, based on their performances in the final workshop.  Jody's first day at the Academy couldn't be any better.  She runs into the Academy's finest and best-looking dancer -- Cooper Neilson, she meets her new roomates: Eva (a beautiful dancer who won't be pushed around) and Maureen [the girl everyone envies and is virtually already accepted into the Academy (but she has to cope with a pushy mother and bulimia)], and she makes friends with three boys at the Academy: Charlie, Sergei, and Erik.  Even though it is obvious that Charlie wants Jody, Jody wants Cooper.  After going to a dance class outside of the Academy and running into Cooper, her knight in shining armor takes her to his apartment and they sleep together that night.  When Charlie and Jody both get roles in the final workshop that Cooper is going to choreograph, they are thrilled.  Cooper is designing a modern ballet: Jody is set to be the ballerina-in-training, Charlie is to be her attractive instructor, and Erik is the dashing motorcycle rider that swipes the ballerina off her toe shoes.  One night, Jody goes to see one a ballet that Cooper is starring in and is horrified to see him leaving with another girl and taking no notice of her.  Practices start to get tense when Jody refuses to take orders from Cooper and when Charlie and Cooper start showing off for Jody.

If neither impresses, you would be wise to give ""Center Stage"" a wide berth because they are very accurate representations of the film. The story is fairly simple, the focus is on three girls who aspire to a position with the fictional American Ballet Center in New York City. Well, they sort of aspire. The bulimic one (Maureen) is only doing it because her mother is pushing her, the girl next door one (Jody) is wondering if the company is too restrictive, and the angry one (Eva) is considering getting work as a Hooters waitress instead. Eva's seemingly bad attitude disguises the fact that she actually has the best attitude, she is there because she loves to dance.There is a love triangle between Jody and two guys, she sleeps with the one she loves (Cooper), he does not love her but he gives her the female lead in a ballet he has choreographed. He gives the male lead to the guy who loves her. Coincidentally Cooper's ballet is about a similar love triangle.This is not exactly new territory, think ""Flashdance"", ""Fame"", and ""Brave New Girl"". Don't expect Fellini's ""Variety Lights"". The plot is painfully contrived but the saving grace is the wonderful dancing and the realistic portrayal of the grind of dance school. The DVD has a ton of nice special features including extended dance sequences.The acting is nonprofessional but the director knows the limitations of his ensemble and does not ask them to do anything very difficult, at least acting-wise. The movie is full of mild melodrama, but stays nicely real life and doesn't amp the conflicts and love stories into an overwrought mess.The theme is the standard one about going after your dream through hard work and dedication, but they also focus on the necessity of first making sure that it is actually your dream.

556011,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B00004WMDT,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[7, 7]","While ballet purists knowledgeable in dance and technique might be put off by this film, balletomanes and lovers of dance films will find this movie a real treat. The plot is very Hollywood and predictable, but it's a predictability that is enjoyable to watch. Yes, you have your stereotypical characters, but there's still a ring of truth to them. As a former ballet student, I can tell you I've met all of these characters and then some. Unfortunately the movie exaggerates a few of the characters to the point of absurdity, such as the ballet mother. When her daughter Maureen admits her eating disorder, the ballet mother justifies the bulimia by saying her daughter is simply watching her weight. I find it hard to believe that any mother would approve of her daughter's bulimia, no matter how ambitious. Eating disorders are apparent in this film--one only has to look at the cast members to see that. Julie Kent is painfully thin and an all too-realistic reminder of ballet's stringent body requirements for female ballet dancers which drives them to anorexia and bulimia. I absolutely adored Zoe Saldana's scene-stealing character of the sassy Eva, and I think many dancers secretly wish they had her moxie. I don't feel Eva exists in the ballet world. She would have been thrown out of such a prestigious ballet school a long time ago-only choreographers and premier danseurs/prima ballerinas can get by with such behavior. Indeed, Eva's sudden substitution for Maureen in the student ballet is pure Hollywood fantasy--no way would Eva go undetected behind the scenes in an actual performance. But it's things like that which makes the movie so likeable. My only disappointment was discovering from the Director's Commentary that Saldana had a dance double for that dance sequence (except for closeup shots). Amanda Schull (a former Hawaii girl) is softly radiant as Jody Sawyer and does do her own dancing. Julie Kent dances exquisitely and Ethan Stiefel is simply amazing.",4,Feel Good Film for Dance Lovers &amp; Ilia Kulik Fans,992736000,"06 17, 2001",2001,1983,"['ballet', 'purists', 'knowledgeable', 'dance', 'technique', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'film', 'balletomanes', 'lovers', 'dance', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'real', 'treat', 'plot', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'predictable', 'predictability', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Yes', 'have', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'still', 'ring', 'truth', 'former', 'ballet', 'student', 'can', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'met', 'characters', 'then', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'few', 'characters', 'point', 'absurdity', 'such', 'ballet', 'mother', 'When', 'daughter', 'Maureen', 'eating', 'disorder', 'ballet', 'mother', 'bulimia', 'saying', 'daughter', 'simply', 'watching', 'weight', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'mother', 'would', 'approve', 'daughter', 'bulimia', 'matter', 'how', 'ambitious', 'Eating', 'disorders', 'are', 'apparent', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'look', 'cast', 'members', 'see', 'Julie', 'Kent', 'painfully', 'thin', 'too-realistic', 'reminder', 'ballet', 'stringent', 'body', 'requirements', 'female', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'anorexia', 'bulimia', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'scene-stealing', 'character', 'sassy', 'Eva', 'think', 'many', 'dancers', 'secretly', 'wish', 'had', 'moxie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Eva', 'exists', 'ballet', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'such', 'prestigious', 'ballet', 'school', 'long', 'time', 'ago-only', 'choreographers', 'premier', 'danseurs/prima', 'ballerinas', 'can', 'get', 'such', 'behavior', 'Indeed', 'Eva', 'sudden', 'substitution', 'Maureen', 'student', 'ballet', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy', 'way', 'would', 'Eva', 'go', 'undetected', 'scenes', 'actual', 'performance', 'things', 'movie', 'so', 'likeable', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'discovering', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'Saldana', 'had', 'dance', 'double', 'dance', 'sequence', 'closeup', 'shots', 'Amanda', 'Schull', 'former', 'Hawaii', 'girl', 'softly', 'radiant', 'Jody', 'Sawyer', 'do', 'own', 'dancing', 'Julie', 'Kent', 'exquisitely', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'simply', 'amazing']",Center Stage VHS

It hasn't left my DVD player, and I've probably watched it upwards of seven or eight times since. The cast is energetic and amazingly talented, the soundtrack is an excellent match to the various types of dance numbers, and the dancing itself is sublime.I loved the extra features on this DVD, most notably the isolated soundtrack, director's commentary, deleted scenes and the extended dance sequences. The video by Mandy Moore was also a nice touch seeing as it uses footage of the cast of Center Stage and is an excellent song on its own.The isolated soundtrack works well with the workshop numbers as well as the club scene. The commentary by Nicholas Hytner was interesting as well--for example, the NY skyline in the dance studio was simply a very large transparency. He also addresses technical aspects of shooting dancers and the infamous dance studio mirrors. There are only two deleted scenes: one of Cooper at a rehearsal for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; as he chats with Joan Miller, and one where Charlie performs a solo number in rehearsal, featuring stunning footwork and a playful mood.The extended dance sequences flow much more smoothly without the constant cuts to the rather bored-looking audience, allowing the footwork and energy to shine through uninterrupted.Although quips have been made regarding the acting abilities of the mostly dance-oriented cast, I thought that everyone involved did an outstanding job.
