889095,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0007SMGUC,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 7]","What happens when two sisters join together to fight for victory in a hair styling championship? The result is ""Hair Show"" a poorly made movie that tries to be funny, tries to tell a comprehensive story, and tries to make its lead characters compelling but falls flat at every turn.The direction of this movie is weak, and most every moment is predictable. After watching a few minutes, you can accurately predict what will happen at the end of the movie. It is one- hundred percent Hollywood formula from the beginning to the finish line. There is nothing unique or original in this film.This movie stars Monique Imes- Jackson and Kellita Smith in the two lead roles and these two lasses are good enough to make some parts of the movie nearly bearable. They don't have very good chemistry between them and you already know how the story will end before it even gets started, but they at least offer some ""C"" grade performances.The supporting cast of this movie is weak and most of them could have been replaced or eliminated completely from the movie without doing any damage. No one stands out in the supporting cast, and the director did a poor job in her selection. Add to that the stereotyping and the bad attempts at humor and you have an overall bad movie- one that should be avoided entirely if you have any respect for American made motion pictures.",1,Hair Show is One Bad Flick,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1358,"['What', 'when', 'two', 'sisters', 'join', 'together', 'fight', 'victory', 'hair', 'styling', 'championship', 'result', 'Hair', 'Show', 'poorly', 'made', 'movie', 'be', 'funny', 'tries', 'tell', 'comprehensive', 'story', 'tries', 'make', 'lead', 'characters', 'compelling', 'flat', 'turn.The', 'direction', 'movie', 'weak', 'most', 'moment', 'predictable', 'watching', 'few', 'minutes', 'can', 'accurately', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'movie', 'one-', 'hundred', 'percent', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'beginning', 'finish', 'line', 'nothing', 'unique', 'original', 'film.This', 'movie', 'stars', 'Monique', 'Imes-', 'Jackson', 'Kellita', 'Smith', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'two', 'lasses', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'parts', 'movie', 'nearly', 'bearable', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'end', 'even', 'started', 'least', 'offer', 'C', 'grade', 'performances.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'movie', 'weak', 'most', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'eliminated', 'completely', 'movie', 'doing', 'damage', 'one', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'director', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'selection', 'Add', 'stereotyping', 'bad', 'attempts', 'humor', 'have', 'overall', 'bad', 'movie-', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'entirely', 'have', 'respect', 'American', 'made', 'motion', 'pictures']",N/A

It is about family relationships and how we all need to get over past grievances with them, no matter how many times they screw over us.  Mo'Nique wasn't at her funniest but then again, this movie is rated PG-13.  As for the things that go on at a salon, people, these things really DO happen.  If this movie came out in the 70's, it would have been called a blaxploitation flick.  The movie has several meanings...but, did any of us hear about it going to theatres?

889098,A7MGTFQGXR8KL,B0007SMGUC,J. Rogers,"[1, 3]","I got this movie because after a search it was the only one I could find for Keiko Agena that plays Lane Kim on Gilmore girls TV progam. She plays a totally different charactor in this movie though, one that does not smile much and does not seem to be a very happy person. I like the charactor she plays on the Gilmore girls a lot better. At least there they use costume to get a little comic effect out of her. She tends to hide her body and not use it as much as she could. She would be a lot closer to using her body for comedy like Lucy or Julia Roberts. She would have more distance to go to be really sexy looking and even then she would be sexy in a funny way. Perhaps she needs someone like Garry Marshall to really help her to develop herself and to more solid back up rolls like she does as Rorys best frind on the Gilmore's. It would be nice if she at least got more bit parts like Sookie. You tend to she her show up all over the place. Nothing big but at least they invite her onto the set for a day for a little bit of something.",4,Lane Kim (Keiko Agena)-,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,1043,"['got', 'movie', 'search', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'find', 'Keiko', 'Agena', 'Lane', 'Kim', 'Gilmore', 'girls', 'TV', 'progam', 'totally', 'different', 'charactor', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'smile', 'much', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'person', 'charactor', 'Gilmore', 'lot', 'better', 'least', 'use', 'costume', 'get', 'little', 'comic', 'effect', 'her', 'hide', 'body', 'not', 'use', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'closer', 'using', 'body', 'comedy', 'Lucy', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'distance', 'go', 'be', 'really', 'sexy', 'looking', 'even', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'sexy', 'funny', 'way', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'really', 'help', 'develop', 'more', 'solid', 'back', 'up', 'rolls', 'Rorys', 'best', 'frind', 'Gilmore', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'least', 'got', 'more', 'bit', 'parts', 'Sookie', 'tend', 'show', 'up', 'place', 'Nothing', 'big', 'least', 'invite', 'set', 'day', 'little', 'bit', 'something']",N/A
