27712,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,0780607465,Crazy Jim,"[2, 3]","Cashing in on their popularity at the time as hosts of &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;, Doctor Dre and Ed Lover play two mediocre Harlem barbers who decide to become police officers. When their best friend is murdered by a crooked land developer, they make it their point to find out what's really behind all the problems in the neighborhood. &quot;Who's The Man?&quot; will never be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece but it does get the most out of its two stars as well as the countless performers who make cameos (most of them are late 80's rap icons). Denis Leary, in particular, steals the show as a short-tempered superior officer whose profanity-laced tirades make for some first-rate entertainment. While this movie borrows quite a bit from other films (most noticeably &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;), it never tries to take itself too seriously. The chemistry between Dre and Lover is solid and the wild over-the-top characters make for some amusing moments. If nothing else, it's worthy of &quot;cult&quot; status.",3,&quot;Who's The Man?&quot; Review,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,1019,"['Cashing', 'popularity', 'time', 'hosts', 'quot', 'MTV', 'Raps', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Dre', 'Ed', 'Lover', 'play', 'two', 'mediocre', 'Harlem', 'barbers', 'who', 'decide', 'become', 'police', 'officers', 'When', 'best', 'friend', 'murdered', 'crooked', 'land', 'developer', 'make', 'point', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'problems', 'neighborhood', 'quot', 'Who', 'Man', 'quot', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'regarded', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'get', 'most', 'two', 'stars', 'as', 'well', 'countless', 'performers', 'who', 'make', 'cameos', 'most', 'are', 'late', '80', 'rap', 'icons', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'particular', 'show', 'short-tempered', 'superior', 'officer', 'profanity-laced', 'tirades', 'make', 'first-rate', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'other', 'films', 'most', 'noticeably', 'quot', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'quot', 'never', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'chemistry', 'Dre', 'Lover', 'solid', 'wild', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'make', 'amusing', 'moments', 'nothing', 'else', 'worthy', 'quot', 'cult', 'quot', 'status']",N/A

What really completes the movie is the performance by Dennis Leary. He is SOO funny as a police sargeant who has to deal with the 2 main characters, played by Ed Lover and Dr. Dre. The movie is somewhat dated but it's a fun experience to watch, as the two newest members of the NYPD bumble their way through a crime investigation they only seem privy to. It all works out in the end, and the day is saved.
