While he is trying to learn the facts about having Christmas, his friends and family are just making it happen.Things get crazier and crazier until Shrek finally loses his temper and orders everyone out of his house.When Shrek loses his temper, and alienates everyone, will he be able to have a merry Christmas?This is the basic plot in a nutshell.  It's great to see the beloved Shrek characters again, in a different venue than a full length movie.I'd give the special itself 4 stars, but the DVD only 3 stars.  Below is why:Even though I enjoyed seeing the Christmas special, I would like to see more Shrek holiday specials on the same DVD.  It's a fun special to watch and a good addition to the Christmas classics list, but by itself it isn't a great value at $20 or so.Put simply:  Most DVDs provide more than 22 minutes of entertainment.  Even if they have short cartoons (think the Bugs Bunny DVDs or the Animatrix), they pack the DVD with far more than 22 minutes of material.I'd say wait for it to come on TV and tape (or DVR) it.  It's definitely worth seeing, but a 22 minute DVD shouldn't cost anywhere near what a full feature length movie costs.If there were another holiday special or two on it (Halloween or Thanksgiving anyone?), with the same quality and humor put into this one, it'd be well worth the money.

1167525,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001AQT112,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Three and a half stars for SHREK THE HALLS.What the moneymakers are counting on is that, come the holidays, this short film about Shrek celebrating Christmas and mucking it up will prove too irresistible to pass up, especially if you have kids who are bigtime Shrek fans. Yes, for its asking price (currently set at $11.99) and with the film's running time of 28 minutes or so, SHREK THE HALLS isn't really worth shelling out for, especially since it's bound to decrease if you just ride it out. But, man, it's Christmas time right now. So, me, I shelled out.If you want to get really nitpicky, the film is 28 minutes but the story proper only takes up around 22 minutes, with extensive end credits. Chronology wise, SHREK THE HALLS takes place sometime after SHREK THE THIRD and, presumably, before the upcoming SHREK GOES FOURTH. The story itself is routine but likable. It explores the Christmasy themes very well, but thru Shrek's ever cranky viewpoint. Like Jack Skellington before him, Shrek isn't too up on Christmas and its meaning and traditions, instead having to rely on the how-to book Christmas for Village Idiots. Still, he prepares for a quiet Christmas evening with Fiona and their three adorable ogre infants. But his raucous friends aren't about to be left out. Cue the expected shenanigans, and Shrek's inevitable temper tantrum.While, with each successive entry, the Shrek franchise has continued to lose its edginess, it hasn't completely done away with those tiny subversive touches. To me, this movie's highlight is the Gingerbread Man's disturbing (though hilarious) interpretation of Santa Claus. And, I know it's just a cartoon, but it's gratifying watching Shrek engaged in domestic bliss and hanging out with his kids. Another neat thing going on is that the key voice actors reprise their roles for this TV special (I'm thinking, there must've been a proviso in Myers, Diaz, Murphy, and Banderas's contracts). And, no worries, the animation features the same excellent quality found in the Shrek feature films.The DVD gives you the option of viewing the film either in widescreen or full frame. Special Features include: The ""12 Days of Christmas"" & ""Deck the Halls"" Sing Alongs; Gingy's Dunking Game challenges the kids to pick out the cookies in the batch most closely resembling the Gingerbread Man; upon installation of the Shrek Carnival Craze Video Game Demo, the kids can indulge in three fun activities: Royal Hoopla (a javelin toss), The Melon Bowl (bowling game), and Three-Wheeled Thrills (a tricycle race); the Animation Video Jukebox lets you play back musical scenes pulled from DreamWorks films like the SHREK films, THE BEE MOVIE, A SHARK'S TALE, etc. (the best, if you ask me, is Donkey and Puss in Boots covering ""Living La Vida Loca"").SHREK THE HALLS debuted as an ABC holiday special on November of '07 and, as expected, it killed on the Nielsen ratings. But, you have to ask yourself, is the DVD worth the asking price? I doubt it. If you wait long enough, SHREK THE HALLS will probably be released as part of a SHREK package. That's the one to jump on. But, to assist the indecisive consumer, know that there's a dancing roast turkey in the film, and that the Gingerbread Man poops. If that's any kind of incentive.",4,"A domesticated ogre's swampy Christmas - but, for us, a stocking half-stuffed",1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,3266,"['Three', 'half', 'stars', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS.What', 'moneymakers', 'are', 'counting', 'come', 'holidays', 'short', 'film', 'Shrek', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'mucking', 'up', 'will', 'prove', 'too', 'irresistible', 'pass', 'up', 'especially', 'have', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'bigtime', 'Shrek', 'fans', 'Yes', 'asking', 'price', 'currently', 'set', '11.99', 'film', 'running', 'time', '28', 'minutes', 'so', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'shelling', 'out', 'especially', 'bound', 'decrease', 'just', 'ride', 'out', 'man', 'Christmas', 'time', 'right', 'now', 'So', 'shelled', 'want', 'get', 'really', 'nitpicky', 'film', '28', 'minutes', 'story', 'only', 'up', 'around', '22', 'minutes', 'extensive', 'end', 'credits', 'Chronology', 'wise', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'place', 'sometime', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'presumably', 'upcoming', 'SHREK', 'GOES', 'FOURTH', 'story', 'routine', 'likable', 'Christmasy', 'themes', 'very', 'well', 'thru', 'Shrek', 'ever', 'cranky', 'viewpoint', 'Jack', 'Skellington', 'Shrek', ""n't"", 'too', 'up', 'Christmas', 'meaning', 'traditions', 'instead', 'having', 'rely', 'how-to', 'book', 'Christmas', 'Village', 'Idiots', 'Still', 'quiet', 'Christmas', 'evening', 'Fiona', 'three', 'adorable', 'ogre', 'infants', 'raucous', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'out', 'Cue', 'expected', 'shenanigans', 'Shrek', 'inevitable', 'temper', 'tantrum.While', 'successive', 'entry', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'continued', 'lose', 'edginess', ""n't"", 'completely', 'done', 'away', 'tiny', 'subversive', 'touches', 'movie', 'highlight', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'disturbing', 'hilarious', 'interpretation', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'know', 'just', 'cartoon', 'gratifying', 'watching', 'Shrek', 'engaged', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'hanging', 'out', 'kids', 'neat', 'thing', 'going', 'key', 'voice', 'actors', 'reprise', 'roles', 'TV', 'special', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'proviso', 'Myers', 'Diaz', 'Murphy', 'Banderas', 'contracts', 'worries', 'animation', 'same', 'excellent', 'quality', 'found', 'Shrek', 'feature', 'films.The', 'DVD', 'option', 'viewing', 'film', 'widescreen', 'full', 'frame', 'Special', 'Features', 'include', '12', 'Days', 'Christmas', 'Deck', 'Halls', 'Sing', 'Alongs', 'Gingy', 'Dunking', 'Game', 'kids', 'pick', 'out', 'cookies', 'batch', 'most', 'closely', 'resembling', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'installation', 'Shrek', 'Carnival', 'Craze', 'Video', 'Game', 'Demo', 'kids', 'can', 'indulge', 'three', 'fun', 'activities', 'Royal', 'Hoopla', 'javelin', 'toss', 'Melon', 'Bowl', 'bowling', 'game', 'Three-Wheeled', 'Thrills', 'tricycle', 'race', 'Animation', 'Video', 'Jukebox', 'play', 'back', 'musical', 'scenes', 'pulled', 'DreamWorks', 'films', 'SHREK', 'films', 'THE', 'BEE', 'MOVIE', 'A', 'SHARK', 'TALE', 'etc', 'best', 'ask', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'covering', 'Living', 'La', 'Vida', 'Loca', '.SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'debuted', 'ABC', 'holiday', 'special', 'November', ""'07"", 'expected', 'killed', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'have', 'ask', 'DVD', 'asking', 'price', 'doubt', 'wait', 'long', 'enough', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'released', 'part', 'SHREK', 'package', 'one', 'jump', 'assist', 'indecisive', 'consumer', 'know', 'dancing', 'roast', 'turkey', 'film', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'kind', 'incentive']",Shrek the Halls

Also that has nothing to do with the quality of this holiday special.This is a great show.  It is very high quality, is funny on numerous levels.  Both adults and children will find it highly entertaining.  Watching Shrek and Fiona decorate for the holidays is a blast.  There is a moral to the story too.My personal favorite part is where Puss n' Boots tells his version of the Christmas story and get very distracted.My husband and I have probably watched this 5 or 6 times by ourselves in the last couple years and my son has watched it 3 or 4 times this year.  My son is almost 2 and this show is the perfect length for him.
