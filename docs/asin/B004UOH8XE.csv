Suffice to say that the slacker Sam doesn't do a very good job getting the boy to the authorities, and instead lets him hang around for the better part of a week (totally implausible!)  There are a few moments like that sprinkled throughout the movie (things that are hard to imagine, things that are too tied up too neatly in a bow).

I fully enjoyed the characters - and their lives.Three friends come to the fore in this movie, each one is approaching a crisis in their lives. As each one faces it, we discover the meaning of friendship and loving support. In the beginning, each one has lost their way and facing an uncertain future. Although the movie only covers a little out of a week in their lives, we watch how as they face the crisis, they are able to move forward from this point. A very positive and very real movie.What surprised me inside of the movie is that while Rasheen played a part, the focus was on Sam and his growth through knowing Rasheen, instead of this being a kid-centered movie. And yes, as Sam discovers in the movie, there are consequences to taking a child home with you, and facing these consequences helps Sam to face his own crisis.It calls itself ""The Best Date Movie of the Year,"" and I can see both men and women enjoying it - and even more, talking about it afterwards.The movie is rated ""R"" for adult themes including sex and drinking, and a bit of rough language. However, there is nothing explicit, and the language is minimal.

Luckily the quality of the content makes up for the lousy title.It's a love story that actually manages to keep me -a 31-year old man who normally HATES love stories- interested.  That's impressive!  It's about three different couples with their own dilemmas.  This is a drama, not a comedy.  I guess if there is any comedy, it's not really the kind you want to laugh out loud at.  It's more like ""Oh, haha"" and that's it.One couple contemplates whether to live in either New York or Los Angeles and the tough obstacles associated with such a tremendous decision.  This was easily the weakest of the three stories.  I didn't really care for anything this couple did or said the whole time.  The second story -arguably the most important and biggest one- involves a single man who inadvertently kidnaps a young kid because for some reason he doesn't know what to do when he sees the kid stranded (which might make this guy the most clueless and irresponsible person in the world when you think about it) and eventually impresses a girl he meets at a bar while dragging the kid all around town.  He tries to ditch the kid a few times but ultimately -thanks to regret usually- it never happens.The final story centers around a bald-headed woman (maybe she had cancer, maybe not- was never really sure) who constantly makes terrible decisions and hooks up with the wrong men that only leave her feeling emptiness inside.  This final one is the most underrated of the three storylines because, in my opinion, it has the best conclusion and actually makes me feel somewhat emotional and satisfied... remember, I'm NOT a fan of these type of love movies so simply allowing me to feel anything at all is a tremendous piece of writing in my eyes.With all that said, there never really was a purpose or a moral at the very end.  Basically it's 3 relationships that develop fairly normally with the occasional awkwardness at other times (a kidnapped boy sleeping in a room while a man is trying to impress a girl in the other room isn't particularly normal, heh) but I suppose if there *is* a moral it's that all men around 30 years old (like me for example!) are really childish (yes, I am!) and don't know how to take relationships seriously (once again, it's like watching a spittin' image of me on screen, lol).  Overall however, I was actually entertained and even grew attached by such simple writing and characters, and I can't help but recommend it.Oh and on a final note- the soundtrack is AWESOME!  I'm not really aware of the current music scene and instead stick to my mid 70's German rock music (Tangerine Dream anyone?) or rockin' down to GFR (tell everybody you know you got some rock 'n roll soul!) but these songs are really melodic, upbeat and amazingly sung.",4,worst movie title ever,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,2803,"['Seriously', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'saying', 'Luckily', 'quality', 'content', 'up', 'lousy', 'title.It', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'keep', '-a', '31-year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'normally', 'HATES', 'stories-', 'interested', 'impressive', 'three', 'different', 'couples', 'own', 'dilemmas', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy', 'guess', 'comedy', 'not', 'really', 'kind', 'want', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'Oh', 'haha', 'it.One', 'couple', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'tough', 'obstacles', 'associated', 'tremendous', 'decision', 'was', 'easily', 'weakest', 'three', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'anything', 'couple', 'did', 'said', 'whole', 'time', 'second', 'story', '-arguably', 'most', 'important', 'biggest', 'one-', 'single', 'man', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'young', 'kid', 'reason', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'kid', 'stranded', 'might', 'make', 'guy', 'most', 'clueless', 'irresponsible', 'person', 'world', 'when', 'think', 'eventually', 'girl', 'bar', 'dragging', 'kid', 'town', 'ditch', 'kid', 'few', 'times', 'ultimately', '-thanks', 'regret', 'usually-', 'never', 'happens.The', 'final', 'story', 'centers', 'bald-headed', 'woman', 'maybe', 'had', 'cancer', 'maybe', 'not-', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'who', 'constantly', 'terrible', 'decisions', 'up', 'wrong', 'men', 'only', 'leave', 'feeling', 'emptiness', 'inside', 'final', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'three', 'storylines', 'because', 'opinion', 'best', 'conclusion', 'actually', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'emotional', 'satisfied', 'remember', ""'m"", 'fan', 'type', 'love', 'movies', 'so', 'simply', 'allowing', 'feel', 'anything', 'tremendous', 'piece', 'writing', 'eyes.With', 'said', 'never', 'really', 'was', 'purpose', 'moral', 'very', 'end', 'Basically', '3', 'relationships', 'develop', 'fairly', 'normally', 'occasional', 'awkwardness', 'other', 'times', 'kidnapped', 'boy', 'sleeping', 'room', 'man', 'trying', 'impress', 'girl', 'other', 'room', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'normal', 'heh', 'suppose', '*is*', 'moral', 'men', '30', 'years', 'old', 'example', 'are', 'really', 'childish', 'yes', 'am', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'take', 'relationships', 'seriously', 'once', 'again', 'watching', 'spittin', 'image', 'screen', 'lol', 'Overall', 'however', 'was', 'actually', 'entertained', 'even', 'grew', 'attached', 'such', 'simple', 'writing', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'recommend', 'it.Oh', 'final', 'note-', 'soundtrack', 'AWESOME', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'aware', 'current', 'music', 'scene', 'instead', 'stick', 'mid', '70', 'German', 'rock', 'music', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'anyone', 'rockin', 'down', 'GFR', 'tell', 'everybody', 'know', 'got', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'soul', 'songs', 'are', 'really', 'melodic', 'upbeat', 'amazingly', 'sung']",N/A

I presume it's the same thought processes that led this film's screenwriter to think it was a good movie.The story concerns Sam, a freelance short story writer who is dissatisfied with a career that's enabled him to have a nice apartment in New York City. One day while riding the subway, he sees a young boy get separated from the people he's with. He makes a half-hearted attempt to get the kid to the police and reunited with his legal guardians, but after a token resistance from the boy, he gives up and take the kid home to live on his couch. Yes, this actually happens in this film. Oh, and he also meets a woman named Mississippi. Indeed.Intercut with his story are two others, one of which is boring (a woman and her boyfriend are having relationship issues that seem to exist entirely within her head and might have to move to Los Angeles. Did you know that hip, New York-dwelling twentysomethings hate LA?), and the other of which is interesting (a hairless woman is courted by a man who isn't her type). Had the film focused on that second story, it might have worked well.Aside from that one plot, which isn't really much more than an afterthought, no part of this movie works, and its riddled with indie film cliches. Ironic New Yorkers hate Los Angeles! People in their twenties are scared of relationships! Not shaving for a week makes you look cool and interesting instead of like a twit who can't afford a razor. About the only cliche it manages to avoid is gay cowboys eating pudding, and if they'd had a hip and ironic way of working that into the story, I'm sure it would have been there.There's nothing really original or noteworthy here. The plot is pretty unrealistic. None of the characters are especially likable, except possibly Sam 2 and Anne. None of them are people I want to spend five minutes with, much less 98.

He plays Sam, a struggling writer who connects with Rasheen, a lost boy, on the subway. At first, Sam wants to help the boy get home, but after learning Rasheen is in foster care, he lets him stay at his apartment for a few days. Meanwhile, Sam's best friend Annie is rejecting the advances of her odd-yet-sincere co-worker, and his cousin Mary Catherine faces major changes in her life.The story of Sam and Rasheen flows through the whole film while three subplots--Annie and her co-worker, Mary-Katherine and her boyfriend, and Sam and Mississippi (the waitress Sam falls for)--cut in and out. I found Annie's story utterly charming, and anytime Michael Algieri's Rasheen was on camera, he stole the scene. The one story line I couldn't have cared less about was Sam and Mississippi. While Kate Mara was quite likeable as Mississippi, I didn't sense any chemistry between her and Radnor. As the movie progressed, I realized I only cared about what happened to Annie and Rasheen--the rest of the stories were fine but unmemorable. I also kept asking myself when the film would turn dark--after all, though Sam had good intentions, his keeping Rasheen in his apartment was essentially kidnapping--but Radnor easily smoothed things out once the authorities became involved.

Oliver,"[0, 1]","It loses one star for what to me felt like a rushed ending, somewhat as if he was running out of money, or didn't know how to put it all together at the end, other than that however, this warm hearted little story about twenty-somethings trying to get along into adulthood, is a graceful and comic narrative, that you would expect from a twenty-something New Yorker.  These characters yearn for connection, they do stupid things and hate themselves in the morning, as we've all done before, they hunger for something that will explain their lives to them, while afraid of any change of what they know and like, because, well, what if they don't like the change.They want to connect, but they don't know how to.  They want to do right, but then what is always right.  They want what they want but they don't always know what they want.  Josh Radnor has put together a great film, his characters come to life in front of you, the story, which I will not synopsize, because, if you want a synpsosis, read it at the beginning, is a movie of New Yorkers who want to get ahead even while they're comfortable getting by.I found myself laughing constantly through the movie, enjoying every minute of it as the plot turned, and the characters tried to grow.  It felt like watching a few days in the life of good friends, for which you wanted to know more about after it ended.The one flaw in the narrative flow might be that it felt like it could've been a television series, as the editor tells Josh Radnor's character at the beginning of the story, as it's constantly referenced, he's skilled at the short, but the novel requires a little more growth and a bit more focus.

It's shorter than Is...","[0, 0]","From my experience talking with other fans about How I Met Your Mother, it seems like Josh/Ted takes the biggest and most frequent criticisms. That's what actually prompted me to see happythankyoumoreplease: the question of whether Josh's acting chops (let alone his writing and directing chops) extended beyond HIMYM in a meaningful way.The good news: they do.The bad news: I'm not sure happythankyoumoreplease enough to convince anyone.As others have said, it's hard not to think of Garden State: lead actor from a modestly successful sitcom makes a foray into writing and directing an indie film for the big screen. As different as the movies are, that's enough to invite comparison.So is Sam Wexler nothing more than a foul-mouthed Ted Mosby? No, though you can see why people might wonder that. Wexler is a writer who has sort of given up on his life being anything special, or even being anything like he hoped it would be. When a book publisher--Richard Jenkins in a very brief cameo--tells Sam that his lead character isn't compelling, we know he's talking about Sam.And that's ultimately the problem at the heart of the movie: Sam is--quite intentionally--the least compelling character in the film, and his story is about watching him become someone we're interested in.As a result, the characters around him--Kate Mara as Mississippi (...really?), Malin Akerman as Annie, Zoe Kazan as Mary Catherine and Michael Algieri as Rasheen--are a lot more interesting to follow than Sam is. Sam seems like a guy who wants to be able to rage at the universe...if only he could find it.So in the meantime, compelling, fascinating stories go on all around Sam, but he seems so self-possessed that he's unable or at least unwilling to tap into them and participate.To me, that's not your lead character: that's the quirky side-plot. The time spent with Annie and Sam #2 (Tony Hale) is much more productive, story-wise, as is the tormented relationship between Mary Catherine and Charlie (Pablo Schreiber).So ultimately, Radnor does give us something more than Ted in Sam Wexler--there are a number of things Sam does that you could never see Ted doing--but he does it in such a roundabout way that I don't think will convince anyone he's leading man material.I do think he has a future as a writer/director, and I'm sure he'll want to write himself into his films, but he'd be better served by making himself a supporting character in future projects.",3,Is Josh Radnor more than Ted Mosby?,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,2449,"['experience', 'talking', 'other', 'fans', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Josh/Ted', 'biggest', 'most', 'frequent', 'criticisms', 'what', 'actually', 'prompted', 'see', 'happythankyoumoreplease', 'question', 'Josh', 'acting', 'chops', 'let', 'alone', 'writing', 'directing', 'chops', 'extended', 'HIMYM', 'meaningful', 'way.The', 'good', 'news', 'do.The', 'bad', 'news', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'happythankyoumoreplease', 'enough', 'convince', 'anyone.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'hard', 'not', 'think', 'Garden', 'State', 'lead', 'actor', 'modestly', 'successful', 'sitcom', 'foray', 'writing', 'directing', 'indie', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'As', 'different', 'movies', 'are', 'enough', 'invite', 'comparison.So', 'Sam', 'Wexler', 'nothing', 'more', 'foul-mouthed', 'Ted', 'Mosby', 'No', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'wonder', 'Wexler', 'writer', 'who', 'sort', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'being', 'anything', 'special', 'even', 'being', 'anything', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'When', 'book', 'publisher', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'very', 'brief', 'cameo', 'tells', 'Sam', 'lead', 'character', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'know', 'talking', 'Sam.And', 'ultimately', 'problem', 'heart', 'movie', 'Sam', 'quite', 'intentionally', 'least', 'compelling', 'character', 'film', 'story', 'watching', 'become', 'someone', ""'re"", 'interested', 'in.As', 'result', 'characters', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Mississippi', 'really', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Annie', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'Michael', 'Algieri', 'Rasheen', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'follow', 'Sam', 'Sam', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'rage', 'universe', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'it.So', 'meantime', 'compelling', 'fascinating', 'stories', 'go', 'Sam', 'so', 'self-possessed', 'unable', 'least', 'unwilling', 'tap', 'participate.To', 'not', 'lead', 'character', 'quirky', 'side-plot', 'time', 'spent', 'Annie', 'Sam', '2', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'much', 'more', 'productive', 'story-wise', 'tormented', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'Charlie', 'Pablo', 'Schreiber', 'ultimately', 'Radnor', 'give', 'something', 'more', 'Ted', 'Sam', 'Wexler', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'Sam', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'Ted', 'doing', 'roundabout', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'convince', 'anyone', 'leading', 'man', 'material.I', 'do', 'think', 'future', 'writer/director', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'want', 'write', 'films', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'served', 'making', 'supporting', 'character', 'future', 'projects']",N/A

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[5, 7]","Every generation has its own coming-of-age films in which the characters learn life lessons particular to that era, but also universal. In ""Reality Bites,"" Winona Ryder learns that being smart in college does not always translate to making smart decisions in the real world.  In ""Garden State,"" Zach Braff learns that the over-medicated life is not worth living.  I'm not sure the characters in ""Clerks,"" learn anything major, but in the sequel, they grow up and purchase their own convenience store.  So that has to count, right?I couldn't help but contrast these films to Josh Radnor's ""Happythankyoumoreplease,"" which examines the lives of a handful of twenty-something New Yorkers. Radnor plays a freelance writer, who winds up accidentally caring for a young boy who is trying to avoid the foster care system.  His best friend, Annie, (Malin Akerman) is the designated ""free spirit"" of the group, who eventually finds a soulmate.  Two other friends are considering moving to Los Angeles.At one point, one of the characters mocks the idea that the white, suburban-reared Radnor is going to learn life lessons from bonding with the African-American Rasheen, and the film does a good job of avoiding becoming a copy of ""About A Boy,"" even if the fact that Radnor could manage to keep the child so long is implausible (not to mention the consequences of what's essentially kidnapping).  There were a few moments where I expected the film to turn darker, but I guess that was just my Generation X cynicism.

Two who are in a relationship and the other four who are working on it. The main story is Radnor, a short story writer, who takes in a young boy who has been run around the foster system. He's also coming to grips with the fact he might have commitment issues. Another couple is at a crossroads in their relationship and they need to make that next hurtle. In the third story, a girl in a publishing house seems to always pick the wrong guys to date. The guy who adores her, and might be Mr. Right, seems too unlike her. He needs to convince her otherwise.Radnor seems a decent sort and he writes himself that way. His character, Sam, has a good heart but suffers some issues he needs to address. He spends the movie working on things. Kate Mara, as Mississippi, is his 'hope to be' love interest, if he can can resolve things with his demons. Malin Akerman is better than I've ever seen her as Annie, who needs to see that she's worth having a guy who will be good to her. Someone whom she won't need to babysit. Bram Barouh and Zoe Kazan play Spencer and Mary who are working to get to the next level in their relationship. All do a fine job. This is very viewer friendly. Maybe too much so. Radnor is from TV world and it shows here. He felt a bit too much need to resolve all, or most, of the stories.  But you do like these people and root for them. They are all maybe a bit too self aware but they know who they are both in their strong and weak suits. They know what they need to do.Josh shoots New York lovingly.

While rushing to make it on time to an interview with a publisher, he rescues a cute orphan boy, Rasheen, who is lost on the subway.  The interview is ruined.  To complicate matters, Rasheen won't allow Sam to take him to the police.  Sam falls in love with Mississippi, a gorgeous waitress who is a struggling singer.  Sam's best friend, Annie, has low self esteem because of an autoimmune deficiency that has left her bald; she is attracted to losers like a magnet but has been deflecting the advances of a successful, kind-hearted lawyer, Sam 2, who works in her company.  Sam's other friends, Mary-Catherine and Charlie, who live together, are afraid of taking their relationship one step further to the marriage altar.An evangelist once taught me that Christians should have an attitude of gratitude.  In other words, we should always be thankful for what we have been given.  When Annie once stepped into a cab, the Indian driver told her she had the potential to be very happy if she always said ""Thank you"" and followed it with ""More please.""  Charlie once told Mary-Catherine that LA was a blank canvas that reflects one's attitudes.  If you believe you're going to love LA, then you'll see it as the best city in the world.  From watching ""HappyThankYouMorePlease,"" I've learned that, in order to achieve success, love, happiness, and all the other good things in life, one must believe in oneself and have a positive attitude that one will obtain them.  This is a spiritual concept that is prevalent in most religions.""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" is a sweet, quirky, uplifting film that is fun to watch.  It will encourage the lovelorn not to lose hope in finding someone special and eventually having a family.  I believe that Sam's reluctance to surrender Rasheen to the authorities is the product of his subconscious desire to have a family.  He is pushing thirty and his biological clock (men also have them) is probably screaming for him to begin reproducing.  As soon as Sam finds the adorable surrogate ""son"", he finds the adorable surrogate ""wife"", Mississippi.  He barely knows her when he practically begs her to move into his apartment.  Mary-Catherine and Charlie are close to the altar but are having commitment issues.  Several surprises help spur them onward.  I think Annie is extremely attractive (I love her wardrobe); unfortunately, she doesn't.  She soon learns after dating the witty, sincere lawyer that true beauty comes from within.The soundtrack is excellent.  Much of the music, provided by singer/songwriter Jaymay, contains lyrics that complement the film's drama.  The DVD contains a short featurette that focuses on Jaymay.  Also, the DVD has deleted scenes that further explain what is transpiring in the film; they are essential viewing.  They include one disturbing scene in which Rasheen kicks and beats on a boy who purposely walked into him.  When Sam scolds him, Rasheen asks him if he's going to beat him.  This scene hints at the abuse the little boy must've suffered at the hands of his foster parents and why he doesn't want to return to them.  Without this scene, the film does not contain any violence.  Neither does the film contain graphic depictions of sex.  There is only the frequent use of the four-letter ""f"" word, which gives it an R rating.Anchor Bay Entertainment has provided an excellent presentation of ""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" on DVD.  As mentioned before, it has a featurette on Jaymay and deleted scenes; it also has a theatrical trailer and audio commentary provided by Producer/Writer/Director/Actor Josh Radnor (star of the hit television series ""How I Met Your Mother"") and Producer Jesse Hara.  The film is presented in its theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and has English and Spanish subtitles.  Thank you Anchor Bay for providing subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" is not a raunchy, hormonally driven sex comedy.  It is an emotionally uplifting, inspirational, teary-eyed romance that gives people like me, who've been single for a very long time, hope that there is someone out there for them.  Though it is not totally realistic, it does, however, provide excellent advice on having a positive attitude towards one's self image and self worth.  In order to be loved, one must first love oneself.  Remember Whitney Houston's hit song, ""Greatest Love of All.""  The greatest love of all is learning to love oneself.  How very true.  In conclusion, I must state that this film has made me very Happy.  To Josh Radnor, I must say, ""Thank You.""  Furthermore, I beseech him to please make more movies like this one.

1428320,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004UOH8XE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I think that it's become my mantra--""quirk is the curse of independent cinema."" In an effort to be cutesy and/or clever, films have been systematically stripping away genuine warmth and humor by presenting character types and sitcom contrivances instead of mining what is really funny in our everyday foibles. It becomes a fine balancing act, then, because a good quirky film can be both hysterical and touch your heartstrings. However, one that goes over the top can be painfully unreal and hard to sit through. And, in my opinion, there is very little middle ground. Josh Radnor's (How I Met Your Mother) debut feature ""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" cues you in right away with its title to its eccentric feel good nature. But after a pretty painful beginning and one incredibly off-putting storyline, Radnor's film overcomes its cliches with a likable cast selling even its most awkward moments.Radnor, who also wrote and directed the film, stars as a typical commitment-phobic man/child. A New York writer (who supports himself with absolutely no discernable source of income), Radnor engages in an appropriately zany new romance with a very appealing Kate Mara. In addition, he encounters a little boy on the subway that seems to have nowhere to go. While I won't divulge much here, what Radnor does with the boy is so outrageously improbable and illogical--it strains every notion of suspension of disbelief. As a central plot line, you have to give up all reason and just go with it. But it seriously almost completely derails the entire film. Much better are the other two story lines--co-workers Malin Akerman and Tony Hale beginning an unlikely romance and couple Zoe Kazan and Pablo Schreiber entering a new dimension of their life together.Aside from Radnor, the other main characters seem much more grounded and relatable. As their relationships evolve, there is a tender believability that can be quite engaging. And Mara, despite the script's uneven tone, brings real warmth to her role as a struggling cabaret singer and waitress. But the film still relies on some unnecessary quirks to make it utterly irresistible (but trust me, I resisted!). Radnor is apparently supposed to be so winning that everyone forgives his eccentricities and irresponsibility, but he doesn't come off very well. Akerman's character has alopecia (isn't it wacky that she's bald?), but far worse is the fact that she has a party to lecture all her friends about her condition. What--didn't they notice when she lost her hair? Seems the subject probably would have been dealt with on an individual basis, but it's so much more eccentric to have a party! Of course, the soundtrack is also littered with expected indie artists delivering heartfelt songs that parallel the plot--Radnor really followed the play book. Yet, the film still had a sweet tone and some nice moments. For lighthearted escapism, it works fine. About 3 1/2 stars, I'll round up for the extended cast and two of the three central stories.

I guess in my older age of 28 I'm becoming harder and harder to please with my cynical take on life.  However, in the tradition of being an objective reviewer I gave... the movie with the really cumbersome title the benefit of the doubt when given the opportunity to go over it.Having watched the film with my trusted test audience, my drinking buddies with a full compliment of PBR, we came to the following conclusion and I quote: ""Meh, It was OK.""The story isn't anything new as it follows the trials and tribulations of a handful of New Yorkers trying to figure things out (Rent, anyone?).  In the middle of it all is a writer taking in a foster child, something unique but not exactly heart warming.  In fact, we found that the film tried waaay too hard to be sentimental with all the mushy gushy moments that are not quite plot twists.  It's just too darned quirky to be believable, almost as if it was taking place in an animated world or something by Tim Burton as my test audience and I kept on shouting, ""Oh, whatever"" at the screen.  It just wasn't that believable.Pertaining to my earlier reference to the ""twists,"" simply put, there are none.  The story almost flows like a ""dear diary"" during the mundane parts of someone's life.  Yes, the hardships the character, who weren't really that well elaborated on, went through genuine hardships that plague the lives of anyone not living in a cave and/or their mom's basement but... it's mundane and overdone.  All their problems have been examined waay too much in other films or just aren't that interesting.  It'd be like me making a film about my normal day consisting of meetings and time on the sales floor: it would only be interesting if I included six months of quirky customer stories into a 30-minute episode on TV... *LIGHT BULB*Not to say the film with the odd title wasn't well done, everything else in production and post wasn't bad at all given it's an indie title with severe hotties.

The felt like real people, lots of flaws, but at the end of the day, still worth caring about.  :)  Its nice to see smaller movies where the characters are not total jerks for the sake of being jerks, and not completely obtuse or aloof.I really enjoyed Sam's story, and you could tell it wasn't going to end well, but it was fun to watch this guy who clearly had no direction, finally realize he had no direction and the journey he went on to get to that realization.  Surprisingly for me, I really liked Annie's story; it's surprising  because I haven't liked ANY characters that Malin Akerman playedthus far, she was just always really annoying, but in this movie, she was annoying, but in the right ways, if that makes sense?  It fit the character and wasn't over the top, I guess.  I definitely loved the end to her story as it actually reminds me of me and my husband, sometimes the people you ""think"" are the most attractive, really aren't, and sometimes, you just need to get a clearer perspective to see them for what they really are.  :)Since the only thing that gives this an R rating is the language, I was actually expecting it to have really bad language, but other than some F-bombs here and there, it wasn't that bad.  Obviously the language is more adult oriented, since all but one character is an adult, but its a lot cleaner than I thought it would be.  There were no actual sex scenes, all the sex was off screen, which was refreshing actually, as I don't watch movies for sex.If you are looking for a slightly off-beat movie that has a good message without being too sappy, I would get this one, love the message that to change your perspective, you have to change the way you think.Thank you, more please.  :DGod Bless ~Amy",4,A Sweet and Thoughtful Film.,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2014,"['had', 'zero', 'expectations', 'coming', 'one', 'was', 'Happy', 'find', 'actually', 'really', 'sweet', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'liked', 'characters', 'film', 'actually', 'really', 'cared', 'how', 'stories', 'would', 'unfold', 'definitely', 'refreshing', 'felt', 'real', 'people', 'lots', 'flaws', 'end', 'day', 'still', 'worth', 'caring', 'nice', 'see', 'smaller', 'movies', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'total', 'jerks', 'sake', 'being', 'jerks', 'not', 'completely', 'aloof.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Sam', 'story', 'could', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'end', 'well', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'guy', 'who', 'clearly', 'had', 'direction', 'finally', 'realize', 'had', 'direction', 'journey', 'went', 'get', 'realization', 'Surprisingly', 'really', 'liked', 'Annie', 'story', 'surprising', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'ANY', 'characters', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'playedthus', 'far', 'was', 'just', 'always', 'really', 'annoying', 'movie', 'was', 'annoying', 'right', 'ways', 'sense', 'fit', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'top', 'guess', 'definitely', 'loved', 'end', 'story', 'actually', 'husband', 'sometimes', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'most', 'attractive', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'get', 'clearer', 'perspective', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'R', 'rating', 'language', 'was', 'actually', 'expecting', 'have', 'really', 'bad', 'language', 'other', 'F-bombs', 'here', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Obviously', 'language', 'more', 'adult', 'oriented', 'one', 'character', 'adult', 'lot', 'cleaner', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'actual', 'sex', 'scenes', 'sex', 'was', 'off', 'screen', 'was', 'refreshing', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'sex.If', 'are', 'looking', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'being', 'too', 'sappy', 'would', 'get', 'one', 'love', 'message', 'change', 'perspective', 'have', 'change', 'way', 'think.Thank', 'more', 'please', 'DGod', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

I have friends who line up for those movies and tell me, ""I just want to see something where I can turn my brain off and eat some popcorn.""  Not my thing, but fair enough, I suppose.""Happythankyoumoreplease"" is the indie film version of that.  If you turn your brain off and want to watch a feel-good film, then this is what you're looking for.  Why turn your brain off?  Well, not a single character in this movie actually acts or reacts to their situations in a way remotely close to how a person would react in the real world.""Happythankyoumoreplease"" is about a group of happy and creative people living happy and creative lives in New York.  One of the happy and creative people, Sam, is a little less happy because he's having trouble breaking his writing career to the next level and has commitment issues.  Sam ends up caring for a boy separated from his family on the subway and learns lessons about being selfless (and also makes him seem like less of a jerk when you see how he treats women).  Another happy-creative person wants to move to L.A. to further his career, while his artist girlfriend wants to stay in New York (stereotypical L.A. bashing lifted from a Woody Allen film ensues).  The optimistic girl with alopecia who volunteers for non-profits keeps dating the ""wrong"" kind of guys because she can't get over her superficial standards (base irony: girl with a disease that affects people's physical appearance judges people for their looks).So, there you go.  The movie is a week in the life of those people.  I did have a few laughs during the film, and it's a mostly harmless little flick.  Most of the characters are mildly pretentious and don't give the viewer much to grab on to, as far as personality (a point made by the film itself in a scene when a publisher is criticizing the Sam's novel, but really making a meta-criticism of the movie). I wonder what other titles they were working on for the movie?  ""FirstWorldProblems""?  ""TrustFundArtistsSlightlyVexed""?  ""There'sNoWayThesePeopleCouldAffordTheseApartmentsInNYC""?Regardless, this is a harmless flick.

Still, another of Sam's friends (Zoe Kazan), because of her insecurities, tries to ""deep six"" her long term live-in relationship with her boy friend (Pablo Schreiber) when he announces he wants to move to Los Angeles and, also, marry her.Everything turns out just fine in HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE, a marvelous date movie.

I thought About a Boy was a real treat and the cast to this movie was great so if you put two and two together, this movie could have been great. But it really wasn't.The real problem is the three plotlines. This movie is a little over an hour and a half, so there really is a lot of time to deal with three separate romances. You just don't really get invested in the characters because you don't have any time to. By the time you really feel like you know who these people are, it's already time for the end.I would've cut the romance involving Zoe Katan and Pablo Schreiber. The characters get the least amount of screen time and their whole story is incredibly generic. Tony Hale and Malin Akermann were surprisingly charming and I would've liked to have seen their story get a little more attention.The main plot is a little far-fetched but that's kind of what you sign up for when you watch a movie. I did not have a problem with the plot, it's just poorly executed. There just isn't enough time.I like to see more out of Happythankyoumoreplease, but I can't really review what could've been.

Heath ""Gadgets, Music, & Books""","[3, 8]","HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE is a very paint by numbers movie that does little to add anything original to the movie landscape.  This movie borrows heavily from two movies that you wouldn't necessarily put together:  Big Daddy and Singles.  Sam Wexler (Josh Radnor) takes young Rasheen under his wing when he gets separated from his foster family on the subway in New York.  However the story lacks the Sandler brand of comedy to make this compelling.  What you get instead from Sam is someone fond of the one night stand who tries to get a little more serious with Mississippi (Kate Mara) who is a bartender/cabaret singer.  There are two other sets of couples in different stages of relationship crisis (the Singles angle), but it is difficult to find any sympathetic characters in this hodgepodge story.

You would have no idea why a Kramer entrance would be funny, nor would you care.That pretty much sums up ""Happy Thank You More Please"". It is a slice in the life of people you don't know and have no reason to care about.  The writer/producer (who also couldn't think of anyone good enough to play the part of himself so he cast himself as the lead character) offers absolutely zero character development.  There is an ensemble cast straight out of daytime soaps who do three things ... have sex with each other, argue with each other, make up with each other, all intertwined with another musical bridge from Jaymay.  Repeat. Then repeat again until the viewer is ready to scream.It is difficult to imagine a cast of less attractive people.  This was probably done intentionally so we could ""relate"" to them but it more often added to the viewer feeling of not caring about their petty little problems.The women are all shallow and delusional and easily seduced by anything that wears pants. The men are equally stereotyped as crass, cheating and dense.  They screw each other over (physically and emotionally) yet are drawn back to each other like musk ox in heat.Other than the aforementioned screw/argue/makeup rituals (with obligatory musical bridges from Jaymay) of several couples who kinda know each other there is almost nothing that happens in their lives.  So it really makes the viewer ask ""why make a movie about them?""  An important component of the movie to the writer/producer seems to be the mandatory inclusion of a poor cute kid who doesn't even know how old he is.  But his relationship with the primary character, like the rest of the movie, is shallow and vapid.Bottom line, this movie is about as clich&eacute;d as they get, full of self-pitying angst.  The person I watched it with falls into the age range of what this movie is supposed to be about.  Here's that person's take.

So it was a little hard to get too excited to hear that Josh Radnor, the actor who plays Ted wrote, directed, produced, and stared in a movie.  It also did not help it had an overly pretentious title: Happythankyoumoreplease.  My keyboard did not jam, there is actually no spaces in the name.  The title is (almost) explained in the movie, but still annoying for how it is presented.  If this were How I Met Your Mother, the other characters would be holding an intervention for Ted.The movie follows six New Yorkers, three of which are friends, as they struggle to find, or keep love.  It is filled with so many young middle class white people problems, it is hard not to think of that other sitcom actor turned writer.  Really it is anti-depressants, death, and a move of a couple miles south away from being Garden State.  Well that and the soundtrack is not nearly as cool.But the performances are solid.  As usually Radnor is the least interesting as a failing writer who inexplicably picks up a young black kid on the subway and decides to take care of him while trying to pursue Kate Mara (Urban Legend: Bloody Mary), a waitress and wannabe singer.  Malin Akerman (The Watchmen) is a woman who cannot grow hair who has terrible taste in men, and cannot tell when a good one is right in front of her, even Tony Hale (Buster Bluth!).  While Zoe Kazan (I Hate Valentine's Day) and Paolo Schreiber (Bubble Boy) are a couple at that point in their relationship where it is time to make an ultimate commitment or call it quite.

Well, that and the fact that this film also includes Kate Mara whom I happen to find irrestibly cute.  Anyway... hmmm, there was a question back to there somewhere... oh, yeah, why?  Why couldn't I make it through this film completely before breaking down and writing this review.  Really, this is the first time that I recall writing a review of film without watching it completely, though I suppose I could be wrong there as I may have written a review ofFred Claus, a film that I just couldn't stomach after the first 30 minutes or so... (I can't imagine it ever getting better, despite my hoping to find some good in it... I had to admit that every now and then critics seem to be right in panning certain films.)Anyway, I really do try to watch all of any movie that I'm going to review, and I will try to get back to watching the end of this film at some point.  I might really enjoy it, though I just don't know there.  Actually, one other time that I recall nearly giving up on a film that I later found myself enjoying was in sitting with my first wife and watching the filmAustralia  [Blu-ray].  In that particular case it was entertaining enough to keep me watching, but left me wondering just what the film was trying to be over the first third or perhaps half of it's running time.  That film did get better in the later portion and I found myself happy to have sat and watched it.In this particular case though... I just don't know.  If I find myself thinking differently, I'll come back and edit/update this review and/or add a comment here, but in the end I'm just so indifferent about this film that I can't find the inertia to get started watching the rest of it.I know full well there are plenty of people that will find this one to be one of the best films they've ever seen and I wouldn't tell them they are wrong, but I think my own experience with it offers a decent explanation as to why it seemed to fly by below everyone's RADAR.  It just doesn't rise to the level that makes it an unforgettably enjoyable experience, at least not for me, an average Joe (who could probably use some time at the gym in this very humorous film:Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (Unrated) [Blu-ray]).Really, if you are looking for a decent independent film that has flown below the RADAR but still merits watching, I'd offer up this alternative instead:Finder's Fee, a very surprising film from someone that is normally recognized as a reality TV host, rather than an accomplished writer/director.Another couple of interesting films that are worth a look:Specialor try:Be Kind Rewind.  Or even:The Visitor [Blu-ray].

This is the type of movie that I have talked about before, a movie that because of no CGI and small budget gets forgot about by the studios and does not get the advertising it deserves.  This is one of the best movies of the year, and will continue to be one of the least scene.  Very dissapointing considering more people have seen and will continue to see movies like ""Drive Angry"".  Taking away the fact that Radnor both wrote and directed this, Malin Akerman is a huge surprise in this one.  Much like Milla Jovovich in ""Stone"" she is the definate break out acting star in this one.  In a drastic change from her usual choice she far and away steals the movie and proves that she is a joy to watch even with her clothes on.  Besides Akerman, the acting all around is excellent, but the fact that the budget is under $100,000 and no comic book hero or a car that becomes a robot this will not be seen by the audience that it deserves.  This is the type of movie there needs to be more of, but because of greed the studios refuse to take a chance on interesting movies like this one in favor of the next comic book hero, or the next sequel that doesn't seem necessary.

1428347,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,B004UOH8XE,Tyson,"[5, 11]","You know how some really great movies are brilliant in every artistic aspect? The dialogue is crisp and witty, the acting is fluid and natural, the plot grows more and more interesting with every turn..  Well, Happythankyoumoreplease is the exact opposite.  Every scene is awkward, every spoken word is worth a cringe, the plot starts out sick and dies shortly after.  The only saving graces are Kate Mara (who is truly talented and actually manages to make the awful dialogue sound real), a mostly-silent 9-year-old, and original music by Jaymay.The story itself flops back and forth between three different New York City couples, all of which are struggling with relationships in some way or another.  At best, these intertwined stories are boring and clich&eacute;. At worst, utterly unwatchable.  The situations are never funny. They are never touching.  The film spends a good hour and a half building up what has got to be one of the most anticlimactic moments in cinematic history.My overall opinion is that if you're looking for a great indie comedy, look elsewhere.  A good indie should be unique and creative, it should take unexpected routes and deviant from clich&eacute;'s to provide commentary on society.  Here is a movie that tries to bring hope into the dating world that often seems hopeless, but it is done so flatly and without any true insight into relationships that you leave the movie feeling more hopeless than ever before.  If these are the kinds of real-world characters we should look forward to dating, I'm just going to stay single forever.",1,Not Good,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,1570,"['know', 'how', 'really', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'brilliant', 'artistic', 'aspect', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'witty', 'acting', 'fluid', 'natural', 'plot', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'turn..', 'Well', 'Happythankyoumoreplease', 'exact', 'opposite', 'scene', 'awkward', 'spoken', 'word', 'cringe', 'plot', 'out', 'sick', 'shortly', 'only', 'saving', 'graces', 'are', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'who', 'truly', 'talented', 'actually', 'make', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'real', 'mostly-silent', '9-year-old', 'original', 'music', 'Jaymay.The', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'three', 'different', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'couples', 'are', 'struggling', 'relationships', 'way', 'best', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'are', 'boring', 'clich', 'eacute', 'worst', 'utterly', 'unwatchable', 'situations', 'are', 'never', 'funny', 'are', 'never', 'touching', 'film', 'good', 'hour', 'half', 'building', 'up', 'what', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'anticlimactic', 'moments', 'cinematic', 'history.My', 'overall', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'indie', 'comedy', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'good', 'indie', 'should', 'be', 'unique', 'creative', 'should', 'take', 'unexpected', 'routes', 'deviant', 'clich', 'eacute', 'provide', 'commentary', 'society', 'Here', 'movie', 'bring', 'hope', 'dating', 'world', 'often', 'hopeless', 'done', 'so', 'flatly', 'true', 'insight', 'relationships', 'leave', 'movie', 'feeling', 'more', 'hopeless', 'ever', 'are', 'kinds', 'real-world', 'characters', 'should', 'look', 'forward', 'dating', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'stay', 'single', 'forever']",N/A

But also not, given its ""indie"" quality.  All that was missing was Zooey Deschanel. In fact there is a quote on the box comparing this to (500) Days of Summer, a film I didn't like that much.  It ended up being a good watch, mainly to the acting talents of Zoe Kazan.  While the other actors stood in their acting tracks, Zoe Kazan, playing a woman who is confused about moving to LA, gives an Oscar worthy crying scene that made me tear up.  Josh Radnor could learn something from her.  Her strong acting made me want to see her parts with Pablo Schreiber, over the parts manned by Josh Radnor and Kate Mara, which I think was supposed to be the main plot line.  That is, the main character finding the lost boy and trying to find love with a singer named Mississippi and helping his hairless friend.  I thought the hairless girl might be a deal breaker for me, due to its pathos, but that part was done well.  I liked that plot line too which leaded up to how the movie got its name.  I would recommend this film to others.  It's well written once you can get pass Josh Radnor's ""dude""s in the beginning (watch it and you will know).",4,"I didn't have high hopes for it, but it was a good watch...",1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,1258,"['Being', 'fan', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'also', 'how', 'boyfriend', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'also', 'not', 'given', 'indie', 'quality', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'fact', 'quote', 'box', 'comparing', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'good', 'watch', 'mainly', 'acting', 'talents', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'other', 'actors', 'stood', 'acting', 'tracks', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'confused', 'moving', 'LA', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'crying', 'scene', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'could', 'learn', 'something', 'strong', 'acting', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'parts', 'Pablo', 'Schreiber', 'parts', 'manned', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'plot', 'line', 'main', 'character', 'finding', 'lost', 'boy', 'trying', 'find', 'love', 'singer', 'named', 'Mississippi', 'helping', 'hairless', 'friend', 'thought', 'hairless', 'girl', 'might', 'be', 'deal', 'breaker', 'due', 'pathos', 'part', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'liked', 'plot', 'line', 'too', 'leaded', 'up', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'name', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'others', 'well', 'written', 'once', 'can', 'get', 'pass', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'dude', 's', 'beginning', 'watch', 'will', 'know']",N/A

One wonders why intelligent people don't think ahead- is this going to be trouble, much less illegal? It can be irritating to see this lack of focused actions on the part of screen writers and actors, instead of presenting solutions...but then again perhaps this is some peoples' realities.We do have a wonderful acting on the part of Malin Akerman who we ache for in her pattern of unsuccessful romance- her story could have been a whole movie.There are extras included of audio commentary with Josh Radnor and producer Jesse Hara. It does not have subtitles. There are English and Spanish subtitles for the movie itself. Extras include a short section on the music- which does add to the movie and is not intrusive unlike many other movies.
