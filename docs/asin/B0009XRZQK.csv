The film being advertised here as due to be released on DVD in August 2005 in the U.S. is a Korean film originally released overseas in 2003 under the title ""Salinui Chueok,"" its title in English being ""Memories of Murder."" It's an amazing, unique, intense, sometimes hilarious, always fiercely intelligent murder mystery from the powerful young Korean director Joon-ho Bong and features a 100% Korean cast speaking Korean (with English subtitles). Nancy Allen only wishes she'd been in this movie!A few hours ago I was in the grip of insomnia and was playing around with Comcast On Demand to see if there was anything worth seeing that I hadn't seen already when I noticed a section under Free Movies called ""Palm Pictures,"" a section I hadn't explored before. I clicked on ""Palm Pictures,"" then on ""Palm Festival,"" saw ""Memories of Murder"" listed, read the brief synopsis, and figured, what the heck, there's no better time to watch a Korean film than 2 a.m., so I went for it, figuring it wouldn't be a tragedy if I wound up dozing off ...Not a chance! I was wide-eyed with my mouth open from beginning to end. Never even made it to the fridge. Forgot all about eating, drinking, or even breathing at times, and sleep was definitely not an option. Once the end credits rolled, I was hurtling toward my computer with one question in my mind: ""Who is this astounding dude Joon-ho Bong, and where oh where can I buy a DVD of this movie?""Well ... turns out you can find inexpensive DVDs of Joon-ho Bong's ""Memories of Murder"" on eBay, but I think they're Region 0 imports, which isn't saying they're bad necessarily, but now that I've discovered that a Region 1 DVD is coming out in the U.S. a scant few weeks from now, I'm holding out for it. I only hope it has all of the special features (interviews with the director and the actors, special effects commentary, an alternate ending, some discussion of the actual murders in Korea upon which the film's story was based, etc.) I've seen mentioned on the Internet as being present on the European and Asian DVDs.What an eye-opener this film was for me! Superb acting. Gorgeous photography. Slightly improbable plot in parts, but I doubt you'll care; I sure didn't. ""Silence of the Lambs"" was improbable in parts as well but was still riveting. I found the Korean language in this film fascinating to listen to and wasn't bugged by the subtitles at all. In fact, half the time I forgot to read the subtitles because whatever I needed to know was all in the actors' faces and in the landscape ... and what faces! What a landscape!Oh, and Nancy Allen actually did appear in a mediocre 1990 made-for-TV movie called ""Memories of Murder,"" but it's not the same as Joon-ho Bong's blockbuster Korean hit ""Memories of Murder"" from 2003, so be careful when you order, and please see the terrific review (wish I'd written it!) of Joon-ho Bong's ""Memories of Murder"" at the IMDb website for more details.Whatever you do, don't miss this film!",5,"Joon-ho Bong's KOREAN film ""Memories of Murder"" (2003)",1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,3119,"['Heads', 'up', 'everyone', 'fact', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'listed', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'starring', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'film', 'being', 'advertised', 'here', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'August', '2005', 'U.S.', 'Korean', 'film', 'originally', 'released', 'overseas', '2003', 'title', 'Salinui', 'Chueok', 'title', 'English', 'being', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'amazing', 'unique', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'always', 'fiercely', 'intelligent', 'murder', 'mystery', 'powerful', 'young', 'Korean', 'director', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', '100', '%', 'Korean', 'cast', 'speaking', 'Korean', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'only', ""'d"", 'been', 'movie', 'few', 'hours', 'was', 'grip', 'insomnia', 'was', 'playing', 'around', 'Comcast', 'Demand', 'see', 'was', 'anything', 'worth', 'seeing', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'already', 'when', 'noticed', 'section', 'Free', 'Movies', 'called', 'Palm', 'Pictures', 'section', 'had', ""n't"", 'explored', 'clicked', 'Palm', 'Pictures', 'then', 'Palm', 'Festival', 'saw', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'listed', 'read', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'figured', 'what', 'heck', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'Korean', 'film', '2', 'a.m.', 'went', 'figuring', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'tragedy', 'wound', 'up', 'dozing', 'off', 'Not', 'chance', 'was', 'wide-eyed', 'mouth', 'open', 'beginning', 'end', 'Never', 'even', 'made', 'fridge', 'Forgot', 'eating', 'drinking', 'even', 'breathing', 'times', 'sleep', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'option', 'end', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'hurtling', 'computer', 'one', 'question', 'mind', 'Who', 'astounding', 'dude', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', 'where', 'oh', 'where', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Well', 'out', 'can', 'find', 'inexpensive', 'DVDs', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'eBay', 'think', ""'re"", 'Region', '0', 'imports', ""n't"", 'saying', ""'re"", 'bad', 'necessarily', 'now', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'coming', 'out', 'U.S.', 'scant', 'few', 'weeks', 'now', ""'m"", 'holding', 'out', 'only', 'hope', 'special', 'features', 'interviews', 'director', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'ending', 'discussion', 'actual', 'murders', 'Korea', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'mentioned', 'Internet', 'being', 'present', 'European', 'Asian', 'DVDs.What', 'eye-opener', 'film', 'was', 'Superb', 'acting', 'Gorgeous', 'photography', 'Slightly', 'improbable', 'plot', 'parts', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'care', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'was', 'improbable', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'still', 'riveting', 'found', 'Korean', 'language', 'film', 'fascinating', 'listen', 'was', ""n't"", 'bugged', 'subtitles', 'fact', 'time', 'forgot', 'read', 'subtitles', 'needed', 'know', 'was', 'actors', 'landscape', 'what', 'What', 'landscape', 'Oh', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'actually', 'did', 'appear', 'mediocre', '1990', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'called', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'not', 'same', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', 'blockbuster', 'Korean', 'hit', 'Memories', 'Murder', '2003', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'order', 'please', 'see', 'terrific', 'review', 'wish', ""'d"", 'written', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'IMDb', 'website', 'more', 'details.Whatever', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film']",Memories of Murder

I can safely say that this is one of the best movies I have seen this year.In October 1986 a woman is found murdered, the local detectives quickly descend on the case but are overwhelmed because of the lack of witnesses, evidence and any clues. Hampering their efforts is the shoddy and primitive police work. A city detective is sent from Seoul to assist them and inevitably they have friction over methodology. As the case drags on the detectives become psychologically and physically drained.  The best scenes in the movie are the discovery of the first body, the confrontation between the cops and the mentally retarded man child, the chase and the capture of the suspect who visits the scene of the crime, the murderer stalking the two women on the deserted street and choosing his victim, the climax where the lead detective almost kills the suspect, the very last scene of the movie and the expression on the detective's face.I absolutely loved the film 5 stars 7/10/10",5,Memories stay with you,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1134,"['Based', 'series', 'serial', 'killings', 'happened', 'South', 'Korea', 'Hwaseong', 'Gyeonggi', 'Province', '1986', '1991', 'been', 'directed', 'Bong', 'Joon', 'Ho', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year.In', 'October', '1986', 'woman', 'found', 'murdered', 'local', 'detectives', 'quickly', 'descend', 'case', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'lack', 'witnesses', 'evidence', 'clues', 'Hampering', 'efforts', 'shoddy', 'primitive', 'police', 'work', 'city', 'detective', 'sent', 'Seoul', 'assist', 'inevitably', 'have', 'friction', 'methodology', 'case', 'detectives', 'become', 'psychologically', 'physically', 'drained', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'discovery', 'first', 'body', 'confrontation', 'cops', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'man', 'child', 'chase', 'capture', 'suspect', 'who', 'scene', 'crime', 'murderer', 'stalking', 'two', 'women', 'deserted', 'street', 'choosing', 'victim', 'climax', 'where', 'lead', 'detective', 'almost', 'suspect', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'expression', 'detective', 'face.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film', '5', 'stars', '7/10/10']",Memories of Murder

These are not usually the diversity of emotions I've seen in most movies, and even rarer in crime dramas, but they reflect an extremely well-done movie by Joon-Ho Bong.At times, it's early pacing can feel slow, much slower than an average crime drama. Bong allows us into the world by taking a decent amount of time to familiarize us with the environment: a boring, quiet country beauty that he paints for us with his early slow shots. The soundtrack, a quiet but moving score, adds to an environment and a feel that is very real, very universal. But as soon as the action starts picking up, the movie ramps into a full-on thriller, as it becomes a race against time and feels very much like some of a few other crime drama/thrillers I've seen. At the same time, there is something intangible, something very (for lack of better words) sad that permeates through many parts of the movie. Dilapidated factories, protesters, corruption, senseless violence suggest a deeper meaning within the movie, a desperation and hopelessness of that time in Korea.But thankfully, Bong keeps this part of the movie simple. Although it is important to contextualize this film within a certain era of governmental corruption and crime in Korea, it certainly does not require an extensive knowledge of the period. I did not find it's overall sentiments propagandizing or overwhelming, quietly presented.I could go on about more specific parts of the plot, but it is a movie which I do not want to spoil.

This is a little different.  It is set in a rural town in South Korea.  It is not just about the murder of two women by Korea's first recorded serial killer, but also about the characterization of the detectives and the village people who were all affected by these brutal murders.  The tension never lets up and the actors are excellent specially Song Kang-ho who had to gain a lot of weight to give an accurate portrayal of a rural, gad-about detective.  Watch the DVD extras as well, because they are just as interesting.  The biggest let down for me is the conclusion, not to give away the ending but ""Where is my Hollywood Ending??""  where the good guys catch the bad guy and everyone lives happily ever after.  It took me a few minutes but this movie makes you realize that life is not a Hollywood mystery movie, that sometimes, there are things that you'll never know and that no matter how hard you try, you'll never come to fullfill the mission that you so desperately worked hard for.  The last scene of the movie is so telling and I thought it was the best part of the movie when years later, the detective is now a sales rep.  He's riding around in the company van and by the conversation he was having on the phone with his wife, he has settled into a quite everyday working guy with kids and golf on the weekends.  Suddenly he stops by a canal in a rice field and looks into an a dried irrigation ditch.  His face tells it all, this was the site of the first murder, then he hears a little schoolgirl  ""hey Mister what are you doing?""

But were you to view this back to back with his later ""Mother"" you'd see the difference in execution immediately.A particular South Korean town finds itself under the stress of having its first serial killer. The local detectives really aren't that good and have no experience with this level of crime. In comes a helping hand from the big city and they try to unravel the mystery. They work tirelessly but their efforts don't pay off.All the good things previous reviewers have said about this film are right on. It's a great story and it's well executed. I suppose the only down side in my book was the ending. This builds up, like most movies of this type, with the detectives finding the killer. When the last scene comes, and it ended, I thought I must have missed something. I was caught off guard and felt as though the movie had just stopped. I also think I need to see it again and watch it sub-titled as opposed to dubbed. The dubbing took away from the emotion of the actors so I didn't get quite the sense of weariness other reviewers spoke of.

Main character Park (Kang-ho Song) is a cross between Dirty Harry and Takeshi Kitano's characters, though on a much more vulgar level. His methods of investigation are appalling (and simultaneously funny). He gets his tips from a lover, consults a fortuneteller for information (and then tries to get her to name a suspect from a series of photos he shows her) and even stoops to the level of stealing a mentally retarded man's shoe in order to place a print at the crime scene. As the case becomes more baffling and gruesome, so does Park's desperation in solving the case by any means necessary, even if it means locking up an innocent man. His exasperation stems from the lack of technology and training available in Korea coupled with a provincial police department that simply does not have experience in solving serial murders. It's a case that has shocked the nation and the team is simply not equipped to handle it (though it doesn't help that they continually botch things up, from destroying and planting evidence to torturing detained suspects). Park looks to his movie heroes for inspiration but alas, it's not enough. The requisite cop from the big city, played by Sang-kyung Kim, comes to the rescue and to take part in a good cop/bad cop routine that turns increasingly grey. Park's not totally corrupt though: when DNA tests returned from America prove that a suspect is not the killer he is let go instead of being shot in the head.Director Joon-ho guides the scenes from macabre to humorous in a steady manner that isn't jarring or out of context. Indeed, it's this humor that adds a surprising layer of lightness to the entire production. Though police justice may be hard to come by in this hick town, comedic poetic justice does in fact exist. The cop whose signature movie is kicking suspects into confession has a leg amputated after a rusty nail is driven in by an angry victim. In one hilarious scene Park, convinced that the murderer is a hairless man, spends the day spying on Buddhist monks in a bathhouse. He will go to any lengths, other than actually using a logical methodology!The cinematography of the countryside is spectacular and unsettling: in this bucolic setting of golden fields and open skies there is a murderer loose and praying on unsuspecting women. Joon-ho cleverly creates a suffocating atmosphere: the tension and unease of the victims and the police are palpable. Coupled with an excellent cast and sharp dialogue, Joon-ho has fashioned a compelling, edgy film on the nature of justice when human fallibility and lack of scientific evidence are in great quantity.",4,`Memories of Murder' is a great Korean Murder Mystery,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,2699,"['was', 'well-made', 'mystery', 'based', 'series', 'murders', 'committed', 'Korea', '1986', 'Main', 'character', 'Park', 'Kang-ho', 'Song', 'cross', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'characters', 'though', 'much', 'more', 'vulgar', 'level', 'methods', 'investigation', 'are', 'appalling', 'simultaneously', 'funny', 'tips', 'lover', 'consults', 'fortuneteller', 'information', 'then', 'tries', 'get', 'name', 'suspect', 'series', 'photos', 'even', 'stoops', 'level', 'stealing', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'man', 'shoe', 'order', 'place', 'print', 'crime', 'scene', 'case', 'more', 'baffling', 'gruesome', 'so', 'Park', 'desperation', 'solving', 'case', 'means', 'necessary', 'even', 'locking', 'up', 'innocent', 'man', 'exasperation', 'lack', 'technology', 'training', 'available', 'Korea', 'coupled', 'provincial', 'police', 'department', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'experience', 'solving', 'serial', 'murders', 'case', 'shocked', 'nation', 'team', 'simply', 'not', 'equipped', 'handle', ""n't"", 'help', 'continually', 'botch', 'things', 'up', 'destroying', 'planting', 'evidence', 'torturing', 'detained', 'suspects', 'Park', 'movie', 'heroes', 'inspiration', 'alas', 'not', 'enough', 'requisite', 'cop', 'big', 'city', 'played', 'Sang-kyung', 'Kim', 'rescue', 'take', 'part', 'good', 'cop/bad', 'cop', 'routine', 'increasingly', 'grey', 'Park', 'not', 'totally', 'corrupt', 'when', 'DNA', 'tests', 'returned', 'America', 'prove', 'suspect', 'not', 'killer', 'let', 'go', 'instead', 'being', 'shot', 'head.Director', 'Joon-ho', 'scenes', 'macabre', 'humorous', 'steady', 'manner', ""n't"", 'jarring', 'context', 'Indeed', 'humor', 'surprising', 'layer', 'lightness', 'entire', 'production', 'police', 'justice', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'come', 'hick', 'town', 'comedic', 'poetic', 'justice', 'fact', 'exist', 'cop', 'signature', 'movie', 'kicking', 'suspects', 'confession', 'leg', 'amputated', 'rusty', 'nail', 'driven', 'angry', 'victim', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Park', 'convinced', 'murderer', 'hairless', 'man', 'day', 'spying', 'Buddhist', 'monks', 'bathhouse', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'other', 'actually', 'using', 'logical', 'methodology', 'cinematography', 'countryside', 'spectacular', 'unsettling', 'bucolic', 'setting', 'golden', 'fields', 'open', 'skies', 'murderer', 'loose', 'praying', 'unsuspecting', 'women', 'Joon-ho', 'cleverly', 'suffocating', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'unease', 'victims', 'police', 'are', 'palpable', 'Coupled', 'excellent', 'cast', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'Joon-ho', 'fashioned', 'compelling', 'edgy', 'film', 'nature', 'justice', 'when', 'human', 'fallibility', 'lack', 'scientific', 'evidence', 'are', 'great', 'quantity']",Memories of Murder

Memories of Murder is an interesting investigation story that displays a societal phenomenon of the rural area that is plagued of poor policing and a murderer.

The film focuses on three detectives and follows their investigation of South Korea's first recorded case of a serial killer. It is an unusual combination of death and laughter while horrible events are remembered. In a small town outside Seoul, over the course of six years, 10 women were raped and murdered in a mile radius. The murders were all women in a wide age range between 71 and 13. The killer grew bolder and more creative as the killings continued. The detectives could not find one single piece of evidence and their only tool seemed to be grilling those who knew the victim. They did not preserve the crime scene for forensic investigation so they looked like the keystone cops who use brutality to get forced confessions that would not hold up. Their search and interrogation was based on the detetives sense of duty and hope of a breakthrough.The story is about the detectives who faced the test of solving these horrific murders. They persisted even though they could not understand why such henious acts happened.

The murders occur in a country town and focus on the year 1986. Detective Park (the wonderful Kang Ho Song) and Detective Cho are assigned to the case, but the investigation is poor, and the detectives inexperienced in such serious crimes. Their idea of solving the case is by beating, torturing and coercing confessions out of any outcast that comes under their radar.Detective Seo from Seoul is brought onto the case to help with the investigation, but even after a few hopeful leads the case seems to go nowhere.Memories of Murder shows an interesting twist to the police procedural. The director and writer, Joon Ho Bong, brings something to the genre you don't often see: comedy. For those who are use to seeing Kang Ho Song as a composed and calculated man (such as he was in Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and JSA)will be surprised to find him more as a bumbling, obnoxious country bumpkin detective. He's particularly amusing though, especially when singing off key in a bar.There are other great touches in the film; like for example after the detectives finish interviewing a suspect about the murder they are shown casually pushing their stalled car down the road. And you won't see anyone do better drop kicks in cinema than the actors do in this film.I had a few problems with Memories. There was an unnecessary sex scene that seems out of place in the film, and the amputation of a detective's leg is mentioned, and then never brought up again. The movie also has a few cliches, but all of these problems were small as compared to the movie as a whole.Memories of Murder does not treat the true events lightly, as we see the detectives pour their hearts into finding the serial killer.

916358,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0009XRZQK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Memories of Murder (Joon-ho Bong, 2003)It has now been twenty-one years since the first known serial killer in Korea surfaced. The case remains unsolved to this day. Of course, that never stopped American directors from making serial killer movies (viz. the many movies about the zodiac killer, of which David Fincher's is only the latest), why should it stop the Koreans? Thus we have Joon-ho Bong's Memories of Murder.Based on the actual events, Memories of Murder covers the case, but is more interested in the police investigating it. The murders are taking place in a rural area, and the lead investigator, Doo-Man Park (The Host's Kang-ho Song), is getting nowhere. The government, frustrated, send in a suave Seoul detective, Tae-Yoon Seo (A Tale of Cinema's Sang-Kyeung Kim) to see if he can break the case. Park and Seo are immediately wary of one another, and their rivalry leads to the case getting nowhere, to the point where Park's commander threatens to crack both their heads. After they grudgingly decide to start working together, the two discover that, perhaps, they have a lot more in common than they first suspected.Bong (who achieved international fame a few years ago with The Host) obviously has some ideas on who the actual killer is, and he drops some tantalizing clues into the last hour of the movie; how much of what we see is based on the actual police reports and interviews, and how much Bong (who was also one of the screenwriters) slipped in of his own invention is unknown. Not that it probably mattered; the police are such lunkheads in this movie they probably wouldn't have caught the killer even if it turned out to be one of them. The actual investigation is secondary here, however, to the relationships between the characters; the power struggles, the alpha-male grandstanding, perhaps most interestingly Park's growing friendship with one of his first suspects. It all comes together in a surprisingly gripping tale, given how slowly it moves for most of its length. Bong and crew made a fantastic thriller here, one that's a must-see if you're a fan of serial-killer films.

The victims are all beautiful young women whose bodies have been found raped and strangled in local fields and ditches.  The initial agents who have been put on the case are two incompetent bunglers - one a dropout from college, the other a dropout from high school - who seem to have gleaned the majority of their investigative techniques from cheesy TV crime dramas.  Enter Seo Tae-yoon, a forensic investigator from Seoul, who wrests control from the locals and brings some big-city know-how to the case.Given the grim subject matter at hand, it's amazing just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be.  Blessed with a sly sardonic humor and a willingness to make fun of its characters even while evincing a great deal of affection for them, ""Memories of Murder"" plays less like a conventional cop movie and more like a regional comedy filled with rich insights into the subtle truths of human nature.  The relationship between Seo, the investigator from Seoul, and Park Doo-man, the more rational of the two local officers, is intriguing and complex, as we watch them bicker and brawl and engage in petty power struggles, while slowly coming to realize that each has something of value to teach the other if only they can set aside their egos long enough to listen.  Saddled with even-then antiquated technologies, Seo and Park are forced to rely on good old investigative footwork and informed intuition to try and solve the case.There are strong performances by one and all, and a fine sense of atmosphere in the setting.  Those looking for a neatly tied-up resolution to the case may find themselves disappointed at movie's end.

The oddly paired detectives at the center of the story hardly ever win each other's trust and provide enough conflict of their own. Meanwhile, the clues uncovered lead them in circles, falsely arresting one man and then another, and each false arrest generates greater hostility from the public which rightly questions their heavy-handed interrogation methods.With deliberate irony, women are portrayed in the film as underlings, one of them a capable policewoman reduced to serving tea for her colleagues. While one of the detectives has an ongoing affair with a woman, he is self-absorbed and there is no romance between them. The police chief deals with his wife dismissively, and the men's talk of women is often demeaning and insensitive.Based on a stage play, the film balances action sequences against scenes, often in a long take, in which characters debate their opinions and express their growing frustrations. The frame is often crowded with people and then dramatically empty as the camera looks across flat expanses of rice fields.

Don't expect an action-packed cop thriller: this story of the botched investigation into South Korea's first serial killer is much more of a character-driven drama. As the bodies mount up, the local cops are joined by a city cop, setting the scene for a clash between brute force - Kang-ho Song's local tortures suspects and plants evidence because that's the way things have always been done - and intellect - Sang-kyum Kim believes that documents never lie and relies more on tracing patterns. To a degree, the narrative betrays a similar tension, with chases and beatings alternating with throwaway scenes highlighting the sheer incompetence of the investigation (the local police haven't bothered to read the forensic reports and they even try to frame the only witness, while they're unable to prevent more killings because the manpower they need is diverted to suppressing pro-democracy rallies). But it's not that simple: no sooner has one approach been finally been comprehensively disproved than the other is found equally lacking, and as no progress is made the detectives turn on each other and then themselves.It takes a while hitting its stride, but when it does it delivers some powerful blows, and the look of hopeless impotence on Kang-ho Song's face that ends the picture is the most haunting image I've seen on film this year.",5,The human cost of tracking down a killer,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1409,"['Memories', 'Murder', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Korea', 'so', 'far', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'action-packed', 'cop', 'thriller', 'story', 'botched', 'investigation', 'South', 'Korea', 'first', 'serial', 'killer', 'much', 'more', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'bodies', 'mount', 'up', 'local', 'cops', 'are', 'joined', 'city', 'cop', 'setting', 'scene', 'clash', 'brute', 'force', 'Kang-ho', 'Song', 'local', 'tortures', 'suspects', 'plants', 'evidence', 'way', 'things', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'done', 'intellect', 'Sang-kyum', 'Kim', 'documents', 'never', 'lie', 'more', 'tracing', 'patterns', 'degree', 'narrative', 'similar', 'tension', 'chases', 'beatings', 'alternating', 'throwaway', 'scenes', 'highlighting', 'sheer', 'incompetence', 'investigation', 'local', 'police', 'have', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'read', 'forensic', 'reports', 'even', 'try', 'frame', 'only', 'witness', ""'re"", 'unable', 'prevent', 'more', 'killings', 'manpower', 'need', 'diverted', 'suppressing', 'pro-democracy', 'rallies', 'not', 'that', 'simple', 'sooner', 'one', 'approach', 'been', 'finally', 'been', 'comprehensively', 'disproved', 'other', 'found', 'equally', 'lacking', 'progress', 'made', 'detectives', 'turn', 'other', 'then', 'themselves.It', 'while', 'hitting', 'stride', 'when', 'powerful', 'blows', 'look', 'hopeless', 'impotence', 'Kang-ho', 'Song', 'face', 'picture', 'most', 'haunting', 'image', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'year']",Memories of Murder
916363,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0009XRZQK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 1]","""Memories of Murder"" (aka. Salinui Chueok, 2003) is a film based on real events that occurred in a small town in South Korea between 1986 to 1991. The film is about South Korea's first serial killer, when advancements in forensics and DNA evidence hasn't been perfected yet. Director Bong Joon-Ho brings us a dramatic police thriller that portrays the investigation of these brutal rape and murders when all cops could rely upon are their instincts, intuition, street savvy and intimidation. I have seen two very effective and riveting, fact-based South Korean thrillers; ""The Chaser"" and this film; I wonder how come it took me this long to review this film; ""Memories of Murder""?  I feel a little sorry.In 1986, rural police detectives faced its first case of serial murders when two beautiful women were discovered brutally raped and killed; in very similar method and style. Detective Park Doo-man (Song Kang-Ho, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) is the man assigned to the case and with his very aggressive partner, Det. Cho-Yung Keo (Rohah Kim) they fail to produce results and doesn't even come close to nailing the killer. However, when a Seoul cop named Seo Tae Yung (Sang Kyung Kim) volunteers to solve the case, things begin to move for the better. Seo's meticulous approach to investigation begins to unearth vital evidence and credible clues as to the identity of the murderer. Unfortunately, poor forensic methodology and the unavailable advance technology threatens to disastrously hamper the case...Director Bong Joon-Ho approaches the serial killer genre with a very different method. He doesn't rely on shocking images and violent sequences to engage the viewer into the film. Instead, he relies on the details of the actual story, the situation during that time, and the characters that make up most of the film. A wise approach since this case was well-known in Korea during that time, and it has been dubbed by some as their own version of ""Jack the ripper"" since the murderer was never caught up to this day. This film provoked a very strong reaction from the general public and authorities have been pressured to re-open the case, but unfortunately there just wasn't enough evidence and the case was closed more than a decade ago.Which brings us to the question--since most people know that the killer was never caught, then why make this film because we would know how it would end? Well, not everyone knew the details of the case and the obstacles and issues that hampered the investigation, the cops did have a difficult time putting all the pieces together. During this time, cops went on instinct and very few had the necessary skills and resources to conduct a proper investigation, much less country cops who rely mostly on intimidation and intuition. These cops tend to pick up the wrong suspects and tortures a confession out of them. Some work out, but most doesn't, citizens were angered at this police procedure and the cops' ineptitude. These facts are represented by two country cops, Detectives Do-Man Park and Cho-Yung Keo. You will witness the frustration, the stress they go through, as fleshed out by our characters which generates genuine tension without the aid of eye candy special effects.While most of the violence is toned down and most of it are hinted at when the bodies are studied, the film does have its share of graphic images. The sequences of the victims bodies, tied down and obviously brutalized looked very realistic. The viewer is witness to the film's autopsies and I thought they were enough to serve up the necessary visceral punch. I thought the director did a wise move in steering away from the actual violence, while the scenes of its aftermath and discussions leave much to the imagination. Those expecting a heavy dose of blood and gore may be a little disappointed but the movie is enthralling enough without grand displays of violence. Being based on a true story, its was clever to keep the violence to a minimum and avoid the over-the-top blood and gore to keep it realistic.Amid all the investigations, the film does manage to serve up its share of black humor. Song Kang-Ho's character, Park Do-Man may seem lazy, arrogant but he maintains that warm charisma that makes him likable. Detective Park had his share of wise ideas as to the identities of the murderer and his over-the-top approach left me snickering. Sang Kyung Kim's character is also quite well-rounded. His Seoul cop character had that look of finesse and smarts, unfortunately he also experiences his share of frustrations. The screenplay was well-rounded as it maintained a sense of humanity with its serious tone but it never forgot to inject some scenes of black humor.The film does have a very effective plot twist and asks the viewer exactly what he thought. Director Bong Joon-Ho cleverly practices a sense of restraint in the film and it maintained a touch of simplicity. The cinematography and editing is simple but very effective, the costumes and set designs exemplified this period in the 80's (with the use of typewriters and old cars) that resulted in a well-shot, artistically engaging film. The filmmakers did a commendable job in bringing this harrowing part of Korean history to the big screen with its excellent characterization and emotive script, the film is a can't miss!Highly Recommended!
