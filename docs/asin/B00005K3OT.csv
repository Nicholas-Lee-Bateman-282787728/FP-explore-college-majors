You feel Molina's pain with a wife that has left him, but still trying to keep it together with a tough exterior that turns the town against him.

I laughed, I cried, and I cringed a little bit.The premise is as human as it can be - how do people go about integrating someone different into their midst? Not so well, as it turns out. Juliet Binoche who plays the complex Vivanne is beyond stellar in her performance. Judi Dench - well, she's Judi Dench! Fabulous. Alfred Molina does a fantastic job at playing the highly unlikeable Comte and Mayor of the village, eventually showing his vulnerable side, and then finally giving in to it, becoming very likeable in the end. Lena Olin (playing Josephine) undergoes a similarly dramatic transformation under the loving acceptance (and chocolate) of Vivianne. Vivanne herself reveals more of her shadow self as the story unfolds, thus keeping her character interesting.Of course I had heard about the uncannily steamy romance between Roux (Johnny Depp) and Vivianne (Juliette Binoche) and was anxiously awaiting this delicious morsel. Ah - however... Johnny Depp's character lacked the interesting intricacies of the other roles. But more importantly, his acting was tepid and his assumed accent was an abomination. It vacillated from Spanish-esque, French-esque, to Irish brogue, and sort of settled in the Irish range for the duration of the movie. Really? No language coaches? As the male romantic lead, he paled against Juliette Binoche.Nonetheless, overall an entertaining and darling movie.

660721,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00005K3OT,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","Lasse Hallstrom's ""Chocolat"" is a richly delicious movie. Set in post-WWII France, Juliette Binoche is luminous as Vianne,a gipsy who works magic with her chocolate. Alfred Molina stars as the melancholy, repressed Comte who initiates a crusade against her in the name of morality. With Rachel Portman's sensuous soundtrack,""Chocolat"" is a delicious treat.In ""Chocolat"",Vianne befriends the abused Josephine (Lena Olin) as well as the suffering Countess (Judi Dench),who's estranged from her uptight daughter Caroline (Carrie-Ann Moss). Vianne defiantly opens her chocolaterie during Lent. One can argue the premise is offensive-what if Vianne opened a hamburger shop in India,or sold pork in a Muslim country? Isn't Vianne being insensitive,or just adolescent? Vianne's chocolate shop ends up being a refuge and place of healing. Her chocolate is an aphrodisiac, spicing up a passionless marriage and jumpstarting a romance between an old widow (Leslie Caron) and a man who's pined for her since WWI. Johnny Depp leads the river pirates to the small French town. His name is Roux--so he's named for the butter-flour mixture that thickens soups. The plot thickens. In the meantime, the Comte is bullying the young priest. Doesn't he have anything better to do? To his credit, the Comte tries to reform Josephine's abusive husband Serge. As for the Countess, she is secretly suffering from diabetes and desires Death by Chocolate.Vianne decides to have a Chocolate Festival to counter Easter. After kneeling before a crucifix, the Comte finds Vianne's chocolate goddess on an altar surrounded by Mayan and Aztec images. He succumbs to the temptation of the chocolate, and everyone gets a Happily Ever After.""Chocolat"" works as a light-hearted fable. It's sensuous and magical. It's delightful,fast-paced,and the ensemble cast is first-rate. One may disagree with the unrepentant,ungrateful Vianne,who doesn't thank the Divine for her healing gifts,or the fact that she doesn't know who her child's father is. Still, Vianne is compassionate and charitable. Even the villainous Comte has nuance,a man depressed from his wife's death. ""Chocolat"" is delicious.

660724,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005K3OT,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","If ever there was a movie that was a delicious as its subject then `Chocolat' is that movie.  Making a movie about chocolate, the one guilty pleasure that transcends age, gender and race, is an idea in itself, but making that film creamy, sweet and pure is something all its own.  `Chocolat' tastes so incredibly sweet on the viewers palate, a film that coats our eyes with its rich goodness and makes us crave even more of what this beautiful film has to offer.Okay, enough with the obvious chocolate innuendoes.All kidding aside, `Chocolat' is a wonderful film, one that I never expected to like as much as I did.  My wife had seen the first part of this film some time ago and reported that it was horrible and thus she turned it off.  I must admit that the advertisements and posters for the film failed to draw me in (although after seeing the film and casting glance at the poster I can't see how Binoche's smile didn't draw me in at first glance) and so I accepted her complaint and tossed aside all aspirations of seeing the film even though my wife has significantly lower taste in film than I do and I generally reject any and all of her opinions on movies.  Now the other night, late at night I must add, this little film came on the food channel and I decided to watch it.  I only caught the first half hour before sleep overcame me but that first half hour was, in a word, spellbinding.  I insisted that my wife give it another try and so we rented to film the following day, and while she is not as intoxicated with this film as I am she readily admits that her initial response to this movie was wrong.The film centers around Vianne Rocher, a mysterious woman who moves to a reserved and very religious French town with her young daughter Anouk.  The town, about to observe Lent, immediately turn their backs to Vianne as she opens her chocolatier and tempts the townsfolk with all that they have vowed to abstain from.  No one opposes her more than the uptight mayor Comte Paul de Reynaud who comes to despise Vianne and everything she stands for.  He watches his power over the town slip from his grasp as they all begin consulting Vianne and falling prey so-to-speak to her chocolaty deliciousness.  Yes, Vianne is just as delectable as the chocolates she makes.  Her smile alone is intoxicating.The film is lovely to look for the cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is brilliant as well, from Binoche's devilishly sweet performance to Judi Dench's crotchety Armande Voizin to Alfred Molina's malicious Comte and Lena Olin's mysteriously beautiful Josephine.  Everyone involved here delves into their characters and delivers beautifully.  Johnny Depp has a very small role although it may seem from advertisements that his role would be larger.  He's effective but no where near as memorable as the remaining cast.  Carrie-Anne Moss delivers a nice little performance here as Armande's cold hearted daughter and young Victoire Thivisol manages to make Anouk a real girl, immature and foolish yet with a sense of maturity that would accompany her situation.I don't know if this would be constituted a spoiler, but I wanted to talk a bit about Pantoufle since I feel he is really the moral center of the film.  When the film opens we are introduced to Pantoufle, Anouk's imaginary friend kangaroo.  He is wounded and cannot leave her side.  At the end of the film Pantoufle is healed and bounces away from the town, and Anouk is happy for this.  Throughout the film mention is made of the fact Vianne moves around a lot and she even mentions herself that while she tells herself it's good for Anouk she knows in her heart that Anouk hates it.  To me Pantoufle was a metaphor for this very fact.  Anouk longed to stay put, thus the fact that Pantoufle could not leave her side.  He was wounded and thus could not travel.  She wished that she too could not travel but could experience some stability.  When she finally receives that stability at the films end she has no use for Pantoufle anymore for she has what she wants and so her subconscious sets him free.So, in the end I must say that I LOVED this movie, truly adored it.  It made me smile and rarely do films do that.  Maybe that's because I often seek out the film that depresses and saddens me because I enjoy the emotional connection to cinema, but it's nice to watch something that brings a smile and sense of joy to the soul, and `Chocolat' does just that.",5,Delicious and chocolaty sweet; a film that satisfies down to our creamy center...,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,4439,"['ever', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'delicious', 'subject', 'then', 'Chocolat', 'movie', 'Making', 'movie', 'chocolate', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'age', 'gender', 'race', 'idea', 'making', 'film', 'creamy', 'sweet', 'pure', 'something', 'own', 'Chocolat', 'tastes', 'so', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'viewers', 'palate', 'film', 'eyes', 'rich', 'goodness', 'crave', 'even', 'more', 'what', 'beautiful', 'film', 'offer.Okay', 'enough', 'obvious', 'chocolate', 'innuendoes.All', 'kidding', 'aside', 'Chocolat', 'wonderful', 'film', 'one', 'never', 'expected', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'My', 'wife', 'had', 'seen', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'time', 'ago', 'reported', 'was', 'horrible', 'thus', 'turned', 'off', 'must', 'admit', 'advertisements', 'posters', 'film', 'failed', 'draw', 'seeing', 'film', 'casting', 'glance', 'poster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'Binoche', 'smile', 'did', ""n't"", 'draw', 'first', 'glance', 'so', 'accepted', 'complaint', 'tossed', 'aside', 'aspirations', 'seeing', 'film', 'even', 'wife', 'significantly', 'lower', 'taste', 'film', 'do', 'generally', 'reject', 'opinions', 'movies', 'Now', 'other', 'night', 'late', 'night', 'must', 'add', 'little', 'film', 'came', 'food', 'channel', 'decided', 'watch', 'only', 'caught', 'first', 'hour', 'sleep', 'overcame', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'word', 'spellbinding', 'insisted', 'wife', 'give', 'try', 'so', 'rented', 'film', 'following', 'day', 'not', 'intoxicated', 'film', 'am', 'readily', 'initial', 'response', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Vianne', 'Rocher', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'reserved', 'very', 'religious', 'French', 'town', 'young', 'daughter', 'Anouk', 'town', 'observe', 'Lent', 'immediately', 'turn', 'backs', 'Vianne', 'chocolatier', 'townsfolk', 'have', 'vowed', 'abstain', 'one', 'more', 'uptight', 'mayor', 'Comte', 'Paul', 'de', 'Reynaud', 'who', 'despise', 'Vianne', 'everything', 'power', 'town', 'slip', 'grasp', 'begin', 'consulting', 'Vianne', 'falling', 'prey', 'so-to-speak', 'chocolaty', 'deliciousness', 'Yes', 'Vianne', 'just', 'as', 'delectable', 'chocolates', 'smile', 'alone', 'intoxicating.The', 'film', 'lovely', 'look', 'cinematography', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'well', 'Binoche', 'devilishly', 'sweet', 'performance', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'crotchety', 'Armande', 'Voizin', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'malicious', 'Comte', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'mysteriously', 'beautiful', 'Josephine', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'here', 'characters', 'delivers', 'beautifully', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'may', 'seem', 'advertisements', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'larger', 'effective', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'memorable', 'remaining', 'cast', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'nice', 'little', 'performance', 'here', 'Armande', 'cold', 'hearted', 'daughter', 'young', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'make', 'Anouk', 'real', 'girl', 'immature', 'foolish', 'yet', 'sense', 'maturity', 'would', 'accompany', 'situation.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'constituted', 'spoiler', 'wanted', 'talk', 'bit', 'Pantoufle', 'feel', 'really', 'moral', 'center', 'film', 'When', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'Pantoufle', 'Anouk', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'kangaroo', 'wounded', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'side', 'end', 'film', 'Pantoufle', 'healed', 'bounces', 'away', 'town', 'Anouk', 'happy', 'film', 'mention', 'made', 'fact', 'Vianne', 'around', 'lot', 'even', 'mentions', 'good', 'Anouk', 'heart', 'Anouk', 'Pantoufle', 'was', 'metaphor', 'very', 'fact', 'Anouk', 'longed', 'stay', 'put', 'thus', 'fact', 'Pantoufle', 'could', 'not', 'leave', 'side', 'was', 'wounded', 'thus', 'could', 'not', 'travel', 'wished', 'too', 'could', 'not', 'travel', 'could', 'experience', 'stability', 'When', 'finally', 'stability', 'films', 'end', 'use', 'Pantoufle', 'anymore', 'what', 'so', 'subconscious', 'sets', 'free.So', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'truly', 'adored', 'made', 'smile', 'rarely', 'do', 'films', 'do', 'Maybe', 'often', 'seek', 'out', 'film', 'enjoy', 'emotional', 'connection', 'cinema', 'nice', 'watch', 'something', 'smile', 'sense', 'joy', 'soul', 'Chocolat', 'just']",N/A

I don't have the problem that others who have reviewed here have with the pretentious/smug way in which the lead character sets out to fix other people's lives.  Everyone can relate to the idea of a non-conformist feeling alienated.  I have a small issue with the way the film recycles plots of other films without credit (Chocolat = Mary Poppins + Pleasantville + Like Water For Chocolate).  The big problem I have with the film is...The entire concept of the film!Chocolat is a liberal fantasy film that perpetuates the myth that no one in the world had any fun until the liberals showed up.  Conservatives are depicted as evil or stupid or innocently mislead (because they didn't know better).  It never occurs to anyone having anything to do with the movie that people might want to embrace the Catholic faith as written *because they want to*.  The only morality embraced in the film is, ""If it feels good, do it.""  That is certainly a point of view, while it might be a particularly childish one, but to state that anyone who doesn't agree with that view and live his life by it is a hate-filled, wife-beating, sociopathic arsonist waiting to happen is skipping a few logical steps, to put it mildly.The blatant anti-Catholicism of the film is astonishing and reaches a pitch that is sickening.  This is one of the only permissible prejudices allowed in today's PC society.  Just try to imagine this movie if it were done any of the following ways:-- Lead character sets up a chocolate shop in a community of fasting Buddhist monks, and berates them for not giving in to human temptation.-- Lead character sets up a Peter Luger's steakhouse in a community of vegans.  Mmm, if you don't want this juicy porterhouse, you must be irrationally repressed, aren't you?-- Lead character sets up a McDonald's and a Starbucks in an African village, and the anti-globalization folks ""write the sermons"" denouncing the temptation and disruption to the villagers' way of life that should be respected and preserved.None of those movies could ever have been made.  But in this movie, the climax of the film (that is supposed to be joyous to us) is a pagan festival celebrated on Easter Sunday.  It never occurs to the makers of the film that Easter Sunday might be something worth celebrating on its own merits--or that a Catholic is as worthy of respect as anyone else.The film sets up a strawman--Catholics/conservatives are bad, repressed people waiting to be saved from their own ignorance, and one shouldn't be a bad, repressed person--and then knocks it down.  Hooray for it.  Anyone who is in favor of being bad and repressed should certainly sit up and take notice....

The plot is intricate and intriguing, carrying the viewer through the emotional transformations of each of the main characters.  In a sleepy medieval French town where life has assumed a repressive structure that has created an emotionally frozen and empty life for even the most highly placed members of its society, the heroine Vianne and her daughter arrive to set up a chocolate shop.  With her wonderfully concocted sweets she manages to liberate some of the denizens of the town, revealing their potential for greater happiness.  The story has a sense of myth, fantasy, and fairytale about it that leaves the viewer with a feeling of personal satisfaction.This is a film full of strong female performers.  Judi Dench is especially wonderful as a curmudgeonly elderly woman estranged from her daughter and forbidden to see her grandson.  Juliette Binoche does a fine job as the heroine.  She is as fragile and seductive as Monroe in some scenes and as forceful and independent as Bacall in others.  Lena Olin is wonderful as the abused wife who rises from the confusion and ashes of her own ruined personality like a phoenix under the influence of the heroine.This is one of the best movies I've seen in a ling while, and I expect to order and read the book upon which it was based--something I rarely do.",5,A great emotional lift.,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,1463,"['Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'film', 'version', 'Joanne', 'Harris', 'novel', 'Chocolat', 'as', 'delightful', 'confection', 'were', 'heroines', 'chocolate', 'creations', 'plot', 'intricate', 'intriguing', 'carrying', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'transformations', 'main', 'characters', 'sleepy', 'medieval', 'French', 'town', 'where', 'life', 'assumed', 'repressive', 'structure', 'created', 'emotionally', 'frozen', 'empty', 'life', 'even', 'most', 'highly', 'placed', 'members', 'society', 'heroine', 'Vianne', 'daughter', 'arrive', 'set', 'up', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'wonderfully', 'concocted', 'sweets', 'liberate', 'denizens', 'town', 'revealing', 'potential', 'greater', 'happiness', 'story', 'sense', 'myth', 'fantasy', 'fairytale', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'personal', 'satisfaction.This', 'film', 'full', 'strong', 'female', 'performers', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'curmudgeonly', 'elderly', 'woman', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'forbidden', 'see', 'grandson', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'fine', 'job', 'heroine', 'fragile', 'seductive', 'Monroe', 'scenes', 'forceful', 'independent', 'Bacall', 'others', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'wonderful', 'abused', 'wife', 'who', 'confusion', 'ashes', 'own', 'ruined', 'personality', 'phoenix', 'influence', 'heroine.This', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ling', 'expect', 'order', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'something', 'rarely', 'do']",N/A

There was too much pretentiousness about Chocolat, and even more so in the acting by the cast. I've never been much of a fan of Juliette Binoche, and I still fail to see what makes her the actress sought for. So, watching her during the viewing of Chocolat confirmed my beliefs once again. Binoche doesn't know how to be effective, and she can't lead a movie. Judi Dench is another bad actress, further ruining the film. All she does is overact melodramatically and put on too much airiness. Enter Johnny Depp in the middle of Chocolat. He turns in a bland one-dimensional performance, and I couldn't care less if he didn't appear in the movie at all. Johnny Depp was brilliant in other Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m's picture titled What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but this time, the cast failed him. I think the only saving grace of the film was Alfred Molina, but watching him doing the character work gets tiresome after a while. Carrie-Anne Moss serves a paradigm of a mediocre actress churned out the last fifteen years and still failed to understand the craft. Now, to the story of Chocolat, I have to say that I was uh....unimpressed. A mother, along with her daughter, enters a religion-based village, makes chocolates, and changes the village through chocolate-making. Wow...do I feel like an idiot. The length of the picture left me tired and bored, yearning for the end at the hour mark. It's possible that having too much chocolate can leave a person sick, and having too much of Chocolat left me sick for sleep. Simply put, the acting killed the movie, the story dulled me, and the lack of a moral left me searching for clues to the question of why was Chocolat produced in the first place.

Although I have not read the novel, the movie is delightfully rich and creamy.Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is a &quot;chocolatier extraordinaire,&quot; having the best chocolate in all of France and possibly the entire world.  She and daughter, Anouk, set up shop in a small French village rife with religious zealots led by the mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), who is intent on keeping the town chocolate-less.  It is the timeless game of religious piety versus sincere brotherly love as portrayed in the lead characters.Vianne seeks to sweeten the lives of the villagers in town with her secret panacea, especially the religious rejects like Armande Voizin (Judi Dench).  She is a crusty old woman, the antipathy of her daughter, forbidden to see her own grandson living in town.  Moreover, there is an abused wife (Lena Olin), who finds refuge from her husband, not in the church, but in the chocolate shop.  And finally, if this is not enough to drive a group of religious fundamentalists insane, there is Roux (Johnny Depp), a member of the River Rats, a nomadic tribe of gypsies, who develops an interest in Vianne.  What will become of this little village?

In this case the setting is a small French town with a prudish mayor (a real live Count, no less) whose grip on his people is slowly pried away by the arrival of a mysterious lady in red (one of many, many cliches employed here) who makes chocolate with a little something extra that frees its imbibers from their inhibitions.Although the filmmakers are sure to show that no one goes too far into sin for any reasonable person, this is apparently not the case for the prideful and repressed mayor, his puppet of a young priest, and their parishioners, but by film's end even the mayor is partaking of her confections and providing a noticeable presence at an apparently pagan ceremony held next door to the church.It could only be more trite if they'd sing ""Koom-By-Yah.""  Fortunately the film is very pretty to look at and there are a few moments with some dramatic tension, notably involving a big dumb lug who beats his wife and her escape from his clutches but, even in moments when a character (usually the mayor) has a momentous decision to make, the character almost always goes exactly the direction we would expect.  Johnny Depp, second only to Denzel Washington on my list of favorite actors, is completely wasted here; his role has possibilities but the script takes this character absolutely nowhere and could have been played just as well by anyone with a SAG card.Such a shame.

I've read that more and more movies are being shot in the English language simply because the potential box office profit is so much huger. Put simply, this is a delightful film which many critics are probably grading downwards because it is &quot;just&quot; a simple story that is simply (but beautifully) told.  I am hardly ready to number myself among them!  Lasse Hallestrom, who first distinguished himself with the marvelous &quot;My Life As A Dog,&quot; knows his way around a film script and with actors and it shows.  Playing much like a fable or fairy tale, Juliette Binoche is a woman, Vianne, who wanders from place to place with her daughter, Anouk, setting up shop as a chocolatier. This time she sets up shop in a peaceful French village in the winter of 1959. Delightful as the love story portion is with the river rat, Gypsy-like Johnny Depp, it is the hilarious war waged on Binoche by the town's mayor, played by Alfred Molina, who will reduce you to complete gut-busting laughter. His wife left him and his inability to deal with that fact fuels a lot of his animosity towards Vianne and the general air of sensual repression he wishes to foster in the village.

Just before Lent she opens a chocolatier that will turn the town upside down.-----------------------Vianne Rocher: And these are for your husband. Unrefined cacao nips from Guatemala, to awaken the passions.Yvette Marceau: Psshh. You've obviously never met my husband.Vianne Rocher: Well, you've obviously never tried these.===============================Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) sees her as a threat to the morals and tranquility the people of Flavigny-sur-Ozerain treasure. He starts a crusade against her, and against a group of vagabonds headed by Roux (Johnny Depp) who arrive by boat. When Vianne Rocher befriends them, a line is drawn in the sand:-----------------Comte de Reynaud: Let me try to put this into perspective for you. The first Comte de Reynaud expelled all the radical Huguenots in this village. You and your truffles present a far lesser challenge.=============================But to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, ""I can resist everything, except chocolat.""I like everything about this film, and everyone in it is chock full o' talent. Somehow, though, the whole was equal to less than the sum of its parts. And less was not more, less was less. Was it too many cooks spoil la mousse au chocolat? This was an attempt to create a fable, and that is a very delicate thing. Like a chocolat souffl&eacute;, someone slams a door and the whole thing collapses. Maybe it was just me. Your mileage may vary.Speaking of fables, Edward Scissorhands, for me, now, there was a fable. Johnny Depp was fabulous in it. Sometimes you can't create a fable, you just have to use your divining rod and find one. Sometimes the magic just doesn't work, especially when you set out to create a fable. Chocolat is magic, but too much chocolat is just an overdose.Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m made this after The Cider House Rules, and as they were filming, they learned that they had 7 Oscar nominations, and would win for Michael Caine, best supporting actor, and the script by John Irving. Chocolat would also garner five nominations, but no wins. Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m is married to Lena Olin, who plays Josephine in Chocolat.I don't fault him for that, or think it adversely affected the film, I just mention it because you can tell that everyone is having a great time making the film, Chocolat. They are literally making chocolat, and eating chocolat, too. It is a family affair, with old friends reuniting, and new friendships being forged.Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin both appeared together in The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where they were two corners of a love triangle with Daniel Day-Lewis. Olin played Sabina, the one who wore her grandfather's derby while making love.Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m had worked with Johnny Depp before, when he directed him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? In Chocolat, Johnny finally gets to play guitar, and we hear him do some blues and Django Reinhardt's Minor Swing. It is a real treat to hear Depp play Le Jazz Hot, and he is not half bad. He has some great vintage guitars and a Dobro.Peter Stormare is great as Josephine's husband, a wife beater. He is not quite a scary as he was in Fargo, but he is scary enough, and also a little sad. Alfred Molina is kind of an uptight wet blanket, but you can see that he is just an insufferable self righteous buzz kill because he is sad. Nothing that a little, or a lot, of chocolat won't cure.---------------------------Vianne Rocher: [to the Comte de Reynaud] Ah, good morning. Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?==============================================Judi Dench is fabulous, as usual, and so is Leslie Caron, though her part is so small I didn't even notice her. The director apologized that her part was so small. She was in Gershwin's An American in Paris with Gene Kelly, directed by Vincente Minnelli. She starred in Lerner and Loewe's Gigi with Maurice Chevalier, also directed by Liza's dad and Judy Garland's husband, for goodness sake! I haven't even mentioned Daddy Long Legs with Fred Astaire!

In this case, the setting is a small town in France. Vianne and her young daughter arrive in the town carrying only a few suitcases and they rent an empty shop with an apartment on the second floor. Vianne opens a chocolate shop and her confections do what so many people have known for years about chocolate, it loosens their inhibitions and allows them to pursue happiness. There are indications that the special ingredients in the chocolate are also Mayan in origin.The mayor of the town is a very conservative man and the priest is new and very young, replacing a man that had served the town for decades. Being so young and new, the priest is easily influenced by the mayor to speak out on Sundays about the evils of self-gratification. However, not all members of the community oppose Vianne, she befriends a woman that is being abused and some of her confections prove to be a powerful aphrodisiac.The mayor continues to mount a campaign against Vianne and when river gypsies arrive, most of the people in the town adhere to a campaign of not allowing the river gypsies to trade in the town. Vianne befriends one of the leaders of the gypsies played by Johnny Depp and she learns once again how to satisfy her own desires for love and affection.There is a happy ending as the town learns to accept Vianne and her unusual confections, even the mayor has a change of heart, finally learning to let his deceased wife go. The performances are excellent, the hints of mysterious powers in the chocolate are not overused and in the end it comes down to another well-told story of finding your niche in the world.",5,"Perfect blend of ""magic"" and change for the better",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1719,"['insular', 'conformist', 'atmosphere', 'small', 'town', 'well-used', 'plot', 'device', 'literature', 'video', 'case', 'setting', 'small', 'town', 'France', 'Vianne', 'young', 'daughter', 'arrive', 'town', 'carrying', 'only', 'few', 'suitcases', 'rent', 'empty', 'shop', 'apartment', 'second', 'floor', 'Vianne', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'confections', 'do', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'known', 'years', 'chocolate', 'inhibitions', 'pursue', 'happiness', 'are', 'indications', 'special', 'ingredients', 'chocolate', 'are', 'also', 'Mayan', 'origin.The', 'mayor', 'town', 'very', 'conservative', 'man', 'priest', 'new', 'very', 'young', 'replacing', 'man', 'had', 'served', 'town', 'decades', 'Being', 'young', 'new', 'priest', 'easily', 'influenced', 'mayor', 'speak', 'out', 'Sundays', 'evils', 'self-gratification', 'However', 'not', 'members', 'community', 'oppose', 'Vianne', 'woman', 'being', 'abused', 'confections', 'prove', 'be', 'powerful', 'aphrodisiac.The', 'mayor', 'mount', 'campaign', 'Vianne', 'when', 'river', 'gypsies', 'arrive', 'most', 'people', 'town', 'adhere', 'campaign', 'not', 'allowing', 'river', 'gypsies', 'trade', 'town', 'Vianne', 'one', 'leaders', 'gypsies', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'satisfy', 'own', 'desires', 'love', 'affection.There', 'happy', 'ending', 'town', 'accept', 'Vianne', 'unusual', 'confections', 'even', 'mayor', 'change', 'heart', 'finally', 'learning', 'let', 'deceased', 'wife', 'go', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'hints', 'mysterious', 'powers', 'chocolate', 'are', 'not', 'overused', 'end', 'down', 'well-told', 'story', 'finding', 'niche', 'world']",N/A

Most of the film is beautiful photographed, except for certain scenes where Binoche is not lit to advantage and therefore made to appear less beautiful than she actually is.The saving grace of this film is the performances, notably by the children involved, by the magical Lena Olin (who's never turned in a less than fluid performance in her entire career), by Binoche who is growing nicely as an actor, and, always, by Judi Dench. Here is an actress who can take control of any scene without any effort but simply by dint of her formidable presence.The story itself is somewhat cliched; the pacing could've been improved with some judicious editing.

Well, nobody will ever accuse me a being a great friend of Roman Catholicism or of being a staunch conservative, but I too found this film to be pretty hard to stomach at times.What was most annoying for me was how black and white everything was in this film.  The liberated chocolatier versus the stuffed shirt mayor.  Worldly cosmopolitanism versus small-town provincialism.  I expect more from Lasse Hallstrom than a bunch of straw men waiting to be knocked down.I found the chocolatier to be unbearably smug, as she deftly solves, one after another, the various problems afflicting the townspeople.  You would think that these folks must be dumb as posts, because they seem incapable of solving their own predicaments.  Perhaps it is in fact because these types of problems are so rarely solved with a few simple words and some chocolate goodies.The treatment of the mayor was particularly hard to take.  Here was a man of obviously deep convictions who took his duties to his town quite seriously, yet he is an object of ridicule throughout the film.  His chocolate-induced collapse at the end of the movie struck me as a false note that could not be possibly be reconciled to the personality we had seen on the screen for the previous two hours.  It seem extremely contrived?  Is it possible that the filmmakers could not successfully resolve this storyline about the conflict between the two main characters?  Left with no resolution to the move, were they forced to cobble together this ridiculous conclusion?  It just seemed too forced and unbelievable.I don't like movies that pretend to have all of the answers.

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[13, 18]","Rarely do films blatently announce themselves as fairy tales and then proceed to position themselves not for children, but for older audiences and adults.  The film's tone is reminiscent of a child's fairy tale, but the film has adult sensuality and a conflict regarding religious beliefs as well. It's also an English language film (in case you were wondering) with an international cast of Swedish, German, English, American and French actors.The film is not all gooey sweetness and charm and refuses to play it safe.  It does not shy away from its sensuality and allows it's actors to show us more than one dimension of character.  Even the heavies are presented with a degree of compassion.  It's ultimately a romantic sensual film concentrating more on spirituality, fantasy and sensuality than on action, machismo and sex.  It is more a women's picture than a guy's movie.I believe Chocalat will soon become a very much admired holiday themed film for teenagers and adults to watch year after year.  It's more of an Easter holiday themed film, since it is set during Lent in 1959 than a Christmas film however.  It's a film that is more than a war between the ideologies of paganism and Christianity, and concerns itself with the true meaning of compassion, acceptance and understanding.  It's a better film than it was a book.We are introduced to the film with a brief voice over that begins Once Upon Time and shown  a remote French village, introducing a couple of it's characters.  There's an unfortunate over-use of some obvious CGI effects in the first establishing shots of the town.The town is ruled as it has been for generations by a member of the de Reynaud family.  An ancestors statue sternly stands guard in the center of town..  We meet the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who insists everyone it the town observe weekly mass, and adhere to a formal belief in  Christianity. He's the richest man in tower, the mayor and he helps the new priest in town by editing and rewriting his sermons-which he will later use to help turn the townspeople against the newest member of the village. His wife however has been a long extended Holiday in Italy-perhaps not intending to ever return. (In the book, it was the priest who was the heavy-the change means we don't see a priest being tyrannical and hypocritical instead he's a pawn in another man's `war'. This isn't playing it safer though, it's opening it up to be more than a battle of paganism versus Christianity.).  The Count believes in leading by example, so he's hard on himself, barely eating anything during his Lental fast and certainly not sweets.A mysterious woman named Vianne ( played superbly by Julliette Binoche)  and her child Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) appears as if traveling on a strong North Wind into the small town.  It is the way of these two. They have moved from town to town, sometimes leaving by choice, sometimes run out of town by a scared and fearful populace.  Vianne rents a long shuttered bakery from a crabby suspicious old woman (marvelously played by Judi Dench).  When the Count stops by to introduce himself to Vianne and invite her to church service, Vianne informs him she doesn't go to church.  When he frowns on the idea that she is going to open her bakery during Lent, she informs him it will not a bakery but only says what she is doing is a surprise.  The Count is shocked to learn that Vianne is not widowed, but has never been married.  He immediately is threatened by her presence and fears she means to challenge everything he stands for.  Does she?  It would seem not to be the case, but her presence is disruptive to the town.Finally she opens a chocolatier, specializing in all kinds of exotic chocolates, some promising to cure headaches, lift spirits and even save marriages.  We learn Vianne has a secret Chocolate recipe used by an ancient civilization and passed on to her by her mother.  A mother who felt it was her destiny to share her chocolate with the world and now... so does her daughter.How dare this brazen, unmarried, possible atheist woman open a decadent chocolate shop during  Lent !!!  Who does she think she is?  The Count  decides she is the enemy and must be banished from the town.  Meanwhile, she is winning converts... one of her secret chocolate recipes has brought passion back into a marriage, another has lifted up the spirits of her cranky old land-lady who then is re-united with her estranged grandson, and she befriends and then protects  the abused wife (wonderfully played by Lena Olin) of a tavern owner (Peter Stormare).  She even encourages a romance between old timers (Hugh O'Connor and Leslie Caron -yes THAT Leslie (An American in Paris) Caron.Who is this woman who almost seems to be dabbling in witchcraft, is making some changes in the townspeople, has an illegitimate daughter and refuses to go Church?  What is her real agenda? Is she evil?When a wandering band of Irish Gypsy river rats appears, the town quickly shuns them by order of the Mayor, The Count.  They can't legally kick them out of the town but they can make them want to go when they can find any odd jobs to get paid and they aren't served food or drink anywhere in the town. The leader of the River Rats (Johnny Depp) is accepted however by Vianne and a romance blossoms which further ostracizes her from the town and sets up a near tragic situation which leads to the film's conclusion.  It's not a completely predictable conclusion however-though certainly one which will please most audiences.Johnny Depp in his supporting role as  Roux, has never been more relaxed, nor as effective as he is here.  He's even got a good sounding Irish accent which sounds natural rather than actor forced.  Depp's been getting some critical notices for many years and he's been good in several pictures, but usually his technique as an actor brings an aloofness to the characters he portrays preventing them from being completely believable.  I've enjoyed his performances but this is the first time he seems completely at ease and natural.Director Lasse Hallstrom fresh off The Cider House Rules, and writer Rober Nelson Jacobs (from the novel by Joanne Harris) find the perfect balance of drama and comic whimsy to create a warm modern fable.Like the best fables there's a gentle, simple sweetness to the tale which requires a strong suspension of belief in the viewer.  There's a naivety to the story and characters in the film which could only exist in a fictional world.  We aren't bulldozed into the films charms, and we aren't spoon fed its sweetness either.  There are some moments of bitterness as well.  The film realizes several perfectly realized little moments which gave me a sense of exhilaration--the type I have felt while watching films like Wizard of Oz or It's a Wonderful Life.  And while Chocolat isn't quite that good, it does come close in many ways.  It's a film I look forward to viewing and enjoying many more times. . . perhaps annually during Lent.Chris Jarmick, Author (The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

660762,AGIO6BKKS1BUP,B00005K3OT,"C. Michael Massey ""litterateur""","[2, 3]","For me, much of the pleasure in this film lies in the way in which it taps into so many of the classic stories with which many of us have grown up. There is so much here that comes from other tales, myths, movies, etc. There is the &quot;clever North Wind&quot; bringing Vianne and Anouk to the village (not unlike the wind upon which Mary Poppins flew in and out via her umbrella). There is also the &quot;suspicious&quot; influences of Vianne and Anouk in the village which are akin not only to those of Mary Poppins in the Banks' household, but also of Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon when they entered Pleasantville.Of course, and as other reviewers have pointed out, another wonderful feature of this film is its amazing sensory appeal. The appeal is not, however, limited to taste, as one might expect of a film entitled *Chocolat*. It's rich in visual appeal--sunlight, firelight, candlelight, clouds, shadows; tactile appeal--snow, water, fire; and auditory appeal--with a beautifully haunting soundtrack and some very fun songs played by Johnny Depp as Roux and his fellow river rats.The only real problem I had with the movie really concerned the Comte de Reynaud. He seemed, unlike the other characters who managed to combine comedy with deeper thoughts and emotions, to be an entirely comic character. I personally believe that this is due to shallow character development. I wanted to know more about his personal life--what, in more detail, he was hiding from the townspeople that made him so pompous; what he thought about that made him so adamant about resisting temtation. He just didn't seem. . . tortured enough. Although he had certain traits that were familiar, his was a character that I have not encountered before and therefore needed more information in order to relate to him better.Despite my problem with the Comte de Reynaud, I think this is a wonderful film--perhaps even one of my all-time favorites--and therefore deserving of no fewer stars than five. The time of the film's setting--during Lent--is perfect for that which the film accentuates. Comedy, drama, mysticism, magic--it depicts so much in life which is there for us to enjoy.

This movie is about chocolate, but about its use as a healer and its power to ""unlock hidden yearnings and to shape destiny."" Figures, since depression can be alleviated by chocolate.  And the creator of this confection in this extremely palatable movie is a healer herself.Chocolat tells the story of two people who descend upon a provincial French village in the wake of a sly and strong north wind.  Those two people are Vianne and her young daughter Anouk.  Oh, perhaps I should say two people and an animal.  Anouk has an imaginary friend, Pontouf, who is a kangaroo.  She sets up shop, a potisserie, and opens it during Lent, not exactly perfect timing in a God-fearing village whose inhabitants believe in calm, tranquilitee, to use French.  Basically, knowing one's place, being obedient to authority, and going to church on Sunday are the pillars of this French village.The idealist and romantic Vianne comes against the extremely conservative mayor, the Comte de Reynaud, as well as most of the people here.  She doesn't wear black, doesn't go to church on Sundays, and (gasp!) is an unwed mother.  She is also the only one who accepts Roux, the handsome leader of raft-bound river rats the town shuns as being immoral.  As a wanderer herself, Vianne naturally finds affinity with the riverfolk.Before long, things start happening in the village.  People who buy her wares become more loosened in attitude, more courageous, and in the case of one married couple, saves their marriage with a rebirth in their sex life.  She also helps her landlady establish ties with her grandson, who has an affinity for drawing morbid pictures.  Basically, her altruistic spirit helps spread friendliness and helps certain townfolk relax from their hidebound ways.  Vianne gains the enmity of the mayor who sees her as an enemy, and seeks to drive her away by having sermons against temptation and of the powers of Satan concealing first a veiled, later an open attack against her wares.This will be the ultimate Juliette Binoche film for me, and my favourite movie of 2000.  (OK, I know it came out in '99 but it came to my local theatre that year.)  I must admit I was torn between her and Julia Roberts as my Best Actress choice for 2000.  I've seen Alfred Molina play a large variety of roles, be it as Kenneth Halliwell (Prick Up Your Ears), Satipo (Raiders Of The Lost Ark), and most recently, as Diego Rivera in Frida.  His portrayal shows he can act as a diametric opposite of Rivera, an uptight, stuffed shirt traditionalist.  Lena Olin gets kudos as Josephine, a misunderstood kleptomaniac in a trapped marriage who follows her own drum.  Naturally, she is one of the first to befriend Vianne.  Judi Dench as Armand the landlady, and Peter Stormare as Josephine's odious and abusive husband also shine out here.Chocolat also shows two things:  One, we need more people like Vianne to heal us.  Two, we need something to heal us, and no, I don't mean with standards such as religion or money, but something else that fills us within.  This movie's a nice confection that isn't sickly sweet or mere coloured sugar, but something with a rich flavour that will leave one's stomach glowing inside.",5,An exquisite confectionary tale about living,1040774400,"12 25, 2002",2002,3325,"['Whether', 'afternoon', 'teatime', 'snack', 'quick', 'pick-me-up', 'work', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'chocolate', 'become', 'staple', 'America', 'movie', 'chocolate', 'use', 'healer', 'power', 'unlock', 'hidden', 'yearnings', 'shape', 'destiny', 'Figures', 'depression', 'can', 'be', 'alleviated', 'chocolate', 'creator', 'confection', 'extremely', 'palatable', 'movie', 'healer', 'herself.Chocolat', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'descend', 'provincial', 'French', 'village', 'wake', 'sly', 'strong', 'north', 'wind', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'Vianne', 'young', 'daughter', 'Anouk', 'Oh', 'perhaps', 'should', 'say', 'two', 'people', 'animal', 'Anouk', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Pontouf', 'who', 'kangaroo', 'up', 'shop', 'potisserie', 'Lent', 'not', 'exactly', 'perfect', 'timing', 'God-fearing', 'village', 'inhabitants', 'believe', 'calm', 'tranquilitee', 'use', 'French', 'Basically', 'knowing', 'one', 'place', 'being', 'obedient', 'authority', 'going', 'church', 'Sunday', 'are', 'pillars', 'French', 'village.The', 'idealist', 'romantic', 'Vianne', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'mayor', 'Comte', 'de', 'Reynaud', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'people', 'here', ""n't"", 'wear', 'black', ""n't"", 'go', 'church', 'Sundays', 'gasp', 'unwed', 'mother', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Roux', 'handsome', 'leader', 'raft-bound', 'river', 'town', 'being', 'immoral', 'wanderer', 'Vianne', 'naturally', 'affinity', 'riverfolk.Before', 'long', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'village', 'People', 'who', 'buy', 'wares', 'become', 'more', 'loosened', 'attitude', 'more', 'courageous', 'case', 'one', 'married', 'couple', 'marriage', 'rebirth', 'sex', 'life', 'also', 'landlady', 'establish', 'ties', 'grandson', 'who', 'affinity', 'drawing', 'morbid', 'pictures', 'Basically', 'altruistic', 'spirit', 'spread', 'friendliness', 'certain', 'townfolk', 'relax', 'hidebound', 'ways', 'Vianne', 'gains', 'enmity', 'mayor', 'who', 'enemy', 'drive', 'away', 'having', 'sermons', 'temptation', 'powers', 'Satan', 'concealing', 'first', 'veiled', 'later', 'open', 'attack', 'wares.This', 'will', 'be', 'ultimate', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'film', 'favourite', 'movie', '2000', 'OK', 'know', 'came', 'out', ""'99"", 'came', 'local', 'theatre', 'year', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'torn', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Best', 'Actress', 'choice', '2000', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'play', 'large', 'variety', 'roles', 'be', 'Kenneth', 'Halliwell', 'Prick', 'Up', 'Ears', 'Satipo', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'most', 'recently', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'Frida', 'portrayal', 'can', 'act', 'diametric', 'opposite', 'Rivera', 'uptight', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'traditionalist', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'kudos', 'Josephine', 'misunderstood', 'kleptomaniac', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'who', 'own', 'drum', 'Naturally', 'one', 'first', 'befriend', 'Vianne', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Armand', 'landlady', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Josephine', 'odious', 'abusive', 'husband', 'also', 'out', 'here.Chocolat', 'also', 'two', 'things', 'One', 'need', 'more', 'people', 'Vianne', 'heal', 'Two', 'need', 'something', 'heal', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'standards', 'such', 'religion', 'money', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'nice', 'confection', ""n't"", 'sickly', 'sweet', 'mere', 'coloured', 'sugar', 'something', 'rich', 'flavour', 'will', 'leave', 'one', 'stomach', 'glowing', 'inside']",N/A
660768,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005K3OT,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 7]","Chocolat is a wonderful little film that has much to say people, as individuals and as groups. With its exotic yet familiar feel, beguiling music, and focus on truly human characters, the movie stands as an oasis in the middle of the desert we call life. Don't get the idea that this film is boring just because it doesn't feature a lot of ""action,"" as there is a great deal going on in the lives of these characters. They are all at a collective crossroads, only it's not really a crossroads because the only real options are to go forward or backward.The setting is a quaint French village which stands starkly on tradition; new people with new ideas just aren't welcome there at all. The best way that I can think to describe the social setting is to say that these are French people being French. There's one self-righteous, powerful know-it-all at the top who tells everyone what to do and how to do it, and all of the villagers are too cowardly to rock the boat or think for themselves. Living in the past is a miserable way to live. You've got an elderly woman still mourning her husband's death 42 years after the fact, a younger widow who won't let her son doing anything because she's afraid something will happen to him, a wife who won't leave her abusive husband, etc. Everyone is so worried about what others might think of them that they don't really live. The mayor is so puritanically dominant that he even writes the sermons for the young village priest.Things start to change when a stranger and her daughter show up (wearing red cloaks, no less) and open a chocolate shop. There's a bewitching quality to Vianne (Juliette Binoche), as she seems to know the right kind of chocolate for each person who enters her shop, and there really is some kind of unquantifiable power in her delicious concoctions. With it, she melts the hardened heart of a grumbling old woman (played magnificently by Judi Dench), puts the romance back into a passionless marriage, and even helps give an abused wife the strength to leave her worthless husband. The mayor and most of the townspeople are not at all happy - and then things get even worse, as a band of ""river rats"" settles on the local riverbanks. The whole town just says no to ""immorality"" and refuses to serve or have anything to do with the ""dangerous"" riff-raff - but Vianne does. She hits it off particularly well with a guitar-playing nomad named Roux (Johnny Depp).Naturally, all of this internal conflict going on inside everyone eventually comes to a climax - and it is here, in particular, that we see both the good and bad side of humanity. There are some really poignant moments as the film draws near to a conclusion, and in the end you're left with something tangible, a renewed spirit. Maybe it's just for a few moments, but you stop and think about the truly important things in life. That's what makes this beguiling little film so special.",5,Stop and smell the chocolate,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,2915,"['Chocolat', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'much', 'say', 'people', 'individuals', 'groups', 'exotic', 'yet', 'familiar', 'feel', 'beguiling', 'music', 'focus', 'truly', 'human', 'characters', 'movie', 'oasis', 'middle', 'desert', 'call', 'life', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'idea', 'film', 'boring', 'just', ""n't"", 'feature', 'lot', 'action', 'great', 'deal', 'going', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', 'collective', 'crossroads', 'only', 'not', 'really', 'crossroads', 'only', 'real', 'options', 'are', 'go', 'forward', 'backward.The', 'setting', 'quaint', 'French', 'village', 'starkly', 'tradition', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'ideas', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'welcome', 'there', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'describe', 'social', 'setting', 'say', 'are', 'French', 'people', 'being', 'French', 'one', 'self-righteous', 'powerful', 'know-it-all', 'top', 'who', 'everyone', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'do', 'villagers', 'are', 'too', 'cowardly', 'rock', 'boat', 'think', 'Living', 'past', 'miserable', 'way', 'live', ""'ve"", 'got', 'elderly', 'woman', 'still', 'mourning', 'husband', 'death', '42', 'years', 'fact', 'younger', 'widow', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'son', 'doing', 'anything', 'afraid', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'wife', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'abusive', 'husband', 'etc', 'Everyone', 'so', 'worried', 'what', 'others', 'might', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'live', 'mayor', 'so', 'puritanically', 'dominant', 'even', 'sermons', 'young', 'village', 'priest.Things', 'start', 'change', 'when', 'stranger', 'daughter', 'show', 'up', 'wearing', 'red', 'cloaks', 'less', 'open', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'bewitching', 'quality', 'Vianne', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'know', 'right', 'kind', 'chocolate', 'person', 'who', 'shop', 'there', 'really', 'kind', 'unquantifiable', 'power', 'delicious', 'concoctions', 'melts', 'hardened', 'heart', 'grumbling', 'old', 'woman', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'romance', 'back', 'passionless', 'marriage', 'even', 'give', 'abused', 'wife', 'strength', 'leave', 'worthless', 'husband', 'mayor', 'most', 'townspeople', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'band', 'river', 'rats', 'settles', 'local', 'riverbanks', 'whole', 'town', 'just', 'immorality', 'serve', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'dangerous', 'riff-raff', 'Vianne', 'off', 'particularly', 'well', 'guitar-playing', 'nomad', 'named', 'Roux', 'Johnny', 'Depp', '.Naturally', 'internal', 'conflict', 'going', 'everyone', 'eventually', 'climax', 'here', 'particular', 'see', 'good', 'bad', 'side', 'humanity', 'are', 'really', 'poignant', 'moments', 'film', 'draws', 'conclusion', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'something', 'tangible', 'renewed', 'spirit', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'stop', 'think', 'truly', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'what', 'beguiling', 'little', 'film', 'so', 'special']",N/A

The movie captivated us and after watching it I went online and ordered a copy from Amazon.One of the nice things about rentals is the opportunity to examine before buying; sort of like a test drive in the new car your considering buying.

The main difference is this movie is not portrayed as a fantasy, and we are expected to regard the heroine's role as the chocolate fairy hawking her medicinal goodies with absolute seriousness.  If you can do this (and some will do it more easily than others) you then have to look past the cliched, cardboard characters; the ultra-conservative religious civil leader, the degenerate wife beater, the crotchety old dowager with a secret heart of gold.  Once that is done you must look past the blatantly predictable storyline, plot &quot;twists&quot; you can see a mile off and &quot;symbolism&quot; that hits you with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  If you like Johnny Depp (which I do), be prepared to see his talents wasted as his understated character serves two purposes 1) to serve as a downtrodden misfit whom the heroine can befriend and prove how politically correct (i.e., &quot;good&quot;) she is and 2) to provide a sex scene, which all modern movies must have, because &quot;how can there be love without great sex&quot; asks the modern scriptwriter.After doing all this I concluded that &quot;Chocolat&quot; was an entertaining date movie, but not in any way great art, or even a great film.

Despite its 20th century setting, the village seems to have been caught in a time warp; evidence a lady in mourning for her husband who died in World War I!! The Mayor, of aristocratic descent, is the de facto seigneur of the village and nothing is too small for his touch. He manages his rented properties as a benevolent landlord, where the commercial rental relationship is almost subordinate to the underlying feudal loyalty. At the root of the village's life, he literally instructs the village priest on the sermon to be preached at Sunday mass. His focus is to keep the village faithful to the traditions of the past, including those of his own aristocratic ancestors. Deserted by his wife, a desertion he cannot comprehend and tries stubbornly to deny, his retreat for comfort into orthodox Christianity is stalled by the entry of Binoche. A non-conformist to the core, Binoche gently but firmly turns the quiet village topsy-turvy, not so much by open confrontation of established village norms, but rather by simply ignoring those norms she considers irrelevant - be they attending the Church or refusing to fudge her single mother status. Chocolate, once known as the food of the gods, here is a metaphor as Binoche uses her tempting concoctions to entice and provoke the villagers into questioning their lives and perhaps changing them for the better. There are no real bad guys here (barring Serge) : for all his prissiness, the Mayor is a decent man adrift in a world he cannot control. Nor is the teaching one-sided: At the end of the movie, Binoche has been changed as much as the villagers.

When the mysterious Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), dressed in red capes, arrive in town on a day the wind from the North gusts open the church doors, interrupting the sermon on the first day of Lent, something begins to stir.  The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) knows it better than anyone.  Vianne opens a chocolaterie, serving up exotic confections designed to bring out the best in people, and relationships in the grim town shift.  Vianne seems immune to her own magic - until a band of gypsies and their leader Roux (Johnny Depp) set up camp on the edge of town.Director Lasse Hallstrom excels in his evocation of a small French village in 1959 and the people inhabiting it.  Despite its Swedish director, British author, and international cast, this film feels authentically French.  Its rhythms are mostly gentle, and its focus is on character rather than an intricate plot.  Juliette Binoche turns in a fine performance, even though her smile at times seems too vapid and easy for such a complicated character.

660783,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005K3OT,Dennis Littrell,"[14, 14]","This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor.  The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching.  Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat.  Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud.  With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula.  Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel.  Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter.  Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter.  Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996).  She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys.  It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout.  However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad.  Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience.  He attempts the complex and the unlikely.  Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience.  There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine.  Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate.  It was quickly followed by coffee and tea.  Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day.  Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church.  Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role.  Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!).  She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community.  She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots.  She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about.  So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home.  Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying.  It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability.  Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society.  He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his ""favorite"" chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses.  Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females.  When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France.  If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie.  As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.",4,Chocolate reforms the church!,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,5198,"['American', 'movie',

The movie, directed by Lasse Hallstrom falls no short of magical charm - and plays it well sublimely with a great supporting ensemble like Judi Dench, Carrie Anne Moss and Johnny depp as Roux, her love interest to branch the subplots that made the movie a tantalizing delight.It is the acting that shines, Binoche plays Vianne with a subtle charm and resilience that illuminates alongside with Lena Olin as a battered wife. Judi Dench spices the screem with wit and hard emotions and Alfred Molina is aptly casted as the mayor with the prim and proper decorum. Chocolat is simple as a story that dissects the quandry between temptations and morality, and a lighthearted note on human emotions. Forgivance is seen in the mother and daughter feud, hope when Vianne sees Josephine (Lena Olin) as a friend. It is all heartwarming and yet the correct amount of saccharine to make this movie a delight.

Acts 17:24.The small French village where Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter (Victoire Thivisol) come to live (delivered by the clever north wind) has been ruled by strict and narrow convention for a long time. The local count (Alfred Molino) is the powerful mayor who ""helps"" the priest write sermons critical of actions eschewing denial of the flesh. The town's unhappy people live in fear of their neighbor's censure, their god's wrath, and happiness in any form. ""Right"" action rules. Sunday mass in the town's cathedral is a mixture of furtive unruly behavior and external show.But Vianne is a force to be reckoned with. The daughter of a French pharmacist who traveled abroad and met and married her mystical mother in Latin America, Vianne understands the magical properties of natural substances properly mixed and administered. Soon Vianne opens a shop where she concocts chocolate confections to minister to any need-physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. Chocolate--elixir for the gods and one of nature's wonders is her main ingredient, although others such as selected chili peppers play a part.As if things weren't strained enough by the arrival of Vianne and her tempting sweets, the poor mayor soon encounters a ""gang"" of river rats who descend on his doorstep one fine day. These Irish travelers are led by Roux (Johnny Depp), a pig-tailed, charming young man who is musically gifted. Vianne and Roux soon stir up all sorts of excitement for the town's inhabitants and destroy the straight-jacket ""tranquility"" of the little village.I waited to see CHOCOLAT until I could buy the DVD, and it was worth the wait. My granddaughters and I have watched CHOCOLAT several times. We love this film with it's fine cast of characters including the wonderful English actors Judi Dench and John Wood, as well as Leslie Caron with whom I fell in love when I was a little girl and she played LILI in the 1950s film.Judi Dench is well known, and John Wood less so, but he frequently plays character actors and is very recognizable. He and Alfred Molino played parts in LADYHAWKE, where Molino was Cesar the man who hunted wolves, and Wood the wicked bishop. Rounding out the stellar crew is Lasse Hallstrom the director, who proved in MY LIFE AS A DOG and THE SHIPPING NEWS that he can elicit marvelous performances from children. Victorire Thivisol played PONETTE a few years ago and she remains a wonderful young actress.CHOCOLAT is a magical film that reminds me that life is about living.",5,The joy of life.....,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,2583,"['God', 'who', 'made', 'world', 'everything', 'not', 'live', 'shrines', '17:24.The', 'small', 'French', 'village', 'where', 'Vianne', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'daughter', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'come', 'live', 'delivered', 'clever', 'north', 'wind', 'been', 'ruled', 'strict', 'narrow', 'convention', 'long', 'time', 'local', 'count', 'Alfred', 'Molino', 'powerful', 'mayor', 'who', 'priest', 'write', 'sermons', 'critical', 'actions', 'eschewing', 'denial', 'flesh', 'town', 'unhappy', 'people', 'live', 'fear', 'neighbor', 'censure', 'god', 'wrath', 'happiness', 'form', 'Right', 'action', 'rules', 'Sunday', 'mass', 'town', 'cathedral', 'mixture', 'furtive', 'unruly', 'behavior', 'external', 'show.But', 'Vianne', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'daughter', 'French', 'pharmacist', 'who', 'traveled', 'abroad', 'met', 'married', 'mystical', 'mother', 'Latin', 'America', 'Vianne', 'magical', 'properties', 'natural', 'substances', 'properly', 'mixed', 'administered', 'Soon', 'Vianne', 'shop', 'where', 'chocolate', 'confections', 'minister', 'need-physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'Chocolate', 'elixir', 'gods', 'one', 'nature', 'wonders', 'main', 'ingredient', 'others', 'such', 'selected', 'chili', 'peppers', 'play', 'part.As', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'strained', 'enough', 'arrival', 'Vianne', 'tempting', 'sweets', 'poor', 'mayor', 'soon', 'gang', 'river', 'rats', 'who', 'descend', 'doorstep', 'one', 'fine', 'day', 'Irish', 'travelers', 'are', 'led', 'Roux', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'pig-tailed', 'charming', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'musically', 'gifted', 'Vianne', 'Roux', 'soon', 'stir', 'up', 'sorts', 'excitement', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'destroy', 'straight-jacket', 'tranquility', 'little', 'village.I', 'waited', 'see', 'CHOCOLAT', 'could', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'granddaughters', 'have', 'watched', 'CHOCOLAT', 'several', 'times', 'love', 'film', 'fine', 'cast', 'characters', 'including', 'wonderful', 'English', 'actors', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'John', 'Wood', 'as', 'well', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'whom', 'fell', 'love', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'played', 'LILI', '1950s', 'film.Judi', 'Dench', 'well', 'known', 'John', 'Wood', 'less', 'so', 'frequently', 'character', 'actors', 'very', 'recognizable', 'Alfred', 'Molino', 'played', 'parts', 'LADYHAWKE', 'where', 'Molino', 'was', 'Cesar', 'man', 'who', 'hunted', 'wolves', 'Wood', 'wicked', 'bishop', 'Rounding', 'out', 'stellar', 'crew', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'director', 'who', 'proved', 'MY', 'LIFE', 'A', 'DOG', 'THE', 'SHIPPING', 'NEWS', 'can', 'elicit', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'children', 'Victorire', 'Thivisol', 'played', 'PONETTE', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'wonderful', 'young', 'actress.CHOCOLAT', 'magical', 'film', 'life', 'living']",N/A

660793,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00005K3OT,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[6, 7]","First, let me start this review by saying how much I adore chocolate (the food).  I mean, there is a reason that women love this stuff.  Personally, I would even be so bold as to say I prefer my chocolate dark and bittersweet (I can get more antioxidents from this, too--another incentive).  Now, moving on to the movie.  How would I describe CHOCOLAT if I were to compare it to a bar of the dark stuff?  Well, I can't say it tastes authentic.  My favorite type of chocolate isn't even European, or French, for that matter.  It's Ecuadorian, with a cocoa count of [at least] 75%.  CHOCOLAT wants to be this kind of chocolate.  Instead, it ends being more of a blend of Hershey's milk chocolate (to please the American consumers) with the sensibility of a dash of French dark.  In other words, not really smooth or memorable, but it wants to be!I'll add in just a dash of synopsis, here, to get a sense of the recipe.  For starters, director Lasse Hallstrom (or should I say ""sous chef"") paints the picture of a conservative little French town that Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) swoops into, with her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol).  This ultimately poses a great challenge to the Comte (Alfred Molina) and most everyone else.  Why?  Because Vianne has set up a Chocolaterie (chocolate shop) during Lent--an observance that the devoutly Catholic villagers strongly uphold.  This is a time when they abstain from indulgences (especially foods like chocolate!).  This also co-stars Johnny Depp.Though, CHOCOLAT delivers in terms of visual beauty and spectacle, and the chocolates look divine, the storyline and most of the rest of this film leave a lot to be desired.  Yes, a lot of you will think I am being harsh.  Yet, while I sat there, watching this film (I won't even lie to you--I saw it twice), I couldn't help but feel that CHOCOLAT stole gimmicks from virtually every film genre focusing on mysticism, magical realism or food and claimed them as their own.  The filmmakers desperately wanted to make the story something for everyone.  We have a swashbuckling pirate (Johnny Depp), who is Irish, nonetheless.  We have the mysterious stranger who sails into a town with her daughter, and no one knows her background.  Is she a heretic?  A witch with a cauldron of chocolatey sacreligious goodness--made to saturate and corrupt the palates of the unsuspecting villagers?  We even have a subplot alluding to a battered wife (Lena Olin).

Vianne rents a shop which opens to the town square where she opens an unique Chocolate shop. The only problem is ... it is Lent. The town is mostly Catholic, they are celebrating Lent by abstaining from certain pleasures, one of which is likely chocolate. Depriving oneself or abstaining from something one loves is a custom or tradition during Lent. Vianne is an outsider, she and her daughter are trying to fit in and be accepted. In a small French town which has a long history with many old traditions and customs, this is a difficult endeavor. This delightful film shows how prejudice and stubborn beliefs *toward* *newcomers* can be overcome ... with humor and chocolate. Serious moments arise when vindictiveness and cruelty challenge the main characters spirit and nature, yet in the end understanding and kindness prevail.The eccentric characters in the film are delightful and funny ... The mayor acts ""holier-than-thou"" except his secretary Caroline knows the truth ... There may be marriage problems between the mayor and his wife. The wife had gone on an extended vacation to Italy, with no definite date to return. Caroline seems an up-tight and very controlling personality  related to her son and her mother who is elderly.Then the viewer discovers, the mother is diabetic and does not monitor her food intake properly which makes her health deteriorate. The mayor learns Vianne is a single mother of which he disapproves. He provides gossip about her to the towns people, influencing them to avoid her shop. However, the mouth-watering treats are a temptation several citizens can not resist. One such person is an elderly gentleman and his dog  as they walk by the shop daily. It is the dog that is drawn to the treats . The elderly man wants to court a widow ... Vianne gives him pointers on how to win over his lady love ...Some gypsies enter the scene as they arrive in house boats and dock on the Thames. From this point forward, the story gets more complicated ... Vianne gets involved romantically with the leader of the gypsies. Vianne provides a home and shelter to an abused wife of a bar owner. The husband of this wife goes to classes to learn how to improve his behavior, he appears contrite and ""reformed"" but in the end, as they say ""a leopard does not lose his spots"" and he nearly ruins the lives of many people, nearly killing many by an act of cruelty. The conclusion of the film ties together the serious and humorous aspects of the story in a most creative manner. This film is amusing, charming, and delightful. It has a very satisfying ending.

Binoche slowly wins over the townspeople with her delicious concoctions, but the mayor (Alfred Molina) is unmoved, as is a severe women who works with him (Carrie Anne Moss, virtually unrecognisable from her role as Trinity in The Matrix). Binoche's daughter is charmingly portrayed by young actress Victoire Thivisol, who was first seen as a tiny child in the engaging and sad French film Ponette. Binoche's love interest is played by Johnny Depp, who is summarily shunned by the town. Other fascinating roles, the always superb Judi Dench as the woman who rents the shop to Binoche (and as Moss's estranged mother. Moss will not allow Dench to see her grandson, but Binoche conspires to allow grandmother and grandson to see one another secretly at her shop). Also important here are the roles of the abused wife, Lena Olin (real-life wife of director Lasse Hallstrom) and her husband, played well by Peter Stormare (whom you may remember best as the accomplice to the crime in Fargo.

660806,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005K3OT,"""flickjunkie""","[6, 7]","&quot;Chocolat&quot; is a film with a story as richly textured as the confections sold by Vianne in her Chocolaterie.  It is a story of many layers that appears to be one flavor on the outside, but changes as the confection dissolves in our psyche.  On its face, it is a story about an endless drifter named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk, who take up residence in a small French town in the 1950's and open a Chocolate shop right in the middle of Lent.  However, once the initial layer melts away we realize that this is not a story about Vianne, but really a story about the town and its people.Vianne is more of a catalyst to the stories around her than a story unto herself.  Ironically, Binoche is a lead actor in a supporting role despite having the camera on her most of the time.  If there is one consistent theme that runs through the film it is one of reconciliation.  Prior to Vianne's arrival, several of the townspeople had survived in a kind of stasis, with unresolved issues never addressed or confronted.  Vianne is the straw that stirs the drink and brings various issues into the open to be examined and resolved.The film has a strong feminist subtext, which is not objectionable by itself, but too often becomes strident and preachy.  Of greater value is the subtle message that provincial ignorance is well served by exposure to new and non-conforming ideas (Vianne and Roux) and that the forces that promote ignorance and conformity out of fear of change (Comte de Reynaud) are no match for the power of knowledge and the freedom to exercise it.  In this way, the film is very uplifting and relevant despite its folksy telling.As he did with ""The Cider House Rules"", Lasse Hallstrom lets the story dominate the screen, bringing us well developed character studies without excessive directorial stylizing.  Hallstrom's strength lies in character interpretation and in guiding the actors to broaden and deepen their portrayals.  This is clearly evident here.Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance that earned her a best actress nomination from the Academy.  Judy Dench continues to make great acting a routine, garnering her third best supporting actress nomination for her role.  Lena Olin gives a standout performance as the battered wife struggling to regain her self esteem.

The other day, however, as I was walking through the store with the big red bullseye logo and saw the DVD selling for $5.00, I thought, for that price, I might as well buy it. Well, I found ""Chocolat"" to be a delightful box full of delicious bonbons, a perfect pick-me-up for a case of the Winter Doldrums. I loved the characters (especially Judi Dench, and the children), the French village settings, and the spun-sugar fairytale atmosphere.Fortunately, I had not read some of the more negative Amazon reviews. While watching the film, for instance, it never once occurred to me to look for the dastardly feminist liberal metaphors that some reviewers have intuited. I also realize that French villages are not really like the one in the movie. I took the film at face value, and, my advice is that you do so too.

Characters are fully realized: Francis Reynaud, the guilt-ridden parish cure' with his cold eyes and ""the measuring, feline look of one who is uncertain of his territory;""  the 81-year-old  Armande Voizin ""with a smile that worked her apple-doll face into a million wrinkles;"" and the venal wife-beater, Muscat, who struts ""stiff-legged like a dog scenting a fight.""Vianne Rocher and her six-year-old daughter are wanderers.  They arrive in Lansquenet on Shrove Tuesday, where their appearance is greeted with veiled curiosity by villagers who ""have learned the art of observation without eye contact.""  Battle lines are drawn when Vianne opens La Celeste Praline, a gaily decorated confectioner's shop on the town square, directly across from the austere St. Jerome's church overseen by Pere Reynaud.It is Lent, the priest has decreed abstinence, deprivation.  Yet, Vianne's shop is a ""red-and-gold confection,"" her window a proliferation of truffles, pralines, Venus's nipples, candied fruits, hazelnut clusters, candied rose petals, all there to tempt Reynaud's parishioners.  He sees it as a disgrace, a degradation of the faith, and eventually preaches against Vianne from his pulpit.When a band of gypsies moor their colorful houseboats at the village's small harbor, the prelate asks them to leave.  Vianne welcomes them, further infuriating Reynaud.  Weakened by his self-imposed Lenten fasts, he denies his hunger and  watches her shop with ""loathing and fascination"" as he begins plotting to rid Lansquenet of what he believes is her evil influence.One of Vianne's staunchest allies is a kindred spirit, the elderly Armande, the village's oldest inhabitant who delights in reminding Reynaud ""of things best forgotten,"" and dares to invite the gypsies to remain as  her guests.At times fearful of the consequences, Vianne turns to her mother's cards, seeking an answer in augury.  Nonetheless, she stands her ground, even making plans for a ""Grand Festival Du Chocolat"" on Easter Sunday.  It would be a celebration with games in the square and a riot of sweets in the shop.  But Reynaud sees it as an affront, an excess, he would have ""The egg, the hare, still living symbols of the tenacious roots of paganism exposed for what they are.""Wisely compressing the film to the days between Shrove Tuesday and Easter Monday, the director uses impeccable pacing in  leading to  Reynaud's  final assault,  an effort to destroy the festival and Vianne along with it.A surprising yet fitting denouement caps this deftly told tale of lust, greed and love.  Francophiles will be drawn to the evocative depictations of daily village life, while gourmands  revel in  the mouth-watering scenes of chocolate preparation.

That's how it tasted to me, anyway ... a pretty confection, like a chocolate-filled eclair, though the chocolate had just a hint of pepper. I might have preferred MORE food, a longer culinary build-up to the birthday feast that becomes the turning-point of the story. It's also a film in the vein of ""magic realism"" established by Latin American novelists. One can't help comparing it to ""Like Water for Chocolate."" That comparison does expose the shortcomings of Chocolat: there's not enough of the manic energy, there's nothing quite as funny or as poignant, and the acting isn't half as good. Johnny Depp is more mannequin than Man, more Hollywood pirate than Gallic gypsy. Juliette Binoche plays her role more as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother than as the half-Mayan sorceress she's supposed to be. Only veteran actress Judi Dench shows theatrical savvy -- control of her body, ability to express large emotions with a flicker of her eyes or lips, 'economy' of gesture and posture. She can act!There are quite a few vitriolic one-star reviews of this film. Many of them compare it unfavorably to the book; since I haven't read the book, I can only suppose they have a point, but I don't much care. The film was a sweet treat, the sort of confection it's best to forget you've eaten lest you feel guilty about your waist-line or waste-time. Other reviews denounce the film as being hostile to religion, specifically to conservative Catholicism. They are correct. Vianne, the chocolate-sorceress, is indeed an atheist, though her stance seems mostly gratuitous. Her 'adversary' in the film is not the puppy priest but the repressed, hypocritical Count. Yes, the film can be taken as anti-clerical, and if you are fundamentally an anti-disestablishmentarian, you'd be wise to skip it.Perhaps the best part of the film is the photography of the village near Toulouse. Yes, dears, there ARE villages in France just as picturesque and unspoiled as that one, and with any luck you'll find a celebrated gourmet restaurant there.

She opens a chocolate shop, which tempts the hapless villagers during Lent. Although the film is about tolerance, she seems completely oblivious or uncaring as to her causing the townspeople to stumble in their religious observances, openly inviting them to sample her wares during the holy season. Although she is rebuked for this, it is done through the unlikeable religious villain, so she's actually given a free pass on this. Figures of spousal, parental, and spiritual authority are ridiculed. Traditional marriage is likewise shown to be defunct. In the cookie-cutter mould of films like these, &quot;religious&quot; types resort to hatred, violence, etc. in God's name. There is a little balance, however. At the end, the young priest gives a message on tolerance. This might be good (tolerance = loving the person while rejecting their error) or bad (new tolerance = accepting and applauding error), depending how it is interpreted. Also, the &quot;bad guy&quot; is finally humanized, and the townspeople suddenly realize that Christ calls them to love! Wow, what a revelation.

But a word of caution is appropriate for those who haven't seen it, but are considering buying the DVD. My advice is to see it once before you decide.I found a couple of points irritating. One is the misguided representation of clergy. The new priest, just out of seminary, is too weak and scared to deal with the local bigwig in any way other than trembling (and complete) obedience. At the end of the movie, the priest--apparently just now figuring out how to articulate this--has the realization that people matter, life is beautiful, the world has riches worth experiencing, etc. etc. As in so many movies, the role of the priest/minister/pastor is written as someone who somehow, after years of seminary training, presumably some life-changing experiences, and solemn vows before God, has never before had the opportunity to think deeply about life, is too terrified by someone in power to buck the system, and has to learn these most basic truths from a lady who magically descends on the town like Mary Poppins and sets up a chocolate shop.As an example of the low regard this movie has for your interpretive abilities, an abusive husband says something about his victim not even knowing how to use a skillet. Later in self-defense she will hit him over the head with a skillet. Very well. But since you obviously don't get it, she says, ""Who says I can't use a skillet?"" But since you STILL don't get it, the two conscious adult characters now break into laughter at this witty bon mot (having just survived a terrifying assault). Talk about getting hit over the head.At one point, Judi Dench's character says to Juliette Binoche's, ""Don't look so damn pleased with yourself."" I had the same reaction to the whole production.I admit I wasn't even stirred by the elaborate chocolate creations, as one is supposed to be in a ""food movie."" (They didn't have to use slow motion in Big Night or Babette's Feast when people put food into their mouths to show how delectable it was supposed to be.)The actors in this outstanding cast carry the day, and are a pleasure to watch (Alfred Molina in particular, who, given the role of a two-dimensional conformist, somehow manages to make him grow throughout the film). And the DVD bonus material is good. For some, this movie will be a most welcome, momentary escape.

660820,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005K3OT,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","""The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies."" Okay. I don't have much use for chocolate, really, except for sippin' the occasional hot cuppa, and the cynical curmudgeon in me grumbles at the tradition of purchasing chocolate for your sweetheart (and don't even get the curmudgeon started on flowers). So I don't know that I buy into chocolate as a sort of universal panacea. But I did like CHOCOLAT, a film about sensuous magical realism and a shifting of status quo and the acceptance of things strange and new, and it's about romance and, of course, chocolat. The cynical curmudgeon in me just passed out.Journey back to 1959 and eyeball that tiny, quaint French village down there. Observe the air of ""tranquilit&eacute;,"" which for the purposes of this film is defined as staidness and, perhaps - no, definitely - repression. And also note the residents attending church, and that tamped down sense of vague discontent even as they worship. Then a heavy gust blows, and blows open the church door and also blows into town two red-cloaked figures which will change various lives before it's all over. I quote: ""A sly wind blew in from the North.""The newcomers are Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk, and the tiny village is soon richer by the count of one humble chocolaterie, or a chocolate shop. As the movie audience promptly learns, the village's strings are pulled by the Comte de Reynaud, a pious gent who happens to be Mayor and whose wife may or may not be away on an extended holiday. As we also eventually learn, the Comte isn't truly a villainous soul, only that he believes he knows what is best for the community, this including observing Lent stringently and keeping at bay all things untoward and controversial. This last part, it would quickly dawn on the Mayor, would have to include tearing down Vianne Rocher, her business and her reputation. The Mayor would prefer his village to remain a sleepy one.Vianne enjoys walking around in her red shoes and being la vonne vivante and demonstrating that joie de vivre, and that about drains my French lexicon. It's made obvious early on that the movie's central conflict will revolve around Vianne's free-spirited nature and the Comte's attempts to stamp down that liveliness and sense of freedom. She's friendly and that's fine, but, in her exuberance, Vianne also thumbs her nose at proprieties and gently mocks the Mayor (""Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?"" she offers him.). She ignores the village's religious structure (and, by that, I mean she refuses to go to church), opening her shop during Lent (a time of abstinence and sincere penitence) and orchestrating a pagan chocolate spring festival at the same time as Easter Sunday. So, no, the Mayor doesn't enjoy having his moral superiority tweaked. We see the Mayor admonishing Vianne: ""You don't misbehave here. It's just not done, did you know that?"" Whispers abound about whether she's a radical or even an atheist.Meanwhile, Vianne does start making a few friends here and there, and her chocolate fineries are things of wonder. Vianne claims to know what sort of chocolate best suits her clientele, and this is the part where that opening sentence comes in. ""The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies."" Soon Vianne is doling out delectables and remedies, although, as in the best of stories, these remedies work their mojo in an indirect way. Throughout all this, the mayor is busting her chops. And it all gets a lot worse when the river throws up several boatloads of families and drifters. Except, for the movie audience, this is where things really kick up a notch, because at this stage Vianne goes from serving mostly as a plot vessel to someone infinitely more human and more riveting.On board one of those boats is Roux, disarmingly, roguishly played by Johnny Depp, and he is, of course, Vianne's love interest. And, to play up the romantic tension, Vianne has a bit of trouble guessing which chocolate is right for Roux. Anyway, if one thought the Comte De Reynaud was unhappy before, imagine the state of apoplexy he achieves when river rats suddenly begin to sully his bailiwick. He can't say it aloud, but he's probably thinking: ""Sacr&eacute; merde!""As the movie progresses, we learn about Vianne's parents and how her vagabond mother set her about her wandering ways, traveling village to village at the whims of the North wind, dispensing cacao remedies. We learn the cracks in Vianne's irrepressible nature and we learn that her daughter Anouk is unsettled enough with the lack of stability that she's invented an imaginary kangaroo friend as a form of security blanket. So it's not a fairy tale life after all, following the North wind.CHOCOLAT is a wonderful film, and makes me want to read Joanne Harris's novel, although, from what I understand, the role of the Big Bad was altered from being that of a priest in the book to that of the mayor in the film adaptation. Nevertheless, Alfred Molina is superlative, lending a depth and complexity and a melancholy to his character (see how forlornly he gazes at his wife's picture), elevating the Comte de Reynaud to beyond mere token villain status.It's the feel of the thing which I appreciate the most, I think. CHOCOLAT feels like a charming fairy tale peopled with real life characters. The tone is right away established with the narrator's voice over (supposedly the voice of a grown up Anouk) and the two wind-blown figures in red. The cinematography is exquisite, the exteriors shot in France (the little village is post card picturesque!), the interiors apparently filmed mostly in England's west country and just outside London. And the musical score perfectly supports whatever mood is invoked onscreen. So, okay, I don't know that the dialogue is all that brilliant, even though I did like it. What I do know is that the words in the script are enlivened by a cast of marvelous actors. The battered housewife, the embittered landlady estranged from her family, the repressed lovely assistant of the Comte, the widow who may or may not be grieving over her four-decades-gone husband... these are characters who develop as they fall under Vianne's cheerful ministrations and are themselves empowered. As portrayed by Lena Olin, a sublime Judi Dench, Carrie-Anne Moss, and a still vibrant Leslie Caron, they each add memorable color to CHOCOLAT. I should mention young and talented Victoire Thivisol, as well. She plays Anouk, and she impresses me enough that I aim to look up PONETTE, in which at only four years old she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival! How awesome is that?But it all falls on Juliette Binoche, ultimately, and her delightful performance transports the movie to a wonderful viewing experience. Juliette is older now, and yet she's just as exquisite in her maturity. She seems more solid, somehow, than when she was taking on those sex goddess parts in earlier films. As Vianne, I've never liked her more. And she's still beautiful, her inner light keeps on shining. I think the word I'm looking for is ""luminous,"" although that description's probably been beaten into the ground.CHOCOLAT is that same old package, really, done plenty of times and touting that same message, but this time it's presented with grace and a certain lightness. You get a smattering of romance. Quite a bit of prejudice. Religion, as a restricting engine, again gets a beating. The consumption of foods is just about equated to foreplay. And Johnny Depp plucks at a steel guitar. It's a fable that is comic and uplifting and also sensuous and passionate and excellently enacted. It's a fable, and yet it's inhabited with a core of emotional reality.Now, if they were to make a movie about my favorite candy, that sucker'd be called... CARAMEL.

Beware, you don't want to see this one without something sweet.Vianne(Binoche) and her daughter Anouke, travel with the North winds. On this new journey(in 1959), they land in a small town outside France that seems to be stuck in a time warp.""Tranquility"" , says the town mayer, is the ""motto"" of his small province. Vianne and her Chocolaterie, bright red shoes, sexy clothes, and illegitimate daughter are exactly what the mayor does not welcome into his quiet little town. Epecially, during Lent.Vianne still manages to stir up love and lust with her ancient chocolate formulas under the watchful eye of the Mayor. ""One bite and you are hooked"". Her time in the little moral town is interupted with wonderful characters and new friends. I loved Johnny Depp as the gypsy who lands his riverboat alongside the little town, only to cause distubances amongst the chuch-going frenzy of people. He and Juliet Binoche light up the screen and make a sexy match.The movie, although a dramatic one, has some outrageous funny moments as well.  Dame Judi Dench, one of my favorite actresses, plays the landlord of Vianne's Chocolaterie. Every word out of her mouth is sarcastic and somewhat ""dirty""(very reminiscent of her small coveted role in Branagh's ""Henry V""). I enjoyed her truthfulness and laughed along with her lines.It doesn't need to be Valentine's Day for someone to enjoy this delicious movie.

660832,A1W16LV46EQQUQ,B00005K3OT,Jean-Francois Virey,"[22, 37]","I would not have rented *Chocolat* and would not have bothered to review it if it had not become such a sensation in Objectivist circles, after philosopher Leonard Peikoff declared : This is the best movie I've seen in decades.As a former Objectivist who still sticks to a great deal of Rand's esthetic theory (if not much else), I was very curious to see this film, all the more so as Objectivist praise for movies is extremely rare and therefore tends to be quite reliable (I rather enjoyed early recommendations for instance, such as *Dangerous Beauty* and *October Sky*). Such enthusiastic praise from the highest Obejctivist authority - and a man who sells an 18-hour course on how to appreciate great drama- could only mean one thing : that *Chocolate* might reconcile me with an artform that gives me fewer and fewer memorable moments as years go by.However, I found very little to praise in this manipulative little film, which did not seem to me to have anything great even by Objectivist standards. For one thing, like many books adapted from novels, it makes extensive use of voice-over, something which Rand specifically condemned as the very negation of drama in film (for an illustration of this, I recommend Scorcese's *Wise Guys*, whose inept script is so drowned in voice-over that one feels the movie never even starts.)Of course, from an Objectivist point of view, *Chocolat* is good in that it has a theme (the opposition of catholicism and paganism) and is wholly integrated around it, down to its facile colour symbolism. But I suspect that what drew Peikoff's praise was not so much the dramatic skill evinced in the writing as the anti-catholic propaganda that infuses the whole film.To believe *Chocolat*, Catholicism is a religion led by an autocratic buffoon, whose ministers are well-meaning but deluded simpletons, and the believers in which are a host of miserable souls to whom the pleasures of the flesh are sadistically and morbidly denied in the name of a non-existent future life.The film dramatizes the conflict between this religion and its secular foe by showing us a small French village of the 1950s which seems to have been drained of all its colour by a stifling, frigid religious authoritarianism. Into this lost village come two red riding hoods, red as the devil, a mother and child, who choose to open a chocolate store right at the beginning of Lent, a season where Catholics undergo voluntary deprivation in order to learn to strengthen their resistance to temptation.Now the chocolates sold in this shop are no ordinary chocolates. Based on some forgotten, occult meso-American knowledge, they seem to combine all the effects of modern drugs, from Prozac to Viagra, bringing back life (i.e. mostly lust) to the mortified inhabitants of the village.Confronted to this wonder-working technology, the Church- a mere puppet of the state- is simply powerless, as evinced in the gluttonous explosion of the repressed mayor and the parish priest's futile attempts to reform an alcoholic, moronic wife-beater with the rote-learning of catechism and the empty ritual of confession.Of course the devil wins, the pleasures of the flesh (including extra-marital sex) are recognized as innocent, and the evil Catholic mayor redeems himself by joining the crusade of modern political correctness : the fight against exclusion.I will not deny *Chocolat* has a certain charm, but I think this is precisely part of its evil. I found it an insidious, snide attack on religion, via caricature and the use of strawmen, suggesting ultimately that the very effort to control one's impulses is the very source of debauchery and violence, and that he who lets himself be gently led into temptation will find his own balance and moderation- a popularized Freudianism that is belied by the modern pandemic of obesity and increasingly depraved pornography, to mention only two examples.As for the movie's depiction of life in a French village, as a Frenchman who has spent most of his holidays in one of them, I can say that it is almost as laughable as any attempt by Americans to capture things French. The nickname of the old-age pension itself, le Mortoir  is not even good French : we would say le Mouroir , and this is precisely how the French subtitles translated the term.I gave the movie two stars however, as I would reserve the lowest rating (one star) to films I could not finish (like for instance *Jefferson in Paris* or *The Gospel According to St Matthew*) and I think any film that has Carrie-Ann Moss in it deserves at least two stars (even that Mars movie, for no other reason.)",2,And lead us into temptation,1007251200,"12 2, 2001",2001,4619,"['would', 'not', 'have', 'rented',

660833,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,B00005K3OT,Jeremy Heilman,"[40, 79]","Chocolat is awful. Juliette Binoche stars in the film (which gives her next to nothing to do), which is sort of ""Where the Heart Is..."" meets ""The Full Monty."" It's a completely offensive liberal fantasy.  The basic plot is that a woman comes to a small town in 50's France, and through the power of her chocolate making, changes their outlook on lives.  The problem with this is that you need to share its viewpoint, which is that all of the townspeople are stupid &amp; blindly follow their way of life &amp; religion since they don't know any better.The film treats Catholicism as folly. I'm not Catholic, but I was still offended. It takes place during Lent. Binoche's character tempts all of the characters to break their Lenten vows with her chocolate, and this is seen as a good thing. She doesn't attend church &amp; seems to callously brush aside their views on religion. Basically her character's goal comes at the cost of the town's way of life, and we're expected to applaud that.  I just want to warn you that the film, while seemingly sweet, is incredibly subversive in the worst way. It manipulates the audience into accepting the offensive views it has, and then tries to beautify its ugly ideas with mood lighting.If you watch the film with any sort of rational mind at all, you can't help but be offended. I'm up for magic realism as much as the next person, but this film doesn't work at all. I didn't read the book, but the film is so flimsy. For example, it doesn't explain why the chocolates have the effects they do at all. There's one flashback in which Binoche explains the Indians believed cocoa beans make people lose all their inhibitions. That's well &amp; good, but I don't lose all inhibition when I eat a Hershey's bar. There is obviously something different about HER chocolate and the film does nothing to explain it.What I had a huge problem with though were its attitudes toward society. It's one of those movies that celebrates vagrants at the expense of people who are settled down in life, but then expects us to be happy when the main vagrants in the story all decide to settle down at the end. I don't mind that the film condemns the church &amp; the town's people so much as that it expects us to be happy when it betrays itself and decides these are good things.Also problematic is Judi Dench's character. She is presented as a fellow outcast from the town, but she is obviously influenced by what her daughter (the mayor's loyal assisstant) thinks of her.

660838,AZXUFTJVXJWL0,B00005K3OT,John Dynan,"[8, 13]","Whilst it promises to be a high-quality feel-good movie, ""Chocolat"" cannot escape the emotional and socio-political stereotypes which have become so common in current film making. Juliette Binoche plays a rather smug, ostracised single mother who arrives in a provincial French village and opens a cuter-than-cute, better-than-perfect chocolate shop. Her arrival is treated with great suspicion by the locals, particularly the church and the mayor but along the way she manages to establish a limited women-only clientelle. The arrival on the scene of Johnny Depp as the love-interest adds further fuel to the rather structured plot.The predictable and frequently turgid storyline is supported by flat and unspectacular performances, particularly Binoche, and a singular lack of chemistry between any of the characters. The overall characterisations are very polarised; all the men are against our heroine; all the women are for her. In even simpler terms, all the men are essentially evil except for Johnny Depp, whose token good-guy-in-bad-guy's-clothing character is no fault of his own. Depp and Judi Dench do their best with what they have but Depp, in particular, has almost nothing to work with because his character is so shallow.The underlying philosophical point of this film centering around a chocolate shop seems to be that ancient customs and beliefs were superior to modern ones and that indulgence in chocolate is the key to true happiness and enlightenment. It is very easy to be critical of recent attitudes; indeed it has become fashionable, but it does not mean that the ways of ancient civilizations (particularly superficial ones) were necessarilly superior to ours. In this aspect the film resolves nothing and as a viewer, I would prefer not to be lectured to.Overall, I found this film very disappointing and there are far better, less indulgent, feel-good films around. One could be excused for thinking that, with its killer cast, it would be much better than it is.

I'm happy to report that this film adaptation is even better than the print version. And how often can one say that with a straight face?The film begins with a north wind blowing Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) into a small French village at the very beginning of Lent, that pre-Easter period of time, which, in the Catholic liturgy, is dedicated to prayer and physical self-denial. It's not a good time for Vianne, an apparent non-Christian, to open up a chocolate shop across the town square from the church. But, she does so anyway, much to the dismay of the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Reynaud is puritanically determined to shut the shop down, and Vianne is equally determined to keep it open. An irresistible force meets an immovable object.CHOCOLAT, both the book and movie, is a whimsical comedy that blossoms as Lent progresses, and Vianne's shop becomes a place of healing and sanctuary for several of the town's troubled residents. Because Vianne's store is seen (by the local Church establishment) as diametrically opposed to the spirit of the season, the story can also be taken as a gentle fable of conflict between Christianity and paganism.Juliette Binoche is exquisite in her role. (I think I'm in love.) Judi Dench is her usual superb best as Armande, an aged widow deprived of her grandson's company by an over-protective mother, Armande's own daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss). There's also a small role played by Leslie Caron. (Where's she been in recent years?) And Alfred Molina is positively brilliant as the uptight mayor, so dominant that he personally writes the Sunday sermons to be delivered by the local pastor, Fr. Henri, apparently only recently ordained and much in fear of the Comte. Johnny Depp has an engaging role as one member of a band of despised river gypsies just floating through.One very good reason why CHOCOLAT the film is better than CHOCOLAT the book is the added dimension of visualization which the former imparts to several elements of the storyline, specifically the mysterious wind that blew our heroine into town, Anouk's pet Pantoufle, the delectable chocolates themselves (seductively arrayed in the shop window), and the climax of the conflict between Vianne and the Comte.CHOCOLAT the film is one that will have the audience leaving the theater feeling good, and maybe wishing for a cup of Vianne's hot chocolate with a pinch of cayenne pepper.

It represents anything that would bring pleasure to the human senses.  True, it unleashed passion &amp; sensuality among couples.  But it also signified something deeper than skin-deep gratification.  It also represented anything that would liberate the town folks from their fears, insecurities, loneliness &amp; prejudices --- whether it be directly or indirectly.Like chocolate, culture &amp; religion come in different forms...some are common &amp; widely accepted while others are a bit different &amp; stand out like a sore thumb.  But, also like chocolate, uniqueness adds to its beauty.So the next time you find yourself staring at a box of chocolate, do not judge its beauty simply by its shape or packaging.  Why don't you cut out on your prejudices, broaden your horizons, widen your options &amp; enjoy the experience of a mouth-watering treat.How about one of those melt-in-you-mouth-not-in-your-hand chocs?",4,Deliciously sinful --- eat in moderation :-),1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,1417,"['Even', 'back', '1950', 'quaint', 'old-fashioned', 'French', 'town', 'considered', 'chocolate', ""'indulgence"", 'No', 'were', 'not', 'concerned', 'possible', 'weight', 'gain', 'health', 'problems', 'brought', 'about', 'eating', 'excessive', 'amounts', 'chocolate', 'deemed', 'treat', 'temptation', 'amp', 'too', 'much', 'pleasure', 'eater', 'particularly', 'town', 'mayor', 'considered', 'grave', 'amp', 'sinful.As', 'viewer', 'would', 'deem', ""'chocolat"", 'something', 'intoxicating', 'amp', 'liberating', 'anything', 'would', 'bring', 'pleasure', 'human', 'senses', 'True', 'unleashed', 'passion', 'amp', 'sensuality', 'couples', 'also', 'signified', 'something', 'deeper', 'skin-deep', 'gratification', 'also', 'represented', 'anything', 'would', 'liberate', 'town', 'folks', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'loneliness', 'amp', 'prejudices', 'be', 'directly', 'indirectly.Like', 'chocolate', 'culture', 'amp', 'religion', 'come', 'different', 'forms', 'are', 'common', 'amp', 'widely', 'accepted', 'others', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'amp', 'stand', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'also', 'chocolate', 'uniqueness', 'beauty.So', 'next', 'time', 'find', 'staring', 'box', 'chocolate', 'do', 'not', 'judge', 'beauty', 'simply', 'shape', 'packaging', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'prejudices', 'broaden', 'horizons', 'widen', 'options', 'amp', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'mouth-watering', 'treat.How', 'one', 'melt-in-you-mouth-not-in-your-hand', 'chocs']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was far more than I had originally thought it would be.  This movie tells the story of a dull French town which has existed in a tradition of religious piety and colorless humility for centuries.  Only the arrival of Juliette Binoche who opens a chocolate shop can change the town.  Binoche is one of those actresses that seems to radiate an inner beauty in films.  Just watching her is a pleasant experience since she seems so lovely (and not just on a physical level).  At times the plot did seem somewhat predictable, but I fell in love with this movie anyway.  The setting was lovely and I thought that many of the actors were just perfect for their roles, particularly the child actors.  I will admit that the accents were sort of strange, you had real French actors with believable accents interacting with British and American random accents, plus Johnny Depp's Irish accent was a bit off target.  And the voice-overs were heavy-handed, seemingly to explain things in the movie that you'd have to be sleeping through the movie to not have understood.

A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever. Though the mayor has vowed to drive Vianne's business into the ground and run her out of town, Vianne hangs on, determined to stay until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town.

A Chocolate shop it was directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Shipping News, The Cider House Rules) who masterfully makes you, the audience, a part of this film. From the evil towns would be ""Mayor"" to the towns very own ""Mistress"" - it has something for everyone to talk about.This film is soft to the touch and has an incredible amount of humor in it. Including the concept that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. They play that to the hilt. Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hallow) plays the love interest who is the stranger from out of town who is also the bad boy. There is a woman in the story cleverly played by Judy Dench (Shakespeare In Love, Elizabeth, the 4 James Bond movies) who is old and doing everything she isn't supposed and teaches the lessons of life, love and enjoying yourself. It comes at a high price for her in the end.The story is fun energetic and it is photographed extremely well. It was a charm about it that makes you want chocolate but more, importantly, want to enjoy it to its fullest.

They come dressed in red, and soon open a chocolate shop across from the church on the first week of Lent.  Scenes of  townspeople in confession describing the delicious chocolates are meant to be titillating.  Chocolate treats from the new shop is described sensually with double-meaning, including sex and other sins of enjoyment.The mayor launches a campaign to get rid of the new chocolate shop that is causing so much excitement in this once sleepy little village.  Then the children see ""pirates"" along the river and Vianne's daughter runs to her mother announcing the landing of the swarthy crew.  It is a band of Irish river people and headed by a handsome Roux (Johnny Depp  - who plays pirates well).  The beautiful Vianne and the handsome Roux become romantic as they understand each other as outsiders and agents of change for all they touch.""Chocolat"" is a sweet movie, but trite in that  it suggests that all a person needs to liberate their soul, forget all the wrongs done to them, and become happy is a piece of candy.  There is a ""leave it to Beaver"" feel to the movie - too perfect, and the dialogue is often boring.  Judi Dench plays a role as a local diabetic who does not want to give in to her disease.  She keeps eating the sweets and enjoying life despite her critical condition.  I felt pain in all the actors trying to keep a French accent going - it did not come naturally for most in the film.Overall, enjoyable and more of a ""chick flick"" with a sweet chocolate shop princess and a swarthy pirate to bring it to a Disney ending.",3,Semi-Sweet,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,1672,"['religious', 'small', 'town', 'French', 'countryside', 'newcomers', 'Vianne', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'daughter', 'come', 'dressed', 'red', 'soon', 'open', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'church', 'first', 'week', 'Lent', 'Scenes', 'townspeople', 'confession', 'describing', 'delicious', 'chocolates', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'titillating', 'Chocolate', 'treats', 'new', 'shop', 'described', 'sensually', 'double-meaning', 'including', 'sex', 'other', 'sins', 'enjoyment.The', 'mayor', 'campaign', 'get', 'rid', 'new', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'causing', 'so', 'much', 'excitement', 'once', 'sleepy', 'little', 'village', 'Then', 'children', 'see', 'pirates', 'river', 'Vianne', 'daughter', 'mother', 'announcing', 'landing', 'swarthy', 'crew', 'band', 'Irish', 'river', 'people', 'headed', 'handsome', 'Roux', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'pirates', 'well', 'beautiful', 'Vianne', 'handsome', 'Roux', 'become', 'romantic', 'understand', 'other', 'outsiders', 'agents', 'change', 'touch', 'Chocolat', 'sweet', 'movie', 'trite', 'person', 'liberate', 'soul', 'forget', 'wrongs', 'done', 'become', 'happy', 'piece', 'candy', 'leave', 'Beaver', 'feel', 'movie', 'too', 'perfect', 'dialogue', 'often', 'boring', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'role', 'local', 'diabetic', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'disease', 'eating', 'sweets', 'enjoying', 'life', 'critical', 'condition', 'felt', 'pain', 'actors', 'trying', 'keep', 'French', 'accent', 'going', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'naturally', 'most', 'film.Overall', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'chick', 'flick', 'sweet', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'princess', 'swarthy', 'pirate', 'bring', 'Disney', 'ending']",N/A

However, I can't recommend this movie.  I actually found it irritating.  Here's why:This movie has an agenda; a message it is trying to promote.  The message is a basic humanist take on life; be tolerant and accepting of other people, sit around and chat over a cup of hot chocolate and leave the larger concerns alone... if you do this you'll be a good person.That message is not bad.  In fact, it's the underlying theme of a lot of literature.  The problem is that in Chocolat, it's so heavily pushed that it feels like watching a propaganda piece.  Over and over, the film tells you what to think and how to react.  It is as if the film were the very embodiment of its own antagonist, Reynaud... 'There is a right way to think and a wrong way to think.  See how we are showing you the right way?  This is the right way.  The other way is wrong.  Do you see how the other way is wrong?'In order to promote its agenda the film tears down other points of view.  Indulgence is better than discipline.  Drifters are kinder and more intelligent than parishioners.  The Catholic church is first made to look lost, then laughable, then evil.  All is set aright, however, when the village priest sets aside more traditional views and embraces the main idea of the film.Conveniently, the priest's new views are delivered in a concise sermon... and acutal sermon, caught on film so that we cannot possibly miss the message of the movie.The bottom line on this topic is that the film believes its message is more important than its story and it really shows.I also must admit that I found the characters to be very shallow.  All the main characters are either monotone or two-tone (my term for being initially opposed to the protagonist, then suddently changed to being on the side of the protagonist with no interviening struggle).  The protagonist is uninteresting (no inner conflict).  The Johnny Depp character is even more uninteresting (a drifter who is immediately accepted by and is accepting of the protagonist; he brings nothing to the story, except for being yet another outcast that is a good person and enjoys chocolate).  The only character that is at all interesting is the town Mayor, Reynaud.  But even the fine acting of Alfred Molina cannot save this film.The film is meant to be somewhat of a whimsical, mystical, fairy tale, so I can accept some lack of character depth or true conflict.  Because of this and for the film's beautiful setting, I'm not reducing it to 1 star, but I can't give it any more than 2.",2,Save the Preaching for Sunday,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,2641,"['movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'fine', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'beginnings', 'intersting', 'story', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'actually', 'found', 'irritating', 'Here', 'why', 'movie', 'agenda', 'message', 'trying', 'promote', 'message', 'basic', 'humanist', 'take', 'life', 'be', 'tolerant', 'accepting', 'other', 'people', 'sit', 'around', 'chat', 'cup', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'leave', 'larger', 'concerns', 'alone', 'do', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'person.That', 'message', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'underlying', 'theme', 'lot', 'literature', 'problem', 'Chocolat', 'so', 'heavily', 'pushed', 'watching', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'how', 'react', 'film', 'were', 'very', 'embodiment', 'own', 'antagonist', 'Reynaud', 'right', 'way', 'think', 'wrong', 'way', 'think', 'See', 'how', 'are', 'showing', 'right', 'way', 'right', 'way', 'other', 'way', 'wrong', 'Do', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'way', 'wrong', ""'In"", 'order', 'promote', 'agenda', 'film', 'tears', 'down', 'other', 'points', 'view', 'Indulgence', 'better', 'discipline', 'Drifters', 'are', 'kinder', 'more', 'intelligent', 'parishioners', 'Catholic', 'church', 'first', 'made', 'look', 'lost', 'then', 'laughable', 'then', 'evil', 'set', 'aright', 'however', 'when', 'village', 'priest', 'sets', 'aside', 'more', 'traditional', 'views', 'main', 'idea', 'film.Conveniently', 'priest', 'new', 'views', 'are', 'delivered', 'concise', 'sermon', 'acutal', 'sermon', 'caught', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'miss', 'message', 'movie.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'topic', 'film', 'message', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'really', 'also', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'very', 'shallow', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'monotone', 'two-tone', 'term', 'being', 'initially', 'opposed', 'protagonist', 'then', 'suddently', 'changed', 'being', 'side', 'protagonist', 'interviening', 'struggle', 'protagonist', 'uninteresting', 'inner', 'conflict', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'uninteresting', 'drifter', 'who', 'immediately', 'accepted', 'accepting', 'protagonist', 'nothing', 'story', 'being', 'yet', 'outcast', 'good', 'person', 'enjoys', 'chocolate', 'only', 'character', 'interesting', 'town', 'Mayor', 'Reynaud', 'even', 'fine', 'acting', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'film.The', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'somewhat', 'whimsical', 'mystical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'can', 'accept', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'true', 'conflict', 'film', 'beautiful', 'setting', ""'m"", 'not', 'reducing', '1', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', '2']",N/A

And if they forget their Christian values preached to them weekly in the stone cold church - the good Mayor is there to give the new young priest of 5 weeks (Hugh O'Connor) a helping hand with his sermons - and thereby get 'their' obedient flock back on the moral straight and narrow. Reynaud also waits patently and penitently for his wife to return from one of her interminable 'trips' - watched over his devoted secretary Caroline (the beautiful Carrie Anne Moss). But perhaps the hard-working and essentially decent Mayor (a fabulous turn by England's Alfred Molina) should just chill out and ""measure goodness by what we embrace"" - or maybe even recognize the lovely Caroline's devotion as genuine and worthy. But the Comte is too busy being pious and upright for the entire town - to engage in something that life-enhancing and delicious...Besides that's the least of his carnal worries - because a sly wind is blowing in from the North - bringing with it a voluptuous woman of independent-mind (Juliette Binoche) who is going to open a decadent nay sinful chocolate parlour in Lent - a time of abstinence, reflection and tranquillity. And when this shop ""Choclataire Maya"" opens - Mayor Reynaud knows deep down in his starched flannel trousers that it will seduce the town - especially the women. And the next thing you know - they'll be shagging their husbands senseless again - leaving the drunken abusive ones behind (Peter Stormare as Serge) - cavorting with travelling river people who play guitars and talk in odd Irish accents (Johnny Depp as Roux) and generally enjoying all manner of lurid sensory pleasure. ""It's important to now one's enemy..."" the Mayor muses ominously.Adapted from Joanne Harris' beloved novel by Robert Nelson Jacobs - Lasse Hallstrom's feature film (he also did ""The Cider House Rules"" - see separate review) garnished five Academy Award nominations - including one for Best Movie. And it's easy to see why. It has a magical and very visual story with fantastically strong parts for women. And it has chocolate - lots and lots of sweets, biscuits, cake and chocolate. You can get fat just looking at this film.The cast is varied and uniformly superb: French acting and dancing legend Leslie Caron is an elderly town lady admired and longed for by Monsieur Bierot (a lovely show by England's John Wood). There's Judy Dench in full-on spiky mode as the ballsy old biddy Armande (nominated for Supporting Actress - her dialogue titles this review) who rents out the former patisserie to Mademoiselle Vianne (Juliet Binoche in luminous form). Vianne's dreamy daughter Anouk (a delightful Victoire Thivisol) plays with an imaginary kangaroo - but is tired of wandering from town to town with her rootless mother - prone to leaving in an instant when the wind tells her to go.But as mum's culinary skills with South American cocoa and the dark evil liquid begins to affect the town folk in positive ways - especially a broken lady called Josephine (Lena Olin - who is Lasse Hallstrom's wife in real life) - the wandering Vianne senses that perhaps this hamlet is where her roots should be planted. In fact perhaps the town and its earnest but lost Mayor need her. And there's also the added enticement of that handsome rogue the Deppster to deal with - all gypsy and sexy shirts and dishevelled hair and good with her daughter. Easy to resist that...eh...Defaulted to Aspect ratio 1.78:1 - the BLU RAY picture fills the entire screen (no bars bottom or top) - but is a strange mixture of the ordinary and exceptional. I suspect in order to give the movie that slightly dreamy feel - there is a soft focus on a lot of it - and subtle grain is ever present. But there are also moments that are truly beautiful when you least expect it - down by the river at night, the feast to celebrate a 70th birthday in the garden, Alfred Molina trying to turn Serge into a gentleman in his home.

660898,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005K3OT,Matthew Gladney,"[0, 4]","'Chocolat' is like any other fable - it features a message, disguised in something which draws you near so that you can experience the message, and hopefully learn from it. The only problem here is, instead of the &quot;tempting&quot; thing (in this case chocolate) drawing us near and seducing us with its almost magical rejuvenation, we are hit over the head with the &quot;theme&quot; of the picture. But, then again, what exactly *is* the theme?The movie is set in a small French town in the 1950s. It appears to a quiet, almost idyllic little village, where everyone is polite to one another, and the streets are safe. There are, of course, a few not-so-nice things occuring, most notably an appalling wife-beater scenario, and many of the townspeople seem to be suffering from an over-abundance of child-like crushes, but do not have the nerve to act upon them. Apart from the wife-abuse aspect, I found myself enchanted with the village.But I was apparently in the wrong - at least, in the filmmaker's eyes I was.A woman and her daughter come to town. The woman, Caroline (played dryly by Juliette Binoche), sets up a chocolate shop, and it is apparent that her confections contain elements which release the desires within most people. Soon, the crushes become realized, and the abused woman leaves her husband, moving in with Caroline and her daughter. Comte de Reynaud, the head of the town (played well by Alfred Molina), soon becomes suspicious. About an hour into the movie, a river-traveling gypsy named Roux (characterized rather blandly by usually splendid Johnny Depp), arrives, and things go from bad to worse.I suppose the &quot;message&quot;, or &quot;theme&quot; of Chocolat, if indeed a message or theme can be discerned, is that you should live life to the fullest, don't hold back. Well, I don't disagree. What I found disturbing was that chocolate was used. The scenes where people were &quot;changed&quot; by its powers were odd, even evocative of being sinful. But nothing wrong went on. All these people did were to realize certain hopes and desires (and not bad ones). I guess what I'm getting at is: This is a French town not very many years after WWII. I'm sure it would *not* have been as repressed as it was, given what they went through with German occupation. None of that is touched upon here. Instead, we are led to believe that they are almost Eden-like, untouched by evil, and that only this traveling &quot;chocolate lady&quot; can save them. The transformation the townsfolk go through is supposed to be oh-so-big, but it really isn't. And I'm sure chocolate wouldn't have been necessary for it to occur.'Chocolat' isn't really a *bad&quot; movie. The acting, though a little uneven, is pretty fair, the locale pleasant, and the storyline sturdy. It is just the actual &quot;theme&quot; of the storyline which I disagree with. This film was nominated for a 2000 Academy Award for Best Picture. Like I said, it is a fair movie, but NOT worthy of a Best Picture nod.

660899,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005K3OT,Matthew Horner,"[4, 6]","The majority of reviewers liked Chocolat. Those who didn't generally felt it was too sentimental and improbable. It isn't cutting edge and isn't designed to appeal to people craving action and adventure, but it is to me a delightful fable, a kind of fairy tale for adults. I think it works on its intended level, which is that of a sweet, delicious confection. And it's cast includes Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin and Judy Dench, four actors who can do no wrong in my book.The time appears to be the 1950s, and the place is one of those quaint French villages you see on postcards and in posters. The town's mayor, Comte de Reynard [Alfred Molina], is from a family of pious and benevolent aristocrats who have ruled over the town for centuries. Life is quiet and orderly, and the center of activity and social life is the local Catholic church, where the young priest allows the mayor to edit his sermons for him. Everyone seems to believe that contentment equals happiness, but the truth is that the utter predictability of life there has led to utter dullness. One day a fierce north wind begins to blow and almost literally brings to the town Vianne [Binoche] and her young daughter. Vianne rents a dingy old shop from a bitter old woman called Armande [Dench]. She transforms it into an enchanted place full of the fabulous chocolates she makes. She doesn't attend church and has the nerve to open her shop in the midst of Lent, a time when all good Catholics deny themselves pleasure. The mayor is incensed and does all he can to close the place down, but, one by one, the residents discover that the chocolates are more than just delicious. They have magic powers to change lives for the better. This, of course, makes the mayor even angrier. Things get even worse [or better, depending on your point of view] when a group of river gypsies, led by Roux [Depp], land in town.The beautiful Binoche, who is French, is the perfect choice for Vianne. The worldly Dench and Olin fit right in. And what about Depp, who has done rather well for a high school dropout from Paducah, Kentucky? It may surprise you to know that he has lived in France for several years, and, so, if he seems right at home, it's because he is. Oddly, though, he uses an Irish accent here.The photography is excellent and uses deep, rich colors that are most appropriate for the story and the setting. Director Lasse Hallstrom's other recent films, The Cider House Rules and My Dog Skip, are among my favorites. His forte is movies in which characters and their stories are the dominant features.I say this is a movie for adults because the subtleties of its story will be lost on most children. As good as it is, it is not my favorite film about the magical powers of food and cooking.

The movie revolves around a mysterious woman, Vianne (Juliette Binoche), who arrives rather suddenly to a remote French village with her young daughter in tow. Vianne quickly settles in and establishes a chocolate shop, which instantly becomes the talk of the town. While certain people are intrigued by this fascinating woman and her sinfully sweet candies, other townspeople see Vianne as an immoral person who threatens the village's core principles and values. When a band of ""pirates"" (a.k.a.

Eventually Vianne is tempted to flee again in search of another new start, but this time she may have found something worth staying and fighting for.As I said, there are some major differences between the film and the novel.

The plot is a fairy tale with overtones of social commentary (but aren't all fairy tales trying to tell us something deeper?)and as in a fairy tale everything works out in the end. Hallstrom was lucky to get both Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp to play the leads because they add tons of charisma to this slight tale. It is always a pleasure to watch both of these actors because they make such varied and interesting choices in the roles they play. Compare Binoche in this film with her role in &quot;Damage&quot; for example or &quot;Blue.&quot; Or Depp in this or in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; or the recent &quot;Blow.&quot; These are two of the best actors living today and they give it their all.By doing so we, as the viewers, suspend our disbelief and follow the life of this film with little doubt. Lena Olin and Alfred Molina are standouts among the supporting cast.  If you can watch this movie without craving a box of chocolates or some hot chocolate you are a much better person than I.

He also elicits some marvelous performances from his talented cast:  Juliette Binoche as the mysterious chocolatier; Alfred Molina as the self righteous and lonely mayor; Carrie Anne Moss as a charming widow who carries a torch for Molina and a heavy hand in relations with her son and mother (Judi Dench in a cranky but touching performance); Hugh O'Conor as a young impressionable cleric; Lena Olin as the abused wife of cafe owner Peter Stormare.  Johnny Depp has a smaller role as the romantic interest for Binoche, but one figures any actor could have played the role and Depp's rich talents are underused.

Cantwell,"[16, 20]","My wife and I as well as another couple enjoyed this film immensely...Chocolat provides a wonderful insight into the life, strong conservatism and, yes, outright prejudices of the French citizens who live in such vividly picturesque towns and villages. They are not bad people but resist change of any kind and cling to their traditions. It is the price they pay to live in places that the average tourist loves to experience but only for a little while.The film was heightened by an unusually original and sensitive story but also superb casting, direction and acting.Juliette Binoche projected an almost ethereal tranquility in her quirky role as the mysterious woman who suddenly appears and opens a chocolate shop and feeds not only the physical but spiritual needs of the suspicious town people who are so realistically portrayed.Johnny Depp, who I believe is one of the most courageous and talented actors today, was outstanding as the Irish riverboat gypsy. He played his part with perfect understatement and acuity. He [almost] stole the show.Dame Judy Dench was, as always, excellent as the grandmother with her patented mix of tartness and sweetness, further perfected since her memorable portrayal of Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown.  The actor who played the very challenging role of the comte/mayor was powerful yet surely gained your sympathies over his own inner pain as the story progressed.And I thought the boy and girl who played the juvenile roles were both appealing, natural and just delightful. That is a tribute to a fine director.The young actor in the role of the curate was first rate.In short, this this a rarity today: a top-notch film for grown-ups that has a message, likable characters within a beautiful setting.

A lot I would posit when it comes to this movie.  Take for instance, this movie came out a few years after the hugely successful Alfonso Arau-directed, ""Like Water for Chocolate.""  Hollywood seemed to be in the habit of producing doubles at the time.  ""A Bug's Life"" was successful so someone produced ""Antz"", etcetera, etcetera.  The ""Like Water for Chocolate"" ""Chocolat"" seemed like another such mirror image conundrum, thus my movie-viewing family stayed away from this one.  That is until recently, and I must say, this is a different film and one on top of it that is wholly enjoyable.It tries a bit too hard to be foreign and although shot in an authentic French provincial village (apparently they actually have these dotted across the countryside of France) comes off as having an American tilt to it.  So, here is the other difficulty in the name.  If you talk about watching this movie to your friends or ask a video rental clerk for it, it's almost impossible to pronounce the name without coming across as an ""I only watch films instead of movies and if the film is foreign it instantly is raised in my esteem"" snobbery.  Try it.  Pronounce ""Chocolat"" to your dog sitting next to you now by your computer.  See, your nose instantly goes in the air, the corners of your mouth are down-turned in a pouty snootery, and the top of your head wiggles every so slightly side to side to indicate...there...I've just said something foreign making me somewhat better than you.  ""Chocolat.""  Take this piece of advice, since the film is slightly Americanized (how can you have Johnny Depp in it and not be?) go ahead and Americanize the title by calling it Chocolate.  If it was good enough for Hershey, by God, it can be good enough for you.  Besides, your dog and friends will respect you more for it.Back to the movie.  Juliette Binoche is somewhat miscast as a wanderer-drifter magical Chocolatier.  She is just too prim and proper coming off as a French Martha Stewart to be a true wizardress succumbing to the call of the North Wind at a whim and off like a pastry puff to the next town to weave her magic.  Judy Dench is...well Judy Dench, which is to say the lady is brilliant.  I could watch her act all day.

She opens up a seductive chocolate shop that shocks and infuriates the town mayor and most of the local residents. Obsessed with moderation, the mayor is determined on driving her and her Chocolate shop out of the town (which initially backfires). However, before his plans can take full effect, the stranger warms up the townspeople's cold spirits with smiles and the seemingly magic chocolate. She happily chips away the ice that surrounds the town until a handsome gypsy comes her way. This makes her think twice about her constant need to travel and resistance to belonging. It ends deliciously, and gives you a fabulous feeling.Chocolat is a dreamy and sweet movie that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. It was beautifully filmed, and the acting was fantastic. Juliette Binoche was charming and beautiful, and even though he had a fairly small role, Johnny Depp was gorgeous and sported awesome Irish accent. This movie is pretty funny at times too! I loved the priest (a young admirer of Elvis) and thought he was so cute - the mayor controlled him so far as to rewrite his sermons.The only thing I didn't really like in Chocolat was that it promoted sensuality. Sure, you should certainly enjoy life, and a little pleasure in chocolate won't hurt anyone, but moderation is not bad. According to the mayor, someone who fasts and pracitces intense moderation is better than a friendly, kind &quot;sinner&quot;. I don't agree with that.

Sad to say, but not many films concentrate on simple human emotions and characteristics.  &quot;Chocolat&quot; centers on a small French village and one travelling chocolate maker's (Juliette Binoche) quest to enliven the community and help the villagers abandon their conservative mores so they can appreciate the joys of life that are often ignored.  The movie is from the same crew that made &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; and as you've seen has been given universal critical acclaim.  The cast itself is full of superb actors and actresses, a real treat for anyone that appreciates quality acting.The DVD is not a disappointment and offers featurettes that take advantage of the movie's highlights.  For instance, there are two featurettes included with one covering the production design of &quot;Chocolat&quot; and the other detailing the costume design.  The DVD also contains a better than average documentary about the overall process of making the movie and a brief history of chocolate.  Along with a director's commentary, the DVD also has a menu for some of the many deleted scenes.  Also included are the usual DVD features: audio/subtitle setup and scene selection.  Another additional perk of the DVD extras are the film trailers included.  Most DVDs only contain trailers for the respective studio's big project films that are coming soon and/or the most notable films by the movie's director and stars.  &quot;Chocolat&quot; has a variety of lesser known but excellent films in its film trailer menu.A charming film that mixes fantasy with a dash of reality.

Through her genuine interest in people and irresistible chocolate concoctions, Vienne wins over her landlady (Judi Dench) and a battered housewife (Lena Olin).The real villain here is of course religious bigotry and the refusal to embrace diversity - represented by the Comte. He gets the town folk to shun Vienne and her shop and to even boycott immorality - in the form of riverboat pirate Roux (Johnny Depp). An act of vandalism is justified as an act of God. Very diabolical.As more people flock to the chocolate shop, including the Comte's secretary (Carrie Ann Moss), the Comte is overcome with rage and jealously and there's a very memorable scene where he gives in to temptation.

660939,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00005K3OT,Priscilla Stafford,"[2, 2]","The movie starts off in the winter of 1959, at the quiet and tranquil French village, where the inhabitants live there lives as quietly as possible. Until one day, driven by fate and a strange wind, Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her duaghter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) arrive in town. The villagers are rightly very curious about the strangers but when Vianne opens a chocolatier, the town's mayor (Alfred Molina) warns off the people against the 'evil'. But even when giving out warnings and instilling a fear for such temptations, the mayor cannot stop the villagers' attraction to not only the chocolatier but the outwardly friendly and irresistable Vianne. Vianne little by little shows the villagers what it means to not only enjoy life, but live it.&quot;Chocolate&quot; has gotten a total of 5 Oscar nominations: Best Picture (David Brown, Kit Golden, Leslie Holleran), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Juliette Binoche), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Judi Dench), Best Music Original Score (Rachel Portman), and Best Writing (Robert Nelson Jacobs).First off I must say that the acting done by such an all-star cast is superbly done. Notably Juliette Binoche, with her beauty and charming accnet, is vibrant in her role as the woman Vianne who can't help but be different from everyone else. Alfred Molina also handles his character with what seems like the greatest of ease. Sort of the bad guy in the movie, but can't help loving him by the end of the movie. There's Judi Dench as a elderly woman made an outcast by her own daughter (played by Carrie-Ann Moss you won't believe as the same Trinity we know and love!). There's also Lena Olin who acts out her character of a battered wife to perfection, Leslie Caron in a role you can hardly recognize, and the young priest played by Hugh O'Conor (there's one scene where he sings and dances to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; which is very cute!). And of course I mustn't forget Johnny Depp as Roux, the Irish gypsy who falls for Vianne. Unfortunately he had a very small role in the film but was an adorable match for Juliette Binoche. Of course he could have worked on his accent a bit since it comes and goes often.As for the movie itself, the plot is nothing too complicated or too original. In fact, some like me might find many similarities to the Disney movie &quot;Pollyana&quot;. There's an outcast who ultimately though reaches to each and everyone in the town. There's a kind of 'bad guy' who chooses what kind of sermons will be preached.The reason for my 3 stars is because I thought that besides the marvelous acting, the movie itself felt a bit slow and nothing remarkable. And most of all, whoever decided to categorize this movie as a romantic/comedy must have not really read the script. The romance is more like a subplot and &quot;Chocolat&quot; is more like a drama than a comedy. Sure, there are a few moments where you can chuckle or even laugh a bit. But no a laugh-out loud movie at all.So in conclustion, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is a sweet movie which flows along at an even pace. A film to watch when you have a few hours to spare where you don't have to concentrate that much. Oh, and a bit of trivia. Johnny Depp plays guitar in this movie in three scenes, and also does on one song on the soundtrack.",3,"A sweet film, no pun intended (wink!)",1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,3278,"['movie', 'winter', '1959', 'quiet', 'tranquil', 'French', 'village', 'where', 'inhabitants', 'live', 'there', 'as', 'quietly', 'possible', 'one', 'day', 'driven', 'fate', 'strange', 'wind', 'Vianne', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'duaghter', 'Anouk', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'arrive', 'town', 'villagers', 'are', 'rightly', 'very', 'curious', 'strangers', 'when', 'Vianne', 'chocolatier', 'town', 'mayor', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'people', ""'evil"", 'even', 'when', 'giving', 'out', 'warnings', 'instilling', 'fear', 'such', 'temptations', 'mayor', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'villagers', 'attraction', 'not', 'only', 'chocolatier', 'outwardly', 'friendly', 'irresistable', 'Vianne', 'Vianne', 'little', 'little', 'shows', 'villagers', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'enjoy', 'life', 'live', 'it.', 'quot', 'Chocolate', 'quot', 'gotten', 'total', '5', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Picture', 'David', 'Brown', 'Kit', 'Golden', 'Leslie', 'Holleran', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Best', 'Music', 'Original', 'Score', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Robert', 'Nelson', 'Jacobs', '.First', 'off', 'must', 'say', 'acting', 'done', 'such', 'all-star', 'cast', 'superbly', 'done', 'Notably', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'beauty', 'charming', 'accnet', 'vibrant', 'role', 'woman', 'Vianne', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'also', 'character', 'what', 'greatest', 'ease', 'Sort', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'loving', 'end', 'movie', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'elderly', 'woman', 'made', 'outcast', 'own', 'daughter', 'played', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'same', 'Trinity', 'know', 'love', 'also', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'who', 'out', 'character', 'battered', 'wife', 'perfection', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'role', 'can', 'hardly', 'recognize', 'young', 'priest', 'played', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'dances', 'quot', 'Hound', 'Dog', 'quot', 'very', 'cute', 'course', 'must', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Roux', 'Irish', 'gypsy', 'who', 'Vianne', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'adorable', 'match', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'course', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'accent', 'bit', 'often.As', 'movie', 'plot', 'nothing', 'too', 'complicated', 'too', 'original', 'fact', 'might', 'find', 'many', 'similarities', 'Disney', 'movie', 'quot', 'Pollyana', 'quot', 'outcast', 'who', 'ultimately', 'reaches', 'everyone', 'town', 'kind', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'who', 'what', 'kind', 'sermons', 'will', 'be', 'preached.The', 'reason', '3', 'stars', 'thought', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'movie', 'felt', 'bit', 'slow', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'most', 'whoever', 'decided', 'categorize', 'movie', 'romantic/comedy', 'must', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'read', 'script', 'romance', 'more', 'subplot', 'quot', 'Chocolat', 'quot', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'chuckle', 'even', 'bit', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'movie', 'all.So', 'conclustion', 'quot', 'Chocolat', 'quot', 'sweet', 'movie', 'along', 'even', 'pace', 'film', 'watch', 'when', 'have', 'few', 'hours', 'spare', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'concentrate', 'much', 'Oh', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'guitar', 'movie', 'three', 'scenes', 'also', 'one', 'song', 'soundtrack']",N/A

As they say, ""take the good and leave the rest.""The ""good"" -- the lovely scenery and the cast.  Juliette Binoche is a charming actress who has made magic in other films; here...not so much.  Maybe it was the way the character was written but I found myself almost disliking her by the end of the film.  Judi Dench is always wonderful and here she does the best she can with a hopeless character.  Alfred Molina brings a one-dimensional character to life and deserves high marks for his performance. The child actress who plays Binoche's daughter is beautiful and successfully avoids being overly cute.  Lena Olin is ok as the abused wife who brightens up when helped by Binoche.  Johnny Depp has a small part, which is a shame since he steals every scene in which he appears.  He underplays his part beautifully which adds to his immense charm.  I liked his faint Irish accent, too.  It was lovely to see the beautiful Leslie Caron in a very small role.From reading other reviews I get the idea that the novel from which the book is taken is presented more as a fairy tale than a realistic story.  I can see how that would work very well.  If the director had stuck to that idea the story would have gone down better. (no pun intended).  The opening scene with the two women blowing in on a ""sly wind from the North"" dressed in red woolen capes is very charming.The problem is that the film is presented as real life, and that's where it begins to offend.  Instead of archetypes, we get stereotypes....the repressed, religious people of the town are all really nasty and hateful, whereas the free thinkers are the generous spirited ones with hearts of gold.  And chocolate heals all.  Several other reviewers have written some excellent critiques of this presentation and I recommend them.The treatment of the Judi Dench character is another huge mistake.  She is diabetic but chooses to celebrate her birthday by indulging in sweets, which results in her death.  I guess we're supposed to think this is really ""gutsy"" and ""charming"" but it didn't sit well with me.  I could pick at other details which illustrate the mistaken ""morality"" of this sorry story, but I'll let anyone interested read some of the one and two star reviews.Still, it's France and there is an attempt in the end to resolve the town differences.

Although not an action film, the story was more inviting than first impressions would present. The acting is good, especially by Juliette Binoche (when will she make more American movies?) and Johnny Depp (who appears much less often than I thought he would). The supporting roles are well-acted also.

The scenes literally drip with smooth liquid pleasure as chocolate is melted and then formed into creations of desire.Pleasures that await and a temptress who enchants an entire village with the call of chocolate melting slowly in your mouth is the theme around which this story is molded. There are moments of humor, an almost wild wind that calls to Vianne to follow her gypsy spirit and a handsome rover who challenges her sorcery.While the religious villagers show an outward piety, in their hearts they want to abandon themselves to temptation and happiness. Vianne arrives in the tranquil French town and in her own way changes the future. There are various ideas that are in a way, just a fantasy for some and for others may be a reality.Issues like having a child out of wedlock, leaving your husband and not going to church are portrayed in a ""you choose the way to live"" light. Morality is frowned on and this film makes no promises to those who don't want to just escape for 122 minutes. I found the religious aspects to be almost a comedy...which is not always a good thing, since those that don't see religion in a good light won't find it any more appealing. It also shed a light on the sometimes misinterpretation of how we are to live this life. Love is essential. There is a balance between pleasure and godliness. Somewhere in the middle you can find peace and happiness.In the style of a story, adult desires are captured and woven into a tale of pure pleasure. Anything that happens, does so only in your mind. Captivating from beginning to end. As a chocolate lover, I have always known that chocolate holds powers, no other food has. Chocolate brownies anyone. ;>The appeal of the story comes from those pleasures we want to succumb to. With this movie, you can have all the fantasy and none of the guilt.

660946,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005K3OT,Reviewer,"[13, 16]","A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, ""Chocolat,"" directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid `50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test.  As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch.  What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit.  Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people.  Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the ""sweetest"" film of the year, as well as one of the best, ""Chocolat"" is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.",5,The Sweet Mysteries Of Life,980985600,"02 1, 2001",2001,3507,"['film', 'awaken', 'senses', 'stimulate', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'Chocolat', 'directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'starring', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'sensuous', 'sensational', 'delight', 'mid', '50s', 'borne', 'winds', 'fate', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'small', 'town', 'France', 'young', 'daughter', 'Anouk', 'Victoire', 'Thivisol', 'tow', 'special', 'talent', 'soon', 'townsfolk', 'quite', 'stir', 'Binoche', 'Vianne', 'Rocher', 'woman', 'who', 'exotic', 'recipe', 'chocolate', 'unlock', 'repressed', 'sensibilities', 'predominately', 'Catholic', 'citizenry', 'heretofore', 'kept', 'rigid', 'righteous', 'thumb', 'Mayor', 'Comte', 'de', 'Reynaud', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'respite', 'help', 'even', 'town', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'priest', 'Pere', 'Henri', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'Vianne', 'audacity', 'open', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'Lent', 'when', 'course', 'sumptuous', 'treats', 'are', 'forbidden', 'quickly', 'afoul', 'Mayor', 'battle', 'wills', 'two', 'ensues', 'chocolates', 'are', 'irresistible', 'Mayor', 'tradition', 'religion', 'side', 'free-spirited', 'Vianne', 'who', 'something', 'gypsy', 'test', 'director', 'Hallstrom', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'out', 'best', 'story', 'offer', 'say', 'quite', 'bit', 'affecting', 'funny', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'emotionally', 'characters', 'Hallstrom', 'what', 'buttons', 'push', 'when', 'splendidly', 'touch', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Vianne', 'sensitivity', 'story', 'Hallstrom', 'never', 'become', 'maudlin', 'successfully', 'integrity', 'drama', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'evoke', 'almost', 'dream-like', 'sense', 'pacification', 'draw', 'indulge', 'mouth', 'watering', 'visual', 'pleasures', 'chocolate', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'tough', 'one', 'diabetics', 'watch', 'What', 'Hallstrom', 'also', 'going', 'one', 'absolutely', 'exquisite', 'cast', 'many', 'whom', 'give', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'memorable', 'performances', 'beginning', 'superb', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'earthy', 'enigmatic', 'classic', 'sense', 'beauty', 'make', 'presence', 'screen', 'captivating', 'simply', 'joy', 'behold', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Amande', 'meanwhile', 'terrific', 'character', 'turn', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Caroline', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'embarrassment', 'bad', 'influence', 'son', 'Luc', 'Aurelien', 'Parent-Koening', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Josephine', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'unhappy', 'woman', 'who', 'hope', 'Vianne', 'undaunted', 'spirit', 'Three', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'gifted', 'actresses', 'should', 'be', 'recognized', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Molina', 'too', 'narrow', 'minded', 'Comte', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Roux', 'charm', 'leader', 'roving', 'community', 'river', 'people', 'Rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'John', 'Wood', 'Guillaume', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Serge', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'Madame', 'Audel', 'Possibly', 'sweetest', 'film', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'best', 'Chocolat', 'visual', 'emotional', 'triumph', 'will', 'warm', 'heart', 'make', 'taste', 'buds', 'salivate', 'story', 'characters', 'rich', 'satisfying', 'candy', 'embrace', 'film', 'human', 'touch', 'images', 'sensitivity', 'will', 'remain', 'long', 'screen', 'gone', 'dark', 'uplifting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'answers', 'mysteries', 'life', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'box', 'chocolates']",N/A

Is it even worth the time generations of philosophers and thinkers have devoted to the subject? Lasse H&auml;llstrom makes a beautiful  cinematic fable out of this endless human dilemma in ""Chocolat"". A wonderful, moving (and surprisingly fun) movie to watch. Not only it features a great and magnificently-ensembled multinational cast which includes Johnny Depp, Carrie-Ann Moss, Lena Olin and even divine Judi Dench. It is the subtle, heart-felt approach the director manages to convey to such a deep and thick story line. It makes us think and reflect on how Humanity deals with changes and innovation as opposed to rigidness and prejudice-filled attitudes within the often stiff and unmovable boundaries of wrongfully implemented morality schemes. Vianne Rocher (beautifully portrayed by Juliette Binoche) is a sort of  magic-embedded ""Mary-Poppins"" with exotic roots, who travels along towns establishing impromptu chocolat stores, along with her young daughter Anouk. This time the cool northern wind brings her to the little French villa of Lansquenet, where life appears to have not changed a bit in a hundred years. She opens a chocolate store much to the dismay of the self-procclaimed town's moral police (Count de Renaud, played by Alfred Molina). But rather than challenging the rigid and linear morality parameters in town by way of sensuous and forbidden pleasures, Vianne and her tiny little chocolate place in reality will slowly (but fiercely) establish a much needed paradise of simple and plain tolerance for the villagers. She will start winning the town over not only with her magic recipes for the most delicious chocolate treats, but also with her honest and sincere ways for dealing with the everydays of human nature and understanding of real people. This movie is just a treat. Indulge yourself in some rich chocolate.

This unassuming and delightful film is a lovingly layered morality tale that unfolds in unexpected ways, never preachy, always entertaining. Few viewers will walk away from this film without feeling at least a little bit better about their lives. A repressionist mindset that seeks little more in life than a numbing stability and a daring gypsy soul embodied in Vianne (Juliette Binoche) who breezes into town and would deny such predictability are co-mingled in a charming French village in the late 1950's. Vianne prepares for her epic contest with conventionality with an irresistable weapon of choice. She opens up a chocolate shop.  As Vianne offers a sympathetic ear along with her magical confections, the suspicious villagers one by one begin to shake off a lethargy that has stifled their mundane lives. Of course the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is understandably unnerved by this threat to good public order. He is a decent man with honorable intentions but holds to an unrealistic standard of perfection no one could possibly live up to. The battle of wills comes to a head with the unwelcomed arrival of the river people led by Roux (Johnny Depp). An instant attraction that arcs between the nomadic spirit shared of Vianne and Roux complicates things in unexpected ways, and Vianne discovers that she too, is possessed of feelings of vulnerability that are to be dealt with or denied. All of the actors in this beautifully photographed story deliver a polished performance. Judi Dench as always, is terrific. Johnny Depp's work in this film has once again demonstrated a remarkable talent and in my opinion is under-appreciated as one of our finest young actors.  This is a wonderfully crafted film, given to voice-over narrative that at times, give it a story book feel.

Considering its relatively simple plot, that's just a bit 2 long for me! :)CHOCOLAT (2000) is, however, a well-filmed and well-acted story of a young Gypsy-ish French woman named Vianne (wonderfully played by the wonderful Juliette Binoche) and her ten-year-old-ish daughter who breeze (literally) into this small, old-fashioned--and traditionally Catholic--French town and proceed to cause a major stir in the values--and the loins--of many, by opening up a decadent--and mysterious--Chocolatier right in the middle of the solemn period of Lent.  This will not do, according to the town mayor (played by veteran British actor Alfred Molina), and an over-protective mother (believably played by Carrie-Ann Moss of THE MATRIX) who scorns her own mother (played by the always-wonderful Dame Judi Dench), whom she considers an infidel--so much so that she won't let her mother anywhere near her own grandson.So, things basically progress from here [SPOILER ALERT]: Vianne quickly becomes known for her ability to prescribe the 'right' kind of chocolate for each customer as a cure for his/her societal 'ills'. Eventually she comes to 'cure' the entire town, whilst finding true love for herself in the form of Johnny Depp, as an Irish ""river rat."" The End. :)Juliette Binoche is glowing throughout, and was deservedly nominated for Best Actress. She makes you believe in her character as someone who possesses special powers to discern what is lurking deeply in people's hearts (I know, that kind of sounded like THE SHADOW, didn't it?). Judi Dench is virtually unrecognizable in her role of an old free-spirit who's lived most of her life in the town as a shunned figure; she was deservedly nominated for Best Supporting Actress.However, the film is ponderously directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who directed the similarly slow, but superior, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999). This style itself wouldn't have been much of a problem here if the ending weren't so obvious from about the halfway point. As a result, it does become a bit boring.  The two best things about CHOCOLAT are: 1) The subtle acting performances from Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, and even hulking Peter Stormare (remember him as the strong, silent kidnapper in FARGO?); and 2) The delicious scenes of chocolate-making, which made me really wishing I had some of those wonderful confections.Bottom line: Decent film, a bit too long, very well-acted, will make you crave chocolate--bad!!!

660959,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005K3OT,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","""Chocolat"" is a winsome fable, more notable, perhaps, for its mood and atmosphere than for its rather hackneyed plotting and timeworn theme.  It's true that many viewers may be put off at first by what would appear to be the anti-Christian (particularly anti-Catholic) subtext that seems to run through the story.  But, rest assured, the film ends up not attacking religion - merely redefining its terms.The lovely and radiant Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne, a young unwed mother, who, with her charming daughter, enters a small, morally uptight French village in 1959.  There, much to the dismay of the rigid and intolerant Roman Catholic mayor, she sets up a chocolateri, during Lent of all times, and proceeds to dispense confections that (as in ""Like Water For Chocolate"") seem to exert a magical influence on the villagers who partake of them.  The chocolate is, of course, a muted metaphor for the eternal conflict that has been waged throughout history between those who view sensual pleasures as ""sins"" and those who see them as natural and morally neutral human desires.  The film certainly comes out foursquare in favor of the latter view, showing the dangers that can result when people become obsessed with repressing their basic human needs and end up isolating those who believe, think or live differently.  Vianne, and those who rally to her cause, are viewed as warm and loving free spirits, placed in stark contrast to the mayor and his minions who appear as crabbed, morose and intolerant cretins.But ""Chocolat"" is less impressive for the story it tells than for the magical mood it weaves thanks to its charming setting, its spirit of sly fun and, above all, the radiance of Binoche, who demonstrates once again that she was truly made for the camera.  Despite the rather bizarre clash of accents that results, the film utilizes a vast international cast that includes American Johnny Depp, British Judi Dench, and French Leslie Caron.Like many of the rural French comedies on which it appears to be patterning itself, ""Chocolat"" seems, at times, as artificial and lightweight as the truffles it features.  Yet, even though its message is not exactly original and radical, in this day and age when many religions seem to measure their closeness to God based on how many rules they can make for us to follow and how many groups of people they can manage to keep on the outside, it is nice to be reminded that the purpose of religion is to gather people together into a circle of common humanity.  And what better meeting ground than the one truly universal desire we all do share:  our unabashed and undying love for chocolate?",3,a trifle - but a nice one,997228800,"08 8, 2001",2001,2647,"['Chocolat', 'winsome', 'fable', 'more', 'notable', 'perhaps', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'rather', 'hackneyed', 'plotting', 'timeworn', 'theme', 'true', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'first', 'what', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'anti-Christian', 'particularly', 'anti-Catholic', 'subtext', 'run', 'story', 'rest', 'assured', 'film', 'up', 'not', 'attacking', 'religion', 'merely', 'redefining', 'terms.The', 'lovely', 'radiant', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Vianne', 'young', 'unwed', 'mother', 'who', 'charming', 'daughter', 'small', 'morally', 'uptight', 'French', 'village', '1959', 'much', 'dismay', 'rigid', 'intolerant', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'mayor', 'up', 'chocolateri', 'Lent', 'times', 'proceeds', 'dispense', 'confections', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'seem', 'exert', 'magical', 'influence', 'villagers', 'who', 'partake', 'chocolate', 'course', 'muted', 'metaphor', 'eternal', 'conflict', 'been', 'waged', 'history', 'who', 'view', 'sensual', 'pleasures', 'sins', 'who', 'see', 'natural', 'morally', 'neutral', 'human', 'desires', 'film', 'certainly', 'out', 'foursquare', 'favor', 'latter', 'view', 'showing', 'dangers', 'can', 'result', 'when', 'people', 'become', 'obsessed', 'repressing', 'basic', 'human', 'needs', 'end', 'up', 'isolating', 'who', 'believe', 'think', 'live', 'differently', 'Vianne', 'who', 'rally', 'cause', 'are', 'viewed', 'warm', 'loving', 'free', 'spirits', 'placed', 'stark', 'contrast', 'mayor', 'minions', 'who', 'appear', 'crabbed', 'morose', 'intolerant', 'cretins.But', 'Chocolat', 'less', 'impressive', 'story', 'magical', 'mood', 'thanks', 'charming', 'setting', 'spirit', 'sly', 'fun', 'radiance', 'Binoche', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'truly', 'made', 'camera', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'clash', 'accents', 'results', 'film', 'vast', 'international', 'cast', 'American', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'British', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'French', 'Leslie', 'Caron.Like', 'many', 'rural', 'French', 'comedies', 'be', 'patterning', 'Chocolat', 'times', 'artificial', 'lightweight', 'truffles', 'even', 'message', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'radical', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'many', 'religions', 'seem', 'measure', 'closeness', 'God', 'based', 'how', 'many', 'rules', 'can', 'make', 'follow', 'how', 'many', 'groups', 'people', 'can', 'manage', 'keep', 'outside', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'purpose', 'religion', 'gather', 'people', 'together', 'circle', 'common', 'humanity', 'what', 'better', 'meeting', 'ground', 'one', 'truly', 'universal', 'desire', 'do', 'share', 'unabashed', 'undying', 'love', 'chocolate']",N/A

I love sweet, charming, affectionate movies that observe human nature through humorous and insightful lenses.  I saw just such a movie last year.  It was called ""Almost Famous.""If you haven't seen that particular title yet, you may have to after watching ""Chocolat;"" I can't think of a more appropriate way to wash out that synthetic aftertaste.  Movies like ""Chocolat"" aren't written or directed--they're engineered.Perhaps the finest chocolate requires an exact recipe, but provocative and entertaining cinema doesn't.  Just the opposite, really--great filmmaking resists formula.  But this inconsequential fluff piece, which imagines an insular French community where the transforming power of chocolate is enough to provoke life-changing epiphanies, is so blandly predictable, so precisely calculated to make you feel warm and fuzzy, that you almost wish--no, beg--for something unexpected and off-the-wall to happen.What makes ""Chocolat"" so easily digestible--and what led the Academy to idiotically award the film five undeserved Oscar nominations, aside from Miramax's relentlessly tacky advertising campaign--is the undeniable skill and craftsmanship in front of and behind the camera.  When you've got a director as respected as Lass Hallstrom and A-list talent like Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench, you can be sure it's all going to go down smoothly.  Gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous shots of melting chocolate certainly don't hurt.But when these ingredients are at the disposal of a script that relies so frustratingly on age-old conventions, a script that obliviously trots out the most pedestrian characters--and from the self-righteous mayor and the battered wife to the innocent boy with the domineering mother, they're all here--you have to wonder what the point of assembling all this talent is.  Binoche does absolutely nothing in this film to warrant her best actress nomination--nothing, perhaps, except to remind you that a long time ago she actually took on challenging roles.  Ditto Dench, who is such a towering performer that she shouldn't even be looking down her nose at a film like this.The fact that ""Chocolat"" paid off so handsomely for Miramax is disheartening indeed--not only because it cheated far superior movies of their just desserts, but because of the unavoidable suggestion that this film actually says something important.  It doesn't.  What it does, in fact, is indulge a message of staggering phoniness and simplicity.  ""Tolerance"" is the operative word in ""Chocolat's"" artificial little fairy-tale universe--embrace everyone and everything, toss out the narrow-minded regulations and principles that once held you captive, and oh, have a Belgian creme while you're at it because chocolate is the key to unlocking the deepest mysteries of human nature.

660961,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005K3OT,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 7]","Though after watching the film, you may get a hankering that not even Mssrs Hershey and Nestle can help.  Set in a picture-perfect French provincial town in 1959, &quot;Chocalat&quot; poses ossified eurocentric traditions against even older, though more liberating pagan traditions enshrined in the recipe book for chocalate.  The nominal leader of the town, the Count de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is also the nominal villain and the personification of those euro values.  Making sure the town attends church every Sunday en masse, the Count writes the sermons for the town's seemingly teengae Priest and chooses which pleasing form is to be the designated evil of the week.  Trying to balance things out, the narrator assures us that the count rules by example, working intolerable hours, writing editorials in local papers, abstaining during lent and nursing in pious silence the ache of his missing Countess.  Worse than pious, however, the Count also represents all that is unimaginative, and when he reminds us that he is superior to the Count of Monte Cristo because he is not a work of fiction, the die is set.  His subtle and craven innuendos against the owner of the new Chocalatiere, the mysteriously exotic Vien (Juliette Binoche) are redundant when his stalwart traditionalism so effectively marks him as the evil vanilla in a sea of liberating chocalate.The lushly pagan Vien, a descendant of Mayans, knows how to fashion a cure for anything out of chocalate.  As in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; the reasons for her underlying indifference to the established religion isn't as important to the fact of her indifference.  (Remember those stuffy traditionalist trustees for Dr. Larch's orphanage - how we're supposed to distrust them the moment they appear).  Setting up shop, she opens a fantastic Chocalatiere with a display window so lush in chocalate, that it threatens to morph the town from a french provincial town to the sort of mock-up of one that you'd see in Disney's EPCOT.  Handing out free samples of just about anything, and boasting of the power to find, for each customer, their personal favorite choclate. The Joke is that the townspeople, so long cloistered and fettered, have never had any of the life affirming sweets, let alone cultivatred a favorite.  Not quite winning her way into their hearts, Vien redeems a wife battered by her husband and her past (her father collaborated with the Germans) into kleptomania, an aging widower (John Wood) himself pining for a war widow (the war being World War I), a drifter with no sense of home (Johnny Depp - is there anyhting Depp can't do?), a crabby landlady (Judi Dench) facing a crabby death without her grandson, and other townspeople beaten into routine by the righteous Count.With its picturesque locale and engaging story, &quot;Chocalat&quot; wins out over the prechy moralism of the script which is basically summed up as &quot;be human and enjoy it&quot; (the film culminates in an Easter sermon in which the boyish priest, writing without the Count's control for once, admonishes the town to think, not of the risen Christ, but Christ the man).  It's the routines of traditionlaism, the film implies, that prevent this.

She slowly wins over the women of the town by providing the perfect ingredient--chocolate--to ignite the fires within.

But I guess I was rather pleased with Chocolat, the execution is fine.Juliette Binoche sparkles as usual. Johnny Depp's Irish accent is passably credible. Their chemistry is good, specially in a scene where Juliette swims to protect her daughter. Problem is that once Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village (which btw is merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette), everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable.A wide array of chocolate in all shapes and contours comes to the rescue though, adding a splendid flavor to the screen. But don't bother to ask how such a reclusive, middle-of-nowhere village gets all that cocoa.The subdued religious angle is a bit moronic, it makes organized religion look like a kindergarten tiff. Just because Binoche's character is &quot;different&quot; no one takes easily to her and every kid in town feels comfortable taunting her child at school. What precise religion was this?The final scene with a whole village prancing about at Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal to the hilt. So is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy it may have been in itself. Come to think, we could probably have done without the gypsy stuff altogether.Anyway, the film is woth seeing if you know what you're getting into and are expecting pseudo-charming fluff.

There actually is violence here with the lunatic drunk almost strangling the chocolatier, and the short sex scene when this charming bohemian lady tells her daughter of grandad's escapades in Central America.

Their battle for influence over the town turns vicious when Vianne befriends a pack of pirate-like ""river rats"" who show up in the village prompting the priest to call Vianne ""Satan's helper"" in a homily Molina's character wrote.`Chocolat' is built largely on subplots and metaphors, but unlike most similar movies, is somehow pleasantly simple, which you begin to understand is the idea.The concept is sweet but greatly dependant on good performances by superb actors, which is has thanks to Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp and Judi Dench.To me, `Chocolat' was like a relaxing ride down a slow-moving river. However, while I was perfectly content to lust after the leading man, wish I lived in France and plan to buy a box of chocolate as soon as the credits started rolling, it surprised me that anyone else agreed.It seemed to me that `Chocolat' would lack something as far as critics were concerned, and I was confused when it was nominated for five Academy Awards.As you can see, I loved the film.

However, perhaps Depp's recent performances have drawn attention to it.  After watching him in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" I realized that he might be one of the best young actors in our time.  I mean he can really act like different people...not just take type-cast rolls.  And so I wanted to see his work here.What I found was a blatant skewing of a storyline to engage people while communicating a specific message.  While most intelligent books & movies now try to show how multi-dimensional everyone is...how difficult it is to simply cast someone as ""good"" or ""bad""...this movie does the reverse.  As characters are introduced, you are quickly able to assign them to one of 2 camps: good enlighted folks or bad religious uptight folks.  (There's also one bad drunken guy who is taken in by the bad religious folks for their own agenda.)What unfolds, then, is not a film about the transformation of human nature or the triumph of hero in a realistic set of circumstances.  Rather, you have an ""unlikely"" heroine cast in a role where she's bound to succeed in proving how good she ultimately is.  (She has all good people on her side, of course).  This mysterious woman who works on Sunday & has an illegitmate daughter basically acts as the religious figure of the movie.  She heals the sick, protects the vulnerable, brings together the lonely and even, yes, loves her enemies.  The bad people are eventually either ""converted"" to her side or made to look absolutely ridiculous.  They are degraded and dismissed.Depp's character makes an interesting entrance towards the end of this movie.  As usual, I think he played his role well.  He plays the intelligent, intriguing, competent gypsy he's supposed to be.  I like his character, but I wished there was more of him.In the end, I had very mixed feelings about the film.  I felt that the artsy people behind the film (not necessarily the author of the original book) were using this film to express their own internal emotions.  It was like they poured themselves into this heroine and tried to make you understand how good & sincere they are - despite their unconventional lifestyles.And it is engaging.  I legitimately liked the heroine & hoped she would succeed.

It's a simple fable about a nomad (Juliette Binoche) who settles in an ultraconservative French town and opens up a chocotat store--smack dab in the middle of Lent. The town's Mayor, pastor, and many of its residents are none too pleased with this lady, who doesn't share their Catholic beliefs. The film goes on to stress the importance of tolerance, but the movie is so handsomely produced that you forget how simplistic this story really is. Nevertheless, it's a well-assembled DVD package with decent picture and sound as well as a nice featurette that includes the cast and crew members.

But they always leave their mark on each town using their ancient, exotic chocolates.  It's not a rip-roaring comedy, nor an intense drama.  Chocolat is just out there; it has no political message, or hidden meaning.  It's just a nice story brought to life by great acting on the parts of Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and a cast of other loveable characters.  The filming location is in a tiny village in France, which provides an excellent, atmospheric backdrop to the plot of the story.  The film also contains perhaps the best original score written for a movie in 2000.

The chocolate becomes its own character managing to magically cure all of the towns ills if they allow it to work its sweet way into their deepest desires.A sweetly sinful indulgence indeed!!",5,Lovely and Enchanting,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,1198,"['quot', 'Chocolat', 'quot', 'movie', 'based', 'Joanne', 'Harris', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'recommend', 'experiencing', 'both.This', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'alot', 'work', 'having', 'been', 'done', 'perfect', 'scenery', 'so', 'viewer', 'transported', 'quaint', 'little', 'French', 'Town', 'musical', 'score', 'upbeat', 'passionate', 'special', 'dimension', 'film.Johnny', 'Depp', 'excellent', 'job', 'gypsy', 'drifter', 'greeted', 'reserve', 'prejudice', 'uptight', 'townspeople', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'single', 'woman', 'child', 'who', 'town', 'wind', 'stiches', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'prey', 'overly', 'religious', 'mayor', 'town', 'others', 'sin', 'lent', 'have', 'say', 'favorite', 'character', 'played', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'free', 'spirit', 'town', 'refusing', 'years', 'be', 'programmed', 'rest', 'world', 'delicious', 'chocolate', 'being', 'diabetic', 'scolded', 'doctors', 'own', 'daughter', 'chocolate', 'own', 'character', 'managing', 'magically', 'cure', 'towns', 'ills', 'allow', 'work', 'sweet', 'way', 'deepest', 'desires.A', 'sweetly', 'sinful', 'indulgence', 'indeed']",N/A

661015,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00005K3OT,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[0, 0]","Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) glows as Vianne Rocher, a free-spirited young woman that the wind blows into a small, morally obsessed and oppressed French town one day. Using an ancient Mayan recipe discovered by her father, she and her daughter have come there to open a chocolaterie. Her confections are out of this world, and she uses them to try to help mend the various broken people and relationships in the town. But the mayor (Alfred Molina - Spiderman 2), whose family has dominated the town for centuries and who fears she will lead the townspeople away from their traditional faith and mores, declares war on Mademoiselle Rocher and tries to turn the townspeople against her.One by one she gains allies, first in the form of her landlady, Armande Voizin (Judi Dench - Shakespeare In Love, Pride And Prejudice) and her grandson Luc Clairmont (Aurelien Parent Koenig - debut), which infuriates Luc's mother, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss - The Matrix), who has forbidden him from seeing his grandmother. Then she gains a battered woman (Josephine Muscat - The Ninth Gate), whose husband (Peter Stormare - Fargo) the mayor tries to reform in order to prove that his way of changing people is better. It doesn't work. Johnny Depp doesn't appear until the second act to reinforce Vianne in her cause and to offer romantic interest. He and his river gypsy friends are also considered undesirables by the town.What's interesting about this film is that the Christian townspeople are being held hostage by the self-righteous, morally oppressive mayor, and consequently Vianne acts more like a Christian than any of they, even though she is not a believer. She takes a genuine interest in people and tries to help them with her friendship and chocolates. The mood of the film is magical, though magic has nothing to do with it - it's really about love. The question is, will love win out before Vianne gives up and decides her cause is hopeless?This film is rated PG-13, which is a shame because, if several scenes that are not critical to the story had been toned down or left out, it would have made a wonderful family film. It has a story-book setting and feel that would appeal to any age. Unfortunately, several scenes push it into the category of adult romance. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful story about love in the face of prejudice that all of us need to hear, as well as enough chocolate shown onscreen to satisfy any chocolate lover's craving.Waitsel Smith",4,SWEETLY ROMANTIC ADULT FAIRY TALE,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2475,"['Juliette', 'Binoche', 'English', 'Patient', 'Vianne', 'Rocher', 'free-spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'wind', 'small', 'morally', 'obsessed', 'oppressed', 'French', 'town', 'one', 'day', 'Using', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'recipe', 'discovered', 'father', 'daughter', 'have', 'come', 'there', 'open', 'chocolaterie', 'confections', 'are', 'world', 'try', 'help', 'mend', 'various', 'broken', 'people', 'relationships', 'town', 'mayor', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Spiderman', '2', 'family', 'dominated', 'town', 'centuries', 'who', 'will', 'lead', 'townspeople', 'away', 'traditional', 'faith', 'mores', 'war', 'Mademoiselle', 'Rocher', 'tries', 'turn', 'townspeople', 'her.One', 'one', 'gains', 'allies', 'first', 'form', 'landlady', 'Armande', 'Voizin', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'grandson', 'Luc', 'Clairmont', 'Aurelien', 'Parent', 'Koenig', 'debut', 'Luc', 'mother', 'Caroline', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'Matrix', 'who', 'forbidden', 'seeing', 'grandmother', 'Then', 'gains', 'battered', 'woman', 'Josephine', 'Muscat', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Fargo', 'mayor', 'reform', 'order', 'prove', 'way', 'changing', 'people', 'better', ""n't"", 'work', 'Johnny', 'Depp', ""n't"", 'appear', 'second', 'act', 'reinforce', 'Vianne', 'cause', 'offer', 'romantic', 'interest', 'river', 'gypsy', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'considered', 'undesirables', 'town.What', 'interesting', 'film', 'Christian', 'townspeople', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'self-righteous', 'morally', 'oppressive', 'mayor', 'consequently', 'Vianne', 'more', 'Christian', 'even', 'not', 'believer', 'genuine', 'interest', 'people', 'tries', 'help', 'friendship', 'chocolates', 'mood', 'film', 'magical', 'magic', 'nothing', 'do', 'really', 'love', 'question', 'will', 'love', 'win', 'out', 'Vianne', 'up', 'cause', 'hopeless', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'shame', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'critical', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'left', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'story-book', 'setting', 'feel', 'would', 'appeal', 'age', 'Unfortunately', 'several', 'scenes', 'push', 'category', 'adult', 'romance', 'Nevertheless', 'wonderful', 'story', 'love', 'face', 'prejudice', 'need', 'hear', 'as', 'well', 'enough', 'chocolate', 'shown', 'onscreen', 'satisfy', 'chocolate', 'lover', 'craving.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

She spends her life as a wanderer, bringing with her chocolate recipes that descend from the Mayas, but with preparation to tempt the most refined Europeans. The story starts when she and her daughter wander into a small city in France that dates back to the middle ages. It's a walled city, filled with walled people, the kind affronted by opening a chocolate shop during Lent and nastily eager to note the mother's never-married state.But, with a lot of determination and a little magic, Vianne wins them over, one palate at a time. As she helps bring people together, heal rifts, and create second chances for the townspeople, one wonders why the charm doesn't work on her own life. Then, Roux (played by Johnny Depp) appears, even more of a wanderer than Vianne. Instant affinity arises between these two roamers, but instant enmity comes from the deep-rooted locals - how dare they not live lives as staid as the villagers' own?Based on chocolate, you just know that this has to end up as a feel-good movie; I'm not spoiling any surprises there.
