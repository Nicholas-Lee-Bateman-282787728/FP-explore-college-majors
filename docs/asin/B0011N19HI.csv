1131646,A2K8LYR0PLES3,B0011N19HI,Annon,"[0, 2]","I gave this season a 4 star instead of a 5 because it is clearly missing something without Rhoda. The writing changed a bit trying to fill the void of Rhoda with Sue Ann and Georgette.  While Georgette is sweet and funny and adds to the show, for me Sue Ann is grating and annoying, and clearly took away from the humor.  It is so clear when watching this season to see where the character of Joey in Friends got all of his ideas.  Ted Knight is the original Joey!  There are several episodes this season that are VERY good, and then several that are not so great.  Amazon and Fox would get a 2 star from me as there are NO programs with this season to say what the episodes are or descriptions.  Plus I have ordered 2 so far with both having a ring on one disc that is a clear scratch causing the episodes to freeze!  Because I had this happen 2 times in a row, Amazon won't replace my set again!  This isn't my fault they sent me damaged discs, so I am not sure why I can't continue to get replacements until I get a set that works right.  They are giving me a refund, but that leaves me without season five!  This is the second TV set I've had this happen with in the last month. ""Man With A Camera"" was another one with a ring and freezing episodes.  The discs with the rings are clearly scratched all over with fine scratches.  I am VERY careful with my discs and they don't have scratches.

The first four seasons of this classic series were released in great box sets with slimline cases and episode descriptions.  They sold very well.  Then fans of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW waited years and years and years to hear anything of the release of season five let alone a guarantee on the full remaining seasons.  Then we were told the remaining seasons would only be released in a full series set which would include the earlier seasons people already had.  I know I am reiterating what all these reviews say but I must add my frustration as well.Over the years many lesser known and less popular series were being released on dvd and we continued to hear nothing about MTM.  Then months ago we heard word - season five would be released.  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Finally!!!!!!!!!  This was not only a tribute to fans and their persistent request for the release as well as tribute to the series which needs to be on dvd.  And what does Fox do.  Instead of going ""Here you go fans - Sorry for the wait but enjoy"" - they issue the most basic boxed set they can.  It is a simple plastic case with the discs simply placed inside.  No word on the # of episodes or any sort of episode guide.  This is the tackiest thing and an insult to MTM and fans.Of course the show itself cannot be faltered in any way.  This is one of the best series of all times and each season it grew in prominence, artistry and timeliness.  The characters came and went.  This was the first season without Rhoda but due to the quality of the show it carried on flawlessly.  Every episode here is a highlight and the dvd set is a must have.  Just please give us the rest as well.  Season 6 has the infamous CHUCKLES episode and season 7 has the one of the most heartfelt series finales in television history.Fans rejoice and be happy we have these glorious episodes.  If only there was a way to gewt back at Fox for their totally unprofessional handling of this situation and the release of such a subpar set.  Yes, we fans can print out episode guides ourselves but Fox should be ashamed.

Mary was a single career woman with responsibility, she was not constantly pining to have a man in her life and while she fretted over her budget, she remained independent and dressed well.That was a new way to look at women in the 1970's, before that women in television roles were generally homemakers that greeted their working husbands when they arrived home from work. Single women were generally depicted as constantly on the prowl for a man and any that had a sex life was depicted as being ""loose."" The character of Mary Richards was depicted as sexually very modest, yet there were episodes where it is clear that she was sexually active.When watching these episodes you cannot help but be impressed with the quality of the writing and the timing and delivery of the lines. The supporting characters are all very eccentric; the only one that I ever took a dislike to was the character of Georgette Franklin. The Ted Baxter character was portrayed as a pompous dunce and that seemed to be enough in the area of dumb, the silly stupidity of his girlfriend just seemed over the top, even though it was clear that such a woman was the only kind that could tolerate the obnoxious Baxter.Some of the modern comedies that are based on swearing, sexual situations and general crudity could learn some valuable lessons from watching these shows.

Seasons 5, 6 & 7 won the EMMY Award for Best COMEDY Series. It also gave us more Betty White (in what is her best role to date). The person who is putting this on hold needs to be released of his/her duty at Fox  and replaced by a more qualified person who will listen to the tv audience of yesteryear. We are not kids who buy current trash that is offered to us. We want and deserve quality shows. I, for one refuse to buy any of FOX's other tv series because they will NOT be released. FOX has proven to us that they are not to be trusted in completing any series releases.

I'd like to say I'm putting my foot down and not buying the last 2 seasons but who am I kidding.

1131663,A11CUAZXSK1305,B0011N19HI,David P. Mikelberg,"[13, 17]","I just watched Epsiode 17 of the fifth season, The System.  It aired on January 11, 1975, the night before Super Bowl IX.  Most every MTM fan knows that the writers had to declare a winner before the actual game was played.  They also wrote a tongue-in-cheek apology that Ms. Moore read over the closing credits.  It is not to be heard on this DVD set.Other consumers are writing about how nice it is that we finally have Season 5.  I disagree; I think it is a travesty.  Like others, I waited three years for this.  It arrived in a package so poorly designed that no self-respecting Graphics Designer would claim credit for. Everything about the cover has that fuzzy quality of a bootleg DVD sold on a street corner.  The episodes that I have watched so far look ok, but no better than what I have seen airing on Nick at Nite or TV Land.  As a consumer, I won't accept something so shoddy.  As a fan of the show, I will not watch this.  The real irony here is that I am not returning it.  I already had a copy of Season 5, but I am giving it to a friend.  Yes, it was one of ""those"" copies.  I was not going to wait for FOX to release the series.  If I did, I'd be as old as everyone in the newsroom was in the ""Lou's Daydream"" scene of Mary's Three Husbands.And where is Ms. Moore in all this?  Not to mention Grant Tinker, James L. Brooks, Allan Burns, Jay Sandrich, the cast, the writers and just about everyone else connected with MTM.  Every person who worked on MTM and had the opportunity to be interviewed about it mentions how special this show was.  They state how the experience of making it had touched their lives.  Did something happen recently that your fans don't know about?  Is it any less special today?  I sincerely hope not.Maybe Ms. Moore and Mr.Tinker made an error by selling MTM Enterprises.  I compare it to that other family-owned television production company.  What was it called?  Oh yes, Desilu.  I doubt that Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. would allow anything related to I Love Lucy to be released to the public in a manner like MTM is.Apropos of Ms. Moore's Animal Rights advocacy, I have an analogy to sum up how I feel about this DVD set.  The FOX took a bite out of Mimsie the Cat.  Mimsie leapt, and in the process ""jumped the shark"", taking the show with her.

My biggest qualm with this box set is that it isn't as nicely packaged as were the first four seasons.  The distributors went cheap on this one, doing away with the nice fold out glossy paper boxes, and packaging the three discs in one plastic box.  No notes to speak of.  No extras either.  Just the episodes to continue you on your way through the series until they come out with their comprehensive complete set which I see they are pricing at $160.Season Five is a bit of a letdown in other ways as well.  Gone isRhoda, with Phyllis more or less taking her place.  We see much more of Ted and Sue Ann, which is funny enough, but the two do get a bit tiresome after awhile, especially when Ted tries to put the make on Mary, passing around all sorts of rumors about their relationship until finally forced to admit it was all his creation.  I guess he just can't be satisfied with Georgette, who also figures much more into the fifth season.  Murray takes some odd turns as well, including his flirtation with anther woman in Barbara Barrie. What holds the season together is the ever strengthening relationship between Lou and Mary, which ultimately leads to her being named Producer of the news show, even if Lou promotes himself to Executive Producer.Once again the studios have pulled a fast one on loyal viewers, but what can we do?

This show was ground-breaking, innovative, full of Emmy Awards, hilarious, and honestly just sheer genius. It boggles my mind how Fox could make seasons 1-4 and then just HALT the rest of the DVD's from production?  I heard Fox claimed that the first four seasons were not very good sellers so they just decided to stop, period.  It's outrageous. I see the most bizarre, forgotten, pitiful series that have come to DVD and yet this masterpiece of a comedy show that set the gold standard for comedy is not even finished? I mean, for God's sake, finish what you started, Fox!  If you want to finish the series and charge a high price, we true MTM fans will pay the price?  It's basic economics with things like this.  You produce less at a higher price.  Give this show the dignity it deserves.  I'm no Oprah Winfrey fan by any measure but even Oprah had a show dedicated to the MTM Show and she had all the cast on.  She had a recreation of the original MTM set and the whole episode interviewed and reminisced about what wonderful memories this show brought.  At the end she said, ""The mary tyler moore show is available on dvd for seasons 1-4."" How sad! If Oprah could get Barak Obama elected, maybe she can get Mary back for us! I can't believe I'm saying this, but, ""Go Oprah!""",5,It is unconscionable that Fox is withholding this timeless classic from production!!,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,1364,"['Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'seven', 'years', 'show', 'was', 'ground-breaking', 'innovative', 'full', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'hilarious', 'honestly', 'just', 'sheer', 'genius', 'mind', 'how', 'Fox', 'could', 'make', 'seasons', '1-4', 'then', 'just', 'HALT', 'rest', 'DVD', 'production', 'heard', 'Fox', 'claimed', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'sellers', 'just', 'decided', 'stop', 'period', 'outrageous', 'see', 'most', 'bizarre', 'forgotten', 'pitiful', 'series', 'have', 'come', 'DVD', 'yet', 'masterpiece', 'comedy', 'show', 'set', 'gold', 'standard', 'comedy', 'not', 'even', 'finished', 'mean', 'God', 'sake', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'Fox', 'want', 'finish', 'series', 'charge', 'high', 'price', 'true', 'MTM', 'fans', 'will', 'pay', 'price', 'basic', 'economics', 'things', 'produce', 'less', 'higher', 'price', 'Give', 'show', 'dignity', ""'m"", 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'fan', 'measure', 'even', 'Oprah', 'had', 'show', 'dedicated', 'MTM', 'Show', 'had', 'cast', 'had', 'recreation', 'original', 'MTM', 'set', 'whole', 'episode', 'interviewed', 'reminisced', 'what', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'show', 'brought', 'end', 'said', 'mary', 'tyler', 'moore', 'show', 'available', 'dvd', 'seasons', '1-4', 'How', 'sad', 'Oprah', 'could', 'get', 'Barak', 'Obama', 'elected', 'maybe', 'can', 'get', 'Mary', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Go', 'Oprah']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show: Season 5

I'm not surprised. I doubt MTM 5 or 6,7 will ever be released.Well, I finally got #5.  Most ever scene was Ted Baxter, and I can't take too much of him, but all of Season 5 became not MTM, but the Ted Baxter show and that screwy girl friend of his.  Mary was like a 2nd banana to Ted Baxter.  It was terrible.  He was funny in the beginning of the series, because he came and he went.  But by season 5, he was in nearly every scene.  Mary couldn't have a moment alone in her apartment, without sickening Ted at the door.  Such obnoxious behavior repeated and repeated and repeated is annoying and contrived. Ted was OK as a 3rd banana but by the 5th story, he was the star.  For people who like slapstick, I guess they liked it, but I can't stand his type of humor.I guess the show collapsed without the ""Rhoda, Mary and Phillis"" combo and Murry and Mr. Grant, and even Mr. Grant's scripts got worse in season 5.

1131697,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0011N19HI,Mark Baker,"[8, 8]","It's always with a little sadness that I approach season 5 of this great show.  One of the things I love about the early seasons of the show is the great friendship between Mary and Rhoda.  And with Rhoda gone, I feel the show is missing a little something.  Fortunately, the other cast members step it up and that feeling doesn't last for more than an episode or two.The joy of a good ensemble comedy is the fact that you do have good strong characters to build upon.  Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) is still living in her one room apartment next to neighbor Phyllis (Cloris Leachman, who only has four episodes this season).  Her work life seems to overtake more of her personal life.  For example, boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner) moves into Rhoda's old apartment at one point.  Ted's (Ted Knight) girlfriend Georgette (Georgia Engel) stops by to visit on a more regular basis.  Heck, even happy homemaker Sue Ann (Betty White) shows up quite a bit more.  And good ole Murray (Gavin MacLeod) is by Mary's side every day at work.As with the previous seasons, this show features some classic episodes.  My favorite is ""Not a Christmas Story,"" which finds the gang snowed in and mad at each other.  Absolutely hilarious stuff.  Lou turns into a softy after he throws Ted through a door.  Murray struggles with his feelings about only having daughters.  Mary gets a promotion to producer and tries to go it alone with the news.  Sue Ann almost gets replaced by a much younger fan.  Phyllis tries to find a job after a bad economy destroys the family budget.  And in another favorite, Ted finally asks Georgette to marry him, in the middle of the 6 o'clock news.Even when this show gets serious, like the season opener with finds Mary facing jail time for not revealing a source, it never forgets it is a comedy.  There are plenty of laughs.Of course, the writing and the acting are all top notch here.  You couldn't ask for a better cast, and they truly bring these characters to life.As other have noted, the big drawback to the set is the packaging itself.  The shows are on 3 discs.  They could look a little better, but I don't think they are any worse than the other seasons have been.  We get no extras, but we didn't for the last two seasons.  What is unforgivable is no episode guide.  How can I find my favorite episode without it?  True, I can look it up on line, but that's annoying.  Additionally, they cut out the disclaimer voice over from ""The System,"" one of my favorite bits from that episode.So the set itself loses a star.  But the episodes are still timeless and funny.  Since this is probably the best we will ever get, if you are a fan, get this set.  You will certainly enjoy the core content.",4,"""What Did You Think, Mr. Grant?""

I wish I would have known beforehand that they were only to release the first four seasons and forget the last three, then I wouldn't have purchased the first four the day they were released.If a publishing company released the first four chapters of a book and ignored the remaining three because they weren't pleased with the sales, they wouldn't be in business for long. Failing to complete the entire series is akin to publishing an unfinished novel. The characters in the Mary Tyler Moore series have lots of great stories remaining; the final three seasons contain some of the best. (Chuckles Bites the Dust, Mary in Jail, etc.)Fox historically has had a peculiar business model in dealing with their home DVD division. Apparently the bean counters matter more than loyal customers. If Fox ever realizes that when (and if) they decide to complete the MTM series, it will be available for many years to purchase and they will profit from it. Currently all they are doing is angering customers. It may be in Fox's best interest to abandon their DVD Home Entertainment division since they apparently don't know what they're doing.Fox, here's a tip.....release the three remaining seasons individually, then about a year later release the entire series as a one box set with extras you didn't offer in the individual years such as Interviews with the cast, the first episode of the Rhoda and Phyllis shows, behind the scenes features, and the like; you get the picture. That way us Maryphiles will not only buy the remaining individual seasons but then we will have to buy the entire box set also. You'll double your profits and regain the warm fuzzies from Mary's fans that you have squandered.The Mary Tyler Moore Show won 29 Emmy awards and three Golden Globe Awards.The Mary Tyler Moore Show is #11 on TV Guide's list of 50 Greatest Shows of all Time.The Mary Tyler Moore Show is #1 on Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Shows of all Time.The Mary Tyler Moore Show's opening (Mary tossing her hat in the air)  Entertainment Weekly ranked #2 on their list of ""100 Greatest Moments in Television"".""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" episode ranked #1 (yes, that's #1) in TV Guide's Greatest Episodes of All Time.The Final three seasons ranked #11, #19 & #39 in the Neilson Ratings......and knowing this the suits at Fox still haven't completed the Mary Tyler Moore series. Fox, if you don't wish to release the remaining season, please allow another company to do so.

I was born in 61 and, after watching mostly westerns in the 60's, I fell in love with Mary, Rhoda, Phyllis and the gang. I really thought life as a single gal was like that!

First off, the flat thin mailer Amazon used suffered a hit and a tore opening.  When I pulled the case out, it was clear that 20th Century Fox has produced this season 5 title in a FAR cheaper manner. The case is a thin plastic and is devoid of of any ino., episode guide/synopsis, etc. There is NO extras listed.I then discovered the case was severly damaged in several ways. The top and bottom edges were badly cracked and split.  The inner spine as well as the flip-tray spindle top notch that holds it was completely broken off. Thus, the case was rendered useless to house the discs in any reasonable fashion.Not sure if the transit or that coupled with the fragile design added to it's ultimate demise.Very disappointing Fox didn't continue it's superior former  case slip cover, tray design as seen in season's 1-4.But a stroke of sheer luck, I had an extra case that was sent from paramount a while back on another title w/ the same case issues, had first sent me the wrong case prior to sending the correct one. And by more luck, was also a 3 disc design and the same type as the MTM case!  Fox clearly in it's effort to after MONTHS of fan demand for season 5-7, took VERY little effort to release this season in the same exceptioonal quality.  I'm just now watching the first episode and the picture quality at least is great.

""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is full of good acting, and wonderful production values.Why then did I, (and do I still), nickname this show, ""The Mary Tyler Moore HORROR Show""?  Because Mary is a woman seemingly totally alone.  Yes, she has friends -- but where is her family?  She is dependant on the whims, likes and dislikes of her irrascible boss, ""Mr. Grant"", (Ed Asner).  Her neighbours are very weird -- especially at first.Oh, she ""turns the world on with her smile"", all right.  She has gumtion and fortitude.  But not everyone does.  Every time I watched this show, I wished with all my heart that ""Mary Richards"" could go back to being ""Laura Petrie"" -- married, loved, and with stability in her life.  I suppose another nickname for this show could be, ""The Perils of Mary"".  And then there was the stereotype of her neighbour, the Jewish Rhoda Morganstern.  The show TRIED to be kind to Rhoda, but stereotypes she exhibited overshadowed any good points in her character.  Being Jewish myself, I literally SQUIRMED inside everytime these stereotypes showed up.  (MY idols are the young and etherea YVETTE MIMEUX, the young and ethereal CAROL LYNLEY.....QUEEN ELIZABETH II -- as a lovely young woman, and as an extremely good-looking older woman, (oh, how I'd love to know those youth-reserving royal beauty secrets!),  MIRA SORVINO, (famous for combining beauty AND brains), lovely Judy Bowker, just about every super-model that ever lived, especially at the beginning of their careers, (esoially JEAN SHRIMPTON, SUZY PARKER and CINCY CRAWFORD), and the young, smart and quite beautiful KATEMIDDLETON!  I realize these are NOT the stereotypical idols of Jewish ladies.  But then, ALL stereotypes are stupid.  Everyone is an individual.....)There is a rumour that a high-placed person in the George Bush II administration has ALWAYS been for ""women's lib""....but NOT because it would make more money for women.  Nope.  He was always for it so it would break up families!It's been a long time since I saw ""The Mary Tyler Moore"" show, so I don't remember if her family was ever shown.  She just seemed in SO vulnerable a position to me.Rhoda's stereotype also turned me off.  However funny and bright ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was, I felt a chill go up my spine, every time I watched it.Give me, instead, ""The Waltons"", ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Donna Reed Show"",or even ""The Trouble With Father"".  Families are important.  Even if Mary Richards was an orphan, didn't she know her family history -- even that of her adoptive or foster parents?",3,T H E.......M A R Y......T Y L E R.......M O O R E.......H O R R O R......S H O W,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,2641,"['MARY', 'TYLER', 'MOORE', 'SHOW', 'funny', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'well-written', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'full', 'good', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'production', 'values.Why', 'then', 'did', 'do', 'still', 'nickname', 'show', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'HORROR', 'Show', 'Mary', 'woman', 'seemingly', 'totally', 'alone', 'Yes', 'friends', 'where', 'family', 'dependant', 'whims', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'irrascible', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'neighbours', 'are', 'very', 'weird', 'especially', 'first.Oh', 'world', 'smile', 'right', 'gumtion', 'fortitude', 'not', 'everyone', 'Every', 'time', 'watched', 'show', 'wished', 'heart', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'Laura', 'Petrie', 'married', 'loved', 'stability', 'life', 'suppose', 'nickname', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'Perils', 'Mary', 'then', 'was', 'stereotype', 'neighbour', 'Jewish', 'Rhoda', 'Morganstern', 'show', 'TRIED', 'be', 'kind', 'Rhoda', 'exhibited', 'good', 'points', 'character', 'Being', 'Jewish', 'literally', 'SQUIRMED', 'everytime', 'stereotypes', 'showed', 'up', 'MY', 'idols', 'are', 'young', 'etherea', 'YVETTE', 'MIMEUX', 'young', 'ethereal', 'CAROL', 'LYNLEY', '..QUEEN', 'ELIZABETH', 'II', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'extremely', 'good-looking', 'older', 'woman', 'oh', 'how', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 'youth-reserving', 'royal', 'beauty', 'secrets', 'MIRA', 'SORVINO', 'famous', 'combining', 'beauty', 'AND', 'brains', 'lovely', 'Judy', 'Bowker', 'just', 'super-model', 'ever', 'lived', 'especially', 'beginning', 'careers', 'esoially', 'JEAN', 'SHRIMPTON', 'SUZY', 'PARKER', 'CINCY', 'CRAWFORD', 'young', 'smart', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'KATEMIDDLETON', 'realize', 'are', 'NOT', 'stereotypical', 'idols', 'Jewish', 'ladies', 'then', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'stupid', 'Everyone', 'individual', '..', 'rumour', 'high-placed', 'person', 'George', 'Bush', 'II', 'administration', 'ALWAYS', 'been', 'women', 'lib', 'NOT', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'women', 'Nope', 'was', 'always', 'would', 'break', 'up', 'families', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'saw', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'family', 'was', 'ever', 'shown', 'just', 'seemed', 'SO', 'vulnerable', 'position', 'me.Rhoda', 'stereotype', 'also', 'turned', 'off', 'However', 'funny', 'bright', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'was', 'felt', 'chill', 'go', 'up', 'spine', 'time', 'watched', 'it.Give', 'instead', 'Waltons', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'even', 'Trouble', 'Father', 'Families', 'are', 'important', 'Even', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'was', 'orphan', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'family', 'history', 'even', 'adoptive', 'foster', 'parents']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show: Season 5

1131712,ACYGBJCWATBSA,B0011N19HI,"R. Davenport ""Fiction fan""","[1, 2]","I am a big Mary Tyler Moore show fan...but haven't been able to watch this season since probably when it came out on TV..wow, what a long time ago. I have been enjoying the first four seasons but was sure hungry for more. I finally got my hands on this fifth season and I devoured it within a week! It was great! It was very interesting and cool to see how Mary's personality has developed, from a somewhat intimidated, nonassertive person who always takes care of others, to a more outspoken person who most people respected for her strong opinions, and still is well liked. There is a lot of balance in the episodes, as in not too much focus on one character or another. There are a few that do focus on one character or their story, but most of the time, all the characters are in all the episodes, and this is what makes the show so well rounded to me. I enjoy the full spectrum of what all the colorful characters bring to the show.When I finished the season, I had that little feeling of sadness, even though I know I can watch it again, or get the whole series, but I couldn't afford that yet. They are like friends to me, and sappily enough, I find myself talking like Mary sometimes. I am not sure anyone knows it, but I do...using words like ""crummy"" , ""lousy"" or other seventies derived words.I wanted this season so much that I accidentally ordered it twice, once pre ordered and then when it came out. So I decided to give the extra one to my mom for Christmas. We used to watch MTM together when I was young, and she enjoys it too, so I think it will make a fine gift. I sure recommend this season for any MTM fan.",5,Mary's growing up....,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,1628,"['am', 'big', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'fan', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'season', 'probably', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'TV..wow', 'what', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'enjoying', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'was', 'sure', 'hungry', 'more', 'finally', 'got', 'hands', 'fifth', 'season', 'devoured', 'week', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'Mary', 'personality', 'developed', 'somewhat', 'intimidated', 'nonassertive', 'person', 'who', 'always', 'care', 'others', 'more', 'outspoken', 'person', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'respected', 'strong', 'opinions', 'still', 'well', 'liked', 'lot', 'balance', 'episodes', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'one', 'character', 'are', 'few', 'do', 'focus', 'one', 'character', 'story', 'most', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'episodes', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'rounded', 'enjoy', 'full', 'spectrum', 'what', 'colorful', 'characters', 'bring', 'show.When', 'finished', 'season', 'had', 'little', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'even', 'know', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'yet', 'are', 'like', 'friends', 'sappily', 'enough', 'find', 'talking', 'Mary', 'sometimes', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'do', 'using', 'words', 'crummy', 'lousy', 'other', 'seventies', 'derived', 'words.I', 'wanted', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'accidentally', 'ordered', 'twice', 'once', 'pre', 'ordered', 'then', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'decided', 'give', 'extra', 'one', 'mom', 'Christmas', 'used', 'watch', 'MTM', 'together', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'too', 'think', 'will', 'make', 'fine', 'gift', 'sure', 'recommend', 'season', 'MTM', 'fan']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show: Season 5
1131713,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B0011N19HI,Retro Pixie,"[1, 1]","I think I've always wanted to be Mary.  I wanted to work at WJM, live in her apartment and look like her.  But there are no substitutes; Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards is an original.  She should be bronzed or, better yet, dipped in gold.  Besides, there's no way to follow an act who has worked her way up to producer of the news and, yet, still has enough whimsy to ask her boss to go ice-skating at lunch; someone who is fond of telling stories about being a pom-pom girl but has the wherewithal to go to jail for not revealing her source.  This is Mary, and this is how clever the character development and writing was in season five of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""The 1974/75 season is smart and hilarious, but the writers weren't afraid to add little moments of wistfulness as Mary is shown missing her best friend; Valerie Harper was starring in her own MTM production, ""Rhoda.""  The moments were few, but it's palpable.  When Mary has a problem with a guy, Georgette (Georgia Engel) asks her if she misses talking to Rhoda.  Another time we see Mary, Murray (Gavin MacLeod) and Georgette returning from a shopping trip for Rhoda's wedding.  We all miss the two of them together, but our own wistfulness quickly turns to laughter as the show managed with flying colors.In fact, they turned out some spectacular episodes this season.  Topping the list is ""Ted Baxter's Famous Broadcasters' School.""  Ted (Ted Knight) gets hooked into sponsoring said school.  When it falls apart, the outcome is one of the best scenes in sitcom history.  Guest star Leonard Frey is hilarious as the school's student.  The reactions to him from Lou (Ed Asner), Mary & Murray should be studied by actors.  Another favorite is ""The Shame of the Cities,"" where WJM does a positive documentary and the response to it leaves Mary tipsy.  She is the best at playing drunk.  ""Not a Christmas Story"" is also a favorite.  Sue Ann (Betty White) is taping her Happy Homemaker Christmas show & has Mary and the gang, who are all fighting, come to the studio for a hysterical holiday meal.  ""What Are Friends For"" has Mary and Sue Ann on a business trip together.  ""You Try to Be a Nice Guy"" features Mary helping a hooker she was in jail with.  The dress Mary wears at the end is insanely funny, but she looked fantastic.Another great thing about this season is there seems to be more references to the time period.  There are plenty of remarks about the economy and inflation, particularly in ""Phyllis Whips Inflation,"" where Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) has to look for a job.  Super Bowl 1975 is featured in ""The System.""  The most significant is a joke about President Nixon's impeachment; this season began right after Nixon resigned in August 1974.There are 24 great episodes with good disc quality.  No extras.  As mentioned by others, the packaging isn't the best.  I wish they had listed the episodes, but they're on the discs.Enjoy season five.  They're so good, you'll laugh and be Mary!  Well... maybe you won't be Mary, but you'll be...merry...do you know what I mean, Mr. Grant?  Hmm...Maybe I'm a little like Mary, after all.",5,Laugh and Be Mary,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3116,"['think', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'Mary', 'wanted', 'work', 'WJM', 'live', 'apartment', 'look', 'are', 'substitutes', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'original', 'should', 'be', 'bronzed', 'better', 'yet', 'dipped', 'gold', 'way', 'follow', 'act', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'producer', 'news', 'yet', 'still', 'enough', 'whimsy', 'ask', 'boss', 'go', 'ice-skating', 'lunch', 'someone', 'who', 'fond', 'telling', 'stories', 'being', 'pom-pom', 'girl', 'wherewithal', 'go', 'jail', 'not', 'revealing', 'source', 'Mary', 'how', 'clever', 'character', 'development', 'writing', 'was', 'season', 'five', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', '1974/75', 'season', 'smart', 'hilarious', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'add', 'little', 'moments', 'wistfulness', 'Mary', 'shown', 'missing', 'best', 'friend', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'was', 'starring', 'own', 'MTM', 'production', 'Rhoda', 'moments', 'were', 'few', 'palpable', 'When', 'Mary', 'problem', 'guy', 'Georgette', 'Georgia', 'Engel', 'talking', 'Rhoda', 'time', 'see', 'Mary', 'Murray', 'Gavin', 'MacLeod', 'Georgette', 'returning', 'shopping', 'trip', 'Rhoda', 'wedding', 'miss', 'two', 'together', 'own', 'wistfulness', 'quickly', 'laughter', 'show', 'managed', 'flying', 'colors.In', 'fact', 'turned', 'out', 'spectacular', 'episodes', 'season', 'Topping', 'list', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'Famous', 'Broadcasters', 'School', 'Ted', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'hooked', 'sponsoring', 'said', 'school', 'When', 'apart', 'outcome', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'sitcom', 'history', 'Guest', 'star', 'Leonard', 'Frey', 'hilarious', 'school', 'student', 'reactions', 'Lou', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Mary', 'Murray', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'actors', 'favorite', 'Shame', 'Cities', 'where', 'WJM', 'positive', 'documentary', 'response', 'Mary', 'tipsy', 'best', 'playing', 'drunk', 'Not', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'also', 'favorite', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Betty', 'White', 'taping', 'Happy', 'Homemaker', 'Christmas', 'show', 'Mary', 'gang', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'come', 'studio', 'hysterical', 'holiday', 'meal', 'What', 'Are', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'business', 'trip', 'together', 'Try', 'Be', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'Mary', 'helping', 'hooker', 'was', 'jail', 'dress', 'Mary', 'wears', 'end', 'insanely', 'funny', 'looked', 'fantastic.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'season', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'references', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'plenty', 'remarks', 'economy', 'inflation', 'particularly', 'Phyllis', 'Whips', 'Inflation', 'where', 'Phyllis', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'look', 'job', 'Super', 'Bowl', '1975', 'featured', 'System', 'most', 'significant', 'joke', 'President', 'Nixon', 'impeachment', 'season', 'began', 'right', 'Nixon', 'resigned', 'August', '1974.There', 'are', '24', 'great', 'episodes', 'good', 'disc', 'quality', 'extras', 'mentioned', 'others', 'packaging', ""n't"", 'best', 'wish', 'had', 'listed', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'discs.Enjoy', 'season', 'five', ""'re"", 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'be', 'Mary', 'Well', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Mary', ""'ll"", 'be', 'merry', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'Hmm', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'little', 'Mary']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show: Season 5

The Mary Tyler Moore Show in my opinion was/is (along with The Odd Couple) the funniest show on television. And time has not diminished that. It is still as fresh and original today. It contains what all sitcoms today lack. Great acting, writing, and most of all heart. I was so happy when I finally heard that Season 5(along with 6 and 7 coming later on) was being released. I got my dvd copy the first day. I however was very shocked when I saw that the same care in the packaging was not continued. No information of any kind. Wrong cast listing. And just very cheaply made. Not to mention any bonus material. I am glad that the shows are at full length, with no editing. However I feel so much more care should have been put into this. This show deserves all the care and respect that it earned during it's original run and still deserves today. Apparently Fox didn't think so. I also feel that the quality of the transfers are TERRIBLE. So much grain that I couldn't believe it. There has been no restoration or remastering of any kind. The transfers are clean, but it is so fuzzy and grainy that it can be a little distracting at times. In short a great show with a terrible presentation.

1131725,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B0011N19HI,The Wingchair Critic,"[3, 4]","'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,' which ran for seven seasons between 1970 and 1977, was, with 'All in the Family' (1971-1979), 'The Bob Newhart Show'  (1972-1978), 'Maude'  (1972-1978), and 'M*A*S*H' (1972-1983), one of the premier American television comedies of its era. The program also had one of the most talented casts ever gathered for a television comedy, the very model of ensemble comedic acting.As the 1970s dawned, seemingly overnight, the mannered and fanciful comedies of the 1960s, like 'The Beverly Hillbillies' (1962-1971), 'Bewitched' (1964-1972) and 'Mayberry R.F.D.' (1968-1971) were gone. 'Supernatural,' 'rural,' sentimental, and 'Middle Class WASP' comedies were, thanks largely to Norman Lear, suddenly considered pass&eacute;, and were replaced by comedies of 'social realism,' and, in fact, 'realism' of all kinds: early episodes of 'Maude' had a guest asking to borrow a feminine sanitary napkin and Maude herself having an abortion, while Archie Bunker, on 'All in the Family,' routinely flushed American television's first audible, but visually offscreen, toilet.'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' also offered its viewing audience its share of social precedents: without pushing the envelope too aggressively, the show recognized gay, Jewish, and Black minorities, and suggested the new 'informed' approach the American public should take to then-controversial issues like feminism, premarital sex, sex education for children, anti-Semitism, and even the then-unlikely situation comedy theme of addiction to prescription drugs.'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' also courted sympathy from audiences by giving Moore's initially perky, charming, and kind-hearted character, unmarried associate television producer Mary Richards, her share of life's miseries, including bad dates, failed parties, exploitive acquaintances, untimely bouts of influenza, and, famously, an inexplicable 'hair bump.'The problem with Season Five is that the lovable, warm, and generous Mary Richards of the first four seasons is almost nowhere in evidence; the show's producers may have always planned for Mary to evolve beyond the ingenue of the initial seasons, but by Season Five, Richards is inexplicably portrayed as continuously sour, peevish, strident, and markedly less tolerant of others and their behavior.In fact, in Season Five, the Richards character often comes across as almost unlikable; whether this was the producer's decision or at least partially Moore's choice, via her interpretation of the role, is unknown. Perhaps Moore developed personal problems which spilled over into her performance, or there were overt creative problems with the production itself. Regardless, the Mary Richards of Season Five barely resembles the bubbly, optimistic woman with the long dark hair of the first two seasons.What, if anything, did this hardened depiction of Mary Richards say about the 'New Woman,' the single 'career woman' of the era?Since the Mary Richards character is promoted from associate producer to producer of the evening WJM news about the same that her personality conspicuously changes, one logical interpretation of Season Five is that ""for a woman, professional success is no substitute for a happy marriage and a family of one's own,"" the same social model and hard-pressed message offered in 'The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet' (1952-1966), 'Father Knows Best' (1954-1960), and 'Leave It to Beaver' (1957-1963). It's impossible to believe, however, that this is the message the producers consciously intended to promote.The producers had wedged themselves into a tough, if not impossible, corner: if the romantically-desirable Mary Richards finally met a suitable man and married, then the entire 'fictional unmarried career woman who has made it possible for real women to stay home alone on a Saturday night' angle would collapse, but having Mary remain single throughout her thirties despite the attentions of dozens of handsome, eligible men seemed to suggest that the 'New Woman' could not find personal and mature romantic happiness whether single or married. Mary Richards started to appear--and to act---more like an oddball than a figure to be emulated and admired.Who the 'revised' Mary Richards does resemble is Beth Jarrett, the repressed, 'unfeeling' and emotionally clipped mother in Robert Redford's 'Ordinary People' (1980), a role also essayed by Moore in a performance which earned her an Oscar nomination.Worse still, the show ended in 1977 with Mary Richards being fired along with almost all of the rest of the newsroom staff by the new owners of WJM, leaving Mary without a career and without a significant relationship. Thus, the character's journey through the 1970s, while conceivably 'realistic,' seems to have ended in all-around failure.However, the entire tenor of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' has changed for the worst in Season Five, and for other reasons beyond the interpretation of Mary Richards: hilarious multi-prismed upstairs neighbor Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) is gone, and forward-thinking, melodramatic, and obnoxious downstairs neighbor Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachmann, who, interestingly, also played Donna Stone's best friend Iris on 'The Donna Reed Show,' one of the premier American television comedies of the 1950s and 1960s) appears in only a handful of episodes.The producers valiantly attempted to balance these losses by adding Georgia Engle to the cast as the perpetually naive Georgette Franklin, introducing the mercurial, sexually-aggressive cooking show host Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White, who had her own 1950s television comedy series, 'Life With Elizabeth,' which ran from 1952 to 1955), and, somewhat disastrously, by pushing childlike, vain, and stupid anchorman Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) forward so that he becomes a primary, rather than a secondary, character. It's simply too much Ted Baxter, and the character's overexposure dilutes Knight's former great effectiveness in the role. It's simply not believable that Ted and girlfriend Georgette turn up on Mary's doorstep almost nightly, the way Rhoda, who used to live in a converted attic above Mary's apartment, typically did.Though Georgia Engel was a genuine find as a performer and the character of Georgette charmingly written, neither could fill, as they were expected to, the colossal shoes left behind by Rhoda Morgenstern and Valerie Harper. In the same vein, it's difficult to believe that Mary would cultivate a close friendship with predatory, treacherous Sue Ann, who publicly insults Mary to her face in one episode after another. Why would a successful 1970s 'New Woman' tolerate, even court, open hostility from a 1950s-style matron?The evidence offered by Season Five suggests that the producers realized that the show's best days were behind them. The writing no longer had its finger on the zeitgeist the way it had in earlier seasons (with key writers like Treva Silverman no longer with the show), and while the program had initially felt organic, 'realistic,' and effortless, after Season Four, signs of strain, toil, and artifice where everywhere.An episode in Season Six ('Mary Moves Out') was tellingly dedicated to the ""rut"" Mary finds herself in, with Rhoda married and living again in New York City, and Phyllis now living in San Francisco. The producer's answer? Have Mary Richards move from her modest but iconic rental apartment to a much larger one in tony high-rise, a decision that probably wasn't too popular with fans at the time.When 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' went off the air in 1977, Moore has said that, as 'M*A*S*H' (1972-1983) would do later, the producers decided to end the show while it was still in relatively good form. Whether there should have been a sixth and seventh season is arguable, but 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' started to show major signs of fatigue and 'message failure' here.",3,"Mary Richards, The 1970s
