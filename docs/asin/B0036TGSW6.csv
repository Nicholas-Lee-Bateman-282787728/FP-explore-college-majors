1328750,A2CKO47KWC90A0,B0036TGSW6,"10-yr-old Movie Critic ""Perry's Previews""","[5, 8]","This review is featured on top of the film director Tomm Moore's blog:[...]and was published on ""We Chinese in America"" newspaper[...]-----------Do you know the name of the world's most visually stunning book?  It is illuminated, called The Book of Kells.  It was produced in the early 8th century in Scotland.  The book of Kells went on a long and arduous journey, somehow made its way to Trinity College in Dublin, where it resides today.  The rest in Real history!The Oscar-nominated animation ""The Secret of Kells"" is a story about a young orphaned boy Brendan, who lives in the Abby of Kells, under siege of the raiding Vikings.  Brendan's only family is his strict uncle, the powerful Abbott Cellach of Kells.  Although the Abbott loves his nephew, he doesn't have the right way.Soon, Brother Aidan, a master illuminator from a foreign land, came to the walled city of Kells.  He took Brendan under his wings and sent him on a journey to go into the forest to seek a special kind of berry: its juice can be made into emerald green-colored ink for writing ""The Book of Kells,"" yet to be finished.  Brother Aidan brought this sacred book with him, a book overflowing with wisdom and brilliant artistry, to be completed by Brendan!In the mysterious forest, Brendan is at first terrified of the strange sights and sounds.  He encounters a fairy that is unlike any other fairy in fairy tales.  Her name is Aisling.  She has many qualities that are lacking in ordinary fairies: She is completely white who can change into a wolf in an instant.  She has territorial instinct just like a wolf, but unlike a wolf, she can climb trees!  She does not have wings and is more agile on her feet.  It is hard to impress a fairy, but Brendan tried his best and eventually succeeded!  Together, the two must join forces to stop the Viking's invasion and find a magic crystal, so that Brendan can finish the last pages of the Sacred Book.I was thrilled to have the opportunity to interview director Tomm Moore from Ireland who made The Secret of Kells as his first feature length animation.  Moore loved comics and animation as a child.  He studied in the college Don Bluth helped set up - Ballyfermot Senior College, and started his own studio Cartoon Saloon with some friends back in the premises of Young Irish Filmmakers in Kilkenny.My favorite characters are Brendan and Aisling.  Brendan is faithful, loyal, curious, hard-working, loves literature, and through Brother Aidan, discovers his own hidden artistic talents.  I am a master at art, just like Brendan, though my parents discovered my talents much earlier, as soon as I started drawing when I was three.  I consider myself a better artist than a film critic, because I have been creating art for a much longer time than reviewing movies!I also share a great imagination and love for nature with Brendan.  I love to see wild animals in the natural ecosystem.  I also wrote and illustrated lots of books, such as ""Journey to Land,"" about the adventures of a pack of African cheetahs.  In my view, imagination is only ""magic"" to those who don't understand it.  To those who have imagination, art is simply a natural way to express that imagination.I like Aisling because she acts most like a real kid.  She is a free spirit, and loyal to Brendan.  She was based on director Moore's own younger sister who ""had a similar personality, (a little pest!) and she had big eyes and bushy eyebrows, pink knees from climbing trees and playing outdoors and pale skin,"" said Moore.  ""Aisling is mostly made up as a representation of all the old Pagan gods and creatures who went before.  Aisling means dream or vision in Gealic.""  One of my favorite scenes is when Aisling magically turns Pangur Ban (Brother Aidan's mysterious cat with differing eye colors!) into a spirit as she sang a beautiful, haunting song.""The Secret of Kells"" is an ""illuminating"" tale about friendship, wisdom, overcoming fear, and discovering your own creativity.  It has splendid visual, haunting music, and amazing storyline built upon historical facts.  I think this movie would appeal to a wide audience, although younger kids may be disturbed by the war scenes.I give the film 4.5 starfish.  It's Perrific!  I noticed that the cat, Pangur Ban, did not age as most of the human characters, nor did the old man with long beard who first discovered that Brendan was gone from his cell.  Are they magic?  I asked director Moore.  ""I get asked this all the time :) Well, for me, Pangur Ban is sort of a symbol of Aidan and Iona, she may be magical like Aisling,"" said Moore. ""Pabgur Ban IS kind of immortal because a monk wrote about his cat Pangur Ban in a poem that's in one of the manuscripts from that period, so school kids in Ireland learn about Pangur Ban to this day.  Or maybe the cat at the end is her daughter :)!""  Which one do you think is more likely?There were many similarities between ""The Secret of Kells"" and other ""Perrific"" animations.  It is visually stunning like one of my all-time favorites, the 5-starfish-rated ""Azur & Asmar,"" directed by the French animation master Michel Ocelot who became a dear friend of mine since I interviewed him in San Francisco last year.  Also the Princess Charnsous Sabah in ""Azur & Asmar"" was locked up in the palace and not allowed to leave; just like Brendan was forbidden to leave the walled fortress of Kells.Brendan, just like Hiccup in ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" lived a thrilling double life.  At the start of the film, Brendan was always thinking about what his uncle the Abbott Cellach would do to punish him.  Once he befriended Aisling, he forgot all about his worries and lost track of time.  Both Brendan and Hiccup lost their moms and had a strict father or father figure in their lives, who lacked confidence in the boys.  Both boys violated the rule of the leader, however, such violations transformed their lives permanently for good.  Each befriended a mystical creature who became their ally.  But Toothless is more than an ally, he gradually turned into a pet once Hiccup tamed him!  Aisling, however, kept her wild spirit and independence.I noticed that the Vikings in this film have eyes that are like glowing balls with dim light.  They are heartless and don't look human at all.  The Vikings show a lack of respect for artistry and human knowledge, as they rip the pages of the sacred Book of Kells.While other films have more complex visuals, ""The Secret of Kells"" succeeds in its own unique visual style: simple but elegant.  The lines that make up the human characters and objects are bold, decisive, and beautiful, suffused with splashes of vivid colors.  Adorned with priceless jewels, with a bright golden cover and pages that seemed to glow from within, The Book of Kells represents the power of art, literature, and human creativity itself.Friendship can heal your worries.  The path to enlightenment takes courage, creativity, and perseverance.",5,An Illuminating Tale of Creativity - Movie Review & Director Tomm Moore Interview,1270944000,"04 11,

1328756,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0036TGSW6,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 4]","This Oscar nominated animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic retelling of that story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings, must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling.Gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand (there is some computer animation in a few key passages) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but strange in a good way, not in the off putting variety but in the eye opening sort. If one were to nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th century Ireland - one would have to say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce.

I bought this film mostly because the artwork seemed unusual and I was exploring animation styles for a project I'm working on. The plot, while interesting is rather predictable and not very challenging. It also seems a bit rushed at the end where the boy suddenly grows up and brings the book back to the Monks. As someone else mentioned it is short, but then most animated features are. That didn't matter as much to me because I actually enjoyed the artwork more than the film.

1328761,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B0036TGSW6,buru buru piggu,"[6, 7]","The Secret of Kells is a delightful animation out of Ireland and one of the films nominated for Best Animated Film at the 2010 Academy Awards. Sadly, not many people have heard of it in the US. It is the collaboration of several international studios (in Ireland, Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, and France) and a stellar example of top-notch animation. The distinct and inventive art style perfectly blends traditional 2D hand-drawn animations with CG and is a joy to look at. For fans of animation, it is well worth seeking out.It is set in the early Middle Ages (800 CE) and concerns the creation of the Book of Kells, a masterwork of Celtic art/calligraphy and one of Ireland's most important national treasures. The story revolves around a young boy named Brendan who lives in the Abbey of Kells, from which the book gets its name. He is watched over by his uncle, the over-protective Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson), who spends his days supervising the construction of a great wall to defend the inhabitants of the monastery from Norse invaders, the scourge of pre-Christian Europe. Brendan is forbidden to leave the city gates, but everything changes when Brother Aidan arrives, fleeing Viking raiders who destroyed his Scottish village of Iona with the partially finished manuscripts. Brendan curiosity gets the best of him and he becomes enthralled by the book, venturing into the forest for supplies against the orders of his uncle. Here he meets and befriends the forest spirit Aisling, and together they overcome a series of obstacles to complete the book.The film isn't preachy, religiously suggestive, proselytizing, or heavy-handed. It just tells a story of a boy overcoming his fears and becoming a greater person, using a historical reference point as a backdrop. It has a fairy-tale charm that is easy to appreciate by kids and adults alike.Visually, the animation style and character designs are very playful and inventive. Everyone has a very distinct stylized look. For example, the other monks are round or square, the Vikings are very angular, featureless, and cloaked in shadow. The backdrops have the look of hand-drawn and hand-painted water color, interwoven with 3D animations seamlessly composited into the scenes (things like butterflies, leaves, birds, smoke). Everything just feels right, unlikeThe Princess and the Frogwhere the CG sometimes sticks out like a sore thumb. Animation fans will recognize the look because one of Cartoon Saloon's major clients is Cartoon Network. Aisling and some of the main characters, for example, have the style ofStar Wars - Clone Wars Animated SeriesandPowerpuff Girls. Some of the smoke/mist effects as well as visuals also reminded me ofLegend of Zelda The Wind Wakerand Miyazaki Hayao films likePrincess Mononoke.The music is equally wonderful, with abeautiful song by Aislingand some Irish folk music compositions. There are some potentially dark and scary moments for young kids, especially with the Vikings, so parents should prescreen.

And proceeds to pull four feathers from its tail.The feathers will be used by the friars to copy texts in the scriptorium. They will also get the boy, Brendan, in trouble with his uncle the abbot. Because, while Brendan dreams of books and drawings, the abbot wants him to help build the wall that will protect the abbey from the feared Viking raiders, and has forbidden him to leave the abbey.Brendan follows his uncle's orders, until one day Brother Aidan, the only survivor of a Viking attack on his monastery, arrives at Kells seeking refuge. He brings with him the legendary Book of Iona, the book he has been working on most of his life. To finish it he will need rare acorns to make the colored ink and a mysterious crystal to help him create the fractal effect of his drawings.Lured by the beauty of the pictures, Brendan disobeys his uncle and goes into the forest where the pagan spirits live and wolves lurk in the shadows.Befriended by Aisling, a forest spirit, with long silvery hair, who can sing animals ([...]) to change shape at her will, Brendan collects the seeds and goes into the dark underworld where the evil presence that has killed Aisling's parents live, to get the crystal.Ultimately the Vikings attack the abbey and the fate of the book that will be known as the Book of Kells (""the pinnacle of Insular illumination.""

Pixar and Disney fans need to forget about the cuteness and the life lessons that characterize these two companies, but this is exactly what makes you remember ""The Secret of Kells"". The animation is inspired by the Book of Kells itself, which reminds me a bit of old school animation, but with a quality that shows and represents current technology. Another highlight of this film is the soundtrack, composed by Bruno Coulais, which helps the movie penetrate your mind and come alive whenever you listen to it.Brendan is a boy living with the monks at Kells Abbey. Brother Aidan, escaping from the Vikings, arrives one day from the Iona Abbey carrying with him the unfinished ""Book of Iona"". Brother Aidan is concerned about who is going to finish it, for his eyesight is no longer good enough for this task and because he also needs two things: gall nuts to make ink and the Eye of Collum-Cille. Brendan decides to help, and this leads him into the forest surrounding the Abbey of Kells, which he has been forbidden to visit.Regardless of how historically accurate this film is, this film should be taken as a legend. Legends are half fantasy and half reality, and there is usually more than one version to it, so why can't this film be another version of the legend of the Book of Kells? I don't know why there are reviewers giving this film a low rating because it's not historically accurate. This film does not pretend to be a documentary; it's simply an animated film. In adition, some reviewers are also giving this movie a low grade because it's mixing pagan and Christian beliefs. The film is set in Ireland and during the Middle Ages, a historic period known for being plagued by paganism and in a country with strong celtic beliefs, so I cannot believe there are people making this a problem.I would have given this film 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that, in order to fully appreciate this film, you need to have some Celtic culture 101 beforehand. I have always been interested in Celtic culture so I was fascinated the entire time by this film, but people who know little about this topic might have a bit of a rough time feeling hooked by the plot. For instance, if you have no idea about what the Book of Kells is, you might watch the film wondering what the fuss is all about these monks and the book. Sure, it is said in the film that ""this book"" will give hope to people and help them overcome darkness, but, other than that, nothing else.All in all, a great film that stands out greatly from your regular Disney and Pixar films.",4,Leabhar Cheanannais,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2608,"['best', 'animated', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'fans', 'need', 'forget', 'cuteness', 'life', 'lessons', 'characterize', 'two', 'companies', 'exactly', 'what', 'remember', 'Secret', 'Kells', 'animation', 'inspired', 'Book', 'Kells', 'bit', 'old', 'school', 'animation', 'quality', 'current', 'technology', 'highlight', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'composed', 'Bruno', 'Coulais', 'movie', 'penetrate', 'mind', 'come', 'alive', 'whenever', 'listen', 'it.Brendan', 'boy', 'living', 'monks', 'Kells', 'Abbey', 'Brother', 'Aidan', 'escaping', 'Vikings', 'one', 'day', 'Iona', 'Abbey', 'carrying', 'unfinished', 'Book', 'Iona', 'Brother', 'Aidan', 'concerned', 'who', 'going', 'finish', 'eyesight', 'no', 'longer', 'good', 'enough', 'task', 'also', 'two', 'things', 'gall', 'nuts', 'make', 'ink', 'Eye', 'Collum-Cille', 'Brendan', 'help', 'forest', 'surrounding', 'Abbey', 'Kells', 'been', 'forbidden', 'visit.Regardless', 'how', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'legend', 'Legends', 'are', 'half', 'fantasy', 'half', 'reality', 'usually', 'more', 'one', 'version', 'so', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'film', 'be', 'version', 'legend', 'Book', 'Kells', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'reviewers', 'giving', 'film', 'low', 'rating', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'documentary', 'simply', 'animated', 'film', 'adition', 'reviewers', 'are', 'also', 'giving', 'movie', 'low', 'grade', 'mixing', 'pagan', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'film', 'set', 'Ireland', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'historic', 'period', 'known', 'being', 'plagued', 'paganism', 'country', 'strong', 'celtic', 'beliefs', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'are', 'people', 'making', 'problem.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'film', 'need', 'have', 'Celtic', 'culture', '101', 'beforehand', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'Celtic', 'culture', 'was', 'fascinated', 'entire', 'time', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'topic', 'might', 'have', 'bit', 'rough', 'time', 'feeling', 'hooked', 'plot', 'instance', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Book', 'Kells', 'might', 'watch', 'film', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'monks', 'book', 'Sure', 'said', 'film', 'book', 'will', 'give', 'hope', 'people', 'help', 'overcome', 'darkness', 'other', 'nothing', 'else.All', 'great', 'film', 'out', 'greatly', 'regular', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'films']",N/A

The visual imagery is amazing, packed with stunning composition and color, and imaginative direction. The pace of the film is a bit odd - deliberate in places, jumpy in others - and that, along with the deep, mystical fascination with nature and spirituality, reminded me of the work of Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki, just with a clearer historical perspective.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[34, 38]","The Book of Kells is Ireland's greatest treasure: an ancient book filled with exquisite illuminations.Technically, ""The Secret of Kells"" is about the making of that book. But it's far more than that -- it's a visual hymn to Ireland's history, a coming-of-age tale, and a parable about Christianity coming to Ireland. Modern animation is suffused with exquisite Celtic art, music and a sense of fairy magic, and wrapped around a seemingly simple story about a boy learning about the power of art.Abbot Cellach is determined to save the Abbey of Kells from the Viking invaders, so he's having the monks (including his nephew Brendan) build a vast wall around the abbey.  But when the illuminator Brother Aiden arrives, he brings with him the legendary Book of Iona. Brendan is fascinated by the Book, and ventures out into the forest -- against the abbot's orders -- to fetch ink-making supplies for Aiden.He befriends a strange fairy girl named Aisling, and nature's beauty inspires his art -- until his uncle discovers that he's sneaking out, and forbids him to have anything to do with the forest or Aiden. But Brendan still wants to become a true master of illumination. And to finish the Book, he must go outside the abbey once more, and snatch away the magical Eye of an ancient sleeping evil...You can see this movie from many angles -- it's a coming-of-age story, a homage to Irish culture, a story about the importance of art, and a parable about Christianity supplanting Celtic paganism (whilst drawing on its beauty).  But however you see it, ""The Secret of Kells"" is a beautiful story with a calm simplicity, and a slightly quirky sense of humor.It also tackles some darker, more mature themes -- Brendan is exiled to a dungeon for disobeying his uncle, and he ventures into the cave of an ancient god surrounded by wriggling black roots. But directors Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey drop in lots of beautiful little moments as well, such as Aisling magically ""singing"" Aiden's cat into a floating spirit.It also has a truly unique style of animation: ""Kim Possible"" style (simple designs with lots of sharp and/or rounded edges) with vibrant jewel-toned backdrops (the sunlit emerald hues of the forests). The best parts are when Celtic symbols and art are woven in, especially since they tend to float through the air like butterflies.The writers also give great care to sketching out characters -- Brendan, the little monk who discovers the ""miracles"" of the world; Aisling, the elusive wolf-girl who assists him; and the grandfatherly Brother Aiden. On the flip-side we have Abbot Cellach, whose obsession with keeping Kells safe causes him to shut out art and beauty. No, he's not a 2-D bad guy -- he's just desperate.Obviously it's not on the level of the Book of Kells, but ""The Secret of Kells"" is still a beautiful work of cinematic art.

They are living in a time where invaders are pillaging and killing small villages and Brendan's uncle is obsessed with building a wall he thinks will keep them out. He has forbidden Brendan from ever travelling outside of the walls. Then another monk, brother Aiden, comes to Kells and he is the holder of a book that has the most amazing illuminations in it. The book is supposed to change with life of anyone who reads it, but it isn't finished yet. Brendan's uncle has also forbade Brendan and the other monks from doing any illumination because he wanted everyone to be as consumed with the building of the wall as he was. When brother Aiden came however, he inspired Brendan to want to see his illuminations. Aiden sent Brendan into the forest to find berries he needed to make ink, and he went. This was Brendan's first rebellions against his uncle and he was very nervous and got lost in the forest. There he meets a wolf who turns into a girl, named Ashley. She's a fairy and befriends and helps Brendan. On the way back to the monastery they come across an evil presence which we deal with later. So Brendan studies illumination under the tutelage of Aiden and things are progressing quite well until Aiden realized he lost a glass that helps him do the most intricate work, and the name of the glass shares the name of the evil presence Brendan and Ashley passed in the forest. So Brendan takes it upon himself to fight this beast for the sake of the book that will change the world.This film is a visual masterpiece. Everything is geometrical. At first glance the animation looks juvenile and simple, but the scenes are so well laid out and intricate. The characters are very geometrical in nature, and when they run in a group they form a single shape. The cracks or shapes in between objects or objects themselves are all patterned.One flaw I found in the film was that the monks were all of different nationalities and the portrayal of their different nationalities was really racist, almost offensively so.

Disney, Pixar et. al. have pulled out all the stops to amaze everyone with seamless animation, incredible color schemes and mind boggling 3-D thrills. This is all fine and dandy, and some great stuff has come out of Hollywood, but sometimes less is more.Enter Secret of the Kells. This movie is more subtle than much of what is released in American Cinemas. If you saw (and enjoyed) the incredible Azur and Asmar then this is for you. Both are in a similar vein. They both have simple but magical stories. Both have tremendously imaginative artwork and color pallets. And both have clever animation. Those before me have recounted the story so I won't bother but, though some of the elements might not be new, it's put together in such a way as to appear entirely fresh. The characters are realized through their design as much as through their script. Abbot Cellach is tall and has long powerful looking arms. They aren't muscular, Hercules looking arms. You just realize their sense of power by their design. The waifish Aisling is realized through her eyes and hair. All the characters have some indelible thumb print. The set designs are great and Moore, the director, seemed to say so much with so little.I would like to say this is great for the entire family though the scenes with the wolves and the marauding Vikings might be too scary for the very young. If you think your kids can take it please try to get them to watch it. Animation can be a true art form and this movie underscores that in a big way.Though Brother Tang might be a bit too much of an Italian characiture  it's a minor quibble to such a great achievement.

Indeed, ""The Secret of Kells"" is unique and beautiful.Blending vibrant colors, imaginative storytelling, this film (only 75 minutes long) gives us a look at Irish history and legend as it follows the story of young Brendan, an orphan living among monks. He hears tales of Aidan, a respected illuminator working on a wonderful book of light that dispels darkness, and when Brother Aidan shows up in their walled abbey, Brendan finds himself doing things he never dreamed of. From his first hesitant peek into the book to his courageous trek into the woods, Brendan's life changes. He is now part of completing this mysterious book before the marauding Vikings come to destroy the abbey and those things precious to the monks. He is also in conflict with his prideful uncle who rules the abbey through fear and control.It's a tale of spiritual warfare, of legend, and history. Brendan's biggest blessing and curse come to him in the woods, the blessing in the form of Aisling, a silver-haired sprite who takes him on dashes through the trees (as beautifully rendered as anything in ""Avatar""); and the curse in the form of Crom Cruach, a devilish being that seeks to destroy good and light. Brendan, with the help of his friend, must face this monster if he is to save his uncle, the abbey, and the legendary Book of Kells.At times, this movie is breathtaking in its lush landscapes and colors, its fresh storytelling and ideas. I was reminded of watching ""Watership Down"" as a child, moved by the images so different from standard Hollywood fare. That said, there are some amazing films coming from Pixar and even Dreamworks. The bar has been raised.""The Secret of Kells"" is a wonderful accomplishment, well deserving of its Oscar nod, but it is more likely to appeal to adults and artists than to the younger crowd weaned on fast-paced storytelling with lots of humor and modern scenarios.

1328785,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B0036TGSW6,Gerard D. Launay,"[1, 1]","As a lover of world animation, I had to see this picture after it was nominated for an Oscar. Boy...I was not disappointed!  Ostensibly, it is the tale of the creation of the Book of Kells - a mythic explanation how this amazing illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels came to be.  Commentators in the Middle Ages thought it was the product of angels...in the movie, it is a forest sprite who helps the hero (Brendan) find the rare materials to color the manuscript.  He has to finish the magical book, started by an earlier medieval monk, and keep the treasure safe from marauding Vikings.  Historically, the book did have to be protected from the Vikings of the North...so that part of the story is true.The animation boasts brilliant colors and weaves Celtic images of yore into a fluid landscape of symbols and knotwork.  Perhaps, in this way, the inner mystery of the Book of Kells is preserved, even though the pictures in the authentic book in the Trinity College Library of Dublin are manifestly different. But cartoon and manuscript share mysterious symbolism, intricate ornamentation, and exceptional bold colors. Rarely does a film enthrall me to the point I can hardly breathe...yet this film had this dramatic impact on my person.Possibly, the only other animated film that matches this style is ""The Boy Who Wanted to Be A Bear"" - an Eskimo fable created by a Danish animator.  These two movies use the lines of symbolism of native cultures in an exciting, vibrant fashion. Yes, these films prove WHY the art of two dimensional animation must continue.After seeing the movie,  I was intrigued by the ancient book itself.  I sought out Bernard Meehan's treatise on ""The Book of Kells.""  Indeed, if ""The Secret of Kells"" moves others to explore the  background of the actual illuminated manuscript in Ireland, it will serve as a valuable tool in expanding childrens' curiosity of world history.",5,Exquisite animation - Story of Mystery,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,1909,"['lover', 'world', 'animation', 'had', 'see', 'picture', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Boy', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Ostensibly', 'tale', 'creation', 'Book', 'Kells', 'mythic', 'explanation', 'how', 'amazing', 'illuminated', 'manuscript', 'Four', 'Gospels', 'came', 'be', 'Commentators', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'thought', 'was', 'product', 'angels', 'movie', 'forest', 'sprite', 'who', 'hero', 'Brendan', 'find', 'rare', 'materials', 'color', 'manuscript', 'finish', 'magical', 'book', 'started', 'earlier', 'medieval', 'monk', 'keep', 'treasure', 'safe', 'marauding', 'Vikings', 'Historically', 'book', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'protected', 'Vikings', 'North', 'so', 'part', 'story', 'true.The', 'animation', 'boasts', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'weaves', 'Celtic', 'images', 'yore', 'fluid', 'landscape', 'symbols', 'knotwork', 'Perhaps', 'way', 'inner', 'mystery', 'Book', 'Kells', 'preserved', 'even', 'pictures', 'authentic', 'book', 'Trinity', 'College', 'Library', 'Dublin', 'are', 'manifestly', 'different', 'cartoon', 'manuscript', 'share', 'mysterious', 'symbolism', 'intricate', 'ornamentation', 'exceptional', 'bold', 'colors', 'Rarely', 'film', 'enthrall', 'point', 'can', 'hardly', 'breathe', 'yet', 'film', 'had', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'person.Possibly', 'only', 'other', 'animated', 'film', 'style', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Wanted', 'Be', 'Bear', 'Eskimo', 'fable', 'created', 'Danish', 'animator', 'two', 'movies', 'use', 'lines', 'symbolism', 'native', 'cultures', 'exciting', 'vibrant', 'fashion', 'Yes', 'films', 'prove', 'art', 'two', 'dimensional', 'animation', 'must', 'continue.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'intrigued', 'ancient', 'book', 'sought', 'out', 'Bernard', 'Meehan', 'treatise', 'Book', 'Kells', 'Indeed', 'Secret', 'Kells', 'others', 'explore', 'background', 'actual', 'illuminated', 'manuscript', 'Ireland', 'will', 'serve', 'valuable', 'tool', 'expanding', 'childrens', 'curiosity', 'world', 'history']",N/A

Wilkerson,"[161, 167]","Brendan dreams of writing the greatest book of all time, but he's stifled by his uncle, Abbot Cellach, who wants Brendan to be practical and help build a wall around the village of Kells to help protect them from an impending Viking attack. When Brother Aidan turns up from another village that's already been attacked by the vikings, he captivates Brendan because he was a great writer, and he asks Brendan to help him finish the now legendary Book of Kells. Now, Brendan must defy his uncle's warnings and venture into the forest outside Kells and confront his fears of the ""Dark One"" to find inspiration to finish the great Book of Kells.The Academy Awards have a tendency to nominate a lot of films that have only been released in limited release and are not very widely seen. Some people see this as a detriment, thinking that the Academy has lost touch because it typically doesn't look at the more widely seen and generally loved movies. In my opinion this is actually a strength, when awards season rolls around I'm looking up those other movies to catch the gems that I missed, knowing that something great is out there that should have been released wide. That's the case with The Secret of Kells. To be honest, and it's kind of sad, I'm not too familiar with animation outside of anime and American anime. Thanks to the Academy Awards, though, I found out about this great animated feature.Kells is the type of movie that kind of has one foot planted in fantasy and legend, and another foot planted in reality. The Book of Kells is a real historical book created around the 6th to 9th centuries and is considered Ireland's finest national treasure. The origin of the Book of Kells is still widely disputed, so the creation of the book is ripe to made into a film of sorts. In The Secret of Kells, the story revolves around an older monk teaching a child about inspiration and art to create the Book of Kells. In reality, it seems the major theme of this movie deals with one generation teaching another generation about the art of hand drawn animation. In a day and age when computer animation has all but taken over for the older hand drawn animation, it's great to see a film that's more of a call to the old traditions and does it so well. The Secret of Kells is beautifully rendered to the screen, as well as highly original, still looking better than a lot of computer animated features that come out these days which makes it's message that much more potent as well.I highly recommend this film to anyone that like animated features of any kind. You'll find certain similarities to anime, as well as older animated films like some of the early adaptations of Rudyard Kipling books like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and the like. Honestly, this might even be my favorite animated film of the year so far, at least it's very close between this and Up.

Now, after having seen it, I am not as inspired as I had hoped. While the animation was certainly very different and the color palette quite amazing, it wasn't as breathtaking as the folks who nominated it for an Oscar would have you believe. True, while it was very colorful, it still wasn't comparable to old-time Disney animation. I'm sure the point, though, is that it wasn't supposed to be. And that is why no stars have been taken away for that reason in this review. It was clear throughout the viewing that this little film out of Ireland was created with lots of love and tender care, and that is most likely why the majority of reviewers here on Amazon are giving it five stars. But don't forget, it didn't WIN the Oscar. ""The Secret Of Kells"" has a touching story, a morally defined story, a story built upon a foundation of teaching with the intent to make sure the watcher learns said teachings. Starting out with five stars, the story presentation is where I take the first star away...&lt;SPOILER> The story, while made up of all the components I just mentioned, was a bit flawed in that it wasn't engrossing to any extent. With the kaleidoscopic and varied application of animation, it could have carried that all-encompassing factor flawlessly had it been expanded upon more AFTER the Northmen tried to take over the city of Kells. But instead, we jump instantly to many years in the future. This, to me, took away from the MAIN part of the story, which should have followed with Brendan's growing up years, the expansion of the Book of Kells at his hand of artistic prowess, his relationship with and tutorship from Brother Aidan, and his eventual reunion with his uncle, Abbot Cellach, who thought him to be dead. At only 75 minutes, another ten or fifteen minutes to capture this important part of Brendan's life wouldn't have hurt the film at all, in fact, it would have made it much, much better. A major fault was that Brendan and his uncle were somehow separated after the war so quickly and inexplicably, that I had to rewind the movie to see how it happened and then still couldn't figure it out. This was also about the point where the music abruptly stopped and the screen went black for a solid three seconds. One wonders how the editor didn't catch this huge, gaping mistake...and it is clearly an editing mistake. So it seems that there was more to the story at one time (probably the most important part) that ended up on the floor of the editing room.I also had a problem with Brendan's continual defiance of his uncle's rules when Brendan was still in his youth. This is where star number two was removed. I really don't want my children watching or reading a story where everything eventually turns out to be okay each and every time the child disobeys his elder. I'm sorry, but at Brendan's age, rules are NOT made to be broken, and additionally, with the defiance and disrespect for adults that is plaguing the world's youth these days, it is simply not a good message to be sending out to the young masses. True, Brendan was scolded for his actions, but he was still aided by another adult to defy his uncle yet again after the fact. Granted, the story wouldn't have held much levity at all if Brendan did everything he was told, but it's a no-brainer that it could have been written in such a way that blatant disrespect wasn't the very basis upon which the meat of the storyline was made possible. &lt;SPOILER END>All in all, a slightly above average movie, probably a bit overrated, and not anywhere near being comparable to ""Up"" or ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as far as story, and close, but still not in the same boat, as ""Snow White"" or ""Cinderella"" in terms of animation-style and complexity.

CGI took Up to another dimension, but hand-drawn animation is what makes Kells so fine. You can really feel these characters in a visceral way, and the fine script and voicework only adds to the lustre.The 2D effect is very similar to last year's other excellent handmade animation masterwork, Sita Sings The Blues, as well as older fare like Samurai Jack and many anime classics. But Kells occupies its own space on that shelf due to its many unique qualities. The plot is a wonderful thing for kids to consider (and adults too!): the preservation of a book as the key to the preservation of a society. Of course it's ironic that we're watching a 'toon to learn that, but the odds are that kids will be more into this than into sitting in front of copies of the original (astonishingly gorgeous) Book of Kells....and perhaps it will lead them to the book itself and consideration of its ever more influential Celtic knots and other endless artistic intricacies.McGuire and Gleeson's voices are perfection, as are everyone's, in fact. The colors are stunning but never overdone just for effect's sake, and it's the background matte paintings that are the real highlight for me here. You can just freeze the frame with every new background and revel in the detail, touch and luminous color. Check out the trees especially; the bark and leaves are rendered with deep feeling. There is a real love for and understanding of the power of nature here (pagan though it may be!).And the dvd is a fabulous transfer. We watched it upconverted through a PS3 onto a large LCD screen and it looked as good or better than most blu-rays. I imagine the blu-ray of this would be even finer, but not once did I ever long for better picture quality. There's color and black depth to spare here.There are some moments of (never gratuitous) violence, but nothing like what kids see on tv day in and out, so that's not a serious concern for most parents. The dialog is so intelligent and its ideas so worth considering that you'll delight in watching this with your kids, and you or they won't ever feel talked down to.Congratulations to Tomm Moore and crew: Kells is a masterpiece worthy of its namesake.",5,Beautiful film; hand-drawn animation still has more feeling than CGI,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2385,"['Secret', 'Kells', 'own', 'way', 'almost', 'equal', 'Up', 'mild', 'compliment', 'think', 'one', 'finest', 'works', 'animation', 'Disney', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'classics', '1930s-1950s', 'CGI', 'took', 'Up', 'dimension', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'what', 'Kells', 'so', 'fine', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'visceral', 'way', 'fine', 'script', 'voicework', 'only', 'lustre.The', '2D', 'effect', 'very', 'similar', 'last', 'year', 'other', 'excellent', 'handmade', 'animation', 'masterwork', 'Sita', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'as', 'well', 'older', 'fare', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'many', 'anime', 'classics', 'Kells', 'own', 'space', 'shelf', 'due', 'many', 'unique', 'qualities', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'kids', 'consider', 'adults', 'too', 'preservation', 'book', 'key', 'preservation', 'society', 'course', 'ironic', ""'re"", 'watching', ""'toon"", 'learn', 'odds', 'are', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'sitting', 'front', 'copies', 'original', 'astonishingly', 'gorgeous', 'Book', 'Kells', '.and', 'perhaps', 'will', 'lead', 'book', 'consideration', 'ever', 'more', 'influential', 'Celtic', 'knots', 'other', 'endless', 'artistic', 'intricacies.McGuire', 'Gleeson', 'voices', 'are', 'perfection', 'are', 'everyone', 'fact', 'colors', 'are', 'stunning', 'never', 'overdone', 'just', 'effect', 'sake', 'background', 'matte', 'paintings', 'are', 'real', 'highlight', 'here', 'can', 'just', 'freeze', 'frame', 'new', 'background', 'revel', 'detail', 'touch', 'luminous', 'color', 'Check', 'trees', 'especially', 'bark', 'leaves', 'are', 'rendered', 'deep', 'feeling', 'real', 'love', 'understanding', 'power', 'nature', 'here', 'pagan', 'may', 'be', '.And', 'dvd', 'fabulous', 'transfer', 'watched', 'upconverted', 'PS3', 'large', 'LCD', 'screen', 'looked', 'good', 'better', 'most', 'blu-rays', 'imagine', 'blu-ray', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'finer', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'ever', 'long', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'color', 'black', 'depth', 'spare', 'are', 'moments', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'nothing', 'what', 'kids', 'see', 'tv', 'day', 'not', 'serious', 'concern', 'most', 'parents', 'dialog', 'so', 'intelligent', 'ideas', 'so', 'worth', 'considering', ""'ll"", 'delight', 'watching', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'feel', 'talked', 'down', 'to.Congratulations', 'Tomm', 'Moore', 'crew', 'Kells', 'masterpiece', 'worthy', 'namesake']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","In the world where Flash cartoons and anime regularly dominate television animation, it's rare that the cartoons themselves are an expression of a European artistic style.  ""The Secret of Kells"" addresses that problem by using the Book of Kells as a template.Brendan (Evan McGuire) is the young nephew of Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson), who lives in the Christian Abbey of Kells. Cellach is obsessed with the construction of a wall around Kells, the better to keep out the raiding Northmen that destroyed the island monastery of Iona. When Aidan (Mick Lally) the master illuminator arrives with the Book of Iona in hand, their world is upended.  Aidan proves to be a gentle but disruptive influence on Brendan, who is encouraged to venture beyond the walls in search of gall nuts to make ink for the Book.  It is there that Brendan meets Aisling (Christen Mooney), a fey being who takes a liking to the young boy.""The Secret of Kells"" never really makes a case for why Aisling is so protective of young Brendan, but she is pivotal to the entire tale.  Brendan becomes the champion, protector, and eventually author and artist of what will become the Book of Kells. At every turn, whenever danger rears its head, Aisling is how he gets through it.Fortunately, ""The Secret of Kells"" is so visually engaging that it's easy to forgive the plot's occasional rigidity. The artwork is nothing short of stunning, bringing an ancient manuscript to life in a variety of animated forms.  It also has some truly breathtaking moments, including a haunting melody about Aidan's stalwart feline companion Pangor Ban.And that's what elevates ""The Secret of Kells"" above common animated fare. It's filled with hidden nuggets that reward the persistent. Although the details are postulated by Fabrice Ziolkowski all of it is based on what we know of the Book of Kells: the Book is believed to have really journeyed from Iona to Kells, Crom Cruach was really a Celtic pagan deity, and yes Pangor Ban was a real cat with a real poem written about him.My four-year-old was enthralled and, despite the Northmen being cast as gold-lusting brutes, wasn't bothered by the off-screen violence.

Aiden befriends Brendan and begins to teach him the ways of a master illuminator. Abbot Cellach disapproves of Brendan spending his time this way when he should be helping to build the wall. Brendon disobeys his uncle's orders and goes outside of the walls to get berries for Aiden to make ink. While in the forest he meets an adorable wolf-girl-spirit-thing named Aisling and the two become friends. All the while, the Vikings are getting closer to the Abbey.First off, The Secret of Kells is one of the most stunningly beautiful films I have ever seen. The makers had a relatively low budget of $9 million (as opposed to The Princess and the Frog's $105 million budget) and instead of trying to overextend themselves and have complicated designs and choppy animation, they used a relatively simple yet gorgeous heavily stylized animation style, much like Samurai Jack or Spectacular Spider-Man. (At one point early on in the film, when various characters are telling over a story it becomes even more stylized.) The results are fantastic. Then animation is especially enjoyable when it comes to Aisling--she moves like some sort of graceful animal and her hair flows with her in a way that is wonderful to watch. As for the backgrounds, well, they're quite beautiful as well. The colors are fantastically vivid, especially the forest scenes. Kells also uses perspective in a rather stylized manner that's reminiscent of Richard William's The Thief and the Cobbler, except that the backgrounds are made up of more than just checkerboards. The Secret of Kells is a visual treat, and worth seeing just for that aspect alone.The movie is far from perfect, though it's not often you can complain that a movie is too short (75 minutes) rather than being too long. This wouldn't be a problem if the ending didn't feel a little rushed and incomplete, but I guess that can be blamed on the budget. It also pretty much assumes you know I have a decent knowledge of Irish lore. I had to look up who Crom Cruach was. (He's a pre-Christian Irish deity.) Heck, they don't even mention that The Book of Kells is a Bible, though that's pretty important when it comes to explaining why it's so important and will give hope to the people. But don't let these two problems stop you from seeing the film. It's enjoyable despite these gaps.The DVD also comes with a surprisingly decent number of special features. First off is a decent audio commentary that's informative, but does get a little boring in a few places. There's also an entertaining video showing the voice recording process, though it runs on a tad too long. Pencil-to-Picture is a few scenes from the film shown side-by-side with the storyboards/pencil tests. The Directors Presentation is a behind-the-scenes slide show with the director's commentary. The Early Concept Trailer shows what the film could've been; it's interesting, though I'm glad they decided to use a different animation style in the final film. It also includes a director's commentary. Aisling at the Oscars is a seventeen-second animated clip of Aisling made especially for the Oscars (though the audio seems fairly poor for some reason). Finally, the US theatrical trailer is included as well. Considering the amount of special features the past few titles I reviewed had, these were all a real treat.The Secret of Kells is a phenomenal film, not just because it is visually beautiful, but because it feels like no other animated film I've ever seen. Had it not been going up against Pixar's Up it very well could've won Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards. It's unique, and in a good way. As I said earlier, it's worth seeing this film even if you don't like the story, just to witness a visual masterpiece.

1328827,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0036TGSW6,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","This is quite possibly the most beautiful animated film you will ever see in your life. The colours are vibrant, the movement is fluid, the style is unique, and the images it conjures up are unforgettable. It's like watching a dream unfold.Brandon is a young monk living in the walled Abbey of Kells in 9th century Ireland, under the care of his stern and rather forbidding uncle. All of Abbott Cellach's attention is fixed on constructing a great wall around the perimeter of Kells so as to better keep out the dreaded Vikings who pillage and destroy everything they come across in their search for gold. Brandon has well and truly internalized his uncle's anxieties, for he defends his uncle's decisions in the carefree face of the other monks and shows no interest whatsoever in entering the forest that he occasionally glimpses through a chink in the wall.But all that changes when Brother Aidan arrives from the Isle of Iona, fleeing Vikings and carrying with him a book of illuminated pages filled with pictures so beautiful they are said to be able to ""turn darkness into light."" Now known as the Book of Kells, this is a real manuscript currently kept on permanent display at the Trinity College Library in Dublin and which is considered Ireland's most precious natural treasure.Brandon is immediately entranced by the beauty of the book, neglecting his chores in order to help Aidan gather the materials he needs to make paint and continue his great work. Slipping out through the chink in the wall to the forest beyond, Brendan finds a beautiful yet frightening place filled with wolves and spirits: and one little faerie girl called Aisling who decides to help him.But Abbot Cellach is not sympathetic about Brendan's new interests, especially not with more and more refugees daily flocking to the Abbey as they flee the encroaching Vikings. Terrifying figures that are depicted as brutal and faceless T-shapes with horns and axes, the invaders are unstoppable - and nearing Kells. Meanwhile, Brendan takes it upon himself to venture into the lair of the pagan god Crom Cruach in search of a crystal, a valuable instrument needed in order to better learn his newfound craft.The story is certainly the weakest aspect of the film, with rather muddled messages about how to deal with the issues that it raises. For instance, the threat of the Vikings is not dealt with in a satisfying way. Abbot Cellach's motto is to build higher and stronger walls in the face of invaders, whilst Brother Aidan urges everyone to run away in the face of evil. As it stands, neither one's methods are particularly effective, yet neither one's choices have much in the way of consequences. The Viking attack on Kells is frightening enough, but when the smoke clears there doesn't seem to be a devastating amount of damage (there are plenty of survivors, and the residents soon rebuild). On the other hand, Aidan and Brandon successfully escape with the book, but their methods result in Cellach believing that his nephew is dead, subjecting him to years of grief before Brendan finally decides to return.I spent the entire film assuming that Aisling would call up spirit forces to defend the Abbey, whilst Brandon would rely upon his Christian faith in order to defeat Crom Cruach, but neither supposition came to fruition. It felt as though a really lovely balance could have been struck between the Old and New Religions of Ireland, but instead there's an odd disconnection and an anti-climax.Even stranger is the fact that despite the centrality of the Book of Kells as the story's main McGuffin, the film offers no insight whatsoever into its contents. The film is rife with paganism and spirituality, but Christianity doesn't seem to get much of a voice. The film even goes to all the trouble of establishing that the book has miraculous powers, and yet when it comes into the hands of an indisputable enemy... nothing happens.It's best just to go with the flow in regards to the plot and enjoy the beautiful animation and charming characters. It's a toss-up between Aisling and Pangur B&aacute;n as the film's most beguiling character. Aisling (pronounced ""Ashling"") is a small white spirit who performs gravity-defying backflips and peeks out from behind impossibly long white hair, whilst  Pangur B&aacute;n captures the quintessential nature of any cat: curious and self-important, affectionate and conceited, brave and vain. Both are beautifully rendered and share the film's most haunting scene: in trying to free Brandon from his chamber, Aisling uses a magical song to temporarily turn Pangur B&aacute;n into a spirit who gently floats through the Abbey and retrieves the key from above the Abbot's bed.There really aren't enough words to describe how beautiful the film is, and it's so rare these days to see hand-drawn 2-D animation (everyone else having moved to computer animation).

I had to let it sit this long before I could come up with anything reasonable to say about it (in other words, any review where every third word would not have been some variation of ""awesome!""). I'm still not quite convinced I'm capable of it; I can think of only one (three if you count Jan Svankmajer's stop-motion masterpieces) fully-animated film I've ever seen that's better than &lt;em>The Secret of Kells&lt;/em> (that being &lt;em>Hotaru no Haka&lt;/em>).Based (very) loosely on folktales surrounding the creation of the Book of Kells, an Irish retelling of the four Gospels, the film (whose artwork is also based on the Book's illustrations) centers on Brendan (Evan McGuire), a spunky young apprentice living in a remote Irish abbey presided over by his uncle, the dour Cellach (Brandan Gleeson). All is relatively well, or as well as it can be, until Brother Aidan (Mick Lally), a legendary illustrator who takes Brendan under his wing, arrives. Worse yet, while on an errand for Aidan (which Cellach has strictly forbidden Brendan to undertake), Brendan meets Aisling (Christen Mooney), a local supernatural being (one hesitates to use the term ""fairy"", even if it is here in its most classical sense) who strengthens Aidan's message that there is, in fact, more to life than Cellach's obsession with building a wall around the town strong enough to withstand the Vikings. All well and good, until the Vikings approach...While there are certain scenes (most of which involve said Vikings) that will probably be a bit on the intense side for younger viewers, and others will take (and have taken) offence to the movie's overtly pro-Christian overtones, I had neither problem with the film (and I am speaking as an avowed atheist with an infant son, who was riveted to the screen most of the time). I was, in short, bowled over by it, despite knowing very little about the Book of Kells before sitting down to watch this. The animation is top-notch, and stylized to the point where one marvels that it came out of the Disney studios. But then, there is so little Disney about this movie I'm just assuming that the Disney Ireland folks ignored any directives from Hollywood and went their own way on this. A good idea that was, indeed, if it happened. There is a distinct lack of princesses, a fine absence of talking animals (thought there is a trademark anthropomorphic cat, Pangur Ban--but he, too, is lifted from Celtic tradition, rather than being smacked into the story wholesale a la the lovely, if out-of-place, police horse in &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>), and, well, far too much complexity, storywise (and emotions-wise), for your average Disney movie. It's  an amazing piece of work, and if you're unfamiliar with the backstory, just sit back and let the incredible animation wash over you. This is pretty much everything an animated movie &lt;em>should&lt;/em> be. **** ",5,By far the best thing to come out of a Disney-related studio in decades.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,3154,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Secret', 'Kells', 'lt', '>', 'Tomm', 'Moore', '2009', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'five', 'months', 'fact', 'watched', 'superlative', 'lt', '>', 'Secret', 'Kells', 'lt', '>', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'year', 'animation', 'had', 'let', 'sit', 'long', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'reasonable', 'say', 'other', 'words', 'review', 'where', 'third', 'word', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'variation', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'convinced', ""'m"", 'capable', 'can', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'count', 'Jan', 'Svankmajer', 'stop-motion', 'masterpieces', 'fully-animated', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'better', 'lt', '>', 'Secret', 'Kells', 'lt', '>', 'being', 'lt', '>', 'Hotaru', 'Haka', 'lt', '/em', '>', '.Based', 'very', 'loosely', 'folktales', 'surrounding', 'creation', 'Book', 'Kells', 'Irish', 'retelling', 'four', 'Gospels', 'film', 'artwork', 'also', 'based', 'Book', 'illustrations', 'centers', 'Brendan', 'Evan', 'McGuire', 'spunky', 'young', 'apprentice', 'living', 'remote', 'Irish', 'abbey', 'presided', 'over', 'uncle', 'dour', 'Cellach', 'Brandan', 'Gleeson', 'relatively', 'well', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'Brother', 'Aidan', 'Mick', 'Lally', 'legendary', 'illustrator', 'who', 'Brendan', 'wing', 'Worse', 'yet', 'errand', 'Aidan', 'Cellach', 'strictly', 'forbidden', 'Brendan', 'undertake', 'Brendan', 'Aisling', 'Christen', 'Mooney', 'local', 'supernatural', 'being', 'one', 'use', 'term', 'fairy', 'even', 'here', 'most', 'classical', 'sense', 'who', 'Aidan', 'message', 'fact', 'more', 'life', 'Cellach', 'obsession', 'building', 'wall', 'town', 'strong', 'enough', 'withstand', 'Vikings', 'All', 'well', 'good', 'Vikings', 'approach', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'most', 'involve', 'said', 'Vikings', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bit', 'intense', 'side', 'younger', 'viewers', 'others', 'will', 'take', 'have', 'taken', 'offence', 'movie', 'overtly', 'pro-Christian', 'overtones', 'had', 'problem', 'film', 'am', 'speaking', 'avowed', 'atheist', 'infant', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'short', 'bowled', 'over', 'knowing', 'very', 'little', 'Book', 'Kells', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'animation', 'top-notch', 'stylized', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'came', 'Disney', 'studios', 'then', 'so', 'little', 'Disney', 'movie', ""'m"", 'just', 'assuming', 'Disney', 'Ireland', 'folks', 'ignored', 'directives', 'Hollywood', 'went', 'own', 'way', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'indeed', 'happened', 'distinct', 'lack', 'princesses', 'fine', 'absence', 'talking', 'animals', 'thought', 'trademark', 'anthropomorphic', 'cat', 'Pangur', 'Ban', 'too', 'lifted', 'Celtic', 'tradition', 'rather', 'being', 'smacked', 'story', 'la', 'lovely', 'out-of-place', 'police', 'horse', 'lt', '>', 'Tangled', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'well', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'complexity', 'storywise', 'emotions-wise', 'average', 'Disney', 'movie', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'backstory', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'incredible', 'animation', 'wash', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'animated', 'movie', 'lt', '>', 'should', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'be', '****']",N/A

Those talented artists have reduced me to blubbering jelly and made me laugh hysterically more times than I can count - I am getting misty right now just thinking of Sarah MacLachlan's ""When She Loved Me"" from ""Toy Story 2,"" and don't get me started on the money-jar montage of ""Up.""  And if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, other studios seem to pay Pixar compliments every other week as another big studio cranks out a computer-generated animated flick, desperate to become the next Pixar.But by gum there are other animators out there whose movies need to be watched, and Tomm Moore is one of them.  Moore, who wrote and co-directed ""The Secret of Kells,"" understands that at the heart of every great movie is a great story.  ""SoK"" is a classic.  It's the Dark Ages, and the Vikings are running amok.  (Rendered here in horrifying black minimalist style, the Vikings have never looked so cartoonish or so evil.)  All of Ireland is aflame or terrified they will be next.Monastaries are a bastion of light and education during these dark times.  The monastary at Kells is ruled by the iron-yet-caring hand of Abbott Cellach (Brendan Gleeson), who seeks to protect the monastary by building a terrifying wall.  But the monks are also illuminating manuscripts - recording the Bible in some of the most beautiful pages ever created - while the rest of the world burns.  Indeed, the famed illuminator Aidan, a fugitive from Iona, arrives at Kells and continues his life's work of recording the Gospels.  To do this, he enlists the help of Brendan, the youngest and most daring monk in Ireland.What does he need Brendan for?  In the dark, sinister forest, a humble berry grows that is essential to the creation of the ink needed to illuminate the manuscripts.  And so it is that Brendan ventures into the forest to seek the berries, and this is where the adventure becomes magical.Suffice it to say that Brendan meets a girl in the forest who is ever so much more than she seems.  In the face of a Viking invasion, these two forge a magical, timeless relationship that will delight and enchant.This is a complex, grown-up story that kids get right away because it is so fundamental.  Everyone also clues into what's going on thanks to the amazing animation, which is as flat and two-dimensional as you can get.  This is powerful, subtle art, and it perfectly matches both the harsh life in the monastary and the wondrous enchantment that is the forest (not to mention the dark power of the Viking invasion).While this movie does not come stamped with a big studio name, this movie proudly takes its seat at the table of Great Animated Movies of the past decade.

That was not the case with ""The Book of Kells,"" a delightfully imaginative experience whose style and tone evoke some of the Japanese master's work without copying it.  The story -- based loosely on the history of the actual Book of Kells, an illuminated Holy manuscript -- is a sensorial experience that melds both Christian and non-Christian ideals as we follow the exploits of Brandon, an orphan who will become central to its creation.  Though told from the point of view of a child, the story is decidedly adult, and though not explicit, often not quite kid friendly -- again, like many anime features.  But its spirit is aimed at the kid in all of us, from the knowingly familiar tribulations of growing up to the delightful cadre of secondary characters (including the forest spirit, Aisling, and, as a nod to historical accuracy, a diverse range of monks representing many of the great theological artists of the world at that time) to the sly cat Pangur Ban, who is as realistic a feline in temperament as any who has ever graced the screen.  The cast is excellent, though the only voice that may be immediately familiar is the always enjoyable Brendan Gleason.  True, some people may be put off by the mixing of Celtic and other traditions, but this international production (I counted Irish, Belgian, and Turkish while admiring the end credits, but I'm sure there is more) doesn't ask to be viewed as anything but high entertainment.

It's as polished as a Ghibli or Pixar film.  Every scene looks fabulous, and the film has audio and music to match.  Yet surprisingly, even when it first opened in Ireland, the box-office was low and the film struggled with its American cinema distribution.  Why?  A few jaded early reviews probably didn't help - I vaguely remember reading gripes about the 'weak' plot, and other niggles, that put me off the film.  How wrong they were, as the Oscar nomination proved.  The story is fine, and the characters are well-delineated and engaging.  The dialogue is crisp, well delivered, and the story moves along briskly. While the film's visual panache will undoubtedly appeal to (and possibly frighten) 6-8 year olds, it's probably older intelligent children in the 9-12 range who will enjoy it the most - and possibly all the more after a look at the real Book of Kells in the online facsimile, and a read of the famous short cat-poem ""Pangur Ban"".  The DVD extras include two short 'making of' featurettes, and an apparently (I never listen to them) rather dry audio commentary.

I liked the little girl with long white hair. She was adorable and powerful. When I first watched her in action, I was easily impressed and I felt like watching these two movies all over again: Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky. The girl was great, and her wolf friends were incredible and frightening. This movie may not be long, but it had a grand story and it looked like it took great timing.I love the animation and how the scenes capture the flow of the movie. The colors of tragedy, beauty, and imagination astounded me and I could not resist. It has been a while since a movie like this one really interested me such as Avatar, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Toy Story 3, and many others. I love how the movie begins and how the movie ends with a great heartwarming momment. This is a grand animated movie to behold and it is now in my top favorite animated films for life. I will remember this movie as a great achievement even though UP won for Best Animated Picture for the Academy Awards. I do like many of Pixar's works, but we need to give other animated movies a chance to be successful. For example, Spirited Away competed against Monsters Inc. and won for Best Animated movie in the Academy Awards. I still like 2-D animated movies a lot and I think they are still astounding whether they have 3-D animated elements, or not.I am glad I was able to see this film. This, along with Avatar (James Cameron's film), The Princess and the Frog, A Christmas Carol (with Jim Carrey), and District 9, is one of my favorite movies of 2009. Yeeeaaaah!

1328847,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0036TGSW6,William Timothy Lukeman,"[2, 2]","Amid the flood of computer-generated animation films bursting with shallow pop culture references, this lovely little film is like a green-gold flower, pure & shining with its rich simplicity. The art alone is astonishing in its faithfulness to the Book of Kells itself, vibrant with tiny details & vivid colors -- it truly imparts a sense not only of place, but of frame of mind. It's clear at once that the film is talking about, and is itself, something timeless & for the ages, rather than being mere disposable pop trash created to grind out merchandising dollars.Now, there have been some complaints that it tones down the specifically Christian aspect of the Book of Kells & that it's not historically accurate. I submit that this well-meant argument is really beside the point. While the film uses history as a starting point, this is poetry & art, not hard fact -- the point is metaphor & even allegory, depicting an eternal human struggle between destructive, devouring greed that sees only materialism & power as human needs, and the higher aspirations of humanity, which strives for civilization, beauty, art & meaning. So the Viking invaders are a faceless, dark menace, almost an embodiment of our own darker selves; while both the monks & the survivals of the Fair Folk are the guardians & caretakers of our better selves. In this context, the film is absolutely contemporary!This is made even more clear by our young protagonist Brendan's encounter with Crom Cruach, as the young monk-to-be descends into the Underworld to confront an ancient, grim, cruel & hungry god of darkness -- in a Jungian sense, confronting his own Shadow. And his relationship with the otherworldly Aisling can be seen as his connection with the Anima, his own soul in the guise of a magical female counterpart, linking male & female, pagan & Christian. While Brendan is no stranger to fear, loss & grief, it's obvious that he'll become more of a whole human being over the years than many of us ever manage ourselves.Still, I don't want to make this sound too weighty or burdened with overt, heavy-handed symbolism. Above all, the film is truly magical, shimmering with a sense of wonder & possibility that transcends the mundane world without ever denying its often overwhelming power & presence. It's a visual delight & has genuine emotional impact. For those of us who aspire to more than the lowest common denominator offered by modern consumer culture, it's a reminder that the things of real value are to be found within ourselves & have no price tag attached.

This amazing little gem combines gorgeous imagery and fine storytelling with real Irish culture and history. The conflict between art and more down-to-earth concerns might be a bit heavy-handed in places, but everything else works beautifully. In particular, I couldn't help notice Brendan's utter unconcern about any mismatch between his Christian, monastic upbringing and his faerie friend - the pagan nestled neatly next to the religious life. The pervasive respect for art and artists probably owes a lot to Irish tradition, too.Marvelous animation really brought this story to life for me, though. Different aspects of it invite comparison to many other greats of imagery: elements ofMiyazakiin the forest, some ofRalphBakshiin the Norsemen and wolves, perhaps a bit ofJay Wardin some of the characters' appearance, and the book of Kells throughout. Image composition brought to mind church windows, triptych iconography, and much more - even eye color in Brendan, Aisling, and the cat was suggestive. Perhaps there's nothing new to be had in animation (an opinion I dispute), but there are always new combinations to be had.

Having never heard anything about this movie but liking the description, we both settled down in the couch to watch it. We were mesmerized from beginning till the end. A perfect blend of history and folklore, this is a high quality production that is well-deserving of the Oscar nomination it received this year (I checked the movie out after viewing it, wondering why it never got wide publicity).The story begins in the Abbey of Kells, circa 9th century. The Abbot is intent on building a strong wall that would protect the abbey from marauding Vikings. He is strict with his nephew Brendan and is disappointed when the boy seems more interested in more scholarly pursuits. Brendan gets apprenticed to a master illuminator, Aidan of Iona, who along with his feline companion, Pangur Ban, comes to the Abbey after the Vikings destroy his abbey. Aidan is working on the Book of Kells, but since his own eyesight is failing him and his hands are not as steady as they were, he calls on Brendan to help him. Young Brendan is more than eager, finding himself entranced by the beauty of the artwork, and this passion causes him to defy his own uncle's strict orders not to venture out of the abbey. Brendan goes into the nearby woods looking for plants to make into ink. Here, Brendan meets and befriends Aisling, who turns out to be a sort of forest sprite. The rest of the story revolves around Brendan's exploits in order to complete The Book of Kells.The animation is pure magic, it was like seeing the pages of an illuminated manuscript come to life (ok, maybe an extremely well-illustrated graphic novel, but you get my meaning). Each frame is so beautiful, that both my kindergartener and I were completely entranced. Celtic symbolism and mythology permeate the story.
