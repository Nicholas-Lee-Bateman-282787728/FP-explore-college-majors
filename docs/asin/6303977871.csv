393777,ALB3PT6GQ9SJ7,6303977871,Adam Friant,"[2, 5]","I am open minded enough that even though the Rev. Dimmesdale  and  Hester did  commit fornication- as it cannot really be called adultery as they believed Hester's husband to be dead- that does not make what the townspeople in their so-called ""New Jerusalem"" did to ""punish"" Hester right or even morally acceptable in the sight of God.  I found the majority of the locals to be judgemental, overly strict and downright vindictive and jealous from the very moment Hester came to shore early in the film.Not to mention that her husband-who  it turns out was taken by Indians and who shows up later in town-  is no man of God either, and is so filled with revenge for Hester's infedility  with the Reverend (spied upon by a peeping tom in the form of Hester's maidservant) that he becomes blinded by hate and places the uneasy but workeable truce between the towns folk and savages  in serious jeopardy.THE SCARLET LETTER is a moving and all too human tale of people judging one another and being filled with so much hypocrisy that they will do anything to appease what they wrongfully assume to be the will of God-even if it hurts their fellow man. Indeed the only redeemeable part of the town was the old maid who takes pity on Hester-even after the trial and perseuction commences-and aids her in childbirth, while the disheartened Dimmesdale must keep his vow of silence over being the father of Hester's child even though it makes him sick inside-and all the while a vengeful, evil man lurks in the shadows to avenge himself on them all!Gary Oldman-of Harry Potter fame as Sirius Black as well as being known for his portrayals of Ludwig Van Beethoven and a young Commissioner Gordon from Batman- and Demi Moore (known for her work in such hit films as Ghost, G.I.Jane, Striptease and more)  star in this fascinating journey into the heart of man and a woman who fate has conspired to bring them together- only to tear them apart.Order today.",3,"Oldman and Moore Star in This Tale of Greed, Revenge and Human Error",1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1944,"['am', 'open', 'minded', 'enough', 'even', 'Rev', 'Dimmesdale', 'Hester', 'did', 'commit', 'fornication-', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'called', 'adultery', 'believed', 'Hester', 'husband', 'be', 'dead-', 'not', 'make', 'what', 'townspeople', 'so-called', 'New', 'Jerusalem', 'did', 'punish', 'Hester', 'right', 'even', 'morally', 'acceptable', 'sight', 'God', 'found', 'majority', 'locals', 'be', 'judgemental', 'overly', 'strict', 'downright', 'vindictive', 'jealous', 'very', 'moment', 'Hester', 'came', 'shore', 'early', 'film.Not', 'mention', 'husband-who', 'out', 'was', 'taken', 'Indians', 'who', 'up', 'later', 'town-', 'man', 'God', 'so', 'filled', 'revenge', 'Hester', 'infedility', 'Reverend', 'spied', 'peeping', 'tom', 'form', 'Hester', 'maidservant', 'blinded', 'hate', 'uneasy', 'workeable', 'truce', 'towns', 'folk', 'savages', 'serious', 'jeopardy.THE', 'SCARLET', 'LETTER', 'moving', 'too', 'human', 'tale', 'people', 'judging', 'one', 'being', 'filled', 'so', 'much', 'hypocrisy', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'appease', 'what', 'wrongfully', 'assume', 'be', 'will', 'God-even', 'fellow', 'man', 'Indeed', 'only', 'redeemeable', 'part', 'town', 'was', 'old', 'maid', 'who', 'pity', 'Hester-even', 'trial', 'perseuction', 'commences-and', 'aids', 'childbirth', 'disheartened', 'Dimmesdale', 'must', 'keep', 'vow', 'silence', 'being', 'father', 'Hester', 'child', 'even', 'sick', 'inside-and', 'vengeful', 'evil', 'man', 'shadows', 'avenge', 'Gary', 'Oldman-of', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'known', 'portrayals', 'Ludwig', 'Van', 'Beethoven', 'young', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Batman-', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'known', 'work', 'such', 'hit', 'films', 'Ghost', 'G.I.Jane', 'Striptease', 'more', 'star', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'heart', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'fate', 'conspired', 'bring', 'together-', 'only', 'tear', 'apart.Order', 'today']",N/A
393778,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,6303977871,Alexander Arsov,"[3, 4]","===Spoilers ahead!===This movie has been harshly criticized by shallow book lovers who just can't stand the fact that, save the names of the main characters and the basic elements of the plot, it has nothing to do with the novel. True. So what? A movie, too, is supposed to be a work of art, and art must have nothing to do with copying. If you want a movie that follows the book closely, then just read the book* and make the movie inside your head. Every great book can stand such treatment pretty well, and every true book lover - not mindless bookworm who reads for reading's sake - has quite enough imagination for that.Similarly inane criticism of the type ''it has nothing to do with the book'' has been leveled against ''Troy'', ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' and numerous other movies ''based on'', ''adapted from'' or simply ''inspired by'' famous literature. Nobody seems to ask one very sensible question: why should the movie have anything to do with the book? The mediums are completely different; they are to be expected to produce different results. Indeed, they should. Besides, just as prose quality itself is no guarantee of literary greatness, so the fact that a movie is ''freely adapted'' from a novel is no license to pour invective on it. Like any other such movie, ''The Scarlet Letter'' must stand or fall as an independent work of art. For my part, it stands magnificently, for it is the best type of ""adaptation"": the one that uses the original only as an inspiration.(A fascinating parallel with the worlds of theatre and opera can be drawn here. Most opera libretti are derived from plays which are ruthlessly cut and reshaped to suit an entirely different medium. Have you ever heard anybody degrading Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro simply because its libretto is a greatly simplified and weakened version of Beaumarchais literary original? Of course not. What about Verdi's Rigoletto and Hugo's Le roi s'amuse? The same deal. Why? Because for whatever literary value has been lost in the art of adaptation, for it is an art, an ample compensation has been gained thanks to the great music. Likewise with the visual aspects, and not only, of movie adaptations.)I am here to tell you that ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a well-nigh perfect movie in every aspect; and that this ''4,7'' in IMDB is tosh. If you expect, nay if you insist on, literal adaptation of the book, you needn't waste your time with the movie. If you are just a little more open-minded, it's a must-see. I am the walking and the writing proof that one can appreciate both works. The movie was my whole stimulus to read the book, and that has been a remarkably and unexpectedly powerful experience. But the film remains none the less great for that.Both the story and the characters are changed more or less beyond recognition in the screenplay, but none of these changes, so far as I can see, has any detrimental effect. Rather to the contrary. The screenplay is actually more dramatic, with several tremendously effective scenes and hauntingly powerful lines which are entirely new. Observe Hester's receiving the scarlet letter in front of the multitude with the words ''Put it on, for it is not a badge of my sin but your own'', or Reverend Dimmesdale's stirring speech when he, again in front of the crowd, confessed that he loves that woman, that he is the father of her child, that in God's eyes he is her husband, and that ''If you must hang somebody, to appease your anger, and your fear, then hang me!'' - to name but two examples. And who can forget the last words of Pearl, who kind of tells the story: ""Who is to say what is a sin in God's eyes?"" Who indeed?Even more fascinating is the change in the characters. Here again, if anything, the screenplay has indeed improved upon Hawthorne's original. Hester in the book remains convinced that she had committed a dreadful sin, that God will punish her, that her Pearl, perhaps, is something of a witch. But Hester in the movie is to my mind a more inspiring, affecting and likable personality. She defies her elders with a vengeance: ''I believe I have sinned in your eyes. But who is to say if God shares your views?'' She loves and honours the father of her ''sinful'' child and she completely refuses to believe that what happened between her and Dimmesdale has anything to do with sin. In short, the conflict in the movie, as should be expected, is made more extrovert, exchanging as it does the largely psychological one in the novel.Likewise, the passionate and intense Dimmesdale in the movie is a vastly different character than the rather weak and pathetic creature in the book who excites that singular mixture of affection and exasperation. Now, Arthur on the screen is a man thorn asunder by doubt, too. Did he sin? Did he become ''a pollution'' and ''a lie'' in God's eyes? Or in his? But finally, after dramatic fight between different aspects of his personality, the man wins over the pastor completely. If anything, the struggle and the victory are more realistic and more compelling in the movie than in the novel.Hester's lawful - and awful - husband is the only one whose incarnations on the pages and on the screen share some similarity: he is equally detestable in both places. That said, his portrayal in the movie is more brutal but, of course, less subtle than the one in the novel.All in all, all three of the main characters, in addition to being vastly different, are by necessity simplified for the screen. Yet none of them, with the possible exception of the chilling Roger Chillingworth (aka Roger Prynne), is entirely one-dimensional or dull.This is doubtlessly greatly helped by the superb cast. The alluring and passionate Demi Moore as Hester, the long-haired and handsome Gary Oldman as Dimmesdale and the sinister and scary Robert Duvall as Roger all give splendidly vivid performances. The supporting cast is excellent and so are the director's work and the sets. On the whole, the movie is much more of a love story than the novel, but it never degenerates into mere sentimentalizing. If anything, indeed, the puritanical forefathers are rather more harshly condemned, their moral weakness and their odious duplicity being mercilessly exposed. Also, of course, the sensual elements are far more explicit on the screen, but they always remain in perfect taste. The conclusion is rather happier than the one in the novel, but I see no reason to hold this against the value of the movie, either.One last point. The music is superb, too. Composed and conducted by John Barry, the soundtrack is available on CD and cannot be recommended highly enough to all lovers of gorgeous orchestral sound. Note particularly the music for the love scene, which in itself must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ones ever shot. It has a truly puritanical restraint, yet it manages to be compellingly steamy. In combination with strings as intense as anything Sibelius ever composed, and as sensual as anything Wagner created in Tristan, this love scene is a truly wonderful and unforgettable experience.---------------------------------------------------------* I have borrowed this remark from an interview with the slightly crazy Jay Wolpert, the man who wrote the equally notorious in the category ""nothing-to-do-with-the-book"" screenplay of The Count of Monte Cristo, the one with the outstanding Jim Caviezel in the title role. Mr Wolpert's answer to those who criticized him for not keeping close to Dumas' original cannot be bettered: ""Thank you. My job was not to stay close to the book"". Dead right. I also must add that Mr Wolpert is vastly amusing on his introduction of Albert as a son of Monte Cristo: ''I have never understood why Dumas didn't use that.'' In other words, when you can improve the original, don't hesitate to do so.",5,Shamefully misunderstood and underrated,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,7821,"['===Spoilers', 'ahead', '===This', 'movie',

Douglas Day-Stewart, who had already done brilliant screenplays forAn Officer and a Gentleman (Special Collector's Edition), and The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, ""FREELY ADAPTED"" the ponderous Nathaniel Hawthorne novel,already a classic in it's own right, and dared to ""tamper"" with it in order to create a screenplay far different than the book-or did he? The characters are there;Hester Prynne and Rev.Roger Dimmesdale,caught in their ""sin"" of lust and adultery.Prynne, portrayed by Demi Moore, is as feminist as you can get in Puritan American Colonies.The vengeance of the the real husband,Roger Prynne played by Robert DeNiro is seething with vengeance and rage,and the Reverend,Gary Oldman seeks to be true to his love for Hester, while grappling with his own conscience.Now....all of that is in the book. Screenwriter Stewart chose to then build with that material and eliminate other plotlines and characters,change the ending to make ME happy,and voila...there you have it...THE RAZZIE FILM of 1995,directed by Roland Joffe (The Mission (Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Killing FieldsandVatel),whose films have won Oscars, but he is in deed no stranger to the Razzie (Nominated for 2008Captivity (Unrated Widescreen Edition)).I personally found Hawthorne's characters and plot FAR MORE INTERESTING in Day-Stewart's screenplay, than in Hawthorne's book! I may indeed be in the minority, but so? This film kept my attention; I found the chemistry between Moore and Oldman wrenchingly palpable and loved the fact the story actually ended way different than the book! Throw in a soundtrack that cleverly uses the ""Agnus Dei"" from Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" and great cinematography and I embrace and welcome this film,despite any other critiques.I loved it...and that is what films are all about.Read the book if you must or see the PBS version,which is truer to the book,but equally as plodding (The Scarlet Letter...this really PLODS!!!!), or enjoy a brisk and fresh view of sin in the Colonies under Roland Joffe!

393780,AC3064RV9PV62,6303977871,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[2, 2]","Rating: 3.5 stars rounded up***CONTAINS SPOILERS***For the record, I've never read ""The Scarlet Letter."" It's in my TBR pile, but I doubt I'll get to it anytime soon.  I've read other Hawthorne and not been that excited by it. I'm familiar with the synopsis of ""The Scarlet Letter"" so I'm aware the film varies tremendously from the novel.I like this film.  It's entertaining.  I regret missing it on the big screen.  The rental is pan and scan and I know the location shots would be far more stunning in widescreen views.  It's not the greatest film I've ever seen, but it's an attractive historical romance with a lovely soundtrack, solid casting, gorgeous costumes, and a better than average storyline.The script suffers a bit, attempting to combine witchcraft scares and Indian conflicts into the plot.  The issues got spead a bit thin in places.Hester Prynne came across as this extremely proud, independent, self-sacrificing woman.  This is cool given the film's romantic bent, but it got a bit much.  No matter what, Hester stands up to injustice, even when it costs her dearly.  It crossed the line from heroic to ridiculous, especially after the birth of her daughter, Pearl.Arthur Dimmesdale (portrayed by Gary Oldman) is an artless, charming, innocent man.  A bit too conveniently innocent at times.  The script does its best to portray Arthur as a good man and a passive figure in the more dramatic events in the story.  He comes across as very gentle, intellectual, and sensitive. But it's hard to look past his more cowardly moments.  The storyline suggests Hester is the more dominant figure in the couple and she essentially chooses to challenge the establishment while demanding her lover's silence to protect him.  The script also takes artistic license to create urgency on Hester's part -- Arthur will suffer death by hanging should Hester name him the father of her child. This is understandable, but not really admirable in a romantic hero.  He's no ""alpha male"" by any means.Robert Duvall (Roger Prynne/Chillingworth) ""takes over"" the film an hour or so into the action.  He's a disturbed, menacing, soft-spoken villain with an inner Jack the Ripper lingering oh so near the surface.  Conflict boils between him and Hester and adds to the story's tension.  The film is worth watching simply to watch the incredible tightrope balance Duvall walks in portraying this villain, equal parts sinister and sympathetic.Support casting is excellent.  I wish the writers could have come up with a more original name for Hester's female slave, Mituba (a nod to Tituba of the Salem witch trials.) One success of this film was the ability to create a diversity of characters much like a real life small town community.  Not everyone in the colony was a starched shirt and a hypocrite, I appreciate that.Another problem: the film seemed to want to comment socially on feminism, racism, religious discrimination and hypocrisy.  Witchcraft trials and Indian conflicts (echoing ""Last of the Mohicans) spread the plot a bit thin considering the heated love triangle between Hester, Arthur, and Roger. The expansion on Hester and Arthur's love story and Roger's derrangement eat miles of word count and screen time,leaving these other features feeling a bit ""thrown in.""The dialogue is interesting and eloquent and the cast executes it nicely.  I think the conversations sound like credible conversations historical people might have.  The soundtrack and lighting is dreamily beautiful.Costume lovers will eat up this film.  Like the diversity of the colonists (social class, economic status) various styles representing the era feature prominently throughout the film.

This is absurd reasoning, as a remake of any sort invites comparisons by its very nature.  It is particularly pointless in this case, because even if there had been no novel to compare it with, ""The Scarlet Letter"" would still have been an embarassing flop.Although obstensibly set in a 17th century Puritan community, the movie makes no attempt whatsoever to establish time and place through characterization or action.  Demi Moore's character is a free thinking, independant woman who befriends her pagan neighbors (who act like stereotypical hippies) and politely ignores the scorn of the town elders.  In other words, she's a cool 90's chick.  Gary Oldman is a strong yet sensitive type with a goatee, respectful to women and the local native tribes.  He's a cool 90's dude.  Granted there have been independant thinkers in every age, but this degree of anachronism makes about as much sense as a caveman invenitng a computer out of rocks and hides.Since Demi and Gary are both free-thinkers in a repressive (i.e. uncool) society, you just know they're going to get together as soon as Demi's husband dies.  When she ends up pregnant though, and her husband turns out to be alive, she just accepts the situation and moves on with self-assured smugness.  Of course, her uncool neighbors can't accept this situation, but no matter how much they condemn her, it only makes Demi's resolve stronger.  For his part, Gary longs to reveal himself as the father (sensitive guy that he is) but Demi insists that he remain quiet so she can nobly go endure the community's ire alone.  Of course, you just know they'll end up together in the end.Perhaps the worst thing about ""The Scarlet Letter"" is the numerous missed opportunities to inject emotionally mature drama.  Demi's character is a born and raised Puritan, shouldn't she feel some guilt and shame over her situation?  Why is Gary, a man from a patriarchal society, submissively letting Demi tell him what to do?  Does the Puritan community have any sense of structure and purpose besides condeming people?  Unfortunately, none of these angles are explored.  Instead we are supposed to focus solely on the juvenile, ""this couple is too cool for their environment"" plotline.Yes there is a steamy sex-scene, but so what?  Perhaps if they had steered the movie more in this direction, they could have made it a stimulating (but still silly) bit of erotica.

A couple of years ago I reread the book and it's really great, however, that did not diminish one bit the enjoyment I derive from watching this &quot;freely adapted&quot; version.I guess one could say, that there were lots &amp; lots of inconsistencies regarding authencicity, like Hester's &quot;Conciousness raising group&quot; and the fact that she would go into town &amp; buy soap instead making her own.  Also, no Seventeenth Century woman in her right mind would think Arthur Dimmsdale was a &quot;catch&quot;, in fact, I can't think of any Twenteith Century woman that would.  But who cares?  Reverend Dimmsdale was very sexy &amp; so cute!!!  If I was Hester, I would have been dragging him into the barn way before she did.  The only criticism I have is that it would have added to the story to draw out the development of Hester &amp; Arthur's relationship longer to give the story more romantic tension.  Also, I would have liked to see more love scenes.In closing let me say that The Scarlet Letter is like a really fattening snack that has no nutritional value.

I did enjoy this movie, and I dpon't  mind saying that I did. Demi Moore's performance of Hester Prynne was truly  spectatular, showing that the women back in Puritan times did not always  conform to the rules. Performances by other actors as well as the  townspeople deserve credit as well, and the stunning score, composed by  John Barry, is truly haunting and wonderful.

On the other hand, if one can look past this, the Scarlet Letter is engaging and passionate filmmaking.  Although Demi Moore is not especially interesting in the role of Hester Prynne, Gary Oldman delivers one of his better performances in the role of the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale.  The supporting cast (including luminaries of the British stage like Joan Plowright, Roy Dotrice and Edward Hardwicke) are even more impressive.  Robert Duvall is thoroughly hair-raising as Rodger Prynne (who returns to Hester a raving madman after years in the wilderness).Though set in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the film was actually shot in the Pacific Northwest (and one wonders what all those giant Douglas Firs are doing in New England!), but this is all part of the stylized (albeit sometimes over-the-top) approach of director Roland Joffe.

The soundtrack was gorgeous, very Dancing with Wolves.The first half of the movie helped to clarify what Hawthorne's novel, the Scarlett Letter, left vague and unclear. The rest of the movie, however, seemed to miss what the novel intended by a mile.The last scene should have been Hester, Arthur Dimmesdale, Pearl and Roger Prynne all on that scaffold together, with Arthur dying, clutching his heart. This is a very rich, layered and operatic scene. It was non-existent in the movie.Sometimes you wonder if the people who produced the movie even read the novel. Arthur Dimmesdale's character, specifically, is supposed to be losing strength because he's weakening under living a lie. But he looked powerful and strong to me, running around, riding a horse. Arthur was also supposed to be seen clutching his heart on occasions (it's to signify the pain he is under while choosing to live a lie). This is all very clear in the novel, and you don't even have to read all that closely to pick up on these key actions.And when you start cutting and changing from what the novel intended, then the rest of the story starts to fall apart. The second half of the novel picks up when Pearl is 7 years old. In the movie, by trying to do the whole thing while Pearl is a baby, we miss out on some deeply thematic and layered scenes. In the novel, Pearl is a feisty child, she refused to let Arthur Dimmesdale kiss her, because she can't understand how Arthur can hug her in private, but ignore her and her mother in public. Since Pearl is a baby in the movie, instead of a precocious 7-year-old, she can't express much of this, can she? No.Character transformations. Weak! The novel mapped this out for the screenwriters, too! But because of all the changes, the character transformations go virtually undetected. In the movie, Hester is defiant and powerful from the beginning. That's not the case in the novel. Sure she's defiant, but it's very nuanced, but nonetheless, Hester is still weak in the beginning. And towards the end of the novel, Hester gained more and more strength, while her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, weakens, and so did Roger Prynne as a matter of fact; Roger was consumed by his own jealousy. These transformations happened toward the end almost one after the next, like a symphony coming to a close. This is what makes the novel a classic.But for what it's worth the movie was entertaining, at least.

I felt warned. I did not, however, feel prepared for the eventual massacre of some of Hawthorne's richest themes in this tale.The opening scene makes it clear the story will veer far from its source material when we are introduced to Native Americans and the building animosity between them and the local colonists. We then meet attractive and self-assured Hester Prynne (Demi Moore) as she arrives from England, part of the latest batch of villagers to come under the thumb of Puritanical leaders. As Hester looks for a seaside house for her and her husband, who has sent her on ahead, she is waylaid by a licentious young man. He's not the first to cast an eye upon the fair maiden, and soon the town's minister, played by Gary Oldman, becomes equally enchanted by this headstrong woman. Their obvious attraction for each other is held in check by propriety, morality, and the ever-watching eyes of the religious authorities. Later, though, evidence indicates that Hester's husband has been murdered by Indians, and she is free at last from those domestic restraints to pursue her shared attraction with the lonely minister.We are over 2/3 of the way through the story before it shows any signs of following the book. Yes, the first hour and fifteen minutes could have happened, as part of the story's setup; and yes, Moore and Oldham are competent actors for this script. Sadly, however, the ham-handed attempts to build racial and religious tension fail to catch the subtleties in Hawthorne's writing. In fact, there are probably less than five lines of dialogue taken from the actual book. Robert Duvall overacts his part. The lighting is romanticized. The violence is upgraded. The sensuality is on full display. A strange element of voodoo is thrown in for greater drama. As the movie steams toward its climax, the director seems hellbent on throwing aside all of that which made Hawthorne's message work. In fact, the lead characters ride off into the sunset (saved in the final moments by a scene stolen from ""Robin Hood""), whereas the book shows Hester being freed by her daily confession of sin while the minister's very health is threatened by the concealment of his own own.I'm a big Hawthorne fan, and ""The Scarlet Letter"" is my favorite of his novels. I'm also a fan of some of Demi Moore's movies, and Gary Oldman has some fine moments (such as in the recent ""Book of Eli""). What could have been a fantastic pairing with a strong script falls prey to Hollywood's insistence on more action, more sex, more violence, and less depth.

The love story is kept, except that it was secret in most of the book and is made public for us the audience from the very start. The vengeance part of the story is emphasized by the Indian war that this vengeful ex-husband starts out of pure perversity since he has nothing to win out of it, far from it, since it will mean his own end in his own guilt like a revenge turned sour. The witch part is definitely emphasized too, even too much, but does not reach the level of the Crucible, even if it is in a way the same pattern that is followed. Here the film does not miss but rather avoids the fundamental point of the Crucible : witch-hunting was a political activity covering the greed of some landowners for the land of their neighbors. And we completely miss the nature part of the original story. All these drawbacks and shortcomings are compensated with a lot of love, passion, frustration and desire. The two main actors are brilliant in expressing the most extreme passion repressed and hidden away with pure willpower and maybe some condescending rejection for this society that was born in the dream of the freedom of a New Jerusalem and ended up in the drama and tragedy of the darkest and cruellest human passion, hatred based on jealousy.

393806,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,6303977871,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[5, 11]","The theme of ""The Scarlet Letter"" is timeless. We are reminded of the beauty of Nathaniel Hawthorne's vision throughout the 1995 film version, even if it is not an exact adaptation of the text. The film would be more accurately described as a re-imagined form of the novel, committed to screen with just as much passion and originality. The film, like the novel, is a vision all its own, and those faithful to Hawthorne's original work will likely be unhappy with the film for that reason.However, the most faithful film adaptations of novels are rarely the most entertaining--for then, what would be the point of a film version if nothing new and insightful or creative could be added?  A film version of a novel offers very little room for creativity and expression on the part of the writers, because everything is taken from something previously written, so often writers are inclined to leave their own mark on a masterpiece--in this case, ""The Scarlet Letter.""What results is a film with the same underlying theme, but with an entirely different execution. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is an inventive and arresting enough film that it should be judged with some separation from the novel. The film possesses certain qualities that make it nearly a masterpiece, such as John Barry's score, rich with deliriously lush strings and recurring melodies. The cinematography is another asset--grand with vivid colors and picturesque, romantic scenery. Puritan settings are recreated with eye-catching splendor.It is the romantic nature of the film, as well as the timeless message, that will hold the viewer. A strength of the film is that, although the central love story is heightened, we never lose sense of the story's meaning: ""Who is to say what is a sin in god's eyes?"" (the last line of the film). This is still a controversial view, and perhaps the book did not make that outright claim (for the novel is open for interpretation). The film, however, does make that interpretation, and it is a powerful one that may explain some of the controversy surrounding the film. In this day, with such political topics as gay marriage on the table, this subject is more relevant than ever (and very controversial).Demi Moore is the star of ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and Hester Prynne was unquestionably the most daring role of her career. I feel many have been unfair with their appraisals of her performance. Moore is a very good, but perhaps not great actress. She was wise to approach Hester Prynne with restraint, but her performance is not without nuance. It is a sensitive, unforgettable performance and Moore's finest achievement.The film does have its flaws, undoubtedly. The character of Matuba is under-developed. Some of the sex scenes are over-the-top, such as the use of candles as phallic symbols. Robert Duvall is slightly hammy as the insane doctor, held captive and released by Indians. There are some unnecessary scenes and some unnecessary dialogue, which suggests what the film needed most was a good editor (and perhaps that would have made all the difference, as the film runs well over two hours).The flaws of ""The Scarlet Letter"" can easily be over-looked, if one is open-minded to a new vision of Hawthorne's work and the still-controversial theme (and interpretation the film takes). Religious views sometimes imprison us from being with the people we truly love--in Hester's case, she was unable to be with the man she loved (and the father of her child) because of a sin known as adultery and the punishment (death, banishment, the scarlet letter ""A"" for adultery Hester had to wear on her dress as a symbol of sin) Puritans provided.  But is that really right--to punish for god?  That is what the novel and film ask us, only the film leads us to an answer (and a happy ending).The film is controversial because it answers the question.  If you love someone, the film tells us, it is okay to be with them even if in religious opinion it is considered a sin. It was a bold statement, and in my opinion a true and beautiful one.Let us remember what Oscar Wilde once said about works of art (which this film surely is) that spark debate: ""Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.""  If one applies that to the novel, written over a hundred years ago, then we know that the theme is still timeless. And if applied to the film--we know it was completely new. Something to be said for a film that takes a 150 year-old theme and makes it new again.",5,"""Who is to say what is a sin in god's eyes?""",1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,4503,"['theme', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'timeless', 'are', 'reminded', 'beauty', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'vision', '1995', 'film', 'version', 'even', 'not', 'exact', 'adaptation', 'text', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurately', 'described', 're-imagined', 'form', 'novel', 'committed', 'screen', 'just', 'much', 'passion', 'originality', 'film', 'novel', 'vision', 'own', 'faithful', 'Hawthorne', 'original', 'work', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'unhappy', 'film', 'reason.However', 'most', 'faithful', 'film', 'adaptations', 'novels', 'are', 'rarely', 'most', 'entertaining', 'then', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'film', 'version', 'nothing', 'new', 'insightful', 'creative', 'could', 'be', 'added', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'offers', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'creativity', 'expression', 'part', 'writers', 'everything', 'taken', 'something', 'previously', 'written', 'so', 'often', 'writers', 'are', 'inclined', 'leave', 'own', 'mark', 'masterpiece', 'case', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'What', 'results', 'film', 'same', 'underlying', 'theme', 'entirely', 'different', 'execution', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'inventive', 'arresting', 'enough', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'separation', 'novel', 'film', 'certain', 'qualities', 'make', 'nearly', 'masterpiece', 'such', 'John', 'Barry', 'score', 'rich', 'deliriously', 'lush', 'strings', 'recurring', 'melodies', 'cinematography', 'asset', 'grand', 'vivid', 'colors', 'picturesque', 'romantic', 'scenery', 'Puritan', 'settings', 'are', 'recreated', 'eye-catching', 'splendor.It', 'romantic', 'nature', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'timeless', 'message', 'will', 'hold', 'viewer', 'strength', 'film', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'heightened', 'never', 'lose', 'sense', 'story', 'meaning', 'Who', 'say', 'what', 'sin', 'god', 'eyes', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'still', 'controversial', 'view', 'perhaps', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'outright', 'claim', 'novel', 'open', 'interpretation', 'film', 'however', 'make', 'interpretation', 'powerful', 'one', 'may', 'explain', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'film', 'day', 'such', 'political', 'topics', 'gay', 'marriage', 'table', 'subject', 'more', 'relevant', 'ever', 'very', 'controversial', '.Demi', 'Moore', 'star', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'Hester', 'Prynne', 'was', 'unquestionably', 'most', 'daring', 'role', 'career', 'feel', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'unfair', 'appraisals', 'performance', 'Moore', 'very', 'good', 'perhaps', 'not', 'great', 'actress', 'was', 'wise', 'approach', 'Hester', 'Prynne', 'restraint', 'performance', 'not', 'nuance', 'sensitive', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'Moore', 'finest', 'achievement.The', 'film', 'have', 'flaws', 'undoubtedly', 'character', 'Matuba', 'under-developed', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'such', 'use', 'candles', 'phallic', 'symbols', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'slightly', 'hammy', 'insane', 'doctor', 'held', 'captive', 'released', 'Indians', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'unnecessary', 'dialogue', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'most', 'was', 'good', 'editor', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'film', 'well', 'two', 'hours', '.The', 'flaws', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'over-looked', 'one', 'open-minded', 'new', 'vision', 'Hawthorne', 'work', 'still-controversial', 'theme', 'interpretation', 'film', 'Religious', 'views', 'sometimes', 'imprison', 'being', 'people', 'truly', 'love', 'Hester', 'case', 'was', 'unable', 'be', 'man', 'loved', 'father', 'child', 'sin', 'known', 'adultery', 'punishment', 'death', 'banishment', 'scarlet', 'letter', 'A', 'adultery', 'Hester', 'had', 'wear', 'dress', 'symbol', 'sin', 'Puritans', 'provided', 'really', 'right', 'punish', 'god', 'what', 'novel', 'film', 'ask', 'only', 'film', 'answer', 'happy', 'ending', '.The', 'film', 'controversial', 'question', 'love', 'someone', 'film', 'okay', 'be', 'even', 'religious', 'opinion', 'considered', 'sin', 'was', 'bold', 'statement', 'opinion', 'true', 'beautiful', 'one.Let', 'remember', 'what', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'once', 'said', 'works', 'art', 'film', 'surely', 'spark', 'debate', 'Diversity', 'opinion', 'work', 'art', 'shows', 'work', 'new', 'complex', 'vital', 'one', 'novel', 'written', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'know', 'theme', 'still', 'timeless', 'applied', 'film', 'know', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'Something', 'be', 'said', 'film', '150', 'year-old', 'theme', 'new', 'again']",N/A

It says it is &quot;freely adapted from the novel&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne.  Then it goes on to tell the famous story through the eyes of twentieth century feminism, sexual freedom and politically correct happy endings.  I must admit I never did read the book, but I've long been aware of the general plot, set in 1666,  of an adulteress forced to wear the scarlet letter &quot;A&quot;.Demi Moore is cast as Hester Pryne, the adulteress, and we all know what's going to happen to her.  She's been sent to America to establish a home; her husband is supposed to be following soon.  She shocks the good people of the Massachusetts Bay Colony when she insists on living alone, with the help of a couple of bondsmen and a female black slave.  I doubt if Hawthorne's book then had the local minister, played by Gary Oldman, do a little nude swimming on Hester's property.  I also doubt that Hawthorne had her peeking, getting excited and sensuously soaking in a bathtub, displaying her own nude body and thinking about the pastor. The couple declare their love for each other but it is only after they think her husband dead that they consummate their relationship.  Her pregnancy is a crime and she spends the last six months of her confinement in a horrible prison.  Then she is forced to wear the scarlet letter and is shunned by all.  She refuses to name her lover, and so Oldman sulks around town, looking guilty but keeping his mouth shut.  This is a great role for any actress, but Demi Moore just can't handle it. She might have a nice body but the expression on her face seems to be frozen, incapable of the subtleties, passion and despair that the role calls for.  Gary Oldman is slightly better, but his portrayal of the weakling pastor is also one-dimensional.The film is saved, however, by the role of Robert Duvall, who appears late, but yet steals the show with his impassioned portrayal of the wronged husband bent on revenge.  He dominates every scene he's in and a single expression on his face tells more about his character than the combined performances of the rest of the entire cast.  The story is a good one, and it moved fast enough to hold my interest, especially since there were some action scenes added that Hawthorne had probably never intended.

As for this rendition, it is just taking a few key concepts from the book and the rest is from the writers imagination.You're probably wondering why I gave this movie 5 stars. Well, for one, it has Demi Moore and Gary Oldman. Demi Moore is not one of my favorites, but she fits this role nicley. Gary Oldman has not been in many substantial roles in movies, but I like him in anything he does. Not to mention, he is gorgeous in this movie...and you get to see quite a bit of him...let's just say it's not for the kids. Either way, I thought both of them did an amazing job and they have great chemistry with each other that is perfect for their roles. You can feel the emotion in every scene.Now, I would say this is more for the girls than the guys. It's a great movie to watch alone with a bowl of popcorn and tissues close by.

Underestimating the intelligence of movie audiences and overestimating Demi Moore's odd, narcisstic comment, this movie fails to entertain, with literary and historical accuracy, and turns into a shrill preformance by Demi.Based on the novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter is the tale of Hester Pryne, a young woman who has come to the new world to join her Puritain bretheran in their establishment in the New World.  Here, Hester settles in, sent ahead by her husband to set up a home.  Hester meets the Dimsdale, the town minister.  Fighting the obvious attraction they feel for one another, they bond over their love of books and the written word.  They will inevitably have an affair, Hester becomes pregnant, and is forced to live in shame and humiliation with a red letter A pinned to her chest.  She refuses to reveil her child's father's identity, and the good reverand lives in secret shame over their affair.I gave this movie a shot thinking that as the book (yes, I read the book, Ms. Moore!) begins with Hester being in prison having just had her child.  I was looking forward to seeing how the relationship began, but it was trite.  Their love for one another is obvious, I'm surprised no one suspected things.  The story falls apart from there, as we get into an odd subplot with the tensions between the native Algonquin Indians (which was not in the book).  Hester's husband comes to America, as promised, and is captured by the natives.  Thinking him dead allows Hester to indulge in the affair with the minister which she didn't seem to have much concern for in the book.  There is no concern on the part of the good reverand for relations between his community and that of the natives, and, certainly none on the part of Hester's husband in condeming his unfaithful wife and her child.  I won't go from there about how the rest of the story deviates from the book and goes into a poor movie, because that's what it was, poor.If they had devised this plot as an independent movie rather than saying it was based on the book, maybe it would have done a bit better.

Since I just saw The Scarlet Letter on video (AGAIN-- I also saw it in a theatre; I'm a masochist, and I forgot to take my purple pill that day). I'm speaking of Demi Moore.This is at least the fifth version of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, so I suppose the producers' biggest problem was differentiating their version from the earlier ones. &quot;Oh, I know!&quot; exclaimed some bright young executive. &quot;Let's show Pearl's conception!&quot; We'll do the sexy version. Now you have to understand, even by Victorian standards Hawthorne is long winded, so I think that if Hawthorne had wanted us to know what happened before Hester went to prison, he would have told us. And told us, and told us. But since Ms. Moore only makes films where she gets to roll back her head and writhe, alterations were necessary.And let's get one thing straight: Hester Prynne was no proto-feminist, no Sylvia Pankhurst purposefully having an illegitimate child as an up-the-establishment of marriage. Hester made exactly one mistake in her whole life. In every other respect she was the model Puritan goodwife. That was Hawthorne's whole point, that we should judge people on their good works, not on the worst things they've ever done. But you'd never guess that from this film, which I can't even recommend to insomniacs, because just when you're getting comfortable, somebody lets out one of those soulful screams that, in this film, substitutes for character development.Aside from lousy acting, though, this is more than just a departure from the book; this is a fatally flawed film. From the moment Hester arrives in the colony, she is scandalizing people left and right. She lives alone, and then buys herself a BATHTUB (gasp! nekked before the LORD) a HAT double gasp!!) no bonnets for this independent woman. You can actually see her HAIR (triple gasp!!!) and the hat is adorned with a very long, white feather, which if it's historically correct, someone in costuming is having a good laugh, because it must be a turkey feather. The Hester of this film is a tar barrel away from being run out of town before she ever turns up pregnant. There were other colonial towns, some more tolerant than the one where she lived, and there were Native tribes willing to take in Europeans. Hester had plenty of places to go, rather than stay around and take abuse.The Hester of the book stays around because she believes in the ideals and the religion of the colony, doesn't believe there's a better place to go, believes she has sinned, believes she deserves what she has gotten, and wants to stay there and raise her child there, because a child already tainted with illegitimacy needs all the help she can get. Moore's Hester, pregnant, and knowing she could be arrested, would probably have packed up her bathtub, pulled on her hat at a rakish angle, and been gone by sunup.The screenwriters, or the producers, or both seem not to know this. It's hard to say they are simply ignorant; my suspicion is that they think the public is. I am delighted that this picture flopped, because Hollywood may have gotten a message about what it can get away with.For lack of anything better to do while I sat through this mess, I tried to recall all of Demi Moore's movies.First, was Ghost, which might as well have been called All Good-looking White People Go to Heaven. In Scarlet Letter, she writhesin hay; Ghost, she writhes in clay. Indecent Proposal? that's the one where she does her writhing in a pile of money. In Disclosure, she writhes on a mahogany desk. I didn't see A Few Good Men, but I saw the posters of her in her dress blues. Does she writhe in them? THAT might be worth $6.50.Professional writhing.

393829,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6303977871,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[1, 1]","For my point of view ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a good film with great performances... All the actors do a superb job... I was worried that Demi Moore might not have the range to handle the role of Mistress Prynne, but she is excellent... She is strong, passionate, intelligent and damaged... In another place and time she might have been a leader; in this movie she is quite believable as the woman who defends her love at all costs... Gary Oldman looks perfect as Reverend Dimmesdale... He projects force and sexual magnetism along with the guilt for his sin...The film opens in 1666 when Hester Prynne (Demi Moore) arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony filled with hope that here, at last, in this new World, would come the freedom to worship without fear or persecution... She didn't suspect that beyond the trees there is a savage land of savage passions dark and untamed, and that soon she will face a scornful community in which she will forever be shamed by the scarlet letter...Mistress Prynne rejected the idea of staying in the congregation until her husband's arrival and looked for a house of her own... She finds a beautiful and frightening place, just as 'Eden must have been so untouched...'On one Sabbath morning, Hester met Reverend Dimmesdale (Gary Oldman) who helps her when her cart got stuck in the woods... She truly enjoyed, few minutes later, his sermon ... It was rare, for her, to find a man so young and fiery who could speak with such force of passion... She was moved by his passion...Dimmesdale thought that comprehending God was going to be his greatest challenge, but--after he met Hester--he was not the man he seems to be... He lost his power before this seductress beautiful woman... He lived in this township his whole life and his purpose was clear... But now he would risk everything--his life, his ministry, his soul--just to spend a few moments alone with her... After he asked her why that morning in the forest, she didn't say that she is married, he wondered how she were able to see so deeply into his nature...From that moment, two hearts were there struggling against a love that grew stronger with each passing day...Hester was courteous enough but her tongue knew no rules... She earned more than a few reprimands in her life for speaking too bluntly... With a frightening strength, she challenged her persecutors and stood up to their hypocrisy, refusing to reveal her lover's identity...""The Scarlet Letter"" compels us to recognize the shadow side of our lives, including this passion that pushes us beyond our limits... The climax also compels us to contemplate about whether there is anything that we would be willing to die for...",3,"""Who is to say what is a sin in God's eyes?""",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2683,"['point', 'view', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'do', 'superb', 'job', 'was', 'worried', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'range', 'handle', 'role', 'Mistress', 'Prynne', 'excellent', 'strong', 'passionate', 'intelligent', 'damaged', 'place', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'leader', 'movie', 'quite', 'believable', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'costs', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'perfect', 'Reverend', 'Dimmesdale', 'projects', 'force', 'sexual', 'magnetism', 'guilt', 'sin', 'film', '1666', 'when', 'Hester', 'Prynne', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'arrived', 'Massachusetts', 'Bay', 'Colony', 'filled', 'hope', 'here', 'last', 'new', 'World', 'would', 'come', 'freedom', 'worship', 'fear', 'persecution', 'did', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'trees', 'savage', 'land', 'savage', 'passions', 'dark', 'untamed', 'soon', 'will', 'face', 'scornful', 'community', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'shamed', 'scarlet', 'letter', 'Mistress', 'Prynne', 'rejected', 'idea', 'staying', 'congregation', 'husband', 'arrival', 'looked', 'house', 'own', 'beautiful', 'frightening', 'place', 'just', ""'Eden"", 'must', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'untouched', 'one', 'Sabbath', 'morning', 'Hester', 'met', 'Reverend', 'Dimmesdale', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'when', 'cart', 'got', 'stuck', 'woods', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'sermon', 'was', 'rare', 'find', 'man', 'so', 'young', 'fiery', 'who', 'could', 'speak', 'such', 'force', 'passion', 'was', 'moved', 'passion', 'Dimmesdale', 'thought', 'comprehending', 'God', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'met', 'Hester', 'was', 'not', 'man', 'be', 'lost', 'power', 'seductress', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'lived', 'township', 'whole', 'life', 'purpose', 'was', 'clear', 'now', 'would', 'risk', 'everything', 'life', 'ministry', 'soul', 'just', 'spend', 'few', 'moments', 'alone', 'asked', 'why', 'morning', 'forest', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'married', 'wondered', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'so', 'deeply', 'nature', 'moment', 'two', 'hearts', 'were', 'there', 'struggling', 'love', 'grew', 'stronger', 'passing', 'day', 'Hester', 'was', 'courteous', 'enough', 'tongue', 'knew', 'rules', 'earned', 'more', 'few', 'reprimands', 'life', 'speaking', 'too', 'bluntly', 'frightening', 'strength', 'challenged', 'persecutors', 'stood', 'up', 'hypocrisy', 'refusing', 'reveal', 'lover', 'identity', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'compels', 'recognize', 'shadow', 'side', 'lives', 'including', 'passion', 'limits', 'climax', 'also', 'contemplate', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'die']",N/A

She ends up in a conservative community, who are rather shocked with her modern ways of dealing with certain things.When Hester's husband travels to the new world, he is believed to be murdered by the Indians. She falls in love with the Reverend Dimmsdale (Oldman), whose feelings match hers. Out of their love, a child is conceived. However, since her husband hasn't been proven dead, the child is seen by the community as being born out of wedlock.The conservative and very religious communion demands Hester to name the father of the child, which she denies. She's locked up in prison and has her baby there, while Dimmsdale is torn over whether to step forward as the baby's father.Hester then is freed but ordered to walk around town wearing a Scarlet Letter 'A', which is meant to belittle her whereever she goes.Shortly after the child is born, her husband (Robert Duvall) suddenly reappears, and tries to incite the indians (whom he befriended) to act against the community. Single-handedly, he manages to offset the fragile peace that was between the two peoples.Moore doesn't do too bad of a job as Hester, Duvall is good as the husband, but Oldman still manages to steal the show.

It states up front that the story is 'freely based' on the Hawthorne story.  And so what of it?  The film was photographed beautifully, the cast is good and I was entertained.  What more is there?  The only thing that disappoints me about the DVD is that it's full screen.  I had the laserdisc of this movie years ago and it was Panavision 2.35:1.  I'm hoping they'll come out with a Blu Ray version as really like the movie.  Purist can whine about something more constructive.",4,True to the Classic Story?  No....  Enjoyable Film?

Were it mathematically possible, I'd give this cinematic train wreck negative zero stars and then apply an exponent!!!  However, since that is an obvious impossibility, I'll just confine myself to offering up the following diatribe; here it goes:This horror show disguised as an ""adaptation"" of the greatest American novel ever penned was indeed painful to watch. Having read Hawthorne's brilliant masterpiece numerous times, this movie was an abysmal disappointment...indeed a bastardization of a classic! When approaching a great literary-work-turned-motion-picture, I quite frankly, do not expect it ever to live up to the book; however, this screenplay missed many apparent opportunities to explore a number of themes that would have made the visual presentation of the novel much more riveting. To inject 20th century characterizations into a drama set 3 centuries prior (in the Massachusetts Bay Colony) was absolutely ludicrous. Having said all that, the greatest insult to the novel, was the alternate ending the director concocted, with Hester and the Rev. triumphantly riding off into the sunset! How utterly absurd, and yes sophomoric, and yes too ""Hollywood!""  The screenwriter's justification of these 2 characters diminished the power and the significance of the story's premise. By contrast, the novel's ending conveyed the strong message of sin and atonement Hawthorne intended; Hester having become liberated through her own penitence, while the Rev. Dimmesdale became encumbered by consuming infirmities due to his keeping his iniquities hidden from public examination. I've enjoyed reading The Scarlet Letter since high school, and I completely concur with the evaluations of my fellow reviewers who decry the tragedy of this failed attempt at bringing to film one of the greatest seminal works of American genius. Thank you all for your thoughtful and inspired comments. Nathaniel Hawthorne's moving masterwork of the human condition, i.e. man's struggle with fleshly appetites and the consequences thereof in juxtaposition to the redemptive work of contrition has been reduced to a convoluted macabre farce of who hangs and for what...only to hang no one in the end due to a senseless and contrived Indian uprising. I understand the concept of creative license, but to stray so terribly far from the original text sadly marginalizes Hawthorne's powerful message of transgression and redemption, hypocrisy and tolerance.Peace!",1,MORTIFIED!!!,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2489,"['Hawthorne', 'likely', 'spinning', 'grave', 'Were', 'mathematically', 'possible', ""'d"", 'give', 'cinematic', 'train', 'wreck', 'negative', 'zero', 'stars', 'then', 'apply', 'exponent', 'However', 'obvious', 'impossibility', ""'ll"", 'just', 'confine', 'offering', 'up', 'following', 'diatribe', 'here', 'horror', 'show', 'disguised', 'adaptation', 'greatest', 'American', 'novel', 'ever', 'penned', 'was', 'indeed', 'painful', 'watch', 'Having', 'read', 'Hawthorne', 'brilliant', 'masterpiece', 'numerous', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'abysmal', 'disappointment', 'indeed', 'bastardization', 'classic', 'When', 'approaching', 'great', 'literary-work-turned-motion-picture', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'ever', 'live', 'up', 'book', 'however', 'screenplay', 'missed', 'many', 'apparent', 'opportunities', 'explore', 'number', 'themes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'visual', 'presentation', 'novel', 'much', 'more', 'riveting', 'inject', '20th', 'century', 'characterizations', 'drama', 'set', '3', 'centuries', 'prior', 'Massachusetts', 'Bay', 'Colony', 'was', 'absolutely', 'ludicrous', 'Having', 'said', 'greatest', 'insult', 'novel', 'was', 'alternate', 'ending', 'director', 'concocted', 'Hester', 'Rev', 'triumphantly', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'How', 'utterly', 'absurd', 'yes', 'sophomoric', 'yes', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'justification', '2', 'characters', 'diminished', 'power', 'significance', 'story', 'premise', 'contrast', 'novel', 'ending', 'conveyed', 'strong', 'message', 'sin', 'atonement', 'Hawthorne', 'intended', 'Hester', 'having', 'become', 'liberated', 'own', 'penitence', 'Rev', 'Dimmesdale', 'became', 'encumbered', 'consuming', 'infirmities', 'due', 'keeping', 'iniquities', 'hidden', 'public', 'examination', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'high', 'school', 'completely', 'concur', 'evaluations', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'who', 'decry', 'tragedy', 'failed', 'attempt', 'bringing', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'seminal', 'works', 'American', 'genius', 'Thank', 'thoughtful', 'inspired', 'comments', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'moving', 'masterwork', 'human', 'condition', 'i.e', 'man', 'struggle', 'fleshly', 'appetites', 'consequences', 'thereof', 'juxtaposition', 'redemptive', 'work', 'contrition', 'been', 'reduced', 'convoluted', 'macabre', 'farce', 'who', 'hangs', 'what', 'only', 'hang', 'one', 'end', 'due', 'senseless', 'contrived', 'Indian', 'uprising', 'understand', 'concept', 'creative', 'license', 'stray', 'so', 'terribly', 'far', 'original', 'text', 'sadly', 'Hawthorne', 'powerful', 'message', 'transgression', 'redemption', 'hypocrisy', 'tolerance.Peace']",N/A
