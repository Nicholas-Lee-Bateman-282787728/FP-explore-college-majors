She goes on a trip to find out about her birth mother and what ensues is a confrontation. I found the premise incredibly hard to believe. At 24 weeks which is beginning of third trimester you cant have elective abortions. Why would a woman have an elective abortion at 24 weeks? They made the birth mother sound selfish for wanting an education and a career. They also severely misrepresented claims of ""tissue."" Seriously at 24 weeks that's no early 1st trimester elective abortion. The woman doesn't even have any scarring or  other indications that she was aborted. One would not look like she did if she survived an abortion (not to mention the skeptical premise that one ""survives"" abortion). The claim that she was the result of an abortion also seems sketchy because in the movie when she is talking with the nurse who aided the doctor  she is told that her birth mother went into labor.

I am so grateful that it was a Christian video showing the other side; the horrible ramifications of seeking/getting an abortion. Typically in this world we hear one side pushed down our throats from youth to old age. Pro-Choice is so touted in this world that we make the choice to accept it as normal and okay, until you find out the ugly side of it.I learned so much from this movie. I now realize the issues with being Pro-Choice. Why? It ruins the life of the lady who makes the choice and the possible child either does not get a chance, or if its a ""failed attempt"", the child is forever scarred with the idea that they have a lot of health issues and were not wanted. Either way this exposed the realities of abortion that most people and places do not want you to know.""Planned"" parenthood (although this name is deceptively used) is great for planning parenthood, not for planning abortions which lead to years and years of a nightmare.

However, I was just absolutely compelled to write this. This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. Unfortunately, it starts out a bit slow, and seems like a typical mainstream drama that isn't going much of anywhere. Then it turns into a goofy college road trip for awhile. Then it shifts into a complex, intense drama. Most movies couldn't pull off a stunt like that, but this movie does. And it is the last two thirds of the movie that really begins to grip you.If you do watch it, the end-of-disk featurettes are interesting, but, if you don't bother to watch them, at least make sure you watch the final credits as they roll, so you can see/hear the interview with one of the actresses. It is the final ""capper"" of a movie that just continues to add layer after layer of powerful storytelling.I rented this at a local video store, figuring it would be one evening's entertainment. By the end of the movie, I knew I needed to see it again, and again, and again, and I have just ordered it here on-line.Given what the movie was about, I suspected there would be several one-star reviews, and there were indeed. I normally don't mind one-star reviews, and I certainly have no problem with people expressing their opinions. This is the first movie, though, where I actually pray for the people who gave this one star - that, at some point in their lives, they will begin to see life differently - for their own sakes.Finally, for what it's worth, I had no idea at all that this was a Christian film until the very end of the credits (which I wouldn't have even bothered watching had it not been for the surprising interview that played during the credits). This was not a problem for me at all, though, because I'm actually not a Christian. I was able to become thoroughly entranced in, and moved by, this movie without having any interest in the particular religious message it was attempting to convey, because, in my opinion, it was not a religious message per se. It was a message about the value and celebration of life in general, which should transcend all religions. By the end of this movie, you really just love and appreciate life, and I think this was the movie's greatest achievement.",5,"Not an Important Review, Just Compelled to Write It",1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,2315,"['normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'writing', 'reviews', 'movies', 'already', 'have', 'ton', 'reviews', 'However', 'was', 'just', 'absolutely', 'compelled', 'write', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Unfortunately', 'out', 'bit', 'slow', 'typical', 'mainstream', 'drama', ""n't"", 'going', 'much', 'anywhere', 'Then', 'goofy', 'college', 'road', 'trip', 'awhile', 'Then', 'complex', 'intense', 'drama', 'Most', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'stunt', 'movie', 'last', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'really', 'grip', 'you.If', 'do', 'watch', 'end-of-disk', 'featurettes', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'least', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'can', 'see/hear', 'interview', 'one', 'actresses', 'final', 'capper', 'movie', 'just', 'add', 'layer', 'layer', 'powerful', 'storytelling.I', 'rented', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'figuring', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'end', 'movie', 'knew', 'needed', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'just', 'ordered', 'here', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'suspected', 'would', 'be', 'several', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'were', 'indeed', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'certainly', 'have', 'problem', 'people', 'expressing', 'opinions', 'first', 'movie', 'though', 'where', 'actually', 'pray', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'point', 'lives', 'will', 'begin', 'see', 'life', 'differently', 'own', 'sakes.Finally', 'what', 'worth', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'Christian', 'film', 'very', 'end', 'credits', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'bothered', 'watching', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'surprising', 'interview', 'played', 'credits', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'though', ""'m"", 'actually', 'not', 'Christian', 'was', 'able', 'become', 'thoroughly', 'entranced', 'moved', 'movie', 'having', 'interest', 'particular', 'religious', 'message', 'was', 'attempting', 'convey', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'religious', 'message', 'se', 'was', 'message', 'value', 'celebration', 'life', 'general', 'should', 'transcend', 'religions', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'love', 'appreciate', 'life', 'think', 'was', 'movie', 'greatest', 'achievement']",N/A
1569494,A1CX79P27ALJJP,B008KZ06A6,Bronx Book Guy,"[1, 1]","I am strongly pro-choice but respect individuals have different beliefs and the right to make a choice doesn't mean the choice lacks negative consequences. You are allowed to marry people who turn out to be bad choices or result in some bad things occurring. And, if it is a good story overall, I can enjoy things dramatically, like the show Seventh Heaven, without necessarily agreeing with the characters on various points.Also, some were upset the instant video didn't make clear what the film was about. The DVD case, if not bluntly, made it pretty clear where its sympathies lie. The film also concerns a very narrow class -- less than 1% of abortions occur at 24 weeks. Most of these involve fetal abnormalities or maternal health. In fact, it is quite hard to get an abortion that late and states can and often do don't allow them since the fetus is viable.The woman in this film underlines a reason why an abortion would be iffy except in narrow cases. But, other films also focus on narrow cases. The Cider House Rules focused on an abortion on account of incest, e.g. Films also are about things that only rarely occur in real life. Anyway, yes, a 24 week old fetus is not merely ""tissue,"" even if in limited cases, abortions very well might be acceptable. So, the nurse's speech did not upset me either. It would be more problematic if it involved an early abortion, but even there, I respect other beliefs.The film isn't about pro-life propaganda. It is about a specific woman who finds out she was a survivor of an abortion ... actually, it to me seemed more like an adoption tale. The theme of forgiveness & a person struggling to accept they were given up etc. is common in that context. Abortion does enter the picture and talk of a ""crisis pregnancy center"" (a troublesome thing -- people can research the topic) is referenced, but the film does not focus on that. If anything, its ultimate message is forgiveness and belief in the person, not the sin (as it deems it). This to me does not make criminalization a very useful model.The film could have been entitled Hannah's Journey and I give it a good review particularly since I enjoyed the lead and respected her story. The cast overall does a good job and especially for an underfunded indie film with a Christian message, they provide respectable support. The two ""names"" (one in a cameo) are fine enough. The film also wisely doesn't beat your head with its message, telling a good story and making us care about the character. I also thought the budding romance was handled nicely as well as some comic relief.The girlfriend is something of a stereotypical heavy but in the end, even she is not just a caricature. The scene in the church is handled nice. The scene in the doctor's office (when she is told) to me rings a bit false. What exactly the doctor is talking about regarding other people in her position is unclear. Is the abortion itself being blamed for her mental state as compared to her health issues and perhaps some implication she was adoption?The DVD extras were okay. The film as a whole was enjoyable. The music a bit heavy-handed. I recommend the film and do not agree with some who deem it just as propaganda, particularly unbelievable or badly made.",4,Pro-Choice Viewer.

I hope it makes a long-lasting difference for many people.  It is the story of a college-age girl's quest to find her mother by running away from home.  She was the survivor of a failed abortion and is confused about why her mother didn't want her.  There's a bit of humor in it that I enjoyed, and I think the acting is good.  It's a movie designed more for healing than for inspiration, so it is filled with several scenes where nothing is going on except crying with slow, moody music.  The directors, Jon and Andrew Erwin, came from doing music videos to doing the motion picture format, so this film's style is different from a lot of movies.  It is more focused on atmosphere and mood than on dialogue at times, and there's nothing wrong with that; it's just unusual for a movie.  In my review title, I mention it being very intense.  There are times where her feelings of despair, expressed by wanting to isolate herself from others, suicidal feelings, and crying, were frankly overwhelming for me and make it a pretty volatile movie for me to watch, as I intimately know her emotional journey.  It's something to be aware of:  an emotionally powerful movie can be healing for some people but very difficult for others.  On its own merits, though, I applaud it for bringing to light the existence of abortion survivors, and more importantly for making people aware of the intense trauma that abortion causes.

1569504,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B008KZ06A6,C. Long,"[3, 3]","This is a well-made, excellent movie and I don't understand why Amazon doesn't directly carry it. My understanding has been (though I do not know for sure) that it is because they don't agree with the ideology in the movie. But they probably don't agree with the ideology of thousands of products that they carry, so I don't know why this would have been specially singled out. Obviously by the number of positive reviews of this movie, it would seem to be a poor business decision on Amazon's part.Regarding the Blu-ray: the quality was great and I recommend it over the DVD.  There were some initial Blu-ray's released that were missing the special features.  My understanding is that those discs were recalled, but be advised there may still be some out there (I found this out the hard way).As for the movie itself:Let me be honest: When I saw the plot for this movie, I wasn't overly thrilled. I don't know what I was expecting, but this movie definitely blew away any pre-conceived notions. This is a GREAT movie! It is entertaining, emotional, relatable, and just generally a joy to watch. It draws you in on an emotional journey that the main character makes and you feel like you're making it right along with her. Among other things, this is a tribute to the reasonably high film-making quality and acting. This movie (along with the movie Bella) is a great pro-life movie, but it's also just plain a good movie.That isn't to say that there aren't some scenes that feel out of place, rushed, or downright odd, because there are. And there are a few scenes that I even felt were written poorly and I wished would have been majorly changed. There are also some plot-twists and developments that I didn't care for. But the movie as a whole is an engaging and very encouraging movie that really shows that all life is beautiful. And by the way, it was inspired by a true story. Make no mistake: this movie preaches to you about abortion, although it generally does it in a more roundabout way, rather than directly at you. But honestly, this movie isn't really so much about the issue of abortion itself as it is a celebration of life and moving forward from your past.On some level, we all have to come to grips with our pasts and how those pasts play into our present. I think many people, even without any connection with abortion in their past, will find that this movie is quite meaningful and has some great things to say. I can definitely see this film being used by God to help bring healing from past regrets.As mentioned earlier, quality level for this film was reasonably high. Think ""really good made-for-t.v. movie"" and then take it up a notch or two and that's where this film's quality level sits IMO. Acting is relatively believable, which is important given the weighty subject matter in this film.Make sure you watch the end credits as you'll get a very interesting surprise, which really ratchets up the effectiveness of the movie to a whole other level. Also, I just plain like the song at the end by The Afters called ""Life is Beautiful"" - I liked it so much I bought the mp3 of it.As mentioned earlier, for all the film's positives, I did have some gripes. Warning: I'm going to get a little specific now and I'll try to do so in such a way not to spoil too much but you may want to skip ahead to the end if you haven't seen the movie.First, there is a scene where the main character was questioning the normalcy of her being a virgin. That concept itself didn't bother me, but the film raised the issue, but then never resolved it and in fact completely cut-it-off (literally had the character stop the conversation), and actually the way it was portrayed almost made it seem as though it WAS silly that she was a virgin, which I'm sure is not the message that was intended to be portrayed. It would have been much more facilitative if they had actually had her and her friend complete that conversation with her friend really upholding the Biblical standard.Another gripe concerns a scene with the main character's ""best friend"" and her dad. I thought the whole lifelong best-friend component to the movie was really good, but that's also why I got very frustrated with the movie towards the end when the father lays down the law about him never seeing her again, and they just showed her accepting that without any argument. Really? Her lifelong best friend has just been with her through thick and thin on this deeply emotional journey and she doesn't even backtalk to her dad once about not ever being able to see her lifelong best friend again??? Oh that frustrated me something fierce. I'm a big supporter of obeying your parents, but this girl, who was college-age, had also had her past hidden to her by her parents and her dad's behavior wasn't right. I WANTED to see a bit of a blow-out scene at that time where she really honestly expressed how she felt about that to him - I thought that was a scene that needed to be had both for her and for him - one that would ultimately help to bring about the necessary healing. Instead, that moment never happened in the movie. For the audience, that emotional release was very much needed, but it wasn't provided to us. There needed to be an honest, emotionally-intense confrontation moment with her parents, and that never happened. Instead, we got this implausible ""she just went back and quietly submitted to her parents"" thing which felt phoney and didn't satisfy.While mentioning the ""best friend"", I really think this movie might have been much better served by keeping their relationship the way it was for most of the film. I really thought that where they took the movie with him at the end was a bit much and a bit formulaic, and I feel that emotionally the film might have been a bit more satisfying if they had just portrayed him/kept him as a guy who deeply cared for his friend and didn't hint that part of his motivation was because he was secretly in love with her.Gripes aside, this is a powerful movie that is very worthwhile. Due to its themes, I do think this movie is best-geared for adults, though mid-to-late teens can probably get some things out of this movie also. This is a pretty ""clean"" movie with no cussing, etc. but if shown to teens, I think good follow-up discussion about the way some of the other college-age characters acted in the movie is warranted (including them wanting to go to Mardis Gras for Spring Break, etc.) and a follow-up on the whole virginity thing (as discussed above). Another key discussion point could be about identity, which was a centerpiece of much of this movie - discussion about how our identity as Christians is to be found in Christ, not in our past, I think would be very worthwhile.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",5,Great movie that Amazon should carry,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,6802,"['well-made', 'excellent',

A dramatic incident on stage during her performance in a play serves as the catalyst for a journey of discovery as she attempts to unravel her past which seems to be filled with dark secrets.When she is invited to join some friends on a short vacation trip from school she decides to use that opportunity to see if she can solve the mystery of her past.

1569512,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B008KZ06A6,David W. Jones,"[1, 1]","What a beautiful film!  A young woman named Hannah (Rachel Hendrix) discovers that she is the adopted survivor of a failed abortion.  Dealing with overwhelming feelings of being unwanted, she goes on a quest to find her birth mother (touchingly played by Shari Rigby).  Hannah's noble childhood friend (Jason Burkey) aids in her quest.The movie has a strong, positive pro-life message throughout, yet without getting preachy.  While it does not hide the consequences of abortion, it focuses on the hope of forgiveness.  There are no contrived conversions.The acting was among the best that I have seen for a Christian-themed film.  Fresh-faced Rachel Hendrix plays Hannah with pathos, intelligence and vulnerability in her film debut.  John Schneider of Dukes of Hazard fame is strong as Hannah's father.  Jasmine Guy as Nurse Mary was particularly good in limited screen time.October Baby has a high production value for films in this genre.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Even though I only had the DVD version, it played with almost the clarity of a blu-ray.  The soundtrack also works well.  UPDATE: I have since purchased the blu-ray version, and it is phenomenal in terms of visual and audio quality.  Very well done.I appreciated the emphasis upon sexual purity.  (Spoiler Alert) When Hannah and Jason are on the road together and discover that their hotel room has only one bed, they opt to spend the night on the couch in the hotel lobby.  This was so refreshing.Make no mistake: this is melodrama.  But it is very well done melodrama.  It held my wife's attention and mine throughout, so that we missed our traditional Sunday afternoon nap!  This is a four or five hanky movie.  I recommend October Baby for anyone who loves a compelling story.  Women who are searching for spiritual healing from a previous abortion may find some healing here.

Hannah's search for her real mother provides excellent tension. There are some good and fairly well-earned surprises too.Cinematography & Settings: Although the stage directions are a bit stilted, a little too picture-perfect, the camera work is professionally done, with good backdrops and bits of scenery.Characterization, acting, & script: Many highs and lows. Rachel Hendrix's performance is a bit lifeless, but John Schneider and Jennifer Price as her foster parents are pretty real, lame dialogue notwithstanding. Foster Dad Jacob's revelation to Hannah (now 19) at the beginning --"". . .you were born premature because you are the survivor of a failed abortion""--seems horribly unrealistically blunt and made simply for the purpose of getting the conflict out in the open, but it later coincides with the character of a tough, rather gauche, but ultimately compassionate Baptist doctor. OCTOBER BABY includes one of Movieland's most totally ludicrous stereotypes ever in the form of ""BMAC"" the 60s throwback, apparently present simply for comic relief, but it's NOT funny! Some really good supporting characters, particularly Rodney Clark as the priest.Mood & atmosphere: The most problematical aspect of OCTOBER BABY. Many of the 5-star reviewers say it made them cry, and while I respect the fact that many people enjoy tear-jerkers, OCTOBER BABY is noTerms of Endearment. The constant soap operatic piano scores and faint schmaltzy theme songs are nothing but distracting, and, since the film also apparently wants to be funny in places, it's often hard to sense how to take certain things. The transitions between light and heavy-hearted are pretty poor.Themes: All the stuff about forgiveness comes through pretty well. Many have complained about the embedded anti-abortion agenda, but that didn't really bother me, and I wouldn't have even noticed it had I not read some reviews before watching OCTOBER BABY. I chose to ignore the Special Features and Director's Commentary, where a lot of the agenda may come out. Problems usually arise when people make films that are intended to carry an underlying moral/religious message without being too blatant about it, but viewing this film as a simple story for its own sake, I didn't feel manipulated or preached to.",3,The Elements of OCTOBER BABY,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2458,"['Plot', 'Conflict', 'digressions', 'too', 'easies', 'general', 'annoyances', 'film', 'certainly', 'kept', 'engrossed', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'give', 'as', 'high', 'rating', 'do', 'Hannah', 'search', 'real', 'mother', 'excellent', 'tension', 'are', 'good', 'fairly', 'well-earned', 'surprises', 'too.Cinematography', 'Settings', 'stage', 'directions', 'are', 'bit', 'stilted', 'little', 'too', 'picture-perfect', 'camera', 'work', 'professionally', 'done', 'good', 'backdrops', 'bits', 'scenery.Characterization', 'acting', 'script', 'Many', 'highs', 'lows', 'Rachel', 'Hendrix', 'performance', 'bit', 'lifeless', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Jennifer', 'Price', 'foster', 'parents', 'are', 'pretty', 'real', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'notwithstanding', 'Foster', 'Dad', 'Jacob', 'revelation', 'Hannah', 'now', '19', 'beginning', '.you', 'were', 'born', 'premature', 'are', 'survivor', 'failed', 'abortion', 'horribly', 'unrealistically', 'blunt', 'made', 'simply', 'purpose', 'getting', 'conflict', 'out', 'open', 'later', 'character', 'tough', 'rather', 'gauche', 'ultimately', 'compassionate', 'Baptist', 'doctor', 'OCTOBER', 'BABY', 'one', 'Movieland', 'most', 'totally', 'ludicrous', 'stereotypes', 'ever', 'form', 'BMAC', '60s', 'throwback', 'apparently', 'present', 'simply', 'comic', 'relief', 'NOT', 'funny', 'really', 'good', 'supporting', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Rodney', 'Clark', 'priest.Mood', 'atmosphere', 'most', 'problematical', 'aspect', 'OCTOBER', 'BABY', 'Many', '5-star', 'reviewers', 'say', 'made', 'cry', 'respect', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'enjoy', 'tear-jerkers', 'OCTOBER', 'BABY', 'noTerms', 'Endearment', 'constant', 'soap', 'operatic', 'piano', 'scores', 'faint', 'schmaltzy', 'theme', 'songs', 'are', 'nothing', 'distracting', 'film', 'also', 'apparently', 'be', 'funny', 'places', 'often', 'hard', 'sense', 'how', 'take', 'certain', 'things', 'transitions', 'light', 'heavy-hearted', 'are', 'pretty', 'poor.Themes', 'stuff', 'forgiveness', 'pretty', 'well', 'Many', 'have', 'complained', 'embedded', 'anti-abortion', 'agenda', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'noticed', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'watching', 'OCTOBER', 'BABY', 'chose', 'ignore', 'Special', 'Features', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'where', 'lot', 'agenda', 'may', 'come', 'out', 'Problems', 'usually', 'arise', 'when', 'people', 'make', 'films', 'are', 'intended', 'carry', 'underlying', 'moral/religious', 'message', 'being', 'too', 'blatant', 'viewing', 'film', 'simple', 'story', 'own', 'sake', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'manipulated', 'preached']",N/A

The acting is uniformly good -- I don't see how any of the actors could have done much better with the material, and there are a few long scenes in the movie which are extremely well-acted.The script could probably have benefited from some tightening here and there. A few small details made me wonder... 'Why would they do this?' or 'Is this realistic?' But those were peripheral issues. The plot is sound, the message is clear. The producers wanted to tug at the viewer's heartstrings, and were pretty effective. As the final credits roll, you will learn that one of the actor's personal experiences line up with the plot of the film so closely, it almost wasn't acting.""Bella"" is another excellent pro-life message movie. It is more secular in outlook, and more subtle in approach. October Baby is more overtly religious. Both movies are, in a way, about healing from tragic mistakes. I have to give credit to October Baby for having a happy ending that does not seem excessively forced.I don't really care for the style of contemporary music used throughout the film, but that's me. It is a decent representation of modern pop balladry.In the final analysis, I admire the quality of the performances here, with a star taken off for the predictability of the story arc and a few questionable plot elements.

Yes, this film touches on a serious and controversial issue that we in modern America face. However, despite your own views of the issue, this movie was fantastically and wonderfully made!Pros:-The lighting in this movie is just beautiful! ...Simply awe-inspiring! It will blow you away! Former co-workers and several friends who are still photographers agree that the lighting in this movie is one of the best in modern feature films.-Shot composition is also fantastic! There are numerous gorgeous shots in this film and you can't help but feel the movie through them.-The acting is not poor or wooden like some would have you believe. In fact, Rachel Hendrix is completely brilliant in every moment of the film. I applaud her and the other actors/actresses for pulling off such heavy roles and subject matter!-The plot. While controversial, it's still very well done and perfectly balanced between light, airy happiness and stark, sad hurt.Cons:-One scene at towards the end of the movie has a setting that is very cliche and been done hundreds of times before. I would have chosen a different place for that scene. But, I also realize the cost involved and that setting was a very inexpensive place to shoot. The plus side is that Rachel Hendrix's emotional performance kept the audience's belief/attention despite the setting.-One song, to me, felt off when placed in the movie. Not because of the tone or sound of the song or the timing- but because the lyrics were crisply heard at a time where you didn't need it crisply heard. However, that being said, the rest of the music choices in the movie were done well (including the very beautiful piece sung by Giana Jensen).If you haven't watched it and aren't sure you want to- do yourself a favor and give this wonderfully crafted art piece a shot! So what if it has a certain bias? Most films do! Even if you aren't aware of it, every film has a bias towards something and influences the audience towards whatever it supports.Still, the movie doesn't ""hate"" on those of the opposing viewpoint. It actually asserts it's right of freedom without being mean towards others.If you love well done movies and consider yourself open minded but still want to watch something with depth, joy, peace, struggle and freedom: then watch October Baby!",5,From a Filmmaker's POV...,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,2415,"['Being', 'film', 'industry', 'have', 'extremely', 'critical', 'eye', 'movie', 'regardless', 'who', 'made', 'what', 'about', 'Yes', 'film', 'serious', 'controversial', 'issue', 'modern', 'America', 'face', 'However', 'own', 'views', 'issue', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastically', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'Pros', '-The', 'lighting', 'movie', 'just', 'beautiful', 'Simply', 'awe-inspiring', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Former', 'co-workers', 'several', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'photographers', 'agree', 'lighting', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'modern', 'feature', 'films.-Shot', 'composition', 'also', 'fantastic', 'are', 'numerous', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'movie', 'them.-The', 'acting', 'not', 'poor', 'wooden', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'fact', 'Rachel', 'Hendrix', 'completely', 'brilliant', 'moment', 'film', 'applaud', 'other', 'actors/actresses', 'pulling', 'off', 'such', 'heavy', 'roles', 'subject', 'matter', '-The', 'plot', 'controversial', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'light', 'airy', 'happiness', 'stark', 'sad', 'hurt.Cons', '-One', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'setting', 'very', 'cliche', 'been', 'done', 'hundreds', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'different', 'place', 'scene', 'also', 'realize', 'cost', 'involved', 'setting', 'was', 'very', 'inexpensive', 'place', 'shoot', 'plus', 'side', 'Rachel', 'Hendrix', 'emotional', 'performance', 'kept', 'audience', 'belief/attention', 'setting.-One', 'song', 'felt', 'off', 'when', 'placed', 'movie', 'Not', 'tone', 'sound', 'song', 'timing-', 'lyrics', 'were', 'crisply', 'heard', 'time', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'crisply', 'heard', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'rest', 'music', 'choices', 'movie', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'including', 'very', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'sung', 'Giana', 'Jensen', '.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'want', 'to-', 'do', 'favor', 'give', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'art', 'piece', 'shot', 'So', 'what', 'certain', 'bias', 'Most', 'films', 'do', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'film', 'bias', 'something', 'audience', 'towards', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hate', 'opposing', 'viewpoint', 'actually', 'right', 'freedom', 'being', 'mean', 'towards', 'love', 'well', 'done', 'movies', 'consider', 'open', 'minded', 'still', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'depth', 'joy', 'peace', 'struggle', 'freedom', 'then', 'watch', 'October', 'Baby']",N/A

But hey, since it's independent, it's not like it's a powerhouse film that should be taken seriously, right? What if it defies indie-film tradition and actually has a really good story? Or very quirky people? Or down-to-Earth humor? Or even deep, interconnecting storylines connected into one single story? Or multiple scenes that not only have shocking secrets revelealed, but also cry (did that maybe three, four, possibly five times) throughout? Before this, extremely few indie films have had such a great impact on me. Fewer still were Faith-based. So it's a good thing the Erwin brother took a chance on this movie.Imagine you're an aspiring actress that's just statting a play when you go down, unscripted. Well, revelations are made where you find out what you thought your life was really wasn't. You get a desire to find out your past, and until a friend invites you on a road trip, you wouldn't know how to find your past. You get there alright, you find out alright, but with every step of the journey is either a new laugh, a new heartbreak, or a new discovery about yourself in a whole new light.Cool people (including newcomer actress Rachel Hendrix) give each character depth (even when they're not given a proportionate amount of screen time) and a reason to be in the story (whether hopeful, tragic, snobby, helpful, etc.). To say this was just a movie would be a gross misunderstanding considering the direction it took in filmmaking. The only problem I have with it is where some questions about why some people are the way they are can only be found in the deleted scenes (where I both cried and laugh hard). Nonetheless, this is deeply provoking, deeply enlightening, and most definitely worth watching all over again.Sidenote: when I watched the deleted scenes, some of them I wondered why they didn't include them in the film?

The three other guys with me, (and their wives), are in their late 40s to 87. The only other movie I've cried at is when John Wayne died in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  All these guys are bow and rifle hunters, campers, tough, rugged guys who will only grit their teeth when they break a bone.  It was so touching to look around and see all of us men with tears streaming down our cheeks...in front of our wives no less.This was not your typical Christian movie as it seems everyone in the movie was afraid to use the ""C"" word.  It was not your typical Hollywood flic... the movie was clean, up-lifting, solid and meaningful.  It had a clear, good, easy to understand message.  But it didn't brow-beat anyone!The actors were all good.  The acting was all good.  The script was to the point without any drivel.  The young woman hero of the movie was so credible... her role/acting was completely realistic.  John Schnider was his usual laid-back, solid self.Photography was darn good if you ignore some of the VW van shots of highway, wheels-turning, cars passing, etc... that lasted too long.  The rest of the movie was about picture perfect.The music...well, this would have to be the only weak point... too much, too often, and not that good.... but it is possible to ignore it if you are involved with the plot.And speaking of the plot.... I didn't time anything, but it seemed like there was something going on constantly with spurts of WOW! every few minutes.  I went into the first few minutes of this film thinking another Christian teen movie....but within another min.  I discovered how wrong I was.... (Christianity was NEVER mentioned and the movie was about all ages of folks.)Listen folks, this is a GREAT movie!  It is a movie that will move you.  It does this on it's own merit.  I believe this non-Christian movie produced an insight of depth that just hasn't been seen before in this format.  Christ was in this movie even if everyone was too chicken to say His name.  The message was His message.  But, it was not a churchy movie in any way!  How could it be when nothing religious was said by anyone but a priest who told the hero to learn how to forgive.  (Boy!  How could we go to a movie with a priest in it these days and the priest doesn't try to even seduce the female lead????!!!)  This was realism at it's best.  The girl hero acts like a girl hero. The dad acts like a good concerned dad.  The boyfriend acts like a good male friend/boyfriend.  The priest acts like a normal priest.  None of the male characters are stupids that the women have to ""take care of"". The women are strong and have good minds just like the men. Everyone was equal.  There were no put-downs that we could love to hate or disrespect...not even the logical ""villans"".  Everyone was normal.  Acting and directing was common sense and logic personified with real life.I like to watch movies but I'm sick of being assulted by ""reality"" movies that offend my ears, morals and stomach.  I used to like Clint Eastwood in his earlier movies but for some reason he, like most of Hollywood, thinks we all need lessons on how to curse, be crude, talk filthy, re-write history and pretend like the only emotions allowed on screen are lust and anger...""October Baby"" is a movie that I'm happy and eager to take my wife, grandkids, and pastor to.  It is NOT a goodie-two-shoes movie.  It is a slice of life...(stay seated all the way through the ending credits!)...movie that is fit for only the youngest kids who understand words.  If you like to leave a movie feeling good, if you want to leave a movie with food for thought, (instead of wanting to wash your ears out with soap)... if you want to think deeply without fear of hurting yourself, if you want to be entertained, if you want to be up-lifted in all areas you can apply, then watch this flic.  Watch it, watch it even with a closed, biased mind.  This movie will reach into you...no matter where you are in your life.

1569553,A3VA7MACQJZPBT,B008KZ06A6,"Kelly Blackwell - Here's My Take On It ""Kelly""","[1, 1]","All in all I liked this movie, but I really had to work at it.  Now, I may be overly picky, but the first hour drove me nuts.  I did not like Hannah. Hannah is pretty rocked when she finds out she is adopted.  I imagine I would be as well, but considering the circumstances, it is no surprise that they kept it from her.  It is not something easily told without an impact that could sway the most well-functioning individual, and Hannah is already going through issues (which are hard to understand when we see a clip of what looks like pretty fun times as a young child and we know she was raised by two loving parents).  Why she feels she has no right to exist is kind of a lame label.The solution to go on a road trip to get some answers made some sense to me, it was the cast of characters along for the very short ride that did not.  It was something added into the story that really could have been omitted other than the fact that they probably didn't want us to see Hannah intentionally  just take a road trip with her guy best friend.  It just did not add to the story in any way that mattered, and really just took away from it for me.  Like I said, I was struggling.  I was waiting for it to get better.Jasmine Guy's performance was incredible, John Schneider's was also awesome.  I actually started to like the movie more once Jasmine Guy came into the film, but honestly it swept the good right back out quickly when Hannah continued with her bratty moments as well as a few from her friend Jason, as a parent, I wanted to smack him.In the long run, the pay off was really nice.  The finally half hour was great, well acted, and had really good moments.  I think the film would have been much better if the beginning and middle were thought out better, and if people paid some attention to how other people really act and talk to one another.  There were a lot of moments where I thought, ""who has conversations like this?""  There were points where it seemed they were trying too hard for comic relief.  There were lines that just blew me out of the story like when Jason says to Hannah ""Remember when we were like nine?"" and she says ""When you were nine I was 8 1/2.""  WHAT?  That made no sense.  Maybe if he talked about his 9th birthday which still would have not made sense.  It was just an addition in the dialogue that bugged me and thus pulled me out of the film.Anyway, I digress.  I liked it, but that is to say, I liked what it was attempting and I liked the last half hour quite a bit.  I held off watching it for a while, because a friend of mine who was adopted told me that after seeing it, she was glad she never met her birth mother.  That gave me pause as to what I would get.Lastly the music was wonderful!  The soundtrack was extremely well done.I would rate this three out of five smiles.  I liked the message of forgiveness.  I enjoyed the performances of several of the actors.  Will I watch it again?  No.  I did not enjoy it enough for that.Lastly, this is a film that has a Christian pro-life message.  Some reviews I have read expressed issues with that.  I think because of the very important message it had to convey, they should have worked out the kinks a little more.  It is a film that I would share with my son, but I know he would be bored long before he heard the valuable message in this film and felt its impact.",3,Well Acted Story - Could Have Used Some Tweaks,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,3362,"['liked', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'work', 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'overly', 'picky', 'first', 'hour', 'drove', 'nuts', 'did', 'not', 'Hannah', 'Hannah', 'pretty', 'rocked', 'when', 'adopted', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'surprise', 'kept', 'not', 'something', 'easily', 'told', 'impact', 'could', 'sway', 'most', 'well-functioning', 'individual', 'Hannah', 'already', 'going', 'issues', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'when', 'see', 'clip', 'what', 'pretty', 'fun', 'times', 'young', 'child', 'know', 'was', 'raised', 'two', 'loving', 'parents', 'Why', 'right', 'exist', 'kind', 'lame', 'label.The', 'solution', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'get', 'answers', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'cast', 'characters', 'very', 'short', 'ride', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'something', 'added', 'story', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'other', 'fact', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Hannah', 'intentionally', 'just', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'guy', 'best', 'friend', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'story', 'way', 'mattered', 'really', 'just', 'took', 'away', 'said', 'was', 'struggling', 'was', 'waiting', 'get', 'better.Jasmine', 'Guy', 'performance', 'was', 'incredible', 'John', 'Schneider', 'was', 'also', 'awesome', 'actually', 'started', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'Jasmine', 'Guy', 'came', 'film', 'honestly', 'swept', 'good', 'right', 'back', 'out', 'quickly', 'when', 'Hannah', 'continued', 'bratty', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'friend', 'Jason', 'parent', 'wanted', 'smack', 'long', 'run', 'pay', 'off', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'finally', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'great', 'well', 'acted', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'moments', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'beginning', 'middle', 'were', 'thought', 'out', 'better', 'people', 'paid', 'attention', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'really', 'act', 'talk', 'one', 'were', 'lot', 'moments', 'where', 'thought', 'who', 'conversations', 'were', 'points', 'where', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'comic', 'relief', 'were', 'lines', 'just', 'blew', 'story', 'when', 'Jason', 'Hannah', 'Remember', 'when', 'were', 'like', 'nine', 'When', 'were', 'nine', 'was', '8', '1/2', 'WHAT', 'made', 'sense', 'Maybe', 'talked', '9th', 'birthday', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'just', 'addition', 'dialogue', 'bugged', 'thus', 'pulled', 'film.Anyway', 'digress', 'liked', 'say', 'liked', 'what', 'was', 'attempting', 'liked', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'quite', 'bit', 'held', 'off', 'watching', 'while', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'told', 'seeing', 'was', 'glad', 'never', 'met', 'birth', 'mother', 'gave', 'pause', 'what', 'would', 'get.Lastly', 'music', 'was', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'done.I', 'would', 'rate', 'three', 'five', 'smiles', 'liked', 'message', 'forgiveness', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'several', 'actors', 'Will', 'watch', 'again', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'enough', 'that.Lastly', 'film', 'Christian', 'pro-life', 'message', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'expressed', 'issues', 'think', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'had', 'convey', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'kinks', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'would', 'share', 'son', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'long', 'heard', 'valuable', 'message', 'film', 'felt', 'impact']",N/A

Unfortunately, this movie left many opportunities for attack, and the sad thing is that they could have been easily overcome by simply consulting an obstetrician or perinatologist, and making the story slightly different.

I am a guy, not suppose to cry right? Well, I learned tonight that the heart is much more powerful than the mind! This movie was definitely well made. The way that the music was integrated at the perfect moments. Moments that in and of themselves already elicited a powerful emotional response---coupled with the music in the background, made this movie such a wonderful experience.I do want to point out one element that I feel did not have to be left out. I definitely, truly appreciate that this was a family movie, clean, pure and focused on what we all know can be a controversial topic. Yet, the scene where Hana and her soon-to-be boyfriend are on a date, on the very stage where she first collapsed and he reaches over to touch her ear, gently adjust her hair as a sign of affection (an expression of feeling that have graduated from best friends to much more)--they should have kissed! I know that I am not the only one who thought this or felt this way! The fact that they did not, in that moment, that perfect moment; in my view, did something to subtract from the full potential that this movie could of had. Why was it left out? Kissing is the most beautiful, most natural expression shared between two people that deeply love each other. The argument may be made that this is a family movie, but the topic from which it is founded is a ""mature"" topic. Trust me, I definitely appreciate the fact that this ovie did not have sex scenes, nudity, and all that typical Hollywood stuff, but a kiss, a tender kiss! Imagine that Jack and Rose had never kissed in the movie, Titanic! My favorite part in that movie was when Rose, already aboard one of the life boats, her survival almost assured by her being on it, got off of it at the last minute, as it was being leured down onto the water because she would much rather risk the possibility of living a life with Jack rather than a life without him. The powerful and very beautiful force drawing them together was so palpable in that moment! The second that she sets foot back on the ship, she rushes to him and he rushes to her. When they meet, Jack scolds her, ""why did you do that Rose? You are so stupid Rose, why did you get off, why Rose?!"" yet as he is mouthing these very words, he cannot stop kissing her! I remember actually ""hearing"" an audible emotional response evoked from the audience when this very scene was playing. To not have this pure, innocent, human contact almost feels like not performing a handshake after sealing a HUGE deal!Other than this small glitch (in my opinion), I absolutely loved this movie. I didn't give it anything less than five stars because it elicited an actual, biological (tears) and emotional response, and when a movie can do this, make a tough man (grrrr) shed tears, it is nothing short of a masterpiece!This movie is HIGHLY recommended. It is my wish that I did not spoil it for anyone.",5,"POWERFUL!!!

I knew nothing about the plot.When I first read the first line of the plot summary on the back cover, I had an idea of what I was in for - a typical christian film.  Let's be honest, the typical christian film often is heavy on message, light on talent and creativity.  This film is different from that.While some of the more dramatic scenes did seem a bit phony (acting, script) overall, the film is actually very well done.Most films rise and fall on how convincing the actors/actresses are.  The brightest light in this film is the lead actress.  Although young, she is dynamic and brings a convincing performance to the screen.  Being a lover of great films and television productions, I found the lead actress' performance to be one of the best I've seen in years - professionally speaking.  Her command of her character is spot on, and her use of facial expressions delivers a surprise performance.  I anticipate her next film appearance and if she can only manage to be half as good as she is in this film, she will accomplish much.Secondly, the cinematography and editing job was excellent.  The scenes were generally dynamic, kept your attention, and kept the pace of the movie just right.The use of actually funny comedy brought further relief to a genre in films whose humor is often forced.Finally, the film did end well.Overall, dealing with a serious and sensitive subject matter, the film did quite well.  I hope it will raise the bar for film making in christian circles as it steered clear of the element that saps the life out of most films: predictability.",4,Better Than Expected,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1660,"['heard', 'film', 'christian', 'group', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'watch', 'knew', 'nothing', 'plot.When', 'first', 'read', 'first', 'line', 'plot', 'summary', 'back', 'cover', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'typical', 'christian', 'film', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'typical', 'christian', 'film', 'often', 'heavy', 'message', 'light', 'talent', 'creativity', 'film', 'different', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'phony', 'acting', 'script', 'overall', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'done.Most', 'films', 'rise', 'fall', 'how', 'convincing', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'brightest', 'light', 'film', 'lead', 'actress', 'young', 'dynamic', 'convincing', 'performance', 'screen', 'Being', 'lover', 'great', 'films', 'television', 'productions', 'found', 'lead', 'actress', 'performance', 'be', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'professionally', 'speaking', 'command', 'character', 'spot', 'use', 'facial', 'expressions', 'surprise', 'performance', 'anticipate', 'next', 'film', 'appearance', 'can', 'only', 'manage', 'be', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'accomplish', 'much.Secondly', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'job', 'was', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'were', 'generally', 'dynamic', 'kept', 'attention', 'kept', 'pace', 'movie', 'just', 'right.The', 'use', 'actually', 'funny', 'comedy', 'brought', 'further', 'relief', 'genre', 'films', 'humor', 'often', 'forced.Finally', 'film', 'did', 'end', 'well.Overall', 'dealing', 'serious', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'hope', 'will', 'raise', 'bar', 'film', 'making', 'christian', 'circles', 'steered', 'clear', 'element', 'life', 'most', 'films', 'predictability']",N/A

As 20-year old Hannah, Hendrix's attempt to portray trauma-scarred behavior comes across as moody teenage angst. Compared to the soul-wrenching performance of Vanessa Hudgens in the similar &#34;Gimme Shelter&#34; (2014), which is also a pro-life film based on a true story, Hendrix is a minor leaguer, and &#34;October Baby&#34; would have benefitted from a stronger actress here. Character motivations, particularly between Hannah and her adoptive parents, are frequently unclear.The technical style of the film is also weak at times, with everything from cinematography to editing apparently done on the cheap. In particular, the opening scene of Hannah's theater performance (as one example) filmed in a painfully uncertain way that it makes it hard to figure out what's going on. As Protestant films go, this movie is more in the B-grade league of &#34;God is Not Dead&#34; and &#34;Heaven is For Real&#34; than A-list material like Robert Duvall's &#34;The Apostle,&#34; &#34;Elizabeth,&#34; or &#34;Luther.&#34; Some may like that style, with its mix of sanctimony and sincerity, but I'm not a big fan myself.On the positive side, the road trip setting of the plot yields some entertainment value, particularly with the group of scruffy college friends who accompany Hendrix's character on a journey to find her identity in Mobile. The big scene between Baptist heroine Hannah and a Catholic priest in Alabama's St. Paul cathedral is a nice ecumenical moment, even if the answers it offers for the film's dilemmas are a bit too pat. Also, the DVD is loaded with fascinating extra features, including documentaries about the true story and a music video. Altogether, this film is a noble effort with good intentions, but &#34;Bella&#34; and &#34;Gimme Shelter&#34; are really the gold standard in pro-life dramas, and there are many better faith-based productions out there.",4,Heartfelt Christian drama with B-level acting,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,2479,"['109-minute', 'drama', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'Protestant', 'Christian', 'drama', 'college', 'girl', 'named', 'Hannah', 'who', 'adopted', 'survivor', 'botched', 'abortion', '34', 'October', 'Baby', '34', '2011', 'heartfelt', 'characters', 'are', 'frequently', 'appealing', 'upbeat', 'pop', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'undermined', 'notch', 'B-level', 'acting', 'amateur', 'filmmaking', 'techniques.In', 'particular', 'female', 'lead', 'Rachel', 'Hendrix', 'convey', 'realistic', 'sense', 'emotional', 'physical', 'trauma', 'only', 'scratching', 'surface', 'character', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'suffering', 'significant', 'behavioral', 'problems', '20-year', 'old', 'Hannah', 'Hendrix', 'attempt', 'portray', 'trauma-scarred', 'behavior', 'moody', 'teenage', 'angst', 'Compared', 'soul-wrenching', 'performance', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'similar', '34', 'Gim', 'Shelter', '34', '2014', 'also', 'pro-life', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Hendrix', 'minor', 'leaguer', '34', 'October', 'Baby', '34', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'stronger', 'actress', 'here', 'Character', 'motivations', 'particularly', 'Hannah', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'are', 'frequently', 'unclear.The', 'technical', 'style', 'film', 'also', 'weak', 'times', 'everything', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'apparently', 'done', 'cheap', 'particular', 'opening', 'scene', 'Hannah', 'theater', 'performance', 'one', 'example', 'filmed', 'painfully', 'uncertain', 'way', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Protestant', 'films', 'go', 'movie', 'more', 'B-grade', 'league', '34', 'God', 'Not', 'Dead', '34', '34', 'Heaven', 'Real', '34', 'A-list', 'material', 'Robert', 'Duvall', '34', 'Apostle', '34', '34', 'Elizabeth', '34', '34', 'Luther.', '34', 'may', 'like', 'style', 'mix', 'sanctimony', 'sincerity', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'myself.On', 'positive', 'side', 'road', 'trip', 'setting', 'plot', 'entertainment', 'value', 'particularly', 'group', 'scruffy', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'accompany', 'Hendrix', 'character', 'journey', 'find', 'identity', 'Mobile', 'big', 'scene', 'Baptist', 'heroine', 'Hannah', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Alabama', 'St.', 'Paul', 'cathedral', 'nice', 'ecumenical', 'moment', 'even', 'answers', 'film', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'Also', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'fascinating', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'documentaries', 'true', 'story', 'music', 'video', 'Altogether', 'film', 'noble', 'effort', 'good', 'intentions', '34', 'Bella', '34', '34', 'Gim', 'Shelter', '34', 'are', 'really', 'gold', 'standard', 'pro-life', 'dramas', 'are', 'many', 'better', 'faith-based', 'productions', 'there']",N/A

I would recommend watching this, whether you are prolife or prochoice.",4,Good movie about a relevant topic,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,608,"['only', 'reserve', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'said', 'found', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'believable', 'story', 'college', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'told', 'was', 'adopted', 'mother', 'attempted', 'abort', 'question', 'how', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'survive', 'attempted', 'abortion', 'movie', 'showed', 'how', 'beginning', 'life', 'caused', 'grief', 'everyone', 'involved', 'girl', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'even', 'girl', 'biological', 'mother', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'are', 'prolife', 'prochoice']",N/A

I don't see this as a movie primarily about abortion, perhaps because abortion has never directly touched my life, but I DO know what it's like to be the father of a beloved daughter who's a little bit lost, and going though a difficult period of her life, and wishing more than anything that I could protect her and find a way to make it all better. And, to me, that's what this movie is really about.Does this movie have an anti-abortion message? Don't be silly - of course it does. Am I particularly religious or conservative? No, I'm not. Do I believe in a woman's right to choose? I do (but not at 24 weeks as is the basis of this story) Did I enjoy this movie? Absolutely. I can find a lot more in this film than just as a one-dimensional political agenda. It is a wonderful movie about compassion, and love, and forgiveness, and moving on, and friendship... and a parent's love for their child, and the goodness of strangers... and a little bit of romantic comedy to lighten it up a bit, There is so much beauty in this story that I can only pity those that can see it only through the myopic lenses of political dogma. And I say this as someone who WOULD normally turn off a movie that was blindingly conservative.Yeah, it's a bit heavy-handed with the emotional drama, and the underlying message is obvious, but so what? - enjoy this for the uplifting movie that it is - about real people trying to do the right thing and find their way through life as best they can. First and foremost, this is a movie about LOVE, not right-wing indoctrination. Don't let your anger or fear keep you from enjoying this emotional, but ultimately rewarding story.It is rated PG-13 but only for the intensity of the emotions, and the mature subject matter. There is no profanity, violence, or sexuality. Have no fear of watching it with your mature teen. We all are entitled to our own opinions, but I think the majority will agree with what I'm trying to honestly report to you here.",4,"A wonderful story of love, for those who don't let politics skew their appreciation...",1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,2108,"['consider', 'liberal', 'Understand', 'when', 'tell', 'heart', 'see', 'people', 'pan', 'movie', 'political', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'primarily', 'abortion', 'perhaps', 'abortion', 'never', 'directly', 'touched', 'life', 'DO', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'father', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'lost', 'going', 'difficult', 'period', 'life', 'wishing', 'more', 'anything', 'could', 'protect', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'better', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about.Does', 'movie', 'have', 'anti-abortion', 'message', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'silly', 'course', 'Am', 'particularly', 'religious', 'conservative', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'Do', 'believe', 'woman', 'right', 'choose', 'do', 'not', '24', 'weeks', 'basis', 'story', 'Did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'can', 'find', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'political', 'agenda', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'compassion', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'moving', 'friendship', 'parent', 'love', 'child', 'goodness', 'strangers', 'little', 'bit', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lighten', 'up', 'bit', 'so', 'much', 'beauty', 'story', 'can', 'only', 'pity', 'can', 'see', 'only', 'myopic', 'lenses', 'political', 'dogma', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'WOULD', 'normally', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'was', 'blindingly', 'conservative.Yeah', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'emotional', 'drama', 'underlying', 'message', 'obvious', 'so', 'what', 'enjoy', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'find', 'way', 'life', 'can', 'First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'LOVE', 'not', 'right-wing', 'indoctrination', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anger', 'fear', 'keep', 'enjoying', 'emotional', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'story.It', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'only', 'intensity', 'emotions', 'mature', 'subject', 'matter', 'profanity', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'Have', 'fear', 'watching', 'mature', 'teen', 'are', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinions', 'think', 'majority', 'will', 'agree', 'what', ""'m"", 'trying', 'honestly', 'report', 'here']",N/A

This is what our teenagers should be seeing.Many deep emotional issues were explored. In my view the movie was quite realistic. Hannah was from a Christian family  and the behavior is very characteristic.

However, the subject of the movie may not be appropriate for young children.I purchased this movie the day that it came out from Walmart. Neither Amazon, nor Best Buy had it on Blu ray or DVD and they still don't have it for sale (...as you can see above it says unavailable!). Amazon just lists several used DVD copies to buy from. No new copy. You can buy a brand new copy from Walmart. Forget Amazon as far as purchasing a decent movie. I don't want to draw any conclusions and I don't want to speculate on the motivations of why Amazon and/or Best Buy don't carry the movie. But make sure you pressure Amazon to get the Blu ray and DVD version at a good price.The movie is about the emotional stress of a teenager who finds out that she was adopted. On top of everything else she finds out that she survived an abortion that destroyed her tween brother. Very difficult (emotionally) to watch some of the scenes. While the acting is not at the level of a five star movie, I gave five stars because of the courage of the director, the producers, and the actors to make such a movie in the current tense political situation where everybody talks about abortion as being an undeniable woman's right. This subject is very actual and controversial. What about the baby's rights? What about her brother's rights? This movie brings everything in perspective.The ending may be predictable but it is a good and positive ending!!!Make sure you watch the movie even after it is all over, when the titles are rolling. You will get several details in there from the director and one of the movie participants that you don't expect. Usually people don't get emotional after the movie ends when the titles are rolling. In this case somebody shares real life drama. Expect the unexpected and keep the Kleenex box handy!",5,Very good movie.
