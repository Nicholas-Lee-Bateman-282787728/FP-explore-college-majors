A nicely done documentary with lots of historical facts. I wish there was more about collecting and such... but I have to admit that maybe if they added that the whole thing will be ruined.I will recommend it to any person. A walk thru memory lane is never a wasted one. ^_^,5,Very surprised!,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,387,"['got', 'collector', 'friend', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'informative', 'value', 'once', 'saw', 'understood', 'A', 'nicely', 'done', 'documentary', 'lots', 'historical', 'facts', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'collecting', 'such', 'have', 'admit', 'maybe', 'added', 'whole', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'ruined.I', 'will', 'recommend', 'person', 'walk', 'thru', 'memory', 'lane', 'never', 'wasted', 'one', '^_^']",GI Joe Documentary The Story Of America's Movable Fighting Man

167530,A157IE7NCEPPKV,0972597506,John Cox,"[6, 6]","This is not a cheap promo knock-off. This is a serious, well-made documentary about the history and development of GI Joe. This documentary contains interviews with many of the men and women who created Joe, and their recollections are fascinating. The majority of this 2-hour documentary is focused on the creation of Joe... My only complaint is once we launch into the history of Joe, scant little time (maybe all of 5 minutes) is spent on the Adventure Team era (1970-77). How is possible to do a 2-hour documentary on GI Joe with no mention of Kung Fu Grip or Mike Powers Atomic Man? Still, I was pleased to see how much time was spent on the '80s 3-3/4 inch Real American Hero Joes, and I was very interested to learn the story being the triumphant return of the full-sized Joe in 1991.  So with my Adventure Team disappointment set aside (and maybe I'm only disappointed because this was my Joe era), I highly recommend this documentary to GI Joe fans and fans of baby boomer era toys.",5,"A well-made, serious look at a legendary toy.",1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,991,"['not', 'cheap', 'promo', 'knock-off', 'serious', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'history', 'development', 'GI', 'Joe', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'many', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'created', 'Joe', 'recollections', 'are', 'fascinating', 'majority', '2-hour', 'documentary', 'focused', 'creation', 'Joe', 'only', 'complaint', 'once', 'launch', 'history', 'Joe', 'scant', 'little', 'time', 'maybe', '5', 'minutes', 'spent', 'Adventure', 'Team', 'era', '1970-77', 'How', 'possible', 'do', '2-hour', 'documentary', 'GI', 'Joe', 'mention', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Grip', 'Mike', 'Powers', 'Atomic', 'Man', 'Still', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', ""'80s"", '3-3/4', 'inch', 'Real', 'American', 'Hero', 'Joes', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'learn', 'story', 'being', 'triumphant', 'return', 'full-sized', 'Joe', '1991', 'So', 'Adventure', 'Team', 'disappointment', 'set', 'aside', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'only', 'disappointed', 'was', 'Joe', 'era', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'GI', 'Joe', 'fans', 'fans', 'baby', 'boomer', 'era', 'toys']",GI Joe Documentary The Story Of America's Movable Fighting Man

What is it about the endless adventure possible in our pal, Joe?  Every aspect is explored in this documentary.  Not only was the toy conceptually risky, but the lengths that its creators went through to bring it to us are as astounding as Joe's adventures, themselves.  The unlikely subject of a toy line becomes a genuinely gripping, suspenseful, and honestly moving story about art, optimism, and the beauty of play.  I found myself emotionally engaged on numerous levels as the story of this piece of Americana was shared.  Fans of toys, nostalgia, business, and American culture will find much to love in this documentary.
