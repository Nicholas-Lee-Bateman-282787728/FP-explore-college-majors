That's actually what got me to like him so much.  I love how I get a real good stretch, but don't have to hold it til I lose my balance!  I have fibromyalgia and sometimes my muscles really hurt, but his gentle way of guiding me into the moves, and not making me feel bad for not holding it long, I feel is a plus.  I think that even if I happen to be a real good yoga practitioner, the stretch is what's the most important, I don't think that 'how long' you can hold it matters so  much as actually doing the move right.  Just my opinion, but makes sense to me.  His voice is so calm and smooth. The scenery is stunning, and I really feel that I'm there with him practicing.  Yes, the routine is about 20 min., but that is also what made me want to buy this DVD, (mainly because it's by Rodney though).  He's very serious about this art, (as he should be), but he also makes sure that you have some fun while doing the moves.  He's shown how to meditate so well, even on DVD's like this one, so I'm really looking forward to getting the one I ordered from him that he actually teaches nothing but meditation.

If you are currently experiencing back issues, especially lower back, I would not recommend this DVD at all.

There must be a tremendous market for home self-care. Rodney Yee creates a nice, mellow mood, with soothing background music. The production value is high. The pace is pleasant and not too fast.  I was surprised by those who wrote that Yee moves too quickly.  I politely disagree! My wife brought me 2 yoga tapes- Yee's and one with a female instructor. I tried the latter, thinking she would be less aggressive.  Wrong! I had to discard that one immediately. Yee is far easier on a new guy- and his back! There seems to be disagreement on the tape's length.  The answer must lie in the promotional material at the start. Simply fast forward until the instruction starts. I did notice that Rodney got left and right mixed up. In those instances, I do what he says and not as he does. Am I the only reviewer who picked up on this?

The tape is laid out with 8 minutes of stretches and hip openers, 8 minutes of active workout to build abs and back muscles, and 4 minutes of guided relaxation to heal the mind and body.  During the video I was surprised to see the poses done so quickly and so many of them.  In other yoga videos that I have seen, the pace appears to be a little slower.  This being said, I did enjoy it.I borrowed this tape from the library so I could save a couple of $$$.  I now see that the small investment in the purchase price will be needed to remember all the poses.  The guiding that Rodney Yee offers is very helpful.  He has an ability to speak in such clarity that you don't need to twist even more to look at the TV as the poses are occurring.
