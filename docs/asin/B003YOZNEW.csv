How interesting is it to be a fly on the wall documenting history as it happens.  There is a unique relationship that is almost as as close as the President's Chief of Staff.  The President has to have a very intimate trust in the person to document there official and unofficial life.,5,One of the most interesting jobs a photographer can have,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,412,"['Presidential', 'Photographer', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'Office', 'President', 'person', 'occupying', 'Office', 'How', 'interesting', 'be', 'fly', 'wall', 'documenting', 'history', 'unique', 'relationship', 'almost', 'as', 'close', 'President', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'President', 'have', 'very', 'intimate', 'trust', 'person', 'document', 'there', 'official', 'unofficial', 'life']",N/A

Every president since LBJ, with the predictable exception of Richard Nixon, has allowed his chief photographer extraordinary access to his daily life, both public and private. Pete Souza and his assistants process and catalogue up to 80,000 photos a month, showing the President in the White House, at Congress, in dozens of top-level diplomatic and political occasions, on Air Force One, on the road across America, on the lawn with his children sun or snow, on the basketball court with his closest aides. The most potent realization that emerges from this documentary is the intensity of constant observation, scrutiny, surveillance that a president must endure.If you have any notion that Barack Obama lives in secrecy or guards his thoughts from the public, this film will convince you otherwise. The ""real"" Obama, though he needs to be on camera all day every day, gives a surprising impression of ordinary decency, friendliness, equanimity, even-tempered professionalism in a profession for which there's no preparation except 'on the job.' What do you know, our Man in the White House is a likable guy! Appropriately serious, obviously sharp as a tack, intent on service.The film also shows videos and stills from the presidencies of Johnson, Ford, Bush 1, and Bush 2, providing both contrast and confirmation. Bush 2 seems rather likable in the mostly domestic scenes included. Johnson was a natural in front of the camera, both relaxed and overbearing, just as he was in action. Bush 2 seems completely at a loss half the time and insincere the rest. I'm probably biased, as were the makers of the film perhaps, but Obama appears less like a career politician and more like a hard-working human being than any of his well-documented predecessors.",5,An Intimate Look at Barack Obama ...,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,1926,"['lens', 'shoulder', 'most', 'constant', 'companion', 'Chief', 'Presidential', 'Photographer', 'Pete', 'Souza', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'photo', 'staff', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Every', 'president', 'LBJ', 'predictable', 'exception', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'allowed', 'chief', 'photographer', 'extraordinary', 'access', 'daily', 'life', 'public', 'private', 'Pete', 'Souza', 'assistants', 'process', 'catalogue', 'up', '80,000', 'photos', 'month', 'showing', 'President', 'White', 'House', 'Congress', 'dozens', 'top-level', 'diplomatic', 'political', 'occasions', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'road', 'America', 'lawn', 'children', 'sun', 'snow', 'basketball', 'court', 'closest', 'aides', 'most', 'potent', 'realization', 'documentary', 'intensity', 'constant', 'observation', 'scrutiny', 'surveillance', 'president', 'must', 'endure.If', 'have', 'notion', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'secrecy', 'guards', 'thoughts', 'public', 'film', 'will', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'real', 'Obama', 'be', 'camera', 'day', 'day', 'surprising', 'impression', 'ordinary', 'decency', 'friendliness', 'equanimity', 'even-tempered', 'professionalism', 'profession', 'preparation', 'job', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'Man', 'White', 'House', 'likable', 'guy', 'Appropriately', 'serious', 'obviously', 'sharp', 'tack', 'intent', 'service.The', 'film', 'also', 'videos', 'stills', 'presidencies', 'Johnson', 'Ford', 'Bush', '1', 'Bush', '2', 'providing', 'contrast', 'confirmation', 'Bush', '2', 'rather', 'likable', 'mostly', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'included', 'Johnson', 'was', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'relaxed', 'overbearing', 'just', 'was', 'action', 'Bush', '2', 'completely', 'loss', 'time', 'insincere', 'rest', ""'m"", 'probably', 'biased', 'were', 'makers', 'film', 'perhaps', 'Obama', 'less', 'career', 'politician', 'more', 'hard-working', 'human', 'being', 'well-documented', 'predecessors']",N/A
