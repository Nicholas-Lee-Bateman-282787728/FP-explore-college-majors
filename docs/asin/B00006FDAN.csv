It's a real shame too as it has some talent in it's ranks like James Earl Jones, Dana Carvey, and Kevin Pollak. However, this was very unfunny. Mind you my heart really wasn't into this movie anyway as I had a rejection the night before I saw this, so I couldn't focus into the movie, but there really wasn't anything to focus into here. It's about a guy who has amnesia whenever he goes to sleep, and he ends up witnessing a murder.....what's so funny about that? I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not ""THE"" worst movie ever made. This was even worse than ""Ishtar"" folks. I don't have any desire to see this again, and I won't own it either.

The premise has him trying to make sense of the urgent goings-on around him, and is used to great effect. Don't want to ruin the plot, so just go watch it!Don't be discouraged by the three stars.

713072,A1WFQPYY8YBXEM,B00006FDAN,"NewMan ""Simplify""","[0, 0]","It's not screamingly funny, but unfortunately it is Dana's best solo starring movie to date.Carvey and Golino work well together and create real characters out of a pretty one dimensional script. Plus, there's Kevin Pollack who's turned out to be far more talented as an actor than he ever was as a comedian and the ever exquisite Olivia D'Abo (Single Guy (TV), Point of No Return, many bad movies and cartoon voice overs.)This seems like one of those vehicles that starts with a funny idea, but there isn't the writing talent or maybe just a lack of impetus to develop it fully. It's pretty much a one trick pony.Robert King needed a writing committee like the writers for the Simpsons to take a basically funny concept and add joke after joke until there was really something there like they did with Groundhog Day.I saw Pre-SNL Dana live (late '85 or early '86) so I know what it's like to laugh so hard you can't hear all the jokes or breath for that matter. His talent is incredible, but he hasn't has the best of luck in films.This one isn't terrible, but it will never be on anyone's top ten list either.(I actually gave 3 stars but I can't figure out how to change it.)",4,I like it,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,1177,"['not', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'unfortunately', 'Dana', 'best', 'solo', 'starring', 'movie', 'date.Carvey', 'Golino', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'create', 'real', 'characters', 'pretty', 'one', 'dimensional', 'script', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'actor', 'ever', 'was', 'comedian', 'ever', 'exquisite', 'Olivia', ""D'Abo"", 'Single', 'Guy', 'TV', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'many', 'bad', 'movies', 'cartoon', 'voice', 'overs', 'one', 'vehicles', 'funny', 'idea', ""n't"", 'writing', 'talent', 'maybe', 'just', 'lack', 'impetus', 'develop', 'fully', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'trick', 'pony.Robert', 'King', 'needed', 'writing', 'committee', 'writers', 'Simpsons', 'take', 'basically', 'funny', 'concept', 'add', 'joke', 'joke', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'there', 'did', 'Groundhog', 'Day.I', 'saw', 'Pre-SNL', 'Dana', 'live', 'late', ""'85"", 'early', ""'86"", 'so', 'know', 'what', 'laugh', 'so', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'jokes', 'breath', 'matter', 'talent', 'incredible', ""n't"", 'best', 'luck', 'films.This', 'one', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'anyone', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'either', 'actually', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'change']",N/A

This movie doesn't even try and take advantage of any of his impersonations etc, and is just not funny. We start the film with him waking up and a tape recorder that just fills us in to his amnesia. And then the movie disintigrates from there. Not funny, at times hard to follow, and way cheesy unbelieveable.  But, it was before momento and 50 first dates, so you can say that at least some other films got a chance to do it better.
