1061710,A3JNICYJRSVGA9,B000NY1EI0,Comic Online,"[5, 11]","Carlos Mencia is the biggest joke thief alive.  I saw him live many times when i used to work at a comedy club, as well as a few episodes of his show, caught bits and pieces of his specials, and even this turd of a video.  I'm sure he must have SOME original ideas, but soooo much of it is stolen from other comics.In addition, you get lectured like a 5-year old.  I really get tired of him telling me that if i'm not laughing, it's because i'm AFRAID to laugh.  Ummmm.....no.  I'm not laughing because it's not funny. Or i've heard it before, and his delivery is so forceful, he squeezes the funny out of what little was there to begin with.  I'm not offended by ANYTHING he has ever said, except offended for knowing his jokes are lifted, and he's trying to pass them off as his own.  I love really racy, raunchy, rude comedy.  But Carlos just doesn't have the talent.The number of comics i've seen call him on thievery should shame him, but it doesn't.  It you want to see something ORIGINAL, try Richard Pryor, Dave Attell, George Lopez, or even Gabriel Iglesias.  Heck, even Paul Mooney.  He may start a race war, but he's darn funny.",1,The biggest joke-thief alive,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1139,"['Carlos', 'Mencia', 'biggest', 'joke', 'thief', 'alive', 'saw', 'live', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'i', 'used', 'work', 'comedy', 'club', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'caught', 'bits', 'pieces', 'specials', 'even', 'turd', 'video', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'have', 'SOME', 'original', 'ideas', 'soooo', 'much', 'stolen', 'other', 'comics.In', 'addition', 'get', 'lectured', '5-year', 'old', 'really', 'get', 'tired', 'telling', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'laughing', 'i', ""'m"", 'AFRAID', 'laugh', 'Ummmm', '..no', ""'m"", 'not', 'laughing', 'not', 'funny', 'i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'delivery', 'so', 'forceful', 'funny', 'what', 'little', 'was', 'there', 'begin', ""'m"", 'not', 'offended', 'ANYTHING', 'ever', 'said', 'offended', 'knowing', 'jokes', 'are', 'lifted', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'own', 'love', 'really', 'racy', 'raunchy', 'rude', 'comedy', 'Carlos', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent.The', 'number', 'comics', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'call', 'thievery', 'should', 'shame', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'something', 'ORIGINAL', 'try', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'George', 'Lopez', 'even', 'Gabriel', 'Iglesias', 'Heck', 'even', 'Paul', 'Mooney', 'may', 'start', 'race', 'war', 'darn', 'funny']",Carlos Mencia in: The Best of Funny is Funny
