941908,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000BGQUHA,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[7, 11]","""Mazes and Monsters"" was part of the Reagan-era moral panic over the Dungeons and Dragons game. It was an '80s afterschool special,a made-for-TV movie about the dangers of gaming. It was back when fundamentalists considered it occultic, diabolical, and dangerous. This movie was made in response to the infamous Dallas Egbert case at the University of Michigan. While it turned out Egbert was dealing with drug abuse, perfectionist parents, and his closeted homosexuality, D&D; was blamed. The late creator of D&D;, Gary Gygax, was besieged with hate mail when ""Mazes"" was released.""Mazes"" begins as a typical,slice-of-life drama. Kate Finch is dealing with her divorcing parents. Daniel has a perfectionist, materialistic father. Jay-Jay, with his wild assortment of hats,plays it out of the closet-he dresses as Noel Coward for Halloween-his mother is a diva (Jay-Jay is a prototype for the hat-wearing,flamboyant Ryan in Disney's High School Musical) Finally,there's Robbie (Tom Hanks),who's got an alcoholic,Nancy Reagan-like mother. The four come together with their Mazes&Monsters; game. The first half hour of the movie plays it straight (except for Jay-Jay) However,when Robbie slays a ""Gorvil"" (think of one of those green monsters from the OLD Star Trek),he descends into madness. Robbie's cheesy visions take the movie into campy territory. He takes on the persona of Pardu,a holy man. He tells his girlfriend Kate that they have to ""love each other without making love"" (indeed,the wizened sage in his visions commands him to be celibate)--one wonders why conservatives lambasted D&D.; It promotes abstinence! It prolongs virginity! Why  aren't Dungeonmasters being bankrolled for abstinence-only programs? Robbie's quest leads him into NYC. He encounters thugs,as well as a madman,in his quest for ""The Two Towers"" (""That's Tolkien!"" Daniel exclaims) At the World Trade Center, Robbie nearly kills himself to reunite with his lost brother,but his friends save him. In the end, Robbie still thinks he's in the game. He still believes he's Pardu. The scenes at the WTC are poignant. Indeed, Hanks' performance is quite natural and convincing. He's awkward and sympathetic.""Mazes"" makes for good viewing. It's the ""Reefer Madness"" of the '80s. Hanks has a good early role. Despite the sappy theme song ""Friends forever"" and the turgid script, Hanks and the ensemble cast rise above it.As a DVD,""Mazes"" gets a mixed reviewing. It looks like a TV show... from the '80s. Still,quite good. The ""scene selection"" is pretty mediocre&difficult; to use. Unfortunately, there aren't any special features.""Mazes"" is a window on the world of the early D&D; controversy.

941915,A1QRW0KT0D2IXL,B000BGQUHA,danger ex machina,"[16, 18]","On August 15, 1979, a troubled child prodigy named James Egbert slipped into the steam tunnels beneath Michigan State University with a pocket full of 'ludes. And lo, an urban legend was born. You see, James had occasionally played Dungeons & Dragons some time before enrolling at Michigan, and his oblivious parents along with a news media hungry for scandal latched on to the idea that the fantasy world of role playing had driven him to suicide. The reality was Egbert wasn't dead, or even lost in the tunnels, but hiding at various locations in fear of his folks. The truth rarely matters in such circumstances, though, does it? Soon word of other suicides by teenagers who played D&D; began popping up like dandelions in April, and a new hysteria had gripped America. Anti-gaming advocacy groups were formed. Chick tracts were published. The makers of the game even began to change some of their manuals to avoid controversy.  And just before the madness peaked (around 1983), Rona Jaffe published a  fictionalized warning of the sinister power of RPGs, ""Mazes and Monsters"", based loosely on James Egbert's story. This film was a television movie adapted from the novel, and is notable today mostly for starring a young Tom Hanks.Now, before I get started, I'm not a gamer. I've never played an RPG in my life to be honest. However, I know how the 'fear and consumption' media works and a little bit of digging will turn up studies that prove the suicide rate among gamers is lower than the national average. And anything reguritated by the Falwell crowd is automatically suspect to begin with, right? This isn't the usual ""incredibly strange film"" that occupies my late nights. But when you spend money on a movie, even a few bucks, even if it was a year or two ago, don't you kinda feel obligated to watch it if for nothing else than to justify that you got something, anything, for that wasted cash? Ditto, amigo.905 Studios is the party responsible for ""Mazes and Monsters"" DVD debut. This disc doesn't give me much hope for the quality of ""Death Wish Club"", a truly strange film that 905 is allegedly releasing soon. There are no extras, and the transfer isn't very good. ""M&M;"" centers around four university students who decide to play a live action game in the caverns around their school. During one of these sessions, Hanks character goes nuts. ""Bardu"" dreams that his long lost brother is calling him to Manhattan, so he breaks up with his girlfriend (he's a cleric, after all!) and takes off. Well, everyone thinks he's missing in the caverns, and his fellow gamers lie to the police so they won't be expelled. Finally, Hanks snaps out of it for a moment after knifing a mugger, and the gang comes to get him. The final scenes show ""Bardu"" hopelessly and forever immersed in his character as the heartbroken friends decide to play one last campaign with him on his folks estate.As propaganda, ""Mazes and Monsters"" fails on every level. It's not even that entertaining as kitsch like ""Reefer Madness"" or ""Safety Belt For Susie"". Lord knows that theme song gives Debbie Boone some competition in the ghastly department. Maybe someone who games and was a wee tyke (like me) during the time it was made might find it amusing as a time capsule of an era they were too young to remember. I tend to doubt it has much replay value even then. A much better purchase for you wizards and paladins out there (and even us boring folks who don't game or read comics ;) is the 5-disc set of the D&D; toon that ran on CBS. Not only is that series entertaining, but BCI threw in the kitchen sink as far as extras. There's even a D&D; compatable manual included. As for 905, let's hope a truly DVD worthy piece of junk like ""Death Wish Club"" gets the justice it deserves.

Funny and sad in the same context as Reefer Madness, it's akin to a long after-school special in the blunt, inelegant way it hammers away at its only point.

As the poor sap who nosedives into deep mental illness as a direct result of the game, his part is madly corny and he clearly had some growing pains to work through before becoming the dramatic juggernaut we'd all come to know a decade later.

941919,AZCA6JQZWAEVS,B000BGQUHA,Joseph D Baptist,"[4, 5]","Okay, let's start off by making it clear that I'm a gamer.  I started playing D&D; way back in 1980, and was very into it through junior high and high school. One of my earliest jobs was working at a game (not toy) store, and I have worked at several more game stores since then, including managing one.When I first saw Mazes and Monsters (on TV), I was thrilled to see characters enjoying a role playing game (just as that brief D&D; scene in E.T. made so many gamers happy).  I even bought a copy of the book - and enjoyed it - although Rona Jaffe isn't an author I'd generally read.One thing that was clear to me in the book - and it was also fairly clear in the movie - is that the game was a red herring.  It wasn't the game that caused Robbie to lose his grip with reality, it was the way his family failed to deal with the disappearance of his older brother, and the emotional damage that this caused in an otherwise normal seeming teen.In the book/movie, there is a great hubbub about Robbie getting lost in the caves, when he wasn't lost in the caves at all - just as the real life case that ""inspired"" this had everyone in a furor about the student getting lost in the steam tunnels, when he was actually not there, and D&D; had nothing to do with his disappearance.  If anything, this illustrates how much the ""steam tunnels"" urban legend was based on hysteria and fear of the ""different"".  Having a movie - even a mediocre TV movie - about D&D; (even if a fake name was used) is something that helped to bring mainstream awareness to role playing games, and thus probably helped to dispel more ignorance than any number of ""Chick Tracts"" can create.",3,"Not propaganda, and not anti-gaming.",1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,1661,"['Okay', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'making', 'clear', ""'m"", 'gamer', 'started', 'playing', 'D', 'D', 'way', 'back', '1980', 'was', 'very', 'junior', 'high', 'high', 'school', 'One', 'earliest', 'jobs', 'was', 'working', 'game', 'not', 'toy', 'store', 'have', 'worked', 'several', 'more', 'game', 'stores', 'then', 'including', 'managing', 'one.When', 'first', 'saw', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'TV', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'characters', 'enjoying', 'role', 'playing', 'game', 'just', 'brief', 'D', 'D', 'scene', 'E.T', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'gamers', 'happy', 'even', 'bought', 'copy', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'Rona', 'Jaffe', ""n't"", 'author', ""'d"", 'generally', 'read.One', 'thing', 'was', 'clear', 'book', 'was', 'also', 'fairly', 'clear', 'movie', 'game', 'was', 'red', 'herring', 'was', ""n't"", 'game', 'caused', 'Robbie', 'lose', 'grip', 'reality', 'was', 'way', 'family', 'failed', 'deal', 'disappearance', 'older', 'brother', 'emotional', 'damage', 'caused', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'seeming', 'book/movie', 'great', 'hubbub', 'Robbie', 'getting', 'lost', 'caves', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'lost', 'caves', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'inspired', 'had', 'everyone', 'furor', 'student', 'getting', 'lost', 'steam', 'tunnels', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'there', 'D', 'D', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'disappearance', 'anything', 'how', 'much', 'steam', 'tunnels', 'urban', 'legend', 'was', 'based', 'hysteria', 'fear', 'different', 'Having', 'movie', 'even', 'mediocre', 'TV', 'movie', 'D', 'D', 'even', 'fake', 'name', 'was', 'used', 'something', 'helped', 'bring', 'mainstream', 'awareness', 'role', 'playing', 'games', 'thus', 'probably', 'helped', 'dispel', 'more', 'ignorance', 'number', 'Chick', 'Tracts', 'can', 'create']",Mazes and Monsters

941921,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B000BGQUHA,Kendal B. Hunter,"[3, 6]","So what does this movie mean . . . twenty years later?First of all, the footage inside and outside the World Trade Center is worth the cost of DVD, for historical and sentimental reasons.  My memories of the WTC are limited to the King Kong remake, one episode of the Simpsons (wisely taken out of syndication so as not to hurt our feelings--LOL), and flying over the Twin Towers on my way to Portugal.  So I saw them as most of humanity will see them--from a distance and on old films.In a second sense, this film is a must for a Tom Hans devotee.  It has one of Hanks's earliest non-""Bosom Buddies"" performances.  And you can see what the director saw.  Hanks, despite his callowness, still stands out among the rest of the Unknowns in the film.  He gives an A- performance in this midgrade B movie. Of course the script stinks, but it was a vehicle for Hanks, and suggests the much better things that were to come.  So you can enjoy it on that level.So about the dragons . . .I confess that I was a pseudo-gamer, and when this first aired, I caught only the first three minutes before switching it off.  Even at that young age, I was tired  of the Grown-Ups criticizing a game they had never played, nor have understood.  They were just repeating things that other people had told them.  And they would not admit it.  So this film was basically a Scared Strait film, based on hearsay, exaggeration, and a hasty generalization from one incident from Michigan State in 1979.Time's irony is that both adults and Christian fundamentalists have embraced fantasy.  You know that men who criticized D&D; in the 1980's had wives in the 1990's who devoured the Harry Potter books and films.  And many Christians have embraced Tolkien's and C. S. Lewis's Christianity that was all along embedded in their fantasy.Of his own work, Tolkien said, ""The Gospels contain a fairystory, or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories. They contain many marvels-- peculiarly artistic, beautiful, and moving: ""mythical"" in their perfect, self containedsignificance; and among the marvels is the greatest and most complete conceivable eucatastrophe. But this story has entered History and the primary world; the desire and aspiration of sub-creation has been raised to the fulfillment of Creation. The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history. The Resurrection is the eucatastrophe of the story of the Incarnation. This story begins and ends in joy."" (The Tolkien Reader, 88-89).Role-playing games were a way to tap into this joy.  The film illustrated what the hystericals ignored: the reason why people got involved in war-games and fantasy was that their real world. In the film, all the weird students had even weirder parents--controlling, pushy, and therefore evil.  By entering the sub-created fantasy world, it provided a realm where they could experience control.For young adults, and definitely for college students, this control is an essential part of development.  That is why children's games--dress-up, playing house or soldier or Batman--are all important for later development. At some point, you really have to play house, soldier, or really play Batman.This is not quote-unquote escapism.  Tolkien keenly observed that the ""class of men . .  . you expect to be most preoccupied with, and most hostile to, the idea of escape"" are in fact the ""jailers."" (Lewis, On Stories, 63; cf. Tolkien Reader, 79ff).Of course there is a general message here about addictions, with D&D; being a mere vehicle.  War-games can be addictive, but so can video-games, shopping, or drugs.  In this sense, M&M; is like ""Reefer Madness,"" since they both warn about a real, potential danger.The ending of this film is a bit disappointing, and that is where the film falls down.  The message is that D&D; is so bad, if you play it, you are irredeemably doomed.  This is silly propaganda, and it was preaching to the choir for the faithful, or a backfire to people like me.This brings us back to the World Trade Center.  We need to have a proper scale of dangers and valuations.(Bad transfer to DVD, and no bonuses)",2,So what does this movie mean . . . twenty years later?,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,4131,"['So', 'what', 'movie', 'mean', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'First', 'all', 'footage', 'inside', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'cost', 'DVD', 'historical', 'sentimental', 'reasons', 'memories', 'WTC', 'are', 'limited', 'King', 'Kong', 'remake', 'one', 'episode', 'Simpsons', 'wisely', 'taken', 'out', 'syndication', 'so', 'not', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'LOL', 'flying', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'way', 'Portugal', 'saw', 'most', 'humanity', 'will', 'see', 'distance', 'old', 'films.In', 'second', 'sense', 'film', 'must', 'Tom', 'Hans', 'devotee', 'one', 'Hanks', 'earliest', 'non-', 'Bosom', 'Buddies', 'performances', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'saw', 'Hanks', 'callowness', 'still', 'out', 'rest', 'Unknowns', 'film', 'A-', 'performance', 'midgrade', 'B', 'movie', 'course', 'script', 'stinks', 'was', 'vehicle', 'Hanks', 'much', 'better', 'things', 'were', 'come', 'can', 'enjoy', 'level.So', 'dragons', '.I', 'confess', 'was', 'pseudo-gamer', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'caught', 'only', 'first', 'three', 'minutes', 'switching', 'off', 'Even', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'tired', 'Grown-Ups', 'criticizing', 'game', 'had', 'never', 'played', 'have', 'understood', 'were', 'just', 'repeating', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'told', 'would', 'not', 'admit', 'So', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'Scared', 'Strait', 'film', 'based', 'hearsay', 'exaggeration', 'hasty', 'generalization', 'one', 'incident', 'Michigan', 'State', '1979.Time', 'irony', 'adults', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'have', 'embraced', 'fantasy', 'know', 'men', 'who', 'criticized', 'D', 'D', '1980', 'had', 'wives', '1990', 'who', 'devoured', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'films', 'many', 'Christians', 'have', 'embraced', 'Tolkien', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'Christianity', 'was', 'along', 'embedded', 'fantasy.Of', 'own', 'work', 'Tolkien', 'said', 'Gospels', 'contain', 'fairystory', 'story', 'larger', 'kind', 'essence', 'fairy-stories', 'contain', 'many', 'marvels', 'peculiarly', 'artistic', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'mythical', 'perfect', 'self', 'containedsignificance', 'marvels', 'greatest', 'most', 'complete', 'conceivable', 'eucatastrophe', 'story', 'entered', 'History', 'primary', 'world', 'desire', 'aspiration', 'sub-creation', 'been', 'raised', 'fulfillment', 'Creation', 'Birth', 'Christ', 'eucatastrophe', 'Man', 'history', 'Resurrection', 'eucatastrophe', 'story', 'Incarnation', 'story', 'joy', 'Tolkien', 'Reader', '88-89', '.Role-playing', 'games', 'were', 'way', 'tap', 'joy', 'film', 'illustrated', 'what', 'hystericals', 'ignored', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'got', 'involved', 'war-games', 'fantasy', 'was', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'weird', 'students', 'had', 'even', 'weirder', 'parents', 'controlling', 'pushy', 'therefore', 'evil', 'entering', 'sub-created', 'fantasy', 'world', 'provided', 'realm', 'where', 'could', 'experience', 'control.For', 'young', 'adults', 'definitely', 'college', 'students', 'control', 'essential', 'part', 'development', 'why', 'children', 'games', 'dress-up', 'playing', 'house', 'soldier', 'Batman', 'are', 'important', 'later', 'development', 'point', 'really', 'have', 'play', 'house', 'soldier', 'really', 'play', 'Batman.This', 'not', 'quote-unquote', 'escapism', 'Tolkien', 'keenly', 'observed', 'class', 'men', 'expect', 'be', 'most', 'preoccupied', 'most', 'hostile', 'idea', 'escape', 'are', 'fact', 'jailers', 'Lewis', 'Stories', '63', 'cf', 'Tolkien', 'Reader', '79ff', '.Of', 'course', 'general', 'message', 'here', 'addictions', 'D', 'D', 'being', 'mere', 'vehicle', 'War-games', 'can', 'be', 'addictive', 'so', 'can', 'video-games', 'shopping', 'drugs', 'sense', 'M', 'M', 'Reefer', 'Madness', 'warn', 'real', 'potential', 'danger.The', 'ending', 'film', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'where', 'film', 'down', 'message', 'D', 'D', 'so', 'bad', 'play', 'are', 'irredeemably', 'doomed', 'silly', 'propaganda', 'was', 'preaching', 'choir', 'faithful', 'backfire', 'people', 'me.This', 'brings', 'back', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'need', 'have', 'proper', 'scale', 'dangers', 'valuations', 'Bad', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'bonuses']",Mazes and Monsters
941922,A5UGX57EV695M,B000BGQUHA,Kenneth M. Pizzi,"[2, 2]","Before Tom Hanks joined Hollywood's A-list, the actor starred in a comedy series called ""Bosom Buddies"" on ABC and several forgettable made-for-tv dramas like this one, ""Mazes and Monsters"" created to capitalize on the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" hysteria and bad press the game received during the early 80's.  Despite a fairly good cast, mostly in cameo roles (Anne Francis, Murray Hamilton, Lloyd Bochner, Susan Strasberg) and Chris Makespeace (""My Bodyguard""), and a interesting premise about a college student who retreats into a fantasy world depicted by the game itself; his character ""Pardu,"" the vehicle of his quest for the ""Great Hall"" (subconscious guilt over his brother's death) and the ""Two Towers""--a ""quest"" that takes him from the bowels of NYC's subway system to the World Trade Center.Adapted from the Rona Jaffe novel of the same name, the film has some good scenes, but tends to drag in the middle.  And the love interest between Hank's character and the female lead seems rather forced and artificial only to move the plodding storyline along. (After Hank's character leaves her for his ""quest,"" she immediately takes up with the other male member from this quartet of gameplayers.)The movie serves no real purpose but to show, albeit negatively, that ""D & D"" players are nothing more than your brighter-than-average talented misfits that never ""fit in"" who dream and manufacture their own world of monsters, heroes, heroines, and far off places. The parents too are mere cardboard cutouts of the same tired cliche: Robbie's mother is an alcoholic, Jay-Jay's mother is a vapid interior decorator who changes his room every semester.  The ending of the film, however, was unexpected and helps dispel some of the bad reputation most, if not all, made-for-tv movies have earned over the years.  This transfer to DVD is rather poor and a very bad transfer overall.  I bought mine for $3.99 at Ross Dress for Less.The most telling and effective scene occurs at the end of the film when Robbie's friends visit the protagonist at his home (apparently on leave from the university and recovering from a nervous breakdown); we think he is recovered and ready to join his friends back in school next semester, but alas, he only sees them as the fictional characters they portrayed on a gameboard--his idyllic backyard the setting for yet another adventure.Hanks does his best given the limited material and script he had to work with (he had done pretty much only comedy at this point) but it's a solid reading that would provide this actor with a springboard to a distinguished acting career and several Academy Award winning performances to follow.",2,A passable time-filler....really nothing more...,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2658,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'joined', 'Hollywood', 'A-list', 'actor', 'starred', 'comedy', 'series', 'called', 'Bosom', 'Buddies', 'ABC', 'several', 'forgettable', 'made-for-tv', 'dramas', 'one', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'created', 'capitalize', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'hysteria', 'bad', 'press', 'game', 'received', 'early', '80', 'fairly', 'good', 'cast', 'mostly', 'cameo', 'roles', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'Lloyd', 'Bochner', 'Susan', 'Strasberg', 'Chris', 'Makespeace', 'Bodyguard', 'interesting', 'premise', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'fantasy', 'world', 'depicted', 'game', 'character', 'Pardu', 'vehicle', 'quest', 'Great', 'Hall', 'subconscious', 'guilt', 'brother', 'death', 'Two', 'Towers', 'quest', 'bowels', 'NYC', 'subway', 'system', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center.Adapted', 'Rona', 'Jaffe', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'good', 'scenes', 'drag', 'middle', 'love', 'interest', 'Hank', 'character', 'female', 'lead', 'rather', 'forced', 'artificial', 'only', 'move', 'plodding', 'storyline', 'Hank', 'character', 'quest', 'immediately', 'up', 'other', 'male', 'member', 'quartet', 'gameplayers', 'movie', 'real', 'purpose', 'show', 'albeit', 'negatively', 'D', 'D', 'players', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'brighter-than-average', 'talented', 'misfits', 'never', 'fit', 'who', 'dream', 'manufacture', 'own', 'world', 'monsters', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'far', 'off', 'places', 'parents', 'too', 'are', 'mere', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'same', 'tired', 'cliche', 'Robbie', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'Jay-Jay', 'mother', 'vapid', 'interior', 'decorator', 'who', 'room', 'semester', 'ending', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'unexpected', 'dispel', 'bad', 'reputation', 'most', 'not', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'have', 'earned', 'years', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'rather', 'poor', 'very', 'bad', 'transfer', 'overall', 'bought', 'mine', '3.99', 'Ross', 'Dress', 'Less.The', 'most', 'telling', 'effective', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Robbie', 'friends', 'visit', 'protagonist', 'home', 'apparently', 'leave', 'university', 'recovering', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'think', 'recovered', 'ready', 'join', 'friends', 'back', 'school', 'next', 'semester', 'alas', 'only', 'fictional', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'gameboard', 'idyllic', 'backyard', 'setting', 'yet', 'adventure.Hanks', 'best', 'given', 'limited', 'material', 'script', 'had', 'work', 'had', 'done', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'comedy', 'point', 'solid', 'reading', 'would', 'provide', 'actor', 'springboard', 'distinguished', 'acting', 'career', 'several', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performances', 'follow']",Mazes and Monsters

While this is pretty cool, there is some subpar acting and the movie did not age well. The story is semi-decent and kind of makes you want to know what's going to happen next, but also pulls you slowly along.The one monster you see looks so fake, and the original wolf man looks more realistic than this thing. The outfits are just your normal look for an older movie like this, and the outfits they pick out for the characters they portray( the mazes characters) do look kind of cool. The maps, board, and little figures they use really remind you of Dungeons and dragons, which is cool to see it in a movie.The setting the movie takes place varies between the school, and New York City. The dorms and school campus look like they should, but that would be a hard thing to mess up. The parts they film in New York are cool to see what they looked like years ago. On the other hand, its creepy and sad because you get to see inside the twin Towers, like the lobbies and stairs, with another part showing you what it looks like on the roof.The sound effects don't really add anything to the movie, and the one song you keep hearing over isn't too bad, but they don't really add anything else besides that.This movie has no special features to speak of, but they do allow you to select the scenes (woo...). I mean with older movies like the predator having special features being so old and all, I hoped this would have something.Overall I say if you find this movie on sale or something, it would be worth it to just see the inside of the twin towers.~ Written: August, 2010Positives:* Cool idea with a D&D; Premise* Nice to see how NY looked like years agoNegatives:* Bad special effects* Story slow at times* Subpar acting* Not much in the sound department",1,Way better movies out there,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1949,"['movie', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'playing', 'mazes', 'monsters', '*Cough*', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', '*cough*', 'one', 'mix', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'two', 'pretty', 'cool', 'subpar', 'acting', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'age', 'well', 'story', 'semi-decent', 'kind', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'also', 'slowly', 'along.The', 'one', 'monster', 'see', 'looks', 'so', 'fake', 'original', 'wolf', 'man', 'more', 'realistic', 'thing', 'outfits', 'are', 'just', 'normal', 'look', 'older', 'movie', 'outfits', 'pick', 'out', 'characters', 'portray', 'mazes', 'characters', 'do', 'look', 'kind', 'cool', 'maps', 'board', 'little', 'figures', 'use', 'really', 'remind', 'Dungeons', 'dragons', 'cool', 'see', 'movie.The', 'setting', 'movie', 'place', 'varies', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dorms', 'school', 'campus', 'look', 'should', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'thing', 'mess', 'up', 'parts', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'cool', 'see', 'what', 'looked', 'years', 'ago', 'other', 'hand', 'creepy', 'sad', 'get', 'see', 'twin', 'Towers', 'lobbies', 'stairs', 'part', 'showing', 'what', 'roof.The', 'sound', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'one', 'song', 'keep', 'hearing', 'over', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'else', 'that.This', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'do', 'allow', 'select', 'scenes', 'woo', 'mean', 'older', 'movies', 'predator', 'having', 'special', 'features', 'being', 'so', 'old', 'hoped', 'would', 'have', 'something.Overall', 'say', 'find', 'movie', 'sale', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'just', 'see', 'inside', 'twin', 'towers.~', 'Written', 'August', '2010Positives', '*', 'Cool', 'idea', 'D', 'D', 'Premise*', 'Nice', 'see', 'how', 'NY', 'looked', 'years', 'agoNegatives', '*', 'Bad', 'special', 'effects*', 'Story', 'slow', 'times*', 'Subpar', 'Not', 'much', 'sound', 'department']",Mazes and Monsters
941925,AB3I74FIW58XI,B000BGQUHA,Richard Staats,"[5, 5]","This review contains some spoilers.I've grown to become a Tom Hanks fan over the years.  This movie is one of his forgotten early films.The premise of the film is that a group of young role-playing gamers become a bit *too* involved with a game called ""Mazes and Monsters,"" a blatant reference to Dungeons and Dragons.Tom Hanks plays the boy that falls hard for the role-playing game and comes out psychotic and suicidal.  (One of the climatic scenes eerily takes place on the observation deck of the Twin Towers in New York city.)The entire cast does a good job with their roles (hence the three stars), but ultimately the movie fails to deliver.The most glaring problem is that the premise is not credible.The film was clearly done in response to (actually as a way to exploit) the poor Michigan man that ended up as a suicide victim a year or so before the film was shot.  At the time, the media and some religious groups tried to put role-playing as the central reason for the suicide.  Good investigative work by folks like Mike Stackpole and organizations like the Game Manufacturers of America have gone a long way towards dispelling these kinds of wild ascertions, and today the film just seems like something akin to ""Reefer Madness.""Robin Williams, Al Gore, Mike Myers, and even the royal British princes have all described their experiences with role-playing games.  It is hard to push the suspension of disbelief button when the central premise of the movie is that RPGs form an avenue to the darkest pits of the human soul and invite the players to become addicts and potentially commit suicide.  (Now, if the film has instead showed the kids playing hour after hour and eventually failing out of school then I would have to admit that that premise is credible.)Overall, this film is probably worth a Netflix view, but probably is not worth it as an addition to your film library.",3,Interesting if not enchanting,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1893,"['review', 'spoilers.I', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'become', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fan', 'years', 'movie', 'one', 'forgotten', 'early', 'films.The', 'premise', 'film', 'group', 'young', 'role-playing', 'gamers', 'become', 'bit', '*too*', 'involved', 'game', 'called', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'blatant', 'reference', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons.Tom', 'Hanks', 'boy', 'hard', 'role-playing', 'game', 'out', 'psychotic', 'suicidal', 'One', 'climatic', 'scenes', 'eerily', 'place', 'observation', 'deck', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'entire', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'hence', 'three', 'stars', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'deliver.The', 'most', 'glaring', 'problem', 'premise', 'not', 'credible.The', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'done', 'response', 'actually', 'way', 'exploit', 'poor', 'Michigan', 'man', 'ended', 'up', 'suicide', 'victim', 'year', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'time', 'media', 'religious', 'groups', 'tried', 'put', 'role-playing', 'central', 'reason', 'suicide', 'Good', 'investigative', 'work', 'folks', 'Mike', 'Stackpole', 'organizations', 'Game', 'Manufacturers', 'America', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'dispelling', 'kinds', 'wild', 'ascertions', 'today', 'film', 'just', 'something', 'akin', 'Reefer', 'Madness', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'even', 'royal', 'British', 'princes', 'have', 'described', 'experiences', 'role-playing', 'games', 'hard', 'push', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'button', 'when', 'central', 'premise', 'movie', 'RPGs', 'form', 'avenue', 'darkest', 'pits', 'human', 'soul', 'invite', 'players', 'become', 'addicts', 'potentially', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Now', 'film', 'instead', 'showed', 'kids', 'playing', 'hour', 'hour', 'eventually', 'failing', 'school', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'admit', 'premise', 'credible', 'Overall', 'film', 'probably', 'worth', 'Netflix', 'view', 'probably', 'not', 'worth', 'addition', 'film', 'library']",Mazes and Monsters

941928,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000BGQUHA,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","MAZES AND MONSTERS is a movie about a group of college friends who are bound together by their interest in playing a role-playing game entitled &#34;Mazes and Monsters.&#34; To take the game to the next level and to make the experience more interesting the group begins playing the game in a local cavern. One of the players, Robbie (Tom Hanks) begins having visions and as the lines between reality and fantasy become confused in Robbie's mind, he sets forth on a life-threatening quest. Discovering his destination, his friends set out on a race through New York City to save him before he ends up killing someone or even himself.MAZES AND MONSTERS is a silly movie made and released during the early 1980s about the dangers of role playing games. In the early 1980s there was a large anti-role playing movement, specifically against Dungeons and Dragons. The movement charged that the games were occult based and that people who played the games became possessed or that they slowly lost their minds and ability to distinguish reality from fiction. Though there were only one or two reported cases of such disillusionment, most of the claims from the anti-D&D; camp were shown to be false. Such claims seem funny nowadays, but at the time they were a big deal and were to be taken seriously. Thus, books were written, tv shows were made, and films were produced and we ended up with a lot of crap like MAZES AND MONSTERS.Normally, the appearance of Tom Hanks in any film is enough to raise the quality of any film or television show. Considering also that in MAZES AND MONSTERS Hanks is supported by a cast of talented actors the acting alone should be enough to raise the quality of the film. Unfortunately, that's not the case with this film. The writing, effects, sound, lighting, and directing are just so bad that there is no way for the actors to overcome the deficit. For instance, at one point during what is supposed to be a night scene, there is a fly on the camera lens. Some would argue that MAZES AND MONSTERS is one of those movies that are so bad that they are good to watch. Those arguments are made in vain. MAZES AND MONSTERS is just plain bad. The only reason to watch it is to see a rare film that Tom Hanks is now probably kicking himself for having made or to get an idea what the anti-role playing crowds of the early 1980s were all upset about.
