So many will be able to relate to the plot, setting etc.If you are looking for some great T.V. time, this is  it.

1516094,AZUPF431ILUIH,B006IXRIKI,"FLY QUEEN ""Ace Shopper""","[3, 5]","I love David E. Talbert, but this one was not as funny as he said it was.  A good play but some parts was too silly, over-done.  The fat guy mailman was not funny and I never liked him on standup comedy. He was not funny then, just too big.I did not like the ending of the play when she was still mad with her cheating BF and he called her over to talk and had pastor et al there to propose 2 her and she said YES.He still did not have a job,see a paycheck, pay a bill; he did not apology and suffer long enough. Marrying her then did not ensure that he would not cheat again. He did not have enough time to be celebit and practice 'stop cheating'.Women give in too soon to a man just because he proposes or gives a ring. Those are desperate moves to get her back, not dealing with the problems that separated them, or his cheating. Cheaters just don't quit instantly...this is a long term process. He cheated for years and you think he can stop in a few days or one week just because he lost you, his 'gravy train'.Wake up women. Desperation for a man is dangerous. You will lose more than you could ever gain from it. He must bring something to the table and be EVENLY YOKED WITH YOU. God says...do not be unevenly yoked. He knew that 2 people not of the same status in life, is not  a good thing.I've seen so many uneven married/lovers. It's like a 'misfit', and I know it is from desperation on one or both parts of the couple.DET could have done much more with this one.",4,"GOOD, BUT NOT HIS BEST",1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,1475,"['love', 'David', 'E.', 'Talbert', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'play', 'parts', 'was', 'too', 'silly', 'over-done', 'fat', 'guy', 'mailman', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'never', 'liked', 'standup', 'comedy', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'then', 'just', 'too', 'big.I', 'did', 'not', 'ending', 'play', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'mad', 'cheating', 'BF', 'called', 'talk', 'had', 'pastor', 'et', 'al', 'there', 'propose', '2', 'said', 'YES.He', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'job', 'see', 'paycheck', 'pay', 'bill', 'did', 'not', 'apology', 'suffer', 'long', 'enough', 'Marrying', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'ensure', 'would', 'not', 'cheat', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'be', 'celebit', 'practice', ""cheating'.Women"", 'give', 'too', 'soon', 'man', 'just', 'ring', 'are', 'desperate', 'moves', 'get', 'back', 'not', 'dealing', 'problems', 'separated', 'cheating', 'Cheaters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quit', 'instantly', 'long', 'term', 'process', 'cheated', 'years', 'think', 'can', 'stop', 'few', 'days', 'one', 'week', 'just', 'lost', ""'gravy"", ""train'.Wake"", 'up', 'women', 'Desperation', 'man', 'dangerous', 'will', 'lose', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'gain', 'must', 'bring', 'something', 'table', 'be', 'EVENLY', 'YOKED', 'WITH', 'YOU', 'God', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'unevenly', 'yoked', 'knew', '2', 'people', 'not', 'same', 'status', 'life', 'not', 'good', 'thing.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'uneven', 'married/lovers', ""'misfit"", 'know', 'desperation', 'one', 'parts', 'couple.DET', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'one']",What Goes Around Comes Around
