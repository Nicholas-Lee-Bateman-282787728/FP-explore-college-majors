1281064,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B002OID51M,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""Michael Jackson: Life of a Superstar"" is a MAJOR disappointment. It only gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it moves quickly. In fact, it moves TOO FAST. The documentary manages to cover the Jackson 5 and ""Thriller"" in the space of 10 minutes(!!!) It's kind of dizzying.There are interviews with the important women in Michael Jackson's life- Diana Ross, Elizabeth Taylor, Brooke Shields, Janet Jackson, and Sheryl Crow (whose name is misspelled as ""Sherryl Crow"")It's never explained why Jackson had chaste relationships with Shields and Crow, why he chose Ross to raise his children, and how Taylor served as a mother figure.What's worse is that there is NO MJ music. None at all. ""Thriller"" is discussed--along with its John Landis-directed video--but only scenes from ""Dirty Diana"" are shown. MJ's duet with Janet in ""Scream"" is discussed, but never shown. Pictures of Quincy Jones are shown instead of playing the music from ""Off the Wall"" and ""Thriller."" It's the frustrating lack of music that's surprising. MJ's music is TALKED about, but NEVER played. Isn't the rule ""show, don't tell""?""Life of a Superstar"" promises;it never delivers. It's boring pap about the King of Pop.

Although it is nice to see Michael Jackson and his career on 1 DVD, ihe narration becomes boring after a while and seems just like a person reading out facts about Michael Jackson while images are shown, it just did not captivate me I could only watch it twice then I got bored of it.
