It is a favorite of my wife and I and just the thought of the movie cracks me up (I could digress into a line or two from the Dudley Moore film Arthur, but I won't bother with that here and now...)Dana Carvey, near the height of his own Saturday Night Live fame, makes an hilarious appearance here and a one word utterance by him is one that brings perhaps the biggest smile to my face, or to my wife's face.  Carvey's character was hired by Richard Pryor's character to drive Pryor's precious car across country, unfortunately what Pryor's character never realized is that Carvey is just plain crazy and not the prim and proper individual that he was presented with.Pryor's role for Moving was one of a company employee forced to pick up his family and move to the middle of no where (from Pryor's perspective, and from his family's perspective).  Pryor does his best, or at least thinks he has done his best, to find a nice home to buy, but even that doesn't quite work out as well as he hoped.Basically just about anything that could go wrong does and hilariously so.Ironically, having waited so long to get a DVD release of Moving, the studios have bundled that film with another film that seems to be under appreciated, Greased Lightning.  Greased Lightning is a biopic about a real life NASCAR driver, Wendell Scott.  Scott took up NASCAR when faced with a choice of racing or going to jail.  Along the way he relies upon determination to prove to himself and others that anything is possible, including winning a race in a sport dominated by white drivers.  Scott was the first, and so far (at the time this review was written) the only, Black driver to have accomplished that task.Greased Lightning isn't a bad film, but it isn't the best of Pryor's work either.  He's not bad in the role and does the best he can with the story and direction he's given, but the film itself has a questionable history when it comes to who really did the directing, the director or the writer.Purchasers get a fair bargain here, two films on a single disc at a fairly low price.  Moving is easily worth the purchase price, and getting Greased Lightning as a bonus makes for a nice deal.",4,"So long in coming, I thought I'd never see it...",1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,2484,"['Considering', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Moving', 'played', 'pay', 'cable', 'networks', 'then', 'basic', 'cable', 'channels', 'back', 'when', 'was', ""'new"", 'have', 'ask', 'same', 'question', 'ahead', 'were', 'asking', 'WHAT', 'TOOK', 'SO', 'LONG', 'guess', 'studios', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'market', 'Moving', 'how', 'wrong', 'are', 'favorite', 'wife', 'just', 'thought', 'movie', 'cracks', 'could', 'digress', 'line', 'two', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'film', 'Arthur', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'here', 'now', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'height', 'own', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'fame', 'hilarious', 'appearance', 'here', 'one', 'word', 'utterance', 'one', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'smile', 'face', 'wife', 'face', 'Carvey', 'character', 'was', 'hired', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'character', 'drive', 'Pryor', 'precious', 'car', 'country', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'Pryor', 'character', 'never', 'realized', 'Carvey', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy', 'not', 'prim', 'proper', 'individual', 'was', 'presented', 'with.Pryor', 'role', 'Moving', 'was', 'one', 'company', 'employee', 'forced', 'pick', 'up', 'family', 'move', 'middle', 'where', 'Pryor', 'perspective', 'family', 'perspective', 'Pryor', 'best', 'least', 'thinks', 'done', 'best', 'find', 'nice', 'home', 'buy', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'hoped.Basically', 'just', 'anything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'hilariously', 'so.Ironically', 'having', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'DVD', 'release', 'Moving', 'studios', 'have', 'bundled', 'film', 'film', 'be', 'appreciated', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'biopic', 'real', 'life', 'NASCAR', 'driver', 'Wendell', 'Scott', 'Scott', 'took', 'up', 'NASCAR', 'when', 'faced', 'choice', 'racing', 'going', 'jail', 'way', 'determination', 'prove', 'others', 'anything', 'possible', 'including', 'winning', 'race', 'sport', 'dominated', 'white', 'drivers', 'Scott', 'was', 'first', 'so', 'far', 'time', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'only', 'Black', 'driver', 'have', 'accomplished', 'task.Greased', 'Lightning', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'best', 'Pryor', 'work', 'either', 'not', 'bad', 'role', 'best', 'can', 'story', 'direction', 'given', 'film', 'questionable', 'history', 'when', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'directing', 'director', 'writer.Purchasers', 'get', 'fair', 'bargain', 'here', 'two', 'films', 'single', 'disc', 'fairly', 'low', 'price', 'Moving', 'easily', 'worth', 'purchase', 'price', 'getting', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'bonus', 'nice', 'deal']",N/A
