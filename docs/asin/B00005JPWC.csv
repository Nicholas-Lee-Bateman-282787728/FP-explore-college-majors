657791,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPWC,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 9]","***WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS***Dane Cook is funny but Dan Fogler is hysterical. This is what makes most of GOOD LUCK CHUCK a worthy matinee diversion for the 18-and-over crowd.Director Mark Helfrich of theRUSH HOURmovie franchise pulls in a mediocre comedy with plenty of trashy jokes, lots of sexual innuendo (and quite a bit of flat-out sexage and breastage), and a surprising character study of sex in the 2000's.The story is that of Charlie (comedian turned actor Dane Cook), a dentist who is suddenly seen as a good luck charm of sorts. What he does is have sex with women and then the very next person that that woman dates, she falls head-over-heels in love with and marries. It happens without exception, and women flock to his dental office hoping to get into Charlie's pants just once so that they can find their true love after him.Aiding Charlie in this discovery is buddy Stu (Dan Fogler, BALLS OF FURY), a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast augmentation, and who also has an office next door to Charlie's dental practice. Stu is the consummate `guy who's never grown up,' thinking only about when and where his next sexual exploitation might happen (this includes lonely nights at home with grapefruits warmed up in microwaves!)Charlie initially follows Stu's advice and has sex with just about any attractive woman who comes knocking. But then Charlie meets Cam (Jessica Alba,FANTASTIC FOUR) and Charlie is immediately smitten. Wanting to follow his heart, Charlie fears that by getting intimate with her he'll lose her.Stu and Charlie eventually rig up a test run to see if Charlie's good luck powers are real or if they're just extreme coincidence. Initially everything seems to go Charlie's way, but soon he discovers that they aren't. The test run fails and Charlie remembers a childhood curse put on him (which is how the film starts).Amongst this mix is another great character named Joe (Lonny Ross) who is Cam's brother and a technician at a water park. He and his sister help out with the penguin exhibit, and it is during their conversations about work, love, and obsession that many funny (and occasionally profound) moments come spilling onto the screen. Joe is a stoner who likes to play jokes on the penguins and this is hysterically funny. But he also helps out his sister in unique and surprising ways (i.e., by giving her insights into her life that she'd overlooked, etc.).But without Dan Fogler, this film may have flopped big time. His Stu character is undoubtedly the funniest of the cast. He's got all the great lines (from ""man-chowder"" on up) and finally gets what he wants when he discovers the breasts of his dreams.The jokes are often sinfully gross and there's plenty of sex scenes to stir the loins of every pubescent male out there. Even the ending credits hold a crude yet laugh-out-loud moment, not willing to let the audience leave until they've hit upon every sexual depravity known to man. Even so, this is a good diversion for a slow afternoon, and it's one that's sure to make you wheeze and laugh at its ridiculous nature.",3,A Decent Matinee Diversion,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,3083,"['***WARNING', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***Dane', 'Cook', 'funny', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'hysterical', 'what', 'most', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'CHUCK', 'worthy', 'matinee', 'diversion', '18-and-over', 'crowd.Director', 'Mark', 'Helfrich', 'theRUSH', 'HOURmovie', 'franchise', 'pulls', 'mediocre', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'trashy', 'jokes', 'lots', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'quite', 'bit', 'flat-out', 'sexage', 'breastage', 'surprising', 'character', 'study', 'sex', ""2000's.The"", 'story', 'Charlie', 'comedian', 'turned', 'actor', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'dentist', 'who', 'suddenly', 'seen', 'good', 'luck', 'charm', 'sorts', 'What', 'have', 'sex', 'women', 'then', 'very', 'next', 'person', 'woman', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'marries', 'exception', 'women', 'flock', 'dental', 'office', 'hoping', 'get', 'Charlie', 'pants', 'just', 'once', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'him.Aiding', 'Charlie', 'discovery', 'buddy', 'Stu', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'BALLS', 'OF', 'FURY', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'who', 'breast', 'augmentation', 'who', 'also', 'office', 'next', 'door', 'Charlie', 'dental', 'practice', 'Stu', 'consummate', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'grown', 'up', 'thinking', 'only', 'when', 'where', 'next', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'might', 'happen', 'lonely', 'nights', 'home', 'grapefruits', 'warmed', 'up', 'microwaves', 'Charlie', 'initially', 'Stu', 'advice', 'sex', 'just', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'knocking', 'then', 'Charlie', 'meets', 'Cam', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'Charlie', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'Wanting', 'follow', 'heart', 'Charlie', 'getting', 'intimate', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'her.Stu', 'Charlie', 'eventually', 'up', 'test', 'run', 'see', 'Charlie', 'good', 'luck', 'powers', 'are', 'real', ""'re"", 'just', 'extreme', 'coincidence', 'Initially', 'everything', 'go', 'Charlie', 'way', 'soon', 'are', ""n't"", 'test', 'run', 'fails', 'Charlie', 'childhood', 'curse', 'put', 'how', 'film', '.Amongst', 'mix', 'great', 'character', 'named', 'Joe', 'Lonny', 'Ross', 'who', 'Cam', 'brother', 'technician', 'water', 'park', 'sister', 'help', 'penguin', 'exhibit', 'conversations', 'work', 'love', 'obsession', 'many', 'funny', 'occasionally', 'profound', 'moments', 'come', 'spilling', 'screen', 'Joe', 'stoner', 'who', 'play', 'jokes', 'penguins', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'also', 'out', 'sister', 'unique', 'surprising', 'ways', 'i.e.', 'giving', 'insights', 'life', ""'d"", 'overlooked', 'etc', '.But', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'flopped', 'big', 'time', 'Stu', 'character', 'undoubtedly', 'funniest', 'cast', 'got', 'great', 'lines', 'man-chowder', 'finally', 'what', 'when', 'breasts', 'dreams.The', 'jokes', 'are', 'often', 'sinfully', 'gross', 'plenty', 'sex', 'scenes', 'stir', 'loins', 'pubescent', 'male', 'there', 'Even', 'ending', 'credits', 'hold', 'crude', 'yet', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moment', 'not', 'willing', 'let', 'audience', 'leave', ""'ve"", 'hit', 'sexual', 'depravity', 'known', 'man', 'Even', 'so', 'good', 'diversion', 'slow', 'afternoon', 'one', 'sure', 'make', 'wheeze', 'laugh', 'ridiculous', 'nature']",N/A

I mean this movie makes you want to take a bath in clorox.I suppose this is what happens when someone who thinks they are funny, watches a Judd Apatow movie and says (very mistakenly), ""Hey, that looks easy.  I can do that.""As a 40ish young man, I am all for toilet humor, sexual innuendo, and gags about female anatomy.

Bede,"[3, 5]","The premise of Good Luck Chuck - a guy believes he's cursed to never find true love, but every woman who sleeps with him will, with someone else - could have made for romantic comedy gold.  Instead, the movie reaches for the lowest common denominator at every opportunity, and usually succeeds.Which is about the only way in which the movie succeeds.  The opening scene finds us at a pre-teen party in 1985, only the decor and cars make it look more like 1975.  (They did get the kids' clothes about right, at least.)  The party sets the scene for the curse, bestowed by a girl whose advances Charlie spurns.  Cut to the present time, when we see Charlie on the beach with a girlfriend who dumps him because of his fear of commitment.  We soon learn that he has a long history of such issues, and are supposed to believe it's all due to the curse.  The trouble is, any viewer can see Charlie's real problem is that he doesn't really want to settle down with anybody.  It has all the markings of an obvious revelation waiting at the end of the movie, but surprisingly that never really materializes.Similarly, when Charlie finally meets a woman who does interest him, and resolves not to lose her, he sabotages his own good intentions by trying much too hard.  The situations that follow are obviously to be played for laughs, but most of them are very unfunny.  Once again, everyone can see Charlie's real problem except Charlie.  Even the very predictable denouement doesn't really give any indication that he's learned anything.Throughout the movie, we're also treated to all sorts of bizarre pontifications from Charlie's extremely obnoxious best friend.  These at least are occasionally very funny, but there's never the slightest indication of why Charlie is friends with the lout in the first place.  Then there's the issue of hundreds of women being so desperate for love that they're willing to sleep with a complete stranger to get it.  Some might call it sexist, but nothing about this movie deserves to be taken that seriously.",2,"A clever idea, but...",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,2038,"['premise', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'guy', 'cursed', 'never', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'someone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'gold', 'Instead', 'movie', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'opportunity', 'usually', 'succeeds.Which', 'only', 'way', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'pre-teen', 'party', '1985', 'only', 'decor', 'cars', 'make', 'look', 'more', '1975', 'did', 'get', 'kids', 'clothes', 'right', 'least', 'party', 'scene', 'curse', 'bestowed', 'girl', 'advances', 'Charlie', 'spurns', 'Cut', 'present', 'time', 'when', 'see', 'Charlie', 'beach', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'fear', 'commitment', 'soon', 'learn', 'long', 'history', 'such', 'issues', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'due', 'curse', 'trouble', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'Charlie', 'real', 'problem', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'settle', 'down', 'anybody', 'markings', 'obvious', 'revelation', 'waiting', 'end', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'never', 'really', 'materializes.Similarly', 'when', 'Charlie', 'finally', 'woman', 'who', 'interest', 'not', 'lose', 'own', 'good', 'intentions', 'trying', 'much', 'too', 'hard', 'situations', 'follow', 'are', 'obviously', 'be', 'played', 'laughs', 'most', 'are', 'very', 'unfunny', 'Once', 'again', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'Charlie', 'real', 'problem', 'Charlie', 'Even', 'very', 'predictable', 'denouement', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'indication', 'learned', 'movie', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'sorts', 'bizarre', 'pontifications', 'Charlie', 'extremely', 'obnoxious', 'best', 'friend', 'least', 'are', 'occasionally', 'very', 'funny', 'never', 'slightest', 'indication', 'why', 'Charlie', 'friends', 'lout', 'first', 'place', 'Then', 'issue', 'hundreds', 'women', 'being', 'so', 'desperate', 'love', ""'re"", 'willing', 'sleep', 'complete', 'stranger', 'get', 'might', 'call', 'sexist', 'nothing', 'movie', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously']",N/A

His obnoxious breast augmenter best friend Stu (Dan Fogler) sees Chuck's hex as a godsend for open sex, but when Chuck meets Klutz penguin trainer (Jessica Alba) and falls in love, there are problems - the solutions of which are so disgusting and unfunny that hardly need repeating.This is a film, apparently with an audience (!), that is gross and so over the top that it completely wastes the talents of Cook and Alba.

With some creativity in the head, you can always be dirty and instigating without being almost obscene.So when I say this movie is laughable in the good sense, I mean there are some jokes and situations that will really make you give a genuine laugh (that's what comedy movies are made for, right?) and just because of that you should watch it at least for once.

Instead of getting the girl of his dreams, he links up with a girl who hexes him.  Forever after, he beds a woman and the next boyfriend they have turns out to be her husband.  News spreads at a wedding - one of his former girlfriends - and Charlie is immersed in single, attractive women who wish to sexually use him, and then find their future husband.  At this same wedding, Charlie meets penguin worker Cam Wexler (Jessica Alba), and he instantly crushes like a school boy.  She tells him about how male penguins present pebbles to females, and then they mate for life.  Insert foreshadowing.Unfortunately, the majority of the scenes are with Dane Cook.  Anyone who has ever seen Robin Williams' ham it up on stage and in front of the camera for years on end without change should know everything they need to know about Dane Cook, this movie, and every future Dane Cook movie.

657822,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B00005JPWC,Joe Carugati,"[10, 14]","As a comedian, I'm a huge fan of Dane Cook.  I think his jokes are hilarious and relateable in so many ways.  As a goddess, I'm a huge fan of Jessica Alba.  She's beautiful, gorgeous, and has an amazing smile.  As an actor and an actress, Dane Cook and Jessica Alba really don't impress that much.  It's unfortunate, because a movie that could have been enjoyable, funny, and sweet, becomes pedestrian, dumb, and forgettable.Charlie Logan (Dane Cook) has a problem with women.  Once he's slept with them, the next person the women date is going to be their life-long mate.  Women (looking for their soul-mate) force themselves onto Charlie, hoping that they'll meet their true love and after they've had their way with him, they do find the person they will spend the rest of their lives with.  Pushed on by his best friend (Dan Fogler), Charlie decides that he mine as well get some fun out of his unique situation.As much fun as the sex may seem at first, Charlie notices that none of the women have any attracton to him whatsover save for the fact that he brings them grooms.  Inevitably, he begins to fall for Cam (Jessica Alba), a penguin trainer and expert at the local aquarium with a case of Murphy's Law.  The problem is that as much as she wants to sleep with Charlie, he can't let it happen, in fear that she may dump him and find the next guy in her life to be the one.As a comedy, this movie doesn't fail, but it never exceeds either.  Many of the jokes are sexual or slapstick (Alba tripping, hitting poles, breaking things) and after awhile, they became dull (Fogler's antics as a plastic surgeon), unrealistic (Fogler's 3-breasted girlfriend) and somewhat disturbing (a 12-year old girl stripping and coming onto a 12-year old guy is not fun for me).  Some jokes hit, some don't.  I just wish the writers could think of some more subtle humor, instead of making it seem overblown.Another factor for a movie of this type is that the love story needs to be fairly solid.  To be honest, I felt that the chemistry between Cook and Alba was pretty solid, but it was the character choices that really got to me, especially Cook's.  He's supposedly ""in love"" with Cam, yet has sex with other girls when he gets the chance to.  It didn't seem like he cared that much.  As for Alba, her character starts out shy and sweet, but as it goes on, she becomes quite sexual and it kind of turned me off (not that Jessica Alba not getting dirty is bad).  Fortunately, some of their banter between each other was nice and didn't feel so forced.  Overall though, their choices as characters really took me out of their relationship.  When Cook tells his feelings to Alba at the end, I wasn't truly convinced of what he was saying.Nudity doesn't offend me in movies, but this movie had way too much in my opinion.  Towards the middle of the film when Cook realizes his gift with women, the audience gets to observe him get it on with said women.  A quick little montage maybe would have been nice (""Wedding Crashers"", anyone?), but instead it becomes tasteless, dull, and a little repulsive.  It wasn't needed and brought down the sweetness that the film was trying to express at times.Speaking of this ""sweetness"", this movie tries at times to be overly dramatic.  When a plus-size woman wants Charlie in bed, she tells him that he can close his eyes and imagine someone else so he won't have to see her.  Right after she says that, a soft, melodramatic score rises as Cook looks into her eyes and says that he'll only imagine her.  What?!  It turns into a soap opera and after the scene, he tells Fogler that she wasn't great in bed at all.  Wow...moving.Overall, this movie is enjoyable enough to rent or waste two hours, but that's it.

657826,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPWC,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 3]","I must admit I was somewhat torn when it came to wanting to see this movie. I knew what it was about, I knew what it was rated (so I knew what to expect in terms of content), and I thought the previews looked funny enough so that surely all the funny stuff hadn't been shown; no my problem lied not in the content of the film, but in the casting. Now, before you think I'm insane, and that for some reason I'm a guy that doesn't like Jessica Alba, let me clear that up right away, that is not the case. The cast member I was unsure of was Dane Cook, now I know that some people think that he is absolutely hilarious in his stand-up routine. I am not one of these people, I've heard his act and frankly found it to be not all that funny, I kind of think of him as a poor man's version of Ryan Reynolds in the way he delivers a line and his sense of humor, except I think that Ryan is funnier. When it came to Dane's feature film work I had only seen one movie that he was in and that was the superb thriller ""Mr. Brooks"", but as far as his comedies go I hadn't seen any of them, so when it came to ""Good Luck Chuck"" I wasn't sure what the outcome would be, I'll admit I thought Dane was funny in the previews, but that wasn't the reason I decided to watch the movie. I'll be honest it had more to do with Jessica Alba and the fact that she looked good and I thought that it looked as if she did a really good job at being comedic (which is something I really hadn't seen from her) than anything else.""Good Luck Chuck"" is the story of Charlie Logan (Dane Cook), a dentist who appears to be somewhat of a good luck charm for women in their future love life. It seems that once a woman sleeps with Chuck, the next guy they fall for will be their one true love. At first this bothers Chuck who feels like he's taking advantage of these women who knowingly throw themselves at him in order to find true love later in life, but after some questionable counseling from his best friend, Stuart (Dan Folger), Chuck decides to assist these ladies however they see fit. Everything seems perfect for Chuck, he's a guy that can get any girl, for at least one date, with no commitments or attachments (a dream for some guys), but when he meets a beautiful woman named Cam (Jessica Alba) he realizes that he wants more from life than meaningless sex. Now, Chuck will do whatever it takes to try to break his good luck charm (or bad luck from his perspective) to hold onto the girl of his dreams.After viewing ""Good Luck Chuck"" I was pleasantly surprised by how good I found Dane Cook to actually be in this movie. He wasn't annoying or over-the-top, and though he still came off a little like Ryan Reynolds in the delivery of his lines, I felt he showed definite signs that he was beginning to develop his own style of acting that was allowing him to break free of that comparison I had made. Jessica Alba was perfect as the beautiful, hazard-prone, yet sweet girl of his dreams. For an actress who had only really done some light comedy in her two superhero films ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", I was surprised by how natural she seemed at comedy, and her timing was perfect every time. Plus, the sweet nature of her character provided a much needed balance to Dane's sarcastic character of Chuck and to his extremely perverted friend Stuart played by Dan Fogler.The story for ""Good Luck Chuck"" is a bit of mixture, on one hand it is a raunchy, sex-filled comedy aimed at teens and young adults, but on the other it is a typical romantic comedy. This somewhat different dynamic provided the movie with some rather odd moments, when one minute you're most likely laughing at some injury inflicted upon Chuck on accident by Cam or at some off-color remark, the next minute you find yourself taken in by the sweet nature of the connection that Cam and Chuck share, and at Chuck's willingness to do whatever it takes to win her heart. It's a really strange mixture for this type of movie, but one that works to the films advantage and actually elevates the movie above the typical raunchy comedies that have no real story or point to them, other than to show as much skin, and talk about as much sex as possible. There were a couple of moments where this film almost condemned itself to being just another sex comedy that people would soon forget, it was during the time when Chuck had decided to provide what he felt was his ""good deed"" to women everywhere. So, during their montage of `love scenes' in the movie, I thought the director, Mark Helfrich, was maybe pushing the movie too far into the raunchy direction and had probably lost sight of the romantic comedy aspect that he had introduced; but the movie rebounded and the romantic comedy elements returned in force and essentially consumed, and in some ways improved, the latter half of the film.""Good Luck Chuck"" is in my opinion a hilarious, laugh out loud comedy that takes full advantage of its R rating, and I'll admit that some of the typical raunchy comedy stuff was funny to me. Not everyone will enjoy this movie, but if you know what to expect going in then your viewing experience will be better for it. This is definitely not a typical romantic comedy as the early previews had somewhat led audiences to believe, the previews that were then shown prior to its DVD release were a little more accurate in what the film would actually entail, so those of you hoping for a sweet, mostly family friendly experience look somewhere else, because you won't find that here.""Good Luck Chuck"" is available in

657834,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPWC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[29, 38]","""Good Luck Chuck"" is not a romantic comedy, but rather a raunchy comedy that is sort of about romance.  If there was some notion of romance at the heart of this movie, it would have a chance of working, but of the different organs and body parts that are prominent in this 2007 film, the heart would not be one of them.  When we get to the big moment at the end of ""Good Luck Chuck,"" compare it to the same scene in ""The Wedding Singer,"" and you can see how short this one falls of the mark.  In other words, this is really not a date film, because first-time director Mark Helfrich's final product is slanted way towards the male of the species.  You might check this film out for Jessica Alba, but the focus is on Dane Cook and that along should tell you this movie is going to favor comedy over women, and comedy that favors men over women.That is not to say that the premise is not promising.  The titular Chuck is Charlie Logan (Cook), and, no, the film is not bothered by the fact that nobody calls him Chuck.  Because of what happened during an adolescent game of Spin the Bottle, Charlie is cursed: any woman he loves will leave him and immediately find and marry the man of her dreams.  As Charlie comes to realize his peculiar situation there is good news--women are throwing themselves at him in order to leap out of his bed and find the guy for them--and bad news--he meets Cam Wexler (Alba), who is cute, a klutz, and works with penguins, allowing the film to show how far the penguin fever of ""March of the Penguins"", ""Happy Feet,"" et al., has fallen.  More importantly, she looks like Jessica Alba, so we instantly understand why Cam is a keeper from Charlie's perspective, even if his best friend Stu (Dan Fogler), a plastic surgeon whose practice is limited to boob jobs, probably thinks too little of her.  This creates the ultimate paradox for Charlie, because to love this woman is to lose her, which is a pretty interesting Catch-22.I am sure that if I added up the minutes that Charlie really does spend more time with Cam than he does with Stu, but it sure does not feel that way.  But the real problem in this film comes in the sequences that it is proudest of: the sex montage.  There is a whole special feature devoted to it as the ""Sex Matrix.""  My immediate reaction to all of this was to wonder if I had ever seen a motion picture with more naked women in it than this one, and while I am sure I have this is a concerted effort in ""Good Luck Chuck"" to prove otherwise.  But when you are watching a guy have sex with dozens of women, it is hard to lend credence to the idea that he is really in love with the woman he is not having sex with.  To offer a rejoinder to Stu, while it is true that sex without love is still sex, it is still without love, and love is supposed to be at the heart of a romantic comedy, which is why this film is not one.My favorite romantic comedy of recent vintage is probably ""50 First Dates,"" and I gave that one only four stars because the raunchy stuff with Rob Schneider took away from the wonderful stuff happening with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.  But ""Good Luck Chuck"" is following more in the steps of contemporary comedies like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad,"" where the goal is to produce a unrated DVD edition.  So ""50 First Dates"" is now looking more like a classic romantic comedy to me.  If ""50 First Dates"" had been made the way they made ""Good Luck Chuck,"" then the opening montage of past lovers in the former would have been in the middle, in which case they are no longer past lovers and the decks are not cleared for a real romance.  By the time Charlie and Cam get to anything remotely like the romantic part, it is too little too late.  When you get to the last in a long line of women, it is hard not to focus on the long line rather than the last woman.  The screenplay by Josh Stolberg (""Kids in America"") does come up with a decent enough way of resolving the dilemma, but given everything that has come before it, the ending fails to redeem this movie.",2,This is not a romantic comedy because there is not that much romance in it,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,4037,"['Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rather', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'sort', 'romance', 'was', 'notion', 'romance', 'heart', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'chance', 'working', 'different', 'organs', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'prominent', '2007', 'film', 'heart', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'When', 'get', 'big', 'moment', 'end', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'same', 'scene', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'short', 'one', 'mark', 'other', 'words', 'really', 'not', 'date', 'film', 'first-time', 'director', 'Mark', 'Helfrich', 'final', 'product', 'slanted', 'way', 'male', 'species', 'might', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'focus', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'along', 'should', 'tell', 'movie', 'going', 'favor', 'comedy', 'women', 'comedy', 'favors', 'men', 'women.That', 'not', 'say', 'premise', 'not', 'promising', 'titular', 'Chuck', 'Charlie', 'Logan', 'Cook', 'film', 'not', 'bothered', 'fact', 'nobody', 'Chuck', 'what', 'happened', 'adolescent', 'game', 'Spin', 'Bottle', 'Charlie', 'cursed', 'woman', 'will', 'leave', 'immediately', 'find', 'marry', 'man', 'dreams', 'Charlie', 'realize', 'peculiar', 'situation', 'good', 'news', 'women', 'are', 'throwing', 'order', 'leap', 'bed', 'find', 'guy', 'bad', 'news', 'Cam', 'Wexler', 'Alba', 'who', 'cute', 'klutz', 'penguins', 'allowing', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'far', 'penguin', 'fever', 'March', 'Penguins', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'al.', 'fallen', 'More', 'importantly', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'instantly', 'understand', 'why', 'Cam', 'keeper', 'Charlie', 'perspective', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'Stu', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'practice', 'limited', 'boob', 'jobs', 'probably', 'too', 'little', 'ultimate', 'paradox', 'Charlie', 'love', 'woman', 'lose', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Catch-22.I', 'am', 'sure', 'added', 'up', 'minutes', 'Charlie', 'really', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'Cam', 'Stu', 'sure', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'sequences', 'proudest', 'sex', 'montage', 'whole', 'special', 'feature', 'devoted', 'Sex', 'Matrix', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'was', 'wonder', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'motion', 'picture', 'more', 'naked', 'women', 'one', 'am', 'sure', 'have', 'concerted', 'effort', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'prove', 'otherwise', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'guy', 'have', 'sex', 'dozens', 'women', 'hard', 'lend', 'credence', 'idea', 'really', 'love', 'woman', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'offer', 'rejoinder', 'Stu', 'true', 'sex', 'love', 'still', 'sex', 'still', 'love', 'love', 'supposed', 'be', 'heart', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'one.My', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'recent', 'vintage', 'probably', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'gave', 'one', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'raunchy', 'stuff', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'took', 'away', 'wonderful', 'stuff', 'happening', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'following', 'more', 'steps', 'contemporary', 'comedies', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'where', 'goal', 'produce', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'edition', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'now', 'looking', 'more', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'way', 'made', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'then', 'opening', 'montage', 'past', 'lovers', 'former', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'middle', 'case', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'past', 'lovers', 'decks', 'are', 'not', 'cleared', 'real', 'romance', 'time', 'Charlie', 'Cam', 'get', 'anything', 'remotely', 'romantic', 'part', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'When', 'get', 'last', 'long', 'line', 'women', 'hard', 'not', 'focus', 'long', 'line', 'rather', 'last', 'woman', 'screenplay', 'Josh', 'Stolberg', 'Kids', 'America', 'come', 'up', 'decent', 'enough', 'way', 'resolving', 'dilemma', 'given', 'everything', 'come', 'ending', 'fails', 'redeem', 'movie']",N/A

He realizes that this is all due to a curse a girl placed on him as a child.  His fair-weathered friend Stu (Dan Fogler) tells him to just go with it so Chuck ends up sleeping with ever woman in the area who's looking to meet her future Mr. Right (or Ms. Right as was shown with the lesbian officer.)  He eventually meets penguin fanatic Cam Wexler (Jessica Alba) and the two forge a relationship.  Yet because he's convinced of the curse, he smothers Cam to the point where she loses interest.  He goes to the woman who put the curse on him, she lifted it, and then he and Cam... ah you know the rest already.Yeah, the comedy parts of the movie weren't that funny, the story line was weak, and while I'm not opposed to nudity in film, it better be more than simply gratuitous unless it's specifically marketed as a porn, which is what we saw here.

In fact, it's apparently so bad per a backstory hex he received in his childhood years that women who sleep with him end up finding the love of their life shortly thereafter and it's never him. Enter Cam (played by Jessica Alba) who Chuck feels is his dream girl even though she is a total klutz.They date and it gets so good but when it comes time to have sex he fears losing her and moves away which leads to all types of problems. His doctor friend from childhood, Stu, is there to direct him in all the wrong ways while he thinks of nothing but giving women more implants and looking for the next woman to sex up. Obviously, he's something of a comparison/contrast to Chuck, who really wants to find love and isn't just about the sex and yet the belief in the community eventually makes him decide to have sex with lots of women (this is before he gets serious enough with Cam, who takes him for a player). Some reviewers have said this makes Chuck despicable but I disagree. He's lonely at that point, believes he has no chance for love and his good friend is urging him to get some action. And, most of the women presented are attractive to very attractive. You expect me to believe that most heterosexual men in said position would pass? Riiiiight.Now compare Cam's brother, Joe, who may be a pothead but he makes insights about love to help guide an insecure and ""pessimistic about love working"" Cam to seeing that Chuck is the man for her even with his flaws. Incidentally, one of Alba's better performances is in this movie but don't go thinking she's going to be nominated for an Oscar.The comedy and overall lines are better than expected. There's a lot of nudity, too, as well as somewhat graphic sex montages which will offend the prudes. Interestingly enough I held off from seeing this movie because some guy told me the movie was ""so so"" but he liked it for all the breast shots. Generally, I don't rush out to see movies like that because I want a good story. And somewhat surprisingly this tale had a good story. Not great but good, mind you. The humor had me laughing early on during the spin the bottle scene.There's a nice touch at the end which answers was Charlie really hexed or did he just create it in his head.

I don't see it that way. I see it as a tale of a guy who has sex with lots of good looking women (a popular male fantasy), realizes that is not for him and then goes exclusive. Isn't it interesting that his foul mouthed ""just wants sex"" friend, Stu, ends up becoming involved as well at the end of the film? I think the message is pretty clear here.For those into the nudity (and nothing wrong with that if you're a legal adult) there's some good looking topless women in the picture. Well, for the most part. At one point Stu and Chuck decide to test whether any woman can find love so Chuck has sex with an incredibly undesirable woman and it's funny and makes you sort of want to puke.The reflection characters of the lovers give advice (sometimes bad, sometimes good) but they usually have good intentions. I found it interesting that Stu gets criticized for pushing Chuck into have sex with all those women yet he also gave good advice to test the theory on whether Chuck was really cursed and was sending all of his lovers off to future husbands.

657852,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JPWC,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","I had read the reviews and knew that this was supposed to be just godawful. But here is the deal: I really like Jessica Alba. But there are not that many Jessica Alba movies to choose from. And just about nothing in the way of comedies. (So far, all the Jessica Alba that falls in to the ""good"" category for me consists only of DARK ANGEL. But I keep hoping.) So, I figured that this couldn't be that awful.Well, it is that awful. And not a great deal of it is Jessica Alba's fault, except for deciding to be in this. The main fault for the film has to be the writers and producers, for deciding that this was a script worth shooting. The premise for the film is preposterous: a young, single dentist develops a reputation for causing any woman he sleeps with to find her true love in the next man she meets. So literally hundreds of women seek out his bed so that they can later meet Mr. Right. Frankly, I found this so offensive that I don't know what to say. Do the filmmakers think that women are that stupid? Are we really at a point in our cultural history that we can imagine that women would sleep with one guy so that they would then meet the man of their dreams? There are so many wretched messages that can be teased out of the film.Then there is the casting of Dane Cook in the lead role. I have not seen his stage act, but he was so unlikable as the romantic lead that I kept thinking that the movie could only get worse if Jessica Alba ended up with him. Who decided that his starring in this film would be a good idea?Additional blame has to be placed on whoever it was who decided to put so much nudity in the film. At one time (I think this has changed, though I could be wrong) there were some odd tax laws in Canada that resulted in the making of dozens of godawful teen sex comedies for the profits that could be made under that system. As I say, I think those laws have changed, but a couple of scenes into this I realized that this film had been filmmed in Vancouver. If you know which TV shows are made in Vancouver, you will recognize Vancouver actors like Ben Ayres (he played Birch, inept CAG for one episode on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and one of Lex Luthor's henchmen on SMALLVILLE) and the lovely Chelan Simmons (KYLE XY, WONDERFALLS, MEN IN TREES, SMALLVILLE, and EDGEMONT -- at least her nude scene proved that she will never need a body double). So it is interesting that a film this awful was made in a country whose film industry (Atom Egoyan aside) as horrid as its healthcare is to be envied (at least by those of us in the US). So maybe those terrible tax laws are still in place. Certainly, the incredible amount of nudity (and I saw this in the theatrical version -- god only knows what the Unrated edition will be like) reminds one of those old tax break teen sex romps.Special fault needs to be noted for the absolutely horrible Dan Fogler, whose performance as as Dan Cook's obnoxious bestfriend and plastic surgeon takes the film to lows that are lower than the rest of this bottom dwelling film. His performance in this film goes on my personal list of the ten worst performance I've ever seen. Probably it isn't the fault of Fogler, but of whoever wrote this disaster of a film.Finally, what was Jessica Alba thinking? Hopefully she got paid a huge amount of money, but because otherwise there is nothing to excuse her involvement in this. I watched this exclusively because of her involvement in it. And to be honest I didn't mind her when she was onscreen. She is someone that Hollywood hasn't learned out to use. She has two things going for her in huge fashion. First, she is one of the most beautiful women in the world. Second, she is enormously likable. But I've not seen any movies that have exploited how likable she is. I like the fact that she refused to do any nude scenes, but I lament that she has to do embarrassing panty scenes. In both the FANTASTIC FOUR films and in this one she is forced to prance around in her undies. She shouldn't have to do that. She isn't the greatest actress in the world, but neither are most of the successful actresses in the world. I just want to see her in decent films. Or barring that, let her go back to television. To be honest, I prefer TV to movies anyway (and anyone who questions that statement hasn't been paying attention to what has happened in TV over the past fifteen years).

657855,A1DL0EDVWPSPEW,B00005JPWC,"Ryan Matthews ""montvil""","[0, 2]","This film is no more than a 3 1/2 star movie, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt with the casting of Jessica Alba as Cam Wexler.  First and foremost, she played the comedic role much, much better than I expected (her klutzy demeanor was almost believable and somewhat endearing at times).  I was even impressed with Dane Cook, and on the contrary to most who said he took a step back from Employee of the Month, I think he was very good, not overwhelming yet stepped up when the moment called for it.  Dane's character, Charlie Logan, whose occupation is a dentist, is the victim of a ""curse"" that makes him ideal to any girl who is looking for a husband.  Charlie has the opportunity to have sex with dozens and dozens of girls, but with each girl he sleeps with, they find the man of their dreams in the next person they go out with.The plot line takes its twist when Charlie falls for Cam and has to figure out a way to break the hex so he doesn't have to worry about her leaving him for someone else when they sleep together.  Dane and Jessica's chemistry on the set was actually pretty good, and between the two of them, you almost thought the movie had a chance.The aspect of this film that takes away from the ""romantic comedy"" genre depicted by the cast and crew is the character played by Dan Fogler, Stu.  Stu is supposed to be a friend of Charlie's. He is a re-constructive surgeon (breast implants) whose office is across the hall and he and provides the majority of the raunchy humor that could ultimately sour an audience.  His part almost seemed like a last minute write-in at times as a support for Charlie Logan, but Dane Cook could've stood alone without a problem.  Write Stu out of the script and you've got a movie. Unfortunately, his character gets more obnoxious and unnecessary as the film develops, ultimately ruining some of the better moments.In my personal opinion, this is not on Dane Cook or Jessica Alba.  This was a very clever idea and an exceptional job by both actors, but the raunchy humor and the extended sex scenes seem to put this movie in its own category and narrow the audience who would enjoy it.  If you aren't afraid of a little sex and looking for a few good laughs, I'd recommend renting the movie.. It could definitely disappoint, but it certainly could be a pleasant surprise if you keep an open mind.

657860,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005JPWC,S. Rhodes,"[6, 10]","Good Luck Chuck is a simple premise.  Chuck (played by Dane Cook) is a guy who has been cursed.  I say this literally.  The movie begins in 1985 where he is at a party.  He's ten years old and he's playing ""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" with a bunch of friends who are, for the first time, discovering sexuality and all its glory.  They mix it up with Spin the Bottle.  Whoever the bottle lands on is who you spend seven minutes in heaven with.  Chuck's friend, Stu, goes in for seven minutes and of course the girl wants nothing to do with him.Chuck spins the bottle, hoping it'll land on his crush.  Instead it lands on the girl next to his crush who happens to be pretty Gothic and into witchcraft and all that stuff.  They go into the closet together and it turns out she really likes him but he really doesn't like her.  She's pretty quick about stripping her clothes and such because it's the first time she's ""made love"" (and keep in mind... she's ten!).  Chuck doesn't want to do it.  They don't know what they're doing and Chuck ends up having a pretty crap time.  The girl then places a hex on him.  Any girl who has been with Chuck will then find their next true love with the guy they date after him.This is the first folly of the film.  The simple fact that it really was a curse.  We fast forward years later and see Chuck on the beach with a girl.  The moment with said girl doesn't go so well and we discover Chuck may be a little afraid of commitment.He then goes to a wedding where the bride thanks him because were they not together, she wouldn't have found her true love.  It's at this wedding where he meets Cam, the girl he falls in love with (played by Jessica Alba).  At this point he doesn't know or believe there's some curse on him.  Of course what we know is that there is.  Then suddenly after this wedding, every woman in town wants to be with Chuck because of this ""Charm.""  The movie never actually goes into how the women know about this charm, or even why it's only after this wedding that they begin flocking to him.  In other words, this ""Urban Legend"" of Chuck has no origin.  All anyone knows is that it works.  He suddenly starts getting phone calls, more and more people show up at his office (he's a dentist).  I kept scratching my head.  The first few minutes of the movie never touches on this.  No women were curious about him or anything at the wedding.  The movie never explains how they know exactly.  His receptionists finds out online, but the movie never actually digs.  The characters don't even speculate.Then there's Stu (played by Dan Fogler) who apparently is a surgeon who works on giving women the greatest breasts.  Even a joke as simple as this was just either overplayed or downright not funny.  Dan Fogler just serves to be the perverted, piggish, ""All I want is sex,"" dude.  Sure, lots of movies have these characters, but there's usually a humanistic side of them where you discover they're about more than sex and breasts.  Nope.  Not here.  If you're expecting a Seth Rogan like quality here (ala, Knocked Up) then you sure as hell won't get it.  This guy is about nothing but sex all the time and it was just annoying after a while.  He comes off as the most inhumane character in the movie, really.Cam ends up swinging by his office because she chips a tooth because of her stupid brother and her own little ""curse"" which is that her nickname (given to her by her brother) is Murphy.  After Murphy's law which states that anything that can go wrong... will.  The movie shoves this in your face by giving you screw up after screw up after screw up.  Played in rapid succession.  We never get a break from it and much like Dan Fogler's ""I like breats"" jokes, they're just shoved in your face.  Most of them just aren't funny.So of course Chuck is in a bind.  His friend is telling him he should love this curse.  He can have all the sex he wants because girls are just forking to him.  And for a moment he does.  Until he discovers (don't be shocked) that Cam is the one for him.  He says he doesn't believe it but man oh man can it be convincing when you discover all your ex-girlfriends found the love of their lives right after dumping you.  So he decides to test it by finding one of the most unattractive women he can find.  This woman happens to be obese, ugly and unlikeable.  She smells, burps, farts and at dinner she orders an entire turkey.  This is not only offensive, it is, like the rest of the movie, not funny.  Especially because we're supposed to believe that she believes he ""wants to get physical"" despite all his horrid looks.So then he has the brilliant idea of sending his friend off to date her and just like that, he discovers Stu has no interest in marrying her... and of course the big dilemma we find out there is that Stu never went out with her ever.  Chuck, of course discovers this only after having sex with Cam and the rest of the movie is played out in the fashion of him trying to keep her.Good Luck Chuck suffers from many moments not being funny.  In fact, the funniest moments in this film are in the previews and they were actually funnier in the previews.  A lot of it also comes off as immature.  The movie also put more focus on the sex than the actual situation at hand.  The characters and story are also stereotyped.  From the sex-crazed best friend to the obese woman.The gold medal of unfunny jokes here goes to Dane Cook himself who never garners a laugh.  Dane Cook gets no laughs and the best jokes in here are the jokes concerning breasts.  These are jokes that are sure to impress a sophomore in high school but little else beyond that.",1,Good Luck Surviving This Movie,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,5649,"['Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck',

657864,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B00005JPWC,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[3, 3]","Yet again, I wish that Amazon would let reviewers give half stars, as I can't quite put this into the 3 star category, but don't really feel it's that bad either.  2.5 would be about right from my point-of-view.I should make clear that I'm not a fan of Dane Cook.  I find his humor just rambling and well, un-funny.  With that said, he does well in his role for this movie.  Not great, but not bad.Charlie Logan (Dane Cook) is a cursed man and has been since turning down the goth girl who desperately wanted him back in his younger (10 years old) school days.  Anisha (goth girl) put a hex on Charlie so that whoever Charlie was with would find their own true love after being with Charlie, with that true love being the next person they went out with.  Later in life word spreads that Charlie Logan is a lucky charm for women, and the women start almost literally throwing themselves at Charlie so that they could then go and find 'the one'.Early on in the story we see Charlie at a wedding where he is being toasted as the lucky charm that helped the bride find her true love.  At the same wedding a friend of the bride comes to sit at the same table as Charlie and we meet Cam (Jessica Alba).  Will fate let these two be happy ever after, or is Charlie destined to spend the rest of his life making women happy as they get ready for find their true loves?The un-rated version of the movie includes plenty of partial nudity and the requisite language mixed in.  The R rating (for the rated version) is certainly deserved as well.The Blu-ray version of the disc gets mixed reviews from me as well.  It is yet another Blu-ray that doesn't offer the ability to bypass the previews (or at least definitely doesn't make it obvious how to do that).  I am no fan of being forced to sit through previews every time I start watching a disc based movie (especially if it's a movie I've seen multiple times, which would, uh, be the kind of movies I would purchase and own).  Sadly this 'feature' (inability to bypass the previews) seems quite prevalent among Blu-ray titles.  It seems completely disrespectful towards the viewer and just frustrates me.  I guess the disc producers are just trying to offer me time to go microwave some popcorn to munch on when I do get to see the movie.  To be fair, you can skip most of the previews on the disc here just by continually pressing the Next chapter button (fast forward to next chapter).  Again though, not immediately obvious and pressing the Top Menu button results in a 'That operation is not supported here' message.On the plus side this disc includes the ability to bring up the Blu-line slider.  An interesting book marking feature that shows your current place in the film and allows for setting book marks easily via tips as to which buttons to press on the remote control.  It's a neat feature that makes good use of the Blu-ray Disc remote control for the PS3 (as an example).  Press up or down on the disc on the remote to pop-up the Blu-line slider and check it out.There are some interesting featurettes and additional content on the disc as well.  Just be aware that those should carry the same rating as the film itself, up to and including being unrated.",3,"Entertaining, but certainly not a classic...",1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,3210,"['Yet', 'again', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'would', 'let', 'reviewers', 'give', 'half', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', '3', 'star', 'category', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'bad', '2.5', 'would', 'be', 'about', 'right', 'point-of-view.I', 'should', 'make', 'clear', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'find', 'humor', 'just', 'rambling', 'well', 'un-funny', 'said', 'well', 'role', 'movie', 'Not', 'great', 'not', 'bad.Charlie', 'Logan', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'cursed', 'man', 'been', 'turning', 'down', 'goth', 'girl', 'who', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'back', 'younger', '10', 'years', 'old', 'school', 'days', 'Anisha', 'goth', 'girl', 'put', 'hex', 'Charlie', 'whoever', 'Charlie', 'was', 'would', 'find', 'own', 'true', 'love', 'being', 'Charlie', 'true', 'love', 'being', 'next', 'person', 'went', 'out', 'Later', 'life', 'word', 'Charlie', 'Logan', 'lucky', 'charm', 'women', 'women', 'start', 'almost', 'literally', 'throwing', 'Charlie', 'could', 'then', 'go', 'find', ""'the"", ""one'.Early"", 'story', 'see', 'Charlie', 'wedding', 'where', 'being', 'toasted', 'lucky', 'charm', 'helped', 'bride', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'same', 'wedding', 'friend', 'bride', 'sit', 'same', 'table', 'Charlie', 'meet', 'Cam', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Will', 'fate', 'let', 'two', 'be', 'happy', 'ever', 'Charlie', 'destined', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'making', 'women', 'happy', 'get', 'ready', 'find', 'true', 'loves', 'un-rated', 'version', 'movie', 'plenty', 'partial', 'nudity', 'requisite', 'language', 'mixed', 'R', 'rating', 'rated', 'version', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'well.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'disc', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'well', 'yet', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'offer', 'ability', 'bypass', 'previews', 'least', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'make', 'obvious', 'how', 'do', 'am', 'fan', 'being', 'forced', 'sit', 'previews', 'time', 'start', 'watching', 'disc', 'based', 'movie', 'especially', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', 'would', 'uh', 'be', 'kind', 'movies', 'would', 'purchase', 'own', 'Sadly', ""'feature"", 'inability', 'bypass', 'previews', 'quite', 'prevalent', 'Blu-ray', 'titles', 'completely', 'disrespectful', 'viewer', 'just', 'frustrates', 'guess', 'disc', 'producers', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'offer', 'time', 'go', 'microwave', 'popcorn', 'munch', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'movie', 'be', 'fair', 'can', 'skip', 'most', 'previews', 'disc', 'here', 'just', 'continually', 'pressing', 'Next', 'chapter', 'button', 'fast', 'forward', 'next', 'chapter', 'Again', 'not', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'pressing', 'Top', 'Menu', 'button', 'results', 'operation', 'not', 'supported', 'here', 'message.On', 'plus', 'side', 'disc', 'ability', 'bring', 'up', 'Blu-line', 'slider', 'interesting', 'book', 'marking', 'feature', 'current', 'place', 'film', 'allows', 'setting', 'book', 'marks', 'easily', 'tips', 'buttons', 'press', 'remote', 'control', 'neat', 'feature', 'good', 'use', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', 'remote', 'control', 'PS3', 'example', 'Press', 'down', 'disc', 'remote', 'pop-up', 'Blu-line', 'slider', 'check', 'are', 'interesting', 'featurettes', 'additional', 'content', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'should', 'carry', 'same', 'rating', 'film', 'up', 'including', 'being', 'unrated']",N/A

He met (Jessica Alba) in a wedding he went to, and soon after meeting her, He Fell In Love With Her, but because of the spell, he was scared to have sex with her (Jessica Alba).

657871,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPWC,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","""Good Luck Chuck"" is a one-joke movie and that joke is not that funny. Because of the spell cast on him while he was a ten-year-old boy, Charlie Logan is eternally prevented from finding true love. He discovers that all the women he slept with will get married happily after dumping him. This is a kind of joke (or perhaps a real-life episode) you may hear at some party. You may find it pretty amusing, but you soon forget it.Somehow the filmmakers tried to develop the idea into a feature-length film in the wrong way. Many women in town, knowing the existence of ""Good Luck Chuck,"" swarm around him just to get what they want. And Charlie accepts it. Cue to lots of nudities and unfunny jokes. Dane Cook as Charlie tries to make his character likable. He has no chance, however, especially when he is seen with his loud and noisy friend Stu (Dan Fogler), who is one of the most obnoxious characters I have ever seen.But Good Luck Chuck finds his own Miss Right anyway, in a cute klutz Cam Wexler played by Jessica Alba. Despite her Razzie Award nomination, her turn as accident-prone penguin handler (walking into a lamppost) is not bad. Unfortunately her role is comparatively small and the film spends considerable time showing the misadventures of Chuck assisted by annoying Stu.You may think this is romantic comedy in the vein of ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""American Pie."" ""Good Luck Chuck"" is not, lacking the comedic skill of the actors like Ben Stiller and Jason Biggs.
