It didn't seem like it then but when you think about it, 90210 was really the first show that talked frankly about teens dealing with sex, drugs, and family issues. The second season, we finally saw characters like Andrea and Kelly come into their own. Great cast all around well Tori Spelling is another story! 90210 was the first show that opened my eyes that even rich, beautiful people can be just as messed up as a middle or lower class individual. I highly recommend this groundbreaking and smart show. Enjoy!",5,The best show of the '90s.,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,566,"['Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'was', 'league', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'then', 'when', 'think', '90210', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'show', 'talked', 'frankly', 'teens', 'dealing', 'sex', 'drugs', 'family', 'issues', 'second', 'season', 'finally', 'saw', 'characters', 'Andrea', 'Kelly', 'come', 'own', 'Great', 'cast', 'around', 'well', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'story', '90210', 'was', 'first', 'show', 'opened', 'eyes', 'even', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'middle', 'lower', 'class', 'individual', 'highly', 'recommend', 'groundbreaking', 'smart', 'show', 'Enjoy']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 2"
1046337,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000MGBSHQ,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","The genius of the show, especially in Season Two of Beverly Hills 90210, is how well the cast got together when looking back to the first season where everybody was disjoint from each other. I could feel it ultimately during the episode ""Walsh Family Christmas"" which will remain one of the very best of the series. It was the biggest turning point for the cast because when the cast achieved togetherness through unity, the momentum of the show finally took off and made each episode after another to be highly addicting. It's like how everything is flowing from one episode to next in a one streamed continuity. The characters are excellent as ever, and the performances by the cast are tremendous. My favorites will always be Jim and Cindy Walsh, and they are absolutely fantastic characters and make great role models and an example of how parents should be. I thought Tori Spelling's character finally came to life in Season Two and showed more depth in her character as opposed to the her seemingly uselessness in the prior season. Kudos for the makers in fixing that problem. Of course, they solved the problem of Scott because he has to be considered one of the worst actors in TV history. The way he speaks his lines while his facial features draw near to apoplexy state is hard to watch for me. To effectively end his character was a smart move for the show. Meanwhile, I had to debate the question of who is the worse character: Brandon or Brenda. It's now settled as Brenda takes the honors because she is annoying as ever. Her sense of maturity and her chain of reasoning in how she approaches her situations while creating conflicts out of nothing are breathtakingly bad. And these qualities make her a very unlikable character as it becomes more and more apparent by every drama that she needlessly causes. And then it gets worse when she ""rationalizes"" her way out of it through her anger with her parents via family discussions. As for Brandon, although he is still hypocrite as ever, he has become a more and more tolerable character as the season rolls on. To prove his hypocrisy, remember the episode ""Play It Again, David"" where Brandon played a little brother to Felix and then had him taken away from his mother and placed in a foster home. He said to Felix that he promises to see him more often in future. So...what happened? It looks like that Brandon has totally forgotten him. To further strengthen his hypocrisy, remember in the summer, Brandon deserted Nat because he wanted to take a job at the Beverly Hills Beach Club because it pays more than his job at the Peach Pit. However, later in the season, Brandon got really upset at Nat for selling out to the developers of a new mall because they bought him out with a lucrative offer. What the heck? It's the same thing. Also, if you notice, when the Asian girl took the job over for Brandon, I thought it was very odd because this Asian girl was willing to take a job for a lower pay while Brandon, who is white, takes a job that pays more. So, not trying to feel racism coming from the show here, I can't help to feel how ultra white the show has become. Every time a person of a different race appears on the show, there is always an issue that s/he brings with him. When none of them turns up in any of the episodes, Beverly Hills 90210 goes back to all-white normalcy. I am not saying the show is racist, but it just feels like a pattern. The funny part after Brandon saw his Mustang wrecked for the second time (or was it third time?) at the underground dance party, the car is immediately fixed the next day or so as I can see it sitting on the driveway. Mind explaining to me how did that happen? I must say, I love how Vanilla Ice Brandon's hair has grown to be during Season Two. Now, all Brandon just needs is a couple of razor cuts to the sides and on his eyebrows to complete the look. It's so hilarious, especially when looking at his picture in the back of the DVD cover (so funnnny). Ditto for Dylan at times, and David Silver is certainly getting there quite nicely. Towards to the end of Season Two, I thought the last two episodes were very exciting and set the tone for what's to come in the next season. However, there is a certain deja vu about the final episode because the setup of it is just too similar to ""Walsh Family Christmas."" I thought it was nice to see Surfer Betty to come back from the dead and serve a memory from Season One by appearing in one episode, and it would be even nice if the makers could do that a little bit more often with older characters (and they did that with the in-closet homosexual character of David Lascher whom I remember very well for his appearances in Blossom). I loved that episode where the band of Color Me Badd made a cameo. That was cool, and what the heck happened to them after that era? One of the best parts about Beverly Hills 90210 is the issues that are covered in many of the episodes, and they are wide in range. That made the show very watchable and interesting at the same time. I enjoy also the drama of them. Really, it is so interesting to watch how Jim and Cindy would handle the situations with their children and how they would react. That has to be one of the best parts ever. All in all, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Two brought back good memories for me, and it's the reason why everything today on television remains much, much far inferior to what was being shown during the 90's. I am highly looking forward to watching Season Three. By the way, I did like the special features, but I must say that watching Carol Potter, during an interview, to fantasize herself with Luke Perry in a reverie-like moment was really...creepy. I honestly never thought about that, but I am starting to see it a bit more now.",5,Highly Addicting And Fun To Watch,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,5777,"['genius', 'show', 'especially', 'Season',

Overall this is a good season, although not as good as season 1 or season 3.  The show tried to remain true to its roots by tackling tough issues, and although this act is pulled off well, it leaves the viewer feeling like every typical high school clich&eacute; is touched upon.The biggest disappointments for me in this season were in the following areas:- At times the transfer to DVD appears incredibly grainy and in poor quality.- On the DVD cases for discs 6 and 7, the episode overviews are not consistent with the actual plots for each episode.  I have written them correctly in the list below.- The soundtrack: This issue makes the show a lot worse off.  Music by Seal, R.E.M., Monie Love, Garth Brooks, Chris Isaak, Roxette, Robert Palmer, Janis Joplin, The Bangles, Color Me Badd, The Pretenders, and many other artists has all been replaced by forgetfully bland generic studio tracks.  I realize that it's not always possible for all of the original music rights to be obtained for a series, but the omission of every noteworthy song affects the overall quality and experience of the show.  The two episodes where this is most evident is in 'Chuckie's Back', when Steve pulls away from the gang on a bus, the song '2000 Miles' from The Pretenders is played, resulting in a heart-tugging ending.  The episode of 'The Next Fifty Years' starts out with 'Friends In Low Places' by Garth Brooks and hypes up to 'Work It Out' by Monie Love as the gang teaches Scott how to dance.  Those songs all appeared on the original series but were replaced on the DVD version with no-name songs that will surely leave hardcore fans frustrated.To anyone who thinks that music isn't such a big deal, think of Tarantino movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill - without their incredible soundtracks they wouldn't have been nearly as good or memorable.  Had the original music for the show remained intact, I'd rate this season a solid 4.5 stars.  Instead, I give it a 3.5 out of 5.The episodes are as follows:DISC 1:1) Beach Blanket Brandon: Brenda has a pregnancy scare which causes her to re-think her serious relationship with Dylan.  Brandon leaves the Peach Pit and gets a job at the Beverly Hills Beach Club.2) The Party Fish: Brandon's job at the Beach Club leads him to becoming friends with a sports promoter, who wants to make Brandon his gopher boy.  Brandon cuts off the relationship when the friendship becomes to complicated.3) Summer Storm: Dylan is injured while surfing and the Walshes invite him to stay at their home while he recovers from the accident. Jim catches Brenda and Dylan making out and wants him to leave.  Kelly falls for a new guy, but is confused by his mixed signals.4) Anaconda: Dylan and Brandon argue after a late night poker game at the Beach Club ends with a break-in.  Dylan is the prime suspect, as it turns out he's been pawning family items to keep afloat.DISC 2:5) Play It Again, David: Kelly has a hissy fit when her mother starts dating David's dad.  Brandon begins mentoring a boy and learns that there may be more to him than meets the eye.6) Pass, Not Pass: Andrea and Brenda both have a crush on their drama teacher.

It's so good and I can't wait for it to come out.In the first episode called Beach Blanket Brandon, he gets a job for the summer at a posh beach club and Brenda and Dylan face breaking up because she had a pregnancy scare and her parents find out and are mad.  For some reason, my favourite episode is Meeting Mr Pony where Brenda is in the Peach Pit right after closing time and someone breaks in.  He had a shot gun and held it to her.  Moving on isn't easy.  I also really liked Pass Not Pass when Brenda and Andrea both fall for their drama teacher and The Next Fifty Years which is the episode where Scott accidentally shoots himself.  It's a very moving episode.  Also look closely in the episode Ashes To Ashes for an extremely young Vivica A Fox.Once again, this season hooks you in and I enjoyed this as much as the first season.

1046350,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000MGBSHQ,Melissa Niksic,"[1, 2]","The second season of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" is even better than the first. This season deals with a variety of issues, including child abuse, post traumatic stress disorder, steroid use among student athletes, sexual orientation, and more. It also features some of my favorite Brenda Walsh episodes. The season kicks off with Brenda announcing that she may be carrying Dylan's child. There's also major Brenda/Dylan drama, as they break up and make up more times than I can count. Another great episode is the one where Brenda is alone at the Peach Pit during a robbery, and then of course there's the two-part season finale, which entails Brenda defying her parents to go to Mexico for the weekend with Dylan, and Jim Walsh ultimately forbidding the couple to see each other anymore.In addition to all that, there's plenty of good stories involving the supporting cast as well. Steve embarks on a quest to find his biological mother, Kelly and David deal with their parents' budding romance, and Donna learns that her mother is having an affair. Oh yeah, and Brandon is just as much of a do-gooder as ever (he's TOO good, but you've got to love him!).One sour note, much of the music from the original series has been replaced with crappier tunes for the DVD.

I mean some shows aren't that great but it music are huge and one of it interest depends on this,so if you change them with uninteresting ones there's nothing left to like about the show exept maybe the actors and still sometimes it's not enough.I bough the first box set and won't buy the rest cause the changing of original songs is bad and a couple of ""new scenes"" are just plain and dumb.Just watch the reruns or download it.If editors can steal us,why can't we?...",2,Don't like the show that much and if the music was replaced I'll like it less and won't buy it.,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,745,"[""'m"", 'so', 'sick', 'tired', 'studios', 'editing', 'old', 'shows', 'others', 'recent', 'DVD', 'change', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'seriously', 'what', 'use', 'exept', 'getting', 'couple', 'fans', 'nerves', 'know', 'expensive', 'did', ""n't"", 'earn', 'enough', 'money', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'mean', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'music', 'are', 'huge', 'one', 'interest', 'so', 'change', 'uninteresting', 'ones', 'nothing', 'left', 'like', 'show', 'maybe', 'actors', 'still', 'not', 'enough.I', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'rest', 'cause', 'changing', 'original', 'songs', 'bad', 'couple', 'new', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb.Just', 'watch', 'reruns', 'download', 'it.If', 'editors', 'can', 'steal', 'why', 'ca', ""n't""]","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 2"
