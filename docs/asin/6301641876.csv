The DVD did not play in my DVD player; but it played perfectly on my computer.THE MOVIE: I'm delighted Warner Archive has released this effective ""Made For TV"" Movie thriller from 1974. When it first aired, the movie scared me so much my mother made me turn the TV off!! While the movie doesn't shock or scare me now,  the performances  and  brisk  pacing (the running time is 74 minutes  hold up extremely well.Ann (Barbara Eden) is pregnant-- but how can that be? Her husband David (George Grizzard) had a vasectomy three years ago. Tension mounts as David and her best friends (Joyce Van Patten and David Doyle) assume Ann had an affair. Ann reluctantly agrees, twice, to have an abortion. But each time she starts for the hospital, she grows mysteriously sick. And she grows miraculously well again-- just as quickly as she became sick. Ann is now determined to keep her baby--at all costs. And then, Ann starts acting EXTREMELY WEIRD!!! She keeps her house at freezing cold temperatures, drinks pots of scalding hot coffee, pours tons of salt on all her foods, reads lengthy books in a matter of seconds, etc. On top of all this, she starts speaking in a freaky language; and her excellent housekeeping skills go completely to pot!!The explanation for all this is ridiculous, but the movie still manages to grip and hold your attention. George Grizzard is very good as the increasingly worried husband. Barbara Eden is excellent, especially as Ann's behavior grows increasingly bizarre and violent.",4,"FREAKY PREGNANCY: ""THE STRANGER WITHIN""",1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,1580,"['NOTE', 'THE', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'Case', 'Disc', 'may', 'not', 'play', 'DVD', 'devices', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'DVD', 'player', 'played', 'perfectly', 'computer.THE', 'MOVIE', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'released', 'effective', 'Made', 'TV', 'Movie', 'thriller', '1974', 'When', 'first', 'aired', 'movie', 'scared', 'so', 'much', 'mother', 'made', 'turn', 'TV', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shock', 'scare', 'now', 'performances', 'brisk', 'pacing', 'running', 'time', '74', 'minutes', 'hold', 'up', 'extremely', 'well.Ann', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'pregnant', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'husband', 'David', 'George', 'Grizzard', 'had', 'vasectomy', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'Tension', 'mounts', 'David', 'best', 'friends', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'David', 'Doyle', 'assume', 'Ann', 'had', 'affair', 'Ann', 'reluctantly', 'twice', 'have', 'abortion', 'time', 'hospital', 'mysteriously', 'sick', 'miraculously', 'well', 'again', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', 'became', 'sick', 'Ann', 'now', 'determined', 'keep', 'baby', 'costs', 'then', 'Ann', 'acting', 'EXTREMELY', 'WEIRD', 'house', 'freezing', 'cold', 'temperatures', 'drinks', 'pots', 'scalding', 'hot', 'coffee', 'pours', 'tons', 'salt', 'foods', 'lengthy', 'books', 'matter', 'seconds', 'etc', 'top', 'speaking', 'freaky', 'language', 'excellent', 'housekeeping', 'skills', 'go', 'completely', 'pot', 'explanation', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'still', 'grip', 'hold', 'attention', 'George', 'Grizzard', 'very', 'good', 'increasingly', 'worried', 'husband', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Ann', 'behavior', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'violent']",N/A

A woman(Barbara) becomes pregnant and her husband had a vacectomy years ago. So who's the father? That's the big question throughout the movie. During her pregnancy her behavior and personality begins to change, she eats large amounts of salt on her food, she has unexplained outbursts, she drinks scalding hot strong coffee continually, eats raw meat, reads tons of books by scanning them with her finger, her blood type changes, she has mysterious scratches on her face that quickly disappear, she wants to sleep in a freezing cold room with a window wide open, and she talks in a strange tongue. She acts so bizarre her husband doesn't know what has gotten into her.(no pun intended).When the question of abortion comes(husband really doesn't want children) the growing infant keeps that from happening by making Barabara's blood pressure drop & a fever spike that prevents the abortion surgery from going through.SPOILER:Towards the end, after being hypnotized by a friend she tells the story of how she was abducted into a spacecraft by aliens who impregnated her one day when she was out drawing landscapes in the mountains. At the very end, about two dozen women(Barbara included) now with their half alien  infants(they look like normal babies), walk toward a light talking them back into the spacecraft forever. That's the final bizarre scene.It seems Barbara was not the only victim of alien abduction.In the 1970's there was alot of talk of alien abductions and this is where this idea for this made for TV movie came from.

As a child I riveted to the screen as Ann Collins (played by Barbara Eden) mysteriously finds herself pregnant even though her husband  was incapable of impregnating her due to a vasectomy.  Was Ann cheating?  She denied it and has no explanation, but even her friends don't believe her when she says she hadn't had an affair.  The rest of the film involves Ann going from a reasonable housewife and artist to a raving lunatic.  The fetus grows at an alarming rate.  Though Matheson was well know for his TV tales of suspense and horror, this script leaves the viewer scratching their heads.  Is this a science fiction or a horror story?  In the pre Close Encounters and ET days, aliens typically were portrayed as not having human beings best interest in mind and come as either conquerors or misunderstood entities that do harm in spite of their best intentions.  It certainly is alarming how the developing baby seems to take control of it's mother, but the audience is kept in the dark for the most part as to what is going on or what the visitors purpose for doing what they've done is.  The film has poor production values and even Eden's decent acting can't compensate for the poorly constructed script.  Special effects are almost non-existent and the ending is somewhat reminiscent of a scene from Stepford Wives and also defies logic.This movies is okay for nostalgia, but has little to offer a modern viewer.  If you look at it as a 70s time capsule dealing with themes of UFOs, paranoia, and a show case of 70s cars and fashions it could be a worth a watch--otherwise a better choice would be Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, which still holds up well in spite of it's low budget and time frame.",3,Not the Best Richard Matheson Story--Warning Spoiler Alert!,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,1800,"['saw', 'movie', 'originally', '1974', 'one', 'popular', '34', 'movie', 'week', '34', 'offering', 'child', 'riveted', 'screen', 'Ann', 'Collins', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'mysteriously', 'pregnant', 'even', 'husband', 'was', 'incapable', 'impregnating', 'due', 'vasectomy', 'Was', 'Ann', 'cheating', 'denied', 'explanation', 'even', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'affair', 'rest', 'film', 'Ann', 'going', 'reasonable', 'housewife', 'artist', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'fetus', 'alarming', 'rate', 'Matheson', 'was', 'well', 'know', 'TV', 'tales', 'suspense', 'horror', 'script', 'viewer', 'scratching', 'heads', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'story', 'pre', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'ET', 'days', 'aliens', 'typically', 'were', 'portrayed', 'not', 'having', 'human', 'beings', 'best', 'interest', 'mind', 'come', 'conquerors', 'misunderstood', 'entities', 'do', 'harm', 'spite', 'best', 'intentions', 'certainly', 'alarming', 'how', 'developing', 'baby', 'take', 'control', 'mother', 'audience', 'kept', 'dark', 'most', 'part', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'visitors', 'purpose', 'doing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'film', 'poor', 'production', 'values', 'even', 'Eden', 'decent', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compensate', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'script', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'scene', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'also', 'logic.This', 'movies', 'okay', 'nostalgia', 'little', 'offer', 'modern', 'viewer', 'look', '70s', 'time', 'capsule', 'dealing', 'themes', 'UFOs', 'paranoia', 'show', 'case', '70s', 'cars', 'fashions', 'could', 'be', 'worth', 'watch', 'otherwise', 'better', 'choice', 'would', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'spite', 'low', 'budget', 'time', 'frame']",N/A

The story and plot may be a little derivative but the real treat is to see Barbara Eden as a women with an unsuspected (alien)pregnancy go through emotional tantrums and weird eating binges as the pregnancy takes over her personality and body chemistry (i.e. her blood-type changes and has an appetite for salt). Writer Richard Matheson's (SOMEWHERE IN TIME, TRILOGY OF TERROR), story has the right amount of suspense and terror to sustain a 90-minute tv film although sometimes it becomes a little repetative especially when Barbara Eden's character is in and out of the hospital during the duration of the film.  However, some of the subject matter is probably daring for it's day (early 1970's) with such mentions of vasectomys and alien abductions. Overall, a decent sci-fi horror film made for the small screen that has its moments of suspense and horror. Also its worth a look to see Barbara Eden in a dramatic role and doing some off the wall things (which are tame for 1970's tv standards).
