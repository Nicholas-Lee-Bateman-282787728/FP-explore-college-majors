It is not one of his most famous ones probably because it is not the genre of what most fans think of when they think of John Wayne, comedy. It is a good movie though. When I first watched it I was amazed. Everyone (from Wayne to the actress that plays his daughter) does an excellent job. John Wayne's first role was in a silent in which he played a football player, and he also played football at USC for a couple of years with Ward Bond. So it is a subject he knows well. Overall, it gives light to a new side of the Duke, the comical side (which isn't bad). It isn't one of the best, I grant you, but it is great because it shows Duke's acting talents with a great script and cast.",4,Good and Underrated,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,757,"['movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'cowboy', 'football', 'coach', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'ones', 'probably', 'not', 'genre', 'what', 'most', 'fans', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'John', 'Wayne', 'comedy', 'good', 'movie', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'was', 'amazed', 'Everyone', 'Wayne', 'actress', 'daughter', 'excellent', 'job', 'John', 'Wayne', 'first', 'role', 'was', 'silent', 'played', 'football', 'player', 'also', 'played', 'football', 'USC', 'couple', 'years', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'subject', 'well', 'Overall', 'light', 'new', 'side', 'Duke', 'comical', 'side', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'one', 'best', 'grant', 'great', 'Duke', 'acting', 'talents', 'great', 'script', 'cast']",N/A

308322,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,6302344905,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[1, 1]","It seems impossible that this film was by the director of Casablanca. There's nothing noir in it at all. Leonard Maltin, in his Classic Movie Guide, said it's ""unusually sentimental"" for a Wayne vehicle. That's not the word I'd use, but if he means it deviates somewhat from Rooster Cogburn, that it does. The title subtly suggests Bing Crosby's Going My Way (Going My Way (Universal Cinema Classics)), but it reminds me of another little seen gem, this one deviating a bit for Frank Sinatra-- A Hole in the Head (The Frank Sinatra Star Collection (Guys and Dolls / Hole In The Head / Manchurian Candidate / Sergeant's 3)). The tough guy in a sports setting also brings to mind another classic, Angels in the Outfield (Angels in the Outfield). All three are the sort of movies I love to discover, and this one has the added advantage of co-starring Donna Reed.Wayne is still the Quiet Man here, and his cool nonchalance gives the film a sense of style that high-pitched dramatics would not. In fact, there's a scene where his drama queen ex-wife pulls some over the top hysterics, and the cool rejoinder is ""stop overacting"". Wayne is equally at home on the football field and in the pool room-- equal parts Gipper and cool hand Luke. The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Charles Coburn as the quiet inferno, Father Burke, which reminds me of another wily priest in another little-seen '50s film, St. Benny the Dip (St. Benny the Dip), which only exists in poorly preserved budget editions unless Turner Classic Movies screens their pristine copy. This film in the John Wayne Collection (The John Wayne Film Collection (Without Reservations / Allegheny Uprising / Tycoon / Reunion in France / Big Jim McLain / Trouble Along the Way)) is also available in a slip case with five other films, usually for little more than the single price, but either way, fans of light, classic '50s comedy will call it a bargain.",4,Taste for Trouble,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1919,"['impossible', 'film', 'was', 'director', 'Casablanca', 'nothing', 'noir', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'Classic', 'Movie', 'Guide', 'said', 'unusually', 'sentimental', 'Wayne', 'vehicle', 'not', 'word', ""'d"", 'use', 'somewhat', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'title', 'subtly', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Going', 'Way', 'Going', 'My', 'Way', 'Universal', 'Cinema', 'Classics', 'little', 'seen', 'gem', 'one', 'deviating', 'bit', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Hole', 'Head', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Star', 'Collection', 'Guys', 'Dolls', '/', 'Hole', 'Head', '/', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', '/', 'Sergeant', '3', 'tough', 'guy', 'sports', 'setting', 'also', 'mind', 'classic', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'three', 'are', 'sort', 'movies', 'love', 'discover', 'one', 'added', 'advantage', 'co-starring', 'Donna', 'Reed.Wayne', 'still', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'here', 'cool', 'nonchalance', 'film', 'sense', 'style', 'high-pitched', 'dramatics', 'would', 'not', 'fact', 'scene', 'where', 'drama', 'queen', 'ex-wife', 'pulls', 'top', 'hysterics', 'cool', 'rejoinder', 'stop', 'overacting', 'Wayne', 'equally', 'home', 'football', 'field', 'pool', 'room', 'equal', 'parts', 'Gipper', 'cool', 'hand', 'Luke', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'quiet', 'inferno', 'Father', 'Burke', 'wily', 'priest', 'little-seen', ""'50s"", 'film', 'St.', 'Benny', 'Dip', 'St.', 'Benny', 'Dip', 'only', 'poorly', 'preserved', 'budget', 'editions', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'pristine', 'copy', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Collection', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Film', 'Collection', 'Reservations', '/', 'Allegheny', 'Uprising', '/', 'Tycoon', '/', 'Reunion', 'France', '/', 'Big', 'Jim', 'McLain', '/', 'Trouble', 'Way', 'also', 'available', 'slip', 'case', 'five', 'other', 'films', 'usually', 'little', 'more', 'single', 'price', 'way', 'fans', 'light', 'classic', 'comedy', 'will', 'call', 'bargain']",N/A
308323,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302344905,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","A warmhearted comedy-drama starring John Wayne? He's had a few of these, including one of my favorite John Wayne films ever, THE QUIET MAN. The Duke didn't just do westerns and cop and war flicks. He's a better actor and had more dimensions than people assume. He's so effective and natural in pictures like TROUBLE ALONG THE WAY that I wish he'd done more of it.John Wayne plays Steve Williams, a disgraced former football coach currently making do by hustling for pool hall money and being an oddsmaker. A single parent, Steve is raising his perceptive eleven-year-old daughter Carol, and even though they're struggling, life is still good for these two. But then the icy Ms. Alice Singleton (Donna Reed), a Children's Court officer, knocks on his door. To get back at him, Steve's spiteful ex-wife is fighting for custody of Carol. Steve comments on how nice Ms. Singleton's legs are, and this doesn't help his cause.To sway Ms. Singleton to his side by demonstrating more stability in his life, Steve accepts an offer to coach football for tiny St. Anthony College, a Catholic university in New York. St. Anthony's is deep in hock for over $170,000 (at which the college's rector, Father Burke, ruefully remarks: ""When I take a vow of poverty I go all the way.""). The college is doomed to get shut down in six months, and the desperate hope is that the football program will garner ample gate revenue to cover the debt. An incredulous Steve exclaims: ""Why, with the material you have at St. Anthony's, you couldn't whip Vassar at tiddlywinks."" But the faculty gives him carte blanche in how he goes about establishing his program, and the college shouldn't have done this. Steve is an effective coach but he'd been fired from his several major college coaching gigs for his... er, let's call it ""nonconformity"" instead of ""questionable methods."" What do you expect from a guy whose motto is ""Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing.""? There are grave repercussions to what Steve does for St. Anthony's College.TROUBLE ALONG THE WAY is one of John Wayne's frequently overlooked pictures, and it's maybe because there aren't horses or combat zones or cops and robbers in this one. But you'll be missing out if you miss out on this one. John Wayne demonstrates his range as an actor; I think he's superb as the cynical coach and loving father, infusing Steve Williams with a layered complexity. Steve gets up to his shady old tricks, but Wayne keeps him an appealing character. It doesn't hurt that Michael Curtiz is directing or that his supporting cast is so good.Donna Reed's role is a far cry from what she did on her television show or from the obliging wife in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Alice Singleton, prim and distant and feisty, coolly marches up to John Wayne, and it's an inevitable clash of wills. Charles Coburn, one of the fantastic character actors of his time, is wonderful as the benevolent Father Burke. For fans of THE RIFLEMAN television series, Chuck Connors has a bit part.The best moments of this movie, no question about it, belong to whenever John Wayne and the young and very good Sherry Jackson (who plays his daughter) share a scene. These two actors have great chemistry together. The dialogue between them isn't sappy and is often funny, and it's because Ms. Jackson gets plenty of chances to fire back with some put-down one-liner. John Wayne always did play the straight man part well. So the heart of this film revolves around their father-daughter relationship, and I do like that the screenwriter doesn't ultimately make it out to be this perfect thing. One character eventually thoughtfully raises an issue: Carol as a tomboy may now look up to her father, but what happens as she grows older and still without the benefits of a mother's presence? This hits Steve right between the eyes.This is a warm and sentimental family drama, with some sports stuff thrown in and just a whiff of GOING MY WAY. It does have its share of surprises. For one thing, it's refreshing that the story doesn't get wrapped in a neat little bow.

308344,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,6302344905,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","Although many of John Wayne's more popular Westerns weren't fully serious, he rarely made out and out screen comedies. That's too bad, because he was quite adept at physical comedy, as his uncharacteristic role in &#34;Trouble Along the Way&#34; demonstrates. He's able to single handedly carry some very clich&eacute;d material in the movie.Wayne plays Steve Williams, a former college football coach now getting by as a pool hustler and bookie while trying to raise a very precocious pre-teen daughter (Sherry Jackson). When his snooty ex-wife threatens to sue for custody of their daughter, the Duke takes the only respectable job offer available, coach at a down-and-out small New York Catholic college.St. Anthony's College is dead broke and the diocese is about to close it down, but the kindly rector (Charles Coburn in the type role he was meant to play) gets the idea that a successful football program can raise enough money to save the school. So, Wayne has to work with a group of proverbial 98-pound weakling players who literally have only one single ball with which to practice. He also has to persuade social worker Donna Reed that he, not his ex-wife, has the daughter's best interests at heart.&#34;Trouble Along the Way&#34; is highly predictable and, at the time it was made, probably got by on equal doses of blarney charm and college spirit. It's a slick professional production with some top flight talent behind the screen, including director Michael Curtiz and composer Max Steiner. But what makes the movie fascinating to watch today (and accounts for my four star rating) is the bizarre and often hilarious disconnect between acceptable behavior sixty years ago and today.In scene after scene in this movie, my jaw dropped to see one plot development after another that seemed quite reasonable to the characters but would viewed completely differently today. It's no surprise that Wayne winds up attracted to Reed, but he chooses to make his affection known by manhandling her in her office and passionately kissing her. Of course, she reacts by suggesting they go out for a drink together after work to discuss the daughter's custody case. Once in the bar, he offers her a cigarette, &#34;the kind all the doctors smoke.&#34; Ethics and morays were quite different back then.Even more bizarre are the methods Wayne uses to build a winning team. He imports paid talent from a variety of places and doctors transcripts to get his players into the college. Then, he, his assistant coaches, and the players come to an agreement to split the gate and concession profits to augment the rather meager salary the school pays him.&#34;Trouble Along the Way&#34; isn't very good in a conventional sense, but I found it quite entertaining. It's not really a &#34;so bad it's good&#34; type of movie but a &#34;so anachronistically strange it's good&#34; movie. Those frequent guilty pleasure moments I experienced watching it, along with the enjoyment at seeing John Wayne do some comic pratfalls, make it a film I can easily recommend.",4,The Duke Plays It for Laughs,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,3053,"['many', 'John', 'Wayne', 'more', 'popular', 'Westerns', 'were', ""n't"", 'fully', 'serious', 'rarely', 'made', 'out', 'screen', 'comedies', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'quite', 'adept', 'physical', 'comedy', 'uncharacteristic', 'role', '34', 'Trouble', 'Way', '34', 'demonstrates', 'able', 'single', 'handedly', 'carry', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'material', 'movie.Wayne', 'Steve', 'Williams', 'former', 'college', 'football', 'coach', 'now', 'getting', 'pool', 'hustler', 'bookie', 'trying', 'raise', 'very', 'precocious', 'pre-teen', 'daughter', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'When', 'snooty', 'ex-wife', 'threatens', 'sue', 'custody', 'daughter', 'Duke', 'only', 'respectable', 'job', 'offer', 'available', 'coach', 'down-and-out', 'small', 'New', 'York', 'Catholic', 'college.St', 'Anthony', 'College', 'dead', 'broke', 'diocese', 'close', 'down', 'kindly', 'rector', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'type', 'role', 'was', 'meant', 'play', 'idea', 'successful', 'football', 'program', 'can', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'save', 'school', 'So', 'Wayne', 'work', 'group', 'proverbial', '98-pound', 'weakling', 'players', 'who', 'literally', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'single', 'ball', 'practice', 'also', 'persuade', 'social', 'worker', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'not', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'best', 'interests', 'heart.', '34', 'Trouble', 'Way', '34', 'highly', 'predictable', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'probably', 'got', 'equal', 'doses', 'blarney', 'charm', 'college', 'spirit', 'slick', 'professional', 'production', 'top', 'flight', 'talent', 'screen', 'including', 'director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'composer', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'what', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'today', 'accounts', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'bizarre', 'often', 'hilarious', 'disconnect', 'acceptable', 'behavior', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'today.In', 'scene', 'scene', 'movie', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'see', 'one', 'plot', 'development', 'seemed', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'characters', 'would', 'viewed', 'completely', 'differently', 'today', 'surprise', 'Wayne', 'up', 'attracted', 'Reed', 'make', 'affection', 'known', 'manhandling', 'office', 'passionately', 'kissing', 'course', 'suggesting', 'go', 'out', 'drink', 'together', 'work', 'discuss', 'daughter', 'custody', 'case', 'Once', 'bar', 'cigarette', '34', 'kind', 'doctors', 'smoke.', '34', 'Ethics', 'morays', 'were', 'quite', 'different', 'back', 'then.Even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'are', 'methods', 'Wayne', 'build', 'winning', 'team', 'paid', 'talent', 'variety', 'places', 'doctors', 'transcripts', 'get', 'players', 'college', 'Then', 'assistant', 'coaches', 'players', 'come', 'agreement', 'split', 'gate', 'concession', 'profits', 'augment', 'rather', 'meager', 'salary', 'school', 'him.', '34', 'Trouble', 'Way', '34', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'conventional', 'sense', 'found', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'not', 'really', '34', 'so', 'bad', 'good', '34', 'type', 'movie', '34', 'so', 'anachronistically', 'strange', 'good', '34', 'movie', 'frequent', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'moments', 'experienced', 'watching', 'enjoyment', 'seeing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'do', 'comic', 'pratfalls', 'make', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'recommend']",N/A

He is the reason to watch this melodrama, which does not have a single moment of realism. A young Donna Reed is Duke's love interest, although she begins as his antagonist. (Yes, that happens often in movies, hardly ever in real life.) Marie Windsor,as Wayne's ex-wife,  creates a custody fight just out of spite (now THAT does occur almost as frequently in real life as in the movies.) John is a disgraced college coach (paying players, can you believe it?) given a second chance by a bankrupt Catholic school. And Mr. Coburn is the heart and soul of the film as the head of the college. Duke's kid is adorable and sassy, his new employer somehow gets the best Catholic college teams of the 50's to put little St. Anthony's on their schedule all in the same season with only four months' notice, and somehow a happy ending gets done after a few severe complications. The movie, in spite of its flaws, turns out to be a lot of fun. Nobody needs to see it twice, but you do root for Coburn, Wayne, Reed and the kid and even the team he assembles from outcasts and academic failures, although there is no time to get to know those players.
