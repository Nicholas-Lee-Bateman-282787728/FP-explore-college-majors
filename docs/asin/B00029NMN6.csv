828571,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00029NMN6,A. Schneider,"[8, 10]","** Spoilers **RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio is not a traditional anime movie in the sense that it precedes, follows from, or slightly strays from the series. For the amount of rehashing of old scenes the movie does, it is not a series rehash episode to help fill the audience in either.RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio is the retelling of Ayato Kamina life before, during and after the incidents that transpire in RahXephon the series. While many of the scenes are recaps of what occurred during the series, to those that haven't seen the series in its entirety they probably won't make too much sense. Despite ridicules claims that the movie does not follow the storylines presented in the series, this reviewer can only find one instance in which this occurs: where Quon during the movie remains asleep and should be awake and present during Ayato's life outside Tokyo Jupiter.For the full impact of the series one should most certainly see RahXephon the series (the purchase over the movie is recommended... essentially that's the only thing that is a requirement in the world of RahXephon). However those looking for a companion that introduces their favorite characters and experiences through different perspectives, feel free to pick up the movie after seeing the series. For those that know how things turn out in the series, the RahXephon team carefully introduces new scenes and segments which show what was going on behind the scenes from the series.The ""behind the scenes"" material isn't earth shaking new material; instead it confirms what many fans knew to have occurred during the course of the series. That is to say that Terra's motives for their actions did not reflect Ayato's emotional well-being - they, in fact, used him as many fans gathered by the end of the series. Again, while nothing earth shaking, the new content is a condensed version of the series which comes across nicely.Some of the finer aspects of the movie come across in the beginning segments of the film as well as the end segments. In the beginning we see Ayato's life with his childhood love and can sympathize with him more (we also see how frequently he thinks of his childhood love and how later, in time, his childhood love still thinks of him). The ending of the movie simply confirms the end of the series while showing you something akin to ""where are they now"" segments. Truly beautiful but short and in and of themselves do not constitute ""earth shaking"" new material.One of the greatest scenes found only in Pluralitas Concentio is a scene in which Ayato meets up with Haruka shortly after she intercepts the union (or conflict) between Quon and Ayato (essentially a union which will decide how the world is tuned and which forces will prevail victorious). During this scene an almost-stoic Ayato stands before Haruka and explains just what is happening to the world, a world which is filled with dissonant sounds which needs to be retuned. In addition to that those that enjoyed philosophical and religious references found within the series will like how Ayato  explains at great length  how he, now, stands apart from past and future (essentially becoming almost Buddha-like figure), and will essentially live in all things.RahXephon is a beautiful series and I highly recommend you see it. I would rent RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio before purchasing it just to ensure that you'll enjoy it. Not a fan of ""recap"" episodes in anime series, I have to admit I enjoyed Pluralitas Concentio quite a bit. The DVD scores a 4.5 out of 5 while the series itself scores a 5.",4,A World in Discord,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,3573,"['**', 'Spoilers', '**RahXephon', 'Pluralitas', 'Concentio', 'not', 'traditional', 'anime', 'movie', 'sense', 'slightly', 'strays', 'series', 'amount', 'rehashing', 'old', 'scenes', 'movie', 'not', 'series', 'rehash', 'episode', 'help', 'fill', 'audience', 'either.RahXephon', 'Pluralitas', 'Concentio', 'retelling', 'Ayato', 'Kamina', 'life', 'incidents', 'transpire', 'RahXephon', 'series', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'recaps', 'what', 'occurred', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'entirety', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'ridicules', 'claims', 'movie', 'not', 'follow', 'storylines', 'presented', 'series', 'reviewer', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'Quon', 'movie', 'asleep', 'should', 'be', 'awake', 'present', 'Ayato', 'life', 'Tokyo', 'Jupiter.For', 'full', 'impact', 'series', 'one', 'should', 'most', 'certainly', 'see', 'RahXephon', 'series', 'purchase', 'movie', 'recommended', 'essentially', 'only', 'thing', 'requirement', 'world', 'RahXephon', 'However', 'looking', 'companion', 'favorite', 'characters', 'experiences', 'different', 'perspectives', 'feel', 'free', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'seeing', 'series', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'series', 'RahXephon', 'team', 'carefully', 'new', 'scenes', 'segments', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scenes', 'series.The', 'scenes', 'material', ""n't"", 'earth', 'shaking', 'new', 'material', 'instead', 'what', 'many', 'fans', 'knew', 'have', 'occurred', 'course', 'series', 'say', 'Terra', 'motives', 'actions', 'did', 'not', 'reflect', 'Ayato', 'emotional', 'well-being', 'fact', 'used', 'many', 'fans', 'gathered', 'end', 'series', 'Again', 'nothing', 'earth', 'shaking', 'new', 'content', 'condensed', 'version', 'series', 'nicely.Some', 'finer', 'aspects', 'movie', 'come', 'beginning', 'segments', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'segments', 'beginning', 'see', 'Ayato', 'life', 'childhood', 'love', 'can', 'sympathize', 'more', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'frequently', 'childhood', 'love', 'how', 'later', 'time', 'childhood', 'love', 'still', 'ending', 'movie', 'simply', 'end', 'series', 'showing', 'something', 'akin', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'segments', 'Truly', 'beautiful', 'short', 'do', 'not', 'constitute', 'earth', 'shaking', 'new', 'material.One', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'found', 'only', 'Pluralitas', 'Concentio', 'scene', 'Ayato', 'up', 'Haruka', 'shortly', 'union', 'conflict', 'Quon', 'Ayato', 'essentially', 'union', 'will', 'decide', 'how', 'world', 'tuned', 'forces', 'will', 'prevail', 'victorious', 'scene', 'almost-stoic', 'Ayato', 'Haruka', 'just', 'what', 'happening', 'world', 'world', 'filled', 'dissonant', 'sounds', 'be', 'retuned', 'addition', 'enjoyed', 'philosophical', 'religious', 'references', 'found', 'series', 'will', 'like', 'how', 'Ayato', 'great', 'length', 'how', 'now', 'stands', 'apart', 'past', 'future', 'essentially', 'becoming', 'almost', 'Buddha-like', 'figure', 'will', 'essentially', 'live', 'things.RahXephon', 'beautiful', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'would', 'rent', 'RahXephon', 'Pluralitas', 'Concentio', 'purchasing', 'just', 'ensure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Not', 'fan', 'recap', 'episodes', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'Pluralitas', 'Concentio', 'quite', 'bit', 'DVD', '4.5', '5', 'series', '5']",N/A

The film is beautifully done, the animation is out of this world and the story is unforgettable and amazing. I love this movie but having seen this first I don't have an attachment to the series and therefore I can give a review just for this movie.  I watched some of the series after and I have to say that trying to do that will confuse the hell out of you so I understand why the reviewers who have seen the series first rated it the way they did. Still as a retelling in some ways it is done poorly. For one scenes in the film make it seem like an Evangellion Death & Rebirth styleized DVD.

828577,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00029NMN6,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[5, 7]","There seems to be quite a difference of opinion on this two-hour feature film based on the RahXephon series.  I find my impressions are mixed, but that overall the film provides a different angle on the original story.  One that touches more on emotional factors, and ekes out several things that are easy to miss in the series.The plot, for those who haven't seen the series, is the tale of Ayato Kamina, who is caught in Tokyo during an alien invasion.  The city is separated from the rest of the world, and the human inhabitants are convinced that they are the only survivors.  When Ayato reaches the age of 17, a sudden meeting with a secret agent (Haruka Shitow) turns his world upside down.  He discovers the truth and finds that he is connected with a giant robotic creature called the RahXephon.He leaves Tokyo to aid humanity in stopping the aliens (Mu).  Ayato is an instrumentalist, half human half Mulan, and badly torn over the path he should follow and his true nature.  He is haunted by an old relationship and faces a complicated, metaphysical crisis or two.What I especially liked -The story isn't exactly different, but it focuses much better on the abridged romance between Haruka and Ayato.  In the series, which has time to develop the detailed characters better, let time is spent on this theme.  There are hints along the way, but only at the end does it achieve prominence.  In the film Ayato's female relationships are the key element.  This clarifies some of the confusion of the series.One the other hand -Either there was a very poor transfer or the film was made with sloppier artwork.  Nor is the music of the same quality. Character development is seriously abridged, as is often the case in a feature length version.  There are several cases, though, where it would have been better to leave out a character entirely.  And poor Quon Kisaragi is barely a shadow of her series self, which is a shame.  And finally there are some monologues which try to be lectures on the theory behind the action.  These border on the tedious.It's certainly worth renting the film especially if you have seen the series and are looking for a bit more light.  But while the series manages to combine action, romance, and some interesting ethical questions, the film is more monotonic.  If you have a choice I would recommend viewing the series, which is beautifully made and acted.",3,Doesn't quite live up to its promise...,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2394,"['be', 'quite', 'difference', 'opinion', 'two-hour', 'feature', 'film', 'based', 'RahXephon', 'series', 'find', 'impressions', 'are', 'mixed', 'overall', 'film', 'different', 'angle', 'original', 'story', 'One', 'more', 'emotional', 'factors', 'out', 'several', 'things', 'are', 'easy', 'miss', 'series.The', 'plot', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'tale', 'Ayato', 'Kamina', 'who', 'caught', 'Tokyo', 'alien', 'invasion', 'city', 'separated', 'rest', 'world', 'human', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'convinced', 'are', 'only', 'survivors', 'When', 'Ayato', 'age', '17', 'sudden', 'meeting', 'secret', 'agent', 'Haruka', 'Shitow', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'truth', 'connected', 'giant', 'robotic', 'creature', 'called', 'RahXephon.He', 'Tokyo', 'aid', 'humanity', 'stopping', 'aliens', 'Mu', 'Ayato', 'instrumentalist', 'half', 'human', 'half', 'Mulan', 'badly', 'torn', 'path', 'should', 'follow', 'true', 'nature', 'haunted', 'old', 'relationship', 'complicated', 'metaphysical', 'crisis', 'especially', 'liked', '-The', 'story', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'different', 'much', 'better', 'abridged', 'romance', 'Haruka', 'Ayato', 'series', 'time', 'develop', 'detailed', 'characters', 'better', 'let', 'time', 'spent', 'theme', 'are', 'hints', 'way', 'only', 'end', 'achieve', 'prominence', 'film', 'Ayato', 'female', 'relationships', 'are', 'key', 'element', 'confusion', 'series.One', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'transfer', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'sloppier', 'artwork', 'music', 'same', 'quality', 'Character', 'development', 'seriously', 'abridged', 'often', 'case', 'feature', 'length', 'version', 'are', 'several', 'cases', 'though', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'leave', 'out', 'character', 'entirely', 'poor', 'Quon', 'Kisaragi', 'barely', 'shadow', 'series', 'self', 'shame', 'finally', 'are', 'monologues', 'try', 'be', 'lectures', 'theory', 'action', 'border', 'tedious.It', 'certainly', 'worth', 'renting', 'film', 'especially', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'are', 'looking', 'bit', 'more', 'light', 'series', 'combine', 'action', 'romance', 'interesting', 'ethical', 'questions', 'film', 'more', 'monotonic', 'have', 'choice', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'series', 'beautifully', 'made', 'acted']",N/A

This movie rates high in both categories. I viewed the series in total a few years ago on DVD and was left feeling confused and unsure of what had actually happened. I'm in the process of rewatching the series, but only after having viewed the movie. In doing so, I now have better insight into the world and characters of Rah-Xephon.The movie is emotionally charged. There really is no other way to put it. I must agree with some of the other reviews in that it skips from here-to-there in a number of places and that character development is lacking (for most of the players) when compared to the series. The exception would have to be Ayato Kamina's ""other"" female friend from school, Hiroko Asahina. Her death in the series was tragic. In the movie it is even more so because we have a better understanding of her feelings for Ayato. We learn that her love for him is as long-lived and every bit as deep as the shared love between Ayato and Haruka. That Hiroko's love is unrequited until just before her death makes it all the more tragic.Recommendation: This is a hard one to recommend. Mostly because it is so different from the series. If you've seen the series and were left confused then Rah-Xephon: Pluralitas Concentio should be on your ""must buy"" list.One last point: The end title song for the movie, Tune the Rainbow is a wonderful piece of music.
