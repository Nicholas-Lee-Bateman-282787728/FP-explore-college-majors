It's a shame IFC didn't release the second season too but I guess even they have bean counters in suits declaring comedicgenius is not profitable.

1068966,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000P6R9OY,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[5, 9]","I usually dislike TV shows and films about the ""business"" (ironically, that's a title of another IFC show about the film business that is mean, cruel, crass, and obnoxious), but I am really liking this show.  Yes, it's about the film business, Hollywood, L.A., and the tons of crap that you have to put up with, but it's not so inside that only people who work in the business can understand.  It's not filled with gratuitous celebrity cameos either.  Some ""insider"" shows, like The Larry Sanders Show, had this smug, ""aren't we corrupt, let's indulge in it"" attitude.  Most of the celebrity cameos were celebrities just playing themselves, which wasn't particularly creative, and most of the character in Sanders (sans Hank, brilliantly played by Jeffrey Tambor) seemed more like caricatures than anything else.  Here, the 2 main characters, played by Nicole Tom and the show's creator Laura Kightlinger, feel like real people.  The series is actually quite funny, only occasionally resorting to lame shock humour or childish behaviour (even though when it does, it cheapens the series).  It's also nice to see Laura Kightlinger get some overdue recognition.  She was a standup comedienne in the 1990's who hosted several shows on Comedy Central.  All she was really known for was a stint on SNL, a consulting producer on Will and Grace, and being Jack Black's girlfriend for 5 years or so (before he dumped her just when he got big).  I used to watch the her standup show because I had a HUGE crush on her (and still do).  I don't remember any of the comics I saw, I just like to look at her.  She still is beautiful, and this series is very good.",4,"A surprisingly good sendup of the ""business""....",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,1649,"['usually', 'dislike', 'TV', 'shows', 'films', 'business', 'ironically', 'title', 'IFC', 'show', 'film', 'business', 'mean', 'cruel', 'crass', 'obnoxious', 'am', 'really', 'liking', 'show', 'Yes', 'film', 'business', 'Hollywood', 'L.A.', 'tons', 'crap', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'not', 'so', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'business', 'can', 'understand', 'not', 'filled', 'gratuitous', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'insider', 'shows', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'had', 'smug', 'are', ""n't"", 'corrupt', 'let', 'indulge', 'attitude', 'Most', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'were', 'celebrities', 'just', 'playing', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'creative', 'most', 'character', 'Sanders', 'sans', 'Hank', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'seemed', 'more', 'caricatures', 'anything', 'else', 'Here', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Tom', 'show', 'creator', 'Laura', 'Kightlinger', 'feel', 'real', 'people', 'series', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'only', 'occasionally', 'resorting', 'lame', 'shock', 'humour', 'childish', 'behaviour', 'even', 'when', 'series', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Laura', 'Kightlinger', 'get', 'overdue', 'recognition', 'was', 'standup', 'comedienne', '1990', 'who', 'hosted', 'several', 'shows', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'was', 'really', 'known', 'was', 'stint', 'SNL', 'consulting', 'producer', 'Will', 'Grace', 'being', 'Jack', 'Black', 'girlfriend', '5', 'years', 'so', 'dumped', 'just', 'when', 'got', 'big', 'used', 'watch', 'standup', 'show', 'had', 'HUGE', 'crush', 'still', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'comics', 'saw', 'just', 'look', 'still', 'beautiful', 'series', 'very', 'good']",The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman
1068967,A1X1UZWUIDHCJ5,B000P6R9OY,Marc Harshbarger,"[1, 1]","Laura Kightlinger and Nicholle Tom are today's Lucy and Ethel--or Laverne and Shirley--if those characters were getting drunk, taking pills and swearing like truck drivers (no, these gals swear worse than truck drivers).  The basic premise of the show is writer Jackie (Laura) and her best friend Tara (Nicholle) are trying to find fame and fortune out in Hollywood, but nothing ever seems to go right for them.  These two ladies are a hoot.  You will laugh out loud.  You might even wet yourself so be careful while watching this hilarious series.  I loved that two of my favorite actresses--Sally Kellerman and Colleen Camp--both show up in episodes and join in the fun.  I also have to mention the wonderful Azura Skye and Patrick Bristow who play Jackie's co-workers (I wanted to see more of them!).  The humor is very dark and twisted--just so you know--but if you've got a warped sense of humor like I do, you will probably fall head over heels for the lovely Jackie Woodman and the delightful Tara Wentzel.  I want to party with these ladies--or at least buy the DVDs of the second, third and fourth seasons of their terrific show.",5,I can't wait for Jackie's second season!!!,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,1138,"['Laura', 'Kightlinger', 'Nicholle', 'Tom', 'are', 'today', 'Lucy', 'Ethel', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'characters', 'were', 'getting', 'drunk', 'taking', 'pills', 'swearing', 'truck', 'drivers', 'gals', 'swear', 'worse', 'truck', 'drivers', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'writer', 'Jackie', 'Laura', 'best', 'friend', 'Tara', 'Nicholle', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'fame', 'fortune', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'nothing', 'ever', 'go', 'right', 'two', 'ladies', 'are', 'hoot', 'will', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'might', 'even', 'wet', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'watching', 'hilarious', 'series', 'loved', 'two', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Colleen', 'Camp', 'show', 'up', 'episodes', 'join', 'fun', 'also', 'have', 'mention', 'wonderful', 'Azura', 'Skye', 'Patrick', 'Bristow', 'who', 'play', 'Jackie', 'co-workers', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'humor', 'very', 'dark', 'twisted', 'just', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'warped', 'sense', 'humor', 'do', 'will', 'probably', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'lovely', 'Jackie', 'Woodman', 'delightful', 'Tara', 'Wentzel', 'want', 'party', 'ladies', 'least', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'terrific', 'show']",The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","IFC's The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman isn't always a laugh out loud send-up the movie business (like, well, IFC's other send-up The Business), but where it succeeds are in some small moments of pure brilliance that really make the show something special.  The criminally underrated Laura Kightlinger stars as Jackie Woodman; a would-be screen-writer stuck writing for a Hollywood rag.  Her best friend and frequent driver Tara (an all grown up Nicholle Tom) is along for the ride, as Jackie finds herself getting wooed by a graphic novelist (Giuseppe Andrews) and then having to work with him, along with experiencing the ""joys"" of peyote, and finally getting addicted to a prescription drug and becoming even more addicted to an uber-conservative radio host (Ray Wise).  The characters are richly brought to life, and while the show isn't instantly enjoyable right off the bat, it still comes off as something special to behold.  All in all, The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman is a show that deserves your attention, and this is a DVD worth picking up to boot.",4,One of the best show's you've never seen,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,1082,"['IFC', 'Minor', 'Accomplishments', 'Jackie', 'Woodman', ""n't"", 'always', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'send-up', 'movie', 'business', 'well', 'IFC', 'other', 'send-up', 'Business', 'where', 'are', 'small', 'moments', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'really', 'make', 'show', 'something', 'special', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Laura', 'Kightlinger', 'Jackie', 'Woodman', 'would-be', 'screen-writer', 'stuck', 'writing', 'Hollywood', 'rag', 'best', 'friend', 'frequent', 'driver', 'Tara', 'grown', 'up', 'Nicholle', 'Tom', 'ride', 'Jackie', 'getting', 'wooed', 'graphic', 'novelist', 'Giuseppe', 'Andrews', 'then', 'having', 'work', 'experiencing', 'joys', 'peyote', 'finally', 'getting', 'addicted', 'prescription', 'drug', 'becoming', 'even', 'more', 'addicted', 'uber-conservative', 'radio', 'host', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'characters', 'are', 'richly', 'brought', 'life', 'show', ""n't"", 'instantly', 'enjoyable', 'right', 'bat', 'still', 'off', 'something', 'special', 'behold', 'Minor', 'Accomplishments', 'Jackie', 'Woodman', 'show', 'attention', 'DVD', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'boot']",The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman
