400780,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6304092032,darragh o'donoghue,"[11, 14]","'Gunman's Walk' is one of those terrific films whose narrow focus actually serves to encompass huge themes, such as Family, Race, History, Nation.  It is at this point that the provincial or local becomes properly mythic.  Because although the story isn't really about much - a father, his kids, a murder - it is also based on the oldest story of them all, that of Oedipus the King, the story of a man who unwittingly killed his father, bringing plague upon the country he ruled.Although the Oedipal story seems deeply tragic and anti-social, it has been used by Freud and his followers to explain the processes of socialisation through sexuality.  The only way a society can ensure its continued survival is through a process that is adequately symolised in the Oedipus story - a child may resent his father's power over him, but one day he'll have to take his place in society, to 'kill' him.  Here the Oedipus story becomes a positive thing for conservative societies that locate themselves in the family.  Paradoxically, although it is the 'natural' order of things, it involves a great struggle, neither man willing to give up his position.And this is the crux of 'Gunman's Walk'  Lee Hackett is one of those legendary characters who tamed the West, who got there before the law did, who sees himself as a kind of privileged Founding Father.  Except father is the wrong word - he is so afraid of growing old, of being surpassed, that he insists his sons call him 'Lee', while retaining the powers of a father - he has to beat them in everything, convince himself he's still  young.  as this is contrary to nature, a sort of plague ensues, leading to moral breakdown, where a man can murder another and get away with it, because good old dad, sorry Lee, will sort it out.Lee's two sons have wildly divergent ways of dealing with their father's overwhelming pre-eminence.  Danny is the sensible, sensitive one, who defeats his dad, plays the Oedipal game, by simply ignoring his values, his macho gun-play, his turning everyday activities into masculine rites and tests.  He ignores his racism and his stifling brand of family loyalty.Ed, on the other hand, takes Dad at his word, and tries to defeat him.  Unlike Lee, though, he has not got a powerful social apparatus that he helped create to help him, and he goes speedily, violently, trigger-happy insane.  The film's best sequences involve Ed's increasingly doomed and desperate attempts to prove his manhood, to surpass his dad.The film, with its youthful, teen-market stars, seems to centre on the brothers, but it is really about Lee.  He is a near-tragic figure, his two sons split versions of his self, his potential for good leading to family, and his history mired in violence taken to extremes.  Van Heflin's brilliant performance, revealing the desperation behind the bluster, convinces us of this.But, as his name suggests, Lee represents so much more - America, its history.  the murdered boy is a Red Indian - Lee's stature derives from his own battles with the Indians which helped create the West.  Times have changed: family, civilisation and reconciliation must replace violence, reputation and individualism.  it sounds so easy, but director Karlson emphasises the fierce trauma and disruption of the process.  His deftly buoyant camerawork during action sequences is among the most vivid and exciting I have ever seen.",4,A model Western.,1001030400,"09 21, 2001",2001,3394,"[""'Gunman"", 'Walk', 'one', 'terrific', 'films', 'narrow', 'focus', 'actually', 'encompass', 'huge', 'themes', 'such', 'Family', 'Race', 'History', 'Nation', 'point', 'provincial', 'local', 'becomes', 'properly', 'mythic', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'about', 'much', 'father', 'kids', 'murder', 'also', 'based', 'oldest', 'story', 'Oedipus', 'King', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'killed', 'father', 'bringing', 'plague', 'country', 'Oedipal', 'story', 'deeply', 'tragic', 'anti-social', 'been', 'used', 'Freud', 'followers', 'explain', 'processes', 'socialisation', 'sexuality', 'only', 'way', 'society', 'can', 'ensure', 'continued', 'survival', 'process', 'adequately', 'symolised', 'Oedipus', 'story', 'child', 'may', 'resent', 'father', 'power', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'place', 'society', ""'kill"", 'Here', 'Oedipus', 'story', 'positive', 'thing', 'conservative', 'societies', 'locate', 'family', 'Paradoxically', ""'natural"", 'order', 'things', 'great', 'struggle', 'man', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'position.And', 'crux', ""'Gunman"", 'Walk', 'Lee', 'Hackett', 'one', 'legendary', 'characters', 'who', 'tamed', 'West', 'who', 'got', 'law', 'did', 'who', 'kind', 'privileged', 'Founding', 'Father', 'father', 'wrong', 'word', 'so', 'afraid', 'growing', 'old', 'being', 'surpassed', 'sons', 'call', ""'Lee"", 'retaining', 'powers', 'father', 'beat', 'everything', 'convince', 'still', 'young', 'contrary', 'nature', 'sort', 'plague', 'ensues', 'leading', 'moral', 'breakdown', 'where', 'man', 'can', 'murder', 'get', 'away', 'because', 'good', 'old', 'dad', 'sorry', 'Lee', 'will', 'sort', 'two', 'sons', 'have', 'wildly', 'divergent', 'ways', 'dealing', 'father', 'overwhelming', 'pre-eminence', 'Danny', 'sensible', 'sensitive', 'one', 'who', 'dad', 'Oedipal', 'game', 'simply', 'ignoring', 'values', 'macho', 'gun-play', 'turning', 'everyday', 'activities', 'masculine', 'rites', 'tests', 'racism', 'stifling', 'brand', 'family', 'loyalty.Ed', 'other', 'hand', 'Dad', 'word', 'tries', 'defeat', 'Lee', 'though', 'not', 'got', 'powerful', 'social', 'apparatus', 'helped', 'create', 'help', 'speedily', 'violently', 'trigger-happy', 'insane', 'film', 'best', 'sequences', 'involve', 'Ed', 'increasingly', 'doomed', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'prove', 'manhood', 'surpass', 'dad.The', 'film', 'youthful', 'teen-market', 'stars', 'centre', 'brothers', 'really', 'Lee', 'near-tragic', 'figure', 'two', 'sons', 'split', 'versions', 'self', 'potential', 'good', 'leading', 'family', 'history', 'mired', 'violence', 'taken', 'extremes', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'revealing', 'desperation', 'bluster', 'this.But', 'name', 'Lee', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'America', 'history', 'murdered', 'boy', 'Red', 'Indian', 'Lee', 'stature', 'own', 'battles', 'Indians', 'helped', 'create', 'West', 'Times', 'have', 'changed', 'family', 'civilisation', 'reconciliation', 'must', 'replace', 'violence', 'reputation', 'individualism', 'so', 'easy', 'director', 'Karlson', 'fierce', 'trauma', 'disruption', 'process', 'deftly', 'buoyant', 'camerawork', 'action', 'sequences', 'most', 'vivid', 'exciting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Gunman's Walk VHS

He wants to raise his kids to be as macho as he was and is but, as the film shows, he fails. The oldest and favorite of his two sons is Tab Hunter, who is very spoiled. He hates how his father orders him around. He is very violent with other people. He also hates Indians. The film shows how he gets into trouble several times.

400782,A20SO3O9ODU8KF,6304092032,"Laurence G. Cripe ""ScriptMaverick""","[3, 3]","Few westerns pack as much drama, family tragedy, character contrasts, prejudice, and western pioneer history as 'Gunman's Walk'.  If Van Heflin could sing, this could have been a Hackett family sing-along...but then,  maybe not!  Both Tab Hunter and James Darren were tracking singing and acting careers - this happens to be Tab Hunter's best performance as the rogue malcontent, Ed Hackett.  James Darren plays quite the opposite as the easy-going, fun-loving Davy Hackett.  Then there's a veteran cast of characters that makes this motion picture a real stand-out for its time.  Ray Teal, Ed Platt, Mickey Shaughnessy, Bert Convy, Robert Simon, and Paul Birch add class to this film - Simon is particularly effective as the Sheriff.  Mrs. Bing Crosby (Kathryn Grant) plays the beautiful half-breed love interest that divides the brothers.  And, of course, there's Van Heflin - the patriarch who lives past his prime and raises two sons on his own - fresh from another western classic,'3:10 to Yuma'.  Heflin is gritty and masterful as the powerful Lee Hackett - certainly a template for Ben Cartwright in the soon-to-be 'Bonanza' TV series.  This is what a western is supposed to be - entertaining to the very last.

When the Spanish version offers a title which is translated as 'The Wages of Violence', you know that you're in for a long haul. The story of a gnarled old patriarch (Van Heflin) with two entirely different sons, a baddie played by Tab Hunter and a goodie, played by James Darren, is easily outlassed by 'Broken Lance' where Spencer Tracy has similar problems with his brood. Heflin is no Tracy, and neither Hunter nor Darren can compare with Richard Widmark. The theme, so inanely developed here, had been covered before in 'Duel in the Dust' where Joseph Cotten is the goodie, and Gregory Peck is the baddie. The trouble is that Jennifer Jones is more seductive and feistier than Kathryn Grant even if neither of them gives any indication of native American roots. I like Van Heflin. He was great in 'Shane' and pretty effective in '3.10 to Yuma', but when he breaks down in tears at the end of this movie, I sympathise with him.

Most of the films that he was forced to make... well... like Elvis... his handlers put him in shlock... Either the films were no good or his role that of vanilla coated All American Boy....Damn Yankees fun... and They Came to Cordura gave a hint of his acting talent... But Gunman's Walk... well... his handlers must have been at the casino or something... This is definitely Hunter's top performance....Very much cast against type... His character is handsome and intelligent... fit and skilled... and largely a sociopath... His few fits and seizures of decency... such as addressing his brother's concern for his injury... are almost awkward... as if rusty......He has a massive chip on his shoulder... thinking that he needs to be better than his father (Van Heflin) a legend of the frontier... and he resents the fact that he will never do it... The film starts at a time when Hunter's character starting to act out in very dangerous ways... refusing to see the dangers... or accept the consequences...A good plot...that deals with complex issues... Not your average ""Blazing Guns West of the Pecos"" film.  Fine supporting cast.  Van Heflin as the father who knows better but threatens a severely wounded man if he dares testify against his son...  But unlike his son, Heflin knows where the final line is... (Heflin and Hunter had worked together in late '54 on Battle Cry)Hunter must have relished his chance to utterly abandon the squeeky clean image for at least one film.  Other actors in his shoes might have given an over the top performance... but Hunter knew that his character suffering from years of self-doubt and resentment coming to the surface all at once... Not an evil man... but a man doing bad things because his moral compass stuck in the wrong position.It is said that in 1948... John Ford saw John Wayne in Red River and said... ""I didn't know that big lug could really act..."" and Wayne's career headed towards many better films.  Elvis wanted to be the white racist in The Defiant Ones... might have opened a career in vastly better films... but ""Colonel Parker"" (his handler) flat out said no... Parker was good at making money... but nothing else...Unlike Elvis... Tab Hunter had a chance to show what he could do...
