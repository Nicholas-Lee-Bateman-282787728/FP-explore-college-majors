First, let me say that Julianne Hough does a respectable job, especially for her lack of acting experience, and Duhamel is acceptable as well.  But, the move is incredibly slow until the last 30 minutes, the plot and details so unbelievable that I couldn't lose myself in the story, like a good movie should allow you to do.  The ""twist"" at the end just leaves you shaking your head, the perfect ""last straw"" for a movie that had too many implausible scenarios.  The implausibilities could have been so easily remedied but laziness appears to have been the order of the day when making this film.  This is NOT ""The Notebook"", by any stretch.

1606443,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B00A7ZHDOO,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[9, 13]","I've never been a fan of Nicholas Sparks; I read A Walk to Remember when I was in high school at the recommendation of my friends who all cried and went bananas over the book, but I was unimpressed. Since then, I've been turning my nose up at anything having to do with Sparks. And then, for some reason, maybe because it was so cheap, I bought the book Safe Haven on my Kindle, blew through it in no time, and found that I actually enjoyed the story, especially because the book allows readers into the mind of the man after the heroine.It follows then that I had to see this movie.Katie (Julianne Hough) is a girl on the run -- from what the viewers don't know, but it's not that hard to figure out. If you're one of those viewers who falls for every, single thing shown on screen, then what she's running from may come as a surprise, but then I just feel sorry for you. She makes her way from Boston to a small town in (North?) Carolina. Location doesn't matter. What matters is that she's found her ""safe haven,"" far from whatever troubles she had been running from. She makes friends with a little girl, Lexie, who's father, Alex (Josh Duhamel), owns the general store right on the water. Katie also makes another friend named Jo, a woman who claims to be a neighbor to Katie's teeny shanty in the woods. Katie frequents the store to buy rice and paint and what not and continues to be friendly with Lexie, which of course interests Alex, as does the mystery of her appearance in the town at all. Cue the mellow tunes, show the waves lapping, show small town people walking down the street, have a parade, catch fish, go canoeing... These things, however, do not mean that this movie is your typical rom-com. I'd call it more of a wannabe thriller/romantic movie. It's not really funny. Forget the com.While I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices, it's worth a rental, especially if you like good looking people frolicking in idyllic settings, making goo goo guys at each other, with a happy ending that'll make you go, ""Aww..."" and ""Holy crap!"" at the same time (if you haven't read the book that is... if you have, then obviously nothing will come as a surprise.)I was annoyed that Julianne Hough's character, Katie, wasn't as terrified or vulnerable as her novel counterpart. Her genuine fear of men is part of what made the book interesting, and I didn't get the sense at all that she was afraid of Alex in the same way she is in the book.

1606481,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00A7ZHDOO,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Safe Haven is a pretty sweet film that drags on for far too long. It isn't too hard to figure out the first mystery within the first fifteen minutes, the surprise ending is telegraphed at about one hour.This is a romantic film. Julianne Hough is absolutely gorgeous as Katie. Josh Duhamel is her handsome romantic interest Alex. Most of the film takes place in a tiny beautiful seaside town in North Carolina. Cobie Smulders (How I Met Your Mother) breaks out of her Canadian role from the television series and is a sweet pretty friend to Katie. The soundtrack is beautiful in a folky Amos Lee, Shawn Mullins fashion. The closing credit song is a pretty song by Colbie Caillat - the very tone of the entire film.The problem with the film is that pretty gets old after the first hour. The plot moves along so slowly, at times it felt like nothing happened for ten minutes. The flashbacks are poorly done, interspersed as nightmares. But then that vernacular changes later in the film with a huge flashback pouring in during the middle of the day. Aside from being horribly boring, there was a massive continuity problem at the end of the film. The following is not really a spoiler, but some sensitive readers might want to skip the last part of this paragraph. Katie is forced to leave; she tells Alex she has to leave and cannot stay. He believes one thing; she never tells him anything else, other than she's leaving. Later on Alex knows the whole reason why she had to leave, but she never told him that part of the story. Given that this film was sooooo slow and so deliberate about everything it did, this gap is massive. I would guess that when the DVD is released, a 10 minute scene will be included in the deleted scenes where Katie explains all to Alex. Sadly, they cut this portion out and the actual dramatic resolution makes absolutely no sense. There's no way Alex could know what he says, because Katie never told him.In theory this is a romantic comedy geared mostly to female viewers. Oddly, I happen to like a lot of romantic movies. This movie just didn't work. My wife sitting next to me never talks during movies, she was so bored she started making comments. We both walked away thinking we wasted two hours. I can understand how some might cry at the end. There is a bittersweet twist that does a little bit of tear jerker. Unfortunately the whole film resolves in the last ten minutes and I was just happy it was over.The film is rated PG-13. It deals with a violent subject that some younger viewers might find objectionable. There are a number of fights and almost strangulation in the film. There is a bedroom scene where it is clear that the couple is having sex, but it is about broadcast television grade. There is very little strong language. There are a number of scenes with alcohol use.This is a pretty film. If it was a magazine, I'd say buy it for the pictures and nothing else. The articles are bad. Josh, Julianne, and Cobie are beautiful to look at. The scenery is beautiful. The story, not so pretty.",2,Oh So Long,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,3040,"['Safe', 'Haven', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'long', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'first', 'mystery', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'surprise', 'ending', 'telegraphed', 'one', 'hour.This', 'romantic', 'film', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Katie', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'handsome', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Alex', 'Most', 'film', 'place', 'tiny', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'town', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'How', 'Met', 'Your', 'Mother', 'Canadian', 'role', 'television', 'series', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'friend', 'Katie', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'folky', 'Amos', 'Lee', 'Shawn', 'Mullins', 'fashion', 'closing', 'credit', 'song', 'pretty', 'song', 'Colbie', 'Caillat', 'very', 'tone', 'entire', 'film.The', 'problem', 'film', 'pretty', 'old', 'first', 'hour', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'so', 'slowly', 'times', 'felt', 'nothing', 'happened', 'ten', 'minutes', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'poorly', 'done', 'interspersed', 'nightmares', 'then', 'vernacular', 'changes', 'later', 'film', 'huge', 'flashback', 'pouring', 'middle', 'day', 'Aside', 'being', 'horribly', 'boring', 'was', 'massive', 'continuity', 'problem', 'end', 'film', 'following', 'not', 'really', 'spoiler', 'sensitive', 'readers', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'last', 'part', 'paragraph', 'Katie', 'forced', 'leave', 'Alex', 'leave', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'anything', 'else', 'other', 'leaving', 'Later', 'Alex', 'whole', 'reason', 'why', 'had', 'leave', 'never', 'told', 'part', 'story', 'Given', 'film', 'was', 'sooooo', 'slow', 'so', 'deliberate', 'everything', 'did', 'gap', 'massive', 'would', 'guess', 'when', 'DVD', 'released', '10', 'minute', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'where', 'Katie', 'Alex', 'Sadly', 'cut', 'portion', 'actual', 'dramatic', 'resolution', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'way', 'Alex', 'could', 'know', 'what', 'Katie', 'never', 'told', 'him.In', 'theory', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'geared', 'mostly', 'female', 'viewers', 'Oddly', 'happen', 'like', 'lot', 'romantic', 'movies', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'wife', 'sitting', 'next', 'never', 'talks', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'started', 'making', 'comments', 'walked', 'away', 'thinking', 'wasted', 'two', 'hours', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'might', 'cry', 'end', 'bittersweet', 'twist', 'little', 'bit', 'tear', 'jerker', 'Unfortunately', 'whole', 'film', 'resolves', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'just', 'happy', 'was', 'over.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violent', 'subject', 'younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'objectionable', 'are', 'number', 'fights', 'almost', 'strangulation', 'film', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'where', 'clear', 'couple', 'having', 'sex', 'broadcast', 'television', 'grade', 'very', 'little', 'strong', 'language', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'alcohol', 'use.This', 'pretty', 'film', 'was', 'magazine', ""'d"", 'say', 'buy', 'pictures', 'nothing', 'else', 'articles', 'are', 'bad', 'Josh', 'Julianne', 'Cobie', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'pretty']",Safe Haven (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) [Bilingual]

Neither were any of the other movies (Dear John, The Notebook, etc...) - although, they did make quite an impact. But the purpose of Nicholas Sparks' books and the movies based on them is truth. Love at it's purest. It's about the story, not ""Emmy-worthy"" acting or (like someone pointed out and of which is ridiculous to base a movie on) the scratchiness of one's voice. Julianne Hough plays her character with a great honesty. You may not think it's the best acting compared to other actresses (who have a ton more experience, keep in mind), but she will make you believe her character. And to me, that's all I can ask of an actor/actress - to make me believe their performance.

1606518,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00A7ZHDOO,FNDNreview,"[13, 19]","Safe Haven, originally a novel written by Nicolas Sparks and released in 2010 under the same name, focuses on Katie (Julianne Hough), the shy, beautiful out-of-towner seeking a small, secluded town where she can hide from her dark, mysterious past.  Immediately, she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), the townie convenient store owner (with two kids and a recently deceased wife), and Jo (Cobie Smulders), her new neighbor from down the street.  After making several trips to the convenient store, Katie bonds with Alex&#8217;s six year old daughter, Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) &#8211; ultimately leading to Alex and Katie spending more time together.  The sparks fly, but it turns out Katie isn&#8217;t being totally honest with Alex &#8211; keeping her abusive husband (David Lyons) that&#8217;s searching for her from him.  Cue the drama...Apparently, Hitchcock-style twists and turns are all the rage these days, with Safe Haven being no exception.  While you may initially think this could potentially be the next Notebook, or at least an average love story &#8211; it&#8217;s going to disappoint you as it turns out to be so much more, and so much worse.  The acting, the scenery, the cast, the plot &#8211; it&#8217;s all overshadowed by the bizarre ending of the film.  The ending depreciates the film so much so that it basically forces you to shake your head, even though you might already be tearing up at the same time.  Yes, it&#8217;s really that mind-boggling and bewildering.Without a doubt, it would be incredibly easy to just trash this film due largely in part to the ending, except for the fact that this film was mildly tolerable until the climactic twist.  Let&#8217;s face facts here &#8211; Julianne Hough is known for her outstanding voice and dancing ability, while Josh Duhamel looks pretty out of place unless he has a gun in his hand, firing at space aliens made out of automobiles.  Obviously, these aren&#8217;t your typical star-powered actors and actresses &#8211; rather models that act.  There&#8217;s very little doubt that these two individuals are stunningly gorgeous as eye candy, but the overall quality of the film is sacrificed because of their limited acting ability.  Midway through the film, it&#8217;s a head-scratcher as to why Cobie Smulders is even in the film, since she has little to do with the plot until the very end of the film.  If this cast was anymore unmemorable and expendable, this film will be a perfect fit as a Lifetime original.  Never the less, this is still a Nicolas Sparks story, so it&#8217;s instantly going to garner a certain amount of attention, not to mention a healthy box office gross.Overall, this film is terribly generic and to call it anything less is irresponsible.  However, it&#8217;s not so bad that it shouldn&#8217;t be recommended to the film-goers it was created for &#8211; that being women.  Will the film bore guys to death with its lack of substance and slow-moving plot?  Yes, very much so &#8211; yet it&#8217;s ironic that the film&#8217;s only saving grace is also the same element that dooms the film:  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.Overall Film Grade:  D-FNDNreview.com",1,"'Safe Haven' another poor, generic romance",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,3158,"['Safe', 'Haven', 'originally', 'novel', 'written', 'Nicolas', 'Sparks', 'released', '2010', 'same', 'name', 'Katie', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'shy', 'beautiful', 'out-of-towner', 'seeking', 'small', 'secluded', 'town', 'where', 'can', 'hide', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Immediately', 'Alex', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'townie', 'convenient', 'store', 'owner', 'two', 'kids', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Jo', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'new', 'neighbor', 'street', 'making', 'several', 'trips', 'convenient', 'store', 'Katie', 'bonds', 'Alex', '8217', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Lexie', 'Mimi', 'Kirkland', '8211', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'Alex', 'Katie', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'sparks', 'fly', 'out', 'Katie', 'isn', '8217', 'being', 'totally', 'honest', 'Alex', '8211', 'keeping', 'abusive', 'husband', 'David', 'Lyons', '8217', 'searching', 'Cue', 'drama', 'Apparently', 'Hitchcock-style', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'rage', 'days', 'Safe', 'Haven', 'being', 'exception', 'may', 'initially', 'think', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'next', 'Notebook', 'least', 'average', 'love', 'story', '8211', '8217', 'going', 'disappoint', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'much', 'worse', 'acting', 'scenery', 'cast', 'plot', '8211', '8217', 'overshadowed', 'bizarre', 'ending', 'film', 'ending', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'basically', 'shake', 'head', 'even', 'might', 'already', 'be', 'tearing', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'Yes', '8217', 'really', 'mind-boggling', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'easy', 'just', 'trash', 'film', 'due', 'largely', 'part', 'ending', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'mildly', 'tolerable', 'climactic', 'twist', 'Let', '8217', 's', 'face', 'facts', 'here', '8211', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'known', 'outstanding', 'voice', 'dancing', 'ability', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'pretty', 'place', 'gun', 'hand', 'firing', 'space', 'aliens', 'made', 'automobiles', 'Obviously', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'typical', 'star-powered', 'actors', '8211', 'rather', 'models', 'act', '8217', 'very', 'little', 'doubt', 'two', 'individuals', 'are', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'eye', 'candy', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'sacrificed', 'limited', 'acting', 'ability', 'Midway', 'film', '8217', 's', 'head-scratcher', 'why', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'even', 'film', 'little', 'do', 'plot', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'cast', 'was', 'anymore', 'unmemorable', 'expendable', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Lifetime', 'original', 'less', 'still', 'Nicolas', 'Sparks', 'story', '8217', 'instantly', 'going', 'garner', 'certain', 'amount', 'attention', 'not', 'mention', 'healthy', 'box', 'office', 'gross.Overall', 'film', 'terribly', 'generic', 'call', 'anything', 'irresponsible', 'However', '8217', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'shouldn', '8217', 'be', 'recommended', 'film-goers', 'was', 'created', '8211', 'being', 'women', 'Will', 'film', 'bore', 'guys', 'death', 'lack', 'substance', 'slow-moving', 'plot', 'Yes', 'very', 'much', '8211', '8217', 'ironic', 'film', '8217', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'also', 'same', 'element', 'film', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'Josh', 'Duhamel.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'D-FNDNreview.com']",Safe Haven (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) [Bilingual]

Nothing except for poppycock made by none other than the great genius of romance (or GGOR) himself, Nicky Sparks, can be considered anything close to what TRUE romance really is!It follows then that Safe Haven is the greatest work of art depicting true romance since Lady and the Tramp (now available on VHS and laser disc)! When I saw this early in the morning today, on Valentine's Day, I clutched the hand of my lover with more passion, desperation and tenderness than I ever have before. The reason for this effusive outburst of affection on my part obviously had to do with the high caliber of acting from the two leads, Joshie Duhamel and Julianne Huff, both of whom should be awarded the extremely prestigious Blockbuster Entertainment Awards for 2013!The story is highly original and not sappy at all because this is a Nicky Sparks story, and we all know that Nicky Sparks is the most thought-provoking and ultra-serious author on Earth...ever. Huff plays a prostitute who has become fed up with love because all the men she dates just want her for sex, even though she just doesn't know why!! Joshie, though, is the handsome john who sees through all her hooking and sees her for what she really is: A kind-hearted sex worker with a heart of gold and a penchant for voting Democrat. A match made in Heaven shortly follows.Since this is a highly original and brainy movie, the climax comes when it's discovered that Huff's in a pinch that only Joshie can save her from. It turns out that her p/i/m/p wants to get back from her the Carl Jr.'s coupon that she stole from him, and he'll stop at nothing to get that deal that will get him a free Coke, free burger and free fries (with the purchase of a 10-piece chicken bucket, of course)!!I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that Joshie ends up saving Huff from her mean old p/i/m/p by explaining to him that Burger King offers better meal deals anyway, and that, therefore, he didn't need or want the Carl Jr.'s coupon anywho! The day is saved, as the p/i/m/p (turns out to be an Obama voter) leaves, thereby proving that Joshie saved the day! As his reward, Joshie gets sweet, sweet intercourse from Huff, which lasts for exactly 15, maybe 16 seconds. While watching that tender, tender love scene of passion, I'm not ashamed to admit that I experienced a lust emission myself.In short, please celebrate Valentine's Day the right way by enriching all the chocolate companies, greeting card companies and flower shops (all three entities invented the contrived holiday, by the way) with your hard-earned money. Then, snuggle close to your lover and watch Safe Haven until you become hungry and need to go to Carl Jr.'s for some TLC.",5,The Only Safe Haven That I Know Is the Magical Place Between Josh Duhamel's Brilliant Blue Eyes and His Manly Arms!,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,2845,"['Folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'second', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'even', 'medieval', 'times', 'rip-off', 'called', 'Tristan', 'Isolde', 'great', 'romance', 'tale', 'Nothing', 'poppycock', 'made', 'none', 'other', 'great', 'genius', 'romance', 'GGOR', 'Nicky', 'Sparks', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'anything', 'close', 'what', 'TRUE', 'romance', 'really', 'then', 'Safe', 'Haven', 'greatest', 'work', 'art', 'depicting', 'true', 'romance', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'now', 'available', 'VHS', 'laser', 'disc', 'When', 'saw', 'early', 'morning', 'today', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'clutched', 'hand', 'lover', 'more', 'passion', 'desperation', 'tenderness', 'ever', 'have', 'before', 'reason', 'effusive', 'outburst', 'affection', 'part', 'obviously', 'had', 'do', 'high', 'caliber', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'Joshie', 'Duhamel', 'Julianne', 'Huff', 'whom', 'should', 'be', 'awarded', 'extremely', 'prestigious', 'Blockbuster', 'Entertainment', 'Awards', '2013', 'story', 'highly', 'original', 'not', 'sappy', 'Nicky', 'Sparks', 'story', 'know', 'Nicky', 'Sparks', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'ultra-serious', 'author', 'Earth', 'ever', 'Huff', 'prostitute', 'who', 'become', 'fed', 'up', 'love', 'men', 'just', 'want', 'sex', 'even', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Joshie', 'though', 'handsome', 'john', 'who', 'hooking', 'what', 'really', 'kind-hearted', 'sex', 'worker', 'heart', 'gold', 'penchant', 'voting', 'Democrat', 'A', 'match', 'made', 'Heaven', 'shortly', 'follows.Since', 'highly', 'original', 'brainy', 'movie', 'climax', 'when', 'discovered', 'Huff', 'pinch', 'only', 'Joshie', 'can', 'save', 'out', 'p/i/m/p', 'get', 'back', 'Carl', 'Jr.', 'coupon', 'stole', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'deal', 'will', 'get', 'free', 'Coke', 'free', 'burger', 'free', 'fries', 'purchase', '10-piece', 'chicken', 'bucket', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Joshie', 'up', 'saving', 'Huff', 'mean', 'old', 'p/i/m/p', 'explaining', 'Burger', 'King', 'better', 'meal', 'deals', 'anyway', 'therefore', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'want', 'Carl', 'Jr.', 'coupon', 'anywho', 'day', 'saved', 'p/i/m/p', 'out', 'be', 'Obama', 'voter', 'thereby', 'proving', 'Joshie', 'saved', 'day', 'reward', 'Joshie', 'sweet', 'sweet', 'intercourse', 'Huff', 'exactly', '15', 'maybe', '16', 'seconds', 'watching', 'tender', 'tender', 'love', 'scene', 'passion', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'experienced', 'lust', 'emission', 'myself.In', 'short', 'please', 'celebrate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'right', 'way', 'enriching', 'chocolate', 'companies', 'greeting', 'card', 'companies', 'flower', 'shops', 'three', 'entities', 'invented', 'contrived', 'holiday', 'way', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'Then', 'snuggle', 'close', 'lover', 'watch', 'Safe', 'Haven', 'become', 'hungry', 'need', 'go', 'Carl', 'Jr.', 'TLC']",Safe Haven (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) [Bilingual]

It was based on a novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. Nicholas also penned The Notebook, Dear John and The Lucky One. It is also a drama, mixed with laughs, some thrills and intense character study.Katie  (Julianne Hough) leaves Boston abruptly for the small coastal community of Southport, North Carolina. She is fleeing from her abusive husband, who she thinks she may have killed in a massive fight before she took off.Her husband, Kevin Tierney (David Lyons) is a Boston cop, very much alive and intent in finding his spouse.Katie attempts to live quietly but sparks a friendship with Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel) the manager of a local convenience store. He is a single dad, trying to raise a daughter and son. He lost his wife to cancer a few years ago.The girl Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) loves the idea of having Katie around, the son Josh (Noah Lomax) not so much. This was Kirkland's big screen debut. The eight-year-old is a wonderful little actress, and one we'll certainly see more of.Safe Haven is reminiscent of Sleeping with the Enemy, so if you liked that, you'll love this.It was filmed primarily in Wilmington and Southport, North Carolina, with bits done in Louisiana.It's a film you can feel good about renting or buying. Sparks and his wife had donated ""close to $10 million"" to start a Christian, international, college-prep private school, The Epiphany School, which emphasizes travel and lifelong learning.",4,Safe Haven more  than just a chick flick,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,1561,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MississippiSafe', 'Haven', 'classified', 'American', 'romance', 'film', 'certainly', 'that', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'Nicholas', 'also', 'penned', 'Notebook', 'Dear', 'John', 'Lucky', 'One', 'also', 'drama', 'mixed', 'laughs', 'thrills', 'intense', 'character', 'study.Katie', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'Boston', 'abruptly', 'small', 'coastal', 'community', 'Southport', 'North', 'Carolina', 'fleeing', 'abusive', 'husband', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'massive', 'fight', 'took', 'off.Her', 'husband', 'Kevin', 'Tierney', 'David', 'Lyons', 'Boston', 'cop', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'intent', 'finding', 'spouse.Katie', 'attempts', 'live', 'quietly', 'friendship', 'Alex', 'Wheatley', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'manager', 'local', 'convenience', 'store', 'single', 'dad', 'trying', 'raise', 'daughter', 'son', 'lost', 'wife', 'cancer', 'few', 'years', 'ago.The', 'girl', 'Lexie', 'Mimi', 'Kirkland', 'idea', 'having', 'Katie', 'son', 'Josh', 'Noah', 'Lomax', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'Kirkland', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'eight-year-old', 'wonderful', 'little', 'actress', 'one', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'see', 'more', 'of.Safe', 'Haven', 'reminiscent', 'Sleeping', 'Enemy', 'so', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'love', 'this.It', 'was', 'filmed', 'primarily', 'Wilmington', 'Southport', 'North', 'Carolina', 'bits', 'done', 'Louisiana.It', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'good', 'renting', 'buying', 'Sparks', 'wife', 'had', 'donated', 'close', '10', 'million', 'start', 'Christian', 'international', 'college-prep', 'private', 'school', 'Epiphany', 'School', 'travel', 'lifelong', 'learning']",Safe Haven (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) [Bilingual]

A girl seems to be hiding.  From what or whom you are unsure.  Then, she finds a place to feel safe and starts to enjoy her new dwellings.  Throughout the movie you will learn about what she is afraid of and what happened to finally free her and make her run.  Then, there may just be something in the movie that will happen that makes you have this weird feeling in your gut.  I will not say anything though.The chemistry between the actor that plays the father and the actress that plays the girl is amazing.  They are so good at playing nervous, anxious people who are falling for one another.  You will come to like both of them and hope for good things to happen.  There is someone else in the movie as well.  A detective/cop.  His role in the movie is important.The kids that play the mans kids are great.  They are such good actors.  I am proud of them.  They never get in the way of anything that is going on.  You see them for the perfect amount of time.  In the time you see them you will understand their pain and their reasons for doing what they do.Another thing that I liked about this movie is the location.  It seems to have a small town feeling.  Some movies go all over the place.  But this movies was really in one place.  It let you feel safe.  Like you were at home and nothing could happen.  Very well done.This is a great movie for a man, women, or both to watch.  It really makes you thankful for those you have that you can love and who love you.

1606570,A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B00A7ZHDOO,JWink,"[11, 13]","Safe Haven is a movie about a young woman who is running from her past and lands in Southport, North Carolina where her bond with a widower forces her to confront the dark secret that haunts her.I know this is based on a novel but I am not familiar with that so I cant say how well it was translated from the book to the movie.  I do know that the author played a role as a producer so that should help with following the book.Thinking this was your typical chick type flick, I wasn't too excited about watching this movie but I decided to give it a chance after hearing good things and see what it was about.  The movie at times was a little slow moving but had some beautiful scenic shots of North Carolina.  The little girl that played the daughter also was a bright spot as she seemed to bring some cuteness to the movie as well.  I felt the ""bad guy"" (Played by David Lyons) in the movie could have been acted a bit better though and to me was the weak point.  I just felt that he didn't play very well the drunken jealous abusing husband and that it could have been done better and more believable.

She gets on a bus headed for Atlanta.  When it makes a stretch stop at the quiet water-front town of Southport, North Carolina, Katie gets out to stretch her legs and just doesn't get back on.  She soon gets a job at Ivan's Fish Shack (local restaurant) but she is obviously hiding from something and/or someone and her fears make her afraid to get close to people, at least at first. While Katie is trying to go on with her new life in the small town, the Boston police, at least one police captain, seems obsessed with finding her.  He obtains tapes of the busses and begins searching.  It's only a matter of time before. . .Meanwhile, she meets local widower Alex, a really nice guy (and handsome) with two young children.  Alex seems immediately attracted to Katie, and the dance begins.  Of course, as any good movie-viewer knows, whatever Katie is hiding has got to surface, cause that's just the way it is in movieland.This movie is part drama and part feel-good.  It has thrills, chills, danger, and love.  It is the story about a young woman who overcomes obstacles to become whole again.  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel had great screen chemistry.  The very very end was soooo cool, too.I absolutely loved this movie and plan to buy it when it becomes available for my collection.  As a side note, if you liked ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" with Julia Roberts, I believe you will like this movie as well for it's similarities.BTW--It actually does take place in Southport North Carolina.

While I have never read Safe Haven, I find myself longing to dive into the book now that I have seen this beautiful movie.Julianne is great as Katie/Erin a woman who is running from something. She finds herself in sun filled, North Caroline and she decides this is the place for a fresh new start.Alex played by Josh is a widower of two, a boy and girl who runs a convenience store down on the docks.As fate would have it these two beautiful people gravitate toward each other and make nice before Katie/Erin's past threatens to end what they have before it has even begun.This sweet story has so many loveable characters Julianne definitely holds her own as a female lead and who doesn't love Josh? But there were other great characters too, especially the two young actors playing Josh's family. Mimi Kirkland as Lexie Wheatley in her acting debut is simply adorable and Noah Lomax as Josh Wheatley are very sweet. I also love Roger, Red West who has an acting bio a mile long and absolutely loved Katie's only friend Jo played by Cobie Smulders.Ohhhhh yeah and I absolutely was in loving with the coloring of the movie. Very poetic, thought provoking and muted.

February 14 is known as a day for romance, and this year at the theater is no exception. Rated PG-13 for sexual and adult content, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria B recommends this film, even to those who are not fans of the romance genre, because it is ""unique and not cliche.""Safe HavenReviewed by Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticSafe Haven is surprisingly eerie for a romantic movie. I have never seen Julianne Hough play such an intense role before, and she is honest in her acting. She plays a distrusting woman in a new town looking to have no neighbors, friends or any emotional ties, but she forgets that southerners are strangely friendly. Her goal becomes more difficult.I love the style in which the movie is shot, flashing between the present to the past.  This movie follows a woman named Katie who runs away from home and from her husband who is stalking her. She takes a bus, in a disguise, to any town. When the bus stops for a pit stop, she decides that the sleepy and quaint little town she has stopped in is the one for her.Katie (Julianne Hough) has to start over with a new name, house and people.  First she gets a job at a local seafood shack and buys a new house. She stops at the local store for groceries and meets a charming little girl named Lexi (Mimi Kirkland), followed by her dad, Alex (Josh Duhamel), who coincidentally is the same guy that sold her coffee the first day in town. Neither of them at first admit it, but it is clear that there is an instant attraction. From then on, whenever Katie goes to the store she sees Lexie and meets her brother Josh (Noah Lomax) and flirts with Alex.  Katie tells all of her encounters with Alex to her one neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders), and Jo encourages the idea of Katie dating Alex. The closer Alex and Katie get, the more dangerous their relationship becomes.There is a twist when Alex, who is friends with the sheriff, sees a wanted for murder post with Katie's face on it. He confronts her and tells her to leave. To find out what happens next, you'll have to see it for yourself.I give this movie five out of five stars because this romantic movie is unique and not clich&eacute;. I recommend it for ages 13 and up or mature audiences, due to the sexual scenes and scenes of domestic and substance abuse. I am not a fan of romantic movies, but this one was the best I have seen. It even has an exciting twist that I never saw coming. I love this movie and will see it again.Video review may be found online at kids first dot org",5,"Romance and Unexpected Twists In ""Safe Haven""",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2648,"['romance', 'yes', 'unusual', 'twists', 'complex', 'story', 'line', 'new', 'film', 'Safe', 'Haven', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch', 'February', '14', 'known', 'day', 'romance', 'year', 'theater', 'exception', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'sexual', 'adult', 'content', 'KIDS', 'FIRST', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Victoria', 'B', 'film', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'romance', 'genre', 'unique', 'not', 'cliche', 'Safe', 'HavenReviewed', 'Victoria', 'B', 'KIDS', 'FIRST', 'Film', 'CriticSafe', 'Haven', 'surprisingly', 'eerie', 'romantic', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'play', 'intense', 'role', 'honest', 'acting', 'distrusting', 'woman', 'new', 'town', 'looking', 'have', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'emotional', 'ties', 'southerners', 'are', 'strangely', 'friendly', 'goal', 'more', 'difficult.I', 'style', 'movie', 'shot', 'flashing', 'present', 'past', 'movie', 'woman', 'named', 'Katie', 'who', 'away', 'home', 'husband', 'who', 'stalking', 'bus', 'disguise', 'town', 'When', 'bus', 'pit', 'stop', 'sleepy', 'quaint', 'little', 'town', 'stopped', 'one', 'her.Katie', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'start', 'new', 'name', 'house', 'people', 'First', 'job', 'local', 'seafood', 'shack', 'new', 'house', 'local', 'store', 'groceries', 'charming', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Lexi', 'Mimi', 'Kirkland', 'followed', 'dad', 'Alex', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'same', 'guy', 'sold', 'coffee', 'first', 'day', 'town', 'first', 'admit', 'clear', 'instant', 'attraction', 'then', 'whenever', 'Katie', 'store', 'Lexie', 'brother', 'Josh', 'Noah', 'Lomax', 'Alex', 'Katie', 'encounters', 'Alex', 'one', 'neighbor', 'Jo', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'Jo', 'idea', 'Katie', 'dating', 'Alex', 'closer', 'Alex', 'Katie', 'get', 'more', 'dangerous', 'relationship', 'twist', 'when', 'Alex', 'who', 'friends', 'sheriff', 'wanted', 'murder', 'post', 'Katie', 'face', 'leave', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'yourself.I', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'five', 'stars', 'romantic', 'movie', 'unique', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'recommend', '13', 'up', 'mature', 'audiences', 'due', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'domestic', 'substance', 'abuse', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'romantic', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'exciting', 'twist', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'again.Video', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'online', 'kids', 'first', 'dot', 'org']",Safe Haven (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) [Bilingual]

Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2As ""Safe Haven"" opens, young Erin Tierney (Julianne Hough)  is seen racing hysterically out of her suburban home, either the victim or the perpetrator of some terrible crime. She thereupon flees to a town in North Carolina so bucolic that one half expects the Waltons to come traipsing down the street at any moment bearing freshly-baked blueberry pies. Even though she's colored her hair and changed her name to Katie and is constantly looking over her shoulder for fear of exposure, Erin begins to make friends and establish connections in this idyllic locale - this despite the fact that she's being hunted by a tenacious and determined Boston detective (David Lyons) who refuses to give up the pursuit even when the trail appears to have gone cold.For all its good intentions and lip service to reality, ""Safe Haven' is never able to shake its dime-novel aura and taint - not a surprise given that it is based on a work by Nicholas Sparks, that modern-day purveyor of romantic triteness best known, to movie audiences at least, for ""The Notebook."" The distraught woman just happens to land in a town that just happens to have a dreamy general store owner (Josh Duhamel) who just happens to be a widower with two young children, one an adorable little girl (and Mimi Kirkland really IS adorable) and the other a son who's having trouble coping with the loss of his mother who just happened to be in the flower of her womanhood when she died. And it all comes to a head in an absurdly melodramatic flourish at a Fourth of July fireworks celebration no less. If my tone sounds a mite cynical, it's probably because there is some real acting talent here and one hates to see it thrown away on such tripe.

The latest proof of this has arrived in the form of Safe Haven.In Safe Haven, Katie (Julianne Hough) is introduced frantically attempting to escape being chased down by a Boston Police Officer (David Lyons).  The mystery of the film revolves around why this chase is taking place, but of course the point of this film revolves around her somehow ending up in North Carolina with a handsome man.  ""Write about where you know"" has got to be humorously posted on some wall in Nicholas Sparks's North Carolina home.Katie does end up in the aforementioned state in the tiny town of Sea Port.  Sea Port offers all of the necessities for Sparks to work his magic: quiet streams for canoeing, beaches with virtually no one around, general stores, rusticity, no technology, one big event (that apparently draws over 100,000 people in for a day), and a laissez faire attitude.  Predictability ensues, but not to an offensive degree.This is the eighth Sparks novel to get the cinematic treatment, but it may as well be the eightieth.  It rarely rises above standard TV movie production quality and offers nothing unexpected to the viewers.  What it can cash in on is the likability and chemistry between its main co-stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.  I suspect that this is the main reason the film got green-lit at all.  An attempt, albeit a failed one, at adding some edge accomplishes little more than The Lucky One was able to accomplish last year.  What is surprising is that the novel does have some edgy back-story, but director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m and screenwriter Dana Stevens chose to downplay, simplify, and blatantly avoid these opportunities preventing this film from elevating itself above the standard warmed over genre-film that it became.  Formulas exist because they provide the framework for pleasing an audience, but unfortunately they grow tremendously stale and unsatisfying if they are not tweaked and modified from time to time.  This is a lazy movie from start to finish, and it is an apparent Valentine's Day cash-grab at a movie hungry audience looking for a romantic film during a barren movie season.  Like most films that receive reviews like this, it will be very comforting to those who go in knowing what to expect and unappealing to everyone else.  How do you grade a film like this?

Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.&#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance &#8220;Dear John&#8221; a few years ago), &#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.For &#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; attempts to be a &#8220;mystery&#8221; &#8211; in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie&#8217;s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it.

1606726,A5A2QE6NECFR5,B00A7ZHDOO,William E. Adams,"[1, 2]","I was a domestic violence counselor for 24 years, so I know a little bit about the world of abusers and victims. I also know it is almost impossible to run away and permanently hide from a person determined to hurt you. I've seen lots of movies about family violence and read a dozen or more non-fiction treatments of the problem. Therefore, movies such as ""The Burning Bed"" and ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" and ""Safe Haven"" sometimes are problematic for me. In real life, the women in danger are not  usually movie-star attractive, and don't have professional writers giving them good job skills or irresistable personalities. The male abusers are less often respected professionals and more often substance-abusing low self-esteem marginal achievers. Are there exceptions to both of my depictions? Of course. But in domestic violence films, reality is simplified for the sake of a two-hour tale. And as a two-hour tale of a frightened woman's bid to escape an obsessed bully, ""Safe Haven"" is enjoyable and tense. No masterpiece, not the finest script ever penned, not the most superb acting you'll see this year, but not a waste of time. The twist ending will seem hokey five minutes after the credits roll, but for me, when it was revealed, it not only worked, it was the best thing about the whole production. I ""retired"" from the world of domestic violence prevention more than four years ago, and am glad to be distanced from the ugliness and tragedies of that problem. It's damned hard to reform the abusers, and surprisingly difficult to help victims make permanent, safer, healthier changes and choices. If a movie like this helps one victim decide to get away sensibly, or one abuser elect to get professional help before he ends up in jail or dead, it was worth making and watching.",3,Maybe another half star for an ending that pleasantly surprised me...,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1790,"['was', 'domestic', 'violence', 'counselor', '24', 'years', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'world', 'abusers', 'victims', 'also', 'know', 'almost', 'impossible', 'run', 'away', 'permanently', 'hide', 'person', 'determined', 'hurt', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'movies', 'family', 'violence', 'read', 'dozen', 'more', 'non-fiction', 'treatments', 'problem', 'Therefore', 'movies', 'such', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'Sleeping', 'Enemy', 'Safe', 'Haven', 'sometimes', 'are', 'problematic', 'real', 'life', 'women', 'danger', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'movie-star', 'attractive', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'professional', 'writers', 'giving', 'good', 'job', 'skills', 'irresistable', 'personalities', 'male', 'abusers', 'are', 'less', 'often', 'respected', 'professionals', 'more', 'often', 'substance-abusing', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'marginal', 'achievers', 'Are', 'there', 'exceptions', 'depictions', 'course', 'domestic', 'violence', 'films', 'reality', 'simplified', 'sake', 'two-hour', 'tale', 'two-hour', 'tale', 'frightened', 'woman', 'bid', 'escape', 'obsessed', 'bully', 'Safe', 'Haven', 'enjoyable', 'tense', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'finest', 'script', 'ever', 'penned', 'not', 'most', 'superb', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'twist', 'ending', 'will', 'seem', 'hokey', 'five', 'minutes', 'credits', 'roll', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'not', 'only', 'worked', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'whole', 'production', 'retired', 'world', 'domestic', 'violence', 'prevention', 'more', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'am', 'glad', 'be', 'distanced', 'ugliness', 'tragedies', 'problem', 'damned', 'hard', 'reform', 'abusers', 'surprisingly', 'difficult', 'help', 'victims', 'make', 'permanent', 'safer', 'healthier', 'changes', 'choices', 'movie', 'one', 'victim', 'decide', 'get', 'away', 'sensibly', 'one', 'abuser', 'elect', 'get', 'professional', 'help', 'up', 'jail', 'dead', 'was', 'worth', 'making', 'watching']",Safe Haven (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) [Bilingual]
