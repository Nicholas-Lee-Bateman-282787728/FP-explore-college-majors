It's just a totally amateurish attempt at a gay themed movie.  There are so many lapses of logic, so many stupid, unreal events, that it is quickly apparent this movie is made to laugh at.  It would be incredulous to me to think the writer, director, producer, lead star (yes, all the same guy!) meant for this to be taken seriously.  The distributors misled us, though, with the picture of the hot guy on the cover of the dvd, appealing to our prurient desires. The picture is the best thing about this product, and except for some unintended comedy, it's the only thing of value in this movie! It's all downhill after that.Kudos to all the other reviewers here on Amazon.  I laughed my a** off at their many virulent comments, by far more entertaining than anything I saw in the film.

That may cover a lot of ground, but the movie makes you wonder how a film can be this bad by accident.  There are home movies with more talent and craftsmanship than this turd on a disk.  I wish I could sue the filmmakers to get back the 85 minutes of my life I wasted on it.If I listed everything wrong with the film, it would use up all the available space.  But I'll give the basics.  The actors speak as though remote-controlled from outer space.  The photography is sometimes so out of focus it induces headaches.  The sequence of events is so choppy, it seems to have been edited with garden shears and chewing gum.  And the location work is laughable.  When the couple in the title arrive in Vermont to marry, they are surrounded by palm trees and tropical plants.Now the story--you won't know whether to laugh or cringe.  It concerns a gay couple (Ben and Arthur) who want to get legally married.  When Arthur's Chirstian fundamentalist brother (with bleached hair, tattoos, and garish apartment) learns of this, he and his priest decide to murder them.  Just like real life!  Also Ben's crazy estranged wife enters the mix.  At one point, they struggle over a gun.  They wrestle for it in a polite, obliging way, like a brother and sister playfully roughhousing.Another point is why an actor as unattractive and untalented as Sam Mraovich (who plays Arthur) is the star.  It's because he wrote, produced, and directed the film.  What's mind boggling is that he thinks he's a hottie.  At one point during the film, he applies for a job as a stripper and dances like a disabled war veteran.  And the club owner propositions him!  And he does the only nude scene in the film.  He does provoke some sympathy, as he resembles a beached baby whale, but it's still an embarrassing spectacle.Every second of this film is so false and incompetent, it's like watching something from antoher planet.  Why was it even filmed at all?  Maybe Sam Mraovich thought this was the only way he could romance an attractive guy without running up his credit card.",1,Amazingly bad,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,2173,"['call', 'worst', 'gay', 'film', 'ever', 'act', 'charity', 'list', 'worst', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'include', 'Ben', 'Arthur', 'may', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'movie', 'wonder', 'how', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'accident', 'are', 'home', 'movies', 'more', 'talent', 'craftsmanship', 'turd', 'disk', 'wish', 'could', 'sue', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'back', '85', 'minutes', 'life', 'wasted', 'it.If', 'listed', 'everything', 'wrong', 'film', 'would', 'use', 'up', 'available', 'space', ""'ll"", 'give', 'basics', 'actors', 'speak', 'remote-controlled', 'outer', 'space', 'photography', 'sometimes', 'so', 'focus', 'headaches', 'sequence', 'events', 'so', 'choppy', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'garden', 'shears', 'chewing', 'gum', 'location', 'work', 'laughable', 'When', 'couple', 'title', 'arrive', 'Vermont', 'marry', 'are', 'surrounded', 'palm', 'trees', 'tropical', 'plants.Now', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'cringe', 'gay', 'couple', 'Ben', 'Arthur', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'legally', 'married', 'When', 'Arthur', 'Chirstian', 'fundamentalist', 'brother', 'bleached', 'hair', 'tattoos', 'garish', 'apartment', 'priest', 'decide', 'murder', 'Just', 'real', 'life', 'Also', 'Ben', 'crazy', 'estranged', 'wife', 'enters', 'mix', 'one', 'point', 'struggle', 'gun', 'wrestle', 'polite', 'obliging', 'way', 'brother', 'sister', 'playfully', 'roughhousing.Another', 'point', 'why', 'actor', 'unattractive', 'untalented', 'Sam', 'Mraovich', 'who', 'Arthur', 'star', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'film', 'What', 'mind', 'boggling', 'hottie', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'job', 'stripper', 'dances', 'disabled', 'war', 'veteran', 'club', 'owner', 'propositions', 'only', 'nude', 'scene', 'film', 'provoke', 'sympathy', 'beached', 'baby', 'whale', 'still', 'embarrassing', 'spectacle.Every', 'second', 'film', 'so', 'false', 'incompetent', 'watching', 'something', 'antoher', 'planet', 'Why', 'was', 'even', 'filmed', 'Maybe', 'Sam', 'Mraovich', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'romance', 'attractive', 'guy', 'running', 'up', 'credit', 'card']",N/A
810945,A21UUO3LE3SDGD,B0001ME5DU,CWC,"[10, 10]","I bought this DVD given the latest events and debate of gay marriage that have transpired in California and the nation this year. Ben and Arthur, in a three year partnership decide to get married and are constantly thwarted by Arthur's religious, crazed brother. Given a rapidly changing situation, the movie is already a bit dated given the options now available to this couple. With all due respect to Sam Mraovich, who directed, produced, casted, and screen-played this flick, I hope he can make a giant leap forward and more satisfying in his next effort. ""LOW budget"" is the theme throughout this entire film. It's like watching a stretched out version of the ""in-between"" dialogue scenes in a low-budget porn film. (heh heh) This movie is filled with bad acting, bad dialogue, cheap sets, bad lighting, bad editing, and bad direction. All the actors seem to be ""reading"" their dialogue throughout the movie instead of actually acting out their characters. I felt little to no chemistry between Ben and Arthur. Ben's sculpted looks and body verses Arthur's... well... just the opposite... seem mismatched as a couple. The plot just slowly disintegrates to the point where it just gets laughable. Every time Ben or Arthur open the door to their apartment, something terrible happens. I started to wonder why they just didn't stop opening the door or at least ask who was there. Of course, that would have ""ended"" the movie, which would have at least put the viewers out of their misery!The plot description is also a bit misleading. It states that Arthur is pushing the idea of marriage and Ben is content to keep things ""status quo"" with no marriage license. Ben, in the film, however, is just as eager- and more so- to get married than Arthur is. The ending of the movie, which turns very dark, leaves the viewer with no satisfaction. A different ending might have helped to save this movie a bit.The plot and characters become more farceable as the movie progresses. Couple this with the bad acting, bad everything!, I was just chuckling my way through most of the film. Though this film wasn't met to be a comedy, Mr. Mraovich would have done himself, the actors, and the viewers more justice had he turned this screenplay into a full-pledged comedy.Con a friend into buying this flick if you really want to see it. If I can say one thing positive about ""Ben & Arthur,"" it would be that this film is so bad, it just might become a cult classic. My real rating for this movie would be a ""minus"" five stars!",1,Ben & Arthur= Boring and Awful,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,2513,"['bought', 'DVD', 'given', 'latest', 'events', 'debate', 'gay', 'marriage', 'have', 'transpired', 'California', 'nation', 'year', 'Ben', 'Arthur', 'three', 'year', 'partnership', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'are', 'constantly', 'thwarted', 'Arthur', 'religious', 'crazed', 'brother', 'Given', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'situation', 'movie', 'already', 'bit', 'dated', 'given', 'options', 'now', 'available', 'couple', 'due', 'respect', 'Sam', 'Mraovich', 'who', 'directed', 'produced', 'casted', 'screen-played', 'flick', 'hope', 'can', 'make', 'giant', 'leap', 'forward', 'more', 'satisfying', 'next', 'effort', 'LOW', 'budget', 'theme', 'entire', 'film', 'watching', 'stretched', 'version', 'in-between', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'low-budget', 'porn', 'film', 'heh', 'heh', 'movie', 'filled', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'cheap', 'sets', 'bad', 'lighting', 'bad', 'editing', 'bad', 'direction', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'reading', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'instead', 'actually', 'acting', 'out', 'characters', 'felt', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Ben', 'Arthur', 'Ben', 'sculpted', 'looks', 'body', 'verses', 'Arthur', 'well', 'just', 'opposite', 'seem', 'mismatched', 'couple', 'plot', 'just', 'slowly', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'laughable', 'time', 'Ben', 'Arthur', 'open', 'door', 'apartment', 'something', 'terrible', 'happens', 'started', 'wonder', 'why', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'opening', 'door', 'least', 'ask', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'put', 'viewers', 'misery', 'plot', 'description', 'also', 'bit', 'misleading', 'Arthur', 'pushing', 'idea', 'marriage', 'Ben', 'content', 'keep', 'things', 'status', 'quo', 'marriage', 'license', 'Ben', 'film', 'however', 'just', 'eager-', 'more', 'so-', 'get', 'married', 'Arthur', 'ending', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'viewer', 'satisfaction', 'different', 'ending', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'save', 'movie', 'bit.The', 'plot', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'farceable', 'movie', 'Couple', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'chuckling', 'way', 'most', 'film', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'met', 'be', 'comedy', 'Mr.', 'Mraovich', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'actors', 'viewers', 'more', 'justice', 'had', 'turned', 'screenplay', 'full-pledged', 'comedy.Con', 'friend', 'buying', 'flick', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'positive', 'Ben', 'Arthur', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'might', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'real', 'rating', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'minus', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
810946,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B0001ME5DU,Endless Kitchen,"[3, 3]","Have you seenThe Roomand wondered what it might be like if Lisa was a man and her future husband was a doughy whiner as opposed to an alien named Johnny? Well, this film is for you! Seriously, though, this film is a piece of work and not in a good way. The story follows Arthur Sailes(portrayed by writer, director, casting agent, editor, music composer and producer Sam Mraovich) who is excited after his boyfriend, Ben Sheets(played by Jamie Brett Gabel), informs him that same-sex marriage is now legally recognized in Vermont. A few subplots emerge about Arthur trying to find a new job and Ben's former flame who does not take rejection well, but the central plot begins as the couple attempts to get their marriage in Vermont recognized in California as Arthur's fanatical, metro-sexual fundamentalism brother, Victor (played by Michael Haboush), tries to thwart their relationship.Where do I even begin? The script is a joke. Do not think that the movie is worth watching because the message it is attempting to make (but failing even at that) is admirable. There are plenty of movie with gay themes, characters or generally non-heterosexuality that are infinitely better than this waste of space. The dialogue, story and characters are as though a twelve year-old wrote this script. The grammar is improper, the motives and actions of characters are illogical (e.g., someone with a nursing degree washing dishes for minimum wage). At times, this movie tries to add humor (such as a foul-mouth priest) but it falls flat like a graham cracker being slammed onto a table. There is also a grocery list USED BY ADULTS that has to be seen to be believed. Mravoich also misunderstands Christianity as he mixes concepts like karma and bodily energies in with Christianity. I am not Christian but the ridiculous portrayal in this film is offensive, although the sheer stupidity of this angle may lessen the offensiveness; I do not know. Also, when this film was made, civil unions were legal in Vermont, not same-sex marriage yet. This (and so many other errors) is just stupid; not a simple misunderstanding that leads to unintentional humor.What about the cinematography, graphics and special effects? This film looks like it was shot with a 1980s camcorder with very poor lighting. The movie looks murky and ugly from a visual standpoint; at least ""The Room"" uses real film cameras to shoot many unneeded interlude shots of scenic San Francisco. The opening titles and other special effects have dollar store quality and the titles were made in Microsoft Paint in a minute or two. There are also a lot of nonsensical shots such as huge amounts of smoke coming out of a gun that has just been shot. Sam Mraovich thinks movie-viewers are idiots but we know that there are no passengers on Fed-Ex planes or that palm trees do not grow in Vermont.The acting is consistently bad; nobody stands out as having any talent or even effort or just having fun while in front of the camera. At the wedding, Ben and Arthur kiss but it is incredibly obvious that they are avoiding even making contact. I know that actors who are not attracted to each other (due to looks, sexuality or any reason) are probably uncomfortable fake-kissing on screen but this is ridiculous. To make matters worse, the music in the film is unoriginal and unrelated usage of public domain performances of public domain compositions (the film inexplicably opens with a ho-hum version ofThe Entertainer) and original but cheap and lousy techno music. Early in the film, after one character says, ""Let's go,"" a montage complete with a song with those two words as the sole lyric ensues. This film has all the atmosphere, subtleness and poignancy of a caveman grunting.Even the sets and costumes are so poorly done they border on the idiotic. The head of the church does not have a desk but a fold out table. Arthur goes to a job interview (granted, it was at a strip club) wearing a polo shirt, loud and colorful shorts and sandals...way to dress realistically for a job interview. The cafe Ben and Arthur work at looks a lot like a miserable and depressing cafeteria. The church features poorly constructed crucifixes made out of cardboard. The flowers left for Ben are obviously fake and the card is a piece of office paper.Overall, this is an awful excuse for a movie but it might provide some amusement and ironic fun as the ineptitude of Mraovich itself is worth a few laughs! This is closer to the crappiness ofBirdemic: Shock and Terrorthan the ultra-bizarre and very riff-ableThe Room.

810947,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B0001ME5DU,James Morris,"[6, 6]","Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it.  This is my second (and I assure you it will absolutely be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video.  As far as I am concerned, this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off.  I do not make this observation lightly - I am a major collector of videos, gay and mainstream, and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life.  Period.  My collection boasts over 1,400 films (91% on them on DVD) and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed.  I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film.  Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise -  Aimee & Jaguar, It's In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally.  So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS.  That film was pretty bad, but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR, it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND.So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR?  Plenty!  To begin with, the ""plot"" such as it was, was totally ridiculous.  This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right - we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay, but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to ""save their souls"" (like this even makes sense).  Many scenes are totally incoherent and disconnected from the ""plot"", and several plot points reflect no logic, follow-up or connection to the story.  Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides, and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to image how anybody in this film got hired.  The characters that are supposed to be straight are almost without exception played by actors who are clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting.  This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever, and the distributors of this film should be ashamed of themselves.  The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q CONECTION purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that Ben and Arthur has a soundtrack with clear dialogue.  Hardly a distinction, since the writing is so poor that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is.

Considering the seductive, well-built man on the cover of this DVD, one might expect a great story inside -- or at least a sexy one with enough pretty people to make even a bad story palatable.Not so.  There are only two attractive men in this hilariously inept film.  One is Jamie Brett Gabel as Ben, who graces the cover.  The other is exquisite Arthur Huber who plays a private investigator.  The brevity of his appearance in the film is certainly one of its two greatest crimes.The story sounds interesting:  a gay couple wants to marry but are thwarted by virulent, violent, homophobic christians, but the incompetence of the script, acting, and film design thwart the production of a promising film.  A glance at the credits indicates that the director's entire family helped create and - pun intended - execute this film.The script is so disjointed it's hard to keep straight, but here's the gist: Ben and Arthur are going to Hawaii to get hitched after living together for three years. Ben chooses this moment to announce that he is already married - and to a woman.  She is, like so many in this film, completely insane and comes to their apartment with a gun.  Arthur's 'christian' brother, equally insane and well-armed, takes rather immoderate steps to prevent this blasphemous marriage - like murder and mayhem.  There may be more gunplay in this little West Hollywood drama than at the OK Corral.  Every time the boys open their door (strangely, they never ask who's there) a gun-toting psychotic appears, but no amount of shooting in their apartment seems to get a rise from neighbors or police.There is added confusion due to the locations.  Ben and Arthur eventually settle on Vermont for their long-awaited nuptials, but palm trees figure prominently in the landscape when their plane lands, and in the lush tropical garden where the ceremony finally takes places.If you find yourself wondering about the whimsical miscasting of Arthur - a tubby little nebbish who wears socks and sandals with bermuda shorts and runs like an unathletic girl -  remember he's the writer/director.  The film's other great crime is that Arthur is the only man to be undressed for any length of time.One burning question remains:  why beautiful, brawny Ben would be living with, ever-apologizing to, much less marrying a peevish nerd who, when chided for causing Ben's bike to be stolen, flounces out of the room, plops himself face-down on the bed, and sulks.
