1213728,A35AZL7RP2ZP6E,B001L67A46,"Akhenatonio ""Akhenatonio""","[4, 6]","First of all, this is not a woman bashing movie.  This movie seeks to highlight certain aspects of the Black Male / Black Female relationship dynamic that may be broken and offers constructive ways of fixing it; constructive criticism, meant to strengthen relationships, and help both men and women make better decisions toward their futures together (or apart).Men, watch it with your woman if you find that she is:1. Arguing with you constantly.2. Listening or talking to her friends about what you do or don't do.3. Tearing you down in front of your children.4. Taking for granted the kind of man you are (that being a good man).5. Angry at you for no fault of your own.6. Crazy.Women, watch it with your man if you find that he:1. Leaves the room when you have something to say.2. Leaves for work early.3. Comes home late.4. Crazy.Hopefully you don't have all of the above problems, and maybe you don't have any, but this docu-drama is a tool to help, not hinder your relationship.  If you don't have the problems portrayed here, then great.  If you do have some of these problems, here's a way to put them on the table and do something about them before your relationship becomes caustic.This movie does have some downfalls however, which is why it loses a few points (3.5 out of 5 stars).  Many of the commentaries are rather lewd and unnecessary.  The film could be shortened, by taking out a lot of the material that doesn't need to be there.  Some of the outlandish comments cause the movie to have less of an impact on some of it's audience than it would have. The sporadic sequences of drama are also very short, and spaced too far apart.  I would love to see many of the sequences combined, and expanded, and limit the comments to only a few minutes. In all, it still seeks to provide information to strengthen the bonds of the African-American couple community, and succeeds in doing so in spite of it's unyielding use of opinions.In conclusion, don't just watch the film because you have the aforementioned issues, watch the film because you are proactive, and don't want them.",4,A Good Way to Start a Dialogue with your Significant Other Without Saying a Word,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2091,"['First', 'all', 'not', 'woman', 'bashing', 'movie', 'movie', 'highlight', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Black', 'Male', '/', 'Black', 'Female', 'relationship', 'may', 'be', 'broken', 'constructive', 'ways', 'fixing', 'constructive', 'criticism', 'meant', 'strengthen', 'relationships', 'help', 'men', 'women', 'make', 'better', 'decisions', 'futures', 'together', 'apart', '.Men', 'watch', 'woman', 'find', 'Arguing', 'constantly.2', 'Listening', 'talking', 'friends', 'what', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'do.3', 'Tearing', 'down', 'front', 'children.4', 'Taking', 'granted', 'kind', 'man', 'are', 'being', 'good', 'man', '.5', 'Angry', 'fault', 'own.6', 'Crazy.Women', 'watch', 'man', 'find', 'he:1', 'room', 'when', 'have', 'something', 'say.2', 'Leaves', 'work', 'early.3', 'Comes', 'home', 'late.4', 'Crazy.Hopefully', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'above', 'problems', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'docu-drama', 'tool', 'help', 'not', 'hinder', 'relationship', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'portrayed', 'here', 'then', 'great', 'do', 'have', 'problems', 'here', 'way', 'put', 'table', 'do', 'something', 'relationship', 'caustic.This', 'movie', 'have', 'downfalls', 'however', 'why', 'few', 'points', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'Many', 'commentaries', 'are', 'rather', 'lewd', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'shortened', 'taking', 'out', 'lot', 'material', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'outlandish', 'comments', 'cause', 'movie', 'have', 'less', 'impact', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'sporadic', 'sequences', 'drama', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'short', 'spaced', 'too', 'far', 'apart', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'many', 'sequences', 'combined', 'expanded', 'limit', 'comments', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'still', 'provide', 'information', 'strengthen', 'bonds', 'African-American', 'couple', 'community', 'doing', 'so', 'spite', 'unyielding', 'use', 'opinions.In', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'film', 'have', 'aforementioned', 'issues', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'proactive', 'do', ""n't"", 'want']",Diary of a Tired Black Man

The dialogue between James and Tonya was exceptional.  It painted a vivid picture of what really takes place in some relationships.  Some of the people's opinions were truly on point. While others left no question as to why they were still single. Bottom line is that you can't bring old baggage into new relationships & expect them to work.

1213734,A1GA996JHP23Y3,B001L67A46,Douglas Maclean,"[2, 4]","Documentaries are a very special branch of the art of cinema. It's purpose can range from entertainment to instruction usually based on some true events or controversial subject. The documentary can put you in the middle of history or show you the lives of regular people that otherwise you would never be aware of. The genre grew out of the old theatrical newsreels. Back in the day long before television took hold of almost every home in the country the people would go to the movie houses and stay for the entire evening. During that time you would get to watch a feature film, a secondary flick, a few cartoons and a newsreel. This was the way that facts and opinions were expressed and lead directly to a lengthier version that we call the documentary. Now it is one of the only genre to get its own category in many award shows including the much lauded Academy Awards; the genre is that special and different. Over time the documentary would take on many varied forms. Some documentary film makers keep a distance from their subject. Others insert themselves directly in the action. It may seem that the format has become routine and some may say even hackney but there is hope in the horizon. Independent film maker Tim Alexander has come up with an extremely fresh and novel approach to this type of film with his work `Diary of a Tired Black Man'. He uses professional actors to play out a situation to invoke an emotional response in his audience. Many documentaries have used actors for reenactments of scenes that occurred in history but this movie combines the documentary with the comedy drama with stunning results. The uniqueness of this film does not stop with its construction and presentation. The marketing involved a model that will certainly become heavily used as time goes on. A three minute clip was posted on the internet and soon made its way around the world. This served to tease the viewers and greatly increase the anticipation for the fill film. The film had some showings in various Indy film festivals but its wide release will be through its DVD premiere handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment. They have always managed to locate the little gems out there in the independent film world and bring them into the house of movie buffs everywhere.This is the first film for Tim Alexander and like many new film makers has taken on more than one hat for the production. He is a true renaissance man capable of handing just about every job function needed in a film crew. It is not unusual for one person to take on writing, direction and production but that is only the tip of the iceberg for Alexander. He wrote the musical score, designed the sets, handled the makeup, wardrobe and worked the camera. It isn't mentioned in the credits but I would be surprised if he also cooked and served at the craft service table. To say this was an ambitious undertaking for Alexander would be a gross underestimation and disservice to the man. What is most amazing is this was his initial foray into all these jobs. If you looked at his resume with all these jobs on a single film you most likely wouldn't believe it at all. The most incredible thing is the fact that Alexander wildly succeeds in each of these functions; he is a one man film school. Needless to say this movie is a work of love for him. This is something that jumps off the screen and pulls the audience in; the sheer love for cinema that Alexander possesses. He certainly had help with crafting this film but this is completely his project.As the title of the film lets on this movie focuses on relationships in the African American community. While the viewpoints are specific to this portion of our society the issues at the heart of the film are universal in nature. No matter what ethnic group you happen to belong to themes such as passion, love, hate and revenge are part of your emotional makeup. The movie examines the difficulty between black men and women in maintaining a relationship. It does touch on some of the unique and very specific circumstances, history and obstacles that face the African Americans but can be translated to one degree or another to anyone. It treads the fine line between being so general as to lose its impact and being overly critical of a single group. This is a raw and at times an emotionally draining film to watch. There is purity to the way the actors let loose on each other that are captivating even if painful at times to view. Alexander certainly knew that he was going to stir up a hornet's nest with the release of this movie. Members of the black community are sure to be divided with what they take away from viewing this film. The part of the focus that is less universal in the most important to the production in many ways. Alexander wanted to expose the effects of tradition, media expectation and prejudice on the black relationship. While all groups have their own variations and will be able to use that to appreciate the film it is targeted and acts as magnifying glass to bring all the harsh details to light. It is this juxtaposition of the highly specific to the general that makes this a brilliant work.The film stars Jimmy Jean-Louis who plays the mind bending superhero Haitian on the NBC television series `Heroes'. Here he portrays James, a black man who is just trying to navigate the murky waters of relationships. The first shot of him is James sitting back having a cup of coffee as he reads an entry from the titular diary. In the time in point he went to pick up his daughter from the home of his ex-wife, Tanya (Paula Lema). Also there, however, were Tanya's three friends. The big mistake that James made in the eyes of his ex and her friends was to show up with a white woman. This is shown in the three minute clip presented here window box for effect. As Tanya meets James at the door the attack immediately escalates. She is resentful not only that he dare to bring another woman to pick up his daughter but the fact that she is white is too much. Tanya taunts him saying that he couldn't find a black woman who would lay back ad let him walk all over her. James does try to keep his composure throughout the heated exchange as the friends begin to chime in with their own sharp barbs. James does point out a bit of possible hypocrisy since one of Tanya's friends is dating a white man. They twist that around on James in short order.The film stays true to the documentary style throughout. It is gritty and realistic with a power to it that is amazing. Some may argue that this is just another drama but it is far more. It is a documentary in the sense that it takes a real situation and presents it through the perception of the film maker. While the characters may be portrayed by actors and extremely talented ones at that, there is a reality here that is rarely if ever caught in a standard film. This is an important piece of cinema and one that should not be missed.",4,A novel and great film,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,6945,"['Documentaries', 'are', 'very', 'special', 'branch', 'art',

1213736,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001L67A46,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 9]","Before I begin, I am always proud to say I am Jewish. I am equally proud to be half black (on Pop's side). He was some kind of black of Jewish descent (I'm positive his ancestors were Caribbean) and Mama was Sephardic Jewish. They were both born and raised in Mexico. Growing up was not easy for me, mainly because I am so pale and so was my mother. My folks were traditionalists, so Mama was subservient to Pop. In return, he treated her like the center of his universe.Sounds made-up, doesn't it?With that in mind: this 2009 offering was as entertaining as it was enlightening. It is an oddly paced film, however; I say oddly because it is a documentary that has feedback on short fictional film bits. The last time I saw that type of thing was in Sociology 101. Nevertheless, I liked it a great deal.Produced and directed by Tim Alexander, and based on a three-minute internet video Alexander made, DIARY OF A TIRED BLACK MAN is tempting to compare to Tyler Perry's DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN. Perry's Mable ""Madea"" Simmons, I suppose, is the quintessential mad black woman. Alexander, in his DIARY, explores the tired black man...tired of the angry black woman.Interspersed by vignette short films featuring James the Caribbean architect (a gorgeous Jimmy Jean-Louis) and his horrible shrew of a wife Tonya the B**** (an equally lovely Paula Lema), this film consists entirely of Alexander's interviews with dozens of folks commenting on the film shorts.The incisive thing about this film is that every single commentator has something profound to say about the relationships in the black community. I was so happy, so thrilled in fact, to hear so many black people saying, ""This is a people problem, not a racial problem or a black problem."" Amen!In the little fictional vignettes, James is a loving, sweet and upstanding man. Tonya is the Queen of the Witches, and eventually fills her time thinking of ways to torment poor James. With two children and a busy life, James divorces Tonya yet manages to get a bigger house and a nice girl. This turn of fortune for James ends up eliciting confusion from many of the interviewees. Also, some of the interviewed men said they would never be as nice as James was to his ex-wife.By this time in the film, I was mostly bored with the fictional little vignette films. I would have preferred Alexander making a far more reasonable and professional documentary. 100% documentary. Still, his approach is unique in cinema and it drives its points home. Though I was a bit angered myself by Alexander's insistence on creating a new syndrome (Angry Black Woman Syndrome) and his apparent though semi-hidden vindictiveness toward black women, he does have a point.Also, Alexander appears race-obsessed. I can't tell how this fits into his psyche, but it points to the evil perpetrated against the black community to this day. It seems Alexander himself has been damaged, as have so many of our people, by the chain of evil that goes all the way back to slavery.It would have been nice if he had explored that point a bit more professionally, and perhaps explored his own apparent obsession with that point. During the credits Alexander claims: ""A black man was hurt during the making of this film. ME!!""It was funny--but it was Freudian. For all that, I took away a star. Tim Alexander may have a hell of a career ahead of him as a journalist/documentarian, but he needs to heal a part of himself first.Injury and pain of this kind are infectious--the only time I know when injury and pain infect others.",3,"""You cannot hold a race accountable...""",1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,3545,"['begin', 'am', 'always', 'proud', 'say', 'am', 'Jewish', 'am', 'equally', 'proud', 'be', 'half', 'black', 'Pop', 'side', 'was', 'kind', 'black', 'Jewish', 'descent', ""'m"", 'positive', 'ancestors', 'were', 'Caribbean', 'Mama', 'was', 'Sephardic', 'Jewish', 'were', 'born', 'raised', 'Mexico', 'Growing', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'mainly', 'am', 'so', 'pale', 'so', 'was', 'mother', 'folks', 'were', 'traditionalists', 'so', 'Mama', 'was', 'subservient', 'Pop', 'return', 'treated', 'center', 'universe.Sounds', 'made-up', ""n't"", 'mind', '2009', 'offering', 'was', 'as', 'entertaining', 'was', 'enlightening', 'oddly', 'paced', 'film', 'however', 'say', 'oddly', 'documentary', 'feedback', 'short', 'fictional', 'film', 'bits', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'type', 'thing', 'was', 'Sociology', '101', 'Nevertheless', 'liked', 'great', 'deal.Produced', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Alexander', 'based', 'three-minute', 'internet', 'video', 'Alexander', 'made', 'DIARY', 'A', 'TIRED', 'BLACK', 'MAN', 'tempting', 'compare', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'DIARY', 'A', 'MAD', 'BLACK', 'WOMAN', 'Perry', 'Mable', 'Madea', 'Simmons', 'suppose', 'quintessential', 'mad', 'black', 'woman', 'Alexander', 'DIARY', 'tired', 'black', 'man', 'tired', 'angry', 'black', 'woman.Interspersed', 'vignette', 'short', 'films', 'featuring', 'James', 'Caribbean', 'architect', 'gorgeous', 'Jimmy', 'Jean-Louis', 'horrible', 'shrew', 'wife', 'Tonya', 'B****', 'equally', 'lovely', 'Paula', 'Lema', 'film', 'entirely', 'Alexander', 'interviews', 'dozens', 'folks', 'commenting', 'film', 'shorts.The', 'incisive', 'thing', 'film', 'single', 'commentator', 'something', 'profound', 'say', 'relationships', 'black', 'community', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'so', 'thrilled', 'fact', 'hear', 'so', 'many', 'black', 'people', 'saying', 'people', 'problem', 'not', 'racial', 'problem', 'black', 'problem', 'Amen', 'little', 'fictional', 'vignettes', 'James', 'loving', 'sweet', 'upstanding', 'man', 'Tonya', 'Queen', 'Witches', 'eventually', 'time', 'thinking', 'ways', 'torment', 'poor', 'James', 'two', 'children', 'busy', 'life', 'James', 'Tonya', 'yet', 'get', 'bigger', 'house', 'nice', 'girl', 'turn', 'fortune', 'James', 'up', 'eliciting', 'confusion', 'many', 'interviewees', 'Also', 'interviewed', 'men', 'said', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'nice', 'James', 'was', 'ex-wife.By', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'bored', 'fictional', 'little', 'vignette', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Alexander', 'making', 'far', 'more', 'reasonable', 'professional', 'documentary', '100', '%', 'documentary', 'Still', 'approach', 'unique', 'cinema', 'points', 'home', 'was', 'bit', 'angered', 'Alexander', 'insistence', 'creating', 'new', 'syndrome', 'Angry', 'Black', 'Woman', 'Syndrome', 'apparent', 'semi-hidden', 'vindictiveness', 'black', 'women', 'have', 'point.Also', 'Alexander', 'race-obsessed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'psyche', 'evil', 'perpetrated', 'black', 'community', 'day', 'Alexander', 'been', 'damaged', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'chain', 'evil', 'way', 'back', 'slavery.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'explored', 'point', 'bit', 'more', 'professionally', 'perhaps', 'explored', 'own', 'apparent', 'obsession', 'point', 'credits', 'Alexander', 'claims', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'hurt', 'making', 'film', 'ME', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'Freudian', 'took', 'away', 'star', 'Tim', 'Alexander', 'may', 'have', 'hell', 'career', 'ahead', 'journalist/documentarian', 'heal', 'part', 'first.Injury', 'pain', 'kind', 'are', 'infectious', 'only', 'time', 'know', 'when', 'injury', 'pain', 'infect', 'others']",Diary of a Tired Black Man

This is an issue that is not solely representative of women of color. In fact, it crosses color lines and further still socioeconomic classes. At times, the film was hilarious because I couldn't believe/stomach the behavior depicted here and at other times it fell flat because it missed opportunities for further discussion.If we are so concerned about dysfunctional relationships and the behavior associated therewith, it's high time we examine our own behavior(s)and find ways to remedy the problems.

1213745,AXFBMZ06K50PO,B001L67A46,Marc Iverson,"[3, 5]","This movie is not nearly so over the top as some reviewers say, but obviously it pushed some buttons.  That it poked fun (and at men too, and the dating game in general, not just women) while at the same time addressing heartfelt issues made it harder to ""read"" than most straightforward documentaries.  The inclusion of dramatic sketches, sometimes with pretty nutty behavior, made it look even less like a serious documentary with a unified and singularly focused vision. It wasn't a paint-by-numbers presentation.But it wasn't trying to be rigorous in the way a tight-collared upper-crusty BBC documentary with a controlled and dour narrator reading off a committee-approved script would be.  It was an exploration, through hyperbole, drama, street interviews, and just plain shooting the breeze in the barbershop (where some of the most self-aware silliness and most fun hyperbole was slung by what appears to be the local impromptu poet), of sexual and racial issues.  Many could just as easily be applied to any race or ethnicity, which makes this film resonate more than it might have and be of broader interest.Have fun with it, and don't hold yourself to agreeing or disagreeing with every point, and you'll likely enjoy it.  Pretty much every view gets taken to an absurd limit at some point in the movie before the movie bounces back again into the next thought from a more reasonable person (or from a reasonable person who didn't get caught out so obviously going off the deep end), and even interviewees who initially seem strident often show their more human side as the interview goes on.  That's part of what humanizes it from a monotonous rant into something more fun and interesting.There are few interviewees in this flick that I didn't wind up liking in the end, definitely including all the women.  Everyone here seemed, well ... nice, if that word hasn't fallen too far out of fashion.  There really wasn't aggressive and negative interrupting of female interviewees to speak of, contrary to what some others reviews assert.  So this movie isn't a hatchet job or a bunch of angry whining from sour and bitter men.  It is one of those films that will put some people on pins and needles -- but isn't that one of the things good documentaries are best at, and one of the things they're for?

It was a documentary with some playacting thrown in.  I watched the whole movie and was pissed the whole time.  I feel like the description of this movie lies.  They don't tell you it's a documentary.  The way they describe it's a movie of a man that's just had enough and the drama that follows.  It was not that at all.  I think they need to relabel this.  It did make some valid points about the relationship between black men and women.  The scene where she spits on him was too much to take.  The one way to make a black person lose their minds is to spit on them.  Realistically she would have been beaten to within an inch of her life had he been a real black man.

Simmons,"[1, 1]","If I were to judge DOATBM on the acting or script alone, I woudln't rate it very highly but the subject matter alone and the word-on-the-street commentaries, make this worth watching.  the protagonist is James, an respectable architect who, at first, is married to Tanya, a beautiful, but very difficult woman whose mission in life seems to be to make James' life as miserable as possible.  In between the situations the couple find themselves is commentary among men and women across the country and their opinions on black male/female relationships.  If nothing else, the movie and commentary are thought provoking and need to be heard.Those who complain about how black women are portrayed, think about how black men have felt after nearly four decades of ""Waiting to Exhale"" type books, Oprah (who I happen to admire), issues of ""Essence,"" ""Ebony"" and other publications telling black women to date outside the race because there aren't enough good black men as well as making us out to be deadbeat dads, cheaters, on the down low and just downright incorrigible.  Some say that this movie is playing tit for tat but I disagree.  You can't sit idly by and be bashed without, at least, wanting to issue a rebuttal.  There are two sides to every story and this is simply one way of telling ours.  Certain black women are always telling us that if we're not the kind of brother who's being maligned that we shouldn't take offense but are obviously refusing to take their own advice.  DOATBM is far from being a solution to the black male/female conflict but it is certainly a worthy catalyst for dialog if you watch with an open mind.",4,"The, rarely heard, Black man's point of view on relationships.",1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1635,"['were', 'judge', 'DOATBM', 'acting', 'script', 'alone', 'woudl', ""n't"", 'rate', 'very', 'highly', 'subject', 'matter', 'alone', 'word-on-the-street', 'commentaries', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'protagonist', 'James', 'respectable', 'architect', 'who', 'first', 'married', 'Tanya', 'beautiful', 'very', 'difficult', 'woman', 'mission', 'life', 'be', 'make', 'James', 'life', 'as', 'miserable', 'possible', 'situations', 'couple', 'find', 'commentary', 'men', 'women', 'country', 'opinions', 'black', 'male/female', 'relationships', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'commentary', 'are', 'thought', 'provoking', 'need', 'be', 'heard.Those', 'who', 'complain', 'how', 'black', 'women', 'are', 'portrayed', 'think', 'how', 'black', 'men', 'have', 'felt', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'type', 'books', 'Oprah', 'who', 'happen', 'admire', 'issues', 'Essence', 'Ebony', 'other', 'publications', 'telling', 'black', 'women', 'date', 'race', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'black', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'be', 'deadbeat', 'dads', 'cheaters', 'down', 'low', 'just', 'downright', 'incorrigible', 'say', 'movie', 'playing', 'tit', 'tat', 'disagree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'idly', 'be', 'bashed', 'least', 'wanting', 'issue', 'rebuttal', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'simply', 'one', 'way', 'telling', 'ours', 'Certain', 'black', 'women', 'are', 'always', 'telling', ""'re"", 'not', 'kind', 'brother', 'who', 'being', 'maligned', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'offense', 'are', 'obviously', 'refusing', 'take', 'own', 'advice', 'DOATBM', 'far', 'being', 'solution', 'black', 'male/female', 'conflict', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'catalyst', 'dialog', 'watch', 'open', 'mind']",Diary of a Tired Black Man
