Most would agree that Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester were successful in every way, but this picture generates violent disagreement. Sadly the majority would dismiss this film as a failed experiment to bring an odd 1970s lesbian cowboy novel to the big screen. There is however a vocal minority who absolutely love the quirkiness of this film. Its difference is at the heart of its charm, and together with Uma Thurman's star quality and k.d. lang's score this movie rises above the everyday action comedy dramas or romances most film-makers are producing.I have read the book and Van Sant's adaptation is very faithful. The sexuality is only hinted at and this is carried forward in the film in the brief scenes of touching between Rain Phoenix and Uma Thurman. Despite being twenty years old, Rain still manages to look like a young teenager, and this perhaps undermines the intention of the scenes with her. If there is such a thing as perfect casting it is that of k.d. lang as the soundtrack composer and performer, which fits as perfectly as you would expect. John Hurt almost reprises his Quentin Crisp in his role as The Duchess, a much louder performance than I imagined from the book, but nevertheless funny and well-observed. All in all, there are some enjoyable and interesting bits and pieces in this film, even if it doesn't quite hit the high tide mark of Van Sant's other achievements.",3,A brave project from the director of Good Will Hunting,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,1513,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'bold', 'film', 'maker', 'unusual', 'ideas', 'occasionally', 'jackpot', 'Most', 'would', 'agree', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'were', 'successful', 'way', 'picture', 'violent', 'disagreement', 'Sadly', 'majority', 'would', 'dismiss', 'film', 'failed', 'experiment', 'bring', 'odd', '1970s', 'lesbian', 'cowboy', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'however', 'vocal', 'minority', 'who', 'absolutely', 'love', 'quirkiness', 'film', 'difference', 'heart', 'charm', 'together', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'star', 'quality', 'k.d', 'lang', 'score', 'movie', 'everyday', 'action', 'comedy', 'dramas', 'romances', 'most', 'film-makers', 'are', 'producing.I', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'Van', 'Sant', 'adaptation', 'very', 'faithful', 'sexuality', 'only', 'hinted', 'carried', 'forward', 'film', 'brief', 'scenes', 'touching', 'Rain', 'Phoenix', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'being', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'Rain', 'still', 'look', 'young', 'teenager', 'perhaps', 'intention', 'scenes', 'such', 'thing', 'perfect', 'casting', 'k.d', 'soundtrack', 'composer', 'performer', 'as', 'perfectly', 'would', 'expect', 'John', 'Hurt', 'almost', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'role', 'Duchess', 'much', 'louder', 'performance', 'imagined', 'book', 'nevertheless', 'funny', 'well-observed', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'bits', 'pieces', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'high', 'tide', 'mark', 'Van', 'Sant', 'other', 'achievements']",Even Cowgirls Get the Blues VHS

She's tall, & reasonably attractive, & sometimes blonde, but she was the poster-girl for the Uber-hip set in the late 80's/early 90's so for that set, she was a perfect choice as Sissy Hankshaw. Having read & loved this book, I knew she was not a good choice, and she was subsequently was named Worst Actress of 1993 for her terrible attempt to portray Cissy. Likewise, Rain aka Rain- bow aka Rain Phoenix was also miscast, as well as not being talented enough to pull off the role of Boss Cowgirl Bonanza Jellybean. She seemed to be attempting to read off a Teleprompter, or maybe she should have been. Did I detect her lips moving before she attempted to deliver her lines? The reason she was not named Worst Actress of 1993 was that to win that award, she had to be an actress, which she clearly is not. I've seen better acting on an X-rated channel. Angie Dickinson, that 60's-70's retread hearthrob of teenage males was nearly as bad as Phoenix & Thurman, but she had an excuse, she hadn't worked for many years, & was critically hungover. At least she seemed that way. That's the bad news. The good news is, the rest of the cast was a hoot! Batting leadoff, the always weird & wonderful Carol Kane & Buck Henry(why don't those two have children?? What a great idea), John Hurt in drag, Crispin Glover, Pat Morita(as Noryuki)as The Chink(""Ha Ha Ho Ho and Hee Hee!!""), Sean Young looking so sexy I almost forgot about her psychotic meltdown over James Woods, Keanu Reeves was entirely adequate as Julian Gitchee, but any one of a number of Native American, Canadian, or Ecuadoran actors would have been a better choice, such as the lovely & talented Gary Farmer. Two other bones to pick: 1) Tom Robbins' favorite Native American tribe, is not pronounced See-Wash, but Sigh-wash and B) Why was the locale moved from the Dakotas to Deschutes County, Oregon?
