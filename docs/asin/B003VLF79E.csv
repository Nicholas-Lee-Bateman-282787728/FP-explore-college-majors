It's Lana Turner's best film, and Robert Young was perfectly cast.  Special credit should go to Pandro Berman for bringing out yet another first class film.  By the way, compare Turner here with the later Marilyn Monroe.  Their approach to acting is similar, and both were, of course, stunning beauties.  But it's no contest on film; Turner is far more talented and capable.",4,Classic screwball,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,473,"['late', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'great', 'many', 'genre', 'classics', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'best', 'film', 'Robert', 'Young', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Special', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'Pandro', 'Berman', 'bringing', 'out', 'yet', 'first', 'class', 'film', 'way', 'compare', 'Turner', 'here', 'later', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'approach', 'acting', 'similar', 'were', 'course', 'stunning', 'beauties', 'contest', 'film', 'Turner', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'capable']",N/A

1367299,A23UB49EG29MVT,B003VLF79E,Commenter77,"[1, 1]","This is a dandy little movie with an apt title.  Delightful portrayal.  This is my opinion of Lana Turner's best role. She showed a strong flair for comedy in this, her most authentic work.  She never came across so fresh again.  With her glamorization and box office success came a hard edge.  Since the big budget pictures are more often dramas, that's where she went. She remained box office, but to me, was a gag in dramatic roles. She seemed like a tough, enduring type of person, who worked hard at it. She needed to, since in-depth portrayals did not seem to come naturally to her. She certainly never seemed very natural in them. Melodrama turned out to be the compromise that worked out to offset this.  Since a lot of the public was fascinated with her in those, she kept showing up in the same. Talk about somebody playing the same part over and over . . .  It really seems, though, that she could have been an effective comedic actress if they would have let her and if she would have held out for it.  What about romantic comedy?!  Many stars, with glamour, came and stayed at the top of the game in that venue.  Why not?  Guess she was just too good looking, and they couldn't resist the siren call.",4,Lana Turner's Best Venue?,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,1213,"['dandy', 'little', 'movie', 'apt', 'title', 'Delightful', 'portrayal', 'opinion', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'best', 'role', 'showed', 'strong', 'flair', 'comedy', 'most', 'authentic', 'work', 'never', 'came', 'so', 'fresh', 'again', 'glamorization', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'came', 'hard', 'edge', 'big', 'budget', 'pictures', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'where', 'went', 'remained', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'gag', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'seemed', 'tough', 'enduring', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'worked', 'hard', 'needed', 'in-depth', 'portrayals', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'come', 'naturally', 'certainly', 'never', 'seemed', 'very', 'natural', 'Melodrama', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'compromise', 'worked', 'out', 'offset', 'lot', 'public', 'was', 'fascinated', 'kept', 'showing', 'up', 'same', 'Talk', 'somebody', 'playing', 'same', 'part', 'over', 'really', 'though', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'comedic', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'out', 'What', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Many', 'stars', 'glamour', 'came', 'stayed', 'top', 'game', 'venue', 'Why', 'not', 'Guess', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'siren', 'call']",N/A

1367301,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003VLF79E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","When I'm on a date my big sell is to boast to the girl that I'm a classic film buff, and then I watch her dust as she hooks up with some other guy. But never mind. My point being, even though I tout myself as a classic film buff, I confess to a blind spot or three. I try to steer away from Clark Gable (too sneery). Greta Garbo depresses me. And Lana Turner is mostly a blank slate.The opening voiceover condemns Hotchkiss Falls, New York as a particularly dreary place to live. This sets the stage for the ennui and sense of frustration that befall 21-year-old orphan Peggy Evans (Turner). Peggy is Employee #122, a soda jerk at a department store, and diligent enough that she's rewarded for her one thousand consecutive work days of being punctual with Merit Award #4 (redeemable for $2.50 in store merchandise). She's informed that another 1500 would bring along a merit award worth $10. This, to Peggy Evans, is the final straw. Her co-worker attempts to comfort her, gaily informs her that she just needs a ""Johnny"" to make it all bearable. With a Johnny, she adds, ""You just keep laughing at nothing all the time."" A fed-up Peggy proceeds to serve her clientele blindfolded, and she's doing swell, too, until the new store manager, Bob Stuart (Robert Young), espies her antics and chews her out.1943's SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS presents a formula for starting over. You book out of town but, first, you leave behind a note that inadvertently implicates that store manager. Then in New York you shell out roughly $150 for an extreme makeover. Then I guess you cross your fingers and hope for an elevated can of paint to bean you on the head, thus incurring a case of ""amnesia."" This chain of events culminates outside an eminent newspaper building, and here's Eugene Pallette's nervous newspaper chief wanting to avoid bad publicity and so setting up our amnesiac with a cushy crib until she remembers who she is. For what it's worth, I wish Lana hadn't traded her brunette looks for that of the more sophisticated platinum blonde.Consensus states thatThe Postman Always Rings Twiceis high up Lana Turner's ouevre, and that one I'd seen and I agree with you that she'd never been more seductive. So, yeah, whenever there's mention of Lana Turner, this image of a sultry femme fatale manifests. SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS presents a more innocent Lana Turner. Her character does connive for a better life, but she retains a wholesomeness about her. Peggy Evans is ambitious but she has a conscience.Still, she does her due diligence, conducts her research, and lays down crumbs that eventually has everyone believing that she's the long-lost heiress to Walter Brennan's tycoon. It's neat to see Brennan go against type. He's clean-shaven here and minus his traditional cornpone cowboy sidekick schtick. Dame May Whitty is Baba, the long-time nursemaid in the rich man's household. These two present our lovely amnesiac with a test: pick out their missing child's most favorite toy in a roomful of toys. What follows is one of the film's several neat sequences as Peggy applies her surprisingly cogent deductive reasoning to eliminate the toy pretenders one by one.Robert Young's store manager propels one of the major plot lines. Back in Hotchkiss Falls, Peggy Evans' mysterious disappearance and note lead everyone to assume she'd drowned herself in the river and now everyone's giving him the stink eye. When he loses his job, he sees her photo in a newspaper and makes his way to New York, determined to expose the so-called heiress. Cue his many manic attempts to get to her and also the many times he gets slugged in the breadbasket by Ward Bond, here playing the tycoon's bodyguard.If you're a fan of that cop show BARETTA, keep on eye on a 9-year-old Robert Blake, credited here as ""Boy on Porch.""The few films I'd seen Lana Turner in were mostly these torrid soap operas, not really my cup of joe. But after watching this amiable romantic comedy, and seeing how fresh-faced and natural Lana is here, I'm more open to tuning in when her stuff pops up on TCM. She and Robert Young demonstrate a comfy kind of spark, maybe because they'd worked together before in 1938's RICH MAN, POOR GIRL. My favorite scene is their ""picnic dance"" in that diner as they engage in a bit of a tap dance oneupmanship. This leads to a cute hotel room scene that recalls a classic FRIENDS episode (""The One Where Everybody Finds Out"") in which Chandler and Phoebe try to outbluff each other. Robert Young proves to be as bluffable as Chandler Bing.3.5 out of 5 stars for SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS.",4,"""Baba... circus...""",1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,4567,"['When', ""'m"", 'date', 'big', 'sell', 'boast', 'girl', ""'m"", 'classic', 'film', 'buff', 'then', 'watch', 'dust', 'up', 'other', 'guy', 'never', 'mind', 'point', 'being', 'even', 'tout', 'classic', 'film', 'buff', 'confess', 'blind', 'spot', 'three', 'try', 'steer', 'away', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'too', 'sneery', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'mostly', 'blank', 'slate.The', 'opening', 'voiceover', 'condemns', 'Hotchkiss', 'Falls', 'New', 'York', 'particularly', 'dreary', 'place', 'live', 'stage', 'ennui', 'sense', 'frustration', '21-year-old', 'orphan', 'Peggy', 'Evans', 'Turner', 'Peggy', 'Employee', '122', 'soda', 'jerk', 'department', 'store', 'diligent', 'enough', 'rewarded', 'one', 'thousand', 'consecutive', 'work', 'days', 'being', 'punctual', 'Merit', 'Award', '4', 'redeemable', '2.50', 'store', 'merchandise', 'informed', '1500', 'would', 'bring', 'along', 'merit', 'award', '10', 'Peggy', 'Evans', 'final', 'straw', 'co-worker', 'attempts', 'comfort', 'gaily', 'just', 'Johnny', 'make', 'bearable', 'Johnny', 'just', 'keep', 'laughing', 'nothing', 'time', 'fed-up', 'Peggy', 'proceeds', 'serve', 'clientele', 'blindfolded', 'doing', 'swell', 'too', 'new', 'store', 'manager', 'Bob', 'Stuart', 'Robert', 'Young', 'antics', 'out.1943', 'SLIGHTLY', 'DANGEROUS', 'formula', 'starting', 'over', 'book', 'town', 'first', 'leave', 'note', 'inadvertently', 'store', 'manager', 'Then', 'New', 'York', 'shell', 'out', 'roughly', '150', 'extreme', 'makeover', 'Then', 'guess', 'cross', 'fingers', 'hope', 'elevated', 'can', 'paint', 'bean', 'head', 'thus', 'incurring', 'case', 'amnesia', 'chain', 'events', 'culminates', 'eminent', 'newspaper', 'building', 'here', 'Eugene', 'Pallette', 'nervous', 'newspaper', 'chief', 'wanting', 'avoid', 'bad', 'publicity', 'so', 'setting', 'up', 'amnesiac', 'cushy', 'crib', 'remembers', 'who', 'what', 'worth', 'wish', 'Lana', 'had', ""n't"", 'traded', 'brunette', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'platinum', 'blonde.Consensus', 'thatThe', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twiceis', 'high', 'up', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'ouevre', 'one', ""'d"", 'seen', 'agree', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'more', 'seductive', 'So', 'yeah', 'whenever', 'mention', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'image', 'sultry', 'femme', 'fatale', 'manifests', 'SLIGHTLY', 'DANGEROUS', 'more', 'innocent', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'character', 'connive', 'better', 'life', 'wholesomeness', 'Peggy', 'Evans', 'ambitious', 'conscience.Still', 'due', 'diligence', 'research', 'down', 'crumbs', 'eventually', 'everyone', 'believing', 'long-lost', 'heiress', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'tycoon', 'neat', 'see', 'Brennan', 'go', 'type', 'clean-shaven', 'here', 'minus', 'traditional', 'cornpone', 'cowboy', 'sidekick', 'schtick', 'Dame', 'May', 'Whitty', 'Baba', 'long-time', 'nursemaid', 'rich', 'man', 'household', 'two', 'present', 'lovely', 'amnesiac', 'test', 'pick', 'out', 'missing', 'child', 'most', 'favorite', 'toy', 'roomful', 'toys', 'What', 'one', 'film', 'several', 'neat', 'sequences', 'Peggy', 'surprisingly', 'cogent', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'eliminate', 'toy', 'pretenders', 'one', 'one.Robert', 'Young', 'store', 'manager', 'one', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'Back', 'Hotchkiss', 'Falls', 'Peggy', 'Evans', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'note', 'lead', 'everyone', 'assume', ""'d"", 'drowned', 'river', 'now', 'everyone', 'giving', 'stink', 'eye', 'When', 'job', 'photo', 'newspaper', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'determined', 'expose', 'so-called', 'heiress', 'Cue', 'many', 'manic', 'attempts', 'get', 'also', 'many', 'times', 'slugged', 'breadbasket', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'here', 'playing', 'tycoon', 'bodyguard.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'cop', 'show', 'BARETTA', 'keep', 'eye', '9-year-old', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'credited', 'here', 'Boy', 'Porch', 'few', 'films', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'were', 'mostly', 'torrid', 'soap', 'operas', 'not', 'really', 'cup', 'joe', 'watching', 'amiable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'seeing', 'how', 'fresh-faced', 'natural', 'Lana', 'here', ""'m"", 'more', 'open', 'tuning', 'when', 'stuff', 'up', 'TCM', 'Robert', 'Young', 'demonstrate', 'comfy', 'kind', 'spark', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'worked', 'together', '1938', 'RICH', 'MAN', 'POOR', 'GIRL', 'favorite', 'scene', 'picnic', 'dance', 'diner', 'engage', 'bit', 'tap', 'dance', 'oneupmanship', 'cute', 'hotel', 'room', 'scene', 'classic', 'FRIENDS', 'episode', 'One', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'Out', 'Chandler', 'Phoebe', 'try', 'outbluff', 'other', 'Robert', 'Young', 'be', 'as', 'bluffable', 'Chandler', 'Bing.3.5', '5', 'stars', 'SLIGHTLY', 'DANGEROUS']",N/A
