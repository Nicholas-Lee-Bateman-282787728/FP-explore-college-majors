997736,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FZEU42,A Customer,"[0, 9]","The stunning performance by Marcia Gay Harden playing a mother whose life has unraveled after her son shot up a school, is the real reason to see American Gun, a beautifully sober but dramatically staid film about the proliferation of firearms and the effects they have on American lives and culture.Director Aric Avelino intersperses three stories in different parts of the country, effectively juxtaposing the nagging sense of hopelessness, as there's little we will ever be able to do to shake off the scourge and the terrible legacy of firearms.The picture starts out in a Virginia gun store where the proprietor (Donald Sutherland) has just hired his college age granddaughter Mary Ann (Linda Cardellini), to work in the shop even though her heart doesn't seem to be in the family business. Obstreperous and truculent she gradually develops a fascination with firearms after she is almost raped at a party.By far the strongest story is set in Oregon where distraught mother Janet (Harden) has become the town pariah when her older son participated in a Columbine-style shooting at his school. In the three years since the rampage, Janet has lost her job and most of her friends. Her surviving son, David, (Christopher Marquette) is in high school now and is beginning to show escalating signs of anger at his mother, at his dead brother, at the world.While Janet has difficulty coping, the tragic events have echoed out through the town haunting a police deputy (Tony Goldwyn), who still grapples with past accusations that he didn't do enough to prevent the shootings and that he just stood around while so many kids died.Meanwhile, over in the South-side of Chicago, Head Carter, the principal of a violence-prone inner-city high school (Forrest Whitaker), struggles to hold everything together. The school is smack-bang in the middle of a gang ridden neighborhood, and Principal Carter, driven to his wits end, ends up threatening Jay (Arlen Escarpeta), one of his most promising students when he catches him with a handgun.Carter's barely contained rage is mirrored in his chaotic environment, where metal detectors shriek warnings and truly dedicated students are as rare as they are prized. The violence, the truancy and the attitudes keep worsening and Carter begins harboring concerns for the safety of his own young son.Avelino constantly cuts back and forth between these stories. Some are better than others, with Harden's tale certainly getting the lion's share of dramatic tension. It's without a doubt an incendiary subject, and the director should indeed be commended for conveying such a unique take on the issue. The film, however, becomes a little too episodic and emotionally stale.The dialogue-heavy scenes and the somewhat heavy-handed polemic also prompt built-in viewer disengagement after about thirty minutes or so, which is a pity because American Gun could indeed have been a great film. Although similar to Crash with its interconnecting stories, American Gun just isn't as fully realized and doesn't weave its stories into a tightly woven schematic fabric as Crash did.Still, it turns out that this definitely Marcia Gay Harden's film - her performance is even worthy of an Oscar nomination. Her betrayal of Janet, so demonized by those around her for something that was ultimately behind her control is played with such as pitch-perfect balance of delusional calm and near-hysterical grief and guilt.In one terrible scene, angry and self-righteous neighbors confront her and accuse her of being ""the mother of a murderer,"" and it ranks among one of the most discomfiting and unsettling scenes I have seen on screen in recent memory.Obviously there are no easy answers to the problems of gun violence in America and Avelino's film carefully doesn't lay the blame, but he does raise the question of who's actually to blame for gun violence, and more importantly, how we make it stop?

997737,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000FZEU42,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 7]","""American Gun"", is an attempt to do what so many filmmakers wish: to speak out on an issue, changing minds or informing, shedding light on dark areas. It is a shame that ""American Gun"" is not more successful, as it generally comes across as directionless, failing to convey its tagline message that firing a gun shatters more than silence.In the style of movies like ""Crash"", or ""Magnolia"", ""American Gun"" follows several separate story threads that intertwine- though, it must be said, to a lesser extent than those films. Marcia Gay Haden plays the mother of a boy who took part in a Columbine-style assault on his school who now has to deal not only with the hostility of parents around her but also her other son, now marked by the shadow of his brother's actions. Forest Whitaker's character is the principal of an inner-city school who has become so consumed by protecting his school and his students that his relationship with his wife (Garcelle Beauvais) and son is suffering. The daily struggle to keep his campus safe hasn't prevented one of his better students, who lives in a dangerous neighborhood, from acquiring a gun to protect himself- especially during the night job he has taken on to support his family. Linda Cardellini is a college student working in a gun shop owned by her grandfather (Donald Sutherland) who is struggling to find her place in life, and Tony Goldwyn is a police officer forced to confront his feelings as one of the officers criticized for not doing more to prevent the school shooting tragedy.The major problem with the movie is that a synopsis fills you in on almost everything you need you know about the content of the film. There are few compelling scenes, whether we focus on action or emotion, and the characters are so one-dimensional that their names barely matter- within the confines of the film, they matter only insofar as their thoughts about firearms exist. To a certain degree, this is the point- Avelino clearly wishes to portray a series of stories that speak for themselves. However, the film ultimately feels impersonal, as if too much has been contrived in order to make a point. By and large, the actors perform adequately, and Whitaker's performance is excellent- although this might be the result of receiving a role with far more substance to it than many of the other capable actors in the film. His character comes off as noble, but human- someone with the best of intentions who is inevitably worn down by the magnitude of the task in front of him. Nobody could walk away from the task of keeping children safe, and yet it is too much of a burden for him to shoulder.By and large, the other characters are not that persuasive. Their stories, or settings, are interesting enough, but barring one or two moments of genuine pathos, very little happens that is worth the setup. ""American Gun"" is not a bad film. It simply isn't very good. The slow pace and lack of direction lessen the impact of its serious themes, and the detached feeling lessens emotional connection and sympathy towards the main characters. It's a film one can watch, but not, perhaps, a film worth watching.",3,Nice effort from writer-director Aric Avelino,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,3144,"['American', 'Gun', 'attempt', 'do', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'wish', 'speak', 'out', 'issue', 'changing', 'minds', 'informing', 'shedding', 'light', 'dark', 'areas', 'shame', 'American', 'Gun', 'not', 'more', 'successful', 'generally', 'across', 'directionless', 'failing', 'convey', 'tagline', 'message', 'firing', 'gun', 'more', 'silence.In', 'style', 'movies', 'Crash', 'Magnolia', 'American', 'Gun', 'several', 'separate', 'story', 'threads', 'intertwine-', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'lesser', 'extent', 'films', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Haden', 'mother', 'boy', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'Columbine-style', 'assault', 'school', 'who', 'now', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'hostility', 'parents', 'also', 'other', 'son', 'now', 'marked', 'shadow', 'brother', 'actions', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'principal', 'inner-city', 'school', 'who', 'become', 'so', 'consumed', 'protecting', 'school', 'students', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Garcelle', 'Beauvais', 'son', 'suffering', 'daily', 'struggle', 'keep', 'campus', 'safe', ""n't"", 'prevented', 'one', 'better', 'students', 'who', 'dangerous', 'neighborhood', 'acquiring', 'gun', 'protect', 'himself-', 'especially', 'night', 'job', 'taken', 'support', 'family', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'college', 'student', 'working', 'gun', 'shop', 'owned', 'grandfather', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'life', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'police', 'officer', 'forced', 'confront', 'feelings', 'one', 'officers', 'criticized', 'not', 'doing', 'more', 'prevent', 'school', 'shooting', 'tragedy.The', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'synopsis', 'almost', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'content', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'focus', 'action', 'emotion', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'names', 'barely', 'matter-', 'confines', 'film', 'matter', 'only', 'insofar', 'thoughts', 'firearms', 'exist', 'certain', 'degree', 'point-', 'Avelino', 'clearly', 'portray', 'series', 'stories', 'speak', 'However', 'film', 'ultimately', 'feels', 'impersonal', 'too', 'much', 'been', 'contrived', 'order', 'make', 'point', 'large', 'actors', 'perform', 'adequately', 'Whitaker', 'performance', 'excellent-', 'might', 'be', 'result', 'receiving', 'role', 'far', 'more', 'substance', 'many', 'other', 'capable', 'actors', 'film', 'character', 'off', 'noble', 'human-', 'someone', 'best', 'intentions', 'who', 'inevitably', 'worn', 'down', 'magnitude', 'task', 'front', 'Nobody', 'could', 'walk', 'away', 'task', 'keeping', 'children', 'safe', 'yet', 'too', 'much', 'burden', 'shoulder.By', 'large', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'persuasive', 'stories', 'settings', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'barring', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'very', 'little', 'happens', 'setup', 'American', 'Gun', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'slow', 'pace', 'lack', 'direction', 'impact', 'serious', 'themes', 'detached', 'feeling', 'emotional', 'connection', 'sympathy', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'not', 'perhaps', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
997738,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000FZEU42,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","When the Paul Haggis film ""Crash"" won an Academy Award for Best Picture for 2006, I wasn't surprised but I was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I liked ""Crash"" well enough--but it was a message movie of the most obvious type.  Even stellar performances could not hide its manipulative nature and the contrivance that helped move the plot forward.  The ""racism is bad yet prevalent in society"" theme bludgeoned the viewer with an important lesson--one that might have benefited from a little more subtlety in the storytelling.  But why talk about ""Crash?""  As the indie film ""American Gun"" began, I immediately sensed the similarities.  A disparate, seemingly unrelated group of characters was introduced and I was sure I was in for colliding stories with an important lesson about gun control and violence.Well, there's good news and bad news.  First the good:  ""American Gun"" features a tremendous cast doing great work, and the film is not a preachy diatribe that tells you how you should feel (""Crash"" anyone?).  However, the bad news is that some of the storylines seem a bit underdeveloped.  The end result is that this is a solid piece of filmmaking that falls short of being great.  It's definitely worth a look, for a variety of reasons, but it didn't end up packing the emotional punch that I had hoped it would.  While some viewers may be left unsatisfied with the general lack of resolution, it was several underwritten subplots that were more problematic for me.The principle story involves Marcia Gay Harden as the mother of a boy who has gone on a Columbine-like shooting spree at his school.  Three years after the event, she and her other son (Chris Marquette) are still trying to deal with the aftermath.  Harden is a tremendous presence and a great actress, and if there was only one reason to recommend this film--it would be her.  Fierce, defensive, shouldering the blame and fighting to hold it together--this is such a great performance!  Marquette matches her nicely and this plotline is moving and riveting.  In addition, Tony Goldwyn gives a sensitive performance as a cop in the same town who is also haunted by the school shooting.  In an unrelated story, Forest Whitaker gives a typically fine performance as a principle trying to make a difference.  Linda Cardellini and Donald Sutherland show up in another story arc--bonding as grandfather and granddaughter.The Cardellini/Sutherland story left much to be desired--nicely performed but not particularly enlightening.  The Whitaker plot is better, if more conventional, and features strong work by Chris Warren Jr. as a promising student trying to make good.  And that leaves Harden and Marquette in a story of great power and unrelenting despair.  If this was the whole film, I'd give it five stars.  But the unevenness brings the score down to about 3 1/2 (I'm rounding up for Harden).  I admired much of ""American Gun,"" but I just didn't love it.

997740,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B000FZEU42,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[5, 10]","Director: Aric AvelinoCast:  Donald Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Marcia Gay Hayden, Linda Cardellini, Chris Marquette, Nikki Reed, Arlen Escarpeta, Garcelle Beauvais, Amanda Seyfried.Running Time: 95 minutesRated R for Rated R for violent content and language.Three stories unfold in Aric Avelino's touching and sometimes difficult drama ""American Gun"", centering on the 3-year aftermath of shootings at a high school not unlike Columbine and the link between the three is the ever-present, dangerous object that we know of as the gun. Right at the start, snippets of the high school tragedy unfold amidst newsreels, pictures of the students killed in the massacre, and most distressing of all, the image of students fleeing from a study room, caught on a surveillance camera, as later on, the two armed kids enter the picture. Even more anguishing is the fact that even before they make their visible appearance, they can be heard via their deadly approach: the echoing sound of bullets hitting unspeakable targets. The mother of one of the killers, Janet (played well by Marcia Gay Hayden), carries much of the emotional weight of the story since from the start, fingers point at her as the reason that her eldest son committed these murders, for which she has now lost her job, and can barely support what is left of her family.  She agrees to a paid interview -- seen filtered in and out of the news montage -- only because it can allow her to pay for her younger son's education. The terrible irony is he will now have to go to the same high school that his older son went to because she can't afford another one. Janet doesn't have any answers as to what lead to her son's rampage. Indeed, with many of these senseless acts, there is no true answer many of the times. She clearly is trying to be a good mother in every way, but is turned into a pariah from her own community who believes evil starts at home and she was half responsible and because she didn't display the correct image of sympathy in her interview, she is now tainted. Marcia Gay Harden portrays Janet as a woman literally coming apart, realizing her younger son is getting into drugs and will not talk to her, wondering if he might also become like his dead brother.The only person she is able to make a connection with is the police officer caught on duty who was unable to do more to save these students from a horrible and meaningless death. Frank (Tony Goldwyn) is carrying an enormous amount of emotional baggage because he was only trying to do his job: things just got totally out of hand. His character eventually meets Janet's, and in an emotional gripping scene, she completely breaks down. Because after all, as she says, ""I just want them to know I feel real bad.""  Midway across the country, Carl (Forrest Whitaker in his best performance in years) is trying to make things better for the underprivileged. A principal for an inner city high school that has seen very violent days, he has become totally devoted to tutoring those in need and imparting order when it seems that gun violence amongst the students will reach a major high. However, he is neglecting his own duties at home, which is putting a huge dent in his marriage and is sowing the seeds of his son's shame when forced to carry a bag, then a girl's knapsack, to school. And to top it all, one of his top students carries a gun to school for reasons of his own that are later confirmed in a harrowing moment when the kid faces real danger at the hand of a crazy man with a loaded gun.The more subtle of stories presents Mary Anne (Linda Cardellini), a girl living in Virginia, who seems to be at odd with the family tradition of tending to her father's (Donald Sutherland) store because the store sells none other than guns (to which she is opposed to). An incident where a college friend nearly gets date raped spawns a new interest in Mary Anne to learn how to shoot. One could argue that the message being played is that even when you are surrounded by weapons that can kill, they can also aid in self-defense.  ""American Gun"" is a visually poetic film that doesn't preach the message in black and white colors.  Yes, it is true that guns have caused grave violence in our history, yet they do not directly cause the horror--it is humans that pull the trigger; however, in many ways guns have been a positive in our society, as they oftentimes can be protective and shield us from evil.  Director and screenwriter Aric Avelino attempts the ""Crash"" and ""21 Grams"" approach to the ensemble piece, mixing great performances all around (although Donald Sutherland's talents seem wasted once again) with an intelligently written script.  A passive-aggressive fusion of graphic horror, touching emotion, endless despair, and unyielding hope, ""American Gun"" is an underappreciated and overwhelmingly engaging drama that should not be missed.",4,American Gun (2005),1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,4889,"['Director', 'Aric', 'AvelinoCast', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Hayden', 'Linda', 'Cardellini',
