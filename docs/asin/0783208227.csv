Films that are able touch the beauty and innocence of the human condition- reminding us not what is wrong with the world, but what redemption can do for the world.  Films that do not manipulate the emotions of the viewer, but have the grace to warm our hearts.Heart And Souls is one of those special films that takes a tender and joyous look at redemption and true humanity, but with a humorous approach.  Robert Downey Jr., Kyra Sedgwick, Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodard, and Tom Sizemore all give wonderful performances.  The film is poetic, humorous, and touching all at the same time.

I went ahead and bought it as I like him as an actor and the reviews here seemed favorable. I'm truly glad I picked up this little gem. Great story, acting, and music make it well worth owning. I believe a TV series may have been based on this movie, but I don't know the details. Suffice it to say it is a warm story of friendship and love and not passing on a chance to try to make things right. Whether it is returning stolen stamps, singing in front of an B. B. King audience, checking what became of your kids, or making sure a couple doesn't pass up the chance to share each others lifes. A young man is followed by three spirits all his life since they died at his birth. At first they tried to help him but realize when he becomes a child they may cause problems with how others percieve his interaction with them. They later return when he becomes an adult since they finally find out they must use him to do the one thing they would have done before they died.

I was only eight years old when I first saw it and ever since then, it has been on of my favorite movies.A bus accident claims the lives of Harrison (Charles Grodin) (a frustrated opera singer is overcome by stage fright), Julia (Kyria Sedgwick) (a young woman who has let the love of her life walk out on her), Milo (Tom Seizmore) (a burglar with a guilty conscience), and Penny (Alfre Woodard) (a single mother who must leave her kids to work the night shift). The accident occurs at the exact moment a newborn baby boy was brought into the world: Thomas Reilly. Harrison, Julia, Penny, and Milo become ghosts and are immediately drawn to Thomas. They become friends with Thomas. The problem is, only Thomas can see and hear them.When Thomas turns seven years old, the four ghosts realize that they are getting Thomas into trouble. They must sadly fade out of his life. 27 years go by and Thomas (Robert Downey, jr.) is a hard-working business man, who is in a relationship with a young woman (Elisabeth Shu). The relationship isn't going well, for he is driving her away. The four ghosts realize why they are connected to Thomas: They need him to help resolve one thing in their lives before they died. The problem is, in order to help them, they must take over his body.You'll all enjoy this heart warming comedy. I have many times.

This story casts cynicism aside, but it takes a bit of patience to follow. Downey is the only cynic in the film (at the beginning), but after his special encounters with four 'heavenly' strangers, his life and our outlooks are changed a bit- maybe forever. That's the beauty of this movie. It is handled with deft comedy (Downey's physical comedy as the result of souls invading his body is on a par with Chaplin and Keaton), but it is also one of the most loving stories, with truly loving characters, I've ever seen. The four vignettes with Sizemore, Grodin, Woodard, and Sedgewick are quite nice- and for me, the final two with Sedgewick and Woodard are bewitching.

Another man steals a valuable item from a 10 year-old boy, feels guilty, but is unable to return the item.  A low-income single mother puts her three children to bed, then hurries off to work the night shift.  Another woman has the opportunity to tell her boyfriend she loves him, but fails to take it.  Then POOF!  They're dead, and find themselves to be ghosts with unresolved issues in their lives.  Mysteriously, they find that their souls are forced to stay within about 10 feet of a baby named Thomas, and hang out with him as his ""imaginary friends"" until he's 8 years old, at which point they still hang out with him, but are invisible to him.  When Thomas is an adult, the four souls find they're supposed to have Thomas help them resolve the one major issue they wish they could have resolved before they died.  Not surprisingly, they reappear to him as an adult.This is not only a great idea for a movie plot, it's well executed with excellent acting, good humor, and good cinematography.  The five major actors were all a pleasure to watch, in particular, Robert Downy Jr., as the grown up Thomas Reilly who did some amazing physical comedy.  The child actors were great at conveying emotion, particularly the boy who plays the school age Thomas Reilly, and Lavar David Levingston who plays the 4 year-old son of the single mother.  Most plot twists are predictable, but if you had as much fun as I did watching, you'll easily overlook that.If you had the good fortune to be alive at the end of the movie, you'll realize that you still have the chance to resolve the issues in your life, without waiting until you're a ghost and having to cajole a living person to do it for you.

Hell's bells, he'll even throw in a believable foreign accent if it's a period piece (Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition),Restoration, the upcoming SHERLOCK HOLMES movie). His skills as an actor are so bonafide that, even in lighthearted flicks, there is a weight to his performance. HEART AND SOULS, coming out in 1993 and expanded from a student film short titled SEVEN SOULS, is a fantasy comedy, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays the lead character, breathing good life and substance into what for other actors would've been a hackneyed role.Um, this feels a bit silly, since this film came out such a while ago, but here comes the plot SPOILERS alert.The first half hour of the film introduces four strangers during one fateful evening in 1959, San Francisco: Julia (Kyra Sedgwick), a cocktail waitress who has just spurned an offer of marriage; Harrison (Charles Grodin), a mild-mannered librarian with aspirations of singing opera (but who chickens out of his audition); Milo (Tom Sizemore), a small time hood who comes to rue his latest petty thief; and Penny (Alfre Woodard), a single mother who ventures out for her night shift gig. They all end up on the same bus, and if you believe in omens, then that sign on the bus indicating ""4- Terminal"" probably bodes inauspiciously for these passengers. Minutes later, the bus careens off a bridge and the passengers die. We know this because their spirits promptly rise up out of the bus.At the same moment and nearby, a baby named Thomas is born - and the four ghosts find themselves inexplicably gravitating toward him. And as time went on, Thomas's parents would fondly marvel at their unusual toddler, who often seemed to be chortling over nothing (but we know better). One such instance, when the baby wobbles out of the living room, his dad shakes his head: ""Guess he's off to laugh at the kitchen now, huh?""Young Thomas, naturally, is the only who can see and hear his ghostly guardians. When Thomas is seven, his strange behavior finally has the grown-ups thinking that he's disturbed (it doesn't help that Milo has the kid placing bets on the racetrack and flipping pages of Playboy magazines). The concerned ghosts, after some agonizing, decide to leave Thomas be so that he can lead a normal kid's life, and so they fade out.Twenty seven years later, Thomas Reilly has grown up a ruthless bank executive specializing in foreclosing on bankruptcies. What's more, his commitment phobia threatens to sabotage things with his gorgeous girlfriend Anne (Elizabeth Shue), who wants their relationship to head somewhere. Meanwhile, the four souls have remained anchored to Thomas and are distressed over how their boy has turned out to be such an ayhole.I imagine it must've been deadly dull for these spectral foursome, trapped in Thomas's company for so long and not knowing why. Thirty-four years later, the ""why"" is answered in the form of the very bus driver (David Paymer) who had killed them accidentally. Seems dude has become a ferryman for the dead, and so what if he's tardy by fifteen or twenty years in picking up these four souls? Bus driver informs them that they were supposed to have used the boy as a vehicle to ""do the one thing you would've done before you died."" Except that now it's too late and they have to get on the bus to the afterlife. Of course, bus driver is guilted into giving the ghosts a brief extension on earth.CHAPLIN had already showcased Robert Downey, Jr.'s flair for physical comedy, so HEART AND SOULS merely adds a punctuation mark. The suddenly frantic ghosts find it a challenge to manifest themselves to Thomas and then to convince him that they're not figments of his childhood imagination. And then they have to deal with Thomas's reluctance to help and his anger at them for abandoning him. So, to ""persuade"" him, they take turns possessing his body. The boardroom scene will remind some of Steve Martin in All of Me as Downey takes on playing a coy young woman and then a tough street thug. The funniest possession scene, though, is when Penny takes over Thomas, and Downey has to play an irate black woman (""You want me to get loud, I will GET loud!"").Tonally, HEART AND SOULS bears echoes of Downey's earlier filmChances Are, also a fantasy comedy. Both films demonstrate that Downey can handle himself in frothy screwballs. There's always been a certain playfulness about the guy, anyway, which one can sense even in frenetic action films likeIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition).Credit where credit is due, with this film, it's not just about Downey. HEART AND SOULS boasts a marvelous ensemble cast working seamlessly together. The chemistry among Sedgwick, Woodard, Grodin, Sizemore, and Downey pays off with several funny moments and a surprisingly strong emotional impact. Two tiny highlights which musically demonstrate this rapport are the two fantastic ""Walk Like A Man"" sequences. There's an old-fashioned feel to this film, and I mean that in a good way. I think that Frank Capra, master of sentimentality, probably would've dug this picture. He probably would've been down with the mawkish score, too - even if the score is one of the very few issues I have with the movie, feeling it at times to be too manipulative. It also doesn't pay to think too much about how certain subplots wrap up perhaps too tidily (ie: Penny resolving her unfinished business).Not that this'll ever happen, but a word of advice, in case it does: if you happen to glimpse a spectral green and white bus heading towards you as it phases thru solid objects, there's no point in scampering. To quote the stunned heavenly bus driver: ""They're tryin' to lose me?"" You'd do better to be the chasee in an L.A. police car chase (but don't do that either).",4,"""Guess he's off to laugh at the kitchen now, huh?""",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,5876,"['Robert',

Troubled, certainly, but judge not, etc.  I don't particularly want to become mired in the personal lives of Hollywood actors anyway, good, bad or indifferent.This movie has fantastic additional actors in it as well.  Charles Grodin, Tom Sizemore (another troubled one) and Elisabeth Shue.  The prinicple of the movie is that these four people are accidentally killed in a bus crash (5 including the bus driver) and they then get connected - ghost/spirit wise - to a baby being born at that instant (Robert Downey, Jr.).  They follow them through his life, only learning very late in the game what they are there for.  I won't go into too much, and I haven't read if any of the other 29 reviewers already gave it away.

My television was left on for several hours while cleaning and I happened to catch it during the first 30 minutes and I was immediately spellbound. I have always adored time pieces (the 19th century, the 20's thru the 70's, etc.) and ""Heart & Souls"" is knee-deep in the hoopla of 50's fashion and its timely music.The movie stars Academy Award nominated Robert Downey, Jr. as a 30's businessman trapped with 4 ghosts who follow him, watching over him since birth. Incidentally, Thomas Reilly, Downey's character, was born the same minute in 1959 that the actual ghosts died, causing some strange reaction which blocks the ghosts' spirits not to ascend to Heaven, leaving them behind to clandestinely care for Thomas for the next 30 years.This film is touching, with constant slaps of comedy. The ensemble includes Kyra Sedgwick of ""Closure"", Elisabeth Shue, the older sister of Andrew Shue of ""Melrose Place"" and the very talented and underrated Alfred Woodard. With this pairing, you will be lost in the magic of this movie. It will make you believe in love again and teach you to love the ones you have......no matter their circumstances.

In this movie, four people die prematurely in a bus accident - OK, four people plus the bus driver whose mind was preoccupied with sex and instead of watching where he was driving, he swerved off the bridge.  All of these four people had some unfinished business, so they remain earthbound.  They find themselves attached to a body of a kid and stick around until he's all grown up.  Not knowing at first what to do, or the reason for them being earthbound, they are attempting to be of help to the kid, but seeing that they are causing him more problems than help, they stop interfering with his life and mind their own business, still wondering why are they stuck.Eventually, it is revealed to them that they were still earthbound so that they could resolve one thing that would've made a difference in their lives.  Now, the challenge begins, because it is not just a matter of doing the thing, but about overcoming inner obstacle, and having guts to follow one's heart.  After all, that is what life is about, that is what every day is about - having the courage to follow one's heart, having the courage to listen to one's soul - and in this movie it is a team-spirit of one individual helping another to do that one thing that would've given meaning to his life, that would have left him enriched and empowered in some way, that would've justified the reason he had the body in the first place.  One may here also developed a new appreciation for one's body and one's life on earth because there are some things that just can't be done without it.The characters and the cast in this movie are utterly delightful and as you watch the movie, it's not only that you may enjoy the movie, but perhaps it helps you to look at your life in a different way and consider what it is that you would like your life to stand for and to just go for it.The movie is not only heartwarming but also full of humorous tidbits and at the end of the movie there's a part with B.B.

After all, it's not so often that one feels quite so shamelessly manipulated by a movie yet remains wearing a smile to the end.The four actors comprising the four &quot;limbo-ed&quot; souls are excellent in their own right, with Tom Sizemore being especially good in a comical role quite unlike his other star turns. Elizabeth Shue must be one of my favourite heroines (you could tell she had it even back in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;), and it is downright unbelievable that she hasn't appeared in any major releases as of late. She is utterly winning in her appearance here.
