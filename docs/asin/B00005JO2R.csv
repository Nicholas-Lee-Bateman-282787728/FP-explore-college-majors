Because it was a featured on a radio contest episode of Salute Your Shorts!, one of my favorite TV shows ever. I just saw Rilo Kiley last Monday (an amazing band, by the way) and for those of you who don't know, Blake Sennett who played ""Pinsky"" (the kid who replaced Michael after he myseriously left the series) plays lead guitar along side the beautiful Jenny Lewis. In any case, seeing him reminded me how much I loved the show and how badly I wish they would release it on DVD. Pete & Pete is a good start, but please, Nickelodeon, make this your next release.

I could connect and sympathize with the characters in a way that today's children probably can't identify with their television icons.  The themes center around learning how to get along with each other and how to deal with life.  How many kids' shows today will actually touch on the topic of divorce, let alone a child dealing with their single parent's love interests?
