Dennis Leary should stick to acting, because, having written this piece of dreck, should he decide to write full time, he will be spending a lot of time in the unemployment line.The premise is simple. A low life, dumb and inept petty thief, played with some saving grace by Dennis Leary, steals a famous painting that he is supposed to resell to an anonymous buyer at a remote location. Accompanied by his working class girlfriend, Sandra Bullock, who does all she can with this thankless role, they go to a location near the drop off point, only they get there before the drop off day and need a place to stay. They move temporarily into a mansion, whose owners are away. A rich and curious neighbor comes over, but they manage to convince the neighbor that they are friends of the owner and are there as invited guests.Meanwhile, the FBI is hot on their trail with a team headed up by Yaphet Kotto, an actor too good to be in this film. To make a long story short, Bullock wants Leary to go straight. He waffles. The neighbor goes for Bullock. She finds herself attracted to him but is torn by loyalty to Leary. She waffles. A local kid comes up with some dirt on the neighbor that he shares with Leary. This gives Leary the ammunition he needs to save the day, when the FBI finally catches up with them.
