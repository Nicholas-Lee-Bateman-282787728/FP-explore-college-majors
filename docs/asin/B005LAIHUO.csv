1473978,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B005LAIHUO,Ace Reader,"[6, 10]","Director Bryan Singer's long awaited fantasy adventure, ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is finally here, and it's better than I expected, but not that great either. I heard about ""Jack the Giant Killer"" early last year (2012), then nothing more. Now I know what happened. It was scheduled for release, June 15, 2012, but was delayed until now because of production problems. Many adjustments were made to the original films screenplay including title change. This film is very entertaining BUT, I'm disappointed in it because it lacks the magic, emotion, and scary (giant awe), I was hoping for in a well crafted and told giant story. Instead, I got to watch a poorly rendered CGI giant eat his boogers, another one fart, and the two-headed one belch and argue with himself continually. This could have been so much better. It reminded me of the CGI work done in the 1995 fantasy film, ""Jumanji"". Also; These giants are not respectable or scary giants in any way. They are all ugly, behave immature and are bumbling and stupid. They end up being flat with no presence, unengaging and mostly boring. I wanted to be thrilled by these giants. I was not.This films story started off promising enough. It begins with the re-telling of the ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" story told separately, to two small children (Jack and Princess Isabelle), then jumps forward ten years and their grow-up. The hero Jack (played by English actor Nicholas Hoult, recently seen in 2012 ""Warm Bodies""), saves the heroine, Princess Isabelle (played by English actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who you may remember as the young Sophie in 2006 ""The Illusionist""), from drunk bar ruffians, while she's out (incognito), mingling with her subjects at a bar. Isabelle is then safely whisked off (away from Jack), on horseback to her palace by her handsome and able Captain of the Guard, Elmont (preformed by talented Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, known for his recent staring role in Oscar nominated 2012 ""The Impossible""). McGregor's character, Elmont seems to have more of a hero role in this story then Hoult's character Jack does. McGregor's acting is solid giving this film a serious feel. Isabelle's father, the king is played by English actor Ian McShane, who was made to wear armor in this film that is by far the worst looking armor I have ever seen in a movie, in my life. All the costumes in this film are hideous. So much so that it was distracting, throwing me out of the movie and back into the audience many times throughout this film. The enjoyable villain, Lord Roderick is preformed excellently by Stanley Tucci. He's great and did a wonderful job preforming his character.The action is great throughout this film. This is where this film really shines and the entertaining factor comes in. There is an exciting giants-against-the-humans war near the end that had me on the edge of my seat. I LOVED the beanstalk! All the scenes with the beanstalk in it are great!""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is ultimately a fail for me mostly because I was confused by the screenplays inability to make up it's mind if it was a gross kids movie or a serious, well made adult adventure fantasy/action romance. Even with all of this films problems, I still enjoyed parts of it, and the ending is perfect...but I can't recommend it. Something went horribly wrong with this film during it's production, and it shows. The two-headed giant may be the cause. Too many cooks in the kitchen make a mess! In this films case...too many writers. It's too bad. It could have been great. If you do decide to see this entertaining mess...Enjoy!Release date: 1 March 2013Running time: 114 minutesRated: PG-13 ~ for brief language, fantasy action and violence.Fantasy/AdventureGrade C+",3,Fee-fi-fo-fum...I smell the blood of an Englishman!,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,3717,"['Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'long', 'awaited', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'finally', 'here', 'better', 'expected', 'not', 'great', 'heard', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Killer', 'early', 'last', 'year', '2012', 'then', 'nothing', 'more', 'Now', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'scheduled', 'release', 'June', '15', '2012', 'was', 'delayed', 'now', 'production', 'problems', 'Many', 'adjustments', 'were', 'made', 'original', 'films', 'screenplay', 'including', 'title', 'change', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'BUT', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'magic', 'emotion', 'scary', 'giant', 'awe', 'was', 'hoping', 'well', 'crafted', 'told', 'giant', 'story', 'Instead', 'got', 'watch', 'poorly', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'giant', 'eat', 'boogers', 'one', 'fart', 'two-headed', 'one', 'belch', 'argue', 'continually', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'reminded', 'CGI', 'work', 'done', '1995', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Jumanji', 'Also', 'giants', 'are', 'not', 'respectable', 'scary', 'giants', 'way', 'are', 'ugly', 'behave', 'immature', 'are', 'bumbling', 'stupid', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'flat', 'presence', 'unengaging', 'mostly', 'boring', 'wanted', 'be', 'thrilled', 'giants', 'was', 'not.This', 'films', 'story', 'started', 'off', 'promising', 'enough', 're-telling', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'story', 'told', 'separately', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'Jack', 'Princess', 'Isabelle', 'then', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'grow-up', 'hero', 'Jack', 'played', 'English', 'actor', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'recently', 'seen', '2012', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'heroine', 'Princess', 'Isabelle', 'played', 'English', 'actress', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'young', 'Sophie', '2006', 'Illusionist', 'drunk', 'bar', 'ruffians', 'out', 'incognito', 'mingling', 'subjects', 'bar', 'Isabelle', 'then', 'safely', 'whisked', 'off', 'away', 'Jack', 'horseback', 'palace', 'handsome', 'able', 'Captain', 'Guard', 'Elmont', 'preformed', 'talented', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'known', 'recent', 'staring', 'role', 'Oscar', 'nominated', '2012', 'Impossible', 'McGregor', 'character', 'Elmont', 'have', 'more', 'hero', 'role', 'story', 'then', 'Hoult', 'character', 'Jack', 'McGregor', 'acting', 'solid', 'giving', 'film', 'serious', 'feel', 'Isabelle', 'father', 'king', 'played', 'English', 'actor', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'who', 'was', 'made', 'wear', 'armor', 'film', 'far', 'worst', 'looking', 'armor', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'life', 'costumes', 'film', 'are', 'hideous', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'distracting', 'throwing', 'movie', 'back', 'audience', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'villain', 'Lord', 'Roderick', 'preformed', 'excellently', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'great', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'preforming', 'character.The', 'action', 'great', 'film', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'shines', 'entertaining', 'factor', 'exciting', 'giants-against-the-humans', 'war', 'end', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'LOVED', 'beanstalk', 'scenes', 'beanstalk', 'are', 'great', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'ultimately', 'fail', 'mostly', 'was', 'confused', 'screenplays', 'inability', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'was', 'gross', 'kids', 'movie', 'serious', 'well', 'made', 'adult', 'adventure', 'fantasy/action', 'romance', 'Even', 'films', 'problems', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'ending', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Something', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'film', 'production', 'two-headed', 'giant', 'may', 'be', 'cause', 'Too', 'many', 'cooks', 'kitchen', 'make', 'mess', 'films', 'case', 'too', 'many', 'writers', 'too', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'do', 'decide', 'see', 'entertaining', 'mess', 'Enjoy', 'Release', 'date', '1', 'March', '2013Running', 'time', '114', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', '~', 'brief', 'language', 'fantasy', 'action', 'violence.Fantasy/AdventureGrade', 'C+']",Jack the Giant Slayer

1474008,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B005LAIHUO,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","If there is something that films are missing in today's world, it is a sense of ADVENTURE. That feeling you felt as a kid after you watched The Lone Ranger or Zorro on television, or Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Lord of the Rings. Those are the kinds of movies that make you want to go out and do something heroic and daring.Jack the Giant Slayer, for the briefest of moments, captured that adventure.A pity, then, that it's screenplay was poor, it's dialogue was clunky, and that it was overloaded with CGI, though, admittedly, it was good CGI. Let me list some cons. The screenplay is filled with plot holes, from melting down a giant's heart to make a crown, to the incredibly short time it took Jack, Elmont, and company to climb the beanstalk. The dialogue is often stilted and unnatural, though the one-liners are suitably heroic (I loved Eddie Marsan's line ""Choke on my bones!""). There is a Deux ex Machina so implausible it almost ruins the movie. Bryan Singer, an indisputably great director -- if only for the brilliantThe Usual Suspects, shows a peculiar lack of restraint here. There is so much CGI on display here it makes The Hobbit and Man of Steel look almost subtle.Admittedly, the giant's animation and rendering _was_ very good. They were so hideous and disturbing you could almost smell them. But too much of a good thing is not wonderful. It is childish. And Jack the Giant Slayer is a very childish movie. Other cons include a sag in pace towards the middle of the film, and just way too many bodily humour/gross out gags, courtesy of the hideous giants.But hey, who says childish is bad? This is a movie based off of a magic children's fairy tale. I wasn't expecting the next Lord of the Rings here! Jack the Giant Slayer is entertaining in it's own right.First off, I was very impressed by the cast. Nicholas Hoult is perfect as the brave farmboy turned hero, adeptly mastering the awkward bravery and charm of Jack. Eleanor Tomlinson wasn't bad either, but her character lacked depth, foregoing a personality for lots of screams during action scenes. Stanley Tucci, on the other hand, is so deliciously evil you could almost sense him twirling his moustache offscreen. Can you say SCENE STEALER? This is another case of a good actor saving a thin story. As a worthy foe to Tucci's treacherous Rodrigo, we have Ewan MacGregor's brave and noble Sir Elmont, who gets most of the best scenes and heroic oneliners. Ian McShane is typically excellent, lending gravitas to his dodgy lines. The biggest surprise for me was Eddie Marsan, who, in his short role, became the coolest guy in the film. I would never have pictured Marsan as an action-hero, but by George is he believable!And let's not forget Bill Nighy. Nighy is one of the most diverse, distinct, adaptable, and entertaining actors working today. No matter what the quality of the film, you can count on Nighy to turn in a memorable and entertaining performance. He is typically on par as the evil, two-headed giant Fallon.Second, I was VERY impressed by the costume and set design. Everywhere you look, there is a beautiful, rich, believable, practical, stunning costume, from Jack's muddied leather clothes to the rich golden robes of the King. There was clearly a lot of work put into designing the giants, as each looks distinct and suitable hideous. Their armour, crude but effective, looks believable and realistic. The scenes that take place on Terra Firma are excellently shot. The medieval towns, castles, villages, and camps are all an effective blend of fanciful and realistic.Third, though there is too much of it, the CGI is still excellent. The giant's are incredibly realized, so finely detailed you can see the pores on their skin, the hairs in their nose, and the little latch that holds their breastplate together. This ""unrealistic realism"" gives the grand battle scenes more effective, as the giants become all the more menacing in our eyes.That brings us to the climactic battle scene. It was perhaps the high point of the movie; epic, dangerous, explosive, riveting, and fast-paced. The giants were evil and threatening, and the humans were relateable and suitably awesome. Refreshingly, it took place in daylight, and was not soaked in lightning and rain like so many other movies. Let me just say that, while it won't rank in the Top 10 battles anywhere, it was a very fun, effects heavy, completely OTT set piece....In conclusion, Jack the Giant Slayer isn't perfect. It's marketing was poor and therefore, it didn't connect at the box office. Critics slammed it for being predictable, cliched, overloaded with special effects, and childish. Valid points all. But all that criticism was perhaps uncalled for.Jack the Giant is a fairy tale. It's got the requisite farmboy/hero, princess, gallant knight, evil advisor, and giants that make a fairy tale. Like a fairy tale, we've heard and seen it all before and many of us have grown out of it. But like a fairy tale, Jack the Giant Slayer is beautiful to look at, and the action is the sort of stuff that giants, knights, and a 150 million dollar budget was made for. It even touches us at the heart, sometimes. Other pros include great CGI and a noble cast! The production design is excellent, and John Ottman's score ain't half bad.So, yeah, it's not perfect. But let yourself go ride with Jack, slay giants, rescue princesses, and have a giant of a time.

1474010,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B005LAIHUO,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[4, 8]","The fantasy genre has been in a bit of a rut for the past 5 or so years.  The young adult fiction genre is rife with a glut of derivate sword-and-sorcery series looking to piggy-back off of the success of Harry Potter, and they are largely becoming more and more indistinguishable from each other.  A great deal of the film industry's material, unfortunately, also comes from this tired pool of bland teenage protagonists, rehashed plot points and settings, and frequently embarrassing attempts at edginess.  It takes a stellar fantasy film nowadays to be able to be noticed as a gem among slag.Jack the Giant Slayer is definitely not one of these films.  It has neither the enthusiasm to be a faithful retelling of the fairy tale, nor does it have the talent backing it to make it an intriguing retelling.  It simply exists, a film that doesn't particularly seem to care if it is watched or not, just as long as it makes Warner Bros. some money.While it's doubtful that anyone needs the plot summarized for them, Jack the Giant Slayer stars the titular hero Jack, who does numerous tedious things, meets tedious people, and slays surprisingly few tedious giants.  He is played (tediously), by Nicholas Hoult, who has mastered the art of ""green-screen face"", the act of staring blankly past the camera with a look of slack-jawed not-quite-amazement.  I suspect the producer was dangling his check in front of him.  As you might expect, Jack is given some beans by a monk, the purpose of which is to keep the out of the hands of the nefarious Lord Roderick.  Roderick also happens to be well on his way to marrying the princess, Isabella, and becoming heir to the king's throne.  Despite his all too short amount of screen time, Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job as Roderick, adding some much needed hamminess to a film that takes itself much too seriously.  He's arrogant and outrageous in the classic style of Disney villains, and his scenes are where the film shines brightest.The role of love interest is taken by Isabella herself, played by Eleanor Tomlinson.  Much like her co-star, she plays a character as bland as sawdust, leaving no doubt in the viewer's mind that these two tedious characters will likely fall tediously in love, have a tedious wedding by the end of the film, and likely end up with more than one tedious child.  Her dissatisfaction with being made to marry Roderick brings her to Jack's dump of a home, right before he manages to accidently get one of the beans wet, growing a massive beanstalk that carries her away.  Poor guy.The king is understandably upset, and sends Jack, Roderick, and Ewan McGregor (playing not-Obi-wan Kenobi) up the beanstalk to retrieve her.  Roderick is all too happy to volunteer, as his plans involve taking control of the hundreds of sky-bound CGI giants, and using them to conquer the kingdom.  While this second act should have been spectacular, considering the expense taken to render the massive environments of the giants' world, nothing in particular really sticks.  Forests and rocky caves are the name of the game here, and there's never anything truly new to look at.  Even the sense of scale is lacking - being in a giant's world should be fascinating to see characters interact with, as even the simplest tasks can be impossible when they suddenly struggle to scale one stair-step.  But despite the fact that this world is built for beings 20 times larger than they are, this size difference is rarely even noticeable.  The film simply doesn't emphasize it, perhaps in an attempt to be as boring as its main character.I'll give the film credit for a fine example of faithfulness to the culture and dress of the time period.  Beyond that, the finale is well done, and much better than the boring hour that precedes it.  But none of that can make up for the fact that this is, really, a boring, pointless film.  The story of Jack and the Beanstalk has been told numerous times, from the classic and lovable Disney animated short, to the odd and overlong, but fascinating Jim Henson movie Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story.  Jack the Giant Slayer, on the other hand, has neither charm nor a worthwhile thing to add to the story, and no real reason to exist.

The other amazing fact is that nearly all CGI shots of Giants take place in broad Daylight = with fine details of action/fights clearly visible (Godzilla producers should take note - it obviously can be done - and we will expect this Level of CGI detail in Godzilla II)!With all this going for the film, I really wonder why it was such a BIG flop?  It obviously could not find its 'right' audience.  The title surely didn't help (sounds hopelessly 'corny' although there was a stop-motion fantasy film from 1961 called 'Jack the Giant Killer' but I don't think that was the inspiration for this film).  Perhaps potential audience goers also got confused once they heard this was a re-telling of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" = I.e. probably kiddie fare? - but the intense direction by Bryan Singer (and the fierce designs  for the violent Giant/Ogres) was obviously aimed at an older demographic group - too bad, since this is a much better film than the embarrassingly dismal Box office receipts would imply!

This has far more depth than I expected.  Although the special effects are great, the movie has a good story, action, romance, horror, and more.  Loosely following the fairytale ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", Jack receives magic beans for the sale of a horse (cow in the fairytale), but the similarity ends there.  Oh sure there is an ornate egg, but not solid gold and no goose that laid it.  Nonetheless a great story and script, wonderful casting, exceptional acting, superb directing, excellent  F/X, and lovely music.  Jack's uncle is mad with him taking beans for his horse, and throws them on the floor.  One goes through the floor and grows.  While the princess visits him for an earlier rescue she ends up in his house at the top of a beanstalk in the land of horrible giants.  Jack informs the king and a group of soldiers are sent to rescue her.  So as not to spoil the rest, suffice it to say the movie is well worth viewing and owning and I plan to get the Blu-ray once it drops from the absolutley ridiculous price of about thirty-five dollars to under fifteen dollars.Recommendations:Stardust,Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief,Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters,Clash of the Titans (2010),Immortals,Jason And The Argonauts, andJack the Giant Killer(cheesy by todays standards, but still fun).CA Luster",5,Jack the Giant Slayer,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1646,"['Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer114', 'minAdventure/FantasyMarch', '1', '2013USADirector', 'Bryan', 'SingerWriters', 'Darren', 'Lemke', 'Christopher', 'McQuarrie', 'screenplay', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Stanley', 'TucciAn', 'excellent', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'trailers', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'reviews', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'expected', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'action', 'romance', 'horror', 'more', 'Loosely', 'following', 'fairytale', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'Jack', 'magic', 'beans', 'sale', 'horse', 'cow', 'fairytale', 'similarity', 'there', 'Oh', 'sure', 'ornate', 'egg', 'not', 'solid', 'gold', 'goose', 'laid', 'great', 'story', 'script', 'wonderful', 'casting', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'superb', 'directing', 'excellent', 'F/X', 'lovely', 'music', 'Jack', 'uncle', 'mad', 'taking', 'beans', 'horse', 'floor', 'One', 'floor', 'grows', 'princess', 'visits', 'earlier', 'rescue', 'up', 'house', 'top', 'beanstalk', 'land', 'horrible', 'giants', 'Jack', 'king', 'group', 'soldiers', 'are', 'sent', 'rescue', 'So', 'not', 'spoil', 'rest', 'suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'owning', 'plan', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'absolutley', 'ridiculous', 'price', 'thirty-five', 'dollars', 'fifteen', 'dollars.Recommendations', 'Stardust', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'Clash', 'Titans', '2010', 'Immortals', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'andJack', 'Giant', 'Killer', 'cheesy', 'todays', 'standards', 'still', 'fun', 'Luster']",Jack the Giant Slayer

It was just an expensive film to make, approximately $190 million. Based on the fact, that Warner Brothers Studios has numerous movies (""Harry Potter"", ""Dark Knight"", ""The Hobbit"") in its pocket that will make up for whatever loss, if any, ""Jack"" sustains, you should not weep for them. Although, you may consider whether or not to take the time to go see it in theaters or get the bluray/DVD.Why not! It's a fun movie. Not to mention, it is one of those rare movies that anybody in the family can watch and enjoy. There are some dark moments in the film and some mildly scary moments, but it's all fun. We all know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and now, with today's incredible technology, we can see this fairy tale, mostly imagined up to this point, in vivid 3-D and live action or CG action.Director Bryan Singer knows a thing or two about bring us fairy tale characters. He's directed four X-Men films and a Superman film. So, telling the story of Jack and his magical beans is right up his alley. We all know the story and Singer managed to keep those same elements in the film. The best part about ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is the script; until the ending. Most of the time, these type movies are made just to appease the visual desires of a film-goer, but this film has many surprising twists and turns. Although, it isn't without a little bit of criticism from this reviewer.The first two-thirds of the film are filled with surprises and quality writing that keeps the audience riveted. When the humans enter the world of the giants, I found the whole experience to be incredibly realized and reminiscent of the movie ""King Kong"". It was amazing and frightening at the same time, especially when one giant tracks down a running human as if he were catching a mouse and picked him up as if his catch was pretty much insignificant.My beef comes from the choices made in the final third of the film. They had built up so much possibility with script direction. There was the world of the giants. There was the love story between Jack and Princess Isabelle. There was the massive treasure that the giants had horded overtime from the humans. Yet, I think that they chose the less interesting of directions for the film. Battle; not in the more interesting giant world, but in the human world. The giants are really just mindlessly driven to battle. They have no heart-filled reason to do so, they just want to destroy and steal. We've seen so many battles on film in so many movies and they are always less interesting than a human motivated storyline. There was a reason for battle in ""Braveheart"".

1474075,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIHUO,C. Sawin,"[13, 23]","""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is similar to taking the familiar tale ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and sloppily smashing it together with the 1962 film ""Jack the Giant Killer."" A commoner named Jack (Nicholas Hoult) trades his uncle's horse for beans that turn into giant beanstalks when exposed to water. The beanstalks serve as the sole passageway from our world to the giants towering above us in the sky, who have been aching to get back down to earth to resume their ongoing war with the humans. After Jack gives the adventure seeking Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) shelter in his shack during a storm, a loose bean gets wet and carries Jack's shack along with the princess up into the sky. Isabelle's father King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) sends his best men including Elmont (Ewan McGregor), Crawe (Eddie Marsan), Isabelle's arranged fianc&eacute; Roderick (Stanley Tucci), and Roderick's right hand man Wicke (Ewen Bremner) while Jack volunteers his services to rescue the princess and prevent the giants from destroying everyone and everything in the land.The movie begins with both Jack and Isabelle being told the story of the giants at a young age, but every visual illustrating the tale is pure CG. This wouldn't be much of an issue, but the CG looks incredibly dated. If you've ever played video games and still own consoles that aren't jam packed with wi-fi, hard drives, and endless forms of media then odds are the graphics from older games look pretty cheesy today. In the span of five years or less technology improves dramatically when it comes to computer generation. The special effects in the opening of ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" look the way Playstation 2 graphics look now. It's not necessarily bad, but it appears to be from a time most people don't care to remember.While the cinematography is fairly impressive at times as you travel at inhuman speed across a roaming countryside or have this fantastic view of the king's castle as you seem to look down from the heavens, most of the special effects look out of place. Similar motion capture technology used in Robert Zemeckis' CG films (""The Polar Express,"" ""Beowulf,"" and ""A Christmas Carol"") was used in ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" to bring these giants to life. Those effects look fine when the world they inhabit is also computer generated, but look kind of awkward when they're interacting with a realistic world. Unfortunately nothing ever looks genuine as you can clearly tell when a green screen is used and when pieces of beanstalk look plastic when they aren't computer generated. It just seems like the special effects are one step behind most recent films. Maybe the film sitting on the shelf for eight months can contribute to that.What's more is that this is supposed to be an adventure, but a dangerous journey shouldn't feel so run of the mill. The film is kind of boring most of the time since it follows ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" almost religiously and then even the giant kills aren't anything all that great. The film is PG-13, but probably could have pushed for a hard PG. Other than, ""bastard,"" being yelled once and a human being thrown on the ground by a giant on-screen every gruesome moment is shown off-screen. The film doesn't feel dark enough to garner a PG-13 rating, so it results in feeling extremely watered down. Most of the characters aren't given a lot of time to properly portray good and evil. Jack and Isabelle are basically exactly the same character except one is rich and the other is poor, Elmont starts off being kind of smart-mouthed but eventually turns into a clich&eacute; soldier, and the gap between Roderick's teeth is way more offensive than anything the character does in the film.It's more than a little disappointing when it finally comes time for the humans to fight against the giants. Other than throwing bells the size of houses and trees that are lit on fire the giants don't seem to pose much of a threat. There's a scene where everyone is trying to prevent the giants from getting into King Brahmwell's kingdom. There's a drawbridge that the human's are trying to close and the giants are trying to keep open. A giant should be big enough and strong enough to overpower at least 30 men on his own. There are what looks like maybe 200 humans max trying to pull that drawbridge closed and 20 giants trying to keep it open and somehow that's evenly matched for nearly ten minutes straight. Either all of the King's men are hopped up on some ancient version of steroids cooked up with nothing but twigs and berries or those are the weakest giants in anything ever.""Jack the Giant Slayer"" feels so plain and ordinary and only came to fruition to try and capitalize on films like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Chock full of paper thin characters and dated special effects, ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is mostly just extremely predictable and seems massively unnecessary. Just think director Bryan Singer is trying to incorporate the same motion capture technology he used in this film on ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" Imagine how much of a disappointment that will be if it's anything like this.",2,An unfulfilling and unimaginative adventure,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,5139,"['Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'similar',

1474117,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B005LAIHUO,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","A rather tasteful, bloodless version of the famous fairy tale.  It looks lovely and everything runs smoothly (more or less).  The fact that it's pat and perfunctory was its undoing.  I can see why it was a box office dud.  There's very little magic to be had.  The singing harp was present and accounted for but quickly passed over.  Most of the elements one would expect from this story were cast aside for a tiny bit of romance, brief adventure, and an almost epic battle.  It didn't help that the feature began with a whiplash effect between Jack's childhood and that of the princess.  Scenes sped back and forth at an alarming rate, at times the separate conversations folded into one another making it impossible to keep up.  I suppose the director thought this was an interesting gimmick to employ but the result was entirely too cute and confusing.  An odd choice considering the admonishment that was used on Jack ad nauseam: ""don't get distracted!""  Very little imagination went into the making of this movie.  My biggest complaint remains, it was too darn tame (practically sanitized to death).  I expected more backbone, especially considering the subject matter.  As for the cast, Nicholas Hoult made a decent Jack, Eleanor Tomlinson was a lovely princess, and Ian McShane was perfectly cast as the king.  I smiled when I heard Bill Nighy's voice for half of the two-headed giant.  But I couldn't understand why Ewan McGregor deigned to play such a lackluster role that anyone could have done.

1474126,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAIHUO,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[5, 7]","Bryan Singer has never been a filmmaker whose work I've celebrated and adored. It's not that his films aren't entertaining to some degree. However, they always seem to have an issue with pacing, which could just as well be blamed on the writers he chooses to work with. Most of them feel as if they lose their footing in the last act. His latest movie, ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is no different.A younger farmer named Jack (Nicholas Hoult) accidently drops a magic bean under the floorboard of his shack, resulting in a monstrous beanstalk growing into the heavens and bridging the gap between a world of giants and the Earth. The giants want their land back, which was taken from them in battle centuries before. When a princess is caught by the vengeful behemoths, Jack joins the King's(Ian McShane) rescue team to get her back.""Jack The Giant Slayer"" starts off well enough and establishes all the important characters and their motivations. Screenwriters Darren Lemke, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dan Studney even set up a solid foundation for their story to be told through flashbacks to the legendary events of the past that occurred between the giants and the humans.Instead of building up excitement and tension for the climax to the film, Singer manages to wind things down and then rev them up again. He can't seem to find a satisfying or fluid way to end his films. I ultimately blame this on Singer and not the writers because he's the one constant element of each movie of his this tends to happen with (the first two ""X-Men"" movies come to mind).The visual effects for ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" look good for the most part. There are spots that could and should have been better. The beanstalks and their foliage definitely looked animated in many scenes. I always walk away from these types of CGI fests wondering why or how filmmakers would leave certain aspects looking the way they do. I know it ultimately all boils down to budget and a production's deadline.The cast of ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is filled with talented actors who give their all. Nicholas Hoult is enjoyable and likeable as Jack. Ewan McGregor has a lot of fun with his character of Elmont, the witty and loyal protector of the King and his daughter. Stanley Tucci does an excellent job of making you despise the King's devious confidant, Roderick.""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition 16x9 widescreen (2.41:1). The picture quality is clear and vibrant. The 5.1 surround sound is put to good use through the pounding of the giant's walking, the noises of nature, and other eclectic sound effects.There's some interesting bonus material included on the Blu-ray version of ""Jack The Giant Slayer."" An interactive feature entitled ""Becoming a Giant Slayer"" sends you up the beanstalk to enjoy eight different behind-the-scenes featurettes. If you want to watch each one, then you must re-climb the beanstalk every time. Five deleted / alternate scenes are included as well. Lastly, we get a gag reel.""Jack The Giant Slayer"" may lose steam towards the end, but the journey is still exciting and humorous. It's family-friendly fun and blends together fairy tale elements that will appeal to both girls and boys.

1474132,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B005LAIHUO,FNDNreview,"[2, 5]","Jack the Giant Slayer, directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Valkyrie), is the tale of Jack (Nicholas Hoult), a struggling farm boy that happens to meet Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), the adventurous princess of Cloister.  After a priest gives Jack a sack of mystical beans (which shouldn't be touched by water), Jack and Isabelle are suddenly separated during a rain storm when one of the beans grows into the heavens, or in this case, the home of the giants - taking Isabelle with it.  King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) sends a group of his men, including Jack, Elmont (Ewan McGregor) - the leader of the king's army, and Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) - the king's trusted/devious advisor, to retrieve his daughter.  Naturally, matters are complicated when the humans are captured by the giants.  Eddie Marsan and Ewen Bremner also star in supporting roles, while Bill Nighy and John Kassir lend their voices for Fallon, the double-headed leader of the giants.Sadly, this film had a great deal of potential, yet the script suffered mightily from lack of character development, as well as plot depth - which can both be detrimental to the quality of the overall film.  However, Nicholas Hoult (one of the young, up-and-coming actors) saves the day with his fearless prowess and giant slaying ability.  Even though Hoult does have some bland scenes, he isn't to blame for his poorly written character.  Obviously, a film like this is not going to be overly heavy on the dialogue anyway, but still - it would have been nice to see at least one show-stealing scene between ANY of this cast's fine actors.  But, sadly (once again), it never comes.  Ewan McGregor and Ian McShane, two masterful and powerful actors, both have their talents utterly wasted in this film.  Their characters are bland, mediocrely written, and just downright forgettable.Overall, the script stays true enough to the original stories, Jack and the Beanstalk and Jack the Giant Killer - enough so to make for an interesting viewing experience.  While the expectations for fairy tale live action films are low (even though the budgets are typically high), director Bryan Singer makes the best out of this film, and for that he should be commended.  Combine Singer's direction with the visibly pleasing CGI, not to mention a plot that gives the bare minimum amount of information, and we arrive at a perfectly average fairy tale/fantasy film.  It's certainly not as interesting as The Lord of the Rings, but it's also not as frighteningly horrible as 2011's Red Riding Hood.

1474139,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B005LAIHUO,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 0]","When I heard that Bryan Singer was remaking the film &#34;Jack the Giant Killer&#34;, I was a bit surprised.  The original 1962 film was basically a second feature that reunited many of the individuals involved in making the 1958 classic &#34;Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.&#34;  There was the star Kerwin Matthews, the villain Torin Thatcher and the Director, Nathan Juran.  As a matter of fact the only one missing was the genius and special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, who was deemed too expensive to use on this film.  The basic plot was farm boy Jack rescuing a Princess kidnapped by an evil giant being used by main villain Thatcher.  As stated, it was an enjoyable little second feature for 12 year olds (at the time) like me.  I even still have the Dell Comics adaptation.  I couldn't figure why Singer would want to remake this film.Well after seeing it in the movies, it became obvious.  The film, now renamed&#34; Jack the Giant Slayer,&#34; was a combination of the original story and the Jack and the Beanstalk legend.  The special effects are truly excellent.  The film is exciting when Jack and several of the kings soldiers, led by the suave Ewan MacGregor, climb the beanstalk to encounter the giants in their own domain.  The excitement really kicks into high gear when the giants come down to earth and attack the mid-evil kingdom of King Ian McShane.  These scenes are truly incredible to behold and must have looked great on an IMAX screen.Well anyway, concerning the sad fate of this film, it was supposed to be a summer release but was kicked back by Warner Bros. until the following March (supposedly to complete the special effects.)  It opened to mediocre business its first week and was absolutely crushed by Disney's &#34;Oz&#34; the second week.  (I saw both films in the movies and preferred this one although&#34; Oz&#34; was enjoyable as well.)  This film wound up losing millions and continued Bryan Singer's losing streak since leaving the X Men films to make the disappointing &#34;Superman Returns.&#34;  (He is now back at work directing the new X Men film scheduled for release next summer.)The picture and sound on blu-ray are fine.  There are little extras including some deleted scenes (including an excellent scene of Jack running across a giant drawbridge.)  There is also a short gag reel.In conclusion, this is a beautiful looking film with astounding special effects and a truly exciting and rousing conclusion.  It deserved to do much better than it did.  Check it out,  If you enjoy this type of film, I have little doubt that you will enjoy it.",4,An Enjoyable Epic that Deserved a Better Fate,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2592,"['When', 'heard', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'was', 'remaking', 'film', '34', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Killer', '34', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'original', '1962', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'second', 'feature', 'reunited', 'many', 'individuals', 'involved', 'making', '1958', 'classic', '34', 'Seventh', 'Voyage', 'Sinbad.', '34', 'was', 'star', 'Kerwin', 'Matthews', 'villain', 'Torin', 'Thatcher', 'Director', 'Nathan', 'Juran', 'matter', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'missing', 'was', 'genius', 'special', 'effects', 'legend', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'who', 'was', 'deemed', 'too', 'expensive', 'use', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'was', 'farm', 'boy', 'Jack', 'rescuing', 'Princess', 'kidnapped', 'evil', 'giant', 'being', 'used', 'main', 'villain', 'Thatcher', 'stated', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'second', 'feature', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'time', 'even', 'still', 'have', 'Dell', 'Comics', 'adaptation', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'why', 'Singer', 'would', 'want', 'remake', 'film.Well', 'seeing', 'movies', 'became', 'obvious', 'film', 'now', 'renamed', '34', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', '34', 'was', 'combination', 'original', 'story', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'legend', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'exciting', 'when', 'Jack', 'several', 'kings', 'soldiers', 'led', 'suave', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'beanstalk', 'encounter', 'giants', 'own', 'domain', 'excitement', 'really', 'high', 'gear', 'when', 'giants', 'come', 'down', 'earth', 'attack', 'mid-evil', 'kingdom', 'King', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'incredible', 'behold', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'great', 'IMAX', 'screen.Well', 'anyway', 'concerning', 'sad', 'fate', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'summer', 'release', 'was', 'kicked', 'back', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'following', 'March', 'supposedly', 'complete', 'special', 'effects', 'opened', 'mediocre', 'business', 'first', 'week', 'was', 'absolutely', 'crushed', 'Disney', '34', 'Oz', '34', 'second', 'week', 'saw', 'films', 'movies', 'preferred', 'one', '34', 'Oz', '34', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'wound', 'up', 'losing', 'millions', 'continued', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'losing', 'streak', 'leaving', 'X', 'Men', 'films', 'make', 'disappointing', '34', 'Superman', 'Returns.', '34', 'now', 'back', 'work', 'directing', 'new', 'X', 'Men', 'film', 'scheduled', 'release', 'next', 'summer', 'picture', 'sound', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'little', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'excellent', 'scene', 'Jack', 'running', 'giant', 'drawbridge', 'also', 'short', 'gag', 'reel.In', 'conclusion', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'film', 'astounding', 'special', 'effects', 'truly', 'exciting', 'rousing', 'conclusion', 'deserved', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'Check', 'out', 'enjoy', 'type', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'will', 'enjoy']",Jack the Giant Slayer

Denick,"[0, 0]","This movie could have easily been botched, but the producers, writers, and director pulled it off, making for a very entertaining, modernized telling of one of the most classic fairy tales. The person who deserves the most credit is whomever did the casting, because every character in this movie is full to the brim with wonderful personality and charisma - and that goes a long way. I really wanted the characters to succeed because I liked them so much. The subject matter is still a bit terrifying (as was the original fairy tale), so I believe many younger children may be horrified by the sight of these ghoulish giants feasting upon the bones of men, so use your judgment when deciding if your kids can handle this (it's rated PG-13 for a reason, and I personally feel 13 is the perfect age for this movie, maybe 12 or 11 for more mature children).What's really cool is that the story, while vastly elaborated upon (resulting in the two hour run time of the movie), remains true to original, as far as the core elements go. The writers did a nice job of taking the sparse elements of the fairy tale and tastefully enhancing it into a feature length film. The pacing is excellent, making for an entertaining, fun filled ride with plenty of humor and suspense. I also very much appreciated the care with which the fantasy world was created, especially the airborne realm of the giants. As far as the actual behemoths themselves, their CGI rendering is very well done, and their animations and facial expressions are very convincing.The Blu-ray transfer is pretty much perfect, as far as I can tell, with vibrant colors, immaculate detail, and fantastic sound.",4,"Magic relics, you say?

But as he grows to adult hood and life generally sucks he bumps into the local Princess who is on the run from an arranged marriage and as accidents happen, some magic beans Jack had possession of sprout sending a beanstalk off into the sky and carrying the princess off with it.Since most people tend to notice things like giant bean stalks reaching to the heavens, Jack awakes to find the king has shown up and so he tags along with the princess' betrothed ,who (shades of Prince Humperdink)has plans of his own, his lackey and a group of the king's best guards, led by Ewan McGregor. They just have to climb the beanstalk, save the princess and prevent the giants from invading the lands below-before breakfast.Light hearted without being anachronistic this is a silly but fun movie, done with the same mindset as Princess Bride but without all of that film's greatness. The problem with the movie is except for the Humperdink betrothed and McGregor none of the characters really stand out. Even peasant boy jack seems just a little too cardboard to have the rich charm of `Bride. It is cute and silly and fun, but not too terribly memorable.

Rated PG-13 and directed by Bryan Singer (""X-Men""), this ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is well cast, visually exciting, and lots of fun. Computer Generated Imaging has made fantasy stories more and more fantastical; this one is mind-boggling.We admire:* Nicholas Hoult (""Warm Bodies"") is resourceful and resolute as Jack, the nice young man who drops a magic bean and... ""Uh oh,"" gets it WET. Later, as he clambers up that amazing beanstalk, he admits he ""doesn't much like heights.""* Eleanor Tomlinson (""Alice in Wonderland"") is Isabel, an adventurous princess who finds waaaay more adventure than she bargained for.* Ian McShane (""Deadwood"") is the king, ready to marry off his daughter to a much older man in order to achieve peace with a neighboring kingdom. But he pitches right in when his kingdom is under attack.* Stanley Tucci (""The Hunger Games"") makes the perfect bridegroom/villain: ambitious, ruthless and cruel. Once he gets the magic crown, the wedding is off!* Ewan McGregor (""The Impossible"") is our stalwart guardsman Elmont: organized, decisive and brave. It looks like McGregor enjoys being in a comedy for a change.* Bill Nighy (""About Time"") is the lead Giant. He has a little spare head sitting on one shoulder, which offers another point of view.If you take a 12-year-old boy (the perfect demographic) reassure him that there is less than a minute of ""mush."" Otherwise, it's slam-bang action, with lots of spears, arrows, horses, drawbridges, armor, swords, boiling oil, burning trees and other weapons of the middle ages.I can't think of a thing I would change; 114 minutes flew by. The battle scenes aren't too long, the giants are appropriately icky, our hero is valiant and the heroine is plucky.

1474223,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B005LAIHUO,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 1]","Maybe great for preteens.  But for adults this is just plain not good.  I was disappointed by the effects, the characters and the action.  So...pretty much everything.Director Bryan Singer, the man behind X-Men and X2 (the ""good"" movies of the franchise), truly disappointed me with his spin on Jack and the Beanstalk.  Other than a few somewhat funny moments, this movie was simply moderately entertaining and largely a letdown.  This is just my opinion though.  So if you want to cut the criticism short and hear a review from someone who had a more positive experience with this movie, then please read the top rated reviews on Amazon.This classic tale follows the classic plot points.  Jack trades something for some ""magic beans,"" he's scolded for being stupid by his uncle, the seeds get wet and a bean stalk on steroids lifts his house to the land of giants up in the clouds, and then he faces off against giants.As Jack, Nicholas Hoult brings a strong sense of purity and goodness as if it came naturally to him.  Despite that, I wasn't otherwise impressed by his performance at all, which is unusual.  I typically very much enjoy his acting.  We quickly meet his love interest, future queen Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who also fails to impress me and is accidently carried to the land of giants with Jack's house.A smooth, well-spoken and stylishly haired knight named Elmont (Ewan McGregor) leads a band to rescue Isabelle from the land of giants.  He goes with a company of knights, Jack and Isabelle's extremely unsavory intended husband Roderick (Stanley Tucci).  Roderick slithers his way through the story and manages to do something despicable every step of the way.  He backstabs everybody and sides with the giants to seize King Brahmwell's (Ian McShane) kingdom below for himself.  I was unimpressed with all of these characters.  ALL OF THEM!!!  Sorry.  I call it like I see it.The giants are led by General Fallon (Bill Nighy).  Bill Nighy normally does great playing evil bad guys (e.g., Underworld, the Pirates franchise).  However, I felt he really missed his regular benchmark here.  Nothing about his character struck me as inhuman except for the CGI that illustrated him on screen.  Speaking of which, the CGI is just ""okay.""  I've seen MUCH better.  I guess it does its job but shows far too strong of a contrast with the non-computer-generated actors and backgrounds.  This goes not only for the giants, but for the fantasy-scapes as well.  Much as General Fallon, the other giants fail to feel like monsters outside of eating humans and their deliberate appearance.  They're simply mean ""giant"" humans and, as a result, were uninteresting.Sadly, while provoking a few giggles, I didn't care for the action either.  And the ending was just awful.  I can comfortably say that there were only three things that I really liked about this movie.1)  There's  a knight with a monocle.  That's as random as the Monopoly guy fighting in the UFC.2)  General Fallon's second head.  It's a brain-damaged, malformed little mongoloid that growls, cackles and mumbles incoherently with a stupid, googly-eyed look on its face at all times.  It reminded me of Gollum.3)  Ewan McGregor's hair.  I had no idea that fantasy knights had access to decent hair products.",2,"I was disappointed by the effects, the characters and the action.

Is it the best? Again no it is not. But its a great adaptation of the story of Jack & The Beanstalk.Jack The Giant Slayer stars Nicholas Hoult (Beast in X-Men First Class) as Jack. He is a young farm boy who, while trying to sell a horse, is abruptly put into a situation with a lovely princess played by Elanor Tomlinson. Now, be mindful it is not until after these course of events that Jack is given a mysterious bag of beans by a monk, and therefore begins a movie that is not only engrossing as it is funny, but the actors do one heck of a job bringing Jack the Giant Slayer to life.Ewan Mcgregor plays Elmont; his acting helped this movie a lot. We have Stanley Tucci as Lord Roderick (there has to be a bad guy in the midst). Also we have Ian Mcshane(played Blackbeard in Pirates of the Caribbean 4) as King Brahmwell. As I previously  said, the acting in Jack The Giant Slayer is really good.I enjoyed and had a good time with this movie.

I had previously heard about the film being pushed back almost a full year from its June 2012 release date. But it didn't make me think twice about going and seeing it. What i saw did not impress me a all, considering all the time the film had to be made perfect.This film had major issues and major successes thats why its 3 stars instead of 2 and a half which i was originally planning on giving this film.Ok now to start actually reviewing this film. The first things are the good things and they are the acting, cast, characters, comedy, story, and suspence. Ok to start with the acting. The acting in this film from the trailer seems cheesy and fake, but its not it is actually good. The best of the lot are Nicholas Hoult, Stanley Tucci (as always),and surprisingly Ian McShane. Nicholas Houltis on the verge of star status , for me that is, because it seems like this film is going to bomb at the box office. But never the less, he seems to always dig deep into his characters as shown in his performance as R, a zombie with a heart in Warm Bodies. This timehe digs deep to find his brave, farm boy self inside. He does well, he isjust one of those actors who actually can act well. And making it seem like its not acting , that it actually is a person, or monster. And Stanley Tucci, heck who does not always enjoy his fun performances!? I mean i gave him praise for his stand out performance in The Hunger Games, and The Devel Wears Prada. He just makes me laugh all the time he makes me like him, and hate him, depending on his roles. He can get me to feel him. Now for the last one Ian McShane does well surprisingly as the brave king, who instead ofbeing cowardly and hiding in the castle stands out to fight. He is wonderfully cast and acted in the film. And as for Ewan McGregor and Eleanor Tomlinson well they didn't stick out. Their actring was normal, same old , same old. It was not special nor horrible either. Now ontop the cast. This film as i said before has an excellent cast, of mostly unknowns. The Highlights are Bill Nighy as the voice of the lead giant, Fallon. He puts great effort into his characters and succeeds in becoming a tough leader like voice fore a giant. He was well chosen for the part. And Ewan McGregor and Nicholas Hoult were also well cast in their parts. Even though Ewan McGregor's acting was not anything special he is still the only one i can see playiong his part actually. And Nicholas Hoult, well he is epic, in the part of Jack. He is a genuine, brillent casting. I can think of knowone that could play Jack as good as he could. Now onto the characters. The characters are very good. Though few in characters i, tend to like some of the characters and would hate to see them die referring to Jack, and Elmont. Now not all of the characters are develpt that great, but i'll get onto it later on in this review. The jokes are really good, they are very funny (while childish i may add) these jokes are just super goofy and perfect for this film. The stroy is really interesting and original. I never thought about Jack ever slaying giants or them com ing down here to eat people, or a crown controlling them. They brought interesting ideas into this film.The suspence in this film is high. I was on the edge of my seat as the bean stalk fell, and when Isabelle almost got slabbed in the head. I was like OMG, it was really crazy, and when the first giant appeared and the water started moving it kinda gave a Jurassic Park vibe to it. Now with every good thing comes a bad thing and this film has a few which include the screen- play, ending, animation, lodgic, PG-13 rating, and running time. Ok so the screen -play as i previously stated is pretty much a weak script. I mean you have like the bald guy come over, look down and say ""where , where"" i'm like wtf, and then he gets pushed over the cliff and killed. Wow. That is not good. The script is just way weak, and it effected the poor ending. There is not alot of giants, which caused me to turn on the running time as an issue. It also effects the character develpment of the supporting characters like Ewen Bremner as Wicke, Ralph Brown as General Entin, and Eddie Marsan as Crawe. Those characters are given very little develpment and are killed off like nothing. Come on whats with that i mean i know nothing about them and feel nothing for them when they finally meet their poor deaths. The screen-play includes mostly poor writing, with a couple cheesy lines thrown in for effect. The endingin this film is horrible. The whole film leads up to whats surrposed to be an epic battle between giants and man kind, but all we get is a couple tree throwings and thats it before they are all heading back to the sky? What the heck , it is a big disappointment to me. trhe film ends with no battle or anything. The whole film leads up to something but fails to deliver anything at the end. The trailers promise a epic ending but the actual film gives us non of the above. The animation is um, not great but not horrible. There was not alot of differences between all of the giants except for Fumm, Fallon, and the giant with its hair standing up, all the others are just bald and tall, they just didn't spend much time to different one giant from another. The animation also to me looked way to cartoonish and not very relistic, they just used way to much animation on their giants, way to much, it was overloaded. This film is anything but logical. I mean when the humans and giants are playing tug a war the humans almost won. And it went on for nearly 10 minutes. I mean two think that these huge big giants can't take on the ant sized weak humans is crazy. That part really upset me. This film seems way to tame for a PG- 13 film. I mean they could have shown the people being eaten like Ewen Bremner's character, and shown alittle blood coming out, they didn't half to show tons but you know atleast show it. Don't have all the eatings happen off screen or so fast that we don't catch it. It makes me wonder what happenes to those characters. Wow PG- 13 ratings have become really strict. Almost all films now get R ratings. The running time is way to small for this film. It should have been around 2 and a half, 3 hours, people could make it i know it. The script could have added more giants, and a long battle sequence, and more character develpment. And youknow more small scenes like exploring the jungle in the giants world more and finding giant monsters , some fun if you will. All and All this film had its highs and lows. It was really difficult to come up with a proper rating too. And finally alittle more praise on the wonderful, Nicholas Hoult, who was the star of the show.

1474231,A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B005LAIHUO,JWink,"[1, 2]","Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie about an ancient war between humans and a race of giants when Jack, a young farmhand fighting for a kingdom and the love of a princess, opens a gateway between the two worlds in this imaginative telling of the old tale.After watching this movie, I thought that the tale had a lot of imagination and potential but could have been so much more.  First the good parts, the special effects were very good and the land of the giants was very well done.  I thought Bill Nighty who played the giant Fallon did an excellent job at being the villain.  But I thought the love story was not well done and felt a bit impersonal and could have been developed a little better.  The other thing to me is that it seems that the violence and action in the movie was toned down to the point of blandness.  The movie title was changed from being a Giant Killer to a Giant Slayer and several action sequences seemed to have been cut up to avoid showing the giants eating the humans for example and things like that.  I am assuming that they did it that way to make it more of a family oriented movie (with the PG rating) and that's not necessarily a bad thing but I felt that it detracted from the action of the story as the action sequences felt a bit choppy and uneven.With that being said, Jack the GS is a good family movie although maybe not for the youngest ages.  Unfortunately that direction to make it a general audience movie made it less of an adult oriented movie that could have been  better overall and probably would have done better in theaters.

It is however definitely not recommended to little children, like 10 and younger. This review contains limited SPOILERS.This retelling of old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is pretty well done, with many key ingredients of fairy tales well in place. There is a brave and ultimately quite clever farm boy (Jack), a cute and quite likeable damsel in distress, a noble king, his brave knights, a vilainous treacherous scoundrel, powerful magic items, a really REALLY BAD giant alpha (and beta) and a whole batallion of other giants, almost as dangerous as their two-headed leader.Past the first 10 minutes, the film is rather quick paced and visually it is very pleasant: the sky domain of giants, the giant beanstalks and the mighty royal fortress are really impressive. The desperate fight of royal army against the giants besieging the great royal castle is a particularly well done thing - I certainly appreciated that both humans and giants fight in a rather logical way and human army is definitely not a push-over...The best character in the film and a scene stealer is Elmont, a sarcastic noble knight commanding royal guard, played very VERY convincingly by Ewan McGregor who seizes this occasion to remind the public, that he once played Obi-wan Kenobi and that after all he killed Darth Maul and General Grievous and defeated and mutilated Darth Vader... Frankly, I almost expected Elmont to finally use his light-saber and I was very surprised when he didn't...Stanley Tucci who plays the main villain Roderick is another scene stealer, with his quasi Monty Pythonesque style - it is clear he had tons of fun playing in this film. Ewan Bremer, who plays his slightly deranged murderous sidekick Wicke, is another delight to watch.Compared to those three characters and to all the gallery of giants, both Jack and the Princess seem a little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available.

1474302,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIHUO,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","The most difficult thing about reviewing new DVDs each week is choosing just which title to write about. While you would love to write about the best film being released it's not always a movie that's easily accessible. So you do the next best thing. You write about the one that will be easily found and probably rented or purchased by more folks than any other. So if you want to know what the best release is this week read what I've written about SOLOMON KANE.That being said let's take a look at what will probably be the big DVD of the week, JACK THE GIANT SLAYER. Directed by Bryan Singer, the man responsible for the X-Men trilogy, SUPERMAN RETURNS, VALKYRIE and one of my favorite movies, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, brings us a new take on the classic fairy tale that I'm sure we all heard growing up. Trust me when I say this isn't your grandpa's giant killer.Jack here, played by Nicholas Hoult, is indeed a young farm boy who has fond memories of his mother reading him the fairy tale but who now finds himself living with his uncle and being forced to sell the family horse to get money to fix their home. In town he bumps into a friar on the run from the evil Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci). The friar has stolen some magic beans from Roderick in hopes of preventing him from using them to reach the legendary giants as well as the crown that held them at bay from attacking folks here on Earth. Before he can be caught he entrusts the beans to Jack and tells him to take them to the Abby for safekeeping. Of course Jack's uncle gets mad and tosses the beans at him, several of which fall through the cracks in the floor to the ground in the midst of a terrible rain storm.Back at the castle Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) is set to marry Roderick, something she truly does not want to do. But as with all medieval films it seems princesses are nearly always forced into a marriage with someone they don't love to solve problems in the kingdom. This story is no different and that evening Isabell runs away from home. Where does she end up? At Jack's house of course.Having met earlier in the day, when Jack attempted to save her honor from some ruffians when she was in disguise, the two are drawn to one another but realize that there is no way a princess may marry a commoner. Before their attraction can kick in, the beans hatch and begin lifting the house into the skies. Jack attempts to save Isabell but is tossed from the house before he can do so.The next day the king's men show, led by knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) head of the elite guard. The king sends Elmont along with Roderick, several guards and Jack who insists on going along. They make the treacherous climb up the beanstalk and find the land that was spoken of in fairy tales, a land where giants actually exist. They also have the uncanny ability to smell out the Englishmen who have made there way upwards.The rest of the film answers the questions will they escape, will Roderick find the crown and rule over all, will Jack and Isabell find a way around their differences to fulfill true love and will the giants make their way down the beanstalk to attack England? I could answer all of those questions but there is more fun in watching them than reading here about those answers.The film moves along at a brisk pace, never slacking off or becoming tiresome. The acting by all is well played with McGregor moving comfortably into the swashbuckling hero role he began playing in the STAR WARS films. Hoult does a great job as well as the impressionable Jack and Tomlinson portrays the fair maiden in distress admirably. But while the acting is good it's the special effects folks are waiting for in this movie.Those special effects live up to all expectations. The giants are all quite believable with each one having their own special characteristics and quirks about them. In the lead is General Fallon, a two headed creature bent on taking back the lower land they once ruled. The beanstalk is also well thought out and offered up in its full glory.In the end I can say that this film was an enjoyable time, an evening well spent. It offered some new twists to an old tale, some great acting, notable special effects and never attempted to become offensive with gross out jokes or language. There are some violent moments that might bother small children (people being eaten by giants) but I would say the whole family could enjoy this one together.

Unlike a film shot in 3d that is.  There is a huge difference in 3d depth , that comes with actually shooting a film in 3d. This is ok in 3d though , the 3d disc is slightly darker than the 2d version though.  As a film it is a good family film for kids older than 7 , as the gaints eat people. But at a distance , with no blood though.  SO it's far less gory than a video game. It is a good flick for the whole family and the 3d does add some depth. NOt like a film shot in the format though.  In fact every movie could benefit from being shot in 3d. wether you plan a shot that takes advantage of the 3d doesn't matter. Some films are all about that ,  'silent hill 3d' is about the money shots. this one isn't. but it's still good and would have looked better if shot in 3d.  3d is a varied tool and I could watch any movie in it.  it adds depth. or to see a flick with some shots that utilize that 3d.

1474322,A2ZFN595FLTHEB,B005LAIHUO,Michael Martinez,"[4, 7]","Perhaps the best way to summarize the feeling you'll receive from Jack the Giant Slayer is this: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.No, really, it is THAT good.It is good enough to make you forget that horrid moment when Superman was getting dragged hair- and face-first by some nameless goons (oh and Kumar), and he managed to let out a desperate, horrifically out-of-character scream of, &#8220;I'm still Superman!&#8221;For those of you who know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who are going to zip on over to YouTube or dig through your guilty pleasure collection and fast-forward that fumbled rehash of the Richard Donner and Christopher Reeves era with the subtitles on: You.Were.WARNED &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Did you see it?Awful, right? And now you can't UN-see it. You're welcome.BUT! Even though you can't erase the memory I've just Incepted you with, you can certainly run down to your local theater now and use the epically fun Jack the Giant Slayer to cleanse your mental palette.Now, I'm not sure how many people have been following the development of this film. After all, Singer certainly didn't exactly help his Hollywood credibility following up Superman Returns by throwing a Nazi uniform on Tom Cruise (though, for the record, Valkyrie was good!). Perhaps the uh Stanley Tucci fans? Ewan McGregor fans? Did they forget the Jedi-mullet?  In any case, based on the weekend receipts and projections, it's not going to be pretty, and the studio did jack squat (see what I did there) to help this picture by showcasing the films worst instances of CGI in the trailers and utilizing that beat-to-death marketing campaign of flooding a trailer with utterances of the titular character's name (looking at YOU, Parker!).The poor box office is simply a travesty. Let's not forget Singer gave us one of the greatest superhero movies of all time in X-Men 2 AND he wrote the story for the much-beloved X-Men: First Class (which people seem to forget when they claim every X-film before First Class was trash, but I digress). Not to mention the powerful Apt Pupil and everyone's favorite pimpin' limpin' villain in The Usual Suspect's Keyser Soze.After that, we OWE it to Singer, dammit, because this film is so good. And you know what MAKES this movie so good? Singer had the balls to break the conventions we would've pointed to to justify the feeble box office, and both the storytelling and action were so tight that you can almost picture Singer going, &#8220;Yeah, remember me? Remember what I can do?&#8221; Well, I pictured it, and I certainly was forced to remember what he's capable of.The film, like any other, has flaws, ranging from the miscasting of King Brahmwell (Ian McShane (should have been Bernard Hill)), a Padme-and-Anakin-esque conversation between Jack (Nicholas Hoult) and Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) early on, and distracting aesthetics like Jack's hoodie and Elmont (McGregor)'s Team Edward haircut. Not to mention some video-game-level CGI that goes into the giants, which we all should've been aware of going into the theater.However, the key to any good story is not to be free of flaws but to be alive and organic enough to essentially force the audience to get over them because the ride is just that gripping. Such was the case with Jack the Giant Slayer. It would have been so easy for Singer to regurgitate all the trappings of fantasy and adventure storytelling into a quick cash-machine without putting any thought and energy into the subtle complexities (looking at YOU this time, Wreck-It-Ralph). Instead, there is care put into virtually every aspect of this film. Upon every instance of you as the audience starting to believe you've got a bead on what's going to happen next, this movie utterly smashes your expectations and puts together something even better.You want specifics, you say? Well, first of all, this movie is full of characters who actually THINK. It's a sad state of our modern movie-going experience when we can watch a movie free of characters who are stupid because the plot demands they should be stupid. Sure, Jack must make that initial exchange for the Magic Beans as the classic fairytale dictates, but his curiosity was piqued early on by his father telling him stories of an ancient war with a race of giants that reside in a cloud kingdom, and Jack wasn't the only one. Isabelle receives a joint bedtime story exposition sequence and acquires a taste for adventure from her royal mother (which is perhaps all-too-familiar for the five of us who saw Hellboy II: The Golden Army). Following the death of both of these orating parents (which should've been given a scene), Jack is left in the hands of a cruel uncle and Isabelle her protective father.A chance encounter with Isabelle in town plants the seeds of romance for these two, and Jack gets a taste of her world, which entails constant supervision by the elite King's Guardians, headed by McGregor's Elmont and his trusty second-in-command Crawe (Eddie Marsan), who also required an additional scene to round them out. After Jack and Isabelle inevitably receive their scoldings from their guardians for being too naive, the former is left steaming and in possession of the beans, while the latter flees from both the castle and her arranged marriage to the boundlessly ambitious and ruthless Roderick (Stanley Tucci). Isabelle happens upon Jack's cottage while his uncle is out attempting to rectify Jack's misguided transaction, and following that at-times painful exchange I mentioned before, one of the beans gets wet, sprouts, and we're off to the races!What follows is wonderful example of what can get done in fantasy/action-adventure films when the writer and director have zero tolerance for a stale and meandering plot. Once Jack is discovered at the bottom of the beanstalk, absent princess-in-distress, a rescue party is dispatched, and both Jack and Roderick inevitably join up in the race to retrieve Isabelle before the giants realize they've got a route to wage war on humanity once again. At this point you may start to mentally prepare yourself for yet another drawn-out journey where the company is able to rescue Isabelle and in the process exhibit all that is right with Jack and all that is wrong with Roderick; add a dash of blatant set-piece action, a sniveling coward character for comic relief, and a moment when the leading woman takes her place amongst the boys by being the one to stop the war and save everyone's collective ass, and we're set, right?Wrong.Not only does this story have brains, it has guts.Secondary characters are forced to don red shirts and walk the tight-rope.Roderick's personal goon (Ewen Bremner) is much scarier than he has any right to be.Isabelle sees Jack for who he is on his own merits and not in stark contrast to Roderick, whose motives aren't allowed to simmer for 90 minutes before a grand betrayal.And the giants do make it down to the ground to go Gojira on our structures and devour humans in brutal (albeit in blood- and gore-free) fashion.The heroes are roughly thrust into an impossible situation and forced to handle it, and it feels so good to find a storyteller who does not fall so in love with his own creations that they are unwilling to take this sink-or-swim approach. To those of you who cringed at the CGI displayed in the trailers, allow me to assuage your apprehensions by saying Singer smartly films in a manner to keep the giants and humans separate for the majority of the movie, and everything that should have been a physical prop, WAS a physical prop. There's even a scene where one of hour heroes is about to be turned into a pastry and you can watch the giant crepe bread they've been wrapped in BAKE. And the scale and pace of the action was just unapologetically both brutal and fun. The King gets hands-on and makes sacrifices to drive home the severity of the threat. Furthermore, the tactics and innovations in the climactic battle make it clear that the giants and humans have been preparing for the possibility of another war for a very long time, and the battle is sprinkled with glorious tide-swinging moments up until the final charge.AND, when the short-lived World War Giant II is over, we're given the cherry on top in the form of a foreboding wink that Singer has perfected.I freely admit that perhaps the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because I let it catch me off-guard. I went in with tempered expectations. And no doubt some of you will now watch the film after I've hyped it up and be disappointed. But don't come back and say it sucked. And don't even say that the film's quality exists in a vacuum unsullied by the audience's interpretation. Instead, simply join me in saying: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.",4,Singer Returns,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,8902,"['Perhaps', 'best', 'way',

Utilizing today's CGI (ingeniously but not too overdone), good old fashioned acting (believable dialogue laced with humorous reparte between the characters, void of the tiresome clich&eacute;s)lavish costumes, believable locales and sets, and an ensemble of fresh new faces (Nicholas Hoult as Jack, Eleanor Tomlinson as the Princess) we are taken back to a time of Kings, Castles and the myth of a banished race, the Giants ......the story does not stray too far from its original telling but focuses on those elements that beckon the return of these gargantuan creatures (each so grotesque in their appearance and evil in their intentions, masterfully portrayed in this story) and the Fairytale romance between a Princess and a commoner, the Farmer's son.  The Beanstalk itself, a spectacular design of special effects, is an unbelievable enormous growth of twisted, tortuous, twining tentacles that ascends from one magic bean- growing upwards into the clouds as the portal into the land of the Giants. Here we see a hierarchy within the Giant culture...a simmering conflict between the two headed (ingenious!) leader and his rival who desires to be King of the cretins.  There is a clever use of overlapping dialogue that stitches one scene to another into brilliant, believable conversations and surprises! Subtle colors, candlelit interior scenes add to the frightening and ominous events that occur thruout this spectacular film....the action scenes almost rule the film but for the Actors (the King, regally played by Ian McShane-what a scene stealer! the Protector, Ewan Macgregor-dashing, fearless and a potential suitor for the princess, the General-monacled and reminiscent of a German Kaiser in uniform and demeanor; and, of course, the Giants themselves-each markedly different in appearance and mentality with just enough humor to allow viewing by younger audiences) Oh yes, there is somewhat of a surprise ending with a twist provided by Mr. Singer-- remember the evil Lord Roderick? I was thoroughly entertained and treated to feast of deliciously devilish villians, creatures and a believable plot.....you need to experience this wonderful film....how about this weekend?

1474337,A2AK7ZFKW08HID,B005LAIHUO,movielover,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this movie and wanted to start off by saying that the 3D version is the way to go with this movie and I will go into a little more detail on the 3D later, but first the story.This movie is a re-imagining of Jack and the Beanstalk. Jack, played by Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, X-Men: First Class), who grows up listening to the story of Giants that live on a land in the sky and come down to earth by beanstalks that grow from magic beans, and have a hunger for humans. Erik the king makes a crown from the heart of a giant, and whoever has the crown has the power over the giants. With the use of the crown king Erik sends the giants back to the land and the sky and chops down the beanstalk so they cannot return. Upon king Erik's death the crown and magic beans are buried with him, or so the story goes.The movie then picks up with Jack now 18 and living with his uncle, played by Christopher Fairbank (The Fifth Element, Batman), due to both his parents being deceased. When Jack's uncle sends him to town to sell a horse and cart he meets and saves the princess Isabelle, played by Eleanor Tomlinson (Alice in Wonderland). While trying to sell his horse after saving the princess and having his cart stolen, he runs into a monk, whose has stolen the beans and is being sought after by the kings most trusted adviser Roderick, played by Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, Captain America: The First Avenger). In exchange for the horse the monk gives Jack the magic beans. When Jack returns home with the beans and no money his uncle becomes upset with Jack and spills the beans on the floor. One bean falls in a crack in the floorboard. Later that night a bad storm hits, and well I guess you know what happens when the bean gets wet and this is where the movie really starts to take off.The cast did a terrific job and, there are alot of good actors, besides the ones I mentioned above. Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episode 2&3) plays Elmont, Bill Nighy (Underworld) plays General Fallon, Ian McShane (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides) plays the king, and the list goes on. They did a wonderful job casting this movie.The visuals were really well done also. The landscapes looked really vast and beautiful. The land in the sky was really awesome and I loved the waterfall. The giants are really well detailed, right down to the hair on their noses. I also like the POV shots from the giants perspective, it really gives you a since of how tall the giants are.The 3D was really well done and like I mentioned earlier, it is definitely the way to watch this movie. The depth is nicely done and adds alot to the film, especially in the POV shots I talked about above from the giants perspective and also with the landscapes. There are also some nice pop outs here and there, mostly flying debris, but it all helps to just immerse you into the movie.Overall this movie was a great experience and should definitely be recommended. If you have a 3D setup you have to watch it in 3D, I just can't stress that enough. If you don't have a 3D setup this movie is still worth checking out. If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings you will definitely enjoy this, because it has a Lord of the Rings feel to it, with the story and the vast landscapes. Anyway be sure to check this one out, you won't be disappointed!",5,"Fee, Fye, Foe, Fumm, in your living room the giants will come!",1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,3322,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'wanted', 'start', 'off', 'saying', '3D', 'version', 'way', 'go', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'little', 'more', 'detail', '3D', 'later', 'first', 'story.This', 'movie', 're-imagining', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'Jack', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'who', 'up', 'listening', 'story', 'Giants', 'live', 'land', 'sky', 'come', 'down', 'earth', 'beanstalks', 'grow', 'magic', 'beans', 'have', 'hunger', 'humans', 'Erik', 'king', 'crown', 'heart', 'giant', 'crown', 'power', 'giants', 'use', 'crown', 'king', 'Erik', 'giants', 'back', 'land', 'sky', 'chops', 'down', 'beanstalk', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'king', 'Erik', 'death', 'crown', 'magic', 'beans', 'are', 'buried', 'so', 'story', 'goes.The', 'movie', 'then', 'up', 'Jack', 'now', '18', 'living', 'uncle', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Fairbank', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Batman', 'due', 'parents', 'being', 'deceased', 'When', 'Jack', 'uncle', 'town', 'sell', 'horse', 'cart', 'princess', 'Isabelle', 'played', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'trying', 'sell', 'horse', 'saving', 'princess', 'having', 'cart', 'stolen', 'monk', 'stolen', 'beans', 'being', 'sought', 'kings', 'most', 'trusted', 'adviser', 'Roderick', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'exchange', 'horse', 'monk', 'Jack', 'magic', 'beans', 'When', 'Jack', 'home', 'beans', 'money', 'uncle', 'upset', 'Jack', 'beans', 'floor', 'One', 'bean', 'crack', 'floorboard', 'Later', 'night', 'bad', 'storm', 'hits', 'well', 'guess', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'bean', 'wet', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'take', 'off.The', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'are', 'alot', 'good', 'actors', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', '2', '3', 'plays', 'Elmont', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Underworld', 'General', 'Fallon', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'king', 'list', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'casting', 'movie.The', 'visuals', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'landscapes', 'looked', 'really', 'vast', 'beautiful', 'land', 'sky', 'was', 'really', 'awesome', 'loved', 'waterfall', 'giants', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'detailed', 'right', 'down', 'hair', 'noses', 'also', 'POV', 'shots', 'giants', 'perspective', 'really', 'how', 'tall', 'giants', 'are.The', '3D', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'definitely', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'depth', 'nicely', 'done', 'alot', 'film', 'especially', 'POV', 'shots', 'talked', 'about', 'giants', 'perspective', 'also', 'landscapes', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'pop', 'outs', 'here', 'there', 'mostly', 'flying', 'debris', 'just', 'immerse', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'experience', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'recommended', 'have', '3D', 'setup', 'have', 'watch', '3D', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '3D', 'setup', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'feel', 'story', 'vast', 'landscapes', 'Anyway', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Jack the Giant Slayer

1474353,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B005LAIHUO,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[5, 22]","There is a whole sub-community of movie executives who will farewell their Hollywood careers when, as most assuredly it will, this film plummets like a clumsy giant out of the sky on its general release to the public.For, unlike the last film I can remember being this wretched (Danny Glover's Age of the Dragons) Bryan Singer's Jack the Giant Slayer was not released straight to video, its producers having first been taken out and shot.Here rather more is at stake, at least if the fanfare that accompanied its preview screening is anything to go by. They erected a 20 foot high climbing wall outside the cinema to mark the launch. Since the screening took place in Leicester Square on St. Patrick's Day amidst a throng of drunken Irish revellers, this was a misjudgment all of its own.Other than Age of the Dragons (and, let's face it, ""Moby Dick. On land. With dragons. Starring Vinnie Jones"" is quite a benchmark), I can't remember a film quite so bankrupt in its basic concept. The idea seems to have been to take anything of note in the fantasy genre of recent times - there are hat tips to The Princess Bride, The Hobbit, How To Train Your Dragon, Beowulf, Prometheus and Immortals among many others - and to stitch them together in the expectation that it might all fly. Jack the Giant Slayer therefore has a cloying excess just about everything.Except smut. Smut is fully absent without official leave. Great Scott, it's a pantomime! Jack and the Beanstalk begs for double entendre! Its bizarre omission calls to mind Danny McBride's childishly excellent Your Highness, a film almost entirely comprised of innuendo and which, like no other, illustrates just how redemptive a willy joke can be.In the meantime, the story is a hodgepodge of English fairy tales. Despite being named for ""Jack the Giant Killer"" (""killer"" nixed because the focus group didn't like the word ""killer"" and didn't understand the concept ""synonym"") this is mostly a reprise of Jack & the Beanstalk. Only better, I suspect its screenwriting collective thought (this is a collective whose collected output, by the way, is enough to induce dizziness, cold sweats and vomiting).And of course it isn't better. It can't be. Jack & The Beanstalk is an archetypal fairy story with the kernel of a decent drama, but in no reasonable man's conception could it stretch for two hours (not, at least, without a cross-dressing Widow Twanky somewhere along the way). So the collective has drowned out the elemental aspects of the story with additional tropes and dog-eared routines of the idiom, whilst egregiously forgetting the all-important transvestitism.Now excuse a digression into literary theory, but in this fairy story there is a hero (Jack), a monster (one giant), a perfidious interlocutor who, through shortsightedness, meanness, hubris or stupidity provides the impetus for the hero to be uncaged (a stepmother who angrily throws away the beans for which Jack has stupidly traded his cow). It is simple stuff, and has a whopping great cock of metaphor quite literally rooted right in the middle of everything, yet the moral of the story is unusual for a ""hero overcoming the monster"" story: be careful what you wish for. Sometimes your vaulting ambition can come back to bite you. Here the screenplay entirely futzes that simple premise. There are several candidates for villain - an entire tribe of Ulstermen giants (in a land and at the top of a beanstalk, by the way, so graphically rendered as to compel close literal examination of a metaphor which isn't up to such scrutiny. Wouldn't everyone have, like, noticed a huge landmass floating in the sky? Wouldn't it always be dark below? Wouldn't things spontaneously fall off it from time to time (as indeed they start to once the action gets underway)? Would the land below really look just like the Home Counties in summertime?The screenwriters have invented a backstory for the giants which further compromises the fable. They're subject to a mythical ring (or crown, depending on your hat size), to the bearer of which they must pledge automatic fealty. This allows further candidate for supreme Villain when dastardly Roderick (Stanley Tucci), one of the King's men, gets hold of the ring, waves it at a horde of onrushing giants, and they all at once bow down to him without further discussion.And just as the giants seem improbably captive of one little midget, director Bryan Singer seems captive of, his special effects department. The film is in 3D, a fad which elsewhere seems thankfully pass&eacute;, is lit darkly anyway, and they have made the curious decision to entirely animate the giants (per Beowulf, rather than augmenting live performances per Lord of the Rings) using quite dated rendering technology. Perhaps we have reached the limit what the CGI wizards can do, and there is hope for the Film Actors Guild after all. In any case Bill Nighy isn't recognisable as the Giant with the Belfast accent and the extra head.Meanwhile, our anaemic young hero Jack (Nicholas Hoult) does his best with no obvious fibre and only an anaemic princess (Eleanor Tomlinson) to win over, whom the giants are (specifically, for some reason) hell-bent on eating (notwithstanding that such a skinny little whelp would, to a giant, have the size and consistency of a cockroach).We arrive at a final dramatic conclusion at the Castle (I know, I know, *what* castle?) wherein King (*what* King?) Brahmwell (Ian McShane), in possibly the most woeful piece of miscasting in motion picture history, is obliged to partake in a twenty minute tug of war with a giant cabbage-patch doll while dressed in a suit of armour made of 24 carat gold lam&eacute; that even Julian Clary wouldn't be seen dead in. McShane, to his credit, looks singularly unamused, adopting the expression of a Candid Camera victim immediately prior to being let in on the gag.As of the time of writing the film hadn't recouped half its estimated production costs in a month or so of general American release. Thus I hope Ian McShane and his cohort of celebrated English actors got paid in hard currency in advance - because the merchandising rights ain't going to be worth Jack.Olly Buxton",1,Too much work

and John Kassir.This film is populated by a a very nice cast that consistently gels together in putting over a nice new slant on an old fairy tale;Jack and the Beanstalk.The story begins as we see a young boy and a young girl(in two separate homes)being read the same story of giants living above the earth.The boy is Jack,poor,and the girl is a princess to be.Time passes and Jack is now living with his uncle,who sends him to the market to sell their horse and cart.While there he happens to enter a tent to watch a show based on the giants fable.A young lady is also there in disguise;the princess.When she is accosted by some thugs Jack steps in to help,but the arrival of the princess's guards puts an abrupt end to his&#34;heroics&#34;.Back at the castle,dad the king is upset at her constant clandestine comings and goings and her refusal to marry one of his close aids.When he puts his foot down she leaves upset.Jack meanwhile has sold his horse to a monk who happens to be on the run from some of the kings men.For payment Jack accepted some beans the monk said were priceless.When Jack arrives home his uncle tears a strip out of Jack and leaves to sell some of Jack's possessions.That night the princess decides to leave the castle again,and she gets caught in a storm.Seeking refuge she comes upon,of all places,Jack's house.As the two get reacquainted,a bean that had fallen down between the cracks in the house floor,gets wet from the rain outside and starts to grow exponentially.Jacks ends back on terra firma,but the princess and the house get carried into the clouds by the beanstalk.When the king gets wind of what has happened he dispatches some of his best men to bring his daughter back.But treachery is afoot as the kings aide that is due to marry his daughter has plans to rule both the giants and the earth.He carries with him an ancient relic forged from the heart of a giant leader.Any wearer will rule the kingdom of the giants.When they reach the top they find the house but no princess.The group are quickly confronted by the giants.They do find the princess eventually,but they can no longer help or free her as they quickly become captives themselves.The kings close aide finally takes his opportunity and claims his dominion over the giants.It does not last too long as he ends up battling and losing to another of the kings men.In fact the giants reclaim the crown and before the remaining members of the kings rescue party can return back to earth,the giants are already in attack mode.However the king and his men on the ground have decided to chop the beanstalk down,stopping the giants in their tracks.It does have the effect however, of making it a rather harrowing trip back down for Jack,the princess and the kings top guard.The giants recovered not only the crown but a sack containing some of the beans and they use them to grow beanstalks downwards.They arrive on earth and attack the king and his men on their way back to the castle.They barely make it back to safety as the giants are now on the offensive.The kings forces put up a good fight but the giants are able to eventually enter the castle walls.Their leader has both Jack and the princess at his mercy,when Jack uses his final bean,by throwing it down the giants gullet.This disposes of the giant as a beanstalk grows out of him.Jack also reclaims the crown and sends the giants back to their world in the clouds.The film comes to an end as Jack and the princess,now married,are telling their children the old story of the beanstalk and the giants.We also see that the crown was eventually forged over time into what is now the crown worn by the Queen of England for official ceremonies and is locked in the Tower of London.This film is a pure delight from start to finish.Yes the giants are all CGI,but unlike the creatures created for R.I.P.D.(see my review on that)these look quite wonderful.In fact I would say the CGI here is on a par with anything in the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films.Considering the world that is created you can be sure the actors were shooting alot in front of blue screens, having to react to things that actually were not there.When you view the finished product,it is impressive.The story itself has got such a good twist on an old story that it keeps you interested all the way through.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1.Extras include deleted scenes and a gag reel.All in all a very impressive twist on an old fairy tale of giants and a beanstalk.The cast is good,the script is good and the CGI is spot on.Well recommended.",4,An altogether delightful fantasy film,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,4729,"['Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'released', 'Feb/13', 'stars', 'others', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Eleanor',

He's so good, and the biggest reason I watched JACK THE GIANT SLAYER - a not-so-modern modern take on the well-known fairy tale ""Jack and the Beanstalk"".  The film opens with Jack as a young boy, where through his father's tales we learn the legend behind the great giants that live far above the earth, and how one day a giant beanstalk enabled them to come down and almost destroy the land ... until a wise-thinking king found a way to forge a crown that kept the giants under his control so he could send them home.Cut to Jack at 18 (I think).  Orphaned, he now lives with his farmer uncle and works the small plot of land they live on.  But things aren't going well, and Uncle sends Jack to town to sell their one and only horse to buy the materials needed to repair their roof before the rains come.  In town, Jack finds himself taking on ruffians to save a beautiful young woman - Princess Isabelle, the king's daughter, no less - but is having trouble selling the horse until a monk offers him a handful of beans as collateral, telling Jack to come by the monastery later for his payment.  The film, after this, follows form as just one bean that Jack loses track of grows into a monstrous beanstalk - and when Isabelle is trapped in it, Jack insinuates himself into the search party the king sends out to rescue her (which includes a couple of really bad guys with  more than rescue on their minds).Even with all the CGI - which I normally hate in abundance like this - the film is fun, entertaining, and provides just enough twists to the original fairy tale while staying very true to it at the same time.  Hoult is great, Eleanor Tomlinson as Isabelle suitably tough yet vulnerable, and both Ewan McGregor (heading the rescue team) and Stanley Tucci (big-time bad guy, here) all make the film one that grabs your attention even as the tension and action both escalate.  A pretty fun, even family friendly movie that travels no real new ground but somehow still manages to feel fresh.",4,A modern take on an old fairy tale that pays homage to its source material (3-1/2 stars),1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2098,"['Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'been', 'knocking', 'socks', 'off', 'actor', 'saw', 'episode', 'one', 'Skins', 'so', 'good', 'biggest', 'reason', 'watched', 'JACK', 'THE', 'GIANT', 'SLAYER', 'not-so-modern', 'modern', 'take', 'well-known', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'film', 'Jack', 'young', 'boy', 'where', 'father', 'tales', 'learn', 'legend', 'great', 'giants', 'live', 'far', 'earth', 'how', 'one', 'day', 'giant', 'beanstalk', 'enabled', 'come', 'down', 'almost', 'destroy', 'land', 'wise-thinking', 'king', 'found', 'way', 'forge', 'crown', 'kept', 'giants', 'control', 'could', 'send', 'home.Cut', 'Jack', '18', 'think', 'Orphaned', 'now', 'farmer', 'uncle', 'small', 'plot', 'land', 'live', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'well', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'town', 'sell', 'one', 'only', 'horse', 'buy', 'materials', 'needed', 'repair', 'roof', 'rains', 'come', 'town', 'Jack', 'taking', 'ruffians', 'save', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Princess', 'Isabelle', 'king', 'daughter', 'less', 'having', 'trouble', 'selling', 'horse', 'monk', 'handful', 'beans', 'collateral', 'telling', 'Jack', 'come', 'monastery', 'later', 'payment', 'film', 'form', 'just', 'one', 'bean', 'Jack', 'track', 'grows', 'monstrous', 'beanstalk', 'when', 'Isabelle', 'trapped', 'Jack', 'search', 'party', 'king', 'out', 'rescue', 'couple', 'really', 'bad', 'guys', 'more', 'rescue', 'minds', '.Even', 'CGI', 'normally', 'hate', 'abundance', 'film', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'just', 'enough', 'twists', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'staying', 'very', 'true', 'same', 'time', 'Hoult', 'great', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'Isabelle', 'suitably', 'tough', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'heading', 'rescue', 'team', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'big-time', 'bad', 'guy', 'here', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'attention', 'even', 'tension', 'action', 'escalate', 'pretty', 'fun', 'even', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'real', 'new', 'ground', 'somehow', 'still', 'feel', 'fresh']",Jack the Giant Slayer

Stanley Tucci plays a discreetly evil assistant to the king, but does a good job of playing it convincingly.  Ewan McGregor also projects a compelling performance in playing the protector of both the King Brahmwell and Princess Isabelle.  Nicholas Hoult plays an innocent and energetic portrayal of Jack.

The first half builds character as it effectively draws parallels between Jack (Nicholas Hoult) and the Princess (Eleanor Tomlinson). It becomes a classic rescue tale. The second half is more akin to a fight scene from LOTR.The giants are based on the legend of the Titans. Our characters are very stock and the dialouge was dry. The princess who is supposed to be some independent fighter speaks poetically and is lifeless...Kristen Stewart could have done better. The giants reminded me of Orcs and at times they were rather disgusting.I wonder who this film was for? For adults the plot is rather simple. I can't imagine the background of Giants who eat people and drop the F-bomb (two headed giant near the end) as being suitable for children. PG-13 indicates that is the appeal factor: Tweens and young teens who would indeed rate it 5 stars.This production is riding the coattails of the successful fairy tale productions that preceded it. It doesn't have a good script. It lacks crisp dialouge. It doesn't have the star appeal.

1474471,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B005LAIHUO,The People's Critic,"[5, 5]","The story of Jack and his magical beanstalk dates back to Viking times and over the past 1400 years, we have yet to be sick of it.  Countless versions of this story exist in virtually every format of entertainment imaginable.  The story is a good one though and in the hands of the talented director Bryan Singer, this version is certainly one of the best.Jack the Giant Slayer stars Nicholas Hoult whose star is on the rise.  Fresh off of his other starring role as R in Warm Bodies, Hoult functions well as the underestimated, romantic hero.  The main story is mostly familiar.  Jack is trusted with a task to sell items for money, but he returns home with no money and a handful of ""magic beans.""  The magical properties of the beans are unleashed when they become wet in a rainstorm sending Jack's house, and inadvertently the King's daughter Isabelle, up to a legendary land of giants via a massive beanstalk.  King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) organizes a team to rescue his daughter lead by his trusted knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and including Jack as well as the plotting Roderick (Stanley Tucci) who the princess has been promised to for marriage.The giants are truly spectacular.  They are easily 20 feet tall and have a very clever form of motivation based on a previous war between man and giant, which resulted in them being magically enslaved by a magic crown.  Nonetheless, they are vengeful and dangerous, bringing a real threat of danger and excitement to the story.  Furthermore, Singer allows several opportunities for tongue-in-cheek humor to permeate the already clever adventure story that takes place up the beanstalk.  Simply put, a strong case is made for Stanley Tucci to have a part in every movie.The only issue the film has going against it lies in its first act.  Singer's film begins a bit slowly with terse voice-over narration of parallel backstories for young Jack and young Isabelle.  The children playing these parts deliver excruciatingly clich&eacute;d performances, and it was at this point that I admit I was worried.Consequently, I must pause here to mention that this review comes with a brief stipulation.  When it comes to re-making a fairy-tale, there are many pitfalls that can occur; a major one is choosing the right audience.  Aside from this tepid opening segment, Bryan Singer actually has made a film that would exist more comfortably in Middle Earth than in Disney World.  It embraces its world of man-eating giants and has fun with it.  This decision certainly enhances the film's entertainment value, but it also takes a familiar children's tale and puts it just out of reach for children to enjoy. Creating an opening scene so clearly not in congruence with the rest of the film sets the incorrect initial mood that is hard to shake once the movie gets good.  However, if you can make the leap, this film definitely functions much better as a romantic action film than as a cute and safe children's tale.That being said, I liked Jack the Giant Slayer.  I also recommend seeing it in 3-D, which is a recommendation I can honestly say I would give to no more than five films.

1474472,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B005LAIHUO,The Wiz,"[0, 0]","""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is a fun, little fantasy tale with a surprisingly dynamic cast including Ewan McGregor as the dashing captain of the King's guard, Nicholas Hoult (""Warm Bodies"") as a lovable head-in-the-clouds hero named Jack, the very lovely Eleanor Tomlinson as Princess Isabelle, Stanley Tucci as the villainous Lord Roderick and Bill Nighy (""Underworld"") doing the voice-acting for the giant general.Ultimately the story and performances themselves aren't particularly inspiring (writers didn't give them much to work with) while the musical score is pretty standard (hate to say generic), the FX are nothing particularly spectacular but they're respectable and I actually did end up liking the giants; also lots of lavish costumes and cool vistas, some edge-of-your-seat action sequences and a hero & heroine with decent chemistry, all kept me watching when I came really close to turning it off during the first 5 minutes.  I'm sure this film would've benefitted from a more powerful villain, less adolescent grossness and maybe a bit more magic but I think it would make a nice springboard to a sequel (there's some good material here) as long as it added more complexity and scope.Again, it's fairly entertaining with a good rewatchability factor (which is why I bought it after renting in HD no less), much better than a similar fairy-tale retake (i.e. ""Snow White & the Huntsman"") and I also think it's worth mentioning that this film is surprisingly clean given there's very little profanity, lewdness or gratuitous violence as the ""slaying"" Jack does is more metaphorical than literal.  :o)",4,Don't B Quick 2 Dismiss this One,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,1610,"['Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'fun', 'little', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'surprisingly', 'dynamic', 'cast', 'including', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'dashing', 'captain', 'King', 'guard', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'lovable', 'head-in-the-clouds', 'hero', 'named', 'Jack', 'very', 'lovely', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'Princess', 'Isabelle', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'villainous', 'Lord', 'Roderick', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Underworld', 'doing', 'voice-acting', 'giant', 'general.Ultimately', 'story', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'inspiring', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'work', 'musical', 'score', 'pretty', 'standard', 'hate', 'say', 'generic', 'FX', 'are', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'spectacular', ""'re"", 'respectable', 'actually', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'giants', 'also', 'lots', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'cool', 'vistas', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'action', 'sequences', 'hero', 'heroine', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'kept', 'watching', 'when', 'came', 'really', 'close', 'turning', 'off', 'first', '5', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefitted', 'more', 'powerful', 'villain', 'less', 'adolescent', 'grossness', 'maybe', 'bit', 'more', 'magic', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'nice', 'springboard', 'sequel', 'good', 'material', 'here', 'as', 'long', 'added', 'more', 'complexity', 'scope.Again', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'good', 'rewatchability', 'factor', 'why', 'bought', 'renting', 'HD', 'no', 'less', 'much', 'better', 'similar', 'fairy-tale', 'retake', 'i.e', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'also', 'think', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'clean', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'profanity', 'lewdness', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'slaying', 'Jack', 'more', 'metaphorical', 'literal', 'o']",Jack the Giant Slayer
1474473,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005LAIHUO,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","Now that Robert Pattison's big series is over, and he has yet to make a successful film not associated with brooding vampires or hunky werewolves, Hollywood is searching for The Next Big Thing among the pool of eligible young actors.Enter Nicholas Hoult. Hoult has been around a while, he was literal Boy in ""About a Boy"", starring Hugh Grant as figurative boy and Toni Collette. Now that he is in his twenties, the studios are making a little push to position him as the NBT. He is currently in two big releases, which is a good sign, but only one of them is worth your attention, which is problematic.It makes sense that Hoult is being groomed for this new role; he's British, not hard on the eyes and he can act. RPats shares two of these three qualities. Slam! Any Twihards reading this review have no doubt clicked ""Not Helpful"" provided they understood the slam. Double Slam!But back to the reviews.Bryan Singer's (""The Usual Suspects"", ""X-Men"") new film was originally scheduled for last summer, but Warner Bros. delayed the release to ""enhance the special effects"". It is never a good sign when a studio delays the release of a film. If they liked the film and had confidence in it, they would have stuck to their guns and gone ahead with the release. Instead, they are ""enhancing the effects"" and the marketplace is ""too crowded"".It's easy to see why the studio lost faith. ""Jack"" isn't very good. A lot of money was spent on the creation of the CGI giants. They look good, but they also look like CGI creations. In a live-action film, CGI should blend in more seamlessly and not look fake and cartoony.In fact, none of the recent grown-up adaptations of fairy tales has been memorable. ""Red Riding Hood"" is a bad, blatant attempt to capitalize on the success of ""Twilight"", complete with two hunky male leads fighting each other for the girl. Both ""Snow White"" films were problematic; one is too goofy and cornball, the other is anchored by a starlet who can't act working with Charlize Theron who chews the scenery throughout. ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (sequel on the way, folks) is a gory revenge tale with a brother and sister with different accents fighting off witches throughout.The other big use of CGI in the film, the beanstalks, is pretty well done. Somehow, these creations, wild, unpredictable and massive, seem much more real because they don't have any human characteristics.""Jack"" begins with a flashback - both young Jack and a young Princess Isabelle are told the tale of King Erik who defeats the cannibalistic giants and banishes them to their own land, in the clouds. His magical crown and the beans needed to grow beanstalks that can reach the giant's land are buried with the King. Jack is frightened by the tale which Isabelle embraces as a fairy tale.  Flash forward 10 years and Jack now lives with his Uncle who sends Jack into town to sell their cart and their last horse to help keep their floundering farm afloat. But he is quickly distracted by a young woman watching a panto show. When he realizes she might be in trouble, he tries to help, but the King's guards, Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and Crowe (Eddie Marsan), arrive to save Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson). Roderick (Stanley Tucci), the King's (Ian McShane) advisor, has uncovered the crown and beans and has a secret plan simmering. Long story short, Jack gets hold of the beans and one grows under his Uncle's farmhouse, trapping Isabelle there. Soon, the two world's clash and Wicke (voiced by Ewan Bremmer) leads his giants into battle against the humans.There is a lot of good production design in ""Jack""; the prologue is illustrated with panto characters, much like the `Deadly Hallows"" sequence in the last ""Harry Potter"" film. And the castle is beautiful. But this is definitely a case of the filmmakers putting all of their eggs in one (or two) baskets. Much of their time and energy was spent on the look, leaving little left for character development or story.Once the film gets going, it is basically one long chase. The princess gets stuck in Giant Land, leading Jack, Roderick, Elmont and other members of the King's guard to begin climbing the beanstalk. Once there, they try to elude the murderous beasts as they search for the princess. Eventually, they make their way back to the kingdom but giants are fast on their heels and attack the castle, trying to extract their long-gestating revenge. This makes for a fast-paced film, which is good, but does nothing for the characters and doesn't exactly make a complicated or involving story. For instance, when we meet Jack in `Present Day', he is now living with his uncle, but there is never a mention about what happened to his father or how this might have shaped the young man's life.Princess Isabelle, as played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is completely forgettable. There is an attempt to make her a self-reliant, plucky young royal. The moment we first meet her is a good indicator of how her character is to be viewed; despite her independent nature, she needs to be saved by the Royal Guard, to protect her from an unruly man. Not exactly a great role model for the tweens in the audience. This unfortunately holds true throughout the film because she quickly ends up as a Damsel in Distress, hanging on Jack's arm.Hoult isn't given much to do. He runs around, trying to evade the giants before he realizes he has to stand up and fight. Naturally, he finds courage he never knew he had when the need arises. Not very interesting. Strangely, his costume in the film looks like it was purchased at Hollister or the Gap; he really looks like he is wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie. This lack of detail only serves to draw us out of the time, place and story.McGregor, Tucci, McShane and Marsan are all more interesting than the two leads, but they are also given more to do. McGregor has the swagger and confidence you would expect from the head of the Royal Guard. But he also has a twinkle to his eye that brings in a touch of the comic book superhero. Tucci's Roderick is plotting to overthrow the King while he plays along with King's plans to marry him to Princess Isabelle. It is a funny, strange and interesting role. McShane is perfect as the blustery, unaware monarch. And Marsan plays against type as a member of the Royal Guard.""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is a very uneven film. If the filmmakers had been as interested in the characters as they were in the special effects, this aspect of the movie would have been greatly improved. As a result, the entire film would have been much better and memorable.For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW. The sad thing is that the failure of these films is not always the actor's fault. Those that can act often get cast in bad films, or poorly marketed films. Cast him in a period costume romance and then a hard hitting urban drama. The tweens who made his first film a huge hit will surely follow and the success will follow. Or not.I think Hoult can and will rise above the failure of ""Jack""; he got many good reviews for ""Warm Bodies"", he had a small, but interesting role in ""A Single Man"", he was on the BBC version of ""Skins"". In other words, he can act. His agents and handlers just need to steer him away from some of the more iffy blockbusters. If a balance can be reached, Hoult can become a fixture of Hollywood. Hell, he might even end up seated next to Nicholson at a future Oscar ceremony.",2,Fe Fi Ho-Hum,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,7657,"['Now', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'big', 'series', 'yet', 'make',

1474474,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAIHUO,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 0]","So here's the thing: the trailer for this movie shows off what look like abysmal, obviously CGI giants unconvincing in our age of digital realism.  It turned me off from going to see this in the theater.  But after watching it and being pleasantly pleased by the fairy tale fantasy, less than satisfying CGI aside, I realized that this movie was made to be seen in 3D on the big screen and would have come across quite well there.  It translates well to the small screen too though what best lifts it are leads Jack (Nicholas Hoult), the king's commander Elmont (Ewan McGregor), and king's advisor/ all around bad guy Roderick (Stanley Tucci) who all turn in fetching and compelling performances that draw and keep you in this movie through Jack's earnestness, Elmont's dedication and valor, and Roderick's arrogant determination.  The special effects, while important, end up taking a back seat to the engaging human cast.The story is rather simple: Jack has a crush on the king's daughter who somehow manages to end up at Jack's residence when he drops some magic beans that get wet, grow, and land them up in the giant's domain.  The giant's, who like human pot pies and who wouldn't ruling the land of men again, are thrown off by the king's evil advisor who has found a way to control them and will use them to take over the world himself.  But that doesn't quite work out and man and giant ultimately do battle with Jack, of course, figuring out the way to save the day (and nab the princess at the same time).",4,A giant round of applause for the giant slayer.,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,1516,"['So', 'here', 'thing', 'trailer', 'movie', 'off', 'what', 'look', 'abysmal', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'giants', 'unconvincing', 'age', 'digital', 'realism', 'turned', 'off', 'going', 'see', 'theater', 'watching', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'pleased', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fantasy', 'less', 'satisfying', 'CGI', 'aside', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'seen', '3D', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'quite', 'well', 'there', 'well', 'small', 'screen', 'too', 'what', 'best', 'lifts', 'are', 'Jack', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'king', 'commander', 'Elmont', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'king', 'advisor/', 'bad', 'guy', 'Roderick', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'who', 'turn', 'fetching', 'compelling', 'performances', 'draw', 'keep', 'movie', 'Jack', 'earnestness', 'Elmont', 'dedication', 'valor', 'Roderick', 'arrogant', 'determination', 'special', 'effects', 'important', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'engaging', 'human', 'cast.The', 'story', 'rather', 'simple', 'Jack', 'crush', 'king', 'daughter', 'who', 'somehow', 'manages', 'end', 'up', 'Jack', 'residence', 'when', 'magic', 'beans', 'get', 'wet', 'grow', 'land', 'up', 'giant', 'domain', 'giant', 'who', 'human', 'pot', 'pies', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'ruling', 'land', 'men', 'again', 'are', 'thrown', 'off', 'king', 'evil', 'advisor', 'who', 'found', 'way', 'control', 'will', 'use', 'take', 'over', 'world', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'man', 'giant', 'ultimately', 'do', 'battle', 'Jack', 'course', 'figuring', 'out', 'way', 'save', 'day', 'princess', 'same', 'time']",Jack the Giant Slayer

1474480,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005LAIHUO,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","Jack The Giant Slayer has set a record that no one should be proud of. This film made the least amount of money, compared to the amount of money spent on it, in box office history! The film gives new meaning to the word bomb, as it cost the studio approximately 80 million dollars! The goal of this film was ambitious, but the problem was that it completely misses all of it's target audiences. The writers wanted to take the story of Jack & The Beanstalk and adapt it for more mature audiences. Parts of it almost seemed like they were looking to make it an epic adventure, like the Lord of The Rings, but the Lord of The Rings it is not. The problem with this film is that while they built up the intensity, they didn't go far enough to make adults want to see it. On the flip side, with all the added death and violence, it garnered a PG-13 rating, which meant that younger kids weren't going to see it either. Personally, I liked what they did with the story and I think Nicholas Hoult is a terrific actor, but the way they wrote this film was just a disaster waiting to happen. When they build up the suspense and something is about to happen, they don't show it, because it would be too intense for the kids. When they go the comedic route, the fart jokes, bees in the helmet, and gigantic bad breath is a turn off to the adults. At times I felt like I was watching a kids movie, while at other times I felt as though I was watching one of these three an a half hour epic trilogies. The film couldn't decide how it wanted to go and as a result, it didn't appeal to very many.

Sam Raimi, too. Even Terry Gilliam. It's only natural that Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"" ""X-Men"") directs the updated version of the famous fairy tale. And like many previous efforts, the film is visually attractive, but needs better storytelling.Nicholas Hoult plays a young farm boy Jack, who falls in love with Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who runs away from the palace. When the Princess has been carried away up into the sky (in a rather contrived fashion), Jack volunteers to join the rescue party including scheming Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) and the King's elite guard Elmont (Ewan McGregor).The story takes too much time to get going, with a prologue about the giants and back stories about the main characters, but once it gets started, the film is entertaining with thrilling action set-pieces, in which human actors, motion-capture giants and CG-created beanstalks blend pretty effectively. Special effects are decent, if not outstanding, and the sceneries and castle of the Kingdom of Cloister are beautiful to see.For all the enjoyable action sequences, however the film has a feel of ""been there, done that."" Two young stars do their best, but, likeable as they are, the hero and heroine are bland, and I wanted to see more of Ewan McGregor's dashing Elmont, which is the best part of the film.""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is just an OK adventure film that is in need of creative ideas on how to tell a familiar story.

Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie that strives to follow in the footsteps of The Princess Bride but falters.  It's not that it necessarily is a bad movie, it just doesn't fully realize its goals.  That's the main thing I walked away with after seeing Jack the Giant Slayer.The story, naturally, is an action centric retelling of the classic Jack and the Beanstalk.  Naturally the story centers on Jack (Nicholas Hoult) a farm boy who comes by some magic beans.  One rainy evening the princess of the kingdom runs away from home and winds up in Jack's house to escape the rain.  Before the two can get to better know one another the rain activates the beans which take the princess away to the land of giants far above the clouds.  Determined to save the princess Jack joins the knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and his men to climb the beanstalk and rescue the princess.If you couldn't tell already this is a silly movie.  The plot is silly, the characters are over the top, and the special effects are cartoony.  That's clearly what the movie is going for, but if reading that immediately turns you off from it than I doubt you'll have much fun with Jack the Giant Slayer.Bryan Singer is a talented director, but the film just doesn't have enough substance to hit home.  There is humor, and occasionally some good bits of action, but the plot is predictable, and there isn't enough material for the cast to work with.  There are moments that work where you as a viewer really can see what the filmmakers were going for, but these moments are too few.Ewan McGregor is the shining light of the film.  As the knight Elmont, McGregor completely steals the show.  Watching McGregor's performance you can see what the movie was striving for, and if script and everyone else in the cast could match him the film would have been a lot better.  It's the kind of ""I've seen everything and never panic no matter the situation"" type character and its clear McGregor has a blast from start to finish.  He's having fun, and I as a viewer was having fun with him.  So if you're at all a fan of Ewan McGregor Jack the Giant Slayer is worth a watch.Jack the Giant Slayer doesn't come anywhere close to reaching the lofty standards of The Princess Bride, but I didn't regret watching it.  There's some decent action here, some good visuals there, and Ewan McGregor's performance is fun.
