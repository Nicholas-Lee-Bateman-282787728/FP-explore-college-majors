Lighting looks like a bare 150 watt ceiling bulb was used.  Supporting cast are even worse actors than Willie.

They extract their own version of justice when Holden lures them below the border, with hopes of causing their deaths.I don't know why the &quot;R&quot; rating.  The violence was almost non-existent, no bad language, and no nudity or anything you would be ashamed for your mother or children to see.Only Tritt and Willie sang in the film, and the motivation of Holden was ill-defined.  Altogether a poorly motivated plot, with the cast providing the backbone of the film.  They did their parts well, making it an adequate Western to watch and kill some time, thanks to them.  Not a great film, or particularlt memorable.I am always impressed by Kris and Willie when they team up.  Kris is good at &quot;looking menacing,&quot; and Willie is entertaining.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books",3,"a cast of singers, but only a couple of songs",1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,1263,"['Rated', 'R', 'Not', 'sale', 'persons', 'age', '18.Studio', 'Lionsgate/FoxVideo', 'Release', 'Date', 'May', '20', '2003Cast', 'Willie', 'NelsonKris', 'KristoffersonWaylon', 'JenningsTravis', 'TrittChad', 'WilletJonathan', 'BanksSancho', 'Gracia', 'Holden', 'bad', 'guy', 'A', 'bunch', 'former', 'outlaws', 'Willie', 'Kris', 'Tritt', 'are', 'bent', 'revenge', 'when', 'one', 'former', 'quot', 'business', 'associates', 'quot', 'Jennings', 'murdered', 'outlaw', 'Holden', 'Sancho', 'Gracia', 'extract', 'own', 'version', 'justice', 'when', 'Holden', 'border', 'hopes', 'causing', 'deaths.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'violence', 'was', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'ashamed', 'mother', 'children', 'see.Only', 'Tritt', 'Willie', 'sang', 'film', 'motivation', 'Holden', 'was', 'ill-defined', 'poorly', 'motivated', 'plot', 'cast', 'providing', 'backbone', 'film', 'did', 'parts', 'well', 'making', 'adequate', 'Western', 'watch', 'kill', 'time', 'thanks', 'Not', 'great', 'film', 'particularlt', 'memorable.I', 'am', 'always', 'impressed', 'Kris', 'Willie', 'when', 'team', 'up', 'Kris', 'good', 'quot', 'looking', 'menacing', 'quot', 'Willie', 'entertaining.Joseph', 'Joe', 'Pierreauthor', 'Handguns', 'Freedom', 'care', 'maintenanceand', 'other', 'books']",N/A
