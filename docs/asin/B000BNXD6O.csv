And it wasn't going to be released, so we have to thank the success of `Lost', which of course also stars Matthew Fox.This show is an emotional journey, from start to finish.  It very maturely handles tough topics that most teenagers will come across at some stage (hopefully not all of the problems!), without preaching and is handled realistically and without being too cheesy; breakdown of marriages, death, muggings, lesbianism, adoption, jealousy, teenage rebellion, truancy, family problems and so many more important subjects.  This isn't just a teen show though, the script is very maturely written, and all the characters are likeable and you feel for their pain. (To be honest, there isn't an episode that I watch that doesn't get me teary eyed at some point).  All the performances are excellent, and I recommend this show to any parents who want their teens to watch a positive show with a message.Let's hope the distributor has a bit more respect for those who have bought the series and are waiting for Season 3!",5,about time!!!!!,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1125,"['2', 'whole', 'years', 'release', 'first', 'series', 'classic', 'show', 'finally', 'get', 'Season', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'released', 'have', 'thank', 'success', 'Lost', 'course', 'also', 'Matthew', 'Fox.This', 'show', 'emotional', 'journey', 'start', 'finish', 'very', 'maturely', 'tough', 'topics', 'most', 'teenagers', 'will', 'come', 'across', 'stage', 'hopefully', 'not', 'problems', 'preaching', 'handled', 'realistically', 'being', 'too', 'cheesy', 'breakdown', 'marriages', 'death', 'muggings', 'lesbianism', 'adoption', 'jealousy', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'truancy', 'family', 'problems', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'important', 'subjects', ""n't"", 'just', 'teen', 'show', 'script', 'very', 'maturely', 'written', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'feel', 'pain', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'episode', 'watch', ""n't"", 'get', 'teary', 'eyed', 'point', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'recommend', 'show', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'teens', 'watch', 'positive', 'show', 'message.Let', 'hope', 'distributor', 'bit', 'more', 'respect', 'who', 'have', 'bought', 'series', 'are', 'waiting', 'Season', '3']",Party of Five: Season 2

946012,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000BNXD6O,MollyRK,"[3, 3]","I was really afraid that the second season of this beautiful show was never going to be released, but I am very glad they have decided to go ahead with it. Apparently this is the public's last chance to get out and buy the two boxed sets that are already out and give the company a valid reason to start working on the last four season sets. I am not sure whether or not that will happen, but with a show this good I sincerely hope that it is immortalized through the release of every single season.The difficulty the studio has had getting these DVD's out is almost frighteningly similar to the plight the show experienced when it was running on the air in the mid-90's. Nobody knew if they liked it; perhaps they weren't really sure what to even think of it. Perhaps this is because of the incredibly thick layer of drama woven into the show--many fans have liked it and respected it for taking that leap of faith, but for others it might just be too much. One thing about Party of Five that nobody can deny--it is not the least bit scared to lay it thick with the drama. I am serious; I have never seen any other contemporary television show function--and SUCCEED--by depicting young characters with these many problems, poor decision making, and struggles to stay above water. Every single episode is literally just packed with one incredibly dramatic issue after another.For those who may not know, the basic premise of this show follows the plight of five siblings ranging from ages 2 to mid-20's. These kids have lost their parents in a car crash, have somehow managed to stay together, and are now trying to establish a whole new family dynamic for themselves. Well, Season 1 was more of an indication of that given theme; the siblings were closer and banded together more back then. By Season 2, there was a considerable amount of independence coming from each of them, and while they remained a family they branched out a bit more, finding preoccupation with their own lives and personal situations. This was probably one of the best seasons in the series, because the Salinger clan was still young and their issues didn't yet become completely out of control. ""The Wedding,"" which portrays Kirsten and Charlie's nightmarish wedding day, is a standout episode in the season and even the entire series, and that episode alone is worth the purchase of the whole season set.Party of Five is hardly a light and warm show that depicts how these kids band together and have a super-close, fuzzy relationship. It's far from that. If you get into this show, you're going to start witnessing five very different people with problems all their own. This season finds 25-year-old Charlie, a nice guy doing what he can to meet the needs of his younger siblings but fearing that his whole life has already been mapped out and struggles mercilessly with commitment (and if you think he's bad here, wait until you see him in later seasons). High school senior Bailey is trying hard to bail his big brother out and take care of everything, but at the same time he is fighting desperately for any and every moment of fun and independence he can gain for himself. 17-year-old Julia continues to battle with her partying ways and falls prey to some worse-case scenario teen pressures without a mother around to guide her. 12-year-old Claudia wants and deserves a family to take care of her but is discovering every day, more and more, that her siblings have their own affairs and that she is basically fending for herself. Then there's toddler Owen, who is...well, he's a toddler being raised by his older siblings instead of a mother and father. Enough said. (And quite honestly, with everything going on with the four older Salinger kids, it's fascinating that this baby is being taken care of at all. But that is a separate story.)One episode of this show is likely to leave you feeling emotionally drained. You want to see these kids do well and be OK with all the tragedy and societal pressures they have had to encounter, but in classic Party of Five tradition, what you actually get is a raw and relatively true-to-life account on what happens when five young, immature kids are left to be on their own without parents. No, they don't just hug and hold each other and live a sticky sweet life with one another; they experience those typical youth struggles every single day, with a newfound independence that sounds good but often leaves them with a life that that they aren't necessarily mature enough to handle just yet.This is not to say, in any way, that the show is horrible and that it doesn't display any good family emotions. Yes, these siblings love one another and when the chips are down they are always going to be there for each other, but the road Party of Five goes down indicates the trials that kids go through and the trouble they tend to fall into when Mom and Dad aren't around to take care of them and keep them in shape. They have all this freedom and don't seem to be quite sure how to best deal with it, so they basically end up doing whatever they want (with frightening results most of the time). It's a gutsy, gutsy show; there's no denying that. Your heart reaches out to all five of them, which is a tribute to the nice acting given by Matthew Fox, Scott Wolf, Neve Campbell, and Lacey Chabert.As these characters grow, develop, and change over the years, ther is always at least one of them with whom you can truly identify, and sometimes that changes as you yourself grow and find yourself experiencing some of the same things that they are. For me, I was especially touched by the performance of Lacey Chabert as youngest sister Claudia. It is really very heartbreaking to watch this 12-year-old kid be blatantly ignored by her older siblings, who love her but don't really have much time for her with everything that's going on in their personal lives. You really feel for her as she learns that she's pretty much on her own in stepping headfirst into the scary world of adolescence. She is, in many ways, the conscience of the show, with some impressive lines that leave you both surprised and cheering on that beyond-her-years wisdom.For the most part, the development of the five Salinger kids was very well done and an incredibly realistic portrayal, given the circumstances surrounding the plot. The only character that really annoys me on a consistent basis is Julia, who always seems to just be doing the most random stupid things, even for a misguided teenage girl, and I don't see as much realism in her character as with the rest of the kids. However, there are plenty of good things for all 5 of them, and in general it works just fine.All in all, it is a very emotionally charged and powerful show that may raise a lot of questions and present a lot of controversial and taboo issues (e.g. teen pregnancy, abortion, underage drinking, unfaithfulness in relationships), but in short you'll be getting something empowering that isn't afraid to grapple with the less sunshine-y side of life.Unfortunately, I have a bad feeling that the remaining 4 seasons will not be released on DVD anytime soon, and possibly not even at all. It is truly a shame that this series has not done as well in DVD sales, for whatever reason. Part of the reason may be because the rights to the original music have not been permitted and they had to change it for the first 2 DVD seasons. In any case, it seems like it's going to take a miracle for the whole series to come out, but I guess we can only just keep hoping!",5,Thank you for this release!!!!,1138320000,"01 27,

It's a nice family show and teens/young adults would enjoy it. It's a 90's show but is relevant to today's issues in the real world. Enjoyed it.
