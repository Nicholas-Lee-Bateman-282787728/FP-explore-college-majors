541175,A3FV933KPQHTZV,B00003CXXY,555,"[4, 7]","I watched this movie last night, and i'm so dumbfounded and amazed by it I cant really think straight this morning. One word to describe this movie...? There is none... its so many things put together into one whole great movie motion picture. Monica Bellucci was amazing, and beautiful as always, and I dont think anybody else could have played a better Malena. The story was so sad, yet utterly beautiful at the same time, especialy the end when Malena returns to the village, despite all the terrible things they did to her, with her husband. I was so moved by this movie, I'm going to show it to all my freinds and everybody I know. The only thing I was a bit upset with was this DVD version. I watched the trailer before the movie, and on the trailer it shows the famous scene where Malena is lying down on the chair outside on the porch, lightly glazing a paper towel over her face and neck. That scene wasnt even in the movie!!! Geez, I really should get the FULL version, but whatever... it was still great, and since this DVD is cut to more appropriate srandards (despite its still unjustly rated R, and you can get it in Canada with a 14A rating) more people who are offended by nudity or whatever (thats really stupid but some people are) can see this version and appreciate it just as much. I love this movie to death, and there hasnt been any other greater than it since Amelie.",5,Fantastic Beyond Imagination,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,1391,"['watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'i', ""'m"", 'so', 'dumbfounded', 'amazed', 'cant', 'really', 'think', 'straight', 'morning', 'One', 'word', 'describe', 'movie', 'none', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'whole', 'great', 'movie', 'motion', 'picture', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'was', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'always', 'dont', 'think', 'anybody', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'better', 'Malena', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'yet', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'especialy', 'end', 'when', 'Malena', 'village', 'terrible', 'things', 'did', 'her', 'husband', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'show', 'freinds', 'everybody', 'know', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'bit', 'upset', 'was', 'DVD', 'version', 'watched', 'trailer', 'movie', 'trailer', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Malena', 'lying', 'down', 'chair', 'porch', 'lightly', 'glazing', 'paper', 'towel', 'face', 'neck', 'scene', 'wasnt', 'even', 'movie', 'Geez', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'FULL', 'version', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'DVD', 'cut', 'more', 'appropriate', 'srandards', 'still', 'unjustly', 'rated', 'R', 'can', 'get', 'Canada', '14A', 'rating', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'offended', 'nudity', 'thats', 'really', 'stupid', 'people', 'are', 'can', 'see', 'version', 'appreciate', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'death', 'there', 'hasnt', 'been', 'other', 'greater', 'Amelie']",Malena
541176,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,B00003CXXY,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[1, 2]","It begins with a stunning walk along and proud as she moves, morbid vision, Que culo! And suddenly, Renato's blood changes tide towards his low head, and Bang, the very first reaction of sexual excitement, now a teen who begins his coming of age quite desperately for sex, the more he sees and learns about Malena, the more the sexual appetite for her becomes a tender and true love never to be forgotten. It continues as he spies her beauty at night trough a window dressed only with a black underwear, she cleans the floor in dancing into remembrance, and suddenly, her blouse falls down and Wow, the most beautiful and voluptuous breast ever seen is hang loose, the poor boy can't control his agitated breeding and heart pounding, Amoroso is caught. From now on, the teen will center his world around this haunting woman, untouchable and enchanting, a Goddess, (Pobre Amoroso, desarrollara un compulsivo masturbatorio; pero quien le puede culpar?). Lusted by every man and hated by every woman in this Hell Town, Malena is alone, but behind her is little Renato, unseen yet close, this is a love story between a woman and a man who will never get to know each other, Buena fortuna Miss Malena, she glimpses back to the teen, an smile shows and fates away quickly, this are all the words Renato will ever say to her, then she goes away.Set in World War II in a small Italian town by the sea, Malena is a dear telling of adolescence blossoming into manhood with all the bitter sweet memories, both funny and dramatic, ending in a live time idealistic canvas. Giuseppe Tornatore narrates this piece with a very evident closeness to his own experiences and heart, and this is what saves the film from being a corny story of coming of age. Delicate and tender, with a kinky humor, Malena begins as a sexual comedy and changes in the most naturally way into a drama of miss judgment and envy of internal and external beauty, leaving a nostalgic taste of past ghosts. Very much criticized in its native Italy, (for whatever reason), the film is not about social exposure, this happens to be the setting, the movie is about young love in a Small Town Big Hell, and those rotten minds that forced this honorable woman to turn into a what the envious wanted to be. So, when her husband surprisingly comes back from War where he was presumed dead, he finds himself as Malena, alone and attacked by those disposable town characters, only Renato helped and told the truth, as he was silently saying good bye to Malena when she was living the town by that cruel social expulsion. The main problem is that the scrip turns weak at some moments, and doesn't let the story develops in a much sharp and complete way, fortunately Tornatore directs the film in a personal approach, utilizing his characters to charm effortlessly, maintaining the narration fresh and moving with a pace that allows the events to be exposed elegantly, Malena is a good film, but not as good as Tornatore's best pictures (like Cinema Paradiso or The legend of 1900). The main actors are perfect in their roles (excellent casting), Giuseppe Sulfaro as Renato, conveys his characters with grace and tenderness, Malena, portrayed by the always amazing Monica Bellucci, gives a simple accurate and beautiful performance, her talent and beauty was exactly what the character needed, only an Italian actress could have fit that role (Italian Woman are unique) and Monica covers all the angles adding voluptuous turns of fragile state of woman. The great Ennio Morricone delivers another fine soundtrack, making more emotional the key moments and the not so emotional ones, and Lajos Koltai photography magnifies those Italian landscapes with a deep understanding of the story colors. Like with The Legend of 1900 and Cinema Paradiso, Malena was cut for American theaters, only because of a faster pacing and censorship of the delicate nude scenes, (again repressed minds takes on stupid decisions), the European un-mutilated version is superior, with bigger and better extras on it's DVD, but region 1 and region 2 versions (PAL 2) have both the advantage of great visual and optimal sound transferring. Finally, the greatest quality of this film is something that has become more and more rare in worldwide films, it has unforgettable characters, they will stay with you for a very long time.

541178,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B00003CXXY,alex bushman,"[6, 15]","This is a story of an Italian boy who grows a adolescent infatuation with a married woman who is so beautiful that she is horribly gossiped about.  Here are the reasons this is a bad film. 1)The film often drifts into the fantasies of the main character(all of them are about Malena). At one point, this is so prevalent you wonder sometimes what's real and not. You also start to wonder why the filmaker did this and I have no real answer except that he couldn't come up with anything else.  These dream sequences pull the film away from a grounding reality that the film fails to establish. 2)The title character is almost non-existant as a real character.  We see her in real life and in fantasy, but she hardly says anything, or reveals anything about her inner character.  This makes her a hollow basis for the film because she is in fact hollow and the character who is infatuated is vacuous as well. 3) The combination of these characteristics makes this film get to its conclusion heavyhandedly and it never feels real even if the results at the time were close to what we see.  Dramatically, it's just dumb and vacuous.  You wish it were more because you feel that Malena would have something interesting to say, but the filmaker chose not to.  These things only approach my biggest gripes with the film.  The gossip sequences, which are many, seem flippant and careless, and not the razor-sharped judgement that they would have to be in order to be a real factor in her life, which they are in the film. Sloppy, just sloppy storytelling.  How the film ends is also very telling of just how bad this film truly is.  He speaks about how he's loved many women, but the one he remembers best is Malena, the ideal that never came to grips with.  An ending like this would be good if the film developed a relationship beyond what is in this film.  This would be compelling if the protagonist was someone with more of a vocal perspective rather than a visual one.  As is, it would have been far more effective to use yet another fantasy to illustrate her historic importance to him, but by then I'm sure that the film would seem incredibly redundant because of the rest of it.  If this film had established the strong importance of the difference between fantasy and reality and how the protagonist felt about that it would be better.  The film doesn't take this road, however, by putting in the scenes of harsh realism which aren't earned from the deadpan, flippant tone of the rest of the film.",2,Lopsided film that doesn't have much life,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,2498,"['story', 'Italian', 'boy', 'who', 'adolescent', 'infatuation', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'beautiful', 'horribly', 'gossiped', 'Here', 'are', 'reasons', 'bad', 'film', '1', 'film', 'often', 'fantasies', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'Malena', 'one', 'point', 'so', 'prevalent', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'what', 'real', 'not', 'also', 'start', 'wonder', 'why', 'filmaker', 'did', 'have', 'real', 'answer', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'else', 'dream', 'sequences', 'pull', 'film', 'away', 'grounding', 'reality', 'film', 'establish', '2', 'title', 'character', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'real', 'character', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'fantasy', 'hardly', 'anything', 'reveals', 'anything', 'inner', 'character', 'hollow', 'basis', 'film', 'fact', 'hollow', 'character', 'who', 'infatuated', 'vacuous', 'as', 'well', '3', 'combination', 'characteristics', 'film', 'get', 'conclusion', 'heavyhandedly', 'never', 'real', 'even', 'results', 'time', 'were', 'close', 'what', 'see', 'Dramatically', 'just', 'dumb', 'vacuous', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'feel', 'Malena', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'interesting', 'say', 'filmaker', 'chose', 'not', 'things', 'only', 'approach', 'biggest', 'gripes', 'film', 'gossip', 'sequences', 'are', 'many', 'seem', 'flippant', 'careless', 'not', 'razor-sharped', 'judgement', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'order', 'be', 'real', 'factor', 'life', 'are', 'film', 'Sloppy', 'just', 'sloppy', 'storytelling', 'How', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'telling', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'truly', 'how', 'loved', 'many', 'women', 'one', 'best', 'Malena', 'ideal', 'never', 'came', 'grips', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'developed', 'relationship', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'compelling', 'protagonist', 'was', 'someone', 'more', 'vocal', 'perspective', 'rather', 'visual', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'use', 'yet', 'fantasy', 'illustrate', 'historic', 'importance', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'redundant', 'rest', 'film', 'had', 'established', 'strong', 'importance', 'difference', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'how', 'protagonist', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'road', 'however', 'putting', 'scenes', 'harsh', 'realism', 'are', ""n't"", 'earned', 'deadpan', 'flippant', 'tone', 'rest', 'film']",Malena
541179,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00003CXXY,Allan M. Lees,"[2, 2]","At the outset this seems to be a classic ""coming of age"" movie in which the young male protagonist is center-stage. Some of the early scenes are genuinely funny, and some of the ""Italian family on steroids"" moments almost seem to be played for laughs. But then, suddenly, much as a cold gust of wind might blow over an Autumn picnic, the mood changes. Malena is the beautiful young wife of a soldier and then, suddenly, a widow. The most attractive woman in the village she is immediately prey to all the exploiters, the vainglorious, the pompous - the fat and ugly men who stayed at home in safety while cheering on younger and braver men to go and die for the glory of the absurd dictator Mussolini. Left with no alternative except starvation, Malena becomes a whore. In time she sleeps with pretty much anyone who can provide her with some temporary measure of security, whether it be a bag of food or a respite from her dreary life. When the war comes to an end, the same crowds who cheered Il Duce so enthusiastically cheer the American soldiers - and in the background the women of the town seize their chance to beat and disfigure Malena. And the crowd watches it happen, as though it were a Roman circus. This is the most powerful and disturbing moment in the film because it is so depressingly true to life. At the moment of her greatest suffering and her greatest need of aid, no one comes to Malena's side - not even the young boy who adores her. Everyone just stands and watches.So this is really a movie about lost innocence, but a loss of innocence quite different from that which we initially expected. Here the loss is of faith in the ultimate benevolence of human nature. The townspeople are shallow, spiteful, viscious, and without moral compass. In the end, when Malena and her not-dead-after-all husband return to the town, they make great show of being nice to Malena now that she's got a few wrinkes and has gained a few pounds. But no one has learned anything. They people are still what they were, and could turn again at a moment's notice into the rabid mob of old, or the applauding crowd always ready to worship a powerful leader. Malena's husband is a shadow of the virile young man who set out to war years earlier and Malena herself is only a fraction of what she was. And the young boy, now a young man, remains haunted - but now he's haunted by a dream of something infinitely precious that was broken and spoiled for no good reason except the spitefulness of humanity.In short, this is not a ""happy ever after"" movie. But it is worth every moment. And the music is almost unbearably poignant. And, this review refers to the Italian version - apparently the US version is cut beyond redemption and not worth the price of a postage stamp.",5,Buy the Italian version,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,2769,"['outset', 'be', 'classic', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'young', 'male', 'protagonist', 'center-stage', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'Italian', 'family', 'steroids', 'moments', 'almost', 'seem', 'be', 'played', 'laughs', 'then', 'suddenly', 'much', 'cold', 'gust', 'wind', 'might', 'blow', 'Autumn', 'picnic', 'mood', 'changes', 'Malena', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'soldier', 'then', 'suddenly', 'widow', 'most', 'attractive', 'woman', 'village', 'immediately', 'prey', 'exploiters', 'vainglorious', 'pompous', 'fat', 'ugly', 'men', 'who', 'stayed', 'home', 'safety', 'cheering', 'younger', 'braver', 'men', 'go', 'die', 'glory', 'absurd', 'dictator', 'Mussolini', 'Left', 'alternative', 'starvation', 'Malena', 'whore', 'time', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'provide', 'temporary', 'measure', 'security', 'be', 'bag', 'food', 'respite', 'dreary', 'life', 'When', 'war', 'end', 'same', 'crowds', 'who', 'cheered', 'Il', 'Duce', 'so', 'enthusiastically', 'cheer', 'American', 'soldiers', 'background', 'women', 'town', 'seize', 'chance', 'beat', 'disfigure', 'Malena', 'crowd', 'happen', 'were', 'Roman', 'circus', 'most', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'moment', 'film', 'so', 'depressingly', 'true', 'life', 'moment', 'greatest', 'suffering', 'greatest', 'need', 'aid', 'one', 'Malena', 'side', 'not', 'even', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'Everyone', 'just', 'stands', 'watches.So', 'really', 'movie', 'lost', 'innocence', 'loss', 'innocence', 'quite', 'different', 'initially', 'expected', 'Here', 'loss', 'faith', 'ultimate', 'benevolence', 'human', 'nature', 'townspeople', 'are', 'shallow', 'spiteful', 'viscious', 'moral', 'compass', 'end', 'when', 'Malena', 'not-dead-after-all', 'husband', 'return', 'town', 'make', 'great', 'show', 'being', 'nice', 'Malena', 'now', 'got', 'few', 'wrinkes', 'gained', 'few', 'pounds', 'one', 'learned', 'anything', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'what', 'were', 'could', 'turn', 'again', 'moment', 'notice', 'rabid', 'mob', 'old', 'applauding', 'crowd', 'always', 'ready', 'worship', 'powerful', 'leader', 'Malena', 'husband', 'shadow', 'virile', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'war', 'years', 'earlier', 'Malena', 'only', 'fraction', 'what', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'now', 'young', 'man', 'haunted', 'now', 'haunted', 'dream', 'something', 'infinitely', 'precious', 'was', 'broken', 'spoiled', 'good', 'reason', 'spitefulness', 'humanity.In', 'short', 'not', 'happy', 'ever', 'movie', 'worth', 'moment', 'music', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'poignant', 'review', 'Italian', 'version', 'apparently', 'US', 'version', 'cut', 'redemption', 'not', 'price', 'postage', 'stamp']",Malena

The acting is first-rate and the story just draws you in right from the start.The movie is set during WWII in Sicily and is basically about the cruelty and social prejudice brought on by feelings of jealously and lust among mankind. In this case, the victim is the beautiful Malena who's the envy of the women in her town, the lust of the men, and the subject of cruel gossip by everyone. Her only &quot;fault&quot; is being born beautiful. When her husband is believed to have been killed in the war, she tries to look for a decent job to support herself but nobody would offer her one out of sheer prejudice. Even her father believes in the rumours and disowns her. The women, jealous of her, and the men, who couldn't obtain her, continue to spread malicious gossips all over town about her having an affair with so-and-so. Finally, driven by hunger and sheer destitute, she succumbs to using her body in exchange for food and money. All this while, a young boy (Renata) who thinks himself in love with Malena, tries to protect her from the malicious gossips. He does them secretly, so Malena never knows. Scenes involving Renata are usually very funny and provide plenty of laughs. After the war, the women get their revenge on Malena in the most horrible way, and that scene is painful to watch. How Malena picks up her life after that, you must watch the movie to find out. The last 5 minutes of the movie provides a wonderful closure and is worth the price of the ticket alone, so to speak.Great storyline apart, the beautiful and exquisite-looking Malena (played by Monica Bellucci) provides plenty of eye-candy (for the guys). For the girls, watch out for the appearance of the very handsome and dashing Lieutenant Cadel (played by Marcello Catalano) in his smart uniform, who alas, only appears in 3 scenes.In my opinion, this movie would have won (and deservedly so) the Oscar for Best Foreign Picture it was nominated for, had it not been for &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, another great movie.",5,Compelling!,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,2095,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'already', 'think', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'story', 'just', 'draws', 'right', 'start.The', 'movie', 'set', 'WWII', 'Sicily', 'basically', 'cruelty', 'social', 'prejudice', 'brought', 'feelings', 'jealously', 'lust', 'mankind', 'case', 'victim', 'beautiful', 'Malena', 'who', 'envy', 'women', 'town', 'lust', 'men', 'subject', 'cruel', 'gossip', 'everyone', 'Her', 'only', 'quot', 'fault', 'quot', 'being', 'born', 'beautiful', 'When', 'husband', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'war', 'look', 'decent', 'job', 'support', 'nobody', 'would', 'offer', 'one', 'out', 'sheer', 'prejudice', 'Even', 'father', 'rumours', 'disowns', 'women', 'jealous', 'men', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'obtain', 'continue', 'spread', 'malicious', 'gossips', 'town', 'having', 'affair', 'so-and-so', 'Finally', 'driven', 'hunger', 'sheer', 'destitute', 'succumbs', 'using', 'body', 'exchange', 'food', 'money', 'while', 'young', 'boy', 'Renata', 'who', 'love', 'Malena', 'protect', 'malicious', 'gossips', 'secretly', 'Malena', 'never', 'Scenes', 'involving', 'Renata', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'funny', 'provide', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'war', 'women', 'get', 'revenge', 'Malena', 'most', 'horrible', 'way', 'scene', 'painful', 'watch', 'How', 'Malena', 'up', 'life', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'closure', 'price', 'ticket', 'alone', 'speak.Great', 'storyline', 'apart', 'beautiful', 'exquisite-looking', 'Malena', 'played', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'plenty', 'eye-candy', 'guys', 'girls', 'watch', 'out', 'appearance', 'very', 'handsome', 'dashing', 'Lieutenant', 'Cadel', 'played', 'Marcello', 'Catalano', 'smart', 'uniform', 'who', 'alas', 'only', '3', 'scenes.In', 'opinion', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Picture', 'was', 'nominated', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'quot', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'quot', 'great', 'movie']",Malena

I would not rave about Monica Belucci's beauty; at first it did not even ocured to me that she was supposed to be beautiful. She resembles Isabelle Adjani a lot.  What knocked me out were the looks of the dilapidated Sicilian town of Siracusa where the film was shot.  It's not really a remote village but rather quite a decent size town; it would be considered a big city if it were here, in America.  But this is beside the point.I come to realize that it is a long-standing tradition of Italian intellectuals to mock Sicily for its backward attitudes, and probably deceivingly so.  Things must have changed since then, as it is unimaginable now, at least at the surface, such a barbarian, ancient and brutal attitude toward a woman.  It is heartbreaking to watch how the sanctimonious townfolks push the poor widow into prostitution and then outcasting her in the most horrendous way.  Somehow I am disappointed, though, that only a reappearance of her husband redeems her as a woman of dignity and admits her back into society.  I find it an utterly humiliating idea - did she not despise her torturers?  Was she really seeking their admitting her among themselves?  What it her husband would have indeed been killed?  I also wonder how someone could come back to a place that once treated her so brutally.  Perhaps it's an Italian syndrome called campanilismo, which means that a person has an inborn bond with a place of his birth.Overall, I would rate it as a success of the Italian cinema, although it's not as sophisticated as works of masters of the past and is rather simplistic in a presentation of the story, i.e. through the impression of an adolescent boy.

Set in Italy around WWII,  the story weaves significant themes, such as the courage to stand out, fear, conformity, fidelity, as well as the seemingly omnipresent autobiographical Tornatorre ideas - a boy coming of age, his infatuation with the most beautiful woman in town, the early experiences in life with death, war society, peace.The movie is richly narrated, not only visually (through the strong performance of Monica Bellucci, among others), but also through the beautiful music of Enio Morricone.While the movie will be interesting to those looking for a purely historic picture of Italy during WWII, people looking for an emotionally moving artistic experience.The two Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy and musical score - are richly deserved.",5,"A story of war, social conformity, love and life - through the eyes of a boy",1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,844,"['many', 'Tornatorre', 'movies', 'too', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'boy', 'Set', 'Italy', 'WWII', 'story', 'significant', 'themes', 'such', 'courage', 'stand', 'out', 'fear', 'conformity', 'fidelity', 'as', 'well', 'seemingly', 'omnipresent', 'autobiographical', 'Tornatorre', 'ideas', 'boy', 'coming', 'age', 'infatuation', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'town', 'early', 'experiences', 'life', 'death', 'war', 'society', 'peace.The', 'movie', 'richly', 'narrated', 'not', 'only', 'visually', 'strong', 'performance', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'others', 'also', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Enio', 'Morricone.While', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'looking', 'purely', 'historic', 'picture', 'Italy', 'WWII', 'people', 'looking', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'artistic', 'experience.The', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'cinematograpy', 'musical', 'score', 'are', 'richly', 'deserved']",Malena

Mesa,"[0, 0]","Titillating, tantalizing, and tragic are just a few adjectives that come to mind...It takes no genius to realize Monica Bellucci is one of the most drop dead gorgeous international beauties of the current cinema. She is the Italian version bonafide beauty of Catherine Zeta Jones ! If that isn't saying much...Belucci seems to play recurring roles of women in great distress and abuse.She does this so convincingly and makes it look so effortless that she is a rare actress who can say much with her facial expressions and actions without really saying much; It's all in the eyes, baby. Malena is the telling of a 27 year old widow left to fend for herself in a small Italian village after the downfall of her husband during WW2.No one will employ her and the women sell her rotten food;it's cruelty in severe doses for Malena. Her father has disowned her due to false allegations of being the town temptress. Men and boys alike fantasize and want her. The women hate her. In comes a young 12 year old boy named Renato Amoroso who develops an obsessive crush over Malena but guards her and holds vigil from afar. This ""crush"" is what propels Renato into becoming and maturing into a young man who begins to understand that there is much more to romance and life than just lustful sex. He watches and follows Malena secretly and witnesses the many transformations she goes through to survive in a town that has turned hostile against her simply because of her striking beauty ! All of this will culminate towards an unexpected ending which will leave a strong impression to stay with Renato for the rest of his life!Cinematography is...well, it's filmed in Italy, what more can I say except stunning panoramic views of the Italian coastline.Plenty of comedic and colorful characters in the beginning. The film starts off with much humor when the viewer is permitted to see into Renato's mind concerning fantasies of farce and romance. But things turn sinister as a town bent on hate begins to enclose on Malena... The film score by Ennio Morricone is extrememly effective, captures the time period and also is very likeable and memorable ! The best surround effects take place during a German air raid over the town. You can also hear great detail in the surrounds of the ocean waves crashing and wind rustling through trees;this transports the viewer to an Italian vacation. The only gripe is that this Miramax dvd version of Malena is missing about 12 to 17 minutes of scenes that were included in the Italian or European release.This was  due to more nudity involving Belluci's character and some scenes that raised eyebrows between more explicit sexual fantasies of Renato's.",5,La Bella Bellucci,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,2678,"['Titillating', 'tantalizing', 'tragic', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'adjectives', 'come', 'mind', 'genius', 'realize', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'one', 'most', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'international', 'beauties', 'current', 'cinema', 'Italian', 'version', 'beauty', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Belucci', 'play', 'recurring', 'roles', 'women', 'great', 'distress', 'abuse.She', 'so', 'convincingly', 'look', 'so', 'effortless', 'rare', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'much', 'facial', 'expressions', 'actions', 'really', 'saying', 'much', 'eyes', 'baby', 'Malena', 'telling', '27', 'year', 'old', 'widow', 'left', 'fend', 'small', 'Italian', 'village', 'downfall', 'husband', 'WW2.No', 'one', 'will', 'employ', 'women', 'sell', 'rotten', 'food', 'cruelty', 'severe', 'doses', 'Malena', 'father', 'disowned', 'due', 'false', 'allegations', 'being', 'town', 'temptress', 'Men', 'boys', 'alike', 'fantasize', 'want', 'women', 'hate', 'young', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Renato', 'Amoroso', 'who', 'obsessive', 'crush', 'Malena', 'guards', 'vigil', 'afar', 'crush', 'what', 'propels', 'Renato', 'becoming', 'maturing', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'understand', 'much', 'more', 'romance', 'life', 'just', 'lustful', 'sex', 'Malena', 'secretly', 'many', 'transformations', 'survive', 'town', 'turned', 'hostile', 'simply', 'striking', 'beauty', 'will', 'culminate', 'towards', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'strong', 'impression', 'stay', 'Renato', 'rest', 'life', 'Cinematography', 'well', 'filmed', 'Italy', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'stunning', 'panoramic', 'views', 'Italian', 'coastline.Plenty', 'comedic', 'colorful', 'characters', 'beginning', 'film', 'much', 'humor', 'when', 'viewer', 'permitted', 'see', 'Renato', 'mind', 'concerning', 'fantasies', 'farce', 'romance', 'things', 'turn', 'sinister', 'town', 'bent', 'hate', 'begins', 'enclose', 'Malena', 'film', 'score', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'extrememly', 'effective', 'time', 'period', 'also', 'very', 'likeable', 'memorable', 'best', 'surround', 'effects', 'take', 'place', 'German', 'air', 'raid', 'town', 'can', 'also', 'hear', 'great', 'detail', 'surrounds', 'ocean', 'crashing', 'wind', 'rustling', 'trees', 'viewer', 'Italian', 'vacation', 'only', 'gripe', 'Miramax', 'version', 'Malena', 'missing', 'about', '12', '17', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'were', 'included', 'Italian', 'European', 'release.This', 'was', 'due', 'more', 'nudity', 'involving', 'Belluci', 'character', 'scenes', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'more', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'Renato']",Malena
541188,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B00003CXXY,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 2]","It's been said that beauty is a curse. This saying is easy to understand, but how many people really get to witness how bad it can be unless it happens to them? Here's your chance to get a glimpse of said curse. Malena is a wonderful movie that, more or less, is about a young boy going through puberty, and happens to fall in love with a much older woman. You can't blame him- Monica Bellucci is gorgeous, a true head-turner. And when you have a flawless woman in a small town full of older women whose husbands ignore them the second she comes walking by, you've got a disaster waiting to happen.12 year old Renato has just bought his first bike on the day Italy enters the second World War. Upon taking it to show his friends, he gets a glimpse of her: Malena. Time practically comes to a standstill whenever she's around. Some men stop what they're doing as soon as they see her, others desperately try to win her over with freebies or flattery. She's the daughter of the school's Latin teacher and her husband has went off to war. All alone at home, countless men will stop at nothing to have her. Though he wants Malena just as badly as they do, Renato's passion for the woman is more pure than the others. He can see right through everyone else and wants to protect Malena from anyone taking advantage of her. How can he do it though? He's a small, thin boy who's trying to be a man. The kid tries his best though! For example, he wants to wear long pants like adult men instead of the shorts all the boys have to wear. What grown man didn't try that at some point when he was younger? When her husband is reported dead, the competition for Malena grows more fierce. Some men make up stories about being engaged to her, some offer her desirable goods (like sugar and bread) which are hard to come by with the country at war. While Malena's troubles grow, so do Renato's. He's driving his parents crazy whenever he's *ahem* alone in his room doing something that a squeaky bed gives away. School isn't going any better either. He's head over heels for a woman that doesn't even know his name, always spying on her in his free time. Unfortunately, what he's about to see is something he's not going to be able to help with.I don't know how he did it, but director Giuseppe Tornatore managed to make a movie, where puberty is a big part of the story, not over the top. There's never a moment where Renato's fantasies make you roll your eyes- all of what he says and does is very easy to relate with or understand. Even more impressive is taking a woman who is absolutely perfect in the looks department, and making her unaware of this. Malena keeps to herself for most of the first half of the movie, never using her looks to get anything. When she's accused of breaking up a marriage when a man is caught sneaking over to her home late at night, she doesn't have to give her lawyer Bambi eyes to get his help. Constantly gossiped about by the other women, Malena never actually does anything to get the bad reputation she has in the beginning of the movie. They just seem to hate her by default. The poor woman doesn't go out with other men or anything ""wild"". In fact, she spends a lot of her time taking care of her deaf father. As the movie goes on I felt more and more sorry for Malena. She's innocent, but when things get tough, a change needs to happen, whether you want it to or not.The war isn't glossed over either. There are a handful of scenes involving planes and military personnel that serve their own purposes. Malena is full of beautiful cinematography, and the shot of planes flying over the city is breathtaking. I haven't seen many movies where Italy is the main setting, yet Malena really puts you right there in Sicily. There are plenty of sequences where you can truly appreciate the city and landscape. The rocky area where Renato and his friends do a little ""measuring"" looks like a great place to relax. As for the film's soundtrack, the main theme is very catchy, and I find myself humming it all the time. The legendary Ennio Morricone handled it, and it's perfect just like most of his work.It's hard to talk about some of the funnier moments in the movie without completely ruining them, but there seems to be one major scene that upsets some people. Skip this paragraph if you want to avoid it, though it's not ruining any key plot points. There's one scene where Renato's father takes him to a brothel, realizing that his son needs to let out some of his feelings. After all, his mother thought he was possessed, and tried to get him exorcised! The boy's just 12 years old, and his dad takes him to a brothel?! Yes, it's a bad decision and we probably shouldn't be laughing when this scene happens (even the boss brings up that they'll either die in the bombing or get arrested after that visit), but how can you get so uppity over this?The one flaw with Malena that I'll point out is the US dvd/blu-ray release- it's still heavily edited. By now, if you haven't heard about the Korean dvd, see if you can find that instead to get the full movie. You can do a quick search for what they took out and see if it's worth the extra money or not. Personally, I think the movie's still great with the edits. It's not like they took out the scene I mentioned in the above paragraph, or anything -that- important. It's still silly of them to do it though. If you want a relatively warm movie about growing up, Malena is a great choice. This is one of those movies I like to watch every couple of months to perk me up when I'm not feeling that great.",5,If only puberty was this good for everyone...,1352332800,"11 8,

They took out much of the ""questionable"" content, which resulted in a film with no flow and ultimately lacking in sense. It's ridiculous how our country has gone to such such extreme censorship procedures.

The story is narrated by Renato, a young boy torn between adolescence and adulthood. We see Malena's life through his eyes and the eyes of the other men in the small village that lust over Malena who just so happens to be a a gorgeous, stunning girl that all men lust all over. Her husband is off on the battlefield fighting a war and she is left by herself. No money, no job. Nothing. She is surrounded by horny men who would do anything to get with her, this also includes the narrator Renato who is just now exploring sexuality and all he sees day and night is the breathtaking Malena.The gossip around the small village circles around Malena but Renato is blinded by love. (This reminds me of Last Exit To Brooklyn a bit too much). Renato defends Melena in any way he can, he also fantasizes about Malena quite often which shortly after turns into an obsession. He follows her day and night, he knows her probably better than she knows herself. He ditches school and his family only to watch her walk by, seeing her is an absolute heaven to Renato. Shortly after the story turns sour and we learn how jealous the women in the village really are, rumors start flying left and right about various lovers which some of them are unfortunately true but there is much more to it. Malena is an exotic beauty that turns the local village upside down and also the life of Renato.I guess this movie is one of the light-hearted dramas that is strikingly original and it will most likely be appreciated more by the European crowd than the American. I am simply saying this because certain people tend not to watch movies simply because they are subtitled. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of dramatic movies.

He expresses, out of all the characters in the film, the willingness to step outside his natural, cultural boundaries and grow past his traditional philosophy.  This film is not only about the life of Malena, but also about Renato's growth into an adult.  What events force Renato to grow into this new kind of thinking?2. Implications: The film shows the evolution of Europe, and the break from traditional values, not only through Renato but through the insanity of the war.  In what ways does the movie show a critical eye to the old world?3. Evolution: In what ways is the movie distinctly European, and yet more in detail, distinctly Italian?  Do you think the film is trying to make a general statement on the madness of war, or is it trying to make a visceral attack on the rigidity of Italian traditionalism?4. Realism: The story premise is interesting: imagine if you had a guardian angel in the form of a young boy, but you never knew he existed... do you think the set-up of the story was meant to describe an actual sequence of events with the boy, or is the movie playing a more important role with symbolism?5.

541194,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00003CXXY,Bobby Underwood,"[5, 7]","This wonderful film from Italy by ""Cinema Paradiso"" writer and director Gieseppe Tornatore is both hilarious and heartbreaking. What starts out as a coming of age obsession turns into a meditation on human cruelty, and poses many questions: Is it what people expect of us that makes us what we are? And if we change to be this, where do we belong then, and can we be accepted again in the life we choose to live?Giueseppe Sulfaro is terrific as Renato, a young boy in an Italian town during WWII who has just gotten a new bicycle. His biggest goal in life is to get a pair of long pants so he can dress like a man. But once he sees the lovely Malena, his life changes forever. His adolescent fantasies about the most beautiful girl in the town are hysterical. He puts himself into the American films he has seen in these moments. We can't stop laughing at his John Wayne inspired ""Stagecoach"" western fantasy; ""My, you have the biggest guns in the west, Renato!"" His raging hormones are treated in a funny and yet tasteful manner.His adolescent longing for the town beauty turns to something more as this film slowly shows Renato how this small Italian town feels about the lovely Malena. Men gawk and want to have her for themselves and the women hate her because of her dark beauty. They gossip to cheapen her. But Renato has been spying on her through a peephole and knows the truth. She is pure. She dances alone in her house with her husband's picture, faithful and waiting for his return from war.Renato loves the beautiful Malena and defends her virtue by playing nasty tricks on the ones who talk about her. When she apparently becomes a widow her life becomes much harder and the gossip turns more vicious as the entire town pushes her towards the loose woman they want her to be; the men so they can sleep with her, and the women so they can feel superior. Once a ""payment"" is forced upon her by the town attorney her path is sealed and the young Renato watches the girl he worships from afar become a prostitute, knowing she is still pure, and has no choices.Monica Bellucci is magnificent as Malena. She is ravishingly beautiful and quietly displays emotions underneath we can not see, an elegant dignity carried all through the film. Even as she is dragged into the streets and beaten by the women after American liberation from the Germans Bellucci's Malena maintains a rare dignity which separates her from the other women in the town. It is a raw emotional scene of a kind rarely if ever seen in American cinema.Don't let this truly wonderful film pass by just because you don't like subtitles. Monica Bellucci is very memorable as the breathtakingly beautiful Malena. Renato knows he will never forget Malena.

541197,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00003CXXY,Brian E. Erland,"[91, 100]","Note: Italian with English subtitles.This is an incredibly sad and poignant film about the despicable treatment levied by an insensitive community on a World War II wife (Monica Bellucci) left alone to fend for herself while her husband is away serving in the Italian Army. It's rumored that he has died in battle but no one knows for sure, not even Malena. It soon becomes assumed by all that she is now a widow and available.By far the most beautiful and sexually desirable woman in town, the entire community virtually comes to a standstill whenever Malena walks by. The men make little to no attempt to hide their lust as they undress her with their eyes, while the women of the community stare at her just as fiercely for being what they could never be.Men of influence and wealth are ready and willing to take advantage of the situation. Under the pretense of kindness and generosity they offer their services all the while seeking only to satisfy their carnal desires with her feminine charms. Refusing their sexual advances only makes matters worse for no matter what the truth may be she is unfairly branded a whore and a husband stealer.While she continues on with her daily routines she silently suffers through all the slander and abuse heaped on by the town. Only one young teenage boy seems to see the sad truth of the situation but he can only watch and quietly deal with his own lustful desires for Malena.Just as Malena is about to reach her breaking point the German Army occupies the town. Having been rejected for so long by her community she turns to the enemy for acceptance and comfort. This of course only serves to fan the flames of hatred towards her. When the soldiers are finally forced to retreat a final confrontation between Malena and the townspeople is inevitable.Monica Bellucci is stunning in the role of Malena. Her silent, long-suffering portrayal is heartbreaking. This is pure speculation on my part, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover she was picked for the part of Mary Magdalene in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion"" based on this performance.Don't buy the - Region 1 - release which has been horribly truncated into 92 minutes.

With 'Cinema Paradiso', Tornatore helped build the kingdom of the Weinstein Brothers also known as Miramax and it is only proper that he received from them the financial support to make this film in his homeland.  Many years have passed since the masterpiece, however with Malena, he shows that he hasn't skipped a beat.Tornatore definitely has an acute sense for beauty.  The casting is top notch.  The beauty of Monica Bellucci definitely complements the sweeping cinematography.  Every frame is breathtaking, the Italian seaside will never look any better.  Even if the movie fails to deliver anything else, the cinematography is worth your money.  I am not sure that it did not deserve the Academy Award it was nominated for in 2000.As in Cinema Paradiso, this film deals with a boy's coming of age.  His infatuation with the new village beauty, Malena, becomes the fuel of his libido.  He painfully observes how the widow is chastised by the whole village after she loses her husband in the war.  Powerless, he witnesses her agony and suffers along with her.As in Tornatore's previous cinematic efforts (Cinema Paradiso, the Starmaker), the social commentary is very apparent.  He contrasts the ugliness of a close-minded town that passes judgments a little too quickly with Malena's passive beauty.  He would even goes as far as associating it with the loser mentality.  This is no more evident than in three different but similar scenes: when the fascists , the Germans and subsequently the Americans come to town.  Each is greeted with so much fanfare that you have to wonder if this is anything but mockery.This is no Cinema Paradiso, and in a way I am glad it isn't.  With Malena, Tornatore proves that he still has a few good movies left in him.  One wonders how does a director come back after Cinema Paradiso, however, this should be enough to cast your doubts away.",5,Beauty and the beast,1005609600,"11 13, 2001",2001,2009,"['unsuccessful', 'foray', 'Hollywood', 'Tornatore', 'back', 'roots', 'what', 'best', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', ""'Cinema"", 'Paradiso', 'Tornatore', 'helped', 'build', 'kingdom', 'Weinstein', 'Brothers', 'also', 'known', 'Miramax', 'only', 'proper', 'received', 'financial', 'support', 'make', 'film', 'homeland', 'Many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'masterpiece', 'however', 'Malena', ""n't"", 'skipped', 'beat.Tornatore', 'definitely', 'acute', 'sense', 'beauty', 'casting', 'top', 'notch', 'beauty', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'definitely', 'sweeping', 'cinematography', 'frame', 'breathtaking', 'Italian', 'seaside', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'better', 'Even', 'movie', 'deliver', 'anything', 'else', 'cinematography', 'money', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'nominated', '2000.As', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'film', 'boy', 'coming', 'age', 'infatuation', 'new', 'village', 'beauty', 'Malena', 'fuel', 'libido', 'painfully', 'how', 'widow', 'chastised', 'whole', 'village', 'husband', 'war', 'Powerless', 'agony', 'suffers', 'her.As', 'Tornatore', 'previous', 'cinematic', 'efforts', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Starmaker', 'social', 'commentary', 'very', 'apparent', 'ugliness', 'close-minded', 'town', 'judgments', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'Malena', 'passive', 'beauty', 'would', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'associating', 'loser', 'mentality', 'more', 'evident', 'three', 'different', 'similar', 'scenes', 'when', 'fascists', 'Germans', 'subsequently', 'Americans', 'come', 'town', 'greeted', 'so', 'much', 'fanfare', 'have', 'wonder', 'anything', 'mockery.This', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'way', 'am', 'glad', ""n't"", 'Malena', 'Tornatore', 'still', 'few', 'good', 'movies', 'left', 'One', 'how', 'director', 'come', 'back', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'cast', 'doubts', 'away']",Malena

Everyday fascism and everyday war, the latter relatively far away, but eventually closing in. German takeover, increasing bombardments and refugees, then American liberation of all of Sicily. At stages a situation not unlike Fellini's Amarcord (1973), especially as events are seen by adolescents.Key ""objet du d&eacute;sir"" (Bu&ntilde;uel is never far) is a beautiful young woman of the local bourgeoisie, Mal&egrave;na Scordia (Monica Bellucci), who loses her husband early in the war, and for a long time resists all offers by locals and military males keen on her services. Her group of adolescent admirers, above all Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro), idolise her as an unapproachable beauty, and follow her daily moves on their bicycles.Giuseppe Tornatore's best known screen work - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso - was released in 1988, a film narrating the life of a successful film director who has returned to his native town in Sicily for the funeral of his mentor. This obtained worldwide success and won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Subsequently, Tornatore released several other films cementing his place in film history. His main musical aide regularly has been Ennio Morricone,After an earlier unsubstantiated accusation is rejected by the judge, towards the end of the war, poverty eventually forces Mal&egrave;na to become a prostitute. When their army comes to town, Mal&egrave;na serves Germans as well. As the war ends, the women gather and publicly beat and humiliate Mal&egrave;na, who leaves for Messina. A few days later, Mal&egrave;na's husband returns, to the shock of all the residents. He goes to Messina to find her; a year later, they return.The villagers, especially the women, are astonished at her courage, and begin to respect ""Signora Scordia"". Though still beautiful, they think of her as no threat, claiming that she has wrinkles near her eyes and has put on some weight. The last scene, near the beach, is very Fellini-esque: Renato helps Mal&egrave;na pick up some oranges that had dropped from her shopping bag. Afterwards he wishes her ""Buona fortuna, Signora Mal&egrave;na "" and rides off on his bicycle.73us-16/5/2012",3,A Sicilian situation,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2332,"['73us', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'na', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', '2000', '109', 'Italian', 'romantic', 'drama', 'richly', 'prized', 'playing', 'coastal', 'town', 'Palermo', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Everyday', 'fascism', 'everyday', 'war', 'latter', 'relatively', 'far', 'away', 'eventually', 'closing', 'German', 'takeover', 'increasing', 'bombardments', 'refugees', 'then', 'American', 'liberation', 'Sicily', 'situation', 'not', 'Fellini', 'Amarcord', '1973', 'especially', 'events', 'are', 'seen', 'adolescents.Key', 'objet', 'du', 'd', 'eacute', 'sir', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'never', 'far', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'local', 'bourgeoisie', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'Scordia', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'who', 'husband', 'early', 'war', 'long', 'time', 'offers', 'locals', 'military', 'males', 'keen', 'services', 'group', 'adolescent', 'admirers', 'Renato', 'Giuseppe', 'Sulfaro', 'idolise', 'unapproachable', 'beauty', 'follow', 'daily', 'moves', 'bicycles.Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'best', 'known', 'screen', 'work', 'Nuovo', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'was', 'released', '1988', 'film', 'narrating', 'life', 'successful', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'returned', 'native', 'town', 'Sicily', 'funeral', 'mentor', 'obtained', 'worldwide', 'success', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Subsequently', 'Tornatore', 'released', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'cementing', 'place', 'film', 'history', 'main', 'musical', 'aide', 'regularly', 'been', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'earlier', 'unsubstantiated', 'accusation', 'rejected', 'judge', 'end', 'war', 'poverty', 'eventually', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'become', 'prostitute', 'When', 'army', 'town', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'serves', 'Germans', 'as', 'well', 'war', 'women', 'gather', 'publicly', 'beat', 'humiliate', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'who', 'Messina', 'A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'husband', 'returns', 'shock', 'residents', 'Messina', 'find', 'year', 'later', 'return.The', 'villagers', 'especially', 'women', 'are', 'astonished', 'courage', 'begin', 'respect', 'Signora', 'Scordia', 'Though', 'still', 'think', 'threat', 'claiming', 'wrinkles', 'eyes', 'put', 'weight', 'last', 'scene', 'beach', 'very', 'Fellini-esque', 'Renato', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'pick', 'up', 'oranges', 'had', 'dropped', 'shopping', 'bag', 'Afterwards', 'Buona', 'fortuna', 'Signora', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'off', 'bicycle.73us-16/5/2012']",Malena

541210,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B00003CXXY,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[10, 17]","I rented this movie mainly because I loved the director's previous film, ""Cinema Paradiso.""  Unfortunately ""Malena"" is, despite the gorgeous Monica Belluci and all that beautiful cinematography (the only department in which it surpasses ""Cinema Paradiso""), disappointing.This film's main problem is its repetitiveness: we are treated to, over and over, shots of Belucci walking through the city in some stunningly tight, sexy-yet-elegant dress and men of all ages salivating at her, understandably.  Then all the fantasy scenes of what goes on inside a pubescent boy's imagination when confronted with a woman of Belluci's sexual majesty.  Then all the lustful gossip of the men, and the envious bile of the women.  Then more shots of the 13 (?) year old protagonist tailing Belucci, spying on her at home, defending her by playing nasty little tricks on townspeople who are badmouthing her...  Cute stuff once or twice, but after about the eighth time you just want to hit the fast forward button!This film simply doesn't build smoothly, but rather just piles on more and more of the same; plotwise, the few turning points in the film come much too late, too slowly, few and far in between, and are more anti-climactic than anything.One nice thing about this film, though, is that the director at least avoids the more typical Hollywood-style outcomes in favor of the less expected, probably less enjoyable, but definitely more realistic/authentic ones.  The love- and lust-struck protagonist never gets anywhere near his object of desire, and nobody rides off into the happily ever after.All in all, this one's a bit of a dud.

I have a relative who doesn't usually like foreign films but had to admit this is a great one.  Its funny, its sad and it has a message.  The story of the beautiful Malena is one that is heart-breaking.  Malena is a beautiful woman whose husband is fighting in World War II and is left alone in this town.  She is subjected to constant rumours and harassment by the men and women in their village.Renato is the young boy obsessed with her.  He is also the only person who knows the truth about her and knows she doesn't do the things people say she does.  Malena wasn't dating everyone, she was sewing for people into the night, carrying her husband's picture and dancing to their favorite music.  The sad thing is that Malena has to become what everyone had labeled her once word got back that her husband was killed.  Women refused to sell her food and she had to sleep with men to survive.  There is a scene towards the end that really upset me.  This movie shows how rotten both the men and the women were to her.  Malena shows how dangerous lies and assumptions are to a person's standing in their community and their own self-respect.Malena is a very funny movie at times.  There are scenes with Renato that made me laugh out loud.  However, its a film that goes deeper than many out there.  I would have to say this has become one of my all-time favorites.

O'Neill,"[2, 2]","A city as though under the spell of Circe, every man grunting and hoggish, every woman a shrieking harridan, the boys a pack of feral dogs, their victim a young woman apparently entirely virtuous, whom her soldier husband has had to leave behind in a place not her own,and who is treated as foul because unbearably fair--this is the darkest movie I have ever seen, possibly excepting The Lord of the Flies.  The atmosphere is one of impending human sacrifice, the near-ending is in fact torture, short of the very flawed boy hero there is no trace of decency, or courage, or even honest ardor among the men toward this lovely, tragic creature.  That all this happens in a city of considerable elegance (it is most certainly not a village) and in a landscape with the austere magnificence of the Italian south only tightens the screw.It is a movie of genius, impeccably acted, superbly cast, beautifully shot, perfectly paced (and, yes, of course this, not the maimed American studio version, is the only version to buy).  Is it flawed genius?  Does Malena represent a loathing of humanity too deep to be sustained?  Or, even worse, the kind of thinking that here comes out of Yale that all small town people are necessarily crass brutes?  There is similarly comprehensive scorching in the stories and novels of Flannery O'Connor, but O'Connor is holding us up to God, and this does not seem to be the game here--the young hero would seem (it is done in gestures and glances)at the very end to learn high secular virtues of courage and thoughtfulness, but not, I think, Faith.  I know Italy very well (I do not know the south at all well) and such comprehensive vileness does not seem part of the landscape that I have ever known.  In this whole city, is there not one intelligent and gracious woman, one man of delicacy, even one young man of courageous gallantry?  They are usually around.  Does not one father reprimand his son for behaving as obscene lout to an unprotected woman?  It is all yet stranger given that Malena is no wretched serving girl.  By her clothes, bearing, and her husband's house, she is a lady.  In the wedding photograph she once dances with by herself, her husband appears to be a gentleman, and is likely serving as an officer.  All this seems to do nothing to protect her.This is, of course, a war movie.  There is a suggestion at the very end that the hysterical wickedness, or wicked hysteria, of the people is a part of the condition of war, or, more precisely, of war under Fascism (the city is so locked into hatred that even a returning, wounded, Italian officer is casually knocked down in the street by one of the porcine city fathers).  This may be.  A sort of storm does seem to pass with ending of the war, and gleams of light do creep out.There is much more to say, many scenes I would love to discuss.  But this would spoil a glorious movie for those who have not seen it, which I do not want to do.  Obtain this cut, and watch this movie.

It's like she has lived the life of Malena.One thing I can commend to this film is the way the storytelling was presented.  Although everything was told on the point of view of the boy, Renato, the story revolves around the troubles and mishaps of Malena.  I got really mad with the people who were envied and tried to destroy her.  Yet I was touched to what Renato did because in the end, he was the only person who helped Malena redeem herself, by reuniting the couple.Overall, the movie is more than five stars.

But only her most ardent admirer, young Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), will learn the untold true story of the mysterious and elusive Malena! In a captivating motion picture nominated for two Academy Awards, the eventual struggles and hardships that Malena must bravely endure serve to inspire Renato to new heights of compassion, courage, and independence!The cut version of the film offered on the US DVD is heavily edited, with virtually all of the cuts affecting the first story, and specifically Renato's dreams and fantasies (most of which show Malena seducing or making love to Renato). This shorter version of the film runs at approximately 92 minutes.This Uncut Korean version of the film runs at approximately 104 minutes. Initially, it was available on DVD only in Italy, courtesy of local distributors Medusa. Later on, Korean distributors Spectrum also released the uncut version of the film on DVD (their release is essentially an NTSC-encoded replica of the Italian PAL-encoded release). Unlike the Italian DVD release, the Korean DVD release is English-friendly. However, interestingly enough, the uncut version of the film can only be seen as intended by director Tornatore if one turns on the English subtitles on the disc. If one turns on the Korean subtitles, plenty of the footage that is missing from the Miramax cut release is optically censored.Note: In 2001, Malena won Best Cinematography Award (Lajos Koltai) at the David di Donatello Awards as well as Silver Ribbon Award for Best Score (Ennio Morricone) granted by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.",5,Excellente!,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,2102,"['NTSC/Region', '0', 'Uncut', 'version', 'not', 'issued', 'US', 'pressing', 'latest', 'triumph', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'writer', 'director', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Malena', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'boy', 'journey', 'manhood', 'chaos', 'intolerance', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'sleepy', 'Italian', 'village', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'town', 'Malena', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'subject', 'increasingly', 'malicious', 'gossip', 'lustful', 'townsmen', 'jealous', 'wives', 'only', 'most', 'ardent', 'admirer', 'young', 'Renato', 'Amoroso', 'Giuseppe', 'Sulfaro', 'will', 'learn', 'untold', 'true', 'story', 'mysterious', 'elusive', 'Malena', 'captivating', 'motion', 'picture', 'nominated', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'eventual', 'struggles', 'hardships', 'Malena', 'must', 'bravely', 'endure', 'serve', 'inspire', 'Renato', 'new', 'heights', 'compassion', 'courage', 'independence', 'cut', 'version', 'film', 'offered', 'US', 'DVD', 'heavily', 'edited', 'virtually', 'cuts', 'affecting', 'first', 'story', 'specifically', 'Renato', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'most', 'show', 'Malena', 'seducing', 'making', 'love', 'Renato', 'shorter', 'version', 'film', 'approximately', '92', 'minutes.This', 'Uncut', 'Korean', 'version', 'film', 'approximately', '104', 'minutes', 'Initially', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'only', 'Italy', 'courtesy', 'local', 'distributors', 'Medusa', 'Later', 'Korean', 'distributors', 'Spectrum', 'also', 'released', 'uncut', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'release', 'essentially', 'NTSC-encoded', 'replica', 'Italian', 'PAL-encoded', 'release', 'Italian', 'DVD', 'release', 'Korean', 'DVD', 'release', 'English-friendly', 'However', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'uncut', 'version', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'intended', 'director', 'Tornatore', 'one', 'English', 'subtitles', 'disc', 'one', 'Korean', 'subtitles', 'plenty', 'footage', 'missing', 'Miramax', 'cut', 'release', 'optically', 'censored.Note', '2001', 'Malena', 'won', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Award', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'David', 'di', 'Donatello', 'Awards', 'as', 'well', 'Silver', 'Ribbon', 'Award', 'Best', 'Score', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'granted', 'Italian', 'National', 'Syndicate', 'Film', 'Journalists']",Malena

Whatever  your opinions of that movie might be, Monica Bellucci just made for an awesomely beautiful and tragic Mary Magdalene.  Wow, I wondered, where did this actress come from?[...]  I found the Special Edition version easily enough just by searching the Internet.  The one I have appears to be a Korean make with options for Korean and English subtitles (and original Italian soundtrack).  It's NTSC widescreen and 103 minutes long.What a bummer this movie turned out to be!  It's basically about how evil the men (and women) of this little Italian village are to this poor woman left alone during WWII after her father is killed in an Allied bombing raid and her husband-soldier is declared to have been killed in action.  Left penniless and sexually abused by the men of the town, she turns to prostitution, and fraternizes with the German soldiers.  When the Allies win and run the Germans out, Malena is dragged out of the whorehouse into the street by the women of the town, who savagely beat her in public, strip her naked and cut her hair off.  This is a very hard to watch sequence that's not art or anything else, it's just very abusive stuff.  The beating just seems to go on forever, way too long, and this is most certainly one of the scenes that got cut short, deservedly so.I guess Monica Belluci made another movie along similar lines (""Irrevesible"") where there's this savage hard-to-watch rape scene.  Wow, to think that those oh-so-liberal and artsy European filmmakers persist in shooting such scenes and putting them into movies in the name of .... art?  NOT!Monica Belluci strangely enough looks very much like a mannequin in this movie, with her face constantly frozen into a forbidding mask.  She doesn't look good at all.  The movie is supposed to be done from the viewpoint of this young boy who is in his pubertal years.  Yes, it's true that boys of this age can be oversexed, but this boy and his pals are positively a bunch of creepy perverts, the way they stalk Malena and peek like voyeurs into her bedroom.Overall, there's not much that's enjoyable about this movie.

The story is about a young man (Giuseppe Sulfaro) who is only 12 and is starting to go through the usual changes a boy goes trough at that age and this is all happening while WW2 is going on. While he is going through this stage in his life he one day sees the town beauty, Malena Scordia, who's husband is from the town they live in and she is new in it. From the moment he sees her he becomes romantically obsessed with Malena, following her around town without her knowing it and spying on her. He witnesses the townspeople when they badmouth Malena behind her back and he retaliates by doing all sorts of things which i won't spoil because it takes some of the fun out of them though they are at times a little gross. He is sort of like a guardian. When news of Malena's husband's death arrives in town the gossip about her being a whore just grows and eventually circumstances make her become the town whore. The direction is very beautiful and nostalgic. It evokes memories of old italian movies and of the beautiful italian female stars of those times like Sophia Loren and Gina Lobriggida. The cinematography here just makes Monica Belluci even more beautiful than she already is and it has a dreamy feel to it and it was nominated for the Academy Award. The music here is one of Ennio Morricone's best scores. It was nominated for the Academy Award also. It is funny at times and also very bittersweet. It helps enhance the romantic, comic, and melancholy tone of the movie. And the acting is also very good. Giuseppe Sulfaro is very easy to identify with and for many guys who went through the changes this will have extra resonance. He does not have a chunk full of dialogue so he communicates his feelings through his actions and his facial expressions. Monica Belluci has even less dialogue but she manages to communicate so much emotion through those sad eyes of hers. She expresses sadness and sexiness all at once. Though it would have helped if the audience got more involved with Malena's internal conflict. The writing is flawed, mostly because the characters could have been a little more involving and this does leave some unsatisfaction. But other than that this is a beautiful movie and i strongly recommend it. You will become a fan of Miss Belluci if you see this.

541230,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00003CXXY,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 6]","Malena is truly a great film. It works on so many levels. This foreign film is one of my favorites and it's also a great one. It's funny, sad and clearly states a message. The story of Malena is heart-breaking. Malena is a beautiful woman whose husband is fighting in World War II and is left alone in this town. She is subjected to constant rumors and harassment by the men and women in their village. This film starts of with the story of Renato Amoroso, a young adolescent boy whose heart and hormones are both racing out of control. The object of his attention is Malena.Male members of the viewing audience can only gawk at Monica's phenomenal charms with glazed eyes, and wonder where such a Siren was in their formative years. Female members are likely to inch away from their enraptured partners, and later exclaim vociferously that Mal&egrave;na was the victim of her own beauty in the face of society's blatant sexism and moral double standard. (Oh, and ask off-handedly, ""Is she prettier than I am?"" Don't go there, guys.) Both points of view have considerable merit, though the latter is more substantive, surely.The performances of the entire cast are all wonderful, especially those of Sulfaro, and Luciano Federico and Matilde Piana as Renato's long-suffering parents. Admittedly, Bellucci's speaking parts are minimal, but all she has to do is simply stroll along, stand still, sit down, walk upstairs, or smoke a cigarette, to get the point of her role across.I might argue that this wasn't meant to be a comedy at all, but a drama with humorous elements - though I'd have to admit that this position is probably a stretch. Certainly, at the end, a certain truth is manifest through Renato. A man will eventually get over his first sexual enthrallment, but it will always remain in his memory as a small jewel to be fondly remembered as he matures into the ways of the world and the opposite sex.Overall, an enjoyable movie with 2 great leads, good music score (Morricone), and stunning cinematography.",5,Truly one amazing film,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2019,"['Malena', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'foreign', 'film', 'one', 'favorites', 'also', 'great', 'one', 'funny', 'sad', 'clearly', 'message', 'story', 'Malena', 'heart-breaking', 'Malena', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'husband', 'fighting', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'left', 'alone', 'town', 'subjected', 'constant', 'rumors', 'harassment', 'men', 'women', 'village', 'film', 'story', 'Renato', 'Amoroso', 'young', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'heart', 'hormones', 'are', 'racing', 'control', 'object', 'attention', 'Malena.Male', 'members', 'viewing', 'audience', 'can', 'only', 'gawk', 'Monica', 'phenomenal', 'charms', 'glazed', 'eyes', 'wonder', 'where', 'Siren', 'was', 'formative', 'years', 'Female', 'members', 'are', 'likely', 'inch', 'away', 'enraptured', 'partners', 'later', 'exclaim', 'vociferously', 'Mal', 'egrave', 'was', 'victim', 'own', 'beauty', 'face', 'society', 'blatant', 'sexism', 'moral', 'double', 'standard', 'Oh', 'ask', 'off-handedly', 'prettier', 'am', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'guys', 'points', 'view', 'have', 'considerable', 'merit', 'latter', 'more', 'substantive', 'surely.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Sulfaro', 'Luciano', 'Federico', 'Matilde', 'Piana', 'Renato', 'long-suffering', 'parents', 'Admittedly', 'Bellucci', 'speaking', 'parts', 'are', 'minimal', 'do', 'simply', 'stroll', 'along', 'stand', 'still', 'sit', 'down', 'walk', 'upstairs', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'get', 'point', 'role', 'across.I', 'might', 'argue', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'humorous', 'elements', ""'d"", 'have', 'admit', 'position', 'probably', 'stretch', 'Certainly', 'end', 'certain', 'truth', 'manifest', 'Renato', 'man', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'first', 'sexual', 'enthrallment', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'memory', 'small', 'jewel', 'be', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'ways', 'world', 'opposite', 'sex.Overall', 'enjoyable', 'movie', '2', 'great', 'leads', 'good', 'music', 'score', 'Morricone', 'stunning', 'cinematography']",Malena

The kid is so fascinated by the woman that he becomes a peeping tom, but in doing so becomes her apologist when she gets a bad reputation.There are some funny political comments in that his father has no trouble comically beating him around a little, but his father is also an ardent anti-fascist.  An equivalent American film would have the beating father a nazi sympathizer.  The movie changes gears from comedy to drama and it does so as the war gets nearer to Italy, but it never seems false.

She's married to a local fellow, but he's off serving in Mussolini's army of conquest. Every day, as she languorously strolls through town, she attracts the admiring stare of every male, young or old, within eyesight radius. Among them is Renato, played by Giuseppe Sulfaro, who has only recently entered that hormonally tumultuous condition that we call Teenager. At first sight of MAL&Egrave;NA, Renato is in Love. Well, let's not put too fine a point on it ... Lust, actually. (Of course, all the local womenfolk look daggers at the young lady. And, aren't all our menfolk Pigs?)Early on in the film, it's reported that Mal&egrave;na's husband has perished. From then on, Renato's interest in the girl becomes obsessive, but, at the same time, sweetly protective, as she struggles to live among the community. Rendered newly single by the circumstances of war, the men now wink and think her easily available, and the womenfolk think Tramp. Of course, Renato never actually talks to the object of his desire - he hasn't the nerve. The closest he comes to any sort of contact - outside of his feverishly erotic dreams, naturally - is the day she tells him to get out of her way as he blocks some steps she's descending. The storyline, and Mal&egrave;na's fate, culminates in the German occupation of the town, and its subsequent liberation by the Allies. By that time, Mal&egrave;na's position among the citizenry has been drastically transformed.Male members of the viewing audience can only gawk at Monica's phenomenal charms with glazed eyes, and wonder where such a Siren was in their formative years. Female members are likely to inch away from their enraptured partners, and later exclaim vociferously that Mal&egrave;na was the victim of her own beauty in the face of society's blatant sexism and moral double standard.

Amazon has an unfortunate policy of transferring reviews from one edition to another, even when they are not at all relevant.2) This MedusaVideo release is the real thing, with no cuts at all. Medusa was the film's original production company, and its original distributor. This is not an Asian knock-off, and it is not the hatchet job put out by Miramax/Disney which chopped out roughly 17 minutes from the film. Apparently most Asian versions claiming to be ""uncut"" in fact have brief shots omitted, due to local laws and taboos.3) This DVD is a PAL Region 2. Some US players will play PAL encoding just as easily as the US standard NTSC encoding, but not all will. However, you will definitely need an all-region player to accept a Region 2 disc; otherwise your player will simply give you an error message, and won't even attempt to play the movie. The US standard is Region 1.4) The soundtrack on this edition is in Italian only, with NO option for English. The movie does have subtitles, but again the subtitles are in Italian only, with NO option for English or any other language. So you will need to be able to make out either spoken or written Italian in order to follow the movie.5) Medusa has released three different editions of Malena:--a single disc of the movie alone;--a two-disc package including the movie by itself, and a second disc filled with interesting extras or supplements, again in Italian only; and--a three-disc package of these same two DVDs, plus an audio CD of Ennio Morricone's soundtrack, which is also available separately asMalena(ASIN:B00005AV1Z).All three of these releases are priced differently, whether or not they are shown as such in this listing. If you order this original uncut MedusaVideo version from an Amazon Marketplace seller, be certain you understand which of these three editions is being offered, and at what price. You will need to contact the seller to verify this information before ordering.6) You may notice an apparent discrepancy in the movie's runtime - IMDb gives the NTSC runtime as 109 minutes, whereas the PAL runtime on this disc is 105 minutes. Be assured that nothing has been cut; PAL simply runs imperceptibly faster than NTSC.7) At the time of this writing, Amazon's listing contains a couple of confusing errors which may have been corrected by the time you see this review. The movie is actually Unrated (UR), for mature audiences only; and the director is, of course, Giuseppe Tornatore.8) And Monica Bellucci has *never* been lovelier than here, as Malena.",5,"The *real* MALENA, completely UNCUT",1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,2755,"[""'ve"", 'made', 'way', 'rather', 'obscure', 'listing', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'of:1', 'review', '*ONLY*', 'medusavideo', 'malena', 'Dvd', 'Italian', 'Import', 'ASIN', 'B000YEDM98', 'version', 'Malena', 'Amazon', 'unfortunate', 'policy', 'transferring', 'reviews', 'one', 'edition', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'relevant.2', 'MedusaVideo', 'release', 'real', 'thing', 'cuts', 'Medusa', 'was', 'film', 'original', 'production', 'company', 'original', 'distributor', 'not', 'Asian', 'knock-off', 'not', 'hatchet', 'job', 'put', 'out', 'Miramax/Disney', 'chopped', 'out', 'roughly', '17', 'minutes', 'film', 'Apparently', 'most', 'Asian', 'versions', 'claiming', 'be', 'uncut', 'fact', 'have', 'brief', 'shots', 'omitted', 'due', 'local', 'laws', 'taboos.3', 'DVD', 'PAL', 'Region', '2', 'US', 'players', 'will', 'play', 'PAL', 'encoding', 'just', 'as', 'easily', 'US', 'standard', 'NTSC', 'encoding', 'not', 'will', 'However', 'will', 'definitely', 'need', 'all-region', 'player', 'accept', 'Region', '2', 'disc', 'otherwise', 'player', 'will', 'simply', 'give', 'error', 'message', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'play', 'movie', 'US', 'standard', 'Region', '1.4', 'soundtrack', 'edition', 'Italian', 'only', 'option', 'English', 'movie', 'have', 'subtitles', 'again', 'subtitles', 'are', 'Italian', 'only', 'option', 'English', 'other', 'language', 'will', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'out', 'spoken', 'written', 'Italian', 'order', 'follow', 'movie.5', 'Medusa', 'released', 'three', 'different', 'editions', 'Malena', 'single', 'disc', 'movie', 'alone', 'two-disc', 'package', 'including', 'movie', 'second', 'disc', 'filled', 'interesting', 'extras', 'supplements', 'again', 'Italian', 'only', 'three-disc', 'package', 'same', 'two', 'DVDs', 'audio', 'CD', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'available', 'separately', 'asMalena', 'ASIN', 'B00005AV1Z', '.All', 'three', 'releases', 'are', 'priced', 'differently', 'not', 'are', 'shown', 'such', 'listing', 'order', 'original', 'uncut', 'MedusaVideo', 'version', 'Amazon', 'Marketplace', 'seller', 'be', 'certain', 'understand', 'three', 'editions', 'being', 'offered', 'what', 'price', 'will', 'need', 'contact', 'seller', 'verify', 'information', 'ordering.6', 'may', 'notice', 'apparent', 'discrepancy', 'movie', 'runtime', 'IMDb', 'NTSC', 'runtime', '109', 'minutes', 'PAL', 'runtime', 'disc', '105', 'minutes', 'Be', 'assured', 'nothing', 'been', 'cut', 'PAL', 'simply', 'imperceptibly', 'faster', 'NTSC.7', 'time', 'writing', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'couple', 'confusing', 'errors', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'time', 'see', 'review', 'movie', 'actually', 'Unrated', 'UR', 'mature', 'audiences', 'only', 'director', 'course', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore.8', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', '*never*', 'been', 'lovelier', 'here', 'Malena']",Malena

Director and writer Giuseppe Tornatore won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1988 for ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso.""  This film follows a young boy Renato through the war.  While wars and rumors of wars swirl around the story, Renato is firmly focused on what most boys of his age would be: girls.  Giuseppe Sulfaro in his first and only film (to date) plays the boy with puppy dog eyes and a racing bicycle.  Monica Bellucci who was inThe Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition)andThe Matrix Revolutions (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)as well asThe Brothers Grimm [Blu-ray] is stunningly beautiful.  As an actress, she's not asked to do much other than look beautiful.  Renato's father Luciano Federico is hysterically funny as his interface with the boy gives the family relationship reality that seems juxtaposed to the horrors of war about to be unleashed.  The brutal scene where the women of the village assault Malena is chilling.  Malena's husband Nino returns home from the war after having been reported dead and tries to track down his wife.  When they return to the village, Malena shops in the market and tries to mend fences with the same women who were so incredibly mean to her.  Lajos Koltai was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography.  Ennio Morricone was nominated for an Oscar for Best Score.

I won't bore you with the story, as you can read that in numerous other reviews. It's an impressive film debut by Giuseppe Sulfaro, who gives a mature performance as the boy who is secretly in love with Malena. Monica Bellucci is also good although for a lot of the film she doesn't actually say that much, the part often requiring her to simply walk past lots of leering boys/men. The expression on her face alone often speaks volumes though. There is one scene which was no doubt demanding for Monica, and is quite hard to watch, and if you haven't yet seen Malena, you'll know exactly what scene I mean when you get to it. There are also several comedy moments in the film, one of my favourites being when Renato (the boy) is found asleep by his dad wearing a pair of knickers on his head!. Another is when Renato's mum thinks her son is possessed by the devil, and the dad points out ... Also worth mentioning is the cinematography, which is absolutely brilliant. Something I would of liked to have seen in the film (and I'm not necessarily saying it would of made it better), is Malena and the boy developing some kind of friendship and repsect for each other. Though the boy clearly looks out for her, she never knows this, and they don't even speak to each other until the very end of the movie.Overall then, a reasonably enjoyable movie with 2 good lead performances (particularly the boy), a good music score (Morricone), some often funny moments, and stunning cinematography.

I actually cried both times that I've seen the film. My husband was a little surprised that it affected me so much.The actress that plays Malena is indeed the epitome of what I would think a beautiful Italian woman would be and what the rest of the world romanticizes about. Actually, the actress that portrays her is almost a tad bit too mature, sophisticated, and pretty for the role. It's hard to believe that she comes from a village and has no friends. Well, then again, maybe she is perfect for the role. Malena looks do indeed spark lust in the men and envy, jealousy, and rage in the women of the town. Because she's an outsider (not from the town) and has no friends or family ties there, the people don't know her and are not kind to her. Her exceptional good looks don't help her at all.It seems that Malena is shy. I noticed that while watching the movie, that she never says much and that when she walks out in public, she seems to be aware that people get quiet and stare at her as she is walking by. I think she is aware of the attention that she generates and of the unkind comments, but she does not know how to deal with it. She does not seem to enjoy the attention from the men. Some women revel in it but I get the feeling that she doesn't at all. So Malena is shy and modest and I think that the character is really just wishing that someone would give her a break. Some women in the world know that they are attractive to men and use that as a way to get what they want. Not Malena...at least not in the beginning. The ironic thing here is that Malena actually becomes a prostitute (the very thing that she wasn't but was accused of being by nearly everyone in town). Let's face it; the girl needs to eat to live.The women of the town are jealous of Malena because of her looks and because they know their men desire her. If Malena had been the town tramp to begin with, all of the men would have had their fill of her and lost interest eventually. Because no one in town really seems to know her at all, that adds to her mystic and appeal. Malena was thought to be a widow early on in the film because her husband was thought to have died in the war. He later reappears in the film. I think that during the time that she was thought to be a widow, the townspeople could not believe that such a beautiful woman didn't have some lovers on the side. Of course Malena was virtually all alone and had no one to protect her.Malena sees that her circumstances will not improve and she decides to profit from the one thing she has left: her beauty.",5,The girl can't help it!,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,2696,"['movie', 'was', 'times', 'very', 'painful', 'watch', 'movie', 'close', 'home', 'know', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'unjustly', 'cruel', 'actually', 'cried', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'husband', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'affected', 'much.The', 'actress', 'Malena', 'indeed', 'epitome', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'rest', 'world', 'Actually', 'actress', 'almost', 'tad', 'bit', 'too', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'pretty', 'role', 'hard', 'believe', 'village', 'friends', 'Well', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'perfect', 'role', 'Malena', 'do', 'indeed', 'spark', 'lust', 'men', 'envy', 'jealousy', 'rage', 'women', 'town', 'outsider', 'not', 'town', 'friends', 'family', 'ties', 'there', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'not', 'kind', 'exceptional', 'good', 'looks', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'all.It', 'Malena', 'shy', 'noticed', 'watching', 'movie', 'never', 'much', 'when', 'walks', 'out', 'public', 'be', 'aware', 'people', 'get', 'quiet', 'stare', 'walking', 'think', 'aware', 'attention', 'unkind', 'comments', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'not', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'attention', 'men', 'women', 'revel', 'get', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'So', 'Malena', 'shy', 'modest', 'think', 'character', 'really', 'just', 'wishing', 'someone', 'would', 'give', 'break', 'women', 'world', 'know', 'are', 'attractive', 'men', 'use', 'way', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'Not', 'Malena', 'least', 'not', 'beginning', 'ironic', 'thing', 'here', 'Malena', 'actually', 'prostitute', 'very', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'accused', 'being', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'town', 'Let', 'face', 'girl', 'eat', 'live.The', 'women', 'town', 'are', 'jealous', 'Malena', 'looks', 'know', 'men', 'desire', 'Malena', 'had', 'been', 'town', 'tramp', 'begin', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'fill', 'lost', 'interest', 'eventually', 'one', 'town', 'really', 'know', 'mystic', 'appeal', 'Malena', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'widow', 'early', 'film', 'husband', 'was', 'thought', 'have', 'died', 'war', 'later', 'film', 'think', 'time', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'widow', 'townspeople', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lovers', 'side', 'course', 'Malena', 'was', 'virtually', 'alone', 'had', 'one', 'protect', 'her.Malena', 'sees', 'circumstances', 'will', 'not', 'improve', 'profit', 'one', 'thing', 'left', 'beauty']",Malena

I'll just say that this is a film that stands out from the rest of the tripe being made today thanks to it's high level of filmmaking.A lot is explored in this film, and all is explored with feeling. Set in a small Sicilian Village during WW2, this film goes into social opinion, sexual awakening, and poverty. There is much heart warming humor, as there is down right heart wrenching moments that can bring one to tears.

It also can't hurt that the film is exceptionally shot. The cinematography is great.The acting is also good. Giuseppe Sulfaro (playing the young teenage boy Renato in the film) is awesome. His soulful expressions and senstive performance does nothing but upscale the movie. The drop everything and watch beautiful Monica Bellucci (Malena) is wonderful.She barely utters a sound throughout the coarse of the film, and yet her expressions speak volumes that a thousand words never could.Unfortunately, the film isn't absolutely perfect.It's great, but there are a few misses.

541253,A22PV91A5CNOGO,B00003CXXY,"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY""","[0, 0]","Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Malena"" (2000)is a moving, nicely put together portrait of small-town narrowmindedness. Set in Sicily during World War II, it follows the misfortunes faced by a beautiful young woman whose soldier husband is presumed dead. The lovely Monica Bellucci plays the silent, voluptuous Malena whose face and figure raise havoc in the minds (and bodies) of virtually every man in town. Among her ardent admirers is 12 year old Renato (well portrayed by Giuseppe Sulfaro), who spies on her by day and enthusiastically fantasizes about her by night. The lust of the local men and envy of the townswomen eventually lead to Malena's ostracism, and when her penniless situation forces her into prostitution the women take violent action against her. When Malena's husband unexpectedly surfaces, it is young Renato who helps put an end to her pitiful plight.Although the action takes place in a Sicilian coastal town, one can imagine similar circumstances occuring in many a small, insular community, in nearly every part of the world. Skillful actors (La Bellucci says little, but her performance is soulful) and effective cinematography create a realistic depiction of life in a southern Italian town of the 1940s. One gripe on the part of this viewer: the version of ""Malena"" released in the United States was cut to remove scenes of nudity, most notably a scene in which Renato has a ""vision"" of a (fully frontal) nude Malena.

It has no menu, so just press play!Narrated by a boy whose manhood had just started to sprout, the film revolves around the central figure Malena, who is a great beauty. Her asset turns out to be a curse as it only invites unwanted attention from men and jealousy from women.The thing is, Malena did not encourage male attention by dressing provocatively or flirting with them. She keeps to herself. Due to circumstances created by the town gossips, she is shunned by her father and had to work as a prostitute.What angers me most is the hypocrisy of this town and the sheer injustice of Malena's situation. The men have no self control,  some articulate their fantasies as if it was real, giving people the impression that Malena is eager to get it on. The women are just as bad. Instead of blaming their husbands for their lust, they drag Malena out and beat her savagely in full public view. She is forced to flee her village. Years later, she comes back with her husband (he supposedly died in the war). Since, Malena has put on weight and has a husband, the women do not see her as a threat any more. Hence, they treat Malena with respect and great courtesy. In my opinion, Malena should just spit on them.Malena makes an incisive social commentary. It's about people who become misfits/outcasts not by their own design but society's. In Malena's case, she can disfigure herself to solve the problem - a ridiculous option but leaving town is better. The film is beautifully shot, the director had a great flair for great scenes and scenery.This DVD is confirmed butchered as it had a 18 years rating.

541263,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00003CXXY,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","I have not seen the uncut version of this that film buffs seem so adamant about here, so this is a review of the shortened version.I did not like the way that the film started.  It seemed, like so many contemporary Italian films, to have a kind of reflexive felliniesque tone, with cheap surrealistic flourishes, absurdly grotesque images, and melodramatic exaggeration.  Unfortunately, though this works perfectly well for Fellini because it flows organically from his own imagination, when someone else uses it, it comes off as contrived, even silly.  So, this is the absurdist tone of the film in the beginning, when the boy is infatuated with a woman of phenomenal beauty.  It is more caricature than anything I could relate to, but perhaps that is personal.  (I have lived in Italy.  It is a lively, vibrant place, but it never appeared to be a living burlesque like it does in these stylized films.)At this point, as the boy is discovering his sexuality and idealized love, the film abruptly shifts in tone.  With her husband gone to war, Malena is left to fend for herself; the older women are jealous of her youth and cruelly seek to undermine her.  Believing that she is widowed, Malena is forced into prostitution and humiliation at her powerlessness.  The boy witnesses this with acute sensitivity, horrified yet unable to do much of anything to help.  This part of the film works better, exposing the boy to the natural cruelty and hypocrisy of the town's people as they mock her while contributing to her downfall.  It is brutal and ugly and entirely believable as she becomes an embodiment of the fallen woman.  Forced to trade sex for food, she falls in with the Nazis and upon liberation is brutally beaten.  Bellucci delivers an extremely sympathetic performance.  In the end, the boy provides crucial help to the redemption of this woman, in a way signaling that he has become a man.  It is beautiful and moving in my view and overcomes the shortcomings of the first part of the film.Recommended.",4,"powerful impact at the end, but a bit too stylized a l'Italiano",1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,2014,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'uncut', 'version', 'film', 'buffs', 'seem', 'so', 'adamant', 'here', 'review', 'shortened', 'version.I', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'started', 'seemed', 'so', 'many', 'contemporary', 'Italian', 'films', 'have', 'kind', 'reflexive', 'felliniesque', 'tone', 'cheap', 'surrealistic', 'flourishes', 'absurdly', 'grotesque', 'images', 'melodramatic', 'exaggeration', 'Unfortunately', 'perfectly', 'well', 'Fellini', 'organically', 'own', 'imagination', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'off', 'contrived', 'even', 'silly', 'So', 'absurdist', 'tone', 'film', 'beginning', 'when', 'boy', 'infatuated', 'woman', 'phenomenal', 'beauty', 'more', 'caricature', 'anything', 'could', 'relate', 'perhaps', 'personal', 'have', 'lived', 'Italy', 'lively', 'vibrant', 'place', 'never', 'appeared', 'be', 'living', 'burlesque', 'stylized', 'films', 'point', 'boy', 'discovering', 'sexuality', 'idealized', 'love', 'film', 'abruptly', 'shifts', 'tone', 'husband', 'gone', 'war', 'Malena', 'left', 'fend', 'older', 'women', 'are', 'jealous', 'youth', 'cruelly', 'seek', 'undermine', 'Believing', 'widowed', 'Malena', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'humiliation', 'powerlessness', 'boy', 'acute', 'sensitivity', 'horrified', 'yet', 'unable', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'help', 'part', 'film', 'better', 'exposing', 'boy', 'natural', 'cruelty', 'hypocrisy', 'town', 'people', 'mock', 'contributing', 'downfall', 'brutal', 'ugly', 'entirely', 'believable', 'embodiment', 'fallen', 'woman', 'Forced', 'trade', 'sex', 'food', 'Nazis', 'liberation', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'Bellucci', 'extremely', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'end', 'boy', 'crucial', 'help', 'redemption', 'woman', 'way', 'signaling', 'become', 'man', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'view', 'shortcomings', 'first', 'part', 'film.Recommended']",Malena

It is essentially three films in one, it contains the story of a woman who lost her husband to war, the coming of age of a young boy and also how Facism and war affected the Italian people.Alot of other reviewers have summed up the plot and made valid comments, so I will only speak of the horrid DVD presentation. Being a huge fan of both the film and Bellucci, I wanted the single best DVD version and I'm afraid to say that this one is far from it! Miramax claim to be an independant and artistly geared studio, yeah right, they have dramaticly censored MANY great scenes from this film. Anyone not as repressed as the suits down at Miramax HQ should look into purchasing the NTSC Korean 2-Disc release. It is the ONLY completely uncut (a few minutes short than the Italian DVD due to PAL to NTSC conversion) DVD with English subtitles. The Italian disc is uncut but doesn't contain English subtitles, so it would only be good for Italian Speakers. Believe me once you see just how much this DVD is missing (over 13 min shorter than Korean NTSC, 16 min shorter than Italian PAL) you will be glad you put in the extra effort to get a real Malena DVD.PS to the reviewer who thought that the beating of Malena scene was unrealistic or over exagerated for the film's sake, read a histroy book some time!

541267,A2JNK55VUDYZFY,B00003CXXY,Ruth,"[5, 11]","Although in reality, this is a 4 star movie, when you tear it apart-the script is average, and there are too many scenes with the title character (Malena) walking through the town, getting looked over by men and boys of all ages. But I still can't give this film four stars.Why?It's such a deeply affecting and touching story-for me.I mean, this movie really struck a chord with me.The acting is subtle, and superb.The cinematography is very pleasing to the eyes, and it combines comedic elements with events so harsh they drove me to tears. No really, I was just hysterical, I literally could not watch, it hurt so much(I'm not gonna tell you at what parts though).So, here's a quick layout of the plot-It's set in small Italian village in 1940's Italy.And all around, all the talk is of the beautiful Malena(Monica Bellucci).Women do nothing but gloss her over with nasty gossip, because, duh they're jealous-She's young,beautiful beyond all comprehension, and all their husbands worship her.And men see her as nothing more than a mere sex object.The whole town talks about how she has all these lovers and is a complete whore with zero moral conscience.In actuality, she's actually a faithful, down to earth woman who does nothing more than  take care of her elderly father, and sit at home, awaiting her husband's(who's off at war)return. A scene which shows Malena dancing to a record with her husbands picture in the privacy of her own home works very effectively, not to mention offers a glimpse into her private life, one which you seldom get to see.It's all about what Malena is on the surface.You get to tell for yourself what Malena is really like.Anyway, so the short and short of it, is that what every one says about Malena is total bull, and depite her awe-inspiring appearance, leads a very lonely life. Women let their jealousy eat them alive, and don't want anything to do with Malena, and men do want something to do with Malena, but that only something is sex.Throughout what appears to be a few years, Malena experiences tradgedy of all sorts-her father is killed in a local bombing,she gets word that her husband died too, women at the market refuse to sell her food at the market, resulting Malena become the very thing she was once so unjustly accused of.And not to give away too much,but this results in that very scene, which is both haunting, shocking, and heartbraking.I swear, it tore the s&%t out of me.if that scene doesn't do something to you,stop reading this review right now, and go get a check up at the doctor's to see if you have a heart.This results in Malena leaving the town, and, soon you have the ending, which is both heartbraking,fragile, and true to life.It wasn't something blown out of proportion, or sugary sweet, it was just perfect.Fresh from a sobfest, I cried once more , but this time because I was so touched.But,let it be said, that Malena is not the main character in the movie, she is rather the base of the movie, what holds everything together, she's the theme, not the character.The main character is Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro).A young adolescent boy who falls in young lust with Malena, her mystery+beauty.Malena soon becomes the object of his every desire-She's in every daydream, every single minute of his day, and he follows her everywhere she goes, including her own home.He is the only one who actually knows the truth about Malena, all that happened to her, and is the only one who is able to see through the web of lies created by the town folks.Giuseppe turned in his role with poignancy,innocence, and maturity.May it also be said, that Malena(Monica Bellucci) barely speaks throughout the whole film, maybe in what seems to be 1 or 2 short scenes, and even then she only says a few words.And must I say, Bellucci played her role off her perfectly.Her face and eyes, expressions,actions spoke volumes and emotions, that I don't think words would've been able to convey.Just by showing a quick shot of her eyes, I was able to see, and almost feel all the pain,lonliness, and fear inside her.She's a gem, at least in this film.She's subtle,powerful, and fearless.One thing I also loved about this movie, was how little things were so close to life.For example,most townspeople aren't very attractive, and that's because they're not meant to be.I hate it when there's a movie full of beautiful people, you know it's not like that in real life.I loved it how Renato's (Giuseppe Sulfaro's) light acne wasn't covered up.Most every boy I can think of his age has some pimples!I loved it how Malena, despite her awe inspiring beauty, looked like a real woman, and not a cookie-cutter barbie!!She had curves, you know what I mean??I just loved it how the director kept all of life's imperfections in full view and didn't gloss them over with Hollywood sheen.It makes for a more effective and realistic film.In conclusion, I'd like to say, that I don't know if my review was helpful or not, but that it's been a long time since I've seen a movie with such depth and poignancy, one that touched me so deeply.Malena is a vastly underrated, exceptional film which deserves to be seen around the world.",5,I'M FORCED TO GIVE IT 5

541268,A1AQCY5XY4525F,B00003CXXY,"R. van Tonder ""kiroyale""","[2, 3]","This is such an impressive movie. I saw Cinema Paradiso (by the same director as this movie) and I thought it was good, but this really seemed even better than that. I think the director Giuseppe, the crew and the person who wrote all the musical scores to the movie really deserve the success this movie made of them. The director for his ingenious storyline and very evocative technique of shooting a film in conjunction with the development of the musical highs and lows of the orchestral score. The music is oh so crucial, IMHO, for this movie to be executed in such wondrous, moving emotional quality. Without the music, I think half of the magical effect of this movie would have been lost. I can think of another movie which is directed with great reliance on the musical score - Three Colours Blue. But that one was much more reserved compared to this - that one was more about controlled emotions that were allowed to flow subtly. That was a French movie. Contrast it with Malena, an Italian movie, full of Italian emotionality and passion. For me, the Italian movie Malena deserved half a star more than Three Colours Blue because of this :)The story has great force and although doesn't seem very realistic (what sort of horrible Italian town is that? surely there must be 1 in a 1000 who would at least step up to Malena's aid, especially when she was trampled openly by womenfolk in the townsquare! I mean, its not as if this is like olden day Arab states where women convicted of adultery were publicly shamed to death and everybody would think its okay right?) Still, like I said, the music has a lot to do with it whenever you feel like you're gonna drop a tear or whenever your heart goes out to the poor woman (and her husband's) suffering. Imagine watching the whole movie without music. How boring would that be?Okay, the scenery was shot in such a way that captured the beauty (or rather, the exoticism to those of you who never grew up there) of a rather typical southern Italian town. I can think of a few more movies that shot and emphasised more beautiful views of other Italian countryside scenes... so that wouldn't be something that would figure largely in the impact of this movie on you, the viewer (unless you've never in your life seen any other footage of beautiful Italian countrysides on film or in real-life).The main actress is very gorgeous (and I think if anyone used her as an example of their idea of a &quot;perfect girlfriend/wife&quot;, they'd probably never get very far in their search for their perfect girl!) but that's not surprising considering she also used to be a Dolce and Gabbana model and is already a huge star back home. (Fame always makes someone even more glowingly beautiful than before.) Its easy to see why people would treat her like the real star of the movie - the whole movie was crafted around her; for her; the movie was made to make her get all the focus and picture her in her most beautiful shots possible. She never had to say a word, never had to display much emotion. In fact the main part of her job in the movie is to walk. Yes, like doing the catwalk, wearing clothes which look gorgeous on her gorgeous figure, in immaculate makeup and hair, and just... walk... walk ... walk all the time whenever the camera's on her. If she's not walking, she's doing some pretty posing (of course, the posing would be made to be like part of the script to mean something else, like dancing with her husband's picture, etc.) Even the director said in the &quot;Making of&quot; that when he first met Monica, he immediately thought she'd be perfect for such a movie he wanted to make. Its like seeing the most beautiful girl for the first time and wanting to make the most gorgeous sculpture out of her in rock and stone. I'm sorry but I have to say, Monica was only his muse. And nothing else... I can hardly see the talent in her.

This film, if anything, exhibits how boys are plowed down by burgeoning sexual desire at the beginning of their teen years and the onset of puberty.  Renato, a 12-year-old Italian villager spies Malena one day and is instantly smitten with an infatuation that carries him through some of Italy's darkest days--World War II.The setting of this film against the war is clever on the part of the writers because it gave them a point of comoparison:  though the Facist party is very active in Renato's seaside village, he scarcely seems to notice the military parades, decreasing food supplies, and Nazi flags that wave after the German occupation.  All of that rich detail is secondary to his feelings for the older, elusive Malena.  If that doesn't demonstrate the strength of a young man's desire, I don't know what will.Upon first seeing Malena, Renato begins masturbating and never stops.  But this movie doesn't fall into ""that"" category--it's better, more literary, more expertly written and directed.  There's a strong message about the dangers of gossip and rumors, and prejudices against single, beautiful women.  The exquisitely beautiful Malena is hated instantly by local women because of the passion she inflames in the men.  When news arrives that Malena's husband, Nino, has died in Mussolini's war, the viciousness only intensifies.  They refuse to sell her edible food, scandalize her name and ruin her chances to support herself in any respectable way.  She's forced to become what everyone pegged her for all along:  a prostititute.

We watch him grow from a boy - experiencing the first stirrings of sexual desire - to a young man with compassion and the courage to do what's right. The film does an effective, imaginative job of depicting his struggles as he goes through this transition.- The second theme involves the base behavior of the villagers - the dehumanizing acts driven by desire and jealousy.  They feel justified in their behavior, all the while bringing pain to everyone involved and damaging the lives of upright people.- The third theme revolves around the effects of WWII on the village. The movie invokes a thorough period feel, and is enjoyable to watch just to see the time and place.The development of the story is near-perfect.

541276,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXXY,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 9]","This beautiful film by Tornatore of ""Cinema Paradiso"" tells about Malena, an extremely beautiful woman whose husband went to war just after two weeks of their marriage, and Renato, a young boy, who appoints himself as protector of Malena without her knowing.  Everything is described from the viewpoint of Renato, who keeps on watching over her and the men coming around her, but the film's point is not what you might call ""guilty pleasure.""  It is a coming-of-age story of an Italian boy living at the time of WW2, and you can say that the film, though it belongs to definitely Monoca Bellucci, is about him and his growing pain as a youth.The story, based on a short, nostalgic story by Luciano Vincenzoni, is very simple, and director made it his own by casting Monica Bellucci, whose beauty is understandably compared to jewels, as Malena, who has to do what she had to do to survive as a widow in a local town in Sicily.  She gradually 'falls"" into a status of prostitute, in a brothel for Nati officers, and after the war, she is chased away from the town by womenfolks there by the most relentless way (this painful part, I am sure, can never be played by Hollywood counterparts except, perhaps, Ms Streep or Ms Lang).However, Renato, who passionately loves her, but feels his weak position as a mere boy without power, has been watching over her.  He loves her favorite music too, (a romantic song ""Ma L'Amore No""),; he even steals her underwear (which his father finds, oh no); but he knows all he can do is watch until the last moment he helps her redemption by giving up his dream of making her his own, by ... well, you must see this melodramatic development for yourself.There are three virtures in Malena, all of which are extremely beautiful and breathtaking.  One is, without doubt, Monica Bellucci with perfect costumes that stand up from 100 miles away.  Another is mesmerizing music of veteran composer Ennio Morricone, whose score here reminds us of the fact that he created may times such fantastic melodies in his long career.  The last one is its cinematography by Hungarian Lajos Koltai (""Conficence"" or ""Mephisto"") whose magical photography nicely captures the beauty of the Sicilan Island and, of course, Malena, unforgettable heroine of the film.Probably for non-Italian audience like me, the film looks uneven, like a rollercoaster of (too much) pathos and laughter, but without laughs and tears, what is the point of watching Italian movies?  And the last moments of the film, when Malena is reduced to ordinariness so that she is finally accepted by townspeople, looks unconvincing to me simply because even in plain clothes Bellucci is too beautiful.  But you will forget about these things before the beauty of the whole film.Finally, I end this review by quoting the message the director gave in the booklet sold in Japan.  This may help understand the film more, I hope:  ""I would like for people to walk away from the film and wonder -- is it possible that someone could have loved me that much, and I never knew it?""

These are the things that annoyed me about this movie:1) Malena. I watched this whole film thinking that there would be more to this character than her beauty and sex appeal. And I also hoped that somehow we would see the real Malena based upon a realistic and honest perspective from the young boy, or somebody. But instead, all the director gives us is an unrealistic and shallow image of Malena based upon all the wet dreams that the young boys have, and the blasphemous rumors from every woman in the town! Malena barely speaks in this movie. She's nothing more than just a sex symbol and a pretty face, that's all. We never get a chance to hear if she has something important to say, let alone do we actually see a personality or character in general. I never understood why, other than her beauty and the fact that most of the men and boys lust after her, does this whole town focus so much on her while they're at war! This overdone fantasy image of Malena overshadowed the film so much that it leaves the viewer sometimes wondering what's real and what's not, and at the end doesn't leave no sense of emotion on anything that's going on.2) As I said before, I never understood why nearly every single person in town cared so much about this one woman. It made the whole movie seem very unrealistic. Nobody even made an attempt to know Malena. At the end I didn't really understand why all of a sudden she's liked by everyone after nearly being torn up to the bone from being battered and beaten by the women on the street.3) As a whole, this movie never really seemed to make a real point. It takes place during WWII. There's a woman who's so beautiful that the whole town lusts after her and hates her at the same time. A boy is going through adolescence. This story is retold by the boy when he's a grown man. Why out of all the women that he went out with in his life is Malena the most important? What has she ever said or done to affect his life? How has she affected him to be the man he is today? We never see why. They never had a conversation with each other. He saw nothing more in her than just a fantasy, a wet dream, and then a woman who's wrongfully misunderstood. She never revealed her true character to him, and vice versa. So at the end, are we supposed to feel sorry for Malena? Is the movie supposed to make a statement about how to not judge a book by its cover? Were we supposed to get some newfound insight about the main character? I don't know about some other viewers, but I just didn't get it. I thought this story told by the young boy as a man was supposed to have some in depth purpose to reveal something important about his life or about Malena herself. But at the end, esp. since the fact that he had more of a visual than a vocal voice, and never really explains exactly WHY or WHAT he sees in Malena other than her beauty, it leaves a very disappointing ending. I think if this movie had put more depth and reality to the story in general, it would have made it a more emotional, moving, as well as entertaining experience. I think it's a shame that in 1 hour and 30 mins, I didn't get anything out of this. At the end I believe that this movie tried to do nothing more but showcase how so damn sexy and gorgeous the title character is when she's repeatedly walking down the street with a tight and sexy yet elegent dress on like some runway model.  And i think that's such a shame, because this movie could have had so much more depth and emotion beyond that. I expected something much better from the director who nearly changed my life and made me cry in his last film Cinema Paradiso.",1,"Beautifully Made Film, But Lacks Emotion and Depth",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,3926,"['watching', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'watch', 'film', 'wonderful', 'director', 'thought', 'same', 'emotion', 'engaging', 'storytelling', 'convincing', 'real', 'characters', 'saw', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'will', 'also', 'come', 'along', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'are', 'things', 'annoyed', 'movie:1', 'Malena', 'watched', 'whole', 'film', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'character', 'beauty', 'sex', 'appeal', 'also', 'hoped', 'somehow', 'would', 'see', 'real', 'Malena', 'based', 'realistic', 'honest', 'perspective', 'young', 'boy', 'somebody', 'instead', 'director', 'unrealistic', 'shallow', 'image', 'Malena', 'based', 'wet', 'dreams', 'young', 'boys', 'have', 'blasphemous', 'rumors', 'woman', 'town', 'Malena', 'barely', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'sex', 'symbol', 'pretty', 'face', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'hear', 'something', 'important', 'say', 'let', 'alone', 'do', 'actually', 'see', 'personality', 'character', 'general', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'other', 'beauty', 'fact', 'most', 'men', 'boys', 'lust', 'whole', 'town', 'focus', 'so', 'much', ""'re"", 'war', 'overdone', 'fantasy', 'image', 'Malena', 'overshadowed', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'viewer', 'sometimes', 'wondering', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'end', ""n't"", 'leave', 'sense', 'emotion', 'anything', 'going', 'on.2', 'said', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'nearly', 'single', 'person', 'town', 'cared', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'woman', 'made', 'whole', 'movie', 'seem', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'Nobody', 'even', 'made', 'attempt', 'know', 'Malena', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'sudden', 'liked', 'everyone', 'nearly', 'being', 'torn', 'up', 'bone', 'being', 'battered', 'beaten', 'women', 'street.3', 'whole', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'make', 'real', 'point', 'place', 'WWII', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'beautiful', 'whole', 'town', 'lusts', 'same', 'time', 'boy', 'going', 'adolescence', 'story', 'retold', 'boy', 'when', 'grown', 'man', 'Why', 'women', 'went', 'out', 'life', 'Malena', 'most', 'important', 'What', 'ever', 'said', 'done', 'affect', 'life', 'How', 'affected', 'be', 'man', 'today', 'never', 'see', 'why', 'never', 'had', 'conversation', 'other', 'saw', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'fantasy', 'wet', 'dream', 'then', 'woman', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'misunderstood', 'never', 'revealed', 'true', 'character', 'vice', 'versa', 'So', 'end', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Malena', 'movie', 'supposed', 'make', 'statement', 'how', 'not', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Were', 'supposed', 'get', 'newfound', 'insight', 'main', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'viewers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'thought', 'story', 'told', 'young', 'boy', 'man', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'depth', 'purpose', 'reveal', 'something', 'important', 'life', 'Malena', 'end', 'esp', 'fact', 'had', 'more', 'visual', 'vocal', 'voice', 'never', 'really', 'exactly', 'WHY', 'WHAT', 'Malena', 'other', 'beauty', 'very', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'put', 'more', 'depth', 'reality', 'story', 'general', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'emotional', 'moving', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'think', 'shame', '1', 'hour', '30', 'mins', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'end', 'believe', 'movie', 'tried', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'showcase', 'how', 'so', 'damn', 'sexy', 'gorgeous', 'title', 'character', 'when', 'repeatedly', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'tight', 'sexy', 'yet', 'elegent', 'dress', 'runway', 'model', 'i', 'think', 'shame', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'emotion', 'expected', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'director', 'who', 'nearly', 'changed', 'life', 'made', 'cry', 'last', 'film', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso']",Malena

A teenager Renato, alienated from his peers by his inadequacy of stature and indignity of wearing short pants, is filled with infatuation for Malena, a gorgeous young married woman whose beauty makes her the envy of the townspeople and the subject matter of every gossip. Malena's husband dies in the War and the gossip against her intensifies leading to her ostracism in the town. Met with isolation and starvation she falls a prey to prostitution, which almost seals her fate. Renato burning with desire for her, sees through her miseries and mistakes but only from a distance and in silence. Finally there is redemption when her husband, presumed dead, appears in town with a single arm to rescue her from indignity and misery.  This powerful story of Malena's woes is beautifully portrayed by Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro, in the background of Sicily during the World War II. Giuseppe Tornatore seems to be very good at weaving a tragic tale of beauty, desire and public envy. This movie provides a thought-provoking entertainment for those who like foreign films.",5,The Struggles of Puberty and the Trials of a Beauty,997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,1145,"['indeed', 'gripping', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'English', 'subtitles', 'A', 'teenager', 'Renato', 'alienated', 'peers', 'inadequacy', 'stature', 'indignity', 'wearing', 'short', 'pants', 'filled', 'infatuation', 'Malena', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'married', 'woman', 'beauty', 'envy', 'townspeople', 'subject', 'matter', 'gossip', 'Malena', 'husband', 'War', 'gossip', 'intensifies', 'leading', 'ostracism', 'town', 'Met', 'isolation', 'starvation', 'prey', 'prostitution', 'almost', 'fate', 'Renato', 'burning', 'desire', 'miseries', 'mistakes', 'only', 'distance', 'silence', 'Finally', 'redemption', 'when', 'husband', 'presumed', 'dead', 'town', 'single', 'arm', 'rescue', 'indignity', 'misery', 'powerful', 'story', 'Malena', 'woes', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Giuseppe', 'Sulfaro', 'background', 'Sicily', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'weaving', 'tragic', 'tale', 'beauty', 'desire', 'public', 'envy', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'entertainment', 'who', 'like', 'foreign', 'films']",Malena
