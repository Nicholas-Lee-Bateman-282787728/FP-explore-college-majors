760944,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0000A0WKV,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[23, 24]","It always seems to surprise me about Africa-American entertainment these days. Yet, there are just so many stereotypes written about woment in those roles, and so many of them not given credit in good quality roles, as much as those roles are strictly given to certain actresses like Halle Berry. Yet, with all of those, it does dismantle some light into good movies. Thankfully, BET and Arabesque entertainment, known for their well recieved books have definitely shined in on bringing good quality movies to the DVD market. That has happened with so many great movies from their novels including Playing With Fire, the well recieved After All with Holly Robinson Peete, and other acceptional flicks, including A Private Affair.In the 2000 film A Private Affair, featuring Vanessa Bell Calloway (Vanessa Bell at the time this film was catually released), the film reflects on a well recieved African-American writer, Nikita and how she learns to come back home after declared a victim to the I.R.S. Yet, she really feels sorry for herself at first, but also learns to rebuild her old life with her family, and an old flame from her past in the process. The movie fairs well, but loses a little of its momentum at the beginning, but gains it back during the middle of the movie, when Nikita decides to take a life-changing journey to Africa so she can recapture her essence and boldness as a author.For an actress like Vanessa Bell, who was a talk show panelist on the short-lived BET knockoff to The View ""Oh Drama!"", she has a lot of character in her, that should make her placed as the next Angela Bassett. A Private Affair is a wonderful movie. If you haven't seen it on BET, try renting this video and see if you like it. If you do, go ahead and buy it.",4,"You Can Leave Home, But Home Always Comes Back To You",1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,1758,"['always', 'surprise', 'Africa-American', 'entertainment', 'days', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'written', 'woment', 'roles', 'so', 'many', 'not', 'given', 'credit', 'good', 'quality', 'roles', 'as', 'much', 'roles', 'are', 'strictly', 'given', 'certain', 'actresses', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'dismantle', 'light', 'good', 'movies', 'Thankfully', 'BET', 'Arabesque', 'entertainment', 'known', 'well', 'recieved', 'books', 'have', 'definitely', 'shined', 'bringing', 'good', 'quality', 'movies', 'DVD', 'market', 'happened', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'novels', 'including', 'Playing', 'Fire', 'well', 'recieved', 'Holly', 'Robinson', 'Peete', 'other', 'acceptional', 'flicks', 'including', 'A', 'Private', 'Affair.In', '2000', 'film', 'A', 'Private', 'Affair', 'featuring', 'Vanessa', 'Bell', 'Calloway', 'Vanessa', 'Bell', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'catually', 'released', 'film', 'well', 'recieved', 'African-American', 'writer', 'Nikita', 'how', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'declared', 'victim', 'I.R.S', 'really', 'sorry', 'herself', 'first', 'also', 'rebuild', 'old', 'life', 'family', 'old', 'flame', 'past', 'process', 'movie', 'fairs', 'well', 'little', 'momentum', 'beginning', 'gains', 'back', 'middle', 'movie', 'when', 'Nikita', 'take', 'life-changing', 'journey', 'Africa', 'can', 'recapture', 'essence', 'boldness', 'author.For', 'actress', 'Vanessa', 'Bell', 'who', 'was', 'talk', 'show', 'panelist', 'short-lived', 'BET', 'knockoff', 'View', 'Oh', 'Drama', 'lot', 'character', 'should', 'make', 'placed', 'next', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'A', 'Private', 'Affair', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'BET', 'try', 'renting', 'video', 'see', 'like', 'do', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy']",N/A
