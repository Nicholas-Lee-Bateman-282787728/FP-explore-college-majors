I guess I'll start by saying that I think I get it: the filmmakers were trying to show how the self-centered actions of the protagonist wrought his own tragedy. But man, by the 60 minute mark, I was wondering if the protagonist wasn't suffering from severe head trauma (well, I guess he was since he gets hit on the back of the head by a shovel). But his poorly thought-out decisions start even before this unfortunate run-in with the tool.In fact, I can't help but wonder if the shovel is meant to not-so-subtly indicate that the protagonist is a tool himself. At every point where he could make a wise decision, he turns around and picks the one that will cause the most potential mayhem.SPOILERS..............................At the end of the movie, we have one of the characters berate the protagonist, &#34;All you had to do was get him to school!&#34; And we're meant to get the crushing weight of the tragedy that has befallen the protagonist.

1430373,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004W5MHIC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Ghost from the Machine (Matt Osterman, 2010)Last Tuesday (which as I write this was December 10) was one of those rare days when I didn't put a single foot wrong with my movie watching; everything that came off my Netflix queue ended up being pure gold. Of the bunch, my favorite was Ghost from the Machine, a low-budget thriller bursting with intelligence. It crossed my mind more than once that this is the movie Primer wanted to be and, in my estimation, never managed to become. So, needless to say, Universal is remaking it, rather than using the rights to push a film that deserves far, far wider recognition than it has so far gotten. Why do I get the distinct impression the remake, if it ever surfaces, will be dumbed down to the point where it'll be unrecognizable?Plot: Cody (See Jane Run's Sasha Andreev)'s parents died in a car accident, and since then, he has had two obsessions: taking care of his younger brother James (Aberration's Max Hauser) and building a machine that will allow him to communicate with his parents in the afterlife. Of course, doing such things requires parts, parts, and more parts, and a certain combination of same brings him to the attention of Tom (Factotum's Matthew Feeney), who builds pieces on the side that Cody has bought through the store Tom sells them to. Cody's machine, with all the bugs worked out of it, starts doing what it was made to do&#8212;with results that neither Cody nor Tom could have predicted.The great thing about Ghost from the Machine, like last year's similarly excellent Bellflower, is that this is a movie that Osterman could have easily taken in a generic sci-fi or horror direction, but instead, this reminded me a great deal of the wonderful little 2004 French film Les Revenants; Osterman instead focuses on the characters' reactions to what's going on around them rather than spending all the movie's time reveling in the wonderment of &#8220;hey, look what we did, and how many CGI effects we used to do it!&#8221;. This is not a movie for the stuff-blows-up crowd, which unfortunately limits its appeal to the broad market, but those who appreciate intelligence, empathy, and a great story will find this exactly the kind of thing they've been looking for all their lives without realizing it. ****",4,Spirits in the Material World.,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2280,"['Ghost', 'Machine', 'Matt', 'Osterman', '2010', 'Last', 'Tuesday', 'write', 'was', 'December', '10', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'days', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'single', 'foot', 'wrong', 'movie', 'watching', 'everything', 'came', 'off', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'pure', 'gold', 'bunch', 'favorite', 'was', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'low-budget', 'thriller', 'bursting', 'intelligence', 'crossed', 'mind', 'more', 'once', 'movie', 'Primer', 'wanted', 'be', 'estimation', 'never', 'managed', 'become', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'Universal', 'remaking', 'rather', 'using', 'rights', 'push', 'film', 'far', 'far', 'wider', 'recognition', 'so', 'far', 'gotten', 'Why', 'do', 'get', 'distinct', 'impression', 'remake', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'dumbed', 'point', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'Plot', 'Cody', 'See', 'Jane', 'Run', 'Sasha', 'Andreev', 'parents', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'then', 'had', 'two', 'obsessions', 'taking', 'care', 'younger', 'brother', 'James', 'Aberration', 'Max', 'Hauser', 'building', 'machine', 'will', 'allow', 'communicate', 'parents', 'afterlife', 'course', 'doing', 'such', 'things', 'parts', 'parts', 'more', 'parts', 'certain', 'combination', 'same', 'attention', 'Tom', 'Factotum', 'Matthew', 'Feeney', 'who', 'pieces', 'side', 'Cody', 'bought', 'store', 'Tom', 'Cody', 'machine', 'bugs', 'worked', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'do', '8212', 'results', 'Cody', 'Tom', 'could', 'have', 'predicted.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'last', 'year', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'Bellflower', 'movie', 'Osterman', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'taken', 'generic', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'direction', 'instead', 'reminded', 'great', 'deal', 'wonderful', 'little', '2004', 'French', 'film', 'Les', 'Revenants', 'Osterman', 'instead', 'characters', 'reactions', 'what', 'going', 'rather', 'spending', 'movie', 'time', 'reveling', 'wonderment', '8220', 'hey', 'look', 'what', 'did', 'how', 'many', 'CGI', 'effects', 'used', 'do', '8221', 'not', 'movie', 'stuff-blows-up', 'crowd', 'unfortunately', 'appeal', 'broad', 'market', 'who', 'appreciate', 'intelligence', 'empathy', 'great', 'story', 'will', 'find', 'exactly', 'kind', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'lives', 'realizing', '****']",Ghost From the Machine

If not for the ending - or lack thereof - I would have given ""Ghost from the Machine"" 4 stars.First of all, I'm not sure who other reviewers were referring to about the bad acting, but I thought the guys who played Cody and his brother James did a great job. They were totally believable as two young men who had recently and tragically lost their parents in a car accident - both were woodenly ""going through the motions.""  I thought the other actors were okay too.  Everyone had their own grief to deal with, or they were finding it difficult/awkward to be around the two boys. Having said that, my husband said the guy who played Tom, the electrical engineer with the dead wife, was a bad actor.  But having said THAT, I thought he did a great job.Except for the good-looking actor who played Cody, the choice of average-looking actors added to the believability and authenticity to what could have been a far-fetched Hollywood production full of beautiful people.I thoroughly enjoyed the discreet creepiness and suspense in Ghost from the Machine. You kept waiting for those Sixth-Sense-esque moments - of which there were several.  As I said, however, this movie could have been so much better.  I agree with other reviewers who noted holes in the plot which gave the movie a disjointed feel - and not in a good way. For one thing, it needed more build-up as to WHY Cody was making the machine in addition to all the technical stuff. It was almost as if half the film ended up on the cutting-room floor.***WARNING!!!  POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!!***What was up with the ending?! We couldn't believe it! Did the writer/director/producers suddenly decide they were tired of writing/directing/producing this movie? ""Let's just end it here and go home, folks."" Either that, or it was a deliberate set-up for a sequel. (Tom trying to rebuild the machine hinted at a sequel?) Whatever the case, the resolution (a.k.a., denouement) was incomplete, unsatisfying, and terribly disappointing.  In addition to resolving the issue with James being removed from the home, I would have ended the movie with a twist - similar to the ending of The Sixth Sense.

Though not nearly so head-twisting (it's not meant to be), it offers an intelligent plot surrounding the trials and tribulations of building an electronic device to accomplish the &#34;impossible&#34;. The goal and its motivation are revealed to us slowly, a credit to the writers, as we spend a good deal of time wondering what drives our protagonist. The writing is sly - plot reveals come at odd angles, dialogue is oblique, and the scene construction is lean. Be warned that this style of storytelling eschews the modern staples (gimmicks) of jump scares and even jumpier editing. But its lower budget production values serve the style - confident, unadorned filmmaking, where story and character come to the fore. Like a Stephen King story, we invest ourselves in &#34;a build&#34; which pays off in some genuinely creepy moments and deep poignance.
