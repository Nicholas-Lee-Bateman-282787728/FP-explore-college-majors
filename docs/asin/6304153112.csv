The excitement wore off quickly.Hollis Figg was a slightly different character than the one Don Knotts usually played.  He was a bit on the grouchy side (""I don't chew my cabbage twice!"").  I liked that.  I did not, however, like his annoying sidekick.  I don't know why they felt Don needed a bumbling idiot for a friend; Don usually handled that himself, and a lot better than this boob.  The boob in question was Frank Welker, playing the obnoxious friend Prentiss Gates.  I don't know who to fault for this, the writer(s) or the director.  Someone had to have told Welker to act like that because I can't believe they'd let him get away with single-handedly ruining the film with that performance.  This was beyond goofy; this was certifiable, as in: how could they let someone like that loose on the streets?  The effect was as if someone kept hitting a sour note on an untuned piano: loudly, repeatedly.  The minute Prentiss showed up in a scene I had to brace myself for the worse, which he consistently gave.  It's a shame that one actor/character could ruin an entire movie but there it is, I can't see putting myself through this again.

404490,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,6304153112,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[0, 0]","The last stand-alone film for Don Knotts, ""How to Frame a Figg"" may not be a laugh riot, but it is a funny, enjoyable romp for all ages.The Plot? Here goes;Knotts plays bumbling accountant Hollis Figg who's retained by the City Hall council because they feel he's too stupid to uncover all their fraud 'n graft. Thanks to his outdated computer, LEO, Knotts does stumble into the truth, he just doesn't realize it until after he's promoted to councilman with lots of perks. City Hall sets him up to take the fall, but Knotts along with his best friend and girlfriend try to come up with evidence to prove otherwise.Knotts, who was listed as a co-writer of the story, is in fine form as the nervous Figg and has a few priceless scenes. Including a bowling ball getting stuck to his hand, a drunken scene at his secretary's apartment, and the climax of the film at the graveyard. He's at the top of his game when miffed, but trying to hold it back. And even the little things, such as Figg's photo in the paper is enough to conjure a laugh.The supporting cast is filled with recognizable vets as Joe Flynn and Ed Andrews as the Mayor.On the downside, I found the pacing of the movie to be a trifle bit slow with a nice, but unnecessary scene with the Mayor and Figg's girlfriend (played by Elaine Joyce) at the diner. Also, Figg's best friend Prentiss played by Frank Welker (the most prolific voice-over actor of our time) is too cute by half. I understand he's not suppose to be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he pushes the ""sillyness"" a little much for my tastes. While watching with a few friends, we chortled a bit at Figg's supposed age of ""34""...really? Knotts was 46 at the time and looked every bit of it.The DVD itself is rather bare bones as it only includes the original trailer for the film. But considering the price this is to be expected. For the trailer, Knotts and Yvonne Craig (of ""Batgirl"" fame) did some additional footage which is kinda nice.If you enjoy Don Knotts, this film is for you. If you're not sure, I'd recommend viewing his classic performances as Deputy Barney Fife in the ""Andy Griffith Show"" first.",4,Who Knew Framing a Figg Was So Funny?,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,2138,"['last', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'How', 'Frame', 'Figg', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'laugh', 'riot', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'ages.The', 'Plot', 'Here', 'Knotts', 'bumbling', 'accountant', 'Hollis', 'Figg', 'who', 'retained', 'City', 'Hall', 'council', 'feel', 'too', 'stupid', 'uncover', 'fraud', 'n', 'graft', 'Thanks', 'outdated', 'computer', 'LEO', 'Knotts', 'stumble', 'truth', 'just', ""n't"", 'realize', 'promoted', 'councilman', 'lots', 'perks', 'City', 'Hall', 'up', 'take', 'fall', 'Knotts', 'best', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'try', 'come', 'up', 'evidence', 'prove', 'otherwise.Knotts', 'who', 'was', 'listed', 'co-writer', 'story', 'fine', 'form', 'nervous', 'Figg', 'few', 'priceless', 'scenes', 'Including', 'bowling', 'ball', 'getting', 'stuck', 'hand', 'drunken', 'scene', 'secretary', 'apartment', 'climax', 'film', 'graveyard', 'top', 'game', 'when', 'miffed', 'trying', 'hold', 'back', 'even', 'little', 'things', 'such', 'Figg', 'photo', 'paper', 'enough', 'conjure', 'laugh.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'filled', 'recognizable', 'vets', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Ed', 'Andrews', 'Mayor.On', 'downside', 'found', 'pacing', 'movie', 'be', 'trifle', 'bit', 'slow', 'nice', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'Mayor', 'Figg', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Elaine', 'Joyce', 'diner', 'Also', 'Figg', 'best', 'friend', 'Prentiss', 'played', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'most', 'prolific', 'voice-over', 'actor', 'time', 'too', 'cute', 'half', 'understand', 'not', 'suppose', 'be', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'sillyness', 'little', 'much', 'tastes', 'watching', 'few', 'friends', 'chortled', 'bit', 'Figg', 'supposed', 'age', '34', 'really', 'Knotts', 'was', '46', 'time', 'looked', 'bit', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'rather', 'bare', 'bones', 'only', 'original', 'trailer', 'film', 'considering', 'price', 'be', 'expected', 'trailer', 'Knotts', 'Yvonne', 'Craig', 'Batgirl', 'fame', 'did', 'additional', 'footage', 'kinda', 'enjoy', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'viewing', 'classic', 'performances', 'Deputy', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'first']",How to Frame a Figg VHS

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[63, 68]","Alan Rafkin (1928-2001, who mostly directed television shows and was nominated for four Emmies and won one in 1982) directed his last bit-screen film with &quot;How To Frame A Figg&quot; in 1971.  Taking place in a small fictional town, a bungling city accountant, Hollis Alexander Figg (Don Knotts), becomes the unwitting patsy of the town's mayor (Mayor Chisholm played by Edward Andrews), the town's wealthiet man (Old Charley Spaulding played by Parker Fennelly) as well as several other high-ranking city officials who have been embezzling the town's money.  To prevent from being caught, the embezzlers fire all of the town's accountants, except for Hollis so that he can operate their newly purchased (but used), room-filling computer known as LEO.  While demonstrating the computer to his friend Prentiss Gates (Frank Welker), Hollis stumbles upon a questionable city contract that Prentiss (who works for the city's sanitation department) has in his waste collection cart.  To keep Hollis from finding any other questionable financial statements, Mayor Chisholm appoints Hollis to be a commissioner with his own private secretary, Glorianna Hastings (Yvonne Craig, who is better known as Batgirl/Barbara Gordon in the 1966-1968 TV series &quot;Batman&quot;) to the chagrin Hollis' girlfriend, Ema Letha Kusic (Elaine Joyce), who works as a diner waitress.  Hollis remains oblivious to being used until Old Charley Spaulding is ready to lower the boom upon him and is forced to find a way to prove his innocence.&quot;How To Frame A Figg&quot; isn't known as well as some of his previous films (&quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; in 1964, &quot;The Ghost and Mr. Chicken&quot; in 1966, etc.) due to its somewhat weak plot, but it's still a very funny film that can entertain both children and adults alike.  Memorable scenes in the film include Hollis' fingers getting stuck in a bowling ball, Old Charlie Spaulding using his cane in city hall meetings, the ketchup scene at the diner, the garbage truck delivery, and the search for extension cords.  Overall, I rate &quot;How To Frame a Figg&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters in the film include Kermit Sanderson (Joe Flynn, 1925-1974), Commissioner Henderson (Bill Zuckert, 1915-1997) and Dr. Schmidt (Pitt Herbert, 1914-1989).",4,A Very Entertaining Don Knotts Film,1068422400,"11 10, 2003",2003,2313,"['Alan', 'Rafkin', '1928-2001', 'who', 'mostly', 'directed', 'television', 'shows', 'was', 'nominated', 'four', 'Emmies', 'won', 'one', '1982', 'directed', 'last', 'bit-screen', 'film', 'quot', 'How', 'Frame', 'A', 'Figg', 'quot', '1971', 'Taking', 'place', 'small', 'fictional', 'town', 'bungling', 'city', 'accountant', 'Hollis', 'Alexander', 'Figg', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'unwitting', 'patsy', 'town', 'mayor', 'Mayor', 'Chisholm', 'played', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'town', 'wealthiet', 'man', 'Old', 'Charley', 'Spaulding', 'played', 'Parker', 'Fennelly', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'other', 'high-ranking', 'city', 'officials', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'embezzling', 'town', 'money', 'prevent', 'being', 'caught', 'embezzlers', 'fire', 'town', 'accountants', 'Hollis', 'so', 'can', 'operate', 'newly', 'purchased', 'used', 'room-filling', 'computer', 'known', 'LEO', 'demonstrating', 'computer', 'friend', 'Prentiss', 'Gates', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'Hollis', 'questionable', 'city', 'contract', 'Prentiss', 'who', 'city', 'sanitation', 'department', 'waste', 'collection', 'cart', 'keep', 'Hollis', 'finding', 'other', 'questionable', 'financial', 'statements', 'Mayor', 'Chisholm', 'appoints', 'Hollis', 'be', 'commissioner', 'own', 'private', 'secretary', 'Glorianna', 'Hastings', 'Yvonne', 'Craig', 'who', 'better', 'known', 'Batgirl/Barbara', 'Gordon', '1966-1968', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'chagrin', 'Hollis', 'girlfriend', 'Ema', 'Letha', 'Kusic', 'Elaine', 'Joyce', 'who', 'diner', 'waitress', 'Hollis', 'oblivious', 'being', 'used', 'Old', 'Charley', 'Spaulding', 'ready', 'lower', 'boom', 'forced', 'find', 'way', 'prove', 'innocence.', 'quot', 'How', 'Frame', 'A', 'Figg', 'quot', ""n't"", 'known', 'as', 'well', 'previous', 'films', 'quot', 'Incredible', 'Mr.', 'Limpet', 'quot', '1964', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'Mr.', 'Chicken', 'quot', '1966', 'etc', 'due', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'plot', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'can', 'entertain', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'include', 'Hollis', 'fingers', 'getting', 'stuck', 'bowling', 'ball', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'Spaulding', 'using', 'cane', 'city', 'hall', 'meetings', 'ketchup', 'scene', 'diner', 'garbage', 'truck', 'delivery', 'search', 'extension', 'cords', 'Overall', 'rate', 'quot', 'How', 'Frame', 'Figg', 'quot', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Kermit', 'Sanderson', 'Joe', 'Flynn', '1925-1974', 'Commissioner', 'Henderson', 'Bill', 'Zuckert', '1915-1997', 'Dr.', 'Schmidt', 'Pitt', 'Herbert', '1914-1989']",How to Frame a Figg VHS

Like Danny Kaye's films, Don's characters are usually innocents put into improbable situations, in which he must extricate himself (notable exception: The Incredible Mr. Limpet).  Such is the case in How To Frame a Figg.  What I love most about this film, other than the Vic Mizzy soundtrack, is/are the supporting players.  This is one of the few films I've seen with Frank Welker in the flesh.  We know him for his animal voices on the Simpsons, and Fred on Scooby-Doo.  Here, Welker does his best Buddy Hackett impression as Knotts' sidekick.  Knott's girlfriend is played by the extraordinary Elaine Joyce (Seen her in Motel Hell lately?), The ""framer"" in this film is played by white-haired, bespectacled Edward Andrews.  He, along with Joe Flynn, are common bad guys in Disney films, and will be as familiar to you as Yvonne ""Batgirl"" Craig, who also appears in the film.

404496,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,6304153112,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","In what was comedian Don Knotts' last hurrah at Universal (before moving on to Disney Studios and a memorable teaming with Tim Conway), ""How to Frame a Figg"" isn't a bad film to exit on. Set against the backdrop of the town of Dalton (Knotts' movies always revolved around small towns), Knotts plays another nervously hapless character: Hollis Figg, a lowly accountant for City Hall who unwittingly becomes a scapegoat for the corrupt city council (featuring such great comic actors as Edward Andrews & Joe Flynn) who's misusing the city funds. When Figg is finally framed (hence, the movie's title), he decides to expose them with the help of his waitressing sweetheart (Elaine Joyce) & goofball pal (Frank Welker, a fine foil for Knotts). Also look for TV's ""Batgirl"" from the Batman series (Yvonne Craig) as Knotts' curvy but deceptive secretary. Interspersed among the standard comedy bits--such as the catsup bit in the restaurant or Knotts getting a bowling ball stuck to his hand--there are some decidedly offbeat moments: The city council burying the LEO computer which holds all the evidence against them, and then Knotts & Welker stealing nearly every extension cord from all over town just to power up LEO. The film even does a variation on the ""malfunctioning elevator"" routine from ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"".Probably a notch below Knotts' earlier films.

He'd just shimmy in place, stammer, and drop the microphone if he tried to accept any accolades anyway.  This particular film sums up his homespun humor and at the same time gave him a bit of a backbone to play for the only time in his career (and whenever I think of the quintessential example of his persona i keep going back to the cameo appearance he makes in 'It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' with Phil Silvers...if ever there were two polar opposites in screen presence it had to be the glib, con artistry of Phil Silvers up against the countrybumpkin of Don Knotts...but that's another movie).  As I was saying Don gets to exhibit all of his comedic timing and a new aspect of his character to great advantage.  Knotts made gentle comedies that spring out of his everyman cowardice and this is no exception.

404499,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304153112,trebe,"[0, 0]","After a string of successful comedies that included The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966), and The Reluctant Astronaut (1967), Don Knotts closed out his five picture deal with Universal Studios with How To Frame A Figg (1972).  Unfortunately, the script written by Knotts and Edward Montagne (McHale's Navy), is not very strong.This time the bumbling, bug-eyed Knotts, is Hollis Figg, an accountant for the city, who is doing just fine, until an unscrupulous city commissioner, the mayor, and his staff, decide to set him up to take the blame for the crooked dealings they have been engaged in.  The rest of the accounting staff is fired, and replaced by a computer named 'LEO' (Large-capcity Enumerative Officiator), leaving Figg the top man in the department.Hollis's best friend Prentiss (Frank Welker), and his girlfriend Ema Letha (Elaine Joyce), are suitably impressed by his sudden promotion, as Figg is featured with the city bigwigs in the local paper.  Plugging some figures into the computer, he stumbles onto the fact that there is something crooked going on.  Reporting this to his superiors, causes them to accelerate their plans, and Hollis is moved to a plush new office, given a new red Cadillac, and assigned the beautiful Glorianna Hastings (Yvonne 'Batgirl' Craig), as his new secretary.  Glorianna is in the employ of the city fathers, and before long, Hollis is called in and denounced for being a crook, with thousands in cash stashed away in a safety deposit box.For a change, Knotts has a partner, teaming with Welker.  Prentiss, a carefree member of the city's sanitation department, strains even the goofy Figg's patience, with his well meaning, but slightly thick-headed behavior.  Welker became and remains a legend in the industry, doing voice work, but acting is probably not what he is best at.  The two work together well enough, but there are more and a few awkward moments as Hollis and Prentiss attempt to use LEO to help process crucial evidence, and then later finish the job, in an open grave in a cemetery.  Notable are Knott's appearance in drag, and a gag involving stealing electrical devices, to get power to the half buried LEO.  Still, things somehow don't seem quite right, with Prentiss playing dumber than Figg.Don Knotts began his run with Universal, with The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, but he never approached the same brilliance in any of the subsequent four films, and his contract was not renewed after this movie.  The Love God (1969), had been targeted at a more adult audience, but the humor here, is at a more juvenile level.  If you are looking for a sophisticated comedy, this is not it.  Fans of 60's comedy will see familiar faces like Edward Andrews, Joe Flynn, Bob Hastings, and Bruce Kirby.  As he did for Knotts' previous films for Universal, Vic Mizzy provides the music.  This time his light and fun score, seems to have a lot of Green Acres flavor to it.  After this, Knotts' film career in the 70's was largely for Disney, and in a partnership that really did work, Knotts teamed with Tim Conway in several films.",3,"uncovering corruption, and graft at city hall . . .",1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,3074,"['string', 'successful', 'comedies', 'included', 'Ghost', 'Mr.', 'Chicken', '1966', 'Reluctant', 'Astronaut', '1967', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'closed', 'out', 'five', 'picture', 'deal', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'How', 'Frame', 'A', 'Figg', '1972', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'written', 'Knotts', 'Edward', 'Montagne', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'not', 'very', 'strong.This', 'time', 'bumbling', 'bug-eyed', 'Knotts', 'Hollis', 'Figg', 'accountant', 'city', 'who', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'unscrupulous', 'city', 'commissioner', 'mayor', 'staff', 'decide', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'blame', 'crooked', 'dealings', 'have', 'been', 'engaged', 'rest', 'accounting', 'staff', 'fired', 'replaced', 'computer', 'named', ""'LEO"", 'Large-capcity', 'Enumerative', 'Officiator', 'leaving', 'Figg', 'top', 'man', 'department.Hollis', 'best', 'friend', 'Prentiss', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'girlfriend', 'Ema', 'Letha', 'Elaine', 'Joyce', 'are', 'suitably', 'impressed', 'sudden', 'promotion', 'Figg', 'featured', 'city', 'bigwigs', 'local', 'paper', 'Plugging', 'figures', 'computer', 'fact', 'something', 'crooked', 'going', 'Reporting', 'superiors', 'accelerate', 'plans', 'Hollis', 'moved', 'plush', 'new', 'office', 'given', 'new', 'red', 'Cadillac', 'assigned', 'beautiful', 'Glorianna', 'Hastings', 'Yvonne', ""'Batgirl"", 'Craig', 'new', 'secretary', 'Glorianna', 'employ', 'city', 'fathers', 'long', 'Hollis', 'called', 'denounced', 'being', 'crook', 'thousands', 'cash', 'stashed', 'away', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box.For', 'change', 'Knotts', 'partner', 'teaming', 'Welker', 'Prentiss', 'carefree', 'member', 'city', 'sanitation', 'department', 'strains', 'even', 'goofy', 'Figg', 'patience', 'well', 'meaning', 'slightly', 'thick-headed', 'behavior', 'Welker', 'became', 'legend', 'industry', 'doing', 'voice', 'work', 'acting', 'probably', 'not', 'what', 'best', 'two', 'work', 'together', 'well', 'enough', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'awkward', 'moments', 'Hollis', 'Prentiss', 'attempt', 'use', 'LEO', 'help', 'process', 'crucial', 'evidence', 'then', 'later', 'finish', 'job', 'open', 'grave', 'cemetery', 'Notable', 'are', 'Knott', 'appearance', 'drag', 'gag', 'involving', 'stealing', 'electrical', 'devices', 'get', 'power', 'half', 'buried', 'LEO', 'Still', 'things', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'Prentiss', 'playing', 'dumber', 'Figg.Don', 'Knotts', 'began', 'run', 'Universal', 'Ghost', 'Mr.', 'Chicken', 'never', 'approached', 'same', 'brilliance', 'subsequent', 'four', 'films', 'contract', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'movie', 'Love', 'God', '1969', 'had', 'been', 'targeted', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'humor', 'here', 'more', 'juvenile', 'level', 'are', 'looking', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'not', 'Fans', '60', 'comedy', 'will', 'see', 'familiar', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Bob', 'Hastings', 'Bruce', 'Kirby', 'did', 'Knotts', 'previous', 'films', 'Universal', 'Vic', 'Mizzy', 'music', 'time', 'light', 'fun', 'score', 'have', 'lot', 'Green', 'Acres', 'flavor', 'Knotts', 'film', 'career', '70', 'was', 'largely', 'Disney', 'partnership', 'really', 'did', 'work', 'Knotts', 'teamed', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'several', 'films']",How to Frame a Figg VHS
