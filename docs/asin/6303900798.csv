It gets under your skin and stays there.  Moore, the best actress of her generation, has never been better (although you should see &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; for more of her range).  I respect Haynes for respecting me enough to let me decide how to interpret what he shows me.  Great movie.  (By the way, someone earlier wrote, &quot;Todd Haynes is an amazing director (and he's gay of course!).&quot;  I'm still trying to decipher that one.  (Haynes is also Caucasian--does that also make him an amazing director?)",5,In my top ten for the 90s,976579200,"12 12, 2000",2000,691,"['Haynes', 'style', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'Kubrick', 'static', 'long', 'shots', 'deliberate', 'gradual', 'pace', 'startling', 'unexpected', 'cut', 'black', 'end', 'skin', 'stays', 'there', 'Moore', 'best', 'actress', 'generation', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'should', 'see', 'quot', 'Vanya', '42nd', 'Street', 'quot', 'more', 'range', 'respect', 'Haynes', 'respecting', 'enough', 'let', 'decide', 'how', 'interpret', 'what', 'Great', 'movie', 'way', 'someone', 'earlier', 'wrote', 'quot', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'amazing', 'director', 'gay', 'course', 'quot', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decipher', 'one', 'Haynes', 'also', 'Caucasian', 'also', 'make', 'amazing', 'director']",Safe VHS
387379,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,6303900798,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[10, 11]","The description &quot;horror film of the soul&quot; sums it up well.  This is a film full of the despair of Carol White (Julianne Moore), a lost angel  of Los Angeles.  The whole 1st half seems to be setting the scenario that  she's allergic not simply to the chemical biproducts of society, but to  society itself, or possibly to her own soul's emptiness (another biproduct  of society).  The whole empty LA lifestyle atmosphere was created--the  disco gym, the upper-middle class house chores, the freeway, the nadir  husband, the vacuous baby shower guests--it all hints that Safe is going to  blow the whole thing wide open and make a gigantic statement about the  individual lost in society.  It makes the statement alright, but in such a  subtle way--even too subtle.To the unperceptive viewer Safe may seem to  end on a somewhat positive note, because of the subtlety.  Actually the  ending bears resemblance to that of Orwell's 1984, even using the same  final words, &quot;I love you&quot;.  But instead of directing it to Big  Brother (who doesn't really exist) she directs it toward herself (does SHE  really exist?)Carol feels an ominous dread accentuated by a deep-tone  humming soundtrack to her attacks ostensibly brought on by milk, deodorant  spray, exhaust fumes, bug spray, citrus, etc.  The story hints at not  merely toxic chemicals, but toxic people, thoughts.  Now the reason for the  4 stars: what it does NOT even HINT at is toxic society.  I.e. it does not  in essence condemn society, but the biproducts...kind of like comdemning  the Holocaust without condemning Nazis (and everything behind them).The  &quot;solution&quot; to Carol seems to be to go to a New Age Retreat.  The  best way to sum up this retreat is: the road to Oblivion is paved with good  intentions.  In the end no difference exists between her vacuous suburban  mentality and the vacuous new age mentality (summed up in the &quot;I like  myself&quot; void).  It's better to see this film at least twice to figure  out exactly what Safe means from your perspective...because it leaves so  much open for interpretation.",4,Excellent Allegory of Soul lost in Society,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,2114,"['description', 'quot', 'horror', 'film', 'soul', 'quot', 'sums', 'up', 'well', 'film', 'full', 'despair', 'Carol', 'White', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'lost', 'angel', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'whole', '1st', 'half', 'be', 'setting', 'scenario', 'allergic', 'not', 'simply', 'chemical', 'biproducts', 'society', 'society', 'possibly', 'own', 'soul', 'emptiness', 'biproduct', 'society', 'whole', 'empty', 'LA', 'lifestyle', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'created', 'disco', 'gym', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'house', 'chores', 'freeway', 'nadir', 'husband', 'vacuous', 'baby', 'shower', 'guests', 'hints', 'Safe', 'going', 'blow', 'whole', 'thing', 'wide', 'open', 'make', 'gigantic', 'statement', 'individual', 'lost', 'society', 'statement', 'alright', 'such', 'subtle', 'way', 'even', 'too', 'unperceptive', 'viewer', 'Safe', 'may', 'seem', 'end', 'somewhat', 'positive', 'note', 'subtlety', 'Actually', 'ending', 'bears', 'resemblance', 'Orwell', '1984', 'even', 'using', 'same', 'final', 'words', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'instead', 'directing', 'Big', 'Brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'SHE', 'really', 'exist', 'Carol', 'ominous', 'dread', 'accentuated', 'deep-tone', 'humming', 'soundtrack', 'attacks', 'ostensibly', 'brought', 'milk', 'deodorant', 'spray', 'exhaust', 'fumes', 'bug', 'spray', 'citrus', 'etc', 'story', 'hints', 'not', 'merely', 'toxic', 'chemicals', 'toxic', 'people', 'thoughts', 'Now', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'what', 'NOT', 'even', 'HINT', 'toxic', 'society', 'I.e', 'not', 'essence', 'condemn', 'society', 'biproducts', 'kind', 'comdemning', 'Holocaust', 'condemning', 'Nazis', 'everything', '.The', 'quot', 'solution', 'quot', 'Carol', 'be', 'go', 'New', 'Age', 'Retreat', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'retreat', 'road', 'Oblivion', 'paved', 'good', 'intentions', 'end', 'difference', 'vacuous', 'suburban', 'mentality', 'vacuous', 'new', 'age', 'mentality', 'summed', 'up', 'quot', 'like', 'quot', 'void', 'better', 'see', 'film', 'least', 'twice', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'Safe', 'perspective', 'so', 'much', 'open', 'interpretation']",Safe VHS
387380,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303900798,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Todd Haynes has certainly risen as one of the most visionary of the auteur &#8216;art house&#8217; directors out there, melding together a distinct style with more conventional narratives, finding a way to convey some controversial themes in a way that appeals to a large crowd of movie goers.  [SAFE] is one of this very first films, and it is easy to see here why he is so special.  Even with a very artistic feel, the story told here is one that is deeply rooted and deeply unearthed, a rarity, and it uses such subtle means to build a meaningful prose.Isolation, loneliness, apathy, frustration, confliction, vanity and conformation are all used as tools to tell a very rich story about a woman suffering from an unknown ailment linked to the use of household products.Julianne Moore (in a rather remarkable performance) plays Carol White, a housewife living a very posh life until everything starts spinning in circles (literally) and she begins to weaken physically.  She starts to bleed, has seizures, oppressive headaches, bad skin and apparent allergies to everything around her.  Everyone around her is frustrated and confused by her sudden decline and seeming unstable mental state, and soon Carol feels forced to take drastic measures, joining a cult like community of people isolated from the world in order to deal with their allergies to the outside world.Yes, there are subliminal messages through the narrative, but nothing every overly manipulative, all of it falling into place perfectly.  This is a rare film, one that provokes the mind and stirs a pot and offers us a conclusion that feels ambiguous without feeling frustrating.

Generally, that's a good thing--I love, especially in the beginning, how everything seems to be all right until you actually pay closer attention and realize that it's really not.  However, in the latter half of the movie, the director seemed almost to be hiding from the plot, veering it in two different directions--on the one hand, Wrenwood is very cult-like, and the main character gets increasingly drawn in.  On the other hand, she is getting increasingly isolated even within this isolated place.  I expected the ending to be completely devastating in my depiction of her collapse and (self-)destruction.  Instead, it cut off before she really got there.  After discussing this with a friend for a while, we decided that in fact the end did imply that she would continue to get worse until the ending I expected would 'happen'.

SAFE captures this dull, self-obsessed decade perfectly. Carol White (Julianne Moore from Hannibal) is a typically rich, near-catatonic house-spouse with a seemingly pristine existence. Carol has everything that we were led to believe is vitally important for happiness. She is completely protected from the urban horrors of the city, living in her mammoth estate, walled off from all lesser reality. Unfortunately, there is no true escape for Carol, as she begins having physical reactions to the white noise that is her life. Carol has environmental sensitivity, a metaphor that captures the alienation, desolation, and ridiculousness of the entire ""Me-Me!"" generation. Xander Berkeley (Candyman) plays Greg, Carol's frustrated, confused husband. He has all the warmth and understanding of a slab of marble and isn't afraid to show it! Carol gets increasingly worse, sicker, crazier. Greg looks on like a helpess witness of the Hindenberg disaster. Doctors and therapists are useless. Carol finally finds her salvation in a place called Wrenwood, where a cult leader and his followers accept Carol with open arms and wide smiles. Wrenwood allows Carol to spiral down to the absolute bottom. She discovers her total lack of inner lIfe. Her lack of identity. Her interior emptiness. Carol enters the subtle horror of self-affirmation, where she must remind herself that she does actually exist. However, her whole reason for being is now linked forever to her condition. Carol's illness is her identity now. She is the sick one. She is SAFE...  P.S.- Watch for the creepy ""Lester"" character as he lurches along the perifery of the Wrenwood grounds.

In Safe, Moore is astounding as a woman who comes to suffer from mysterious ""environmental illness"". The illness grows progressively worse, and she seeks help from a variety of conventional and homeopathic doctors. The root of her problems don't seem clear, and doctors tell her she is not really sick. She drives herself crazy wondering what is wrong with her, wondering why people don't believe her. Watching her struggle and frustration was interesting because Moore embodied this frustration perfectly. At the same time, though, I felt the whole story hit too close to home for me because I had a close relative go through a similar crisis of identity/health/depression, and being the helpless bystander to what appears to be imaginary illness is incredibly difficult and frustrating. Xander Berkeley as Moore's confused husband is excellent, acting both as a concerned husband but one who runs out of options and does not understand where his wife is coming from nor necessarily who she is or who/how she needs him to be. He never quite reaches a stage of total indifference, but he is frustrated because he does not have a clue what he can do nor what she is going through. As such, this was an interesting look at dynamics in marital relations, and indeed in human relations (how people behave toward others... most perceived Moore's character to be a hypochondriac, and this colored the way they behaved toward her, for example).

At that time I was going to gather a themed collection of horror movies that aren't really horror movies, but that idea fell away and now I can't remember what any of the other movies in it might have been.We open with these credits as we see the driver's POV of a car moving through a subdivision at night. This is the San Fernando Valley of 1987. Then we see Julianne Moore as Carol, having sex with her husband. She is clearly not interested, but she's good, the way she goes through the motions of periodically rubbing his back and giving him a little kiss after he's done. She goes to aerobics class, and afterward her friends observe that she doesn't sweat.Carol is expecting a new couch to be delivered. She comes home to receive a call from her mother [Carol: ""He's fine. She's fine. They're fine. I will. I will, mother.""], then turns to see that the couch has come, and it's black. It's black and she ordered teal! This is the start of all Carol's problems, and this time, it hit all too close to home for me: I'M expecting a couch to be delivered in a few days! Would mine, too, prove to be an ominous omen of lingering ill reproach?By this time you will have noticed that there is always some sort of TV or radio on in the background. Carol's discovery of the couch is hilariously set to ""Turn Your Love Around,"" and we hear many other examples of the banal media that surrounds us. Her maids gossip in Spanish and ignore Carol's calls. Carol returns to the store and is informed that the order states she wanted black. ""Well that's impossible,"" she says, ""because it doesn't go with anything we have."" Afterward, she is driving behind a truck that does not seem to be meeting state and federal emissions regulations. She starts coughing uncontrollably, and pulls into a parking garage, driving through the anonymous space as she hacks and wheezes. It's creepy and scary.SPOILERS > > >We cut from a line of cars on the freeway to a shot of the planet Earth--I love thematically obvious stuff like this. Then her son reads his school report at dinner, about street gangs, with special emphasis on murders, shootings, stabbings, dismemberment.... Then Carol gets a perm--and a nosebleed. Around this time one has begun to notice the large amount of shots set near windows with cars passing by outside. Her husband finds that Carol no longer wants to have sex. He holds her--and she pukes!One day she finds a flyer in the supermarket saying ""Are you allergic to the 20th century?"" which informs her about people who are environmentally sensitive. She goes to her doctor, but he can't find anything wrong with her. She has another attack at a baby or wedding shower, and tells her husband that she's become allergic to all the chemicals that pervade our environment. ""So you think you've been sick because of... bug spray?"" he asks.It goes on. Eventually Carol builds 'safe' room in her house, and soon after takes off for Rainwood, this retreat for chemically-sensitive people, where she meets a featured patient played by Jessica Harper of Suspiria and Phantom of the Paradise. She also meets guru Peter, who one patient says is environmentally sensitive AND has AIDS, so ""his perspective is incredibly vast."" Depending on your point of view, she either finds understanding at last or goes completely off the deep end.&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDAs a conversation piece, it brings up a great deal, chief among which is whether this illness is real at all, or just psychosomatic. When I watched this the first time, I thought it was quite obvious that it was psychosomatic, but now I think the movie is fairly open about how it could be interpreted, and in many ways isn't really about environmental illness at all. There are many who interpret it to be about AIDS, but I think it's mostly about disaffection from the modern world [making it a great double-feature with Ghost World], with the title being ironic; can we ever really be safe? What does it mean to be safe? Most of the chemicals in the products we use are at 'safe' levels. We are clearly shown that Carol doesn't enjoy sex with her husband, but what's interesting about the movie, leaving it open to interpretation, is that although the rest of Carol's life seems boring and banal to US, with the constant talk radio and insipid music [not that ""Turn Your Love Around"" is insipid... well, okay, but not that that's a problem], and aerobics classes and showers and fruit diets, we don't necessarily get much evidence that it's banal to HER. That is to say, her life in incredibly empty, but we don't know for sure if she finds it empty, or we're just projecting onto her.Now I have ""Turn Your Love Around"" in my head.Part of what made me feel this way was an article in New York Magazine about parents with chemical sensitivities, and it mentioned that those people consider this movie their statement. I was like; ""WHAT?! It's an obvious satire!"" but upon review, maybe it's not that obvious. So who knows. Regardless, you might find this Wiki page on MCS, or Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, fascinating, as I did. In it we find that doctors can still find no evidence of a physical basis for their symptoms, and that MCS correlates strongly with depression...Since I watched the movie, I read the essay the writer / director wrote for the DVD booklet, and learned, somewhat to my disappointment, that he does in fact believe in environmental illness, and was making this completely clear and straightforward movie about it. He also explicitly states that he also saw it as a parallel to the AIDS crisis. So, shows what the I know, though I consider it a strength that the movie can be interpreted in multiple ways. By the way, this movie shares an odd number of elements with The Incredible Shrinking Woman. In that film, Lily Tomlin begins shrinking because of all the chemicals in her environment, and there is a similar scene of her trapped in a car with an aerosol chemical, and coughing terribly.But, as a movie? Definitely interesting, but perhaps it leaves a bit to be desired in the storytelling department. This is more of a statement than a drama. Carol has an attack! Then she has a worse attack! Then a WORSE attack! That's about the structure of the screenplay, and while I found it very compelling the first time, in retrospect I think maybe that was just the novelty of the concept. This time--there just isn't much of a story here. The movie is still quite different and worth watching, it's just less of a complete story and structured film than I hoped it would be. It's kind of more of a conversation piece than anything.",3,Some recoil from pine-scented cleaning power,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,6747,"['had', 'seen', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'really',

Qualls,"[3, 7]","Safe - movie, 4 starsNamed by the Village Voice as the Best Film of the 1990s, this resounding social statement a-la-TV-movie-of-the-week is certainly anything but what its title suggests.  Director Todd Haynes has the reputation of pushing limits and making audiences strangely uncomfortable, and this film is no exception.San Fernando Valley, circa 1989.  Carol White (Julianne Moore) is living her perfectly stereotypical upper-middle-class life when suddenly she becomes sick.  When she has allergic reactions to all sorts of chemicals around her, her husband (Xander Berkeley) and doctor think it's all in her head.  However, the hopelessly reserved Carol knows her &quot;environmental illness&quot; is legitimate, uprooting herself and moving into the chemically-sterile community of Wrenwood, New Mexico.  There, she is treated for her mysterious illness by self-help guru Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman) and his bright-eyed cohorts; however, her health continues to decline.The film's statement is quite difficult to detect upon first viewing.  Certainly, the plot is extremely reminiscent of many TV-movies of the 80s and 90s, all showcasing a new disease of the week.  However, it eventually becomes apparent that the film is not a commentary on environmental illness.Performances in the film are all at best adequate, with the exception of Moore, who is undeniably brilliant.  Her detatched, sad carriage and demeanor arguably echoes more loudly than the film's social statement.  Of course, she depends heavily on her subtleties as usual, and when she's onscreen, it's difficult to pay attention to anything else.  Her birthday scene, toward the end of the film, is particularly moving.Haynes's direction is seemingly bland at times-- one may feel as if he's watching a horror movie on Valium.  However, Haynes's complexities eventually show through and what we see is a brillantly sincere and deep commentary on a rather provocative question:  Is anyone ever really safe?",5,Anything but safe.,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1983,"['Safe', 'movie', '4', 'starsNamed', 'Village', 'Voice', 'Best', 'Film', '1990s', 'resounding', 'social', 'statement', 'a-la-TV-movie-of-the-week', 'certainly', 'anything', 'what', 'title', 'Director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'reputation', 'pushing', 'limits', 'making', 'audiences', 'strangely', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'exception.San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'circa', '1989', 'Carol', 'White', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'living', 'perfectly', 'stereotypical', 'upper-middle-class', 'life', 'when', 'suddenly', 'sick', 'When', 'allergic', 'reactions', 'sorts', 'chemicals', 'husband', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'doctor', 'think', 'head', 'However', 'hopelessly', 'reserved', 'Carol', 'quot', 'environmental', 'illness', 'quot', 'legitimate', 'uprooting', 'moving', 'chemically-sterile', 'community', 'Wrenwood', 'New', 'Mexico', 'treated', 'mysterious', 'illness', 'self-help', 'guru', 'Peter', 'Dunning', 'Peter', 'Friedman', 'bright-eyed', 'cohorts', 'however', 'health', 'decline.The', 'film', 'statement', 'quite', 'difficult', 'detect', 'first', 'viewing', 'Certainly', 'plot', 'extremely', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'TV-movies', '80s', '90s', 'showcasing', 'new', 'disease', 'week', 'However', 'eventually', 'apparent', 'film', 'not', 'commentary', 'environmental', 'illness.Performances', 'film', 'are', 'best', 'adequate', 'exception', 'Moore', 'who', 'undeniably', 'brilliant', 'detatched', 'sad', 'carriage', 'demeanor', 'arguably', 'more', 'loudly', 'film', 'social', 'statement', 'course', 'heavily', 'subtleties', 'usual', 'when', 'onscreen', 'difficult', 'pay', 'attention', 'anything', 'else', 'birthday', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'particularly', 'moving.Haynes', 'direction', 'seemingly', 'bland', 'times', 'one', 'may', 'feel', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'Valium', 'However', 'Haynes', 'complexities', 'eventually', 'show', 'what', 'see', 'brillantly', 'sincere', 'deep', 'commentary', 'rather', 'provocative', 'question', 'anyone', 'ever', 'really', 'safe']",Safe VHS
387392,A106016KSI0YQ,6303900798,Jay Dickson,"[23, 23]","This is probably director Todd Haynes's least-known film, and probably his masterpiece. Like JEANNE DIEHLMANN..., the Chantal Ackerman which inspired it, SAFE moves at an incredibly slow pace for its first half to take you into the dreamlike world of its protagonist, a beautiful Los Angeles housewife with almost nothing to do. As you become accustomed to her rhythms, her mounting attacks from (what she believes to be) environmental hazards assume the dimensions of major catastrophes. There is a sequence where Julianne Moore goes into one of these attacks at a shower for a friend--while holding a child on her lap--that is one of the most horrifying scenes I've ever seen in a film, even though it culminates in little more than a nosebleed.Is the heroine simply hysterical? Are there real environmental poisons at work devastating her body? Or is she reacting against a world that seems to have no place for her even while it pretends to value her highly for her beauty and her wealth? The film offers no easy answers, although it moves to a conclusion of the heroine at a dinner party (and then before a mirror) that will absolutely break your heart. Moore's performance may be the single best  before a camera in the Nineties--she's really that good.",5,Beautifully subtle and poignant,976147200,"12 7, 2000",2000,1259,"['probably', 'director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'least-known', 'film', 'probably', 'masterpiece', 'JEANNE', 'DIEHLMANN', 'Chantal', 'Ackerman', 'inspired', 'SAFE', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'pace', 'first', 'half', 'take', 'dreamlike', 'world', 'protagonist', 'beautiful', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'housewife', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'become', 'accustomed', 'rhythms', 'mounting', 'attacks', 'what', 'be', 'environmental', 'hazards', 'assume', 'dimensions', 'major', 'catastrophes', 'sequence', 'where', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'one', 'attacks', 'shower', 'friend', 'holding', 'child', 'lap', 'one', 'most', 'horrifying', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'nosebleed.Is', 'heroine', 'simply', 'hysterical', 'Are', 'there', 'real', 'environmental', 'poisons', 'work', 'devastating', 'body', 'reacting', 'world', 'have', 'place', 'even', 'value', 'highly', 'beauty', 'wealth', 'film', 'easy', 'answers', 'conclusion', 'heroine', 'dinner', 'party', 'then', 'mirror', 'will', 'absolutely', 'break', 'heart', 'Moore', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'best', 'camera', 'Nineties', 'really', 'good']",Safe VHS
387393,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6303900798,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]","I should start this review by stating that I'm not a Julianne Moore fan. A few years back a movie came out, called &quot;Nine Months,&quot; that permanently turned me off this actress. In that movie, she played a whiny, obnoxious lady in a relationship with Hugh Grant. The whole picture revolved around the hijinks that ensued when Moore's character got pregnant and Grant didn't want kids. &quot;Nine Months&quot; was the most syrupy, sappy piece of fluff I have ever seen in my life. Think a Hallmark movie of the week with the emotional content pumped up on steroids, and you'll have an excellent idea of what &quot;Nine Months&quot; looked like. Oh, just to make it even worse, Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack appeared as these two grotesque superparent friends. Yuck. Despite my misgivings about Moore, I decided to give &quot;Safe&quot; a chance after reading its summary. The movie's premise, about a suburban housewife developing an allergy to modern society, was just too promising to pass up. I'm glad I watched the picture. Director Todd Haynes has scored a big coup with this grim take on American society towards the end of the twentieth century. And what a surprise! Moore actually tugged at my heartstrings in a decidedly non-icky way.&quot;Safe&quot; is the story of Carol White, an adrift California housewife in the 1980s. Her life should satisfy: she lives with a husband and child she loves, spends her days doing whatever she wants to do, and lives in a huge house with plenty of money to throw around. What more could any American woman ask for? Apparently, quite a lot. In between the trips to the fitness center, the frequent lunches with female friends, and the important dinners with hubby's business pals, Carol begins to erode mentally and physically. If there's a starting point for this slow descent into illness, it seems to come when White throws a fit over a furniture company delivering the wrong couch. She soon cannot sleep, develops a hacking cough, and always feels bad. Her husband does not help matters. At first, he is sympathetic to his wife's plight, insisting she see a doctor (who finds nothing wrong with her) and offering emotional support. His goodwill doesn't last long, however, as he soon complains that Carol isn't fulfilling her duties as a wife and partner. The additional stress at home only compounds White's vague health problems. A trip to a psychologist offers little in the way of help, nor does a stay in the hospital after Carol has a seizure outside a dry cleaning business. This lady has a big problem, one that hauling around a little oxygen tank will not clear up anytime soon.During the stay in the hospital, Carol finds salvation. An advertisement for a health spa called Wrenwood, located somewhere in New Mexico, promises to help people with unspecified health problems. Convinced this place is the only answer, White implores her husband to take her there. Wrenwood turns out to be both more and less than Carol White had hoped for. The facility is populated with a bunch of people, like White, who cannot seem to function in modern society. Even worse, the chap who runs the place, Peter Dunning, is one of those new age types. Dunning claims contracting the AIDS virus led him to set up the clinic so he can help people suffering from strange maladies. His speeches to his &quot;patients,&quot; made in a special room complete with podium, cheesy murals, and musical instruments, convey the sense that this guy's running a cult. He likes to play around with people's minds, too, during intense &quot;therapy&quot; sessions where he tries to convince the patients that they made themselves sick. That may well be true in some of these cases, but the way Dunning goes about trying to heal these people is grotesque. In the end, Carol White is worse off than she was when she arrived at Wrenwood.&quot;Safe&quot; works due to Haynes's masterful direction and sense of atmosphere. On more than one occasion, his cinematic approach reminded me of Stanley Kubrick. Haynes has that same ability to light and shoot a scene that looks like a giant hand squeezed all the emotion and life out of it. This tendency is especially prevalent in the first half of the film as we watch Carol start her slow decline. There's a great scene where we see White standing in her opulent living room, but Haynes shoots it so it looks like a mausoleum devoid of any feeling or life. If you look closely enough, Carol White appears as just another piece of furniture in the room. Amazing, simply amazing, and probably a good hint at the film's central theme. Our heroine really is just another ornament in this house, and her husband treats her that way. I suspect Carol's illness is related to her awareness that her life is essentially empty of meaning. Perhaps the illness is an attempt to get attention from those around her, or her body's way of rejecting the sterile background of her daily life.Whatever the case, &quot;Safe&quot; is a deeply unsettling film that raises more questions than answers. Julianne Moore turns in a fabulous performance as the deeply flawed Carol White, as does Xander Berkeley as her distant husband. Peter Friedman threatens to steal the show, however, as the smarmy Peter Dunning. A commentary track on the disc done by Moore and Haynes seems to shoot holes in any attempt to see the film as a serious commentary on modern life. Both actress and director laugh and giggle a lot during the commentary, obviously getting a kick out of poking fun at the new age themes in the film. Still, &quot;Safe&quot; is an observation on our sick society, and fans of cinema will definitely want to check this gem out posthaste.",5,Eerie and brilliant,1086048000,"06 1,

In essence Carol has only one responsibility: her leisure time.  She tries to fill her free time with aerobics, beauty salon visits, and new acquisitions for their safeguarded home.  These activities do not provide an outlet for Carol's own identity as she is a mere trophy wife.  Eventually Carol's body begins to rebel against herself through nausea, headaches, and nose bleeding.  The family doctor examines Carol and he finds nothing wrong as her physical miseries worsen.  Carol is sent to a psychiatrist, but her subdued persona does not cooperate.  Carol's health continues to deteriorate as she discovers an organization that enlightens people about environmental illness.  Environmental illness is an over hypersensitivity to pollution, pesticides, and all other toxins in the environment that exist in foods, perfumes and make-up among other things.  This means that Carol must remove herself from civilization and the world in which she lives.  Carol departs for a new age health sanctuary, Wrenwood, where she begins her recovery.  Initially Carol improves physically, however, as she comes across a closely located highway her health begins to decline again.Safe has a lingering effect as it slowly moves forward as Haynes purposely displays each scene in order to build a deep understanding of Carol's identity.  It becomes an exploration of Julianne Moore's character as Haynes dissects Carol's psychology through meticulous direction of every scene.  When the scenes are edited together it leaves the audience with a profound insight of Carol's illness.  This insight offers a disturbing experience as Carol's decisions continue to affect her negatively both physically and socially.  Julianne Moore's performance enhances the distortion of her character's mind as she performs brilliantly, which leaves the audience with a fascinating cinematic experience.",4,Excellent Psychological Drama with Lingering Effect,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,2026,"['Carol', 'White', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'homemaker', 'life', 'doing', 'daily', 'chores', 'housewife', 'family', 'maid', 'care', 'household', 'tasks', 'essence', 'Carol', 'only', 'one', 'responsibility', 'leisure', 'time', 'fill', 'free', 'time', 'aerobics', 'beauty', 'salon', 'visits', 'new', 'acquisitions', 'safeguarded', 'home', 'activities', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'outlet', 'Carol', 'own', 'identity', 'mere', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Eventually', 'Carol', 'body', 'rebel', 'nausea', 'headaches', 'nose', 'bleeding', 'family', 'doctor', 'examines', 'Carol', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'physical', 'miseries', 'worsen', 'Carol', 'sent', 'psychiatrist', 'subdued', 'persona', 'not', 'cooperate', 'Carol', 'health', 'deteriorate', 'organization', 'people', 'environmental', 'illness', 'Environmental', 'illness', 'hypersensitivity', 'pollution', 'pesticides', 'other', 'toxins', 'environment', 'exist', 'foods', 'perfumes', 'make-up', 'other', 'things', 'Carol', 'must', 'remove', 'civilization', 'world', 'Carol', 'new', 'age', 'health', 'sanctuary', 'Wrenwood', 'where', 'recovery', 'Initially', 'Carol', 'physically', 'however', 'closely', 'located', 'highway', 'health', 'decline', 'again.Safe', 'lingering', 'effect', 'forward', 'Haynes', 'purposely', 'scene', 'order', 'build', 'deep', 'understanding', 'Carol', 'identity', 'exploration', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'character', 'Haynes', 'Carol', 'psychology', 'meticulous', 'direction', 'scene', 'When', 'scenes', 'are', 'edited', 'audience', 'profound', 'insight', 'Carol', 'illness', 'insight', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'Carol', 'decisions', 'continue', 'affect', 'negatively', 'physically', 'socially', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'performance', 'distortion', 'character', 'mind', 'brilliantly', 'audience', 'fascinating', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Safe VHS

Only about five years later than the first sightings of AIDS victims in the USA. Even though Carol White was portrayed as a vacuous, self-effacing, and possibly self-loathing homemaker, I don't think that her ailments were psychosomatic. Nor do I believe that her malaise had anything to do with the environment. It made perfect sense that she was seduced into seeking healing and hope at the retreat in New Mexico directed by the New Age charlatan (after all, these people still flourish today).Safe stunningly reveals the cultural arrogance that existed back in the 1980's in any country that was fertile ground for the nouveau wealthy, the already rich, and the affluent. Nice people with nice homes, cars, looks, clothes and very good jobs simply did not get AIDS. Alas, if bank accounts and social acceptability were the only real immunity against venereal and immune deficiency diseases, then most of us would already be dead.Check out the very last scene in the film where Carol White looks intently into the mirror in her quasi-bubble residence.

387398,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,6303900798,Lleu Christopher,"[8, 11]","I think this is one of the best and most significant films of the 90s. It is a very introspective film, so if you require shootouts, steamy sex scenes and explosions to remain interested, this is definitely not the movie for you. Even fans of independent films may find their attention spans challenged by the deliberately slow paced and downbeat style of Safe. It is, however, well worth paying attention to. I've seen this movie three times now, and I notice more with each viewing. The opening frame, which puts brackets around the title [Safe] is a study in itself. Carol White (the name, like many details in this film, is quite significant), played by Julianne Moore, is an affluent suburban housewife who apparently becomes allergic to everything around her. Yet Safe, which might first seem like a made-for-television disease-of-the-week affair, has a far more subtle and thought-provoking theme than illness. From the start, we are oppressed by the white, sterile perfection of Carol's environment. The interiors of her house could have been designed by a feng shui consultant. The colors are all soft; everything is arranged in perfect symmetry. When a furniture store accidentally delivers a black rather than teal couch to the house, Carol panics (black=impurity). Carol at first attributes her illness to stress and her doctor concurs. Yet her life is anything but stressful; we see her float from the health club to the hair salon to lunch with a friend at a restaurant. Her symptoms worsen, and she learns about environmental illness; ""Are you allergic to the 20th Century?"" a flyer asks. As Carol becomes unable to cope with her life, she enters Wrenwood, a new age retreat center that promises to cleanse the body and spirit of impurities. Wrenwood preaches a self-righteous philosophy of asceticism, withdrawl from society and positive thinking. In Safe, director Todd Haynes has taken a profound look at some disconcerting aspects of modern society. What is perhaps best about the film is its nuanced performances. Carol, though ill and upset, is never completely out of control for long; she always returns to her ""I'm fine"" persona (which is part of her problem). The new age center and its staff, which could have been a parody of silliness or cultishness, is similarly subtle. If you listen to what they preach and the effects it has on patients (everyone is always on the verge of tears), you can see the flaws and distortions, but it's sophisticated and plausible enough that you can also see how people might fall for it. Safe suggests that the desire to escape all forms of impurity may be one of the most pathological things about our culture.",5,Safe can be deadly,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,2671,"['think', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'significant', 'films', '90s', 'very', 'introspective', 'film', 'so', 'require', 'shootouts', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'explosions', 'remain', 'interested', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'Even', 'fans', 'independent', 'films', 'may', 'find', 'attention', 'spans', 'challenged', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'paced', 'downbeat', 'style', 'Safe', 'however', 'well', 'paying', 'attention', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'notice', 'more', 'viewing', 'opening', 'frame', 'brackets', 'title', '[', 'Safe', ']', 'study', 'Carol', 'White', 'name', 'many', 'details', 'film', 'quite', 'significant', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'affluent', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'who', 'apparently', 'allergic', 'everything', 'around', 'Safe', 'might', 'first', 'seem', 'made-for-television', 'disease-of-the-week', 'affair', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'thought-provoking', 'theme', 'illness', 'start', 'are', 'oppressed', 'white', 'sterile', 'perfection', 'Carol', 'environment', 'interiors', 'house', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'feng', 'shui', 'consultant', 'colors', 'are', 'soft', 'everything', 'arranged', 'perfect', 'symmetry', 'When', 'furniture', 'store', 'accidentally', 'black', 'rather', 'teal', 'couch', 'house', 'Carol', 'panics', 'black=impurity', 'Carol', 'first', 'illness', 'stress', 'doctor', 'concurs', 'life', 'anything', 'stressful', 'see', 'float', 'health', 'club', 'hair', 'salon', 'lunch', 'friend', 'restaurant', 'symptoms', 'worsen', 'environmental', 'illness', 'Are', 'allergic', '20th', 'Century', 'flyer', 'Carol', 'unable', 'cope', 'life', 'Wrenwood', 'new', 'age', 'retreat', 'center', 'cleanse', 'body', 'spirit', 'impurities', 'Wrenwood', 'self-righteous', 'philosophy', 'asceticism', 'withdrawl', 'society', 'positive', 'thinking', 'Safe', 'director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'taken', 'profound', 'look', 'disconcerting', 'aspects', 'modern', 'society', 'What', 'perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Carol', 'ill', 'upset', 'never', 'completely', 'control', 'long', 'always', ""'m"", 'fine', 'persona', 'part', 'problem', 'new', 'age', 'center', 'staff', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'parody', 'silliness', 'cultishness', 'similarly', 'subtle', 'listen', 'what', 'preach', 'effects', 'patients', 'everyone', 'always', 'verge', 'tears', 'can', 'see', 'flaws', 'distortions', 'sophisticated', 'plausible', 'enough', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'might', 'fall', 'Safe', 'desire', 'escape', 'forms', 'impurity', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'pathological', 'things', 'culture']",Safe VHS

That was why I decided to watch this movie. I thought that it was about time someone made a movie about the illness, which is a very real and serious disease. So I sat down to watch the film with an open, receptive mind, ready to be dazzled.I could not have been more disappointed. This movie was a steaming heap of garbage. The scriptwriter clearly did not understand the illness...that was glaringly obvious. Just as annoyingly, I don't think he knew how to write a decent movie script. It was slow and annoying, and don't expect to feel any empathy for the characters, even the sick ones. I kept waiting for the main character to wake up to just how insane the health cult she joined was, but she never did. I mean, telling people they were sick because they wanted to be? Please, how stupid would you have to be to believe something like that?This is a real illness, and a serious one. Immune system disorders are on the rise in society. More people are suffering allergy and asthma and diseases of the immune system than ever before. It's a medical fact, and one that needs a lot more attention than it's getting. But I would rather it got no attention at all than to have cruddy movies like this made about it!There is a good reason this movie didn't rake it in at the box office...it's not to do with the fact that it's about an illness; I mean, movies like 'Awakenings' and 'Lorenzo's Oil', not to mention all those movies about people dying of cancer, and the numerous tv shows set in hospitals and medical practices, prove that medical stories are actually box office and tv gold if they're handled in the right way by decent scriptwriters. But this film is just so DULL and idiotic and poorly written and badly filmed...you would have to pay me a LOT of money to sit through watching this again!This movie may have some limited appeal to people who know NOTHING about the disease it's supposed to be about. Voyeurs, the uninformed, posers who like 'alternative' movies no matter how bad they are, and people who like watching freak shows may find an interest in the film.  But for anyone who likes fast paced, well written entertainment, or who wants to learn about the FACTS of this disease and its true and devastating impact on the way its sufferers live, then I would suggest looking elsewhere.If you want to know more about the illness, I suggest watching two exceptional Australian documentaries, 'Canary in the Mine' and 'The Final Insult'.

She's not even a sympathetic character as we watch her, confronting her boredom by shopping and going on fruit diets, disintegrate from a drab, soulless, wife to a sexless hypochondriac who regresses to the infant state, abandoning her family and moving to a ""sanctuary"" where she will find a ""toxic-free, safe environment."" The film succeeds as a satire against happy therapy speak, bovine middle-class self-help cliches, unctuous, self-help charlatans, panacea-promising infomercials, and the kind of needy people who lack the moral fortitude to confront their own weaknesses so instead rely on conspiracy theories and other kinds of scapegoats to explain their repellent personalities, blaming chemicals, for example, for their own ineptness. Carol White and her fellow acoyltes at the ""sanctuary"" are all brain-numbed on the humorless cult of New Age therapy, giving credence to a motivation speaker who lives in a grand mansion overlooking the shack house squalor of his followers. Ironically, Carol White is even more of a prisoner in her new ""safe house"" as she was in her husband's home.

Some of the causitive agents are shown in the movie- magic markers, vehicle exhaust fumes, new houses(with their formaldehyde, glues, paints, carpets, furniture), household cleaners, and fragrances(most colognes contain formaldehyde). Julianne Moore becomes progressively intoxicated(poisoned), as she encounters average manufactured products of the 20th century. This is called the ""spreading factor"" and often a person becomes more and more debilitated by typical daily exposures to many different common things. MCS is difficult to diagnose. There is no cure for this chronic disabling disease, and the sick person must be isolated and avoid contact with the substances. In dear America, especially out West, there are caravans of MCS sufferers traveling in small groups, trying to be as far from civilization as possible-they are on the edge of life, can only be near porcelain and stainless steel. Doctors, dentists, bus drivers, roofers, nurses, artists,etc......New Mexico declared a state of emergency for help for MCS victims.  This is a great movie which shows a life familiar to some. Gulf War veterans validated this illness,(which some doctors still do not understand and pass off as Depression), because thousands returned with MCS acquired from Sarin gas and burning oil fields. Reviewers who think it is about a psychological illness and comparisons to institutionalization- are flat wrong! If you have MCS- I recommend viewing this with family and friends to help educate them about your illness- the bizarre problems of MCS often lead to disbelief and lack of support, because it is not as easy to relate to as Cancer or Diabetes . There is a tremendous proliferation of toxic chemicals in our world, and their effects on living beings have been poorly evaluated.

Todd Haynes' other films -  Poison, and Velvet Goldmine  - are visually striking, and the framing of  Safe reminded me of artwork. This formality however distances us from the  narrative, and seems to highlight the miscasting of Julianne Moore.  Moore's previous supporting roles showed a tartness which was very  appealing. However it is perverse of Haynes to cast her as a bimbo. She may  have the skin for her character but she really isn't believable, and Haynes  strands her in his huge long shots. When she is called upon to give a  speech near the end of the film, it is almost embarassing.

387404,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303900798,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 18]","Safe (Todd Haynes, 1995)Julianne Moore has been around Hollywood for quite a while, but no one really sat up and took notice until she found Todd Haynes. Haynes has gained a good deal of underground cred with his feature debut, 1991's Poison, but the wider world didn't notice him until he hooked up with Julianne Moore, either. The two of them got together and, if this were a Hollywood film, would have made box-office magic with Safe.But this isn't a Hollywood film, and that's not really what happened, though it did get Moore a lot more jobs, and got Haynes wide enough distribution to enable him to make Velvet Goldmine, the film that put him up into, if not the A-list, the top of the B-list. Why didn't Safe make everyone fall to their knees in worship of these two now-recognized giants? Well, simply, because it ain't all that hot.Julianne Moore stars as Carol White, a suburban housewife (and even when Haynes is making a movie set in the present day--well, okay, this is the only one he's done to date that is--it has an oddly 1950s feel to it) whose marriage (to Greg, played by Xander Berkeley, who's been in so many films you've seen him at least once, you just never knew his name before) is of the stable-but-loveless variety, whose relationships with her neighbors is solid but sterile, whose house looks like a model home that no one lives in... you get the idea. Carol White's whole life is a study in sterility. (Those who have seen Far from Heaven should recognize this conceit.) Except, somehow, it's not sterile enough, because for no reason anyone can discern, she starts to develop what was, at the time, the film was made, known as environmental illness. (Think of today's buzzword, Sick Building Syndrome, but on steroids.) Things that she previously had no problem with start making her sick thanks to the arrival of a new couch (not, it should be noted, in the color she ordered, a point of contention at the beginning of the film that becomes an oddly endearing running joke). Greg is confused, but willing to support his wife as she tries to find a cure for the mess she's in. Doctor after doctor fails her, until she finds a retreat in the New Mexico desert run by a snake-oil salesman named Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman, another of those ""you've seen him in lots of stuff in small parts""-type characters).There is so very much here that Haynes could have worked with that goes unexplored. The main conflict, between Greg and Peter, could have been a whole movie in itself, but Haynes never does more than scratch the surface of the depths of Carol's different reactions to her husband (who is real and honest throughout) and Dunning (who tells her what she wants to hear). The scenes at Wrenwood, Dunning's complex, can be seen as having a kind of existential horror to them, but could have been played better. Things ranging from something as subtle as playing with the lighting to more concerted attempts at mind control (it's obvious from what's here that Dunning has himself a cadre of hardcore believers, but he never really does much with the fringe members) would have spun the last half of the movie in a much more sinister light; as it is, it comes off more Saturday the 14th than Friday the 13th. And, of course, the first scene where Moore shows outward signs of sickness, developing a cough that won't go away while driving a car, is arguably the most unintentionally funny scene of Julianne Moore's incredible career. What on EARTH were Moore and Haynes thinking when they made that scene? It certainly couldn't have been ""this is going to be an emotionally powerful sequence that will make the viewer sympathize with Carol,"" since what is does is annoy the viewer and make him want to throw popcorn at the screen thanks to how badly Moore is overacting. (And really, you have to work at it to make a cough sound that fake.)Safe ends up being yet another film where there is much unrealized potential, leading to frustration from the viewers. Still, it's worth seeing for a lot of interesting performances from a lot of people you recognize, but don't know, per se. Just hit the fast forward button every time Moore starts coughing, and you'll be fine. **",2,The feel-bad movie of the year!,1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,4203,"['Safe', 'Todd', 'Haynes', '1995', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'while', 'one', 'really', 'sat', 'up', 'took', 'notice', 'found', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'Haynes', 'gained', 'good', 'deal', 'underground', 'cred', 'feature', 'debut', '1991', 'Poison', 'wider', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'hooked', 'up', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'either', 'two', 'got', 'together', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'box-office', 'magic', 'Safe.But', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'happened', 'did', 'get', 'Moore', 'lot', 'more', 'jobs', 'got', 'Haynes', 'wide', 'enough', 'distribution', 'enable', 'make', 'Velvet', 'Goldmine', 'film', 'put', 'up', 'not', 'A-list', 'top', 'B-list', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Safe', 'make', 'everyone', 'fall', 'knees', 'worship', 'two', 'now-recognized', 'giants', 'Well', 'simply', 'ai', ""n't"", 'hot.Julianne', 'Moore', 'stars', 'Carol', 'White', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'even', 'when', 'Haynes', 'making', 'movie', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'well', 'okay', 'only', 'one', 'done', 'date', 'oddly', '1950s', 'feel', 'marriage', 'Greg', 'played', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'just', 'never', 'knew', 'name', 'stable-but-loveless', 'variety', 'relationships', 'neighbors', 'solid', 'sterile', 'house', 'model', 'home', 'one', 'get', 'idea', 'Carol', 'White', 'whole', 'life', 'study', 'sterility', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'should', 'recognize', 'conceit', 'somehow', 'not', 'sterile', 'enough', 'reason', 'anyone', 'can', 'discern', 'develop', 'what', 'was', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'known', 'environmental', 'illness', 'Think', 'today', 'buzzword', 'Sick', 'Building', 'Syndrome', 'steroids', 'previously', 'had', 'problem', 'start', 'making', 'sick', 'thanks', 'arrival', 'new', 'couch', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'color', 'ordered', 'point', 'contention', 'beginning', 'film', 'oddly', 'endearing', 'running', 'joke', 'Greg', 'confused', 'willing', 'support', 'wife', 'find', 'cure', 'mess', 'Doctor', 'doctor', 'retreat', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'run', 'snake-oil', 'salesman', 'named', 'Peter', 'Dunning', 'Peter', 'Friedman', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'stuff', 'small', 'parts', '-type', 'characters', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'here', 'Haynes', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'unexplored', 'main', 'conflict', 'Greg', 'Peter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'movie', 'Haynes', 'never', 'more', 'scratch', 'surface', 'depths', 'Carol', 'different', 'reactions', 'husband', 'who', 'real', 'honest', 'Dunning', 'who', 'what', 'hear', 'scenes', 'Wrenwood', 'Dunning', 'complex', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'having', 'kind', 'existential', 'horror', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'better', 'Things', 'ranging', 'something', 'as', 'subtle', 'playing', 'lighting', 'more', 'concerted', 'attempts', 'mind', 'control', 'obvious', 'what', 'here', 'Dunning', 'cadre', 'hardcore', 'believers', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'fringe', 'members', 'would', 'have', 'spun', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'light', 'off', 'more', 'Saturday', '14th', 'Friday', '13th', 'course', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'Moore', 'outward', 'signs', 'sickness', 'developing', 'cough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'driving', 'car', 'arguably', 'most', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'scene', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'incredible', 'career', 'What', 'EARTH', 'were', 'Moore', 'Haynes', 'thinking', 'when', 'made', 'scene', 'certainly', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'going', 'be', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'sequence', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'sympathize', 'Carol', 'what', 'annoy', 'viewer', 'make', 'want', 'throw', 'popcorn', 'screen', 'thanks', 'how', 'badly', 'Moore', 'overacting', 'really', 'have', 'work', 'make', 'cough', 'sound', 'fake', 'Safe', 'up', 'being', 'yet', 'film', 'where', 'much', 'unrealized', 'potential', 'leading', 'frustration', 'viewers', 'Still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'lot', 'interesting', 'performances', 'lot', 'people', 'recognize', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'se', 'Just', 'hit', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'time', 'Moore', 'coughing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', '**']",Safe VHS

I've never felt like my job was my indentity, and I guess a crucial part of my belief system is that any one can do any thing at any time as long as they accept that they can.What really struck me about this film is that it's the story of someone who really is lost, even though she is surrounded by all of the trappings that are ""supposed"" to mean that she has a perfect life. Carol White bought into the American dream of the 1980's (...which, sadly enough, is not too far from the current one).To expand on that thought: the average person in this country equates a successful life with having lots of nice ""things"" and lots of free time to do whatever they please. In reality, humans can cope with anything EXCEPT for a lack of things to cope with.Whether or not Carol was really sick is anyones guess... I personally think her lack of stress played a bigger part in her illness then anything else. It also seemed that Carol sensed that if she did take the time to get to know herself, that she would become a completely different person, and that person would conflict with the life that she was living.I found the relationship between her and her husband interesting.

The focus of almost every scene -- unusual for a female role -- she never monopolizes the screen. She even lets the furniture compete with her for attention. She thus captures the dislocation and marginalization of the wraithlike housewife ""Carol"" (or, as she corrects herself to her psychiatrist, ""homemaker""), whose life seems central to nobody, even to herself. Although Xander Berkeley plays her sometimes frustrated husband with immense sensitivity, the sex scene between the two, very close to the beginning of the film, makes the act horrifyingly mechanical and manages to show how even the greatest intimacy can be deeply alienating. At the same time, the film is restrained; its ironies are offered so complexly that one is unsure of the point of view.After Carol becomes seriously ill from exposure to an environment that is increasingly toxic to her, she takes refuge in Wrenwood, a holistic healing camp in the desert. The film remains uncommitted as to what part of Carol's illness is genuinely physical and what part is psychological. The philosophy offered at Wrenwood is also ambiguous, though it remains clear that the sympathy of the film is no more with New Age therapy than it was with the alienating sterility of Carol's lifestyle back in the San Fernando Valley.

Why is her life , so full of material possessions, so empty? Why is everyone at the retreat either crazy or entraced by the charismatic figure who runs the place? Surely there are people affected by this disorder who don't  end up living like the bubble boy. I like Ms. Moore, but she plays this role with a ""deer in the headlights"" look.  I don't understand all the rave reviews, I give this turkey one star.",1,"Visually pleasing, but what a waste!!",1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,749,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'intrigued', 'was', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'was', 'so', 'heavy', 'handed', 'asked', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'giving', 'answers', 'How', 'many', 'shots', 'car', 'exhausts', 'aerosol', 'dispensers', 'director', 'need', 'make', 'point', 'Why', 'everybody', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'compassion', 'Why', 'life', 'full', 'material', 'possessions', 'empty', 'Why', 'everyone', 'retreat', 'crazy', 'entraced', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'who', 'place', 'Surely', 'are', 'people', 'affected', 'disorder', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'living', 'bubble', 'boy', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'role', 'deer', 'headlights', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'rave', 'reviews', 'give', 'turkey', 'one', 'star']",Safe VHS
