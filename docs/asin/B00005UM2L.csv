684410,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B00005UM2L,Best Of All,"[2, 2]","If you are looking for and need special features and clips that are as slick as any music video being produced in 2007, then I'm sorry to say you will be disappointed with The Mothership Connection Live From Houston.For everyone else, what the DVD chronicles is P Funk the way it sounded and was performed each night in the mid-1970s; you just never knew who may show up to make the concert just a bit more funkier. By the end of the show, the opening act - Sly and The Family Stone - along with Bootsy Collins and members of his Rubber Band are in on the funkified jam.Recorded in 1976, it was at a time when concerts weren't being chronicled on a nightly basis for possible future use. I would wager that a member of the stage crew decided to capture the gig on tape and it was gathering dust in a vault somewhere before the audio was enhanced about as well as it could have been for release.What makes this a special gem is the ""rough"" nature of the video. The band and guest performers were not on stage knowingly making a movie; this is a tour date with all the power, energy & surprises that George Clinton delivered each night to the audience. That in itself makes the DVD an important part of any music collection.",5,Uncut Funk,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,1222,"['are', 'looking', 'need', 'special', 'features', 'clips', 'are', 'as', 'slick', 'music', 'video', 'being', 'produced', '2007', 'then', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Mothership', 'Connection', 'Live', 'From', 'Houston.For', 'everyone', 'else', 'what', 'DVD', 'chronicles', 'P', 'Funk', 'way', 'sounded', 'was', 'performed', 'night', 'mid-1970s', 'just', 'never', 'knew', 'who', 'may', 'show', 'up', 'make', 'concert', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'funkier', 'end', 'show', 'opening', 'act', 'Sly', 'Family', 'Stone', 'Bootsy', 'Collins', 'members', 'Rubber', 'Band', 'are', 'funkified', 'jam.Recorded', '1976', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'concerts', 'were', ""n't"", 'being', 'chronicled', 'nightly', 'basis', 'possible', 'future', 'use', 'would', 'wager', 'member', 'stage', 'crew', 'decided', 'capture', 'gig', 'tape', 'was', 'gathering', 'dust', 'vault', 'somewhere', 'audio', 'was', 'enhanced', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'release.What', 'special', 'gem', 'rough', 'nature', 'video', 'band', 'guest', 'performers', 'were', 'not', 'stage', 'knowingly', 'making', 'movie', 'tour', 'date', 'power', 'energy', 'surprises', 'George', 'Clinton', 'delivered', 'night', 'audience', 'DVD', 'important', 'part', 'music', 'collection']",N/A

Folks weren't exactly rushing to document R&B;/funk like they did the rock bands back then. That changed when I saw the recent Parliament Funkadelic documentary One Nation Under a Groove on PBS (hopefully that will be available on DVD soon.) As I was watching Glenn Goins, George Clinton and the Mothership, I thought, wait a minute. Where did the filmmakers get that footage from?? A search on Amazon gave me my answer.I'm thrilled to have this DVD watching a younger (and dare I say sexy) George Clinton and Bernie Worrell. We also get to see members who have since passed on as they perform Cosmic Slop and Gammin on Ya. The DVD, which shows why Clinton is worshipped by performers such as Prince, Dr. Dre and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, should be required viewing for aspiring R&B; singers and bands today as a lesson of true creativity and showmanship.Granted, the video visuals are not the greatest but keep in mind it was filmed in the 70s before the entertainment industry conceived that there would be a home video market. I like to think of it as actually being at a concert where it's dark, people are blocking your view and you can't see everything anyway.

I was surprised by the how good the sound is - at least when compared to the picture, which by no means is above a 3/5 standard. That and the fact that there aren't any special features is reason why this DVD, at almost full price, doesn't deserve five stars. Don't let this scare you, though; it's all well worth watching and listening to - if you're a P-Funk fan this is a must, and if you haven't yet quite figured out what funk is, this DVD gives you the ultimate answer. Here are over 80 minutes of ultra-funky entertainment from P-Funk's hey day, featuring classics like ""Cosmic Slop"", ""Standing on the Verge..."", ""Mothership Connection"", ""Tear the Roof Off..."" et al.The concert was taped in Houston, Texas in 1976. You will experience the landing of the mothership, and just before the encore there's a guest appearance by Bootsy Collins' and Sly Stone's bands.

I can't believe how many people get into P Funk for so long and don't know of this song. I listened to P Funk cd's for years and it wasn't until seeing them at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach that my life was changed with them playing it! It is such a different song live than the studio recording. They nearly caused structural damage to the facility from the extrasensory energies induced from myself and everyone else! They went from Cosmic Slop into a similar grove that resounded of the original Halloween score. The trance was unbreakable and just when I thought humans could not possibly unleash a more powerful reaction an exact likeness of Michael Myers dramatically stalked (walked in the way he did in the movie)onstage. Souls were purged that night.Just watch this concert and you will be so very happy afterward.
