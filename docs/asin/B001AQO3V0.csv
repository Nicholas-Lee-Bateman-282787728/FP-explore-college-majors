1166935,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B001AQO3V0,Brian Maitland,"[1, 2]","Whereas last season we had the whole Medellin buildup and fiasco this season really doesn't have the drama (and I'm not talking ""Johnny""). It's kind of an interesting poke at Vince (Adrian Grenier) being criticized for beinga bad actor because, basically, he is in his actual life (let's get real, the guy better save all the money he makes from ""Entourage"" as he's not getting big roles in TV and Movies after this). The whole premise of ""Entourage"" that this guy is a star is laughable. It's the other three guys, especially Johnny Drama and Turtle, that have the funnier and more interesting encounters. Plus I find their roles much more believable than actually believing Vince is a movie star.Given that the Ari Gold storyline develops way better and that's hopefully the direction of the show when it heads into the 6th season.The celebrity cameos are pretty lame despite a very sexy Jamie Lynn Sigler and a gratuitous Martin Scorcese. I mean, are we supposed to take seriously that B movie actor Jason Patric (I dare you to find a single person who would specifically go out of the way to see his movies let alone pick him out of a lineup) is supposed to be a great star to rival Vince. Then again maybe ""Entourage"" is a parody with its tongue firmly in cheek.The extras are lamer than lame this time around. Like all previous season DVDs, you get the season-by-season recaps, commentary tracks and, with this one, they throw in a short section on the celebs they got for season 5. Frankly, who cares at this point?Why not bag the guys and find a new up-and-coming fake star and his entourage for Ari Gold to take to the top. In fact, I liked the whole Bow Wow (the hip hop ""star"") turn as a comic actor being represented by E. That showed potential as Bow Wow (I'm supposed to take a musical artist seriously when they name themselves after the sound of a dog?) can actually act. I have no idea if he can sing as my musical tastes run more Raveonettes than mainstream hip hop pop.",3,is it over yet?,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,1988,"['last', 'season', 'had', 'whole', 'Medellin', 'buildup', 'fiasco', 'season', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'drama', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Johnny', 'kind', 'interesting', 'poke', 'Vince', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'being', 'criticized', 'beinga', 'bad', 'actor', 'basically', 'actual', 'life', 'let', 'get', 'real', 'guy', 'better', 'save', 'money', 'Entourage', 'not', 'getting', 'big', 'roles', 'TV', 'Movies', 'whole', 'premise', 'Entourage', 'guy', 'star', 'laughable', 'other', 'three', 'guys', 'especially', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'Turtle', 'have', 'funnier', 'more', 'interesting', 'encounters', 'find', 'roles', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'actually', 'believing', 'Vince', 'movie', 'star.Given', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'storyline', 'way', 'better', 'hopefully', 'direction', 'show', 'when', '6th', 'season.The', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'very', 'sexy', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Sigler', 'gratuitous', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'mean', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'seriously', 'B', 'movie', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'dare', 'find', 'single', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'specifically', 'go', 'way', 'see', 'movies', 'let', 'alone', 'pick', 'lineup', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'star', 'rival', 'Vince', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'Entourage', 'parody', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek.The', 'extras', 'are', 'lamer', 'lame', 'time', 'around', 'previous', 'season', 'DVDs', 'get', 'season-by-season', 'recaps', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'throw', 'short', 'section', 'celebs', 'got', 'season', '5', 'Frankly', 'who', 'point', 'Why', 'not', 'bag', 'guys', 'find', 'new', 'up-and-coming', 'fake', 'star', 'entourage', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'take', 'top', 'fact', 'liked', 'whole', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'hip', 'hop', 'star', 'turn', 'comic', 'actor', 'being', 'represented', 'E.', 'showed', 'potential', 'Bow', 'Wow', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'take', 'musical', 'artist', 'seriously', 'when', 'name', 'sound', 'dog', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'have', 'idea', 'can', 'sing', 'musical', 'tastes', 'run', 'more', 'Raveonettes', 'mainstream', 'hip', 'hop', 'pop']",Entourage: Season 5

And Turtle has at least one remarkable surprise in this season.Each episode takes a turn here and a turn there, keeping the viewer guessing.  The story writers have put a real edge into this season and the characters are really tuned into their stories within the story.

I can't wait to see the rest of the season and am sure that I will swell with sadness when it ends (unless I still have my Real Time and Big Love, then all will be OK). I thought all the characters were great and the pacing of the show couldn't be better. I loved how everyone seemed to be right back at it and the fun voyeuristic view of Hollywood is as enjoyable as it has ever been.That said, what is the problem with the writers and how they deal with women? Are women seriously relegated to be sex objects on a fantasy island or pornography pixels watched instantly in the car (with friends who seem to care little)? As far as I am concerned, this is the aspect of the show that I don't buy. I have two sisters living in Hollywood and they are very strong women. They don't simply giggle and mess around with any movie star related person they run across, I doubt many women actually do.In addition to the borderline misogyny that takes place on the show, I want to be able to watch it with my wife without being worried about the next possible silicone waif that will suddenly appear topless on top of Vinnie's groin. Call me a puritan if you must, but I think the nudity on HBO has been done in much less ""Showtime-y"" ways in the past (think Sopranos). If this is HBO's way of trying to catch up to the risque material on Showtime, think again, you will always have the upper hand as long as you stick to what you have been doing (Six Feet Under, Deadwood, the list goes on and on and on).",4,Love this show!

While I thought the second season of Entourage which focused on a tremendous career setback for Ari Gold was the best, this season was excellent on its own right because it finally starts to show the unraveling and human side of Vincent Chase. Chase has been allowed to remain an aloof enigma for most of the series. It seemed that he didn't care about money, power and any of the other benefits of being a celebrity. He alienated producers, directors, agents and fellow stars on a whim seemingly without there being any negative ramifications to him. In Season 5, the crows have started to circle around Chase and his place amongst the Hollywood up-and-coming stars is questioned. Does Chase have the drive to succeed or was he just a pretty-boy whose had some lucky breaks? Is his presumption that money will continue to flow in as long as he keeps a detached but positive demeanor still valid? What will happen to his relationships with his agent, Ari and publicist, Shauna as his star starts to dim? And most importantly, will the end of the series be Vincent Chase resigned to the same fate as his older brother, Johnny Drama --- an actor who could have been a star but whose idiosyncracies and arrogance derailed him? In essence, I like Season 5 because, as funny and cool as it was, it reminds us subtly that Hollywood is just as much a rat race city as any other place; there's just better scenery.",4,Closing in on the Finale,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,1500,"['funny', 'thing', 'HBO', 'series', 'seem', 'get', 'incrementally', 'better', 'time', 'thought', 'second', 'season', 'Entourage', 'focused', 'tremendous', 'career', 'setback', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'was', 'best', 'season', 'was', 'excellent', 'own', 'right', 'finally', 'show', 'unraveling', 'human', 'side', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'Chase', 'been', 'allowed', 'remain', 'aloof', 'enigma', 'most', 'series', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'money', 'power', 'other', 'benefits', 'being', 'celebrity', 'alienated', 'producers', 'directors', 'agents', 'fellow', 'stars', 'whim', 'seemingly', 'there', 'being', 'negative', 'ramifications', 'Season', '5', 'crows', 'have', 'started', 'circle', 'Chase', 'place', 'Hollywood', 'up-and-coming', 'stars', 'questioned', 'Does', 'Chase', 'have', 'drive', 'succeed', 'was', 'just', 'pretty-boy', 'had', 'lucky', 'breaks', 'presumption', 'money', 'will', 'continue', 'flow', 'as', 'long', 'detached', 'positive', 'demeanor', 'still', 'valid', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'relationships', 'agent', 'Ari', 'publicist', 'Shauna', 'star', 'dim', 'most', 'importantly', 'will', 'end', 'series', 'be', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'resigned', 'same', 'fate', 'older', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'star', 'idiosyncracies', 'arrogance', 'derailed', 'essence', 'like', 'Season', '5', 'because', 'funny', 'cool', 'was', 'subtly', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'rat', 'race', 'city', 'other', 'place', 'just', 'better', 'scenery']",Entourage: Season 5

There are not quite as many story lines in this season, with Vince trying to make a comeback being the overall theme. There are a few subplots, but they aren't as interesting as seasons in the past.

The dramatic parts, as well as Vince and Eric in general, do little to get me going. But Dillon and Piven remain very sharp, quick, and hilarious, so once again I'd have to say this is worth watching purely for them.Dillon deserves more credit than he gets for his work here.

1166952,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B001AQO3V0,The JuRK,"[1, 1]","I really have to wonder how much of this show feeds off the ""reality"" of Hollywood.  Ideas for storylines (I think I overhead a commentary about basing Vincent driving around to see lines for AQUAMAN on Tobey Maguire driving around to see lines for SPIDERMAN), guest appearances lampooning real stars--the fact that Jamie Lynn Singler is actually dating the actor who plays Turtle who's dating Jamie Lynn Singler is perhaps the bizarrest moment in all of this!You laugh at a scene and wonder: did they base this on someone real?  Who was that difficult German director?  Are all studio heads this vindictive?I liked this season because Vincent Chase is finally being challenged by the very business that's handed him the world.  It's all been so easy up to now.  Whether making millions of dollars or losing millions of dollars, Vincent has always just shrugged his shoulders, ready to go back to New York City when the party ends.  ENTOURAGE is smart enough to know that was never the real option behind this superstar.  It's good to see some ambition with him.But the person I really watch this show for is Jeremy Piven's Ari Gold.  He's been my clear favorite for all five seasons.  And for all his obscene bluster and crazy energy...he's really a decent guy.  He looks out for his family, he works hard for his clients.  Even at war, he's difficult to hate when he's not on your side.  As long as they don't soften him too much, I'll always come back to see more of Ari's antics.",5,Still Got It Going On,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,1483,"['really', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'show', 'reality', 'Hollywood', 'Ideas', 'storylines', 'think', 'overhead', 'commentary', 'basing', 'Vincent', 'driving', 'around', 'see', 'lines', 'AQUAMAN', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'driving', 'around', 'see', 'lines', 'SPIDERMAN', 'guest', 'appearances', 'lampooning', 'real', 'stars', 'fact', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Singler', 'actually', 'dating', 'actor', 'who', 'Turtle', 'who', 'dating', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Singler', 'perhaps', 'bizarrest', 'moment', 'laugh', 'scene', 'wonder', 'did', 'base', 'someone', 'real', 'Who', 'was', 'difficult', 'German', 'director', 'Are', 'studio', 'heads', 'vindictive', 'liked', 'season', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'finally', 'being', 'challenged', 'very', 'business', 'handed', 'world', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'now', 'making', 'millions', 'dollars', 'losing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Vincent', 'always', 'just', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', 'ready', 'go', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'when', 'party', 'ENTOURAGE', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'was', 'never', 'real', 'option', 'superstar', 'good', 'see', 'ambition', 'person', 'really', 'watch', 'show', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'been', 'clear', 'favorite', 'five', 'seasons', 'obscene', 'bluster', 'crazy', 'energy', 'really', 'decent', 'guy', 'out', 'family', 'hard', 'clients', 'Even', 'war', 'difficult', 'hate', 'when', 'not', 'side', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'soften', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'always', 'come', 'back', 'see', 'more', 'Ari', 'antics']",Entourage: Season 5

ENTOURAGE: SEASON 4 ended on a big downer as Vince&#8217;s (Adrian Grenier) dream project that he starred in and co-produced, MEDELLIN, bombed at Cannes. ENTOURAGE: SEASON 5 picks up several months later. Vince has literally been living on a beach in Mexico drowning his failure in alcohol and women. Ari (Jeremy Piven), Eric (Kevin Connolly), and Drama (Kevin Dillon) travel to Vince&#8217;s hideaway to convince him it&#8217;s time to get back to work. Vince was a man who was at the top of his game before the failure of MEDELLIN, has to scrape and scrap before he can even get back in the game. Prior to the finale of Season 4, ENTOURAGE had always been a show about a highly successful film star that never had anything more than superficial problems. Personally, I found Season 5 to be the most interesting season so far because Vince is no longer the mega-star he once was and there&#8217;s no guarantee that he will ever get his former glory back.Season 5 is filled with tons of guest stars, including Frank Darabont and Jason Patric. However, one of the most interesting ones is Jamie Lynn-Sigler (THE SOPRANOS) who ends up dating Turtle. Mark Wahlberg also returns to the series playing himself in a game of golf against his former agent Ari.The episodes in ENTOURAGE: SEASON 5 are:1. &#8220;Fantasy Island&#8221; &#8211; Months after the debacle at Cannes, MEDELLIN is now a straight-to-DVD release. Ari, Eric, and Drama travel to Mexico to convince Vince it&#8217;s time to come back and get back to work. Drama is still in love with Jacqueline, the girl he met at Cannes.2. &#8220;Unlike a Virgin&#8221; &#8211; Vince has an encounter with one of his former girlfriends, Justine Chapin (Leighton Meester) that leads to a serious realization by Vince. Eric tries to represent two independent film writers. Drama&#8217;s relationship with Jacqueline ends badly.3. &#8220;The All Out Fall Out&#8221; &#8211; Vince agrees to appear at a sweet sixteen party to avoid bankruptcy. Drama gets drunk.4. &#8220;Fire Sale&#8221; &#8211; Ari is interested in the indie script Eric is trying to sell. Drama appears on THE VIEW.5. &#8220;Tree Trippers&#8221; &#8211; Vince is offered a part in BENJI for $3 million. Vince, Drama, Turtle, Eric, and Ari head out to Joshua Tree National Park to trip on some mushrooms with Eric Roberts. Lloyd is supposed to watch Ari&#8217;s house while Mrs. Ari and the kids are gone, but ends up throwing a gay party.6. &#8220;ReDOMption&#8221; &#8211; Ari plays a game of golf in an attempt to get a role for Vince. Dom finds himself in jail and asks Vince for bail, but only Eric is able to afford it. Turtle agrees to be Drama&#8217;s personal assistant.7. &#8220;Gotta Look Up to Get Down&#8221; &#8211; Vince does a photo shoot for Dolce & Gabbana. Ari attends a funeral and is offered the chance to head the movie studio at Warner Bros.8. &#8220;First Class Jerk&#8221; &#8211; Turtle sits next to Jamie-Lynn Sigler aboard on a first class plane trip. Ari tries to get a woman he likes put in charge of Warner Bros. Josh Weinstein gets Vince a meeting with Frank Darabont.9. &#8220;Pie&#8221; &#8211; Vince has some of his lines stolen in SMOKEJUMPERS by Jason Patric. Ari has lunch with an old friend, Andrew Klein.10. &#8220;Seth Green Day&#8221; &#8211; Eric&#8217;s client Charlie gets his pilot script picked up by the network, but the studio wants to cast Seth Green. The director of SMOKEJUMPERS continues to torture Vince. Ari and Lloyd give Andrew Klein a Hollywood makeover to impress Babs.11. &#8220;Play&#8217;n with Fire&#8221; &#8211; Vince is fired from SMOKEJUMPERS and the studio ends up shutting the movie down. Turtle gets an unexpected call from Jamie-Lynn.12. &#8220;Return to Queens Blvd.&#8221; &#8211; with SMOKEJUMPERS cancelled, Vince and the boys return home to Queens. Eric tries to get Gus Van Sant to cast Vince in his next movie, but Van Sant won&#8217;t even let Vince audition. Eric and Vince get in a fight and Vince fires Eric. Meanwhile, Eric&#8217;s work for Vince didn&#8217;t go unnoticed as Van Sant comes to like Vince&#8217;s work and suggests him for a feature role to a friend of his.ENTOURAGE tends to get better as it progresses and Season 5 picks up some of the steam that was lost during Season 4.

It seems a bit forced, as if they tried to wrap up quickly too many loose ends. In addition they tried to shove into one episode enough plot developments to last for several 'normal' episodes, and it's not convincing, specially the big twist at the end which I will not reveal here. Also, I'm sorry to say that Adrian Garnier is not as a great an actor as Vince Chase is supposed to be. As long as all he had to do was to be handsome, smile and be optimistic, everything was OK. But once things get rough and he has to do play a character in real distress, his limitations are showing. Anyway as a loyal fan, I really hope that season 6 will be much better again.",4,Forced ending,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,742,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'bit', 'forced', 'tried', 'wrap', 'up', 'quickly', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'addition', 'tried', 'shove', 'one', 'episode', 'enough', 'plot', 'developments', 'last', 'several', ""'normal"", 'episodes', 'not', 'convincing', 'specially', 'big', 'twist', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'here', 'Also', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'Adrian', 'Garnier', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'Vince', 'Chase', 'supposed', 'be', 'As', 'long', 'all', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'be', 'handsome', 'smile', 'be', 'optimistic', 'everything', 'was', 'OK', 'once', 'things', 'get', 'rough', 'do', 'play', 'character', 'real', 'distress', 'limitations', 'are', 'showing', 'Anyway', 'loyal', 'fan', 'really', 'hope', 'season', '6', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'again']",Entourage: Season 5
