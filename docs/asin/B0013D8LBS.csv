His wife ('Grace') has been killed serving in Iraq, but he's too overwhelmed himself to bring himself to tell his two young daughters about it. So instead he decides to take them on a road trip to Disneyland (or the generic movie-equivalent). Surprisingly non-political, other than the fact that it helps bring home the message that behind every fleeting headline of war casualties, there are hundreds of lives that are devastated and forever changed.I always have a tough time finding movies to watch on planes, given the violence and/or sexual content of so many adult films. I thought this would be a safe one to watch (and it was).

1140973,A9K1DSRZ4RF1V,B0013D8LBS,"Allan Inouye ""a well wisher""","[4, 6]","I enjoyed this movie.  Cusack was excellent.  The two girls were superb.  Chemistry between the leads was believable, though the brother comes across as an aging hippie stereotype.My own wife died two years ago after battling cancer for nine years.  My son is 21 and in an ROTC program, due to graduate in two years.  The subject matter, therefore, got my attention.The ""Hollywood"" aspects to this movie are plentiful:  if Cusack simply told the girls their mother had died, that would have ended the movie or sent it in an entirely different direction.  Since he does not tell them, we go on a voyage of discovery, which allows the scenery and certain Hollywood ""moments"" to take up the time. There are some hard-to-believe scenes, as when the older daughter calls her school for a homework assignment and interprets the secretary's sympathies as ""being really nice.""The reality, for me at least, was different.  The last thing I wanted to do was ""go on the road.""  I wanted the routine to keep me from diffusing into the atmosphere.  The solidity of my house, my job, the presence of my son, the dog and three cats she had left behind, doing the laundry, cleaning the litter:  this kept me grounded.  Both of us were believers, and we had found especially in the last months together that our Lord can take us through some unbelievable times without letting us fall. There is a cliche that if you haven't been there, you can't understand.  I think this is true.So in a way I did take a trip, but it was spiritual rather than scenic.  But this isn't good stuff for a movie, at least not this type of movie.  It was a good movie with good acting and a beautiful musical score (by Clint Eastwood).  But for me it was Hollywood--good Hollywood--but I didn't feel the resonance, the connection that anyone involved had been through this experience.",4,"Good movie, but only a movie",1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,1845,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'Cusack', 'was', 'excellent', 'two', 'girls', 'were', 'superb', 'Chemistry', 'leads', 'was', 'believable', 'brother', 'across', 'aging', 'hippie', 'stereotype.My', 'own', 'wife', 'died', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'battling', 'cancer', 'nine', 'years', 'son', '21', 'ROTC', 'program', 'due', 'graduate', 'two', 'years', 'subject', 'matter', 'therefore', 'got', 'attention.The', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'are', 'plentiful', 'Cusack', 'simply', 'told', 'girls', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'movie', 'sent', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'not', 'tell', 'go', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'scenery', 'certain', 'Hollywood', 'moments', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'are', 'hard-to-believe', 'scenes', 'when', 'older', 'daughter', 'school', 'homework', 'assignment', 'secretary', 'sympathies', 'being', 'really', 'nice', 'reality', 'least', 'was', 'different', 'last', 'thing', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'go', 'road', 'wanted', 'routine', 'keep', 'diffusing', 'atmosphere', 'solidity', 'house', 'job', 'presence', 'son', 'dog', 'three', 'cats', 'had', 'left', 'behind', 'doing', 'laundry', 'cleaning', 'litter', 'kept', 'grounded', 'were', 'believers', 'had', 'found', 'especially', 'last', 'months', 'together', 'Lord', 'can', 'take', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'letting', 'fall', 'cliche', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'think', 'true.So', 'way', 'did', 'take', 'trip', 'was', 'spiritual', 'rather', 'scenic', ""n't"", 'good', 'stuff', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'resonance', 'connection', 'anyone', 'involved', 'had', 'been', 'experience']",Grace Is Gone

John Cusak plays a frumpy, bespectled superstore manager who loses his soldier wife in the Iraq War and can't accept her death. He takes his two young daughters on a road trip to an amusement park, temporarily trying to escape from the horror of reality. Cusak can't bring himself to tell his daughters that their mother is dead, he is so in denial.What I like about the movie is that it shows what the families of the fallen soldiers of the Iraq conflict go through, their pain and suffering. Whenever a soldier dies, everyone who loved him or her is deeply affected, too.Cusak gives one of his most subtle and touching performances of his career and has great chemistry with the actresses who play his daughters, especially Shelan O'Keefe.

1140975,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013D8LBS,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I've been anticipating this movie since, well, early 2007 when John Cusack was rumored to be heading for an Oscar nomination.  I have never really been a huge Cusack fan (at least not John, for I have always adored his sister Joan) but there was something about the plot and concept of this film that just really spoke to me.  I love these somber character studies, and grief is one of the most emotionally connective ways to study someone's character.Conceptually, `Grace is Gone' has promise, but the way in which the film is constructed turns that promise in an empty gesture.The film revolves around Stanley Phillips, a former soldier who, because of poor eyesight, has been reduced to department store manager.  While his wife is overseas, fighting the war he wishes he could fight, Stanley raises their two daughters, Heidi and Dawn.  When word comes that Grace, his wife, has died, Stanley struggles with his own feelings as well as when and how to tell his daughters.  Instead of just `telling' them, Stanley decides to take them on a trip, driving from Minnesota to Florida to visit a theme park.For me, and I know I'm in the minority here, the film feels very bland.  It comes across like a `made for television' movie, very middle of the road and amateurish.  The performances are all decent, but nothing truly admirable (except Alessandro Nivola, who has a small but important part, and he plays it flawlessly).  John Cusack's approach to grief is very one-note.  He just looks grumpy throughout the entire film.  In fact, the films conclusion is the only part to remotely works for me, for it shows a father actually being a father.  Yes, I understand that grief is a very tumultuous thing, and it affects people differently; I just wish that Cusack had found the layers within his character.  It is preposterous to conclude that his daughters wouldn't figure out what was going on; I mean, their father doesn't even shower.  It was an overstated depiction of grief to me.  I have seen people shut down when a loved one dies, but when you have children you can't really `shut down' to the extent that Stanley does.It feels like a performance, not something genuine.  Watch Tom Wilkinson in `In the Bedroom' for an accurate and stunning portrayal of grief.The other aspect of the film that I found rather distracting was the way it couldn't clearly decide what film it wanted to be.  It fluctuated between a film about grief to a film about war, and I think that the political stand it was trying to make actually took away from the film.  It is a part of Stanley that needed to be expressed in order to flesh out his character, and so I respect that decision, but they needed more time to make it feel more than just a random expression.  The film is barely over an hour in length and so it almost feels simplistic, never really `going there' as it needed to in order to make either of the films two primary topics connect with the viewer.I've read some complaints (not here necessarily) about the way in which the climax is delivered to the audience.  Personally, the films conclusion is the best part of the film.  The way the dialog is stripped during the theme park scene (and another pertinent scene) and the facial expressions (happy or sad) are allowed to do all the talking for us was truly inspired and beautifully tailored to elicit our deepest emotional sympathies.  Yes, I broke down in tears at the final scene (which did feel more manipulated than anything else) but one small speckle of brilliance (I don't consider the manipulated emotions brilliance, but the two scenes leading up to it are) doesn't make the film worth watching.  There are far better films that tackle this subject (`In the Bedroom' for one) and so I'd recommend you watch one of those.",2,A one-note expression of grief that never seems to register...,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,3784,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'anticipating', 'movie', 'well', 'early', '2007', 'when', 'John', 'Cusack', 'was', 'rumored', 'be', 'heading', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'huge', 'Cusack', 'fan', 'least', 'not', 'John', 'have', 'always', 'adored', 'sister', 'Joan', 'was', 'something', 'plot', 'concept', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'spoke', 'love', 'somber', 'character', 'studies', 'grief', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'connective', 'ways', 'study', 'someone', 'character.Conceptually', 'Grace', 'Gone', 'promise', 'way', 'film', 'constructed', 'turns', 'promise', 'empty', 'gesture.The', 'film', 'Stanley', 'Phillips', 'former', 'soldier', 'who', 'poor', 'eyesight', 'been', 'reduced', 'department', 'store', 'manager', 'wife', 'overseas', 'fighting', 'war', 'could', 'fight', 'Stanley', 'two', 'daughters', 'Heidi', 'Dawn', 'When', 'word', 'Grace', 'wife', 'died', 'Stanley', 'own', 'feelings', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'how', 'tell', 'daughters', 'Instead', 'just', 'telling', 'Stanley', 'take', 'trip', 'driving', 'Minnesota', 'Florida', 'visit', 'theme', 'park.For', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'very', 'bland', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'very', 'middle', 'road', 'amateurish', 'performances', 'are', 'decent', 'nothing', 'truly', 'admirable', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'who', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'flawlessly', 'John', 'Cusack', 'approach', 'grief', 'very', 'one-note', 'just', 'grumpy', 'entire', 'film', 'fact', 'films', 'conclusion', 'only', 'part', 'remotely', 'works', 'father', 'actually', 'being', 'father', 'Yes', 'understand', 'grief', 'very', 'tumultuous', 'thing', 'people', 'differently', 'just', 'wish', 'Cusack', 'had', 'found', 'layers', 'character', 'preposterous', 'conclude', 'daughters', 'would', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'mean', 'father', ""n't"", 'even', 'shower', 'was', 'overstated', 'depiction', 'grief', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'shut', 'down', 'when', 'loved', 'one', 'dies', 'when', 'have', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'shut', 'down', 'extent', 'Stanley', 'does.It', 'feels', 'performance', 'not', 'something', 'genuine', 'Watch', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bedroom', 'accurate', 'stunning', 'portrayal', 'grief.The', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'found', 'rather', 'distracting', 'was', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'decide', 'what', 'film', 'wanted', 'be', 'fluctuated', 'film', 'grief', 'film', 'war', 'think', 'political', 'stand', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'actually', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'part', 'Stanley', 'needed', 'be', 'expressed', 'order', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'so', 'respect', 'decision', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'just', 'random', 'expression', 'film', 'barely', 'hour', 'length', 'almost', 'feels', 'simplistic', 'never', 'really', 'going', 'there', 'needed', 'order', 'make', 'films', 'two', 'primary', 'topics', 'connect', 'viewer.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'complaints', 'not', 'here', 'necessarily', 'way', 'climax', 'delivered', 'audience', 'Personally', 'films', 'conclusion', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'way', 'dialog', 'stripped', 'theme', 'park', 'scene', 'pertinent', 'scene', 'facial', 'expressions', 'happy', 'sad', 'are', 'allowed', 'do', 'talking', 'was', 'truly', 'inspired', 'beautifully', 'tailored', 'elicit', 'deepest', 'emotional', 'sympathies', 'Yes', 'broke', 'down', 'tears', 'final', 'scene', 'did', 'feel', 'more', 'manipulated', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'small', 'speckle', 'brilliance', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'manipulated', 'emotions', 'brilliance', 'two', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'are', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'tackle', 'subject', 'Bedroom', 'one', 'so', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watch', 'one']",Grace Is Gone

What we saw as a man-boy who hadn't grown up enough to be a father to two daughters with a strong wife, much less going through the grieving of a loss of their mother.  One of the main characteristics of an immature person is that they try to avoid facing their problems rather than dealing with them.  Stanley, the father, clearly wasn't mature enough to cope with his loss himself, much less guide two young daughters through theirs.  By the time Stanley got up the courage -- no, by the time he couldn't avoid facing the truth any longer because Heidi was clearly figuring things out and even starting to act out -- we could not have much empathy with Stanley at all.  We could feel for the girls, however, to have to face several days of constant lying by their father on top of learning to deal with the death of their mother.If you think a movie about the death of a parent should be about how the other parent does everything he can think of to avoid telling the truth to his kids, then this movie might be for you.  On the other hand, if you think such a movie might give a child you know who has lost a parent unexpectedly some hope for their own future, forget this movie.

It is something of a surprising role for John Cusack who started his career with low-brow comedies (Better Off DeadandOne Crazy Summer). But this independent gem shows that Cusack has the wherewithal to spot a solid, dramatic part and run with it. Although Cusack has done some off-and-on stand-up work, things likeThe Ice HarvestandPushing Tinwere a bit thin on character. But not so here.And, even more surprising, the film brings two unknowns to play alongside Cusack. The two are also very young girls who show that Dakota Fanning (Charlotte's Web) isn't the only young gal who can act her heart out. Sh&eacute;lan O'Keefe stars as Heidi Phillips, Stanley Phillips' (Cusack's) eldest daughter and does so with astonishing ...um ...grace. Trying to find her way into adolescence while watching her father implode is quite nicely portrayed. Her first attempts at smoking and her nighttime wanderings are something many parents will be able to identify with.Stanley's younger daughter Dawn is played by newcomer Gracie Bednarczyk, and her portions where she's jousting with her older sister are spot on. Not understanding what's happening to their family is significant in that someone of her age truly wouldn't know. But the suspicions of her elder sister set her on edge ...just a tad.Grace is Gone is a very good war film. And by war I mean a film that focuses on its impact on the home-front. When Stanley (Cusack) learns of his wife's death in Iraq, it takes some mental juggling for him to come to terms with what that means for him and his two young daughters. This is the crux of the story. When Stanley can't release the information to his kids, he hides it by taking them to a fun theme park many miles away. It seems he wants his kids to have fun before breaking the worst news of their lives to them ...and, in a sense, re-breaking it to himself. Stanley loses sight of what he needs to do, and even becomes a bit delusional (he calls his own home to tell his dead-wife that he and the kids are okay, etc.).The gut-wrenching scene when Stanley MUST tell the kids what happened to their mother is one of the hardest things any parent will ever have to watch. The musical score comes up over the voice of Stanley and we don't get to hear everything he says, which we don't need to; we can see it on the childrens' faces. A truly powerful moment that will linger with you for many days, if not weeks.It is noteworthy to mention how topical this film is since the war in Iraq seems far from over. Men and women continue to die ""over there"" and when that might end is anyone's guess. But one thing is for certain, the traumas felt ""over there"" definitely ripple ""over to here"".

Is he just avoiding the inevitable, or will their time together somehow ease the pain to come teach them to appreciate what they still have, each other?Critique: John Cusack proves once again that there isn't any role he cannot excel in and the thoughtful, reserved Shelan O'Keefe along with the irrepressible Gracie Bednarcyk are the perfect compliement for this little family unit adrift in a sea of pending grief. This is definitely a mood movie, so if you're not in the mood for a slowly unfolding, somber journey of finding center and re-connect with life this isn't the film for you.

Dad finds out and the viewer knows that he will tell his daughters sometime. Nothing terribly complex here.A simple movie, not at all. This is a three character movie, a dad and his two daughters. The chemistry between these three characters is incredible. John Cusack is remarkable as a good average person, a father. Slightly overweight, he mastered the walk, the gestures, the facial expressions. Sh&eacute;lan O'Keefe, the oldest daughter Heidi is phenomenal. Her voice, her facial expressions, timing - perfection. Gracie Bednarczyk as the youngest daughter Dawn, brings in a wonderful performance. These three feel like a real family, they are totally believable. The viewer also feels like they know the mother, although she is never shown.There are a few moments where pacing isn't prefect, especially about half way through the film. Some odd wide angle close ups. The film could use about 10 minutes of trimming. James Strouse, the director and author, has captured the anonymity of the midwest. No city or town is recognizable, but it's all very familiar.Bonus features are slim, but worth the watch. There is a fantastic piece about how Grace was developed. The director talks about why he made this film, and it really enriches the whole experience. Normally these pieces of fluff are so poorly done simply retelling the story you've just watched. The cast weighs in and have intelligent things to say about the film.Rated PG-13, due to a really stupid useless piece during a group discussion where a woman talks about an intimate conversation on the phone with her husband in Iraq. It saddens me because this scene does nothing for the movie, and could be easily cut. The rest of the film deals in an appropriate manner with the death of a parent, and how those left behind cope. I would really call this a sad, but family appropriate movie.And for those trivia fans out there, Clint Eastwood wrote some of the music. His son Wayne performed on a few pieces. This was also not filmed anywhere near Minnesota, but the Chicago area, John Cusack's home town.

Yes, it does grapple with the grief of a husband and father (played by John Cusack) whose wife, a member of the US Armed Forces, has been killed in Iraq. He does not know how to tell his two young daughters that their mother, Grace, is gone, and decides instead to pluck them out of school and go on a road trip to a Disneyworld type of park. Up to now he has been a detached sort of man, mechanically going to work each day as the manager of a home improvement store, having previously served in the military, until being discharged due to poor eyesite. An unquestioning sense of patriotism seems to have provided much of the underpinning for his life.It is during this odyssey with his two girls, that the underpinning, tenets, and paradigms,  begin to peel away. Cusack does this, using everyday scenes from America as the backdrop. Motel lobbies, big box stores, fast food restaurants,and service station convenience stores take on an eery hollowness, as he and his pre-teen daughter face the questions whether the Iraq war is worth fighting. In the end, on a beach, with both daughters at his side, he gently tells them the truth about Grace's death. However, one comes away feeling that he is now alive for the first time. His love for his girls and wife transcends all the other stuff, the hollowness, the corporate pep talks, the Army support groups, the patriotic patter, the drive-thru answers.This remarkable film draws back the curtain and reveals a much darker landscape of America.

Grace is Gone stars John Cusack, Shelan O'Keefe, and Gracie Bednarczyk. As the film opens, we are introduced to Stanley Phillips (Cusack), a middle-aged man who is keeping the home fires burning with his two daughters while his wife, Grace, fights as a U.S. soldier in Iraq.One morning after the girls have left for school, two uniformed officers knock on Stanley's door and inform him that his wife has been killed in action. Stanley is lost. Rather than tell Heidi (the eldest, played with precision by O'Keefe) and Dawn (a bubbly and sweet Bednarczyk) the horrible news when they arrive home from school that day, he decides to take them on a road trip to Enchanted Gardens, an amusement park in Florida. During the rest of the film, we follow Stanley and his two daughters as they navigate their way together and eventually connect.Performances are what make this film. I thought Cusack, as always, was wonderful. He has an everyman quality in Grace is Gone that I really liked. Bednarczyk as Dawn was so peppy and natural, and she served as a wonderful foil to the darkness of the film. But the breakout star here is O'Keefe. Her quiet ways. Her unaffected mannerisms. The way she'd pull her small little mouth up. She did an amazing job as an actor. For such a young actor, her performance was nearly a miracle. I'm sorely disappointed that she hasn't put out another film since Grace is Gone (which was released in 2007), but I can totally see that she might want to go to high school and have a real life.This film is really all about how this father finds his way with his children.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[3, 3]","Writer-Director  James C Strouse has put together a seemingly simple film about grief, and how it affects individuals differently. I don't think I'll be giving away too much by saying that Grace is a soldier who is killed in action, and Stanley (Cusack) is the husband who doesn't know how to break the news to his 2 young daughters. He hasn't been the most attentive father, and, faced with raising them without a mother frightens him. He also has a gnawing guilt complex because he was kept out of the military because of his eyesight. He asks his girls what they want to do, and they settle on a road trip to Florida (from Minnesota) to a popular theme park. One reviewer thought this an irreponsible action, but his kids have loads of fun before he finally breaks the news. How much fun would they've had with this knowledge before-hand? The film is not preachy about war; rather, a close-up of an individual who must make decisions about his family. The performances are excellent all around. John Cusack is so in control, a new depth of insight, that belies his reputation as the wacky comedian he is capable of being. Soft, sweet and caring, he handles the role with conviction. Most astounding are 2 brilliant young actresses, Shelan O'Keefe and little Gracie Bednarczyk; true naturals and very in touch with their given material. I hate bad kid actors, but these two kept me convinced throughout. Along the way they briefly stop to see Stanley's brother, Uncle Jack, an irrepressible character played to perfection by Alessandro Nivola. Though dismal at the outset, once they get to the theme park the colors are suddenly quite vivid and true; the kids are happy now, and Stanley realizes it's time to tell them. I found no problem with the development of story or characters. I was quite moved. DVD Extras are fine, mostly from Survivor's Groups and personal accounts. Clint Eastwood wrote the score, which was quite unobtrusive and effective, though other reviewers didn't like it. Too bad. I did. Someday the Academy will recognize John Cusack; he's always been one of my faves. It's annoying to me that so many reviewers are quick to condemn when a character doesn't deal with grief the way they think. My favorite example is Naomi Watts' character in ""21 Grams"". I believed it completely.

In the case of ""Grace is Gone,"" the word refers, on a literal level, to a woman named Grace who is killed while fighting in Iraq, and, on a figurative level, to the loss of innocence and hope suffered by the husband and two young daughters she leaves behind.When Stanley Phillips (John Cusack) receives the devastating news, he decides not to tell the girls (Shelan O'Keefe, Gracie Bednarkczyk) right away, choosing instead to take them on a road trip from their home in Minnesota to a favorite amusement park in Florida, as a means of delaying the inevitable for himself as well as giving them one last happy memory before delivering the life-shattering blow.  On the way, they meet various people - including Stanley's liberal, antiwar brother (well-played by Alessandro Nivola) - but basically it's a story of this one family's heartbreaking odyssey into gut-wrenching knowledge, an odyssey too many families are forced to take in a time of war.James C. Strouse`s ""Grace is Gone"" is a very short (82 minutes), very low-keyed look at how certain individuals cope with tragedy.  Many, like Stanley, refuse even to accept the reality of their loss and hope to postpone the day of reckoning as long as possible.  However, Stanley, who's ex-military himself, also has to confront the tremendous guilt he feels for having supported not only Grace's choice to serve in Iraq but the Republican policies that led to the war in the first place.  Stanley is faced with having to do something no father should ever have to do, and for the time being, he is being forced to hide the truth from not only an exuberant 8-year-old (Dawn) but a far more perceptive 12-year-old (Heidi), who is caught in that unique moment between the naivete of childhood and the knowingness that comes with growing up.  She can sense that something's ""up,"" based on her father's slightly off-kilter behavior, but she can't quite put her finger on what it is.  Indeed, the conversations between Stanley and Heidi - wherein they wind up communicating far more than just what they say with their words - are the best things in the movie.And there simply aren't adjectives adequate to describe the miraculous performances of Cusack, O`Keefe and Bednarkczyk in the principal roles.  This is an ""actors` picture"" if ever there was one, and these three extraordinary individuals prove themselves more than equal to the enormously challenging task they`ve been called upon to do.With its spare settings, self-effacing direction and heartfelt emotions, this is a beautifully understated and moving work that drives home with shattering force the simple truth - one we are all too prone to forget - that not all of war's casualties occur on the battlefield.",4,beautifully understated look at the effect of war on those left behind,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,2830,"['****1/2Anytime', 'word', 'grace', 'movie', 'title', 'time', 'set', 'pun-detector', 'high', 'alert', 'case', 'Grace', 'Gone', 'word', 'refers', 'literal', 'level', 'woman', 'named', 'Grace', 'who', 'killed', 'fighting', 'Iraq', 'figurative', 'level', 'loss', 'innocence', 'hope', 'suffered', 'husband', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'behind.When', 'Stanley', 'Phillips', 'John', 'Cusack', 'devastating', 'news', 'not', 'tell', 'girls', 'Shelan', ""O'Keefe"", 'Gracie', 'Bednarkczyk', 'right', 'away', 'choosing', 'instead', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'home', 'Minnesota', 'favorite', 'amusement', 'park', 'Florida', 'means', 'delaying', 'inevitable', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'one', 'last', 'happy', 'memory', 'delivering', 'life-shattering', 'blow', 'way', 'meet', 'various', 'people', 'including', 'Stanley', 'liberal', 'antiwar', 'brother', 'well-played', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'basically', 'story', 'one', 'family', 'heartbreaking', 'odyssey', 'gut-wrenching', 'knowledge', 'odyssey', 'too', 'many', 'families', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'time', 'war.James', 'C.', 'Strouse', 's', 'Grace', 'Gone', 'very', 'short', '82', 'minutes', 'very', 'low-keyed', 'look', 'how', 'certain', 'individuals', 'cope', 'tragedy', 'Many', 'Stanley', 'refuse', 'even', 'accept', 'reality', 'loss', 'hope', 'postpone', 'day', 'reckoning', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'However', 'Stanley', 'who', 'ex-military', 'also', 'confront', 'tremendous', 'guilt', 'having', 'supported', 'not', 'only', 'Grace', 'choice', 'serve', 'Iraq', 'Republican', 'policies', 'led', 'war', 'first', 'place', 'Stanley', 'faced', 'having', 'do', 'something', 'father', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'do', 'time', 'being', 'being', 'forced', 'hide', 'truth', 'not', 'only', 'exuberant', '8-year-old', 'Dawn', 'far', 'more', 'perceptive', '12-year-old', 'Heidi', 'who', 'caught', 'unique', 'moment', 'naivete', 'childhood', 'knowingness', 'growing', 'up', 'can', 'sense', 'something', 'up', 'based', 'father', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'behavior', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'what', 'Indeed', 'conversations', 'Stanley', 'Heidi', 'wherein', 'wind', 'up', 'communicating', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'say', 'words', 'are', 'best', 'things', 'movie.And', 'there', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'adjectives', 'adequate', 'describe', 'miraculous', 'performances', 'Cusack', 'O', 'Keefe', 'Bednarkczyk', 'principal', 'roles', 'actors', 'picture', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'three', 'extraordinary', 'individuals', 'prove', 'more', 'equal', 'enormously', 'challenging', 'task', 've', 'been', 'called', 'do.With', 'spare', 'settings', 'self-effacing', 'direction', 'heartfelt', 'emotions', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'moving', 'work', 'home', 'shattering', 'force', 'simple', 'truth', 'one', 'are', 'too', 'prone', 'forget', 'not', 'war', 'casualties', 'occur', 'battlefield']",Grace Is Gone
