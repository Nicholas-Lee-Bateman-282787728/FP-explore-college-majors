It is true to its description. It might also be very good as a daily overall warm-up routine for more vigorous exercise, but however it is used, it's well done, clear and well paced.",5,Excellent and highly recommended,1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,408,"['DVD', 'directed', 'seniors', 'actually', 'excellent', 'exercise', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'starting', 'exercise', 'program', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'physical', 'limitations', 'who', 'start', 'easy', 'effectively', 'so', 'true', 'description', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'daily', 'overall', 'warm-up', 'routine', 'more', 'vigorous', 'exercise', 'however', 'used', 'well', 'done', 'clear', 'well', 'paced']","Easy Does It!

1107241,AJSZF8VP6JFME,B000W7NWFG,Chic Lady,"[1, 1]",It is an easy exercise DVD to do. I love all the movements done standing and sitting. Definitely easy does it!He is very clear with his instructions and also the fact that I do not have to lie on my back or floor to do the exercises is an enormous relief. Well done Mr Marcacci. Cool down is fab too.

1107242,A1ZYYW01CTPFTF,B000W7NWFG,Mountain Melody,"[3, 4]","Two great things happened for me this past year.First, I discovered the book, Seasoned Romance, which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex, lovemaking, and romance. One of the main common threads running through each extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed, was the importance of exercise and fitness.Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including this excellent one, Easy Does It, by Craig Marcacci. It's not hard core fitness, but it's a great starting point, especially for seniors who haven't been exercising regularly.More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.Thanks, Craig Marcacci, for the great work you are doing for people like me!",5,Loving the Exercise and the Results,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,853,"['Two', 'great', 'things', 'happened', 'past', 'year.First', 'discovered', 'book', 'Seasoned', 'Romance', 'helped', 'realize', 'larger', 'extent', 'ever', 'seniors', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'excited', 'sex', 'lovemaking', 'romance', 'One', 'main', 'common', 'threads', 'running', 'extraordinary', 'chapter/story', 'noticed', 'was', 'importance', 'exercise', 'fitness.Which', 'number', 'two', 'discovered', 'several', 'great', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'books', 'specifically', 'seniors', 'including', 'excellent', 'one', 'Easy', 'Does', 'Craig', 'Marcacci', 'not', 'hard', 'core', 'fitness', 'great', 'starting', 'point', 'especially', 'seniors', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'exercising', 'regularly.More', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'become', 'cheerleader', 'seniors', '1', 'get', 'back', 'romance', 'game', '2', 'focus', 'fitness.Thanks', 'Craig', 'Marcacci', 'great', 'work', 'are', 'doing', 'people']","Easy Does It!
