328642,AZOT0A86U5RC,630271544X,Linlou,"[8, 8]","I love this movie. Imagine a spoiled, pampered American baseball player getting talked into teaching the ""All American Sport"" to a team of Russian athletes, most of which have never played the game. I thought Joe Mantegna was great in this roll. The wheeling and dealing with the Russian ""underworld"" for just about everything they need is hilarious and very believable.But as it goes with many of the great older movies, American studio execs still have not released this movie to DVD. And then they wonder why so much ""bootlegging"" is going on! I'll keep looking to replace my VHS with DVD, even if it means buying a bootleg copy. This is a great movie and I don't want to wait around for it to maybe show up on some overpriced premium channel. Why is it that the crappy ""slice and dice"" gore movies make it to DVD and the really good ones don't? Again, I'll never understand the American studio execs.

328643,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,630271544X,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","Adding another to the queue in my quiet crusade to get the word out about 'lost' HBO films.Extremely funny and enjoyable story about a Pete Rose-like baseball player/manager. A self-aggrandizing boor who is detested by the team's owner, other coaches, and even his own players. But he delivers wins. And that brings in the fans, which in turns means the money flows when he's in charge, so everyone puts up with his ever-demanding ego.But fate can be oh-so-twisted.Sparky Smith, baseball's hard-charging leadoff jerk becomes permanently injured - but not during a ball game. Nope. In fact, he tears his ACL while pimping for a car commercial. Much to the delight of just about everyone, but especially his boss. Why? Because it was an unauthorized off-field injury - his playing contract is negated. He's screwed.His former highness is soon out of baseball. Broke, vilified, and pathetically alone; having burned his professional bridges, there's nothing left.So he's shocked when a call comes for his services as a manager. That anyone would even give him a chance is a minor miracle in and of itself. But that's where things turn interesting. The call comes from the Russian Sports Federation, former apparatchik of the recently-deceased Soviet Union. And they have a dream.Sparky has been asked to lead their national team to the Olympics.Problem: The Russians don't have a team. Additionally, they don't have: A stadium, coaches (except 'Manuel'), equipment, or baseball players. In fact, the only thing they have is a logo. That's the entirety of their Olympic hopes: A drawing.Thus begins a hilarious fish-out-of-water tale with one lone American sitting in the cold bowels of Moscow trying to field a baseball team made up of throwaways and rejects from more prominent Russian sports like hockey, weghtlifting and tennis.Absolutely loved the depiction of the early days of the collapse which engenders some insanely funny scenes as Sparky has to wheel-n-deal for absolutely everything. Trading pornography for baseballs and bats, wristwatches for food, compact disc players for toilet paper, etc. All funneled through Milov - his newly born capitalist/interpreter/cab driver/commodities trader and all-around-jackski-of-all-tradeskis; hilariously portrayed by veteran character actor John Fleck.Movie Note:- Those unfamiliar with Baseball may not understand that a baseball ""Manager"" is known as the Head Coach in most other sports. And the actual job of managing a baseball team's off-field and business issues is known as the ""GM"" (General Manager). One of the best and starkest examples showing the difference between the jobs was the recent, and completely amazing film, 'Moneyball' with Brad Pitt.",4,Funny Fish Out Of Water Tale,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2709,"['Adding', 'queue', 'quiet', 'crusade', 'get', 'word', ""'lost"", 'HBO', 'films.Extremely', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'Pete', 'Rose-like', 'baseball', 'player/manager', 'self-aggrandizing', 'boor', 'who', 'detested', 'team', 'owner', 'other', 'coaches', 'even', 'own', 'players', 'wins', 'fans', 'turns', 'money', 'when', 'charge', 'so', 'everyone', 'up', 'ever-demanding', 'ego.But', 'fate', 'can', 'be', 'oh-so-twisted.Sparky', 'Smith', 'baseball', 'hard-charging', 'leadoff', 'jerk', 'permanently', 'injured', 'not', 'ball', 'game', 'Nope', 'fact', 'ACL', 'pimping', 'car', 'commercial', 'Much', 'delight', 'just', 'everyone', 'especially', 'boss', 'Why', 'was', 'unauthorized', 'off-field', 'injury', 'playing', 'contract', 'negated', 'screwed.His', 'former', 'highness', 'soon', 'baseball', 'Broke', 'vilified', 'pathetically', 'alone', 'having', 'burned', 'professional', 'bridges', 'nothing', 'left.So', 'shocked', 'when', 'call', 'services', 'manager', 'anyone', 'would', 'even', 'give', 'chance', 'minor', 'miracle', 'where', 'things', 'turn', 'interesting', 'call', 'Russian', 'Sports', 'Federation', 'former', 'apparatchik', 'recently-deceased', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'have', 'dream.Sparky', 'been', 'asked', 'lead', 'national', 'team', 'Olympics.Problem', 'Russians', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'team', 'Additionally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stadium', 'coaches', ""'Manuel"", 'equipment', 'baseball', 'players', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'logo', 'entirety', 'Olympic', 'drawing.Thus', 'hilarious', 'fish-out-of-water', 'tale', 'one', 'lone', 'American', 'sitting', 'cold', 'bowels', 'Moscow', 'trying', 'field', 'baseball', 'team', 'made', 'throwaways', 'rejects', 'more', 'prominent', 'Russian', 'sports', 'hockey', 'weghtlifting', 'tennis.Absolutely', 'loved', 'depiction', 'early', 'days', 'collapse', 'insanely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Sparky', 'wheel-n-deal', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'Trading', 'pornography', 'baseballs', 'bats', 'wristwatches', 'food', 'compact', 'disc', 'players', 'toilet', 'paper', 'etc', 'funneled', 'Milov', 'newly', 'born', 'capitalist/interpreter/cab', 'driver/commodities', 'trader', 'all-around-jackski-of-all-tradeskis', 'hilariously', 'portrayed', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'John', 'Fleck.Movie', 'Note', 'unfamiliar', 'Baseball', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'baseball', 'Manager', 'known', 'Head', 'Coach', 'most', 'other', 'sports', 'actual', 'job', 'managing', 'baseball', 'team', 'off-field', 'business', 'issues', 'known', 'GM', 'General', 'Manager', 'One', 'best', 'starkest', 'examples', 'showing', 'difference', 'jobs', 'was', 'recent', 'completely', 'amazing', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt']",Comrades of Summer VHS
