Sitting there in the theatre, I thought at times that I was watching an I-Max feature.  (And at times I was glad I wasn't, which leads me to believe that the cries of one young theatre-goer, indicate it may be too intense for younger viewers.)  For the rest of us over seven, there is a good, although familiar, story of the misfit penguin.  ""Mumble"" (played with proper insecurity by the voice of the Hobbit, Elijah Wood) does what comes naturally.  Having some latent pre-hatched anomolies, he comes out ready to dance rather than sing.  It alienates him from his community and his love interest, Gloria (played with sexy voice by Brittany Murphy).  His loner pursuit gets him in another fold.  (In this case they're alien penguins with Spanish accents.)  The elders disaprove of the alien assimilation, reasoning that too many mouths to feed will stretch community resources too thin.  (Sound familiar?)  The development is often episodic with harrowing enemies--like a sea lion--and songs that burst out at the drop of an iceburg.  (Just like other musicals, characters burst out in song for the weather--or, in this case Northern Lights, and falling in love--or, again, mating season.)  The bursts of songs are decent to splendid.  (This film is worth every penny for watching the penguins dive into arctic waters from great heights while the full stereo spendour of the Beach Boys' ""Do It Again"" pipes through the digital sound.)The main plot has a point and a destination.  Mumble meets into Lovelace (Robin Williams) who is the penguin guru.  (Much of the movie makes political points, for he wears an involuntary necklace made from a plastic six-pack ring.)  He is short on advice, but Mumble has the messianic touch to go solo on a trek to discover the aliens (man) and solve the mystery of the disappearing food supply.  ""Happy Feet"" Mumble tries to bridge that gap and bring home the bacon (or in this case, sardines).  While I either respect or agree with the viewpoints of the film, I sometimes think it would be more effective if they ""chilled out"" a little bit.  Besides that, 'Happy Feet' is an irresistible animated musical drama/comedy.  (Robin Williams does three voices, including Mumble's main homie, Ramon, which sounds like Williams' comedy portrayal of Ricardo Maltoban.)",4,'Happy Feet' Tap Dances Its Way to Dizzying Heights,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,2375,"[""'Happy"", 'Feet', 'animated', 'feature', 'dizzying', 'animation', 'effects', 'Sitting', 'there', 'theatre', 'thought', 'times', 'was', 'watching', 'I-Max', 'feature', 'times', 'was', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'believe', 'cries', 'one', 'young', 'theatre-goer', 'indicate', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'younger', 'viewers', 'rest', 'seven', 'good', 'familiar', 'story', 'misfit', 'penguin', 'Mumble', 'played', 'proper', 'insecurity', 'voice', 'Hobbit', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'what', 'naturally', 'Having', 'latent', 'pre-hatched', 'anomolies', 'out', 'ready', 'dance', 'rather', 'sing', 'community', 'love', 'interest', 'Gloria', 'played', 'sexy', 'voice', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'loner', 'pursuit', 'fold', 'case', ""'re"", 'alien', 'penguins', 'Spanish', 'accents', 'elders', 'alien', 'assimilation', 'reasoning', 'too', 'many', 'mouths', 'feed', 'will', 'stretch', 'community', 'resources', 'too', 'thin', 'familiar', 'development', 'often', 'episodic', 'harrowing', 'enemies', 'sea', 'lion', 'songs', 'burst', 'out', 'drop', 'iceburg', 'Just', 'other', 'musicals', 'characters', 'burst', 'out', 'song', 'weather', 'case', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'falling', 'love', 'again', 'mating', 'season', 'bursts', 'songs', 'are', 'decent', 'splendid', 'film', 'worth', 'penny', 'watching', 'penguins', 'dive', 'arctic', 'waters', 'great', 'heights', 'full', 'stereo', 'spendour', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Do', 'Again', 'digital', 'sound', 'main', 'plot', 'point', 'destination', 'Mumble', 'meets', 'Lovelace', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'penguin', 'guru', 'Much', 'movie', 'political', 'points', 'involuntary', 'necklace', 'made', 'plastic', 'six-pack', 'ring', 'short', 'advice', 'Mumble', 'messianic', 'touch', 'go', 'solo', 'trek', 'discover', 'aliens', 'man', 'solve', 'mystery', 'disappearing', 'food', 'supply', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Mumble', 'tries', 'bridge', 'gap', 'bring', 'home', 'bacon', 'case', 'sardines', 'either', 'respect', 'agree', 'viewpoints', 'film', 'sometimes', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'chilled', 'out', 'little', 'bit', ""'Happy"", 'Feet', 'irresistible', 'animated', 'musical', 'drama/comedy', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'three', 'voices', 'including', 'Mumble', 'main', 'homie', 'Ramon', 'Williams', 'comedy', 'portrayal', 'Ricardo', 'Maltoban']",N/A

648649,A1INNIFY58JOZO,B00005JPCF,"Amazon Customer ""kwill10""","[29, 42]","Usually fans of animated films, my wife and I were excited about seeing this award winning film.  We were quickly disappointed.  The movie tried to be too many things to too many people, and it ended up missing on nearly every front.  I find it strange that this movie was critically acclaimed, because problems I would expect critics to catch seemed to be everywhere.First, thtere was the lack of a defined audience.  Animated penguins would seem to be for the youngsters.  However, sexually suggestive lyrics and themes that were advanced for even young teenagers seemed to suggest this was a movie for young adults.  Then again, anyone over the age of 4 could see that the ending was completely illogical; it felt like a very feeble attempt to tie two different movies together.That leads to the second problem:  there were at least two different movies going simultaneously.  One movie was about a penguin being isolated because he's different and having to learn to be himself.  The other is about how humans are ruining the environment.  Someone needed to pick a movie and stick to it.Third, if you are going to make this an environmental propaganda piece, at least try to keep from isolating major portions of your audience.  There were some racial stereotypes that many will find offensive.  There were a couple of broad swipes at religion and at conservatives.  And, of course, there's the ending that is so half-baked I found it insulting.If there is one thing to be said for this movie, the animation is truly outstanding.  However, the above problems, along with possibly the worst Elvis impersonation I have every experienced in my life, overshadowed that lone triumph.

648651,A34I5YXWC1QIJU,B00005JPCF,Amazon reviewer,"[2, 5]","This film not only was a tremendous success for environmentalists; you hit about 11 various issues that were long overdue to be addressed in a film for young audiences.Naturally, you are going to be met with opposition when you do that in any movie.First, let me say that I have researched the time that it takes to make a film like this...the ludicrous comments that ""you stole the storyline from ""March of the Penguins"" should be stopped right here and now.  From the information I have researched, this movie was in the making before the Iraqi war.I believe the first time this Penguin issue was brought before the public eye through film making was in 1922. And it's a very poor tactic to accuse a film maker of stealing a storyline that is based on a non-fiction documentary dating all the way back to 1922; especially since any nature documentary is good material for animated movies for children. I don't know of any other animated Penguin movies for children except the one coming out next year.Somewhere in the theatre audiences, there are many Mumbles and Glorias who will come forth in the future and step outside the box because this film impressed them on one or more of those 11 issues that were address in the film. You have succeeded and I congratulate you on this effort!The color was fantastic and the penguins' facial expressions said more than the lines that they spoke.  My hat is off to the artists and choreographers! Robin Williams made a perfect ""Lovelace"" and Hugh Jackman played ""Memphis"" in a very special way.This was entertainment for children at its best with the history, art,music and educational subject matter and there was never a five minute stretch that was not moving the plot along.The premise was a young penguin who could not sing but could dance.  Since their breed of penguins sang to attract a mate, this put Mumble at a disadvantage.The hardship that the penguins had to overcome as a group was starvation.  Penguins are basically starving in real life.  (This part is not fictional.)Mumble meets another race of penguins who actually have rhythm in their movements and he blends in with them, but he can't find a true mate among them as the breed is different, and he would like to have Gloria.( a penguin who was born in his tribe of penguins the same winter he was)Mumble decides that his social issues are not as important as the shortage of food for the penguins to eat and he seeks out to find some answers on why they don't have enough fish for food.  He spots a penguin called ""Lovelace"" who has a plastic six pack holder hanging about his neck.  This shows the audience another issue of repercussions of tossing wastes into the Antarctic have adverse effects on the nature there.  Lovelace swam through the water and it looped around his neck while he was small but as he grew older the plastic began to slowly strangle him.  (another issue)Mumble helps Lovelace solve the plastic choker problem, then resumes his quest to solve the food shortage, sacrificing Gloria in the process.  He persuades her that he is no longer interested in her and wants to go out in the world on his own because he is afraid she will get hurt if she stays with him. (leadership values are played out by this little penguin star throughout the show)In this attempt, to make contact with the humans (he refers to as aliens) he is captured and during his capture, he starts to dance for a little girl while he is in the zoo.  This brings some attention to him from a lot of people.  It is only then that the people decide to find out where he originated from, so they can study the other penguins.Mumble is tagged with a monitor and released so that wildlife specialists can follow him back to his tribe of penguins.  The others see Mumble and Mumble warns them that he has been a captive of aliens who were eating all of their fish.  He convinces the others to dance for the aliens when they arrive.  The behavior of the penguins appears strange to the world leaders and and they figure out that the penguins are trying to tell them they they are not worthless and they need to be able to stay alive like other creatures.The story is not subtle about what man is doing to the Antarctic and finally at the end it comes right out and says ""Stop fishing there.""At one point the scene jumps from Earth to a focal point far from the Earth to show how insignificant we may appear to aliens ourselves, and how would or should we react when they ignore us as we have the penguins.(another thought provoking issue here)Many people took offense at this point of view, because some of the religious leaders first wanted to say the great Penguin in the sky would supply the food and not do anything to try to locate the food; but they did turn back toward a true fact and worked things out with everyone else. We all know that there are some people who misunderstand religion that way; but others do not.  Mature people understand what is implied here and should not take offense as some reviewers wanted to harp on that.My point of view is this:  The producers had only one shot at it to make their point and this movie NAILED IT. Perhaps this review will help me feel like I have taken a least one small step in the right direction to promote a better cause for humanity by first opening a discussion about the creatures that live among us.I appreciate all the actors who made this movie a success, and commend the producers for going through with something that they knew was going to cause great controversy and took a chance on being misunderstood.  (many people took advantage of that).",5,Congratulations George Miller and Warren Coleman!,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,5613,"['film', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'tremendous', 'success',

648656,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPCF,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 9]","I'm not one who usually gets excited about cartoons.  I mean, lately with the birth of my daughter around the corner I've been watching quite a bit more of them, but in general they are not my thing.  `Happy Feet' though was one I was determined to see.  You see, I adore the little creatures known as penguins and a cartoon devoted to them just seemed to be almost heaven sent.  I rushed to watch it, given all the praise and rave reviews, and have to say that after watching it through I was thoroughly disappointed.  Yes, I said disappointed.  In actuality I'm floored that it received all the rave reviews, and while I'll stand by the fact that it is indeed a better cartoon than that tripe known as `Cars' I still can't believe this mess won the Oscar.The storyline is a bit of a bore.  The whole `heartsong' aspect of this film kind of left me with this overly cheesy `I can believe I'm watching this' kind of feeling.  You see penguins love to sing.  That's how they find their soul mates.  They find their `heartsong' and thus find their mate.  The problem with little Mumble is that he can't sing.  He's practically tone-deaf and this has made him the outcast.  But he's not without his talent.  He can dance, but no one else seems to care much for that.  In fact the other penguins resent him for his talent and ultimately blame him for their lack of food.  So he's banished from the colony.  His banishment was the best thing for him though for he meets up with some Spanish penguins who embrace his ability to dance and help him change the world in effect bringing back all the fish.If I said anymore I'd give away too much so I'll stop there.So, while the plot is a bit on the `meh' side, there is more to hate in regards to this film.  First off the singing is ridiculous.  Instead of all new original songs (whatever happened to the good ol' days when animators and storyboard creators actually invested some originality in their work) we have a bunch of penguins running around singing songs we hear on the radio with lyrics changed slightly.  What makes it worse is that some of the songs are heavy on the sexual innuendos and are really inappropriate for children.  The voice over work is decent, but is it just me or is Nicole Kidman a little too breathy and somewhat annoying?  Personally, I don't feel she fit very well.In fact, the only really `good' thing about this movie was the incredibly talented Robin Williams who is just brilliant in this kind of work.  I've said this before, but I'll say it again.  I think it should be mandatory that every cartoon have at least one character voiced by Robin Williams.  The great thing about `Happy Feet' is that they give him TWO characters, and both of them are equally hilarious and memorable.  In fact I'm really upset that the remainder of the film is such a dud because both of Williams' characters are two of the funniest cartoon characters in recent memory.  I wish they would have given his characters a different movie to inhabit.  Alas, maybe they'll give him his own spin off.So anyways, I don't really think I have much more to say.  The film ends up getting way too political for its own good, and the ending is such a waste it's almost hard to watch.  I really wanted to like this, I really did, and I expected to love it, but I can't lie to myself.  `Happy Feet' truly is a bore of a film, a missed opportunity, which saddens me for it could have been so much better.",2,"Messy, boring and forgettable, I'm very unhappy with the result...",1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,3449,"[""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'usually', 'excited', 'cartoons', 'mean', 'lately', 'birth', 'daughter', 'corner', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'general', 'are', 'not', 'thing', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'though', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'determined', 'see', 'see', 'adore', 'little', 'creatures', 'known', 'penguins', 'cartoon', 'devoted', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'almost', 'heaven', 'sent', 'rushed', 'watch', 'given', 'praise', 'rave', 'reviews', 'have', 'say', 'watching', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'disappointed', 'Yes', 'said', 'disappointed', 'actuality', ""'m"", 'floored', 'received', 'rave', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'stand', 'fact', 'indeed', 'better', 'cartoon', 'tripe', 'known', 'Cars', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'mess', 'won', 'Oscar.The', 'storyline', 'bit', 'bore', 'whole', 'heartsong', 'aspect', 'film', 'kind', 'left', 'overly', 'cheesy', 'can', 'believe', ""'m"", 'watching', 'kind', 'feeling', 'see', 'penguins', 'love', 'sing', 'how', 'find', 'soul', 'mates', 'find', 'heartsong', 'thus', 'find', 'mate', 'problem', 'little', 'Mumble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'practically', 'tone-deaf', 'made', 'outcast', 'not', 'talent', 'can', 'dance', 'one', 'else', 'care', 'much', 'fact', 'other', 'penguins', 'resent', 'talent', 'ultimately', 'blame', 'lack', 'food', 'banished', 'colony', 'banishment', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'up', 'Spanish', 'penguins', 'who', 'embrace', 'ability', 'dance', 'help', 'change', 'world', 'effect', 'bringing', 'back', 'fish.If', 'said', 'anymore', ""'d"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there.So', 'plot', 'bit', 'meh', 'side', 'more', 'hate', 'regards', 'film', 'First', 'singing', 'ridiculous', 'Instead', 'new', 'original', 'songs', 'happened', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'when', 'animators', 'storyboard', 'creators', 'actually', 'invested', 'originality', 'work', 'have', 'bunch', 'penguins', 'running', 'around', 'singing', 'songs', 'hear', 'radio', 'lyrics', 'changed', 'slightly', 'What', 'worse', 'songs', 'are', 'heavy', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'are', 'really', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'voice', 'work', 'decent', 'just', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'little', 'too', 'breathy', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fit', 'very', 'well.In', 'fact', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'just', 'brilliant', 'kind', 'work', ""'ve"", 'said', 'before', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'cartoon', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'voiced', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'great', 'thing', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'give', 'TWO', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'fact', ""'m"", 'really', 'upset', 'remainder', 'film', 'dud', 'Williams', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'funniest', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'recent', 'memory', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'characters', 'different', 'movie', 'inhabit', 'Alas', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'give', 'own', 'spin', 'off.So', 'anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'film', 'up', 'getting', 'way', 'too', 'political', 'own', 'good', 'ending', 'such', 'waste', 'almost', 'hard', 'watch', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'really', 'did', 'expected', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lie', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'truly', 'bore', 'film', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A
648657,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00005JPCF,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[8, 14]","I saw this last weekend at a special screening and was suitably impressed. Although I'm a big fan of George Miller's films, I was very hesitant to see this one. The trailers looked awful and indicated nothing about the story. Until the screening came up, I had no intention of seeing this on the big screen. After the opening musical number, the movie quickly won me over. The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. Along this quest, our hero, Mumble, learns to live with his outsider status (he can't sing) and makes use of his own particular gift (tap dancing). It's a simple story that's told in a very creative way with a lot of heart.The musical numbers, instead of having a disrupting effect and stopping the flow of the story, actually advance the plot because they're integral to the story and this particular type of penguin. Emperor Penguins apparently find their mates by singing. While it all sounds the same to us, they are highly attuned to each others songs. The film cleverly translates that idea to the screen by having these animated penguins sing iconic pop/rock songs.I thought the animation was top notch and the style perfectly suited for the story. This isn't the goofy cartoonish animation seen in this past year's other animal-oriented films. It's very rich and leaning heavily towards realism. The vast icy landscapes seem to be copied straight from documentary footage. Just jaw-droppingly beautiful.There's one shot in the film which really epitomizes how well made it is and made me love it that much more. Mumble, his four friends, and the old wise mentor (Lovelace) are heading to the edge of the world as they know it. They're caught in a snow blizzard. The six penguins are shown in almost a dark silhouette as they struggle to move forward. The fading red light of the sun provides faint illumination. As the penguins are pushed back by the blizzard, they lean into the wind and keep going. It's almost like something out of a Kurosawa movie. And that's all it is. Just one shot of the blizzard. But it's beautifully done. Never seen anything like it in an animated film.By the end of the film, my initial reservations about the film were completely washed away.

648658,A2SJAZZBJR2MHX,B00005JPCF,Angela Gray,"[8, 12]","My husband I were in Blockbuster one Friday night, and they had a preview for a penguin movie. The water was mesmerizing, the image so beautiful, I could hardly wait to watch it with the kids.When we rented Happy Feet, I was excited to finally see that beautiful penguin movie. Or so I thought. What I saw instead was a bunch of penguins singing Prince songs, among other things. Warner brothers was showing off its music catalog with Happy Feet, but I don't know what they were doing as far as movies go. That was a jumbled mess with Robin Williams playing like 5 characters and a bunch of loopy tap dancing numbers. Savion Glover looks like a street person in the scary special features section too. That loopy Prince song playing in the credits messed me up man. I kept shaking my head to erase that bad trip.Based on an ancient cartoon about an opera singing papa owl with an `Owl' Jolson son, Happy Feet is a fish out of water story. Sort of. Then there's a weird plot line about finding the aliens who polluted the water and got rid of the fish, and then the deal about the penguins can communicate by tap dancing, and how that even catches man's attention. And they all get fish! I think. Because by that point I was gone. Couldn't. take. it. any. longer!I was still shuddering weeks later when Surf's Up appeared in the mail. I saw the beautiful water, but I was still muttering ""I can't believe!"" under my breath. I mean, Happy Feet! It looked so promising!Then the movie started. It was like a documentary. I laughed, and continued laughing for the whole movie. Except for the brief minutes when I fell asleep. But that's just me. It's a rare movie that doesn't put me to sleep. I think that would be about 2 movies, tops. But I digress.Surf's Up was just so funny. And cute. And what a great story. I don't want to give any more away. Rent it, immediately! Then tell me how right I am.The kids didn't know how bad Happy Feet was until they saw Surf's Up. Their brows furrowed as the wave of realization hit them. All penguin movies are not alike!They couldn't discern as much when the comparison was between Finding Nemo and Shark's Tale. They had actually prefered the ghetto alternative mess to the timeless classic. They're all too young to catch the nuances of difference between Bug's Life and Antz and Ant Bully.But Surf's Up and Happy Feet?

I found it funny and enjoyable hearing the penguans sing edited versions of songs that I always listened to or found familiar. My favorites were the Kiss, boogie wonderland, and the stevie wonder song near the end. I loved the dancing too (I'm a lover of music and dances). They did some wonderful choreography for these scenes. I expecially liked the credits when they play Song of The Heart by Prince (I MP3'ed that). I actually liked the messages of the movie. the thing about being different from others in society is one. Mumbo is ridiculed for being different which can be reflected in our own societies. The humans are ruining the earth thing was good because in reality its true. Someone said that its overboard because it gives humans few redeeming qualities, but I have to disagree because when you think of what goes on in the world humans do have few redeeming qualities in terms of nature. Now theres one thing I have to agree with though -snicker- some of this is a little too adult for the little ones.

648661,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B00005JPCF,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[4, 9]","""Happy Feet"" is fun, somewhere between Bambi for penguins and, as many have said, a musical version of ""March of the Penguins"" with a social message.What it is not is lasting. The best animated movies, like ""Aladdin"" (also starring Robin Williams), ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Snow White,"" and the aforementioned ""Bambi,"" have more going on than shtick. ""Happy Feet"" relies too much on shtick. This makes it entertaining the first time through, and probably not the second.The animation is often much better than ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" The wry humor is as good as, or better than, the best of the Veggie Tales shorts (way better than ""Jonah: The Veggie tales Movie""). The music will make an interesting soundtrack.What's the shtick? A dancing penguin. Great premise, but the animation's timing is weak. The sound of the tapping does not equal what is on screen. The dance routine becomes exactly that, routine. We see it once, twice, three times. The fifteenth time, I was bored with it.The food chain is explained well, as is the competition for food. Penguins, birds, humans, all eat fish. Some birds also eat penguins. When humans eat more fish, birds eat more penguins, and the penguin population naturally declines.When the penguins suffer, they look for solutions. Some ideas are silly, and blame the conservative side of penguins -- very 1950s-style Soviet communism (with a dose of Native American animism and a weaker dose of 1890s Christian revivalism). Others are survivalist, requiring endurance of characters. Mumbles becomes an unwilling solution finder. He is not looking at the big picture, he presses naively through hardship to ask simply if the humans (he thinks they are aliens) can help.Survival of the fittest is clear here. The struggle, the ingenuity and resourcefulness of survival is played well.The music, especially the introductory songs, are great fun. It will appeal mostly to fans of late 1970s and 1980s music. Its brilliance is in the mixing of songs so well that a first time listening might not realizing it is a medley.Williams is better than he has been recently, especially with his Barry White styled guru penguin, Lovelace.Characters are not always well-explained. They come and go, occasionally for no reason. This could be bad writing or editing, but, either way, left me confused.""Happy Feet"" could be considered a movie in which the main character tries to find himself. Or, if the audience wants to think more heavily than intended, Mumbles the dancing penguin is Martin Luther, an artist, an unwilling revolutionary, or a gay activist. It flirts with all of this, but never enough to dominate the message.I saw it once, had fun, should have waited for the DVD. Should you see it? Sure.

It's somewhere betweeen ""above average"" and ""really good"".  I guess that would make it ""good"". lolBefore watching Happy Feet, I knew there'd be a fair amount of musical bits with penguins singing and dancing all over the frozen landscape, but what I didn't know was that the storyline would be about penguins that HAVE to have a singing voice in order to fit in and be well-liked by the other penguins.  It's kind of pathetic to me that the penguins who couldn't sing had to be treated like yesterdays garbage by the other penguins.  Then again, it's just an animated film.  No reason to care about this *too* hard.Anyway, even though musical bits in movies aren't really my thing, this one at least had a solid selection of tunes to elevate my interest.  Mostly older songs were included, such as funky Stevie Wonder-like music from the 70's or Queen's ""Somebody to Love"".  The one penguin singing Elvis's ""Heartbreak Hotel"" was REALLY funny.  You will love this scene.They did a nice job in the beginning of the film giving the viewer a realistic idea of how penguins are born.  This was included and given a fair amount of attention, which was appreciated by me.Still, it was strange to me that the main character (the one penguin with the talent to tap dance) went through an extremely lengthy amount of time without the other penguins noticing that he had a real talent.  Just because he couldn't sing, he was ignored.  Then suddenly, after roughly 60% of the film went by, they began to notice his tap-dancing ability and began singing along to it and treating it like it was the most important thing in the world.  The penguins weren't made to look like intelligent creatures, that's for sure.The action scenes were really good.  The penguins being attacked by birds and sharks was very exciting to watch.  It was fun watching them constantly find ways to escape.If you have an interest in penguins and think they're adorable little birds, you will no doubt LOVE this movie.

The movie starts off cute and funny in the beginning and becomes dreary towards the middle, but it does brighten back up at the end. A few of the songs being sung by the penguins  were inappropriate. Even though it was mating season, there are thousands of appropriate love songs that could've been chosen instead of ""Kiss"" and ""I'll Make Love To You"". An original score would've been better. As for the so-called ""PETA-like progaganda"", there's nothing wrong with caring about the environement.  As a note of caution, there are some scenes that could be frightening to younger children. There's the scene when Mumbles was being chased by a leopard seal and another scene where Mumbles and his crew were attacked  by Orca whales.

648671,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPCF,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 8]","For sheer entertainment, HAPPY FEET is well worth your time and money. Borrowing from several recent films and incorporating old and new musical numbers, Happy Feet will most likely get your own toes a-tappin' as well as crack a few smiles.The story is also politically intriguing (although most of this will go over younger viewers' heads), commenting on neo-conservatism, differing lifestyle choices (the gay lifestyle can easily be surmised here), and how difficult change and acceptance can be.The film takes on the initial look and feel of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, an excellent Oscar winning documentary. But this is animated and the story much lighter (at least on the surface). We are quickly whisked into anthropomorphic-land as these emperor penguins talk, sing and eventually dance. The animation is first-rate, being both very colorful and detailed. Later in the story there's also the added bonus of real-life humans (not animated) that show up in the film.The story surrounds the birth of a penguin named Mumble (Elijah Wood, LORD OF THE RINGS). During his early egg-hood (prior to hatching) his father, Memphis (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN) accidentally dropped the egg during a blizzard and later blames himself for the ""differences"" his son exhibits. Penguins sing beautiful melancholy songs to one another to both appease their spirits (i.e., to bring back the fish stocks that've been diminishing year by year), as well as to attract a mate. But Mumble can't sing and instead moves his feet in true tap-dance style. This is very un-penguin-like and he is shunned by all except the beautiful Gloria (Brittany Murphy, GIRL, INTERRUPTED) who finds his singing horrific but his demeanor and differences intriguing. It is these differences that will ultimately alienate Mumble from his family, friends, and own kind ...and eventually save his entire species. Every penguin will have to learn to dance in order to save themselves.Added to the fun of the movie is the incorporation of old and new songs with changing and interlinking tempos, very similar to MOULIN ROUGE. In fact, one of the main singing characters is named Norma Jean who's voiced by none other than Nicole Kidman (one of the stars of Moulin Rouge).The neo-conservatism can be witnessed as the older penguins who are in charge of the emperor's refuse to change or accept Mumble's differences, wanting to stick to old ways even when faced with possible starvation from the absent fish in the surrounding oceans.That the gay lifestyle can be inserted is easily seen. Mumble is different. Very different. He walks,  talks and acts in ways that disturb the older penguins and they immediately shun him and attempt to keep him away from the flock.

Penguin turned into outsider by odd behavior, seeks answer to riddle of what has happened to the fish they depend on. Goes on a quest to find answer.First of all, this film is a quest movie and has the basic hero storyline: the community experiences a disaster; young man(penguin) goes off on a quest to find the answer and bring a boon back. Naturally, the hero is an oustider..thats what spurs him to undertaking the great task. He needs to prove himself.So the story is straightforward...but the manner of treatment is not. The director, George Miller, is not an american...hes an australian with a very different sensibility. Hence the musical numbers in the film. At first i found this different and strange. But if you accept the premise of talking penguins, why not singing and dancing ones! Given that, the choice of music is usually apt and entertaining.One 'reviewer' was surprised the film called Happy Feet, as she/he didnt find it a happy movie!....This is where professional reviewers are preferable! The Happy Feet refers to the penguins strange ability, which propels the plot, not the story: on which see above. But it DOES have a happy ending....The story as it unfolds is varied, with exquisite computer animation, great dialogue (better than most american animation, where the dialogue is embarrassingly trite: think Ice Age 2),and a cast which is well suited to the characters.S.Nay wrote:'The few fun scenes didn't make up for the overall slow and dragging pace. 'What??? The movie moved along at good pace....maybe the reviewer is too used to hi-octane movies.The film has an environmental theme, which angered a number of 'reviewers'...who are offended by anthnig that seems to criticise the american way of 'life' or massive and very conspicuous overconsumption. But thats why liked it...It had a very topical theme...not another buddy movie (Ice Age) or pressure piece for family values...It has a theme that can be appreciated by people all over our globally warming world...The use of different accents....do the reviewers want them all to speak broad american?

The plot is flimsy at best, and more than anything else, seems aimed to provide giant holes into which tedious dance sequences and cover songs fall.  This might as well have been a lousy musical instead of a lousy drama failing in its comedic attempts (or is it a lousy comedy missing its dramatic marks?).For young kids, the villains are too scary and the characters' pain too omnipresent, particularly main character Mumble's near descent into insanity at the film's end, and the chronic choking torture of Robin Williams' character Lovelace.  Plus, the story is too complicated and nuanced for kids to understand: I'm sure for the most part, children can appreciate themes of celebrating diversity and fitting square pegs into round holes, but they're not going to realize the film's message of attracting a mate through a ""heartsong"" that most penguins communicate through singing and not dancing (despite the film's inextricably linking the two).There are heavier themes at work here that will repel older viewers, on top of their inevitable boredom with the oft-repeated song and dance numbers- namely the negative impact man has on the environment.

As the movie  progreses, one sympathizes with his character and roots for him to get the girl.The music choices were by far the best part of the movie as it kept the energy up and helped move along the plot. However once the music stopped and the movie turned towards the path of political activism, that's when things started to go downhill.The movie should have ended with Mumble getting the girl, instead they prolong this animinated feature to include a statement about global warming. Although I agree that global warming is an issue that needs severe attention, it shouldn't have been included in this film.

It is definitely in the same genre of films as Rudolph the Reindeer; a social outcast for being different, his special ability saves the dayThis is a move to just relax and enjoy, for the most part.  The cool Antarctic scenery and the multitude of penguins is vsiual eye candy.  One scene is like a roller coaster simulator in its animation.  There are four types of penguins shown: mostly Emperors, the five adelies who are Mumble's closest friends, the Rockhopper sage, and the chinstraps at the zoo.  Also shown are leapard seals, elephant seals, skuas, and killer whales.The problems in the movie come about when they decide to inject humans in the movie.  The humans were like braking from 100mph to 0 in a second.  It was that jarring.  They made zoos seem like jails.  It is understandable that some see a slight anti-religioun message, but its more against conformity than religion.  Still, it could have been done without and still keep the story going.

Don't miss out on this visually stunning, wonderfully cute, and awe-inspiring musical romp! ""Happy Feet"" won an Academy Award for best animated movie, and after seeing it I think most people will whole-heartedly agree.Quick Synopsis: Mumble is a penguin born into a society (of penguins anyway) where singing is everything. Without your ""heart-song"", you can't find a mate and fall in love. Unfortunately, Mumble was born without a great singing voice, and is immediately criticized and ostrasized for his lack of singing ability. However, Mumble can do something none of the other penguins can -- he can dance! Mumble can never resist moving his happy feet to the rythmn of the other penguin's singing. Unfortunately, Mumble's fellow penguins are in danger of starvation due to a sudden lack of fish. After making a few new friends, Mumble sets out to find the reason for the disappearance of all the fish, and put a stop to it, tapping his toes and touching the lives of everyone around him on the way.The thing that will strike you the most about this film is the amazing musical score. The songs are fun and beautiful at the same time, but one of the best things about them are that most of them are re-tooled variations of popular hip-hop and pop songs that will help a younger generation to connect with the film. The big musical numbers are intricate and often touching.This is a great family film, and I think that people of all ages will be able to watch it and be entertained. It kind of has a little something for everyone -- lot's of humor, incredible musical and dance numbers (yes, penguins dancing is unbelievably adorable), even a subtle political commentary on the nature of human impact on our environment, especially the impact our actions have on animal species. Meanwhile, there are also connotations of love and acceptance, as well as youth's journey towards finding themselves and growing to be happy with who they are and not who others think they should be. These are all positive messages that are cleverly tucked into the plot, inbetween fantastical dance numbers, and wise-cracking penguins.Bottom line, this was a very enjoyable film for me. Admittedly I'm a big fan of these types of family films, but all the same I think that others will enjoy it also.",5,Penguins -- All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Go!

648690,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPCF,Chris Pandolfi,"[19, 28]","I went into ""Happy Feet"" feeling a bit jaded from the slew of animated films released in 2006 (those of you who read my review for ""Flushed Away"" will know exactly what I'm talking about). I kept thinking: will another one be too much for me to handle? Thank goodness the answer was no; for the most part, ""Happy Feet"" is a well-paced, clever film that's delightfully energetic, playfully humorous, and deceptively informative. Above all, it's thoroughly entertaining, containing many scenes that would rival some of today's best musical plays (if it weren't for the fact that penguins can't actually sing or dance). I enjoyed the characters. I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed the choreography. I enjoyed the photography, despite the landscapes being completely computer generated.Most of all, I enjoyed the fact that, for a family film, the story was original. Let me explain: the ideas that were presented have been used in more serious, less family-oriented films. ""Happy Feet"" is formulaic as a Self Discovery movie. It tells the story of an emperor penguin named Mumble (eventually voiced by Elijah Wood) living in Antarctica. He lacks the ability to sing in a world where finding one's heart song is vital for achieving true love. His only form of expression is dance; his feet tap away at lightening speed, and he practically floats across the ice. Unfortunately, none of the other penguins can appreciate or even understand this ability, and he's immediately labeled as an unworthy misfit.The story is also formulaic as a Hero's Journey fable. The fact that the colony's fish supply is dwindling is hinted at early on. The cause for such depletion is also hinted at; at one point, a ravenous bird (Anthony LaPaglia) tells Mumble that aliens abducted him. The creatures were big and fat, with eyes positioned on the front of the head and with odd appendages protruding from their bodies. And much to everyone's dismay, they're also smarter. They poked, prodded, and manhandled the bird, and they attached a small orange cylinder to his ankle before releasing him. Such descriptions stay with Mumble, and they come in handy when the fish supply is virtually gone; because he suspects that these aliens are responsible, he decides to find them and ask for a stop to their destructive behavior. What he has yet to understand is how far he'll have to go and how dangerous a journey it will be.Thus far, the plot is fairly straightforward and seemingly perfect for families. However, the film doesn't adhere to the conventional child-friendly storytelling methods; not only does it have a non-traditional happy ending, it also has an underlying seriousness that isn't as obvious in other such films. For one thing, the penguin's group dynamic suggests religious satire; Mumble and his parents are part of a very large gathering, one that's lead by group of elders. Everyday, they preach to the penguins the importance of praying to a god, which we already know is nothing more than the Aurora Borealis. What's worse, they see Mumble as a deviant whose dancing angers the penguin god. If he wishes to remain among his kind, he must give his feet a rest and learn how to sing.The satire goes further. Mumble's father--the Elvis-sounding Memphis (Hugh Jackman)--has trouble accepting his son's inability to sing, convinced that he ""turned out wrong"" because his egg was accidentally dropped. Even though he loves his son, he believes that, for the good of the colony, Mumble needs to shape up. ""Don't ask me to change,"" he says, ""because I can't."" His mother--the Marilyn Monroe-sounding Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman)--is much more understanding; even though her son can't sing, she sees that he isn't any less of a penguin. Even Gloria (Brittany Murphy)--the would-be love interest--is eventually willing to look past Mumble's shortcomings. But as he will come to learn, the support of two penguins isn't enough for him to be accepted by the entire colony.The satire goes further still. After being chased by a hungry seal, Mumble finds a new colony of penguins, ones of a different and shorter species. He first meets a small gang of thrill seekers led by Ramon (Robin Williams), a character so full of stereotypical Latin machismo that he practically steals the film. He introduces Mumble to Lovelace (also voiced by Williams), the religious leader of the group whose voice is a cross between a Barry White impression and a televangelist. He claims to have the answer to everything, and a dedicated following shows that many believe this to be true. All he asks for is a pebble as a form of payment. He's first seen standing on a gigantic pile of pebbles, haughtily preaching to those who seek answers. But from our point of view, something is not right; around Lovelace's neck is a ""talisman,"" which in reality is nothing more than the plastic six-pack rings used to hold soda cans. Such an idea is understandably disturbing, and it gets worse when he's later seen choking. But it's also effective, especially as the film draws to a close.Mumble and his new friends begin the journey to find the ""aliens,"" which leads to a pretty interesting turn of events. Let's just say that Mumble finds them, and he sees that their world is defined by putting other species in confined spaces (ones that ineffectively recreate the areas they came from). His experience paves the way for an ending I didn't particularly care for. I found that bothersome; this would have been a perfect film had it not been for the ending, which is far too contrived to suit such an original story. Nonetheless, I have to give ""Happy Feet"" all five stars. I was amazed at its willingness to be different and I absolutely loved the satirical undertones.",5,Dance of the Penguins,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,5719,"['went', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'feeling',

It was a stunning film to look at (except those doll eyes) but the story basically trodded along and I called the film ""bi-polar"" since it did as much things wrong as it did right. Happy Feet is the exact same way. The animation is consistently stunning but then it's got other elements that prevents it from being a good animation film. It has its fans but some people, like me, won't know what they just saw.In the land of Antarctica, penguins find their mates through ""heartsongs"" where penguins sing and should someone connect with it, then they become mates. Due to an accident, young Mumble can't sing to save his life but he can tap dance like no one's business. But in penguin land, tap dancing is just not cool and he desperatedly tries to win the affections of penguin Gloria while also solving the problem of the shortage of fish with the help of a young spanish-accented posse.How to describe Happy Feet...it's hard. For one third, it's basically Moulin Rouge! with penguins. It's unbelievably strange to hear penguins sing ""Somebody to Love"" by Queen but like in Moulin Rouge!, it at least fit the tone and feel. Then it becomes essentially like Dreamworks' films with a bunch of pop-culture references and lowbrow humor, courtesy of Robin Williams heading the spanish posse. Then we get an environmental message and the weirdest last act I've ever seen in an animated movie. How this won over Cars and Monster House is completely beyond me. Cars is considered Pixar's weakest output while Monster House was a bit more intense for the younger viewers so Happy Feet probably got a default win.However, I can't fault the film on the animation. In the special features of Finding Nemo, they asked the animators to get realistic with the water to the point where it looked indisguishable from reality so they had to dial it back and made it more animation friendly. Happy Feet though didn't listen and some shots, such as vista scenes and landscapes look straight out of documentaries; they're just that sharp. Then we have the oh-so-adorable penguin babies and a couple great action scenes with the highlight being Mumble outrunning a sea lion. And I don't want to spoil one other use of filmmaking they used at the end but it's definately a ""what the?"" moment.Some people are developing a DVD sixth sense: anticipating a double-dip. The extras here are unbelievably light to the point where you just know looking at the back that there's a future 2-disc on its way. Of course the kiddies won't mind but for others who like to get some insight into the film, this is quite disappointing; especially when it's been over a month since the film won the Oscar.The film's got stellar animation but a very schizophrenic story and there's a couple of moments that made me laugh unintentionally (basically the last 10-15 minutes or so) so kids will probably like it while others feel disappointed.

648703,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B00005JPCF,Crystal Starr Light,"[3, 4]","The trailer for this movie looked so cute!  I mean, come on!  Dancing and singing penguins?  So I put this movie down on my to-rent list.After I pushed play on my DVD player, I started finding faults from every corner.1.  Nicole Kidman is not convincing as a mother figure.  Every scene she was in, I kept thinking she is Satine from Moulin Rouge.2.  The story is not very fluid.  We go from Mumble's pre-birth to his birth fairly fluidly, but then we suddenly jump several years (probably months) rather rushed.  And how much time does he spend with the other penguins?  How long is he in the zoo?  None of this makes any sense.3.  The music and Lovelace are very sexualized for a child's movie.  I was appalled at some of the things coming from the character's mouths.4.  It was hard to appreciate Mumble's dancing because it was hard to see what his feet were doing.  If it wasn't for the tap dancing sound track, I wouldn't have known when Mumble was dancing or when he was running, jumping, or trying to find a bathroom.5.  At the end, how do all the penguins know how to dance?  I thought dancing was bad and singing was where you found your heartsong?  When did the penguins miraculously cultivate this talent?6.  The plot is rather unimpressive.  Poor Mumble has no Heartsong and has to convince others his Heartsong is his dancing and that is OK.  In the meantime, he must also save the penguins from starvation, knocking Lovelace from his spiritual pedestal, befriending dancing penguins from a remote part of the island, and winning the heart of his long-love.  Certain details are never brought back up again (i.e. the attacking birds, the seal, etc.).  And the ending?  Puhlease!7.  At the end of the movie, I just sat staring at the screen asking myself, ""Is this it?""  How could something that looked so cute in a trailer be this tepid?  This show has been done, in parts, much better elsewhere.  Why did the producers think we needed another film with all these hodgepodge pieces mashed together like a bad salad?8.  It seems silly to me that the whole ""humans are taking the fish away because they are over-fishing and polluting the earth"" angle can pass.  Did anyone see how many Empire penguins alone there were?  Probably around 30 million--no wonder they are having food problems!  Anybody remotely familiar with biology or differential equations can tell you that is what is going to happen.  Food goes up, prey goes up, predators go up and kill more prey.  Food goes down, prey goes down, etc.  With this many penguins all competing for the same food source, it should be clear that humans aren't the only reason behind the food shortage.  The penguins are their own worse enemy.Not to sound overly negative, I liked Elijah Wood as Mumble and Hugh Jackman as his father (I never knew he could talk and sing like that!).  The animals were very realistic and adorable.  And the dancing was pretty cute (when and if you could see it).I walked in hoping for some laughs; I walked out feeling confused.  I am glad that I rented the film and had not watched it in the theater or bought it.  It was barely worth the time I spent watching it; it certainly wasn't worth the $20 or so buying it or the $10 or so seeing it on the big screen.",2,Left feeling like something was missing,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,3253,"['trailer', 'movie', 'looked', 'so', 'cute', 'mean', 'come', 'Dancing', 'singing', 'penguins', 'So', 'put', 'movie', 'down', 'to-rent', 'list.After', 'pushed', 'play', 'DVD', 'player', 'started', 'finding', 'faults', 'corner.1', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'not', 'convincing', 'mother', 'figure', 'scene', 'was', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Satine', 'Moulin', 'Rouge.2', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'fluid', 'go', 'Mumble', 'pre-birth', 'birth', 'fairly', 'fluidly', 'then', 'suddenly', 'jump', 'several', 'years', 'probably', 'months', 'rather', 'rushed', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'spend', 'other', 'penguins', 'How', 'long', 'zoo', 'None', 'sense.3', 'music', 'Lovelace', 'are', 'very', 'sexualized', 'child', 'movie', 'was', 'appalled', 'things', 'coming', 'character', 'mouths.4', 'was', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'Mumble', 'dancing', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'feet', 'were', 'doing', 'was', ""n't"", 'tap', 'dancing', 'sound', 'track', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'when', 'Mumble', 'was', 'dancing', 'when', 'was', 'running', 'jumping', 'trying', 'find', 'bathroom.5', 'end', 'how', 'do', 'penguins', 'know', 'how', 'dance', 'thought', 'dancing', 'was', 'bad', 'singing', 'was', 'where', 'found', 'heartsong', 'When', 'did', 'penguins', 'miraculously', 'cultivate', 'talent', '6', 'plot', 'rather', 'unimpressive', 'Poor', 'Mumble', 'Heartsong', 'convince', 'others', 'Heartsong', 'dancing', 'OK', 'meantime', 'must', 'also', 'save', 'penguins', 'starvation', 'knocking', 'Lovelace', 'spiritual', 'pedestal', 'befriending', 'dancing', 'penguins', 'remote', 'part', 'island', 'winning', 'heart', 'long-love', 'Certain', 'details', 'are', 'never', 'brought', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'i.e', 'attacking', 'birds', 'seal', 'etc.', 'ending', 'Puhlease', '7', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'sat', 'staring', 'screen', 'asking', 'How', 'could', 'something', 'looked', 'so', 'cute', 'trailer', 'be', 'tepid', 'show', 'been', 'done', 'parts', 'much', 'better', 'elsewhere', 'Why', 'did', 'producers', 'think', 'needed', 'film', 'hodgepodge', 'pieces', 'mashed', 'together', 'bad', 'salad', '8', 'silly', 'whole', 'humans', 'are', 'taking', 'fish', 'away', 'are', 'over-fishing', 'polluting', 'earth', 'angle', 'can', 'pass', 'Did', 'anyone', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'Empire', 'alone', 'were', 'Probably', '30', 'million', 'wonder', 'are', 'having', 'food', 'problems', 'Anybody', 'remotely', 'familiar', 'biology', 'differential', 'equations', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Food', 'up', 'prey', 'up', 'predators', 'go', 'up', 'kill', 'more', 'prey', 'Food', 'down', 'prey', 'down', 'etc', 'many', 'competing', 'same', 'food', 'source', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'humans', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'reason', 'food', 'shortage', 'penguins', 'are', 'own', 'worse', 'enemy.Not', 'sound', 'overly', 'negative', 'liked', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Mumble', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'could', 'talk', 'sing', 'animals', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'adorable', 'dancing', 'was', 'pretty', 'cute', 'when', 'could', 'see', 'walked', 'hoping', 'laughs', 'walked', 'out', 'feeling', 'confused', 'am', 'glad', 'rented', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'theater', 'bought', 'was', 'barely', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', '20', 'so', 'buying', '10', 'so', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen']",N/A

Happy Feet, ultimately an updated tale of the ugly duckling, tackles the sensitive issues of stigma and exclusion in a unique way.In this movie penguins sing. They have a soul voice and this gives them cultural identity. But when the lead character, Mumbles, is born with the gift of dance, he finds himself automatically ostracized from his emperor penguin community. What follows is a journey to right wrong and a challenge to discrimination.One of the flaws of Happy Feet is that you are never too sure who the intended target audience is: adults or children. Whereas traditional CGI movies (think any Pixar movie or Shrek et al) beguile the kids and tickle begrudging parents, Happy Feet wades in far too long and not too deep.

It's not so much the political message I minded (admirable as it is), or the hamfisted way it's shoved down the viewer's throat in the last five minutes of the film; it's more the lapses in logical storytelling.  Any zoo with a tap-dancing penguin wouldn't let it out of its sight, let alone allow it to return to Antarctica.  And for a movie about finding one's ""heartsong,"" there's not one scrap of original music.  (Unless you count Prince's ""Song of the Heart"" that plays over the final credits.)  What a wasted opportunity to create an original score; who needs to hear Nicole Kidman and Brittany Murphy singing lousy 80s pop songs?

A few of my disappointments:Sexed up dialogue: a good portion of the first 30 minutes is not something I would want any kid to see. Penguin sex on March of the Penguins was fine -- it was nature. This is just inappropriate since it is not about nature but about penguins trying to get in other penguins pants with dialogue.Reinforcing prejudices: it may be all fun and games in the movies, but when characters are given accents and act according to prejudices corresponding to those accents, that's too much for a family film. At least, I would hope.Political motivations prominent: it is true that there is an enormous problem with humans destroying ecosystems, including around the Antarctic, however, a movie should still carry a plot that isn't so blatantly political. Fire these writers for a lack of creativity of bringing in these important topics and a good movie instead of having a penguin telling the people in the movie to stop taking their fish for the last 20 minutes of the film. (I'm certainly an environmentalist and I was entirely disappointed since this film could have been good and still carried this message, meaning adults could have enjoyed seeing it a couple times and perhaps gotten something more from it.)My girlfriend who was more interested in the film initially since she likes penguins also got bored after 30 minutes -- even if penguins are cute and look quite cuddly, there must be something of interest to engage the audience for 1 hour 40 minutes. This movie could have been much better.The good? The computer-animated people were amazingly real -- far better than any film I had seen before. Not much else to report in this category. Some humor here and there, but some/much of it based on prejudices.Seriously, skip this one. Since I would still like people to get the environmental awareness, I would recommendAn Inconvenient Truthinstead -- it is a far better film, carrying an even more important overall message about a major global conservation issue.

It IS possible to make a funny movie without resorting to toilet humor and crass jokes if you're genuinely creative.Additionally, the musical-ness of it was BORING.

Reinstein ""marindavid""","[2, 6]","My wife and I, proud grandparents of a couple of children - one of them a highly verbal and bright 5 year-old Kindergartner - took her to see Happy Feet. Our decision was based, largely, on two factors. 1) The TV reviewers who raved about how appropriate it was for youngsters and 2) the trailers we saw ourselves in the theaters - none of which showed any of the frightening and suggestively gruesome parts. Thirsty-five minutes into the film, she was in Grandma's lap - and five minutes later - after covering her eyes at a scene showing the business parts of a leopard seal's mouth (though she thought it was a shark!) - looked at me saying, ""Papa .... Why do they put this kind of scary stuff into a movie for kids ?!"" And you know what?.... Her reactions and her question were both a lot more appropriate (and, incidentally, entertaining in their own way) that was the film itself - that we left after 40 minutes of, going home to play some Sorry, draw some pictures and practice reading and counting. These things were FUN for her - Happy Feet was not.Without getting into the details of the plot, the voices (well done by famous 'real' actors,) or the animation (nice drawings that mime naturalism) - suffice it to say that this is definitely NOT a film for children under 10-11 years old. Reviewers who say that it is suitable for younger kids simply either have been away from the company of young children for too long or are in the company of ones conditioned to be unafraid of this type of imagery. As a child therapist, I must say that the latter possibility is not a good sign interns of future development or the ability to discriminate frightening scenes from ""fun entertainment.""The media 'hype' of this film has been extraordinary. And, for fans of detailed animation, I can see where this would be an interesting and entertaining film. For penguinism fans, the documentary showing real penguins (""The March Of The Penguins"" is FAR superior) and covers much of the same material - sans, of course, the Hollywood requirement for created adventure and unnaturally frightening images.I like penguins. They, along with pandas, are perhaps amongst the cutest animals in the world - kids love them too. But in the venue of this film, they are vulnerable and as frightened as the production will leave many young children.One final word: As we were leaving, we could hear many of the young children in the theater complaining about being scared and beginning to cry. We were aware that their parents (or the adults who were with them) were not picking up on this heartfelt and honest cue and were staying there. Ultimately, this concerned us more than the inappropriateness of the film itself for young children. Adults who don't listen to them.If your kids are 10 -11 years old and don't mind a little scare and a lot of cute - Happy Feet may be a good couple of hours spent. If not, find something to do with them that does not describe fright as fun. They will be confused and scared - and you will not have done such a good thing.",3,Little kids scare easily - Adults forget,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,3045,"['wife', 'proud', 'grandparents', 'couple', 'children', 'one', 'highly', 'verbal', 'bright', '5', 'year-old', 'Kindergartner', 'took', 'see', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'decision', 'was', 'based', 'largely', 'two', 'factors', '1', 'TV', 'reviewers', 'who', 'raved', 'how', 'appropriate', 'was', 'youngsters', '2', 'trailers', 'saw', 'theaters', 'none', 'showed', 'frightening', 'suggestively', 'gruesome', 'parts', 'Thirsty-five', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'Grandma', 'lap', 'five', 'minutes', 'later', 'covering', 'eyes', 'scene', 'showing', 'business', 'parts', 'leopard', 'seal', 'mouth', 'thought', 'was', 'shark', 'looked', 'saying', 'Papa', 'Why', 'do', 'put', 'kind', 'scary', 'stuff', 'movie', 'kids', 'know', 'what', 'reactions', 'question', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'appropriate', 'incidentally', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'film', 'left', '40', 'minutes', 'going', 'home', 'play', 'Sorry', 'draw', 'pictures', 'practice', 'reading', 'counting', 'things', 'were', 'FUN', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'was', 'not.Without', 'getting', 'details', 'plot', 'voices', 'well', 'done', 'famous', 'actors', 'animation', 'nice', 'drawings', 'mime', 'naturalism', 'suffice', 'say', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'film', 'children', '10-11', 'years', 'old', 'Reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'suitable', 'younger', 'kids', 'simply', 'have', 'been', 'away', 'company', 'young', 'children', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'company', 'ones', 'conditioned', 'be', 'unafraid', 'type', 'imagery', 'child', 'therapist', 'must', 'say', 'latter', 'possibility', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'interns', 'future', 'development', 'ability', 'discriminate', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'media', 'film', 'been', 'extraordinary', 'fans', 'detailed', 'animation', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'penguinism', 'fans', 'documentary', 'showing', 'real', 'penguins', 'March', 'Penguins', 'FAR', 'superior', 'much', 'same', 'material', 'sans', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'requirement', 'created', 'adventure', 'unnaturally', 'frightening', 'images.I', 'penguins', 'pandas', 'are', 'perhaps', 'cutest', 'animals', 'world', 'kids', 'love', 'too', 'venue', 'film', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'as', 'frightened', 'production', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'young', 'children.One', 'final', 'word', 'were', 'leaving', 'could', 'hear', 'many', 'young', 'children', 'theater', 'complaining', 'being', 'scared', 'beginning', 'cry', 'were', 'aware', 'parents', 'adults', 'who', 'were', 'were', 'not', 'picking', 'up', 'heartfelt', 'honest', 'cue', 'were', 'staying', 'there', 'Ultimately', 'concerned', 'more', 'inappropriateness', 'film', 'young', 'children', 'Adults', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'them.If', 'kids', 'are', '10', '-11', 'years', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'scare', 'lot', 'cute', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'couple', 'hours', 'spent', 'not', 'find', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'describe', 'fright', 'fun', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'scared', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

Lending some moral superiority to penguins which eat fish (and hence is a predator), while not extending the same respect to seals and whales is wrong-headed at best.

We've got animated films that contain talking penguins (no surprise there). We've got Surf's Up, Madagascar 1 & 2, and now this. Here we have Happy Feet, which is obviously a CGI family film. But what's wrong with it? Well, I can think of a few. First, it's very anti-religious. I'm an agnostic, and I found the overall message to the second half of the movie very insulting. It's like one of those worthless hypocritical messages that you see on The Church Channel; this is just as bad. Second, the songs are very out of place. Many of the songs contain sexual innuendo. I don't care what kids do (they can do whatever they want), but don't you think that this is a bit too much? And lastly, these penguins are so ANNOYING! Everything about them, from their voices to their dancing, is always on the top level of annoyance. But hey, this is still a family feature, and we all love dancing penguins, don't we?But there is still a plus side for Happy Feet.

So naturally his parents are ashamed, his peers are cruel, and his societal elders disapprove.  So poor Rudolph, uh, that is poor Mumble sets out on a dangerous journey in which he encounters other assorted oddballs and discovers that the oddity others have condemned is the talent required to Save the Day.Sounds pretty innocuous if not particularly original, doesn't it?  Well, the first problem is that in what can only be considered a deliberate (and utterly gratuitous) dig, the Emperor Penguin societal elders are portrayed as deeply religious in a way obviously patterned after Christian Fundamentalism; in other words they are portrayed rather broadly as a bunch of dangerous loons.Hardee-har-har.Second, the penguins are suffering from a food shortage caused by, you guessed it, EVIL mankind, so of course it falls to Mumble to somehow find a way to communicate the penguins' plight to Man, which of course he eventually does.  In fact this totally unrealistic ending is part of my problem with the film.  No, I don't mean the idea of intelligent penguins finding some way to communicate with us.  That is MUCH more believable than the jaw-dropper of having the United Nations in this day and age actually DO something about a world problem, if you call putting up a ""no fishing"" sign around Antarctica to be enforced by nothing apparently ""doing something"".  And I don't suppose it ever occurred to the filmmakers that their film is essentially advocating ending a penguin famine by replacing it with a HUMAN famine.  On second thought it probably did, but since the people most likely to starve as a result are dark-skinned people living on another continent, who cares?If they'd left out the Christian-bashing, I might have been a lot more tolerant of the (for these days) relatively mild environmental wacko message.  However, I DO think that any time you propose that Man stop eating something, especially very large amounts of something, you should be required to deal with the consequences in your story.  If you think a little mass starvation would be a GOOD thing for Mankind (""thin out the herd""), you should have the courage to admit it.  If on the other hand you simply haven't bothered to think things out that far, maybe you SHOULD... before you start preaching... to a bunch of children.Note: it has since been pointed out to me that the environmental wackos responsible for this movie got a MAJOR plot point completely wrong.  Remember the nearly indestructible ring carrier that Lovelace (Robin Williams) gets stuck around his neck?  It is no longer possible.  Since the late 1980's, advances in plastics technology have made them COMPLETELY photodegradable -- in other words when exposed to sun, wind, and rain, they fall apart, even when floating in water.

One was the documentary ""March of the Penguins"" and the other was ""Happy Feet."" I reviewed the ""March"" DVD and gave it five stars. Amazing film! Next came ""Happy Feet.""""Happy Feet"" is an amazing movie to be sure, but only in one way. The animation is simply awesome. Some of the scenes look so realistic that it's hard to believe it's an animation. In places, the Antarctic landscape looks totally real and the penguins can hardly be distinguished from real Emperor penguins until they start singing and dancing and going through their absurd antics. The animation is really a remarkable feat! I feel like I'll never know what to believe when watching a movie from this time on. No wonder it got an academy award!The content of this remarkable movie, however, was sappy. Sappy, sappy, sappy. The story was weak, to say the least. No it was more than weak; it was ludicrous. How anyone could mix animation this marvelous with a plot this vapid is beyond me. What were they thinking? I don't know, maybe kids might enjoy it. Maybe it's a movie made especially for kids. Who knows? The music was engaging, but the whole story was so insipid that it ruled out any significant enjoyment of the movie. I sat there watching and listening in awe, and feeling ill as the story rolled out. Strange combination. Hmmmmm. Maybe it would have been better with the sound turned off.I'm sorry, folks. Maybe I shouldn't have watched the documentary first. Maybe the right way is to watch the cartoon first. Live in a fantasy world, where penguins walk around behaving like humans and dance and sing. It's an interesting thought. Then watch the ""March"" documentary and see the conditions as they really are.Gary Peterson",2,Sappy Feat.,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,1766,"['recently', 'viewed', 'two', 'movies', 'DVD', 'regarding', 'Emperor', 'penguins', 'One', 'was', 'documentary', 'March', 'Penguins', 'other', 'was', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'reviewed', 'March', 'DVD', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'Amazing', 'film', 'Next', 'came', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'amazing', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'animation', 'simply', 'awesome', 'scenes', 'look', 'so', 'realistic', 'hard', 'believe', 'animation', 'places', 'Antarctic', 'landscape', 'totally', 'real', 'penguins', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'distinguished', 'real', 'Emperor', 'penguins', 'start', 'singing', 'dancing', 'going', 'absurd', 'antics', 'animation', 'really', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'feel', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'time', 'wonder', 'got', 'academy', 'award', 'content', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'sappy', 'Sappy', 'sappy', 'sappy', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'more', 'weak', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', 'mix', 'animation', 'marvelous', 'plot', 'vapid', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'kids', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'made', 'especially', 'kids', 'Who', 'music', 'was', 'engaging', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'insipid', 'ruled', 'out', 'significant', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'sat', 'watching', 'listening', 'awe', 'feeling', 'ill', 'story', 'rolled', 'out', 'Strange', 'combination', 'Hmmmmm', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'sound', 'turned', 'off.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'folks', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'watched', 'documentary', 'first', 'Maybe', 'right', 'way', 'watch', 'cartoon', 'first', 'Live', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'penguins', 'walk', 'behaving', 'humans', 'dance', 'sing', 'interesting', 'thought', 'Then', 'watch', 'March', 'documentary', 'see', 'conditions', 'really', 'are.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

I had such a good time with this film! HAPPY FEET is breathtaking and, like the best of animated films, successfully marries a sense of fun, cuteness, and charm, guaranteed to enchant the young, with a more sophisticated, darker layer which will satisfy the young-at-heart and maybe even make them reflect a bit. HAPPY FEET is an effective fusion of music, humor, and poignancy. It's part coming-of-age story, part heroic quest, and part commentary on staid, rigidly structured societies. And it is all musical. Most will be familiar with the finger-snapping, head-bobbing tunes, including the classic chorus from ""The Message."" Robin Williams (""My Way""), Brittany Murphy (""Somebody to Love"" & ""Boogie Wonderland""), Nicole Kidman (""Kiss""), and Hugh Jackman (""Heartbreak Hotel"") offer up their own song renditions. Whether they do their musical numbers justice is wholly up to the viewer's discretion. Meanwhile, Mumble's tap dancing is gloriously brought to life on screen, thanks to the motion-capture work done by heralded tap dancer Savion Glover.Be cautioned that this film isn't quite in the same happy-go-lucky vein as the recent CARS, OVER THE HEDGE, THE WILD, and FLUSHED AWAY. Yes, the humor is there, as well as the familiar family-oriented sensibilities, but Director George Miller injects HAPPY FEET with more depth than normally found in animation (THE INCREDIBLES aside). This film has pretty dark sequences and several legitimate ""boo!"" moments, as the key characters are occasionally placed in harrowing danger, which might elicit a frightened gasp or an ""Oh, no!"" from the young 'uns. The vast, open, icy expanses of Antarctica lend an aura of grandeur and make the fairly solemn core storyline more credible. Now I'm not really a fan of message films - and HAPPY FEET's key plotline does hinge heavily on the penguins' environmental woes as caused by humans - but this film manages to weave its points seamlessly enough into the story, as opposed to heavy-handedly hammering it home.The plot: Maybe it's because he was dropped while still in his egg, but  Mumble (Elijah Wood), from the moment he hatched, has displayed a penchant for displaying happy feet, in the form of tap, an activity fiercely frowned upon by the penguin hierarchy as being quite undignified. To make it worse for Mumble, he can't sing a proper note, which is a severe dilemma. For without a heartsong, how will he find his  true love? From the get-go, Mumble becomes an outcast, an Emperor penguin forever toe-tapping on the fringes and treated with scorn by his peers. Even his father Memphis (Hugh Jackman) is embarassed of him and strives to make over Mumble into a more stately-shambling citizen. But there's a graver concern in the offing, which affects the entire penguin population: fish is getting harder to find. When the aged community patriarch Noah (Hugo Weaving) blames the scarcity of food on Mumble's unconventional tapping, which supposedly has angered the penguin deity, Mumble vows to seek the reason for the fish's disappearance and begins his odyssey. Initially accompanied by five wise-cracking, fun-loving Adelie penguins (with Mexican accents) who call themselves the Amigos and who think Mumble is accidentally cool, Mumble ultimately finds himself alone as he confronts the source of his community's fish depletion - us.The voice cast is perfectly good and doesn't get in the way of the pretty pictures. The ever-lively Robin Williams, who plays three characters here (Lovelace, Cletus, and the scene-stealing Ramon), is actually back to being funny. And, with CG animation that is drop-dead AMAZING and is guaranteed to make your jaw drop, HAPPY FEET is hands down the best animated film I've seen in years.",5,"""Hello from Emperorland!""",1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,3824,"['Awwwww', 'cute', 'Man', 'baby', 'penguins', 'were', 'so', 'freakin', 'adorable', 'especially', 'blue-eyed', 'Mumble', 'had', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'breathtaking', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'successfully', 'sense', 'fun', 'cuteness', 'charm', 'guaranteed', 'enchant', 'young', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'darker', 'layer', 'will', 'satisfy', 'young-at-heart', 'maybe', 'even', 'make', 'reflect', 'bit', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'effective', 'fusion', 'music', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'part', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'part', 'heroic', 'quest', 'part', 'commentary', 'staid', 'rigidly', 'structured', 'societies', 'musical', 'Most', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'finger-snapping', 'head-bobbing', 'tunes', 'including', 'classic', 'chorus', 'Message', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Way', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'Boogie', 'Wonderland', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Kiss', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Heartbreak', 'Hotel', 'offer', 'up', 'own', 'song', 'renditions', 'do', 'musical', 'numbers', 'justice', 'wholly', 'up', 'viewer', 'discretion', 'Meanwhile', 'Mumble', 'tap', 'dancing', 'gloriously', 'brought', 'life', 'screen', 'thanks', 'motion-capture', 'work', 'done', 'heralded', 'tap', 'dancer', 'Savion', 'Glover.Be', 'cautioned', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'happy-go-lucky', 'vein', 'recent', 'CARS', 'HEDGE', 'THE', 'WILD', 'FLUSHED', 'AWAY', 'Yes', 'humor', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'familiar', 'family-oriented', 'sensibilities', 'Director', 'George', 'Miller', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'more', 'depth', 'normally', 'found', 'animation', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'aside', 'film', 'pretty', 'dark', 'sequences', 'several', 'legitimate', 'boo', 'moments', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'occasionally', 'placed', 'harrowing', 'danger', 'might', 'elicit', 'frightened', 'gasp', 'Oh', 'young', ""'uns"", 'vast', 'open', 'icy', 'expanses', 'Antarctica', 'lend', 'aura', 'grandeur', 'make', 'fairly', 'solemn', 'core', 'storyline', 'more', 'credible', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'message', 'films', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'key', 'plotline', 'hinge', 'heavily', 'penguins', 'environmental', 'woes', 'caused', 'humans', 'film', 'weave', 'points', 'seamlessly', 'enough', 'story', 'opposed', 'heavy-handedly', 'hammering', 'home.The', 'plot', 'Maybe', 'was', 'dropped', 'still', 'egg', 'Mumble', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'moment', 'hatched', 'displayed', 'penchant', 'displaying', 'happy', 'feet', 'form', 'tap', 'activity', 'fiercely', 'frowned', 'penguin', 'hierarchy', 'being', 'quite', 'undignified', 'make', 'worse', 'Mumble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'proper', 'note', 'severe', 'dilemma', 'heartsong', 'how', 'will', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'get-go', 'Mumble', 'outcast', 'Emperor', 'penguin', 'forever', 'toe-tapping', 'fringes', 'treated', 'scorn', 'peers', 'Even', 'father', 'Memphis', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'embarassed', 'strives', 'make', 'over', 'Mumble', 'more', 'stately-shambling', 'citizen', 'graver', 'concern', 'offing', 'entire', 'penguin', 'population', 'fish', 'getting', 'harder', 'find', 'When', 'aged', 'community', 'patriarch', 'Noah', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'scarcity', 'food', 'Mumble', 'unconventional', 'tapping', 'supposedly', 'angered', 'penguin', 'deity', 'Mumble', 'vows', 'seek', 'reason', 'fish', 'disappearance', 'odyssey', 'Initially', 'accompanied', 'five', 'wise-cracking', 'fun-loving', 'Adelie', 'penguins', 'Mexican', 'accents', 'who', 'call', 'Amigos', 'who', 'think', 'Mumble', 'accidentally', 'cool', 'Mumble', 'ultimately', 'alone', 'source', 'community', 'fish', 'depletion', 'us.The', 'voice', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'good', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'ever-lively', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'three', 'characters', 'here', 'Lovelace', 'Cletus', 'scene-stealing', 'Ramon', 'actually', 'back', 'being', 'funny', 'CG', 'animation', 'drop-dead', 'AMAZING', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'jaw', 'drop', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'animated', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years']",N/A

It appeals to adults because there are paths in the story that adults can appreciate (it goes over kids' heads most of the time). It is visually stunning and the acting is very good. Yes some characters are stereotypes but they are meant to be like that so the actors should not be criticized for what they were told to do. The story is not just a simple one-dimensional path from beginning to climax to end. There are several themes that are intertwined throughout the whole movie from discrimination, how environmental changes put stresses on animal populations, and how music and dance are both very deep forms of communication (Well... human communication but that's why it's a kid's film!). People unfairly criticize this film because they were not expecting such a detailed plot coming into a kid's movie. Don't be chained to your expectations and accept it for what it is--a very detailed movie that's really more for adults to understand than kids.On this note--the rating systems for movies and video games are there for a reason. They give a parent or guardian a general idea what age group can handle it. Now I think that separation by age is not the answer, that it has to do with maturity which varies from child to child. But if your child is 4 YEARS OLD what the heck are you doing showing them a movie that's designed for kids at least 7 and older?! Wow... Give yourself a bad rating for ignoring ratings and not doing your research as a parent! On the other hand, kids under age ten probably have no idea that all this stuff is going on until you make a big deal about it. But the problem is that kids will see this material sooner or later so exposure with a parent is better than none but the movie is not offensive at all! If you watch any non-fiction tv channel like discovery or history channel you will see WAY worse stuff like, HEAVEN FORBID, animals mating or something. LOL. Even commercials on any channel are much worse than this stuff so it's really all exaggerated by really sheltering parents. I still don't know how the whole thing about penguins trying to find mates with absolutely no ""bad"" images and with lyrics that barely allude to sex (which kids hear EVERYWHERE unless you chain them to their bedroom door with no tv or radio or internet...or ANYTHING to do) is so bad...

The weight of the world falls on the shoulders of Mumble, the ""ugly duckling"" of the brood, who has his rhythm in his feet rather than his voice.

648769,A2BC978GQQEA2A,B00005JPCF,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[5, 12]","""Happy Feet"", written by Warren Coleman, John Collee, George Miller & Judy Morris; directed by George Miller.Computer technology continues to advance in filmmaking, creating vivid tableaus with a staggering amount of detail. It's unfortunate, then, that the stories beneath the polish are increasingly wispy. In the case of ""Happy Feet"", the latest bid for the family filmgoing box office, it's primarily ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"", but inflated to staggering proportions. Does a simple story of a plucky misfit penguin really need to start with a cosmic zoom from outer space?Swooping through hordes of singing waterfowl, the camera focuses on two crooning lovers - Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) who fall in love, conveniently, during mating season. It's not clear why Elvis and Marilyn are evoked here, beyond the fact that their personalities (as well as their romance) are plug-and-play. Before long, Mama's off to find food, leaving Dad with egg duty. Since most of this is covered more effectively in ""March Of the Penguins"", it's shorthanded here. Even Memphis' accident - he drops his egg, but recovers it before it freezes - evokes little in the way of drama. Happily, it still hatches when the weather breaks, but something is amiss. Little Mumble (as he's later called) taps and shuffles his webbed feet incessantly, to the horror of the others.We learn that all the singing is critical to cartoon penguins - it's how they express themselves, especially to prospective mates. Not only does this have nothing to do with real penguin behavior, it robs Mumble's quirk of any real contrast. Why is dancing anathema to singing penguins, aside from the fact that it'll dovetail into a love duet with Mumble's childhood friend Gloria later on? Rather than stick with the misfit angle, it turns out that penguins are superstitious - they think Mumble's tapping is affecting the local fish population - it's low, and folks are hungry and worried.At any rate, the motley bunch of arbitrary ethnicities soon send Mumble out on his own tiny ice floe, just like Rudolph. He then finds new friends in a distant community of Latino penguins, led by feisty, diminutive Ram&oacute;n (the voice of every secondary character in animation, Robin Williams). Some shtick ensues, and the film then takes a turn into ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest"" territory.They've all run across evidence that there's more to the region than the local flora and fauna, so they troop off to learn more from the local playboy/guru, Lovelace (also voiced by Williams). He's evasive, but we eventually learn that, yes, Man has entered the forest. A nearby oil refinery is the real culprit, not tap dancing. How can Mumble - netted up for his trouble, and now ensconced in a Sea-World-esque aquarium - convince men not to overfish in the region? Naturally, by the very thing that made him an outcast. We don't really see, though, how his dancing convinced the zoo owners - Mumble simply returns home with a tracking device on his back. Once the trackers spot the entire community desperately tapping in unison, the U.N. lowers the boom, and equilibrium is restored. End on a shot of our happy planet.Computer penguins can be appealing, but they've got nothing on the real thing. The production is lavish - the cloud work is lovely, the oil refinery is a wealth of rusty patina, and the sense of scale is impressive - but the story has little emotional weight or cohesion, even for a cartoon. The middle section, where Mumble finds his footing with Ram&oacute;n, is the most entertaining - Ram&oacute;n and his friends act the most like real penguins, waddling about with their flippers in mid-air. Mumble towers above his new pals with an endearing gawkiness. The animation positions itself between anthropomorphism and realism, with mixed results. The voice work, aside from Mr. Williams, is mostly marquee value - the leads bring little to the dramatic or musical proceedings.""Happy Feet"" is a step up from the awkward ""Babe: A Pig In The City"", but it's dispiriting to see George Miller seem so at-odds with filmmaking after the vitality and confidence of his ""Road Warrior"" pictures.

My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it. You know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins exclude him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realizes that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death.The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily one of the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accidents and sessions of improvisation.Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story is good. Children will enjoy the clever animation and fun music. The story is a bit too detailed for younger children but the older members of the family will follow it. The movie is longer than what most children will sit through but the love story is endearing and the adventure is thrilling. If you liked March of the Penguin's, you'll love this movie. Even if you didn't like March of the Penguin's, Happy Feet still offers plenty to enjoy.",3,[3.5]-Happy Feet is cute and it's all about the dancing penguins.,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,2367,"['first', 'half', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'imagery', 'extraordinary', 'only', 'problem', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'crammed', 'know', 'Mumble', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'when', 'arrive', 'Earth', 'film', 'grand', 'job', 'making', 'other', 'penguins', 'exclude', 'lack', 'singing', 'skill', 'quickly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'young', 'Mumble', 'who', 'thrust', 'nasty', 'world', 'straight', 'birth', 'start', 'film', 'very', 'touching', 'comedy', 'general', 'interest', 'therefore', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'continued', 'way', 'forever', 'quickly', 'changed', 'film', 'being', 'best', 'having', 'Mumble', 'teenager', 'then', 'people', 'are', 'sick', 'uniqueness', 'now', 'making', 'others', 'feel', 'humiliated', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'way', 'early', 'death.The', 'film', 'started', 'have', 'more', 'comedy', 'point', 'thank', 'God', 'Latino', 'penguins', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'could', 'hardly', 'even', 'be', 'called', 'comedy', 'meant', 'be', 'touching', 'action', 'extremely', 'high-octane', 'when', 'penguins', 'slide', 'down', 'cliffs', 'sea', 'overwhelming', 'experience', 'silver', 'screen', 'may', 'even', 'thrill', 'film', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'important', 'message', 'generally', 'effective', 'characters', 'script', 'animation', 'brilliant', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'beautiful', 'truly', 'bar', 'animation', 'future', 'film', 'full', 'star-studded', 'voice', 'talents', 'youthful', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'irresistibly', 'comedic', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'audience', 'feast', 'accidents', 'sessions', 'improvisation.Happy', 'Feet', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'monumental', 'film', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'effect', 'environmental', 'problems', 'suffer', 'now', 'animation', 'story', 'good', 'Children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'clever', 'animation', 'fun', 'music', 'story', 'bit', 'too', 'detailed', 'younger', 'children', 'older', 'members', 'family', 'will', 'follow', 'movie', 'longer', 'what', 'most', 'children', 'will', 'sit', 'love', 'story', 'endearing', 'adventure', 'thrilling', 'liked', 'March', 'Penguin', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'March', 'Penguin', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'still', 'plenty', 'enjoy']",N/A

There are references to mating, sex (Salt n Peppa's song that says Let's talk about sex) and another song says I just need your body. I began to ask myself just who this movie was made for. Also, I just wouldn't own a movie that goes as far as Happy Feet does on this whole pushing a big, left wing political agenda. First, it makes the older penguins look like fundamental Christians and displays them as sticks in the mud trapped in tradition to the point that it's causing the penguin population to suffer. So, you can see how Hollywood views Christians (or those they believe to be Christians) and constantly makes fun of them.  Second, I understand being responsible and taking care of the earth. But, since when do animals come before humans that humans should completely stop consuming a certain resource (fish) and give them all to the penguins? It's just ridiculous. I'm sure PETA applauds this one, but I don't. If the message was don't overfish, then I would be fine with that. But, the message is clearly a very narrow minded, extreme liberal agenda. I just wish Hollywood Studios could come out with a kid's film that wasn't anti-Christian and without their version of environmental awareness and maybe just have a simple moral to the story such as treat each other kindly, don't be bullies or be generous or something like that?

648784,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005JPCF,John F. Rooney,"[1, 3]","""Happy Feet"" is a feel good animated movie musical about an Emperor penguin who can't sing at all unlike the rest of his colony. He's an outcast who is a terrific tap dancer. Having seen Savion Glover perform his tap dancing feats on the stage, I knew he was the one whose idiosyncratic dancing style was used as the model for Mumble, the dancing penguin.People should see this movie in tandem with ""March of the Penguins,"" the documentary about real penguins, so they can see how carefully the makers of this movie were in portraying accurately the behavioral traits of penguins. Real people appear in later scenes of the movie because human beings are endangering the penguin population by overfishing in the Antarctica and elsewhere. Mumble, of course, has to stop them from this anti-penguin activity.Mumble is the proverbial outsider, the loner who can't do what his brethren can do. After being ostracized from his own colony he joins five Adelie penguins and one Rockhopper penguin who happens to have the voice of Robin Williams. The swimming sequences and the run-in's with predators add excitement to the film. Thousands of computerized, animated penguins are shown in singing or dance segments. Few viewers are going to be bored by this film that won an Academy Award in 2007 for best animated feature.

648785,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JPCF,John Kwok,"[4, 10]","Without question, the current success enjoyed by ""Happy Feet"" owes much to the great French documentary ""March Of The Penguins"", though I strongly suspect that this fine animated film was well in the works prior to news of the documentary film's release. Australian film director George Miller, best known for his ""Mad Max"" films and ""Babe"", has created a delightful, charming film about what it means to be different - and celebrating that difference - featuring some of the best animation I have seen lately not done by Pixar Studios. And I might add too that Miller has done a decent job in choosing pop songs for the film's music, sung well by the likes of Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Brittany Murphy (Without a doubt, Miller is paying homage to fellow Australian Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"", and nearly suceeds in pulling off his own musical highwire act in this film.). Elijah Wood's loveable young Emperor Penguin, Mumbles, nearly steals every scene he is in, except when he interacts with Jackass Penguins Ramon and Lovelace (Both voiced to dazzling hilarious effect by Robin Williams.). I say ""Bah Humbug"" to those who've dislked this charming little animated film; it's dual uplifting messages of celebrating those who are different from the rest of the pack and helping to preserve Antarctica from overfishing are those which are not only timely, but more importantly, worthy of attention to entire families. Moreover, the ""adult"" pop songs are used to such great comedic effect, that only those familiar with Prince's music, for example, might find their usage in this film a bit too risque for the entire family to enjoy.

Their list of issues is nearly identical to mine.There's only a couple of things I would add.Why did the Adelie penguins speak with a heavily urban Hispanic accent? Of all that made no sense in this film, that reigned supreme. (You also might wonder why Lovelace has a name like Lovelace when others have names like Ramon. And why, if all they give him is pebbles, is he so fat?)Penguins with heavy English or Scottish accents (the elders of the Emperor penguins) were closed minded idiots.You can't have multiple accents in a film - especially when one accent represents blindness, the other open mindedness - and not be making a comment. Yet I'm perfectly certain that the producers of the film were NOT making any kind of social commentary whatsoever based on the distribution of accents. That's what makes it so puzzling.That and Mumble's name (the other Emperor Penguins had ""normal"" names), and his blue eyes - again, something that no Emperor Penguin shared - that used to be cute when Elijah Wood was a child actor but are either mesmerizing or freakish, depending on how you look at them.",2,Mixed messages,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,1190,"['S.', 'Nay', 'Spotlight', 'Review', 'entitled', 'Nothing', 'Happy', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'right', 'money', 'list', 'issues', 'nearly', 'identical', 'mine.There', 'only', 'couple', 'things', 'would', 'add.Why', 'did', 'Adelie', 'speak', 'heavily', 'urban', 'Hispanic', 'accent', 'made', 'sense', 'film', 'reigned', 'supreme', 'also', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'Lovelace', 'name', 'Lovelace', 'when', 'others', 'have', 'names', 'Ramon', 'why', 'give', 'pebbles', 'so', 'fat', 'heavy', 'English', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'elders', 'Emperor', 'penguins', 'were', 'closed', 'minded', 'idiots.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'multiple', 'accents', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'accent', 'blindness', 'other', 'open', 'mindedness', 'not', 'be', 'making', 'comment', ""'m"", 'perfectly', 'certain', 'producers', 'film', 'were', 'NOT', 'making', 'kind', 'social', 'commentary', 'based', 'distribution', 'accents', 'what', 'puzzling.That', 'Mumble', 'name', 'other', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'had', 'normal', 'names', 'blue', 'eyes', 'again', 'something', 'Emperor', 'Penguin', 'shared', 'used', 'be', 'cute', 'when', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'was', 'child', 'actor', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'freakish', 'depending', 'how', 'look']",N/A

We also weren't crazy about the abrupt transitions from penguin antics to road trips with the ""guru"" penguin to save-the-whales speeches (admittedly subtle).Not much in the way of extras except for a clip with tap dancer Savion Glover, but there's one little gem: ""I Love to Singa"", a classic Looney Tune from the '30s featuring jazz-singing ""Owl Jolson"".

Trying to teach that it's OK to be yourself while simultaneously promoting the dangers of commercial marine harvesting while also telling the story of a little lost Antarctic penguin who travels to, apparently, Orlando's Sea World and back is, let's face it, a lot to cover in a children's film, especially when it's packed with Beach Boys, Prince and Stevie Wonder songs whose lyrics have nothing to do with any of those things.However, the movie does work on some levels. Your kids will identify with Mumble, the film's outcast lead character who eventually wins over his peers, and the top-tapping dance numbers are so catchy they make the movie easy for parents to sit through. (By the way, Mumble is plenty cute and cuddly, so you might well load up that shopping cart -- Amazon sellsHappy Feet Dancing Mumble,Sababa Happy Feet Mumble's Tumble Game, evenHappy Feet Mumble Dress-Up Outfit.)Overall, the film is a good companion toMarch of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition).The bonus features aren't bad, either. A five-minute video offers a serious tap-dancing lesson from Savion Glover, whose moves were used in the film.

Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hugh Jackman, Brittany Murphy, and Nicole Kidman head up the cast of ""Happy Feet.""  It all starts innocently enough.  A young penguin is born ""different"" and instead of having a song in his heart, it lands in his feet.  He's treated as an outcast and eventually gets lost during a first swim.  He runs into a group of Latino penguins (headed up by Williams) who show him that being different isn't all that bad.Then the story takes a dark, preachy turn.  **SPOILERS**  Our young hero finds out that evil aliens (humans) are taking all of the fish from his family's lands.  He sets out to stop them and ends up in a zoo, where he loses his song.  Eventually, he finds hope in the eyes of a child and just by dancing tilts the world on its axis and makes the big, bad fishing companies end all fishing!Unbelieveable, PETA-like propaganda, and a rather boring story make for a very dull adult viewing experience.  My daughter loved the parts where all of the cutesy-wutesy penguins danced, but became somewhat terrified by the ""evil"" of the humans.  It's amazing at how great the lengths were for this film to preach to the masses.  It's funny how they decided to teach their propaganda to a group of children at an age when they are most easily influenced.  This film would have been great if they had kept the atmosphere light.  Instead, they tried to push off their propaganda on the crowd.  Folks, I don't know about you, but when I want to be preached to, I go to church.One thing that amazed me was how they tried so hard to make man look evil for stealing all of the fish, yet no one spoke up for the fish in the film.  Also, why did that seal have to look so vicious?  I thought tree-huggers and the anti-fur crowd hated it when baby seals are clubbed to death.  In this flick, if any seal deserved a good clubbing, it was the one after our little hero.Others have stated that the music used in this film was sex-laden.  Yes, it was, but I don't think that was as much of an obvious thing to the kiddies as was the ""man bad, nature good"" sermon.  Also, I can see where many viewers saw a connection between Mumbles being different and a person being gay.  I also picked up on the whole anti-Christian bit, but it seemed as more of an attack on Catholicism in particular than Christianity as a whole.This was the first film that I've walked out of in a long time angry.  I felt cheated out of my money in order to hear how horrible man is.  I'll give it three stars since the animation was wonderful and the kids really loved the ""dancing penguin"" aspect of this film.

Mumble is the son of two emperor penguins that both have beautiful singing voices. The emperor penguin uses song to find a mate, so it's important that they learn from an early age to sing from their heart so that they can find their one true love. Unfortunately for Mumble, he can't sing. Not just can't sing well, but can't sing at all, to the point where the penguins' vocal coach--who has never turned down a case--throws up her hands in defeat when he tries. Instead, Mumble has another talent. He likes to dance. His ""happy feet"" make him stick out like a sore thumb and cause him to be an outcast in the penguin community. Like Mumble's father says, dancing ""just ain't penguin."" Happy Feet is the story of Mumble's struggle to find a way to fit in with the rest of the crowd.Having just watched March of the Penguins, Happy Feet was such a welcome change from the sad tale of how harsh life is for these animals. The entire time I watched MotP, I kept wondering what in the world sustains these male penguins as they stand in the freezing cold protecting these eggs. In Happy Feet, the answer is song. The male penguins huddle together for warmth, singing their heart song, and wait for their mates to return. It's romantic and endearing at the same time.

I dont understand why when movies attempt to show what humans do to other people/animals, people get outraged and hate the movie. Its all true, and thats why Happy Feet is a good movie.So movie is about this penguin (Mumble) who is born ""different"". Instead of singing, he can dance. He is somewhat of an outcast and when he ventures too far, he meets a different kind of penguin species that dont mind his ""happy feet"".

648819,A3GTF3Q8KJ265C,B00005JPCF,K. Williams,"[18, 26]","Many customers consider reviews before making a purchase. If ratings are consistently positive or negative, they have a good idea of the film's value. Occasionally such reviews, like polar caps, form on two ends of the spectrum. I used to rate everything -- not just movies -- as either totally great or absolutely horrible. After reading a helpfulbookand later, studyingfuzzy logicfor a programming project, I realized that the world is not just black and white. Even Penguins have gray.Taking a purely mathematical approach and averaging the results of extremes, one finds that the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. HAPPY FEET, with its polar votes, must be averaged at three. From here, personal sensibilities have a profound effect. Notice how preconceived expectations, personal morality, and environment affect overall impression.Though mating and song are motivation for the preservation of life in penguins and most animals, anthropomorphism in animation of the same with innuendoes makes it appear vulgar (even if they are only rubbing necks) -- offending one's sense of morality. Parents assuming 'all animation is good for kids' might be surprised when, after viewing the film with small children, they discover, as mentioned beneath the MPAA rating, ""Mild Peril and Rude Humor"" is really in the film. Therefore, to justify preconceived expectations, they must deduct a point from the average. Someone exposed to racial stereotyping can be offended because a Caucasian comedian provides voiceovers for a character with anEast L.A.Spanish accent or because a particularly dark penguin named Lovelace acts and sounds like a sanctimonious Barry White (which may be a play on the animal's actual colors). Those who look to animation as a diversion from world problems may be disturbed when a social issue rears its ugly head. Expect anyone in these groups to rate the film less than three.On the other hand, more lighthearted viewers who love song, dance or cute and cuddly animals add points to the average. Perhaps there are no children in the home or they may be impressed by the quality of animation. Favorite songs may bring back fond memories. Hence, we have reviews nearing the maximum number of favorable votes.When I saw HAPPY FEET, it first appeared to be an animated version ofMARCH OF THE PENGUINS. The singing, dancing, and humor eases acceptance of positive moral and social issues. Years ago, the intent of animation was to ""characterize"" subjects; with exaggerated features, they were supposed to look funny. Today's high-tech CGI animation can be both impressive and intimidating when animation migrates to reality. In my opinion, as an artist myself, Warner Bros. swung the pendulum too far with frighteningly realistic rendering of the killer whale and various seals with near-death experiences. I agree with others that the plot has too many directions. There's the whole story of how penguins use unique song to find their mates after long periods of deprivation; prejudice for not being able to do what everyone else does and for looking different is depicted; ""the circle of life"" as animals prey on one another, the pollution of oceans, man's encroachment on ecosystems by stripping marine life of its food source, and captivity of animals is all there. Whew! The veil of humor made it easier to accept but I personally felt somewhat exhausted after my first viewing. So the vote, based solely on my opinion, does not stray from the center.However, another member of this household absolutely LOVED IT -- going to the theater three times and being personally responsible for at least 15 movie tickets. Her insistence moved me to purchase the DVD so it must have redeeming qualities worth another point -- hence the total vote of four stars.What I get from all this is that your enjoyment of the film cannot be based on someone else's sensibilities. Learn the facts about the film (as I have attempted to objectively provide) and make a determination based on your background whether it appeals to you.",4,Why some may be unhappy in their seats,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,4037,"['Many', 'customers', 'consider', 'reviews', 'making', 'purchase', 'ratings', 'are', 'consistently', 'positive', 'negative', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'film', 'value', 'Occasionally', 'such', 'reviews', 'polar', 'caps', 'form', 'two', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'used', 'rate', 'everything', 'not', 'just', 'movies', 'totally', 'great', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'reading', 'helpfulbookand', 'later', 'studyingfuzzy', 'programming', 'project', 'realized', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'black', 'white', 'Even', 'Penguins', 'have', 'gray.Taking', 'purely', 'mathematical', 'approach', 'averaging', 'results', 'extremes', 'one', 'sweet', 'spot', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'polar', 'votes', 'must', 'be', 'averaged', 'three', 'here', 'personal', 'sensibilities', 'have', 'profound', 'effect', 'Notice', 'how', 'preconceived', 'expectations', 'personal', 'morality', 'environment', 'affect', 'overall', 'mating', 'song', 'are', 'motivation', 'preservation', 'life', 'penguins', 'most', 'animals', 'anthropomorphism', 'animation', 'same', 'innuendoes', 'appear', 'vulgar', 'even', 'are', 'only', 'rubbing', 'necks', 'offending', 'one', 'sense', 'morality', 'Parents', 'assuming', 'animation', 'good', 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'viewing', 'film', 'small', 'children', 'discover', 'mentioned', 'MPAA', 'rating', 'Mild', 'Peril', 'Rude', 'Humor', 'really', 'film', 'Therefore', 'justify', 'preconceived', 'expectations', 'must', 'deduct', 'point', 'average', 'Someone', 'exposed', 'racial', 'stereotyping', 'can', 'be', 'offended', 'Caucasian', 'comedian', 'voiceovers', 'character', 'anEast', 'L.A.Spanish', 'accent', 'particularly', 'dark', 'penguin', 'named', 'Lovelace', 'acts', 'sounds', 'sanctimonious', 'Barry', 'White', 'may', 'be', 'play', 'animal', 'actual', 'colors', 'who', 'look', 'animation', 'diversion', 'world', 'problems', 'may', 'be', 'disturbed', 'when', 'social', 'issue', 'ugly', 'head', 'Expect', 'anyone', 'groups', 'rate', 'film', 'less', 'three.On', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'viewers', 'who', 'love', 'song', 'dance', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'animals', 'add', 'points', 'average', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'children', 'home', 'may', 'be', 'impressed', 'quality', 'animation', 'Favorite', 'songs', 'may', 'bring', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'Hence', 'have', 'reviews', 'nearing', 'maximum', 'number', 'favorable', 'votes.When', 'saw', 'HAPPY', 'FEET', 'first', 'appeared', 'be', 'animated', 'version', 'ofMARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'singing', 'dancing', 'humor', 'eases', 'acceptance', 'positive', 'moral', 'social', 'issues', 'Years', 'ago', 'intent', 'animation', 'was', 'characterize', 'subjects', 'exaggerated', 'features', 'were', 'supposed', 'look', 'funny', 'Today', 'high-tech', 'CGI', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'impressive', 'intimidating', 'when', 'animation', 'reality', 'opinion', 'artist', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'swung', 'pendulum', 'too', 'far', 'frighteningly', 'realistic', 'rendering', 'killer', 'whale', 'various', 'seals', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'agree', 'others', 'plot', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'whole', 'story', 'how', 'penguins', 'use', 'unique', 'song', 'find', 'mates', 'long', 'periods', 'deprivation', 'prejudice', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'looking', 'different', 'depicted', 'circle', 'life', 'animals', 'prey', 'one', 'pollution', 'oceans', 'man', 'encroachment', 'ecosystems', 'stripping', 'marine', 'life', 'food', 'source', 'captivity', 'animals', 'there', 'Whew', 'veil', 'humor', 'made', 'easier', 'accept', 'personally', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'exhausted', 'first', 'viewing', 'vote', 'based', 'solely', 'opinion', 'not', 'stray', 'center.However', 'member', 'household', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'going', 'theater', 'three', 'times', 'being', 'personally', 'responsible', 'least', '15', 'movie', 'tickets', 'insistence', 'moved', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'point', 'hence', 'total', 'vote', 'four', 'stars.What', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'based', 'someone', 'else', 'sensibilities', 'Learn', 'facts', 'film', 'have', 'attempted', 'objectively', 'provide', 'make', 'determination', 'based', 'background', 'appeals']",N/A

Some of the animation, especially the backgrounds, was drop dead gorgeous.  I don't even have HD, and I was mesmerized by how beautifully done some parts of this movie were.The misfit becomes a hero.  It hit sort of close to home for my wife and I because we have a special needs child and have often felt like Memphis and Norma Jean.  What went wrong?  We sigh a lot and wonder what will become of him.  I quietly hope he will develop some great talent some day.  We'll see.An environmental message that wasn't too heavy handed.  The humans are not presented as evil, just as being who didn't know what they were doing.  Once they discovered the penguins, they helped them out.  At least this movie didn't stoop to the now very tired ""man is bad"" cliche message.Interesting symbology.  The ""Memphis"" character was obviously Elvis, and Norma Jean was Marilyn Monroe?  The two icons of the 1950's give birth to a misfit who revolutionalizes music among a sort of authoritarian theocratic paternal oligarchy.  Is this supposed to be something like what happened when rock 'n roll took America by storm in the late 1950's and early 60's?  The fundamentalists preached against rock 'n roll, and the kids just wanted to have fun.The music itself.  I found it varied and rather enjoyable.  I've never liked that ""Somebody to Love"" song by Queen, but I genuinely enjoyed the way it was rendered by the penguin choir.Finally, extrapolating on the fact that penguin couples can identify each other out of the masses of penguins because each has a unique call.  This I assume was the inspiration for the idea that penguins mate when they find ""their song"".Now the downsides:I found the adult penguin characters to be designed in a way that didn't make them particularly endearing to look at.  I thought the penguins in Surf's Up (which anyone who likes this movie should see too; it's brilliant) were designed to look more fun and loveable.  The hint of breasts on the female penguins just made them look sort of weird.One dimensional stereotype characters.  There's the overbearing authoritarian fundamentalists, the holy roller preacher, the ""five amigo"" wise guys, the skua bird gang, etc.  There just wasn't much depth anywhere in the character department.Very little genuine humor.  A lot of what was supposed to be humor seemed forced, Disney Style.  I was entertained throughout the movie, but I only really laughed two or three times.And, one big helping of subliminal vulgarity.  I read it elsewhere and so out of curiosity I freeze framed through the sequence where Gloria and Happy Feet emerge from their first swim and tumble through the snow, and yes it lookes like they went through the catalogue of sexual positions.  That was crass, but then this movie is rated PG for a reason.  I mean, what parent would think that a fuzzy little cute baby penguin on all the artwork would mean that they should allow their young children see it?  Who would get that idea anyway?So, a solid three stars for a movie that pretends to be for the little ones but richly deserves a PG rating and perhaps PG-13.  Now, my happy keys gotta stop clickin'.

648832,A19YV8QY3NZBKL,B00005JPCF,"LivinforJesus ""Holly""","[0, 0]","Happy Feet is an enjoyable movie and definitely one of the most unique storylines i've ever seen, with alot of fun music along the way. Whomever wrote this (apparently George Miller and others) must have a really unique mind.The story features a large colony of Emperor penguins in the south pole, with the main character, Mumble, a young penguin who displays an unusual rhythmic musical talent. His parents are the kind hearted Norma Jean, and his dad, a hilarious Elvis-character named Memphis. Most penguins of Mumbles' kind display a talent for Old-English type, classical singing and are seen progressing nicely in school led by an old fashioned teacher of the same kind. Mumble is somewhat shunned in his community for being different in his dancing talent. Ironically, the penguins all appear cloned expect for Mumble, who is even a bit physically different from birth.Along the way, Mumble meets up with a group of Mexican penguins. The penguins do not understand the need for the rhythm of tap dance or soulful singing to attract a mate, and introduce Mumble to the sultry Latin styles of music and dance. Throughout the movie, a variety of song and dance is introduced from various races and ethnic groups, emphasizing that each has its own style of musical romancing to attract a mate called a ""heartsong.""As the movie progresses, Mumble will slowly win the heart of his community (and girl) with his unique style, his ""happy feet"" that can't stand still. A group of fuddy-duddy old men penguins look on to the dancing of the young penguins, and find this ""new"" style of music (akin to the blues, rock and roll, and disco in human terms) to be a religious and indecent outrage.Woven throughout the storyline is the concept that ""aliens"" (actually humans) are capturing the penguins for show in aquariums. While i love animals, i agree with the other reviewers that the enviromentalist message was overdone. Mumble is temporarily captured for the aquarium, and entertains the human visitors with his dancing. He, of course, eventually makes it back to the penguin colony (to the relief of his aging and weary father Memphis. Memphis is discourage as Mumble has broken with tradition, altho Elvis/Memphis was a blues singer himself, so it doesn't make much sense.) All's well that ends well, with Mumbles' return of himself and his happy feet.",3,Enjoyable Movie,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,2352,"['Happy', 'Feet', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'storylines', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'alot', 'fun', 'music', 'way', 'Whomever', 'wrote', 'apparently', 'George', 'Miller', 'others', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'unique', 'mind.The', 'story', 'large', 'colony', 'Emperor', 'penguins', 'south', 'pole', 'main', 'character', 'Mumble', 'young', 'penguin', 'who', 'unusual', 'rhythmic', 'musical', 'talent', 'parents', 'are', 'kind', 'hearted', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'dad', 'hilarious', 'Elvis-character', 'named', 'Memphis', 'Most', 'penguins', 'Mumbles', 'kind', 'display', 'talent', 'Old-English', 'type', 'classical', 'singing', 'are', 'seen', 'progressing', 'nicely', 'school', 'led', 'old', 'fashioned', 'teacher', 'same', 'kind', 'Mumble', 'somewhat', 'shunned', 'community', 'being', 'different', 'dancing', 'talent', 'Ironically', 'penguins', 'appear', 'cloned', 'expect', 'Mumble', 'who', 'even', 'bit', 'physically', 'different', 'way', 'Mumble', 'up', 'group', 'Mexican', 'penguins', 'penguins', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'need', 'rhythm', 'tap', 'dance', 'soulful', 'singing', 'attract', 'mate', 'introduce', 'Mumble', 'sultry', 'Latin', 'styles', 'music', 'dance', 'movie', 'variety', 'song', 'dance', 'introduced', 'various', 'races', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'emphasizing', 'own', 'style', 'musical', 'romancing', 'attract', 'mate', 'called', 'heartsong', 'movie', 'Mumble', 'will', 'slowly', 'win', 'heart', 'community', 'girl', 'unique', 'style', 'happy', 'feet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'still', 'group', 'fuddy-duddy', 'old', 'men', 'look', 'dancing', 'young', 'penguins', 'find', 'new', 'style', 'music', 'akin', 'blues', 'rock', 'roll', 'disco', 'human', 'terms', 'be', 'religious', 'indecent', 'outrage.Woven', 'storyline', 'concept', 'aliens', 'actually', 'humans', 'are', 'capturing', 'penguins', 'show', 'aquariums', 'i', 'love', 'animals', 'i', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'enviromentalist', 'message', 'was', 'overdone', 'Mumble', 'temporarily', 'captured', 'aquarium', 'human', 'visitors', 'dancing', 'course', 'eventually', 'back', 'penguin', 'colony', 'relief', 'aging', 'weary', 'father', 'Memphis', 'Memphis', 'discourage', 'Mumble', 'broken', 'tradition', 'altho', 'Elvis/Memphis', 'was', 'blues', 'singer', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'well', 'well', 'Mumbles', 'return', 'happy', 'feet']",N/A

So when a movie like Happy Feet comes along, we must award props for originality and newness.Happy Feet is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood) who loves to tap dance.  He does not have the innate ability of his brother penguins, who use a heartsong to attract a mate.  Ostracized except for his friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), he strays and becomes lost in a foreign penguin colony.  These penguins love to dance and he becomes the leader of five spunky Chicano penguins (Ramon voiced by Robin Williams, who also voices the Macaroni penguin).  His return to his home colony is less than triumphant, and he leaves again for good, on a quest to find out the source of the missing fish.The music soundtrack is delightful.  I love Nicole Kidman as Mumble's mother, Norma Jean.  She is a sexy singer.  The way she meets her husband Memphis (Hugh Jackman), is true love.Now we come to the environmental message.  It is all true that fish stocks are severely depleted and that the ocean environment is suffering.  The controversy is, does such a strong message belong in a children's movie?  That is up to the viewer to decide, but for me, it was a little heavy after all the precious, cuddly gray baby Emperor penguins and lighthearted music.  The way Mumble goes out on his quest is ultra-serious.  His eyes at one point look just like Frodo on his journey to get The Ring of Sauron.The movie even takes digs at religion, which is not cool.

648838,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JPCF,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 10]","Life in the Antarctic is tough.  The weather is usually too chilly for golf.  It is tough to build a fire because there are no trees and thus no wood.  There are no fast food restaurants for a long way.  Then there are the leopard seals.Mumble (voiced by Elijah ""Frodo Baggins"" Wood) is hatched to Norma Jean (voice of Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (voice of Hugh Jackman) during a period when female penguins are off fishing.  Life might have been different if Memphis, in a rash moment, had not dropped his egg.As it turns out, penguins are quite musical, at least in this movie they are.  Unfortunately, Mumble is unable to sing.  However, Mumble can dance like Fred Astaire and Bill Robinson and anyone else you can name all put together.  Of course, few penguins are enthused about changing the status quo.  Singing is a good thing, and dancing is strictly forbidden.  After having a rough childhood and having a crush on Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), Mumble is off on his own.Other penguins have other standards and Mumble's ability to dance is an instant hit with the penguins on the other side of the glacier.  Mumble only makes one mistake, and that is to, once again, challenge the status quo when he points out that Barry White impersonator Lovelace (Robin Williams) is a fraud.Poor Mumble is an outcast from just about everywhere, so he decides it is time to track down the aliens that have been chasing away all the fish.  The aliens find Mumble and put him into a strange place where there is a lot of food and a very bizarre environment.  Mumble manages to run into a couple of walls before he realizes that he is not in the Antarctic any more.  Lucky for Mumble the aliens appreciate a good dancer, even if he is dressed in a penguin suit, and the aliens permit Mumble to return to Antarctica, with an electronic decoration.The leaders of the penguins greet Mumble's return with disdain until the aliens show up, and suddenly penguins are line dancing all over the place with abandon.This movie is alternately cute and absurd.  This movie contains a number of positive messages about being different and acceptance.  Much of the movie is accurate regarding the behavior of penguins as they care for their eggs and how they deal with the long Antarctic night.  Much of the movie is funny and is just like the cartoon I expected.  On the flip side, penguins are not intelligent aliens and communicating with dance moves instead of tones (thinking of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") was just a bit bizarre.  I think the environmental message of this film would have been just as effective with cutesy cartoonish penguins as opposed to tap dancing line dancing penguins.I do not recommend this movie for young children for several reasons.  First is the scene with the skuas.  These predatory birds do attack and eat baby penguins in a gory way.  Second, leopard seals eat just about anything they can catch, including penguins.  Antarctic researchers also avoid leopard seals.  Third, how do you explain why Mumble was eating a bloody chunk of fish (that's not Nemo, it is just sushi, children)?  I can see younger children having nightmares after this movie.  I have yet to mention the numerous adult references, but added together, you can see that this animated film is not for young children.I was surprised to learn that this movie is controversial because of its environmental message.  The movie is reasonably accurate regarding environmental issues and I think children need exposure to this kind of information so that they have an opportunity to help save our planet.  The Lord knows we have managed to do a pretty poor job of that to this point.  However, that exposure needs to be limited to older children because this movie is not for younger children who will have problems with some of the messages in this film.Good Luck!",4,Mumble Talks with His Feet,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,3860,"['Life', 'Antarctic', 'tough', 'weather', 'usually', 'too', 'chilly', 'golf', 'tough', 'build', 'fire', 'are', 'trees', 'thus', 'wood', 'are', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'long', 'way', 'Then', 'are', 'leopard', 'seals.Mumble', 'voiced', 'Elijah', 'Frodo', 'Baggins', 'Wood', 'hatched', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'voice', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Memphis', 'voice', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'period', 'when', 'female', 'penguins', 'are', 'fishing', 'Life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'Memphis', 'rash', 'moment', 'had', 'not', 'dropped', 'egg.As', 'out', 'penguins', 'are', 'quite', 'musical', 'least', 'movie', 'are', 'Unfortunately', 'Mumble', 'unable', 'sing', 'However', 'Mumble', 'can', 'dance', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Bill', 'Robinson', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'name', 'put', 'together', 'course', 'few', 'penguins', 'are', 'enthused', 'changing', 'status', 'quo', 'Singing', 'good', 'thing', 'dancing', 'strictly', 'forbidden', 'having', 'rough', 'childhood', 'having', 'crush', 'Gloria', 'voiced', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Mumble', 'off', 'own.Other', 'penguins', 'have', 'other', 'standards', 'Mumble', 'ability', 'dance', 'instant', 'hit', 'penguins', 'other', 'side', 'glacier', 'Mumble', 'only', 'one', 'mistake', 'once', 'again', 'challenge', 'status', 'quo', 'when', 'out', 'Barry', 'White', 'impersonator', 'Lovelace', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fraud.Poor', 'Mumble', 'outcast', 'just', 'everywhere', 'time', 'track', 'down', 'aliens', 'have', 'been', 'chasing', 'away', 'fish', 'aliens', 'find', 'Mumble', 'put', 'strange', 'place', 'where', 'lot', 'food', 'very', 'bizarre', 'environment', 'Mumble', 'manages', 'run', 'couple', 'walls', 'not', 'Antarctic', 'more', 'Lucky', 'Mumble', 'aliens', 'appreciate', 'good', 'dancer', 'even', 'dressed', 'penguin', 'suit', 'aliens', 'permit', 'Mumble', 'return', 'Antarctica', 'electronic', 'decoration.The', 'leaders', 'penguins', 'greet', 'Mumble', 'return', 'disdain', 'aliens', 'show', 'up', 'suddenly', 'penguins', 'are', 'line', 'dancing', 'place', 'abandon.This', 'movie', 'alternately', 'cute', 'absurd', 'movie', 'number', 'positive', 'messages', 'being', 'different', 'acceptance', 'Much', 'movie', 'accurate', 'regarding', 'behavior', 'penguins', 'care', 'eggs', 'how', 'deal', 'long', 'Antarctic', 'night', 'Much', 'movie', 'funny', 'just', 'cartoon', 'expected', 'flip', 'side', 'penguins', 'are', 'not', 'intelligent', 'aliens', 'communicating', 'dance', 'moves', 'instead', 'tones', 'thinking', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'think', 'environmental', 'message', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'effective', 'cutesy', 'cartoonish', 'penguins', 'opposed', 'tap', 'dancing', 'line', 'dancing', 'penguins.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'young', 'children', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'scene', 'skuas', 'predatory', 'birds', 'do', 'attack', 'eat', 'baby', 'penguins', 'gory', 'way', 'Second', 'leopard', 'seals', 'eat', 'just', 'anything', 'can', 'catch', 'including', 'penguins', 'Antarctic', 'researchers', 'also', 'avoid', 'leopard', 'seals', 'Third', 'how', 'do', 'explain', 'why', 'Mumble', 'was', 'eating', 'bloody', 'chunk', 'fish', 'not', 'Nemo', 'just', 'sushi', 'children', 'can', 'see', 'younger', 'children', 'having', 'nightmares', 'movie', 'have', 'yet', 'mention', 'numerous', 'adult', 'references', 'added', 'together', 'can', 'see', 'animated', 'film', 'not', 'young', 'children.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'movie', 'controversial', 'environmental', 'message', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'regarding', 'environmental', 'issues', 'think', 'children', 'need', 'exposure', 'kind', 'information', 'have', 'opportunity', 'help', 'save', 'planet', 'Lord', 'have', 'managed', 'do', 'pretty', 'poor', 'job', 'point', 'However', 'exposure', 'be', 'limited', 'older', 'children', 'movie', 'not', 'younger', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'problems', 'messages', 'film.Good', 'Luck']",N/A

The movie's animation was cute, songs were nice and story of Mumbles trying to find himself with his tap dancing have all the virtues of a good children film. Voice acting proves to be superbly well done and I had to admit, Mumbles do look like a cute animated version of Elijah Woods (our favorite hobbit).However, disguised in this children movie is strong environmental message about global warming, anti-fishing and that only penguins that can dance is worthy of saving, not to say the movie indirectly slapped at values of tradition, religion and zoos. What Happy Feet seem to me is a political message movie disguised as a ""feel good"" children movie.The DVD of Happy Feet proves to be pristine and near perfect in image and quality. The sound track is clear and aggressive and there are enough extras to keep most kids happy for a while.This movie beat out Disney's Cars for Best Animation but that award appears to be politically inspired by Hollywood.

Even as an adult I must say that I felt in love with ""Happy Feet"" - the stunning image quality, the great story, the impressive music, the very intelligent dialogues, the humour and the message of course.In fact this movie has a double message - the ""green"" one (have some pity for our planet) and also the one about accepting handicapped members of community. Very early you will see that the main hero is handicapped (according to penguin standards in this movie) and his problem can not be solved. Ever. So he has to live with it as has the whole colony.There is more - there are elements about the difficulty of communication between civilisations and the hard choices that face the established religion (yes, there is a penguin religion in this movie) in the time of a cataclysm. A great thing in this movie is that it avoids creating villains in the penguin society - even the most antipatic and usufferable characters have their story and their point. In fact the only villains are predators who eat penguins - skuas, orcas and especially the sea leopard, one of the most impressive (and scariest) creatures I ever saw in a kids movie. The scene with the sea leopard is actually the only one which can really scare the youngest kids.This is a terrific movie, in which every scene is perfect - nothing can be cut or added without spoiling it. I absolutely do not agree that the second part is worse, in fact I believe it is one of the most emotional and impressive moments of the cinema and not only children cinema. The travel of the main hero outside the borders of the world, his imprisonment in an alien world and his desperate attempts to communicate with aliens are incredibly described. And the solution of all the problem is actually just a little girls smile in one of the most moving scenes I ever saw...See this movie and you will fall in love with it. And your children will greatly profit from seeing it too - even if they do not get all the message, they will probably at least start to practice tap dancing, as my kid did...",5,"""Happy Feet"" set a new level of quality for children movies - a very high one",1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2230,"['Me', '6y', 'old', 'daughter', 'saw', 'movie', 'seven', 'times', 'cinema', 'including', 'three', 'times', 'Polish', 'version', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'times', 'DVD', 'were', 'terribly', 'impressed', 'Even', 'adult', 'must', 'say', 'felt', 'love', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'stunning', 'image', 'quality', 'great', 'story', 'impressive', 'music', 'very', 'intelligent', 'dialogues', 'humour', 'message', 'course.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'double', 'message', 'green', 'one', 'have', 'pity', 'planet', 'also', 'one', 'accepting', 'handicapped', 'members', 'community', 'Very', 'early', 'will', 'see', 'main', 'hero', 'handicapped', 'according', 'penguin', 'standards', 'movie', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'solved', 'Ever', 'So', 'live', 'whole', 'colony.There', 'more', 'are', 'elements', 'difficulty', 'communication', 'civilisations', 'hard', 'choices', 'face', 'established', 'religion', 'yes', 'penguin', 'religion', 'movie', 'time', 'cataclysm', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'creating', 'villains', 'penguin', 'society', 'even', 'most', 'antipatic', 'usufferable', 'characters', 'have', 'story', 'point', 'fact', 'only', 'villains', 'are', 'predators', 'who', 'eat', 'penguins', 'skuas', 'orcas', 'especially', 'sea', 'leopard', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'scariest', 'ever', 'saw', 'kids', 'movie', 'scene', 'sea', 'leopard', 'actually', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'scare', 'youngest', 'kids.This', 'terrific', 'movie', 'scene', 'perfect', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'cut', 'added', 'spoiling', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'second', 'part', 'worse', 'fact', 'believe', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'impressive', 'moments', 'cinema', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'cinema', 'travel', 'main', 'hero', 'borders', 'world', 'imprisonment', 'alien', 'world', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'communicate', 'aliens', 'are', 'incredibly', 'described', 'solution', 'problem', 'actually', 'just', 'little', 'girls', 'smile', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'ever', 'saw', 'See', 'movie', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'children', 'will', 'greatly', 'profit', 'seeing', 'too', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'message', 'will', 'probably', 'least', 'start', 'practice', 'tap', 'dancing', 'kid', 'did']",N/A

All the other penguins in his tribe are singers, and they use their songs to court mates. Mumble however, voiced by Elijah Wood, can't sing at all but has a gift for tap-dancing - which his tribe cannot understand or appreciate.Fits in messages about the need to respect diversity and about the environment - yes, I know, it's very politically correct but this doesn't spoil the story.Works on a number of different levels with a huge number of in-jokes to keep the adults amused. Two which I particuarly appreciated were the use of the song ""I did it my way"" to make a point, and a Skua with a tag who explains it in terms of alien abduction.Also some clever and well-handled perspective shifts: to a human a seal is a cute furry creature but to a penguin a seal is a dangerous monster. The Leopard seals, Elephant seals, and Orcas were all very frightening, but not so much so as to ruin the film for the average small child - at least, my two coped OK and I didn't see any of the other children in the cinema having problems.The music - most of it in various african-american styles - and animation are out of this world. The pace keeps moving brilliantly, and the big-name voice cast are all excellent.I strongly recommend this and will be buying the DVD for my children when it becomes available.Postscript, Easter 2007.The DVD duly came out and I did buy it for my children as an Easter present; they watched it twice over the Easter weekend.

648850,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00005JPCF,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 3]","HAPPY FEET is indeed the animated tale of a dancing penguin who has no choice but to dance.  His name is Mumbles (voice of Elijah Wood) and he is meant to be seen as someone special and different from others of his tribe. Mumbles is simply bursting with a never-ending supply of optimism, faith, and a Jimmy Stewart-ish belief that hard work and honesty can solve all the world's ills. In this case, the very survival of his world of penguins at the South Pole is threatened when their food supply is inexplicably reduced to near nothing. Until this point, HAPPY FEET could have been simply a retread of any number of Disney animations that featured adorable characters facing a predator.  But here, HAPPY FEET morphs into a leftist global warming screed that pulls no stops to indicate that Al Gore was right after all when he sees mankind as the ultimate scourge of itself.  The food supply is rapidly being depleted by what Mumbles calls ""Aliens,"" creatures who are truly dumb enough to destroy their own nest.  In between the many songs and dance numbers which are quite captivating even for grownups, the film insists on a subtext that demands a scapegoat for this planet's perils.  Though global warming is not mentioned, HAPPY FEET points an unhappy finger at a collective humanity that is unwittingly intent on eradicating the penguin population. Humanity is initially presented as blissfully unaware of the impending doom.  If only SOMEONE could alert the unthinking world that we are one on Planet Earth.

If you're older, skip this and watch March Of The Penguins instead. This is pretty much a happier version.As I quite often mention in reviews of animations, these days it's more spot the famous voice, than actually paying that much attention to the film. Here, we have Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, a poor effort by Robin Williams, and Brittany Murphy. But in this, it's also a case of spot the song used. Yes, there are some full songs used, but there's also a couple where just a line or two is used. How many did you spot? I managed to spot all of these:Somebody To Love (bad vocal from Brittany)My WayKiss (Nicole Kidman doing her Marilyn Monroe impersonation)Boogie WonderlandI Only Have Eyes For YouUnchained MelodyHelloLet's Talk About SexHeartbreak Hotel (when's Hugh Jackman releasing an album?)Chantilly LaceI'll Make Love To YouShake Your Bon-BonIf You Leave Me NowBaby Got BackLeader Of The PackQuite a handful yes?The also problem I have is that many animations these days, with talking animals, are all ""animals vs humans"", which is getting a little bit tired. But at least there's no drug references in this, like some older Disney movies. It's also too long for a kids film, and I was getting antsy watching it, so I guess any kid will be totally bored and annoying their parents by some point.The film also throws across a very strong political message, about global warming, humans wrecking the environment and animals suffering. Is that really what you want in a kids movie? I know very old Disney shorts were very pro-war but in this day and age, it's not really appropriate. I recently bought the two Ice Age movies, I wonder what message I'm going to get that I'm old enough to understand.It may be a cute movie, but if you've already seen March Of The Penguins, you will notice a few similarities.

The movie had several stories going on, and within the first five minutes, the audience was hit with penguins singing lusty songs lustily to one another. Time and again Hollywood works to trick us into watching cartoons that are better suited for adults. They could have used less suggestive songs and portrayed the same actions going on.My 10 year old son lost interest in this movie pretty quickly. My 6 year old daughter loved the dancing. I was saddened by the bad science information (the egg that the father dropped would not have survived, they freeze almost instantly and it is practically impossible for the father to get the egg back up on his feet once he has dropped it.) I also couldn't figure out why Mumble's feathers took so long to molt properly. I think it was perhaps to emphasize him sticking out from the crowd and to help others identify him easily. At any rate, it was scientifically unsound. And then there was the whole environment twist. And of all the countries that Mumble could wash ashore it...isn't amazing that it was America instead of say Australia or somewhere in Africa...II don't mind giving my children environmental information, but I prefer to do it in a factual way, not covered up in a bunch of dancing and mumbo jumbo.

648860,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JPCF,Melissa Niksic,"[4, 6]","I have to say, I was a bit disappointed by ""Happy Feet."" I was so excited when all the trailers for this film initially came out, but then it took me forever to see the movie, and when I finally did, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.The premise of the story is cute enough. The whole deal with this group of penguins is that they're all talented singers, except for poor Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood), who can't carry a tune to save his life. Mumble is rejected by his fellow penguins, with the exception of his mother (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), the female penguin who captured Mumble's heart from day one. Even Mumble's dad (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is disappointed in his son. However, what Mumble lacks in vocal talent is made up by his incredible dance moves. Unfortunately, though, none of the other penguins in the colony are impressed by Mumble's ""happy feet,"" so he instantly becomes an outcast.I wish this could be the basic plot of the movie, but it's not. I figured the film was all about how one penguin's special talent was eventually accepted by everyone else and the moral of the story would be that individuality should always be celebrated, blah blah blah. That's part of the story, but not all of it. I expected the whole film to be filled with dancing, singing penguins, but that only makes up about 20% of the movie, if that. The majority of ""Happy Feet"" stresses an environmental message about pollution and animal well-being, and obviously that's a very important message, but I thought it was major overkill in this case. There were times when I actually felt extremely depressed watching ""Happy Feet,"" and that was so wrong! Also, in my opinion, the movie is way too long, and of course all the depressing parts of the film were dragged out to the extreme.Bottom line: this is an enjoyable film with fun songs and cute dancing penguins. However, the ""happy feet"" aspect of the film was much smaller than I expected, which is why I was kind of let down by this movie. If there's going to be a ""Happy Feet 2,"" it needs to be at least 75% dancing penguins and 25% depressing environmental issues...and try to make it slightly less depressing!

The lineup was incredible, consisting of such voices as Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Steve Irwin.  Robin Williams was actually the voice of two characters. Well, the things that stand out to me from this movie most are first of all spectacular visuals, and then good music.  It also had a creative storyline and an unexpected twist at the end, which was a nice surprise.  Furthermore, I liked that there was the theme of being different that in the end turned out to be their salvation.  In a way, Mumble the outcast turned out to be a real hero, their savior of sorts.  He really had a knack for tap dancing, and as you may see, the talent comes in very handy.  The baby penguins were adorable, and very hard not to like.  The Leopard Seal evasion sequence was very exciting, and so was the Killer Whale scene.  All in all Happy Feet is a fun film and I am happy to have added it to my movie collection.  I would call it a ""family"" film except for the suggestive lyrics in one of the songs by Prince called ""Kiss"".  The lyrics go ""You don't have to be beautiful, to turn me on...

648881,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00005JPCF,Newton Ooi,"[0, 1]","The story of this movie is simple; an Emperor penguin, Mumble, is born in Antarctica.  He cannot sing but he can dance.  This inability to sing and his flaunting of his dancing gets him outcast from his land.  Mumble falls in with a different group of penguins, who just happened to talk like Speedy Gonazeles, and who appreciate his dancing.  Mumble and five friends venture of to find aliens (human beings) and Mumble eventually ends up in a zoo in the US.  He returns to Antarctica with humans who discover how their commercial fishing is hurting the penguins, and hence stop.The movie features many big Hollywood names such as Elijah Wood as Mumble, Nicole Kidman as his mom, Brittany Murphy as Mumble's girlfriend, Hugo Weaving as the elder penguin, and Robin Williams.  The latter voices two roles, one Mexican and one messianic, and it is his performance that provides much of the comedy in this movie.  In a sense, this movie can be seen as Robin Williams' return to his normal roles.  Throughout the 80's and most of the 90's, Mr. Williams made his name in  zany comedies such as Popeye, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Aladdin, and Patch Adams.  Thrown in the mix were funny dramas such as Good Morning Vietnam and the Dead Poet's Society.  Then in the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, he hit rock bottom with fans and critiques alike with pure non-comedies like Insomnia, One Hour Photo, Jakob the Liar, Bicentennial Man and The Final Cut.  But in the end of 2006, he returned back to form with two comedies; Night at the Museum and Happy Feet.  Both movies feature Robin Williams in his traditional wacky, zany, combination of idiotic faces, sarcasm, slapstick action and bombastic dialogue.  Though Night at the Museum did better, this movie truly features Robin Williams at his best; two roles, sometimes involved in the same dialogue.Along with the comedy of Robin Williams, this movie features a lot of music from hip-hop, rock and roll, R&B;, and even some country.

648887,AHF97M45JFCB,B00005JPCF,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Of all the computer animated talking animals out there these days, penguins have certainly enjoyed the limelight.  Happy Feet, Penguins of Madagascar, Surfs Up, The Jungle Bunch- these are just a few of the CG films in the past few years to focus on the flightless birds of the colder climes.Believe it or not, I was on the fence about viewing Happy Feet ever since its release back in 2006 for two key complaints that seem to follow the piece: A political agenda and enough singing to be considered borderline ""musical"".  Call me picky if you must but a political musical doesn't exactly rank as the type of material to get excited about when sitting down to absorb a good CG romp.  However, I am pleased to report that such concerns were greatly exaggerated.  But before we get into the nitty gritty of the material itself, let's take a moment to review the hard fact shall we?Happy Feet was conceived as an Australian/ American collaboration directed and co-written by George Miller. It was produced at Sydney-based visual effects and animation studio Animal Logic for Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures and Kingdom Feature Productions and was released in North American theaters on November 17, 2006.  Warner Home Video brought the piece to the home market in March of 2007 and here we are.The 108-minute, PG rated tale centers on a young emperor penguin named Mumble born with a singing voice only his mother could love.  This would be hardly cause for concern in our society but it turns out that penguins of this sect just so happen to base their entire dating, life-mate selection on ""heart song"".  In other words, not being able to sing to this little guy is like trying to be a playboy in social media without Facebook.The situation isn't hopeless though as the lad's got rhythm.  Though dancing isn't really common or even socially acceptable among penguin-folk, there's change in the air.  In the grand story arc, change is overdue anyway with the interaction between mankind and the wild and if tap dancing penguins is the spark that makes us collectively pay attention to the value of life on this planet, then so be it.Of course it's this aspect of the story most responsible for initial squawks of liberal propaganda and themes of environmentalism but in the grand scheme things there are certainly worse messages coming out of Hollywood of late.  Besides, never is such ideology force-fed to you (if in doubt, pick up Animals United from Arc Entertainment to witness just how bad it can get).This film represents the first attempt at animation from Mad Max director George Miller but boy you'd never know it by the pacing, visuals (which still look tight 7 years later) or impeccable castingSomehow Miller manages to turn a fairly straight forward and borderline silly premise and manages to convert it into a grand and whimsical work of cinematic art.  The film literally opens with photo-realistic textures of Antarctica and quickly establishes an ensemble cast that makes tagging along for the ride absolutely effortless.At the time of its release, some critics went as far as to say this $100-mil masterpiece birthed some of the best visuals in a CG production outside of Pixar and truly how these guys managed to thread the needle between lovable characters and realistic animal models is anyone's guess.  Plus there's an underlying tension involved in the plot reminiscent of early Disney animated films- where you almost expect tragedy in the struggle to survive in the natural world.  Fortunately making you cry isn't the prime motivation here and the ending, though a bit contrived, is certainly more about feeling good than anything else.As for my other main concern- penguins breaking into song so frequently as to be considered a borderline musical: again, needless worry.  With a soundtrack that includes everything from hip hop to disco, the musical antics are enjoyable and certainly more fun than expected.In all, a shame I waited as long as I did to give Happy Feet a go; truly this is a piece that will resonate with viewers of all ages.  Children will be mesmerized with the visuals and adults will find the plot engaging enough to tolerate, maybe even enjoy, multiple rewatchings.",4,Regret Waiting As Long As I Had in Getting to This One,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,4222,"['computer', 'animated', 'talking', 'animals', 'there', 'days', 'penguins', 'have', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'limelight', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Penguins', 'Madagascar', 'Surfs', 'Up', 'Jungle', 'Bunch-', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'CG', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'focus', 'flightless', 'birds', 'colder', 'climes.Believe', 'not', 'was', 'fence', 'viewing', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'ever', 'release', 'back', '2006', 'two', 'key', 'complaints', 'seem', 'follow', 'piece', 'political', 'agenda', 'enough', 'singing', 'be', 'considered', 'borderline', 'musical', 'Call', 'picky', 'must', 'political', 'musical', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rank', 'type', 'material', 'get', 'excited', 'when', 'sitting', 'down', 'absorb', 'good', 'CG', 'romp', 'However', 'am', 'pleased', 'report', 'such', 'concerns', 'were', 'greatly', 'exaggerated', 'get', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'material', 'let', 'take', 'moment', 'review', 'hard', 'fact', 'shall', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'was', 'conceived', 'Australian/', 'American', 'collaboration', 'directed', 'co-written', 'George', 'Miller', 'was', 'produced', 'Sydney-based', 'visual', 'effects', 'animation', 'studio', 'Animal', 'Logic', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Village', 'Roadshow', 'Pictures', 'Kingdom', 'Feature', 'Productions', 'was', 'released', 'North', 'American', 'theaters', 'November', '17', '2006', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'brought', 'piece', 'home', 'market', 'March', '2007', 'here', 'are.The', '108-minute', 'PG', 'rated', 'tale', 'centers', 'young', 'emperor', 'penguin', 'named', 'Mumble', 'born', 'singing', 'voice', 'only', 'mother', 'could', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'hardly', 'cause', 'concern', 'society', 'out', 'penguins', 'sect', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'base', 'entire', 'dating', 'life-mate', 'selection', 'heart', 'song', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'sing', 'little', 'guy', 'trying', 'be', 'playboy', 'social', 'media', 'Facebook.The', 'situation', ""n't"", 'hopeless', 'lad', 'got', 'rhythm', 'dancing', ""n't"", 'really', 'common', 'even', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'penguin-folk', 'change', 'air', 'grand', 'story', 'arc', 'change', 'overdue', 'anyway', 'interaction', 'mankind', 'wild', 'tap', 'dancing', 'penguins', 'spark', 'collectively', 'pay', 'attention', 'value', 'life', 'planet', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'it.Of', 'course', 'aspect', 'story', 'most', 'responsible', 'initial', 'squawks', 'liberal', 'propaganda', 'themes', 'environmentalism', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'are', 'certainly', 'worse', 'messages', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'late', 'never', 'such', 'ideology', 'force-fed', 'doubt', 'pick', 'up', 'Animals', 'United', 'Arc', 'Entertainment', 'witness', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'get', '.This', 'film', 'first', 'attempt', 'animation', 'Mad', 'Max', 'director', 'George', 'Miller', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'pacing', 'visuals', 'still', 'look', 'tight', '7', 'years', 'later', 'impeccable', 'castingSomehow', 'Miller', 'turn', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'borderline', 'silly', 'premise', 'manages', 'convert', 'grand', 'whimsical', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art', 'film', 'literally', 'photo-realistic', 'textures', 'Antarctica', 'quickly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'tagging', 'along', 'ride', 'absolutely', 'time', 'release', 'critics', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'say', '100-mil', 'masterpiece', 'birthed', 'best', 'visuals', 'CG', 'production', 'Pixar', 'truly', 'how', 'guys', 'managed', 'thread', 'needle', 'lovable', 'characters', 'realistic', 'animal', 'models', 'anyone', 'guess', 'underlying', 'tension', 'involved', 'plot', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'Disney', 'animated', 'films-', 'where', 'almost', 'expect', 'tragedy', 'struggle', 'survive', 'natural', 'world', 'Fortunately', 'making', 'cry', ""n't"", 'prime', 'motivation', 'here', 'ending', 'bit', 'contrived', 'certainly', 'more', 'feeling', 'good', 'anything', 'else.As', 'other', 'main', 'concern-', 'penguins', 'breaking', 'song', 'so', 'frequently', 'be', 'considered', 'borderline', 'musical', 'again', 'needless', 'worry', 'soundtrack', 'everything', 'hip', 'hop', 'disco', 'musical', 'antics', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'certainly', 'more', 'fun', 'expected.In', 'shame', 'waited', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'give', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'go', 'truly', 'piece', 'will', 'resonate', 'viewers', 'ages', 'Children', 'will', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'visuals', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'plot', 'engaging', 'enough', 'tolerate', 'maybe', 'even', 'enjoy', 'multiple', 'rewatchings']",N/A

What was hyped as a fun family frolic staring dancing penguins turned out to be a heavy-handed, ecologically-geared ambush teaching the lesson that if you're an endangered species, you'd better learn to entertain mankind with some clever footwork if you expect man to do its best to quit ruining the environment and save you.As another reviewer pointed out, some of the song lyrics were not appropriate for younger viewers. The film opens with a female penguin, voiced by Nicole Kidman, singing Prince's ""Kiss.""There were some absolutely adorable parts, however. (You can't hate the penguins. They're just too cute.)

Then he grew up and turned his talent to serious filmmaking, and he gave us Lorenzo's Oil. You'd not be stretching much by tagging either with the word ""classic."" Then he disappeared for a while. He resurfaced and wrote two of the best kids' films of the past decade in Babe and its sequel, Pig in the City. Then, once again, he disappeared from sight. Is it wrong to have assumed, given George Miller's track record, that he would once again emerge with something sterling?Instead, we got Happy Feet, a confused mess of a movie that joins the junk heap of worthless 2006 kids' movies, the largest pile of them in recent memory. Even Pixar couldn't come up with something that rose above mediocre in 2006. George Miller should have been a savior. Instead, we got Happy Feet.For its first fifteen minutes, this movie wants to be a subject-less musical with well-rendered, but age-inappropriate and badly-covered, pop tunes. This is not necessarily a horrible thing; any parent who spends an hour listening to Satan's mouthpiece on Earth, Radio Disney, will be greatly surprised at the number of songs s/he recognizes (and despairs at how awfully they've been rendered by the current generation of child TV stars). I was prepared for bad child-star renderings of previously popular songs. As a result, the first fifteen minutes of the movie were its most enjoyable. Had it stayed on that track, it would have worked.Then, however, it became a coming-of-age tale with assorted bad musical numbers. Mumble (Elijah Wood) is a penguin who can't sing. (Whether any of the others can is open to debate, but you have to accept it for the premise. Note that, ironically, the only professional singer in the cast who plays an Emperor penguin plays Mumble as a baby.) He expresses his musical gift in another way-- he can dance. Noah (Hugo Weaving), the tribe elder, is convinced that Mumble, being different, is evil, and should be cast out of the tribe. But he doesn't need to be cast out; the other penguins do a fine job of marginalizing him. (Don't worry, this is the subtle message in the movie.) Mumble wanders off on his own and finds another tribe of penguins. Ramon, his first contact with the tribe, and Lovelace, their spiritual leader, are both voiced by Robin Williams. (That nothing has yet been said about Robin Williams' awful hispanic accent and the stereotyping of the ""lazy Mexican"" in this penguin tribe is somewhat confounding.) After some clashes with Noah and the setup of a love-story subplot with Mumble's childhood friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), we get into the third direction this movie wants to pull us, which anyone who's seen any kids' movie since FernGully should be all too familiar with: the idea that every time a human being sets foot outside his environmentally-destructive door, he will cause further irreparable harm to the environment, leading to the imminent destruction of the entire planet unless we DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.Frankly, it's not just getting old, it was already old when FernGully came out. Worse, it's the most obvious, braindead form of inculcation possible, and we allow our children to wallow in it without us ever questioning it. It's gotten to the point where ""oh, boy, another kids' movie!"" equates with ""oh, boy, another vicious attack on humanity's inability to live in harmony with the environment!"" It's pathetic and disgusting. Even if Happy Feet had been an otherwise brilliant movie, the braindead pandering in the final third of its length would have knocked a couple of stars off its rating. But it's not an otherwise brilliant movie. It's a confused, needlessly complex mess that could have been a pretty decent-- at best-- musical. Instead, it's one of the worst films I have personally experienced in 2006, and I attribute this only to the fact that I was successfully able to avoid seeing both Madea's Family Reunion and the Larry the Cable Guy movie. *",1,I loathed this movie on so many levels I don't know where to start.,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,3982,"['Happy', 'Feet', 'George', 'Miller', '2006', 'George', 'Miller', 'gave', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Then', 'grew', 'up', 'turned', 'talent', 'serious', 'filmmaking', 'gave', 'Lorenzo', 'Oil', ""'d"", 'not', 'be', 'stretching', 'much', 'tagging', 'word', 'classic', 'Then', 'disappeared', 'while', 'resurfaced', 'wrote', 'two', 'best', 'kids', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'Babe', 'sequel', 'Pig', 'City', 'Then', 'once', 'again', 'disappeared', 'sight', 'wrong', 'have', 'assumed', 'given', 'George', 'Miller', 'track', 'record', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'emerge', 'something', 'sterling', 'Instead', 'got', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'confused', 'mess', 'movie', 'junk', 'heap', 'worthless', '2006', 'kids', 'movies', 'largest', 'pile', 'recent', 'memory', 'Even', 'Pixar', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'something', 'rose', 'mediocre', '2006', 'George', 'Miller', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'savior', 'Instead', 'got', 'Happy', 'Feet.For', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'be', 'subject-less', 'musical', 'well-rendered', 'age-inappropriate', 'badly-covered', 'pop', 'tunes', 'not', 'necessarily', 'horrible', 'thing', 'parent', 'who', 'hour', 'listening', 'Satan', 'mouthpiece', 'Earth', 'Radio', 'Disney', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'surprised', 'number', 'songs', 's/he', 'how', 'awfully', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rendered', 'current', 'generation', 'child', 'TV', 'stars', 'was', 'prepared', 'bad', 'child-star', 'renderings', 'previously', 'popular', 'songs', 'result', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'were', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Had', 'stayed', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'worked.Then', 'however', 'became', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'assorted', 'bad', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Mumble', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'penguin', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'others', 'can', 'open', 'debate', 'have', 'accept', 'premise', 'Note', 'ironically', 'only', 'professional', 'singer', 'cast', 'who', 'Emperor', 'penguin', 'Mumble', 'baby', 'musical', 'gift', 'way', 'can', 'dance', 'Noah', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'tribe', 'elder', 'convinced', 'Mumble', 'being', 'different', 'evil', 'should', 'be', 'cast', 'tribe', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'cast', 'out', 'other', 'penguins', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'marginalizing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'subtle', 'message', 'movie', 'Mumble', 'wanders', 'off', 'own', 'tribe', 'penguins', 'Ramon', 'first', 'contact', 'tribe', 'Lovelace', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'are', 'voiced', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'nothing', 'yet', 'been', 'said', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'awful', 'hispanic', 'accent', 'stereotyping', 'lazy', 'Mexican', 'penguin', 'tribe', 'somewhat', 'confounding', 'clashes', 'Noah', 'setup', 'love-story', 'subplot', 'Mumble', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Gloria', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'get', 'third', 'direction', 'movie', 'pull', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'kids', 'movie', 'FernGully', 'should', 'be', 'too', 'familiar', 'idea', 'time', 'human', 'being', 'sets', 'foot', 'environmentally-destructive', 'door', 'will', 'cause', 'further', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'environment', 'leading', 'imminent', 'destruction', 'entire', 'planet', 'DO', 'SOMETHING', 'RIGHT', 'NOW.Frankly', 'not', 'just', 'getting', 'old', 'was', 'already', 'old', 'when', 'FernGully', 'came', 'out', 'Worse', 'most', 'obvious', 'braindead', 'form', 'inculcation', 'possible', 'allow', 'children', 'wallow', 'ever', 'questioning', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'oh', 'boy', 'kids', 'movie', 'oh', 'boy', 'vicious', 'attack', 'humanity', 'inability', 'live', 'harmony', 'environment', 'pathetic', 'disgusting', 'Even', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'had', 'been', 'otherwise', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'braindead', 'pandering', 'final', 'third', 'length', 'would', 'have', 'knocked', 'couple', 'stars', 'rating', 'not', 'otherwise', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'confused', 'needlessly', 'complex', 'mess', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'decent', 'best', 'musical', 'Instead', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'personally', 'experienced', '2006', 'attribute', 'only', 'fact', 'was', 'successfully', 'able', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'movie', '*']",N/A

However, Happy FEET is the story of a penguin who can't sing very well and instead dances (hence the title of the movie).However, the young penguin, Mumble, is laughed at and ostracized by his fellow penguins for not only his horrible singing, but his dancing too. However, after running into a groupe of ""hispanic"" penguins, a series of incidents occur and an adventure of epic proportions begins . . .Now personally, I did NOT like Happy Feet. Maybe it was the singing in dancing? Maybe it was the cliche message? I don't know. However, no longer being a kid, I'm trying to take a more objective look at Happy Feet. I'm going to start with why I liked the movie and then why I didn't like the mnvie.Reasons I liked (to a certain extent) Happy Feet:1) Robin Williams was hilarious as Lovelace and the little munchkin penguins . . . Though some maybe be insulted by little stereotypical (to a certain extent) penguins (though I doubt the kids would be offended so it's more the adults to look out for . .  .I suppose)2) The environmentalist message .  . . Kids gotta learn that their actions (littering being one of them) has impacts (sometimes devestating)on the environment and those living in the environment (such as the penguins)Reasons I didn't like Happy Feet . . .:1)The singing . . . I don't recall if there was a single orginal song in this movie . .  . .I don't know . . Maybe Warner Bros. movies just don't do original songs . . . .2) The other, more misguided message . . .Yes . .we should all learn to appreciate those who are different, but I don't think we should wait until he or she saves our lives first . . .After a person (or penguin in this case) saves a life, then one might say the person is now a hero/heroine rather than someone ""different"" who simply should be respected and appreciated for who they are rather then what they become (which in the case of this movie would be a ""hero"") . . .but maybe I'm just overthinking this . ..",3,"It had potential, but . . . .",1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,2044,"['Happy', 'Feet', 'set', 'Antartica', 'society', 'penguins', 'who', 'attract', 'mates', 'song', 'However', 'Happy', 'FEET', 'story', 'penguin', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'instead', 'dances', 'hence', 'title', 'movie', '.However', 'young', 'penguin', 'Mumble', 'laughed', 'ostracized', 'fellow', 'penguins', 'not', 'only', 'horrible', 'singing', 'dancing', 'too', 'However', 'running', 'groupe', 'hispanic', 'penguins', 'series', 'incidents', 'occur', 'adventure', 'epic', 'proportions', '.Now', 'personally', 'did', 'NOT', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Maybe', 'was', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Maybe', 'was', 'cliche', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'However', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'kid', ""'m"", 'trying', 'take', 'more', 'objective', 'look', 'Happy', 'Feet', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mnvie.Reasons', 'liked', 'certain', 'extent', 'Happy', 'Feet:1', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Lovelace', 'little', 'munchkin', 'penguins', 'maybe', 'be', 'insulted', 'little', 'stereotypical', 'certain', 'extent', 'doubt', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'more', 'adults', 'look', 'out', 'suppose', '2', 'environmentalist', 'message', 'Kids', 'got', 'ta', 'learn', 'actions', 'littering', 'being', 'one', 'impacts', 'sometimes', 'devestating', 'environment', 'living', 'environment', 'such', 'penguins', 'Reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'Happy', 'Feet', ':1', 'singing', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'was', 'single', 'orginal', 'song', 'movie', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'original', 'songs', '.2', 'other', 'more', 'misguided', 'message', '.Yes', '.we', 'should', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'wait', 'lives', 'first', '.After', 'person', 'penguin', 'case', 'life', 'then', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'person', 'now', 'hero/heroine', 'rather', 'someone', 'different', 'who', 'simply', 'should', 'be', 'respected', 'appreciated', 'who', 'are', 'rather', 'then', 'what', 'become', 'case', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'hero', '.but', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'overthinking', '..']",N/A

The majority say the film is delightful with great animation, decent vocal performance, and a sweet message; but a few have reservations about the storyline toward the end.  However, it seems a fair number of folks think they must warn others about the ""liberal"" message this film tries to deliver to our kids.  It's as if we must be afraid that because the penguin elders take a ""theological"" stance and shun Mumble, somehow our children will instantly realize that it's better to be ""humane"" and tolerant (liberal) toward those who are different than to be a intolerant, cold-hearted butthead (conservative).  Holy, moly!  Hurry everyone; let's ban this picture before any more innocents are lost!  Give me a break!I suppose these folks are concerned that (even in the form of an animated movie) exposing children to situations where the morally and ethically depraved point of view is ultimately proven wrong will turn them away from their conservative ""values."" Oh and let us not forget that the eco-friendly message in this film is part of the vast Hollywood-backed, liberal conspiracy to make tree-huggers out of your children. But hey, this picture is rated PG; that means parental guidance is recommended.  Maybe they're just too busy to answer their kids questions about such basic issues.I don't see these as religious, liberal, or conservative issues, they're morality issues. All kids need their parents to provide moral guidance, and if a film helps the parent explain moral conundrums, that's a good thing.  If the neo-cons' moral foundations are so weak that they can't defend their positions to their own children, perhaps they should join Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.  I understand they are all about the one-belief system and the suppression of all other ideologies.Update:  I'm sorry if my initial review offended the conservatives who aren't sheep. Obviously, some of you still have the capacity for independent thought.At any rate, thanks for the kind comments. Enjoy the movie and all your delightfully intolerant opinions of me.

648927,A387BD735MI50R,B00005JPCF,R. Schultz,"[1, 2]","This is an appealing film, likely to engage both older children and adults. It's a sort of re-telling of the ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" parable that was so popular a generation ago. Jonathan learned to soar in mystic solitude while his peers were still limiting themselves to clumped shoreline scavengering. Here Mumbles, a non-conforming penguin, persists in dancing while all his peers are still expressing their heart-songs literally, by singing. Both works are celebrations of doing your own thing, of following your unique passion.But the producers of ""Happy Feet"" made a few odd choices along the way. First of all, it was odd to have animated penguins doing the dancing. Penguins have such short feet, buried in their paunches, that it's difficult to see and appreciate their foot action. I wonder if perhaps the success of the nature documentary ""March of the Penguins"" influenced this choice. Since that documentary made penguins a hot ticket, the producers might have decided to ride the crest of penguin popularity and feature them regardless. I'm not sure of the respective chronology of the two pictures though.Then the score here isn't particularly inspired. A lot of the music is determinedly modern, and therefore not necessarily the most melodic or spirited.Finally, I thought for a while there that we were sailing into some serious ethnic stereotyping. When Mumbles is catapulted into another community of penguins, it's obvious these others are being voiced by Robin Williams and others almost as caricatures of Hispanic and African-Americans.First it's Ramon and his barrio buddies who come forward to greet the newcomer and to take him under their wings. Like typical boys from the hood, they spurn honest work and the business of preparing to be legitimate fathers by assembling pebble nests. Instead they are out cruising for ""chicas"" on their charm and machismo alone.Next Mumbles works his way in among a revivalist congregation led by Lovelace, an obvious parody of a Baptist preacher who is using his pulpit fervors simply as a way of gulling the ladies back into his chambers afterwards. I really wondered why there hadn't been some picketing objections to ""Happy Feet,"" considering this parade of negative racial stereotypes.But then I began to get past taking offense, past political correctness. I even began to like Lovelace. He becomes a more sympathetic character when he's reduced to seeking Mumbles' help tracking the real source of the sacred pendant he's been claiming was bestowed on him by some higher powers. We viewers can see that Lovelace's talisman is pitifully only a plastic pop bottle ring that he's gotten around his neck and that is now choking him to death him as a result of the expansion he's undergone from his congregation's tributes. His plight sends Mumbles and his new band of comrades on an ecological mission that rushes to too much of an abrupt conclusion - as if the scriptwriter suddenly just wanted to go home. This was particularly disappointing since I had begun to enjoy the company of all these home boys so much.So when Ramon, with all his irrepressible stocky cockiness, beckons and commands, ""Come over here, Fuzzy.

Many of the songs (many which are sexually suggestive) are 20 to 40 years old anyway.  The kind of music that we use to listen to when we were kids.  But, to me, I'd rather our kids listen to sexy songs instead of today's angry songs.And one moment in the film Mumbles is being singled out as if something is wrong with him because he's different.  This could have been a discussion similar to telling a child that he's wrong for being gay. Which has got to be the hardest thing for any naturally sexually healthy parent to have to do.But, the entertainment of this musical film changes when it suddenly becomes a message about our endangered environment.  We're taking away all the fish so the penguins are having a harder time to survive.  In my opinion, the best way to reduce the amount of starving penguins in this world is to hunt them too.  I wouldn't mind trying a penguin sandwich, or try penguin soup.  And how would we prepare a meal with a penguin?  Should it be broiled, boiled, or fried?  Or steamed penguin meat with broccoli on rice?  How about breaded and fried, and dipped in Ranch dressing?  I wonder how penguin meat would be on a cracker with cheese. Umm, how about penguin enchiladas?  I'd be happy to try anything on my plate if it would help to balance our ecology.""I'd like to have one McPenguin burger with fries and a coke, please.""  Maybe we can give the fish a break and try eating more penguin.  Could that help the environment?",2,I think kids would be bored with this film.

""Happy Feet"" had the appearance of a nature documentary, and I mean it in a good way.  The filmmakers made a conscious effort to study penguin movement (maybe by watching ""March of the Penguins?"") as well as how the enviornment interacts with them.  Simple backgrounds work as well, as they are able to capture the splendid vistas of an admittedly minimalist natural environment.Now, it also was meant to be a ""message"" film, and those can always be tricky.  I'm not a big fan of them because, when moviemakers attempt one, I get the feeling they assume the watchers are too stupid to get what they're saying without clobbering us about the head with them.  It's worse when it's done with a ""children's"" film.  There are two here - taking care of the environment and not casting out those that are different - and yet they're handled in a truly cool way.  Yes, the uberconservatives may get in a bit of a snit when they see the forces against Mumbles are cast to appear like mean-spirited religious zealots, however this IS a great plotpoint.  Outcasts (I speak from experience here) sometimes feel just that way - beat on and thrown out simply because we're running against the popular tide.  And the environmental point is handled, I truly believe, in a way non-humans would look upon it.  Humans really ARE ""aliens"" in this world, and they aren't being necessarily ""mean"" in how they act toward animals.  They may be just clueless to the harm they're doing.A top-notch voice cast helps bring this off.  Elijah Wood may yet be one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood because he's able to bring off a tender, desperate Mumbles with only his voice (although the animators also gave him Wood's piercing blue eyes).  We don't get to see often enough Hugh Jackman's verstility with accents, and here we are hearing him do a cross between Curly from ""Oklahoma"" (I strongly suggest anyone who hasn't yet see the filmed Royal Shakespeare version with him in it to do so) and Elvis without it seeming forced or artificial.  There are really too many performances to list, and they're all first rate.The tapdancing too is great.  We only see a cartoonish replication of Savion Glover's moves, but he really sends off on sound as well.  A carryover from his days on ""Stomp.""The final verdict is an enthusiastic ""buy it.""

648934,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JPCF,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 5]","George Miller's animated film, ""Happy Feet,"" is a visual wonder and accomplishes the same feat as Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge,"" by deftly weaving popular songs into the plot of the movie.  But please note, the title and the fact that the movie features beyond-cute penguins belie the fact that this is a more grown-up cartoon that earns its PG rating - this is not G-rated family fare for kiddies of all ages.""HF"" focuses on emperor penguins, and Miller pays an obvious tribute to ""March of the Penguins"" in the opening scenes.  Memphis (Hugh Jackman) falls in love with Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and they have an egg.  Norma Jean then heads off for the fishing grounds, leaving Memphis with the egg through the long cold winter night - a scene that the movie creates with dazzling artistry.  Tragedy nearly strikes when Memphis drops his egg for a few seconds - anyone who has seen ""March"" knows that a few instants can be fatal.  Memphis is gravely worried that his instant of inattention has cost his family dear.But all appears well when Mumble (Elijah Wood) hatches . . . but then he starts tap-dancing.  Memphis tries to help Mumble hide this odd quirk (penguins are a rigid society), but everything comes clear when Mumble proves that he absolutely cannot sing.  This is a big sin in emperor penguin land, as every emperor penguin has a ""heart song,"" and without it, you can never find a mate.  Mumble can't sing, but he can dance like Savion Glover (who provides the dancing).  Still, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), the best-singing penguin Mumble's age, won't have him because he can't sing, and Mumble is ostracized.What follows is a wild ramble for Mumble.  He encounters dangerous leopard seals and meets new friends, some Latino penguins who aren't so hung-up on singing.  Ultimately, Mumble learns that the fishing problems plaguing the penguins (the fish are mysteriously disappearing) are not blamed on the penguins' lack of devotion to their ways, but the depredations of aliens (i.e., man).  So what begins as a musical romp turns into a powerful environmental message-film.And powerful it is.  I first saw ""HF"" with my four-year old daughter in the Omnimax format, and many adults were shedding tears by the end of the movie.  This is serious stuff, but I have to admit that my daughter was also riveted by the movie despite its near two-hour length.Look for more mature humor - this is more like ""Shrek"" than ""Toy Story.""All in all, ""HF"" is one of the best animated films to come out in recent years, and that's saying something as we are seeing more and more animated movies than ever before.  It's a little dark for some kids, so you should probably watch it with your kids the first time to make sure that it's OK.  But the good news is that you will enjoy Mumble's journey and probably have some explaining to do with your kids about man's siphoning of the penguin's fish.

From the preview alone, I wanted to see the Grandmaster Flash rendition of the song, done by a penguin.  The voice alone was adorable.  I just wanted to hang out with my nephews, tried to find a movie we could all get into, and was caught offguard at how interested I became in the plot of this one.Overview: The main character is a penguin who has been ostracized from his peers and family because he cannot sing, like all other penguins (apparently) always have been able to.  But, he can juke with the best of them.  Unfortunately, his peers are not entertained by his gift and abandon him repeatedly.  He finds comfort by branching off on his own and finding other penguins who appreciate his unique style.  On his journey to find companionship, he meets another penguin and some other birds who have seen ""aliens"" from other places.  Now, when the ""aliens"" are introduced, this is when the grown-ups will start really paying attention.  The ""aliens"" leave litter behind that is affecting the health of the penguins, take massive amounts of food from the water and leave the penguins starving, capture birds to put in aquariums, and/or attach mechanical devices to their bodies for research.  Sound familiar?  It should.  Being a vegetarian who despises anything that emprisons living beings and completely annoyed by people who litter, I wanted to dance my happy feet for this movie having such great principles.  But I managed to remain seated and bounce around in my seat during all the incredibly adorable pop/hip-hop/R&B; routines.  Eventually, the main penguin goes off on a search to find food for his family, finds out more information on the ""aliens"" and the ""aliens"" find out that penguins are living on this land.I won't tell the end, but I was very pleased with the outcome.  It wasn't so much about the principles mentioned above (litter and lack of food for an animal's natural habitat), but also because the elders of this penguin are so against change.  They are annoyed that the main penguin cannot sing like the rest and that he seems so unapologetic about it, and instead wants to show off his ability to (tap)dance.  Besides them not appreciating his gift, they try to make everyone else abandon him too, which is so relatable to anyone who has experienced differences, be it race, religion, education, politics, physical appearance, etc.  I liked the message it sent to kids.  Try to look at differences in your peers as a learning experience instead of a threat, because the peer who is different may be the one who can help you in ways you can't imagine.P.S.  The animation in this movie was great. I jumped when the sharks and seals came, and I wanted to reach out and hug the main penguin. He just looked so soft and pretty.  What a great movie!  I think I liked it more than my nephews, regardless of those two tap dancing past the nachos and popcorn all the way to the exit doors.",5,Musical Delight,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,3025,"['am', 'SO', 'glad', 'managed', 'negotiate', 'nephews', 'seeing', 'movie', 'instead', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'flick', 'preview', 'alone', 'wanted', 'see', 'Grandmaster', 'Flash', 'rendition', 'song', 'done', 'penguin', 'voice', 'alone', 'was', 'adorable', 'just', 'wanted', 'hang', 'out', 'nephews', 'tried', 'find', 'movie', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'caught', 'offguard', 'how', 'interested', 'became', 'plot', 'one.Overview', 'main', 'character', 'penguin', 'who', 'been', 'ostracized', 'peers', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'other', 'penguins', 'apparently', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'can', 'juke', 'best', 'Unfortunately', 'peers', 'are', 'not', 'entertained', 'gift', 'abandon', 'repeatedly', 'comfort', 'branching', 'off', 'own', 'finding', 'other', 'penguins', 'who', 'appreciate', 'unique', 'style', 'journey', 'find', 'companionship', 'penguin', 'other', 'birds', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'aliens', 'other', 'places', 'Now', 'when', 'aliens', 'are', 'introduced', 'when', 'grown-ups', 'will', 'start', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'aliens', 'leave', 'litter', 'affecting', 'health', 'penguins', 'take', 'massive', 'amounts', 'food', 'water', 'leave', 'penguins', 'starving', 'capture', 'birds', 'put', 'aquariums', 'and/or', 'attach', 'mechanical', 'devices', 'bodies', 'research', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'Being', 'vegetarian', 'who', 'anything', 'living', 'beings', 'completely', 'annoyed', 'people', 'who', 'litter', 'wanted', 'dance', 'happy', 'feet', 'movie', 'having', 'such', 'great', 'principles', 'managed', 'remain', 'seated', 'bounce', 'around', 'seat', 'incredibly', 'adorable', 'pop/hip-hop/R', 'B', 'routines', 'Eventually', 'main', 'penguin', 'off', 'search', 'find', 'food', 'family', 'out', 'more', 'information', 'aliens', 'aliens', 'find', 'out', 'penguins', 'are', 'living', 'land.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'outcome', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'principles', 'mentioned', 'litter', 'lack', 'food', 'animal', 'natural', 'habitat', 'also', 'elders', 'penguin', 'are', 'so', 'change', 'are', 'annoyed', 'main', 'penguin', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'rest', 'so', 'unapologetic', 'instead', 'show', 'off', 'ability', 'tap', 'dance', 'not', 'appreciating', 'gift', 'try', 'make', 'everyone', 'else', 'too', 'so', 'relatable', 'anyone', 'who', 'experienced', 'differences', 'be', 'race', 'religion', 'education', 'politics', 'physical', 'appearance', 'etc', 'liked', 'message', 'sent', 'kids', 'Try', 'look', 'differences', 'peers', 'learning', 'experience', 'instead', 'threat', 'peer', 'who', 'different', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine.P.S', 'animation', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'jumped', 'when', 'sharks', 'seals', 'came', 'wanted', 'reach', 'out', 'hug', 'main', 'penguin', 'just', 'looked', 'so', 'soft', 'pretty', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'think', 'liked', 'more', 'nephews', 'regardless', 'two', 'tap', 'dancing', 'nachos', 'popcorn', 'way', 'exit', 'doors']",N/A

648943,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00005JPCF,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[26, 39]","Well, I know the film will be far more popular than this review, but I try to call them as they are. The film starts out with narration, but does not end with narration - which makes you wonder how well thought out the story was and how much went on the cutting room floor - so to speak. Memphis has the golden throat of Elvis and his wife Norma Jean has the buxom penguin chest of Marilyn Monroe, replete with ""mole"" marking on her shoulder.The couple breaks into song, frequently professing their love for one another. Unlike other 3D animation hits like ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek,"" this story does not have original songs written for the story - instead they re-do popular hits... and the lyrics are frankly not appropriate for children. Here are some snippets:Kiss:You don't have to be beautiful,to turn me on.I just need your body, baby,from dusk 'til dawn.You don't need experience,to turn me on.You just leave it all up to meTell Me Something Good:Problem is you ain't been loved like you shouldWhat i got will sure 'nuff do you goodIt'll do you goodIs this what you want your kids singing to all day long? What happened to Chim-Chimery Charoo? What happened to even nonsensical, but at least innocent lyrics for innocent ears? Why are we in such a rush to sex up our kids in this society?The penguins pray to their ""Great Gwynne"" (I think that's what they were saying - but I don't read beaks well and there was no closed captioning on the big screen) - a diety in the sky that is the likeness of a giant penguin that they summon with their heart song. I was sitting there in the theater with my gaping maw hanging open. ""What am I looking at?"" I kept asking myself. While all the females have waddled out to the ocean to fish, the men stay back with their eggs tucked warmly between their legs. While everyone else is praying to their penguin diety, Memphis is doing his own mantra, summoning what appears to be an image of his wife, Norma Jean. I don't think parents realize what they're taking their kids to go see, quite frankly - this stuff is just weird.All the penguins look basically the same (except for blue-eyed Mumbles, mole-bespeckled Norma Jean and a theological patriarch that has a hunched neck like a vulture), so their big moment of individuality is their heart song. Mumbles practically dances his way out of his egg, but this society where everyone wears the same tuxedo is intolerant of differences, even with a baby. He is shunned by not only classmates, but by adults as well. Even Mumbles' father is unsettled by his son's talent and lack of singing ability.In almost sociopathic fashion, Mumbles entertains himself when he's alone - dancing to a song that is apparently in his head. While charming, it's also kinda weird. Children have an innate desire to belong - yet he'd rather be alone with his own music - and is content to be this way as he dances with fervor.There is some violence as gulls attempt to eat Mumbles alive and he is then persued, bitten and permanently maimed by one of the most vicious renderings of a seal I have ever seen. The folks that club baby seals to death will want this vicious-looking seal as their poster child to advocate further clubbing. The noises this critter makes are akin to the T-Rex in ""Jurassic Park.""As Mumbles escapes death, he encounters another breed of penguis - that all speak Spanish. Kids are just going to be confused - this is Antartica, but everyone here is multilingual. The accents are adorable, but the Spanish flavor is simply not explained... it's not like he travelled to another continent. Another violent scene in which killer whales attempt to eat a group of penguins and nearly drown then choke a penguin to death are painfully uncomfortable to watch - the violence is over the top.Too many movies aimed at children include violence against beloved characters to get emotional involvement, then pepper the movie with cute animals, songs and merriment - so the child is very involved emotionally, but doesn't even realize why. The violence is just too much for the little kids that are going to want to see this movie the most.Mumbles appears to also be a late-bloomer. He's not only a dancer, not a singer - but he is the only penguin that has a child-like lack of development into adolescence. When the other animals have clearly gone through a normal development cycle with the seasons, Mumbles retains his downy coat way beyond a normal period - yet goes swimming. If a real penguin that still had the down on it were to get into the icy Antarctic waters, it would quickly freeze to death or drown. He's also got blue eyes which no one seems to notice or comment on - but he's clearly the only blue-eyed penguin on the entire continent.  Mumbles almost has this Michael Jackson-esque quality about him. He's child-like, optimistic, hangs out with much shorter male penguins, and is a great choreographer. Hmm.A-la Rudolph, this misfit ends up being the salvation of the penguins. They are all quickly singing the penguin's praises after shunning him since he was practically an egg... and join him in a string of dance moves that is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video.Penguins are adorable, so kids are going to flock to this movie in droves - but it's not all about being cute and fuzzy. The movie is violent and over-sexed for kids. Not only would I not take my own kids to see this video, this is one I don't care to see again. I love kids' films and am partial to the well-done 3D animation, but without a good story line, the best animation in the world does not a good movie make.This film had lots of good potential, but it was not edited properly. Narration opens the film, but then is not heard from again. The songs are not original, but 'sexy' songs redone for a kids' film. As an adult, I enjoyed the film and laughed in spots, but was not won over. It lacks the innocence it purports to embrace.",3,"New-age Rudolph Re-done: 75% Fuzzy, 25% family safe",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,5922,"['Well', 'know', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'far', 'more',

So my kids, especially my 3 year old, are happily captivated.Happy Feet is another in the 13, count 'em, 13 CGI movies of 2006. It's a feel-good movie with the ever popular, ever familiar theme of ""Judge One Not By His Differences To You And Your Social Circle"". It's a nice family film with the all-important adult-asides. But nothing too grown up that kids would pick up on.The picture is just awesome; this computer-generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D.

There are so many ways in which it is bad that I'm really surprised to read the positive reviews here on Amazon. And did it win an Oscar? Unbelievable!First the good stuff: the animation is amazing, if you understand that they were going for realism and not cute. Both ""Cars"" and ""Happy Feet"" are animated movies, but it's quite a stretch to use the same term for both of them because their styles are so different.Unfortunately, that's it for the good stuff. Here's a list of some of the bad stuff, some of which I didn't see mentioned in some other reviews:+ That super-realistic animation has a negative side. It doesn't work to put ""people"" personalities in realistic animals when the animals do very unhuman things, like feeding their young by regurgitating fish into their open beaks. That kind of thing is fine if they are just animals, but it backfires when the producers are trying to get us to relate to their people-like personalities.+ The super-realistic animation has another problem: how do you let the audience know which Emperor penguin is Mumble when they all look almost exactly the same? So they gave Mumble blue eyes and had him keep half his downy fuzz far longer than any of the other penguins that were hatched when he was. Sure, I realize why they had to do that, but it conflicts with the realistic presentation of all the other animals.+ The movie is way too long for the content. The few fun scenes didn't make up for the overall slow and dragging pace.+ The message is way too heavy-handed. Really. I can be generous and assume that the writers and producers thought that the ""save the food chain"" message was too important to try for subtlety, but the weighty message really conflicted with the occasional times when the movie tried to be cute or funny. Were they trying to entertain us or whack us over the head? It really didn't work to try to do both.+ The songs seemed to have all been picked with the primary purpose of producing a mild chuckle from the adult audience because of the situations in which each song is sung. They get no points for originality, and there's no attempt to explain how the penguins would know ""alien"" songs. Once again, are we supposed to think that they're penguins or humans in little tuxedos?+ On a related note, the penguins always sing with musical accompaniment (including percussion) that seemingly comes from nowhere, but they can't seem to grasp what Mumble is doing with his tapping feet. It's a glaring inconsistency that the penguin's can't seem to recognize rhythm in their own ""heartsongs"" while they persecute Mumble for having rhythm.+ Mumble gets rejected by the other penguins because he can't sing. And he gets rejected again. And again. And again. Please give us a break -- we get the point.+ Lots of other reviewers have commented on the obvious sexual content of several scenes. There is nothing clever or subtle here, and nothing as fancy as a double-entendre. The dialog and the words of several songs have very explicit intent. Not vulgar, but I was surprised by how explicit it was. Is this a kids movie? Is it an adult movie? I really couldn't figure out who the intended audience was.+ Several other reviewers also mentioned the scary scenes. The leopard seal especially was really scary. I guess this isn't a kids movie. And that scene ends with the seal saying something like ""I know where you live"" foreshadowing that we would see him again, but (thankfully) that never happens.+ I could go on, but I'll just mention one last point that really puzzled me. Of all the animals in the world, why did they pick a penguin for tap dancing? Penguins have very short legs, plus they have feathers and/or down that pretty much covers their feet. So you really can't see much at all when Mumble is doing his thing. Unlike some other reviewers, I have no doubt that Mumble's feet were perfectly in sync with the sound track of recorded tapping, but a penguin was the wrong animal to try to show that. A flamingo or a stork would have made sense, but why pick a bird whose feet are mostly hidden??",2,"Nothing Happy about ""Happy Feet""",1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,4199,"['title', 'NOT', 'happy', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'laughter', 'joy', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'happy', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'bad', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'read', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'did', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Unbelievable', 'First', 'good', 'stuff', 'animation', 'amazing', 'understand', 'were', 'going', 'realism', 'not', 'cute', 'Cars', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'are', 'animated', 'movies', 'quite', 'stretch', 'use', 'same', 'term', 'styles', 'are', 'so', 'different.Unfortunately', 'good', 'stuff', 'Here', 'list', 'bad', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', '+', 'super-realistic', 'animation', 'negative', 'side', ""n't"", 'work', 'put', 'people', 'personalities', 'realistic', 'animals', 'when', 'animals', 'do', 'very', 'unhuman', 'things', 'feeding', 'young', 'regurgitating', 'fish', 'open', 'beaks', 'kind', 'thing', 'fine', 'are', 'just', 'animals', 'when', 'producers', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'relate', 'people-like', 'super-realistic', 'animation', 'problem', 'how', 'do', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'Emperor', 'penguin', 'Mumble', 'when', 'look', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'gave', 'Mumble', 'blue', 'eyes', 'had', 'keep', 'downy', 'fuzz', 'far', 'longer', 'other', 'penguins', 'were', 'hatched', 'when', 'was', 'Sure', 'realize', 'why', 'had', 'do', 'realistic', 'presentation', 'other', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'content', 'few', 'fun', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'overall', 'slow', 'dragging', 'pace.+', 'message', 'way', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'Really', 'can', 'be', 'generous', 'assume', 'writers', 'producers', 'thought', 'save', 'food', 'chain', 'message', 'was', 'too', 'important', 'try', 'subtlety', 'weighty', 'message', 'really', 'conflicted', 'occasional', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'tried', 'be', 'cute', 'funny', 'Were', 'trying', 'entertain', 'whack', 'head', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'try', 'do', 'both.+', 'songs', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'primary', 'purpose', 'producing', 'mild', 'chuckle', 'adult', 'audience', 'situations', 'song', 'sung', 'get', 'points', 'originality', 'attempt', 'explain', 'how', 'penguins', 'would', 'know', 'alien', 'songs', 'Once', 'again', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', ""'re"", 'penguins', 'humans', 'little', 'tuxedos', '+', 'related', 'note', 'penguins', 'always', 'sing', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'including', 'percussion', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'grasp', 'what', 'Mumble', 'doing', 'tapping', 'feet', 'glaring', 'inconsistency', 'penguin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'recognize', 'rhythm', 'own', 'heartsongs', 'persecute', 'Mumble', 'having', 'rhythm.+', 'Mumble', 'rejected', 'other', 'penguins', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'rejected', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'Please', 'give', 'break', 'get', 'point.+', 'Lots', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'obvious', 'sexual', 'content', 'several', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'clever', 'subtle', 'here', 'nothing', 'as', 'fancy', 'double-entendre', 'dialog', 'words', 'several', 'songs', 'have', 'very', 'explicit', 'intent', 'Not', 'vulgar', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'explicit', 'was', 'kids', 'movie', 'adult', 'movie', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'intended', 'audience', 'was.+', 'Several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'also', 'mentioned', 'scary', 'scenes', 'leopard', 'seal', 'especially', 'was', 'really', 'scary', 'guess', ""n't"", 'kids', 'movie', 'scene', 'seal', 'saying', 'something', 'know', 'where', 'live', 'foreshadowing', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'thankfully', 'never', 'happens.+', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'one', 'last', 'point', 'really', 'puzzled', 'animals', 'world', 'why', 'did', 'pick', 'penguin', 'tap', 'dancing', 'Penguins', 'have', 'very', 'short', 'legs', 'have', 'feathers', 'and/or', 'down', 'pretty', 'much', 'covers', 'feet', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'when', 'Mumble', 'doing', 'thing', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'doubt', 'Mumble', 'feet', 'were', 'perfectly', 'sync', 'sound', 'track', 'recorded', 'tapping', 'penguin', 'was', 'wrong', 'animal', 'try', 'show', 'flamingo', 'stork', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'why', 'pick', 'bird', 'feet', 'are', 'mostly', 'hidden']",N/A

The outcast going on the odyssey and then returning home with a hero's welcome.Children **really** love this movie.The music was well done and many very nice, but not too overplayed hits were threaded delicately into the soundtrack. I would've loved to have heard more than just a few bars of K.D. Lang's version of 'Golden Slumbers', but I guess that's what the soundtrack is for.I thought Robin Williams did good work as Ramon here. I will revisit his contribution in the next section as well.This movie had a very subtle message of conservation that wasn't preachy or contrived.It was funny to listen to the King of Steampunk voice the King of Rock n' Roll. I think his penguin Elvis definitely breaks new ground with with old ideas about the King's voice.Steve Irwin would've loved this movie.The bad:I felt the scene that's added in the extras titled: 'Mumble meets a Blue Whale' should've been added into the film for all the reasons that the introduction to the clip stated. I found it odd that Robin Williams could have multiple parts in a film but it was a bit much to have the seagull version of Steve Irwin doing a parody of himself which was very touching. The scene with the elephant seals was dull and difficult to pick out the dialogue. Steve Irwin should've been given his moment in this as this may have bee the last major motion picture that he was attached to.Robin Williams having two very large parts within the film was not just disconcerting but off-putting. While I did like the character of Ramon, I couldn't get around the thought that Williams was probably taking bread off the table of another actor. Cedric the Entertainer comes to mind as well as Bernie Mac. I think Bernie would've been fantastic in the role of Lovelace and it even seems written for him.Also, while we're meant to rightly assume that the narrator is Lovelace, the narration is almost a role in itself as you're left guessing which character it is because he has multiple speaking parts. So chalking up three jobs seems very much over the top.Overall:I really enjoyed the film and think most others will as well. The points I make are minor ones that the bulk of children wouldn't even give two shakes about. My thoughts about Robin Williams role in this has been repeated quite a bit in many of the other reviews.

648958,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPCF,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[8, 12]","IN SHORT:The animation is truly groundbreaking, the voices are perfectly cast, the soundtrack is a delightful, and although the direction is a bit lost in the pacing department, it is competent.  I thoroughly enjoyed this simplistic story about acceptance, respect, and standing up for one's self.  I am not overly concerned with some of the political, environmental and religious overtones that some have made a big deal over here.  The larger storyline and themes that I already mentioned are honest and straight-forward enough; I just don't see all the so-called ""evil propaganda"" imbedded in the story about abandoning faith, hating seals, and to stop all fishing.  I think that is just reading too much into things and I don't see any of these as the essential messages of the film. I really can't understand why anyone would fault a family movie that promotes being a bit more environmentally aware and to be more accepting of those that are different.  Sit back and relax and just enjoy the film!  It is an exceptional one.IN LONG (and I hope worth your reading):I always try to avoid confrontation on political, environmental, and religious viewpoints as they tend to be very personal.  We often respond with a knee-jerk reaction to every criticism in these areas because they are so personal and, thus, produce a less than positive outcome by the end (if there ever is one) on any one topic in these arenas.  We rarely ""win"" anyone to ""our side"" and often alienate the very individuals we set out to win to our side (whatever ""our side"" may be).  It is within these very corridors of hate, suspicion, and intolerant extremism that some reviewers here are walking as apparent in not only their reviews, but also in their vicious comments to all that question their specific view of things.  I kind of enjoy the irony that that is one of the very themes within this film and endlessly argued about here.It matters little whether I agree or disagree with others here on the so-called ""hidden agenda"" or not-so-subtle themes presented in the film.  I always try to have a dignified discussion whenever I can, but this whole online thing seems to allow many to behave like the schoolyard bully we remember from our youth.  They seem to think that it's okay to be ruthless online as they can hide in the safety of cyberspace.  Many of these reviews and discussions, on both sides of the issues, have gotten way out of line and personal and they didn't need to be.I for one found this to be a simple movie and PG or not, it is designed for kids.  There aren't too many adults who would venture out to this without their kids to see it and simply because a film is rated PG does not mean it isn't intended mostly for kids.  I'm not sure where some here got the notion that PG is adults ONLY as I've seen debated here.  PG is simply Parental Guidance is SUGGESTED and usually followed with reasons why.  That's it.  Even some PG-13 films are designed for the whole family although one has to be careful with those films.  In any event,  the themes in ""Happy Feet"" are simple enough without diving headlong into an endless debate on the film's intentions and rating.  My children, 10 and 14, didn't leave the theatre thinking ""Oh my gosh, Dad, they were condemning our faith"" or ""seals are terrible creatures picking on cute funny penguins"" and nor did they respond with ""now let's stop all that fishing, Dad.  It's evil"" or ""Let's dethrone the Pope.""  Even if the intentions of the film makers where such, then they failed miserably as I haven't met anyone, child or adult, who has read so much into a simple animated film as those here.  I personally think that is a bit hypersensitive, but like I said earlier, we all can be on issues related to politics, faith, and the environment.Please keep in mind that I'm denying that certain themes aren't prevelent in the film; I simply think that they are good ones for the most part, and for the perhaps negative ones, I'm just not that sensitive to be upset about.  I'm confident many will think differently and label me a liberal moron (even though I'm a conservative Christian by most), and others will label me a lukewarm Christian for not being upset about the perceived anti-Catholic/Christian messages in the film.  I guess I am a moderate or I just don't get all hyped up over a kids movie that has, what I personally believe to be, predominantly good messages in it.For the record, yes, I saw the themes in the film about abusing nature and overfishing.  I think one is hard-pressed to not noticed what we've done to our environment.  I do find it sad that some here hoot and holler ""where's the evidence?"" and equally complaining about such a message in a kids' film.  The fact that we can literally count the number of blue whales left should be an indication of how far we've gone.  The fact that those on the space shuttle can literally notice the level of deforestation from one flight to another should be another indicator of our abuse of nature.  I offer these off-handed pieces of evidence with the full knowledge that those who think differently will quickly dismiss them or insist on more facts and stats until it weighs a ton above their heads which appear to be buried in the sand.  In any event, I don't see what all the fuss is over a kid's film containing some messages about caring for the planet better than their adult counterparts do or did.Yes, again, I noticed the theme of questioning what we may have always believed and I truly understand how this theme could unsettle some; however, I also saw, to greater extent, accepting those who are different and can not or will not conform to society's norms (whatever they may be).  I really don't see this as condeming Catholics or Christians as some here have been screaming.  Someone once told me that with doubt comes faith.  We shouldn't blindly accept anything, but rather discover what is truth to us individually.  Afterall, isn't faith believing in things not seen but hoped for?  That is going to be different things to different people.  I have never been concerned about our children questioning our faith, and, in fact, I encourage it.  I don't want my faith to be theirs simply on my say so.  Faith is such a personal thing and forcing something on someone never really resolves much and breeds contempt in the end anyhow.In that vein I also noted the theme in the film of ignorance in attempting to destroy whatever is different from what we normally accept and, sadly, I've seen that in the reviews and comments on this film.  Why must we always demonize the individual who thinks differently?  How ironic that that is exactly the focus of this film.",4,"Happy Time with ""Happy Feet""",1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,6688,"['IN', 'SHORT', 'animation', 'truly', 'groundbreaking', 'voices', 'are',

648960,A2KB01ZCNIZQFQ,B00005JPCF,Sunny in DC,"[13, 21]","I took my three children ranging from 7 to 3 to see Happy Feet at the theater today. They all categorically loved it, although to be truthful, my 3 year old did get a little antsy towards the last stretch of the film. This has nothing to do with the film and everything to do with the natural attention span of a just turned 3 year old. The visuals are magnificent, the music was wonderful and the story is classic with a wonderful message. There are a few scenes that can be frightening to young children involving two intense chase scenes but I actually thought the scary scenes in Finding Nemo was scarier than Happy Feet's. My children quickly got over their first startled fright and enjoyed the intense chase scenes that felt almost like roller coaster rides, the animation was so great. There is definitely a little more overt sexuality then I liked, which luckily went right over my kids heads. But I wasn't offended by it since they were penguins and not humans.I almost didn't see this film because of all the negative reviews it garnered from Yahoo users. So many people hated this film for anti-Christian, anti-human, bleeding heart liberal environmental propaganda and pro-immigration issues. (OK - I thought the person that raised the pro-immigration issue was definitely a wacko...) These are probably the same people that burn picture books like ""And Tango makes Three"" which was the TRUE story of two male penguins that adopted an egg and raised a hatchling at the Central Park zoo. They are offended more for what they believe the story is telling rather than what it is saying. Reading into it a negativity that is not there. So it is with Happy Feet. I say this because I am a Christian and I am not a bleeding heart liberal, and I do not condone extreme animal rights groups like PETA, but I loved this film. All those who believe that the penguin elders are made to be Christian fundamentalists don't see that they could also be pagan high priests, orthodox jews, islamic fundamentalists or any other extreme group of leaders who are inflexible in their positions regardless of their religion. They are representative of a position of extremism, not a religion. The environmental message is an important one for all of us to take to heart. And while it was definitely a bit over done, it is still an excellent message to teach the world.This is a glorious film.

648970,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPCF,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 11]","***1/2Two emperor penguins, Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman), meet through song. This isn't unusual in their community; the penguins spend much of their childhood going to school to learn how to sing for this is the way they attract a mate. Memphis and Norma Jean's egg is held by Dad during the winter, as Mom and the other females trek to the water, to feed and bring back food for their husbands and newborns. Memphis is a little upset when his egg doesn't hatch at the same time, but Mumble soon breaks through the shell. It quickly becomes apparent Mumble is no ordinary emperor penguin; his voice can cause glass to break, but he can dance. As Mumble grows older, he earns the nickname Happy Feet (Eiljah Wood) and becomes attracted to another penguin named Gloria (Brittany Murphy). But Mumble's dancing is unusual and scares the elders (led by Hugo Weaving) and his dancing is blamed for the lack of fish. Happy Feet decides he will venture forth and find the real cause of the lack of fish, as he learns of `Aliens', from Lovelace (Robin Williams), a leader of a different breed of penguins. Soon, he discovers an abandoned outpost built by humans.""Happy Feet"", directed by George Miller (""Mad Max"", ""Babe"") is a surprisingly enjoyable film.The animation is simply stunning. Every penguin is different and appears lifelike and real. As Mumble grows older, he is the one penguin in his group who still appears young, as though his adolescence is taking longer than normal. His feathers gradually recede throughout, giving him the appearance of growing, when all of his friends have already matured. This is yet another way he stands out and is made to feel different from the rest.There is a lot of music in ""Happy Feet"" and the animators have done a great job of making the penguins appear to be actually singing. Their tongues move in their open beaks and their movements appear both penguin-like and evocative of the words they are singing. The marriage of music and animation is very effective and brought to mind ""Moulin Rouge""; ""Feet"" uses the same sort of popular songs in an unexpected context to tell parts of the story. Memphis (Jackman), has a bit of an Elvis persona, and sings songs in that same manner. Norma Jean (Kidman) is more the chanteuse, singing 70s rock ballads to attract her mate. Gloria (Murphy) is a modern girl, in more the Pink/ Cristina Aguilera mode and sings more modern songs. As each character begins singing, the rest of the penguins around them are so overcome by the melody, they join in creating a defacto chorus, singing along, mimicking the moves, etc.There are a couple of really nice sequences throughout ""Happy Feet"". At one point, Mumble and his friends are dancing and singing and then start swimming and the sequence evolves into a choreographed Busby Berkley/ Esther Williams-esque homage, everyone begins to swim in synchronized movements, swirling in circles around other swimmers. All of this is fun to watch and the animation is simply stunning and very fluid, reminiscent of the live action footage in ""March of the Penguins"".Later, Mumble and some of his friends, the different breed of penguins with Spanish accents, are swimming through the water, trying to evade a giant leopard seal. Again, great animation because it is so fluid and believable as they dart in and under stone arches, past underwater rock formations, and through tunnels.It is also fun to watch Mumble dance. He lets the rhythm take over and his feet begin tapping and doing a soft shoe. Famed dancer Savion Glover actually did the dancing for Mumble and his signature style is very recognizable, lots of tapping and sliding feet back and forth. They filmed Glover actually dancing, using Motion Capture technology. When they animated Mumble, Glover's feet and movements were copied and computers were used to animate the penguin's dance steps. It is a little more complicated than that, but you get the idea.The voice characterizations are good, but not great. Jackman seems to have the most fun with his character, giving him a discernible feel and accent. Kidman is also good and she imbues Norma Jean with a wispy, `bombshell' like voice. Eiljah Wood is less successful as Mumble and Brittany Murphy's Gloria could have been done by any other young female actress. Her voice is very recognizable, but she does little to make the character unique.Robin Williams provides three voices. The first is Lovelace, the leader of the smaller breed of penguins. Slightly overweight and full of bombast, he knows his place in the world and wants to keep his kingdom intact. But he is most successful with Ramon, the leader of the five penguins who tag along with Happy Feet during his journey. Using a Spanish accent, the character is funny and provides some comic relief along the way. A third voice only makes a brief appearance.""Happy Feet"" attempts to make a statement about the effects of the environment on these animals; the lack of fish for the penguins is causing problems and the elders naturally suspect the unusual new moves Happy Feet is making. But Happy Feet learns of strange beings, ""aliens"", from Lovelace and suspects they may be the cause. Shunned by his community, he sets out on a quest. Without revealing too much, examples of human influences on the penguins are shown, but the course of Happy Feet's journey is strange. He has some interactions with humans, but the end result is not convincing. All of a sudden, the mere presence of the penguin leads many humans to make sweeping, world wide environmental changes.In the last act, when Happy Feet comes into contact with humans, we actually see some of these people. I can't figure out if director Miller used just live action footage or if he filmed real actors and then treated it in some way. The humans appear realistic, but slightly soft, almost ghost like. It is an interesting look. But at the same time, the introduction of such realistic human elements makes ""Happy Feet"" resemble one of those live action Disney nature films made in the 60s and 70s, where a human scientist makes a brief appearance watching the lion cubs on the veldt.""Happy Feet"" is an enjoyable, fun film for the whole family.

If you don't want your kids exposed to that don't show them this movie.As for the politics of this movie, recent studies have indicated that human over fishing and pollution will destroy most of the world's fish within 50 years.

(Ignoring this problem is the real ""propaganda."")I can't recommend this movie highly enough - as long as the viewer is age/maturity appropriate.

I did not know that the movie would be THIS good, though.  I thought, 'yeah, it'll be a cute, funny movie without much substance in it.'  WRONG.  This movie is not only funny, it has substance.  It has a strong message to it about accepting others (somehow recently things keep crossing my path that send that strong message.)  Basically, in the movie, a Penguin is an outcast because he can not sing.  His special talent is tap dancing. Well, I don't want to spoil the end of the movie, but Mumble's tap dancing plays an important role in the movie as you will see when you watch it.  When you watch this movie, you will realize that outcasts are not bad.  You might even learn a valuable lesson about reaching out to people and accepting people who may be different than you are.  Who knows why they might be different?  Maybe they were born that way.  Sometimes people who are different have out-of-the box ideas that you may not even have thought of.  What I have to say to you is that just because you are different does not mean that you are still not good.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone of all ages and I hope they will not only make a sequel to this movie but make many others similar to this.*PG-Mild frightening scenesI personally think certain scenes in the movie may be frightening to those 4 and under.

648975,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPCF,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","""Happy Feet,"" Oscar-winner for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year 2006, is directed by George Miller, who has helmed ""Babe: Pig in the City"" as director. Remember this because despite the cute, cuddly face of a baby penguin you might be looking at in the film's poster or DVD jacket, the film itself looks odd at times, like the adventures of the little pig in the strange town. I'm not saying that ""Happy Feet"" (or the sequel of ""Babe"") is bad. I'm just saying that you might not find what you think you will find in ""Happy Feet.""The film starts like a musical parody of ""March of the Penguin,"" a recent hit documentary about the life of Emperor Penguins. Lots of penguins are singing, and among them you meet a male penguin `Memphis' (read Elvis) and Norma Jean (read Marilyn). They fell for each other and ... well, you know the rest of the story. Baby boy penguin Mumble is born, who is a terrible singer, but a fantastic dancer with `happy feet.' Ironically his enormous talent is not wanted in the colony he belongs to.The first part looks like a strange mixture of musical version of nature programs and ""Planet of the Apes."" Ruling elders does not like Mumble and his dancing, which they consider a threat to their colony. His mother is more understanding than his father who looks worried, or worse, embarrassed at his son's behaviors.The visuals are always impressive, and the songs are provided liberally (including the cover version of Prince, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, etc) and the chase scenes are thrilling, maybe too thrilling for some kids.I said you know the rest of the story before. Actually, you don't. Typical story of `finding my own place' with a love interest and comic relief turns into something different in the second half, which is more ambitious than the entire story of ""Finding Nemo"" and more serious and even weird than you expect from any animated films produced in Hollywood. All I can say is that it includes certain messages about the Earth, or in a nutshell, Mumble's ""Happy Feet"" saves the world.The voice cast is great, including Elijah Wood as Mumble, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, Elizabeth Daily, Magda Szubanski, Miriam Margolyes and Robin Williams. It is, however, a bit strange to see and hear a penguin with Elijah Wood's eyes speaking in Elijah Wood's voice. Seeing penguins with voices of Nicole Kidman or Brittany Murphy shaking and wiggling their body is not surely what many of us would expect from the title ""Happy Feet."" It is also reported that Tony winner Savion Glover is hired to shoot the tap dance scenes of the penguin with motion capture device on his body. All you see is, however, animated penguins, of which superhuman dancing ability is, after all, computer graphics, not the real human.""Happy Feet"" is really a mixed bag. Those who love the comedies of scene stealing (or annoying, if you like) double roles by Robin Williams would find the film's second part very bizarre. Some would find the images of penguins and other creature a bit too realistic, even grotesque. Like he did in the second ""Babe"" George Miller finds originality in the places where few other directors would explore, but I am not perfectly certain that disco music/dancing and environmental messages are the right place. ""Happy Feet"" is fun, to be sure, but sorry, to me the best animated film on penguins is still ""Madagascar"" and its penguin gang.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Entertaining and Unpredictable, But Film's Uniqueness May Not Exactly Be What You're Looking for",1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,3425,"['Happy', 'Feet', 'Oscar-winner', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'Film', 'Year', '2006', 'directed', 'George', 'Miller', 'who', 'helmed', 'Babe', 'Pig', 'City', 'director', 'Remember', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'face', 'baby', 'penguin', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'film', 'poster', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'film', 'odd', 'times', 'adventures', 'little', 'pig', 'strange', 'town', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'sequel', 'Babe', 'bad', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'film', 'musical', 'parody', 'March', 'Penguin', 'recent', 'hit', 'documentary', 'life', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'Lots', 'penguins', 'are', 'singing', 'meet', 'male', 'penguin', 'Memphis', 'read', 'Elvis', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'read', 'Marilyn', 'fell', 'other', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'story', 'Baby', 'boy', 'penguin', 'Mumble', 'born', 'who', 'terrible', 'singer', 'fantastic', 'dancer', 'happy', 'feet', 'Ironically', 'enormous', 'talent', 'not', 'wanted', 'colony', 'to.The', 'first', 'part', 'strange', 'mixture', 'musical', 'version', 'nature', 'programs', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Ruling', 'elders', 'not', 'Mumble', 'dancing', 'consider', 'threat', 'colony', 'mother', 'more', 'understanding', 'father', 'who', 'worried', 'worse', 'embarrassed', 'son', 'behaviors.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'always', 'impressive', 'songs', 'are', 'provided', 'liberally', 'including', 'cover', 'version', 'Prince', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Beatles', 'etc', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'thrilling', 'maybe', 'too', 'thrilling', 'kids.I', 'said', 'know', 'rest', 'story', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'Typical', 'story', 'finding', 'own', 'place', 'love', 'interest', 'comic', 'relief', 'something', 'different', 'second', 'half', 'more', 'ambitious', 'entire', 'story', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'more', 'serious', 'even', 'weird', 'expect', 'animated', 'films', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'say', 'certain', 'messages', 'Earth', 'nutshell', 'Mumble', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'world.The', 'voice', 'cast', 'great', 'including', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Mumble', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Elizabeth', 'Daily', 'Magda', 'Szubanski', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'however', 'bit', 'strange', 'see', 'hear', 'penguin', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'eyes', 'speaking', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'voice', 'Seeing', 'penguins', 'voices', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'shaking', 'wiggling', 'body', 'not', 'surely', 'what', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'title', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'also', 'reported', 'Tony', 'winner', 'Savion', 'Glover', 'hired', 'shoot', 'tap', 'dance', 'scenes', 'penguin', 'motion', 'capture', 'device', 'body', 'see', 'however', 'animated', 'penguins', 'superhuman', 'dancing', 'ability', 'computer', 'graphics', 'not', 'real', 'human', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'really', 'mixed', 'bag', 'who', 'love', 'comedies', 'scene', 'stealing', 'annoying', 'like', 'double', 'roles', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'would', 'find', 'film', 'second', 'part', 'very', 'bizarre', 'would', 'find', 'images', 'penguins', 'other', 'creature', 'bit', 'too', 'realistic', 'even', 'grotesque', 'did', 'second', 'Babe', 'George', 'Miller', 'originality', 'places', 'where', 'few', 'other', 'directors', 'would', 'explore', 'am', 'not', 'perfectly', 'certain', 'disco', 'music/dancing', 'environmental', 'messages', 'are', 'right', 'place', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'fun', 'be', 'sure', 'sorry', 'best', 'animated', 'film', 'penguins', 'still', 'Madagascar', 'penguin', 'gang']",N/A
648976,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JPCF,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 7]","I'm a sucker for penguins. When I saw the previews for HAPPY FEET, I knew that it would be a movie I was going to see, for better or for worse.  Despite Robin Williams' voicing several characters, I was leery at first and thought the film might just turn out to be another lame animated animal movie.  This wasn't the case.HAPPY FEET begins in Antarctica at the meeting of two Emperor penguins, a soul-singing baritone named Memphis (Hugh Jackman) who sounds and acts like Elvis and a sweet-voiced earth angel named Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman).  In this group of Emperor penguins, soul mates find each other through the heart songs that they sing.  Some melodies just don't sound good together.  Memphis and Norma Jean meet and have an egg.  Norma Jean leaves with the females to get food before the winter ends and Memphis stays behind keeping guard and warming the egg until it should hatch in the spring.  During the longest night of the year as the male penguins huddle together walking in a massive circle, Memphis drops his egg while walking on the outside.  He is able to rescue the egg, but the accident hurts him to his core.  During the spring thaw, the egg hatches.  It is a fine baby boy, but one who can't sing but can dance better than Fred Astaire.  Norma Jean returns and for a time things are alright.  But as their son, Mumble (Elijah Wood) grows up it is quite clear that he is different from everyone, not only can he not sing and wants to dance, but even in adulthood his body is partially covered in feathers and his eyes are brilliant blue instead of the normal black penguin eyes.  After being outcasted, Mumble sets out on an adventure of his own.  He makes some new friends, meets some fascinating creatures, and ends up discovering the mystery of the disappearing fish.The movie has a great vocal cast.  Hugh Jackman continues to illustrate why he will soon be the #1 actor in America--his talent seems to have no limits.  Nicole Kidman gives Norma Jean the homey sensuality that recalls the famous actress of her name sake.  Elijah Wood, no doubt using his LORD OF THE RINGS experiences, seems perfect as Mumble and Brittany Murphy surprises as Mumble's love, Gloria.  Robin Williams serves as the comic relief of the movie portraying not just one, but three different characters. Williams is gifted as a voice actor and does his job well (I just wish he would go make to making good live-action movies again).When I saw the original trailers for HAPPY FEET, I thought the movie was going to be about dancing penguins.  As it turns out, most of the movie is about singing penguins.  In fact, the movie is basically a modern musical; there isn't much original music but instead various popular tunes and some not-so-popular ones are used as the music that moves these flightless birds.  For most of the movie scenes move from one major song to the next one, interlaced with some dialogue and humorous visual effects.Speaking of visuals, the animation in the movie is amazing.  The penguins look unbelievably realistic.  They seem as real as some of the living, breathing penguins you might see in a zoo.  There are also some moments later in the movie where the animation is perfectly blended with live action footage of people.  I honestly was unable to tell for sure what was live footage and what was animated.Though the movie relies upon some formulaic devices and storylines, HAPPY FEET isn't a typical animated feature.  The major message of the movie has to do with living a life of difference and integrity.  There are parts of the film that can be viewed as being a religion satire, a political commentary, or perhaps a little of both.  The film doesn't take sides with either a conservative or liberal point of view and the religious element serves more as prodding not to abandon belief, but to not disengage one's intellect in worship.HAPPY FEET doesn't gloss over the dangers that are apparent in life.  There are a group of birds who attempt to rip Mumble apart when he is still a child.  There are other seals that attempt to eat the penguins as well as a couple of orcas who almost succeed in devouring Mumble and one of his friends while they are on their quest.  In this sense, HAPPY FEET more resembles a classical fairy tale of folk story in that it doesn't gloss over the dangers that naturally happen in living life.HAPPY FEET is one of the two best animated movies of 2006.  It's a very different movie than the other best animated film of 2006 (CARS).  However, it does what it does extremely well.  Besides, it's got a bunch of singing and dancing penguins.

Action is livelier, textures are more lifelike, and even industrial geometries come to life forbiddingly. Fer cryin' out loud, they got fat dumpy penguins dancing like hot human babes - who'd have guessed? I'm jaded, though. I've come to expect artistic and expressive breakthroughs in computer animation. If they upend the whole game board on schedule, when they're supposed to, I can only be politely impressed.But I'm really impressed. They got everything right - even the people. If those were real people, esp. that little girl, then accept my apology, because I thought they were animations (except that bunch at the end). They got the mood right, family tensions (OK, not deep, but way over the bar for a kid's movie), determination, and making friends with folks who look different. They also offer some really cool water ballet, the kind you'd learn from the Blue Angels. This may be just a little intense at times, if you have small and skittish kids, but that's just because a world of carnivores has intense moments in it, like it or not. The mommy/daddy thing is tasteful, loving, and biologically vague.It's not just for kids, though. It has the kind of wit, the kind of musical and cultural literacy that keeps the grownups engaged, too. (You bought the tickets, you deserve at least as much as your young'uns.) Robin Williams bounces suitably off the wall, though not so much as in Robots. Everyone puts in good voices, which is kind of unfortunate. The real star power here came from the anonymous geeks who programmed the physics for penguin bone and blubber, then put a human spirit into it. Maybe it's a compliment that the great voice actors sank so silently behind their characters - I'm more impressed by the mathematical feat of computing how fuzz on baby penguins catches the light, then forcing me and everyone else into an ""Awww, cute!"" response by means of that arithmetic mastery.I could pick a few nits, like the very odd schedule on which Mumble sheds his juvenile coat so long after his peers, but only a few. And, if I did, it just wouldn't be any fun. This movie is fun, not to make fun of. It's also a pretty fair 100-minute treat for fans of a capella music.

That's back when the producers of an animated film would take their time in developing a story, characters, and well-presented theme. Now, you just throw together as many ""name"" actors as you can, hire a group of animators and force out a story.And from this new animation environment comes such dreadfully dull and pointless cartoons as Happy Feet. The first 30 minutes looks like an animated remake of March of the Penguins. While the imagery is beautiful, it looked better in real life. A bunch of 80s pop songs are thrown together to tie in the idea that every penguin has a ""heartsong"". Unfortunately, the covers of these songs are lackluster and really should have been replaced with original material.So, a new penguin is hatched after being dropped by has father onto the cold ice, which we all learned from March of the Penguins, means instant death for the egg. So, this baby doesn't die, he just can't sing and wants to dance all the time. For this he is banished from the land of the penguins, because it's just ""un-penguinlike"" to dance around.Around the 45 minute mark is where Robin Williams comes in and actually adds life to the slowly sinking ship that is Happy Feet. But one man can only do so much, even if he is voicing multiple characters.Some kind of grand theme clearly depicting the lead penguin as a kind of restrictive religious leader results. Mumbles, the dancing penguin I mentioned earlier who's the main character embarks on a journey to find the ""aliens"" who are ""stealing their fish"". By this he means human fishermen of course.The last five to ten minutes becomes almost nonsensical, even for environmentalists who agree with the message that is being pushed onto viewers.Overall, this movie is not worth viewing at all. It's worth avoiding. The voice talent, apart from Robin Williams, is dismal. Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy... hearing their voices come out of penguins is not interesting or creative. The music is incredibly poorly done. When one of the main themes of the movie is music and ""heartsongs"", you could at least expect some decent musical numbers or original tunes. Not here. The story is borderline senseless, and the environmentalist theme is slammed down much to forcefully and ineffectively.But you know what? The animation is actually awesome. I can see why it got released in IMAX theatres because there are some incredible visual effects. They're just too far apart to save the film.
