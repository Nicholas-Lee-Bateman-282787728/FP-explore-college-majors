I may love these movies, but I will never pay more than double the original DVD release price for any OOP movie. Six times that is absolutely nuts. I saw these two movies years ago and they are some of Judd Nelson's best work.  Truly scary works that show how demented some people are and how they can sometimes fly under the radar for some time before the police become aware.

It was refreshing to see a serial killer movie that didn't suck like those scream movies and clones.  It is about a writer who is writing about a serial ckiller who drowwns young woman and keeps them at the bottom of a lake in his &quot;garden.&quot;  Then he &quot;researches&quot; it by actually *doing* it.  It's kind of creapy and suspenfull at parts.A great movie to rent with some friends.  But i would reccomend renting it before you purchase it (unless you are made of money that is:),4,Pretty Good Killer Movie,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,578,"['havent', 'seen', 'second', 'one', 'so', 'i', 'will', 'reveiw', 'first', 'enjoyed', 'Cabin', 'LAke', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'suck', 'scream', 'movies', 'clones', 'writer', 'who', 'writing', 'serial', 'ckiller', 'who', 'young', 'woman', 'bottom', 'lake', 'quot', 'quot', 'Then', 'quot', 'researches', 'quot', 'actually', '*doing*', 'kind', 'creapy', 'suspenfull', 'parts.A', 'great', 'movie', 'rent', 'friends', 'i', 'would', 'reccomend', 'renting', 'purchase', 'are', 'made', 'money']",N/A

I had absolutely no compalints.  As far as TV movies go, this is definitely a winner.  It was great fun to watch and an interesting idea.The sequel was not as good as the first--it was actually rather bland and silly in comparison.  It is still nice to see the movie here with the original as a companion piece of sorts.

678788,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00005RDAP,Joshua Koppel,"[6, 6]","This pair of movies makes for a nice evening's entertainment.  They both center around Judd Nelson who plays a scriptwriter who goes overboard when writing a dead teenager script.Nelson is excellent as a low-key psycho who kidnaps women and drowns them, keeping their bodies underwater as a garden.  At first he seems very clinical, analyzing victims' reactions to better his screenplay.  But slowly we see true madness creep in.In the second movie, Nelson infiltrates a movie set where his screenplay is finally going to be realized.  His own vision and that of the rewriter come together but his own madness can not be kept in check.Of the two movies, the original is still the best.  Nelsons acting combined with the visuals makes for a very original horror film.  The second movie, while good, suffers from production values.  Film formats change ever few seconds flashing between theater-looking footage and stuff that looks like it was filmed on COPS.  This was jarring at first and I feel it really detracted from the feel and atmosphere of the film; two aspects that contributed so much to the success of the first film.",4,Judd Nelson Creeps,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1128,"['pair', 'movies', 'nice', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'center', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'who', 'scriptwriter', 'who', 'overboard', 'when', 'writing', 'dead', 'teenager', 'script.Nelson', 'excellent', 'low-key', 'psycho', 'who', 'women', 'drowns', 'keeping', 'bodies', 'underwater', 'garden', 'first', 'very', 'clinical', 'analyzing', 'victims', 'reactions', 'better', 'screenplay', 'slowly', 'see', 'true', 'madness', 'creep', 'in.In', 'second', 'movie', 'Nelson', 'movie', 'set', 'where', 'screenplay', 'finally', 'going', 'be', 'realized', 'own', 'vision', 'rewriter', 'come', 'together', 'own', 'madness', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'kept', 'check.Of', 'two', 'movies', 'original', 'still', 'best', 'Nelsons', 'acting', 'combined', 'visuals', 'very', 'original', 'horror', 'film', 'second', 'movie', 'good', 'suffers', 'production', 'values', 'Film', 'formats', 'change', 'ever', 'few', 'seconds', 'flashing', 'theater-looking', 'footage', 'stuff', 'was', 'filmed', 'COPS', 'was', 'jarring', 'first', 'feel', 'really', 'detracted', 'feel', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'two', 'aspects', 'contributed', 'so', 'much', 'success', 'first', 'film']",N/A

The original movie is fairly sinister as we first meet the troubled writer as he is on a killing spree. The sequel is rather funny and more ridiculous, as Stanley puts on cheesy disguises to gain entry to the filming of the movie of his earlier killing rampage(from the first movie).I have both of these movies in my collection and find both of them entertaining. If you can get them at a decent price, I think they are movies you would want to watch a few times.
