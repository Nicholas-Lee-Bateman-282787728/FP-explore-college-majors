824149,A1O005WUQUF1K9,B0002475S4,Aaron Scott,"[65, 79]","This series, like so many others based on English ""detectives"" (e.g. David Suchet's Hercule Poirot or Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes) experienced a VERY uneven translation to drama.  Early productions were extremely faithful to the book.  But somewhere along the line, they diverged so severely that later productions could have been with equal likelihood based on Ellis Peters' books--or ""Godzilla vs. Mothra"".  Not to cast myself as the ultimate arbiter of taste: ""De gustibus non est disputandum"" as Cadfael might have spoken; but as one who knows every Cadfael book inside and out, I humbly suggest you DO NOT BUY the complete collection, but rather focus on obtaining those worthies:  A Morbid Taste for Bones, One Corpse Too Many, Monk's Hood, The Devil's Novice, A Virgin in the Ice, St. Peter's Fair, The Santuary Sparrow, The Leper of St. Giles.  These were well done and faithful to the story.  The Rose Rent, The Pilgrim of Hate, The Potter's Field, The Holy Thief, The Raven of the Foregate--these bear little to no resemblance to the story and are truly horrible to behold.  I gave all those DVDs to the library.  But the others remain a constant joy to watch and rewatch.  I don't know: if you haven't read the books, perhaps those, too, would entertain.

It is an intriguing show, the story-line based around an abbey in England about 1200 ad. there is strife in the land, with constant fighting over the throne between King Stephen and Empress Maude, each with their claims of right. There is total civil unrest. No one is safe, at times, not even in the abbey. Yet Brother Cadfael maintains his constant care of the village with his herbs and medicines, and at times, unwanted advice. He is also a brilliant detective, when there was no such thing, working closely with the Under-sheriff to keep the innocent from the hangman's noose.  There is also love and marriage, power struggles over land, the use of marriage and dowry to hold onto power,in a time when women had no say about their lives or futures. It is based in historical fact, which makes the program even more interesting.

824158,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B0002475S4,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[0, 0]","Brother Cadfael, Set 1One Corpse Too ManyWe deal with what isAs complex as any of the Cadfael series, this one tells the story of how Master Hugh Beringar becomes sheriff. Also as Cadfael states, ""By my reckoning there is one corps too many.""From the back Jacket:When a Novice Monk arrives at Shrewsbury Abbey and turns out to be a young girl in disguise, Cadfael decides she is in need of a friend. But when he discovers his Novice's true identity, Cadfael finds himself caught in the Crossfire of the Civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud.He is called upon to bury 94 rebel soldiers executed on the King's orders after the fall of Shrewsbury Castle. But when Cadfael counts up the dead bodies and finds one corps too many, it sets him on a murder trail. His investigations lead him to suspect the shadowy Hugh Beringar - a man who appears to have recently pledged his allegiance to King Steven...This time will Cadfaels tuition, forensics, and logic. Prove the case?--------------------------------------------------------------------------The Sanctuary SparrowUnder the certainty of Heaven nothing is certain.This is film is part of:Brother Cadfael Series 1 Box Set: ""The Sanctuary Sparrow, One Corpse Too Many, Monk's Hood and The Leper of St. Giles"" (1995)From the back cover: When the town's goldsmith is robbed and left for dead, the finger of suspicion is pointed at young juggler who was performing at the wedding feast of the goldsmith's son.Pursued by the mob, the young entertainer stumbles through the town to the Abby where he seeks the sanctuary of the Alter. Cadfael is given the job of keeping an eye on the youngster while the authorities investigate. But his discrete inquiries are cut short when the goldsmith's neighbor is found dead floating in the river...Once again the box does not convey the complexity or the beauty in the film as father Cadfael along with my favorite Hugh Beringar (Sean Pertwee) search for truth and justice using forensics, intuition and logic.--------------------------------------------------------------------------The Leper of St. GilesThere is always hope by God's grace and man's efforts.The back cover is fairly accurate:A great wedding is to take place at the Abby of Shrewsbury between the powerful Baron Huon De Domville and the young and beautiful Iveta De Masssard. But this is no love match. The old, fat Baron is only interested in Iveta's lands and estates. The orphaned Iveta lives another.All of Shrewsbury turns out to see the Baron and his bride-to-be ride into town and their differences are immediately noticeable. While the kind-hearted Iveta throws money to the lepers at the side of the road, the Barron strikes out at them with his whip. On the eve of the wedding, the Barron mysteriously rides off alone into the night, and that's the last time he's seen alive. Cadfael sets out to investigate his disappearance.Naturally the description of this film is simplified and for readers of Ellis Peters' works the film is simplified from the story.You have to take your hat off to Creeping Gromwell for helping Cadfael solve the mystery.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Monk's HoodWe learn more of Cadfael's past""No man is measured by the love he gives to others, but how he is loved by others.""A wealthy land owner Geravase Gurney wills his land to the abbey in exchange for a small home and to have the Abby supply the meals. His stepson is cut out of his inheritance this way. The mother is caught in-between and tries to reconcile them both. Before the deal is done he is poisoned. Yep too many people had access to the meal so it is up to Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) to figure out who did it and why. If you have a pre3ty good idea you are wrong.Of occurs to add a little spice the toe story when Cadfael discovers a little something of his past that makes it imperative he find the answer.This is the time that Abbot Herribert (Peter Copley) is replaced by Abbot Radulfus (Terrence Hardiman) see him in a different light as Walter Fane in ""Miss Marple: Sleeping Murder""----------------------------------------------------------------Brother Cadfael, Set 2The Virgin in the Ice""Between friends there is no owing.""Once again there is a mystery with many threads overlapping. Father Cadfael uses intuition and a great deal of forensics to sort out what really happened.You guest it; Sister Hilaria is found in the ice and the last time she was seen was with Brother Oswain of who is delirious from an encounter with bandits. Two kids are missing and a mysterious woodsman (with a sward) is creeping around. Things only get more complicated. In the process of sorting this out Father Cadfael leaves words of wisdom as ""There is no shame in tears when they are worth shedding.""The identity of the mysterious woodsman holds great significance.------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Devil's Novice""Even in the worst deed there is some good.""You know this is going to be a good one when it starts out with a bloody face staring at you. Later there is the bragging priest and you know if he is not the one to die that he should be. And what is with the soon to be bride playing on both sides of the fence?A new novice that speaks strangely in his sleep, a missing king's chaplain who should have staid in the cars or rather not go out alone, and a mystery wild man is just the right mix for a murder mystery.Once again Cadfael uses forensics, logic and intuition (with a little last minute information) to smoke out the truth and bring the culprit/s to justice.You will suspect everyone up to the end.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------St. Peter's FairIn the final reckoning we are all traitors to our hearts.There is to be the annual St. Peter's Fair in which vendors from all over come to hawk their wears. The town merchants are required by law to close for this time. Not satisfied with this law the merchants threaten Abbot Radulfus (Terrence Hardiman) and get told that he has no choice in the matter.This leads to a scuffle between the merchants and the visiting vendors. In the morning a wine merchant's body seems to be watered down with a hole and no tong. Abbot Radulfus charges Cadfael to find out if it was the Abbots fault for refusing to share with the towns people.Naturally things get complex. There are crosses and double crosses, beautiful girls and suspicious sheriffs. This may even lead to a rift between the Sheriff Hugh Beringar and Cadfael (old friends.)Cadfael uses forensics, intrusion and logic to help solve the mystery.----------------------------------------------------------------Brother Cadfael, Set 3The Rose Rent""We have this moment for good or ill""The Rose rent is a great mystery and in the course of being solved leads people to evaluate what has worth in life. A young widow must now face the fact that she may have killed her husband and also plan the rest of her life.I was going to print the quote from the back cover; yet as usual the person who wrote the blurb could not have seen the film or have read the book.Of course people die and Brother Cadfael uses forensics to determine who the murderer/s are and the motive/s. You get more then sufficient clues on the way.My favorite quote is in the morning as they are ringing the morning bell; someone asks Cadfael, ""Are you awake?"" and Cadfael staggering ""No. But I am out of bed.""--------------------------------------------------------------------------A Morbid Taste for Bones""A man may step out of his nature""A monk has the ability of sight. While he is being bleed he gets a vision. With the help of Jerome he realizes that it is St. Winifred whose body is lost in Wales and wants to be here so people can visit. A retrieval expedition is launched against Cadfael judgment.This is one of the best Father Cadfaels as it has meaning and story on many levels. True the ending is not exactly the book ending. But the feel is still there. The point that I like best is that the language is common but the cultures as dissimilar.Although there is no Hugh Beringar (Sean Pertwee), this film contains one of my favorite actors John Hallam who plays the lord Richard. He has been in many popular movies including ""4.50 from Paddington"" where he gets to play a similar character as Cedric Crackenthorpe.I leave you with this thought:""Those that seek to lay hands on St. Winifred are apt to perish.""----------------------------------------------------------------------The Raven in the Foregate""Truth and justice are often at odds.""It is said, ""All that evil needs to flourish is for good men to nothing."" And this film has a few good men that do nothing. So once again it is up to Brother Cadfael to sort out the mystery and if separate mysteries are related. I will not go thought the story blow by blow, as that is part of the intrigue in watching these films.A part of the back cover paraphrased:Father Ailnoth, the new parish priest in Shrewsbury, earns the scorn of his entire parishioners. After refusing to absolver a parishioner for carrying an illegitimate child, the priest is found dead in the river. There are plenty of suspects but a shortage of clues.Too bad back covers are not clear and strait forward however the story is more complex and the acting is superior.---------------------------------------------------------------Brother Cadfael, Set 4The Pilgrim of HateYour prayers are enoughOnce again many things are not what they seem and it is up to Brother Cadfael to bring then to light. If you do not compare to the book it is a good film and well balanced. (Do not forget that the first two chapters of the book are revealed in detail in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" and ""One Corpse Too Many"")This story takes place years later.From the back cover:Cripples Day at Shrewsbury brings a hoard of disabled pilgrims to the abbey. Within a short while, a body is found in a leather sack amongst the visitors. Cadfael boils down the man's body to inspect the bones and uncovers two possible explanations for his death.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Potter's FieldGuilt is something we have to live with,So much mystery, so many solutions, and you guest wrong. Yet Brother Cadfael stays with it until all is revealed. In the process we all must think and learn something of our selves.From the back cover:A woman's skeleton is discovered in a local potter's field, since the potter Ruald, left his family to answer a calling form God, everyone concludes that the body belongs to his wife, and that Ruald murdered her when she tried to prevent him from taking the tonsure.This may not be the book but the film has depth in its own right.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Holy ThiefEveryone belongs in the house of GodThis Cadfael story are said to be darker in character and not as much as lighter earlier mysteries. This is not my favorite Hugh Beringar (Anthony Green.) I prefer Eoin McCarthy. However he works well in this Cadfael. In The Holy Thief while most people were using trial by water to catch the guilty, Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) uses forensics to track down the murder.The abbey in Ramsey is bunt down by rebel soldiers. You may recall the time of the civil war between King Stephen and Queen Maude. As is the custom they clam the loan of St. Winifred's holy relics, to help build their monastery. You may also recall in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" the trouble Shrewsbury had obtaining St. Winifred. So in stead Brother Cadfael and Abbot Radulfus offer precious gems.A stormy night comes up and in the disarray Winifred is pinched. In the process there is a murder. Only the balance and counter balance of Cadfael and Beringar can solve this, if any one can.",5,"Brother Cadfael, Complete",1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,11879,"['Brother', 'Cadfael', 'Set', '1One',

If you have NOT read the Chronicles of Brother Cadfael, as the the series is called, then I suggest you do so.In these British television programs Derek Jacobi gives a splendid performance as Brother Cadfael, the monk who was once a crusader in the holy lands. The other actors are quite good as well. Some episodes, such as One Corpse Too Many, Monk's Hood, The Leper of St. Giles, The Virgin in the Ice, The Sanctuary Sparrow, are better than others and my guess is that this has to do with the writers who adapted the novels. Some of the writers seem to have read the novel(s) and can summarize the story well. With others, I get the sense they read the ""cliff notes"" and wrote for dramatic effect as they saw fit. This does not always serve the stories and characters that Ellis Peters brought to life so vividly. The character of Hugh Beringer,the Assistant Sherrif, is played by three actors. Jacobi states that he had his favorite -- I wonder which! In one episode a writer sets up a more confrontational relationship between Beringer and Cadfael than exists in the books. Some, if not all, of these tales would have benefited from 2 or 3 part programs that would have allowed for more of the story to unfold.Like many things in life, Cadfael the Complete Collection is a mixed blessing (hence the four star reating), yet is well worth your time for the marvelous acting and for some of the stories.",4,The (Video) Chronicles of Brother Cadfael,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,1519,"['Cadfael', 'programs', 'are', 'course', 'based', 'wonderful', 'series', '21', 'books', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'Edith', 'Pargeter', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'Chronicles', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'series', 'called', 'then', 'suggest', 'do', 'so.In', 'British', 'television', 'programs', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'splendid', 'performance', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'monk', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'crusader', 'holy', 'lands', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'such', 'One', 'Corpse', 'Too', 'Many', 'Monk', 'Hood', 'Leper', 'St.', 'Giles', 'Virgin', 'Ice', 'Sanctuary', 'Sparrow', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'guess', 'do', 'writers', 'who', 'adapted', 'novels', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 's', 'can', 'summarize', 'story', 'well', 'others', 'get', 'sense', 'read', 'cliff', 'notes', 'wrote', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'saw', 'fit', 'not', 'always', 'serve', 'stories', 'characters', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'brought', 'life', 'so', 'vividly', 'character', 'Hugh', 'Beringer', 'Assistant', 'Sherrif', 'played', 'three', 'actors', 'Jacobi', 'had', 'favorite', 'wonder', 'one', 'episode', 'writer', 'up', 'more', 'confrontational', 'relationship', 'Beringer', 'Cadfael', 'exists', 'books', 'not', 'tales', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', '2', '3', 'part', 'programs', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'more', 'story', 'unfold.Like', 'many', 'things', 'life', 'Cadfael', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'hence', 'four', 'star', 'reating', 'yet', 'well', 'time', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'stories']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[151, 157]","Brother Cadfael is not the sort of person you would immediately peg as a brilliant detective -- a crusader-turned-monk who specializes in herbology and medicine.But he is a brilliant detective. And ""Cadfael: Complete Collection"" brings together all of the BBC's adaptation of Ellis Peters' classic mysteries, which intertwine murder mysteries and medieval history. These stories are well-written, clever and full of unexpected twists -- and they're filmed with a gritty, grimy realistic flavor.Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) is a monk at the abbey of Shrewsbury in the first half of the twelfth century. At this time, England was being ripped in half by a civil war (now called The Anarchy) between King Stephen and Empress Maud, which was dividing the populace and turning the English people against each other.And as the war rages on, Cadfael is confronted by many different murders -- murdered nobles, framed acrobats, a corpse is hidden amongst executed ""traitors,"" a raped nun frozen in the river, a saint's bones that inspire murder and greed, a body found in a potter's field, a vast Shrewsbury Fair leads to a string of cruel murders, a cruel priest is found dead after he drives a pregnant girl to suicide, and political conflicts lead to brutal deaths.""Cadfael: The Complete Collection"" is the sort of authentic historical series that the BBC has sadly stopped making -- it has all the blood, grime and sweat of the 12th century, and accurately depicts the strong presence of religion and politicial strife in medieval life.For the most part, the writers accurately adapt Peters' novels -- every mystery has lots of suspects, moral dilemmas, religious strife, civil war, a murder that only Cadfael can solve, and a bit of cute romance as well. And since the series is set long before forensic science was created, it's fun to see Cadfael scout for tiny clues and patch them together into a case-- a cast of a boot print, a shred of cloth, a bit of a plant.The one downside? Cadfael does a couple of things that would be questionable for a Catholic monk, and ""The Pilgrim of Hate"" is almost nothing like Peters' novel -- a lame end for the series.But Derek Jacobi is absolutely pitch-perfect as Cadfael -- his solid performance is kindly, wise, paternal, and a little humorous at times, especially as a monk who's seen more of the real world than most of his brothers (he was even a ladies' man!). And even though he's a monk and healer, we occasionally get to see him kick butt as well.There are also great performances by Terrence Hardiman as the kind but stern Abbot Radulfus, Julian Firth as the fussy Brother Jerome, and Michael Culver as the haughty snob Prior Robert. Mark Charnock is also rather sweet as the naive, gawky Brother Oswin (""... besides... I like gloves"").Despite a few flaws, ""Cadfael: The Complete Collection"" is an earthy, solid medieval mystery series  with a brilliant Derek Jacobi in the lead.",4,A rare Benedictine,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,2921,"['Brother', 'Cadfael', 'not', 'sort', 'person', 'would', 'immediately', 'peg', 'brilliant', 'detective', 'crusader-turned-monk', 'who', 'herbology', 'medicine.But', 'brilliant', 'detective', 'Cadfael', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'together', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'classic', 'mysteries', 'intertwine', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'medieval', 'history', 'stories', 'are', 'well-written', 'clever', 'full', 'unexpected', 'twists', ""'re"", 'filmed', 'gritty', 'grimy', 'realistic', 'flavor.Cadfael', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'monk', 'abbey', 'Shrewsbury', 'first', 'half', 'twelfth', 'century', 'time', 'England', 'was', 'being', 'ripped', 'half', 'civil', 'war', 'now', 'called', 'Anarchy', 'King', 'Stephen', 'Empress', 'Maud', 'was', 'dividing', 'populace', 'turning', 'English', 'people', 'other.And', 'war', 'Cadfael', 'confronted', 'many', 'different', 'murders', 'murdered', 'nobles', 'framed', 'acrobats', 'corpse', 'hidden', 'amongst', 'executed', 'traitors', 'raped', 'nun', 'frozen', 'river', 'saint', 'bones', 'inspire', 'murder', 'greed', 'body', 'found', 'potter', 'field', 'vast', 'Shrewsbury', 'Fair', 'string', 'cruel', 'murders', 'cruel', 'priest', 'found', 'dead', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'suicide', 'political', 'conflicts', 'lead', 'brutal', 'deaths', 'Cadfael', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'sort', 'authentic', 'historical', 'series', 'BBC', 'sadly', 'stopped', 'making', 'blood', 'grime', 'sweat', '12th', 'century', 'accurately', 'strong', 'presence', 'religion', 'politicial', 'strife', 'medieval', 'life.For', 'most', 'part', 'writers', 'accurately', 'adapt', 'Peters', 'novels', 'mystery', 'lots', 'suspects', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'religious', 'strife', 'civil', 'war', 'murder', 'only', 'Cadfael', 'can', 'solve', 'bit', 'cute', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'set', 'long', 'forensic', 'science', 'was', 'created', 'fun', 'see', 'Cadfael', 'scout', 'tiny', 'clues', 'patch', 'together', 'case', 'cast', 'boot', 'print', 'shred', 'cloth', 'bit', 'plant.The', 'one', 'downside', 'Cadfael', 'couple', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'questionable', 'Catholic', 'monk', 'Pilgrim', 'Hate', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Peters', 'novel', 'lame', 'end', 'series.But', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'absolutely', 'pitch-perfect', 'Cadfael', 'solid', 'performance', 'kindly', 'wise', 'paternal', 'little', 'humorous', 'times', 'especially', 'monk', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'most', 'brothers', 'was', 'even', 'ladies', 'man', 'even', 'monk', 'healer', 'occasionally', 'get', 'see', 'kick', 'butt', 'well.There', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'Terrence', 'Hardiman', 'kind', 'stern', 'Abbot', 'Radulfus', 'Julian', 'Firth', 'fussy', 'Brother', 'Jerome', 'Michael', 'Culver', 'haughty', 'snob', 'Prior', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Charnock', 'also', 'rather', 'sweet', 'naive', 'gawky', 'Brother', 'Oswin', 'like', 'gloves', '.Despite', 'few', 'flaws', 'Cadfael', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'earthy', 'solid', 'medieval', 'mystery', 'series', 'brilliant', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'lead']",N/A

These are complex cases and the period costuming and props as well as the filming settings are just whipped topping to delicious suspense and mystery.There are plenty of guest stars including ""Julian Glover, Sean Pertwee, Tara Fitzgerald, Toby Jones, Stephen Moyer, Anna Friel, Hugh Boneville, to name a few. There is also Bonus stuff: audio comments by Jacobi, an essay, Ellis Peters info, production scrapbooks, background notes, and more. The stories originated from ""PBS Mystery"" and were based on best-selling books by Ellis Peters.YES, there are SUBTITLES. Each of the 13 episodes are 75 minutes, almost a feature-length story, and every bit as good as theater films. When films typically go for a higher single price, this collection is VERY AFFORDABLE, a value, for all that you get. Each episode is on it's own disc.16 1/2 hours of delightful mystery to spend watching, but you will likely want to watch them one right after another. They are addictive. The only negative aspect of this collection is the fact that only 13 episodes were produced.",5,HISTORICAL MYSTERY AT IT'S FINEST,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1479,"['Truly', 'wonderful', 'series', 'A', 'Medieval', 'England', 'warrior', 'converted', 'monk', 'waring', 'times', 'England', 'were', 'dastardly', 'crimes', 'needed', 'solving', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Sir', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Claudius', 'man', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'mystery', 'crime-solving', 'drama', 'as', 'good', 'modern', 'settings', 'Midsomer', 'Murder', 'sets', 'are', 'to-die-for', 'are', 'historical', 'story', 'fan', 'am', 'are', 'complex', 'cases', 'period', 'costuming', 'props', 'as', 'well', 'filming', 'settings', 'are', 'just', 'whipped', 'topping', 'delicious', 'suspense', 'are', 'plenty', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Julian', 'Glover', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Hugh', 'Boneville', 'name', 'few', 'also', 'Bonus', 'stuff', 'audio', 'comments', 'Jacobi', 'essay', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'info', 'production', 'scrapbooks', 'background', 'notes', 'more', 'stories', 'originated', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'were', 'based', 'best-selling', 'books', 'Ellis', 'Peters.YES', 'are', 'SUBTITLES', '13', 'episodes', 'are', '75', 'minutes', 'almost', 'feature-length', 'story', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'theater', 'films', 'When', 'films', 'typically', 'go', 'higher', 'single', 'price', 'collection', 'VERY', 'AFFORDABLE', 'value', 'get', 'episode', 'own', 'disc.16', '1/2', 'hours', 'delightful', 'mystery', 'spend', 'watching', 'will', 'likely', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'right', 'are', 'addictive', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'collection', 'fact', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced']",N/A

The social upheaval during the Anarchy is fascinating to me, and I cannot express how much I love that a mystery series is set during that time. So much awesome!Also: Derek Jacobi is amazing. His skill in embracing the character of a man of God with a vivid and experienced past is exquisite to behold. It's through this worldly-wise monk that we see how Peters intended the modern viewer to perceive the outmoded and sometimes downright backward ideas of the 12th century. Yet, at the same time, so much remains constant between Cadfael's time and our own. He deals with prejudice, war, broken families, class warfare, multinationalism, and the timelessness of love.

It's a smart, entertaining mystery series in traditional British fashion with well-placed humor and social satire (at least regarding Medieval society). Cadfael is a monk who is well respected by most locals and, being perhaps a few centuries ahead of his peers in forensic investigation methods, is the go-to guy for many strange theft-and-murder cases. While blending scientific techniques with Christian morals, Cadfael runs into the kind of problems one might expect in a Medieval crime investigation - for instance the constant squabbles with holier-than-thou snobbery among certain members of his Brotherhood and the ever-present difficulties collecting evidence with the primitive tools of his day. But we also get to see the civility that ties all humanity together. The circumstances are different than today but people are still motivated by the same things we see all around us now - sorrow, joy, lust, anger and hate to name a few.

824292,AHT60YWC3QIMI,B0002475S4,Robert Thorbury,"[15, 16]","One evening I turned on my TV and found myself staring, enraptured, at the sight of a monk blundering his way through a snowstorm, accompanied by hauntingly beautiful choral music.  Thus was I introduced to ""The Virgin in the Ice"" on the PBS show ""Mystery!"".  Over the next few weeks I saw as many other Cadfael episodes as I could find, and periodically caught them again as they came and went.  One nifty feature ""Mystery!"" included was Diana Riggs providing some historical background to 12th century England, which is when the Cadfael series is set.I soon learned that the series is based on a set of twenty novels, plus one book of short stories, written by Ellis Peters.  These span the years 1137 through 1145; they chronicle a Welshman named Cadfael, who fought in the Crusades and then retired to the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, in Shrewsbury, to become a monk.  His vast trove of lore, built up during his travels in the Holy Land, serves him quite well as he is called upon to solve various murders throughout the years.  His extensive knowledge of herbs puts him in good stead, as it allows him to leave the confines of the monastery frequently on errands as a healer.  He comes to know the town folk quite well; this gives him plenty of willing helpers.  He has the knack of prying information out of people who would never dream of divulging it to the sheriff, and more than once he courageously harbors fugitives wrongly hunted by the Law.  His many years in the world give him great insight into the darkness which lurks in the souls of men, and, sometimes, even women.Thus, as the episodes began to appear on DVD one by one, I eagerly bought them up.  Finally I gained the ability to watch the entire 13-episode series back-to-back, at will.  Now, there are two ways one could do this:  either in the order of the books, or in the order the series originally aired.  The two are not the same:  while, for the most part, earlier novels tend to appear as earlier episodes, and later novels as later episodes, things are a bit out of order.  In general this matters only to purists, as the threads tying the books together, such as Cadfael's growing relationship with Olivier de Bretagne, are downplayed on the videos or omitted altogether.I decided on series order; it was quite illuminating to watch the series evolve, as the regular actors grew into their roles.The acting is excellent.  Abbots Heribert and Radulfus, the inept Brother Oswin and the ever-suspicious Sergeant Will Warden are all very much the way the books describe them.  Prior Robert and his toady Jerome are both wonderfully obnoxious.  Three different actors play Hugh Beringar throughout the series, but all do reasonably well.  And then there is Sir Derek Jacobi as Cadfael.  He does not much resemble the book Cadfael at all, but it hardly matters -- he's perfect for the part.  When I read the novels, it is Jacobi's face I see and his voice I hear in my mind.Seeing the videos in series order is illuminating for another reason as well.  When the earlier episodes aired, Ellis Peters was still alive and, it appears, able to have some input into how they were developed.  As a result, they are quite faithful to the novels, apart from the necessity of trimming unnecessary details to cram 200+ pages into a 75-minute production.  My particular favorites are ""The Virgin in the Ice"", ""Monk's Hood"" and ""The Devil's Novice"".It is noteworthy, however, that the final three or four episodes, produced after the death of Ellis Peters, are the ones which diverge the most from the books.  One, ""The Pilgrim of Hate"", is almost completely different, other than the basic premise.  The introduction of the ""mos teutonicus"" is downright macabre.  Another, ""The Raven in the Foregate"", is much more melodramatic than the book, almost to the point of being overblown.  It introduces characters which were not in the book, for no obvious reason that I could see; the novel's plot should have been good enough.  And ""The Holy Thief"" turns a sympathetic character, one I happen to like, into a bad guy, which really bothers me.Indeed, seen in the context of the entire series, my enthusiasm for these three episodes has cooled off considerably from when I first saw them, but I still consider them to be passably good.Although ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" is the first book, it actually makes sense to start the series with ""One Corpse Too Many"" instead.  This one serves to introduce all of the major characters -- except for Radulfus, who appears later on.  It also sets up the civil war between King Stephen and his cousin the Empress Maud, which serves as an important backdrop for the entire series.  There's nothing like a little political tension to have the knives coming out in the dark to dispose of one hapless partisan or another.Alas, since the DVDs come directly from the ITV productions, there is no Diana Riggs.  Thus, the best way to get the background for these stories is to read the books, as I have four times over.  It's a shame that the remaining seven novels were never produced, but I've heard that Cadfael was frightfully expensive to do.  Thus, I'm thankful for what I have.Had ""Cadfael:  Complete Collection"" come out ten years ago, I certainly would have pounced on it at once.  It's an excellent buy for anyone who likes all or most of the episodes, or the books.  For those who are more particular, there are also annual boxed sets as well as the individual episodes.",4,Every Episode Worth Watching,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,5483,"['One', 'evening', 'turned',

The differences between the classes of people's rights are very clear. The hardships of his life and the basic bravery shown by Father Cadfael, once a soldier in the Crusades, as he tries to save the injured and unjustly accused is very gripping. This is not a Hollywood ""super hero version"" of ancient life, but a realistic one. It makes you realize how difficult life was for the people of this time period. Of course, even inside the monastery, Father Cadfael has to deal with a pair of rivals who try to undermine his efforts to save the innocent, because the pair are jealous of the notice Father Cadfael receives from the High Sheriff and the Head Friar of their monastery. Father Cadfael uses very elementary methods and tools to save his injured patients and rescue the unjustly accused. The more episodes I have watched, the more involved I have become with this series.

As an apothecary, basically a Medieval pharmacist, Cadfael is also somewhat of a ""chemist"", as the science existed in his time. Written by someone who understood that the Middle-ages were not quite as ""barbaric"" as the popular media has generally portrayed the era, Peters has given us a unique persective on a frequently misunderstood time-period.
