1277400,A27LRU8KUMA6YB,B002LYD2LM,"Amazon Customer ""Goob""","[1, 1]","I bought this from a recommended seller through Amazon and when I opened the box it was shipped in, I thought I got ripped off with a Chinese aftermarket item.  I own the first 3 seasons and the box sets are made with high quality materials that seemed aimed for collector's or to those who like quality in a dvd box set.This season, being the last season, I expected the same.Instead it is a cheap plastic hard cover box that looks like a cheap import and not a quality USA made product.  To make quality box sets with extras for 3 seasons and then take a short cut on the 4th and final season of a show is beyond me.  Whether made by one or several companies/studios or one, the quality should be the same throughout the entire show series.  When I opened this, I was shocked at the cheapness and was upset in thinking it was not the real product I ordered... that is until I went back on Amazon and read other reviews and saw this was indeed the authentic final season, but made cheaply.  It is 5 discs in a clamshell.  That is it, nothing else.  I have not watched the shows yet....almost afraid to - LOL. In reading other reviews, the quality is slightly less than the other seasons, but cannot say for sure.  All and all, if you want the full series, this is a must have.  Jim Hensen I think would have something to say on this if he were alive today.  He was one for quality through and through.",3,"Great Show, Lousy Packaging",1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,1402,"['bought', 'recommended', 'seller', 'Amazon', 'when', 'opened', 'box', 'was', 'shipped', 'thought', 'got', 'ripped', 'off', 'Chinese', 'aftermarket', 'item', 'own', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'box', 'sets', 'are', 'made', 'high', 'quality', 'materials', 'seemed', 'aimed', 'collector', 'who', 'like', 'quality', 'dvd', 'box', 'set.This', 'season', 'being', 'last', 'season', 'expected', 'same.Instead', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'hard', 'cover', 'box', 'cheap', 'import', 'not', 'quality', 'USA', 'made', 'product', 'make', 'quality', 'box', 'sets', 'extras', '3', 'seasons', 'then', 'take', 'short', 'cut', '4th', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'made', 'one', 'several', 'companies/studios', 'one', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'same', 'entire', 'show', 'series', 'When', 'opened', 'was', 'shocked', 'cheapness', 'was', 'upset', 'thinking', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'product', 'ordered', 'went', 'back', 'Amazon', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'saw', 'was', 'indeed', 'authentic', 'final', 'season', 'made', 'cheaply', '5', 'discs', 'clamshell', 'nothing', 'else', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'shows', 'yet', '.almost', 'afraid', 'LOL', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'quality', 'slightly', 'less', 'other', 'seasons', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'sure', 'want', 'full', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'Jim', 'Hensen', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'was', 'one', 'quality']",Fraggle Rock: Season 4

1277404,A2E4B0MD8LZ7K8,B002LYD2LM,Craig,"[0, 0]","This was a fitting farewell to the series, I love the final two episodes, &#34;The Honk of Honks&#34; and &#34;Change of Address&#34; since Doc finally got to meet Gobo and the Fraggles.  I love the ending song for the final episode &#34;Magic be with you&#34; (I think that's what it's called, I'm not sure of the official title) and the slightly altered version of the &#34;Fraggle Rock theme&#34;.  The special features are great too.  I love the behind the scenes feature on the last days of shooting and well as the Fraggle Rock wrap party.  The featurette on the creation of the Fraggle Rock theme is also really good, it's interesting to see/hear what the Fraggle Rock theme could have sounded like had they chosen one of the other versions.That was the good part, now for the bad.  Ordinarily I'd have given this set 5 out of 5 like I did Seasons two and three but it looses 2 stars for the defect on disc 1.  The episodes &#34;Uncle Matt's Discovery&#34;, &#34;Junior Gorg Faces the Music&#34; and &#34;The perfect Blue Rollie&#34; would all freeze and skip randomly on my machine and I couldn't even stop them.  The &#34;stop&#34; feature also wouldn't work on the main menu.  The only way I could stop was to eject the disc.  I got a refund and then bought a replacement copy.  The replacement copy however, had the exact same problems with those exact same episodes, so it wasn't just one defective disc.  I suspect it may be a problem with the manufacturing or the original files that were burned on the discs.  I also know it's not my DVD player since I tried both sets on my brother's DVD player and he had the exact same problems with these same episodes, not to mention none of my other DVD's gave me these problems.All in all I would ordinarily recommend this set but with two different copies having the same defect I'm hesitant to do so; since I find it hard to believe both sets having the same defect could simply be a coincidence.  With the 30th anniversary of Fraggle Rock coming up I would probably recommend waiting to see if they release a new set and getting that one instead.",3,I think their DVDs are defective.,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,2104,"['was', 'fitting', 'farewell', 'series', 'love', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', '34', 'Honk', 'Honks', '34', '34', 'Change', 'Address', '34', 'Doc', 'finally', 'got', 'meet', 'Gobo', 'Fraggles', 'love', 'ending', 'song', 'final', 'episode', '34', 'Magic', 'be', '34', 'think', 'what', 'called', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'official', 'title', 'slightly', 'altered', 'version', '34', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'theme', '34', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'love', 'scenes', 'feature', 'last', 'days', 'shooting', 'well', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'wrap', 'party', 'featurette', 'creation', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'theme', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'interesting', 'see/hear', 'what', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'sounded', 'had', 'chosen', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'good', 'part', 'now', 'bad', 'Ordinarily', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'set', '5', '5', 'did', 'Seasons', 'two', 'three', '2', 'stars', 'defect', 'disc', '1', 'episodes', '34', 'Uncle', 'Matt', 'Discovery', '34', '34', 'Junior', 'Gorg', 'Music', '34', '34', 'perfect', 'Blue', 'Rollie', '34', 'would', 'freeze', 'skip', 'randomly', 'machine', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'stop', '34', 'stop', '34', 'feature', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'main', 'menu', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'stop', 'was', 'eject', 'disc', 'got', 'refund', 'then', 'bought', 'replacement', 'copy', 'replacement', 'copy', 'however', 'had', 'exact', 'same', 'problems', 'exact', 'same', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'defective', 'disc', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'manufacturing', 'original', 'files', 'were', 'burned', 'discs', 'also', 'know', 'not', 'DVD', 'player', 'tried', 'sets', 'brother', 'DVD', 'player', 'had', 'exact', 'same', 'problems', 'same', 'episodes', 'not', 'mention', 'none', 'other', 'DVD', 'gave', 'problems.All', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'recommend', 'set', 'two', 'different', 'copies', 'having', 'same', 'defect', ""'m"", 'hesitant', 'do', 'so', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'sets', 'having', 'same', 'defect', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'coincidence', '30th', 'anniversary', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'coming', 'up', 'would', 'probably', 'recommend', 'waiting', 'see', 'release', 'new', 'set', 'getting', 'one', 'instead']",Fraggle Rock: Season 4

I was thrilled to see that finally the last of the seasons and all the episodes where finally out.  I bought the first three seasons as each came out and was nothing less then impressed with the quality of the Discs, packaging and extras that came with them.  This final release to the set is a complete let down.The image quality looks to me to be lessened, as if they did poor transfers.  The discs aren't unviewable or anything like that, but their is a lot lost on this version over the previous parts of this set.  Also the box that this comes in is not in the original style of the three earlier ones.  There is no included anything extra in the packaging that we got with the three previous releases.  It's just a four disc plastic carrier that's used for any multidisc pack.  Their is nothing special about this.  It's an abrupt and unflattering end to what was a great set.
