I have watched most, if not all of his standup performances available on video, and this one is truly the best. Richard is crude and raunchy, but he speaks the truth that we never talk about! It's really hard to describe how funny this DVD is, because they was just so much material that spanned a lot of subjects. Some of my favorites include Richard's bit about the woods, including a deer and a bear as well his bit about his pet monkey and his dogs. We couldn't leave out the sex part of course, and he has plenty to say on that subject, and you may find yourself thinking of certain relationships when he gets into the sex bit.
