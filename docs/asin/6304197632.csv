406936,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6304197632,Classic film buff,"[1, 1]","My first exposure to Anne Frank's diary was as a thirteen-year-old boy in the eighth grade when I first read excerpts in our English class.  Prior to this, I had a vague knowledge that she was a teen-aged Jewish girl who had perished under that devil Hitler's reign of terror, and had kept a diary while in hiding.  Her black and white photo, solemn with haunting dark eyes, had occasionally gazed out at me in bookstores from the cover of the Pocket Book edition of ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"".  These selected entries were riveting, and made me want to read the entire diary, which I did shortly thereafter.  It was a page-turner, I was very impressed with Anne's nascent talent and skill as a writer, but this was leavened with a heavy sadness knowing the malevolent fate that stalked and ultimately destroyed her.  The unfathomable evil and transcendent horror of the Holocaust was revealed to me with a gut wrenching awful clarity that sickened and disturbed me for several days.  It was hard to come to terms with the fact that this genocide was going on in this ""enlightened"" twentieth century, and such a short time ago!  I read it in 1967; just 22 years after the World War II had ended, it boggled my mind.Reading Anne's diary which only encompassed two years of her all too brief life, piqued my curiosity to know more about her, and over the years I read several excellent books about her which told of her life before and after she went into hiding.  Also, I had read the Pulitzer Prize winning play ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and viewed the 1959 George Stevens film adaption of the same.  Finally I had read in 1995 a new edition of the diary called ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl - the Definitive Edition"", that included approximately thirty percent of new material that Anne's father Otto Frank had excluded from the original edition.  This documentary was released the same year, and reading this most recent edition first is excellent prep work before viewing the film.In both versions, Anne becomes more of a flesh and blood human being, a normal teenager and less the shining icon.  Her flaws as well as her virtues are revealed, which doesn't lessen our appreciation or admiration, but rather augments it.  The tragically short trajectory of her life's journey that began and ended in Germany is presented as thoroughly as possible.  Especially valuable are reminiscences by two of Anne's best friends both of who are familiar to readers of the diary, Hanneli Goslar who was given the alias of ""Lies Goosens"" and Jacqueline van Maarsen who was renamed ""Jopie van der Waal"".  Particularly moving is Mrs. Goslar's recollection of the final meeting of Anne and she separated on opposite sides of a barbed wire fence one bitter dark night in the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp shortly before Anne's death.  This is a cruel contrast to an earlier happier memory of Anne and she running to hug one another on their first day of kindergarten at the Montessori school in Amsterdam.Generous, deserved appreciation is given to that remarkable woman Miep Gies, who was the sole survivor of the quartet that hid and took care of the Franks, van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer for two years in the ""Secret Annex"".  This white haired, grandmotherly woman was a true heroine, remarkable for her sterling character and courage.  Besides putting her husband Jan's and her lives on the line in hiding the group in the ""Secret Annex"", she courageously went to Gestapo headquarters in Amsterdam to try to negotiate the release of the Franks and the others after the arrest.  Sadly, she was unsuccessful, but it was she who saved Anne's diary and writings from the tender mercies of the Nazis just after the raid and kept them locked in her desk awaiting Anne's return.  Her participation is invaluable as one of the few remaining eyewitnesses, perhaps the key one.  There is a touching vignette where Mrs. Gies meets Peter Pfeffer, the son of Fritz Pfeffer for the first time, and he thanks her for all she did for his father.The narration is well done by Kenneth Branagh clearly modulated but somber given the gravity of the events.  However, the choice of Glenn Close to read passages from Anne's diary is unfortunate, her voice is obviously that of a mature woman, unsuitable for a young girl, better choices would have been Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder or Natalie Portman who would play the role in a Broadway revival a few years later.  The cinematography is excellent through the use of computer graphics; the now empty rooms of the ""Secret Annex"" are suddenly transformed into a reasonable facsimile of what it looked like when occupied.  Conversely, there is footage of the entrance to Auschwitz, and the infamous railroad and cattle car shot is the dead of a moonless night lit only by a sweeping searchlight that chills the blood, it's haunted by the ghosts of the innocents murdered there.To wind this up, through photographs and interviews including those with Otto Frank, Anne's father, the viewer gets as close to knowing the real Anne Frank as is possible all these many years later.  Deservedly it was rewarded with an Academy Award for Best Documentary of 1995, and was fittingly accepted by Miep Gies in addition to producer/director Jon Blair.  It's excellently done, but in the last half disturbing and harrowing particularly from the betrayal to the awful end when all but Mr. Frank would perish in the various concentration camps.  Yet as in the diary, Anne's soaring spirit ultimately triumphs.  The final moments shows the only known filmed footage of Anne from 1941 as the camera fleetingly captures her, and Branagh quotes her for the last time.  The title of this review is part of the quote, and kind of proves the old adage ""be careful what you wish for"".  Anne Frank lives on all these years later through her legacy as a gifted writer, but at what a terrible cost.",5,""" I don't want to have lived in vain like most people, I want to go on living after

Instead, she has become an icon, a symbol of hope, and an inspiration to millions of people around the world who have suffered under the hands of despotism and fear. This DVD serves as a documentary, and tribute, to this amazing girls life.Directed by Jon Blair, who previously produced a documentary on the life of Oskar Schindler, brings his skills and expertise to bringing to life the life of Anne and her family as they first flee Germany to set up her home in Amsterdam, and then, to flee into hiding once German invades the Netherlands.  As told through the eyes of her childhood friends, Anne is precocious, impish and fun.  Interviews with Lies Gosslar and others provide first hand accounts about her, and make her real and authentic, not grandios or distorted, as the tendency may be for someone as famous as Anne. This documentary also doesn't shy away from Anne's burgeoning sexuality and her feelings about her adolscence, which provides a more complete picture of this girl.The documentary moves into the Frank family needing to hide from the Nazis in their Secret Annex, and we meet the impressive Miep Gies, who sustained the people living there for two years. The footage of Miep in the Annex itself was astounding, and her testimony honest and compelling. A scene in which the son of Fritz Pfeffer, the Jewish dentist who also hid in the Secret Annex, meets Miep in Annex itself reduced me to tears in an instant; kudos to Blair for making this reunion happen and capture it on film. Amazing cinema.What I appreciated most about this documentary occurs after everyone in captured from the Annex and forced into the hands of the Nazis. Blair painstakingly recounts the final months of the Franks lives, which in past documentaries seems to be rushed over. Blair brings Jewish survivors who knew the Franks back to the camps they were imprisoned in, and shared their experiences. The effect is chilling, and allows us to truly understand the last months of Anne's life more than I ever have before. He brings back Lies to talk about being with Anne during her last few days; incredible.Also amazing, Blair digging up a very brief movie clip of Anne herself, leaning out the window watching a wedding happen on her street. The twelve year old girl becomes even more alive as we see her, hair blowing in the wind, looking up and behind her, not knowing what her fate will be in just a few years.Anne Frank so longed to be known around the world, dreaming of becoming a famous writer, and even began to prepare her diary for publication after the war. While she never lived to see that occur, her legacy and gift to the world, through her inspirational words, remains with us today. And this documentary serves as an excellent tribute to her short, short life.",5,"Good At Heart, and In Our Hearts Forever",1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,3005,"['Young', 'rascally', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'writer', 'movie', 'star', 'other', 'thousand', 'things', 'dreamed', 'fantasized', 'about', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'Instead', 'become', 'icon', 'symbol', 'hope', 'inspiration', 'millions', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'hands', 'despotism', 'fear', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'tribute', 'amazing', 'girls', 'life.Directed', 'Jon', 'Blair', 'who', 'previously', 'produced', 'documentary', 'life', 'Oskar', 'Schindler', 'skills', 'expertise', 'bringing', 'life', 'life', 'Anne', 'family', 'first', 'flee', 'Germany', 'set', 'up', 'home', 'Amsterdam', 'then', 'flee', 'hiding', 'once', 'German', 'Netherlands', 'told', 'eyes', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Anne', 'precocious', 'impish', 'fun', 'Interviews', 'Lies', 'Gosslar', 'others', 'provide', 'first', 'hand', 'accounts', 'make', 'real', 'authentic', 'not', 'grandios', 'distorted', 'tendency', 'may', 'be', 'someone', 'as', 'famous', 'Anne', 'documentary', 'also', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'Anne', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'feelings', 'adolscence', 'more', 'complete', 'picture', 'girl.The', 'documentary', 'moves', 'Frank', 'family', 'needing', 'hide', 'Nazis', 'Secret', 'Annex', 'meet', 'impressive', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'who', 'sustained', 'people', 'living', 'there', 'two', 'years', 'footage', 'Miep', 'Annex', 'was', 'astounding', 'testimony', 'honest', 'compelling', 'scene', 'son', 'Fritz', 'Pfeffer', 'Jewish', 'dentist', 'who', 'also', 'hid', 'Secret', 'Annex', 'Miep', 'Annex', 'reduced', 'tears', 'instant', 'kudos', 'Blair', 'making', 'reunion', 'happen', 'capture', 'film', 'Amazing', 'cinema.What', 'appreciated', 'most', 'documentary', 'everyone', 'captured', 'Annex', 'forced', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'Blair', 'painstakingly', 'final', 'months', 'Franks', 'lives', 'past', 'documentaries', 'be', 'rushed', 'Blair', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'who', 'knew', 'Franks', 'back', 'camps', 'were', 'imprisoned', 'shared', 'experiences', 'effect', 'chilling', 'truly', 'understand', 'last', 'months', 'Anne', 'life', 'more', 'ever', 'have', 'before', 'back', 'talk', 'being', 'Anne', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'incredible.Also', 'amazing', 'Blair', 'digging', 'up', 'very', 'brief', 'movie', 'clip', 'Anne', 'leaning', 'out', 'window', 'watching', 'wedding', 'happen', 'street', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'even', 'more', 'alive', 'see', 'hair', 'blowing', 'wind', 'looking', 'up', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'fate', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'few', 'years.Anne', 'Frank', 'so', 'longed', 'be', 'known', 'world', 'dreaming', 'becoming', 'famous', 'writer', 'even', 'began', 'prepare', 'diary', 'publication', 'war', 'never', 'lived', 'see', 'occur', 'legacy', 'gift', 'world', 'inspirational', 'words', 'today', 'documentary', 'serves', 'excellent', 'tribute', 'short', 'short', 'life']",Anne Frank Remembered VHS

But somuch of that basic material is familiar to any who have read the diary,or know the play that there were few revelations, and I wasn't surewhat the fuss was about.But it is the second half of the film, that fills in with tremendousdetail what happened to Anne and her family and friends after they werediscovered, and after the diary ends that is overwhelmingly powerful.I've struggled with many films and books about the Holocaust. It's allalmost too much for the mind to take in, reducing human suffering toinsane numbers, or piles of dead bodies that the brain can set up asort of emotional firewall around. That's why the most powerful pieceof art about the holocaust I'd encountered before this was ElieWiesel's ""Night"" - by reducing the nightmare to one specific youngboy's experience I could finally feel the emotional impact of the factthat all these numbers and photos of mass graves were real humanbeings.'Anne Frank Remembered' has that same kind of power; by focusing theholocaust to one family's very specific experience, it paradoxicallymakes the enormity of all the suffering real and present.And yet, like Anne Frank herself, this documentary, whileoverwhelmingly sad, also sees the good in people. As much as I wept(and boy did I weep) at the cruelty and death, I also wept at thecourage and love shown by the friends and family who kept Anne alive,and the survivors who carry the memories of those who survived andchose to still embrace the world instead of running and hiding.

But what brought me to tears was Peter Pepper's first and only meeting with Miep. It was astonishing how Miep was so matter-of-fact about everything, she was truly an amazing human being. And Peter's whispered ""Many thanks"" had me sobbing uncontrollably, especially upon hearing he died two months later. (And I know his father was waiting for him in Heaven, his arms held wide open to embrace his son after some 50 years apart)Another devastating portion was Lies Goslar's belief that had Anne known that her father was still alive, she very well may have been able to muster an inner reserve and fight. It might be wishful thinking on my part, but I have to wonder how much the absolute will to live can turn the tide of a disease intent on removing that will.The one question I would love to have answered before I die will always be, who was the betrayer. I know Otto Frank has actually said himself he bore no ill will towards Karl Silberbauer, because he was doing his job.

A similiar sensation overcame me when I saw this neccessary though not entirely satisfying film about her life, and indeed, does so whenever the subject of Anne Frank is broached.But then, why shouldn't it? After all, though it may seem self-evident, the story of Anne Frank is without doubt one of the most tragic of the twentieth-century. Here was a precious human soul, bright, gifted and energetic, literally bursting at the seams with promise and potential, a person whose life was cut short by forces beyond her control. The death of Anne Frank was, in every possible sense of the word, senseless. Her murder, and by extension that of roughly six million equally innocent lives, constitute an inestimable loss.Anne Frank is gone.She should not be.This must never happen again.We must never forget Anne Frank.But then, who can?Her unfulfilled spirit haunts us:Her ghost is everywhere, and always will be.- M.R.",3,The ghost of Anne Frank,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,1215,"['When', 'first', 'visited', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Museum', 'Amsterdam', 'Holland', 'rather', 'claustrophobic', 'apartment', 'tennage', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'family', 'were', 'cooped', 'up', 'two', 'years', 'seeking', 'refuge', 'Nazis', 'experienced', 'immediate', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'sadness', 'pain', 'longing', 'similiar', 'sensation', 'when', 'saw', 'neccessary', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'film', 'life', 'indeed', 'so', 'whenever', 'subject', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'broached.But', 'then', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'may', 'seem', 'self-evident', 'story', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'twentieth-century', 'Here', 'was', 'precious', 'human', 'soul', 'bright', 'gifted', 'energetic', 'literally', 'bursting', 'seams', 'promise', 'potential', 'person', 'life', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'forces', 'control', 'death', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'was', 'possible', 'sense', 'word', 'senseless', 'murder', 'extension', 'roughly', 'six', 'million', 'equally', 'innocent', 'lives', 'constitute', 'inestimable', 'loss.Anne', 'Frank', 'gone.She', 'should', 'not', 'be.This', 'must', 'never', 'happen', 'again.We', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'Anne', 'Frank.But', 'then', 'who', 'can', 'unfulfilled', 'spirit', 'haunts', 'ghost', 'everywhere', 'always', 'will', 'be.-', 'M.R']",Anne Frank Remembered VHS
406951,A2A1XYSB692L6J,6304197632,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[2, 2]","This is the riviting, true and tragic story of Anne Frank -- the impish, mischievious, talented, wise, and ultimately the terribly tragic victim of circumstances. She did not live to see her dreams cf fame and fortune come true -- but she has, in death, become a symbol for the 10 million people who so needlessly died in the concentration camps of World War II.  Their talents, as Anne's talents, died with them -- a loss to their surviving families, their surviving friends -- and humanity at large.  Anne's gift was writing, and observation at what she wrote.  She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  So, sadly, were all the myriad other victims....Kenneth Branagh and Glenn Close, (who reads excerpts from Anne's Diary),narrate the film -- with objectivity and yet with tenderness and, when required, a barely-controlled, yet justified anger. This, as well as 1st-person, eye-witness words of those who knew Anne, bring her short, brilliant, and tragic existence so very vividly to life.  Prejudice, sadly, has SO very, very many faces -- and I am sure that there are SOME people who might think that only Jewish people could give this disc the narration that it deserves.  With feeling and rightous anger, with empathic and almost psychic feeling for those involved, Glenn Close and Kenneth Branagh -- neither one being Jewish -- show that Anne's death, and those of all the other victims, was not just a Jewish tragedy, but, far more, a Human one, as well.This DVD tells her story simply, truely, and without undue sentimentality.  As the saying goes, this DVD tells it like it was...and is.  Those who knew Anne, and who survived the war, are interviewed.  Meip Guies, the secretary who not only hid the Franks, but visited them every day, is seen here, as is Anne's male cousin, who lived in Switzerland during WWII.  A very moving scene comes when the son of the dentist who stayed with the Franks, meets his father's protector, (Ms. Guies), for the first time.  Interviews with Anne's school friends, and the friends she made and met in the two concentration camps, and one transit camp, she was in, are also given.  One of these women had to tell Otto Frank, at the end of the war, that she had seen his daughters die, and she explains what happened at that emotional meeting.Anne Frank's ""secret annex"" has been turned into a museum, and this DVD gives a tour of the surprisingly spacious hiding place.  We see the small room with two beds in it that Anne and her sister Margot slept in, the movie-star pictures, and pictures of Royalty, with which Anne decorated the walls, the dining room, and the rest of the apartment.  Also shown are the steps up to the secret hiding place, and the small bookcase, with books, that hid the ""secret-annex"" from the Nazis.  At least for a while.The before-the-war, early, free days, and transit-camp and concentration-camp experiences of Anne, and the other seven people who hid, are discussed by eye-witness survivors -- often Anne's ""normal world"" friends, who were taken, as well.  They describe a girl who was not perfect -- but who had a sense of fun, of mischief, and a growing, and enormous writing talent.  The suit of Holocaust-deniers, to prove the diary a fake, is aslo gone into, and the ultimate verdict -- that the diary is truly genuine, is also noted.  Watching these eye-witnesses, one cannot help but realize that history is being shown before one's eyes.....  (In passing, I must report that Jerry Springer, TV host and former Cincinatti mayor, gave the best counter the sadly perennial queston: ""Did the Holocaust ever happen?""  I believe he had been interwiewing neo-Nazis on his program, and, in the speech he always gives at the end of each show, mentioned this question.  Mr. Springer looked non-plussed a moent, then said these classic words: ""If the Holocaust -never happened...then what happened to all my aunts and uncles?""How Anne's diary was turned into a book, a play, and a film are also discussed.  The copyright date of this DVD is 1995 -- so the wrenching TV-drama, ""Anne Frank -- the Whole Story"", had not yet been produced.  Nor, of course, the upcoming, (2010), Masterpiece Classics version of the Diary.I have often though that the ""Nazi"" party was very-well named -- unintentioanlly well-named, at least for those who speak English. In English, the word ""Nazi"" is pronouched ""Nat-see"", (or perhaps this is a translitertion from the German).  Indeed, the ""Nat-sees"" did ""NOT see"" humanity for what it really is -- a group of widely differing INDIVIDUALS, who do, (or, usually, do NOT), bear simularities to those in their own families...not to mention those within their national groups.  No one is an EXACT duplicate of anyone else, after all.  And who, anyway, deserves deprivation, slavery and death only because of their nationality? Obviously -- NO ONE!  But the Nazis, (""Nat-sees""), didn't see this.  If one is UNABLE to see, and is blind, that is a personal, and very deep tragedy, though many sightless people have bravely countered this, and have shown us all what courage is and can be.  But it is very, very, VERY different from one WILL ""Nat-see"". that is either a personal choice, or one is a victim of stealty propaganda.  Either way, this is not only a personal tragedy, in that one loses one's ability to THINK clearly and for one's self, but, if enough people become of the ""Nat-see"" persuasion, it becomes also a national tragedy -- for themselves, and, sadly, for so many others.Nazis, past, (and sadly, present as well), speak of ""the Master race"". But if one believes in the Bible, one realizes that He created only TWO people, Adam and Eve -- and that ALL humanity is descended from those two people, only! All people, also, have the same basic body structure, inside and out....and the same basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, love, appreciation, accomplishment, etc.  Further -- from reading about Anne Frank's personality -- that she was intensely interested in Royalty, that she was extremely impatient, and that she knew, inwardly, that EVERY human being has worth, value, and something to give to the world -- I begin to wonder if she was, indeed, an ""Indigo"" person.  Indigos --in present-day, ""New Age"" philosophy, have thse characteristics, and some others, as hallmarks.  And, in present-day, ""New AGe"" philosophy, these ""Indigo peeople"" are supposed to be the next stage in Human evolution! If this is so, as I believe it is, then Anne Frank was the future -- the Nazis, with their deadly and communicable prejudicial ideas, stereotyping, their violence, pitilessness, ruthlessness, unchecked militarism, and meglomania, were definitely of the past...showing the worst that humanity offered, from caveman to middle-ages.  To, sadly, even now....Playful, resourceful, mischievous and ever-curious Anne would have loved computers.  She also would be, I think, very proud of this DVD and how it now availabe f0r playing for anyone with access to a computer. It is a sad story, but if enough people view it, it will be one force to show people living now, and in the future, of a horrible period in Humankind's history, and help to prevent it happening, to any group of people, ever again.Five sad, weeping, but triumphant little stars :_(  :_(  :_(:_(  :_(",5,T R U E.......H I S T O R Y.......( S O B )_:,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,7290,"['riviting',

That such a precious child should have been treated by the Nazis in such a horribly unhuman manner is unthinkable to those who have any shred of human decency. That anyone should be treated in such a brutal manner by virtue of their ethnicity, religion, color or creed, is  inhumanity at its lowest depths and should never, ever happen again.Even though she says she was just being a human being, Miep Gies was a heroine for hiding the Franks, the Van Pelses and the dentist. She was a courageous and kind woman who, like Anne Frank herself, serves as a model of the highest caliber for humanity to follow. Otto Frank also served as an important role model for his parenting methods, for allowing the child Anne to be herself and to grow in her own way.If it hadn't been for the Nazi holocaust, Anne and her sister, along with the others, would have been free to live and let live, and Anne would have undoubtedly become one of the most prolific and inspiring writers of all time, traveling the globe and meeting the movie stars whose photos she still has pasted on the walls of the Anne Frank museum.Shame on the Nazis for curtailing and making an actual, living hell of this beautiful little girl's life and depriving her, her loved ones, other Jews, and the other targets of German fascism of their freedom, well-being and happiness.Thank you for this film which is a testament to caring and kind and courageous people like Miep Gies and fellow travelers,without whom this world would be a dreadful place indeed.May this never happen again, to anyone anywhere in the world, lest the diary and life of Anne Frank be in vain.",5,Never Again,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1940,"['viewers', 'may', 'take', 'second-hand', 'accounts', 'naughtiness', 'face', 'value', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'exuberance', 'little', 'girl', 'often', 'seen', 'gifted', 'babies', 'young', 'children', 'indication', 'active', 'mind', 'Anne', 'became', 'gifted', 'writer', 'accident.The', 'film', 'breathtakingly', 'real', 'such', 'precious', 'child', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'Nazis', 'such', 'horribly', 'unhuman', 'manner', 'unthinkable', 'who', 'have', 'shred', 'human', 'decency', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'such', 'brutal', 'manner', 'virtue', 'ethnicity', 'religion', 'color', 'creed', 'inhumanity', 'lowest', 'depths', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'happen', 'again.Even', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'human', 'being', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'was', 'heroine', 'hiding', 'Franks', 'Van', 'Pelses', 'dentist', 'was', 'courageous', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'model', 'highest', 'caliber', 'humanity', 'follow', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'also', 'served', 'important', 'role', 'model', 'parenting', 'methods', 'allowing', 'child', 'Anne', 'be', 'grow', 'own', 'way.If', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Nazi', 'holocaust', 'Anne', 'sister', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'free', 'live', 'let', 'live', 'Anne', 'would', 'have', 'undoubtedly', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'inspiring', 'writers', 'time', 'traveling', 'globe', 'meeting', 'movie', 'stars', 'photos', 'still', 'pasted', 'walls', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'museum.Shame', 'Nazis', 'curtailing', 'making', 'actual', 'living', 'hell', 'beautiful', 'little', 'girl', 'life', 'depriving', 'loved', 'ones', 'other', 'Jews', 'other', 'targets', 'German', 'fascism', 'freedom', 'well-being', 'happiness.Thank', 'film', 'testament', 'caring', 'kind', 'courageous', 'people', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'whom', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'dreadful', 'place', 'indeed.May', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'world', 'lest', 'diary', 'life', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'be', 'vain']",Anne Frank Remembered VHS

406955,A170QM825KM60W,6304197632,rmcrae,"[3, 3]","And so begins Anne Frank Remembered, a beautifully crafted in-depth look at the life, death, and timeless appeal of a young Jewish girl who wished to ""live on even after my death."" Filmmaker Jon Blair paints a fuller picture of who Anne Frank really was by interviewing some of the people who knew her best including childhood friends Hanneli Goslar and Jaqueline van Maarsen. Both describe the girl as a social butterfly whose very presence demanded attention and never backed down when it came to speaking her mind. Hanneli recalls a famous saying her mother made about Anne: ""God knows everything, but Anne knows everything better!""She was feisty, fun loving, and sometimes bossy. Much different than her proper, quieter sister Margot. A family friend remembers how different the Frank parents were when it came to disciplining their children. Mother Edith was the no nonsense type that scolded Anne whenever she drew negative attention to herself, but Papa Otto saw her as the apple of his eye and allowed her to be a free spirit.Much detail is given to the tightening vise of the anti-Jewish Nazi laws and the dreaded call-up that led to the Frank's decision to go into hiding. Otto's employees including the young Miep Gies took the dangerous tasks of hiding the family (as well as the Van Pels and dentist Fritz Pfeffer). Nearing 85 at the time of her interview, Miep recalls the daily task of supplying food and other goods to those in hiding and the constant fear of discovery. Her English wasn't the best, but her occasional use of bad grammar and long pauses make her more endearing. Her meeting with Dr. Pfeffer's son Peter is so moving and real. Unfortunately he passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly afterward. Speaking of Pfeffer, those who've read the diary are already familiar with Anne's many run-ins with the seemingly stern man. Little did she know that both shared a common love of life and freedom nearly stifled by their cramped quarters.Fellow captives Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper and Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder share their memories of the days following the arrests of those in the Secret Annex to the transit camp Westerbork and death camps Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, where Anne briefly reunited with friend Hanneli on the other side of a fence. Hanneli wonders out loud if Anne might've fought harder to survive if she'd known her father hadn't been gassed on arrival at Auschwitz. Sadly Otto was the only survivor and Miep handed over his daughter's diary only after she'd learned the girl wasn't coming back. She hated being called a hero, but what she did was truly heroic and without her Anne's diary would've been lost forever. The last part of the film covers the diary's publication and the impact it continues to make to this very day.The most striking scene is of 12 year old Anne leaning on her balcony watching a wedding take place on the street below. The clip lasts only seven seconds yet it cements the fact that she was a real flesh and blood girl who had no idea of how her short life would end or the legacy she'd leave behind.",5,"She is perhaps Hitler's best known victim, but what was Anne Frank really like?",1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,3095,"['so', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Remembered', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'in-depth', 'look', 'life', 'death', 'timeless', 'appeal', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'who', 'wished', 'live', 'even', 'death', 'Filmmaker', 'Jon', 'Blair', 'fuller', 'picture', 'who', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'really', 'was', 'interviewing', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'best', 'including', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Hanneli', 'Goslar', 'Jaqueline', 'van', 'Maarsen', 'describe', 'girl', 'social', 'butterfly', 'very', 'presence', 'demanded', 'attention', 'never', 'backed', 'down', 'when', 'came', 'speaking', 'mind', 'Hanneli', 'famous', 'saying', 'mother', 'made', 'Anne', 'God', 'everything', 'Anne', 'everything', 'better', 'was', 'feisty', 'fun', 'loving', 'sometimes', 'bossy', 'Much', 'different', 'proper', 'quieter', 'sister', 'Margot', 'A', 'family', 'friend', 'how', 'different', 'Frank', 'parents', 'were', 'when', 'came', 'disciplining', 'children', 'Mother', 'Edith', 'was', 'nonsense', 'type', 'scolded', 'Anne', 'whenever', 'drew', 'negative', 'attention', 'herself', 'Papa', 'Otto', 'saw', 'apple', 'eye', 'allowed', 'be', 'free', 'spirit.Much', 'detail', 'given', 'tightening', 'vise', 'anti-Jewish', 'Nazi', 'laws', 'dreaded', 'call-up', 'led', 'Frank', 'decision', 'go', 'hiding', 'Otto', 'employees', 'including', 'young', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'took', 'dangerous', 'tasks', 'hiding', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'Van', 'Pels', 'dentist', 'Fritz', 'Pfeffer', 'Nearing', '85', 'time', 'interview', 'Miep', 'daily', 'task', 'supplying', 'food', 'other', 'goods', 'hiding', 'constant', 'fear', 'discovery', 'English', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'occasional', 'use', 'bad', 'grammar', 'long', 'pauses', 'make', 'more', 'endearing', 'meeting', 'Dr.', 'Pfeffer', 'son', 'Peter', 'so', 'moving', 'real', 'Unfortunately', 'passed', 'away', 'long', 'battle', 'cancer', 'shortly', 'afterward', 'Speaking', 'Pfeffer', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'diary', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'Anne', 'many', 'run-ins', 'seemingly', 'stern', 'man', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'shared', 'common', 'love', 'life', 'freedom', 'nearly', 'stifled', 'cramped', 'quarters.Fellow', 'captives', 'Janny', 'Brandes-Brilleslijper', 'Rachel', 'van', 'Amerongen-Frankfoorder', 'share', 'memories', 'days', 'following', 'arrests', 'Secret', 'Annex', 'transit', 'camp', 'Westerbork', 'death', 'camps', 'Auschwitz', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'where', 'Anne', 'briefly', 'reunited', 'friend', 'Hanneli', 'other', 'side', 'fence', 'Hanneli', 'out', 'loud', 'Anne', 'might', ""'ve"", 'fought', 'harder', 'survive', ""'d"", 'known', 'father', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'gassed', 'arrival', 'Auschwitz', 'Sadly', 'Otto', 'was', 'only', 'survivor', 'Miep', 'handed', 'over', 'daughter', 'diary', 'only', ""'d"", 'learned', 'girl', 'was', ""n't"", 'coming', 'back', 'hated', 'being', 'called', 'hero', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'truly', 'heroic', 'Anne', 'diary', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lost', 'forever', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'diary', 'publication', 'impact', 'make', 'very', 'most', 'striking', 'scene', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Anne', 'leaning', 'balcony', 'watching', 'wedding', 'take', 'place', 'street', 'clip', 'only', 'seven', 'seconds', 'yet', 'fact', 'was', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'short', 'life', 'would', 'end', 'legacy', ""'d"", 'leave', 'behind']",Anne Frank Remembered VHS

Narrated by Kenneth Branagh, with selected readings from Anne's diary by Glenn Close, this video paints a haunting, heartbreaking portrait of one of Hitler's most famous victims through the personal reminiscences of her surviving friends as well as others who survived the Nazi death camps.  There are excerpts from interviews with the late Otto Frank, Anne's father, as well as interviews with Miep Gies (the woman who supplied the Secret Annex as well as keeping it and its occupants hidden from the SS), Hanneli Goslar (Anne's friend), and Peter Pfeffer (son of dentist Fritz Pfeffer, who was also in the Secret Annex), among many others.  They all paint a picture of a young girl who was just on the brink of womanhood when she died, and who had a lot of hope for the future.  Anne was the typical obnoxious youngster, and yet when one listens to the words of Miep Gies and others who knew her well, their words combine with the images on the video to show that Anne was so much more than what she seemed to be on the surface--forced by circumstance to grow up before her time, but at the same time able to retain that youthful hope.Watch the video by itself, or read The Diary of Anne Frank and then watch the video--Anne Frank Remembered will stick in your mind for a long time.",5,Wonderful personal insights from friends and family of Anne,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,1454,"['Ever', 'read', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'child', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'know', 'girl', 'book', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Remembered', 'perfect', 'purpose', 'Narrated', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'selected', 'readings', 'Anne', 'diary', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'video', 'haunting', 'heartbreaking', 'portrait', 'one', 'Hitler', 'most', 'famous', 'victims', 'personal', 'reminiscences', 'surviving', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'who', 'survived', 'Nazi', 'death', 'camps', 'are', 'excerpts', 'interviews', 'late', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'Anne', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'woman', 'who', 'supplied', 'Secret', 'Annex', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'occupants', 'hidden', 'SS', 'Hanneli', 'Goslar', 'Anne', 'friend', 'Peter', 'Pfeffer', 'son', 'dentist', 'Fritz', 'Pfeffer', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Secret', 'Annex', 'many', 'others', 'paint', 'picture', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'brink', 'womanhood', 'when', 'died', 'who', 'had', 'lot', 'hope', 'future', 'Anne', 'was', 'typical', 'obnoxious', 'youngster', 'yet', 'when', 'one', 'words', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'others', 'who', 'knew', 'well', 'words', 'combine', 'images', 'video', 'show', 'Anne', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'surface', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'grow', 'up', 'time', 'same', 'time', 'able', 'retain', 'youthful', 'hope.Watch', 'video', 'read', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'then', 'watch', 'video', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Remembered', 'will', 'stick', 'mind', 'long', 'time']",Anne Frank Remembered VHS

406960,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6304197632,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""Anne Frank Remembered"" is a well-compiled documentary that provides deep insights -  into the life of Anne Frank, the famous diarist who recorded her experiences as a Jew in hiding with her family and acquaintances in Nazi-occupied Holland, of her life before going into hiding, insights into her character as gleaned through interviews with her childhood friends and acquiantances,  as well as portraying the horrific events that led to the Final Solution, i.e. the Holocaust [ film reels of Jews being persecuted & deported, scenes of concentration camps etc].The documentary is narrated by Kenneth Branagh and excerpts from the diary are read by Glenn Close. It begins with a close look at Anne's background prior to her going into hiding with her family. Anne's family are German Jews, and Anne's father Otto actually served as an officer in the German Army during WW I. However, when Hitler came to power in 1933, his virulent anti-semitism motivates the Franks to leave Germany - most go to neutral Switzerland but Otto takes his wife Edith, and daughters Margot and Anne to Holland where he has business connections.Through some insightful and candid interviews with Anne's childhood friends and acquiantances such as Hanneli Goslar and also Miep Gies [one of the Dutch Gentiles that helped the Frank family whilst they were in hiding], we discover Anne's natural tendency to be the center of attention, her precociousness and outspokenness.When the Nazis invade Holland, Otto Frank decides his family should go into hiding - and arrangements are made for them to hide with the Van Pels' at the office where Otto used to conduct his business. When Margot receives a deportation order, the Franks' go into immediate hiding, giving outsiders the impression they left for Switzerland.Once in hiding, Anne pours out her innermost thoughts and feelings to her prized confidante - her diary [a present from Otto on her 13th birthday]. Contained within the diary are Anne's intimate thoughts on the pains and joys of adolescence, her dreams and her frustrations, especially with her mother [whom Anne felt didn't really understand her] and also Mr ""Dussel"" [the dentist Mr Pfeffer]. It was quite a revelation to listen to Mr Pfeffer's son disagree with Anne's unflattering portrayal of his father in the diary. It was also poignant to see this grown man tear up and thank Miep Gies for helping his father go into hiding.The latter half of the documentary attempts to reconstruct the events that occurred after the Franks and the rest were captured by the Gestapo - their brief stint in prison before being sent off to Westerbork [a transit camp] and finally deported to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. The retelling of the tragic fates that befell these innocent people is heartwrenching indeed.The final scene that has stayed with me is of Anne watching a wedding from her apartment window - it is the only moving footage of Anne that has remained till this day...though brief, it captures this young girl in a moment in time when she was filled with all those childhood dreams, and still untouched by the tragic events that were soon to follow. It serves as a poignant reminder of what might have been had this lovely young woman lived to realise her full potential.
