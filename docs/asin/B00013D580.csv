792019,A2QJC8A2HN5FWW,B00013D580,718 Session,"[21, 22]","It is always interesting to watch an old movie about an older time. This 1976 examination of the McCarthy-era serves a couple of purposes. At a time when the cold war was focusing on East Asia, the time was right for a re-examation of the excesses of the 50s lest they fade from memory (something that still applies to today). We start off during the opening credits with newsreel scenes from 1952: Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, frontlines from the Korean War, Marilyn Monroe getting her star on Hollywood Blvd, the Rosenbergs being carted off to their execution, new cars, new homes complete with bomb shelters, etc. But the movie focusus on the blacklisitng of writers, directors, and actors in entertainment; specifically at NBC television. The details and the methodology of the blacklist are exact and don't involve a lot of exposition. Halfway through the film, you get a fairly complete picture of how the blacklist worked.The movie is also a good old-fashioned ""Screw You!"". The film was written by a blacklisted writer (who is obviously drawing from his own experience), directed by a blacklisted director and is populated (not exclusively) by blacklisted actors. The actors who were blacklisted get their own titles in the closing credits.And thirdly, (and most importantly) the movie is good entertainment. Amateur bookie Harold Prince, described by his brother as ""a lowlife bum"", cares about two things: making money with as little effort as possible and getting laid. He has no apparent talent and no political convictions. Prince's lifelong buddy Al Miller (played by Mike ""Jack Tanner"" Murphy) has problems of his own: despite award-winning work, he can't get a job writing because word is out that he marched in a May Day parade. Al makes a proposition. He writes the stuff, Harold submits it, and Harold gets to keep 10% of the money.By his own admission, Harold knows nothing and cares nothing about politics or the blacklist. (""Why don't you just sue someone?"" he asks). But he doesn't protest: this is easy money, he takes it. When it works, he takes on more writers and finds himself getting both more easy money and more tail than he would have imagined; but as he starts to realize some of the bigger issues at stake, he very slowly (VERY slowly) starts developing a conscience.The humor comes from Prince, trying horribly to fake being a writer. The producers of the TV shows he writes for love him because he doesn't act like a writer. As he becomes more popular, he keeps trying to play it cool with varying results. He finds himself getting very used to success and keeps thinking he can just finesse his way out of whatever problems come up. There are also some priceless scenes with the writers he fronts for as he keeps needing to be reminded that he's not the talented one.Special paragraph for people who hate Woody Allen:Don't let that stop you from seeing this. It is not ""A Woody Allen Movie."" (aka ""Movie about being neurotic in New York"") Woody Allen plays Prince. He doesn't write, he doesn't direct, he even tones down the uber-nebbish character he usually plays. With everything that's come up about Allen since 1975, it is easy to forget that the guy can be very, very funny.But even though Woody is the lead, Zero Mostel (in one of his last films) is the star of this picture. In a couple of scenes we watch him go from top-of-the-world everybody-loves-me, to I've-had-a-setback-but-they-still-love-me, to deep despair. This is made particularly poignent since it parallels Mostel's own career. Even if you don't know Mostel's story (he came up through vaudeville and when he was discharged for disability, spent the rest of the war with the USO entertaining the troops, became a huge splash in Hollywood then couldn't work for 10 years when a producer turned his name over the the House of Un-American Committee and Mostel refused to implicate any of his colleagues in the entertainment industry) his peformance is incredible to watch.  You go from hating the guy, to loving him, to pitying him.  His emotions really run the gamut.If there's one negative, it is that the DVD has NO features at all.  If a flick ever cried out for a special edition, this is it.So give it a rent when you've got a free night. Its got everything: humor, sex, political intrigue, nostalgia, Danny Aiello as a guy selling fruit, Andrea Marcovicci's film debut, and other historical importance.",5,"Great movie, short on features",1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,4408,"['always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'old', 'movie', 'older', 'time', '1976', 'examination', 'McCarthy-era', 'couple', 'purposes', 'time', 'when', 'cold', 'war', 'was', 'focusing', 'East', 'Asia', 'time', 'was', 'right', 're-examation', 'excesses', '50s', 'lest', 'fade', 'memory', 'something', 'still', 'today', 'start', 'opening', 'credits', 'newsreel', 'scenes', '1952', 'Joltin', 'Joe', 'DiMaggio', 'frontlines', 'Korean', 'War', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'getting', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'Blvd', 'Rosenbergs', 'being', 'carted', 'execution', 'new', 'cars', 'new', 'homes', 'complete', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'etc', 'movie', 'focusus', 'blacklisitng', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'entertainment', 'specifically', 'NBC', 'television', 'details', 'methodology', 'blacklist', 'are', 'exact', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'lot', 'exposition', 'Halfway', 'film', 'get', 'fairly', 'complete', 'picture', 'how', 'blacklist', 'worked.The', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'Screw', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'blacklisted', 'writer', 'who', 'obviously', 'drawing', 'own', 'experience', 'directed', 'blacklisted', 'director', 'populated', 'not', 'exclusively', 'blacklisted', 'actors', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'blacklisted', 'get', 'own', 'titles', 'closing', 'credits.And', 'thirdly', 'most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Amateur', 'bookie', 'Harold', 'Prince', 'described', 'brother', 'lowlife', 'bum', 'two', 'things', 'making', 'money', 'as', 'little', 'effort', 'possible', 'getting', 'laid', 'apparent', 'talent', 'political', 'convictions', 'Prince', 'lifelong', 'buddy', 'Al', 'Miller', 'played', 'Mike', 'Jack', 'Tanner', 'Murphy', 'problems', 'own', 'award-winning', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'writing', 'word', 'out', 'marched', 'May', 'Day', 'parade', 'Al', 'proposition', 'stuff', 'Harold', 'Harold', 'keep', '10', '%', 'money.By', 'own', 'admission', 'Harold', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'politics', 'blacklist', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'sue', 'someone', ""n't"", 'protest', 'easy', 'money', 'When', 'more', 'writers', 'getting', 'more', 'easy', 'money', 'more', 'tail', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'realize', 'bigger', 'issues', 'stake', 'very', 'slowly', 'VERY', 'slowly', 'developing', 'conscience.The', 'humor', 'Prince', 'trying', 'horribly', 'fake', 'being', 'writer', 'producers', 'TV', 'love', ""n't"", 'act', 'writer', 'more', 'popular', 'trying', 'play', 'cool', 'varying', 'results', 'getting', 'very', 'used', 'success', 'thinking', 'can', 'just', 'finesse', 'way', 'problems', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'also', 'priceless', 'scenes', 'writers', 'needing', 'be', 'reminded', 'not', 'talented', 'one.Special', 'paragraph', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing', 'not', 'A', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Movie', 'Movie', 'being', 'neurotic', 'New', 'York', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Prince', ""n't"", 'write', ""n't"", 'direct', 'even', 'down', 'uber-nebbish', 'character', 'usually', 'everything', 'come', 'up', 'Allen', '1975', 'easy', 'forget', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'funny.But', 'even', 'Woody', 'lead', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'star', 'picture', 'couple', 'scenes', 'watch', 'go', 'top-of-the-world', 'everybody-loves-me', ""I've-had-a-setback-but-they-still-love-me"", 'deep', 'despair', 'made', 'particularly', 'poignent', 'Mostel', 'own', 'career', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mostel', 'story', 'came', 'up', 'vaudeville', 'when', 'was', 'discharged', 'disability', 'spent', 'rest', 'war', 'USO', 'entertaining', 'troops', 'became', 'huge', 'splash', 'Hollywood', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'work', '10', 'years', 'when', 'producer', 'turned', 'name', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Committee', 'Mostel', 'refused', 'implicate', 'colleagues', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'peformance', 'incredible', 'watch', 'go', 'hating', 'guy', 'loving', 'pitying', 'emotions', 'really', 'run', 'gamut.If', 'one', 'negative', 'DVD', 'NO', 'features', 'flick', 'ever', 'cried', 'out', 'special', 'edition', 'it.So', 'give', 'rent', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'free', 'night', 'got', 'everything', 'humor', 'sex', 'political', 'intrigue', 'nostalgia', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'guy', 'selling', 'fruit', 'Andrea', 'Marcovicci', 'film', 'debut', 'other', 'historical', 'importance']",N/A
792020,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B00013D580,Aco,"[4, 4]","This film is so good, it's important. As a rebuff against the damage dealt certain artists in the early 50's, including director Martin Ritt and writer Walter Bernstein, this is a message film, as well as a good time.In the times of the Red Scare, when Sen. McCarthy was hunting down real and/or supposed Communist ""infiltrators,"" those in Hollywood who had Socialist or Communist affiliations were blacklisted and unable to work. Some found others, Fronts, whose past wasn't deemed treasonouos, to put their names on scripts-as I realize now, only writers could do this-and turn the paycheck over to the real writer, for a fee.Such is the case for Woody in this. But it is a refreshing Allen here, with a minimum of his patented neurotic persona, and some real acting. While funny and witty, the film is also menacing. We see the interrogations levelled on the accused by PI-type investigators, and the according concessions made by desperate people to compromise themselves.A large note of awe must be directed to Zero Mostel here. Himself a victim of the witch-hunts of HUAC, his Hecky Brown is a consomate entertainer, but ultimately a destroyed man...a beautifully tragic performance.Great film. Worthy of a history class, one willing to show the damage done by fear mongering.",4,"""It's Nice when Nice Things Happen to Nice People.""",1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,1282,"['film', 'so', 'good', 'important', 'rebuff', 'damage', 'dealt', 'certain', 'artists', 'early', '50', 'including', 'director', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'writer', 'Walter', 'Bernstein', 'message', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'time.In', 'times', 'Red', 'Scare', 'when', 'Sen.', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'hunting', 'down', 'real', 'and/or', 'supposed', 'Communist', 'infiltrators', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'had', 'Socialist', 'Communist', 'affiliations', 'were', 'blacklisted', 'unable', 'work', 'found', 'others', 'Fronts', 'past', 'was', ""n't"", 'deemed', 'treasonouos', 'put', 'names', 'scripts-as', 'realize', 'now', 'only', 'writers', 'could', 'do', 'this-and', 'turn', 'paycheck', 'real', 'writer', 'fee.Such', 'case', 'Woody', 'refreshing', 'Allen', 'here', 'minimum', 'patented', 'neurotic', 'persona', 'real', 'acting', 'funny', 'witty', 'film', 'also', 'menacing', 'see', 'interrogations', 'levelled', 'accused', 'PI-type', 'investigators', 'according', 'concessions', 'made', 'desperate', 'people', 'compromise', 'themselves.A', 'large', 'note', 'awe', 'must', 'be', 'directed', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'here', 'victim', 'witch-hunts', 'HUAC', 'Hecky', 'Brown', 'consomate', 'entertainer', 'ultimately', 'destroyed', 'man', 'beautifully', 'tragic', 'performance.Great', 'film', 'Worthy', 'history', 'class', 'one', 'willing', 'show', 'damage', 'done', 'fear', 'mongering']",N/A

Next B-29s dropping bombs, then other movie news films from that era. You will remember them if you are over 65 years. Alfred Miller, a big TV write, visits his friend. Howard places a bet in a bar. Miller is blacklisted, he can't find work as he is a ""communist sympathizer"" (a vague term). Miller wants a ""real person"" as a front for his stories. He offers ""10%"" to Howard for this. Howard needs money to pay for his gambling losses. His brother gives him the money and warns him against his losses. Howard's script is accepted, its ""first class"". We see the management of a TV show, they are just employees of the network corporation. The owners of a blacklisting business interview Hecky Brown about his past activities. Was he duped? He is only an actor who does as he is told. [Just like the announcers on radio and TV.]We see a TV show on Studio One-two. Howard takes a girl to lunch (she is involved with a stockbroker). A writer needs experience from life. Howard writes well about women. Howard still needs money. Can he front for other writers? One writer tells the purpose of the blacklist"" it stifles political protest. They discuss the problems of taxes, and how tax returns are used. Actors are rejected as ""not right for the part"". [Is this like age discrimination?] Howard is told to ""keep walking"" as he meets a writer on the street who is under surveillance by the FBI. The TV producer needs a fast rewrite to avoid mentioning the phrase ""gas chamber""! Howard calls his source from a telephone booth. Howard gets publicity. Is this too much? Hecky Brown offers to cooperate to get work. Can he get close to Howard Prince and learn more about him? Howard is shocked to learn girlfriend Florence quit her job! Does she know what is in her best interest? [Decisions made by emotions are seldom the best.]Hecky becoms friendly with Howard. [Does he ask too many questions? Is this the sign of an agent?] Show business is still business. Howard learned from experience, that is why he never wrote earlier. Hecky gets emotional and is fired again (by a friend). Hecky uses his opportunity to snoop into Howard's papers! An advertiser talks to a TV producer about the actors he employs. [Is this different from the influence of advertisers on newspapers?] Howard has picked up a tail. Howard pays by check (!), not untraceable cash. Howard visits a book store to see Florence. They broke off their relationship. Howard gets a subpoena to testify before a Congressional Committee. Can one person say ""No"" to upset things? [No.] Phil makes a phone call, but Howard must go. He is questioned about Miller and his friends Delaney and Phelps. [Note the diplomatic smoothness of the corporate lawyer.] Will Howard be a ""friendly witness""? Howard explains his plans. Is it fixed? [The use of cream was then a treatment for stomach ulcers. In Europe they used sauerkraut juice (acid with vitamin C).]Hecky comes for a visit and questions him. ""The water is full of sharks."" Hecky checks into a hotel room and opens a window. A man photographs a funeral. Howard visits Florence and talks about his activities. She is surprised. Howard plans to beat the Committee. [Is that possible for him?] They question Howard but he doesn't answer directly or cooperate. Can Howard be nailed by the Committee? He plays stupid, but admits to placing bets. ""Be practical"" says his lawyer. But Howard makes a dramatic exit. Later a handcuffed Howard is led away. People carry sings in protest.The credits list a number of people, some were blacklisted in the early 1950s (but survived). The blacklist was a tool to threaten people who questioned the Cold War and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Widespread atomic bombing would create a ""nuclear winter"" (like an epidemic of volcano eruptions) that would create Global Cooling from the resultant dust storms. Many people and animals would be killed from the loss of vegetation (less sunlight) and nuclear radiation. It would create a new Ice Age or a Dark Age from the loss of sunlight. There would be darkness at noon.

792022,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00013D580,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 3]","The various blanket infringements on the rights of American citizens and others since the criminal events of 9/11 hardly represent the first time that the American government has seen fit to curtail those rights. The Palmer Raids roundup of reds, radicals and foreigners in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution at the tail end of World War I comes to mind. As done the subject of this film, the red scare against communist and other labor radicals after World War II with the onset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, a former ally. The name of this period narrowly is given in the history books as the McCarthy witch-hunt era, although that hardly dose justice to the widespread political paranoia, high and low, in America at that time. The signature event was the execution of the Rosenbergs, Julius and Ethel, for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. As this film points out as it unfolds that  political perfect storm dragged in and ruined many  people from many fields, probably none more publicized than in the entertainment industry especially film and the emerging television medium.Woody Allen has performed many roles over the year from nerdy romantic lead to nerdy neurotic New York intellectual and social commentator but this is one of the few roles of his where the subject matter is more than just fodder for his sardonic writing or comedic talents. The story line here is rather simple, if the politics are rather more complex. Woody, a bright but underachieving New York bar cashier Howard Prince, as a favor (and to get some much needed cash as well) to his blacklisted lefty childhood television writer friend (played by Michael Murphy) agrees to ""front"" for him. This means that said friend does the writing and Woody gets the credit, the cash and off-handedly as is the case with many commercial productions the girl. In short order Woody gets to like the notoriety and the new lifestyle and agrees to front for other blacklisted writers. Then the real trouble starts.During the early 1950's it was not enough to write sanitary material for the mass media (approved by outsiders with their own agendas), it was not enough to apologize to various Congressional committees and their cohorts for youthful, innocent and, frankly, acceptable leftist political beliefs in order to survive in the entertainment industry (the subject here but it could have been in the trade unions, education, governmental service or almost any other facet of American life at the time). One had to grovel and name names. And the bulk of those who were called before the committees or faced other types of pressure did do, with regret, with relish or with indifference. But they did it.There is an incredibly poignant sub theme that runs throughout this film that details the pressures in the career-shattering of one of the ""recanters"", Hecky Brown (masterfully played by Zero Mostel, blacklisted in the 1950's himself as was the director Martin Ritt and some of the others involved in this production), who in the end gives up Woody to the committees- finks on him, in other words. However filled with remorse Hecky commits suicide. That was not common to be sure. Hell, those were desperate times and not everyone has the courage to say no. Woody's character, in the convoluted, Allen way does just that. Just says no. And pays the consequences. So in the end there were choices. For every Elia Kazan, Elizabeth Bentley and the like there was a Howard Fast, a Dashiell Hammett and the like who said no.  As some recently released information has indicated the Rosenbergs paid the ultimate price for their refusal to name names.

Barten,"[0, 5]","I had to see this movie because my real life was based on the idea that this kind of excitement is usually reserved for the experiences that money can't buy.  I was surprised when the Secret Service was interested in having me sign a release to allow appropriate authorities to examine a photocopy of my 1989-1999 psychiatric files to determine if I needed to be on a list of dangerous persons that the government would be trying to prevent from flying or entering special safe zones for politicians who would like to stay far away from crazy people who could totally blow their cool.  Since politics lately is like the idea that a Vietnam war hero is most likely to be treated like the oxymoron it always had the potential to become, I could even complain that this movie did not come close to the issues which make the current situation more like the movie `Fahrenheit 9/11.'  But the people who made this movie knew what they were doing to protect their right to say whatever they wanted to say.That Woody Allen and Zero Mostel managed to make a serious movie, `The Front,' which is based on the experiences of the blacklisted writers, actors, and the director that could give meaning to ideas like taking the fifth and naming names, still seems important, even though official investigation of subversive activities in the entertainment industry is hardly what it used to be.  In the field of philosophy, Martin Heidegger retains a bad reputation among some people for terminating certain academic careers by calling certain people un-German or Jewish when that was his job and what his Fuhrer wanted, so some highly educated people are more sensitive to this kind of issue than others.  Woody Allen has the ideal character from a modern American standpoint, able to play complete apathy, concerned that anyone should be in trouble, but hardly prone to accept the network's advice, `Name Hecky Brown.  He's dead.'  Sometimes death is more than just nature's way of telling certain people to slow down, and being an expert in this kind of death is not as comic as we keep pretending.  In another context, Woody Allen said, `Intellectuals are like the mafia; they only kill their own.'  This is one of the truer things he ever said, possibly the truest in my case.  This film is like a layer of history in the crusade against godless Communism that the United States of America went through in the 1950's to get to the position it is in today, which is a different crusade in which comedy can hardly be faulted for failing to keep up with what is going on in reality.Zero Mostel pretending to be a spy, knocking on a door saying, `Open up, this is the police!' is also the kind of behavior I observe in neighbors who are trying to participate in my form of paranoia.  Anyone who has ever been to Harvard Law School should have some way to keep from sympathizing too much with the character that Zero Mostel plays in this movie, but I should save my sympathy for other people who already spent all the money they ever had.  If comedy were an art form, I still wouldn't be funny, and that is what really hurts me, but this DVD is great either way.",5,"See it now, before this exciting moment passes",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,3147,"['had', 'see', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'based', 'idea', 'kind', 'excitement', 'usually', 'reserved', 'experiences', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'Secret', 'Service', 'was', 'interested', 'having', 'sign', 'release', 'allow', 'appropriate', 'authorities', 'examine', 'photocopy', '1989-1999', 'psychiatric', 'files', 'determine', 'needed', 'be', 'list', 'dangerous', 'persons', 'government', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'prevent', 'flying', 'entering', 'special', 'safe', 'zones', 'politicians', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'crazy', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'totally', 'blow', 'cool', 'politics', 'lately', 'idea', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'hero', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'treated', 'oxymoron', 'always', 'had', 'potential', 'become', 'could', 'even', 'complain', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'issues', 'make', 'current', 'situation', 'more', 'movie', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'protect', 'right', 'say', 'wanted', 'say.That', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'managed', 'make', 'serious', 'movie', 'Front', 'based', 'experiences', 'blacklisted', 'writers', 'actors', 'director', 'could', 'give', 'meaning', 'ideas', 'taking', 'fifth', 'naming', 'names', 'still', 'important', 'even', 'official', 'investigation', 'subversive', 'activities', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'hardly', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'field', 'philosophy', 'Martin', 'Heidegger', 'bad', 'reputation', 'people', 'terminating', 'certain', 'academic', 'careers', 'calling', 'certain', 'people', 'un-German', 'Jewish', 'when', 'was', 'job', 'what', 'Fuhrer', 'wanted', 'highly', 'educated', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'issue', 'others', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'ideal', 'character', 'modern', 'American', 'standpoint', 'able', 'play', 'complete', 'apathy', 'concerned', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'trouble', 'hardly', 'prone', 'accept', 'network', 'advice', 'Name', 'Hecky', 'Brown', 'dead', 'Sometimes', 'death', 'more', 'just', 'nature', 'way', 'telling', 'certain', 'people', 'slow', 'down', 'being', 'expert', 'kind', 'death', 'not', 'as', 'comic', 'keep', 'pretending', 'context', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'said', 'Intellectuals', 'are', 'mafia', 'only', 'kill', 'own', 'one', 'truer', 'things', 'ever', 'said', 'possibly', 'truest', 'case', 'film', 'layer', 'history', 'crusade', 'godless', 'Communism', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'went', '1950', 'get', 'position', 'today', 'different', 'crusade', 'comedy', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'faulted', 'failing', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'reality.Zero', 'Mostel', 'pretending', 'be', 'spy', 'knocking', 'door', 'saying', 'Open', 'up', 'police', 'also', 'kind', 'behavior', 'observe', 'neighbors', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'participate', 'form', 'paranoia', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'should', 'have', 'way', 'keep', 'sympathizing', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'movie', 'should', 'save', 'sympathy', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'spent', 'money', 'ever', 'had', 'comedy', 'were', 'art', 'form', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'what', 'really', 'DVD', 'great', 'way']",N/A

Many in their industry were forced and strongarmed to ""name names"" of people with supposed Communism and anti-American behavior (those who might pose a threat to this supposedly democratic nation of ours).  There were numerous eloquent, intelligent and insightful people who were made ""invisible"" under the clause of this regimented attempt to stamp out those who were politically subversive.Howard Prince (Allen) is a meak cashier who poses as a Blacklisted writer (Murphy) secretly passing on his work and acting as ghostwriter in a series of pieces that earn him critical acclaim.  Though, this response proves quite seductive for Prince, who pockets the money to pay off gambling debts, he becomes aware of the great wrong and injustice being done to those targetted as subversives, and Howard feels he must take a stand.  This film is seemingly humorous, at first, but then turns decidedly dark and unflinchingly brutal toward the end.  You have to see this.

But if Zero Mostel's blacklisted comic was truly a tragic figure,  Woody as the ""front"" of the title,  was  jarringly inconsistent.Well, that was then.  I'd say this 1976 film has aged quite well.  In many ways the film fits right in with everything  that  Woody Allen has done in a more ""dramatic"" vein ever since.  THE FRONT was actually one year prior to Allen's own first real artistic triumph,  ANNIE HALL,  which successful ly blended dramatic elements into the sophisticated comedy.  Since that time,  he's consistently mixed comic elements into his dramatic works and,  of course, vice versa.  It's become something of a trademark,  in fact,  and some 36 years after the release of his ""dramatic (acting) debut,""  it make a bit more sense than it did to some viewers in 1976.In fact,  while THE FRONT is not the first film to deal with the McCarthy era or with blacklisting in specific,  it may well be the case that even a quarter of a century after the fact,  wounds were still raw among those who'd survived the blacklist and they may have had trouble relating to the film's comic elements--or perhaps even its relative smallness of scale.  THE FRONT is not the sweeping statement that some may have hoped for.  I'm sure some expected a scathing indictment of the times and of the paranoia and downright exploitative villainy so many exhibited during the era.  You get some of that,  of course.  You also get a touching reminder of the human cost it all entailed in Zero Mostel's remarkable performance as the doomed comedian.But the reluctant heroism that the smalltime hustler  Woody Allen embodies is also quite touching too.  Is it predictable that this opportunist whose willingness to ""front"" for blacklisted writers has brought him considerable fame and fortune would have a change of heart and tell HUAC what they could do with their line of inquiry.  Of course,  but it's a delicious moment all the same.1976 was a pretty good year for movies:  TAXI DRIVER, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN,  NETWORK,  MARATHON MAN, ROCKY (which seemed pretty fresh and new at the time),  Hitchcock's swan song FAMILY PLOT.

792044,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00013D580,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","The McCarthy-inspired Blacklist in the late 40s and 50s is such a shameful incident in America's history that film and TV has largely steered clear of the subject altogether: you can count the films dealing with it directly on the fingers of one hand, so it sounds like damning with faint praise to say that the rarely revived The Front is the best of them all. That it's the `Woody Allen film' that time forgot hasn't helped it's reputation, but in truth, although many regular Allen collaborators from co-star Michael Murphy to producers Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe are involved, this isn't an Allen film: some of the wisecracks may be tailor-made for him, but this is Martin Ritt and Walter Bernstein's film and Allen's just playing a role, that of a cashier and small-time bookie who finds himself `fronting' for blacklisted writers for 10% of whatever they get for their scripts.Kicking off with a superb scene-setting montage of the 50s at its best and worst, from baseball and apple pie to the Korean War and the execution of the Rosenbergs while Frank Sinatra sings Young at Heart on the soundtrack, it's a film that certainly speaks from personal experience. Along with writer Walter Bernstein and director Martin Ritt (who had both touched upon the blacklist more obliquely in 1970's The Molly Maguires) many of the cast - Zero Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, Lloyd Gough, Joshua Shelley - were blacklisted, while the daughter of one of the blacklist's most tragic victims, John Garfield, also appears. Yet surprisingly it's not a whitewash: the blacklisted writers make it clear that they weren't put on the list by mistake but because they are communists, while Allen's front may start out on his new career as a favor to a friend but quickly shows his true opportunistic colors. No sooner has he seen how much money he can make than he's taking on more writers at higher rates, seducing Andrea Marcovicci's production assistant who is really in love with the words that aren't even his own rather than the man himself and getting ideas above his station, refusing to hand in scripts he thinks aren't up to his standards because ""It's my name that goes on the script."" In that he's really no different from anyone else in a world where club owners take advantage of the blacklist to get performers like Mostel's increasingly suicidal Hecky Green at bargain rates and then still knock them down even further after a sell-out show. But it's not long before he becomes a political suspect himself...Set in the fledgling TV industry where gas company sponsors insisted on rewriting concentration camp dramas to avoid giving their product a bad image and where businessmen who only owned a couple of stores could demand - and get - the right of veto over any cast members they thought are `too red' for their customers' liking by threatening to withdraw a single commercial (both true incidents), it doesn't really need to resort to comic invention, but it's more of an absurd yet dry black comedy that's often too dark NOT to laugh at. The final scene where Allen comes up against the committee and tries to bluff his way out of a contempt charge is really just a piece of wish fulfilment, the kind of thing you wish you had said long after the moment has passed, but it's hard to begrudge Ritt and Bernstein their moment: they earned it. Running a tight hour-and-a-half and with great photography by Michael Chapman, it's well worth investigating.",5,"""Take care of yourself.

I prefer to leave that late development in Woody Allen's life to those closer to the event to make such a character judgment and was interested only in the movie. I confess to realizing I had seen the movie before though the only point at which that startled my memory was the last night for Zero Mostel's character. I remember that. There are several great Woody Allen lines that might be worth keeping in a list. There is certainly the oppression of the ideal as a main focus of the plot. I can easily think of some of Slavoj Zizek's critiques from ""Living in the End Times"" as pertinent. The unlikely hero may have been the topic of our conversation.
