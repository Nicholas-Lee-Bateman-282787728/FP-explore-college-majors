862516,AI1TDAMKLQNIG,B00067BBQO,C. Kuhn,"[3, 5]","This is a bawdy, fun but oddly directed live concert featuring the always enjoyable and creative Pink. The spontaneous and quirky Pink and her amazing voice are overshadowed by bad editing, sloppy sound and a stunning example of censorship in an unrated dvd! There are numerous examples of Pink's showmanship and command of her audience and some incredible vocals, the Janis Joplin tribute is worth the price but should have been longer. The only song that is tough to get through is the goofy version of Lady Marmalade which for some reason involves choppy singing sections and cabaret with blow up dolls. This spectacle takes away from Pink's singing and becomes an unintended parody. If you can get through the bad editing and sound this is an entertaining ride through a tour in the life of one of pop/rock's great singers.",3,In the Pink,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,827,"['bawdy', 'fun', 'oddly', 'directed', 'live', 'concert', 'featuring', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'creative', 'Pink', 'spontaneous', 'quirky', 'Pink', 'amazing', 'voice', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'bad', 'editing', 'sloppy', 'sound', 'stunning', 'example', 'censorship', 'unrated', 'dvd', 'are', 'numerous', 'examples', 'Pink', 'showmanship', 'command', 'audience', 'incredible', 'vocals', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'tribute', 'price', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'only', 'song', 'tough', 'get', 'goofy', 'version', 'Lady', 'Marmalade', 'reason', 'choppy', 'singing', 'sections', 'cabaret', 'blow', 'up', 'dolls', 'spectacle', 'away', 'Pink', 'singing', 'unintended', 'parody', 'can', 'get', 'bad', 'editing', 'sound', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'tour', 'life', 'one', 'pop/rock', 'great', 'singers']",Pink: Live in Europe

After 2 minutes I was done! We are there to see the artist. Focus guys....I want to get the feel of the stage and the atmosphere of the entire concert. Do these film guys have that much of an attention problem. I mean there could be a great solo, singing, guitar etc...and there is the camera focusing on a member of the audience or something else but the solo and what is actually going on. It is so annoying!

She does give her current best but for some reason i was expecting something more. what exactly?? i don't know but i was hoping for something bigger i guess and more cohesive as i felt her little interludes such as G'NR's welcome to the jungle and twisted sister's i wanna rock discredited the order of the songs. I mean why not sing Trouble all the way instead of doing it as some acapella interlude and just leave it at that??? And the same goes for Feel good time with the exception that it wasn't an acapella interlude.But u know what, despite its few flaws this is highly recommended especially for the hardcore Pink fans!Some of the brilliant moments are when she gets a little triple XXX with the oh my god track originally recorded with Peaches. That I would assume you would find on the uncensored version of the concert.So like i said before, this is Pink live and it's promising!Oh and what exactly did she say when she was messing with that christina aguilera-like rubber doll on stage??
