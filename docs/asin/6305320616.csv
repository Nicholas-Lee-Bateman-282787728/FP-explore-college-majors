It has really been more about acts that have been about looks and the way that they dance like Ciara, Ashanti, and Usher to name a few. Nevertheless, it is very sad that there really isn't as much diversity. It sometimes makes me feel more interested in classic music from soul greats like Stevie Wonder. Although there have been many records that sound distincitive from him, many people in this generation really who are more into Kelly Clarkson, really don't know how diverse and universal his classic gems really are on the radio, and how much they continue to influence so many great singers. This documentary shows how much one of his most gifted records was ever showcased to the public.Classic Albums: Stevie Wonder - Songs In The Key Of Life, is a well-conjured 1997 documentary, which was recently televised on the VH1 Classic channel that reflects what made this Motown classic into a worldwide smash record, and how diverse the songs were all thought of. The documentary highlights Stevie, Motown founder Berry Gordy, and all the musicians who were a part of this landmark 1976 record, including keyboardist Herbie Hancock. The documentary also includes Stevie and company re-recording classic tracks including I Wish, Isn't She Lovely, Past-time Paradise and how it was later sampled by Coolio for his #1 smash Gangsta's Paradise. The show was remastered very well, and brings out a real feeling of classic Soul music. The feeling is great and the music is just as lively as it was released years ago.All in all, Classic Albums, the documentary series from BBC has made a great number of documentaries reflecting some of the best music in the industry, and reflecting on Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key Of Life is absolutely no acception. I definitely recommend this documentary for any Stevie Wonder fan or any Motown fan, or for those who really have missed a great era of classic music. I loved watching this documentary on VH1 Classic, and if you haven't seen it yet, you really don't know what great records like this one are made of, otherwise it is just a past-time mistake.DVD Cover: BExtras: BPrice: B 1/2+Remastering: B+Overall: B 1/2+",4,Isn't It Lovely,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,2248,"['past', 'several', 'years', 'definitely', 'have', ""n't"", 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'feeling', 'classic', 'R', 'B', 'music', 'really', 'been', 'more', 'acts', 'have', 'been', 'looks', 'way', 'dance', 'Ciara', 'Ashanti', 'Usher', 'name', 'few', 'Nevertheless', 'very', 'sad', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'diversity', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'more', 'interested', 'classic', 'music', 'soul', 'greats', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'records', 'sound', 'distincitive', 'many', 'people', 'generation', 'really', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'diverse', 'universal', 'classic', 'gems', 'really', 'are', 'radio', 'how', 'much', 'continue', 'influence', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'singers', 'documentary', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'records', 'was', 'ever', 'showcased', 'public.Classic', 'Albums', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Songs', 'Key', 'Life', 'well-conjured', '1997', 'documentary', 'was', 'recently', 'televised', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'channel', 'what', 'made', 'Motown', 'classic', 'worldwide', 'smash', 'record', 'how', 'diverse', 'songs', 'were', 'thought', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'Stevie', 'Motown', 'founder', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'musicians', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'landmark', '1976', 'record', 'including', 'keyboardist', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'documentary', 'also', 'Stevie', 'company', 're-recording', 'classic', 'tracks', 'including', 'Wish', ""n't"", 'Lovely', 'Past-time', 'Paradise', 'how', 'was', 'later', 'sampled', 'Coolio', '1', 'smash', 'Gangsta', 'Paradise', 'show', 'was', 'remastered', 'very', 'well', 'out', 'real', 'feeling', 'classic', 'Soul', 'music', 'feeling', 'great', 'music', 'just', 'as', 'lively', 'was', 'released', 'years', 'ago.All', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'documentary', 'series', 'BBC', 'made', 'great', 'number', 'documentaries', 'reflecting', 'best', 'music', 'industry', 'reflecting', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Songs', 'Key', 'Life', 'absolutely', 'acception', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'fan', 'Motown', 'fan', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'missed', 'great', 'era', 'classic', 'music', 'loved', 'watching', 'documentary', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'great', 'records', 'one', 'are', 'made', 'otherwise', 'just', 'past-time', 'mistake.DVD', 'Cover', 'BExtras', 'BPrice', '1/2+Remastering', 'B+Overall', '1/2+']",N/A
