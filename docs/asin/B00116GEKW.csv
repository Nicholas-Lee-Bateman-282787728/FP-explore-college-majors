A pretty fast paced animated comedy w/what some call super heroes/villains , but I would call super tools.  Everyone is out for themselves and is self-absorbed.  Ultimately their actions never serve themselves, but do serve to amuse the viewers.  The one liners and character embarrassment come at you quickly.  It's not for everyone, but neither is the mainstream pablum that passes for entertainment.

I couldn't more highly recommend this, at least for those resilient enough to endure the vulgarity.Couple minor factoids for all you FD enthusiasts out there:When Killface gets run over by his friend Barnaby and then in his delirium sings out Barnaby's name, he does it to the theme of ""The Courtship of Eddy's Father,"" a television series maybe starring Bill Bixby or somebody in the early 70s.When Ta'Quil grabs the core of the Annihilatrix and makes his heroic dive, the sound effect was borrowed from ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""There are some concealed elements of literature here, and a surprising depth of character and plot, at least at times.  Didn't realize until this evening that when Barnaby gets soap in his eyes in the shower -- I just thought it was the lamest joke in the whole show -- turns out it was primitive foreshadowing for when, well you know.  And (spoiler) when Kenneth spots the big pants first and wins the gold doubloon, that of course is straight out of Moby Dick.This series is AWESOME, even if it's a little scattered sometimes.  Like I had no problem whatsoever with Stan's cloning himself, but if I were to ever show it to my girlfriend I'm afraid she would need some explanation for that, just because it kinda came from out of nowhere.  And lots of other little stuff, almost as if the process of scripting and writing this series was done partially on the fly, and little incidental ""artifacts"" got left in the story without any connection to anything else.  It's inconsequential really, but you notice them if you watch a zillion times like I have.And as for the vulgar humor, for example exactly what's a teabag?  If you watch this with your girlfriend and she doesn't know what a teabag is, maybe you should steer clear of this one and go watch a more girlfriend-friendly movie.  Which is one of the reasons I don't show this, one of my favorite comedy vids, to my GF.  The lewd, juvenile male-oriented humor.I really would like to form a Wendell Stamps fan club.And I would really love to see a movie based on this series.

Although not having any maintained the mystique, and I'm okay with that.I loved ""Sealab 2021,"" but in ""Frisky Dingo,"" Adam Reed and Matt Thompson have brought their brilliant dialogue, randomly absurd and surreal situations, bizarre mix of the extraordinary and the mundane, and repeat viewer rewards to new heights.  Killface is an archvillain trying to destroy the world . . . on a really, really tight budget.  He's also a single father struggling to connect with his incomprehensible (in so many ways) teenage son.  Xander Crews, a billionaire jackass with no redeeming features except for his face, has an alter-ego, superhero Awesome-X.  Crews is now obsessed with finding a new archvillain . . . to provide the model for the nemesis of the Awesome-X action figure.  And his henchmen are singlemindedly focused on . . .  the changes to their health plan.  Why did I not label any of this with ""SPOILER ALERT""?  Because by telling you the story arc for this season, I have told you nothing.  The supporting cast is bizarre, the plot twists are incomprehensible, and there is literally nothing about this series that is not hilarious.Okay, for the DVD, I could have used some backstory on the Sinn/Killface situation, and Simon's mother.  I wasn't expecting much because the DVD for Sealab Season 1 had almost no extras, but I guess I kind of thought things would have been stepped up for FD; there is so much that could have been done, like a video for ""Cat Party,"" or, I guess, you know, anything, since there were no extras.  For doing that, the producers of this DVD were really, really, really, really smart.
