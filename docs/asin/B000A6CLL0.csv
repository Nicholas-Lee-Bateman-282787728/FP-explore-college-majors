Burchfield,"[0, 0]","Some critics complained that the season long Xindi story arc was too long, I thought it often had some good bits to it.I thought the production values were good and many of the story line bits were good as well. T'Pol sports a new hairstyle and costumes, Reed actually had a force field,(in one episode), several of the stories were good.#8 Twilight was interesting, set 12 years in the future Enterprise had failed in it's mission when Archer was disabled and T'Pol took over but due to a just in time cure developed by Phlox Archer is cured (both in the future and in the ""present"") and save the day.#9 North Star was about a colony of 19th century humans captured and taken to the quadrant as slaves. When Enterprise arrived they'd long since revolted and in turn enslaved their captors. The story was fun, one of the better ones of the season, but it had some plot holes big enough to fly Enterprse through. The original human population couldn't have been very large but somehow they've expanded to 5,000 or so in 300 years and maintained a civilization like their ancestors had (realistically they couldn't have enough genetic variety to remain healthy and wouldn't have had all the skills needed to keep up their society. The Skagaarans would've been even worse off).#11 Carpenter Street Daniels sends Archer and T'Pol back to Detroit in 2004 to stop some Reptilian Xindi from producing a doomsday bioweapon. I liked this episode as well as any.#14 Stratagem involved Enterprise somehow capturing Xindi Leader Degra and while he's unconscious constructing a ship set on board Enterprise. He woke up in the set and was supposed to be fooled into thinking that he and Archer were escaped prisoners, the idea being that he'd be tricked into revealing the location of the weapon. Not a very likely plot.#16 Doctor's orders was interesting, the crew couldn't safely cross some region of space so Phlox had to put them all to sleep and fly the ship himself, several surprises in that episode.The last few episodes all work pretty well with most of the Xindi races becoming allies with Enterprise, lots of action towards the last and a surprising twist finale leading up to the fourth and final season.I don't remember the extras all that well now but the Day in the life of a director with Roxann Dawson was actually better than the second season one with Levar Burton. She directed at least one episode, #6 Exile, and took the camera all around the set on a tour, seemed very friendly and told a lot of details.",4,Maybe not the best of the series but still lots of good stuff here,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2513,"['critics', 'complained', 'season', 'long', 'Xindi', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'thought', 'often', 'had', 'good', 'bits', 'it.I', 'thought', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'good', 'many', 'story', 'line', 'bits', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'well', ""T'Pol"", 'sports', 'new', 'hairstyle', 'costumes', 'Reed', 'actually', 'had', 'force', 'field', 'one', 'episode', 'several', 'stories', 'were', 'good.', '8', 'Twilight', 'was', 'interesting', 'set', '12', 'years', 'future', 'Enterprise', 'had', 'failed', 'mission', 'when', 'Archer', 'was', 'disabled', ""T'Pol"", 'took', 'over', 'due', 'just', 'time', 'cure', 'developed', 'Phlox', 'Archer', 'cured', 'future', 'present', 'save', 'day.', '9', 'North', 'Star', 'was', 'colony', '19th', 'century', 'humans', 'captured', 'taken', 'quadrant', 'slaves', 'When', 'Enterprise', 'arrived', ""'d"", 'long', 'revolted', 'turn', 'enslaved', 'captors', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'season', 'had', 'plot', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'fly', 'Enterprse', 'original', 'human', 'population', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'very', 'large', 'somehow', ""'ve"", 'expanded', '5,000', 'so', '300', 'years', 'maintained', 'civilization', 'ancestors', 'had', 'realistically', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'genetic', 'variety', 'remain', 'healthy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'skills', 'needed', 'keep', 'up', 'society', 'Skagaarans', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'even', 'worse', 'off', '11', 'Carpenter', 'Street', 'Daniels', 'Archer', ""T'Pol"", 'back', 'Detroit', '2004', 'stop', 'Reptilian', 'Xindi', 'producing', 'doomsday', 'bioweapon', 'liked', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'any.', '14', 'Stratagem', 'involved', 'Enterprise', 'somehow', 'capturing', 'Xindi', 'Leader', 'Degra', 'unconscious', 'constructing', 'ship', 'set', 'board', 'Enterprise', 'woke', 'up', 'set', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'Archer', 'were', 'escaped', 'prisoners', 'idea', 'being', ""'d"", 'be', 'tricked', 'revealing', 'location', 'weapon', 'Not', 'very', 'likely', 'plot.', '16', 'Doctor', 'orders', 'was', 'interesting', 'crew', 'could', ""n't"", 'safely', 'cross', 'region', 'space', 'Phlox', 'had', 'put', 'sleep', 'fly', 'ship', 'several', 'surprises', 'episode.The', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'most', 'Xindi', 'races', 'becoming', 'allies', 'Enterprise', 'lots', 'action', 'last', 'surprising', 'twist', 'finale', 'leading', 'up', 'fourth', 'final', 'season.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'extras', 'well', 'now', 'Day', 'life', 'director', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'Levar', 'Burton', 'directed', 'least', 'one', 'episode', '6', 'Exile', 'took', 'camera', 'set', 'tour', 'seemed', 'very', 'friendly', 'told', 'lot', 'details']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

922228,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000A6CLL0,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[6, 16]","I didn't see the entirety of this season during it's original airing so a lot of it made zero sense to me at the time. But looking back at it now this season of Enterprise is the beginning of what could've been a very strong future for this series.Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Second Seasonended with an episode called 'The Expanse' in which the NX-01's mission is abruptly changed when a race called the Xindi attack Earth unproked,killing millions including Trip's sister. After learning the multi species Xindi are building a weapon to destroy the planet it's on with this season. The subplot about the Xindi gives these episodes a great base on which to build rather then drowning the stories out-overall this stories presented this season are a lot more varied and interesting then the previous season.Everyone here has their own favorite episodes so I will name mine:IMPULSEOn a ship of mutated Vulcan zombies T'Pol is exposed to trilium which causes her to experiece intense emotional reactions-a great sense of drama.EXTINCTIONIn a similar plotline to the TNG episode 'Identity Crisis' Archer,Hoshi and Reed are mutated into alien primates and it's found this is a dead races long lost method of repopulating itself. Some of the ""transformation"" FX sequences are eerily incredible!NORTH STAROne of my favorites of the season-Archer and company go Western style when they discover a colony of 19'th Western-era Americans whose ancestors were kidnapped from Earth by aliens to work as labor. A great,fast paced tale about the prejiduce created by gross revisionist history.SIMILTUDEThis episode is a lot of people's favorite from this season.Trip dies and the only way to save him is an organ transplant from a close Phlox creates from a mimetic lifeform that starts out looking like a ball of tripe. But as the Trip clone realizes who he is he begins to have doubts about his reasons for life.Another one of those great ""tough choice"" episodes.HATCHERYCaptain Archer becomes an ""obsessed mother figure"" to a group of infact insect Xindi after he becomes obsessed with delivering the infants back to their people.One of Scott Bakula's best moments in this role!E2There are suddenly two Enterprise's when an alternate timeline is created where NX-01 is forced into becomming a multi generational vessell.One thing about this season is it's NOT  for the time travel phobic-this season is chock full of episodes involving time travel to the past,future (including the return of Daniels and a cameo from the 26'th century Enterprise J) and every kind of alternate reality you can think of. One interesting plot twist is the awkward interpersonal relationship between the suddenly heavily emotional T'Pol and Trip. Not to mention that,even the episodes featuring the multi species Xindi keep a non-stop progression;this season has none of the dead,boring moments the previous one did. It's really a pity Enterprise never was able to continue beyond the next season because this could have been a new beginning for this series rather then the near end it turned out to be.",5,Talk About A Re Evaluation!!!!,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,3079,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'entirety', 'season', 'original', 'airing', 'so', 'lot', 'made', 'zero', 'sense', 'time', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'season', 'Enterprise', 'beginning', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'strong', 'future', 'series.Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Seasonended', 'episode', 'called', ""'The"", 'Expanse', 'NX-01', 'mission', 'abruptly', 'changed', 'when', 'race', 'called', 'Xindi', 'attack', 'Earth', 'unproked', 'killing', 'millions', 'including', 'Trip', 'sister', 'learning', 'multi', 'species', 'Xindi', 'are', 'building', 'weapon', 'destroy', 'planet', 'season', 'subplot', 'Xindi', 'episodes', 'great', 'base', 'build', 'rather', 'then', 'drowning', 'stories', 'out-overall', 'stories', 'presented', 'season', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'varied', 'interesting', 'then', 'previous', 'season.Everyone', 'here', 'own', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'will', 'name', 'mine', 'ship', 'mutated', 'Vulcan', 'zombies', ""T'Pol"", 'exposed', 'trilium', 'experiece', 'intense', 'emotional', 'reactions-a', 'great', 'sense', 'drama.EXTINCTIONIn', 'similar', 'plotline', 'TNG', 'episode', ""'Identity"", 'Crisis', 'Archer', 'Hoshi', 'Reed', 'are', 'mutated', 'alien', 'primates', 'found', 'dead', 'races', 'long', 'lost', 'method', 'repopulating', 'transformation', 'FX', 'sequences', 'are', 'eerily', 'incredible', 'NORTH', 'STAROne', 'favorites', 'season-Archer', 'company', 'go', 'Western', 'style', 'when', 'discover', 'colony', ""19'th"", 'Western-era', 'Americans', 'ancestors', 'were', 'kidnapped', 'Earth', 'aliens', 'work', 'labor', 'great', 'fast', 'paced', 'tale', 'prejiduce', 'created', 'gross', 'revisionist', 'history.SIMILTUDEThis', 'episode', 'lot', 'people', 'favorite', 'season.Trip', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'organ', 'transplant', 'close', 'Phlox', 'mimetic', 'lifeform', 'out', 'looking', 'ball', 'tripe', 'Trip', 'clone', 'realizes', 'who', 'have', 'doubts', 'reasons', 'life.Another', 'one', 'great', 'tough', 'choice', 'episodes.HATCHERYCaptain', 'Archer', 'obsessed', 'mother', 'figure', 'group', 'infact', 'insect', 'Xindi', 'obsessed', 'delivering', 'infants', 'back', 'people.One', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'best', 'moments', 'role', 'are', 'suddenly', 'two', 'Enterprise', 'when', 'alternate', 'timeline', 'created', 'where', 'NX-01', 'forced', 'becomming', 'multi', 'generational', 'vessell.One', 'thing', 'season', 'NOT', 'time', 'travel', 'phobic-this', 'season', 'chock', 'full', 'episodes', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'past', 'future', 'including', 'return', 'Daniels', 'cameo', ""26'th"", 'century', 'Enterprise', 'J', 'kind', 'alternate', 'reality', 'can', 'think', 'One', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twist', 'awkward', 'interpersonal', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'heavily', 'emotional', ""T'Pol"", 'Trip', 'Not', 'mention', 'even', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'multi', 'species', 'Xindi', 'keep', 'non-stop', 'progression', 'season', 'none', 'dead', 'boring', 'moments', 'previous', 'one', 'did', 'really', 'pity', 'Enterprise', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'continue', 'next', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'beginning', 'series', 'rather', 'then', 'near', 'end', 'turned', 'out', 'be']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season
922229,A1KBT3D1O0LA7L,B000A6CLL0,A. White,"[0, 0]","Enterprise is like the red-headed stepchild of the Star Trek family. There's even a notable amount of die-hard fans who refuse to admit that it's part of Trek at all. I had no interest in this series while it was on the air, and only started watching it after seeing, and thoroughly enjoying, a rerun from the forth season I beleive. Now I have watched every episode in the series and while it certainly had its share of bombs I have come to enjoy the show much more than I did Voyager.Enterprise is a consistantly well-written show with characters you actually get to know and care about; unlike Voyager which rarely had any of those traits during its seven seasons versus four with Enterprise. Season Three involves the Xindi arc, lasting the entire season, which IMO was an interesting idea that I feel pays off story-wise. While there were a few epsiodes not directly related to the overall plot with the Xindi that were downright terrible, the rest of the season makes up for them nicely. In regards to individual eps, I thought season 4 was better, but S3 was also quite good and had some of the best eps of the series.If you're a fan of ST and have yet to involve yourself in Enterprise, as well as having the intention of doing so of course, I would say that even though it isn't necessary to understanding S3, start from the beginning. On the other hand, if you've already been initiated into the series S3 is great due to the fact it follows only one primary plotline, much like the Dominion War on DS9 but with far less side-plots.",4,Decent Internal Continuity,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,1542,"['Enterprise', 'red-headed', 'stepchild', 'Star', 'Trek', 'family', 'even', 'notable', 'amount', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'who', 'refuse', 'admit', 'part', 'Trek', 'had', 'interest', 'series', 'was', 'air', 'only', 'started', 'watching', 'seeing', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'rerun', 'forth', 'season', 'beleive', 'Now', 'have', 'watched', 'episode', 'series', 'certainly', 'had', 'share', 'bombs', 'have', 'come', 'enjoy', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'Voyager.Enterprise', 'consistantly', 'well-written', 'show', 'characters', 'actually', 'get', 'know', 'care', 'Voyager', 'rarely', 'had', 'traits', 'seven', 'seasons', 'four', 'Enterprise', 'Season', 'Three', 'Xindi', 'arc', 'lasting', 'entire', 'season', 'IMO', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'feel', 'pays', 'story-wise', 'were', 'few', 'epsiodes', 'not', 'directly', 'related', 'overall', 'plot', 'Xindi', 'were', 'downright', 'terrible', 'rest', 'season', 'up', 'nicely', 'regards', 'individual', 'eps', 'thought', 'season', '4', 'was', 'better', 'S3', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'had', 'best', 'eps', 'series.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'ST', 'have', 'yet', 'involve', 'Enterprise', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'intention', 'doing', 'so', 'course', 'would', 'say', 'even', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'understanding', 'S3', 'start', 'beginning', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'initiated', 'series', 'S3', 'great', 'due', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'primary', 'plotline', 'much', 'Dominion', 'War', 'DS9', 'far', 'less', 'side-plots']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

Is in my estimation the crowning achievment of the entire Star Trek Franchise. There are elements within the tale that draw from other episodes but thier impact on the story as a whole is minimal.I won't encapsulate the season, it's been done. I will elucidate and provide a few observations on individual aspects of the season.First I want to discuss the Xindi, a more realistic group of antagonists will be very difficult to find. They are well concieved, interesting and entirely believable. You'll find yourself liking most of them and understanding thier motives, however disagreeable they may be.Second is the Enterprise crew, specifically Archer. How do people react to stress, the loss of loved ones, the weight of an entire planet resting on your shoulders. These are the questions answered by the actions of the crew of Enterprise, and it is all handled brilliantly from the writing to the acting. You can feel and empathize with every emotion that the crew experiences. The amazing part is you can do the same with most of the Xindi you meet along the way.Third is Enterprise, I never thought I would feel so much affection for an imaginary ship other than the original NCC-1701. It reminds me of how I felt about the boats that I served aboard. I watched Voyager and the ""Year in Hell"" but the ship was a collection of pretty sets and nifty special effects. The original ship was a trusted companion, a guardian and a home. The NX-01 is all of these things and more and in season three her endurance is stretched to the limit, she is battered, beaten and injured along the way.Finally, the ride. This season is an entire story arc and it is fantastic. I mentioned Babylon 5 in my previous review and I'll bring it up again here. Because, although B5 didn't invent the serial style of story, with a grand arc that spanned more than a couple of episodes, it did revolutionaize bring it to Sci-Fi with it. Enterprise distilled that into a single season, and you feel yourself racing along with it. As if your on a roller coaster, racing from one weightless drop to the next, grinding your teeth through the loops and catching your breath, for that brief instant in between. If you have ever watched 24 you have an inkling of what it's like, electrifying, intense, unnerving and inspiring all at the same time. And they have carried this effect over into the fourth season although on a smaller scale.If you only want to try one season of Enterprise make it this one, it will not disappoint and besides, if you watch this one you'll want to see them all.",5,A Season Long Thrill Ride,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,2844,"['wrote', 'review', 'Enterprise', 'Season', 'One', 'intended', 'cover', 'entire', 'four', 'season', 'collection', 'show', 'felt', 'addendum', 'Season', 'Three', 'required.This', 'Season', 'alone', 'support', 'other', 'seasons', 'other', 'series', 'matter', 'estimation', 'crowning', 'achievment', 'entire', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Franchise', 'are', 'elements', 'tale', 'draw', 'other', 'episodes', 'thier', 'impact', 'story', 'whole', 'minimal.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'encapsulate', 'season', 'been', 'done', 'will', 'elucidate', 'provide', 'few', 'observations', 'individual', 'aspects', 'season.First', 'want', 'discuss', 'Xindi', 'more', 'realistic', 'group', 'antagonists', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'find', 'are', 'well', 'concieved', 'interesting', 'entirely', 'believable', ""'ll"", 'find', 'liking', 'most', 'understanding', 'thier', 'motives', 'however', 'disagreeable', 'may', 'be.Second', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'specifically', 'Archer', 'How', 'do', 'people', 'react', 'stress', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'weight', 'entire', 'planet', 'resting', 'shoulders', 'are', 'questions', 'answered', 'actions', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'handled', 'brilliantly', 'writing', 'acting', 'can', 'feel', 'empathize', 'emotion', 'crew', 'experiences', 'amazing', 'part', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'most', 'Xindi', 'meet', 'way.Third', 'Enterprise', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'affection', 'imaginary', 'ship', 'other', 'original', 'NCC-1701', 'how', 'felt', 'boats', 'served', 'aboard', 'watched', 'Voyager', 'Year', 'Hell', 'ship', 'was', 'collection', 'pretty', 'sets', 'nifty', 'special', 'effects', 'original', 'ship', 'was', 'trusted', 'companion', 'guardian', 'home', 'NX-01', 'things', 'more', 'season', 'three', 'endurance', 'stretched', 'limit', 'battered', 'beaten', 'injured', 'way.Finally', 'ride', 'season', 'entire', 'story', 'arc', 'fantastic', 'mentioned', 'Babylon', '5', 'previous', 'review', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'up', 'again', 'here', 'B5', 'did', ""n't"", 'invent', 'serial', 'style', 'story', 'grand', 'arc', 'spanned', 'more', 'couple', 'episodes', 'did', 'revolutionaize', 'bring', 'Sci-Fi', 'Enterprise', 'distilled', 'single', 'season', 'feel', 'racing', 'along', 'roller', 'coaster', 'racing', 'one', 'weightless', 'drop', 'next', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'loops', 'catching', 'breath', 'brief', 'instant', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', '24', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', 'electrifying', 'intense', 'unnerving', 'inspiring', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'carried', 'effect', 'fourth', 'season', 'smaller', 'scale.If', 'only', 'want', 'try', 'one', 'season', 'Enterprise', 'make', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'besides', 'watch', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

The away team including T'Pol finds the Vulcans in a disturbed, violent state and wholly incapable of reason.  The away team ventures deep into the Vulcan ship only to be overrun and cut off from their shuttle beyond reach of the transporter.  What can they do to help the crew?  What can they do to elude the deranged Vulcans in the meantime and prevent T'Pol from degenerating too?  T'Pol's character is not just pushed to the limit, it's warped and strung up.

Finding out that there were 5 species of Xindi floored me, but I was amazed by the CGI work for the Xindi-Insectoids and Xindi-Aquatics, as well as the makeup design for the Reptilians and Arboreals, though the Primates weren't too different from us. But then, aren't humans a higher form of primate?Enterprise also went in a slightly new direction by introducing the MACOs, as well as T'Pol resigning her commission with the Vulcan High Command, and getting a new look.The first first few episodes of the season were a little slow at times for my taste, but then the action picked up and the third season experienced a type of action-adventure not seen since Deep Space Nine's Dominion War, culminating in a 3-episode battle to the season's finale, which opened up another amazing storyline into the 4th season, which was unfortunately, the last.I'm not going to provide a summary of each episode, as other reviewers have done this already.However, it saddens me to note that Star Trek has ended (aside from the fan-mader series), due to a lack of interest. It disheartens me to think that people have come to like those garbage reality shows like 'Survivor' and 'Real Gilligan's Island', not to mention all of the even trashier titles in that genre.  What has happened to us that we are superhypercritical of every episode of a show, when we used to be able to just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and get swept away in the story, and ENJOY it?Send a message to Hollywood.

922238,A21VGNU5959O85,B000A6CLL0,CaterpillarGirl,"[10, 12]","Enterprise Season Three has been touted as one long episode, and I have to agree, but I liked it just the same. Yes there weren't 20 something  episodes about different planets, exploring space, meeting and greeting resident and hostile alien species. This was one season, full of one basic storyline, saving earth from the xindi weapon. Crossing into the expanse was as if the crew was crossing into ""junior"" year of space school, no more fun and games its time to get serious and think about the future. We get to see the crew of the enterprise grow both internally and closer to eachother, especially Tripp and T'pol. The Resident science officer , to me, had the most story lines revolved around her next to the captain of course. T'pol was exploring her own emotions, relationships, job and love life throughout , talk about character growth! My favorite episodes, although all of them were amazing, were:Impulse-I love me some zombies, and I loved me some Vulcan zombies even more! Trillium infected vulcans are downright frightening, and even worse was T'pol getting infected by it, although I loved seeing her flip out.Exile- This was the most ""Buffy-like"" episode of star trek I have ever seen for some reason. Maybe it was the demon like telepath who got a hankering for Hoshi to become his consort till death, or maybe it was the whole crystal thing he used to magnify his powers, I still liked it though.Twilight- Captain archer gets a spacial parasite thingee in his brain and his short term memory doesn't work, so we see the future where earth is gone and the xindi are hunting down leftover humans, and more importantly we see how loyal and loving T'pol really is towards Archer. I cried my eyes out in this one.NorthStar- I have always always always hated ""Trek Westerns"" where on star trek they find some alien planet that has some random western motif going on, its always cheesy with its pink skyline and tumbleweeds. BUT this episode cured that hatred, it actually made sense! Aliens kidnapped humans for slaves, brought them to a planet, and the humans revolted, but never evolved technically or socially. Archer looked darn fine in that hat.Similitude- Tripp gets hurt, and Phlox makes a clone of him called ""sim"" to transplant brain matter to tripp and save his life, Archer makes the decision to go ahead with the clone, and realizes that its not so easy to create a life that is sentient and than later have to kill it to save another life. We get to see, via ""sims"" memories from tripp, that he likes T'pol in a romantic way, and she is so sweet to give him that kiss, I seriously cried again.Proving Ground- I am in love with the Andorians, Commander Shran is freaking brilliant, adorable, and one of the best aliens ever on star trek. He is both enemy and friend, and this is the episode that shows that dichotomy I love the ""we have come here to get some....archerite from this planet""Doctors Orders- God, I love Phlox and a whole entire episode devoted to him? Heaven. The crew is in a stasis state and he must take care of them while they travel 4 days, he starts to hallucinate, get paranoid, and eventually has to save enterprise by himself!There are too many to list, too many good ones.

I should love everything Star Trek, but I do not.  I love some things more than others.  As a sci-fi fan, what I enjoy the most is a coherent story arc.  Star Trek, as a grand space opera, allows for that arc--but so often individual writers and stories interfere with that arc.  DS9 provides a very coherent arc that carries through much of the series, albeit with a fair amount of skipping forward, especially in the first couple of seasons.  TNG, like Voyager did have the Borg, but again, rewatching them there is a lot of skipping to get to the central arc. That brings us to the third season of Star Trek Enterprise....The story of the Xindi threat to Earth, the Expanse, time traveling, interdimensional beings, along with the gathering of clues and information leading to a final resolution at the end of the season is the finest effort of Star Trek producers to make just about every episode have some element of the canon and arc.  Now, I cannot say everything was ""edge of the seat"", but the last 4 episodes of the season, and the satisfying resolution combined with another cliff hanger makes this season of Enterprise potentially my favorite of all the series.I reserve the right to change this opinion since Amazon Prime is providing me the ability to sift through and rewatch DS9 (and truly there was a lot of satisfying canon within DS9)!Update: 2-5-14  As I have sifted through the central story arc in the 7 seasons of DS9, and move towards the series finale in Season 7, I am thinking that I am about to change my mind.

However, this series was highly recommended to me, so I purchased it. Star Trek is getting better and better. I'm old enough to have seen the original when it came out and remember how ground breaking it was. I loved Next Gen, liked Voyager even better and I think Enterprise may be the best yet. I haven't seen DS9 so can't comment on it. I wish the time travel plot had been extended and I wish the series ending had not been so dark, otherwise no complaints. I can't believe it only ran 4 seasons; there were so many stories that could have been told. It was extremely interesting to see how the writers linked the events in Enterprise w/ the those in the series that came before. I find it extremely frustrating that programs like Firefly, Farscape, Dollhouse and Enterprise are cut short when they obviously have a very large and loyal fan base.

O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[15, 25]","Series star Jolene Blalock  -who identified herself as a lifelong Star Trek fan - has said that the failure of this series was because ""The stories lacked intriguing content. They were boring."" She felt that the early scripts violated facts already established in other franchise shows and complained that the show substituted revealing costumes for character development. ""The audience isn't stupid,""  she protested. For year three, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman decided that they would finally address some of the fan complaints that the series lacked any sort of continuity and launched a season long arc about Earth threatened by a mysterious race called the Xindi -who were, for all intents and purposes, organized much like DS9's Dominion. Through the next 26 episodes (which then would be cut to 24 due to faltering ratings), Archer and his crew would search the galaxy for the Xindi in hopes of preventing them from destroying Earth. While ambitious in a year before the return of serialized drama, the series quickly fell into the same pattern as the previous two seasons: poorly written stories that said nothing, acting that made most soap stars look like Oscar winners, and an almost F You! to fans of TOS, TNG and DS9.  The show was not grabbing people viscerally, as freakier aliens, lapses in logical story telling, and lack of character growth were taking over. No one, including me, felt a need to rush home and see this show, because it was saying nothing. There was a message there, I'm sure, but it was buried under technobabble and increasing desire to hurt women. I'm often remember Trek motion pictures 1,2,3,4 and 6 because the story had revelance to today. Enterprise missed that boat, even though the Xindi arc was a mushy allegory about 9/11. Archer's moral compass was thrown, but ultimatley, he never any long reaching effects. Some will say a good leader has no doubts, but Star Trek tried to show you through the years that long after an unpopular action, the capatin still might feel pangs of regret. But not Jonthan Archer. He was tough as nails guy. Pfft, I say, as he became a tool of a jingonistic Rick Berman. Still, one thing that came from this season was Manny Coto. He tried to return a sense of balance, but because UPN were more concerned with who was watching Trek instead of paying attention to who wasn't, this series was doomed. And while a letter campaign was started to save the show, in the end, it was not that would give this series one more season. UPN was going to cancel the show after season three, and then Paramount -home of the Godfather franchise -made UPN a deal they could not resist. Cutting the $1.5 million fee UPN paid Paramount to air the show to $875,000 made UPN reconsider airing the show. It would return for 22 more shows, but from that moment on, no matter how much Coto improved the show, Enterprise was doomed. The 10.5 millions fans had dwindled down to 2.5. And the logic that escaped the story telling for so many years, pointed out that if no one is watching, why air it?",2,"Enter more predictable, pedantic and bad acting.",1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,3050,"['Series', 'star', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', '-who', 'identified', 'lifelong', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'said', 'failure', 'series', 'was', 'stories', 'lacked', 'intriguing', 'content', 'were', 'boring', 'felt', 'early', 'scripts', 'violated', 'facts', 'already', 'established', 'other', 'franchise', 'shows', 'complained', 'show', 'substituted', 'revealing', 'costumes', 'character', 'development', 'audience', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'protested', 'year', 'three', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'decided', 'would', 'finally', 'address', 'fan', 'complaints', 'series', 'lacked', 'sort', 'continuity', 'launched', 'season', 'long', 'arc', 'Earth', 'threatened', 'mysterious', 'race', 'called', 'Xindi', '-who', 'were', 'intents', 'purposes', 'organized', 'much', 'DS9', 'Dominion', 'next', '26', 'episodes', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'cut', '24', 'due', 'faltering', 'ratings', 'Archer', 'crew', 'would', 'search', 'galaxy', 'Xindi', 'hopes', 'preventing', 'destroying', 'Earth', 'ambitious', 'year', 'return', 'serialized', 'drama', 'series', 'quickly', 'fell', 'same', 'pattern', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'poorly', 'written', 'stories', 'said', 'nothing', 'acting', 'made', 'most', 'soap', 'stars', 'look', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'almost', 'F', 'fans', 'TOS', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'grabbing', 'people', 'viscerally', 'freakier', 'aliens', 'lapses', 'logical', 'story', 'telling', 'lack', 'character', 'growth', 'were', 'taking', 'over', 'one', 'including', 'felt', 'need', 'rush', 'home', 'see', 'show', 'was', 'saying', 'nothing', 'was', 'message', 'there', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'buried', 'technobabble', 'increasing', 'desire', 'hurt', 'women', ""'m"", 'often', 'remember', 'Trek', 'motion', '1,2,3,4', '6', 'story', 'had', 'revelance', 'today', 'Enterprise', 'missed', 'boat', 'even', 'Xindi', 'arc', 'was', 'mushy', 'allegory', '9/11', 'Archer', 'moral', 'compass', 'was', 'thrown', 'ultimatley', 'never', 'long', 'reaching', 'effects', 'will', 'say', 'good', 'leader', 'doubts', 'Star', 'Trek', 'tried', 'show', 'years', 'long', 'unpopular', 'action', 'capatin', 'still', 'might', 'feel', 'pangs', 'regret', 'not', 'Jonthan', 'Archer', 'was', 'tough', 'nails', 'guy', 'Pfft', 'say', 'became', 'tool', 'jingonistic', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Still', 'one', 'thing', 'came', 'season', 'was', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'tried', 'return', 'sense', 'balance', 'UPN', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'who', 'was', 'watching', 'Trek', 'instead', 'paying', 'attention', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'series', 'was', 'doomed', 'letter', 'campaign', 'was', 'started', 'save', 'show', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'would', 'give', 'series', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'UPN', 'was', 'going', 'cancel', 'show', 'season', 'three', 'then', 'Paramount', '-home', 'Godfather', 'franchise', '-made', 'UPN', 'deal', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'Cutting', '1.5', 'million', 'fee', 'UPN', 'paid', 'Paramount', 'air', 'show', '875,000', 'made', 'UPN', 'reconsider', 'airing', 'show', 'would', 'return', '22', 'more', 'shows', 'moment', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Coto', 'improved', 'show', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'doomed', '10.5', 'millions', 'fans', 'had', 'dwindled', 'down', '2.5', 'logic', 'escaped', 'story', 'telling', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'pointed', 'out', 'one', 'watching', 'why', 'air']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

All that changed with the last episode of season 2, launching season 3 into a crusade like story that would begin a DEEP SPACE NINE: Dominion war style story.Cue season 3 of enterprise, and in my opinion the best thing to happen to sci-fi in recent times, the story of the Xindi, and their war of extermination on planet earth engulfed the entire 24 episodes of the thirds season, while the presence of the xindi objective is milder in some episodes, and critical in others, the pacing of interlinking all the eps, to tell a major story worked so well for me that I found myself stuck to the tv, and working my schedule around every week to wath the next episodes. In the days of television series that don't like to risk doing anything else apart from one stand alone episodes, season 3 of enterprise homages the pacing of SCI-FI legend BABYLON 5, and in doing so, tells a much more thorough and epic story, a SAGA if you willI was first in line to buy this dvd set, the great extras go a long way too, but I cant wait to sit and watch all the episodes again, as back to back as possible.

922260,A3L2U581LL17EB,B000A6CLL0,Eric,"[2, 6]","Whatever reservations I may have had about this show were quickly dissipated with season 3, which gave us one of the best long-running sci-fi story arcs I've seen and almost easily the best in Star Trek history (edging out DS9's Final Chapter).  Probably season 3's greatest attribute is its relative consistency.  Sure, not every episode was great, but each had something to add to the lengthy plot, and it usually entertained in the process.  The end result was an ambitious season highlighted by enjoyable storytelling, excellent f/x, and plenty of tension and intrigue.The Xindi- B.  A good start to the Xindi arc, with interesting conflicts aboard the ship and a damn good action sequence at the end of the episode.Anomaly- B.  This episode further highlights the dangers of the Delphic Expanse in a convincing and entertaining fashion.Extinction- B-.  Okay, I know this one's universally despised, but I was pretty amused by it through and through.Rajiin- B-.  I was hoping to see more between the ultra-hot Hoshii and Rajiin, but the scene just cut away!  Otherwise, it's a enjoyable enough episode.Impulse- A-.  Zombie Vulcans!  Though it doesn't particularly further the Xindi arc, this is still an exciting, action-packed episode.Exile- B-.The Shipment- B.  Adds an extra dimension to the already intriguing Xindi race.Twilight- A.  Possibly the season's best episode, even if it does seem a bit inspired by TNG's Yesterday's Enterprise and 50 First Dates.  Still, it represents everything I love about Star Trek.North Star- B.  Another unpopular episode, this time saved by a really cool shootout/fight scene at the end.Similitude- C-.  Despite the moral complications, I found this a pretty dull Tucker episode.Carpenter Street- C+.  Watchable, but it doesn't really succeed as a time travel piece or as an action episode either.Chosen Realm- C+.  Pretty much a filler episode, though I did like the final scene.Proving Ground- B.  Nice to see Shran again, especially in an episode that delivers its share of thrills and intriguing plot turns.Stratagem- B+.  It's a lot of fun watching Archer and the crew try to manipulate Degra.Harbinger- B.  A solid episode that furthers the story arc while also giving us an enjoyable fight scene between Reed and Major Hayes.Doctor's Orders- B-.  The season's Dr. Phlox episode, and while I think it could have been even creepier, it still does a nice job building a sense of isolation.Hatchery- B-.Azati Prime- B.  Another good episode, though I would have liked a bit more expansion on that future Daniels was showing to Archer.The Damange- B+.  Archer goes to some extreme lengths to continue his mission.  It's breaking these ehtical boundaries that make this a very compelling episode.The Forgotten- B.  A decent episode as Archer tries to convince the Xindi they're being manipulated.E squared- B-.  The premise is intriguing and most of the episode does entertain, but it doesn't end on the most satisfying note.The Council- B+.  The pace reaches a feverish height as we approach the end of the arc.  There's plenty of dramatic conflict and a cool space battle towards the end.Countdown- A.  Wow.  As a pure thrill ride, Countdown is one of the best Star Trek episodes ever, highlighted particularly by an awesome space battle worthy of the big screen.  Toss in some exciting phaser fights and the death of a major character and we've got one of my favorite Trek episodes, period.Zero Hour- B.  After the frantic thrills of Countdown, things actually slow down a bit for the first half of Zero Hour, hurting the momentum somewhat.

I have to say that Enterprise Season Three is the best out of the three seasons released so far.It really has matured into Star Trek. There is action mixed with thoughtful plots. There is a revenge story the entire season and the pain of the crew's loss can be felt on almost every episode.The entire storyline is based on the tragic event of 9/11. Earth is minding it's own business and is attacked, killing seven million people on Earth. The storyline is so close to what happened in real life, you'll be on edge hoping Earth gets revenge for the slaughter of seven million innocent people.The Xindi themselves are an interesting new species of aliens that have never before been seen, but arguably have been mentioned in Trek before ENT. They make the Suliban seem weak.Overall, Enterprise Season 3 is the season to get if you are a fan of Trek or ENT alone, even non-fans would enjoy this. I've been a fan of Trek for years and I have to say that Season 3 is a must own even for those who didn't like the previous two seasons.

While the focus is basically on the 'Xindi Arc', overall the Xindi theme is well executed from start to finish with few flaws.  It is by far the darkest part of the series (much as the Dominion War arc was the darkest part in DS9) but the hardship and life and death situations the crew face lead to the most interesting exploration of the psyches of the main characters, their sometimes dubious actions and choices (such as Archer's torture of an alien to find out more about the Xindi and stealing a warp coil from a neutral ship after the Enterprise is attacked and crippled) in the face of extreme situations.Other interesting aspects of the series are neglected, such as the development of the relationships between the various Star Trek races, though these are explored in some detail in the Fourth Season.I think the end of this series was spoiled somewhat by the 'Nazi' Arc (overall this addition to the Xindi Arc to conclude the Temporal Cold War wasn't well written or executed, or that convincing) but generally, it was very well done and acted.",5,The best season of enterprise,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,1115,"['Overall', 'view', 'best', 'season', 'Enterprise', 'focus', 'basically', ""'Xindi"", 'Arc', 'overall', 'Xindi', 'theme', 'well', 'executed', 'start', 'finish', 'few', 'flaws', 'far', 'darkest', 'part', 'series', 'much', 'Dominion', 'War', 'arc', 'was', 'darkest', 'part', 'DS9', 'hardship', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'crew', 'face', 'lead', 'most', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'psyches', 'main', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'dubious', 'actions', 'choices', 'such', 'Archer', 'torture', 'alien', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Xindi', 'stealing', 'warp', 'coil', 'neutral', 'ship', 'Enterprise', 'attacked', 'crippled', 'face', 'extreme', 'situations.Other', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'series', 'are', 'neglected', 'such', 'development', 'relationships', 'various', 'Star', 'Trek', 'races', 'are', 'explored', 'detail', 'Fourth', 'Season.I', 'think', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'spoiled', 'somewhat', ""'Nazi"", 'Arc', 'overall', 'addition', 'Xindi', 'Arc', 'conclude', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'written', 'executed', 'convincing', 'generally', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'acted']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season
922266,A2YIK3X5ECV7A,B000A6CLL0,Greg Kline,"[4, 7]","I stumbled upon the original Star Trek series as a kid in it's initial run in 1966. The episode was ""Devil In The Dark"". A story about silicon based beings, and learning to appreciate and cohabitate with them. I've since seen every episode of every Star Trek incarnation, most of them multiple times. The point is, I have some credentials.What made Star Trek soar, was that it was a show of IDEAS. And it was pretty much the first sci-fi space show where the aliens didn't come out blasting, in a bid to exterminate humanity for whatever fear-based goofy reason. People who were tired of the old warn out themes of good guys vrs bad guys, now had a place to turn. Gene Roddenberry was a thoughtful visionary, who humbly loved the fans, and genuinely believed in Star Trek, and the better angels of humanities hopes and dreams that it represented. He was hands on through every episode of the original Star Trek, and Next Generation. And he brought in a variety of top notch writers with great ideas.When Gene became ill, Rick Berman took over. Gene never liked Rick due to his arrogange, and incredible disdain for the fans. Rick never shared in Gene's vision, and treated the audience as simpletons and sheep, churning out half-hearted off-handed scripts. After Gene died, Rick became increasingly disrespectful of the Trek tenets.With Enterprise, Star Trek became yet another two-dimensional comic book good guys vrs bad guys show. Nowhere was this more evident, than with the Xindi saga. Ideas took a back seat. Further, imagination was undercut with the whole premise of Enterprise. With space exploration, people want to explore the frontiers, not go way back in time to the beginning. Who wrote Enterprise? Rick Berman, and his right hand yes-man Brannon Braga. Only at the end, with the shows ratings sinking like a stone, did they bring in some talent. Too little, too late.I love Star Trek, but putting bias aside, and taking off the rose colored glasses, Enterprise was a bad show that sullied the great Star Trek name, and for the most part, you can pin that squarely on Rick Berman. I thank the lord he had nothing to do with the new Star Trek movie. Memorable quote. Rick and Gene are walking across the Paramount lot, and Rick says pompously waving his hand ""See all these people, they all work for ME"". And Gene replied ""Funny, they all worked WITH me"".May a new series return, at the farthest edges of the future, with ideas not yet explored.",2,RICK BERMAN KILLS STAR TREK,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,2458,"['stumbled', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'kid', 'initial', 'run', '1966', 'episode', 'was', 'Devil', 'Dark', 'story', 'silicon', 'based', 'beings', 'learning', 'appreciate', 'cohabitate', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'incarnation', 'most', 'multiple', 'times', 'point', 'have', 'credentials.What', 'made', 'Star', 'Trek', 'soar', 'was', 'was', 'show', 'IDEAS', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'first', 'sci-fi', 'space', 'show', 'where', 'aliens', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'blasting', 'bid', 'exterminate', 'humanity', 'fear-based', 'goofy', 'reason', 'People', 'who', 'were', 'tired', 'old', 'warn', 'themes', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'now', 'had', 'place', 'turn', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'visionary', 'who', 'humbly', 'loved', 'fans', 'genuinely', 'believed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'better', 'angels', 'humanities', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'represented', 'was', 'hands', 'episode', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'brought', 'variety', 'top', 'notch', 'writers', 'great', 'ideas.When', 'Gene', 'became', 'ill', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'took', 'over', 'Gene', 'never', 'liked', 'Rick', 'due', 'arrogange', 'incredible', 'disdain', 'fans', 'Rick', 'never', 'shared', 'Gene', 'vision', 'treated', 'audience', 'simpletons', 'sheep', 'churning', 'out', 'half-hearted', 'off-handed', 'scripts', 'Gene', 'died', 'Rick', 'became', 'increasingly', 'disrespectful', 'Trek', 'tenets.With', 'Enterprise', 'Star', 'Trek', 'became', 'yet', 'two-dimensional', 'comic', 'book', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'Nowhere', 'was', 'more', 'evident', 'Xindi', 'saga', 'Ideas', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'Further', 'imagination', 'was', 'undercut', 'whole', 'premise', 'Enterprise', 'space', 'exploration', 'people', 'want', 'explore', 'frontiers', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'time', 'beginning', 'Who', 'wrote', 'Enterprise', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'right', 'hand', 'yes-man', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'Only', 'end', 'shows', 'ratings', 'sinking', 'stone', 'did', 'bring', 'talent', 'Too', 'little', 'too', 'late.I', 'love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'putting', 'bias', 'aside', 'taking', 'off', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'bad', 'show', 'sullied', 'great', 'Star', 'Trek', 'name', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'pin', 'squarely', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'thank', 'lord', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'new', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'Memorable', 'quote', 'Rick', 'Gene', 'are', 'walking', 'Paramount', 'lot', 'Rick', 'pompously', 'waving', 'hand', 'See', 'people', 'work', 'ME', 'Gene', 'replied', 'Funny', 'worked', 'WITH', 'new', 'series', 'return', 'farthest', 'edges', 'future', 'ideas', 'not', 'yet', 'explored']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

Up until that point only 'Deep Space Nine' had been able to pull off - and quite successfully, I think, proving they could have done it long before - multi-episode arcs.  Even 'DS9's' arcs had never encompassed an entire season, so the crew of 'ENT' really took a chance.  It's easy as a fan to sit back and look at the decisions that were made and say &#34;oh the series may have last longer if they had done this or that, or maybe if they had started doing story arcs in the first or second season...&#34;  No one can really say for sure.  I enjoyed most of the first two seasons, with the exception of a few notable episodes.The Xindi storyline was bold.  Having five distinct species on the same planet all develop intelligence simultaneously provided the writers with a lot of different material to work with.  A year-long mission to save Earth and humanity from extinction, forcing the characters into pressure-cooker situations ... really gave the show the raw edge I think it was supposed to have from the very beginning.  We were able to experience the darker facets of the characters' emotions as they pretty much unraveled.  Many folks did not like the inclusion of the Temporal Cold War (at all) into the Xindi Arc.  Personally I loved the Temporal Cold War story, and it made perfect sense in this season.  Considering the NX-01 hadn't traveled very far it had to be explained how and why this crew could counter enter the Delphic Expanse, yet have the expanse not exist in the 24th century.  It explained the existence of the Suliban, the Sphere Builders, why the Expanse no longer existed in the time of TNG, DS9, and VOY.Like the previous Blu-ray Trek releases, this season contains the Season Three DVD special features.  It also contains four newly-produced documentaries.  Three parts are sectioned off into a doc called &#34;In A Time Of War,&#34; which features the actors, the writing staff, some members of the production staff, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman all discussing the creation, implementation, and consequence of the direction Season Three took.  I always enjoy these documentaries, whether on the ENT or TNG sets (and I look forward to them on the future DS9 and VOY sets), because I enjoy hearing the points-of-view of everyone involved in the creation process.  The recollections are always fascinating.  The final documentary is called &#34;Temporal Cold War Declassified.&#34;  This doc explores the concepts behind the temporal cold war storyline, possible reasons it wasn't as well received as it could have/should have been, and like the other docs features interviews with cast and creators.As always the remastering quality of these sets is fantastic; Season Three of 'Enterprise' is no exception.",5,Another Exceptional Release,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2852,"['Season', 'Three', 'saw', ""'Enterprise"", 'depart', 'single-story', 'format', 'show', 'had', 'used', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'point', 'only', ""'Deep"", 'Space', 'Nine', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'quite', 'successfully', 'think', 'proving', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'long', 'multi-episode', 'arcs', 'Even', 'arcs', 'had', 'never', 'encompassed', 'entire', 'season', 'crew', ""'ENT"", 'really', 'took', 'chance', 'easy', 'fan', 'sit', 'back', 'look', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'say', '34', 'oh', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'last', 'longer', 'had', 'done', 'maybe', 'had', 'started', 'doing', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'second', 'season', '34', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'sure', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'exception', 'few', 'notable', 'episodes.The', 'Xindi', 'storyline', 'was', 'bold', 'Having', 'five', 'distinct', 'species', 'same', 'planet', 'develop', 'intelligence', 'simultaneously', 'provided', 'writers', 'lot', 'different', 'material', 'work', 'year-long', 'mission', 'save', 'Earth', 'humanity', 'extinction', 'forcing', 'characters', 'pressure-cooker', 'situations', 'really', 'gave', 'show', 'raw', 'edge', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'very', 'beginning', 'were', 'able', 'experience', 'darker', 'facets', 'characters', 'emotions', 'pretty', 'much', 'unraveled', 'Many', 'folks', 'did', 'not', 'inclusion', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'Xindi', 'Arc', 'Personally', 'loved', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'story', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'season', 'Considering', 'NX-01', 'had', ""n't"", 'traveled', 'very', 'far', 'had', 'be', 'explained', 'how', 'why', 'crew', 'could', 'counter', 'enter', 'Delphic', 'Expanse', 'yet', 'have', 'expanse', 'not', 'exist', '24th', 'century', 'explained', 'existence', 'Suliban', 'Sphere', 'Builders', 'why', 'Expanse', 'no', 'longer', 'existed', 'time', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'previous', 'Blu-ray', 'Trek', 'season', 'Season', 'Three', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'also', 'four', 'newly-produced', 'documentaries', 'Three', 'parts', 'are', 'sectioned', 'off', 'doc', 'called', '34', 'Time', 'War', '34', 'actors', 'writing', 'staff', 'members', 'production', 'staff', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'discussing', 'creation', 'implementation', 'consequence', 'direction', 'Season', 'Three', 'took', 'always', 'enjoy', 'documentaries', 'ENT', 'TNG', 'sets', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'DS9', 'VOY', 'sets', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'points-of-view', 'everyone', 'involved', 'creation', 'process', 'recollections', 'are', 'always', 'fascinating', 'final', 'documentary', 'called', '34', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'Declassified.', '34', 'doc', 'concepts', 'temporal', 'cold', 'war', 'storyline', 'possible', 'reasons', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'received', 'could', 'have/should', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'docs', 'features', 'interviews', 'cast', 'creators.As', 'always', 'remastering', 'quality', 'sets', 'fantastic', 'Season', 'Three', ""'Enterprise"", 'exception']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

922278,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000A6CLL0,John Kwok,"[3, 5]","Without question, this is the darkest, bleakest season in this short-lived ""Star Trek"" series, but also the best. Unlike a previous reviewer, I believe that it was also the best season simply because of the captivating ""Xindi"" arc. This made for compelling, suspenseful drama as the crew of the Enterprise searched deep into the uncharted Delphic Expanse for the mysterious Xindi, hoping to stop the Xindi from destroying Earth. Much to Manny Coto's credit, most of the finest scripts and acting from the cast were from this season.I was especially impressed with superb performances from Connor Trineer as Commander Charles ""Trip"" Tucker, Jolene Blalock as T'Pol, and Scott Bakula as Captain Jonathan Archer. But I was surprised with superb acting from Dominic Keating as his Lieutenant Reed goes head to head with Mayor Hayes, the commander of the MACOs, portrayed superbly by Steven Culp. John Billingsley's Phlox was another elegant portrayal. However, the most mesmerizing performance - and one worthy of an Emmy nomination - was by Randy Oglesby as the primate Xindi leader Degra; a genuinely conflicted individual torn between his desire to save his people and to save humanity from a senseless, unnecessary extinction by the Xindi weapon he's been building. Jeffrey Combs returns all too briefly as the Andorian Shraan, who lends assistance to Archer and the Enterprise crew at a pivotal moment in the ""Xindi"" saga.Could ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" been as fine a television series as its legendary precursors ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and especially, ""Star Trek; Deep Space Nine""? Alas we'll never know. However, this CD collection does give a tantalizing hint of what might have been had both Paramount Pictures and the UPN television network allowed this series to survive for at least another year or two.",5,"Best Season of ""Star Trek: Enterprise""",1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,1820,"['question', 'darkest', 'bleakest', 'season', 'short-lived', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'also', 'best', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'believe', 'was', 'also', 'best', 'season', 'simply', 'captivating', 'Xindi', 'arc', 'made', 'compelling', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'searched', 'deep', 'uncharted', 'Delphic', 'Expanse', 'mysterious', 'Xindi', 'hoping', 'stop', 'Xindi', 'destroying', 'Earth', 'Much', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'credit', 'most', 'finest', 'scripts', 'acting', 'cast', 'were', 'season.I', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'superb', 'performances', 'Connor', 'Trineer', 'Commander', 'Charles', 'Trip', 'Tucker', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', ""T'Pol"", 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Captain', 'Jonathan', 'Archer', 'was', 'surprised', 'superb', 'acting', 'Dominic', 'Keating', 'Lieutenant', 'Reed', 'head', 'head', 'Mayor', 'Hayes', 'commander', 'MACOs', 'portrayed', 'superbly', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'Phlox', 'was', 'elegant', 'portrayal', 'However', 'most', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'one', 'worthy', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'was', 'Randy', 'Oglesby', 'primate', 'Xindi', 'leader', 'Degra', 'genuinely', 'conflicted', 'individual', 'torn', 'desire', 'save', 'people', 'save', 'humanity', 'senseless', 'unnecessary', 'extinction', 'Xindi', 'been', 'building', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'too', 'briefly', 'Andorian', 'Shraan', 'who', 'assistance', 'Archer', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'Xindi', 'saga.Could', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'been', 'fine', 'television', 'series', 'legendary', 'precursors', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'especially', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Alas', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'However', 'CD', 'collection', 'give', 'tantalizing', 'hint', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'UPN', 'television', 'network', 'allowed', 'series', 'survive', 'least', 'year', 'two']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

922291,ACY27M578XP2R,B000A6CLL0,"Mark C. Aron ""quality dvd & book man""","[7, 12]","i have read what many have written about the death of ""enterprise"" however i think they miss the mark, but by just a little. what doomed ""enterprise"" was not the acting, or directing, or writing of any one episode. in fact i think one can make the valid point that the overall acting and directing, and the writting of many episodes in all 4 seasons was as good as anything in the trek canon.what undermined the show fron the beginning was the ""bible""on which the show was based. i do not mean that a show that covered the beginning of the federation was a bad idea, just that the way it was done was totally screwed up fron the beginning. the basic idea the relationship between vulcans andhumans is more like that between overbaring parents and teenagers who thing they are allready adults. according the the ""bible"" the vulcans have spent the 88 years from ""first contact"" to the building of the nx-01 impeadind whenever possible, the ability of humans to get beyond the sol system.humans have been denied such things as warp technology, information on the verious political relationships beyond the sol system ( such as relations between vulcan & andor, the very fact that there is a klingon empire - let alone it's size and power, ect, ect, ect...)and even such simple things as a up to date star chart, as well as being limited to what other races humans do come into contact with. because of this commercially operated space freighters have more experience, and their pilots have more flying time than mid 22nd century starfleet.because of all of this the first 2 seasons of ""enterprise""bumbled, fumbled, and stumbled around the galaxy trying to explore without knowing the rules, while at the same time trying to avoid screwing up so badly as to warrent being called home and proving the vulcan high command correct. and having a first officer throught to have been placed on board to spy on the crew grew boring after a while. in addition the temoral cold war sub plot was never understandable, because you never did learn who was fighting who and why.by the time season two was coming down to its last few episodes, the show had crashed and burned, 75% of the viewership was gone (forever as it turned out) and the network, upn had switched the demographics, it wanted to go after ( let's face it, the type of viewer who would tune in week after week to find out at the end of the season which contestent will end up with the chance to be the next trya banks, most likely does not watch good drama on t.v., let alone good scifi, let alone star trek ) but after realizing their screw up, rick berman & co. decided the the ""bible"" was a failure and that if the show was going to be saved, some changed needed right away.season three was that change, and by the end of the season the show was finally on track, but running out of time. the idea of a season long story arc was a gamble, which in my opinion worked quite well. the only error in the story arc that i see was the maintaining the temoral cold war sub plot. this season laid the basis for season 4, which forfilled all thehopes of the loyal viewers.as for the future, i fear that the release of ""enterprise""will be the last new trek we will on either the small or big screen for a long time. paramount, as part of viacom, is going through some major changes at this time. and by the time things settle out, the new management may buy into the ""conventional wisdom"" that star trek has shot it's wad, that the star trek fan base are nothing but a bunch of over the hill nerds and geeks, and the path laid down by gene roddenberry is as out of date as the hayes code, god/gods/the phophets/the great bird of the galaxy help us

922292,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000A6CLL0,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[25, 52]","Many will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but I hope you at least read why.Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action ""Star Trek"" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original ""Star Trek"" series of 1966-1969), 200 years before the time of Captain Picard (during the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" of 1987-1994) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film ""Star Trek: First Contact"".The new series, entitled ""Enterprise"", debuted in the fall of 2001, months after the previous ""Star Trek"" series, ""Voyager"", concluded its seven-year run.  As the show's title implies, the ship used in the show was named ""Enterprise"" and had serial number NX-01 with a maximum speed of warp 5.  It's crew was comprised of Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"" of 1989-1993), Vulcan science officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), pilot Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), ship's communications officer Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), the Denobulan Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), weapon's officer Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) and ship's engineer Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the first season's premiere episode, it looked like UPN would have another successful ""Star Trek"" series, just as it had with ""Voyager"".  Unfortunately, subsequent shows had ever-shrinking audiences.  The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  UPN nearly cancelled the show after the third season, but decided instead to give it one more chance with a fourth season.  Unfortunately, with only an average of about 3.1 million viewers per fourth-season episode, UPN did finally cancel the series in 2005 even though there were still another three seasons yet to be produced.Why, then, did ""Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  I include several possible overall reasons:  mostly uninteresting characters (except for Dr. Phlox and T'Pol), lack of connection with the other ""Star Trek"" TV series (except the fourth season), the introduction of species (the Suliban and Xindi) that had never previously been known in ""Star Trek"" and all-too-often mediocre writing (except the fourth season).  The third season, though popular with some people, I found to be the most problematic of all:1. The entire third season was a single story arc about Captain Archer trying to find out who the Xindi are, then, once finding them, figuring out how to stop them from using an even more powerful weapon to completely destroy Earth after they used a smaller weapon at the end of the second season to kill 3,000,000 Earth residents.  This should have been done in no more than 4 episodes, not 24.2. If you have watched George Lucas' original 1977 ""Star Wars"" film, you'll quickly realize that the Xindi's ultimate planet-killing weapon was nothing new: it was simply a copy (somewhat smaller) of George Lucas' spherical ""Death Star"" from 27 years earlier.3. During the third season, it is revealed that the Xindi are carrying out the wishes of an advanced species from 500 years in the future to build the ""Death Star"" copy to destroy Earth in the past rather than being at war with Earth in their present. This sounds awfully familiar with the plot of ""Star Trek: First Contact"", in which the Borg travel to Earth's past so that it will be assimilated in the present.  Who were two of the principle writers of ""First Contact""?  Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who was also one of the producers of the film.  In other words, the Xindi story arc that occupied the entire third season was a rehashing of the plot from ""First Contact"" (which was less than 2 hours), as well as a poor copy of part of George Lucas' work from ""Star Wars"".Given that the five live-action ""Star Trek"" TV series represent 28 years of TV broadcasts, I regard the third season of ""Enterprise"" to be the least entertaining of them all since it was completely wasted on the Xindi story arc.  The wonderful work of reconnecting ""Enterprise"" to the previous ""Star Trek shows"" that Manny Coto managed to do during the fourth season of ""Enterprise"" could have been done during the third season had the Xindi story arc not been done at all or limited to 4 episodes.  What I and many other ""Star Trek"" fans had expected would occur during ""Enterprise"" was the Earth-Romulan War as eluded to in the original ""Star Trek"" TV series, as well as the formation of the United Federation of Planets (UFP); not a war with a never previously known species.  Unfortunately, the premature cancellation of the show, which I blame in large part to the poorly conceived Xindi story arc, prevented the Earth-Romulan War from being portrayed, and the actual events that lead to the formation of the UFP could only touched on in the fourth season.Consequently, I rate the third season of ""Enterprise"" with 1 out of 5 stars.  Of the 24 third-season episodes, the only one that is particularly memorable is ""Doctor's Orders"", in which Dr. Phlox remains the only crew member awake during a crossing of a treacherous region of space. (This, too, was a rehash of ""Voyager"" episode ""One"".) Sadly, it wouldn't be until the fourth season of ""Enterprise"" that the show truly blossomed under the guidance of Manny Coto, but it came too little too late to save it from cancellation.",1,"An

It is apparent however that the writers are quite smitten with T'pal and it is surprising in how many imaginative ways they can get her out of her clothes. Not that I mind that so much, but I feel it is needlessly done as I don't recall that many TOS episodes with Spock undressed. Moreover, I feel it takes away from her fine acting which is the most impressive of all the actors. Why take away from her acting by so much sensuality of her body. No doubt they could have just made a show with her rubbing lotion on her body for a full hour and called it Star Trek/Baywatch. I like her looks too, but come on. That aside, it is becoming a well written show with touches of qualities that lead to a lasting appeal. I find I am more and more addicted to the show and what is going to happen to them all.

Seasons 1 and 2 went fairly well, whereas, halfway through season 3, I discovered my own breaking point and had to take a 6 week sabatical from battling the Xindi...In short, I found the cliche that ultimatly cost Enterprise its 5th season. Oh, I loved the T'Pol-Trip romance, which is one of the more interestuing ones in the series(es) being wrought out of almost complete emnity. And, frankly, loved even more the twist Archer took as he started to do ""what is nessicary"" for the survival of Enterprise and Earth in a story arc remincesant of ""In The Pale Moonlight"" from DS9's 6th Season. But there were problems. I never did much get exactly where the Xindi came from, even if it does have soemthing to do with the Temproal Cold War, no more than I ever got the Suliban plotlines.In essence, a vaild addition to the Enterprise story, perhaps better than the first two seasons in that it has a darker and grittier feel then even the first - ie, a more resonant, modern feel than the idealic episodes of TOS or the 1-story-resolutions of TNG - that deeply asks the questions of ""What is right?"" ""What is nessicary?"" and ""What is good?"" for all charectors, most especially T'Pol and Archer, ending in a clasic cliffhanger...

922300,A1R96CRCV76XR0,B000A6CLL0,Oliver Hardy Jr.,"[0, 0]","Finally!  Season three of Enterprise is actually something resembling a good show, unlike the pathetic seasons before.  This season has a great share of action.  More shootouts and ship-to-ship fighting.  Captain Archer has changed from his pukey, preachy former self into a fierce captain willing to do anything to protect earth.The story is great.  Starship Enterprise must enter the expanse, a very unstable region of space, to find and destroy the Xindi weapon.  There are some subplots (a few good, a few bad,) but the story focuses on the search for the weapon.

Season 3 has a running, cohesive theme through the whole season, and continues the solid cast performance and strong plot lines of season 2. There's even more action, and we start to see a few more esoteric episodes such as one that takes place in Detroit of 2004 (the year the episode was filmed).Enterprise is approachable for non-trekkies, but Trekkies will love it.  Strong acting, interesting plots, nice graphics (for the time), and a lot of precedent-setting stuff happening before the Federation existed.  Unlike Voyager (the prior series), there's a lot less &#34;how could they be that stupid??&#34; moments.  All those times you watched Voyager and were annoyed by all the stuff they didn't do-- when they didn't fight back, when they talked slowly instead of firing, when they were defeated by virtually everything they encountered and were usually saved by accident or by outside forces rather than their own efforts and skills?  This show doesn't do that.  You think &#34;Captain Archer should punch that guy in the face!&#34; and lo and behold, Captain Archer does punch that guy in the face!  The lack of bumbling makes this series feel much more real, and much more watchable.I briefly watched &#34;Enterprise&#34; when it first aired, but broadcast was a terrible way to watch shows like this.

922302,A30CCEGTGTPM51,B000A6CLL0,"Orion ""orionca""","[4, 9]","Braga and Berman wrecked the series in Season 1 by introducing the ""temporial war"" and rewriting the history of Star Trek essentially because they could.  They wrote ridiculously PC stories and dumbed down the characters to the point they were little more than wooden robots coached from offscreen.  They had this fascination with caves that bordered on the unreal (look up the filksong ""Caves of the Heart"").  They freely stole stories from other ST series and made hashes of them.Having said that, Season Three bordered on the passable.  If they had STARTED with this season, Enterprise would still be in production and most likely a hit today.  It did nothing but improve as the season went along and provided a few moments of gripping action with some fresh ideas thrown in along the way.  Much of this was because B&B; brought on Manny Coto who had a much better feel for the show than them and could actually write his way out of a paper sack when the Muse was with him.  But by then it was too late:  Too many ""hard core"" ST fans had been lost and there was no great attraction to draw in new fans and the show sputtered and died.If they ever decide to ""reimagine"" Enterprise let me make a few suggestions:- No time travel.  It's been so badly overused in the ST franchise that if any plot device deserves retirement, it's this.- Follow WC Fields' advice:  ""Never work with dogs or kids.""  Porthos was cute exactly once and added nothing to the story.  If you have to have an animal aboard ship make it a cat or a monkey:  they can act.- NO VULCANS.  There is no ""law"" of Star Trek that every ship MUST have a Vulcan Science Officer.  Joleen Blalock looks just as good in a skin-suit WITHOUT the pointy ears as with them.  T'Pol added nothing to the series except the constant reminder that Humans are ignorant savages with no social skills and no understanding of Galactic Society.  This is a story about mankind reaching out to the universe; they don't need a schoolmarm along to scold them for being uncouth.- For that matter, don't name the ship (or series) ""Enterprise"".  As startling as this sounds, this invites direct comparisons to the other ships and casts in the Star Trek franchise and this is terribly divisive to the audience.  The best of the ""modern"" ST series was DS-9 and the USS Enterprise barely showed up there at all.  You don't need a ""5-year mission"", either.  JUST A GOOD STORY.  Heck, they could have hitched a ride on an Andorian freighter to the Expanse and used a shuttle to get around once there:  The NX-01 was almost useless and a constant distraction.  If they have a ship give it a lower profile: make it a plot device to get from point A to point B and don't make such a big deal over it being ""the first Warp 5 capable starship"".  NO ONE CARES.  It will never be as good as the NCC-1701, A, B, C, D, or E versions because it's from 100 years in the past.",3,"Too little, too late.",1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,2897,"['Braga', 'Berman', 'wrecked', 'series', 'Season', '1', 'introducing', 'temporial', 'war', 'rewriting', 'history', 'Star', 'Trek', 'essentially', 'could', 'wrote', 'ridiculously', 'PC', 'stories', 'dumbed', 'characters', 'point', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'wooden', 'robots', 'coached', 'offscreen', 'had', 'fascination', 'caves', 'bordered', 'unreal', 'look', 'up', 'filksong', 'Caves', 'Heart', 'freely', 'stole', 'stories', 'other', 'ST', 'series', 'made', 'hashes', 'them.Having', 'said', 'Season', 'Three', 'bordered', 'passable', 'had', 'STARTED', 'season', 'Enterprise', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'production', 'most', 'likely', 'hit', 'today', 'did', 'nothing', 'improve', 'season', 'went', 'along', 'provided', 'few', 'moments', 'gripping', 'action', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'thrown', 'way', 'Much', 'was', 'B', 'B', 'brought', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'who', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'feel', 'show', 'could', 'actually', 'write', 'way', 'paper', 'sack', 'when', 'Muse', 'was', 'then', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'Too', 'many', 'hard', 'core', 'ST', 'fans', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'was', 'great', 'attraction', 'draw', 'new', 'fans', 'show', 'sputtered', 'died.If', 'ever', 'decide', 'reimagine', 'Enterprise', 'let', 'make', 'few', 'suggestions', 'time', 'travel', 'been', 'so', 'badly', 'overused', 'ST', 'franchise', 'plot', 'device', 'retirement', 'this.-', 'Follow', 'WC', 'Fields', 'advice', 'Never', 'work', 'dogs', 'kids', 'Porthos', 'was', 'cute', 'exactly', 'once', 'added', 'nothing', 'story', 'have', 'have', 'animal', 'aboard', 'ship', 'make', 'cat', 'monkey', 'can', 'act.-', 'VULCANS', 'law', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ship', 'MUST', 'have', 'Vulcan', 'Science', 'Officer', 'Joleen', 'Blalock', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'skin-suit', 'pointy', ""T'Pol"", 'added', 'nothing', 'series', 'constant', 'reminder', 'Humans', 'are', 'ignorant', 'savages', 'social', 'skills', 'understanding', 'Galactic', 'Society', 'story', 'mankind', 'reaching', 'out', 'universe', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'schoolmarm', 'scold', 'being', 'uncouth.-', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'name', 'ship', 'series', 'Enterprise', 'startling', 'direct', 'comparisons', 'other', 'ships', 'casts', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'terribly', 'divisive', 'audience', 'best', 'modern', 'ST', 'series', 'was', 'DS-9', 'USS', 'Enterprise', 'barely', 'showed', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', '5-year', 'mission', 'JUST', 'GOOD', 'STORY', 'Heck', 'could', 'have', 'hitched', 'ride', 'Andorian', 'freighter', 'Expanse', 'used', 'shuttle', 'get', 'around', 'once', 'NX-01', 'was', 'almost', 'useless', 'constant', 'distraction', 'have', 'ship', 'give', 'lower', 'profile', 'make', 'plot', 'device', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'being', 'first', 'Warp', '5', 'capable', 'starship', 'ONE', 'CARES', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'NCC-1701', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'versions', '100', 'years', 'past']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

The video quality is fine, sound is rich, and the extras are good, but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series, like Freaks and Geeks, without the high price. (Through a series of fortunate events, I got my copy at a discount.)I don't consider myself a big Star Trek fan. Most of the shows set in the Trek universe work so hard to be ""Star Trek"" that much of the life is gone from them. My immediate attraction to Enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows-- for example, ""comic relief"" is blissfully absent here. The goofy humor of Star Trek: The Next Generation never appealed to me. Fox Mulder's dry wise cracking on The X Files? Funny stuff! Commander Data trying to be Sherlock Holmes? Not so much.Season 2 of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories. (Wow, there are aliens trying to destroy the Enterprise with a time bomb! Oh, it was only a dream.) Threatened with TV extinction, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman (who wrote many of season 2's episodes themselves) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging Trek formula. All kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored, characters gained dimension, and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in  Enterprise's 22nd.In season 3 we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera (wowie zowie phasers, stunts, and great production design) and the ideas of real speculative fiction (cloning, dimensional shifts, and temporal manipulation). Ruminations on loneliness, loss, and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama. (Curiously, religion is absent.) At the same time, Archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of ER so compelling.

Much superior to the previous seasons and a great storyline that extended through the season.  The Xindi are an alien species intent on destroying Earth; in fact, all humanity.  Archer and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to stop the Xindi from building a planet buster weapon that they will use to destroy Earth.  (Planet destroying weapons seem all the rage these days... since the Death Star introduced them in you-know-what)  To accomplish their assignment, the crew of the Enterprise must cross the Delphic Expanse, a sector replete with spatial and time anomalies that plague the Enterprise and it appears the ship may not even reach the planetary systems of the Xindi.  To further complicate matters, it turns out that the anomalies of the Expanse are due to objects, spheres, being constructed by the Sphere Builders, another race of aliens who are not only alien to our civilization but are actually alien to this universe.  There are great Xindi characters introduced and since the Xindi are composed of four separate races, insectoid, reptilian, aquatic and humanoid, there is opportunity for some excellent special effects which are done magnificently.  And there is the Andorian, Shran, whose character is played by Jeffrey Combs, who steals the show in a couple of episodes.

Season 3 contains some of the better elements of the Deep Space 9 arcs and rectifies some problems with Voyager (like the ship never showing damage).  The minor character casting and chemistry problems were less noticeable in Season 3.  The Xindi arc was exciting and original (5 species forming one race) and the effects were exceptional.  The acting was excellent and alive, thanks in no small part to a great supporting cast.  If this had been season 1 of Enterprise, the show would still be on.  You'll be thrilled and amazed with this set.

922312,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B000A6CLL0,Roger J. Buffington,"[3, 4]","Of the four Star Trek seasons, this is far and away the darkest of the four, featuring a 9/11 theme.  Earth suffers a devastating attack from an alien species, and Enterprise is dispatched to eliminate the threat.  In this season we see a darker, more ruthless Captain Archer, who is determined to carry out his mission, occasionally bending, or even breaking, his usual high ethical standards.This season is pretty good, and most of the episodes are excellent entertainment.  The cast continues to develop excepting Hoshi and Mayweather, who for some reason seem to recede in this season.  The MACOs are a valuable addition to the cast, and frankly it now seems odd that a Starship would travel on missions without a group that is skilled at tactical operations on the ground.Unfortunately, it is my theory that this season is perhaps the cause of the Enterprise series' demise.  Most Star Trek episodes stand on their own, and the viewer needs only a minimal familiarity with the series, or even none at all, in order to enjoy a given episode.  Not so Season Three.  This is essentially a miniseries about Enterprise's struggle against the Xindi (the alien race that attacked Earth, and which Enterprise seeks to de-fang).  The various episodes are highly interconnected and require quite a bit of familiarity with the series in order to make sense.  Despite being pretty darned good entertainment, I believe that this inhibited the ability of the series to attract new viewers, or even retain some viewers who for whatever reason could only catch some but not all episodes.  Usually a series like Enterprise hits its stride around Season Three, and perhaps really begins to attract viewers.  That is not what happened here, and I speculate (with minimal data, admittedly) that the complexity of the Season Three theme hurt the ability of the series to attract viewers.The other thing I dislike about Season Three is the heavy time-travel theme.  I believe that the best Star Trek episodes are those that stick with its core theme: what will mankind find when it ventures out among the stars, and what will these discoveries do to and for mankind?  Interstellar travel makes unlmited theme variations possible.  There is no need for time travel, which is improbable of achievement, in contrast with space travel, which is probably humanity's ultimate destiny.It is unfortunate that Enterprise did not stay around longer, because in my opinion Enterprise is far and away the best of the Star Trek series (and I love them all!).  Enterprise really captures the notion of humankind just beginning to explore the nearby regions of the Galaxy, encountering new intelligent species for the first time, including species such as the Andorians and the Vulcans who are more technologically advanced than humans.  Enterprise has a fresh, ""New Frontier"" feeling to it that the best episodes of The Original Series also had. (See ""The Menagerie"" episode if you want an example of this).Nothing in this review is meant to minimize the entertainment value of Season Three.  This is wonderful entertainment from which anyone who likes science fiction and/or Star Trek will derive great enjoyment.  I give it four stars rather than five simply to contrast it with the superb Season Four.  Season Four is the season in which the series really hit its stride, showing the tremendous possibilities Enterprise made possible.",4,"Excellent, excellent season if perhaps not the best of the 4",1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,3406,"['four', 'Star', 'Trek', 'seasons', 'far', 'away', 'darkest', 'four', 'featuring', '9/11', 'theme', 'Earth', 'devastating', 'attack', 'alien', 'species', 'Enterprise', 'dispatched', 'eliminate', 'threat', 'season', 'see', 'darker', 'more', 'ruthless', 'Captain', 'Archer', 'who', 'determined', 'carry', 'out', 'mission', 'occasionally', 'bending', 'even', 'breaking', 'usual', 'high', 'ethical', 'standards.This', 'season', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'cast', 'develop', 'excepting', 'Hoshi', 'Mayweather', 'who', 'reason', 'seem', 'recede', 'season', 'MACOs', 'are', 'valuable', 'addition', 'cast', 'now', 'odd', 'Starship', 'would', 'travel', 'missions', 'group', 'skilled', 'tactical', 'operations', 'ground.Unfortunately', 'theory', 'season', 'perhaps', 'cause', 'Enterprise', 'series', 'demise', 'Most', 'Star', 'Trek', 'stand', 'own', 'viewer', 'only', 'minimal', 'familiarity', 'series', 'even', 'none', 'order', 'enjoy', 'given', 'episode', 'Not', 'so', 'Season', 'Three', 'essentially', 'miniseries', 'Enterprise', 'struggle', 'Xindi', 'alien', 'race', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'Enterprise', 'de-fang', 'various', 'episodes', 'are', 'highly', 'interconnected', 'require', 'quite', 'bit', 'familiarity', 'series', 'order', 'make', 'sense', 'being', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'entertainment', 'believe', 'inhibited', 'ability', 'series', 'attract', 'new', 'viewers', 'even', 'retain', 'viewers', 'who', 'reason', 'could', 'only', 'catch', 'not', 'episodes', 'Usually', 'series', 'Enterprise', 'stride', 'Season', 'Three', 'perhaps', 'really', 'attract', 'viewers', 'not', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'speculate', 'minimal', 'data', 'admittedly', 'complexity', 'Season', 'Three', 'theme', 'hurt', 'ability', 'series', 'attract', 'viewers.The', 'other', 'thing', 'dislike', 'Season', 'Three', 'heavy', 'time-travel', 'theme', 'believe', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episodes', 'are', 'stick', 'core', 'theme', 'what', 'will', 'mankind', 'find', 'when', 'ventures', 'out', 'stars', 'what', 'will', 'discoveries', 'do', 'mankind', 'Interstellar', 'travel', 'unlmited', 'theme', 'variations', 'possible', 'need', 'time', 'travel', 'improbable', 'achievement', 'contrast', 'space', 'travel', 'probably', 'humanity', 'ultimate', 'destiny.It', 'unfortunate', 'Enterprise', 'did', 'not', 'stay', 'around', 'longer', 'opinion', 'Enterprise', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'love', 'Enterprise', 'really', 'notion', 'humankind', 'just', 'beginning', 'explore', 'nearby', 'regions', 'Galaxy', 'encountering', 'new', 'intelligent', 'species', 'first', 'time', 'including', 'species', 'such', 'Andorians', 'Vulcans', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'humans', 'Enterprise', 'fresh', 'New', 'Frontier', 'feeling', 'best', 'episodes', 'Original', 'Series', 'also', 'had', 'See', 'Menagerie', 'episode', 'want', 'example', '.Nothing', 'review', 'meant', 'minimize', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Season', 'Three', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'anyone', 'who', 'science', 'fiction', 'Star', 'Trek', 'will', 'derive', 'great', 'enjoyment', 'give', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'simply', 'contrast', 'superb', 'Season', 'Four', 'Season', 'Four', 'season', 'series', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'showing', 'tremendous', 'possibilities', 'Enterprise', 'made', 'possible']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

This Star Trek series is not like the other Star Trek epics (from Captain Kirk onwards), and does not keep up with the series tradition of soft-core Sci-fi. This series has lots of people dying and lots of blood splattered around!!!! Casualties are high at an unprecedented level for any Star Trek show. And with a deviation from the previous Star trek tradition, lots of sexual suggestions; some indecent episodes, and tacky sexploitation of T'Pol (Jolene Blalock). Definitely not for children! For example, T'Pol taking showers; removing her clothes for bio-scans; massage sessions with Commander Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and her intense sexual urges. I think the producers are searching for a new audience. Even the good guys die! And the Vulcan T'Pol has weaknesses, unlike Spot.Furthermore, each episode follows on the previous episode, sort of like Kiefer Sutherland's 24. This is unique in this series of Star Treks. Usually, each episode of the previous Star Trek sagas was independent of each other. One used to be able to watch any of the previous Star Trek episodes without being lost as to what is going on. With Season 3 of Enterprise, however, you'd have to pretty much start with episode one to really understand what is going on and enjoy the series (again, like 24 or Lost).The whole season revolves around one story: how to stop the Xindi from destroying planet Earth! The Xindi, a race made up of 5 surviving species (Primates, Arboreals, Reptilians, Aquatics and Insectoids), aided by a species from a trans-dimensional space, have attacked Earth and killed seven million people. The attack came from the Delphic Expanse, an unstable region of space where our laws of physics are non-existent. The Enterprise's mission: enter the Expanse, find the Xindi, and prevent them from deploying the weapon that is being designed to destroy Earth. This storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you hunger for more.Finally the producers figured it out (much to Manny Coto's credit)! They are starting to copy series like 24 and Lost!Season 3 is really exciting and action packed; more so than any of the previous series from Kirk onwards. Note though that this intense action and having each episode follow on the previous one, starts only with Season 3. Season 1 and 2 were bland and much like their predecessors.I highly recommend Season 3, and can't wait to watch Season 4.",5,Wow!,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2460,"['Just', 'finished', 'Season', '3', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'wow', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'not', 'other', 'Star', 'Trek', 'epics', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'onwards', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'series', 'tradition', 'soft-core', 'Sci-fi', 'series', 'lots', 'people', 'dying', 'lots', 'blood', 'splattered', 'Casualties', 'are', 'high', 'unprecedented', 'level', 'Star', 'Trek', 'show', 'deviation', 'previous', 'Star', 'trek', 'tradition', 'lots', 'sexual', 'suggestions', 'indecent', 'episodes', 'tacky', 'sexploitation', ""T'Pol"", 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'Definitely', 'not', 'children', 'example', ""T'Pol"", 'taking', 'showers', 'removing', 'clothes', 'bio-scans', 'massage', 'sessions', 'Commander', 'Tucker', 'Connor', 'Trinneer', 'intense', 'sexual', 'urges', 'think', 'producers', 'are', 'searching', 'new', 'audience', 'Even', 'good', 'guys', 'die', 'Vulcan', ""T'Pol"", 'weaknesses', 'Spot.Furthermore', 'episode', 'previous', 'episode', 'sort', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', '24', 'unique', 'series', 'Star', 'Treks', 'Usually', 'episode', 'previous', 'Star', 'Trek', 'sagas', 'was', 'independent', 'other', 'One', 'used', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'previous', 'Star', 'Trek', 'being', 'lost', 'what', 'going', 'Season', '3', 'Enterprise', 'however', ""'d"", 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'start', 'episode', 'one', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'enjoy', 'series', 'again', '24', 'Lost', '.The', 'whole', 'season', 'around', 'one', 'story', 'how', 'stop', 'Xindi', 'destroying', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Xindi', 'race', 'made', '5', 'surviving', 'species', 'Primates', 'Arboreals', 'Reptilians', 'Aquatics', 'Insectoids', 'aided', 'species', 'trans-dimensional', 'space', 'have', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'killed', 'seven', 'million', 'people', 'attack', 'came', 'Delphic', 'Expanse', 'unstable', 'region', 'space', 'where', 'laws', 'physics', 'are', 'non-existent', 'Enterprise', 'mission', 'enter', 'Expanse', 'find', 'Xindi', 'prevent', 'deploying', 'weapon', 'being', 'designed', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'storyline', 'edge', 'seat', 'hunger', 'more.Finally', 'producers', 'figured', 'out', 'much', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'credit', 'are', 'starting', 'copy', 'series', '24', 'Lost', 'Season', '3', 'really', 'exciting', 'action', 'packed', 'more', 'so', 'previous', 'series', 'Kirk', 'onwards', 'Note', 'intense', 'action', 'having', 'episode', 'follow', 'previous', 'one', 'only', 'Season', '3', 'Season', '1', '2', 'were', 'bland', 'much', 'predecessors.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Season', '3', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'Season', '4']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season

But the vast majority of the season is spent on the Xindi and their superweapon. I actually missed several of these episodes when it was originally on air. So it was nice to go back and catch up. Though, it still felt like the Xindi storyline went on too long. I prefer the standalone episodes of the earlier series. But I still enjoy and appreciate this cast and their chemistry.

Bowing to the popularity of the ""Star Wars"" films and the serial format enjoyed by them and soap operas, the crew of the Enterprise faces for much of the season a heretofore unknown alien tribe known as the Xindi and their neon, blinky version of the Death Star.  It's refreshing that aliens are shown in multiple races and species, instead of the standard, slightly altered caucasoids-of-the-week that permeate most American sci-fi, but there's nothing particularly illuminating about them as a race or as an enemy.  Instead, the Xindi function as a TV version of the Trade Federation in the George Lucas vehicles, arguing amongst themselves even as they put into action a diabolical plan to destroy Earth.  (In the fashion of recent sci-fi, the plot device for their motivation is needlessly complicated . . . yet again some contemporary ""Star Trek"" hokum about time travel and the need to destroy Earth before it destroys them.)  Scott Bakula comes awfully close at times to being a living, breathing person, and the romantic subplot between the delectable Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) and the likable Connor Trinneer (Tucker) meanders between being engaging and being junior high kissy-face and note-passing.  While none of the episodes is particularly thoughtful, the music and pacing pick up markedly, to the degree that ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" begins to approximate real television, even if overall it's still an expensive but smudged photocopy of the original ""Star Trek.""",3,Better . . .

922336,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000A6CLL0,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 13]","The third season of ""Enterprise"" had its challenges: the ratings were sagging and the producers were hoping to increase viewership; facing strong critical reaction from fans the series became much more action based with stronger stories that separated it from ""Voyager"" and put it more in the leage of ""Deep Space Nine"" (still the finest ""Trek"" series IMO). If you like ""Enterprise"" this is probably the seasont that truly got you hooked. With the season long story arc of the Xindi, Enterprise went into uncharted territory for the series. The Xindi are a race that have designed a weapon to kill everyone on Earth. They've discovered that humanity will, in the future, destroy their planet so they've elected to strike before that event occurs. Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) and his crew have this information revealed by a time traveler involved in the Temporal Cold War from season one for his own nefarious reasons. By the way there is a podcast for one of the best episodes during the third season ""Twilight"" available at the offical ""Star Trek"" website with writer Michael Sussman and moderator Tom Gaskill. Why this wasn't included on the boxed set, I don't know but it's an excellent podcast. This one unlike the others was designed for the DVD boxed set for the third season.Enterprise goes into the uncharted Delphic Expanse where the laws of physics are sometimes altered by the anomolies encountered in the region and the mysterious metallic spheres located throughout the region. Enterprise is on a desperate mission to discover the Xindi homeworld in hopes of stopping the weapon (which has already been tested on Florida leaving 7 million dead at the end of season two)or convincing the Xindi that Earth is not a threat. Bakula came into his own this season playing a decision battle hardened Archer. The optical effects and sets are impressive as are the different alien species some of which are portrayed via CGI.Although it wasn't a perfect series, ""Enterprise"" offered much hope for the franchise during the third and fourth season (before the disasterous and horrible final episode of season four). As usual the image quality on this series is top notch and Paramount keeps getting better with the extras. I did, however, have to go back and return three separate sets before I got a complete set that wasn't defective which was extremely frustrating.The extras this time around include a discussion as to why producers Braga and Berman brought on Manny Coto (the talented writer/producer/creator of ""Odyssey Five"")as a writer/producer. There's also a discussion as to the reasons for the season long Xindi story arc introduced at the end of season two. There's a very good featurette on directing the show featuring Roxann Dawson, outtakes, deleted scenes, a couple of commentary tracks by Manny Coto and Assistant director Mike De Merritt on shooting the episode ""North Star"". Also we get text commentary on three episodes ""Impulse"", ""Count Down"" and ""Xindi"" by Michael and Denise Okuda. There's also a profile of Connor Trinner aka ""Trip"". Trinner honestly assesses the changes in the character he started to make as the series progressed (for the good). There's also a photo gallery, episode synposis booklet and Easter eggs.While this was a shorter seson (24 vs. 26), the third season was a huge improvement over the first two and made for compelling action driven science fiction. While there were a few missteps (""Doctor's Orders"" which basically was a rewrite of a ""Voyager"" episode) most of the season was very strong with some of the best written episodes seen since ""Deep Space Nine"".Complaints? The price is still way too high although the design for the packaging is unique and nice (that's what you're paying for along with the extensive extras). Also, ""Enterprise"" should have been given another year to see what Coto and Alan Brennart (""The Twilight Zone"") could have done as they did excellent work during season four as well. Now that ""Star Trek"" seems retired (for the moment) it does allow the oppportunity to reinvent the franchise and give it renewed energy. ""Enterprise"" wasn't a wasted journey but a worthwhile one with a top notch cast and writing/direction at the end of the series.",4,"""Enterprise"" comes into its own (Please note this review is for the DVD release not the forthcoming Blu-ray or on demand version",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,4230,"['third', 'season', 'Enterprise', 'had', 'challenges', 'ratings', 'were', 'sagging', 'producers', 'were', 'hoping', 'increase', 'viewership', 'facing', 'strong', 'critical', 'reaction', 'fans', 'series', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'based', 'stronger', 'stories', 'separated', 'Voyager', 'put', 'more', 'leage', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'still', 'finest', 'Trek', 'series', 'IMO', 'like', 'Enterprise', 'probably', 'seasont', 'truly', 'got', 'hooked', 'season', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'Xindi', 'Enterprise', 'went', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'series', 'Xindi', 'are', 'race', 'have', 'designed', 'weapon', 'kill', 'everyone', 'Earth', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'humanity', 'will', 'future', 'destroy', 'planet', ""'ve"", 'elected', 'strike', 'event', 'Captain', 'Archer', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'crew', 'have', 'information', 'revealed', 'time', 'traveler', 'involved', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'season', 'one', 'own', 'nefarious', 'reasons', 'way', 'podcast', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'Twilight', 'available', 'offical', 'Star', 'Trek', 'website', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Sussman', 'moderator', 'Tom', 'Gaskill', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'boxed', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'excellent', 'podcast', 'one', 'others', 'was', 'designed', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'third', 'season.Enterprise', 'uncharted', 'Delphic', 'Expanse', 'where', 'laws', 'physics', 'are', 'sometimes', 'altered', 'anomolies', 'encountered', 'region', 'mysterious', 'metallic', 'spheres', 'located', 'region', 'Enterprise', 'desperate', 'mission', 'discover', 'Xindi', 'homeworld', 'hopes', 'stopping', 'weapon', 'already', 'been', 'tested', 'Florida', 'leaving', '7', 'million', 'dead', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'convincing', 'Xindi', 'Earth', 'not', 'threat', 'Bakula', 'came', 'own', 'season', 'playing', 'decision', 'battle', 'hardened', 'Archer', 'optical', 'effects', 'sets', 'are', 'impressive', 'are', 'different', 'alien', 'species', 'are', 'portrayed', 'CGI.Although', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'series', 'Enterprise', 'offered', 'much', 'hope', 'franchise', 'third', 'fourth', 'season', 'disasterous', 'horrible', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'four', 'usual', 'image', 'quality', 'series', 'top', 'notch', 'Paramount', 'getting', 'better', 'extras', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'return', 'three', 'separate', 'sets', 'got', 'complete', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'defective', 'was', 'extremely', 'frustrating.The', 'extras', 'time', 'around', 'include', 'discussion', 'why', 'producers', 'Braga', 'Berman', 'brought', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'talented', 'writer/producer/creator', 'Odyssey', 'Five', 'writer/producer', 'also', 'discussion', 'reasons', 'season', 'long', 'Xindi', 'story', 'arc', 'introduced', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'featurette', 'directing', 'show', 'featuring', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'couple', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'Assistant', 'director', 'Mike', 'De', 'Merritt', 'shooting', 'episode', 'North', 'Star', 'Also', 'get', 'text', 'commentary', 'three', 'episodes', 'Impulse', 'Count', 'Down', 'Xindi', 'Michael', 'Denise', 'Okuda', 'also', 'profile', 'Connor', 'Trinner', 'Trip', 'Trinner', 'honestly', 'changes', 'character', 'started', 'make', 'series', 'progressed', 'good', 'also', 'photo', 'gallery', 'episode', 'synposis', 'booklet', 'Easter', 'eggs.While', 'was', 'shorter', 'seson', '24', 'vs.', '26', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'huge', 'improvement', 'first', 'two', 'made', 'compelling', 'action', 'driven', 'science', 'fiction', 'were', 'few', 'missteps', 'Doctor', 'Orders', 'basically', 'was', 'rewrite', 'Voyager', 'episode', 'most', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'best', 'written', 'seen', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', '.Complaints', 'price', 'still', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'design', 'packaging', 'unique', 'nice', 'what', ""'re"", 'paying', 'extensive', 'extras', 'Also', 'Enterprise', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'year', 'see', 'what', 'Coto', 'Alan', 'Brennart', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'did', 'excellent', 'work', 'season', 'four', 'as', 'well', 'Now', 'Star', 'Trek', 'retired', 'moment', 'allow', 'oppportunity', 'reinvent', 'franchise', 'give', 'renewed', 'energy', 'Enterprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'journey', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'top', 'notch', 'cast', 'writing/direction', 'end', 'series']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Third Season
