1530946,A340BPMJZX0VML,B007HQGUFO,"D. Thompson ""Book-a-holic""","[0, 0]","Awesome Science Explore Yellowstone (episode 2) with Noah Justice. r  This was the 2nd video that we watched of this series (so far there are 6 all together), immediately after watching the 1st episode. The information given continued to hold my 9 yr old son's interest through out the whole video. The young man who hosts the DVD is very knowledgeable about Creation Science and the location that he is exploring. He gives information from a Creation point of view while helping children to understand the evolutionist point of view and then debunking it by Biblically backing up the Creation point of view. There are lots of wonderful scenic views of the area, maps, facts, and a combination of History and Science provided. I have noticed that not all sites provide the Study Guide we received with these DVDs and those that do require that you  order them separately for an additional cost. In my opinion this it's well worth it to by the Study Guide to accompany the DVD. The Study Guides are put out by Master Books. The Study Guide breaks down to the various points of interest of the location and scientific, including vocabulary, discussion questions and bonus activities to do. We will be purchasing the rest of the series and will be looking forward to more being added in the future. It'll well be worth the investment to add them to our home library. The DVD's are also put out by Master Books.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from New Leaf Publishing Group's blogging for books program.

1530947,A269SWH1PQL4PQ,B007HQGUFO,Dustybug,"[0, 0]","we've found a great resource to aid in the science department with the Awesome Science series featuring the young host, Noah Justice.  Produced by Kyle Justice who has worked for the likes of National Geographic, ESPN, and The Outdoors Channel, this series, Noah tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly well with a young earth creationist worldview.Each thirty minute video contains information weaving biblical account with scientific observations to show that so many of the things that secular scientists would have you believe couldn't possibly happen within a 6,000 year earth age time frame, actually fit in quite well with Scripture.They are not at all dry and are packed with tons of educational information in a light and informative way!  Noah, the young host, is personable and articulate but has a personality that children will find easy to watch.  He lays out information comparing secular scientists views against biblical account and shows how even the fossil layers were created rapidly during the global flood of Noah's time rather than over millions and millions of years as evolutionists believe.In the second episode, Explore Yellowstone you will learn how the park's natural attractions can all be explained by using your Bible!  Among other things Noah explains:-how  the Yellowstone lake is a remnant from the glaciers melting during the Ice Age following the flood-how the petrified forests  were not a product of many forests that were laid on top of the other over 30,000 years but how trees were buried in accumulating silt with the movement of all the water that covered the earth during the flood-how the Yellowstone super volcano will most likely erupt again according to scriptures that speak about such things in 2 Peter.-large deposits of lime mud were deposited during the flood and how that leads to the formation of the terraces in the parkThe scenery in the video is breathtaking and there are scripture references posted across the screen when applicable so that you can take notes and go search your Bible after viewing. Study guides are available if you would like to expand the use of them from supplements to actual curriculum or to just further discussion with your family about how we can confirm the biblical historical record by closely examining the world around us.",5,Education from a Biblical Perspective!,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2375,"[""'ve"", 'found', 'great', 'resource', 'aid', 'science', 'department', 'Awesome', 'Science', 'series', 'featuring', 'young', 'host', 'Noah', 'Justice', 'Produced', 'Kyle', 'Justice', 'who', 'worked', 'likes', 'National', 'Geographic', 'ESPN', 'Outdoors', 'Channel', 'series', 'Noah', 'tours', 'many', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'geological', 'sites', 'how', 'origins', 'line', 'up', 'perfectly', 'well', 'young', 'earth', 'creationist', 'worldview.Each', 'thirty', 'minute', 'video', 'information', 'weaving', 'biblical', 'account', 'scientific', 'observations', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'secular', 'scientists', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'happen', '6,000', 'year', 'earth', 'age', 'time', 'frame', 'actually', 'fit', 'quite', 'well', 'Scripture.They', 'are', 'not', 'dry', 'are', 'packed', 'tons', 'educational', 'information', 'light', 'informative', 'way', 'Noah', 'young', 'host', 'personable', 'articulate', 'personality', 'children', 'will', 'find', 'easy', 'watch', 'out', 'information', 'comparing', 'secular', 'scientists', 'views', 'biblical', 'account', 'how', 'even', 'fossil', 'layers', 'were', 'created', 'rapidly', 'global', 'flood', 'Noah', 'time', 'rather', 'millions', 'millions', 'years', 'evolutionists', 'believe.In', 'second', 'episode', 'Explore', 'Yellowstone', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'park', 'natural', 'attractions', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'using', 'Bible', 'other', 'things', 'Noah', '-how', 'Yellowstone', 'lake', 'remnant', 'glaciers', 'melting', 'Ice', 'Age', 'following', 'flood-how', 'petrified', 'forests', 'were', 'not', 'product', 'many', 'forests', 'were', 'laid', 'top', 'other', '30,000', 'years', 'how', 'trees', 'were', 'buried', 'accumulating', 'silt', 'movement', 'water', 'covered', 'earth', 'flood-how', 'Yellowstone', 'super', 'volcano', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'erupt', 'again', 'according', 'scriptures', 'speak', 'such', 'things', '2', 'Peter.-large', 'deposits', 'lime', 'mud', 'were', 'deposited', 'flood', 'how', 'formation', 'terraces', 'parkThe', 'scenery', 'video', 'breathtaking', 'are', 'scripture', 'references', 'posted', 'screen', 'when', 'applicable', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'notes', 'go', 'search', 'Bible', 'viewing', 'Study', 'guides', 'are', 'available', 'would', 'like', 'expand', 'use', 'supplements', 'actual', 'curriculum', 'just', 'further', 'discussion', 'family', 'how', 'can', 'confirm', 'biblical', 'historical', 'record', 'closely', 'examining', 'world']",Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice

Filled with beautiful cinematography, and straightforward explanations  for the formation of some of God's most amazing natural wonders.Awesome Science is a creation video targeted for a younger audience, but would make a great family time pastime. Everyone will learn something new along the way!I enjoyed how well this video was put together, the graphics and effects were well executed. Every time I watch a Creation video or read a book, I can't help but be in awe of God's glorious creation! What I found most fascinating was learning about the formation of the petrified ridge in Yellowstone--I don't even remember seeing it when I was there! But it was so cool learning about how even things that you wouldn't even think about that much all point to a Biblical flood and Creation.Overall, it was a fun video, a bit short for my taste, but I can see where lots of kids have short attention spans ;) This is a DVD series that you can feel great about letting your kids watch, because there are no millions of years! A well put together series, that I would recommend highly to families with children aged 6-13!Final Rating: 5 out of 5I received this DVD from the publisher in return for an honest review :)",5,"Fun, Informative Trip to Yellowstone!",1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1550,"['Take', 'trip', 'Yellowstone', 'National', 'Park', 'Noah', 'Justice', 'Awesome', 'Science', 'new', 'DVD', 'Creation', 'series', 'Master', 'Books', 'tour', 'most', 'famous', 'natural', 'attractions', 'United', 'States.This', 'DVD', 'was', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'packed', 'fun', 'facts', 'Yellowstone', 'theory', 'evolution', 'Filled', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'straightforward', 'explanations', 'formation', 'God', 'most', 'amazing', 'natural', 'wonders.Awesome', 'Science', 'creation', 'video', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audience', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'family', 'time', 'pastime', 'Everyone', 'will', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'well', 'video', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'graphics', 'effects', 'were', 'well', 'executed', 'time', 'watch', 'Creation', 'video', 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'awe', 'God', 'glorious', 'creation', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'was', 'learning', 'formation', 'petrified', 'ridge', 'Yellowstone', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'learning', 'how', 'even', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'much', 'point', 'Biblical', 'flood', 'Creation.Overall', 'was', 'fun', 'video', 'bit', 'short', 'taste', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'lots', 'kids', 'have', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'DVD', 'series', 'can', 'feel', 'great', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'are', 'millions', 'years', 'well', 'together', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly', 'families', 'children', 'aged', '6-13', 'Final', 'Rating', '5', '5I', 'received', 'DVD', 'publisher', 'return', 'honest', 'review']",Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice

Secular and biblical geologists both agree on the evidence found in Yellowstone, but disagree on how to interpret that evidence.""Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice is the second DVD in the Awesome Science series that ties physical evidence with a global flood using Empirical science as recently seen during the Missoula flood in Eastern Washington state.Join 14 year old, homeschooled, Noah Justice as he takes you through the evidence  supporting and defending a Biblical worldview of a worldwide, catastrophic flood.  Some of these evidences include:  the rate of growth of terraces in the Mammoth Hot Springs area, complex structured microbes in hot pool's, the absence of glaciation and much more!Also a part of this DVD is a very well done section on the Petrified Forrest with 7 Awesome Facts that support a young Earth theory.In addition to the video is a study guide to help tie information together.  (This can be purchased separately.)  Within these pages are:  General information about Yellowstone, the Geologic Column, Geysers, Yellow River and Hayden Valley, Yellowstone Falls and Lake, Hot Springs, Petrified Forrest and much, much more!  As with Explore the Grand Canyon, throughout this study guide are great discussion questions.  For example:  ""Why do secular scientists have to combine locations to get their full view of the geologic column?""The Awesome Science Series is one that should be in every home library.

Yellowstone is one of the national parks that is still on our ""to visit"" list.In Exploring Yellowstone with Noah Justice, Noah continues with his educational yet entertaining presentation style as he compares the two different views of the Yellowstone. The video itself is a good quality production. Noah's Dad, Kyle Justice, who produced the video has had his work featured on networks such as National Geographic and the Outdoor Channel. As a homeschool family, the Justices have gotten the whole family involved in the production of this series.Most science videos have adults teaching the students, so it's fun to see a quality nature/science video presented by a kid to kids. Even though the videos have been done in a kid-friendly format, people of all ages will enjoy the videos.In this 30-minute video, Noah talks about how:*the evidence points toward the Geologic Column being created by the Global Flood*super volcanoes shaped the earth after the Global Flood*the evidence points toward the petrified forests in Yellowstone being formed in a few years, not millions of years.Viewers are encouraged to continually check scripture to make sure that the information being presented is Biblical which is something that I really appreciated.Each video has an available study guide which includes review exercises and a discussion guide for the various segments within the video. The study guides help viewers get the most out of the videos. The suggested bonus activities will allow viewers to dig deeper into the topics being presented.When watching the video, you'll want to make sure you check out the bloopers as they are rather amusing.

The Awesome Science DVDs are a family production beginning with Noah (your guide) and his father (whose video talents have been displayed on National Geographic, ESPN, and the Outdoor Channel).  This homeschooling family has brought a much-needed Creation-based science series into our living room.Whether your children are in Christian school, homeschooled, or in a public school, this is one of those resources you don't want to pass by.  Give your children (yourself!) the knowledge you need to defend your faith and the Biblical account of Creation.  Learn how and why features in Yellowstone didn't take tens of thousands of years of erosion to be created.It's important to understand the significance of why your faith cannot be based on millions of years.  Death couldn't have existed before sin, but that is what evolution teaches.  Immerse yourself and your family in the Bible and Creation-based science resources and you will treasure that what God says is the absolute truth.  This is a wonderfully put together family-friendly video that you will be watching again and again.There is a third Awesome Science DVD currently available as well - Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest with Noah Justice.
