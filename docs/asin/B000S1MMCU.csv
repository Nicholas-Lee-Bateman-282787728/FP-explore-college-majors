I thought I was watching a straight horror, but even better, it turned out to be an outrageous black comedy-horror that is deftly handled by Director Peter Medak. The teleplay was written by Richard Chizmar and co-star, Jonathan Schaech, and based on a story by Bentley Little. Mike and Pam Franks have inherited Mike's grandmother's house in Virginia and move there with their daughter Amy. The house is filled with all sorts of antiques and early American artifacts. Mike makes a surprise discovery behind a painting of George Washington. Hidden beneath the canvas is a letter in which the writer talks about eating the flesh of children. It is signed with the initials ""G.W."" and also includes a fork that appears to be carved out of human bone.Mike shows the letter to Samuel, a friend of his grandfathers, and Samuel asks...no, DEMANDS that mike sell the letter. Mike refuses and that's when the trouble begins. Soon a gang of men dressed in Colonial American costumes is banging on his door, demanding he turn over the letter. Mike and his family flee back to their home but the trouble doesn't end. He shares the letter with a history professor friend who tells him his family is in great danger from the Washingtonians! The professor reveals that George Washington, the father of our country, was, in truth, a cannibal! George had a taste for virgin flesh and his symbol of a ""cherry"" tree made me laugh out loud and realize the director had pulled one over on me. Cherry tree...virgin flesh...that's gold!Mike soon finds out that this cannibalistic cult of Washingtonians still thrives today and his grandparents were both members. Does mike turn over the letter and keep Washington's secret safe or does he keep it hidden and become the main course at their next gathering?I loved how the story drew on Da Vinci Code influence. In that blockbuster, the secret society are protecting the truth about Jesus, here they are protecting the outrageous secret that Washington ate human flesh! He apparently acquired the taste during that hostile winter at Valley Forge...What makes the episode work so well is that the performances are all played pretty straight...all except for the various Washingtonians who are over-the-top in their performances. They pinch the cheeks of little Amy and tell her she's ""cute enough to eat"" and they mean it! Oh yes...there is plenty of gore as the Washingtonians much one various body parts and entrails...we even get to see Thomas Jefferson torn to pieces. Terrifying but downright hilarious.

Quite the contrary; old George had a secret and the secret involved the reality behind wooden teeth and a bit on the bones of children. That meant he wasn't the gentle old man from history books - quite the contrary, in fact.And when realizations about this surface, The Washingtonians come as well.When I saw that Bentley Little's short story, The Washintonians (from the novel The Collection), had been given a space in the Masters of Horror workshop, I new it would be funny. It delved a little into the backdrop of horror and it delved a little into the backdrop of comedy, making it quite the funny remark on what history really is. The acting was good, too, and the fun was there to be had. Added to that was the fact that it did justice to what Little had intended, not trying to take the subject too seriously but not trying to take it too lightly, either.It was just the right climate for just the right kind of tell.When looking through the Masters of Horror catalog, I thought this was one of the fun titles. Compared to a lot of the others, it doThe Collectionesn't try to take itself too seriously. And how could it, really, with people in powdered wigs playing the bit at bad guys?This might make it wonderful for some, but it might also make it the opposite for others. It just depends on how much you want to laugh at your movie, how you see a ""B movie"" when you look into the cinematic mirror, and if you appreciate an interestingly odd tale? If you can say you do like a good concept, a nice laugh, and don't need a scare from the tale to make it enjoyably frightful then you'll like this outing. If not, you'd be better served looking by other MOH tales.",4,Governing Worlds with Wooden Teeth,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,1734,"['George', 'Washington', 'was', ""n't"", 'person', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'contrary', 'old', 'George', 'had', 'secret', 'secret', 'involved', 'reality', 'wooden', 'teeth', 'bit', 'bones', 'children', 'meant', 'was', ""n't"", 'gentle', 'old', 'man', 'history', 'books', 'quite', 'contrary', 'fact.And', 'when', 'realizations', 'surface', 'Washingtonians', 'come', 'well.When', 'saw', 'Bentley', 'Little', 'short', 'story', 'Washintonians', 'novel', 'Collection', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'space', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'workshop', 'new', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'delved', 'little', 'backdrop', 'horror', 'delved', 'little', 'backdrop', 'comedy', 'making', 'quite', 'funny', 'remark', 'what', 'history', 'really', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'fun', 'was', 'be', 'had', 'Added', 'was', 'fact', 'did', 'justice', 'what', 'Little', 'had', 'intended', 'not', 'trying', 'take', 'subject', 'too', 'seriously', 'not', 'trying', 'take', 'too', 'lightly', 'either.It', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'climate', 'just', 'right', 'kind', 'tell.When', 'looking', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'catalog', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'fun', 'titles', 'Compared', 'lot', 'others', 'Collectiones', ""n't"", 'try', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'how', 'could', 'really', 'people', 'powdered', 'wigs', 'playing', 'bit', 'bad', 'guys', 'might', 'make', 'wonderful', 'might', 'also', 'make', 'opposite', 'others', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'want', 'laugh', 'movie', 'how', 'see', 'B', 'movie', 'when', 'look', 'cinematic', 'mirror', 'appreciate', 'interestingly', 'odd', 'tale', 'can', 'say', 'do', 'good', 'concept', 'nice', 'laugh', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'scare', 'tale', 'make', 'enjoyably', 'frightful', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'outing', 'not', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'served', 'looking', 'other', 'MOH', 'tales']","Washingtonians, The"
