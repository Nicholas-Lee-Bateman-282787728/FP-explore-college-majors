This movie has a great storyline.  In this movie the kids hunted by devon actually fight back which is awsome i think it has a good bit of fighting and makes for a pretty good watch.,5,This is a good watch..,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,329,"['movie', 'good', 'begginning', 'end', 'i', 'personally', 'have', 'movie', 'dont', 'think', 'critical', 'critics', 'give', 'credit', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'storyline', 'movie', 'kids', 'hunted', 'devon', 'actually', 'fight', 'back', 'awsome', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'bit', 'fighting', 'pretty', 'good', 'watch']",Devon's Ghost: Legend of the Bloody Boy
896028,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B0007Z0OO0,Ghoulie Guru,"[4, 6]","I'm completely confused by the title of this movie. For one thing, there is no ghost. For another thing, I don't know who the Bloody Boy is. This is one of those horror movies that you watch and wonder seriously if there was ever a script for it, or if they just kinda made it up as they went along. The story concerns a High School where there's a legend about some kind of murderer who dresses up in a baseball uniform.This guy makes a weapon out of a bat with a saw blade and goes around killing a bunch of hapless teenagers. It's your basic wanna-be Kevin Williamson slasher with a Baseball Fury from the Warriors. Clich&eacute;s and boredom follow. All of the high school students are in their thirties, the guys have receding hairlines, and the Asian kid knows karate. Since there is no ghost, it's clearly trying to be a Kevin Williamson movie, and I have no idea what the Bloody Boy is, I've thought up a more appropriate title: I Know What You Did Last Baseball Season.No script for the movie... Strike one!Clich&eacute;d teen characters who are actually in their 30's... Strike two!Karate fight between the Asian kid and the Baseball Fury... Strike three! You're outta there!",1,Strike Three...

896031,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0007Z0OO0,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","Here is another classic, low budget horror example of never judging a film by its cover.  Sure the baseball player on the cover holding a bat with a saw blade embedded into it sure seems to promise a fun horror film but you would be wrong.  First of all, there's no ghost AND no bloody boy but whoever said there was truth in advertising.  The plot concerns the death of young Devon Anderson who was allegedly killed by his parents.  Now years later (it's always years later) a serial killer is wracking up a body count by killing students from Canyon High who they believe is Devon...evidently his ghost or maybe that he never really died.  Other than that it sticks to the usual slasher clich?'s but doesn't do so with any particular skill or ingenuity.  The special effects are terrible.  I mean do you have to have taken a film class to know how to make SOMEWHAT believable looking fake blood?  Evil Dead did it with karo syrup that you can buy for a couple of bucks.  The acting is pretty terrible although one rather amusing casting choice is Johnny Yong Bosch who played the black power ranger on the Power Rangers TV show from 1994 - 1996 as well as in the Power Rangers Movie.  But if he's the best actor you have then you are in serious trouble in general.  Bad dialog, worse delivery from most of the amateur cast.  Not a good movie.",2,IT'S THE BLACK POWER RANGER!,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,1344,"['Here', 'classic', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'example', 'never', 'judging', 'film', 'cover', 'Sure', 'baseball', 'player', 'cover', 'holding', 'bat', 'saw', 'blade', 'embedded', 'sure', 'promise', 'fun', 'horror', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'First', 'all', 'ghost', 'bloody', 'boy', 'whoever', 'said', 'was', 'truth', 'advertising', 'plot', 'death', 'young', 'Devon', 'Anderson', 'who', 'was', 'allegedly', 'killed', 'parents', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'always', 'years', 'later', 'serial', 'killer', 'wracking', 'up', 'body', 'count', 'killing', 'students', 'Canyon', 'High', 'who', 'believe', 'Devon', 'evidently', 'ghost', 'maybe', 'never', 'really', 'died', 'Other', 'usual', 'slasher', 'clich', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'particular', 'skill', 'ingenuity', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'terrible', 'mean', 'do', 'have', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'class', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'SOMEWHAT', 'believable', 'looking', 'fake', 'blood', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'did', 'karo', 'syrup', 'can', 'buy', 'couple', 'bucks', 'acting', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'one', 'rather', 'amusing', 'casting', 'choice', 'Johnny', 'Yong', 'Bosch', 'who', 'played', 'black', 'power', 'ranger', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'TV', 'show', '1994', '1996', 'as', 'well', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'best', 'actor', 'have', 'then', 'are', 'serious', 'trouble', 'general', 'Bad', 'dialog', 'worse', 'delivery', 'most', 'amateur', 'cast', 'Not', 'good', 'movie']",Devon's Ghost: Legend of the Bloody Boy
