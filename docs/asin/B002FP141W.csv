1266773,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002FP141W,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Yes, Lymelife is actually a drama.  It's not a comedy.  If there's any comedy segments here, they only appear briefly before immediately switching back to drama scenes.It's about... well actually, it's about two separate things (both involving relationships).One of which is about Rory Culkin (WOW does he ever look like his older brother Macaulay!) trying to hit off a relationship with a girl who lives up the street.Throughout the movie Rory's character and the girl seem to be nothing more than simple friends (and even THAT seems like a stretch) but then things change as the story moves along.  I wasn't really sure which direction the story was going involving these two characters, but I guess what ends up happening makes perfect sense by the conclusion of the film.  It's a teenage relationship and it was written in a nice way.The other storyline is about Rory's parents (played by Alec Baldwin and Jill Hennessy) going through an extremely rocky marriage because of a constant cheating problem.  I don't want to spoil what actually happens though.  Let's just say, everyone in town apparently knows about it (including their own spouse!) but nothing ever really happens... at least, it initially *seems* like nothing will ever happen.  This is an even bigger storyline than the other one with Rory's character.Overall, yes, this is definitely not a comedy.  This is a storyline that quite possibly many people out there can relate to.  Perhaps even being able to place themselves in Rory Culkin's shoes.  It's a really good storyline though.  It's simple, definitely not out of the realm of possibility, and it kept my interest from beginning to end.",5,good drama,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,1662,"['Yes', 'Lymelife', 'actually', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'segments', 'here', 'only', 'appear', 'briefly', 'immediately', 'switching', 'back', 'drama', 'scenes.It', 'well', 'actually', 'two', 'separate', 'things', 'involving', 'relationships', '.One', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'WOW', 'ever', 'look', 'older', 'brother', 'Macaulay', 'trying', 'hit', 'off', 'relationship', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'street.Throughout', 'movie', 'Rory', 'character', 'girl', 'seem', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'simple', 'friends', 'even', 'stretch', 'then', 'things', 'change', 'story', 'moves', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'direction', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'involving', 'two', 'characters', 'guess', 'what', 'up', 'happening', 'perfect', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'film', 'teenage', 'relationship', 'was', 'written', 'nice', 'way.The', 'other', 'storyline', 'Rory', 'parents', 'played', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'going', 'extremely', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'constant', 'cheating', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'what', 'actually', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'everyone', 'town', 'apparently', 'including', 'own', 'spouse', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'least', 'initially', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'happen', 'even', 'bigger', 'storyline', 'other', 'one', 'Rory', 'character.Overall', 'yes', 'definitely', 'not', 'comedy', 'storyline', 'quite', 'possibly', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'can', 'relate', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'being', 'able', 'place', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'shoes', 'really', 'good', 'storyline', 'simple', 'definitely', 'not', 'realm', 'possibility', 'kept', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

I've been waiting for the film to come out on DVD, since I couldn't see it in the theaters.  It was well worth the wait.Lymelife centers on growing up during the 70s and focuses on members of two families struggling to face their dysfunction while making some sense of their lives and finding something positive to see them through the trials of human relationships.  The cast was really stellar especially Rory Culkin with his heartfelt, perfectly awkward portrayal of a young teenage boy discovering love for the first time, learning to stand up for himself and to accept his family with all their imperfections.  I expected great acting from the cast because they're so talented, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing out loud in specific moments when I least expected(not at the serious situations themselves but the irony of how those situations were written and given a dry, sarcastic wit in specific moments that were unexpected for me as a viewer), and this movie is not a comedy or lighthearted by any means.  While the film is 90 minutes or so, the Director Derick Martini did an excellent job of keeping the film flowing at a good pace and really giving a viewer like me an opportunity to get to know the characters and really feel a sincere connection to them.  I only wish it were longer and there were more scenes with Kieran Culkin and his real life brother Rory.  They obviously are close in real life as brothers and it was fun to watch them act together in a wonderful film and see that spark and spontaneity in their acting.As always, Alec Baldwin and Timothy Hutton are strong actors who give their performances in the film a very grounding effect when one could choose not to be sympathetic to the actions of either of their characters.  Jill Hennessy did a very fine job as a mother of the two Culkin characters and the frustrated, ""good"" wife of Alec Baldwin.  Emma Roberts gave her character the right amount of worldliness and sensitivity and her chemistry with Rory Culkin was playful and believable, while Cynthia Nixon as the carefree wild wife gives a measured yet insightful performance.All in all, I really liked the film.  I just wish there were more bonus materials for the film such as a Making Of and interviews with the cast.  There are many deleted scenes and an alternate ending to watch with commentary from both director Derick Martini and Rory Culkin.  I'd  still love to hear what they have to say about their characters and how they liked making the film, maybe they'll embellish the bonus materials in a later release.",5,A film with heart,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2657,"['lack', 'better', 'way', 'start', 'out', 'review', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'theaters', 'was', 'well', 'wait.Lymelife', 'centers', 'growing', 'up', '70s', 'focuses', 'members', 'two', 'families', 'struggling', 'face', 'dysfunction', 'making', 'sense', 'lives', 'finding', 'something', 'positive', 'see', 'trials', 'human', 'relationships', 'cast', 'was', 'really', 'stellar', 'especially', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'heartfelt', 'perfectly', 'awkward', 'portrayal', 'young', 'teenage', 'boy', 'discovering', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'learning', 'stand', 'up', 'accept', 'family', 'imperfections', 'expected', 'great', 'acting', 'cast', ""'re"", 'so', 'talented', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'specific', 'moments', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'not', 'serious', 'situations', 'irony', 'how', 'situations', 'were', 'written', 'given', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'specific', 'moments', 'were', 'unexpected', 'viewer', 'movie', 'not', 'comedy', 'lighthearted', 'means', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'Director', 'Derick', 'Martini', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'keeping', 'film', 'flowing', 'good', 'pace', 'really', 'giving', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'really', 'feel', 'sincere', 'connection', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'longer', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'real', 'life', 'brother', 'Rory', 'obviously', 'are', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'brothers', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'act', 'together', 'wonderful', 'film', 'see', 'spark', 'spontaneity', 'acting.As', 'always', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'are', 'strong', 'actors', 'who', 'give', 'performances', 'film', 'very', 'grounding', 'effect', 'when', 'one', 'could', 'choose', 'not', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'actions', 'characters', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'did', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'mother', 'two', 'Culkin', 'characters', 'frustrated', 'good', 'wife', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'gave', 'character', 'right', 'amount', 'worldliness', 'sensitivity', 'chemistry', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'was', 'playful', 'believable', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'carefree', 'wild', 'wife', 'measured', 'yet', 'insightful', 'performance.All', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'bonus', 'materials', 'film', 'such', 'Making', 'interviews', 'cast', 'are', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'watch', 'commentary', 'director', 'Derick', 'Martini', 'Rory', 'Culkin', ""'d"", 'still', 'love', 'hear', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'characters', 'how', 'liked', 'making', 'film', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'embellish', 'bonus', 'materials', 'later', 'release']",N/A

1266777,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002FP141W,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[17, 22]","I expected a funny comedy, the DVD cover art says, 'Violently Funny,' 'Laugh Out Loud Funny, entertaining and moving,' 'Wonderful,' and 'Tender.' The film inside isn't exactly any of these things. It is a coming of age film set in 1979 with the backdrop of some incredibly dysfunctional adults. No, I'm sorry; I laughed a little at the beginning, but then was just left sad after the half way point passed.The film starts off quirky and interesting. I love film that tries new things, sets up a different style, hides things from the viewer, and uses unusual music. All there in a wonderful mix during the first 30 minutes. At first I couldn't place the setting year (later in the film I discovered it is 1979, shown in a very pointed manner), so that was a bit unsettling. Two different families are shown and their relationship is unveiled slowly and wonderfully. There are a number of jokes that are genuinely funny. At about midpoint the film starts to devolve into lies, cheating, foul language, standard melodrama editing and filming, and the characters just become less and less believable and lose my connection with them (save the two lead characters, best friends Adrianna and Scott).Sadly as this film lost my interest, I started to notice horribly sloppy editing and continuity. Normally these things just pass by, I enjoy a film, I'm engrossed in the story, and continuity, unless grossly bad, just slips past. Not here, the story line got so bogged down that I started noticing all these problems. I noticed way too many cuts where somebody would have their hand up to their mouth and an immediate reverse cut with their hand down; cigarettes that change length immediately; or facial expressions that change too quickly during a cut.The cast. Rory Culkin (yes he has a famous brother) as Scott was good, as a more or less clueless teenager. Emma Roberts (Nancy Drew) as Adrianna was radiant, and did a wonderful job - just snotty enough to her best friend Scott, and then just exactly nice enough. Alec Baldwin as Scott's father, was a pig, pretty much as he always plays - he was a mix of Schwetty from SNL and his 30 Rock character. Jill Hennessy (Law and Order, and Crossing Jordan) as Scott's mother was decent. She was a little bit crazy, a little bit caring mother. Cynthia Nixon Adrianna's mother (Sex and the City) was sometimes amazing, sometimes just awful - her New York accent slipped in and out a lot. Timothy Hutton as Adrianna's father was just so dirty - looked like he never washed his hair the whole time. Bottom line, its more or less an all star cast. There wasn't a lot of chemistry between these characters, except Scott and Adrianna.The film was too long by a good 30 minutes. The first 30 minutes were excellent. The last 15 were very well done. There was 45 minutes where the film kind of lost its way.The film is rated R. There are sensuous moments with no nudity; a fair amount of strong language; and s small amount of violence. This film might be acceptable for slightly younger viewers. The themes are somewhat mature.The DVD includes a fairly long list of bonus features. The alternate ending is just plain awful. I've never seen a DVD where the alternate is 19 minutes, where 18 minutes was exactly the same as the original film. There is 20 seconds that is new or different. The voice over with the director and a few others is just plain annoying. Clearly the director loved the script written version that is the alternate. Frankly, this is a huge waste of time, the released ending is exactly the right ending. There are a series of deleted scenes. Again, I had a hard time seeing what is different, other than extensions of what was included in the released film.I was disappointed by this film. There are much better coming of age films.Adventureland,Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, andAlmost Famouscome to mind.

Timothy Hutton, however, as the lyme-diseased, depressed husband who witnesses his wife's infidelity - deserves the highest accolades. His performance in this film is flawless, portraying a man suffering from a disease that has rendered him incapable of functioning as the man he once was. I found his performance riveting and heartbreaking. Kieran Culkin is the next Sean Penn - that is a given. His underscored performance as a love-struck, confused teen was excellent.

1266783,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B002FP141W,Keris Nine,"[1, 1]","Don't let comparisons withAmerican Beautysway your judgement or unduly put you off Lymelife.  Sure, it deals with dysfunction in American families that is very much tied to social pressures and the need to conform and succeed, and yes, it's occasionally bleak and hard-hitting in its observations, but Lymelife comes from a deeper, more personal place.  Reflecting the experience of the filmmakers (directed by Derick Martini from a script co-written with his brother Steven), the film feels much more affectionate and realistic in its reminiscence of youth and of growing up, capturing a sense of life during a key period in the 70s, without idealising the experience or shying away from the harsh truths.Strictly speaking, the period isn't the decade for the filmmakers own coming-of-age, but there's a realisation that much of what has shaped the world they live in comes from their family background in the 70s.  In places like suburban Long Island, there was indeed a mini boom and a chance to live the American Dream and Scott's father Mickey (Alec Baldwin) is one of those men pursuing his dream to build that dream through his construction company.  Despite the wealth that this brings, all is not happy in the Bartlett household, and the constant pursuit to succeed is putting stress on the family, as is Mickey's carrying on of an affair with his neighbour.  Scott meanwhile - superbly played by Kieran Culkin - has his own concerns, dealing with bullying in school and trying to take his childhood friendship with Adrianna (Emma Roberts) onto a new level, but the slightly older girl is quickly developing beyond the reach of an adolescent still obsessed with Star Wars.The fact that the 70s isn't the filmmaker's own experience does show up in one or two minor anachronisms (the Falklands issue would scarcely have figured here in America, least of all at this time), but essentially the observations are true and put across keenly and with a degree of subtlety for the most part (the slow, creeping effects of Lyme disease afflicting Adrianna's father representative of the wider breakdown of values), but it's also able to hit hard when required to do so.  It does retread ground covered in many US films of this kind - Noah Baumbach'sThe Squid and the Whalealso comes to mind, as does hisMargot at the Wedding- but, although produced by Martin Scorcese, there's a nice indie sensibility to Lymelife and some fine performances that should help distinguish it and even lift it above the crowd.",4,American life,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,2506,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'comparisons', 'withAmerican', 'Beautysway', 'judgement', 'unduly', 'put', 'off', 'Lymelife', 'Sure', 'dysfunction', 'American', 'families', 'very', 'much', 'tied', 'social', 'pressures', 'need', 'conform', 'succeed', 'yes', 'occasionally', 'bleak', 'hard-hitting', 'observations', 'Lymelife', 'deeper', 'more', 'personal', 'place', 'Reflecting', 'experience', 'filmmakers', 'directed', 'Derick', 'Martini', 'script', 'co-written', 'brother', 'Steven', 'film', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'affectionate', 'realistic', 'reminiscence', 'youth', 'growing', 'up', 'capturing', 'sense', 'life', 'key', 'period', '70s', 'idealising', 'experience', 'shying', 'away', 'harsh', 'truths.Strictly', 'speaking', 'period', ""n't"", 'decade', 'filmmakers', 'own', 'coming-of-age', 'realisation', 'much', 'what', 'shaped', 'world', 'live', 'family', 'background', '70s', 'places', 'suburban', 'Long', 'Island', 'was', 'indeed', 'mini', 'boom', 'chance', 'live', 'American', 'Dream', 'Scott', 'father', 'Mickey', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'one', 'men', 'pursuing', 'dream', 'build', 'dream', 'construction', 'company', 'wealth', 'not', 'happy', 'Bartlett', 'household', 'constant', 'pursuit', 'succeed', 'putting', 'stress', 'family', 'Mickey', 'carrying', 'affair', 'neighbour', 'Scott', 'meanwhile', 'superbly', 'played', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'own', 'concerns', 'dealing', 'bullying', 'school', 'trying', 'take', 'childhood', 'friendship', 'Adrianna', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'new', 'level', 'slightly', 'older', 'girl', 'quickly', 'developing', 'reach', 'adolescent', 'still', 'obsessed', 'Star', 'Wars.The', 'fact', '70s', ""n't"", 'filmmaker', 'own', 'experience', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'two', 'minor', 'anachronisms', 'Falklands', 'issue', 'would', 'scarcely', 'have', 'figured', 'here', 'America', 'least', 'time', 'essentially', 'observations', 'are', 'true', 'put', 'keenly', 'degree', 'subtlety', 'most', 'part', 'slow', 'creeping', 'effects', 'Lyme', 'disease', 'afflicting', 'Adrianna', 'father', 'representative', 'wider', 'breakdown', 'values', 'also', 'able', 'hit', 'hard', 'when', 'required', 'do', 'so', 'retread', 'ground', 'covered', 'many', 'US', 'films', 'kind', ""Baumbach'sThe"", 'Squid', 'Whalealso', 'mind', 'hisMargot', 'Wedding-', 'produced', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'nice', 'indie', 'sensibility', 'Lymelife', 'fine', 'performances', 'should', 'help', 'distinguish', 'even', 'lift', 'crowd']",N/A

This is strange, since he is a part player in this dramedy that is a thinly-veiled copy of the 1999 Academy Award winner ""American Beauty""American Beauty (Widescreen Edition).As in the earlier movie, ""Lymelife"" features two suburban families that interact, first through their children (played by Rory Culkin and Emma Roberts), then through an extramarital affair via work, and finally through an interaction between the two husbands that results in firearms becoming involved. If you saw ""American Beauty,"" you know the exact same pattern of events happened in that film. The ending here is a little different.I enjoyed this film most of the way through, until it became obvious this was ""American Beauty Pt. 2."" The work with the teenage kids is the best part of the movie. Their relationship is realistic, touching, involving and sometimes funny. It is not really about growing up or, to use the cliche, coming of age, as much as it is the foil for the relationships between the parents and the contrast with the two dysfunctional families (Cliche No. 2.)The one original thing about ""Lymelife"" is its title and purpose; it is without doubt the first feature film designed on the basis of Lyme disease.

However, I picked up Lymelife mainly due to the great cast.  I was not disappointed.I was drawn into this movie immediately.  There is superb character development, particularly in Rory Culkin's Scott Bartlett.  The deep, bordering on love friendship he has with Emma Roberts' Adrianna is perfectly portrayed.  These two are obviously the center point of the film, but there are so many other characters that, although secondary, do not seem any less significant.  Alec Baldwin sets aside his terrific humor and gives a splendid performance as Scott's tough-love father.  And I'll agree with another reviewer who asked where's the Oscar nomination for Timothy Hutton?  His Lyme disease-suffering Tommy is spectacular.  The bar scene with him and Baldwin is nothing short of masterful.Lymelife is a little known film with several big names in it.

Like American Beauty, Lymelife is about the difficulties and growing pains of growing up in the suburbs. The problems is, too much of this film seems to have been carbon copied from American Beauty.There is nothing wrong with filmmakers getting inspiration from another previously successful movie, especially one that has won so many accolades and acclaim as American Beauty. But Lymelife was trying too hard to derive the hell of suburban lifestyle, the growing pains of teenage youth, and difficulties of a marriage falling apart--all of it was taken directly from American Beauty. Even the ending was derived from American Beauty! Couldn't Derick Martini come up with a better ending?A few acting performances do stand out to keep this movie from getting too predictable and lame. Rory Culkin as Scott Barlett, a teenager who is going through the usual growing pains of being a teenager, put on a solid performance. Timothy Hutton was good as Charlie Bragg, a man who has lyme disease, and had the unfortunate luck of witnessing his wife have an adulterous affair with her boss. And Adam Scarimbolo played the role of Scott's bully very well.

The story follows two Long Island families as the adults implode onto the mid-life crisis adultery kick and the teen kids wallow through their angst and hormones. Solid performances all around, but Tim Hutton was excellent playing the Lyme disease damaged dad, full with a PTSD-like personality that amazingly appears to have the most centered personality in this film. The meaningful scenes are both awkward and believable, and as the director states in the commentary, the film is filled with tons of these ""organic moments"".The Blu quality is solid and the DTS sounds competent, but the few train scenes and gun sounds are all that travel to the outer channels. There is hardly any color in the film - ever, but the drab clothes and bleak landscapes still look vivid as can be in 1080. The supplements give this another star and include:* 8 deleted scenes totaling 7:30 minutes, with an optional commentary. They all would have been fine in the film and helped show some fine acting.* 4 minute (now infamous) alternate ending. Since they showed this film with different endings across the festival circuit, there has been a plethora of banter regarding the better of the endings. The film contains the ambiguous ending, this alternate ending (and much more believable for what was being shown) shows the graphic conclusion.* Commentary with Rory Culkin and Derick Martini. Almost a how-to on making people turn off a commentary, but give it 10-15 minutes and they gradually get better at it. Includes some nice references toThe 400 Blows - Criterion Collectionand the usual interesting tidbits on making an independent film with a stellar cast.There are several laugh out loud moments, but go into this expecting a solid angst film with the typical suburbanized dysfunctional adults. The front cover art makes you think this is a ""violently funny"" film, but I will be categorizing this in the drama section.

Jimmy (Kieran Culkin) is Scott's brother who is home from leave from the army. Jill Hennessy plays Brenda, the unhappy wife of Mickey who wants to go back to the Queens.The film was excellently acted and was perhaps too uncomfortable for my liking.

1266791,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002FP141W,Z Hayes,"[13, 14]","I admit that I picked this for viewing because of Alec Baldwin. The guy may have had his shares of troubles but he is quite a charismatic actor (well, in some movies more than others).  Set in Long Island, N.Y., the time period is the mid-70s, and it also has two Culkin brothers in it. Rory Culkin portrays a 15-year-old, Scott Bartlett whose parents,real estate developer Mickey (Alec Baldwin in a wolfish and arrogant role) and passive mother, Brenda (Jill Hennessy) reflect the trappings of a successful life, but are not altogether happy in their marriage. Scott is however more concerned with the girl next door, attractive Adrianna (Emma Roberts of Nancy Drew) who sort of teases him, but has other romantic inclinations. Adrianna' mom, Melissa (Cynthia Nixon)works for Mickey, and portrays a long-suffering wife who has to deal with her Lyme-disease addled husband, Tommy (Timothy Hutton). Oh, and there's Scott's brother Jimmy (Kieran Culkin), who's on leave from the army.The drama of the two families unfolds slowly, portraying the gradual unraveling of two marriages, whilst also delving into the sexual awakening of an adolescent boy who is tormented by his attraction to Adrianna, and also concerned about his parents' marriage. Rory Culkin does a credible job of playing the angsty teen, and grows on the viewer, eliciting one's empathy for the growing pains he goes through, without being overly melodramatic or sentimental. There's a good balance between the dark and light in this drama, and the ensemble cast does a great job in maintaining this balance, especially Alec Baldwin who plays true to type here.The story is far from fresh or original,as there have been so many other movies made about dysfunctional families, and adolescence (one of my favorites is ""The Squid and the Whale"") yet it strikes a chord, and this is largely due to the heartfelt performance by Rory Culkin. Another well-made coming-of-age movie is The Education of Charlie Banks.",5,An engaging coming-of-age drama,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,1973,"['admit', 'picked', 'viewing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'guy', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'shares', 'troubles', 'quite', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'well', 'movies', 'more', 'others', 'Set', 'Long', 'Island', 'N.Y.', 'time', 'period', 'mid-70s', 'also', 'two', 'Culkin', 'brothers', 'Rory', 'Culkin', '15-year-old', 'Scott', 'Bartlett', 'parents', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'Mickey', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'wolfish', 'arrogant', 'role', 'passive', 'mother', 'Brenda', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'reflect', 'trappings', 'successful', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'altogether', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Scott', 'however', 'more', 'concerned', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'attractive', 'Adrianna', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'who', 'sort', 'teases', 'other', 'romantic', 'inclinations', 'Adrianna', 'mom', 'Melissa', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'Mickey', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'who', 'deal', 'Lyme-disease', 'addled', 'husband', 'Tommy', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Oh', 'Scott', 'brother', 'Jimmy', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'who', 'leave', 'army.The', 'drama', 'two', 'families', 'unfolds', 'slowly', 'portraying', 'gradual', 'unraveling', 'two', 'marriages', 'whilst', 'also', 'delving', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'who', 'tormented', 'attraction', 'Adrianna', 'also', 'concerned', 'parents', 'marriage', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'credible', 'job', 'playing', 'angsty', 'teen', 'grows', 'viewer', 'eliciting', 'one', 'empathy', 'growing', 'pains', 'being', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'sentimental', 'good', 'balance', 'dark', 'light', 'drama', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'maintaining', 'balance', 'especially', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'true', 'type', 'here.The', 'story', 'far', 'fresh', 'original', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'made', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'adolescence', 'one', 'favorites', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'yet', 'chord', 'largely', 'due', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'well-made', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks']",N/A
