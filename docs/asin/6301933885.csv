It's not at all a slick, Hollywood-style thing a la ""Trick.""  There are long, long takes that may try your patience, except that they set a very individual tone and style.  Essentially the story of a shy, but spirited, small-town guy who decides all of a sudden to head for some ""Fun Down There"" in Manhattan, where he aimlessly rambles through his little journey of self-fulfillment with gay sex and love.  (The film is unrated due to some semi-explicit masturbatory sex.)  The film's humor is almost totally deadpan, and the brainless conversations between Buddy (Michael Waite) and his family are borderline hilarious.  (Buddy's parent's are played by Waite's real-life Mom & Dad.)  A real homemade project, from the days when ""independent"" meant something.  Maybe not for everyone, but worth a look for those interested in the evolution of gay subject matter in films.Trivia: an early performance in a supporting role by Michael Imperioli of The Sopranos fame.",3,"quirky, funny gay flick",1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,1048,"['strange', 'funny', 'little', 'gay', 'flick', 'made', 'shoestring', 'late', ""'80"", 'not', 'slick', 'Hollywood-style', 'thing', 'la', 'Trick', 'are', 'long', 'long', 'may', 'try', 'patience', 'set', 'very', 'individual', 'tone', 'style', 'Essentially', 'story', 'shy', 'spirited', 'small-town', 'guy', 'who', 'sudden', 'head', 'Fun', 'Down', 'Manhattan', 'where', 'aimlessly', 'little', 'journey', 'self-fulfillment', 'gay', 'sex', 'love', 'film', 'unrated', 'due', 'semi-explicit', 'masturbatory', 'sex', 'film', 'humor', 'almost', 'totally', 'deadpan', 'brainless', 'conversations', 'Buddy', 'Michael', 'Waite', 'family', 'are', 'borderline', 'hilarious', 'Buddy', 'parent', 'are', 'played', 'Waite', 'real-life', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'real', 'homemade', 'project', 'days', 'when', 'independent', 'meant', 'something', 'Maybe', 'not', 'everyone', 'look', 'interested', 'evolution', 'gay', 'subject', 'matter', 'films.Trivia', 'early', 'performance', 'supporting', 'role', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Sopranos', 'fame']",Fun Down There VHS
