472365,A17TDSX354MP7Y,6305661707,CPTScott,"[19, 19]","I recently purchased the four VHS version of Yoga Zone's Beginner Series. Just moments ago I finished doing this introductory program for the first time. While I am far from being a beginner and have been practicing daily for 9 years (w/ over 90 Yoga programs and years of instruction w/ a great teacher,)  I still enjoy doing programs like this now and then. Today I was looking to do a gentle practice on the longer side so it was a perfect program.I have many other Yoga Zone programs and really enjoy Alan Finger's teaching. He is a true master teacher whose father (and teacher)Mani Finger learned from a lineage of authentic Indian masters.This program is great on so many levels. First, the detailed instruction is great for someone who is a beginner or someone who has more experience but wants to keep refining their practice. The sequence of poses work your body gently and thoroughly through a wide range of motion (I feel amazing right now having just done it). It starts seated, then moves to all fours (cat, down dog etc), to standing postures, back to seated (twists, forward bends) and finishes lying in Savasana. The length of the program (55 minutes) lets you really take your time with each posture and really breathe into all the areas of tension that need to be released.There are four other ""students"" demonstrating the postures, with one showing modifications throughout.I am a big fan of Alan Finger's teaching because I find him to be detailed enough without ever becoming tedious. Even after 9 years of daily practice I found his instructions to be helpful reminders of subtle details which one can never master too well.Highly recommended!Namaste",5,Yoga Perfection With Alan Finger and Yoga Zone,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1673,"['recently', 'purchased', 'four', 'VHS', 'version', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Beginner', 'Series', 'Just', 'moments', 'ago', 'finished', 'doing', 'introductory', 'program', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'far', 'being', 'beginner', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'daily', '9', 'years', 'w/', '90', 'Yoga', 'programs', 'years', 'instruction', 'great', 'teacher', 'still', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'programs', 'now', 'then', 'Today', 'was', 'looking', 'do', 'gentle', 'practice', 'longer', 'side', 'was', 'perfect', 'program.I', 'have', 'many', 'other', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'programs', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'teaching', 'true', 'master', 'teacher', 'father', 'teacher', 'Mani', 'Finger', 'learned', 'lineage', 'authentic', 'Indian', 'masters.This', 'program', 'great', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'First', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'great', 'someone', 'who', 'beginner', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'experience', 'keep', 'refining', 'practice', 'sequence', 'poses', 'work', 'body', 'gently', 'thoroughly', 'wide', 'range', 'motion', 'feel', 'amazing', 'right', 'now', 'having', 'just', 'done', 'seated', 'then', 'fours', 'cat', 'down', 'dog', 'etc', 'standing', 'postures', 'back', 'seated', 'twists', 'forward', 'finishes', 'lying', 'Savasana', 'length', 'program', '55', 'minutes', 'really', 'take', 'time', 'posture', 'really', 'breathe', 'areas', 'tension', 'need', 'be', 'are', 'four', 'other', 'students', 'demonstrating', 'postures', 'one', 'showing', 'modifications', 'throughout.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'teaching', 'find', 'be', 'detailed', 'enough', 'ever', 'becoming', 'tedious', 'Even', '9', 'years', 'daily', 'practice', 'found', 'instructions', 'be', 'helpful', 'reminders', 'subtle', 'details', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'master', 'too', 'well.Highly', 'recommended', 'Namaste']",Yoga Zone - Introduction to Yoga VHS

My husband and I are becoming flexible and enjoying the feeling of full range of motion again.  We tried so many yoga DVD's with different instructors, many stating they were for beginners but weren't....this actually IS an introduction and is well worth the money.  Alan Finger describes exactly what he wants you to do and only do or go as far as you comfortably can.  He has an interesting accent and the timbre of his voice is perfect for a yoga class.  The pace is excellent.  Beginners can do this but it is also for those who have experience and flexibility.  55 minutes ending in the corpse pose works for us before bedtime and we have been sleeping so much better.  We strongly recommend this yoga DVD.  The best we have found.",5,FINALLY!

472367,A1ZMPQFEK37SL,6305661707,Just-Jennie,"[16, 16]","I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are on my first video, I still found this to be very good for beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique -- which I often forget.  I noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses, the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind.I honestly have to say that if I did NOT originally buy a yoga zone dvd, I more than likely would not have pursued the practice.  I think that Yoga Zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more.I highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga-lite out there.",5,Excellent video for those new to yoga,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,1222,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'new', 'Yoga', 'experience', 'started', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'DVD', 'hated', 'then', 'got', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Video', 'one', 'flexibility', 'toning', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'then', 'got', 'video', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'excellent', 'too', 'was', 'looking', 'beginner', 'video', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'one', 'advanced', 'parts', 'so', 'bought', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Introduction', 'Yoga', 'moves', 'are', 'first', 'video', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'beginners', 'Alan', 'again', 'breathing', 'technique', 'often', 'forget', 'noticed', 'review', 'someone', 'complained', 'slowness', 'Yes', 'move', 'slow', 'HOWEVER', ""'re"", 'beginner', ""'re"", 'just', 'learning', 'poses', 'last', 'thing', 'would', 'want', 'move', 'fast', 'time', 'explain', 'pose', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'when', ""'re"", 'doing', 'voice', 'very', 'soothing', 'calm', 'frame', 'mind.I', 'honestly', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'NOT', 'originally', 'buy', 'yoga', 'zone', 'dvd', 'more', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'pursued', 'practice', 'think', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'what', 'gotten', 'more', 'wanting', 'practice', 'more', 'learn', 'more.I', 'highly', 'suggest', 'dvd', 'beginner', 'yoga-lite', 'there']",Yoga Zone - Introduction to Yoga VHS

This is a slow paced practice that gives you an excellent foundation and helps you really understand proper alignment.  Unlike some ""beginner"" dvd's, the average person who has never done a yoga pose in their life can do this dvd because of the very precise and detailed instruction.Using this DVD as a foundation to beginning my yoga practice has allowed me to do so many other yoga dvd's that are great workouts but perhaps lacking a bit in the instructional side.  Alan Finger is very motivating and guides you through the best relaxations at the end.  I find that although he talks through them nearly the entire time, I can actually relax better into them than in other dvd's shavasana's where my mind tends to wander.I highly recommend this DVD.

472370,A3P738KVXL2YYM,6305661707,Mary Chrapliwy,"[33, 34]","I took a yoga class many years ago. I still remember how delightfully flexible I was and how peaceful I felt. Now a working mother with all the challenges and stresses we all feel from day to day, I yearned to recapture that feeling.Though I walk on a treadmill for 30-45 minutes every day, I knew that my muscles weren't what they were in my twenties so I thought it best to start with a beginning video. I am happy with my decision to do so.This video is an excellent starting point for someone beginning yoga, or someone like me who yearned to return to it. The instructor's voice is soothing and guides you through each posture coaching the location and tension of each muscle through entire postures - a very important key to yoga.Though the video is 55 minutes long, it most definitely doesn't feel so long. There were no tedious moments. My mind didn't wander from what I was doing to the inevitable stresses of work and daily life - your mind and body really do become one. At the end of the session there is a calming relaxation portion - the hallmark of any good yoga program.One more thing I liked about this video - there were four individuals doing poses at alternating levels. If you are still not as flexible as you would like to be, you can follow the lesser version of the posture demonstrated by one person on the screen. As you attain greater flexibility you can pose with the member demonstrating the most complex version of the pose. In short, you can individualize this yoga session to suit your own fitness level.I highly recommend this video for all of the reasons stated above. You can learn and grow with it and attain tighter muscles and a more peaceful mind.",5,Excellent for the beginning yoga enthusiast,1093132800,"08 22, 2004",2004,1686,"['took', 'yoga', 'class', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'delightfully', 'flexible', 'was', 'how', 'peaceful', 'felt', 'Now', 'working', 'mother', 'challenges', 'feel', 'day', 'day', 'yearned', 'recapture', 'feeling.Though', 'walk', 'treadmill', '30-45', 'minutes', 'day', 'knew', 'muscles', 'were', ""n't"", 'what', 'were', 'twenties', 'thought', 'best', 'start', 'beginning', 'video', 'am', 'happy', 'decision', 'do', 'so.This', 'video', 'excellent', 'starting', 'point', 'someone', 'beginning', 'yoga', 'someone', 'who', 'yearned', 'return', 'instructor', 'voice', 'soothing', 'guides', 'posture', 'coaching', 'location', 'tension', 'muscle', 'entire', 'postures', 'very', 'important', 'key', 'yoga.Though', 'video', '55', 'minutes', 'long', 'most', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'long', 'were', 'tedious', 'moments', 'mind', 'did', ""n't"", 'wander', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'inevitable', 'stresses', 'work', 'daily', 'life', 'mind', 'body', 'really', 'do', 'become', 'one', 'end', 'session', 'calming', 'relaxation', 'portion', 'hallmark', 'good', 'yoga', 'program.One', 'more', 'thing', 'liked', 'video', 'were', 'four', 'individuals', 'doing', 'poses', 'alternating', 'levels', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'flexible', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'can', 'follow', 'lesser', 'version', 'posture', 'demonstrated', 'one', 'person', 'screen', 'attain', 'greater', 'flexibility', 'can', 'pose', 'member', 'demonstrating', 'most', 'complex', 'version', 'pose', 'short', 'can', 'individualize', 'yoga', 'session', 'suit', 'own', 'fitness', 'level.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'reasons', 'stated', 'can', 'learn', 'grow', 'attain', 'tighter', 'muscles', 'more', 'peaceful', 'mind']",Yoga Zone - Introduction to Yoga VHS
