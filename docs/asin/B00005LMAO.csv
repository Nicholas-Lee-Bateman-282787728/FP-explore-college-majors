But this is a mixed bag that just seems a little confused. It is almost a Musketeer/pirate cross. The fencing goes from good to terrible, and that is a big shame as Eric roberts is damned good. If anyone has seen By the sword you know what I'm talking about.The camera work goes from good to terrible. What is good about the film is that it can be watched with kids, it is very swashbuckling in nature, it has Eric Roberts and some of the characters are adoreable even though they are steryotyped.

Baker,"[0, 0]","OK we caught this film on the TV a couple weeks ago and it is sooo bad it is hysterical.I've been doing historical costuming for years and the costumes were just wrong! While some were nice they were all such a hodge podge of different eras as to completely inacurate. It was as if they got all the historical and SCA/Fantasy reinactors they could find who had their own suits and made this movie. And the totaly riduculous dresses on the women that just look like they took a modern long velevet dress and put a VICTORIAN (1800's) hoop skirt on underneath it.And as if that wasn't bad enough it was soo badly acted by some and not so bad by others so you would get caught up in the good part and then roll on the floor laughing at the bad!Eric Roberts and Ron Perlman have a few brief scenes but it was soo bad.....The only reason I give it two stars at all is because they have a bloopers real, a-la Jackie Chan movies, at the end that was just great!

663687,A1EFS5PV3HOFDI,B00005LMAO,"Danielle Muller ""Shulamith""","[1, 4]","To put in plain and simple, this movie really has nothing to do with anything in particular besides the unromantic romance between a kings guard and a princess. Our movie begins one fine day when the Queen approaches the Kings guard with the proposition of his help to ensure the safety of their daughter as she travels with her dowry to wed the Sicilian King. Things go awry when a very dumb group of bandits attack them, and force the group into a broken down house, that just happens to sit in the very middle of a huge field. Now the fact that the placing of this house is very convenient, for the band of desperate, dirty ruffians  led by Ron Perlman must rush into  the open glade to attack.If this wasn't bad enough, we find that the good guys have a certain adventage, possessing a feat known as the ""Tigers Claw"" Which is supposed to be a deadly weapon. What it really is is sending three people rushing wildly out into the field and slaying as many people as possible. They only manage to achieve this successfully for the 'bad guys' happen to be insanely stupid. The sword play is also the worst I've ever seen. Stances are sloppy, there's virtually no talent displayed, and the fighting reminds me of the battles I used to fight against my brothers. Really bad and totally lacking in realistic proffesionalism.Oh, back to the story. Well, the 'bad guys' die without managing to kill even one of the opposing party. If this wasn't enough to make us convinced this was definatly a scripted movie, the way the guard and princess fall in love is even dumber. A few yells, proffesions of hate, and five minutes later they are in love. I shake my head in unseen disgust.Also don't be fooled, some have said this is a movie that gamers will love, they are wrong. We gamers are not so totally dumb that a movie such as this will have us jumping for joy. Arrgh......There still has to be a level of intelligence there for us to enjoy it.On the whole, this is a movie that has bad acting, bad camera work and equally bad music. Besides which the costumes where a few centuries short of being truly Renaissance. From hooped skirts, to the men's almost 1700th century styles, this definatly cannot be considered influenced by the century they where trying to portray.In conclusion, don't rent, and most definatly don't buy.

The plot is summarized by others, so see the other reviews. There was good, bad, and utterly awful acting, but so what, the movie is simply fun to watch as it never takes itself seriously. I was surprised to find that it was a theatrical release, and not a made-for-TV movie. With more money and a more expansive plot it could have been a truly great awful movie. It does have its moments, several in fact, when a pair of actors will have a quiet discussion with real emotion and honest content. Given its budget, which had to be low as they couldn't afford more than one set and used only half an ounce of fake blood, I doubt other directors (and casts) could have done as well.

Breen,"[11, 11]","Treachery, villainy, swordplay, noble secret love and a princess in peril: what more could the average ten year old would-be Musketeer ask for?Set in the days of chivalry at sword point, ""The King's Guard"" is the tale of the ""last stand"" of a princess (Ashley Jones) being taken to a marriage that will save her father's throne and the young noble Guard (Trevor St. John) who secretly loves her, against the traitorous ex-Guard (Eric Roberts) who wants her and the greedy Lord (Ron Perlman) who wants her dowry.This movie has nice costumes and I think that's where most of the money went. Ninety-nine percent of it takes place in one setting. There are no horses although the DVD cover shows a cavalry. The acting runs the spectrum from almost-painful-to-watch (Jones) to oh-good-someone-knows-what-they're-doing (Perlman, Roberts). The swordplay, although decently choreographed, is done too hesitantly by most of the actors to be truly exciting.People who are into the Renaissance Fair, SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) and LARP (Live Action Role Playing) scenes may be able to glean some inspiration from the costumes and sword play.Although there is much fighting there is no blood or gore so this would be an excellent family movie for anyone with young children going through a swashbuckling phase.There are some funny bloopers after the end credits.Worth a rent for gamers, worth a rent/buy used for youngsters.",3,For the ten year old Muskeeter.,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1424,"['Treachery', 'villainy', 'swordplay', 'noble', 'secret', 'love', 'princess', 'peril', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'average', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'would-be', 'Musketeer', 'ask', 'Set', 'days', 'chivalry', 'sword', 'point', 'King', 'Guard', 'tale', 'last', 'stand', 'princess', 'Ashley', 'Jones', 'being', 'taken', 'marriage', 'will', 'save', 'father', 'throne', 'young', 'noble', 'Guard', 'Trevor', 'St.', 'John', 'who', 'secretly', 'traitorous', 'ex-Guard', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'who', 'greedy', 'Lord', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'who', 'dowry.This', 'movie', 'nice', 'costumes', 'think', 'where', 'most', 'money', 'went', 'Ninety-nine', 'percent', 'place', 'one', 'setting', 'are', 'horses', 'DVD', 'cover', 'cavalry', 'acting', 'spectrum', 'almost-painful-to-watch', 'Jones', ""oh-good-someone-knows-what-they're-doing"", 'Perlman', 'Roberts', 'swordplay', 'decently', 'choreographed', 'done', 'too', 'hesitantly', 'most', 'actors', 'be', 'truly', 'exciting.People', 'who', 'are', 'Renaissance', 'Fair', 'SCA', 'Society', 'Creative', 'Anachronism', 'LARP', 'Live', 'Action', 'Role', 'Playing', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'glean', 'inspiration', 'costumes', 'sword', 'much', 'fighting', 'blood', 'gore', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'family', 'movie', 'anyone', 'young', 'children', 'going', 'swashbuckling', 'phase.There', 'are', 'funny', 'bloopers', 'end', 'credits.Worth', 'rent', 'gamers', 'rent/buy', 'used', 'youngsters']",The King's Guard
