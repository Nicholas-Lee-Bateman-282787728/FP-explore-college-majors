So I was a little concerned about watching a movie adaptation of it. I mean, really...how many movies ever stand up well to the book? This one doesn't. However, on it's own it's an entertaining and interesting flick. Overall the plot follows the book well, taking an ex-IRA executioner from fugitive to murderer to hero. What this movie lacks is character development. With the exception of  Fallon (Micky Rourke) all the people are shallow and one dimensional. The priest, Father de Costa (play ok by Bob Hoskins) never really seems the force he was in the book. You never know what drives him to try and save Fallon from this life of violence, when in the book it's de Costa's own past that mirrors Fallon. Alan Bates as the villan Meehan never really seems to get into the part. Where Meehan is dark, sinister, and VERY complex in the book here he's just there, with a little violence thrown in.One of the best sub-plots of this movie, though, wasn't even in the book. Liam Neeson plays an IRA hit man on Fallon's trail. He is also Fallons best friend and the conflict between the two emotions are played up wonderfully, leading to a violent end. It adds a great suspense to the whole thing.One other exceptional thing about this movie is the score. Bill Conti (of Rocky fame) really captures the mood throughout. Great music!Overall, I liked this movie. Again, I would have like to see more character development of de Costa and Meehan, but still it's a great plot.",3,Not bad but could have been better.,1031097600,"09 4, 2002",2002,1534,"['Prayer', 'Dying', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'time', 'So', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'watching', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'ever', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'book', 'one', ""n't"", 'However', 'own', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'flick', 'plot', 'book', 'well', 'taking', 'ex-IRA', 'executioner', 'fugitive', 'murderer', 'hero', 'What', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'exception', 'Fallon', 'Micky', 'Rourke', 'people', 'are', 'shallow', 'one', 'dimensional', 'priest', 'Father', 'de', 'Costa', 'play', 'ok', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'never', 'really', 'force', 'was', 'book', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'try', 'save', 'Fallon', 'life', 'violence', 'when', 'book', 'de', 'Costa', 'own', 'past', 'mirrors', 'Fallon', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'villan', 'Meehan', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'part', 'Where', 'Meehan', 'dark', 'sinister', 'VERY', 'complex', 'book', 'here', 'just', 'there', 'little', 'violence', 'in.One', 'best', 'sub-plots', 'movie', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'book', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'IRA', 'hit', 'man', 'Fallon', 'trail', 'also', 'Fallons', 'best', 'friend', 'conflict', 'two', 'emotions', 'are', 'played', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'leading', 'violent', 'end', 'great', 'suspense', 'whole', 'thing.One', 'other', 'exceptional', 'thing', 'movie', 'score', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'Rocky', 'fame', 'really', 'mood', 'Great', 'music', 'Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'Again', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'de', 'Costa', 'Meehan', 'still', 'great', 'plot']",N/A

Consider for a moment that an IRA hitman on the lam for accidently blowing up a schoolbus is contracted for one more hit to obtain papers to escape to America.  The hit is witnessed by a priest so the hitman confesses his crime to him so that the priest won't talk to the police.  Subsequently, the hitman engages in a romance with the priest's blind niece.  This semi-nonsense is made palatable by an able cast but it's a disappointment coming from a gifted director like Mike Hodges(""Get Carter"", ""Croupier"").

I have always liked Mickey Rourke and I think he is one of the most underrated actors int he business. I never heard of this film before and bought it and not knowing how good it would be. Upon viewing the film I couldn't help thinking how much better this movie could have been. Mickey Rourke gives an absolutly moving performance as a hit man wanting to give up his evil ways. I know that that has been used as a plot for a hundred movies, but this is easily one of the better of those films. Some people Bob Hoskins as miscast int he role of the Priest, but I found him to also give a good performance. Overall I was very moved by the film. I only wish it went a little more in depth with Bob Hoskins character. It gives hints that he and Mickey Rourke's character are much alike, but doesn't go into real depth.

Rourke's accent was almost as funny as Richard Gere's in ""The Jackal."" He was okay, but not great.Maybe this was a good movie in the 80's for that genre, but it was very slow, predictable and filled with stereotypical characterizations of cops and bad guys. Oh, the bad guys were especially terrible in this one (Alan Bates as Jack Meehan). Something like New York cops and bad guys; except Irish. The bumbling and fumbling cops weren't any better.Maybe it's because I like American-Made films better. Granted, that could be the problem with my somewhat biased opinion. But we all know that there have been countless American flops the past years.Then again, I've always admired Liam Neeson's (Liam Docherty) acting in any movie (A small part in this one, compared to Rourke's)- including ""Next Of Kin,"" just two years after this one. Bob Hoskins (Father Da Costa) on the other hand, has never impressed me with his acting, and was especially terrible in ""Enemy At The Gates"" - (2001) as Nikita Kruschev; and in ""Outlaw"" - (2007) as inside police contact Walter Lewis.I'm still going to give it three stars for trying, and because there actually were parts I enjoyed once they picked up the pace (somewhat).
