976508,A8WXLST0944GZ,B000EQ5PTQ,,"[5, 5]","What can I say?  I grew up with this show!I lean toward movies filmed in NYC, but, even though this is television,  this was a ""must have"" as an addition to my collection.Even though all the interiors were shot in Hollywood, the exteriors are still fun, and overall the show seems to capture a true NYC feeling.Growing up in a big family during this era provides me a connection with the characters.Ann Marie reminds me of some of my older sisters that were going through similar women's rights issues, with parents and peers.Marlo Thomas is just so CUTE in this show.  She strikes a wonderful balance between convincing girlfriend, and an independent woman searching for her identity.  The clothes are very hip, cool and stylish for the era.  I don't think I've seen her in the same outfit twice, in all the episodes I've watched so far.Video QualityThe video transfer to this DVD format is very, very good.  I've purchased other more modern sitcoms on DVD (Will & Grace & King of Queens specifically) and the video on those DVD's, seem like a low quality Digital video recording.  Specifically, those are very ""grainy"", and not good on freeze frame, etc.  On ""That Girl"",  that is not an issue. The picture quality and sound are very, very clear.The Extras & the EraWhen I was sharing some memories of the show with one of my sisters, she remembered one episode where Ann Marie ran out of food, for a party, so she used frosted flakes and peanut butter as an hors d'oeuvre.  We of course had to try that, back in the day.  (that episode is not on this series).  That is the kind of good family fun and memories that this show evokes.I've only recently started watching any of the extras on DVD's in general, but this one provides some good insight and history about the show.To hear Marlo Thomas talk about how the show came about, and how it was pitched to TV executives, is really fun.  I think it would be inspiring for any young person today.With all the changes in the media industry today, it's interesting and thought provoking to think about what will be ""the next big thing"",  or what people find interesting, and to look back at this show as ground breaking for its time.Maybe I'm preaching to the choir for someone who might read this far, or who are already very familiar with this show, but this is NOT your 50's or early 60's sitcom.  (Ozzie & Harriet, Leave it to Beaver, etc.)I guess we all have our own era, but I do not relate to those shows, as well as the core of shows like this.  The Brady Bunch, of course, has it's own solid following, and deservedly so.  However, it's been played to DEATH, in syndication.  Lost gems from this era, include ""The Courtship of Eddie's father"", ""The Mod Squad"", and this show.Take it in small bites, to savor this show, and it's memories.",5,A NYC & Late 60's Icon,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,2796,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'lean', 'movies', 'filmed', 'NYC', 'even', 'television', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'addition', 'collection.Even', 'interiors', 'were', 'shot', 'Hollywood', 'exteriors', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'show', 'capture', 'true', 'NYC', 'feeling.Growing', 'up', 'big', 'family', 'era', 'connection', 'characters.Ann', 'Marie', 'older', 'sisters', 'were', 'going', 'similar', 'women', 'rights', 'issues', 'parents', 'peers.Marlo', 'Thomas', 'just', 'so', 'CUTE', 'show', 'wonderful', 'balance', 'convincing', 'girlfriend', 'independent', 'woman', 'searching', 'identity', 'clothes', 'are', 'very', 'hip', 'cool', 'stylish', 'era', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'outfit', 'twice', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'far.Video', 'QualityThe', 'video', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'format', 'very', 'very', 'good', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'other', 'more', 'modern', 'sitcoms', 'DVD', 'Will', 'Grace', 'King', 'Queens', 'specifically', 'video', 'DVD', 'seem', 'low', 'quality', 'Digital', 'video', 'recording', 'Specifically', 'are', 'very', 'grainy', 'not', 'good', 'freeze', 'frame', 'etc', 'Girl', 'not', 'issue', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'clear.The', 'Extras', 'EraWhen', 'was', 'sharing', 'memories', 'show', 'one', 'sisters', 'remembered', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'ran', 'food', 'party', 'used', 'frosted', 'flakes', 'peanut', 'butter', 'hors', ""d'oeuvre"", 'course', 'had', 'try', 'back', 'day', 'episode', 'not', 'series', 'kind', 'good', 'family', 'fun', 'memories', 'show', ""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'extras', 'DVD', 'general', 'one', 'good', 'insight', 'history', 'show.To', 'hear', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'talk', 'how', 'show', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'was', 'pitched', 'TV', 'executives', 'really', 'fun', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'inspiring', 'young', 'person', 'changes', 'media', 'industry', 'today', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'think', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'what', 'people', 'find', 'interesting', 'look', 'back', 'show', 'ground', 'breaking', 'time.Maybe', ""'m"", 'preaching', 'choir', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'read', 'far', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'show', 'NOT', '50', 'early', '60', 'sitcom', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'etc', 'guess', 'have', 'own', 'era', 'do', 'not', 'relate', 'shows', 'as', 'well', 'core', 'shows', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'course', 'own', 'solid', 'following', 'deservedly', 'so', 'However', 'been', 'played', 'DEATH', 'syndication', 'Lost', 'gems', 'era', 'include', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'father', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'show.Take', 'small', 'bites', 'savor', 'show', 'memories']",N/A

Ironic, considering that the 60s was a very turbulent time.However, Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell manage to take the viewer into a make-believe world that is happy and where all problems are solved by the end of the 1/2 hour journey.Thomas looks great with her hair-flip, designer clothes, and perfect makeup (including those lashes) and Bessell is great as the nerdy, but cute, boyfriend.This show is also the first tv show, I've seen, that actually uses real exterior shots of New York, even though interior shots were filmed in California (at Desilu studios). So every time the characters go from an apartment or office to another location, the viewer actually sees the characters walking on New York streets going to their destination. That little touch adds to the believability that the characters really do live in Manhattan, but it must have been a logistical nightmare to film.But enough about them and more on the dvds themselves. I did notice some audio clicks on episode #4, the last episode on disc 1, which probably had something to do with the original audio track. The problem might be with my set, but if it isn't, the noise isn't so bad that it distracts the viewer from the show. Just noticeable.And for those of you who remember that great opening sequence with the character Anne Marie running with the ""That Girl"" kite, and waving to the mannequin/model that looks exactly like her, that's not on this set. According to Thomas that sequence was not added until the second season.Extras include two featurettes, the original pilot episode, and tv promos.

The character of Don was, for the most part, a very calm, composed influence on the show. He seldom got flustered in the face of Ann's occasional hysterics or her father's often stern disapproval. Despite the 'character of his character', he was no straight man. Each episode has several intelligent witticisms or truly amusing wry comments from Don.The series stayed remarkably consistent through the entire run, in my opinion never 'jumping the shark', as so many long running sitcoms are prone to do.Don and Ann set a good example for a mature and caring relationship, even in the face of comedy script episodes and antics.Highly recommended.",4,One of the rare 'bright' comedies,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,886,"['Girl', '60s', 'sitcom', 'up', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'when', 'viewed', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'later.Altho', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'most', 'zaniness', 'sitcoms', 'often', 'seek', 'provide', 'favorite', 'role', 'was', 'actually', 'Ted', 'Bessel', 'Don', 'Hollinger', 'character', 'Don', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'calm', 'composed', 'influence', 'show', 'seldom', 'got', 'flustered', 'face', 'Ann', 'occasional', 'hysterics', 'father', 'often', 'stern', 'disapproval', ""'character"", 'character', 'was', 'straight', 'man', 'episode', 'several', 'intelligent', 'witticisms', 'truly', 'amusing', 'wry', 'comments', 'Don.The', 'series', 'stayed', 'remarkably', 'consistent', 'entire', 'run', 'opinion', 'never', ""'jumping"", 'shark', 'so', 'many', 'long', 'running', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'prone', 'do.Don', 'Ann', 'set', 'good', 'example', 'mature', 'caring', 'relationship', 'even', 'face', 'comedy', 'script', 'episodes', 'antics.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
976514,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000EQ5PTQ,Byron Kolln,"[3, 3]","Long before Mary Tyler Moore and Ally McBeal, audiences were enchanted by the story of Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas), who travels from small-town Brewster to the bright lights of New York.  Armed with Broadway dreams and faithful boyfriend Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), Ann's adventures mainly concerned her various attempts to break into showbusiness.  Never before on television had audiences seen a girl making a life for herself - by herself - and making a success of it.  THAT GIRL certainly paved the way for ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Ally McBeal"", with it's depiction of a girl's struggle for independence.Marlo Thomas recruited the acclaimed writers of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, to oversee all the scripts for the show; and when ABC network execs wouldn't guarantee the programme past it's debut season, Thomas formed Daisy Productions and bankrolled the entire series.  THAT GIRL was a firm ratings winner during it's inaugeral season, but it wasn't until the show replaced ""Love on a Rooftop"" in the lucrative Thursday night line-up with ""Bewitched"" and ""The Flying Nun"" that it became one of the ABC network's top performers.With her pert and perky demeanour, Marlo Thomas is adorable as Ann Marie, and her performance largely makes the series what it is.  I can't imagine THAT GIRL being nearly as entertaining without her, and this was her first big break.  Likewise, Ted Bessell is just about perfect as Donald.  Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp add good gravity as Ann's well-meaning parents.  Bonnie Scott plays Ann's helpful next-door neighbour Judy Bessemer.Shout! Factory has now released the premiere season of THAT GIRL in this great 5-disc set, complete with brand-new interview segments with Marlo Thomas and the series creators.  Also included is the rare original Pilot Episode, which featured many differences to the characters.  Ted Bessell plays Don Blue Sky, Ann's somewhat-unsavoury agent/boyfriend (a jarring contrast to the affable, gentle Donald he would later play in the series proper).COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There"" - Struggling actress Ann Marie meets her future boyfriend Donald Hollinger when he accidentally kidnaps her from the set of a commercial.

I would say that women would enjoy it more than men, but even my husband got tickled at a few lines he would walk in on.  The show is so refreshing.  &#34;Anne&#34; and the other characters are fervent in their patriotism, respect for others, love, doing the right thing just because it's the right thing to do, work ethic - values that seem to be deteriorating today.  The cast and sets are GREAT; the story lines are cute and funny.  I LOVE seeing Anne's now-vintage clothes and jewelry!  The sound, picture quality and packaging are GREAT.  I own all 5 seasons, watched the whole series twice and can assure you that at some point, I'll watch the whole series again.  It's truly a 5-Star purchase.  And BTW - since you have to buy each season separately, I'll post this same review for all five.

976519,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B000EQ5PTQ,David Von Pein,"[10, 12]","""That Girl"", starring Marlo Thomas, is a very welcome addition to the growing list of 1960s television titles now available on DVD. And Shout Factory has given this funny TV sitcom the treatment it deserves on Digital Disc, by releasing Season One of ""That Girl"" in its entirety and with some pretty nice bonus features as well.""That Girl"" had a successful five-year run on network television from 1966 to 1971, with 136 episodes being produced in those five seasons. The first 30 of those shows are presented in top-notch video quality within this 5-Disc boxed set. These color shows look gorgeous here. I can't see any video deterioration at all. Excellent DVD transfers.The video for these shows is in the original TV screen shape of 1.33:1 (Full Frame); while a warm and well-balanced Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack has been used for each episode. No subtitles are included, however.The rarely-seen 1965 Pilot episode for ""That Girl"" is also along for this DVD ride too. A nice bonus item indeed, as we get to see the genesis of the series, with different actors playing various roles in the cast. So, with the Pilot included as an add-on bonus, it really amounts to a total of 31 full-length episodes being presented in this collection.The video and audio for the Pilot show, however, are not quite as sterling as the other episodes in the set, but the Pilot PQ certainly isn't terrible either. The colors are slightly bleached-out and the 2.0 DD Mono audio has some background hiss in it. But it's still a fun addition to this collection. I had never seen the Pilot before.""That Girl"" star (and producer) Marlo Thomas just seems perfect for the lead role of ""Ann Marie"", a struggling New York actress with a penchant for finding trouble (or maybe it's trouble that finds her). Either way, Marlo is ideally suited for her part as Ann in this series, and she never fails to make the most of an unusual predicament or funny situation (like when she manages to get a bowling ball stuck on her toe).Now I'm not positive, but I've got to believe that that episode featuring Ann Marie's toe getting itself nestled inside a bowling ball (cleverly titled ""This Little Piggy Had A Ball"") was taken directly from a similar embarrassing dilemma that faced ""Laura Petrie"" on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" just a year or two earlier (the episode which had Laura accidentally getting her big toe stuck in a bath spout in a fancy hotel).Bill Persky and Sam Denoff were the co-creators of ""That Girl"", and both of those talented executives also worked on the Van Dyke series. (No wonder both shows are so darn good.)Two other actors in the cast of ""TG"" also receive my accolades for being ""perfectly cast for their roles"" -- Ted Bessell (as Marlo's boyfriend ""Donald Hollinger"") .... and Lew Parker (as Ann Marie's father).From the very first regular episode (which has a title I just love -- ""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There""), a true bond and chemistry can be felt between Ann and Don. It was a wise decision to keep Ted Bessell in the cast -- and to change his character. (He was originally cast in a slightly-different role in the Pilot episode.)And Lew Parker couldn't be any more perfect as Ann's always-worried and usually-exasperated dad. Every scene he appears in is a winner in my book. His gruff (but still caring) persona makes for many funny moments throughout the duration of the series. I'd go so far as to say that Lew Parker, as ""Lou Marie"", was one of the best ""fathers"" ever cast for a TV show -- ever.There are many excellent and laugh-out-loud episodes located within this rookie ""That Girl"" season (1966-1967), including an episode which features the always-hilarious Paul Lynde (which surprised me, because I'd forgotten that Paul had guest-starred in this TV series; so his presence in this first season makes this set just THAT much more desirable, IMO).""That Girl Season One"" features many familiar (and soon-to-be-familiar) faces among the list of regular performers on the show or in guest-starring roles. Such as: Ruth Buzzi, Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, Ronnie Schell, Sally Kellerman, Carroll O'Connor, Teri Garr, Billy De Wolfe, Dabney Coleman, Bernie Kopell, Reta Shaw, Paul Lynde, Jackie Joseph, Billy Gray, George Carlin, John Fiedler, Sterling Holloway, and Jerry Van Dyke.** = Not half-bad, eh? Richard Dreyfuss, by the by, was a mere 19 years of age when he put in his ""TG"" appearance as a waiter in the episode ""Paper Hats And Everything"".----------------------LET'S TALK ""BONUSES"":In addition to the Pilot episode, other bonus items that pop up in this classy DVD set include.......>> Audio Commentary Tracks for four episodes. .... Participating in these commentaries are Marlo Thomas herself, along with series' executive Bill Persky. Fun stuff here for sure.>> ""The Creation Of That Girl"" -- A documentary featurette (with Marlo Thomas hosting). .... This 24-minute bonus is very nice. Via Marlo's own narration and a recent on-camera interview (and, man, she sure looks good still), the history of ""That Girl"" is told. Some behind-the-scenes still photos are also shown here, plus clips from various episodes, and an interesting video clip of some ""hairdo"" test footage of Marlo. (The ""flip"" hair style sure made a difference in her overall looks....just check out the alternate hair styles shown in this featurette to see what I mean.)>> ""That Girl In New York"" (with Marlo Thomas and Bill Persky narrating). .... This 9-minute bonus is just fabulous. It contains behind-the-scenes and outtake footage that was shot in August and October of 1966 (per the clapboards that can be seen throughout this segment), as the ""That Girl"" cast and crew go about filming exterior shots on the streets of New York City -- some of them used for the opening title sequence and others used within the episodes themselves. Some great archival stuff here.And be sure to take note of one of the outtakes shot for the famous ""bowling ball"" episode, which has Ted Bessell helping the ""handicapped"" Marlo Thomas into a cab on a New York street. This clip then shows a pedestrian pretending to kick Ted in the rear end as Ted is bent over, leaning into the back seat of the taxi, helping Marlo. A pretty funny moment. (I wonder if that man even knew who the person was who was tied to a bowling ball on the streets of New York? According to Marlo herself in this piece, apparently the people walking on the street did not know a camera crew was filming a TV scene.)Another humorous moment during these NYC shots is when Ted tries to open a car door for Marlo...but the door is locked; and Ted has to run all the way around to the driver's side of the car (a gorgeous Ford Mustang btw) and open the door for Ann/Marlo. (That footage might have actually been left in the finished episode; I'm not quite sure.)>> Original ABC-TV Promo Spots for ""That Girl"". .... We're treated to two separate TV ads, promoting TG. Each spot lasts exactly one minute. The video isn't pristine here, but that's of little importance IMO, because these are highly-enjoyable and rarely-seen tidbits.There is also a ""Play All"" option on the ""Bonus"" Menu, so that all of the extra features (starting with the Pilot episode) can be watched without having to return to the Menu screen (not including the Audio Commentaries for individual episodes, that is).----------------------THE PACKAGING & THE MENUS:The DVD packaging for this 5-Disc set brims over with a rainbow of color. It's fun, perky, and full of energy (much like Marlo Thomas/""That Girl"" herself). This entire DVD package is very eye-appealing and reminds me of a roll of Five-Flavors ""Life Savers"" candy whenever I see it or open it up. :)The five discs come in a folding Digipak type of case, and there's a nicely-done 8-page booklet accompanying this set as well (which is also quite colorful in design). The booklet provides some very interesting background information on the series (which was originally going to be called ""Miss Independence"") and also has a listing of all 30 episodes contained in the set, with brief show descriptions and first-run airdates. Episode titles and airdates are also provided on two of the Digipak box flaps.""Shout"" has also been kind enough to provide an outer slipcase carton for this set (a packaging item that ""Shout"" had not used for previous DVD boxed sets that I have purchased in the past). I was glad to see the addition of the outer box for ""That Girl"". It makes the set seem more ""complete"", and keeps the folding Digipak from springing back open when placed on a shelf.The Menu design for this set also sparkles (and radiates still more bold and bright colors, like the packaging). Menus are partially animated, with the catchy ""That Girl"" theme playing on a looped track.There are Sub-Menus for ""The Episodes"" and ""Bonus Features"" (Disc One has all the bonus items). A ""Play All"" is included. Chapter breaks are integrated into each show as well.----------------------A FINAL PLUG:Anyone who enjoys good, clean, fun 1960s-era TV, and who also appreciates the genuine chemistry that was displayed by the two main characters who starred in this television series (which was very similar in nature to the spark and chemistry that could be found between Rob and Laura Petrie just a few years before on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"") will want to get ahold of ""THAT GIRL -- SEASON ONE"". It's a DVD treat that's worth every penny.",5,"Something To Shout About From ""Shout Factory"" -- ""That Girl"" Season One, In A Great-Looking 5-Disc DVD Set!",1149206400,"06 2,

976522,A1KVF4MKAGF67P,B000EQ5PTQ,Diane L. Mechlinski,"[2, 2]","I was a young child when ""That Girl"" was a sitcom on television. However, I remember it vaguely, from having watched it with my family. I remembered enough about it to want to watch it now, as an adult, to see how I would feel about it at this stage in my life. I am definitely glad that I purchased ""That Girl"" and went down memory lane, watching this show. It is delightful! Marlo Thomas is a definite breath of fresh air and vitality as she portrays Ann Marie. Her energy, enthusiasm for life, her honest approach toward everything is marvelous. Her character (aside from the fashions that were worn during the show's original time) has not gone out-of-style -- not by a long shot! The situations displayed in each episode, the comedy lines and funny story plots are just as funny today as they were back when the episodes aired originally.

The picture and sound quality is great on the episodes.If That Girl was before your time let me refresh your memory. The set includes the pilot episode. In this episode Ann Marie is seen in the big city pursuing her acting career. She is working at a counter when she is spotted by film makers looking for a last minute actress. On her lunch break she decides to look at a desk that is for sale and she crosses paths with a man named Don who is also interested in the desk. They cross paths later in the evening while she is filming a kidnapping scene and he thinks she is being kidnapped for real and he tries to rescue her. Everything works out fine and Ann Marie and Donald become boyfriend and girlfriend.Although That Girl aired in the 1960's, it really opened the door for women sitcom stars. This show was before Mary Tyler Moore and decades before shows like Murphy Brown, Blossom, Ally McBeal, Ellen,Grace Under Fire and Suddenly Susan. The situations that Ann Marie finds herself in our themes that became common in the Hollywood sitcom. Babysitting woes, minor court cases, problems with parents, and much more.This is a really great set and one of the best TV on DVD sets Shout has ever released.

976526,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EQ5PTQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","No one on TV epitomized sunny 1960's-era optimism more than Ann Marie, the lovably determined young actress protagonist of ""That Girl"", the perky ABC sitcom that ran from 1966 to 1971. As played by Marlo Thomas with her then-trademark flip and false eyelashes, Ann was a breathless presence with a high moral code, a doting father, an eternally patient boyfriend in Newsview Magazine writer Donald Hollinger, and for her character's purported lack of solvency, a large Manhattan apartment and an enviably stylish wardrobe. The situation stretched credibility, but the basic concept was sound and for its time, quite groundbreaking for network television by showcasing a single woman out to seek success in the world. What pulled it all together and let it thrive for its five-year run was Thomas herself, who not only starred but produced the show well before such arrangements became the norm. She plays Ann with such unmitigated spirit that one can't help but see why Donald and the rest of the country were so captivated by her. When I was a child, I remember how happy I was when Ann and Donald finally got engaged in the final season.As the primary custodians of vintage television videos, the Shout! Factory has thus far packaged the first three seasons in colorful DVD packages. Over five discs, the thirty episodes of the classic first season are presented along with several worthwhile extras. Throughout the series, you can see several actors before they became famous - Richard Dreyfuss, Carroll O'Connor, Rob Reiner, Teri Garr, George Carlin, Sally Kellerman, even a young Dabney Coleman as Leon, the obstetrician next door. Three episodes are particular favorites of mine. The first, ""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There"" shows how Ann and Donald first meet when she was working the newsstand in his office building. As they both vie for a roll-top desk in an antique furniture store upstairs, she gets hired to play a bound-and-gagged hostage in a TV commercial to be filmed in the lobby, where Donald mistakenly thinks he is witnessing a real crime and attempts to rescue her.The second, ""Anatomy of a Blunder"", follows Ann and Donald as they drive up to Brewster where he will meet her parents for the first time. A bucolic picnic en route leads to a series of disasters for Donald, including a swollen foot after he steps on a bee, a case of hives due to the horseradish Ann uses in her chopped liver sandwiches, a pair of popped-out contact lenses gone missing, and a mud-soaking due mainly to Ann's inability to drive a stick shift. The third highlight is classicI Love Lucy-level hi-jinks when Ann gets her big toe stuck in a bowling ball after reading about someone who bowls with his feet. Much of the success of these shows rests on the slapstick-driven interplay between Thomas and Ted Bessell, who played Donald with pitch-perfect exasperation.The extras should satisfy die-hard fans. First, there is the unaired 1965 pilot in which Ann lands a bit part on a TV show only to be pressured by her agent to change her professional name. Bleached out from age, this show intriguingly has Bessell play her agent and aspiring boyfriend, an unfortunate casting situation stuck at cross purposes and made further idiosyncratic by inexplicably making him part Cherokee (his name in the pilot is ""Donald Blue Sky""). Character actors Harold Gould (later Rhoda's dad and Rose's boyfriend Miles onThe Golden Girls) and Penny Santon play Ann's parents, deemed too ""ethnic"" by research test groups and replaced by the more ""acceptable"" Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp in the series. Second, there is a 2006 interview with Thomas in which she explains the genesis of the series and its significance in the depiction of a woman seeking her own identity. Running nearly half an hour, Thomas is quite engaging, and there are plenty of vintage clips and stills interspersed throughout.Along with series co-creator Bill Persky, Thomas also provides audio commentaries on four of the episodes (including ""Anatomy of a Blunder""). It's as much a nostalgic look for them as it is for the viewer since Thomas admits not recollecting a lot of what was going on during their filming. In fact, they both apologize frequently for the long silences because they are simply enjoying the shows. They jointly provide more insight on a ten-minute outtake reel called ""That Girl in New York"": in which they comment on raw footage shot on location in Manhattan - including the shots used for the opening credits sequence. By the way, the more famous opening, with the train tracks, the pink kite with her face, the look-alike mannequin and the tousled hair, did not turn up until the second season. Rounding out the extras is a couple of vintage promos (replete with groovy music accompaniment) produced by ABC at the time.I had not seen ""That Girl"" in nearly a quarter-century, but what strikes me now is how fresh the show still is despite the 1960's fashions and sensibilities. Much of the credit has to go to Persky and his partner Sam Denoff, writing veterans ofThe Dick Van Dyke Show, who intentionally avoided most topical references in favor of timeless situations to which anyone can relate. Moreover, there is genuine chemistry between Thomas and Bessell that obviously mimics the opposites-attract personalities of the young marrieds in Neil Simon's then-popularBarefoot in the Park. If you are a baby boomer who was addicted to primetime TV like I was in the 1960's, this one will definitely tickle you to no end.",5,Baby Boomer Heaven Found in the Comic Adventures of Struggling

However, I decided to give it a try when it was re-released on DVD, and haven't regretted it.Marlo Thomas plays Ann, a young actress hopeful who moves to New York City to seek her future -- a sort of Mary Richards persona, a decade before she was made popular by Mary Tyler Moore. While she awaits fame and fortune, Ann often works as a waitress and a store clerk, both of which she does with as much charm and vivacity as everything else in her life.Under the most unusual circumstances, Ann meets Don Hollinger, a journalist who ends up her boyfriend. Together, the bright and perky Ann and the practical, quiet Don make quite a satisfying team, undergoing the usual hijinks, but also some endearing moments.Memorable episodes of Season 1 include ""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There,"" where Don stumbles upon Ann tied up in an apparent hostage situation at work, unaware that she is filming; ""Anatomy of a Blunder,"" where the couple sets off for Don to meet Ann's parents for the first time, and every possible disaster befalls the poor man along the way; and ""Phantom of the Horse Opera,"" where Ann and Don track down a strange and mysterious neighbor who plays an organ at odd hours.This is a fun, quirky series that is guaranteed to make a loyal viewer out of you in no time...",4,Timeless comedy,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,1326,"['27', 'series', 'obviously', 'predated', 'However', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'when', 'was', 're-released', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'it.Marlo', 'Thomas', 'Ann', 'young', 'actress', 'hopeful', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'seek', 'future', 'sort', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'persona', 'decade', 'was', 'made', 'popular', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Ann', 'often', 'waitress', 'store', 'clerk', 'as', 'much', 'charm', 'vivacity', 'everything', 'else', 'life.Under', 'most', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'Ann', 'Don', 'Hollinger', 'journalist', 'who', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'Together', 'bright', 'perky', 'Ann', 'practical', 'quiet', 'Don', 'make', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'team', 'undergoing', 'usual', 'hijinks', 'also', 'endearing', 'moments.Memorable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Just', 'Do', 'Something', 'Stand', 'where', 'Don', 'Ann', 'tied', 'up', 'apparent', 'hostage', 'situation', 'work', 'unaware', 'filming', 'Anatomy', 'Blunder', 'where', 'couple', 'off', 'Don', 'meet', 'Ann', 'parents', 'first', 'time', 'possible', 'disaster', 'poor', 'man', 'way', 'Phantom', 'Horse', 'Opera', 'where', 'Ann', 'Don', 'track', 'down', 'strange', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'who', 'organ', 'odd', 'hours.This', 'fun', 'quirky', 'series', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'loyal', 'viewer', 'time']",N/A

Like I said, I was only six but I knew a beautiful lady when I saw one and she was definitely beautiful. Little did I know I was forming a lifelong passion for brunettes.When you watch this show now it was so hokey and so corny, but I think that's what makes it so endearing, just this gentle, sweet innocence going on and there wasn't too much innocence going on in the sixties. People were ripping the blinders off their eyes and seeing things not only as they were, but as they could be. Despite all the bloodshed, the rebellion, the anger, I think the sixties were a very pivotal point in not only the history of the United States, but the whole world. People began to really tune into life at this time. People began to understand that the individual plays a HUGE ROLE in the transformation of the world. But if you asked my dad about the 60s, he'll just say it was all about ""dirty, stinky hippies in dire need of a shower."" That could be true, too...But anyway, back to our program...this was a great and wonderful show about a girl struggling to be her own woman...her own person...that in itself is a wonderful premise. Like Shakespeare once said, ""To thine ownself be true...."" We must learn to be true to ourselves, to our ideals, to our values so we can look at those naysayers in the face and say proudly, ""I may fall 1,000 times, but I will still get up...""The 60s were all about the empowerment of the individual. What happened? Now everyone wants to be the same. It's like we have become too conformed to life...too prepackaged...I go to the mall and everyone wants to look like Brittney Spears or Paris Hilton...those girls are role models?Excuse me while I barf...Marlo Thomas was a role model for women 40 years ago and she is still a role model for women...and she is still just as beautiful if not more so. Maybe what this country needs is a good war...yeah, that'll stir things up a bit...oh, wait...sorry...scratch that...maybe what we need are more people who are willing not only to exude passionate individualism, but also sweet and gentle transfomation, as well.Great Show.

976539,A1B8HI3VREI1H3,B000EQ5PTQ,Jorge A. Zarco,"[1, 2]","In the early 1960's, Marlo Thomas acted in a TV pilot called Two's Company. The ABC Network didn't like the pilot, but they did like Marlo Thomas. They gave Thomas the green light to act in That Girl. In the original That Girl pilot, Donald was Ann Marie's agent and part Native American. Also, Ann Marie's parents were very ""old fashioned"". Footage from the unaired That Girl pilot was recycled in the episode What's in a Name? The ""first episode"" of That Girl debuted in 1966. Ann Marie meets Donald(Ted Bessell) for the first time. They fight over who gets to buy a desk. In That Girl(1966-1971), Marlo Thomas played Ann Marie, a working class, single woman who dreams of being an actress. The late Ted Bessell played Donald, Ann's mild mannered boyfriend who works as a writer for a magazine. That Girl was a product of the 1960's. There's mod fashions mixed with older technology. Donald comments in one episode that ""UNIVAC wouldn't understand"". UNIVAC was a computer program used in the 1960's. That Girl was made before cable TV, Iphones, cell phones, and the internet. The show was made when there were only three major networks on UHF TV. That Girl is still entertaining decades down the road. The chemistry between Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell was the show's strongest redeeming factor. The humor on the show was hit and miss. That Girl has a tacked on laugh track, but it also has slick production values. This Shout Factory DVD set for season one(1966-1967) of That Girl is a solid package. It has featurettes and ABC TV spots from the 1960's. The unaired That Girl pilot from 1965 is an extra. There's also Shout Factory video spots for The Electric Company, America's Funniest Home Videos, The Dick Cavett Show and All American Girl. Marlo Thomas guest starred on My Favorite Martian as a mild mannered, bookish woman. My Favorite Martian cast member Bill Bixby guest starred on a That Girl episode as ""Harry Banner"".In That Girl, Ann Marie wears chic, stylish clothes that she could not afford on her salary. That Girl is a larger than life show that takes place in fiction. It's fun, lightweight entertainment. At one time, That Girl was known as ""Miss Independence"", one of Marlo Thomas' nicknames.  Thomas acted in a 1977 TV remake of It's a Wonderful Life(1946) called It Happened One Christmas(1977).Everything from SNL to Animaniacs to The Nanny has spoofed or paid homage to That Girl. On a Simpsons episode, Marge Simpson said something about wanting to marry Ted Bessell. There are many classic That Girl episodes. Remember the episode where Ann Marie's toe got stuck in a bowling ball? There's an episode where Ann and Donald endure a series of mishaps at a picnic.There's an episode where an English photographer has a crush on Ann. George Carlin, Terri Garr, Jackie Joseph, Dabney Coleman, Danny Thomas, Sally Kellerman and many others made guest appearances on That Girl.

Her first apartment, her first real love (Donald - played by the adorable Ted Bessell), her first acting job...she does it all with zest and gusto.

The episodes follow Ann as she meets Donald, starts their dating relationship, goes on auditions, takes acting classes and wards off trouble from her overbearing father (played by Lew Parker).  Look for great regulars and guest stars - Rosemary DeCamp (Ann's mother), Dabney Coleman, Bernie Kopell, Jackie Joseph, Sally Kellerman, Teri Garr, Rob Reiner, Billy De Wolfe, George Carlin and Arlene Golonka.Extras include:  commentary on certain episodes (the commentary isn't particularly interesting), a feature called ""That Show...That Woman...The Creation of That Girl,"" which is fun to watch.I highly recommend this cute romp through 1966 with Ann Marie & Donald.

Marlo, already self-aware and wanting to portray a woman who was single, independent and living on her own.  The result was one of the finest comedies in television history.  Marlo and co-star Ted Bessell had a terrific on-screen chemistry.  I used to watch the show during it's original run (I would have been 7 - 12 years old depending on which season we are talking about).  I remember being fascinated with ANN MARIE, but I really didn't like Lew.  He scared me.  But all in all, the ensemble and the show's creators and writers made television magic.  It occurs to me that the show harkens back to a more ""civil"" time in American history.My only complaint about the DVD is that there are no subtitles available.

976563,ABX3704SXNU5F,B000EQ5PTQ,"Toni ""the bookworm""","[9, 10]","........to quote our young ""Miss Independence""!! That was the original title that Ms. Thomas had suggested since that was what her father would call her. But ""That Girl"" got it instead and it just seems to fit.What a great return to the 60's! Just to see the New York skyline, the sights, the sounds, the great clothes that Ann wore (isn't it amazing how incredilbly chic she was on the salary she had; all of them still classics!). To watch her move from her parents home to her own flat in the Big Apple (which changed from a cute compact place to a more spacious dig within the next season; who wouldn't have loved to live there?).And of course her wonderful BF, Donald Hollinger. The situations that they both got into, all as they cemented the relationship of their two characters. Back then, that's what every girl wanted-------her very own Donald; Ted Bessell was and will be the real first ""Donald"" in New York.This wonderful new DVD comes to us in a 5-disc set that looks like a fold-out book; the paper insert has the cartoon skyline of New York with a kite running across it, taken from the kite scene from a later show opening; the discs are nestled securely inside each clip. And of course, you have the ""That Girl"" caricature that everyone knows no matter where you go.I was amazed at the young stars that were just up and coming: a VERY young Dabney Coleman, Rob Reiner, Teri Garr, Bernie Kopell, etc. You look at how their stars rose and shined even brighter since their appearance on the show.Aside from all the great first season episodes, there is also a booklet enclosed within the set that gives an overview of what you will find on these discs. They are priceless because you enjoy seeing Ms. Thomas giving a recent recorded interview explaining all the insights and details of how ""That Girl"" was created. I was just enthralled with how she became, at the young age of about 22 years old, only the second female producer in Hollywood; she took responsibility for the show. Way to go Marlo. She also speaks about how she was able to get Bill Persky and Sam Denoff to come over from ""The Dick Van Dyke"" show to help write ""That Girl"".Then she speaks about the cast. The love and respect that she had for Ted Bessell was very touching; you can tell how much he is missed. Originally he was to play her agent/boyfriend, with a totally different name, but they decided that combination didn't work well, though the chemistry between the ""Ann and Donald"" was cemented, so they made him boyfriend/journalist and Ronnie Schell got the part as her agent.She also speaks of Lew Parker who plays her father, and Rosemary De Camp as her mother, and how they came to be casted; her respect for them is touching. One of the bonuses within this set is the ""That Girl"" pilot that had a very young Harold Gould play her father originally. Apparently the parents in the pilot were a bit too ""ethnic"" and old-fashioned, and they felt that they needed to make them a bit more approachable to the 60's mentality of women being able to make it on their own. So in came Parker and De Camp. The bonuses within this set are priceless. You even get ""commentaries"" on certain episodes.My social commentary: My one disappointment with the series back then , and today, is that ""Ann and Donald"" never married. They were engaged but never married on the show. As a little girl, we were really disappointed. As adults, you're hopefully over it. But then I read a comment that made me understand why Ms. Thomas chose not to have them get married, and that's what disappoints me now. The DVD booklet that is enclosed has an excerpt from Stephen Cole, who wrote a book called ""That Book About That Girl"". In it he states that Ms. Thomas didn't want to leave them (audience) with the belief that marriage was the only happy ending. I couldn't disagree more. The point of the series was to show that it was possible to enjoy a career and still be happy with a personal life; something that up to then, was not the norm for women. Responsibly entering into marriage with the mutual kindness and respect that are crucial to it's life, as her show characters displayed, would have given a solid way of wrapping up all the statements that Ms. Thomas was trying to make during those past 5 years. To claim that marriage would ruin or alter that ability, was disappointing. OK........I can just hear the collective moans, see the eyes rolling, and feel that mouse going to the ""no"" button.

976564,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000EQ5PTQ,trebe,"[0, 1]","The turbulent sixties were a time of great change, and while television reflected this in some respects, in many ways, the networks were very conservative, when it came to social issues like feminism.  It may not seem very significant now, but That Girl (1966-71), a series about a single woman, attempting to pursue a career as an actress, was something quite new and fresh.  Marlo Thomas is delightful as Ann Marie, a young woman from Brewster, New York, who despite the concerns of her loving parents, has moved to New York City, to try and realize her dreams.The daughter of entertainment legend Danny Thomas (Make Room For Daddy), Marlo Thomas seems to have inherited her father's sense of comic timing.  Thomas' bubbly personality, gorgeous looks, girl next door appeal, signature hairstyle, and stylish wardrobe, serve her very well, as she came to represent the dreams and aspirations, of a new generation of American women.  The epitome of sweetness and innocence, Thomas was simply adorable, with an appeal to both sexes.In living on her own, ""Miss Independence"" (Ann) achieved a lot, but she had the support from her family, friends, and dreamy boyfriend Don Hollinger (Ted Bessell), a writer for Newsview magazine.  Thomas and Bessell were simply magic together, and for the series' five year run, they were arguably the perfect TV couple.  Although sex was out of the question, their relationship continued to evolve, in what was a wonderful storybook romance.  While contemporariesGet Smart, andI Dream of Jeannie, completed their five year runs with the lead characters getting married, Don and Ann never tied the knot.Very much a ""daddy's girl"", the other man in Ann's life was her very opinionated father Lou Marie, who was played with a twinkle in his eye, by the marvelous Lew Parker.  Rosemary De Camp played Ann's loving mother Helen.  Other supporting characters included Bonnie Scott as Ann's neighbor Judy, Dabney Coleman, as Judy's husband Leon, and Bernie Kopell (Get Smart, The Love Boat) as Don's coworker Jerry Bauman.The first season features some outstanding stories, as Ann and Don are quickly established as a couple devoted to each other.  The series gets off to a fabulous start in the premiere episode ""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There"", where Don meets Ann, who is working at a newsstand in the lobby of his office building.  They become better acquainted, when they both try to buy the same desk.  By the time Don (""Captain Dumb Dumb"") interferes while Ann is shooting a commercial, a truly wonderful romance has begun.""Anatomy of a Bunder"" is an all time classic episode.  While on their way to Ann's parent's home in Brewster, the couple stop for a picnic lunch.  Don suffers through a series of terrible misfortunes that would have broken the spirit of a much lesser man.  Carroll O'Connor guests as a temperamental opera singer in ""A Tenor's Loving Care"".  Don wants to interview the singer, but he will only allow Ann to be in his presence.""Rain, Snow, and Rice"" explores what would become a reoccurring and ""risqu&eacute;"" topic, room accommodations at a hotel, as Ann and Don spend the night in the same room, so that their newlywed friends can be together on their wedding night.  Matters become more complicated, when Ann's irate father arrives on the scene.  Another memorable episode is ""This Little Piggy Had a Ball"", where Ann gets a bowling ball stuck on her big toe, just before an appearance at an awards ceremony.That Girl broke new ground on television, expanded awareness of feminism, and opened the door for further progress.  Behaving with style and class, Ann Marie was someone that had never been seen before.  About the only thing that didn't quite fit, was that Ann Marie was supposedly in her early 20's, but Thomas was nearly 29 when the series began.While there are many warm and hilarious moments, the challenge of coming up with great material for 30 episodes was not always met, as the series struggled to find writers, and establish an identity.  This situation was eventually addressed, and the second season of That Girl is absolutely fabulous, with better stories, and a regular set of writers.The five disc Shout Factory release is very impressive, with striking image quality, at a time when color had just become the new standard.  Thomas' wardrobe was furnished by Cardinali in Hollywood, and she looks fabulous in bright, saturated colors.  Sadly there are no subtitles, but the bonus materials are solid, and include a featurette about the historical significance of That Girl.  Marlo Thomas and co-creator Bill Persky, provide commentary on four episodes.  Although they have not prepared at all, it is still nice to hear Ms. Thomas (currently Mrs. Phil Donohue) speak.Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell (1935-91) are simply a joy to watch, in this wonderful program, that embodies the innocence of mid-60's television.  If you are a romantic, you can't help but love these characters.  That Girl is the first link in the chain, that would extend to programs like Julia (1968-71) (when is this groundbreaker going to be released on DVD?),The Mary Tyler Moore Show(1970-77), andMaude(1972-78).",5,"marlo thomas, bravely brings feminism to prime time...",1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,5170,"['turbulent', 'sixties', 'were', 'time', 'great', 'change', 'television', 'reflected',

976565,AI7KBBGYYCFX6,B000EQ5PTQ,W. Budris,"[5, 6]","Absolutely adore Disc 1 (all I've watched so far), because I wanted to see all the bonus features.  The first season with the ""Starring Marlo Thomas"" street signs and the perky version of the That Girl theme (opening and closing credits) have been my favorite.  Marlo mentions in the commentary with Bill Persky during the New York shooting feature that the second season is when they changed to the railroad tracks into NYC, the kite and a different version of the theme (credits then remained the same, even when Marlo's look changed in the last season & lyrics were added to the theme).  I thought the perky theme remained for two seasons, where in the second year, Marlo was helping a child get a drink at a water fountain in the park vs. walking in the blue suit to the office building.  I could be wrong.We didn't get into That Girl in our house until probably summer reruns the first year.  My parents didn't like Marlo's character, but my sister did, as did I.  We all loved Bewitched, but we finally added That Girl to that hour of comedy on ABC we would all watch.  I never saw the end of the series, so looking forward to when Shout Factory finally gets to Season 5.  Looking forward to all the in-between as well, as picture quality and sound quality are superb.  Even the Pilot Episode looks incredible compared to when it aired on TV Land the first time.Great treat are some scenes of Marlo's make-up tests when she reflects on the show's creation, the cast and memories.  The look finally came to be to the Ann Marie we've loved all these years.  The That Girl In New York bonus feature is also a great pictoral history of NYC from the 60s era.

The color scheme, audio/video quality, box durability, single sided discs, commentaries, extras; truly, for what I paid ($19.99!) I simply cannot believe how well made this set is. If more sets were made with this extreme love I certainly would buy many more. This set does have some history for me; I sold my Frasier boxsets and picked up - The Brady Bunch Seasons 4 and 5, Remington Steele Season 3, Adam 12 Season One, and That Girl which was my ''wild card'' seeing as I had $20 left to spend from my Frasier auction. In hindsight, this may be the best selection!The Show:I'm sure since I was born in sixty-eight I must have seen SOME of these episodes, but I truly do not remember this show. Maybe that makes it even sweeter? Because it is well written, well acted, and the humor has serveral layers. Ann and Don are instantly likeable! Ann is so beautiful sometimes it's hard to follow the show! Her smile, her laugh, her innocense is really refreshing. Also, the way they introduce a show with the line, ""That Girl"" is really far reaching and quite impressive for it's time. I enjoy trying to figure out who and how it will be said, my favorite so far was when there was just a conversation between Ann's mother and father and I was wondering ""Ok, how will they get to the ""That Girl"" phrase? It was done via a picture of Ann! HA!
