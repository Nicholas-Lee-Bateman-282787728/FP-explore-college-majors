1063508,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000OCY7K8,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[7, 28]","I've watched much of Henry's ""spoken word"" (which is really standup comedy, Henry is just being pretentious in calling it ""spoken word""), I've watched this TV show, read many of his interviews (Henry has done a ton of interviews, never saying no to a microphone), and read a bit about him, and I'm not overly impressed.  I don't understand why everyone thinks he's some sort of artistic genius.  He's not terrible, but he is not a man of great depths and profundity.  This TV show is promoted as hip and edgy and ""out there"", but in reality it's a rather standard and placcid show.  The only difference between this show and a late night talk show is that Rollins swears once in a while, and comes across at you at a high decibel level.  That makes him ""edgy"" in the eyes of many.  But if you turn down the volume and actually listen to what he's saying, he never really goes into any too deep, preferring to be on the surface of something and saying obvious things that most of us with brains figured out a long time ago (like ""Bush sucks"" and ""Anne Coulter is a b---"").  Rollins rants on celebrities (even though he's one himself, ableit a minor one), Laura Bush, George W. Bush, Anne Coulter, and Carrot Top (yes, Carrot Top.  I'm not a fan of Carrot Top, but picking on him is so easy and kind of cruel, considering Carrot is a major joke anyway).  While I agree with Rollins on some of his political points, he states his opinions in a very obvious way, and his angry old man stuff gets old very fast.  I actually end up laughing at his ""teeing off"" segments.  It's like a comic wanting people to take him seriously, and people still laugh at him.  Rollins seems to be stuck in a time warp, doing his angry punk thing from the 80's.  He's never grown out of it, and considering he's approaching middle age, this is not a good thing.  When people like Rollins pontificate on their soapboxes, you feel like you're being preached to, and while you may agree with what the preacher is saying, it's just preaching to the choir, and it has no real lasting effect.  This show has some very good guests (the Werner Herzog interview is great, because Werner is a true artist, something that Rollins strives to be, but can't, even though he tries), but it's nothing really special.If I had a choice between watching Leno and Rollins, I would naturally take Rollins, but I don't think Rollins is that phenomenal.  He's not the worst talk show host (or standup/spoken word guy) in the world, but he's not a pinnacle either.",2,"An average show for an average host/standup/""spoken word"" guy....",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2516,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'much', 'Henry', 'spoken', 'word', 'really', 'standup', 'comedy', 'Henry', 'just', 'being', 'pretentious', 'calling', 'spoken', 'word', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'TV', 'show', 'read', 'many', 'interviews', 'Henry', 'done', 'ton', 'interviews', 'never', 'saying', 'microphone', 'read', 'bit', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'impressed', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'everyone', 'sort', 'artistic', 'genius', 'not', 'terrible', 'not', 'man', 'great', 'depths', 'profundity', 'TV', 'show', 'promoted', 'hip', 'edgy', 'there', 'reality', 'rather', 'standard', 'placcid', 'show', 'only', 'difference', 'show', 'late', 'night', 'talk', 'show', 'Rollins', 'once', 'while', 'across', 'high', 'decibel', 'level', 'edgy', 'eyes', 'many', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'actually', 'listen', 'what', 'saying', 'never', 'really', 'too', 'deep', 'preferring', 'be', 'surface', 'something', 'saying', 'obvious', 'things', 'most', 'brains', 'figured', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Bush', 'sucks', 'Anne', 'Coulter', 'b', 'rants', 'celebrities', 'even', 'one', 'minor', 'one', 'Laura', 'Bush', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Anne', 'Coulter', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'yes', 'Carrot', 'Top', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'picking', 'so', 'easy', 'kind', 'cruel', 'considering', 'Carrot', 'major', 'joke', 'anyway', 'agree', 'Rollins', 'political', 'points', 'opinions', 'very', 'obvious', 'way', 'angry', 'old', 'man', 'stuff', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', 'teeing', 'off', 'segments', 'comic', 'wanting', 'people', 'take', 'seriously', 'people', 'still', 'laugh', 'be', 'stuck', 'time', 'warp', 'doing', 'angry', 'punk', 'thing', '80', 'never', 'grown', 'considering', 'approaching', 'middle', 'age', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'When', 'people', 'Rollins', 'pontificate', 'soapboxes', 'feel', ""'re"", 'being', 'preached', 'may', 'agree', 'what', 'preacher', 'saying', 'just', 'preaching', 'choir', 'real', 'lasting', 'effect', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'guests', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'interview', 'great', 'Werner', 'true', 'artist', 'something', 'strives', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'nothing', 'really', 'special.If', 'had', 'choice', 'watching', 'Leno', 'Rollins', 'would', 'naturally', 'take', 'Rollins', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Rollins', 'phenomenal', 'not', 'worst', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'standup/spoken', 'word', 'guy', 'world', 'not', 'pinnacle']",The Henry Rollins Show: Season 1

Rollins has strong opinions but apparently he didn't use any reason and logic to come to them.I agree with many of the ultimate conclusions that Rollins has so I'm not complaining because I don't like his point of view.  It's just that you aren't going to learn anything by watching the show other than maybe how to raise your voice and look angry.,2,"All emotion, no facts",1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,378,"['title', 'really', 'Rollins', 'strong', 'opinions', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'reason', 'logic', 'come', 'them.I', 'agree', 'many', 'ultimate', 'conclusions', 'Rollins', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'point', 'view', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'learn', 'anything', 'watching', 'show', 'other', 'maybe', 'how', 'raise', 'voice', 'look', 'angry']",The Henry Rollins Show: Season 1

Interviews are made up of typical talk show non-questions, the goal being just to get the guest to blather vaguely about something so you have something to air. I hoped and even expected to learn something about the guests. In most cases I didn't. The interviews with both Oliver Stone and Patton Oswalt consist of Rollins and his guest giving each other paranoid anti-bush reacharounds without saying anything substancial, and there are substancial things that could have been said about the topic. His railing against SUVs and other typical left-wing targets sounds like a broken record most of the time, with impassioned vocal delivery, inflammatory adjectives and vilifying nouns standing in for insight and logic. It should also be noted that the majority (possibly all) of the musical acts on this show are either on a major label or on a so-called indie label with a so-called ""distribution deal"" with a major. Way to support the underground scene Henry. I don't mean to be so negative, I mean I did watch the whole thing, even resisted hitting the fast-forward button during P.T. Anderson's sleep-inducing interview, and the skits or whatever that are just Rollins talking to the camera are mostly totally funny, but this show could have been a lot cooler and has lowered my opinion of Rollins.",3,Please enter a title for your review,1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,1446,"['rant', 'how', 'show', 'going', 'grain', 'then', 'proceeds', 'stick', 'as', 'closely', 'possible', 'talk', 'show', 'template', 'Interviews', 'are', 'made', 'typical', 'talk', 'show', 'non-questions', 'goal', 'being', 'just', 'get', 'guest', 'blather', 'vaguely', 'something', 'so', 'have', 'something', 'air', 'hoped', 'even', 'expected', 'learn', 'something', 'guests', 'most', 'cases', 'did', ""n't"", 'interviews', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'consist', 'Rollins', 'guest', 'giving', 'other', 'paranoid', 'anti-bush', 'reacharounds', 'saying', 'anything', 'substancial', 'are', 'substancial', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'topic', 'railing', 'SUVs', 'other', 'typical', 'left-wing', 'targets', 'broken', 'record', 'most', 'time', 'impassioned', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'inflammatory', 'adjectives', 'vilifying', 'nouns', 'standing', 'insight', 'logic', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'majority', 'possibly', 'musical', 'acts', 'show', 'are', 'major', 'label', 'so-called', 'indie', 'label', 'so-called', 'distribution', 'deal', 'major', 'Way', 'support', 'underground', 'scene', 'Henry', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'so', 'negative', 'mean', 'did', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'even', 'resisted', 'hitting', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'sleep-inducing', 'interview', 'skits', 'whatever', 'are', 'just', 'Rollins', 'talking', 'camera', 'are', 'mostly', 'totally', 'funny', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'cooler', 'lowered', 'opinion', 'Rollins']",The Henry Rollins Show: Season 1

Secondly Rollins promised that on this show he would be talking about important subject matter which he does and when interviewing celebrities promises that he will not discuss their love life, private affairs and other banalities which seem to be the order of the day, and again he delivers on that promise, and what's more the interviewees seem to be quite enthusiastic about this, leading to some enjoyable discourse, so if the idea of that makes you yawn because you've seen it all before then fair enough, but for me this material is not prevelant on my TV and so as someone who has watched Bush and co with a sense of foreboding I am grateful to Rollins for reminding me the other side of the coin hasn't been extinguished.",5,Solid half hour jabs at all the BS,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,1093,"['Maybe', 'subscribe', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'owned', 'pay', 'tv', 'enterprise', 'as', 'far', 'material', 'see', 'Rollins', 'show', 'am', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'spoilt', 'choice', 'however', 'wanted', 'hear', 'people', 'rant', 'dangers', 'iran', 'china', 'terror', 'doorstep', 'etc', 'then', 'have', 'plenty', 'keep', 'going', 'first', 'reason', 'show', 'Secondly', 'promised', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'talking', 'important', 'subject', 'matter', 'when', 'interviewing', 'celebrities', 'will', 'not', 'discuss', 'love', 'life', 'private', 'affairs', 'other', 'banalities', 'seem', 'be', 'order', 'day', 'again', 'promise', 'what', 'more', 'interviewees', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'enthusiastic', 'leading', 'enjoyable', 'discourse', 'so', 'idea', 'yawn', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'then', 'fair', 'enough', 'material', 'not', 'prevelant', 'TV', 'so', 'someone', 'who', 'watched', 'Bush', 'co', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'am', 'grateful', 'Rollins', 'reminding', 'other', 'side', 'coin', ""n't"", 'been', 'extinguished']",The Henry Rollins Show: Season 1
