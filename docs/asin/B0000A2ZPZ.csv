I want to disclose at the outset that I couldn't watch the entire DVD and had to turn it off after about an hour, so maybe I missed something profound.  I suffered miserably through the first hour hoping that it would redeem itself, but the principal character is so thoroughly unpleasant, both in the way the part is written and the acting, that it was sheer torture.  The supporting cast was more appealing, but the pace of the film was excruciatingly slow, the attempts at humor repeatedly fell flat, and since nearly all the action took place in the main character's apartment, the result was unrelieved claustrophobia.

761399,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0000A2ZPZ,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","James Kirkwood Jr. (1924-1989) was an prolific writer, probably best known for co-authoring the book of the long-running stage musical A CHORUS LINE.  In the early 1970s Kirkwood wrote P.S. YOUR CAT IS DEAD as a play, and after trying unsuccessfully to place it on stage, in 1972 transformed it into a popular novel, which garned enough attention to get the original play off the ground.  But although the play was remarkably successful in Mexico, and in spite of several notable productions (including one starring Sal Mineo), it remained more of a critic's darling than a popular ticket.In 2002, Steve Guttenberg and Jeff Korn combined the play and novel, which were not identical, to create a film production.  Guttenberg not only co-wrote and directed, but starred as well.  The resulting film received mixed reviews and little box office.  The major complaints were that it was not entirely faithful to either play or novel, that it copped out on the pivitol subject of homosexuality, and that the entire notion of a straight man being shocked by a gay man was extremely dated anyway.  The film went nowhere fast, and these days it tends to turn up in DVD bargain bins.  So it has a very negative reputation--but, in my opinion any way, it's a reputation that is undeserved.  For taken in the right spirit, P.S. YOUR CAT IS DEAD is quite a lot of fun.The basic premise of both play and novel are the same.  Jimmy Zoole (Guttenberg) is an out of work actor who returns home to find that his girlfriend is dumping him, the vet has called to tell him his cat is dead, and there is a cat burglar named Vito hiding under the bed.  In a burst of anger (and one has to wonder if William Mastrosimone saw the play before he wrote Extremities), Jimmy knocks Vito cold, ties him to the kitchen island, and when he awakens Jimmy proceeds to torture him in various comic ways--with a strong emphasis on the word ""comic.""  It transpires that Vito is gay, and when Jimmy's girlfriend returns to check on him, she is shocked to find him apparently involved in an S&M; relationship with another man.  The joke turns Jimmy and Vito into friends, and Jimmy ultimately takes Vito in, adopting the cat burglar just as he had adopted the mangey cat.The problem that most people seem to have with the movie is that it isn't really the play or the book, but a compromise between them.  Perhaps the biggest problem is that it is not set in the 1970s, but is updated, which tends to undercut the story.  It also has more than its share of continuity errors.  The result is much more flyweight than one could wish, but even so it's a fun little thing with attractive performers, a clever script, and a cheerful (if somewhat ambigious) conclusion.  The DVD has nice visual and sound elements and an audio commentary by Guttenberg and company that is more ""isn't it great to get back together!"" than it is actually informative.

The film version of the same is neither.Steve Guttenburg, who both stars and directs this film is to be commended for making a film that most would not bother putting to celluloid.  Unfortunately, he needs someone to provide him with better direction and someone to provide better pacing of the film.The basic premise is that Jimmy Zool is a poor jerk who has just lost his girlfriend, his job, his cat is in the vet, and his apartment has just been robbed - for the 3rd time!  Life can't get much worse can it?  Enter the robber for another return visit.  Caught in the act, the robber is forced to undergo humiliations at the hands of Jimmy.  Eventually the two come to terms with each other and learn to actually not only like each other but realize there may be something more in the offing.Guttenburg plays Jimmy as a sad sack with little or no likable characteristics.  The character is supposed to merely be the victim of a series of bad incidences.  He's feeling pretty low.  Unfortunately, Guttenburg's Jimmy is morose and not likable at all.  Also, he wears this tragically unattractive facial expression throughout most of the film that is supposed to pass for sadness - not an emotion that is one that Jimmy is really dealing with - it's more deeply felt than just that.The fellow who plays the robber is at least refreshing in his role, though I feel that he's playing it a bit too light heartedly. (You see, I've directed the stage version of this play).  This is the role that Sal Mineo was playing at the time of his murder - I doubt that the talented Mineo would have played him quite as flippant on the whole.My last, and probably biggest qualm with this film is that Guttenburg has chosen to avoid the entire subject of the romantic involvement that happens with Jimmy and the Robber.  Heck, they end up in bed together at the end of the play!  This is a subtle piece of characterization that happens as Jimmy realizes that maybe he's been going at things in his life all wrong.  Instead, Guttenburg plays this as though the two men, although one is gay, simply become friends.  Since one of the men is laid face down and naked from the waist down (in the play - not in this film) on the kitchen sink for most of the action, it is doubtful that a simple friendship is all that would come out of this encounter.  It is also doubtful that anything truly meaningful with come of the encounter, but it is likely that somehting poignant and life changing will come of it for Jimmy.  THAT is the message that the play provides.  It is NOT the message that the film gets across.I love this play and the book on which it was based.

For those legions of us who loved both book and Kirkwood's own adaptation as a play, this new film, for all its flaws, conjures up many great memories and many sad elegies.  The film is in the hands of actor/director Steve Gutenberg and his touch is just too heavy handed to do the work justice.  As is often the case, when the main actor is also the director and worse, when the character acted is prone to extremes of behavior, then who is left to tighten the reins on the over all piece?  Gutenberg takes practically the whole movie to make us care and warm to him, so whining, screaming and self-indulgent is his portrayal.  The best part of the film is the very sensitive work of Lombardo Boyar as the burglar.  He manages to touch on almost every aspect of this complicated character and is never less than entertaining and sympathetic.Despite the shortcomings of this film, author Kirkwood still shines as a sensitive observer of the human condition, of the panorama of sexuality, and as master of the short quip.  It is to Gutenberg's credit that he dedicated this film to Kirkwood and to Sal Mineo (both deceased now) who played the burglar in an early form of the play.

Rather than maintain its contemporary 1970 look, Guttenberg's version updates: instead of cold New York City, we have hot L.A. on New Year's Eve. Instead of a crude Italian cat burglar, we have a Latino version. That the changes update, but do not alter the original intent may be testimony to the basic symbols that Kirkwood used in his catty, semi-autobiographical tale. The author also once noted that, once the original is sold to another, the story belongs to them. From that view, Guttenberg has done much that ought to be complimented, esp. the casting of Lombardo Boyer as the burglar. Casting himself as a Woody Allen sort on steroids was not the best move. Jimmy Zoole was meant to be charming and likeable, even under adverse conditions. On stage Keir Dullea conveyed that. As played by Steve Guttenberg, the character of Jimmy Zoole  does not become likeable at all. As a former actor, Jimmy Kirkwood wrote characters that actors could play with elan...and nearly every performer has that chance to shine. Guttenberg is to be commended for finally bringing Kirkwood's story to the screen. The road to becoming a film was cursed; it had so many false starts, including the murder of Sal Mineo who was to direct the original film and star, as he rehearsed the play in Los Angeles. Jim Kirkwood himself intended to direct a film version as late as 1988.

761405,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,B0000A2ZPZ,Phillip Oliver,"[3, 10]","P.S. Your Cat Is Dead is dedicated to the playwright James Kirkwood and the late actor Sal Mineo (who was preparing to open the play in Los Angeles when he was murdered). Kirkwood published his comic play as a novel in the early 70s and it was quite popular and, at the time, very risque. Today, however, it appears quite mild and dated with subjects like bisexuality pass'e.The film, however, doesn't just suffer from being dated - it is badly paced, has terrible continuity problems and is just plain boring. And for a film like this to work, the audience must connect with the characters and care about them. Lombardo Boyer is funny as the burglar but Guttenberg's character comes across as a disheveled ranting and raving lunatic and is irritating beyond belief. It's hard to imagine his ex-girlfriend (Cynthia Watros, who is equally annoying) ever seeing anything in him, much less the burglar! The final scene in the film is well played and we almost get a sense of empahty with the characters but by then, it is too late.Equally awful is the commentary by Guttenberg, actors Boyer and Cynthia Watros and writer Jeff Korn, who all sound like a group of giggling high school kids.
