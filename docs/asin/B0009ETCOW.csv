I wanted a set with a whole bunch of episodes to re-introduce myself to Tales, but I bought the first season first anyway, I figured I'd start from the beginning.Season One offers some really cool ""short films"" from some of Hollywood's biggest producers (Zemeckis, Hill, and Donner), and their style is felt throughout each episode. My personal favorite in this set is ""The Man Who Was Death"" which features William Sadler (of Demon Knight). Other highlights include: ""And All Through the House,"" and ""Dig That Cat...He's Real Gone.""Not only are most of the episodes really cool, but the packaging is really rad too.

More important than pretty much any other comics in there genre, before Ec comics came along the idea of printing a mans face doused in acid or a severed head on a stick on the front of a book on a newsagents shelf was unheard of and it was this fearless approach to horror that Gaines was famous for. Obviously the treatments of these stories are lovingly done, almost perfect in fact. Dig that cat and all through the house are excellent tributes to great horror stories, it's a shame that the fans favourite ' poetic justice ' wasn't included in this season, in fact i don't remember it being filmed at all for the tv series, which is strange considering that tales Infamy.

904196,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0009ETCOW,,"[0, 0]","I never thought it would come out.  I was beginning to lose hope, but with all the rotten tv shows making their way onto dvd nowdays(all those friggin seasons of Buffy, but no Tales???), I figured it would have to come out sometime.  Well, it's here and I'm a happy man!  Most folks have seen an episode or two of Tales(personally I never missed one), and most people seem to like it.  They damn well better, it's Tales From The Crypt!  This was without a doubt, one of the best shows ever put on television, and hands down the best horror show ever.  They were gruesome, funny, clever, campy and because they were on HBO, full of sex, blood and other assorted carnage.  Season 1 is basically a teaser.  It's only 6 episodes.  C'mon!  That's a little under three hours!  Seasons 1 and 2 should have come out in one set, but we all know how the economics work, don't we?  These six aren't the best the series has to offer, but they're awfully good, and bring back lots of memories(for me anyway)  Lots of familiar faces and directors.  In retrospect, it's kinda hard to believe that Robert Zemeckis had anything to do with this show.  If you ask me, ""And All Through The House"" was the best thing he ever directed.  Later series' would get some pretty big stars to participate.  Where else are you gonna see Tom Hanks get a tv smashed on his head, Joe Pesci cut in half with a chainsaw or Christopher Reeve slam Judd Nelson's face down on a grill?  Disc 2 is a 50+ minutes documentary mainly about Bill Gaines, EC comics and the controversy they caused.  Very informative and interesting documentary with imput from John Carpenter and George Romero among others.  Sure it's short, and may not seem worth the money because of that, but I'd suggest buying it so Warner Bros. has the incentive to release them all.

Comics of the 50's that went on to inspire the show on disc two.The episode's of season one:""The Man Who Was Death"" - William Sadler (""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"" & ""Die Hard 2"") stars as an electrician who works at the state pen pulling the switch for the electric chair on death row. When the state decide's to ax the death penalty law, Sadler loses his job & dispenses his own type of lightning fast justice with electrifying results. O.K. first episode that sets the stage for the basic premise of the series.""And All Through The House..."" - An adulterous wife murders her idiot husband on Christmas Eve. But, a homicidal Santa Claws pays a visit with some last minute Xmas chopping to do. Hands down the best episode of the season. It's my personal favorite & arguably the best episode of the entire series. This is the episode that got viewers hooked, and the, now classic, ending feels like its right out of the comic book. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Back To The Future"", ""Forrest Gump"") with Larry Drake (""Dark Night Of The Scarecrow"", ""L.A. Law"") as Santa.""Dig That Cat He's Real Gone"" - Directed by ""Lethal Weapon"" & ""Superman"" auteur Richard Donnor. Joe Pantialano (""Risky Business"", ""The Goonies"" & ""The Sopranos"") is a homeless stumblebum who, after being bribed with a couple of bucks, goes through a bizarre scientific experiment in which the gland of a cat is surgically put into his head. This gland contains the cat's nine lives, & with the operation a success the stumblebum decides to make money off his other lives. But, with money comes fame and all the trappings with it including irresponsibility. In the end the bum is one dumb p***y. Another O.K. episode that has a few decent laughs, with a cameo by Donnor.""Only Sin Deep"" - Lea Thompson (""Back To The Future"", ""Howard The Duck"") stars as a prostitute who sells her beauty for money & romance. But, everything comes with a price & she must learn that beauty is only skin deep, the hard way. Lame episode that has no scares or thrills.""Lover Come Hack To Me"" - A newlywed couple's honeymoon goes awry when a savage thunderstorm gets them lost in the middle of nowhere, making them spend the night in a deserted house. Or are they really lost? The husband plans to off the wife and take her money, but, the wife has other plans in store for her beloved. And how about that mother-in-law... what a real battle ax! Decent episode that's quite gruesome at the end.""Collection Completed"" - M. Emmet Walsh (""Fletch"") stars as a  hardware sales rep. freshly retired & ready to spend his golden years in the house that he payed for with his wife. But, with his goofy wife and her legions of pets roaming around the house, its enought to make a man pick up a new hobby -taxedermy! Another decent episode with a shocking conclusion.The downside of ""Tales"":The problem with this set is that this should have been part of a much larger box set with season two.The episodes aren't remastered and there is some noticable grain throughout the series (these were released on video in 1990 after there intial first run on HBO). What's worse is in 1999 HBO Video released a compilation of Robert Zemeckis' ""Crypt"" episodes on DVD & those looked better than the the episodes presented here.2.0 Dolby (what the f**k?!)The opening main titles aren't even shown. Only the closing credits are shown after each episode. This is retarded. Instead, we are treated to a severly cropped & grainy version of the opening credits at the very beginning of the DVD presentation with a skip intro option at the bottom righthand screen. Very gay & hopefully won't be on season two.The upside of ""Tales"":The packaging is pretty cool & looks like the same way, format wise, as the comic book looked back in the day.The documentary is awesome revealing the history of the comic book. ""Tales From The Crypt"" was the second best selling comic book in the fifties, right behind DC Comics' ""Superman"".Before the series debuted on HBO in 1989, in the early seventies there was a low budget ""Crypt"" movie made starring Joan Collins.""And All Through The House..."" A great episode that, with the documentary, is what makes getting this set all the more worthwhile.With season two due out on October 25th, ""Tales From The Crypt"" is both trick, as well as, treat.",4,"Nothing Like A Good Piece Of ""Tales""",1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,4752,"['Naughty', 'Nice', 'Santa', 'last', 'minute', 'Xmas', 'chopping', 'do', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'entitled', 'House', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'long', 'what', 'seemed', 'eternal', 'rest', 'Home', 'Box', 'Office', 'horror', 'anthology', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'finally', 'DVD', 'debut.This', 'first', 'season', 'collection', 'six', 'episodes', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'great', 'documentary', 'history', 'William', 'Gaines', 'E.C', 'Comics', '50', 'went', 'inspire', 'show', 'disc', 'two.The', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', 'Death', 'William', 'Sadler', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Bogus', 'Journey', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'electrician', 'who', 'state', 'pen', 'pulling', 'switch', 'electric', 'chair', 'death', 'row', 'When', 'state', 'decide', 'ax', 'death', 'penalty', 'law', 'Sadler', 'job', 'own', 'type', 'lightning', 'fast', 'justice', 'electrifying', 'results', 'O.K', 'first', 'episode', 'stage', 'basic', 'premise', 'series', 'House', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'murders', 'idiot', 'husband', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'homicidal', 'Santa', 'Claws', 'visit', 'last', 'minute', 'Xmas', 'chopping', 'do', 'Hands', 'down', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'personal', 'favorite', 'arguably', 'best', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'episode', 'got', 'viewers', 'hooked', 'now', 'classic', 'ending', 'feels', 'right', 'comic', 'book', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Back', 'Future', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Larry', 'Drake', 'Dark', 'Night', 'Scarecrow', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'Santa', 'Dig', 'Cat', 'Real', 'Gone', 'Directed', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Superman', 'auteur', 'Richard', 'Donnor', 'Joe', 'Pantialano', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Goonies', 'Sopranos', 'homeless', 'stumblebum', 'who', 'being', 'bribed', 'couple', 'bucks', 'bizarre', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'gland', 'cat', 'surgically', 'put', 'head', 'gland', 'cat', 'nine', 'lives', 'operation', 'success', 'stumblebum', 'make', 'money', 'other', 'lives', 'money', 'fame', 'trappings', 'including', 'irresponsibility', 'end', 'bum', 'one', 'dumb', 'p***y', 'O.K', 'episode', 'few', 'decent', 'laughs', 'cameo', 'Donnor', 'Only', 'Sin', 'Deep', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Back', 'Future', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'prostitute', 'who', 'beauty', 'money', 'romance', 'everything', 'price', 'must', 'learn', 'beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'hard', 'way', 'Lame', 'episode', 'scares', 'thrills', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Hack', 'Me', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'honeymoon', 'awry', 'when', 'savage', 'thunderstorm', 'lost', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'making', 'spend', 'night', 'deserted', 'house', 'are', 'really', 'lost', 'husband', 'plans', 'wife', 'take', 'money', 'wife', 'other', 'plans', 'store', 'beloved', 'how', 'mother-in-law', 'what', 'real', 'battle', 'ax', 'Decent', 'episode', 'quite', 'gruesome', 'end', 'Collection', 'Completed', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'Fletch', 'hardware', 'sales', 'rep.', 'freshly', 'retired', 'ready', 'spend', 'golden', 'years', 'house', 'payed', 'wife', 'goofy', 'wife', 'legions', 'pets', 'roaming', 'house', 'enought', 'make', 'man', 'up', 'new', 'hobby', '-taxedermy', 'decent', 'episode', 'shocking', 'conclusion.The', 'downside', 'Tales', 'problem', 'set', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'box', 'set', 'season', 'two.The', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'remastered', 'noticable', 'grain', 'series', 'were', 'released', 'video', '1990', 'intial', 'first', 'run', 'HBO', 'What', 'worse', '1999', 'HBO', 'Video', 'released', 'compilation', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Crypt', 'DVD', 'looked', 'better', 'episodes', 'presented', 'here.2.0', 'Dolby', 'what', 'f**k', 'opening', 'main', 'titles', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'shown', 'Only', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'shown', 'episode', 'retarded', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'severly', 'cropped', 'grainy', 'version', 'opening', 'credits', 'very', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'skip', 'intro', 'option', 'bottom', 'righthand', 'screen', 'Very', 'gay', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'season', 'two.The', 'upside', 'Tales', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'cool', 'same', 'way', 'format', 'wise', 'comic', 'book', 'looked', 'back', 'day.The', 'documentary', 'awesome', 'revealing', 'history', 'comic', 'book', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'was', 'second', 'best', 'selling', 'comic', 'book', 'fifties', 'right', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Superman', '.Before', 'series', 'debuted', 'HBO', '1989', 'early', 'seventies', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'Crypt', 'movie', 'made', 'starring', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'House', 'great', 'episode', 'documentary', 'what', 'getting', 'set', 'more', 'worthwhile.With', 'season', 'two', 'due', 'out', 'October', '25th', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'trick', 'as', 'well', 'treat']",Tales from the Crypt: Season 1
904198,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0009ETCOW,,"[0, 0]","Starting back in the late 1980's, HBO had the coolest little show going with ""Tales From The Crypt"". Based on the EC comics from the 1950's, this show had a broad range of styles, all wound up with wonderfully told tales. The show was a half hour genre show that went from the dark and scary, to lighthearted(but bizarre)episodes. A half hour story was told every week, and was introduced by The Crypt Keeper in his, well, crypt. The Crypt Keeper was a rotting corpse(and a puppet)that opened the show with some novel opening act, and then always closed the show. The demented voice of the character was provided by John Kassir(who is married to Julie ""Darla"" Benz of Buffy/Angel fame). The show as I mentioned above, was from the EC comic of the same name, but there were a few others along with it. The Crypt Keeper appeared in them as well. Comics like ""The Vault Of Horror"" and ""The Haunt Of Fear"". Just like ""Amazing Stories"" a few years before, Tales managed to become so hip and popular, that it attracted top name talent in front of and behind the camera for it's entire run. Now that it is finally being released to DVD, it's time to relive some of the show's most ghoulish moments. Season one consists of only six episodes, and it begins with ""The Man Who Was Death"". Genre vet William Sadler stars as an executioner who loses his job and soon realizes he must take the law into his own hands. Not the most classic ep, but still good. The top classic of the season(and the whole series) is ""And All Through The House"", where a woman kills her husband on Christmas while a crazed lunatic dressed as Santa Claus stalks her from outside. This is a fantastic episode. It's classic Tales all the way. My top favorite. This episode was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starred his then wife, Mary Ellen Trainor. The crazy Santa was played by a character actor who is all too familiar with crazy roles, Larry Drake. This episode is essential Tales. Directed by Richard Donner, ""Dig That Cat...He's Real Gone"" has Joe Pantoliano given a cat's glands by a mad scientist, and now has nine lives. He uses it to the fullest effect as a sideshow attraction. Another classic. ""Only Sin Deep"" has Lea Thompson playing a hooker who sells her beauty to a sleazy pawn shop owner, only to discover that she starts to age rapidly. Not up to par with the previous ones, but good nonetheless. ""Lover Come Hack To Me"" has Amanda Plummer as a newly married woman who spends the night with her new husband in a mansion where he plans to kill her for her money. Boy, does he have a surprise. Mary Lambert, from ""Pet Semetary"" fame directs ""Collection Completed"", that has M. Emmet Walsh not being able to relax with his retirement when his wife(Audra""Three's Company""Lindley)starts taking in lots of cats. He then takes up taxidermy. Crazy episode. The stories for the episodes are taken from the comics, and they are all brought to amazing and colorful life. One episode can take you to a place of fear and dread, and the next could be whimsical. Each episode is shot like a mini movie and they are all wonderfully shot, and all with great twists and turns. They are all extremely well written. Tales From The Crypt was the definitive genre show of it's day, and it could easily come back with new episodes. Come on into the dank crypt, kick up your feet, and let the Crypt Keeper entertain you for a while.",5,"""Welcome, Boils And Ghouls....""",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3392,"['Starting', 'back', 'late', '1980', 'HBO', 'had', 'coolest', 'little', 'show', 'going', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Based', 'EC', 'comics', '1950', 'show', 'had', 'broad', 'range', 'styles', 'wound', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'told', 'tales', 'show', 'was', 'half', 'hour', 'genre', 'show', 'went', 'dark', 'scary', 'lighthearted', 'bizarre', 'episodes', 'half', 'hour', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'week', 'was', 'introduced', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'well', 'crypt', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'was', 'rotting', 'corpse', 'puppet', 'opened', 'show', 'novel', 'opening', 'act', 'then', 'always', 'closed', 'show', 'demented', 'voice', 'character', 'was', 'provided', 'John', 'Kassir', 'who', 'married', 'Julie', 'Darla', 'Benz', 'Buffy/Angel', 'fame', 'show', 'mentioned', 'was', 'EC', 'comic', 'same', 'name', 'were', 'few', 'others', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'appeared', 'as', 'well', 'Comics', 'Vault', 'Horror', 'Haunt', 'Fear', 'Just', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'few', 'years', 'Tales', 'managed', 'become', 'so', 'hip', 'popular', 'attracted', 'top', 'name', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'entire', 'run', 'Now', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'time', 'relive', 'show', 'most', 'ghoulish', 'moments', 'Season', 'one', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', 'Death', 'Genre', 'vet', 'William', 'Sadler', 'executioner', 'who', 'job', 'soon', 'must', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Not', 'most', 'classic', 'ep', 'still', 'good', 'top', 'classic', 'season', 'whole', 'series', 'House', 'where', 'woman', 'husband', 'Christmas', 'crazed', 'lunatic', 'dressed', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'stalks', 'outside', 'fantastic', 'episode', 'classic', 'Tales', 'way', 'top', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'starred', 'then', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Trainor', 'crazy', 'Santa', 'was', 'played', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'too', 'familiar', 'crazy', 'roles', 'Larry', 'Drake', 'episode', 'essential', 'Tales', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Dig', 'That', 'Cat', 'Real', 'Gone', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'given', 'cat', 'glands', 'mad', 'scientist', 'now', 'nine', 'lives', 'fullest', 'effect', 'sideshow', 'attraction', 'classic', 'Only', 'Sin', 'Deep', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'playing', 'hooker', 'who', 'beauty', 'sleazy', 'pawn', 'shop', 'owner', 'only', 'discover', 'age', 'rapidly', 'Not', 'par', 'previous', 'ones', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Hack', 'Me', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'newly', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'night', 'new', 'husband', 'mansion', 'where', 'kill', 'money', 'Boy', 'have', 'surprise', 'Mary', 'Lambert', 'Pet', 'Semetary', 'fame', 'Collection', 'Completed', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'relax', 'retirement', 'when', 'wife', 'Audra', 'Three', 'Company', 'Lindley', 'taking', 'lots', 'cats', 'then', 'up', 'taxidermy', 'Crazy', 'episode', 'stories', 'episodes', 'are', 'taken', 'comics', 'are', 'brought', 'amazing', 'colorful', 'life', 'One', 'episode', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'fear', 'dread', 'next', 'could', 'be', 'whimsical', 'episode', 'shot', 'mini', 'movie', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'great', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'was', 'definitive', 'genre', 'show', 'day', 'could', 'easily', 'come', 'back', 'new', 'episodes', 'Come', 'dank', 'crypt', 'kick', 'up', 'feet', 'let', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'entertain', 'while']",Tales from the Crypt: Season 1

904201,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0009ETCOW,,"[0, 0]","...then this long-revered series will certainly fill your bill.  First seen as a big screen movie, TALES FROM THE CRYPT became an HBO series, and this is the six episodes from its maiden season.  Guided by the hilarious Cryptkeeper, the stories vary from very good to average, but production values and that tongue in cheek humor remain intact.In ""The Man Who Was Death,"" Bill Sadler plays a state executioner who finds beauty in his work, and is upset when the state legislature repeals the death penalty and he is out of a job, but not out of work, as he takes execution matters in his own hands.  Of course, as in all these tales, ironic endings reign supreme.  Sadler is very good in his role.Next up is ""And All Through the House,"" which was originally in the big screen version with Joan Collins.  Mary Ellen Trainor (director Robert Zemecki's wife) steps in for Collins as the lovely but lethal wife who murders her husband on Christmas Eve only to be terrorized by a maniacal killer dressed as Santa Claus (a looney but effective Larry Drake).  Even though there are no real surprises here, the combination of murder and Christmas trappings maintains its punch, although Trainor overdoes her performance.""Dig That Cat...He's Real Gone"" features a good performance from Joe Pantoliano as a homeless man who is the guinea pig for a scientist's experiments on transferring feline brain matter to a human, giving him nine lives.  Pantoliano turns this into a profitable enterprise with carnival maestro Robert Wuhl, but forgets one important thing....""Only Sin Deep"" is the weakest episode, simply because it just doesn't make good sense, and Lea Thompson's vanity-driven character is neither likeable nor is Thompson's performance strong enough to carry it off.""Lover Come Hack to Me"" offers Amanda Plummer as a mousy bride to hunky Stephen Shellen's fortune-grubbing new husband.  When their car breaks down, they seek shelter in an abandoned house with its own secrets.  Plummer's schizophrenic performance highlights this predictable tale.""Collection Completed"" features sturdy performances from the late character actors M. Emmet Walsh and Audra Lindley in a tale of a husband whose wife has taken in stray animals for the duration of their marriage because he's never been around.  He seeks revenge and so does she.All in all, fans of this anthological type of horror should find something in this collection.",4,LIKE A LITTLE HUMOR IN YOUR HORROR?,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2419,"['then', 'long-revered', 'series', 'will', 'certainly', 'fill', 'bill', 'First', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'TALES', 'FROM', 'THE', 'CRYPT', 'became', 'HBO', 'series', 'six', 'episodes', 'maiden', 'season', 'Guided', 'hilarious', 'Cryptkeeper', 'stories', 'vary', 'very', 'good', 'average', 'production', 'values', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'remain', 'intact.In', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', 'Death', 'Bill', 'Sadler', 'state', 'executioner', 'who', 'beauty', 'work', 'upset', 'when', 'state', 'legislature', 'death', 'penalty', 'job', 'not', 'work', 'execution', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'course', 'tales', 'ironic', 'endings', 'reign', 'supreme', 'Sadler', 'very', 'good', 'role.Next', 'up', 'House', 'was', 'originally', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Trainor', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemecki', 'wife', 'steps', 'Collins', 'lovely', 'lethal', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'only', 'be', 'terrorized', 'maniacal', 'killer', 'dressed', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'looney', 'effective', 'Larry', 'Drake', 'Even', 'are', 'real', 'surprises', 'here', 'combination', 'murder', 'Christmas', 'trappings', 'punch', 'Trainor', 'performance', 'Dig', 'That', 'Cat', 'Real', 'Gone', 'good', 'performance', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'guinea', 'pig', 'scientist', 'experiments', 'transferring', 'feline', 'brain', 'matter', 'human', 'giving', 'nine', 'lives', 'Pantoliano', 'profitable', 'enterprise', 'carnival', 'maestro', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'Only', 'Sin', 'Deep', 'weakest', 'episode', 'simply', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'sense', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'vanity-driven', 'character', 'likeable', 'Thompson', 'performance', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'off', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Hack', 'Me', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'mousy', 'bride', 'hunky', 'Stephen', 'Shellen', 'fortune-grubbing', 'new', 'husband', 'When', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'seek', 'shelter', 'abandoned', 'house', 'own', 'secrets', 'Plummer', 'schizophrenic', 'performance', 'highlights', 'predictable', 'tale', 'Collection', 'Completed', 'sturdy', 'performances', 'late', 'character', 'actors', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'tale', 'husband', 'wife', 'taken', 'stray', 'animals', 'duration', 'marriage', 'never', 'been', 'around', 'revenge', 'so', 'she.All', 'fans', 'anthological', 'type', 'horror', 'should', 'find', 'something', 'collection']",Tales from the Crypt: Season 1

Because I'm an enthusiast of golden age comics and I've owned the Complete EC Library by Russ Cochran - among my favorite sets being Tales from the Crypt. So I was naturally curious to see what the producers, evidently EC fans all, did with the format and stories.Well, it's okay. It's not great. The Cryptkeeper's banter, good mean fun on the four color page, is a little flat on the cathode ray tube. In fact, it sounds dumb said aloud. Sorry.

In all my thirty years of reading TFTC I never once conceived of ""it"" sounding like that.And my last major complaint (too late by almost fifteen years, I know...) is the dreadful yet inevitable Danny Elfman score. Did the viewing public ever actually clamour for his work, or was he merely thrust upon the world by film producers who knew his name and no other?

Ever since DVD's came along, I've been pondering the question of Tales From The Crypt on DVD.  And in 2005, they finally released it.  The first season, which is very short, but has many classics.  Now I'm the kind of guy who likes a lot of special features on DVD, and that's why I don't buy old Warner Bros. DVD's as they are bare and boneless.  I wait until the Special Features as I just did with Batman and Batman Returns.  But Tales From the Crypt Season 1 barely contains any special features at all.  Just a new Intro by the Crypt Keeper, A History Of Season 1 Featurette and Tales From the Crypt, From Comic Book to Television.  So, I was dissapointed.  And they don't have the original intros for each episode, which I love, and they released it only is Season 1, not Season 1 and Season 2 together.  That was stupid, because now we're left with six episodes on this set.

I bought it immediately upon release, but I made an unpleasant discovery upon playing it. The opening sequence has been OMITTED from each episode. We don't even get it on the first episode and omitted from the rest as a few sets for other series have done in the past (a la ""Little House on the Prairie""). The only place it is present is when you first insert and play the disc, and then it is a slightly fuzzy and somehow off-kilter version, with a ""Kill Intro"" icon present and highlighted in the corner of the screen the entire time. Other than the missing intro, these episodes ARE uncut content-wise. But consider yourself warned: If you want truly COMPLETE episodes, that is NOT what you will get if you buy this set.

THE CAMERA REACHES THE BASEMENT, OUT POPS THE CRYPT KEEPER WITH HIS MENACING CACKLE* ""TALES FROM THE CRYPT"". This show is one of my all-time favorites. I used to sit in front of the television with my father every Saturday night when this  show came on. The stories in this show were so amazing and so well done, that I couldn't help myself when I became hooked on the show, and I was only four-years-old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989.TALES FROM THE CRYPT takes you on a journey through six horrifying episodes, each one scaring you in one way or another. This here first season only includes six episodes, but all six are very terrifying, and many ways, rather comical as well.#1: THE MAN WHO WAS DEATH (aired June 10, 1989)This spook-tacular episode shows a man named NILES (played by William Saddler, who would then go on to take the male lead role in the first-ever TALES FROM THE CRYPT motion picture entitled, TALES FROM THE CRYPT presents DEMON KNIGHT), who has spent the last twelve years of his life shooting electricity into prisoners, sending out their life sentences. But now, a law has been passed to ban the life sentence, for even executing murderers and law breakers is ""Still Murder Within The Eyes of God"". Niles then appears in a few court cases where the defendants happen to be let off the hook, despite the fact they are indeed guilty. This leaves Niles to privately execute the defendants, where it leads Niles into his own arrest, where is then in for a ""Shocking"" surprise.#2: AND ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE (aired June 10, 1989)In this chilling Holiday-filled episode, a woman murders her husband in cold blood on Christmas Eve. As she tries to bury the body outside in the freezing cold snow, she neglects to hear on the news that an escaped mental patient as broken out of the sanitarium, and has already killed four women in the county. The news has even stated that the patient has been seen wearing a Santa Claus suit, a suit he had stolen from one his victims. The mental patient stumbles upon this woman, practically killing her, but she seems to have killed him by stabbing him in the stomach. As she gets a hold of the police on the phone, she is told by the police to look around for a weapon to use, since she has informed the police that the patient has gotten up and entered her house, after she stabbed him the stomach. She goes into the closet to get her gun, but the door locks. As she pounds on the door, trying to get out, the patient climbs up to the woman's daughter's bedroom, with the daughter thinking that's it the real Santa. She busts through the closet and finds her daughter safe and sound, holding ""Santa"" by the hand, with her mother screaming at the top of her lungs.#3: DIG THAT CAT...HE'S REAL GONE (aired June 10, 1989)In this brilliant episode, ULRIC (played by Joe Pantoliano) comes across a seemingly mad scientist, who gives Ulric an offer he can't refuse: Have the gland of a cat inserted into his brain to give him the ability to resurrected after he is killed. The surgery goes successful, where Ulric becomes a classic act at the county fairs. He has been drowned, shot in the heart with an arrow, electrocuted, and many more. But he just kept coming back from beyond the grave. Here is now about to pull his next death stunt: being buried alive for twelve hours, and then resurrected. But...wait a minute. Ulric has already died and been resurrected...nine times.#4: ONLY SIN DEEP (aired June 14, 1989)In this sexy and beauty-filled episode, SYLVIA (played by Lea Thompson) is a 21-year-old hooker, looking to quit the business and clean up her act. She does so with the money she has robbed from her pimp...after killing him. She goes into a pawn shop to have her pimp's jewelery, but the pawner reveals that the jewelery isn't worth crap, for the jewelery is ""hot"". But he's willing to pay Sylvia $10,000 for her ""beauty"". He informs her that if she wants her beauty back, she has to get it back within a four-month period. Okay, whatever, you old whack-job. Sylvia goes through with the pawning of her beauty and goes out on her way with her 10 Gs. She meets a playboy and begins dating him. Four months go by and Sylvia begins seeing some odd changes in her complextion. She goes to a dermotologist, but he cannot seem to figure out what is wrong, where it is then and there that Sylvia figures out that the pawner was not kidding. She demands her beauty back, but the pawner will only sell it back to her for...$100,000. She kills her playboy boyfriend, and scrapes up every piece of jewelery he ever bought her. She gets her beauty back, which was formed in a plaster-of-paris head of her own self, but it ends up being smashed to pieces when one of Sylvia's hooker friends bumps right into her, not recognizing Sylvia, for she has become so hideous, like an old, disgusting haggard witch.#5: LOVER, COME HACK TO ME (aired June 21, 1989)In this ciller, Charles has found Peggy, the perfect girl. Peggy has found Charles, the perfect man. The two have married, against the wishes of Peggy's aunt. On their way to their honeymoon, they are stranded into an old house, where they have to succomb into spending their wedding night in this disgusting old house. Peggy wants her wedding night to be perfect, so consumating their marriage on the sofa is not a good idea. Comsumating their marriage in a bed is much better. They do their thing, and they both fall asleep, where Peggy says in a sort of joking way that they've made a child, a little girl. Charles falls asleep, but he wakes up to the sound of Peggy entering the house with another man. He watches his own wife screw another guy on the sofa, where they guy falls asleep, while Peggy tells him of how they've just conceived a child, a little girl. She then picks up an axe, leans over to the man's ear and simply says, ""Peggy would make a great name for our little girl, wouldn't it?"" She swings the axe and kills the guy she just had sex with. Charles wakes up in horror, for it was only a nightmare, but it was a nightmare about a true fact: Peggy's mother had killed her Peggy's father on their wedding night, after they had consumated their marriage, where her mother and father had just conceived Peggy that very night. Peggy's mother said she did it to consume the perfect love to a perfect wedding night. But Charles claims that he didn't marry Peggy out of love. He married her for her money, and he was going to murder Peggy that very night, report to the police that an accident had happened, where he would inherit the money, but Peggy has made a change in plans: continuing her family tradition, which is: Murdering her husband to consume the perfect love on the perfect wedding night, after consumating their marriage, which led into the conception of their daughter.#6: COLLECTION COMPLETED (aired June 28, 1989)In this lame episode, Audrey Lindley (the actress best known for her role as HELEN ROPER on Three's Company) plays a lonely housewife, who's husband named JULIAS has just retired. One the first day of his retirement, her husband is already going crazy because of all the animals his wife has in the house. She continues to claim that she does not want to get rid of the animals because they are her ""friends"", they've kept her company all those years her husband had spent working, instead of paying more attention to his own wife. Days go by, and the house is seeing less and less of the animals. Julias then shows his wife where all the animals have gone: in his basement...stuffed. The last animal to be taken care of is a cat, but Julias' wife bashes his skull in. But the next afternoon, she is sitting in the living room with Julias, talking to him as if he were still alive. Their friendly next-door neighbor drops by, where he discovers Julias' stuffed body.This was a great season. But stay tuned, Boils and Ghouls.

It's what every fan has been waiting for, the only disappointment I have is that there are only six episodes in this season. They should have combined seasons one and two together like Ren and Stimpy among others have done. The first three ""The Man Who Was Death"", ""And all through the House"" and ""Dig that Cat he's Real Gone"" come on the Scifi Channel all of the time which leaves really only three episode that I haven't seen a thousand times.Overall, I still recommend getting these, especially if you are a fan of this series, and I am big time. I also plan to get this, these are great episodes. But being a fan, it leaves me wishing there was more, especially since we've been waiting forever for the seasons to finally come out on DVD. At least we get the uncensored version and a few extras. That alone will make it worth the buy. I just hope Season 2 comes out sometime this year, to quench my thirst for this great series, because six episodes is just a glass half full, I want more!

I had watched the show when I was younger, so hearing that name made me curious. Anyway, I'm now a full-on TALES fan, and the first season had me hooked. It has 6 episodes, all spooky in their own right. The highlights, though, are ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE, with a woman (Mary Ellen Trainor)killing her husband and getting terrorized by an escaped lunatic in a Santa suit (Larry Drake), which is directed by executive producer Robert Zemeckis (BACK TO THE FUTURE, FORREST GUMP); and the other highlight is COLLECTION COMPLETED, a sick little tale that starts out comical, with the cantankerous hardware salesman Jonas (M. Emmet Walsh) getting tired of his wife's pet obsession. All episodes have that TALES trademark twist, where someone usually dies in an ironic way. And of course, there's your host the Cryptkeeper (voiced by John Kassir), who makes even the most morbid of tales humorous with cracks like ""He didn't know WATT hit him!""

904230,A25TCNP2PM4ZAU,B0009ETCOW,"John C. Hyde ""WJCK5""","[2, 2]","In the tradition of Creepshow 1 & 2 comes the first season of the world's greatest horror anthology series, hosted by the world's greatest horror host, The Cryptkeeper... it's Tales From The Crypt.The first thing you'll notice is that our friend The Cryptkeeper is a little more subdued and a lot less flamboyant than in later years. Our boy hadn't grown into his hosting duties at this point, so we get a bit of a low snarling CK here. As opposed to the shrieking, maniacal superhost of the following seasons.The First Season is only 6 episodes. It's short and sweet but of the absolute highest quality. There are 2 discs. The first contains all 6 episodes. The other contains the documentary, ""Tales From the Crypt: From Comic Books to Television"". The documentary is superb, one of the best special features you could hope to get. A pleasure to watch repeatedly.But the episodes are where it's at, so let's take a look at each one.1. ""The Man Who Was Death"" - Early on, the comic book influence is obviously strong. The main character in a couple of the early episodes even develops a superpower. In this one William Sadler plays an executioner who develops the power to control electricity. His sense of moral outrage at the injustice of the Courts cause him to embark on a career as a vigilante. He no doubt realized with his newfound mastery of electrictity, that with great power must come great responsibility. But he's closer to Wes Craven's Shocker than he is to Spider-Man. Great episode. 4 Stars.2. ""And All Through The House"" - This will scare the hell out of you, if you have a soul. Both this version and the original one from the old TFTC movie have haunted me since childhood. I can remember nights being paralyzed with fear thinking about this particular installment. You know the deal,  a psychotic Santa Claus is on the loose on Christmas Eve. Talk about atmosphere, this is seething with it. As good as TFTC gets. A perfect installment. 5 Stars.3. ""Dig That Cat... He's Real Gone"" - Here you have Joey Pants as a ne'er-do-well who develops the super cat power of having 9 lives. So of course he sets out to use up those 9 lives as quickly as possible by dying repeatedly in a cheap carnival act. Who's keeping count? HBO's top sports agent, Robert Wuhl. You'd have to be crazy to trust Robert Wuhl to keep count of your lives. 4 Stars.4. ""Only Sin Deep"" - Not even Marty McFly knew Lea Thompson's future could be so bleak. But it is because in this one she plays a floozie who gets swindled out of her youth and good looks at a pawnshop. Decent episode. 3 and a half Stars.5. ""Lover Come Hack To Me"" - A primitive, soap-opera feeling installment about a player that just got married to a nerd-woman. She's got issues and all kinds of secrets and he has no clue what he got himself into. 2 and a half Stars.6. ""Collection Completed"" - The final episode of Season One is about an old man who is annoyed by his wife's pets. He also happens to be a taxidermy hobbyist. So you can imagine the arguments between this couple, she wants her pets to stay alive, he wants to kill them and stuff them. But it all works out in the end. 3 and a half Stars.The series had a long way to come from this point, and a lot of improvement to make. But the beginning here is very solid. With one absolute classic episode surrounded by a bunch of good episodes. If I were buying each set individually, I'd buy this set fifth. After seasons 2 - 5.One of the great things about this season is the late 80s look and sound of the shows.

904232,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B0009ETCOW,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","Six decent horror tales and one outstanding documentary on the origins of the notorious E.C. comics on which the tales here are based together make this first season of the old HBO series ""Tales from the Crypt"" a must buy.  Myself, I prefer my horror straight up with no chaser, so the humor in the introductions and laced throughout the stories didn't work as well on me as it might for some, but again, that's just me.  And even I found a lot of the black humor somewhat amusing.In any event, though, be sure to watch the documentary on disc two.  At almost an hour long, it gives a comprehensive overview on the world of comic books in the 1950s and the eventual rise (and, alas, fall) of E.C.'s horror comics line during that period.  For anyone interested in comics history, the documentary alone would be worth the price of this season one set.  In a world of 10-minute (if you're lucky) DVD bonus materials, you just don't see special features like this anymore.  The most interesting part of the documentary for me was seeing the E.C. artists admit that, yes, perhaps they did go a little too far in their horrific depictions of gore and violence in some of their stories, needlessly bringing on the wrath of Congress.I actually bought season one of this show in a colorful package that bundled it together with season two, at a really cheap price (I found it in the DVD section of that retail store with the red-concentric-circles logo).  Amazon may have a similar offer on the initial seasons, though, so look around here first.Anyway, I'm off to check out the quality of the much longer second season of ""Tales from the Crypt"", as I didn't have HBO during the show's initial run way back when.

904237,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B0009ETCOW,Michael R Gates,"[17, 18]","Based on stories from the deliciously depraved E.C. horror comics (TALES FROM THE CRYPT, VAULT OF HORROR, HAUNT OF FEAR, etc.) of the 1950s, TALES FROM THE CRYPT was a TV horror anthology that, like most TV anthologies, had a lot of both hits and misses. Originally airing on HBO and then later in syndication, some of the episodes fell short, but when a story was a hit, it was usually dead on (excuse the pun). This DVD features the complete first season of TALES FROM THE CRYPT.  The season was sort of a trial run, so it was abbreviated and offered only 6 episodes, but all six are offered here in their original uncut form in syndication, episodes were edited to remove non-cable no-nos like nudity, severe profanity, and sometimes a certain amount of gore).All 6 episodes from this first season are pretty good, but two of them stand out above the rest:""And All Through the House,"" directed by renowned and Oscar-winning (1994's FORREST GUMP) Robert Zemeckis, is definitely the scariest of the six. It's a tense morality play about a disgruntled wife who murders her husband on Christmas Eve, only to then have a madman dressed in Santa garb show up to deliver her just deserts.  But not only does it warn that ""what goes around, comes around,"" it also makes a multi-faceted statement about innocence and youth, as it is the murderous woman's little daughter who ultimately lets ""Santa"" into the house. Larry Drake delivers a delectably deranged performance as the insane Saint Nick. (This has proven to be one of the most enduring stories from the original E.C. Comics series, as it was also previously dramatized in 1972 as one portion of an excellent five-part British flick entitled TALES FROM THE CRYPT. In that version, Joan Collins--DYNASTY's Alexis Carrington Colby--played the part of the homicidal wife.)""The Man Who Was Death"" stars William Sadler--who would later star in the TALES FROM THE CRYPT feature film DEMON KNIGHT (1995)--as an old-fashioned country boy who moved to the big city and ended up being employed as the state's executioner.  However, when the death penalty is repealed, he suddenly finds himself without a job, so he decides to go freelance and bring his own ""shocking"" brand of justice to the murderers who fall through the cracks of the system.  His zeal makes him a bit careless, though, and he eventually finds himself in the ""hot seat"" when the cops are able to trace him down just after the death penalty gets reinstated.The DVD from Warner Home Video not only offers fairly clean digital transfers of these delightful episodes of this popular show, and it also features a couple of pretty cool extras, the best of which is a featurette that discusses what it took to get TALES FROM THE CRYPT off of the comic pages and onto the small screen.In short, TALES FROM THE CRYPT--THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is a must-own for all serious horror fans.",5,Lights...Camera...Hack-tion!

The stories are eerie and edgy and all of them have a twisted ending where justice is served in one form or another. Also, it's an 'R' rated series.

This two disc first season set finds big name Hollywood producers and directors (Robert Zemeckis, Walter Hill, Richard Donner) helming these deliriously gory tales of terror, murder, and revenge.  Hosted by the fiendish Cryptkeeper (voiced by John Kassir), all six first season episodes are here in all their gory glory, beginning with the Walter Hill directed ""The Man Who Was Death"" starring series stalwart William Sadler as an out of work prison executioner who continues doing what he does best.  Robert Zemeckis directs ""And All Through the House"" finds a serial killer (Larry Drake) dressed in a Santa Clause outfit stalking a woman who has just murdered her husband on Christmas night.  Richard Donner's ""Dig That Cat, He's Real Gone"" finds Joe Pantoliano as a man who uses his newfound nine lives to make money, which doesn't turn out too well.  Howard Deutch's ""Only Sin Deep"" finds a hooker (Lea Thompson) selling her beauty, and begins to age rapidly.  Child's Play and Fright Night director Tom Holland helms ""Lover Come Back to Me"", as a man marries a woman (Amanda Plummer) for her money, but gets much more than he bargained for.  Finally, Pet Semetary director Mary Lambert helms ""Collection Complete"" in which a newly retired tool salesman (M. Emmit Walsh) grows quite tired of his wife's pets, and takes up taxidermy as a means to rid them, but gets a taste of his own medicine in return.  The special features are a great bonus as well, focusing on the popularity and inspiration of the classic EC Comics, featuring interviews with horror legends George Romero and John Carpenter.

904241,A2HFSTKZ8AWDFQ,B0009ETCOW,Pamela Scarangello,"[113, 120]","Welcome to my review, horror freaks! So glad you could join me and read about the 6 eerie episodes of HBO's ""Tales from the Crypt,"" the very ones that helped the series rise from its tomb back in 1989. It's been 9 long years since the show went off the air, and until now, I've been waiting for the Crypt Keeper's putrid puns and awful alliterations to be forever preserved on DVD format. And why not? The show lasted a full 7 seasons and featured many of the biggest actors and directors in Hollywood. Each tale carefully incorporates the grisly black humor William M. Gaines EC comic books, which were almost banned in the 1950's. Did I say 'almost?' Anyway, as other HBO programs like ""Dream On,"" ""Deadwood,"" and ""Carnivale"" were packaged and displayed on Best Buy shelves, I wondered if ""Tales"" would ever be among them. Well, the time has finally arrived, creeps! As stated by John Kassir himself, Warner Brothers wisely chose to create these discs so we ourselves can scare the next generation of kiddies to come. Even better is the fact that the second disc of this Season 1 set will contain a sickening array of never-before-seen extras. I don't want to give the surprises away, but I will briefly tell you the stories you are about to see. Enter, if you dare!""Dig that Cat...He's Real Gone"" stars Joe Pantoliano as Ulric, a homeless alcoholic who becomes a rich and famous sideshow performer after a mad doctor (Gustav Vintas) surgically implants a cat's gland into Ulric's brain. This procedure allows him to die and return to life nine times. Morbid hilarity ensues as a carnival barker (Robert Wuhl) presents Ulric the Undying to astounded audiences who watch him get electrocuted, hanged, drowned in a tank, and shot with an arrow (among other things).In ""The Man Who was Death,"" Bill Sadler (who eventually starred in the 1995 Tales from the Crypt film ""Demon Knight"") plays Niles Talbot, a state executioner who loses his job after spending 12 years pulling the switch. This resulted because the government unexpectantly repealed the death penalty. However, not wanting to abandon his favorite occupation, Niles drifts to the other side of the law by killing criminals who were acquitted by the courts.The frightening and festive ""And All Through the House"" stars Mary Ellen Trainor as a devious housewife named Elizabeth, who brutally bludgeons her husband with a poker to collect on an insurance policy. Just when she is ready to eliminate the corpse, a homicidal maniac donning a Santa Claus costume (Larry Drake) terrorizes her with an axe. Even worse, Elizabeth can't call the police for fear of being convicted of first degree murder and losing custody of her daughter.Vanity and greed play a central role in ""Only Sin Deep,"" a tale about a street prostitute named Sylvia Vane (Lea Thompson). After killing a pimp and stealing his gold jewelry, she willingly sells her beauty to a strange pawnbroker (Britt Leach) in exchange for $10,000 cash. At first, Sylvia wins over the affections of a suave playboy millionaire. But immediately afterward, as a result of some black magic performed by the pawnbroker, she gets increasingly distraught as her face quickly ages. Desperate to buy back her looks, she shoots her rich lover dead, but is then forced to avoid prison by staying ugly for life.Prepare for a honeymoon hell in ""Lover Come Hack To Me."" Here, a cunning bachelor named Charles (Stephen Shellen) marries a naive Peggy (Amanda Plummer) for her inheritance money. On a rainy night, after accidentally getting stuck in an abandoned mansion, the two go up to the bedroom and make perfect love for the very first time. Originally, Charles was going to kill Peggy and stage the crime to look like a burglary. But he soon discovers that her family history is cursed, and that much darker skeletons lie in the bride's closet.Last but not least is one of my favorite episodes, ""Collection Completed."" M. Emmet Walsh plays Jonas, a grouchy tool salesman who finally gets to retire after 47 years on the job. His slightly odd wife Anita (Audra Lindley) has developed a fondness for pets...alot of pets. In fact, she keeps a zoo-full of cats, dogs, and birds in the house. On top of that, she talks to squirrels and runs an aquarium in the bathtub. Obviously, such an attachment to animals is enough to drive Jonas up the wall! Inevitably, he gets sick and tired of not having enough attention, and he gleefully takes up taxidermy as a hobby. But those poor animals weren't the only living creatures that ended up getting stuffed.",5,"""Mirror, mirror on the wall.

After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------I've been eagerly waiting for this series to come to DVD in season sets. Unfortunately, there were a few bad decisions that kinda ruins this set for me.(1) Who's brilliant idea was it to put the security sticker BEHIND the plastic disc holder and right on top of a photo printed on paperboard? Not only was it hard to get off without breaking the case, but the sticker glue ripped off part of the photo.(2) Each episode is INCOMPLETE, as each episode does not have it's own series intro/title sequence (which featured the journey through the house accompanied by the Danny Elfman theme). They had only one intro/title sequence for all six episodes (at the start of the disc), and they even ruined that with a ""Kill Intro"" graphic overlay and having it go right into the menu (technically that intro is part of the menu). There is plenty of room for each episode to have it's own intro/title, as they didn't have to cram all six episodes onto Disc 1. They could have put episodes 1-4 on Disc 1, and episodes 4 & 5 on Disc 2, along with the two Disc 2 bonus features (which only total an hour or so).If you're curious as to why the episodes on Seasons 1 and 2 are missing the title sequence, read this article.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tales from the Crypt - Missing intro - Studio ExplainsPosted by Gord Lacey (8/27/2005)Some fans were upset with the first season release of Tales from the Crypt because the episodes didn't feature the standard intro to the series; a journey into the creepy house, down the stairs and then an encounter with the Crypt Keeper.I called Warner Bros to ask about season 2, and whether we'll see the intro returned to the episodes. The second season will not have the intro, so I asked why. The removal of the intro was a specific request from the producers of the series for the season 1 set. Warner went back and asked about season 2, and the producers still wish to have it removed; no further explanation could be obtained.The intro isn't missing from the set completely; it's featured in the menu for the disc. The intro is the same for each episode as well.(source: [...])~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What the hell were the producers thinking! Why on Earth would they make such an odd request? What benefit could they have from not having the intro at the start of each episode? The same theme and almost all of the same footage appears under the end credits, so it can't be because they don't want to pay Danny Elfman for his theme music.The series of videotapes released by HBO Home Video and Time-Life in the mid-1990s, featured an intro/title sequence on EACH of the three episodes contained on each tape. If it was done before, there's no reason it can't be done now.Thankfully, enough fans complained to Warner Bros. to make the producers see the error of their ways.  These two problems are now only resigned toSeason 1andSeason 2.  ForSeason 3and onward the crappy Digipak packaging was replaced with slim cases in an outer sleeve, and each episode has its own series intro/title sequence - though it's missing the first two seconds showing the text ""Home Box Office Presents"" (white text on a black screen) over the low whisperings of the theme song.",2,"Bad Security Sticker Placement, Incomplete Episodes",1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,3592,"['Below', 'review', 'product', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'may', 'display', 'review', 'page', 'version', 'product', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'apply', 'reading', 'review', 'please', 'click', 'link', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'product', 'review', 'same', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'for.', ""'ve"", 'been', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 'series', 'come', 'DVD', 'season', 'sets', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'few', 'bad', 'decisions', 'kinda', 'set', '1', 'Who', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'was', 'put', 'security', 'sticker', 'plastic', 'disc', 'holder', 'right', 'top', 'photo', 'printed', 'paperboard', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'off', 'breaking', 'case', 'sticker', 'glue', 'ripped', 'part', 'photo', '2', 'episode', 'INCOMPLETE', 'episode', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'series', 'intro/title', 'sequence', 'featured', 'journey', 'house', 'accompanied', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'theme', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'intro/title', 'sequence', 'six', 'episodes', 'start', 'disc', 'even', 'ruined', 'Kill', 'Intro', 'graphic', 'overlay', 'having', 'go', 'right', 'menu', 'technically', 'intro', 'part', 'menu', 'plenty', 'room', 'episode', 'have', 'own', 'intro/title', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cram', 'six', 'episodes', 'Disc', '1', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'episodes', '1-4', 'Disc', '1', '4', '5', 'Disc', '2', 'two', 'Disc', '2', 'bonus', 'features', 'only', 'total', 'hour', 'so', '.If', ""'re"", 'curious', 'why', 'episodes', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'are', 'missing', 'title', 'sequence', 'read', 'article.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tales', 'Crypt', 'Missing', 'intro', 'Studio', 'ExplainsPosted', 'Gord', 'Lacey', '8/27/2005', 'fans', 'were', 'upset', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'feature', 'standard', 'intro', 'series', 'journey', 'creepy', 'house', 'stairs', 'then', 'encounter', 'Crypt', 'Keeper.I', 'called', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'ask', 'season', '2', ""'ll"", 'see', 'intro', 'returned', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'intro', 'asked', 'why', 'removal', 'intro', 'was', 'specific', 'request', 'producers', 'series', 'season', '1', 'set', 'Warner', 'went', 'back', 'asked', 'season', '2', 'producers', 'still', 'wish', 'have', 'removed', 'further', 'explanation', 'could', 'be', 'obtained.The', 'intro', ""n't"", 'missing', 'set', 'completely', 'featured', 'menu', 'disc', 'intro', 'same', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'source', '[', ']', 'hell', 'were', 'producers', 'thinking', 'Why', 'Earth', 'would', 'make', 'such', 'odd', 'request', 'What', 'benefit', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'having', 'intro', 'start', 'episode', 'same', 'theme', 'almost', 'same', 'footage', 'end', 'credits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'theme', 'music.The', 'series', 'videotapes', 'released', 'HBO', 'Home', 'Video', 'Time-Life', 'mid-1990s', 'featured', 'intro/title', 'sequence', 'EACH', 'three', 'episodes', 'contained', 'tape', 'was', 'done', 'before', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'now.Thankfully', 'enough', 'fans', 'complained', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'make', 'producers', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'two', 'problems', 'are', 'now', 'only', 'resigned', 'toSeason', '1andSeason', '2', 'ForSeason', '3and', 'crappy', 'Digipak', 'packaging', 'was', 'replaced', 'slim', 'cases', 'outer', 'sleeve', 'episode', 'own', 'series', 'intro/title', 'sequence', 'missing', 'first', 'two', 'seconds', 'showing', 'text', 'Home', 'Box', 'Office', 'Presents', 'white', 'text', 'black', 'screen', 'low', 'whisperings', 'theme', 'song']",Tales from the Crypt: Season 1

I HIGHLY recommend this, this season is jammed packed with extras, surprisingly this show was given a proper treatment, because unfortunately, so many shows are not given good treatments at all. This show has held up all these years and is just as fun as always, but the best parts is always the opening and ending when the Cryptkeeper himself has his punny (excuse me) funny little comments, he is the life of the show.

The reason this set is only $18 or so is because the first season had only 6 episodes while season two would have 18 episodes.  You start as the camera whizzes through the haunted house and down the stairs to the crypts where the EC mascot the Cryptkeeper pops up with his hideous cackle, voiced magnificently by John kassir.""The Man Who Was Death"" is directed by Walter Hill and is about an Executioner who finds himself out of work when the death penalty is abolished and how he decides to keep his work going.""And all through the House"" is directed by Robert Zemeckis is a horrific Christmas episode which finds Larry Drake playing a homicidal Santa stalking a woman who just killed her husband.""Dig that Cat he's Real Gone"" was directed by Richard Donner.  It stars Joe Pantoliano as a bum who becomes the featured star of a sideshow when a mad doctor ala Boris Karloff, gives him a cat gland which allows him to die and come back to life.""Only Sin Deep"" Directed by Howard Deutch.  In one of those classic ironic twist stories of EC comics, a prostitute sells her beauty to a pawn shop but then finds herslef getting older and uglier vary rapidly.""Lover come Back to Me"" Directed by Tom Holland.  A man marries a woman (Amanda Plummer) for her money but soon finds himself in for more than he bargained for with her family.""Collection Complete"" directed by mary Lambert.  A retired salesman is fed up with living with his wife's house full of pets and takes up taxidermy to deal with the animals.A solid first season with some of the great directors in film chipping in with their own efforts.

Allowing children to read such filth would be the downfall of civilzation. I don't know about all that but when I was a boy I read and re-read every issue I could get and and my civilization is still standing tall. Anyway, the Tales from the Crypt comics hold a hallowed place in my psyche so it is was a happy day when HBO assemebed some creative geniuses to translate the comics into TV episodes. Fortuantely (and since it's HBO) included is all the violence and gore along with the diabolical wit and dark sense of irony. It's obvious everyone invloved in bringing these dark tales to TV ""got"" whatever made the comics so popular and caused teenagers from my generation to invest our entire weekly allowance on this series.This DVD includes the first 6 episodes of the long running HBO series. The stories are lifted directly from 6 of the actual stories from some of the most classic tales which include a blood splattered bride, a grisly carny act, an ax weilding Santa Claus (which will be watched every Christmas along with Mircle on 34th Street), an old crone of a hooker, an umemployed electric chair operator, and a crazy old lady with too many cats. The feel and look of the old comics are even caputured on the screen as they went back to the original artwork and used them for the storyboard to develop the TV series. WAY TO GO HBO; and when is Season 2 going to be available? I'm looking forward to it like when I was a kid I would live for the new  issues  to hit the newstands.This DVD is set is highly recommended for horror buffs and especially for fans of the old EC horror comics. All 6 episodes are gory,fun, suspenseful, and extremely scary. A 50 minute  documentary provides an interesing history lession about the development of horror comics and the fight with the moral police.And how about those moral police? They are still at it but they sure have changed in what they attack. Compare Tales from the Crypt with Teletubbies, Buster Bunny, and Sponge Bob. They are saying the cartoons of today are leading to another downfall of civilization just like horror comics were 50 years ago. The moral police.
