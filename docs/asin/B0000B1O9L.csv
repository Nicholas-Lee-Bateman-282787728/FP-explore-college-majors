769949,AO31JF8HT1ONU,B0000B1O9L,"Adam J. Fernandes ""DarkWriter""","[6, 6]","I first came to know Lon Chaney through Turner Classic Movies and I have been an admirer and fan ever since. Lon Chaney was the only silent film star I've ever seen that could portray complex human emotions without making them seem contribed or fake. Even through all that makeup the heart of the character can clearly be seen. And he also did all of this without sound.Although his classics are monster films like Phantom and Hunchback, this collection highlights three of his best films outside the horror genre. The three films have a similar theme: Chaney's character is in love with a woman who's in love with someone else. In the end, except for The Unknown, he realizes that if he can't have her at least he can leave her happy and that becomes more important to him. Laugh, Clown, Laugh is my favorite of this collection.Here's hoping this collection introduces him to more people and shows others that he can do more beyond monster movies!",5,Man of a Thousand Talents,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,948,"['first', 'came', 'know', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'have', 'been', 'admirer', 'fan', 'ever', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'was', 'only', 'silent', 'film', 'star', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'could', 'portray', 'complex', 'human', 'emotions', 'making', 'seem', 'contribed', 'fake', 'Even', 'makeup', 'heart', 'character', 'can', 'clearly', 'be', 'seen', 'also', 'did', 'classics', 'are', 'monster', 'films', 'Phantom', 'Hunchback', 'collection', 'highlights', 'three', 'best', 'films', 'horror', 'genre', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'similar', 'theme', 'Chaney', 'character', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'end', 'Unknown', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'least', 'can', 'leave', 'happy', 'more', 'important', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'favorite', 'collection.Here', 'hoping', 'collection', 'more', 'people', 'others', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'monster', 'movies']",N/A
769950,A1DX2001FVE2ND,B0000B1O9L,Alex,"[2, 2]","...only that, believe it or not, Lon Chaney in Germany is a complete unknown to today's audiences.Whenever I mention the name to people around me (even true movie buffs) I am confronted with complete ignorance...Lon, who???It is a shame that this great actor never found the recognition in this country, where during the silent era real motion picture history was written. Just imagine, how a collaboration between true artists such as Chaney and for instance Fritz Lang could have looked like!But I guess this is just wishful thinking...Let's instead enjoy this package we have here. Despite offering a mixed bag (with The Ace of Hearts for me providing a rather lame start), this box set contains two really exciting displays of Chaney's unbelievable talent. Laugh, Clown, Laugh is a deeply romantic story with Chaney acting as the too old and hence unwanted lover of a young artist. A movie that despite its rather simple plot but at the same time due to Chaney's amazing acting qualities offers a truly touching story, that if brought to the screen today would still find its audience.The Unknown, the last and without any doubt the best movie of the three, offers a story that even under today's standards (and I am talking bizarre and blood stained movies such as Saw and alike) should thrill genre fans. For it proves that despite its bizarre if not sadistic contents the ACTING makes for a great movie experience. Chaney alone carries the twisted plot about a sideshow artist become cripple for his love of his life, just to find out that loves goes in a very different way...so, if you are into the cinema of the bizarre, and the cinema of great acting performances, you better sink your teeth into this one!",5,Not much to add to previous reviews...,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1717,"['only', 'believe', 'not', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Germany', 'complete', 'unknown', 'today', 'audiences.Whenever', 'mention', 'name', 'people', 'even', 'true', 'movie', 'buffs', 'am', 'confronted', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'Lon', 'who', 'shame', 'great', 'actor', 'never', 'found', 'recognition', 'country', 'where', 'silent', 'era', 'real', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'was', 'written', 'Just', 'imagine', 'how', 'collaboration', 'true', 'artists', 'such', 'Chaney', 'instance', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'guess', 'just', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'Let', 'instead', 'enjoy', 'package', 'have', 'here', 'offering', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Ace', 'Hearts', 'providing', 'rather', 'lame', 'start', 'box', 'set', 'contains', 'two', 'really', 'exciting', 'displays', 'Chaney', 'unbelievable', 'talent', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'deeply', 'romantic', 'story', 'Chaney', 'acting', 'too', 'old', 'hence', 'unwanted', 'lover', 'young', 'artist', 'movie', 'rather', 'simple', 'plot', 'same', 'time', 'due', 'Chaney', 'amazing', 'acting', 'qualities', 'truly', 'touching', 'story', 'brought', 'screen', 'today', 'would', 'still', 'find', 'audience.The', 'Unknown', 'last', 'doubt', 'best', 'movie', 'three', 'story', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'am', 'talking', 'bizarre', 'blood', 'stained', 'movies', 'such', 'Saw', 'alike', 'should', 'thrill', 'genre', 'fans', 'bizarre', 'not', 'sadistic', 'contents', 'ACTING', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'Chaney', 'alone', 'twisted', 'plot', 'sideshow', 'artist', 'become', 'cripple', 'love', 'life', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'so', 'are', 'cinema', 'bizarre', 'cinema', 'great', 'acting', 'performances', 'better', 'sink', 'teeth', 'one']",N/A
769951,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0000B1O9L,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[11, 12]","This is an EXCELLENT set of Lon Chaney DVDs! All I will say about the three wonderful features here is that unlike most silent films that date badly and put you to sleep, each of them will draw you in until you can't stop watching them until they're over. Great stories and Chaney in my opinion was the KING of ""method acting.""The DVD of the Chaney documentary is a great way to learn more about the master after wathcing the three of these films. Look out for the extremely rare clip from ""The Miracle Man"" (1919). Most of that film remains lost, unfortuantely.However, the still photographic reporduction of the lost ""London After Midnight"" is a bit much. In this day of computer graphic animation, this could have been done better (hint for possible future packaging).But in either case, watch and enjoy the works of the master. After this, check out DVDs of ""Sparrows,"" ""The Penalty,"" ""The Hunchback,"" and ""The Phantom"" (provided you get one with the color footage). Hopefully, ""Zanzibar"" and ""He Who Gets Slapped""  as well as the sound and silent versions of ""The Unholy 3"" will soon make it on to DVD.

769952,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0000B1O9L,Anyechka,"[27, 28]","Contained in this wonderful collection are the films 'The Ace of Hearts' (1921), 'The Unknown' (1927), and 'Laugh, Clown, Laugh' (1928), together with an awesome documentary about Lon's life and career (with ample film clips), a 40-minute stills and intertitle recreation of 'London After Midnight' (1927), audio commentaries by Michael Blake, Lon Chaney's definitive biographer, photo galleries, introductions to the films by TCM host Robert Osbourne, and a featurette on the composers who have won TCM's now-annual Young Film Composers contest.  Two of those silents that were selected to have new scores written for them by the winners were 'The Ace of Hearts' and 'Laugh, Clown, Laugh.''The Ace of Hearts' was the first of Lon's films I ever saw, and even though it's not really the height of greatness, it did make me into a big fan.  The origins and purpose of this secret society which Lon belongs to are never really explained (we just have a vague idea of their purpose), and the plot was also a bit of a mystery.  However, as curious and under-par though this film might be, Lon totally steals the show.  He just *looked* like an actor, and lived up to all of the great things I'd heard about what a wonderful actor he was.  I was really impressed by his body language and facial expressions, and how he just inspired such sympathy in the audience, wanting him to be the one to get the girl (the beautiful Leatrice Joy) and to have a happy ending.'The Unknown' is bizarre, to say the least.  It was directed by Tod Browning, his favorite director, who did a lot of macabre disturbing unconventional pictures like this.  It also seems as though there's some footage missing from this one, at only about 50 minutes long, added to the fact that it was only available in murky 9.5 mm black market copies until 1968, when it was discovered, along with some other films, in France, in cans labeled ""l'inconnu"" (i.e., ""unknown"").  What remains is really good, however.  Alonzo is a supposedly armless knife thrower in love with his beautiful assistant Nanon (Joan Crawford), who is afraid and distrustful of men with arms.  We're never really told just why she's so afraid of a man who could put his arms around her, but one suspects that she was raped or abused in the past.  However, as we come to find out, Alonzo does have his arms, only he's hiding them so that Nanon will love and trust him.  He's also hiding them because he has double thumbs, and the police are looking for him for some crimes he's committed, knowing only that it was a man with the same condition.  Things take a turn for the worst when Nanon sees him from the back strangling her father (though luckily she doesn't see his face), and the life-altering decision Alonzo makes is not only incredibly disturbing, unthinkable, and creepy, but also leaves the door open for the handsome strong man in their travelling circus, Malabar (Norman Kerry), to move in on Nanon, who has always pushed away his romantic overtures.  When Alonzo comes back to the circus after taking care of his bizarre business, things get even creepier.  Once again Lon makes you feel sympathy for this strange character, someone you'd ordinarily feel repulsed and horrified by.'Laugh, Clown, Laugh' is a truly touching and heartbreaking film, and came out in the last really great year for silents, by which time the artform had truly reached its peak and been beautifully perfected.  It is rather disturbing how Lon's character, Tito the clown, develops romantic feelings for Simonetta (Loretta Young) when she becomes a young woman, even though he and his partner Simon have been raising her as practically their own daughter since they found her abandoned when she was just a toddler, but you get the feeling that deep down he realises how wrong and foolish these feelings are, not only because she's like a daughter to him, but also because he's an older man, and doesn't have anything to promise her the way her much younger and more handsome suitor Count Luigi (Nils Asther) does.  A famous story about the filming of this movie is that the director, Herbert Brenon, was often quite rude and mean to Loretta Young, who was just a teenager at the time and barely starting her career.  However, he was always civil to her whenever Lon was around, and after he picked up on this, he was with her constantly, even when they were shooting scenes he didn't appear in, guiding, directing, and mentoring her, and protecting her from the abusive director.The stills recreation of 'London After Midnight' is alright, but doesn't really deliver a big punch due to the lack of actual film footage that might speed the story along better or make it seem more compelling and interesting.  If only there had been even some surviving footage to pad out the stills with, as in the recreations of 'The Young Rajah' and the four-hour version of 'Greed.'  This film has long been among the holy grail of missing silents, ever since the last known surviving print was destroyed by a vault fire at MGM in 1967.  However, people who saw it in its original run and even as ""recently"" as the Fifties or Sixties have usually been quoted as saying that it wasn't all that great, and that the people so desperate to find it would probably feel the same way if they had had a chance to see it.  Perhaps this is a classic case of something being elevated to high status due to the reputations of Chaney and Browning and the fact that it's lost and no longer able to be judged on its true merits.  As sad as it is that an overwhelming amount of silents were lost, both within their own lifetimes and in the ensuing decades, not all lost films were great works of art that modern-day people would be really impressed by and enamoured of.  Just like with modern-day movies, most silents too were just fun lightweight date movies or something for a rainy day, not epic timeless classic masterpieces or movies that are so good you want to watch them over and over again.Overall, this is a great collection.  Lon was great in every film he was in, even lacklustre efforts.  His mere presence could elevate something that would have appeared only ordinary or even bad had some other actor been in it.  His growing up with Deaf-mute parents played a big part in how he was so skilled at pantomimic acting, in making the viewer feel sympathy and empathy with characters whom they ordinarily would have walked on by or spat on in disgust or fear, and the stories about how he had keen empathy in real life for people who were different are also legendary.  This small sampling of films is compelling proof of just why he was one of the 20th century's greatest male film actors.",5,When was Lon NOT great?,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,6693,"['Contained',

769954,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B0000B1O9L,Brad Baker,"[57, 61]","Warner Home Video has just released the 2-disc DVD &quot;Lon Chaney Collection&quot;; 3 complete films, scene selections, photo galleries, audio commentaries by Michael Blake, and an intimate Chaney documentary. The first film is Goldwyn Pictures' 1921 &quot;Ace of Hearts&quot;, with Chaney at the center of a vigilante secret society. The second movie is MGM's macabre 1927 masterpiece &quot;The Unknown&quot;, directed by Tod Browning. Chaney stars as a deranged carnival knife-thrower who sacrifices his human limbs to enter the arms of the young girl he loves. Co-starring is 23-year-old Joan Crawford.  &quot;The Unknown&quot; was thought to be a lost film for many years.  In the early 1970's, Cinematheque Francaise discovered metal cans containing unidentified reels of film. The canisters were marked &quot;L'Inconnu&quot;, French for &quot;Unknown&quot;. The third is MGM's 1928 &quot;Laugh, Clown, Laugh&quot;, a mesmerizing love story with Chaney as Tito, a jovial circus performer. Tito finds a young baby girl by the river's edge(abandoned by her parents), and adopts the tiny waif as his own. This begins his life-long love of the girl, then the woman, known simply as Simonetta. Chaney's anguished portrait of the aging clown, transfixed by a lovely young woman, is charismatic and eloquent. Simonetta is played by an enchanting 15-year-old Loretta Young.  &quot;Laugh, Clown, Laugh&quot; has never been released on video or DVD before. It was first seen on TV in 2002 on TCM cable. If you have never seen this film, I envy the pleasure you are about to enjoy.  You also receive the photo gallery/continuity-script recreation of 1927's &quot;London After Midnight&quot;.  After 1930, the negative and print of &quot;London After Midnight&quot; was stored away in vault 7 at MGM. The print, still in good shape, was viewed along with Tod Browning's sound re-make, &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;, in 1935. The last known record of the film was in a note in the studio files in 1955. Twenty years later, a fire in vault 7, caused by ignition of improperly stored nitrate film, destroyed the last known print and original negative. &quot;London After Midnight&quot; is the most famous &quot;lost film&quot; of all time. Born into poverty, the object of ridicule(his parents were deaf and dumb), Lon Chaney perservered. Juggling low-paying jobs and a new son, his first wife attempted suicide in 1913. The scandal collapsed Chaney's theater career, and he started over in the fledging L.A. movie business. Chaney would eventually triumph, transforming misfortune into a series of radiant, elegant silent film roles.  In 1930, Chaney signed for his first sound movie, unaware that it would prove to be his last. Already afflicted with the lung cancer that would kill him, he starred in &quot;The Unholy Three&quot;. Chaney finally speaks to his adoring fans. Chaney portrays a convicted jewel thief, and in the final reel, says goodbye to his girl. He cracks a joke. Suddenly the girl cannot control her joy. Should she laugh or cry? Chaney reminds her: &quot;Why don't you do a little bit of both? You know the gag. That's all there is to life. Just a little laugh, a little tear...&quot;",5,"Laugh, Clown, Laugh....Even though your heart is breaking",1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,3201,"['Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'just', 'released', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Collection', 'quot', '3', 'complete', 'films', 'scene', 'selections', 'photo', 'galleries', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Michael', 'Blake', 'intimate', 'Chaney', 'documentary', 'first', 'film', 'Goldwyn', 'Pictures', '1921', 'quot', 'Ace', 'Hearts', 'quot', 'Chaney', 'center', 'vigilante', 'secret', 'society', 'second', 'movie', 'MGM', 'macabre', '1927', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Unknown', 'quot', 'directed', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Chaney', 'deranged', 'carnival', 'knife-thrower', 'who', 'human', 'limbs', 'enter', 'arms', 'young', 'girl', 'Co-starring', '23-year-old', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'quot', 'Unknown', 'quot', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'lost', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'early', '1970', 'Cinematheque', 'Francaise', 'discovered', 'metal', 'cans', 'containing', 'unidentified', 'reels', 'film', 'canisters', 'were', 'marked', 'quot', ""L'Inconnu"", 'quot', 'French', 'quot', 'Unknown', 'quot', 'third', 'MGM', '1928', 'quot', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'quot', 'mesmerizing', 'love', 'story', 'Chaney', 'Tito', 'jovial', 'circus', 'performer', 'Tito', 'young', 'baby', 'girl', 'river', 'edge', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'tiny', 'waif', 'own', 'life-long', 'love', 'girl', 'then', 'woman', 'known', 'simply', 'Simonetta', 'Chaney', 'anguished', 'portrait', 'aging', 'clown', 'transfixed', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'charismatic', 'eloquent', 'Simonetta', 'played', 'enchanting', '15-year-old', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'quot', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'quot', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'video', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'seen', 'TV', '2002', 'TCM', 'cable', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'envy', 'pleasure', 'are', 'enjoy', 'also', 'receive', 'photo', 'gallery/continuity-script', 'recreation', '1927', 'quot', 'London', 'Midnight', 'quot', '1930', 'negative', 'print', 'quot', 'London', 'Midnight', 'quot', 'was', 'stored', 'away', 'vault', '7', 'MGM', 'print', 'still', 'good', 'shape', 'was', 'viewed', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'sound', 're-make', 'quot', 'Mark', 'Vampire', 'quot', '1935', 'last', 'known', 'record', 'film', 'was', 'note', 'studio', 'files', '1955', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'fire', 'vault', '7', 'caused', 'ignition', 'improperly', 'stored', 'nitrate', 'film', 'destroyed', 'last', 'known', 'print', 'original', 'negative', 'quot', 'London', 'Midnight', 'quot', 'most', 'famous', 'quot', 'lost', 'film', 'quot', 'time', 'Born', 'poverty', 'object', 'ridicule', 'parents', 'were', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'perservered', 'Juggling', 'low-paying', 'jobs', 'new', 'son', 'first', 'wife', 'attempted', 'suicide', '1913', 'scandal', 'collapsed', 'Chaney', 'theater', 'career', 'started', 'over', 'fledging', 'L.A.', 'movie', 'business', 'Chaney', 'would', 'eventually', 'triumph', 'transforming', 'misfortune', 'series', 'radiant', 'elegant', 'silent', 'film', 'roles', '1930', 'Chaney', 'signed', 'first', 'sound', 'movie', 'unaware', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'last', 'Already', 'afflicted', 'lung', 'cancer', 'would', 'kill', 'starred', 'quot', 'Unholy', 'Three', 'quot', 'Chaney', 'finally', 'adoring', 'fans', 'Chaney', 'convicted', 'jewel', 'thief', 'final', 'reel', 'goodbye', 'girl', 'joke', 'Suddenly', 'girl', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'joy', 'Should', 'laugh', 'cry', 'Chaney', 'quot', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'know', 'gag', 'life', 'Just', 'little', 'laugh', 'little', 'tear', 'quot']",N/A
769955,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000B1O9L,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","Most people associate Lon Chaney as a star of horror films, but he was much more than that. This collection offers three of Chaney's films with commentary, a stills recreation of the lost film ""London after Midnight"", and a documentary on Chaney's life and work.The oldest film in the bunch, ""Ace of Hearts"", was directed by Wallace Worsley, the same man who directed Chaney in the more famous ""The Penalty"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". Here Chaney is the member of a group of men who decide that a certain prominent man poses a threat to society and thus has ""lived too long"". They draw cards to decide who will do the deed. Both Chaney and the man who draws the ace of hearts - indicating he is chosen - are in love with Lillith, another member of the group. This is a straight dramatic role for Chaney, and a pretty good film. Outside of his longer hair, which the commentator said was unusual for the times, there is nothing out of the ordinary about his appearance. There is some overacting by all of the players, which is probably due to direction.""Laugh Clown Laugh"" has Chaney playing an Italian clown who finds a baby girl in the forest. He names her Simonetta, and cares for her as a father. However, when she grows up, Chaney begins to love her as a woman. He is unable to tell her because of his role as father figure in her life. As a result he cannot stop crying. A wealthy young man cares for her too, as a result of his love he cannot stop laughing. This film is somewhat similar to ""He Who Gets Slapped"" as far as Chaney being the man who sacrifices everything for love when he realizes the girl loves someone else.The best film is ""The Unknown"". Here you get a view of Chaney the villain and the man of a thousand bodies. He is Alonzo the Armless, a performer in a circus, in love with the circus owner's daughter, Nanon (Joan Crawford). He actually does have arms. He is just hiding them for the purpose of hiding from the police, since he is a criminal who is known to have two thumbs on one hand. Naturally, nobody is going to suspect an armless man. Nanon feels safe with Alonzo since she hates having men put their arms around her. How far will Alonzo go to gain Nanon? This film is directed by Tod Browning, who worked so well with Chaney.The stills recreation of the lost film ""London After Midnight"" was done quite well with very good atmospheric music added. Chaney's vampire does look a little unconventional though, and it's too bad we have not even clips of this one since some people who actually saw the movie said that the most unusual thing about Lon Chaney's vampire was his walk. Apparently it was much like Groucho Marx' famous gait. That's something that stills, no matter how well presented, just can't communicate. One thing I noted after viewing - the plot for 1935's ""The Mark of the Vampire"" was almost completely lifted from this film. Both were directed by Tod Browning.The commentary on all of the films are very good, and so is the extensive documentary on Chaney's life. There are more Chaney films in control of WHV that I would also like to see put on DVD - most notably ""Tell it to the Marines"", which was Chaney's favorite film and one that got him made an honorary marine. As the documentary stated, Chaney's popularity with movie audiences is hard to figure. Undoubtedly he had talent, but he was not a particularly good looking leading man in a conventional sense. His power at the box office probably had something to do with his ability to gain empathy from the audience no matter what role he took on, no matter how disfigured, no matter how villainous.",5,A good first look at Lon Chaney's work,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,3617,"['Most', 'people', 'associate', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'star', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'collection', 'three', 'Chaney', 'films', 'commentary', 'stills', 'recreation', 'lost', 'film', 'London', 'Midnight', 'documentary', 'Chaney', 'life', 'work.The', 'oldest', 'film', 'bunch', 'Ace', 'Hearts', 'was', 'directed', 'Wallace', 'Worsley', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'Chaney', 'more', 'famous', 'Penalty', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Here', 'Chaney', 'member', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'decide', 'certain', 'prominent', 'man', 'threat', 'society', 'thus', 'lived', 'too', 'long', 'draw', 'cards', 'decide', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'deed', 'Chaney', 'man', 'who', 'ace', 'hearts', 'indicating', 'chosen', 'are', 'love', 'Lillith', 'member', 'group', 'straight', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Chaney', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'longer', 'hair', 'commentator', 'said', 'was', 'unusual', 'times', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'appearance', 'overacting', 'players', 'probably', 'due', 'direction', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'Chaney', 'playing', 'Italian', 'clown', 'who', 'baby', 'girl', 'forest', 'Simonetta', 'cares', 'father', 'However', 'when', 'up', 'Chaney', 'love', 'woman', 'unable', 'tell', 'role', 'father', 'figure', 'life', 'result', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'crying', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'too', 'result', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'film', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Who', 'Slapped', 'as', 'far', 'Chaney', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'love', 'when', 'girl', 'someone', 'else.The', 'best', 'film', 'Unknown', 'Here', 'get', 'view', 'Chaney', 'villain', 'man', 'thousand', 'bodies', 'Armless', 'performer', 'circus', 'love', 'circus', 'owner', 'daughter', 'Nanon', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'actually', 'have', 'arms', 'just', 'hiding', 'purpose', 'hiding', 'police', 'criminal', 'who', 'known', 'have', 'two', 'thumbs', 'one', 'hand', 'Naturally', 'nobody', 'going', 'suspect', 'armless', 'man', 'Nanon', 'feels', 'safe', 'Alonzo', 'having', 'men', 'put', 'arms', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'Alonzo', 'go', 'gain', 'Nanon', 'film', 'directed', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Chaney.The', 'stills', 'recreation', 'lost', 'film', 'London', 'Midnight', 'was', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'atmospheric', 'music', 'added', 'Chaney', 'vampire', 'look', 'little', 'unconventional', 'too', 'bad', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'clips', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'saw', 'movie', 'said', 'most', 'unusual', 'thing', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'vampire', 'was', 'walk', 'Apparently', 'was', 'much', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'famous', 'gait', 'something', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'presented', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'One', 'thing', 'noted', 'viewing', 'plot', '1935', 'Mark', 'Vampire', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'lifted', 'film', 'were', 'directed', 'Tod', 'Browning.The', 'commentary', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'extensive', 'documentary', 'Chaney', 'life', 'are', 'more', 'Chaney', 'films', 'control', 'WHV', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'see', 'put', 'DVD', 'most', 'notably', 'Tell', 'Marines', 'was', 'Chaney', 'favorite', 'film', 'one', 'got', 'made', 'honorary', 'marine', 'documentary', 'stated', 'Chaney', 'popularity', 'movie', 'audiences', 'hard', 'figure', 'Undoubtedly', 'had', 'talent', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'looking', 'leading', 'man', 'conventional', 'sense', 'power', 'box', 'office', 'probably', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'ability', 'gain', 'empathy', 'audience', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'took', 'matter', 'how', 'disfigured', 'matter', 'how', 'villainous']",N/A

Start first with the British documentary on Chaney narrated by Kenneth Brannagh to give yourself some background.The first movie to watch is LAUGH CLOWN LAUGH (reportedly Chaney's favorite among his films) which ably demonstrates his ability to convey deeply felt emotions by the use of his body language and without heavy make-up although he does wear clown make-up at the end. Also the 15 year old Loretta Young is remarkable in her feature film debut. Follow that with THE ACE OF HEARTS which is the weakest of the three but still a pretty good film that allows Chaney the opportunity to shine in a fascinating storyline that is still of interest today. Save Tod Browning's THE UNKNOWN for last as it is truly a one of a kind film that will stay with you long after it's over. Chaney plays an armless knife thrower who isn't really armless while a young Joan Crawford has a phobia about being touched. Even more bizarre than it sounds with vivid performances and an astonishing visual composition. Each movie is taken from the best available source material and comes with a newly recorded score composed specifically for each film. View the other supplements whenever you choose to get a fully rounded picture of this incredible talent.All in all a remarkable set at a good price. Like the PHANTOM and METROPOLIS DVD's released earlier this year, this is how it should be done. Hopefully Turner Classic Movies can now turn their attention to the other classic M-G-M silents in their library (BEN HUR, GREED, THE BIG PARADE, THE WIND) and release them as well. For the next deluxe package how about ""The Greta Garbo Collection"". Thanks to efforts like this, the art of the silent film is alive and well and being passed on to a new generation of film lovers.",5,"An Ideal Introduction To ""The Man Of A Thousand Faces"".",1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,1983,"['who', 'only', 'know', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Phantom', 'Quasimodo', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'collection', 'ideal', 'introduction', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'artists', 'ever', 'step', 'front', 'camera', 'Start', 'first', 'British', 'documentary', 'Chaney', 'narrated', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'give', 'background.The', 'first', 'movie', 'watch', 'LAUGH', 'CLOWN', 'LAUGH', 'reportedly', 'Chaney', 'favorite', 'films', 'ably', 'ability', 'convey', 'deeply', 'felt', 'emotions', 'use', 'body', 'language', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'wear', 'clown', 'make-up', 'end', 'Also', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'remarkable', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Follow', 'ACE', 'OF', 'HEARTS', 'weakest', 'three', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'Chaney', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'fascinating', 'storyline', 'still', 'interest', 'today', 'Save', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'THE', 'UNKNOWN', 'last', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'over', 'Chaney', 'armless', 'knife', 'thrower', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'armless', 'young', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'phobia', 'being', 'touched', 'Even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'vivid', 'performances', 'astonishing', 'visual', 'composition', 'movie', 'taken', 'best', 'available', 'source', 'material', 'newly', 'recorded', 'score', 'composed', 'specifically', 'film', 'View', 'other', 'supplements', 'choose', 'get', 'fully', 'rounded', 'picture', 'incredible', 'talent.All', 'remarkable', 'set', 'good', 'price', 'PHANTOM', 'METROPOLIS', 'DVD', 'released', 'earlier', 'year', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'Hopefully', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'can', 'now', 'turn', 'attention', 'other', 'classic', 'M-G-M', 'silents', 'library', 'BEN', 'HUR', 'GREED', 'THE', 'BIG', 'PARADE', 'THE', 'WIND', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'deluxe', 'package', 'how', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Collection', 'Thanks', 'efforts', 'art', 'silent', 'film', 'alive', 'well', 'being', 'passed', 'new', 'generation', 'film', 'lovers']",N/A
769957,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B0000B1O9L,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[6, 7]","In 1883 Leonidas Chaney was born in Colorado Springs, however the world would come to know him as Lon Chaney. Lon Chaney was one of the great American performers during the era of silent filmmaking. His success was due in part to the fact that he was extraordinarily skilled in his creation and application of makeup and prosthetics. But Chaney was more than just a great makeup artist. He was a highly expressive actor who utilized his entire body to create memorable characters. Though he is remembered mainly for his roles in early horror films, Chaney actually starred in films from many genres ranging from horror to westerns, from comedies to melodramas. When he died in 1930, at the age of 47, he left a gap in the industry that would never be filled.The Ace of Hearts - 1921 (Newly scored by Vivek Maddala)A group of political dissidents target a powerful capitalist and whoever draws the Ace of Hearts will be the assassin. When the cards are dealt, Farallone (Chaney) watches in horror as his rival, Forrest is given the honor of being the assassin. But soon Farallone realizes that he has less to live for while the woman he loves, Lilith, has promised herself to Forrest. Farallone chooses to sacrifice himself so that the two lovers may be together.The Unknown - 1927Lon Chaney plays Alonzo, a knife throwing circus performer who supposedly has no arms (he throws the knives with his feet). In actuality he hides his arms because he has two thumbs on his left hand and this would identify him as the killer the police are looking for. Joan Crawford plays Nanon, Alonzo's beautiful assistant and the daughter of the circus owner. She has an unusual fear of being handled by men, which leads Alonzo to believe that she might fall in love with him. But one night he gets into a fight with the circus owner and strangles him. Nanon witnesses the crime but never sees the killer's face, only the two thumbs on his left hand. Alonzo decides to bribe a surgeon into amputating his arms and as he's already learned to use his feet to perform daily activities, he won't need them. The surgeon is forced to cooperate. When Alonzo returns to announce his love to Nanon, he finds that she's become engaged to the circus strongman, Malabar. The realization that he's had his arms cut off for nothing drives him into a murderous frenzy. He plots revenge on the two lovers. This strangely engaging film was directed by Tod Browning (Dracula&Freaks).Laugh, Clown, Laugh - 1928 (Newly scored by H. Scott Salinas)Chaney plays Tito, a clown who falls in love with Simonetta, the abandoned girl that he raised (Loretta Young). But she only views him as a father figure, which breaks his heart. When she falls in love with a handsome young aristocrat, Tito is left distraught with only a clown's painted-on smile to hide his anguish.London After Midnight - 1927This is a photographic reconstruction of a lost film about a detective who poses as a vampire in order to uncover a murderous plot. This film was later remade asMark of the Vampirestarring B&eacute;la Lugosi and directed by Tod Browning.This spectacular set includes the following bonus features:Three audio commentaries by Chaney biographer Michael F. Blake, photo galleries for each film, a great documentary about Chaney's life and career, two featurettes about the composers who created the new scores for Ace of Hearts and Laugh, Clown, Laugh.TCM Archives produced this terrific 2-disc set and as always Turner Classic Movies proves themselves to be a central force in the preservation and presentation of classic films. This set is a must-have for silent film enthusiasts and Chaney fans alike.Also recommended:A Thousand Faces: Lon Chaney's Unique Artistry in Motion PicturesLon Chaney: The Man Behind the Thousand FacesThe Films of Lon ChaneyThe PenaltyThe Hunchback Of Notre DameThe Phantom of the Opera",4,The Man of a Thousand Faces,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,3865,"['1883', 'Leonidas', 'Chaney', 'was', 'born', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'however', 'world', 'would', 'come', 'know', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'performers', 'era', 'silent', 'filmmaking', 'success', 'was', 'due', 'part', 'fact', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'skilled', 'creation', 'application', 'makeup', 'prosthetics', 'Chaney', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'great', 'makeup', 'artist', 'was', 'highly', 'expressive', 'actor', 'who', 'utilized', 'entire', 'body', 'create', 'memorable', 'characters', 'remembered', 'mainly', 'roles', 'early', 'horror', 'films', 'Chaney', 'actually', 'starred', 'films', 'many', 'genres', 'ranging', 'horror', 'westerns', 'comedies', 'melodramas', 'When', 'died', '1930', 'age', '47', 'left', 'gap', 'industry', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'filled.The', 'Ace', 'Hearts', '1921', 'Newly', 'scored', 'Vivek', 'Maddala', 'A', 'group', 'political', 'dissidents', 'target', 'powerful', 'capitalist', 'Ace', 'Hearts', 'will', 'be', 'assassin', 'When', 'cards', 'are', 'dealt', 'Farallone', 'Chaney', 'watches', 'horror', 'rival', 'Forrest', 'given', 'honor', 'being', 'assassin', 'soon', 'Farallone', 'less', 'live', 'woman', 'Lilith', 'promised', 'Forrest', 'Farallone', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'two', 'lovers', 'may', 'be', 'together.The', 'Unknown', '1927Lon', 'Chaney', 'plays', 'Alonzo', 'knife', 'throwing', 'circus', 'performer', 'who', 'supposedly', 'arms', 'knives', 'feet', 'actuality', 'arms', 'two', 'thumbs', 'left', 'hand', 'would', 'identify', 'killer', 'police', 'are', 'looking', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Nanon', 'Alonzo', 'beautiful', 'assistant', 'daughter', 'circus', 'owner', 'unusual', 'fear', 'being', 'handled', 'men', 'Alonzo', 'believe', 'might', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'night', 'fight', 'circus', 'owner', 'Nanon', 'crime', 'never', 'killer', 'face', 'only', 'two', 'thumbs', 'left', 'hand', 'Alonzo', 'bribe', 'surgeon', 'amputating', 'arms', 'already', 'learned', 'use', 'feet', 'perform', 'daily', 'activities', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'surgeon', 'forced', 'cooperate', 'When', 'Alonzo', 'announce', 'love', 'Nanon', 'become', 'engaged', 'circus', 'strongman', 'Malabar', 'realization', 'had', 'arms', 'cut', 'off', 'nothing', 'drives', 'murderous', 'frenzy', 'revenge', 'two', 'lovers', 'strangely', 'engaging', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Dracula', 'Freaks', '.Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', '1928', 'Newly', 'scored', 'H.', 'Scott', 'Salinas', 'Chaney', 'Tito', 'clown', 'who', 'love', 'Simonetta', 'abandoned', 'girl', 'raised', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'only', 'father', 'figure', 'heart', 'When', 'love', 'handsome', 'young', 'aristocrat', 'Tito', 'left', 'distraught', 'only', 'clown', 'painted-on', 'smile', 'hide', 'anguish.London', 'Midnight', '1927This', 'photographic', 'reconstruction', 'lost', 'film', 'detective', 'who', 'vampire', 'order', 'uncover', 'murderous', 'plot', 'film', 'was', 'later', 'remade', 'asMark', 'Vampirestarring', 'B', 'eacute', 'Lugosi', 'directed', 'Tod', 'Browning.This', 'spectacular', 'set', 'following', 'bonus', 'features', 'Three', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Chaney', 'biographer', 'Michael', 'F.', 'Blake', 'photo', 'galleries', 'film', 'great', 'documentary', 'Chaney', 'life', 'career', 'two', 'featurettes', 'composers', 'who', 'created', 'new', 'scores', 'Ace', 'Hearts', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh.TCM', 'Archives', 'produced', 'terrific', '2-disc', 'set', 'always', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'be', 'central', 'force', 'preservation', 'presentation', 'classic', 'films', 'set', 'must-have', 'silent', 'film', 'enthusiasts', 'Chaney', 'fans', 'alike.Also', 'recommended', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Unique', 'Artistry', 'Motion', 'PicturesLon', 'Chaney', 'Man', 'Thousand', 'FacesThe', 'Films', 'Lon', 'ChaneyThe', 'PenaltyThe', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'DameThe', 'Phantom', 'Opera']",N/A
769958,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B0000B1O9L,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[0, 0]","I've been working my way through this collection which includes three films from the '20's and a documentary about Lon Chaney featuring Michael Blake, probably the foremost expert on Lon Chaney.Originally purchased in 2006 and viewed at that time with the exception of London After Midnight, if you want an essential introduction to Lon Chaney this is the essential set. It is representative of three distinct characterizations that appear frequently in his films. Sure, all the characters are unique. However, they are unique because Chaney took real effort to develop his characters so they'd seem real.The earliest film, Ace of Hearts, is a film about anarchists in love. Laugh, Clown, Laugh is a somewhat off kilter love story that echoes another Chaney film He Who Gets Slapped. In this one, Chaney plays a clown that cannot laugh. A very young Loretta Young is his heartbreakingly beautiful leading lady. The documentary looks at Chaney's life and hones in on his ability to transform himself.London After Midnight, in theory but not in fact, seemingly might be the weakest link in this trio of films because it isn't exactly a film or at least not what audiences saw in December, 1927 when it premiered. In the 60's the only known copy of this film was destroyed in a fire. Preservationists reconstructed this film based on the original script, notes, and vintage stills. I had no idea what to expect, but the end results were stunning. It made me think that the mind can play odd tricks when viewing something. Between clever camera angles, self-explanatory title cards and dialogue, I felt as though I were watching a movie. This is a murder mystery/horror movie that is borderline campy but also scary enough to buy into. Possibly because this ""reconstruction"" was so well done and artistic, I think this may be my favorite film in the set.The hallmarks of a Chaney film include interesting characterizations, often complex and complicated make-up that normally obscures Chaney's normal facial features, and body transformations such as limps, ticks, and missing limbs.

769959,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B0000B1O9L,Douglas M,"[2, 2]","TCM have produced a great set of rare Lon Chaney silent films which will appeal to the Chaney fan and anyone interested in the history of the American film. The set consists of 3 films which were ""lost"" for many years so it is very special they are now available. Michael Blake is the author of 3 books about the star and provides detailed commentaries of each film. He has clearly devoted his life to Chaney's legacy and his commentaries go way beyond what is seen on the screen. Accordingly, they are very interesting but possibly jaundiced about the films' appeal 80 years later.The earliest film, from 1921, is ""Ace of Hearts"" a static and melodramatic story of a vigilante group who draw cards to select who will commit murder.  The print is fairly poor and the film suffers from a snail pace and overacting. The second film is ""The Unknown"", released in 1927. The film, we are told, is possibly the best of the partnership of the director Tod Browning and Chaney. The story is bizarre, the powerful tale of a circus performer who cuts off his arms to win the girl. Joan Crawford, in a very early role, plays the object of Chaney's love. The film follows the common theme of unrequited love which appeared in many of Chaney's films. As well as observing Chaney's art, there is excellent photography and Crawford displays a rawness which is probably much closer to who she was before she became THE Joan Crawford. The print is good. The final film is ""Laugh Clown Laugh"", apparently Chaney's own favourite of all his films. Once again, the theme is unrequited love. Chaney plays a clown who makes the public laugh while he is heartbroken inside. This time, the object of his affection is the virginal and teenage Loretta Young who displays the purity of emotion which was in all of her best performances pre 1935. The print is very good.The set also includes a reconstruction of an early version of the vampyr legend, ""London after Midnight"". This is a much coveted lost film but on the evidence of a few interviewees who saw the original film, the script and the stills, it looks like it might have been extremely melodramatic. While the reconstruction has been lovingly done, the result is static and rather boring, which is to be expected, I suppose.Both ""Laugh Clown Laugh"" and ""The Unknown"" are missing scenes but what remains preserves Chaney at the height of his powers. They demonstrate that, in fact, his reputation as a horror star is misleading. He was a character actor who changed his appearance to suit the role in the same way Charles Laughton and Paul Muni did much later. His talent for pathos is outstanding. Of the generous extras included in the set, the best may be the marvellous documentary about the star and the short films about the competitions which TCM ran to locate new scores for the films.The DVD set is excellent value.",4,Great value set for the enthusiast,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,2856,"['TCM', 'have', 'produced', 'great', 'set', 'rare', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'silent', 'films', 'will', 'appeal', 'Chaney', 'fan', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'American', 'film', 'set', '3', 'films', 'were', 'lost', 'many', 'years', 'very', 'special', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'Michael', 'Blake', 'author', '3', 'books', 'star', 'detailed', 'commentaries', 'film', 'clearly', 'devoted', 'life', 'Chaney', 'legacy', 'commentaries', 'go', 'way', 'what', 'seen', 'screen', 'Accordingly', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'possibly', 'jaundiced', 'films', 'appeal', '80', 'years', 'later.The', 'earliest', 'film', '1921', 'Ace', 'Hearts', 'static', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'vigilante', 'group', 'who', 'cards', 'select', 'who', 'will', 'commit', 'murder', 'print', 'fairly', 'poor', 'film', 'suffers', 'snail', 'pace', 'overacting', 'second', 'film', 'Unknown', 'released', '1927', 'film', 'are', 'told', 'possibly', 'best', 'partnership', 'director', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Chaney', 'story', 'bizarre', 'powerful', 'tale', 'circus', 'performer', 'who', 'arms', 'win', 'girl', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'very', 'early', 'role', 'object', 'Chaney', 'love', 'film', 'common', 'theme', 'unrequited', 'love', 'appeared', 'many', 'Chaney', 'films', 'As', 'well', 'observing', 'Chaney', 'art', 'excellent', 'photography', 'Crawford', 'rawness', 'probably', 'much', 'closer', 'who', 'was', 'became', 'THE', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'print', 'good', 'final', 'film', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'apparently', 'Chaney', 'own', 'favourite', 'films', 'Once', 'again', 'theme', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Chaney', 'clown', 'who', 'public', 'laugh', 'heartbroken', 'inside', 'time', 'object', 'affection', 'virginal', 'teenage', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'who', 'purity', 'emotion', 'was', 'best', 'performances', 'pre', '1935', 'print', 'very', 'good.The', 'set', 'also', 'reconstruction', 'early', 'version', 'vampyr', 'legend', 'London', 'Midnight', 'much', 'coveted', 'lost', 'film', 'evidence', 'few', 'interviewees', 'who', 'saw', 'original', 'film', 'script', 'stills', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'melodramatic', 'reconstruction', 'been', 'lovingly', 'done', 'result', 'static', 'rather', 'boring', 'be', 'expected', 'suppose.Both', 'Laugh', 'Clown', 'Laugh', 'Unknown', 'are', 'missing', 'scenes', 'what', 'Chaney', 'height', 'powers', 'demonstrate', 'fact', 'reputation', 'horror', 'star', 'misleading', 'was', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'changed', 'appearance', 'suit', 'role', 'same', 'way', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'did', 'much', 'later', 'talent', 'pathos', 'outstanding', 'generous', 'extras', 'included', 'set', 'best', 'may', 'be', 'marvellous', 'documentary', 'star', 'short', 'films', 'competitions', 'TCM', 'ran', 'locate', 'new', 'scores', 'films.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'excellent', 'value']",N/A

This collection, called The Lon Chaney Collection, contains three silent movie classics - The Ace of Hearts (1921), The Unknown (1927), and Laugh, Clown, Laugh (1928).  Lon Chaney got his start in acting in the early twentieth century, first performing as a clown, then progressing into silent movies, then made one sound movie in 1930.  Who can forget his fine performances in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925).  Chaney was a versatile actor and was nicknamed ""The Man of a Thousand Faces"" because of his ability to portray many different types of characters.I don't want to spoil everything by revealing the plots, so watch these classic silent movies for yourself to see how good they are.Here is my rating of these movies:The Ace of Hearts - in my opinion, the weakest of the three, but overall pretty solid.  *** starsThe Unknown - the best of the three, in my opinion.  It also stars a young Joan Crawford.  The acting is superb.  Alonzo (Lon Chaney) and Malabar (Norman Kerry) fighting over Nanon (Joan Crawford) is amusing.  I also like the 1997 musical score provided by The Alloy Orchestra.  ***** starsLaugh, Clown, Laugh - the second best of the three, but still ***** starsDisc 2, which features The Unknown, also contains a lengthy documentary on Lon Chaney.

arrived.This two disc set includes The Ace of Hearts(released Oct/21,running around 70 minutes),Laugh,Clown Laugh(released April/28 and running around 71 minutes),The Unknown(released June/27 and running around 50 minutes).Also included is Chaneys London After Midnight(released Dec/27),however being a lost film this is a recreation using stock MGM footage but mainly publicity stills.It gives one a rough idea of the films narrative.I first got onto Chaney way back when,when I was attending my silent film soirees and saw The Shock,He Who gets Slapped,The Unholy Three,The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Phantom of the Opera.There is no doubt Chaney was a master actor,never mind the makeup which was just the cherry on the cake.I have NEVER seen anyone on screen whose emotions jumped out at you and pulled you into his character like he could;he had no peers,period.The first film on tap is The Ace of Hearts,and although showing a bit too much old school melodrama at times,it has a fascinating plot which keeps you riveted from beginning to end.Chaney is a member of a secretive organization who seem to have a God complex.When they come across an entity who they believe is a menace or drag on society they take them out.To do this they draw cards and whoever gets the movies title card,that is who gets the ""honour"" of extinguishing that persons life.Lon and another member have a rival love for the only female member of the group.Lon loses out as the other man gets the ubiquitous honour of taking out someone they have deemed unacceptable.In fact both eventually marry,and Lon is torn up inside.The morning after the night before has weakened her resolve to go through with the murder by explosive,but not her new husband,who remains committed.Lon has camped outside their residence all night and confronts his rival in the morning,testing his resolve,as he leaves to do the deed.Lon returns to the group while the other goes on with his task.He is a waiter and when a younger couple who have eloped sit down at the next table he has a change of heart.He returns to the group with the news he didn't go through with the deed and HE is now #1 on the hit list.Chaney has promised his old flame he would help get the two out of their predicament,but the group will not be swayed.Chaney activates the bomb as they sit drawing cards and as ""kismet"" would have it,he draws the Ace of Hearts.There is an explosion and the couple who have fled are now free to live their lives without fear due to Chaney's sacrifice.This was Chaney on the rise as a star and he is basically just another player in an ensemble cast,but he sticks of the crowd as if he had a permanent spotlight on him constantly.Oh yes,this is a Goldwyn picture,before he joined Metro pictures.Few recall it was Goldwyn who originally had the lion at the beginning of his films.When he merged with Metro/Mayer he of course brought along his lion with him.No,I'm not lion.Laugh Clown,Laugh has Chaney as Tito the clown,later known as Flik.He has a traveling act with his brother,later known as Flak(one wonders if the ice skating European pair of Fric and Frak were inspired by this film?).They raise an orphan girl as their own,played later when grown by a 14 year old Loretta Young;called Simonetta.However Chaney has now fallen in love with her...yes,THAT way,and he becomes increasingly conflicted knowing it is wrong.He eventually seeks psychiatric help at the same time an Italian count seeks help for his affliction of uncontrollable laughter.The two decide they can help each other but the count has fallen for Simonetta also and becomes Chaney's rival,adding another dimension to his inner conflict.As the film progresses Simonetta finally realizes the real extent of Chaneys love for her.When she goes to tell the count their engagement is off Chaney's turmoil comes through once more and he decides there is only one way out for both of them.This film really showcases Chaney's acting to the nth degree and became one of his signature films and it is good to have it here in this collection.At one point his brother is urging Chaney to ""laugh,clown laugh...laugh,though your heart is aching"".Now for those in the know,the latter is a line,word for word, from Chaplin's song Smile,written in 1936 for his film Modern Times.Hmmm.The Unknown stars Chaney as an ""armless"" knife thrower in a circus act.Trouble is he is NOT armless and he is using the circus as a front for his nefarious activities in different towns the circus travels to.He is in love with a young Joan Crawford who hates being pawed by men.Chaney's rival for her affections is the strong man who slowly but surely brings her around.In the meantime Chaney resorts to extreme measures to win her love forever.He decides to have his arms really removed by a surgeon that he blackmails.After the deed is done he returns to the circus to find that his love has finally settled on the strongman and both are to be wed.The couple show Chaney their new act which involves the strongman restraining two horses on either side of him,both on treadmills.If one of them or both were to stop his arms would be ripped out.This is Chaney's chance and as the treadmills slow down Crawford sees what Chaney has done and jumps down in front of one of the horses to stop it rearing up.Chaney pushes her aside and dies under the horses hooves.The most famous scene in this film is the moment Chaney has returned to the circus after his arms have been amputated and realizes his love is marrying someone else.The range of emotion that Chaney exudes is unparallelled.This scene lives up to its hype and beyond.When Gloria Swanson tells William Holden in Sunset Boulevard""...we had faces then"",you better believe it as you watch this scene.Technically speaking the films have been remastered to their best and generally are clear and crisp.All of them have age related problems,and are mostly incomplete,but they are the best we have as of this writing,which over all is more than acceptable.Extras include two featurettes on the music scoring candidates for two of the films,commentary on the films,opening commentary by TCMs Robert Osbourne and a beautiful 85 min.documentary by silent film expert Kevin Brownlow on Chaney that you won't want to miss at all.It features many rare clips of his films and is a great primer for those just learning about the master craftsman.All in all this is a must own set of Chaney films for all of his fans and those of the silent era in general.All of the films,though mostly truncated,are mighty nice to look at and a testament to the man of a thousand faces and his peerless acting ability.They do NOT make 'em like Chaney anymore...and we are the poorer for it.",5,Three must owns of a master craftsman of the Silent era,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,6859,"['Well', 'took', 'heck', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'reviewing', 'TCMs', 'release', 'Lon',

Two of the 3 films featured, ""Laugh Clown Laugh"" and ""Unknown"" certainly deserve inclusion on this set. However, ""Ace of Hearts"", while a fine Chaney performance, is an odd third choice. There were many other Chaney films that could have been included instead, such as ""Mr. Wu"", ""Unholy Three"" (sound or silent version, as both are excellent, maybe both could have been included for comparative reasons) ""Tell It to The Marines"", etc. etc. Of course, copyright limitations and/or a decent print of the above films could have played a part, but the above-mentioned films all do exist in decent shape. Anyway, the picture quality of the included films is excellent, considering their age. The photoplay of London After Midnight (unadvertised on the front cover, inexplicably) is an added treat, and probably the closest thing that we will ever have to the actual film (lost since the early 1960's). For my money, the best thing about this set is the documentary ""A Thousand Faces"" heretofore unreleased and featuring some very rare footage of Chaney, on film and in his private life. All in all,a feast for the Chaney fan. This was an artist who did not have to speak in order to portray his tragic characters, and who actually had TALENT, unlike many of today's screen faces.

769972,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B0000B1O9L,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[3, 4]","The Unknown (1927) is one of the final masterpieces of the silent film era.  Suspend disbelief and step into the carnival of the absurd.  The Unknown is the ebony carousel of the Tod Browning/Lon Chaney oeuvre, the one film in which the artists' obsessions perfectly crystallized.  This is a film uniquely of its creators' time, place and psychosis and, therefore, it is an entirely idiosyncratic work of art, which has never been remotely mimicked, nor could it be.  That it was made at MGM borders on the miraculous, or the delightfully ridiculous, but then this was an era of exploratory boundaries, even at the big studios (the risk-taking Irving Thalberg produced).""There is a story they tell in old Madrid.  The story, they say is true.""  So opens the tale of ""Alonzo, the Armless.""  Browning spins his yarn like a seasoned barker at the Big Top of a gypsy circus where ""the Sensation of Sensations! The Wonder of Wonders!,"" Alonzo (Lon Chaney), the Armless, throws knives, with his feet, at the object of his secret affection, Nanon (an 18 year old Joan Crawford).Illusions abound.  Alonzo  is actually a double-thumbed killer on the lam.  With the aid of a straight jacket and midget assistant Cojo (John George, who worked with Browning in Outside the Law 1920), Alonzo feigns his handicap and performs the facade of one mutilated.In addition to evading the law and securing employment, Alonzo's act of the armless wonder benefits him greatly.  Nanon has a hysterical, obsessive repulsion to the very touch of a man's arms.  She calls on the Almighty to take away the accursed hands of all men.  Nanon vents histrionic, sexual anxiety to Alonzo every time Malabar the Mighty (Norman Kerry) puts his vile hands upon her.  Alonzo, ever the performer, simulates expressed sympathy, although his affection for Nanon is the one thing about Alonzo that is genuine.Alonzo, secretly venting enmity, advises Malabar on how to win Nanon.  It is, of course, intentional ill-advice which will eventually karmically rebound and become genuine ill-advice for Alonzo. Malabar's arms are muscled and strong, compared to Alonzo's armless torso, or compared to Alonzo's deformed, hidden double thumb--the very same double thumb which he used to strangle the ringmaster of Browning's perverse milieu: Nanon's sadistic father, Antonio Zanzi (Nick Ruiz, hinted at being the abusive source for Nanon's hatred of a man's touch).After Alonzo swears to care for her, Nanon embraces him, to the alarm of Cojo.  The loyal Cojo fears that Nanon will discover Alonzo's  secret.  But, Alonzo must have, marry, and own Nanon, despite the fact that she hates the hands of all men, and would certainly hate the hands of the double-thumbed murderer.An alluring shot of Crawford, filmed through gauze, gives way to a mesmerizing, humorous scene of Alonzo lighting his cigarette with his feet, long after removal of the binding straight jacket beneath his coat (shades of Freaks-1932- to come). Cojo laughs at the irony.  Alonzo is perplexed.  ""Look, Alonzo, you are forgetting that you have arms!"" Aghast, Alonzo looks at the cigarette between his toes and the freed, cursed hands which keep him from possessing Nanon. Repulsed, Alonzo clutches the arms of the chair.  The revelation of his dilemma provokes a flow of maddening tears, which evolves into abject horror and gives him the terrifying answer: a a martyrdom of emasculation, all for unrequited love. ""Not that, Alonzo!"" Chaney's intense concentration obliterates all doubts. If we were not terrified, we would laugh insanely with him.Alonzo goes to see the underworld surgeon.  When the doctor inquires into Alonzo's desire, Alonzo pantomimes a slash across his shoulder. This is an amazingly acted, unsettling scene in which  Chaney's simple pantomime slash solicits genuine shock and shudder.After a long recuperation, Alonzo goes to see Nanon, who is astonished at his withered appearance, which he explains away as the result of having ""lost some flesh."" Chaney's meltdown scene has been much written about.  Burt Lancaster listed it as the greatest acting scene in all of cinema.  Chaney expresses A teary-eyed gleam,  wistful yearning, brooding, barely concealed jealousy, tragedy, hysterics, and fatigued collapse from the masochistic futility of his sacrificial mutilation all within a matter of seconds.Forced to perform yet again, Alonzo must mask his true reaction as Nanon kisses hands that she no longer fears.  Nanon unwittingly mocks Alonzo's sacrificial maiming.  Despite Alonzo's web of lies, his facade, his cruel betrayal of Cojo and maliciously plotting ghastly revenge, Chaney has our unmitigated sympathy.  Chaney makes us understand and root for the misunderstood.  God bless the freaks.  It is only fitting that Chaney, the quintessential performer, climaxes as the performer pathological.And only Tod Browning could have directed this lurid, deliriously surreal pulp melodrama/debauched  fairy tale without batting an eyelash once.  Browning's  sincerity is contagious and spellbinding during the film's brief 50 minute running time, which ends with a startling, ferociously driven, symbolic finale.For many years The Unknown was thought lost. All but 15 minutes of the film have been recovered, which may give a glimmer of  hope for those awaiting the discovery of the infamous London After Midnight (1927). This is the most sought after and discussed lost film of the silent era.  Whether it actually deserves to be the most sought after has been intensely debated, but the fact that London After Midnight is lost is solely the fault of MGM.MGM head Louis B. Mayer was something akin to the devil incarnate.  For Mayer, film was strictly profitable,  escapist fare to corn feed and increasingly dumb down audiences.  At the opposite end of the spectrum was his in-house studio competitor, producer Irving Thalberg, who nurtured the Tod Brownings and Lon Chaney s of the world.  Thalberg was hardly infallible (he sided with Mayer, against Erich von  Stroheim's 9-hour version of Greed [1925,] which resulted in the film being excised and led to an actual fistfight between Mayer and Stroheim).  However, Thalberg's concern was to make quality films, as he saw quality.  Hardly the egoist, Thalberg never took a producer's credit.  He could turn out escapist family fare, but he was eclectic in his tastes and had a penchant for edgy, risk taking films with only the side of his eye on the profit meter.Sometimes the devil wins, and when Thalberg died at the age of 37, Old Nick (Mayer) had no one to rein him in.  MGM, under Mayer, had a notorious  habit of buying out rivals--the original versions of the studio's watered-down remakes--and then would make every attempt to destroy and/or suppress the superior original.  For instance, they bought out the 1940 British version of Gaslight and unsuccessfully attempted to destroy all the copies just in time for the debut of their inferior 1944 version, starring Charles Boyer.  MGM did destroy many, but not all, copies, and understandably earned the genuine resentment of the British film industry.MGM did the same to Paramount's  superb, 1931 Academy Award winning Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to make way for their laughably bad 1941 version.  They were successful, or so they thought.  For a number of years, it was believed all copies of the 1931 Hyde had been destroyed and it was therefore a lost film, until, may years later, copies resurfaced--much to MGM's chagrin.When Tod Browning wanted to remake his London After Midnight as Mark of the Vampire in 1935, MGM did not have to go on a search-and-destroy mission, since they owned the original.  The studio saw no commercial value whatsoever in preserving a silent film, so the original was essentially buried to make way for the new version.  Predictably, it fell into neglect until some thirty years later the only remaining known copy was destroyed in a fire.  It is entirely possible that MGM intentionally destroyed multiple copies of its own film, simply to make competitive room for the remake.  Whether that remake is superior or inferior is pure speculation.In 2003, Rick Schmidlin of Turner Classic Movies arduously produced a photo still reconstruction of London After Midnight.  It is probably the only version of the film we, and future generations, will ever see.  Even from a stills-only reproduction, it is clear that Midnight is the original American Goth Film.  Chaney's vampire, partly inspired by Werner Kruass' Caligari, is a make-up artist's delight, and an actor's hell.  Fishing wire looped around his blackened eye sockets, a set of painfully inserted, shark-like teeth producing a hideous grin, a ludicrous wig under a top hat, and white pancake makeup achieved Chaney's kinky look.  To add to the effect Chaney developed a misshapen, incongruous walk for the character.  To his credit, Chaney's crepuscular rogue looks as loathsome today as it did over eighty years ago (enough so for Henry Selik to pay the character a homage in The Nightmare Before Christmas).The film, taken from Browning's story ""The Hypnotist,"" is essentially a drawing room murder mystery, with a detective hiring actors to play vampires in order to smoke out the guilty party through sheer fright.  As with most of Browning films, the plot is painstakingly preposterous, which will alienate contemporary audiences who religiously subscribe to ideas of hyper-realism.  It is the spectral ambiance and erratic characterizations which stamp the film with Browning's aberrant panache.Chaney as the vampire and Edna Tichenor as Luna, the Bat Girl are the original creepy and kooky, mysterious and spooky duo.  Chaney also plays the second role of the professor Edward C. Burke and in some of the stills he could pass for Ebenezer Scrooge.Robert Bloch (writer, Psycho-1960) saw London After Midnight in his youth and wrote of a Browning oddity in the film; the sight of armadillos scurrying across the dilapidated castle floor. It is an image we do not see in the still restoration, but Browning would repeat this surreal bit in Dracula (1931).The late William K. Everson, a reliable historian, saw both films and claimed that the 1935 remake was considerably superior.  Critics of the period disagree with Everson, holding the 1927 film as the better of the two.  London After Midnight received mixed reviews upon its release in 1927, but the majority of the reviews were positive.  Of all the Browning/Chaney films, Midnight reaped the biggest box office.In its current state, which is a remarkable, commendable effort on producer Schmidlin's part, it still is virtually impossible to compare this with the remake. what is evident is that the earlier film's production design, set in London as opposed to Prague in the remake, is superior; which is saying a quite bit since Vampire's design is, in itself,  handsomely mounted.Midnight also has fewer characters, a more minimal murder plot, is silent (an art form both Browning and Chaney were far more comfortable in) and has Lon Chaney starring, which would seem to add up to a better, overall film.* MY REVIEWS ORIGINALLY WERE PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIES",5,THE UNKNOWN & LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT: THE COLLABORATIVE WORKS
