734993,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B000087F7O,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[17, 21]","Auto Focus is a disturbing though entertaining look at the late Bob Crane (Hogan's Heroes), killed in 1978 presumably by his friend John Carpenter. Greg Kinnear gives something of a superficial take on Crane, more an imitation than a multidimensional Crane. William Dafoe however gives a disturbingly intense take on Carpenter. The 2 are depicted as 2 sex addicts during the sexual revolution of the '60s and '70s. Carpenter is the video expert on the cutting edge of new home video technology, and Bob the star who attracts the women. Little did they know how relatively commonplace these exploits would become.The on the set Hogan's Heroes recreations remind me of the Taxi recreations of ""Man in the Moon"", but watching the imitation Klink and Schultz is a bit too much to bear. And the ""Richard Dawson"" was pathetic. Anyway the film concentrates on the sex as if that was all Bob Crane was about. It kind of forgets his talent as a musician, actor, and comedian. But again the most compelling performance is Dafoe's. Especially at the end when he's cracking up, he really nails the build up of anxiety, frustration, and anger.So in the end it's worth seeing, but by NO means the definitive Bob Crane portrait.",3,John Carpenter was NOT one of Hogan's,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,1213,"['Auto', 'Focus', 'disturbing', 'entertaining', 'look', 'late', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'killed', '1978', 'presumably', 'friend', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'something', 'superficial', 'take', 'Crane', 'more', 'imitation', 'multidimensional', 'Crane', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'however', 'disturbingly', 'intense', 'take', 'Carpenter', '2', 'are', 'depicted', '2', 'sex', 'addicts', 'sexual', 'revolution', ""'60s"", ""'70s"", 'Carpenter', 'video', 'expert', 'cutting', 'edge', 'new', 'home', 'video', 'technology', 'Bob', 'star', 'who', 'women', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'relatively', 'commonplace', 'exploits', 'would', 'become.The', 'set', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'recreations', 'remind', 'Taxi', 'recreations', 'Man', 'Moon', 'watching', 'imitation', 'Klink', 'Schultz', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'was', 'pathetic', 'Anyway', 'film', 'sex', 'was', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'was', 'about', 'kind', 'forgets', 'talent', 'musician', 'actor', 'comedian', 'again', 'most', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Dafoe', 'Especially', 'end', 'when', 'cracking', 'up', 'really', 'build', 'anxiety', 'frustration', 'anger.So', 'end', 'worth', 'seeing', 'NO', 'definitive', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'portrait']",Auto Focus VHS

Hogan's Heroes and Walt Disney films).  This film goes almost to the edge of soft core [...], thus revolting the audience most likely to be interested in it.

The bonus features contain a two part documentary about Crane's murder.  They posit various theories, show actual crime scene photos, and interview investigators, witnesses, lawyers, and members of the jury.If you are looking for evening entertainment, look somewhere else.

734995,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000087F7O,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Auto Focus', a whole, feels a little half-hearted.  It gives us an overview of this man, but never really gets in deep enough to make a serious impact.  Bob Crane, the infamous star of `Hogan's Heroes' was a very different man that one may expect from his screen persona.  He was a sex-addict who threw away a normal life in hot pursuit of carnal satisfaction.  His `illness' was exploited by an equally disturbed video equipment salesman named John Carpenter.  Carpenter (at least within the confines of this film) nursed a semi-obsession with Crane and obviously lived vicariously through him (or even possibly through the girls Crane was bedding).  At the end of the day, Crane's fame was not enough to shield him from the consequences of his behavior.  Failed marriages, dive-bombs into depression and eventual death (murder) were the result of a little too much fun on the part of his scandalous man.  If you want something deep, this is not the film for you.  `Auto Focus' is a little too `focused' for that.  It doesn't give us a well-rounded idea of who Crane was, but instead focuses on the most salacious part of his life, leaving us with a narrow idea of the man.  Still, Greg Kinnear is rather remarkable in the way he engages the camera, exploding with charisma while channeling his screen character, and then perfectly depicting his turbulent emotional state.  Dafoe is always good at playing a creep, but in that effect he adds no other layer to Carpenter, making it really hard to see why Crane would befriend him in the first place; he's so unlikable.  In the end, I can't really say that I'd recommend this, but then again, Kinnear is worth the rent.",3,A little too focused...,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1669,"['Auto', 'Focus', 'whole', 'little', 'half-hearted', 'overview', 'man', 'never', 'really', 'deep', 'enough', 'make', 'serious', 'impact', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'infamous', 'star', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'man', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'screen', 'persona', 'was', 'sex-addict', 'who', 'threw', 'away', 'normal', 'life', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'carnal', 'satisfaction', 'illness', 'was', 'exploited', 'equally', 'disturbed', 'video', 'equipment', 'salesman', 'named', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Carpenter', 'least', 'confines', 'film', 'nursed', 'semi-obsession', 'Crane', 'obviously', 'lived', 'vicariously', 'even', 'possibly', 'girls', 'Crane', 'was', 'bedding', 'end', 'day', 'Crane', 'fame', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'shield', 'consequences', 'behavior', 'Failed', 'marriages', 'dive-bombs', 'depression', 'eventual', 'death', 'murder', 'were', 'result', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'part', 'scandalous', 'man', 'want', 'something', 'deep', 'not', 'film', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'little', 'too', 'focused', ""n't"", 'give', 'well-rounded', 'idea', 'who', 'Crane', 'was', 'instead', 'focuses', 'most', 'salacious', 'part', 'life', 'leaving', 'narrow', 'idea', 'man', 'Still', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'way', 'camera', 'exploding', 'charisma', 'channeling', 'screen', 'character', 'then', 'perfectly', 'depicting', 'turbulent', 'emotional', 'state', 'Dafoe', 'always', 'good', 'playing', 'creep', 'effect', 'other', 'layer', 'Carpenter', 'making', 'really', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Crane', 'would', 'befriend', 'first', 'place', 'so', 'unlikable', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'then', 'again', 'Kinnear', 'rent']",Auto Focus VHS

With a name like his, the movie is bound to create some kind of a buzz. Even though Auto Focus did not get a wide release, it still did fairly good as a limited release in select cities. While I'm at it, it's important to say that Bob Crane's family has been trying to fight this movie for quite some time, as you can see, they did not succeed. I can honestly understand why they wouldn't want this movie to see the light of the day, but I also understand how Hollywood works with juicy stories hence the making of this movie.To be quite honest, this movie would be extremely boring if it wasn't for this juicy subject matter.. what juicy matter you say? Well, it seems that if late Bob Crane has this *wild* idea to videotape himself having sex with various women across the country. I can't imagine anyone else wanting to do this (yea right), but Bob Crane did and he had a lot of fun doing it too, naturally. As interesting this story is, it seemed a bit dull because of the time period, not of the time period when it was shot but period of time that it was released in, meaning now.

I grew up watching Hogan's Heroes and I think he made an excellent Bob Crane. As for Willem Dafoe, I don't recall him ever being less than spectacular in anything I've seen. Generally when he is on camera it is impossible not to train one's eyes on him. He was a highly believable John Carpenter.What can one say about the lives these two men led? To them having sex or any other human interaction was secondary, in terms of pleasure, to watching their act as a video recording at a later date. Their proclivities make no sense to the normal person. We watch these characters with total bewilderment. The later Crane is a bit of an everyman in relation to social outcastes, however. Regardless of his talent as an actor he has separated himself from society and their mores which prevents anyone from wanting anything to do with him.

734999,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B000087F7O,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[1, 1]","Auto Focus is the story of Bob Crane, Hogan in Hogan's Heros, the 1960s show. This film is about his sexual addiction.Crane has it all but slowly loses everything--fame, money, family--to a compulsion to sleep with any women that he meets, and then tell everyone he can about it.At one point in the film, maybe one of the most revealing, his agent  tells Crane he is losing work for such exploits as showing Donna Reed sex shots.Facinating is not so much the behavior as Crane's complete lack of insight into it. Crane is compelled to wave his addiction in everyone's face, but denies he has a problem; even when him and his partner in crime pleasure themselves on the couch together watching a video of their exploits. They are in their 40s, but do this as if sharing a roast beef hero during Monday Night Football.""Sex is natural,"" he keeps saying. This was the 60s, and everyone in Hollywood knew what went on off-set; if sex was no big deal, why not shut up about it? Was Crane asking for help but too dim to know he was?Unconsiously, perhaps, but Crane by the late 1970s  is such a shallow shell--and maybe he always was--it really doesn't matter. He does stop right before he is murdered, but there is no catharsis. He only stops because he has nothing left. He is tired and old and broken but beyond the ware of addiction, he has not changed a bit.The movie documents this all well, particularly in the set design. Bright oranges and hot yellows show the excitment of the 60s, when the flings for Crane were new, and fade slowly to dull off whites as Crane also fades. Going to an LA love in at the start of the film, showing up drunk at a cooking show gig near the end.We may not get to see the innerworkings of Crane, but we do feel sorry for what is left of him.

735000,A3V4WA7SI8JUJR,B000087F7O,"Bradley O'brien ""Knight of the Woeful Contenance""","[5, 6]","Bob Crane was to borrow a current pop phrase, ""at the top of his game"" when a friendship with a shady pervert / electronics buff named John Carpenter led him into the world of ""swinging"" and amateur porn films using the forerunner of today's home video equipmt.The uncontrollable lust for porn and the sex addiction it fed were never revealed until after Crane's murder. This film and the documentary trailer tend to point to Carpenter as the perp of Crane's killing.Crane died in 1978. It is eery how even now many fans say what he did in his private life had no bearing on his public persona and his career as an actor. This seems a bit reminiscent of defenses given for a former disgraced President. Yet in no way could Bob Crane be equated with Bill Clinton at his worst.If there truly is such a thing as ""sex addiction"" Crane is its poster boy. And as the late serial killer Ted Bundy himself said, with this film we see how porn reaches out and ""wraps itself around one man's life"".I found this an interesting film. The character John Carpenter as depicted by Wm Dafoe oozed with sleaziness yet more background info about him might have lessened his villainy. We know he grew up as a poor Amercian Indian and had actually served in the military (Crane's actual wartime service--if he had any--goes unmentioned). At one party scene Carpenter the seemingly normal Korean War vet goes to fisticuffs against long-haired presumed peaceniks who question the Viet Nam war. That incident served to show how the much heralded sexual revolution of that swinging era had participants from even the pro-war, conservative ""silent majority"" which Carpenter no doubt typified.Kinnear's performance as Crane superbly depicts his descent into the swinger's life and his fetish for filming and then later viewing his sexcapades (while, we're led to assume) masturbating with good buddy Carpenter doing likewise, albeit at a ""safe distance"" from Crane.Even at the film's idyllic ""perfect family"" outset where Crane's wife (here the quite attractive Mrs Tom Hanks) confronts him about his porn stash in the garage, we see the minute cracks/fissures in Crane's persona which later metamorphasize into the pathetic, sex-obsessed twice divorced itinerant dinner theater actor. The film might have been better served with additional detail about Crane's pre-California deejay experiences and Connecticutt youth/childhood/upbringing. We know from various websites that he was a good enough percussionist to play with a symphony yet he was let go for not being ""serious enough"" about his musicianship.Having seen my own brother's marriage and family disintegrate due to infidelity, it was sad to see Crane's selfish sex pursuits alienate him from his children and wives. Even when meeting his son for a visitation, Bob apparently couldnt resist remarking about his girlfriend's looks-- to the son's chagrin. As the guest on a celebrity cooking show, his comments about a well-endowed audience member could today be standard stand-up fare served up by Dice Clay or Kennison, but seemed odd coming from a man who'd developed a wholesome clean cut persona on film and stage.The film's interview with Crane family and Scottsdale police who hamhandedly investigated his murder was an additional benefit.",4,One man's descent into a fatal addiction,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3278,"['Bob', 'Crane', 'was', 'borrow', 'current', 'pop', 'phrase', 'top', 'game', 'when', 'friendship', 'shady', 'pervert', '/', 'electronics', 'buff', 'named', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'led', 'world', 'swinging', 'amateur', 'porn', 'films', 'using', 'forerunner', 'today', 'home', 'video', 'equipmt.The', 'uncontrollable', 'lust', 'porn', 'sex', 'addiction', 'were', 'never', 'revealed', 'Crane', 'murder', 'film', 'documentary', 'trailer', 'tend', 'point', 'Carpenter', 'perp', 'Crane', 'killing.Crane', 'died', '1978', 'eery', 'how', 'even', 'now', 'many', 'fans', 'say', 'what', 'did', 'private', 'life', 'had', 'bearing', 'public', 'persona', 'career', 'actor', 'bit', 'reminiscent', 'defenses', 'given', 'former', 'disgraced', 'President', 'way', 'could', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'be', 'equated', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'worst.If', 'truly', 'such', 'thing', 'sex', 'addiction', 'Crane', 'poster', 'boy', 'late', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'said', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'porn', 'out', 'wraps', 'around', 'one', 'man', 'life', '.I', 'found', 'interesting', 'film', 'character', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'depicted', 'Wm', 'Dafoe', 'oozed', 'sleaziness', 'yet', 'more', 'background', 'info', 'might', 'have', 'lessened', 'villainy', 'know', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'Amercian', 'Indian', 'had', 'actually', 'served', 'military', 'Crane', 'actual', 'wartime', 'service', 'had', 'unmentioned', 'one', 'party', 'scene', 'Carpenter', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'fisticuffs', 'long-haired', 'presumed', 'peaceniks', 'who', 'question', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'incident', 'served', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'heralded', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'swinging', 'era', 'had', 'participants', 'even', 'pro-war', 'conservative', 'silent', 'majority', 'Carpenter', 'doubt', 'typified.Kinnear', 'performance', 'Crane', 'superbly', 'descent', 'swinger', 'life', 'fetish', 'filming', 'then', 'later', 'viewing', 'sexcapades', ""'re"", 'led', 'assume', 'masturbating', 'good', 'buddy', 'Carpenter', 'doing', 'likewise', 'albeit', 'safe', 'distance', 'Crane.Even', 'film', 'idyllic', 'perfect', 'family', 'outset', 'where', 'Crane', 'wife', 'here', 'quite', 'attractive', 'Mrs', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'porn', 'stash', 'garage', 'see', 'minute', 'Crane', 'persona', 'later', 'metamorphasize', 'pathetic', 'sex-obsessed', 'twice', 'divorced', 'itinerant', 'dinner', 'theater', 'actor', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'additional', 'detail', 'Crane', 'pre-California', 'deejay', 'experiences', 'Connecticutt', 'youth/childhood/upbringing', 'know', 'various', 'websites', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'percussionist', 'play', 'symphony', 'yet', 'was', 'let', 'go', 'not', 'being', 'serious', 'enough', 'musicianship.Having', 'seen', 'own', 'brother', 'marriage', 'family', 'disintegrate', 'due', 'infidelity', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'Crane', 'selfish', 'sex', 'pursuits', 'alienate', 'children', 'wives', 'Even', 'when', 'meeting', 'son', 'visitation', 'Bob', 'apparently', 'resist', 'remarking', 'girlfriend', 'looks', 'son', 'chagrin', 'guest', 'celebrity', 'cooking', 'show', 'comments', 'well-endowed', 'audience', 'member', 'could', 'today', 'be', 'standard', 'stand-up', 'fare', 'served', 'up', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Kennison', 'seemed', 'odd', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'developed', 'wholesome', 'clean', 'cut', 'persona', 'film', 'stage.The', 'film', 'interview', 'Crane', 'family', 'Scottsdale', 'police', 'who', 'hamhandedly', 'investigated', 'murder', 'was', 'additional', 'benefit']",Auto Focus VHS

However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life - sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.When the film opens, Bob (Greg Kinnear, in a fantastic performance) is about to hit the big time, and is a loving family man who doesn't drink or smoke. He attends mass on Sundays. One day on the set of Hogan's Heroes, though, his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a techno-guy with all the latest gadgets, including video equipment, which fascinates Crane.""Carp"" opens the door for Bob to unleash his inner desires, which both excite and frighten him. It begins innocently enough, sitting in on the drums at a strip club, but eventually Bob loses all self-control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently ""swinging."" All the while Bob refuses to admit that there's anything wrong with him; if you ask him, he'll tell you he's just a normal guy.After Hogan's Heroes came to an end, Crane took a job with a dinner theatre show, which allowed Crane and Carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show. As Crane's indiscretions get worse, his personal life deteriorates, as he divorces two wives (played by Rita Wilson and Mario Bello).Auto Focus has been expertly directed by Paul Schrader, who begins the film with bright, glossy colors, then as Crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions, the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable, just as Crane does. Kinnear gives the performance of his life, showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his life.",4,Increasingly disturbing and compelling,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,1861,"['Bob', 'Crane', 'shot', 'television', 'stardom', '1960s', 'star', 'television', 'series', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'However', 'was', 'enjoying', 'life', 'TV', 'star', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'delving', 'dark', 'territory', 'personal', 'life', 'sexual', 'promiscuity', 'deviance', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'story', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'tragic', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'dangers', 'excess.When', 'film', 'Bob', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'drink', 'smoke', 'mass', 'Sundays', 'One', 'day', 'set', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'though', 'life', 'take', 'bit', 'turn', 'when', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'techno-guy', 'latest', 'gadgets', 'including', 'video', 'equipment', 'Crane', 'Carp', 'door', 'Bob', 'unleash', 'inner', 'desires', 'excite', 'frighten', 'innocently', 'enough', 'sitting', 'drums', 'strip', 'club', 'eventually', 'Bob', 'self-control', 'up', 'making', 'pornographic', 'videos', 'exploits', 'frequently', 'swinging', 'while', 'Bob', 'admit', 'anything', 'wrong', 'ask', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'just', 'normal', 'guy.After', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'came', 'end', 'Crane', 'took', 'job', 'dinner', 'theatre', 'show', 'allowed', 'Crane', 'Carp', 'take', 'liaisons', 'traveling', 'show', 'Crane', 'indiscretions', 'get', 'worse', 'personal', 'life', 'deteriorates', 'two', 'wives', 'played', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Mario', 'Bello', '.Auto', 'Focus', 'been', 'expertly', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'who', 'film', 'bright', 'glossy', 'colors', 'then', 'Crane', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'obsessions', 'colors', 'fade', 'camera', 'unstable', 'just', 'Crane', 'Kinnear', 'performance', 'life', 'showing', 'uptight', 'man', 'who', 'afraid', 'sexual', 'demons', 'turning', 'uptight', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'life']",Auto Focus VHS
735003,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000087F7O,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","I wasn't expecting too much when I picked up `Auto Focus'.  It had received less that admirable reviews and sported a cast that included the dreadful William Dafoe, but I was pleased to see that, Dafoe aside, there really wasn't too much about this biopic I didn't like.  I didn't know anything about Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear) except that he was Hogan from `Hogan's Heroes', a show I loved as a kid.  This film of course exposes his lust for adult entertainment, showing his slow but steady decline into practice that pushed him out of two marriages and away from his very own children.Kinnear is brilliant here, truly capturing the essence that was this man with enough smug sarcasm and delightful screen presence that he seems a natural.  As was brought out by `The New Yorker', Defoe is maybe `too' creepy here to be believable, I mean who would want to be around this guy let alone sleep with him?  Maria Bello and Rita Wilson are wonderful as his two wives, Maria giving a much needed boost to the second half of this film.Crane's story is one to be told, of how something as natural as sex could turn ugly and Kinnear does so much justice to the role it's sad that he wasn't recognized more for it.  I think too many people saw this as camp when in actuality it was a very serious side of reality for this man.  While it's not for younger viewers and does contain some explicit footage, `Auto Focus' tells the story of a man we all could know because what brought him down was the same thing that all of us enjoy!",4,A tragic tale of one mans addiction...,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,1518,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'had', 'received', 'less', 'admirable', 'reviews', 'sported', 'cast', 'included', 'dreadful', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'Dafoe', 'aside', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'biopic', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'was', 'Hogan', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'show', 'loved', 'kid', 'film', 'course', 'lust', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'showing', 'slow', 'steady', 'decline', 'practice', 'pushed', 'two', 'marriages', 'away', 'very', 'own', 'children.Kinnear', 'brilliant', 'here', 'truly', 'capturing', 'essence', 'was', 'man', 'enough', 'smug', 'sarcasm', 'delightful', 'screen', 'presence', 'natural', 'was', 'brought', 'out', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Defoe', 'maybe', 'too', 'creepy', 'here', 'be', 'believable', 'mean', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'guy', 'let', 'alone', 'sleep', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'are', 'wonderful', 'two', 'wives', 'Maria', 'giving', 'much', 'needed', 'boost', 'second', 'half', 'film.Crane', 'story', 'one', 'be', 'told', 'how', 'something', 'as', 'natural', 'sex', 'could', 'turn', 'ugly', 'Kinnear', 'so', 'much', 'justice', 'role', 'sad', 'was', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'more', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'saw', 'camp', 'when', 'actuality', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'side', 'reality', 'man', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers', 'contain', 'explicit', 'footage', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'story', 'man', 'could', 'know', 'what', 'brought', 'down', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'enjoy']",Auto Focus VHS
735004,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000087F7O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 6]","I have wanted to see this film for some time now.  Who didn't love Bob Crane as Col. Hogan on Hogan's Heroes?  As a child watching the show in syndication, Crane seemed to be an exceedingly cool and funny actor.  As I got into my teens, I learned of Crane's gruesome death and the mystery surrounding it, and I had trouble figuring out how something like that could happen to such a seemingly great guy.  More time passed, and I began to hear stories about Crane's lifestyle, activities that I could hardly picture the man taking part in.  All of this left me wanting something that could put all the pieces together, to show me the true Bob Crane and place his death in its proper context.  Auto Focus attempts to do just that, and I understood that many critics praised the movie.  Having now seen it for myself, I have to agree that it is a very impressive film that works on a number of cinematic levels.  Does it answer all of my questions about Bob Crane and his death?  I don't know.  What you get with Auto Focus is one interpretation of the final fourteen years of Crane's life, but who is to say what really took place in Crane's private world.  Obviously, the man had some serious issues and flaws, enough to qualify him for the label of sick if not depraved in my book, but this movie seems to push too far, showing us private moments that no one alive today can verify or disprove.  Thus, I do not consider Auto Focus a true biographical portrait of Bob Crane, and I worry that it does further damage to a reputation the man himself seriously destroyed on his own.Auto Focus follows Crane's life and career from his disc jockey days in 1964 to his six-year run on Hogan's Heroes to the troubled years then leading up to his death.  Initially, he comes across as a clean-cut, sweater-sporting, all-around good family man, but the seeds of doubt and trouble are soon sown in his wife's discovery of pornographic magazines in the garage.  As his time on Hogan's Heroes begins, he seems to still be cultivating the image of a ""good"" man, one who refuses both alcohol and cigarettes.  Then of course fame begins to change his life, and the many young women who flock around him let his barely-contained sexual beast out of its cage. His new friendship with video technology guru John Carpenter is the worst thing that could have happened to him, as Carpenter soon gives him the keys to the perverted sexual paradise Crane had obviously fantasized about for some time.  Up to this point, Crane had still been salvageable as a decent human being, but his moral weakness soon asserts control and leads Crane into a life of total debauchery that he was shameless enough to document on film and video.  When his career bottoms out, the tailspin that would lead to his brutal demise was all too apparent.  The cinematography of the latter part of the picture was really effective; unusual, sometimes unstable camera angles and shots reinforced the image of Crane's life falling apart more and more quickly as time passed.John Carpenter was an individual I knew nothing about going into this film.  Clearly, he was a rather disgusting individual who held a strong and uncomfortable hold over the rest of Crane's life.  This film, in my opinion, goes a little too far in the direction of blaming Carpenter for Crane's mistakes, though.  It seems clear that Bob Crane alone is responsible for the way he lived his life; he never did anything more than talk about making a lifestyle change, even after the demise of two marriages, his relationship with his four children, and his total alienation from everyone but Carpenter.  The recreation of his murder is good up to a point but could have improved.  I do not think the true force and viciousness of the attack as shown matches the actual event, and I have to question why the scene showing his body's discovery by a fellow actress was deleted from the final cut.  The movie does implicate one suspect in particular, and I have to question this because, while I think the prime suspect was indeed the murderer, the film's presentation precludes alternate theories of what remains an unsolved mystery.The DVD is excellent; there can be no question about that.  Alongside the film itself, you get no less than three separate commentaries, a making-of featurette, five deleted scenes, and a lengthy documentary on the actual murder.  Greg Kinnear and Willem Dafoe are excellent in their roles of Hogan and Carpenter (although I saw much more of both men that I would have liked, if you know what I mean).  I was also amazed at how truly Klink-like Kurt Fuller was in his portrayal of Werner Klemperer.  In the final analysis, Auto Focus is an impressive motion picture, but at the same time it stands as a questionable biography and dramatization of Bob Crane's life and death.",4,An impressive but less

The unusual comedy series regarding a German POW camp was fluff and few thought otherwise.  Bob Crane portrayed the central character in a casual and easygoing manner.  He reminded no one of the great actors of his generation.  To be blunt, Director Paul Schrader's newly released movie highlights the life of someone who normally would be long forgotten.  Auto Focus depicts Bob Crane as a practicing Catholic who fails to heed his church's warning that one must shun the occasions of sin.  Crane takes one bite of the apple of temptation and is almost instantaneously unable to exercise any significant control over his sexual appetites.  One need not be a religious person to concede that Crane became a slave to passion and no longer the master over his own destiny.  There is one unavoidable fact about any form of addiction: the addict neglects the important people and other responsibilities in their life.  Bob Crane was no exception to the general rule.Greg Kinnear aptly portrays Crane as an obsessed man who strictly adhered to the motto ""a day without sex is a wasted one.""  He meets the somewhat parasitical John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe) who introduces him to the numerous females eager to sleep with a famous actor.  Both men share a common interest in taking pictures of their exploits.  This inevitably does little to aid Crane's career which is premised upon his marketed image as a clean cut all-American husband and father figure.  Crane psychologically and existentially disintegrates into a pitiful creature undeserving of respect.  We know something bad is going to happen. It's merely a question of when and where.

Ergo, neither man can speak on his own behalf concerning the validity of this film, which subsequently furnishes a vehicle for the makers of AUTO FOCUS to embellish and sensationalize to their hearts' content.Granted, it's common knowledge that Crane (Greg Kinnear) had personal problems that hampered his career following his successful run on ""Hogan's Heroes.""  And granted, video equipment guru Carpenter (Willem Dafoe) was a problematic friend of Crane's.  But when this film shows countless scenes of just the two men, alone, the viewer immediately realizes he or she is watching make-believe--nothing more.  After all, no one else was privy to Crane's and Carpenter's private conversations, arguments, or alleged confrontations, which begs the question:  Where is the integrity of this story?And I didn't find any integrity, only a warped and twisted interpretation of what director Paul Schrader ""thought"" took place.  Had AUTO FOCUS been a fictitious film--a film about a television star destroyed by his addiction to sex, aided and abetted by a sleazy friend--it would have been much more compelling.  Instead, we are asked to believe the menagerie of slimy silliness and dysfunction that allegedly took place in the life of Bob Crane.  They say the dead can't be defamed.

735012,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000087F7O,Jeffrey Leach,"[6, 6]","When I took a trip to see my relatives recently, I noticed with some interest my grandfather's fascination with old television programs. He doesn't get around as much as he once did, so he spends a lot of time parked in front of the television set watching shows on DVD. He has quite a collection. During the time I was there, he played ""Hogan's Heroes"" on a perpetual loop. I haven't seen the series in years, and most of the shows hold up pretty well. Colonel Klink's endless confusion still garners a few guffaws, Sergeant Schultz still knows nothing, and the prisoners led by the indomitable Colonel Hogan as played by Bob Crane still make the Germans look like buffoons. Of course, anyone with knowledge about Bob Crane's extracurricular activities can't really watch the show without looking for clues to the man's real nature. I'm not sure whether my grandfather knew what Bob Crane did when he wasn't filming episodes of ""Hogan's Heroes"". And you know what? I couldn't bring myself to tell him that the show he loves so much starred a man with a serious sexual addiction. I'm definitely NOT going to send him a copy of ""Auto Focus"".This movie, helmed by veteran Hollywood director Paul Schrader, examines the schizophrenic life of Bob Crane without flinching away from all the unpleasantness. We see little to worry about in the first part of the film. We learn that Crane (Greg Kinnear) has a lot going for him. He owns a wonderful home, complete with swimming pool, and has a beautiful wife named Anne (Rita Wilson). Moreover, he's got a lot of children that seem to make him happy. Our hero also has a great job as a popular disc jockey at a Los Angeles radio station. His work brings in a lot of stars who like the publicity Crane gives them. They also like Crane as a person. What's not to like? Our man comes across as one of the most affable people you would ever want to meet. He's charming to a fault, a charm that eventually helps him attain the lead role in a new television series about Allied prisoners in a German POW camp. Thus was born ""Hogan's Heroes,"" a show that went on to make Bob Crane a star and a household name. We see his ascendancy to fame and fortune in great detail here.Alas, behind the good looks and the outgoing personality, Bob Crane harbored terrible secrets. We see hints of his addiction in the first part of the film, when his gigs as a drummer in various Los Angeles nightclubs give him access to numerous beautiful women. Still, he doesn't seem out of the ordinary--a lot of guys would cheat on their wives a couple of times given the opportunity. It's when Crane meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), an electronics salesman, that his problems seem to escalate. Carpenter, a real sleaze with a craving for the celebrity lifestyle he can never have, homes in on Crane like a missile. He shows Bob a new device called a video camera, and before too long both men start prowling around town looking for women they can film during their various exploits. The two men, helped greatly by Crane's status as a television star, soon amass hundreds of videos. Women like going to bed with a star, and Crane is only too happy to oblige them. But when ""Hogan's Heroes"" goes off the air, when his personal relationships start to tank, the only thing left in our hero's life is his sick relationship with John Carpenter. Disaster will inevitably follow.""Auto Focus"" is an amazingly grim film for mainstream Hollywood. What we see here isn't pretty, not by a long shot. You only need to witness the scene between Dafoe and Kinnear, the one discussing the placement of a certain finger, to know that you're walking through a film that refuses to play nice. Watching Bob Crane deteriorate into a zombie whose only function in life revolves around sexual conquest is disturbing in the extreme, almost as disturbing as a place like Hollywood making a movie taking someone with a sexual addiction to task. Hollywood? C'mon! Half the people living there are Bob Cranes, and the other half are the ones sleeping with them. Aside from that little problem, the movie works on a number of levels. One, the acting is excellent. Willem Dafoe turns in a great performance as the scuzzy John Carpenter, and Greg Kinnear practically morphs into the deeply troubled Crane. The two had great chemistry together, and their descent into total immorality was never less than totally believable. Two, I got a kick out of the scenes recreating ""Hogan's Heroes"". Kurt Fuller playing Werner Klemperer playing Colonel Klink did an incredible job! Three, and finally, I thought the film did an amazing job recreating 1960s and 1970s Los Angeles.Expect a DVD packed with extra features. The ""Auto Focus"" disc contains three commentary tracks. One has Willem Dafoe and Greg Kinnear, another one features director Schrader, and the third has the writer and producers commenting on the film. You'll get plenty of information about all aspects of the movie if you listen to these three tracks. Good stuff! Other supplements include five deleted scenes with optional commentary from Schrader, a making of featurette, and a documentary about the death of Bob Crane called ""Murder in Scottsdale"". This last extra is a must see, as it offers up lots of information about the actor's horrific murder in an Arizona hotel and the subsequent investigations into who committed the crime. If you're in the mood for a movie that likes to walk on the dark side, pick up a copy of ""Auto Focus"".

Bob Crane was a good family man who didn't drink or smoke, but he eventually became a sex addict through the friendship of Dafoe, or at least according to the filmmakers.  Early on we see Crane in church with the family.  Later Crane tells us that people have always liked him.  The movie's main purpose, I think, was to make Crane and mid-American values suspect to charges of hypocrisy.  It's always been a favorite left-wing play to expose normalcy as hidden hypocrisy.  The best example is, of course, Death of a Salesman, but it?s been given a new coat of paint every couple of years and re-released as some new revelation.  Now having said that, I like the movie a good deal.  Kinnear was good coping with his urges and the angels of his better nature.  Dafoe brought enough subtlety to the role hat he is always just enough different to consider it acting.The DVD has an interesting documentary about the real-life murder of Crane and graphic photos of the crime scene.  The Documentary pointed out that Crane was killed away from his LA home doing dinner theatre, because he thought he was broke.  In fact, the producers of Hogan?s Heroes had been embezzling from him.  Unlike the other members of the cast, Crane actually owned 25% of the show.  By 1990, Hogans Heores was worth $90 million.

Ah, the innocence of youth.AUTO FOCUS depicts the professional self-immolation of Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear). And caused by what? Drugs? Booze? Gambling? Twinkie over-indulgence? Nope, just sex. Lots and lots of it. (Come to think of it, isn't that every teenage boy's fevered fantasy?)As the film opens, Bob is a talented, radio talk-show host on the Los Angeles airwaves. His (apparently) happy family includes a pretty wife and kids. They're devout Catholics, going to Mass every Sunday.Bob's agent (Ron Liebman) lands him the starring role as Colonel Hogan in the WWII prisoner-of-war farce, HOGAN'S HEROES. It's during this period that Bob befriends John Carpenter (William Dafoe), an obsequious salesman who haunts the studio lot trying to interest stars in the emerging technology of home video taping/playback. Bob, an avid photographer, is hooked. John, a sexual satyr, introduces Crane to his world of promiscuous women. Bob's growing fame as Col. Hogan attracts even more. For Crane, a typical night on the town with pal John soon involves having sex with multiple partners, all the action recorded with still or video cameras for Bob's later enjoyment. Crane even begins a torrid affair with the Hilda character (played here by Marla Bello) of HOGAN'S HEROES. (Remember Klink's secretary, Hilda, played in the series by Sigrid Valdis? She was a Babe.) Needless to say, Bob's marriage fails. And then things get progressively worse.Kinnear is wonderfully creepy as the self-destructive Hero who jeopardizes everything he holds dear just because he can't keep it zipped. (As Crane asserts, ""A day without sex is a day wasted."") Even then, he might have gotten away with it if he'd been the least bit discreet. But soon, the rest of the Hollywood entertainment Biz regarded him as nothing better than a porn star. And porn stars don't get ""legitimate"" gigs. Crane's only good luck was that this was pre-AIDS.Dafoe's performance as the sleazy, pimping Carpenter is chillingly good. With a friend like that, who needs enemies?Crane's sordid end in a Scottsdale hotel room remains one of Tinseltown's greatest enigmas.The film contains full-frontal female nudity, and certain scenes miss an NC-17 rating by the narrowest of margins.

Menta, Jr.","[7, 7]","Like Emilio Estevez's ""Rated X"" (about the rise of the Mitchell Brothers and their soft-core pornography empire), this is a pretty good movie about a provocative topic made better by the DVD extras that elaborate on that topic.  In this case, director Paul Schrader skillfully tells the sad story of actor Bob Crane, a personable, upbeat guy eventually brought down by an excessive interest in the seamier aspects of sex.  I liked the way the opening parts of the movie were filmed in a bright, straight-forward manner as the earlier, optimistic period of Mr. Crane's career was chronicled, but then later the camera got all jittery and the lighting muted when, his demons taking firmer hold, Mr. Crane's career and life overall became likewise shaky and dark.As good as the movie is, the generous extras on the DVD definitely make ""Auto Focus"" a must-see.  The centerpiece of the extras is an almost hour-long documentary (presented in two twenty-some minute segments) that covers every aspect of the real life case of the life and death of Bob Crane.  While the movie focuses on being entertaining and telling a good story, the documentary makes it clear what is known and not known about the case, letting the viewer decide for himself or herself what actually happened.  Together, movie and supplements, we get a thorough picture of the subject in question and the mysteries that remain.One final word: While Paul Schrader is a great artist who always tries to tell a story in an intelligent, sensitive manner, it was nevertheless nice to see in the brief making-of piece also included here that he isn't above being a showman: ""The early stuff with Hogan's Heroes and his white-bread home life was fun to film,"" he said, ""but it wasn't the good Bob that people were paying to see, it was the bad Bob.  So we tried to get to the bad Bob stuff as fast as we could.""  Somehow that was reassuring, seeing that an accomplished artist was still very concerned with giving viewers a memorable time and their money's worth.",4,"Upbeat, then seamy,  but memorable throughout",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2020,"['Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Rated', 'X', 'rise', 'Mitchell', 'Brothers', 'soft-core', 'pornography', 'empire', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'provocative', 'topic', 'made', 'better', 'DVD', 'extras', 'elaborate', 'topic', 'case', 'director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'skillfully', 'sad', 'story', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'personable', 'upbeat', 'guy', 'eventually', 'brought', 'down', 'excessive', 'interest', 'seamier', 'aspects', 'sex', 'liked', 'way', 'opening', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'filmed', 'bright', 'straight-forward', 'manner', 'earlier', 'optimistic', 'period', 'Mr.', 'Crane', 'career', 'was', 'chronicled', 'then', 'later', 'camera', 'got', 'jittery', 'lighting', 'muted', 'when', 'demons', 'taking', 'firmer', 'hold', 'Mr.', 'Crane', 'career', 'life', 'overall', 'became', 'likewise', 'shaky', 'dark.As', 'good', 'movie', 'generous', 'extras', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'make', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'must-see', 'centerpiece', 'extras', 'almost', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'presented', 'two', 'twenty-some', 'minute', 'segments', 'aspect', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'life', 'death', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'movie', 'being', 'entertaining', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'documentary', 'clear', 'what', 'known', 'not', 'known', 'case', 'letting', 'viewer', 'decide', 'actually', 'happened', 'Together', 'movie', 'supplements', 'get', 'thorough', 'picture', 'subject', 'question', 'mysteries', 'remain.One', 'final', 'word', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'great', 'artist', 'who', 'always', 'tell', 'story', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'manner', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'nice', 'see', 'brief', 'making-of', 'piece', 'also', 'included', 'here', ""n't"", 'being', 'showman', 'early', 'stuff', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'white-bread', 'home', 'life', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'Bob', 'people', 'were', 'paying', 'see', 'was', 'bad', 'Bob', 'tried', 'get', 'bad', 'Bob', 'stuff', 'as', 'fast', 'could', 'Somehow', 'was', 'reassuring', 'seeing', 'accomplished', 'artist', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'concerned', 'giving', 'viewers', 'memorable', 'time', 'money', 'worth']",Auto Focus VHS

""khouse1960""","[3, 9]","Being in the right age group to remember ""Hogan's Heroes"", and Bob Crane's murder may have made me a little less objective while viewing this film, but I really wasn't impressed.Although Greg Kinnear puts on a tour de force in his portrayal of the late, troubled actor, this movie is dragged down by its choppy writing, and lack of direction.  The plot follows (with reasonable accuracy) what has been established to be actual events, and yet it seems to leave gaping holes in the narrative.  I found myself frequently wondering if I had missed something.  The movie clocked in at 106 minutes, but maybe it would have been a fuller story if it had it been cut to a full 2 hour feature.  Willem Dafoe seemed very miscast in his role as Bob Crane's enabling partner John Carpenter.  While being an excellent actor, he never quite seems comfortable in this admittedly awkward part.

Unfortunately AUTO FOCUS focuses on this small subset of actor Bob Crane's life and expands it out of proportion.  In doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of Crane's life and career as window dressing.  Even the screenplay is, at best, an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of Bob Crane and John H. Carpernter  -- since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect.In viewing this film I knew that it would involve some of Crane's extracurricular activities.  My interest in the film was as a HOGAN'S HEROES fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six-year series.  Bob Crane's professional credits alone would make for a good film.  AUTO FOCUS unfortunately revolves around Crane's so-called ""secret life"" and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd.Facts are facts and there are established truths about Bob Crane's private life.

735019,A1KT1GWCW8F80,B000087F7O,K. Gittins,"[10, 11]","The title ""Auto Focus"" relates to ""self-involved"", not the operation of camera lenses (which were not around in Bob's day.) The movie covers the period of 1965-1978 in the life of actor Bob Crane.""But why Bob Crane""? you might ask. Good question. Bob Crane is best-known as ""Colonel Hogan"" in the hit TV sit-com ""Hogan's Heroes"" which aired for 6 years. Previous to that, Bob did mostly radio work, and some minor acting. After ""Hogan's Heroes"" was abruptly cancelled, he had a hard time getting much meaningful work, mostly because of his reputation for having an addiction to sex and pornography, which is the main thrust of the movie.While at first blush this may not seem to be much of a story, it is strangely compelling. It was directed by Paul Shrader, who wrote Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, so he is no lightweight when it comes to dark subjects. However, the movie is pretty quite bright and cheery for the first third or so. Then by design, as we see more and more of Bob Crane's degrading life and lifestyle, the colors get darker and drabber, different film-stock is used for a grungier feel, the camera becomes hand-held rather than having smooth pans, etc.Bob met up with a man named John Carpenter, who was sort of a video enthusiast/merchandiser, when video was just getting going. There is a fair amount of retro-video technology shown in the movie - big bulky cameras (VTR's - video tape recorders)- which produce reel-to-reel tape, then big bulky cassettes, etc. In fact, like modern men, these two characters sometimes would be more interested in the working of the technology than the ladies they have brought home.These two men struck it off and became good friends. With his TV show on the air, Bob had no problem getting women, and John reaped some benefits as well. Although rather conservative, and a Catholic, Bob divorced his first wife and married an actress from ""Hogan's Heroes"". He continued his decline with videotaping and cataloging his sex adventures up until the end.Bob's murder is still unsolved, mostly due to the fact that the majority of evidence is circumstantial, and the DNA testing abilities back then (1978) were somewhat rudimentary. Therefore, although there was a trial, the accused was acquitted.Greg Kinnear plays Crane, and Willem Dafoe is John Carpenter. In many respect Kinnear's career is similar to Crane's - radio background, not very large acting roles, etc. Both actors do a fine job. Some notables also show up in the supporting roles, including one of Bob's sons as an interviewer.Director Paul Shrader says he was not a fan of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and the movie was not an attempt to revive any warm-fuzzies of that show. He simply saw an intriguing story. In one scene, in order to avoid an NC-17 rating, the central portion of the scene of oral sex was pixellated. At first, you think ""that's odd"", but Shrader explains that he wanted to show the actual hardcore videotaping that Crane was doing so we would know this wasn't just a little cheesecake stuff he was doing on occasion. Had the scene just been cut, then we would not really know how deep Bob was sinking. There are other scenes of sex, but most is on the old video tape played on a TV with low resolution and image quality.Director Paul Shrader's commentary is very good and interesting, mostly about technical aspects of the film and story. The second commentary by the writer and two producers is only for the first hour due to space, and is mostly about the script development, though it too was interesting.There is an excellent documentary about the investigation into Bob's death including graphic photos of the bloody body. The police, prosecutor, defense attorneys and family members all contribute. There is footage for the trial, which as I mentioned, resulted in acquittal. If the available evidence had been analyzed with modern technology, I'm quite sure the accused would have been convicted of manslaughter at least.Very well-made movie of an off-beat subject.

Through Bob's success on the show of Hogan's Heroes he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a technology guru.  John introduces Bob to stripteases and later the easy access that Bob has to women.  In addition, John demonstrates the video camera for Bob which becomes a tool for the two friends as they begin a sexual escapade with countless numbers of women.  This leads Bob on to a road of difficulty as it isolates him from a public life, which he has grown accustomed to.

735022,A1N8ST7FQO4S3K,B000087F7O,"Leif A. Ostgard ""ostgard""","[4, 4]","AUTO FOCUS:This is without question one of the most well crafted movies I have ever seen.  Allot of people pass on this movie because they think its something its not, assuming a comedy by the box or simply think it's a straight-to-video bio of an actor.  It is not, it is a very intimate detailed portrait of someone whom blatantly disregards the boundaries of decency and conduct for personal impulses and gratification.  Everyone has slipped from time to time with lapses of judgement - doings they knew were wrong, lying or being shady.  Crane doesn't slip, he willingly tumbles and falls oblivious that his own actions destroyed his life and ultimately determined his demise.Auto Focus has that unique ability to make you think about the movie way after the credits have rolled.  It intrigues you, yet it also makes you feel gross, I literally felt dirty after I watched it.  Not for the certain aspects of the content but the general nature by which is was filmed.  It is gritty, its disturbing and it makes you feel as if you are in the room witnessing the sleazy side of humanity.  One only has to witness the opening and final frame to see the world in which Crane resided go from bright vibrant and into the depths of darkness.  This paradox isn't just for imagery - though it works well.  Crane is played by Kinnear - he is simple, sly, and witty using as he puts it ""like-ability"" to his advantage.  And here lies the greatest triumph of this film.  The depth in which Crane is explored.Using family, friends, associates and former co-workers ""Auto Focus"" writers Gerbosi and Graysmith construct the most detailed portrait of Crane ever surmised.  Crane's life has been documented many times in print and in A&E; type specials, all portraying him as a good guy who lets the seedy John Carpenter suck him into a world for which there was no return.  Getting him hooked on self made porn and sex exploitation.  The reality is quite sobering.Crane uses his charm, fame, and ""like-ability"" to use people, discarding them when he has no further use for them.  Caring little for anyone besides himself and his own personal desires.  Women are mere pleasantries, families are his base of operations for image and nothing more as he abandons them for the night life, work is a paycheck that he packs ""womanizing"" into his lunch pale.  No one is more affected by this trend of behavior in the movie than Carpenter whom out of co-dependancy willfully follows Crane through life as he conquests countless women and destroys every relationship both personal and professional he has...save Carpenter.  Carpenter for his part (played by Dafoe) is Cranes wing-man, a video tech for which Crane exploits to assist him in gaining equipment he uses to film his multiple conquests and also as a ""friend"" which assists his sociability functions.Carpenter enjoys the fringes of celebrity association but Crane never lets him get the slightest feeling of equality as in a scene where Crane mocks Carpenter with a video compilation he has made depicting him as gay, using footage of Carpenter disco dancing, a girl eating a banana, a hula dancer and a racy cartoon of a bosomed sextant all meshed together in a loop.  When Carpenter interjects unfavorably Crane reminds him that the only reason women sleep with him is because of his association with Crane.  This followed Crane showing off to Carpenter his penis extension for which he demands Carpenter acknowledge how big he has become.You have sympathy for Carpenter's character throughout the film as Crane undercuts him constantly, but like Crane he is a dastardly individual -  repetitive in his clumsy come on's, uneasy in his mannerisms, aggressive in approach from others and over all uncomfortable to be around.  He has very little social redeeming qualities for which his bond with Crane grows stronger as he implores a certain aspect of cheerleading to Crane's cynical and self deprecating nature referring to him as ""Big Daddy"".Both Kinnear and Dafoe give solid performances but Kinnear's portrayal of Crane's decline is exceptional in its believability.  When the sunken eyed-portly Crane shuffles into his agents office wearing his now trademarked butterfly collared shirt and large wireframe glasses for the final time in the movie, he receives the only sense of conscience in his life.  He immediately rejects it affirming his normacy ""sex is normal, I am a normal guy"", eventually pacifying his agent with a half hearted ""yeah I want to change"" exiting via a final handshake signifying the end of their relationship.At this moment of the film Crane begins to identify the doors closing around him.  He is soon served divorce papers from someone he thought wanted an autograph, rejected by women (even with an ill fated attempt to have an episode of ""Hogans Hero's"" on the television set play while he sat at the bar in front of it) and unable to make amends with his family whom he only agree's to ""go to counseling"" for.  Unwilling to detach himself from his lifestyle and not knowing any route but pacification Crane becomes a lost soul.  His only confidant being Carpenter whom he soon dissolves their friendship out of frantic resolution.  ""Who has always been there for you?"" asks Carpenter, like many other things in Crane's life - Carpenter is discarded after use as well.What happens next is debatable in fact.  The movie's final scene of Crane's murder is very grim and eerie.  Gone are the smirks, partying and nudity-replaced with the dark dim lit wasteland that is Crane's swanky fetish filled apartment.  The scene is cut differently than the rest of the film, the soundtrack of boom-boom hits and snazzy sax are nowhere to be found, the faintness of the atmosphere amplifies the instrument of death's initial impact to Crane, it is sad to watch.  Regardless of the person, the director has vested the viewer into his life, and watching it taken gives the viewer the slight emotional impact that makes a movie scene powerful.  The director intelligently does not directly acknowledge Carpenter as the killer, he eludes to an argument for that sense of possibility, however he also leaves the film hanging on the assumption that it is unknown with Crane telling the audience ""I can blame him, John was a cool guy in his own way"".  The movie ends perfectly if you didn't know the story, and like a slow car crash if you did.  Like waking up with a hangover or a realization of guilt.  Summarized in a scene where Crane wakes up in the dead of night walking to find his television set playing rerun's of ""Hero's"" at which time he see's himself on the tube ""Klink's having an inspection...I don't know about you guys...but I've got things to hide..""****Things not in the movie*****Though these things were not in the movie, and in reality not important to the overall story on film or the character perception for the viewer, they are nonetheless important to the actual life of Crane.-The film portrays Crane as being squeaky clean and a family man until he met Carpenter, however Bob Crane's son Scott who posts his fathers pornography online (pretty classy) has pictures his dad took dating back to the 50's.  Long before Carpenter came into the picture.-The film also depicts Crane's image before ""Hero's"" as mundane and innocent prior to his fame, however Crane had countless sexual innuendo's he put over the airwaves while being ""The King of Los Angeles"" for CBS Radio.  Once asking a fellow celebrity which current starlet would be most fun to get stuck in a bunker with come nuclear Armageddon.-Not allot is made of Crane's bizarre willingness to show others his pornography save one scene when he is confronted by his agent about this unusual behavior.  However Crane regularly let numerous people to include ""All in the Family"" actor Carroll O'Conner (former neighbor) view his personal tapes in his basement.-The film depicts Crane as money desolate in his later years, however in the 70's ""Hogans Hero's"" began syndication which Crane received substantial royalties for and thus made a buck.-The movie opts not to mention the failed ""Bob Crane Show"" which followed ""Hero's"" in which Crane plays an executive suit overwhelmed and unhappy with his life whom decides to move his family into a studio flat and return to college to study medicine.  The show bombed after a few months but has a small cult following online.  TBCS was the first to feature Crane's adopted butterfly collared 70's look.-The movie concludes that Crane broke his friendship off with Carpenter possibly motivating the murder, but this is unknown.  The day before the murder Crane and Carpenter had what a waitress considered a ""heated discussion"" in a restaurant but its not known its content.  They also base this belief on Crane's omissions to his wife that he would break away from his wild life and return to her.  Crane had touted this retort to his wives, agent, friends and colleagues countless times over the years leading nowhere.  Sleeping with as many as eight different woman in the weeks prior to his death, it is difficult to believe he was making a serious transition.  The apartment strewed with pornography, film and editing equipment, half developed pics of women and a photo lab in the bathroom also debunks Crane was making any serious attempts to change his life.  As far as Carpenter is concerned, Crane spent the majority of his final two days with Carpenter willingly and seemed normal - shopping at electronic stores for new items, eating at restaurants, getting early morning coffee with a few ladies, and hanging out in nightclubs.  It was business as usual for Crane.-Carpenter is the only character in the film introduced as the possible murder, however due to Crane's insatiable appetite for any woman he came in contact with many boyfriends, husbands and women who were unknowingly filmed having sex had reason for murder the actor...to say Crane had enemies would be an understatement.  Crane had so many frequent female visitors that any number of them could have left the backdoor open.  The murder was most likely committed by a male due to the force of the blow to Cranes skull.  Random pictures were missing from Cranes ""scrape books"" which lead police to believe the killer removed ones containing themself or of their said girlfriend/wife.  Due to Cranes insistence of letting his video tape run, most likely the killer did not have time to search the video archives and is possibly still on one of Cranes many sex tapes.  Carpenter was put on trial due to circumstantial evidence, a very weak case with the most damaging evidence being Carpenters demeanor when calling Crane's apartment and speaking to police, a blood stain is his car and a ""photograph"" of what some believe was possible brain tissue on a door...but in all accounts could have just been a booger.  These details are included in the bonus features ""Murder in Scottdale"" documentary included in the disk...also an interesting entry is the bonus footage not used in the film, of the killer looking out the window waiting for men to depart the area prior to his exit from the apartment.",5,"""...I don't know about you guys, but I've got things to hide.""",1267142400,"02 26,

735023,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000087F7O,Linda Linguvic,"[16, 18]","This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone.Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome.The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo.The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive.I enjoyed the film and the theme.

735024,AD2BIAIH78QI5,B000087F7O,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[26, 32]","That's the cornball line Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear) runs on every woman he photographs, whether in the beginning of his career for autograph hounds, or later as a sick pornographer in this excellent though dispiriting movie.First off, let me say that I have never seen an episode of ""Hogan's Heroes""; my father, a WW2 vet from the European theatre, refused to have it on in our house. Thus, I have no clear image of the real Bob Crane, meaning that I can't really tell whether Kinnear's portrayal is cariacature, dead-on, or way off.But that didn't bother me none. He actually reminded me of a somewhat unsavory man I know in real life, so I had no trouble making the leap that this seeming family man was actually a Real Creep in sheep's clothing. Kinnear does a great job as we see him disintegrate from a respectable vaguely naive man into a joyful then joyless sexaholic. It's a shame, really, that neither he nor his talented co-star Willem Dafoe got Oscar nominations for their work in this film. Dafoe brings to mind every lounge lizard you've ever seen as the Mephistopheles character to Bob Crane/Faust. It's Carpenter (Dafoe) who, as a pioneer in video tech doing some work for ""Hogan"" co-star Richard Dawson, introduces Crane to swinging and videotaping their joint sexual escapades. The two feed off each other for well over a decade until a final ugly altercation. Shortly after, Crane is found murdered in a motel room; the filmmakers imply that the guilty party is Carpenter.While I may not be conversant with Bob Crane's visage, like anyone else from the 1970s I do know ""Family Feud"" host Richard Dawson, and I have to say that this guy was terrible casting in that role. I don't know how long it took even for me to realize who this actor was supposed to be playing--nothing like him at all! More like Tommy Tune than the short somewhat stocky realDawson.But that's about the only complaint I have about ""Auto Focus"", with the possible exception of the unhelpful title. When I went to the theatre, I couldn't for the life of me remember what this movie was supposed to be about, even though I knew I'd seen the trailer before. It just doesn't communicate anything to its potential audience, which may explain that a lot of people didn't find out about this movie, good though it is.""Auto Focus"" does a creditable job of capturing the emptiness of Crane and Carpenter's sex addiction; one telling moment is when the two men are comparing notes on which cities have the best in certain sexual specialties, the way some others might talk about bus service. Another time, the two men are watching footage of themselves and begin to masturbate, each alone in his addiction despite the other's presence. Interesting too that Crane is up for any kind of action except homosexual; he goes ballistic when he sees Carpenter's hand on his own naked posterior during an orgy.In the end, the main moral of ""Auto Focus"" is that loss of control in one area eventually spells disaster in every facet of Crane's life, whether professional or personal. Like a modern update of a morality play, we are all well warned to stay on the straight and narrow to avoid such a downfall as Bob Crane's.",5,Schmile!,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,3190,"['cornball', 'line', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'woman', 'beginning', 'career', 'autograph', 'hounds', 'later', 'sick', 'pornographer', 'excellent', 'dispiriting', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'father', 'WW2', 'vet', 'European', 'theatre', 'refused', 'have', 'house', 'Thus', 'have', 'clear', 'image', 'real', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'meaning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'Kinnear', 'portrayal', 'cariacature', 'dead-on', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'none', 'actually', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'unsavory', 'man', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'trouble', 'making', 'leap', 'seeming', 'family', 'man', 'was', 'actually', 'Real', 'Creep', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'Kinnear', 'great', 'job', 'see', 'disintegrate', 'respectable', 'vaguely', 'naive', 'man', 'joyful', 'then', 'joyless', 'sexaholic', 'shame', 'really', 'talented', 'co-star', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'work', 'film', 'Dafoe', 'mind', 'lounge', 'lizard', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mephistopheles', 'character', 'Bob', 'Crane/Faust', 'Carpenter', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'pioneer', 'video', 'tech', 'doing', 'work', 'Hogan', 'co-star', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'Crane', 'swinging', 'videotaping', 'joint', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'two', 'feed', 'other', 'well', 'decade', 'final', 'ugly', 'altercation', 'Shortly', 'Crane', 'found', 'murdered', 'motel', 'room', 'filmmakers', 'imply', 'guilty', 'party', 'Carpenter.While', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'conversant', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'visage', 'anyone', 'else', '1970s', 'do', 'know', 'Family', 'Feud', 'host', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'have', 'say', 'guy', 'was', 'terrible', 'casting', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'even', 'realize', 'who', 'actor', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'nothing', 'More', 'Tommy', 'Tune', 'short', 'somewhat', 'stocky', 'realDawson.But', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'possible', 'exception', 'unhelpful', 'title', 'When', 'went', 'theatre', 'could', ""n't"", 'life', 'remember', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'even', 'knew', ""'d"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'just', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'anything', 'potential', 'audience', 'may', 'explain', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'movie', 'good', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'creditable', 'job', 'capturing', 'emptiness', 'Crane', 'Carpenter', 'sex', 'addiction', 'one', 'telling', 'moment', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'comparing', 'notes', 'cities', 'have', 'best', 'certain', 'sexual', 'specialties', 'way', 'others', 'might', 'talk', 'bus', 'service', 'time', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'watching', 'footage', 'begin', 'masturbate', 'alone', 'addiction', 'other', 'presence', 'Interesting', 'too', 'Crane', 'up', 'kind', 'action', 'homosexual', 'ballistic', 'when', 'Carpenter', 'hand', 'own', 'naked', 'posterior', 'orgy.In', 'end', 'main', 'moral', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'loss', 'control', 'one', 'area', 'eventually', 'disaster', 'facet', 'Crane', 'life', 'professional', 'personal', 'modern', 'update', 'morality', 'play', 'are', 'well', 'warned', 'stay', 'straight', 'narrow', 'avoid', 'downfall', 'Bob', 'Crane']",Auto Focus VHS
735025,A1NF3VPMUFHRCC,B000087F7O,"Literary Lass ""neocat_08840""","[6, 7]","As the years went by after ""Hogan's Heroes"" ceased production, actor Bob Crane didn't achieve very much, until he was brutally murdered in Scottsdale, Arizona. Suddenly, he was elevated from being a mere TV Trivial Pursuit answer. His unsavory death, which revealed a sideline in orgy sex, multiple infidelities, and secretive videotaping, transformed a onetime television star into a world-class sex addict. For someone who earned his dollars by being likable and irrascible, the real Crane was driven by demons, emotional instability, and sexual malfunction.In real life, he was abetted in his photography and clandestine videotaping by a ""gentleman"" named John Carpenter. In the film, Carpenter is scripted as being more than just a tech-savvy guy who has a streak of larceny and petty corruption in his heart. Here, played by Willem Dafoe, Carpenter is the physical manifestation of evil. He ensnares Bob Crane in his libertine lifestyle. At first parading an interest in hi-fis, martinis, and chasing skirts as an extension of Hugh Hefner's PLAYBOY credo, Carpenter eventually enables Crane to turn his back on two supportive wives and children. Crane, an overtly religious man at the movie's start, is tempted and then surrenders to his all-too-weak flesh.Paul Schrader, the director, hails from a very religious family background, so he understands the temptations that befall people who try to be active Christians. (See ""Hardcore,"" Schrader's excellent look at his Calvinist faith as it collides with pornograhy.) Here, we see as Crane doesn't just lapse from being a Catholic, he leaps into a pit of moral and physical decay.Greg Kinnear is a marvel in this role. There were times when I had to remind myself that this wasn't the real Bob Crane. The former ""Talk Soup"" host is light of manner and believably square before his meeting with Carpenter. Afterward, he is a wreck of a man with a dissipated appearance, a lost look in his eyes, and a creepy, disturbing way of expressing himself.There's a scene in the film where Carpenter and Crane whisper to one another about who gets the blonde and who gets the brunette. They are seen through the arch of a dining-room pass-through and Carpenter is pouring a drink, his head slightly bowed. It is an electrifying moment because it superbly mirrors a penitent seeking advice in a confessional. And, sadly, that is what Carpenter became to Crane: father confessor, best friend, liberator, rival, Lucifer, and finally murderer.One of the detractions from this film is that it details--a little too repetitively--so much of the day-to-day grind of the sex addiction--the choosing of the girls, the duping of them, the covert filming. The Crane story was actually shown on the E! cable network as a documentary, and the Schrader film follows this documentary ""religiously."" If one is familiar with the Crane saga, no new information is gleaned. Rather than learning motivations or understanding the depravity better, we just see it being acted out and interpreted.The acting is excellent; set designs are first rate; the production is sleek and applaudable. Only the actor who is cast to play Richard Dawson comes across as not quite ""right.""The DVD is filled with lots of extras--multiple commentary tracks, deleted scenes, trailers, featurette, documentary about filming--and is worth renting and then holding out for extra days. Or better yet, even buying if you want to savor every last morel.It's a terrific film if you are just stumbling across the pathetic end of a middling, marginally talented ""good guy."" It's less satisfying if you are already familiar with Crane's fall from grace. Either familiar or a neophyte, one can't help but be stunned when the murder--which you know is coming--finally does occur. It hit me almost as hard as the Eric Roberts implosion/explosion in ""Star 80.""""Autofocus"" is not a perfect film, but it does bring into sharp detail the beasts, the demons, the unlikable personalities, that incubate in even the most ordinary fellas.

I loved watching the repeats of Hogan's Heroes before going to kindergarten.  I was shocked by his death and could not understand why or how it happened.  I was hoping this movie would give some info that I missed as a seven year old in 1978.  I was looking for more clues/hints than a documentary would give seeing this was full blown motion picture.  So much of the movie seemed to be about his sex life.  It was too creepy to imagine that someone could know so much about his sex life so many years ago.  So with those parts of the film most likely made up, it was hard to believe the movie at all.  Why did they not report this stuff earlier?  Finally in the end it kind of reminded me of one of those books an angry family member writes after their famous celebrity relative dies.  I doubt any of his wives waited 25 years to give information.  I guess I expected more facts and true plot.  It was not so easy for me to believe the information as it was told.  More of a biography about Bob Crane would have been nice with a little less sex and less topless women at the end.  I missed information about the Hollywood Talent Scouts show and his mental state while his career fell apart.  More women had their tops off than on from the middle to the end of the film.  That took away any hope for me that the film could be realistic.  It seemed like the writer's main topic was sex and tried to squeeze the rest of the film around it.

Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear) is a supremely likable guy with a family and a popular prime time sitcom, but also with a penchant for pornography and casual sex when he meets a man named John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe) on the set of Hogan's Heroes. Carpenter was a sales representative for Sony's cutting edge technologies when they were developing VTR technology, a precursor to videotape. Crane, a lifelong photography enthusiast, was quite taken with this new technology. Also being a huge fan of pornography, he took the opportunity that VTR provided to make an astounding number of pornographic 'home movies' of anyone who would let him. Bob Crane's philandering and sexual obsession, often encouraged and facilitated by John Carpenter, became pathological and seemingly out of his own control, eventually costing him his first marriage and damaged his ability to get roles in Hollywood. Bob Crane was murdered in 1978 . The movie asserts the most popular hypothesis as to who committed the crime. But the circumstances surrounding his murder actually remain unclear.Greg Kinnear gives the performance of his life as the affable, compulsive Bob Crane. I only know Bob Crane from television, but, based on what I've seen, Kinnear nailed Crane's mannerisms perfectly. Willem Dafoe is superb as bright, needy, and sleazy John Carpenter. Rita Wilson is admirable in her supporting role as Bob Crane's first wife Anne. Maria Bello plays his second wife, actress Patricia Olson. I don't like director Paul Schrader's decision to overdub a narration that is supposed to be Bob Crane speaking (even speaking from the grave at one point!). It is unnecessary, corny, and takes Bob Crane's words too far out of their context, I think. That is a minor point, since the overdubbing is only occasional.Bob Crane's elder son by his first marriage, Robert David Crane, cooperated with the making of this film. His younger son by his second marriage, Robert Scott Crane -young ""Scotty"" in the movie- did not and has voiced strong objections to how his father is portrayed in the film. He cites a long list of what he claims are the film's inaccuracies. (You can read his objections if you search for Autofocus on the Internet Movie Database.) I am not inclined to take his criticisms of the film seriously because, having seen the movie, I can say that the film simply does not imply many of the things that Robert Scott Crane claims that it does. He seems to think that Autofocus paints an overwhelmingly negative picture of his father without showing the positve aspects of Bob Crane's life and character. I disagree. Autofocus is not unsympathetic to Bob Crane. He is portrayed as a likable and extremely gregarious man who cared for his family and was a talented comic actor...but who had an addiction that destroyed at least one of his marriages and his career and may have caused his premature death. He would never admit that he had problem and so never tried to change his behavior. I don't think that that characterization of Bob Crane is in dispute. But the issue of accuracy which Robert Scott Crane raises is a legitimate one. Unless the subject  of a biographical film cooperates in writing the film, the screenwriters and scriptwriters cannot possible know the details of what went on behind closed doors or what was said in private conversations. So they make it up. They write scenes and put words in the characters' mouths that move the story along and support (hopefully) accurate character development. So viewers have to take the details with a grain of salt, not literally.I recommend Autofocus for Greg Kinnear's great performance, and for its excellent portrait of someone who has crossed the line between self-indulgence and self-destruction and never really figures that out.",4,Great Performances.

He usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of AIDS.  Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan's Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan's was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.  Yes, I'm sorry to say, Kinnear is awful as Crane, which puts a damper on the bio-flick.Here's a disc jockey with semi-hip 60's patter on the air with an All American family, a loving wife and cute kids.  They live like Ozzie and Harriet in the LA burbs, going to Catholic Church on Sunday.  Crane lands his big break, falling for the trappings of fame.  Most people fall for the trappings of fame.  Read the supermarket check out magazine racks.  So all of a sudden, Crane's garage porn collection isn't enough.  Women, very beautiful, Hollywood loose-morals women find Crane and his buddy William Defoe irresistible.

The movie also shows his decline into deviant behavior with a friend John Carpenter. Although the murder of Crane has remained unsolved since the 70's, Carpenter seems to be the main suspect even though he passed away from a heart attack. So the movie examines Crane's life and shows what we know to be true and what may have been his demise. I like the way the film was shot, from the candy colored 60's, the movie falls into the 70's and Crane's behavior continues on a destructive path and the colors of the film become less vibrant, more muted and muddy. Also the camera angles are shaky and tight in the 70's as compared to the spacious and clean cut 60's shots.Greg Kinnear is amazing and completely Bob Crane. Kinnear is truly one of our mosted gifted actors. When the movie recreates Hogan's Heroes all the characters are there and so perfectly portrayed. Willem Dafoe is excellent as usual in such a creepy guy role, but he is so good at that. The DVD extras are plentiful. There's three sets of commentaries, deleted scenes, and a making of featurette. Also the most interesting feature is a documentary called ""A Murder in Scottsdale"" which analyzes the true crime scene and investigation with the officers, detectives, and others that were there.

As the many other reviews state (especially ""mirasreview"", and in splendid detail), ""Auto Focus"" is the story of Bob Crane, and his unsolved (or is it?) murder. Based on Robert Graysmith's book, the movie reportedly ran fast and loose with the facts, but if you can get past the bickering of Crane's family members about what is accurate and what isn't, and just take the movie as a solid Hollywood attempt at the story, it's at least four stars, maybe even edging toward five. Greg Kinnear is very good - some reviews say that he does a superficial turn as the sex-addicted Crane, but I respectfully dispute this opinion -, and Willem Dafoe is absolutely fantastic as Crane's sleazy pal, John Carpenter. Before anybody yells slander at me about calling Carpenter a sleaze-bot, Crane is no better...in fact, he may be worse. Both men obviously were so hung up on constant and anonymous sex that it was only a matter of time before something took a turn for the worse. When I first began learning the facts behind the case, I was stunned, bluntly, that it didn't happen sooner...and if Carpenter hadn't been the assumed killer (I also believe that he did it), it could have easily ended with both of these men in a river, courtesy of a perturbed husband or boyfriend. The facts - and shadows of truth - to the case are so well known that there is no real need to go into them, here; I am doing this review because I do think that the movie got a bad rap, and neither Kinnear nor Dafoe got the credits they should have for their portrayals of two very damaged individuals. The movie is shot almost in a documentary-like style, but not quite, if that makes sense - you can see the camera jump here and there, and I personally thought that it was intentional, to keep the viewer jumpy and uncomfortable. I also wondered if it was a quiet little wink at the ancient 1970s' home movies which, in fact, took Crane to a grisley demise. The real Carpenter was tried and acquitted for the crime; no matter, in the eyes of most Crane followers and fans, he's the guilty party, and this infamous unsolved crime is not so unsolved, at all. In the end, this is a warning about addiction, going astray, and how easily we can believe what Hollywood force feeds us as the viewing audience (I was young when Crane was murdered, and it broke my heart, because we watched repeats of Hogan's Heroes, Crane's Disney flicks, etc. and just thought that he was no doubt, offscreen, the kind of dad every kid would like to have) - and how completely opposite the truth might be. I find it somewhat ironic that Bob Crane, during his DJ days of the late 50s' and early 60s', once interviewed Marilyn Monroe, another celebrity whose death would be disputed for decades after her suicide/murder...it makes you wonder whether, sitting in that DJ booth together, either of these star-crossed individuals caught flashes of their future fates for even a second, and whether they thought, Oh, come on, that could never happen. Talk about a karmic circus, and two instances of what really, really happened? In both cases, I doubt we'll ever know, for certain. BTW, the documentary ""Murder In Scottsdale' shows actual police photos/evidence from the crime scene, so not for the squeamish. Despite the bad rap, the family squabbling and Crane being a cult-like figure rather than on the level of the beforementioned Marilyn, I think that this is a good to great movie, and Kinnear and Dafoe are much of the reason.

735037,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000087F7O,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","When ""Auto Focus"" begins Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear) hasn't become a household name as a result of his starring in ""Hogan's Heroes"". He's  a corny radio disc jockey and failed drummer. He's  a devoted family man who accompanies his wife Anne (Rita Wilson) and their three kids to church every Sunday. Crane is desperate for his big break and when he receives the Hogan's script he has his doubts. After Anne tells him it's a great opportunity  he signs on and the show becomes a hit. This exposure means that Crane is more recognizable to female fans who constantly ask to take pictures with him. He doesn't mind the female adoration plus he's  a photography nut. During a lunch break on set one day he meets John Carpenter (Willem Defoe) a rep for Sony. The two strike up a conversation and Carpenter tells Crane about the new advances in video recording technology.  He invites Crane out for drinks but since he's  going to a strip club Crane is hesitant. He goes and so begins his dive into the sexual underbelly. Soon he is playing backup on drums at numerous gentleman's clubs all over town. He tells Anne about his late night activities and even confesses to his priest in a diner. Not content with watching the girls Crane and Carpenter start taking the showgirls back to Carpenter's place where they take nude photos of them before having orgies. Carpenter films all of this without Crane or the women knowing. At first Crane is reluctant and has to be talked into it but after doing it a couple of times he's in total control and even takes girls away from Carpenter. This causes some friction between the two men but the only time they have a big falling out is when Crane suspects Carpenter of being gay. Carpenter assures him that he isn't but Crane never gets over his suspicions about his new best friend. Anne discovers the nude photos of the other women and files for divorce. Crane had begun dating his Hogan's costar Patti Olson (Maria Bello) and when Anne is out of the picture he marries  Patti. She is aware of his lifestyle and approves telling him that she doesn't want him to feel like he has to be somebody he's not. As Crane gets deeper and deeper  weekends turn into constant orgies with swingers and hippies. Hogan's ends and his career is permanently stalled. Unable to get film work because of his dangerous reputation Crane is relegated to doing dinner theater with Patti. This leaves him a bitter and pathetic man with nothing but the promise of sex to keep him going. The film just gets darker and more depraved leading up to the brutal murder of Crane that's still unsolved. Carpenter is the main suspect since Crane finally came to his senses and tried to get out of the life before it killed him. The film may be more interested in the nudity and sex so the extra features attempt to investigate the murder in more detail . There's  a fifty minute documentary called ""Murder in Scottsdale"" that builds a pretty strong case against Carpenter who died five years after Crane of a heart attack. This film got all rave reviews by critics but I think it's a standard bio pic frankly. Kinnear is a great and unappreciated actor and his performance is very challenging taking Crane from a loving family man to a bitter, alcoholic, sex fiend. Defoe is reliable as always, Maria Bello is sexy and gives a good performance as always. Schrader's directing is strong from a stylistic sense and the story he's telling is certainly interesting.

735039,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000087F7O,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","I remember in 1978 hearing on the news that Bob Crane had been murdered.  I was about 14 at the time, and I was a little bummed, because I occasionally watched reruns of HOGAN'S HEROES (although it was never a real favorite of mine).  Every five years or so, it would occur to me that I never heard if they found out who killed Crane.  But that was before Google, so I never checked.Then, when I heard about the movie AUTO FOCUS coming out, and that it would reveal the sleazy life of Bob Crane...I began to understand a bit more, as an adult, that Crane's murder wasn't just a robbery or random act.  It was, it appears, the ultimate outcome of many years of leading a furtive life that allowed him to indulge in his sex addictions.We've seen so many movies over the years where stars are shown with drug addictions, alcohol addictions or simply ""fooling around"" over and over on their spouses.  Sometimes combinations of the above.  Crane was different because his addiction was sexual (yes, he ""fooled around""...but it was more than that.  Crane clearly had a true addiction to sex, porn and the related exciting possibilities brought about by the emergence of Video Tape Recorders).POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:  I'll be talking more in detail about the plot than usual for me, because the EVENTS that happen, to me, aren't as important as the mood and mindset of the two main characters.  If you'd still rather not know, skip ahead.In the fascinating film, we first meet Crane (Greg Kinnear) as an affable, goofy radio DJ / talk show host.  He's a popular radio personality, but yearns to return to the screen.  He's offered the role as Hogan in a comedy about a POW camp in WWII, and after some reluctance (a lot of people assume it's a comedy about a concentration camp...which would clearly be a career killer), Crane accepts the part.  He's a handsome, charming, church-going family man with an easy smile, an agreeable manner with fans and a loving wife (Rita Wilson) and father of three.  It's the late `60s, but Crane doesn't listen to rock `n' roll, he doesn't drink and he doesn't cheat.  He's a good guy.We see women throwing themselves at him, but he brushes them off.  But when he meets (to his great misfortune) the greasy but compelling John Carpenter (no relation to the director!), his hidden desires come to the forefront.  It's almost a perfect storm of bad circumstances.  He is vaguely interested in Carpenter (Willem Dafoe) because the man is very interested in electronics (he works for Sony, and always has the most cutting edge devices)...and Crane has an interest in photography and when he hears about video photography, he's like a kid in a candy store.  Then he meets Carpenter at a strip joint to socialize and when he expresses his interest in drumming, Carpenter gets the club owner to let Crane ""guest"" on drums with the live band that accompanies the stripper.  And Crane eats that up!  For awhile, drumming is all he does, and we viewers wish that was where it stopped.  But Carpenter, like a minor league Svengali, entices Crane with the easy women and with the realization that Crane's stardom gives them their pick of women and Carpenter's technical know-how gives them an opportunity to videotape themselves with these women.It's all downhill from there.  The two men are addicted to the porn they create.  The movie is a fascinating portrayal of sexual addiction, I have to admit.  I've not really seen it addressed in such a manner, as a central topic.  Crane cannot help himself...he needs more and more women, because he needs more and more photos and videos.  He is insatiable.Naturally, his home life is destroyed; his career suffers, and so forth.  The trajectory of his life is ultimately not all that interesting...it is the dissection of his madness that makes the film noteworthy.  He talks about getting treatment.  He even remarries (Mario Bello) and tries to walk more straight and narrow.  But he also uses his trips to perform dinner theatre around the country as excuses to meet new groups of women eager to be filmed.  And hanging by his side through all this is the leech-like Carpenter.  That Crane was eventually murdered in an ugly, seedy fashion is no surprise.END OF SPOILERS:  In many ways, the film is of little importance.  A very minor star and his sordid descent into sexual insanity.  Titillating but hardly ""important.""  However, I would argue that it is worth seeing for the performances.  Rita Wilson (who rarely works) is very good as Crane's wife.  Her gradual realization of just who she's married to his subtly done.  Bello, whose part is actually fairly small, presents us with another of her patented smart but sexy women.  Dafoe, who for me can frequently be a very annoying overactor, is well suited to this part, because he CAN play desperate, greasy and just a little nuts very well.  But this is Kinnear's best performance.  We've seen him do the nice, gentle guy (AS GOOD AS IT GETS), the nice, handsome guy (SABRINA), the nice but stressed guy (LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE) and even the nice but just a little crazy guy (FLASH OF GENIUS).  Here he's the nice but sick `n' twisted guy.  His performance is splendid because almost right up to the end he seems like just a nice, ordinary American guy who is just a little befuddled that his nice life is consumed with sex and homemade porn.  We root for him to shape up.  We often feel that he's right on the verge of pulling himself out of his debauchery.  It's a simple, clean performance that nonetheless has many layers of complexity.  I dare say that he should have received more notice at awards time...but the film came and went so quickly that no one remembered it.The film is also nice to look at.  The art direction, taking us from mid `60s to late `70s is impeccable.  Costumes and hair are great.  The aging on Crane is well done.  Director Paul Schrader tells his story in a straightforward manner with no fancy tricks...kinda like Kinnear's performance.  (And the brief recreations of HOGAN'S HEROES are a hoot, if you know the series.)It's a VERY R-rated film...with lots of nudity and just an all-around ""mature"" theme.  I didn't love the film, because in the end, it was all so squalid and insignificant.  But I great admired it, and would recommend it to mature movie-goers.  If you like Greg Kinnear, it's particularly a must-see.",4,Fascinating look at sexual addiction that is naturally a bit squalid.,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,6373,"['remember', '1978', 'hearing',

735040,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000087F7O,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 4]","I was fascinated by this film, which was a realistic portrait of a man living a dual life. Bob Crane, the good looking charmer from ""Hogan's Heroes"" seemingly had it all, a beautiful family, fame, money, looks and health. Greg Kinnear is brilliant as Crane not so much due to physical similarity, but rather due to the psychological changes apparent in the character through the film as he distances himself from his family and slides into addiction, and is eventually murdered because he ultimately realizes how hollow his life has become and tries to leave the lifestyle behind. Willem Dafoe is absolutely believable as the evil and corrupting John Carpenter.It is always a fascinating experience to watch emotional conflict well portrayed onscreen, and rarely has it been done better.The DVD has some great extras, notably a concise documentary on the Bob Crane murder.I highly recommend this film to any adults interested in a film realistically dealing with descents into depravity and attempted, though ultimately thwarted, redemption.",5,Descent Into Madness,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,1041,"['was', 'fascinated', 'film', 'was', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'man', 'living', 'dual', 'life', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'good', 'looking', 'charmer', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'seemingly', 'had', 'all', 'beautiful', 'family', 'fame', 'money', 'health', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'brilliant', 'Crane', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'due', 'physical', 'similarity', 'rather', 'due', 'psychological', 'changes', 'apparent', 'character', 'film', 'family', 'slides', 'addiction', 'eventually', 'murdered', 'ultimately', 'how', 'hollow', 'life', 'become', 'tries', 'leave', 'lifestyle', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'absolutely', 'believable', 'evil', 'corrupting', 'John', 'Carpenter.It', 'always', 'fascinating', 'experience', 'watch', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'well', 'portrayed', 'onscreen', 'rarely', 'been', 'done', 'better.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'notably', 'concise', 'documentary', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'adults', 'interested', 'film', 'realistically', 'dealing', 'descents', 'depravity', 'attempted', 'ultimately', 'thwarted', 'redemption']",Auto Focus VHS
735041,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000087F7O,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","***1/2 A cautionary tale of the dangers of sexual addiction, ""Auto Focus"" shows what can happen when a person attempts to lead a double life - in this case, a straight-laced family man by day and a pornography-obsessed playboy by night.  In ""Auto Focus,"" the family man/pornographer turns out to be none other than the well-known actor Bob Crane, the star of TV's ""Hogan's Heroes,"" who was found murdered in a Scottsdale, Arizona hotel room in 1978 under mysterious and sensational circumstances that included the uncovering of tapes Crane had made of his own sexual experiences.  The general public was shocked to discover that a man they had invited into their living rooms every week for six years had been living such an unsavory parallel existence - though those who knew him well were apparently far less shocked by the revelation.  Drawing on Robert Graysmith's book ""The Murder of Bob Crane"" for its inspiration and viewpoint, the film, written by Michael Gerbosi and directed by Paul Schrader, chronicles the rise and fall of this handsome actor, from his days as a successful LA disc jockey and his meteoric rise to fame as star of a hit comedy series, to his growing obsession with promiscuity and pornography, which led to the disintegration of both his personal and professional life - and, ultimately, to his death, most likely at the hands of his buddy-in-sleaze, videographer John Carpenter (though he was never convicted of the murder).""Auto Focus"" certainly does not shy away from revealing many of the salacious details of this true-life story.  Schrader deals head-on with the disturbing nature of a mind so all consumed with the subject of sex that all other aspects of life become obliterated and distorted.  What's fascinating about Crane - at least in the way he is depicted in this film - is that he seems to have had some sort of self-destructive death wish, for not only does he risk his career by sleeping with countless women, but he insists on leaving behind the evidence by videotaping many of his encounters, and then flaunting his ""accomplishments"" to others in the Hollywood community.  In a way, such a cavalier attitude only underlines the sickness at the core of Crane's soul - which in a perverse, paradoxical way, actually makes Crane a more sympathetic figure than he otherwise might be.  An enormous amount of credit for this also goes to Greg Kinnear who does a superb job of not only replicating Crane's style of acting but of showing us the tortured man Crane became in his later years.  He was truly a man driven to madness by the demons within him, and we can all identify in some sense with that condition (our demons may not be sexual in nature, but they probably eat away at us just as ravenously as they did Crane).  Kinnear gets outstanding support from Willem Dafoe as Carpenter, the Svengali-like figure who lures Crane into his world of photographed sex, and Ron Leibman, as Crane's well-meaning, caring agent who can do little but stand by helplessly as his client throws his career and his life away to feed this devouring passion.The filmmakers have done an amazing job capturing the sights and sounds of the era in which the film is set.  Especially impressive are the scenes recreating ""Hogan's Heroes,"" with Kurt Fuller, in particular, a standout as Werner Klemperer (Colonel Klink).  It's also fascinating to see the evolution of videotape technology as portrayed in the film.  How many of us knew that such equipment existed for home consumption as early as the mid-60's?There's a real sadness to the final stretches of the film, made all the more poignant by having the dirge-like musical score run uninterrupted under the action.  The effect is that we really get a sense of the total desolation of Crane's life at that point - as he has lost his family, his career, and his self-respect to the master he chose early on to serve.  The loss of his life seems almost de rigueur given all that has gone before.

Tell them sex is normal."" -- Bob Crane in ""Auto Focus""Sex addictions typically invite a smile, and maybe envy. ""Auto Focus,"" which chronicles the traveling sexual misadventures of the television star Crane, is a very funny movie, but, to its credit, inspires none of the latter emotion. If Bob Crane's life was perfectly normal, as Crane seemed to believed for a time, than ""normal"" is one hell of a raw, tiring deal.In a year of virtuoso male performances, Greg Kinnear was overlooked for his portrayal of the ""Hogan's Heroes"" star, but Kinnear delivers the performance of his still young career. He has Crane's look, his bemusement, his bewilderment, his shallowness and his greed.But at the outset of ""Auto Focus,"" Crane is still a LA radio disc jockey and a bit of a goof -- a ""cut up"" as he calls it -- and still a reasonably devoted-if-vacant family man.And then Crane lands the ""Hogan's"" gig. He meets the 1960s version of a tekkie in John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), who hangs around stars and peddles new gadgets, like the Sony Video Tape Recorder. Crane, it turns out, is a gadget man himself. Together, they use the VTR to record one another having sex with women.Carpenter is the creep to end all creeps, but Crane is so locked into being affable that he bypasses the unseemliness for Carpenter's universal interests in naked women and booze. When he starts drumming late nights at a strip club, it's clear that his high school sweetheart-turned wife, Anne (Rita Wilson) won't be seeing him much any longer. There is one break when Crane discovers Carpenter is probably gay -- ""It was a group grope!"" Carpenter pleads -- but the rift is mended when Crane's home VTR player breaks, and only one man can fix it. It's a match made in porn from that moment forward.I mentioned the movie is funny, and it is: Crane is likable but halfway hapless, and certainly dim-witted. Upon discovery of Carpenter's gay tendencies, Crane affects a deep hurt and betrayal he actually buys into. It's a sad joke, but humorous nonetheless, that Crane thinks he's operating with a full deck of cards: He knows charm like the back of hand, but not any other kind of deception -- he has pictures of naked women on his car seat for any passerby to see. He delves so deep into his addiction that he meticulously films and catalogues his escapades, only to watch every other aspect of his life crumble around him; he can't find work because his addiction is the murmur of the town, and the addiction puts him into a fog of bliss that neither his first wife, nor his second, Patti (Maria Bello) can ever bust through.Carpenter can hang out, because he's the equipment guy, although at some point, Crane sees him as a drag, too. And then Crane sees the women as a drag, existing mainly to be filmed and viewed later, while Crane and Carpenter masturbate on the couch.The movie's final act is a predictable, long ugly spiral toward Crane's mysterious murder in 1978. The world, aside from Carpenter and faceless women, has shut him out. A day without sex has become a day wasted, so much of the night is spent fulfilling the ""mission.""Paul Schrader directs, and after his brilliant ""Affliction, the cinematic equivalent of a icewrap around your head, ""Auto Focus"" is a film, though entirely different in source material, essentially in the same vein: Bob Crane is not without talents or virtues, but his delusions are stronger. Schrader's movies are a little cool to the touch, which has put off some critics (David Edelstein of Slate) but I like the approach -- ""Auto Focus"" is hardly your run-of-the-mill addiction movie.

Greg Kinnear, as Crane, and Willem DeFoe, as Carpenter, deserve special mention for their acting turns here.  Both men come alive, particularly Carpenter, as portrayed by the versatile and highly talented DeFoe.While the film certainly exploits Crane's deficiencies, and his fall from the Hollywood ""A"" list, it does little to explore why Crane did what he did.  Was he a sex addict?  It would certainly seem so.  It also did little to explain why Crane continued to keep Carpenter around - - although it left little doubt as to the motive Carpenter might have had to kill Crane.Although I was too young to have seen ""Hogan's Heroes"" in its initial run, and have never really been a fan of the show, it was still heartbreaking to see Crane's downfall and think of what he might have had, had he never met Carpenter or had he been a happy family man.Definitely worth viewing for DeFoe's stellar acting chops (and the reason I give this film 4 stars, instead of 3), and Kinnear's take on Bob Crane, but overall, I felt sad and even dirty after watching this movie.",4,Disturbing,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1702,"['Auto', 'Focus', 'story', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'actor', 'starring', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', '60s', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'only', 'die', 'violent', 'shocking', 'death', 'motel', 'Arizona', '1978.While', 'film', 'touch', 'Crane', 'early', 'life', 'career', 'hard', 'preoccupation', 'sex', 'many', 'women', 'apparently', 'had', 'affairs', 'eventual', 'friendship', 'slimy', 'lecherous', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'SONY', 'executive', 'who', 'introduced', 'Crane', 'wonders', 'videotaping', 'considered', 'most', 'be', 'number', 'one', 'suspect', 'Crane', 'still', 'officially', 'unsolved', 'murder.I', 'found', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'be', 'engrossing', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'film', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Crane', 'Willem', 'DeFoe', 'Carpenter', 'deserve', 'special', 'mention', 'acting', 'here', 'men', 'come', 'alive', 'particularly', 'Carpenter', 'portrayed', 'versatile', 'highly', 'talented', 'DeFoe.While', 'film', 'certainly', 'Crane', 'deficiencies', 'fall', 'Hollywood', 'A', 'list', 'little', 'explore', 'why', 'Crane', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Was', 'sex', 'addict', 'would', 'certainly', 'seem', 'so', 'also', 'did', 'little', 'explain', 'why', 'Crane', 'continued', 'keep', 'Carpenter', 'left', 'little', 'doubt', 'motive', 'Carpenter', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'kill', 'Crane.Although', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'seen', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'initial', 'run', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'Crane', 'downfall', 'think', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'Carpenter', 'had', 'been', 'happy', 'family', 'man.Definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'DeFoe', 'stellar', 'acting', 'chops', 'reason', 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '3', 'Kinnear', 'take', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'overall', 'felt', 'sad', 'even', 'dirty', 'watching', 'movie']",Auto Focus VHS

In fact, everyone except the chunky actor portraying the late Werner Klemperer just seems coarse and bony when compared to their real life counterparts.  My, how times have changed.

I have also always been enthralled by the unsolved mystery of Crane's death in 1978. It has become common knowlege that Crane had a severe sex addiction and that he liked to videotape his sexual exploits with his young female sex partners. This film, ""Auto Focus"", deals with Crane's eventual rise to TV stardom and his descent into his deeper and darker side of sexual addiction. Greg Kinnear does a superb job in portraying Bob Crane. When the film documents scenes from ""Hogan's Heroes"" you actually believe your watching Crane all over again. Kinnear's mannerisms, voice, and the way he wears that hat that Crane made famous are impeccable. William Dafoe does a good job in playing the friend of Crane's who introduced him to the world of videotape recording machines.The film is presented in widescreen, there's a making-of featurette on the film, commentaries are included, deleted scenes are added, plus much more. The jewel here, as far as bonuses are concerned, is the 50 minute documentary entitled ""Murder in Scottsdale"", that documents Crane's murder and the reopening of the case 15 years later.Todd McCarthy of Variety says ""this is one of director Paul Schrader's best films, and like ""Boogie Nights"" ranks as a shrewd expose of recent Hollywood's slimy underside..."".",5,"The Darker Side Of Hollywood""",1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,1413,"['was', 'never', 'fan', '1960', 'TV', 'series', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'star', 'sitcom', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'have', 'also', 'always', 'been', 'enthralled', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'Crane', 'death', '1978', 'become', 'common', 'knowlege', 'Crane', 'had', 'severe', 'sex', 'addiction', 'liked', 'videotape', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'young', 'female', 'sex', 'partners', 'film', 'Auto', 'Focus', 'deals', 'Crane', 'eventual', 'rise', 'TV', 'stardom', 'descent', 'deeper', 'darker', 'side', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'superb', 'job', 'portraying', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'When', 'film', 'documents', 'scenes', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'actually', 'believe', 'watching', 'Crane', 'over', 'again', 'Kinnear', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'way', 'hat', 'Crane', 'made', 'famous', 'are', 'impeccable', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'friend', 'Crane', 'who', 'introduced', 'world', 'videotape', 'recording', 'machines.The', 'film', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'film', 'commentaries', 'are', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'added', 'much', 'more', 'jewel', 'here', 'as', 'far', 'bonuses', 'are', 'concerned', '50', 'minute', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Murder', 'Scottsdale', 'documents', 'Crane', 'murder', 'reopening', 'case', '15', 'years', 'later.Todd', 'McCarthy', 'Variety', 'one', 'director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'best', 'films', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'shrewd', 'expose', 'recent', 'Hollywood', 'slimy', 'underside']",Auto Focus VHS

The exposition and complication are weak. There is no build-up of intensity and no dramatic tension. The worst thing is that the most important part of the movie, the actual murder, is the weakest and most poorly done part of the whole thing. ""Foreshadowing"" is no more than a word in a dictionary to these people.The best comparison I can make would be something like this. Snow White lives happily with the seven dwarfs for years and years and then when she does just one unfriendly thing, Sleepy bashes her skull in. Even a first year theater major would have the sense to show some kind of instability in William Dafoe's character in advance of implying his responsibility.This movie is based on a book so some of the blame might come therein. But whatever the source it is somewhat cheap and tawdry to place possibly unfounded blame on someone who is not alive to defend themselves. Too much of this story had to be made up from imagination. Do we really know that early in their friendship Bob Crane and John Carpenter (not the director) had a falling out over a minor incident in a group orgy? Do we really know they made up when Crane needed his tape machine fixed? Do we really know that any of the facts in this movie are correct, other than the common knowledge about the Hogan's Heroes series and other Crane stage/screen appearances?What you get in this movie is about 90 minutes of two guys going into strip bars to pick up women, then a quick killing and like that it is over.

He was like an embarrassed little boy when his wife finds his porno stash, then he was like a man who realizes he has no control when he hits the strip joints with Richard Dawson and friends.Production values are first rate; the sets and music really bring that bright pastel California 1960's look to life, as well as the dark wood-panel barroom 1970's atmosphere of the last scenes.  Performances and attention to detail are great.As deep and effective as everything is, I still find myself telling friends: ""This is a great--but it's basically about a guy who lets his sex life out of control until someone beats him to death.""I grew up watching the sitcoms of the 60s and 70s, so it's been quite a trip to find out that Mr. Brady from THE BRADY BUNCH and the second Darren from BEWITCHED would both die of AIDS, and that Colonel Hogan would spend his time outside of Stalag 17 in nonstops orgies.Man, what's next?",4,The Fall of Colonel Hogan,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1396,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'look', 'sleazy', 'life', 'sad', 'demise', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'sordid', 'Hollywood', 'tragedy', 'Paul', 'Shrader', 'did', 'something', 'interesting', 'AUTO', 'FOCUS', 'thought', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'be', 'overtaken', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'it.Instead', 'drawing', 'away', 'Crane', 'actually', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'way', 'head', 'celebrity', 'status', 'allowed', 'be', 'consumed', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'little', 'boy', 'when', 'wife', 'porno', 'stash', 'then', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'control', 'when', 'strip', 'joints', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'friends.Production', 'values', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'sets', 'music', 'really', 'bring', 'bright', 'pastel', 'California', '1960', 'look', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'dark', 'wood-panel', 'barroom', '1970', 'atmosphere', 'last', 'scenes', 'Performances', 'attention', 'detail', 'are', 'great.As', 'deep', 'effective', 'everything', 'still', 'find', 'telling', 'friends', 'great', 'basically', 'guy', 'who', 'sex', 'life', 'control', 'someone', 'death', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'sitcoms', '60s', '70s', 'been', 'quite', 'trip', 'find', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Brady', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'second', 'Darren', 'BEWITCHED', 'would', 'die', 'AIDS', 'Colonel', 'Hogan', 'would', 'spend', 'time', 'Stalag', '17', 'nonstops', 'orgies.Man', 'what', 'next']",Auto Focus VHS
735050,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000087F7O,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","Based on the book ""The Murder of Robert Crane"" by Robert Graysmith, ""Auto Forcus"" describes the life of Bob Crane, popular DJ and actor, best remembered as the star of TV POW sitcom in the 60s.  According to the film, he lived a life everybodu would envy -- beautiful wife and loving family, and popularity -- until he starts another kind of life, hidden from them.Greg Kinnear provides his career best performance in this film.  He plays the role of Bob Crane, who, after meeting a rep from Sony named John Carpenter (equally great Willem Dafoe),  gradually decends into the darker side of life, namely the addiction to sex.  Serious or not, they gleefuly say: ""A day without sex is a day wasted.""It is nothing surprising for us to see his wife (Rita Wilson) suspect that her husband hides something, In fact he hides many embarrasing things you can never show your kids.  And it is nothing surprising for us to see Hollywood stars lose their popularity because of their own wrong choices in life and career.  Sure, these things happen to Bob, and inevitable ending, too.As far as the material goes, ""Auto Focus"" gives nothing new or unique.  We have seen similar, and probably more shocking stories about celebrities, and there are tons of books written about these seedy aspects of Tinseltown.  And the camera of this movie does not explain much about the reason for his addition (if ever he was really addicted as the film suggests).  But who can really explain the habits of human being?The strength of the film lies in its mood and performance.  As I said before, Greg Kinnear, perfectly cast, gives rivetting acting, which deserves some awards.  His precarious relations with his family and his friend Carpenter are convincingly portrayed.Check out the impeccable production design of the film, which recreates the fashions of the 60s and 70s.  The decor, clothes, even the slightly faded color of contemporary TV show is perfectly presented with reality.And most of all, it is good to see the dirctor Paul Schrader, after his unimpressive ""Forever Mine,"" is back in good form, who is always deft at showing the males walking the wild side of life.  Now he did it again, and whether you like it or not, you have to admit his talent in exploring the dark and concealed territory of life.

735051,A21WMACLYWYJAT,B000087F7O,"""vampyroboy""","[7, 7]","Like many Hollywood productions, 'Auto Focus' takes liberties with the truth.  On one hand, it's not documentary film; on the other hand, it's not roman a clef.  It's not historical.  What type of movie is it, then?  It's 'biographical'-- fact glued together with speculation-- and that makes it risky, much in the way that 'Malcolm X' and 'JFK' were.  So far, so good.  Hollywood's been crying out for risk-takers ever since Frank Capra's 'You Can't Take It With You', a successful anarchist comedy, won Best Picture.  The problem here isn't one of historical inaccuracy.  'Auto Focus' simply isn't compelling.  Director Paul Schrader puts so much emphasis on Bob Crane's sexual peccadilloes that he neglects to remind us why we cared about the story in the first place: Hogan's Heroes was inspired stuff.  Sure, it was campy!  It was also groundbreaking, controversial and well-written.  The characters were distinctive, there was great on-screen chemistry and it was just plain FUNNY.  We don't get that from Schrader's film and it's a shame.  [N.B.: A Hogan's Heroes montage, left on the cutting room floor, is included in the extras.  See it.  Those few seconds would have improved the movie tenfold.]To understand its shortcomings further, one needs to look at 'Auto Focus' within the framework of the director's career.  With screenplay credits like 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' and 'The Last Temptation of Christ', Paul Schrader has shown that he can bring passion to tough treatments.  'Auto Focus' ought to be a perfect vehicle for him' tense, violent and sordidly perverse.  Is its failure a sign that he should stick to writing?  While no 'auteur', Schrader is a very good director.  He's never developed a style, per se, relying instead on a Douglas Sirk cum Nicholas Ray blend of social melodrama (e.g., 'Blue Collar', 'Hardcore', etc.)  His results with biographical cinema, however, are mixed.  'Mishima' is the best of this part of his work; 'Patty Hearst' is a disaster.  Then we have lopsided efforts like 'The Comfort of Strangers' and 'Witch Hunt', films marked by an icy detachment.  How do we explain the inconsistency?  Schrader didn't write them.  He didn't write 'Patty Hearst' either, as a matter of fact.  And while 'Auto Focus' is a passable script for a first timer, it isn't award-winning material and, once again, it isn't Schrader's.The biggest problem with Michael Gerbosi's script is proportion.  What begins as a simple Jekyll and Hyde piece loses focus at some point' grasping for something else to say and coming up empty-handed.  Much of the footage between Crane's second marriage and his tragic death could be removed without damaging the integrity of the narrative, and this comprises nearly one-third of its length.  The homoerotic syzygy that John Carpenter and Bob Crane represent may have been exciting to Gerbosi as playwright, but on the silver screen' it just doesn't work.  It works flawlessly in Sunset Boulevard, but, where Crane may be a kind of Joe Gillis, Carpenter is no Norma Desmond.  It works in American Beauty, but, where Carpenter may be a kind of Frank Fitts, Crane is no Lester Burnham.  No, what you have here are two moderately intriguing lowlifes, locked in a fatal embrace for most of the picture' each dragging the other into swingers' hell.Also absent are the establishing shots and broader character development that separate the seventh art from the stage.  The claustrophobic, egocentric 'Citizen Kane' got around this through the strength of its Mercury Theater cast.  In place of exterior shots, Welles gave us Kane's retinue for context.  Auto Focus is virtually all Greg Kinnear and Willem Dafoe and while lightly peppered with capable 'bit' players (e.g., Ron Leibman, Kurt Fuller and Ed Begley, Jr.) remains a bland, household recipe.  I knew Werner Klemperer personally, and it's a pity that Fuller isn't allowed to do more in portraying him here.  Werner had a wonderful acerbic sense of humor, indescribable and lost forever with his death.  Based on his accounts of Crane, the movie delivers an excellent depiction of the man's hypocrisy... a conservative, 'Christian' family man with a world-class libido.  Werner said, ""On the surface, he seemed a gregarious fellow, but, underneath the facade, he was antisocial and troubled... a social/antisocial, so to speak.""  This film's too-tight 'auto focus', unfortunately, fails to place this psyche in its proper milieu.Kinnear's self-loathing narcissist is on the mark, and I have to give him kudos for that.  He even managed to copy many of the actor's mannerisms and speech patterns.  It's brilliant work.  If at times he lacks some of Crane's smugness, we can forgive him.  His 'likeable' version says more about human nature than the off-putting original did.  I've heard 'Auto Focus' compared to 'Boogie Nights', as if Crane were as naive a patsy as Dirk Diggler.  This is simply false, and it does a tremendous disservice to Paul Thomas Anderson's ampler work.  At its core, 'Auto Focus' isn't a decent man's descent into dissolution.  It is an unholy union, predicated on superficiality, which turns ugly when one partner opts out.  When ultimately Carpenter wins the struggle, Crane posthumously exonerates him.  Yes, we get it, already:  They are halves of the same whole.  The 'reject-me-and-die' syndrome.  This is 'Star 80' all over again, an embarrassingly apologetic portrait of murder.",3,Citizen Crane: The Narrow Camera-Eye of,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,5430,"['many', 'Hollywood', 'productions',

Probably not based on comments by his family on various websites.  Perhaps they are protecting his seemingly seedy image, but at the end of the day evidence has been found to suggest that Crane spent many hours producing home blue movies.The film explores some interesting themes - the cost of fame, the bad side of money, and the value of friendships.  Greg Kinnear is excellent as Bob Crane, and William Dafoe is equally as good as the sleazy friend.At the end of the film I thought ""what a sad existence Bob had near the end"" but in a sense he was really happy with how his life ended up. Porn became his world, his obsession.",2,"Interesting, but so what?",1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,755,"['was', 'only', 'going', 'be', 'matter', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'film', 'life', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'Probably', 'not', 'based', 'comments', 'family', 'various', 'websites', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'protecting', 'seemingly', 'seedy', 'image', 'end', 'day', 'evidence', 'been', 'found', 'suggest', 'Crane', 'spent', 'many', 'hours', 'producing', 'home', 'blue', 'movies.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'themes', 'cost', 'fame', 'bad', 'side', 'money', 'value', 'friendships', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'excellent', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'sleazy', 'friend.At', 'end', 'film', 'thought', 'what', 'sad', 'existence', 'Bob', 'had', 'end', 'sense', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'how', 'life', 'ended', 'up', 'Porn', 'became', 'world', 'obsession']",Auto Focus VHS
