But this DVD is worth only 3 stars....Joe Satriani: Amazing guitarist.....BUT COME ON! He should have included songs that were not played as much in his shows and other DVD's.  Joe, if you read this....why the hell did you put in Satch Boogie, the Extremist, Mystical Potato??? These very same songs were played on Live in San Francisco! I was SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. Joe's sound was sounding like crap as well. Too much treble gave a very t hin and dirty sound that made listening hard. Starry Night was amazing but Midnight should not have been on here. There are way better of Satch that could easily have a spot on here. I am saddened by this.Steve Vai:  Ok Steve.....His set was alrite. I know you're here was a treat. But come on man, you should have played some acoustic as well to enhance your set! You just had a DVD come out and that was pretty much electric. A good addition would have been Sisters or Tender Surrender on here. Otherwise, Steve's sound was nice and rich.Yngwie Malmsteen: Cool setlist, I have to say. But it gets really boring after a while. REALLY BORING! He shreds and shreds and shreds and shreds.....its monotonous and boring. I just forward the songs to the ultimate of them all....the Jams!The G3 Jam: Kick ass. On Rockin in the free world Steve Vai's solo was just super super super noteworthy! I wouldnt be surprised if he wins a grammy for this performance. He really impressed me. Yngwie was ok, Joe was the worst. Also the show off guitar match between the three was kinda lame. It wasnt mind boggling. Its not too much watching Joe Satriani and Vai get into a guitar duel, leave alone Yngwie. Seeing Zakk Wylde and Dimebag get into a duel would be far more entertaining also because their personalities fit in so well.Little wing: Yngwie needed to be muted. He was shredding during Little wing. Yo, come on! This is little wing not Cowboys from Hell! Steve Vai was again the best one from this triplet guitar duo but Joe matched in well. Not bad at all. Yngwie could have been better.Voodoo Chile (slight return...whatever the hell that means!): Not special at all. None on the G's sounded top form. Must have been tired or something. It was good, but not remarkable at all.The sound of the DVD: Many people had trouble hearing Joe or Yngwie during the Jams. The sound was fancied around with in this DVD. So that could be of some concern. I deduct points for the complicated sound.Finally, This is a great DVD, but not something that will be widely remembered. It was a monumental tour without a doubt, but the DVD could hardly catch even 5% of the wonderful surprises it had to offer.One star for each of the Guitarists. Well done.

I find it funny that some self professed guitarists review this G3 album and talk about his redundancy and ho hum style of play. Yngwie is Yngwie and he is worthy of playing with Satriani and Vai or they wouldn't have asked him to play with them. For the guitarists that review this and slam Yngwie, when are we going to see your name next to Satriani and Vai.With that being said, yes Yngwie is somewhat of a throwback but I think it really adds to the diversity of this show. I am very happy I bought this and would recommend to anyone. Some good stage antics but definitely some great playing. I am now going to get the other two DVD's with great anticipation. I have Petrucci on Jazz CD's and have not heard Eric Johnson.....at least I don't think I have.I would really love to see some other guitarists in the lineup in the future..Robert Fripp, Ritchie Blackmore (if he still plays), Stanley Clarke on bass (I don't know if he is still around) and possibly Al Dimeola if he still plays.

799681,A17VI5JKD3AQFH,B0001CCY0G,cd-heaven,"[3, 7]","The 2003 G3 tour...with the usual tag team of Satriani and Vai rounding out this year with none other than Yngwie Malmsteen.  Malmsteen's popularity has severly dwindled since the dawn of the 90's, but somehow the man contiues to still makes records.  While most of his releases offer nothing (musically) new, he is still an extremely gifted guitarist.  His first three records in the 80's with Rising Force are probably his best 3, with Fire and Ice (92), and Facing the Animal (98) rounding out the Top 5.  I've seen Yngwie twice live (before this G3 tour) and I must say I've never seen anyone play the guitar more viciously and furiously as he does.  He must go through about 150 guitar picks per show.  Everyone who says Malmsteen sucks here and raves about Vai and Satch need to know something about guitar playing.  Any real guitarist (which I myself do not even play guitar) will tell you Malmsteen on this tour was the only one of the (G)3 playing a real guitar.  You try playing a Fender Strat at his speed and not have that guitar go out of tune on you!.  I'm not saying Vai and Satch are not great guitarist, because they both are also, but they play those silly Ibanez guitars that never blow out no matter how much they bend the strings.  And speaking of Vai, is it me or does his guitar tone sound like it's got no balls?  I mean, this dude has a crappy amp set up.  So, if you put a Fender Strat in each of these guitarist hands and let it rip, you'll see them switch their guitar's about 4 times each during a song!!! I've seen Yngwie live and he does it all night long.  So to wrap up my review, this is an awesome DVD, and the jam at the end is great, (actually worth the price alone!), just don't listen to all these other Amazon-knuckleheads who say Yngwie blows or ruins this DVD, cause anyone who could play guitar like him, I'd like to hear that!",5,Whoever says Malmsteen sucks can eat shit,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1870,"['2003', 'G3', 'tour', 'usual', 'tag', 'team', 'Satriani', 'Vai', 'rounding', 'out', 'year', 'none', 'other', 'Malmsteen', 'Malmsteen', 'popularity', 'severly', 'dwindled', 'dawn', '90', 'somehow', 'man', 'still', 'records', 'most', 'releases', 'offer', 'nothing', 'musically', 'new', 'still', 'extremely', 'gifted', 'guitarist', 'first', 'three', 'records', '80', 'Rising', 'Force', 'are', 'probably', 'best', '3', 'Fire', 'Ice', '92', 'Facing', 'Animal', '98', 'rounding', 'out', 'Top', '5', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Yngwie', 'twice', 'live', 'G3', 'tour', 'must', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'play', 'guitar', 'more', 'viciously', 'furiously', 'must', 'go', 'about', '150', 'guitar', 'picks', 'show', 'Everyone', 'who', 'Malmsteen', 'sucks', 'here', 'Vai', 'Satch', 'need', 'know', 'something', 'guitar', 'playing', 'real', 'guitarist', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'play', 'guitar', 'will', 'tell', 'Malmsteen', 'tour', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'G', '3', 'playing', 'real', 'guitar', 'try', 'playing', 'Fender', 'Strat', 'speed', 'not', 'have', 'guitar', 'go', 'tune', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Vai', 'Satch', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'guitarist', 'are', 'also', 'play', 'silly', 'Ibanez', 'guitars', 'never', 'blow', 'out', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'bend', 'strings', 'speaking', 'Vai', 'guitar', 'tone', 'sound', 'got', 'balls', 'mean', 'dude', 'crappy', 'amp', 'set', 'up', 'So', 'put', 'Fender', 'Strat', 'guitarist', 'hands', 'let', 'rip', ""'ll"", 'see', 'switch', 'guitar', '4', 'times', 'song', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Yngwie', 'live', 'night', 'long', 'So', 'wrap', 'up', 'review', 'awesome', 'DVD', 'jam', 'end', 'great', 'actually', 'price', 'alone', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'other', 'Amazon-knuckleheads', 'who', 'say', 'Yngwie', 'blows', 'DVD', 'cause', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'guitar', ""'d"", 'like', 'hear']",N/A

Mr. Malmstien can wail all over the fretboard like a mad man but it would be nice if he would actually compose some music. Arpegios and blazing neck length scales are impressive but tiresome after all of 2 minutes. The ""Live in Concert"" DVD (filmed in Mineapolis) with Erik Johnson is WAYYYYYY better in every way. Vai, Satch and Johnson have a chemestry that just works. The songs played by Satch and Vai are better on the Johnson concert and they are each in absolute top form in every set. The last set with all 3 maistros is blues/rock oriented and is so well done! I was absolutely amazed how well Satch and Vai incorporated thier unique playing to more traditional blues/rock covers.

799689,A2FQDF8QE9B9BC,B0001CCY0G,"H. Detter ""Finally""","[4, 4]","This disk is loaded with stellar guitar playing and showmanship. It's broken down into 4 sections: 3 with the name players with their respective bands, 1 with the 3 name players all jamming together with Joe Satriani's band. The dvd starts with Joe Satriani's performance. The 4 songs included have all been recorded live elsewhere so there's nothing new here. However, I loved the performances. I never thought Joe was a player who uses his music to showcase his technique. Nothing about his performances on this dvd has changed my opinion. I like the vibe that Joe has throughout his set: cool and laid back while playing aggressive sounding songs. Steve Vai's set is next and I found it very exciting. Steve has a way of being showy but without seeming like it's coming from someone who is arrogant. Not an easy thing to pull off in my opinion. The first song, which he did with the &quot;three headed monster&quot;, was interesting if not exactly memorable for its melodic content. &quot;Juice&quot; is an energetic boogie with some of Steve's patented smooth as silk playing. Watching Billy Sheehan's performance, on this song, is also worth its weight in gold. The guy was truly &quot;into it&quot;. Watch how Steve pulls his entire band together for the last song in his set &quot;I'm The Hell Outta Here&quot;. The section where they're all taking turns kind of reminds me of the Dixie Dregs &quot;Cruise Control&quot;. Yngwie Malmsteen is the last of the solo sets. He played various instrumentals pulled from several albums. After a while, the songs all sound the same to me. Double bass drums, muted rhythm guitar and squealing keyboards. But I enjoyed it. I'm one who tends to enjoy Yngwie's music in small doses and 4 songs here were just enough. I personally didn't like the sound of a pick being used to play a nylon string guitar on his solo piece but that's uh, nitpicking. Finally, the jam. Of course, it was used as a vehicle for each player to solo over sections of a well known rock song but I loved the beginning of &quot;Rockin' In A Free World&quot; where they all harmonized. It was amazing to hear how their own guitar sounds meshed so well together. The last two songs, both from Jimi Hendrix &quot;Little Wing&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Chile - Slight Return&quot;, were played so sloppily I found little to enjoy. That is except, of course, the solos. Yngwie played a million notes that, to me, were all worth hearing. Steve's solos showed his versatility in various techniques and settings. Joe's solos showed his cool, laid back, into the song - vibe. All in all, an enjoyable dvd if you love guitar playing.",4,MAKES ME WISH I HAD BEEN THERE,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,2635,"['disk', 'loaded', 'stellar', 'guitar', 'playing', 'showmanship', 'broken', 'down', '4', 'sections', '3', 'name', 'players', 'respective', 'bands', '1', '3', 'name', 'players', 'jamming', 'together', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'band', 'dvd', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'performance', '4', 'songs', 'included', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'live', 'elsewhere', 'so', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'However', 'loved', 'performances', 'never', 'thought', 'Joe', 'was', 'player', 'who', 'music', 'showcase', 'technique', 'Nothing', 'performances', 'dvd', 'changed', 'opinion', 'vibe', 'Joe', 'set', 'cool', 'laid', 'back', 'playing', 'aggressive', 'sounding', 'songs', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'set', 'next', 'found', 'very', 'exciting', 'Steve', 'way', 'being', 'showy', 'seeming', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'arrogant', 'Not', 'easy', 'thing', 'pull', 'off', 'opinion', 'first', 'song', 'did', 'quot', 'three', 'headed', 'monster', 'quot', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'exactly', 'memorable', 'melodic', 'content', 'quot', 'Juice', 'quot', 'energetic', 'boogie', 'Steve', 'patented', 'silk', 'playing', 'Watching', 'Billy', 'Sheehan', 'performance', 'song', 'also', 'worth', 'weight', 'gold', 'guy', 'was', 'truly', 'quot', 'quot', 'Watch', 'how', 'Steve', 'entire', 'band', 'together', 'last', 'song', 'set', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Hell', 'Outta', 'Here', 'quot', 'section', 'where', ""'re"", 'taking', 'turns', 'kind', 'reminds', 'Dixie', 'Dregs', 'quot', 'Cruise', 'Control', 'quot', 'Yngwie', 'Malmsteen', 'last', 'solo', 'sets', 'played', 'various', 'instrumentals', 'pulled', 'several', 'albums', 'while', 'songs', 'sound', 'same', 'Double', 'bass', 'drums', 'muted', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'squealing', 'keyboards', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Yngwie', 'music', 'small', 'doses', '4', 'songs', 'here', 'were', 'just', 'enough', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'pick', 'being', 'used', 'play', 'nylon', 'string', 'guitar', 'solo', 'piece', 'uh', 'nitpicking', 'Finally', 'jam', 'course', 'was', 'used', 'vehicle', 'player', 'solo', 'sections', 'well', 'known', 'rock', 'song', 'loved', 'beginning', 'quot', 'Rockin', 'A', 'Free', 'World', 'quot', 'where', 'harmonized', 'was', 'amazing', 'hear', 'how', 'own', 'guitar', 'sounds', 'meshed', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'last', 'two', 'songs', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'quot', 'Little', 'Wing', 'quot', 'quot', 'Voodoo', 'Chile', 'Slight', 'Return', 'quot', 'were', 'played', 'so', 'sloppily', 'found', 'little', 'enjoy', 'course', 'solos', 'Yngwie', 'played', 'million', 'notes', 'were', 'worth', 'hearing', 'Steve', 'solos', 'showed', 'versatility', 'various', 'techniques', 'settings', 'Joe', 'solos', 'showed', 'cool', 'laid', 'back', 'song', 'vibe', 'enjoyable', 'dvd', 'love', 'guitar', 'playing']",N/A
799690,A32Z8ZV7E5N8AV,B0001CCY0G,Jack,"[5, 5]","As guitar player of about 15 years now and just getting back into it, I was pleased to discover this DVD. Most of my familarity with Satch, Vai and Malmsteen was from their earlier years and were most inspiring to me to start learning in the first place. I found all guitarists enjoyable to watch, though they still sounded pretty similar to they did when I first heard them 15 years ago. In this regard, after about the third watch, I was ready for something else a bit different, though I guess maintaining a certain style continues to keep your style definition distinctive as you can always tell its a Satch riff or Malmsteen lick. And I guess no matter how familiar these guys are, its still impressive to see them play and wish you could play as half as good.Satch's performnace was easy to listen to as he usually has some memorable melody central to his compositions, and still using his trademark artifical harmonics, which I thought at times were a bit overdone.Vai was interesting to listen to as he still comes up with quirky sounds. I did find his overall guitar sound a bit benign, expecially in the jam session. Not sure what set up he was using but it had no real edge to it.Malmsteen as always was a showman (though entertaing enough) and at times during the jam session almost seemed to over shadow the others restraint. Some who find the less is more approach better may find his repetitive appregios and sweep picking superfluous, but thats just Malmsteen, love him or hate him. His acoustic number was a good contrast but it seems he forgot himself a bit when he started strumming it before going back to his neoclassical self. I did find it amusing though, having not seen a picture of him for a few years, he's now a much fuller version, but still sporting the leather pants, puffy shirt and air leg kicks.The sound was pretty good, but that may depend on what system you play your DVD's through.  I find music DVD's always sound fuller in stereo. The whole surround sound thing for music just doesnt work for me as when you see a musician perform live, they're going to be in front of you, not behind you like your surround sound speakers. The camera work was good too, showing fret board close ups regularly. If you buy a DVD to see guitar playing, you're not so interested in the expressions on the players face as much as what their hands are doing.Anyway, overall, still immensly impressed by their talents and abilities, the DVD quality and production was high, but there wasnt anything really groundbreaking by these guitarists. I guess the average person would buy this not because of what they might do, but because of what they have already done and so want to hear/see it again.",4,Impressive rather than progressive,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,2712,"['guitar', 'player', '15', 'years', 'now', 'just', 'getting', 'back', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'DVD', 'Most', 'familarity', 'Satch', 'Vai', 'Malmsteen', 'was', 'earlier', 'years', 'were', 'most', 'inspiring', 'start', 'learning', 'first', 'place', 'found', 'guitarists', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'still', 'sounded', 'pretty', 'similar', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'heard', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'regard', 'third', 'watch', 'was', 'ready', 'something', 'else', 'bit', 'different', 'guess', 'maintaining', 'certain', 'style', 'keep', 'style', 'definition', 'distinctive', 'can', 'always', 'tell', 'Satch', 'riff', 'Malmsteen', 'lick', 'guess', 'matter', 'how', 'familiar', 'guys', 'are', 'still', 'impressive', 'see', 'play', 'wish', 'could', 'play', 'as', 'half', 'good.Satch', 'performnace', 'was', 'easy', 'listen', 'usually', 'memorable', 'melody', 'central', 'compositions', 'still', 'using', 'trademark', 'artifical', 'harmonics', 'thought', 'times', 'were', 'bit', 'overdone.Vai', 'was', 'interesting', 'listen', 'still', 'up', 'quirky', 'sounds', 'did', 'find', 'overall', 'guitar', 'sound', 'bit', 'benign', 'expecially', 'jam', 'session', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'using', 'had', 'real', 'edge', 'it.Malmsteen', 'always', 'was', 'showman', 'entertaing', 'enough', 'times', 'jam', 'session', 'almost', 'seemed', 'others', 'restraint', 'who', 'find', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'better', 'may', 'find', 'repetitive', 'appregios', 'sweep', 'picking', 'superfluous', 'thats', 'just', 'Malmsteen', 'love', 'hate', 'acoustic', 'number', 'was', 'good', 'contrast', 'forgot', 'bit', 'when', 'started', 'strumming', 'going', 'back', 'neoclassical', 'self', 'did', 'find', 'amusing', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'picture', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'much', 'fuller', 'version', 'still', 'sporting', 'leather', 'pants', 'puffy', 'shirt', 'air', 'leg', 'kicks.The', 'sound', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'may', 'depend', 'what', 'system', 'play', 'DVD', 'find', 'music', 'DVD', 'always', 'sound', 'fuller', 'stereo', 'whole', 'surround', 'sound', 'thing', 'music', 'just', 'doesnt', 'work', 'when', 'see', 'musician', 'perform', 'live', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'front', 'not', 'surround', 'sound', 'speakers', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'showing', 'fret', 'board', 'close', 'ups', 'regularly', 'buy', 'DVD', 'see', 'guitar', 'playing', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'interested', 'expressions', 'players', 'face', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'hands', 'are', 'doing.Anyway', 'overall', 'still', 'immensly', 'impressed', 'talents', 'abilities', 'DVD', 'quality', 'production', 'was', 'high', 'there', 'wasnt', 'anything', 'really', 'groundbreaking', 'guitarists', 'guess', 'average', 'person', 'would', 'buy', 'not', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'want', 'hear/see', 'again']",N/A
799691,A5XU9GCSRUNMK,B0001CCY0G,Jeff Arenson,"[5, 5]","G3 Live from Denver is a DVD for rock guitar fanatics. If you don't like anything that any of these guys put out before, this isn't going to convert you. If you like any of these three or all three, you're going to love this. The format is the same as the first G3 DVD. There is a set by each musician, and then all 3 join forces for encore jams of cover songs. I didn't like this one as much as the other, but there are still many moments of greatness. The sets break down like this:Joe Satriani:I dont' know what happened to Joe. Don't get me wrong, the man can still play. He used to be the most improvisational/Creative guitarist of any genre on the planet. Check out Dreaming #11 or the '88 show part of Time Machine's second disc. Simply unreal. Joe hasn't done anything like that since, but I can't complain about this set. He does have a nice intro into ""Satch Boogie"", and he finishes with a brief flurry at the end of it. 'The Extremist"" is pretty much a verbatim duplication of the studio version. ""Starry Night"" is a new song and sounds like other Joe ballads as far as style and tone, but it is still good. ""Midnight"" is next and Joe displays his two-handed ability.(I did mention that he can play still, didn't I?) He even adds a little bit of improv to this version. ""The Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing"" is the last song and is also done verbatim. I love this song, but it would be far more interesting if Joe took one of the themes and went off to another world with it. Overall, a good set of music, Joe shows his diversity and taste. I just remember how things were before Joe had improvised as much/little as Rush or Yes.Steve Vai:Vai shows the world that he is probably the most creative and improvisational Rock guitarist on the planet. It used to be Joe, but as I mentioned he doesn't do that as much anymore. Vai plays 3 songs only. I never heard the first or last songs before, and I believe that he wrote them for this tour. The first song is entitled ""I know You're Here"" and starts off with Steve playing unaccompanied and using looping for a one man jam. The song turns into a typically creative Vai song that is loaded with virtuosity, despite the presence of Vai singing for a few measures. If this song was on a disc, I'd buy it. ""Juice"" is another Vai original and is loaded with more chops,etc. ""I'm The Hell Outta Here"" is the other new song and turns into a chops fest with the whole band. First Sheehan gets a few bars of madness and then Vai, Macalpine, Sheehan and Weiner all go to the front of the stage and exchange notes and short chordal phrases. Although this does seem comical at first viewing, it does end up having some good parts. There are moments of interplay between all 4, but it wasn't anything like the unison lines that I've heard Vai and Sheehan do. The jam turns into Vai and Macalpine dueling and trading fours, which does become interesting, to say the least, especially when Tony switches to keyboards and doesn't miss a beat/note. This tune ends up becoming a lot of fun and seems to be a large improvisation for the most part. Over the last couple of years, Steve Vai has given me reason to buy everthing he has released, and this set continues my thinking that Vai is the best Rock orientated guitarist around.Yngwie Malmsteen:Let's face it. Other than Hendrix and Van Halen has there been a more influencial rock guitarist than Yngwie? His emergence in the mid 80's led to two types of guitarists. One, loved what they heard and wanted to sound like him and spent hours trying to copy his style. The other couldn't stand him, and spent hours trying to do as much as they could to not sound like him. There is good and bad with Yngwie's set.The bad/ugly: There is something comical about a thirty-something guy who has gained a few pounds, trying to dress and act like he is still 20. I had to pause Yngwie's set before it even started to laugh. Yngwie even has all of the same stage antics since I first saw him in 1985. His show seems very 'Spinal Tap' at times. Once I got over the fact that Yngwie still thinks he is 20, I paid attention to the music which leads me to the;Good: The man can still play. Yes, his style hasn't changed one bit since he first came onto the scene;However, Yngwie is the only Classical/metal guitarist that still has a worldwide fan base. If it still works, then why bother changing? The set is one-hundred-percent instrumental(Thank God) Yngiwe opens with a flurry of notes, and then plays 'Evil Eye' which is from his first Cd and also on a live Alcatrazz recording. This is one of my favorite tunes by him and he delivers a great version of it. Yngwie plays a new instrumental called 'Baroque and Roll' from a new cd and it sounds like the same format that all of his instrumentals have.(except the Guitar/Orchestra stuff) Still, if you like the formula, then you'll be loving this. ""Acoustic Guitar Solo"" is exactly what the title says. There aren't many people out there that can play acoustic like Yngwie. He displays chops, etc. during this piece. There is even a mini-version of Bach's 'Air' which is beautifully played and he also does the intro. to 'Black Star'. He doesn't let this solo last 10 minutes, so I found it enertaining instead of overly self-indulgent.(Just self-indulgent) Yngwie then plays the intro to Paganini's 4th violin concerto and follows that with 'Adagio'. ""Adagio"" is a shred fest based on Albinoni's adagio for Organ/Strings. The original classical piece is a beatiful adagio and Yngwie turns it into a big notes display. Still, even though it really completely leaves the original intent of the piece, it is entertaining. Yngwie showed with 'Air' that he can duplicate a classical piece, I guess he wanted to play a lot of notes and improvise a piece. Last is 'Far Beyond the Sun' which has been a Malmsteen concert staple since 1985. This is another classical influenced piece of mayhem from his first Cd. Great back then and still is now. At the end of this piece, Yngwie decides to break a guitar. I am sure someone out there likes seeing this, but it isn't me. I would have rather had another song. Once I got over the comical aspects, this is a great set of Malmsteen guitar instrumentals.3 Man Jam:'Keep On Rocking in the Free World'? If this was an acoustic summit, then I'd understand playing Neil Young, but it still works. The guitarists then delve into Hendrix with 'Little Wing' and 'Voodoo Child(Slight Return)'. These two songs are great and the improvistion is awesome. Malmsteen does his thing while Vai and Satriani seem to be one person at times. Satriani shows that he can still create and improvise with the best of them and his sections seem the best to me. This is always a G3 highlight and this jam session is no exception.There you have it. If you like these guys, then you'll love this. I like it a lot and recommend it to guitar fans.",4,For Guitar Fanatics x3,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,6893,"['G3', 'Live', 'Denver', 'DVD', 'rock', 'guitar', 'fanatics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like',

Schneider ""john_jps""","[4, 6]","Of the three G3 concerts currently available on DVD, this is by far the best you'll see from Vai: he first plays a tune on his triple-neck Jem, and it truly is a cool tune, using all three necks, each neck featuring either a different tuning or different effect, which he combines to turn into a very well-thought composition.  He also brings a bit of talent to it, so it's fun from that aspect as well.  After this, they launch into ""Juice"" which is arguably Vai's single best ""bouncy shred"" tune.  Then as if that weren't enough they go into ""I'm the Hell Outta Here"" and really tear the roof off.  Vai's set is why this CD gets the stars that I've given it.Satch: this is a good set and of the three G3 concerts, probably his best.  Joe is very consistent in general though, so it's hard to pick a favorite.  He contributes to the overall experience, but still doesn't command the way Vai does.  Even some songs I thought would be exciting to see (e.g. ""Midnight"") were a little disppointing.Malmsteen: well, the guy can sure blaze, but it gets boring very quickly... he's also just a complete dork, still living in the 80's or something.  It's pretty sad, actually, because it's not like he's a bad player or anything.  I wish he'd just focus on his monstrous ability to play perfectly, and not so much on jumping around like a moron.  Also, he really needs better tone.  I think he ruined the upper registers of his hearing long ago because his tone is all tinny and ""ice pick in the ear"" if you know what I mean.  I'd love to hear Malmsteen playing with the sort of tones Petrucci uses.  As far as G3 DVDs go, yeah - Petrucci is the best, Johnson is OK but also just ho-hum, and Malmsteen is probably the worst.If you like Vai, you unfortunately MUST get this DVD, because he's just jaw-dropping on here.  If you don't, then avoid this: he's really the only thing worth paying money for here...

And why not, in this case the `third wheel' they've taken on board with them is neo-classical guitar maestro Yngwie Malmsteen. Which is firstly a brave move but also a really smart one as Malmsteens style is so different from that of either Vai or Satriani.As for the DVD itself it was shot in Denver, as per the title, on October 20th 2003. The tracklisting consists of five songs by Satriani who is first cab off the rank, then three tunes from Vai followed by five numbers from Malmsteen. After that the three get together for a jam session comprised o Rockin' In The Free World, Little Wing and Voodoo Child (Slight Return).This DVD has a few special features such as fretcam on some songs and brief biographies of the protagonists as well as a few other minor bits and pieces.Needless to say that all the songs are well played and the great thing about such a three way line up is that if, say, the more eclectic stuff of Vai isn't to your taste there are only a few songs of it. Or if you aren't into the blues touched fluid axe moments of Satriani well your not sitting through a whole 90 minutes of him. So really this is a great pick up for someone who doesn't know much about these guys OR who someone who knows heaps about one but perhaps not the others. It must be said however that Malmsteens set seems a bit weird in that his guitar is mixed so far back that it's not the slashing, screaming and diving assault on your ears that he normally produces. And having seen him live in 2006 it's not how he plays. So either this is a dis or just how he was playing on this tour, experimenting with his sound.All that aside I would have to say this is probably not a bad buy for instrumental guitar dudes to pick up. But the extras are minor, the venue isn't exactly salubrious nor are the stage production values indicative of any budget. So pick it up by all means, but don't spend too much on it.Four stars given it's variety and usefulness for the long term fan as well as the newcomer to the genre.",4,Serviceable bare bones release,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,2141,"['G3', 'awesome', 'institution', 'guitar', 'fretboard', 'gymnastics', 'set', 'up', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'just', 'content', 'roll', 'ever', 'why', 'not', 'case', 'third', 'wheel', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'board', 'neo-classical', 'guitar', 'maestro', 'Yngwie', 'Malmsteen', 'Which', 'firstly', 'brave', 'move', 'also', 'really', 'smart', 'one', 'Malmsteens', 'style', 'so', 'different', 'Vai', 'Satriani.As', 'DVD', 'was', 'shot', 'Denver', 'title', 'October', '20th', '2003', 'tracklisting', 'consists', 'five', 'songs', 'Satriani', 'who', 'first', 'cab', 'rank', 'then', 'three', 'tunes', 'Vai', 'followed', 'five', 'numbers', 'Malmsteen', 'three', 'get', 'together', 'jam', 'session', 'comprised', 'o', 'Rockin', 'Free', 'World', 'Little', 'Wing', 'Voodoo', 'Child', 'Slight', 'Return', '.This', 'DVD', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'fretcam', 'songs', 'brief', 'biographies', 'protagonists', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'minor', 'bits', 'pieces.Needless', 'say', 'songs', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'great', 'thing', 'three', 'way', 'line', 'up', 'say', 'more', 'eclectic', 'stuff', 'Vai', ""n't"", 'taste', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'blues', 'touched', 'fluid', 'axe', 'moments', 'Satriani', 'well', 'not', 'sitting', 'whole', '90', 'minutes', 'So', 'really', 'great', 'pick', 'up', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'guys', 'who', 'someone', 'who', 'heaps', 'one', 'perhaps', 'not', 'others', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'however', 'Malmsteens', 'set', 'bit', 'weird', 'guitar', 'mixed', 'so', 'far', 'back', 'not', 'slashing', 'screaming', 'diving', 'assault', 'ears', 'normally', 'having', 'seen', 'live', '2006', 'not', 'how', 'So', 'either', 'dis', 'just', 'how', 'was', 'playing', 'tour', 'experimenting', 'sound.All', 'aside', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'probably', 'not', 'bad', 'buy', 'instrumental', 'guitar', 'dudes', 'pick', 'up', 'extras', 'are', 'minor', 'venue', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'salubrious', 'are', 'stage', 'production', 'values', 'indicative', 'budget', 'So', 'pick', 'up', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'it.Four', 'stars', 'given', 'variety', 'usefulness', 'long', 'term', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'newcomer', 'genre']",N/A

However, I had my doubts when I ordered this DVD as I suspected that it may just be another show of ego with a thousand notes per second.  I was pleasantly surprised when I popped it in and found a laid back and fun show.  Satch, while relatively less technical then the other two on the ticket, is my favorite because he plays with the most taste and feel.  His set is rockin' and the least mechanical of the three.  His note choice and style is just more mature and reminds me of what a great electric guitar player sounds like.  No frills Joe never disappoints.  Vai's playing is maturing nicely and he is starting to play from the heart.  He is arguable the best all around electric guitar player alive for his technical ability and music breadth of knowledge is matched by few.  Unfortunately, Vai only gets a few songs in this set, so he doesn't get a chance to really shine on this DVD, though I really like his treatment of Hendrix's ""Little Wing.""Malmsteen was a great treat to see.  Having never seen him live but casually respecting his audio work, I was very interested to see this legendary machine do his thing.  What Malmsteen lacks in feel and taste he makes up for in grand style with stunning command of the guitar.  Truly, he is an amazing guitar player.

Vai's stuff was innovative and creative (his first piece on a triple-neck was the highlight of the show for me) and Malmsteen's flawless fretwork was awe-inspiring. That said, I found myself digging the group jam more than Satch and Yngwie's solo stuff. The three stars are for Vai's brilliant set and the jam. The downside of this DVD are the bare-bones extras, Malmsteen's tinny tone and a lack of dynamics across the board. What I mean is, too many of the tunes are too frantic, especially Yngwie, who I can only take in small doses. It's a pity, because if you ever heard his song ""Crying"", you know that his incomparable technique can be mesmerizing when he chooses to play with some feeling.

799709,A1BS8YM712C0VJ,B0001CCY0G,Will Culp,"[5, 7]","(Actual Rating- 4.5 Stars)G3: Live In Denver(2003). Concert Footage of The G3 Concert, featuring Joe Satriani,  Steve Vai, and Yngwie Malmsteen.In 2003, The G3 Concert came to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium in Colorado, and fans got to see almost two amazing hours of the most amazing guitarists in the business, featuring the multi-talented Joe Satriani, the technical Steve Vai, and the lightning fast Neo-Classical metal of Yngwie Malmsteen. Fortuneatly, the concert footage was saved and released in 2004, and since has become one of the best-selling concert DVD's out in stores. So, do these guitarists live up to their stellar playing which has amazed millions, or do they drown in their own overplaying? Read on to find out!Joe Satriani has been in the business for a long time, best known for his platinum shred album 'Surfing With The Alien', which contains one of the few instrumentals (""Satch Boogie"") that you might ever hear on the radio. Clearly, for G3, Satriani was in his prime, as his blend of funk, rock, boogie, and shred never ceased to keep me amazed. From the funky ""Satch Boogie"" to ""The Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing"", Satriani plays the most versatile set-list, mixing the headbanging hard rock of ""The Extremist"", but balancing it with slower songs, such as the dreamy, melodic ""Starry Night"", one of the most beautiful guitar pieces I've ever heard. Satriani's performance was purely amazing, and I will definitely be buying more of his material.Steve Vai, best known for his hit solo album 'Passion and Warfare' and his stints with David Lee Roth and Whitesnake, has always been a guitarist who's totally original, breaking new ground and doing things with a guitar many people had probably never thought of. From his setlist, we only get to hear three songs, but they're all exceptionally long, so Steve plays as much as the others. He begins with a slow, introspective piece called ""I Know You're Here"", where Vai breaks out his triple-neck guitar and improvises for about ten minutes. He then breaks into ""Juice"" and ""I'm The Hell Outta Here"", two fun rockers that find Vai shredding out of his mind and playing his guitar to the breaking point. What can I say... another great performance!Yngwie Malmsteen was the first of these artists to hit it big, as neo-classical and shred bands became popular in the 80's. He became a legend with his first three albums, which showed he was unparalled when it came to speed and theory. While Satriani and Vai are more laid-back performers, Malmsteen is right up in your face, smashing his guitars and doing all sorts of things, making for an entertaining performance. Malmsteen rips out his usual neo-classical metal, but, for me, his performance was the least entertaining, because all his songs seemed to similar to each other, but songs like his acoustic guitar solo and ""Adagio"" were nice breaks from the other songs. If you like Malmsteen a lot, my complaints shouldn't bother you, as his playing was still great!Overall, I think this was a very good concert. Steve Vai and Joe Satriani put on amazing performances, while Yngwie put on a good one too. Even though all their performances were amazing, I was really thrilled with the ending Jam Session, where all three guitarists got together and played Neil Youngs' ""Rockin' In The Free World"" and Jimi Hendrix's ""Little Wing"" and ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"". This was a very interesting jam, and it was very entertaining to see these artists expressing themselves through some of their favorite artists. For about two hours worth of footage, and the generally low price of this DVD, I strongly recommend buying this!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SHRED, ROCK, AND ANYBODY WHO PLAYS THE GUITAR...
