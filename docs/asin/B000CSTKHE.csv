962492,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000CSTKHE,Ernest Jagger,"[18, 19]","I picked up this DVD, ""Bunshinsaba,"" along with about 14 other Korean and Japanese DVDs a few years ago when one of the Asian Video stores where I lived was relocating and having a bargain sale. All were new and in packaging: And since I never saw any of these horror films, and the price was great, I decided to purchase them. I don't regret it one bit. This is a very good film. I have seen my share of Korean and Japanese horror films, and think that the director, Byeong-ki Ahn, who also directed Nightmare [aka: Gawi] and ""Phone"" did an excellent job with this film. First of all, it was very different from many in the horror genre in terms of suspense and creepiness.Some of my friends do not particularly care for this film, therefore, I would suggest you rent the film first. But I do think it is well worth the purchase. And although there are similar traits in this film as with other Asian horror films, this does not detract from the film one bit: due to the fact that this film is very well acted and directed. There is not too much scare factor in this film, [although it does have its share] as much as there is suspense. The film begins with a bullied classmate at an all-girls school named Lee Yu-jin (Se-eun Lee). Being fed up with the constant harassment, she decides to put a curse on the other girls who are picking on her. Moreover, two of her friends participate in this activity. They make a special numberboard; and after chanting the name 'Bunshinsaba' a few times, the curse is in effect.The girls who were picking on them begin to die. A sort of self-suicide, as each student sets themselves on fire on different days. As these students begin to die one by one, the film veers towards another area at the school: The administration. It appears that the principal and his entire staff, along with the people of this town have been covering up a terrible deed from long ago. Yu-jin does not realize that a student was killed over 30-years-ago [no spoilers] and her name was Kim In-suk (Yu-ri Lee). Also, (Yu-ri Lee) did a very convincing role in her part. Plus, there is something peculiar with the new teacher in class, Lee Eun-ju (Gyu-ri Kim). There is more to her than meets the eye. The ghostly haunting and revenge in the film is great, and the conclusion is very good. If you like Asian horror, then I recommend this film highly.

It's a bit more complicated, but for the sake of this review's length I'll leave it a that. Bunshinsaba is a spooky ghost vengeance tale.The story is very creepy and effective, using jump-scares, tension, and disturbing imagery wisely. It does have a rough start, but eventually smoothens out and becomes easier to follow. It's consistent, as in it's a balanced story that doesn't solely rely on one type of scare and it moves at an acceptable pace. The ending of the film was also creepy. It really is a scary film, although it is similar to other ghost-revenge stories from the region. The acting was great, and so was the music.

Unfortunately, it seems the series has gone on too long.""Bunshinsaba"" (Alternately known as ""Witchboard,"" ""Ouija Board,"" ""Kokuri san"" or a variety of international titles), starts with a group of three friends who are the target of bullies at school.  Seeking revenge, they make a version of a Ouija board and summon Bunshinsaba to do the job.  While summoning the spirit, the three girls are warned not to open their eyes, but one girl, Yoo-Jin doesn't follow the rules and sees a ghostly girl peering over their shoulders.  Predictably, one by one the bullies start to die, all by the same horrible method, their heads burned to a crisp.  Meanwhile, a new teacher in class starts doing roll call, and has a conversation with a non-existent student named Kim In-Sook.  It turns out that Kim In-Sook was a girl burned alive by the townspeople years ago, and she cursed the village, her spirit biding her time before she would be summoned up and able to enact her own revenge.What's really missing from ""Bunshinsaba"" is mood.  The story of Kim In-Sook is complicated, and takes too much time for the various people who remember her tale to each add their bit.  All the exposition stops the chills in their tracks, blocking any suspense that had been built up.  Its too bad, because the director has crafted some very chilling scenes, that work really well and make you wish for a better movie.  The method of death behind Kim In-Sook's revenge is particularly horrifying, and gave me a genuine shock.  Those few scenes raise the film up from being a total loss, but aren't enough to save the whole thing.I can forgive a horror movie for being predictable, if it is pulled off with some style and flair, and if it delivers sufficient scares to get me glancing behind me.  But it is hard to forgive one for being boring, and any horror movie that has more people sitting around a table talking than dark corridors and spooky ghosts, just doesn't cut it.",2,Ghostly revenge in a small Korean town,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2239,"['latest', 'unofficial', 'entry', 'Korean', 'horror', 'series', 'started', 'Whispering', 'Corridors', 'series', 'linked', 'mainly', 'thematically', 'taking', 'place', 'all-girl', 'high', 'schools', 'where', 'students', 'feel', 'modern', 'effects', 'past', 'wrong', 'doings', 'wrath', 'vengeful', 'ghosts', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'gone', 'too', 'long', 'Bunshinsaba', 'Alternately', 'known', 'Witchboard', 'Ouija', 'Board', 'Kokuri', 'san', 'variety', 'international', 'titles', 'group', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'target', 'bullies', 'school', 'Seeking', 'revenge', 'make', 'version', 'Ouija', 'board', 'summon', 'Bunshinsaba', 'do', 'job', 'summoning', 'spirit', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'warned', 'not', 'open', 'eyes', 'one', 'girl', 'Yoo-Jin', ""n't"", 'follow', 'rules', 'ghostly', 'girl', 'peering', 'over', 'shoulders', 'Predictably', 'one', 'one', 'bullies', 'start', 'die', 'same', 'horrible', 'method', 'heads', 'burned', 'crisp', 'Meanwhile', 'new', 'teacher', 'class', 'starts', 'doing', 'roll', 'call', 'conversation', 'non-existent', 'student', 'named', 'Kim', 'In-Sook', 'out', 'Kim', 'In-Sook', 'was', 'girl', 'burned', 'alive', 'townspeople', 'years', 'ago', 'cursed', 'village', 'spirit', 'biding', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'summoned', 'up', 'able', 'enact', 'own', 'revenge.What', 'really', 'missing', 'Bunshinsaba', 'mood', 'story', 'Kim', 'In-Sook', 'complicated', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'remember', 'tale', 'add', 'bit', 'exposition', 'chills', 'tracks', 'blocking', 'suspense', 'had', 'been', 'built', 'up', 'too', 'bad', 'director', 'crafted', 'very', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'make', 'wish', 'better', 'movie', 'method', 'death', 'Kim', 'In-Sook', 'revenge', 'particularly', 'horrifying', 'gave', 'genuine', 'shock', 'few', 'scenes', 'raise', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'total', 'loss', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'whole', 'thing.I', 'can', 'forgive', 'horror', 'movie', 'being', 'predictable', 'pulled', 'off', 'style', 'flair', 'sufficient', 'scares', 'get', 'glancing', 'hard', 'forgive', 'one', 'being', 'boring', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'people', 'sitting', 'table', 'talking', 'dark', 'corridors', 'spooky', 'ghosts', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut']",Witch Board
