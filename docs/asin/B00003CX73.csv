521115,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00003CX73,A Customer,"[1, 9]","Summary:The movie begins as Desert Storm ends in 1991.  Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and two of his fellow soldiers/friends, Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), find a map hidden in a surrendering Iraqi soldiers butt.  Knowing that Iraq has stolen money and gold from Kuwait they believe the map contains the directions to the bunker where it is stored.  Former special forces soldier Archie Gates (George Clooney), who is now escorting newswoman Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn), catches wind of the map and ends up joining the trio in attempting to take the gold from Iraq for themselves.  Archie distracts Adriana with false directions and leads the foursome into the Iraqi desert where they end up finding the gold, Iraqi civilians being held prisoner and being tortured, and plenty of Iraqi soldiers.My Comments:The reason I am torn over this movie is because it has too many perspectives and too many political messages.  At first it wants you to think that the American soldiers who are stealing the gold are just boys being boys.  Then the movie turns them into bad guys.  But in the end they end up the heroes.  All the while the Iraqi civilians are seen as oppressed and in desperate need of help and the Iraqi soldiers are made out to be both human (by being afraid of Saddam Hussein and having suffered dramatic losses) and inhumane for torturing and killing anyone they can.  In the end you don't really know who you are supposed to be rooting for which left me a little bothered by the whole thing.Also, the acting is surprisingly good seeing as how the last time (I believe) Wahlberg and Clooney teamed up - The Perfect Storm - the movie was about as bad as they come.  Perhaps the reason why is that they don't really have to do much acting.  Clooney isn't too bad, but Wahlberg just has to play a greedy young soldier who has a hidden heart.  Ice Cube isn't particularly outstanding, especially with his overly bizarre fascination with 'Christ fire' that never really makes much sense.  Spike Jonze, on the other hand, was pretty good at being the rather mindless soldier that he was trying to be.Admittedly, I liked the story.  And perhaps it should get a much higher review because, in a sense, it really does capture something of the picture of the relationship between Iraq and America in the two hour microcosm that makes up the movie - some Americans are greedy, some really want to help Iraqis, some Iraqis are monsters, and some are caring individuals that 'just want to cut hair', have a family, and live their lives.Overall, I have to recommend the movie because it does keep your attention and even, I hate to say it, makes you think a little bit.  Perhaps as I think about it over time I'll feel that it is worthy of a higher rating, but I just can't give it to it today.(On an interesting side note, I watched this movie at a unique time - the 2003 war with Iraq began just a couple of weeks ago and raised all of the same issues.)",3,I'm torn between hating and liking this one.,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,2969,"['Summary', 'movie', 'Desert', 'Storm', '1991', 'Troy', 'Barlow', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'two', 'fellow', 'soldiers/friends', 'Chief', 'Elgin', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Conrad', 'Vig', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'find', 'map', 'hidden', 'surrendering', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'butt', 'Knowing', 'Iraq', 'stolen', 'money', 'gold', 'Kuwait', 'believe', 'map', 'directions', 'bunker', 'where', 'stored', 'Former', 'special', 'forces', 'soldier', 'Archie', 'Gates', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'now', 'escorting', 'newswoman', 'Adriana', 'Cruz', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'wind', 'map', 'up', 'joining', 'trio', 'attempting', 'take', 'gold', 'Iraq', 'Archie', 'Adriana', 'false', 'directions', 'foursome', 'Iraqi', 'desert', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'gold', 'Iraqi', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'being', 'tortured', 'plenty', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers.My', 'Comments', 'reason', 'am', 'torn', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'perspectives', 'too', 'many', 'political', 'messages', 'first', 'think', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'stealing', 'gold', 'are', 'just', 'being', 'boys', 'Then', 'movie', 'bad', 'guys', 'end', 'end', 'up', 'heroes', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'are', 'seen', 'oppressed', 'desperate', 'need', 'help', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'are', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'afraid', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'having', 'suffered', 'dramatic', 'losses', 'inhumane', 'torturing', 'killing', 'anyone', 'can', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'rooting', 'left', 'little', 'bothered', 'whole', 'thing.Also', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'seeing', 'how', 'last', 'time', 'believe', 'Wahlberg', 'Clooney', 'teamed', 'up', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'bad', 'come', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'do', 'much', 'acting', 'Clooney', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Wahlberg', 'just', 'play', 'greedy', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'hidden', 'heart', 'Ice', 'Cube', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'overly', 'bizarre', 'fascination', ""'Christ"", 'fire', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'sense', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'being', 'rather', 'mindless', 'soldier', 'was', 'trying', 'be.Admittedly', 'liked', 'story', 'perhaps', 'should', 'get', 'much', 'higher', 'review', 'sense', 'really', 'capture', 'something', 'picture', 'relationship', 'Iraq', 'America', 'two', 'hour', 'microcosm', 'up', 'movie', 'Americans', 'are', 'greedy', 'really', 'want', 'help', 'Iraqis', 'Iraqis', 'are', 'monsters', 'are', 'caring', 'individuals', ""'just"", 'want', 'cut', 'hair', 'have', 'family', 'live', 'lives.Overall', 'have', 'recommend', 'movie', 'keep', 'attention', 'even', 'hate', 'say', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'Perhaps', 'think', 'time', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'worthy', 'higher', 'rating', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'today', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'watched', 'movie', 'unique', 'time', '2003', 'war', 'Iraq', 'began', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'raised', 'same', 'issues']",Three Kings

The plot is deceptively simple: steal the gold that Sadam Hussein stole from Kuwait during the invasion of that country. The trhee soldiers in the title{well,4 actually,Spike Jonez does not get full king billing, I guess,though he almost steals the movie}The scenes of the americans hiding in a humvee to steal the gold and being met with starving woman and children,then gunned down by iraqi soldiers is powerful as is the comment from the soldiers:Bush told them to rise up against Saddam and we'd support the,they did,we didn't."" Interestingly for a main stream Hollywood movie, that war and Bush are bashed mercilessly for their betrayal of the Iraqi's and Kurds who risked their lives, then were left to be slaughtered by Husseins troops. The 4 leads are uniformly excellent. Clooney is wonderful as Archie Gates,the Special forces major,Ice Cube is excellent as the chief{also he portrays a pacticing muslim in the movie,and it is done respectfully, another rarity for Hollywood}, Mark Wahlebrg is barlow,almost the conscience of the group and Jonze is conrad, the redneck{well, it is Hollywood after all} Searing in its indictment of the failure of American policy yet still funny enough to keep you watching, this is a very,very good movie.

521119,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B00003CX73,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[0, 1]","David O. Russel's 'Three Kings' is a hard film to lock down into a particular genre. It combines elements of a war movie, a comedy and a drama, and manages to do it very well. People wanting to see lots of big guns and bombs should stay well clear, there are video games to keep you amused. Anyone who appreciates witty, clever and slightly off beat films is well advised to see it.Telling the untold story of the Gulf War, with Saddam's army more worried about shooting rebel Iraqis then allied soldiers, was a brave move in Hollywood, because many people don't want to know that a democratic uprising in Iraq was being crushed while the Allies sat by in the desert. Rather than being an action movie, the film develops into an exploration of three soldiers and the human development caused by their experience of the war, and the extraordinary circumstances they place themselves in.Many innovative and experimental cinematic styles are used nicely, and solid performances are recorded by Clooney, Wahlberg, Jonze and Cube. The characters are portrayed as normal human beings, both noble and flawed at the same time, and even the Iraqi soldiers are seen as people rather than typical war movie bad guy cannon fodder. This film genuinely showed me the desperation felt by many Iraqis for the Allies to help them as they starved and fought desperately against Saddam.One of my favorite films, and probably one of the most underrated films of its time",4,"Clever, funny and different",1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,1450,"['David', 'O.', 'Russel', ""'Three"", 'Kings', 'hard', 'film', 'lock', 'down', 'particular', 'genre', 'elements', 'war', 'movie', 'comedy', 'drama', 'manages', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'People', 'wanting', 'see', 'lots', 'big', 'guns', 'bombs', 'should', 'stay', 'well', 'clear', 'are', 'video', 'games', 'keep', 'amused', 'Anyone', 'who', 'witty', 'clever', 'slightly', 'beat', 'films', 'well', 'advised', 'see', 'it.Telling', 'untold', 'story', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Saddam', 'army', 'more', 'worried', 'shooting', 'rebel', 'Iraqis', 'then', 'allied', 'soldiers', 'was', 'brave', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'democratic', 'uprising', 'Iraq', 'was', 'being', 'crushed', 'Allies', 'sat', 'desert', 'Rather', 'being', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'exploration', 'three', 'soldiers', 'human', 'development', 'caused', 'experience', 'war', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'place', 'in.Many', 'innovative', 'experimental', 'cinematic', 'styles', 'are', 'used', 'nicely', 'solid', 'performances', 'are', 'recorded', 'Clooney', 'Wahlberg', 'Jonze', 'Cube', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'noble', 'flawed', 'same', 'time', 'even', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'are', 'seen', 'people', 'rather', 'typical', 'war', 'movie', 'bad', 'guy', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'film', 'genuinely', 'showed', 'desperation', 'felt', 'many', 'Iraqis', 'Allies', 'help', 'starved', 'fought', 'desperately', 'Saddam.One', 'favorite', 'films', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', 'time']",Three Kings

Russell's darkly humorous and offbeat heist movie, does to Operation Desert Storm what Kelly's Heroes did to World War II.Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze, this 1999 film tells the story of four GIs who, at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991, cross the Kuwaiti border into Iraq in search of a stash of gold stolen from Kuwait City by the retreating Iraqi Army.  On their way to Karbala, where the gold is stored in a hidden bunker, the motley group of Americans stumbles upon the Shi'ite revolt against Saddam...and what began as a treasure hunt becomes a rather sobering experience as the GIs watch Saddam's forces crush the short lived revolt.Russell's film mixes dark humor, witty dialog, and social commentary with some extreme photographic tricks, making Three Kings one of the weirdest -- yet effective -- films to come out of Hollywood in recent years.

A cynical captain (played by George Clooney), two noncoms (Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg) and a nincompoop (Spike Jonze) are sent into the border zone to clean up.Instead, they stumble across an enormous cache of gold bullion, all nicely laid out in heavy ingot bars.  The gold is SUPPOSED to go straight back to Kuwait from where it was stolen, but . . .No spoilers here, just to say this is a very entertaining and informative movie that touches on the wretchedness of war, the paranoia of not knowing who your political friends are, the weirdness of modern life (mini-spoiler -- at one point the Mark Wahlberg character, unable to radio his base, cell phones his wife to arrange for military reinforcements), and no small amount of welcome humor. Nora Dunn is particularly good in a tragi-comic role as a cable-news reporter unable to see beyond the lens of her next report.This movie is significantly less preachy than SYRIANA or MICHAEL CLAYTON but it does make its points very well.  Unless you are totally turned off by the idea of George Clooney in a war movie, I think you'll like THREE KINGS.I should point out that this film premiered in 1999 and the DVD dates from 2000.  Thus, it may LOOK as though the tail end of the Persian Gulf War as portrayed in this movie was meant to be a commentary on the current Iraqi commitment, but the film came out and was in DVD before the U.S. entered Iraq this time.Also, as of now (6/2008), the regular DVD can be had for a very good price.",4,"""We three kings be stealin' the gold.""",1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,1533,"['1991', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'war', 'end', 'cynical', 'captain', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'two', 'noncoms', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'nincompoop', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'are', 'sent', 'border', 'zone', 'clean', 'up.Instead', 'stumble', 'enormous', 'cache', 'gold', 'bullion', 'nicely', 'laid', 'out', 'heavy', 'ingot', 'bars', 'gold', 'SUPPOSED', 'go', 'straight', 'back', 'Kuwait', 'where', 'was', 'stolen', '.No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'just', 'say', 'very', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'movie', 'wretchedness', 'war', 'paranoia', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'political', 'friends', 'are', 'weirdness', 'modern', 'life', 'mini-spoiler', 'one', 'point', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'unable', 'radio', 'base', 'cell', 'phones', 'wife', 'arrange', 'military', 'reinforcements', 'small', 'amount', 'welcome', 'humor', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'particularly', 'good', 'tragi-comic', 'role', 'cable-news', 'reporter', 'unable', 'see', 'lens', 'next', 'report.This', 'movie', 'significantly', 'less', 'preachy', 'SYRIANA', 'MICHAEL', 'CLAYTON', 'make', 'points', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'totally', 'turned', 'off', 'idea', 'George', 'Clooney', 'war', 'movie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'THREE', 'KINGS.I', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'premiered', '1999', 'DVD', 'dates', '2000', 'Thus', 'may', 'LOOK', 'tail', 'end', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'War', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'commentary', 'current', 'Iraqi', 'commitment', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'entered', 'Iraq', 'time.Also', 'now', '6/2008', 'regular', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'price']",Three Kings

I was pretty young during Desert Storm, and it was too new to be taught in school, so a lot of aspects were new to me with this. I can not attest to any of these plot facts being true, but I am sure that some aspects of it are based on real scenarios and settings that soldiers would have faced. The precedence of stealing the Kuwaiti bullion and it being a fact, is also unknown to me. What I do know for sure, is this is a great, great film. The roles that each of these gentlemen play, is done remarkably well. I am a big time George Clooney fan, and this was an ultimate must purchase for me. Seeing him in such a commanding role and taking charge is certainly nice. The plot of the movie leaves you on the edge of you seat, heart-warmed, saddened, questioning, and blown away, all at once.

The casting was a gem, with Clooney and Wahlberg reinforcing their roles as good leading men, and Ice Cube and Spike Jonze were great in their supporting roles. The Gulf War as we all know was about money, and this movie does an excellent job of portraying that idea, but it was almost too subtle. There was some great imagary and the film aimed at showing the not-so glorious side to war, trying to bring some perspective to a viewing country that is more interested in cable vs. satelite than foreign affairs. The only reason that the movie didn't get a five star rating from me is it's hokie ending. Too happy for a movie that looked to expose some of the realities of war fought not for honor or downtroden people but for economic reasons.

Director David O. Russell has left us with a film that is nothing  short of brilliant, echoing the confusion and frustration that was  Operation Dessert Storm.Perhaps the biggest surprise of Three Kings was  the superb acting by every member of the cast.  Mark Wahlberg and George  Clooney contained a strange believable chemistry and proved they could  break free of past acting stereotypes.  As I look at Ice Cube's character I  was able to forget his life as a rap star and saw him as a US Army soldier.  And of course who can forget Spike Jonze who proved that he could act as  well as direct high quality movies (Being John Malkovich).Many  traditional war movies tend to make Non-American characters very static,  fitting neatly into stereotypes.  Three Kings is very careful not to fall  into this horrible pitfall.  Within the Arab community we see a people  suffering from a horrible dictator with the courage to stand up and fight.  Many aspects of Three Kings show us how our world is shrinking, and though  we may live in separate countries or on opposing sides, the essentials that  we hold dear stay the same.I hope to see more work by David O. Russell  in the future.

The upshot?  Our half-baked execution left thousands at the hands of Saddam's brutal retribution.Now, as we prepare for Gulf War II, David O. Russell's insight strikes at the heart of what everyone needs to be asking:  what happens *after* Saddam?  Is the commitment to follow through there?  What are the odds of establishing a democratic state after 20+ years of brutal Baathist suppression?

521139,ATXO4UA7N1HDC,B00003CX73,Ari Weiss,"[0, 0]","Three Kings: rated R, 1 hour and 50 minutesThree Kings is an excellent, uniquely modern, and stylish war movie. Though it starts off slowly, it picks up pace and clearly makes its point. What makes it stand out as a war movie is its ability to entertain the viewer as an upbeat film rather than being utterly depressing. That's not to say that Three Kings doesn't have its moments of shocking realism. However, comical lines scattered throughout the movie, along with trendy actors who display a natural talent for contemporary filmmaking keep the movie in its place. In the end, Three Kings is exceptionally satisfying.Four young military men set off on their own personal expedition at the conclusion of the Gulf War to retrieve a bundle of stolen Kuwaiti  riches amassed by Saddam Hussein. The plan was shrewdly devised to appear straightforward and feasible, until the men put it into action. Things then seem to become increasingly complicated. The four run into a slew of obstacles that threaten to hinder their chances of success. Major Archie Gates, played by George Clooney, decrees the ultimate ambition for a human being to be necessity. Later, he admits that necessity often changes its form. In this case, the necessities of the four soldiers evolve from their intention to avoid returning  to their day jobs, into their desire to save as many human lives as possible. The operation begins as a greedy mission to acquire individual wealth, but metamorphoses into a test of valor and heroism. The men's integrity is challenged. They must inevitably contend with what is the right thing to do.The quest develops into one of virtue and greater reward than the success of a single man. It underscores the power of individual to make a difference in the world. Sacrifices are made and lives are lost, but for the most part, righteousness prevails. That is the main message of the movie. Humans have the capacity to do good as well as evil.The final scene of the movie is particularly engrossing. Without giving too much away, the surviving military men arrive at the completion of their undertaking, only to find that everything they have worked for, and everything they have forfeited for their noble cause has amounted to absolutely nothing. Wounded, and helpless prisoners to those that seek to punish them, in addition to being responsible for the lives of many innocent Iraqi refugees, all hope seems to be lost. It would require an even greater sacrifice to free them from the current predicament. Once again, their decency is questioned. This is perhaps the gloomiest, most miserable scene in the movie.George Clooney is suitable in the role as the leader of the group and the initiator of the mission. Spike Jonze is pleasant as the ignorant, unschooled member of the team. Ice Cube is all around excellent, exhibiting a strong sense of maturity in acting that was questionable prior to this movie. Somewhat surprisingly, the finest actor of all in this film was former singer, Mark Wahlberg.

This ranks up with movies like Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line as a really intelligent &quot;war like it really is&quot;  story.It starts off fairly simply. At the end of Desert Storm a group of  soldiers find a map showing where stolen Kuwaiti gold was being kept so  they go get it. What was extraordinary was the way that the Iraqi soldiers  actually helped them but would not let them help any of the locals. Orders  from Saddam they said.However, seeing the injustice being meted out by  the Iraqi soldiers our four heroes (Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube and Jonze)  decide to intervene. Things do not go well as Wahlberg is captured and  tortured and all their vehicles are destroyed.The torture scene is  poignant. Wahlberg and his torturer have much in common: they are fathers,  they joined the army to give their families a better standard of living,  except that the torturer's one year old son was killed in a US bombing raid  and his wife lost her legs. When later on Wahlberg is rescued and he has a  chance to kill his torturer, his decision adds all the more depth to the  story.Although Saddam is villified in this movie, the story seems to  take no sides. This is not about heroes and glory but about the struggle  that everyone has with their own oppression - whether it is a tyrant, a  poor job or dumb bosses. There are some very touching moments and some  great humour. All the actors are very convincing (including all the Iraqi  extras) and portay the ambiguity of people caught up in something out of  their control.This is a very good movie and will keep you thinking.

George Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Whalberg play the three kings,  a group of American soldiers who find a map giving the location of stolen  Kuwaiti gold in a prisoners rectum. As the gulf war is nearing an end they  commandeer a humvee and make their way across the desert in search of the  loot.The movies first half an hour takes a very comic, up-beat tone.  When the soldiers arrive at a small village everything appears to be going  well until they are exposed to the slaughtering of innocent civilians. Mark  Whalberg is captured and at this point the film turns into a rescue film.Three Kings eventually turns into the type of movie where the soldiers  can no longer pillfer the gold but must simply do what is right. In a way  this seems like a sort of compromise from what the film was trying to say  at the beginning but it all works out right in the end. What's the most  interesting is how director David O. Russell comments on modern day media  and consumerism. Three Kings is quite distinctive in the sense that it has  far more things to say than a standard movie.Visually speaking Three  Kings is also a treat to watch. One in particular example stands out, a  controversial shot of a bullet slowly entering a human body. What makes  this shot so unique is the fact that it is filmed from the perspective of  being inside a human body. There has also been a great emphasis on the  colors in this film. The desert a wonderful visual backdrop that Russell  takes full advantage of.The films conclusion is ultimately the one major  flaw here. It is quite sad when you see such a unique film take on a very  straight forward and predictable ending.For the most part though Three  Kings is intelligent, thought provoking and a very funny film.",4,Inventive filmaking,953510400,"03 20, 2000",2000,2057,"['American', 'Beauty', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Three', 'Kings', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'major', 'studios', 'have', 'made', 'pretty', 'inventive', 'films', '1999.What', 'sets', 'Three', 'Kings', 'apart', 'other', 'more', 'conventional', 'war', 'movies', 'way', 'huge', 'array', 'ideas', 'one', 'cohesive', 'structure', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Mark', 'Whalberg', 'play', 'three', 'kings', 'group', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'find', 'map', 'giving', 'location', 'stolen', 'Kuwaiti', 'gold', 'prisoners', 'rectum', 'gulf', 'war', 'nearing', 'end', 'commandeer', 'humvee', 'make', 'way', 'desert', 'search', 'loot.The', 'movies', 'first', 'hour', 'very', 'comic', 'up-beat', 'tone', 'When', 'soldiers', 'arrive', 'small', 'village', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'are', 'exposed', 'slaughtering', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'Mark', 'Whalberg', 'captured', 'point', 'film', 'rescue', 'film.Three', 'Kings', 'eventually', 'type', 'movie', 'where', 'soldiers', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'pillfer', 'gold', 'must', 'simply', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'way', 'sort', 'compromise', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'beginning', 'out', 'right', 'end', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'how', 'director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'comments', 'modern', 'day', 'media', 'consumerism', 'Three', 'Kings', 'quite', 'distinctive', 'sense', 'far', 'more', 'things', 'say', 'standard', 'movie.Visually', 'speaking', 'Three', 'Kings', 'also', 'treat', 'watch', 'One', 'particular', 'example', 'out', 'controversial', 'shot', 'bullet', 'slowly', 'entering', 'human', 'body', 'What', 'shot', 'so', 'unique', 'fact', 'filmed', 'perspective', 'being', 'human', 'body', 'also', 'been', 'great', 'emphasis', 'colors', 'film', 'desert', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'backdrop', 'Russell', 'full', 'advantage', 'of.The', 'films', 'conclusion', 'ultimately', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'here', 'quite', 'sad', 'when', 'see', 'such', 'unique', 'film', 'take', 'very', 'straight', 'forward', 'predictable', 'ending.For', 'most', 'part', 'Three', 'Kings', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'very', 'funny', 'film']",Three Kings

521152,AK2AQIULQDFS5,B00003CX73,Bradley Tobin,"[2, 3]","""Three Kings"" is the kind of film that Hollywood doesn't make Enough of. It is Smart, Tough, Well-Written and Realistic, while also being Big, Bold, Cinematic and Entertaining. It's the Perfect Combination of the Hollywood Blockbuster and the Anti-Hollywood Independent film.George Clooney stars as Archie Gates, Mark Wahlberg is Troy Barlow and Ice Cube is Chief Elgin. Together they are the Three Kings (Spike Jonze is to them like D'Artagnan is to the Three Musketeers). What Starts as a Treasure Hunt in the Iraqi Deserts Ends in the Escorting of Dozens of Refugees to the Border, away from Saddam's Tyranny. What looks like a Simple Plan (Get the Gold... and Get Out) and a Simple Film (a Generic Action/Comedy) grows into So Much More as it progresses. It has a few Things to say about Our Government, Their Government, Ourselves, Individuals and what One Person Can do to help. The film Makes all these Statements, without Ever losing sight of the fact that it's Mainly here to Entertain it's Audience... Which it does, with Flying Colours.It is Also a Rapid Anti-war film. For the Americans it is all a Big waste of time, and for Everyone Else, it is Life or Death. Whenever the Americans try to help anyone, Red Tape and Bureaucratic Nonsense stands in their way. The Three Kings in question are out there, supposedly doing wrong, but they are the only ones Really Helping the Supposed Cause. It is all so Futile. The film also says all this, while disguising itself as a straight Action film (probably to get the script through all the Pitch Meetings with a Decent Budget and Studio Support... Good Move). The Reason for the 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that the film is Not one that warrants Repeat Viewing. It reaches Maximum Impact Straight away, unlike some other anti-war films (particularly Stanley Kubrick and Oliver Stone films). Since purchasing this DVD I have watched if Far Less than I Expected to. Perhaps that's just me. David O Russell's Directing is as Fresh and Original in a time where Nothing is Fresh and Original. The Pacing is great, the Performances are All Stand Outs and the Photography is Outstanding. Some of the Images will be Burned in your Memory for an Eternity.If you like Action Movies, you'll love ""Three Kings"". If you like Anti-war films, you'll love ""Three Kings"". If you like your films to have a Point and a Message, you'll love ""Three Kings"". If you think George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are Hotties, you'll love ""Three Kings"".

It is an honest and humorous examination of the Gulf War and of the treachery of American policy toward the Iraqi rebels that  America promissed to support. Like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; this  film contains gritty battle field realism, but of a totally different sort.  &quot;Three Kings&quot; displays the kind of battle field ambiguity that  can result in soldiers being killed unnecessarily. It also demonstrates in  a unique and grisly fashion what a bullet wound does to internal organs.  Most importantly, &quot;Three Kings&quot; reminds us that the Iraqis are  people too. The rebels who resist Sadam Hussein only want to open  businesses and lead a peaceful life. The Iraqi soldier who tortures an  American is himself a victim of the Americans since his wife was maimed and  his child killed by American bombs. This does not justify his brutality,  but it puts the audience in the awkward position of understanding its  origins.This film deals with complex and difficult themes without  preaching.

Though they don't appear on-screen, Saddam and George (H.W.) Bush haunt this movie, permeating the landscape just as much as the blue, Ecktochrome haze that the camera peers through for most of the movie.Politics aside, though, ""Three Kings"" functions best as a good old wartime heist flick (ala ""Kelly's Heroes"").  As Operation Desert Storm packs up its tents, a band of military misfits (George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg and director Spike Jonze) get wind of a stash of stolen gold and go after it.  Chaos ensues but Russell makes a conscious effort not to let the action devolve into guts 'n glory.  There's a dramatic weight to practically every bullet fired in this yarn.The movie loses a little momentum during the final act but that's intentional (note the sudden change of film stock), a conscious effort to play against dramatics.This is also a movie filled with crackling scenes: Cube storming a bunker and getting distracted by footage of the then-brand-new Rodney King beating; a gruelling interrogation (complete with haunting dream sequence cut-aways); and a great sequence in which Wahlberg's captured soldier finds a cell phone and calls his wife in Detroit for help.In addition to the film, there's also an engrossing extra feature on the DVD that shows David O.

Yes, it has some funny moments, but the humor ranges from pretty light to very dark with bitter commentary on most aspects of Desert Storm.  It is a sardonic and sarcastic film.  However, there are also moments of deep emotion (the mother's death with her daughter running to her seeing the mother's blood pouring into the sand) and others of horror and revulsion.In part it is a heist film, it is also an action film, it is also a war film and an anti-war film (you will be able to project your own views of the war onto this film and say that is what it is about).  It is a film commenting on the media, how technology has changed the way wars are fought. (One of the fabulous scenes is when Troy Barlow is taken captive and is put in a holding room that is full of stolen Kuwaiti cell phones - many with some battery charge and still active contracts - so, in a moment of clear thinking he calls his wife at home to have her call his National Guard base with his location.  This while a battle rages outside and his captors break into the room to take him to heaven knows what.)It is also a film about refugees and Sadaam's brutal regime (which is quite interesting given the state of our politics now that we have fought a war in Iraq and removed the brutal dictator as the film seems to advocate we should have done ... ) and how the first Bush's call to remove Sadaam put so many people into miserable situations because we did not back them as the President's words implied we would.Beware, there is profanity nearly every third word, and some pretty rough violence, and one brief scene involving sexual activity.

This year a new generation of filmakers broke mainstream, those raised on MTV and such icons as Stone and the Beastie  Boys. In comedy, Spike Jonze dazzled with the brilliant Being John  Malkovitch, in Europe Tom Twyker's Run Lola Run broke the rules of time and  film concept. In drama, however, it was David O Russel's Three Kings that  led the pack. Ignored at the Oscars, this film is one of the best of the  year. It is everything a movie should be: entertaining, thoughtful, and  original. One of Russel's strongest characteristics is his visual style, a  style that is the so clearly defined you can barley believe it is that of a  young filmaker. The film also boasts strong performances from Clooney,  Whalberg, Cube, and the previously mentioned Spike Jonze, whose portrayal  of a redneck soldier is one of the film's strongest elements. As for story  and script, the film is equally strong. In conclusion, Three Kings is not  only a great film on its own, but a great represention of what may be the  new breed.

It's not because it's the most realistic or has the most impressive battle sequences (it has neither) but because it has an excellent plot and doesn't bother getting itself mixed up with that other stuff.  Clooney and Wahlberg team up for the first of consecutive movies together, the other being the summer blockbuster The Perfect Storm, and are both equally as good.  Clooney's a major two weeks from retirement and wants to leave the Gulf with something more than just sand.  He hunts down a trio who've retrieved a map that they believe leads to a bunker filled with Kuwaiti gold.  Along the way they manage to get entangled in the resistance movement and find themselves befriending they're precieved enemies.  It defys all the sterotypes we have of the Arab people, here they're potrayed as real people trying to live and work but find themselves constantly roadblocked by Sadam's iron fist.  After the skirmish Clooney and co. find themselves on the lam and looking for Wahlberg, whose fallen into enemy hands.  In one of the most unforgetable scenes Wahlberg's questioned while being tortured about his country's misplaced values and comes to empathize with his captors.  It's an excellent moment and movie, one that's totally unconvential, funny, dramatic and action-packed.

I first saw him in &quot;Out of Sight&quot; which I enjoyed, and later in &quot;One Fine Day&quot; with Michele Pfeiffer. I bought both of these DVD's and have  watched them several times. I also made the mistake of buying &quot;Dusk  til Dawn&quot; --a Quentin Tarantino film I hated as it was filled with  gratuitous violence. (I like and own copies of other Tarantino films-  &quot;True Romance&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Reservoire  Dogs&quot;).Clooney plays offbeat leading men quite well, but there's no  romance in this film.  He also seems to have a &quot;bad boy&quot; side  (reminds me of Steve McQueen), and given his last few films, I think he is  poised for a career living on the edge of the law.In &quot;Three  Kings,&quot; he's serving in Uncle Sam's army during the Gulf War. He and  his two sidekicks become separated from their unit--on purpose.  They've  discovered a map on an enemy soldier that purportedly leads the way a stash  of gold and other valuables Sadam looted from his own people.  The  &quot;treasure&quot; is hidden in a village of hapless Iraqi civilians  caught up in the Gulf War conflict.The story doesn't go exaxtly as  planned by Clooney and company (mad dash to the loot, snatch it, take it  home).

Although there are many funny and ironic parts in Three Kings, overall the backdrop of post-war Iraq/Kuwait is not pretty. George Clooney, Ice Cube, and Mark Wahlberg make a great team, with a bumbling, backwards Spike Jonze in tow. A few military guys find a map (interesting where they find it) which illustrates where Saddam Hussein is keeping Kuwaiti stolen property (gold, for example). The men are not quite sure what to do with it, but before they can decide George Clooney (who by far outranks all of them) has heard about the map and wants to make a plan to get the gold for themselves. Things all move along smoothly until they reach the village where a large amount of gold is stored. They steal the gold and are about the leave when the brutality of the Iraqi soldiers is so great that Clooney cannot leave without trying to take the people with him. This sets of a chain of unfortunate events, including some injuries to personnel, Wahlberg&#65533;s being taken prisoner by the Iraqis, and even death. The film takes a serious look at the aftermath of the war with Iraq on the daily lives of the people. The people were encouraged to rise up against their oppressor but were given absolutely no support once they did. And they paid for that. The film also portrays Iraqis and other Middle Eastern people as regular, intelligent people who have families, run businesses, and have the same sorts of concerns as people everywhere else in the world. Unfortunately people who were made to pay for the fanaticism of their leader. (Which rings true now with someone of the anti-Arab backlash from the September 11th terrorist attacks in the U.S. Now every Arab-American or follower of Islam is condemned for the attacks perpetrated by a small minority).",4,INTELLIGENT,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,1882,"['Three', 'Kings', 'was', 'stunningly', 'good', 'film', 'Also', 'quite', 'departure', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'comedy', 'Flirting', 'Disaster', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'ironic', 'parts', 'Three', 'Kings', 'overall', 'backdrop', 'post-war', 'Iraq/Kuwait', 'not', 'pretty', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'bumbling', 'backwards', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'tow', 'few', 'military', 'guys', 'find', 'map', 'interesting', 'where', 'find', 'where', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'keeping', 'Kuwaiti', 'stolen', 'property', 'gold', 'example', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'can', 'decide', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'far', 'outranks', 'heard', 'map', 'make', 'plan', 'get', 'gold', 'Things', 'move', 'smoothly', 'reach', 'village', 'where', 'large', 'amount', 'gold', 'stored', 'steal', 'gold', 'are', 'leave', 'when', 'brutality', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'so', 'great', 'Clooney', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'trying', 'take', 'people', 'sets', 'chain', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'including', 'injuries', 'personnel', 'Wahlberg', '65533', 's', 'being', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Iraqis', 'even', 'death', 'film', 'serious', 'look', 'aftermath', 'war', 'Iraq', 'daily', 'lives', 'people', 'people', 'were', 'encouraged', 'rise', 'up', 'oppressor', 'were', 'given', 'absolutely', 'support', 'once', 'did', 'paid', 'film', 'also', 'Iraqis', 'other', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'people', 'regular', 'intelligent', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'families', 'run', 'businesses', 'have', 'same', 'sorts', 'concerns', 'people', 'everywhere', 'else', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'made', 'pay', 'fanaticism', 'leader', 'Which', 'true', 'now', 'someone', 'anti-Arab', 'backlash', 'September', '11th', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'U.S.', 'Now', 'Arab-American', 'follower', 'Islam', 'condemned', 'attacks', 'perpetrated', 'small', 'minority']",Three Kings

It's really best described as an often humorous and sometimes scathing  political satire.  So you see: political satire marketed as a war/action  movie = box office failure.This is too bad because the movie really does  have a lot to offer those who are interested in modern day social  commentary of the no-holds-barred variety.  The best analogy I can make is  to another scathing political satire (the best of our time), &quot;The  Manchurian Candidate&quot;.

521193,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CX73,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 1]","'Three Kings' was an entertaining but improbable action flick.  It seems to be a war movie, but it is really a story about a gold heist.  The characters just happen to be soldiers in Iraq in the aftermath of operation  Desert Storm.  Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) learns of a map found by  Sergeant Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and upon  investigating, deduces it is a map of bunkers where Kuwait's gold is  hidden.  Together they set out to find it and steal it for themselves.  This is a mild purloining of a similar plot from 'Kelly's Hero's', just  changing the war (A bunch of soldiers learn about a German bank with gold  bullion during WWII and decide to go into enemy territory on an  unauthorized mission to steal it for themselves).  'Three Kings' attempts  to take itself a lot more seriously than 'Kelly's Heroes' did, though there  are numerous light moments throughout the film.The story required a lot  of contrivance to make it even remotely believable, but as action films go,  it wasn't totally outrageous.  The comedy worked well and there were a lot  of interesting insights into American perceptions of the war versus the  Iraqi perspective.  There were a number of reminders of the human toll that  war takes on both sides and that the enemy is comprised of real people with  feelings much like our own.The direction by David O. Russell was good,  but he tried to get a bit to artsy with what was really a straight action  flick.  His opening explanation of the colors and exposures came across as  insecure; almost apologetic.  To his credit, the action scenes were well  done, except we really didn't need to track the path of each bullet in  super slow motion during that one firefight.  I think we also could have  done without the organ cam peek inside Barlow's guts.The acting was well  done all around.  George Clooney gives another fine performance as the  smart, hard nosed action hero.  His deadpan style works well in this type  of film. Despite his no nonsense demeanor, he is effective in subtly  letting it be known that beneath the tough self centered exterior, there is  compassion and a sense of what is right.Mark Wahlberg also delivers a  strong portrayal of a regular Joe reservist, trying to be the tough  soldier.

Thomas ""Gman777""","[0, 7]","I would give the story line a four star rating, but I have a difference of opinion with the director's choice of color production in certain scenes in this movie. He claims he wants to set a mood with the off color and tint in some scenes. I've always felt that the dialogue and the accompanying music should set the scene, and not the color tint, particularly when the tint casts unsightly hues on a character's face. It's one thing to shoot a scene where there is, let's say, a sole blue bulb in the room, but it's totally another thing to change the natural lighting of a scene in order to create a certain mood - it doesn't happen that way in real life.  I'm not saying you can never use it, but it is akin to using ""and"" & ""but"" to start a sentence - it can be done, but should be done very sparingly. In fact, this director can take a page from the movies that feature predominantly black stars. They consistantly shoot in full spectrum light which gives the scenes a very natural look, and make it a pleasure to watch. These movies are great to revisit for the sheer beauty on how they were shot. Whether the scene is shot indoors or outdoors, whether the scene is shot in the daytime or at night, the end results are good. They rarely cut off peoples heads due to photographical choices. Come on guys, that intimate close up shot can only go but so far - a close up on someone's smile, or of someone's eyes is very undesirable when viewed on a 90' x 40' movie theater screen, and still looks just as bad on home theater systems in the 50"" to 200"" range. The makers of Three Kings should get some pointers on how to make a film look good and natural by contacting Miramax. In their film Shakespeare In Love, they turn out a film that had so many of the aspects of photography correct. Whether the scene was brightly or dimly lighted, the colors were well saturated, had good shadow detail, had great texture detail, great contrast and framed well. I have revisited this movie many times just for the sheer joy of watching good photography on film. On the other hand, I'm not going to revisit the Three Kings until I make a personal dub of it, and record all questionable scenes in black and white with my DVD burner, or maybe I'll just watch it in black and white.",3,Getting the color and framing right,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,2271,"['would', 'give', 'story', 'line', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'have', 'difference', 'opinion', 'director', 'choice', 'color', 'production', 'certain', 'scenes', 'movie', 'set', 'mood', 'off', 'color', 'tint', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'dialogue', 'accompanying', 'music', 'should', 'set', 'scene', 'not', 'color', 'tint', 'particularly', 'when', 'tint', 'unsightly', 'hues', 'character', 'face', 'one', 'thing', 'shoot', 'scene', 'where', 'let', 'say', 'sole', 'blue', 'bulb', 'room', 'totally', 'thing', 'change', 'natural', 'lighting', 'scene', 'order', 'create', 'certain', 'mood', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'real', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'can', 'never', 'use', 'akin', 'using', 'start', 'sentence', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'very', 'sparingly', 'fact', 'director', 'can', 'take', 'page', 'movies', 'feature', 'predominantly', 'black', 'stars', 'consistantly', 'shoot', 'full', 'spectrum', 'light', 'scenes', 'very', 'natural', 'look', 'make', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'revisit', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'how', 'were', 'shot', 'scene', 'shot', 'indoors', 'outdoors', 'scene', 'shot', 'daytime', 'night', 'end', 'results', 'are', 'good', 'rarely', 'cut', 'off', 'peoples', 'heads', 'due', 'photographical', 'choices', 'Come', 'guys', 'intimate', 'close', 'up', 'shot', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'close', 'up', 'someone', 'smile', 'someone', 'eyes', 'very', 'undesirable', 'when', 'viewed', '90', 'x', '40', 'movie', 'theater', 'screen', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'home', 'theater', 'systems', '50', '200', 'range', 'makers', 'Three', 'Kings', 'should', 'get', 'pointers', 'how', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'good', 'natural', 'contacting', 'Miramax', 'film', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'turn', 'out', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'photography', 'correct', 'scene', 'was', 'brightly', 'dimly', 'lighted', 'colors', 'were', 'well', 'saturated', 'had', 'good', 'shadow', 'detail', 'had', 'great', 'texture', 'detail', 'great', 'contrast', 'framed', 'well', 'have', 'revisited', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'sheer', 'joy', 'watching', 'good', 'photography', 'film', 'other', 'hand', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'revisit', 'Three', 'Kings', 'make', 'personal', 'dub', 'record', 'questionable', 'scenes', 'black', 'white', 'DVD', 'burner', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'watch', 'black', 'white']",Three Kings

Wanting to better their positions in life and wanting to see some of the ""action"" that they missed out on, the soldiers set out to retrieve the bullion for themselves, but in the process come to see the true horrors of war.""Three Kings"" is David O. Russell's third feature, and in my opinion, far and away his best film to date. Don't get me wrong, I really like Russell's film, in particular his first film, ""Spanking the Monkey"", which I think is brilliant, but after making two dysfunctional family films (the other one being ""Flirting with Disaster""), to then switch to the completely different genre of war movies, AND in the process, to make one of the best war movies of all time, is nothing short of incredible. ""Three Kings"" is a war comedy with something to say. At times it becomes a bit preachy. In particular, in the scene where Wahlberg is captured and is talking about the war with his interrogator, I felt as though Russell was giving me a lecture on why war is bad. Nevertheless, the fact that Russell can manage to take his message and place it in the middle of a thoroughly quotable, darkly comic action movie that is extremely entertaining, never ceases to impress me. Like most people, when I see a movie, my aim is to be entertained, but if the film also makes me think, then that's a bonus and this film really makes you think.I recently heard somewhere that, while this movie was being filmed, George Clooney got into a fight with David O. Russell and ended up punching him. If that's true, then I'm even more impressed with Clooney than I previously was, because he is professional enough to turn in a great acting performance in spite of these feelings. All of the leads in this film are great, from Clooney as the self-serving special forces officer, to Nora Dunn as the aging journalist who spends the film chasing the story of her career.Overall, I highly recommend this film, and if you've already seen it and love it, then I recommend that you try ""Jarhead"" and ""Buffalo Soldiers"".

Iraqi people seem desperate as they watch their last hopes for real freedom from their evil leader vanish away while U.S soldiers are presented simply uninformed of who they are dealing  with and why they are there. The director feels he must ask this question : Why wasn't Sadam killed or at least overthrown ? Wasn't this the perfect opportunity not only to protect the Kuwait people but to finally liberate Iraq from it's vicious leader once and for all ? Also he reminds us one more time that it is never the soldier's choice to conduct a war , it's their goverment's choice . The soldiers are all ordinary people with feelings and sensitivities . Clooney's and Wahlberg's actions at the end of the film clearly display that . This is a movie which takes a lot of guts and mature thinking to be done.

The film has got a sandy look which isn't pleasant.  The lighting is too harsh for my liking.  Why David Russel opted to film Three Kings like this, I don't know.  But what I do know is that behind the annoying techinical problems lies a serious and important issue.I love Dr Strangelove.  That movie is an all out laugh a second movie on the absurdity of war.  Three Kings cannot be compared to it simply because it never attempts to compare.  Three Kings doesn't make fun of the war as such.  There is a lot of humour here but it comes more from the characters than the situation.  In fact, there is nothing at all funny about the situation.  The war is over.  The Iraqis want the Americans out of their country.  But they are still holding innocent prisoners.The performances are top class.  George Clooney chooses his parts well and here, again proves his calibre.  Mark Wahlberg is given the most intense scenes and doesn't disappoint.  Ice Cube defies his ridiculous name to make good a difficult, unflashy part.  Spike Jonze is used for comic effect and is also successful.Russel direction is outstanding.  The Iraqis are not bad guys in his mind.  His views are very objective and fair.  His use of startling images like the unforgettable bullet-eye view are possibly unnecessary but this man knows how to tell a story.Three Kings is not always interesting.  In fact, the movie does sag at times.  And is also often too conventional.  I didn't enjoy the reporter sub-plot.

Here's what I had been missing out on:A no holds barred look at the effects of war from all points of view, not just the American's.  I saw the enemies portrayed as real people, not just mindless barbarians; which is rare to see in movies these days.  It turns out the Americans wanted to steal the gold because they needed it, not just because they wanted it.  It tried to add the all-important comic relief, which was successful most of the times, but there were a few goofy scenes.  The comedy is needed in a movie this hard core. I was blown away by the cinematography and the editing, all the action sequences from the fast paced to the slow motion were blended in perfectly.

And the  message never seems forced, but very organic.So we have the Gulf War,  which was hardly a real war.  And was a war about oil, plain and simple.  And we have four soldiers that wouldn't mind getting their grubby mits on a  few million worth of gold.  (Can you blame them?)  So that's exactly what  they try to do when the opportunity presents itself.David O. Russell has  created a small masterpiece in Three Kings.  The visual style is  fascinating, the pacing shoots forward, and the acting is dead on.  And  it's FUNNY.  And there's a MESSAGE.  And just rent or buy this movie,  because it should be seen.As for the DVD, it is a top notch Warner  release.  It features a couple extra scenes that are not just throwaway  scenes.  It has some great commentary, trailers, interesting featurettes,  and more.  Russell's video diary is quite intriguing (as well as  funny--check out that sedated Mark Wahlberg and uncomfortable George  Clooney).

Additionally as a veteran of the first Gulf War I found very little in this movie to remind me of those first confusing weeks immediately after the cease fire.In THREE KINGS we find a group of Desert Storm GIs, led by George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube, setting off on an unauthorized search for a cache of Iraqi gold.  So far, so good.  During their quest they encounter both passive Iraqi troops, easily pushed aside, and pockets of fanatical Republican Guard soldiers complete with armor.  After hustling off the gold the plot gets unnecessarily confusing with this band of raiders finding themselves in the middle of a civil war between Iraqi civilians and the ruthless guard.From this point onward the plot tumbles downhill with a member of the group captured and tortured, later rescued, only to become immediately wounded during a firefight.  Clooney and his men push their way east with an ever growing entourage of Iraqi refugees only to find themselves arrested by a contingent of US forces blocking their convoy from Iran.  Fortunately the presence of the press compels the Army to allow the Iraqis to pass into Iran and the renegade soldiers are treated as heroes.Some have rated this film as the greatest war film of all time.  I disagree.  It is certainly not a modern KELLY'S HEROES and, though sometimes bizarre, does not have the class to be in league with CATCH 22.

So many, in fact, I couldn't help but laugh at the scene transitions. The oddest thing about this movie was that half of the acting was pretty good, but the other half was absolute horrible. Take a wild guess at what part of the country the two dumbest soldiers are from? Their Southern accents might give that away. Yet another &quot;bash the only non-pc group left&quot;. The overwhelming theme of the movie seemed to be `Killing, war, electrocution, breaking rules, losing your career, and violating peace-time treaties are all justified by the anticipation of lots of GOLD.' Huh??That aside, Clooney was pretty good and Ice Cube was an excellent match for his role. Mark Wahlberg is the most underrated actor today, mostly because the roles he ends up with (other than &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;) are so astonishingly stupid, you question whether he actually has an agent. His character in this has about as much brain power as my left foot, yet try to present him as being one of the more intelligent?....The worst thing about the movie was the relationship between the American and Iraqi soldiers. They acted like they were opposing sides in the middle of a televised football game and they didn't want to appear too &quot;mean&quot; in front of the camera. Rarely did you get the feeling that these two groups were just on opposing sides in a deadly war.I cringe when I see movies like this that are so lacking in character, plot, and scenery that they have to fill every empty scene with ANYTHING politically correct. They touch it all here too: racism towards blacks and Arabs, sexism, equal opportunities for women, gun control, violence, freedom of speech, ethnic cleansing, the &quot;War is bad&quot; theme stolen from &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, etc. They even throw in the Rodney King video for good measure.

Actually, I had to be prodded into it by a friend.The story  was far more complex than I thought it would be, and the cinematography and  direction were first rate. The best performance belongs (surprisingly) to  Marky Mark, late of the Funky Bunch. Thank God he decided to stop singing  and start acting (or was his singing an act all along?). Anyway, he was  riveting. Clooney kept the mugs to a minimum, which helped a great deal as  to the watchabillity of his character. Nora Dunn of SNL fame was a nice  surprise in her turn as a Christiane Armonpor (sp?) type reporter.This  was a dark comedy, with morally ambiguous characters. Sadly, it is all too  easy to believe these young Americans falling in with the plot to pocket  stolen gold. On the other hand, there is redemption in this film. Tough  choices are offered, and the characters do not disappoint. This despite  their modern day cynicysm.The film is not overly graphic, save two or  three scenes. We see in effects of a bullet on the inside of the body, and  the remains of the famous attack on the Basra road. But you should not let  these few brief moments keep you from seeing some amazing  filmmaking.Funny, thought-provoking scripting, visual impact, and strong  performances lift this film above the hype, above the &quot;Mr. Star&quot;  misgivings I had, and it delivers its message with little or no sap.

Consider:-The whole premise that a group of soldiers could just run off without being missed almost immediately is ridiculous.  A unit deployed in the field is constantly doing accountability checks for personnel and for valuable equipment.-One of the characters gets brutally tortured in the film by the Iraqi officer in question.  He gets electro-shock and forced to drink motor oil.  Yet he's no worse for wear by the end of the movie.-Clooney's character (a field grade officer) strolls around the camp at the beginning of the film with a three day growth of beard on his face.  Speaking as someone who ""fondly"" remembers having to shave with camouflage paint on his face while out in the field, I found that laughable.-The idea that Clooney's character could do what he did in the movie (which directly resulted in the unnecessary death of one of the junior soldiers he (mis)led into their ""adventure"" and not get punished for it.But what made the movie offensive to me is that it simultaneously slammed the US for going into Iraq (depicting a US bomb killing an Iraqi officer's baby) and it also slammed the US for not doing enough (blaming the massacres of Iraqi Shi'a and Kurds on the US).  I suppose that the filmmakers' implied argument was that the US shouldn't have done anything at all in face of Saddam's flagrant act of aggression against Kuwait but I suppose if we had done nothing, they would have made a film about the suffering of the Kuwaiti people and how the US was cowardly doing nothing about that.  Or if we had decided to just maintain a blockade on the country, the US would have gotten slammed for the impact on the Iraqi population (conveniently avoiding blaming Saddam and company for that).Bottom line:  if you like watching movies that make laughable errors in terms of realism and are made by people who are consistent only in their opposition to the United States, ""Three Kings"" is a great film.  If not, skip it and just watch ""Kelly's Heroes"" which this film rips off and is far better (and which doesn't sermonize an intellectually dishonest message to you).Kelly's HeroesI know that compared to the blood and treasure expended on the 2003-2011 Iraq War, the 1991 Gulf War pales in comparison and doesn't merit a whole lot of attention, but the people who fought and in some cases died in it deserve a lot better than ""Three Kings.""",2,As a Gulf War Veteran I found this movie stupid and offensive,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,2595,"['thought', 'was', 'stupid', 'took', 'concept', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'such', 'absurd', 'levels', 'only', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'military', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'even', 'remotely', 'plausible', 'Consider', '-The', 'whole', 'premise', 'group', 'soldiers', 'could', 'just', 'run', 'off', 'being', 'missed', 'almost', 'immediately', 'ridiculous', 'unit', 'deployed', 'field', 'constantly', 'doing', 'accountability', 'checks', 'personnel', 'valuable', 'equipment.-One', 'characters', 'brutally', 'tortured', 'film', 'Iraqi', 'officer', 'question', 'electro-shock', 'forced', 'drink', 'motor', 'oil', 'worse', 'wear', 'end', 'movie.-Clooney', 'character', 'field', 'grade', 'officer', 'camp', 'beginning', 'film', 'three', 'day', 'growth', 'beard', 'face', 'Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'fondly', 'remembers', 'having', 'shave', 'camouflage', 'paint', 'face', 'out', 'field', 'found', 'laughable.-The', 'idea', 'Clooney', 'character', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'movie', 'directly', 'resulted', 'unnecessary', 'death', 'one', 'junior', 'soldiers', 'mis', 'led', 'adventure', 'not', 'get', 'punished', 'it.But', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'offensive', 'simultaneously', 'slammed', 'US', 'going', 'Iraq', 'depicting', 'US', 'bomb', 'killing', 'Iraqi', 'officer', 'baby', 'also', 'slammed', 'US', 'not', 'doing', 'enough', 'blaming', 'massacres', 'Iraqi', 'Shi', 'Kurds', 'US', 'suppose', 'filmmakers', 'implied', 'argument', 'was', 'US', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'face', 'Saddam', 'flagrant', 'act', 'aggression', 'Kuwait', 'suppose', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'suffering', 'Kuwaiti', 'people', 'how', 'US', 'was', 'cowardly', 'doing', 'nothing', 'had', 'decided', 'just', 'maintain', 'blockade', 'country', 'US', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'slammed', 'impact', 'Iraqi', 'population', 'conveniently', 'avoiding', 'blaming', 'Saddam', 'company', '.Bottom', 'line', 'like', 'watching', 'movies', 'make', 'laughable', 'errors', 'terms', 'realism', 'are', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'consistent', 'only', 'opposition', 'United', 'States', 'Three', 'Kings', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'skip', 'just', 'watch', 'Kelly', 'Heroes', 'film', 'far', 'better', ""n't"", 'sermonize', 'intellectually', 'dishonest', 'message', '.Kelly', 'HeroesI', 'know', 'compared', 'blood', 'treasure', 'expended', '2003-2011', 'Iraq', 'War', '1991', 'Gulf', 'War', 'pales', 'comparison', ""n't"", 'merit', 'whole', 'lot', 'attention', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'cases', 'died', 'deserve', 'lot', 'better', 'Three', 'Kings']",Three Kings

The old idea that Academy members have short memories doesn't always work for me. The Matrix, which was released five months prior to Three Kings, got four nominations and four awards. It's true that these were in the less exciting technical areas. Still, I still am upset that Three Kings got zilch. Oh, the humanity!The Gulf War has just ended. Are we victorious? Yes and no. Kuwait is saved. That country will soon be back in the multibillion dollar oil business, and the sheiks and their cronies will get most of their gold and other goodies back. As a military and an economic force, Iraq will be paralyzed for at least a decade. The bad news, as we all know, is that we didn't get the bad guy. Saddam will continue to rule for at least a decade.What we at home, as well as most of the guys and gals in the Armed Forces there, didn't know yet was that our call for the Iraqi people to rise up in rebellion against Saddam was answered in many parts of his county. And then we left. Just packed up and went home. Left the rebels to fend for themselves against a government that was very, very angry. I guess NATO generals decided that chaos was a natural byproduct of war.This is the setting for Three Kings. It could have been a grim movie, but it is not overtly political any more than M.A.S.H was. It doesn't point fingers, and it makes no speeches. It's stance is that the soldiers were just as stunned and confused by the speed and abrupt end to the conflict as the people watching at home were. This was the first modern high-tech war. Conducted primarily through air assaults, it left the majority of the ground troops will little to do. So, this isn't like a Vietnam War flick in which troops are given unbelievable orders from seemingly insane commanders in an unwinnable situation. The Gulf War wasn't about Armageddon. It was about Alice in Wonderland.Major Archie Gates [George Clooney] has been so disgusted by the way the war has been conducted that he's decided to resign. It's back to civilian life in two weeks time. He is most interested when he hears of a map taken from a prisoner. [I can't tell you from where on the prisoner said map was obtained.] The map gives the location of a bunker which contains $23,000,000 in gold bars stolen from Kuwait. Now that could make a nice retirement nest egg, Archie thinks. Soon, he is sets off with a select group on a most unusual heist. One of his comrades is Troy Barlow [Mark Wahlberg]. His wife just had there first baby back in America, and all he cares about is getting home in one piece. There is Chief Elgin [Ice Cube], an Army reservist from Detroit, who is basically on a four month vacation from his job as an airport baggage handler. Finally, we have Conrad Vigs [Spike Jonze, in an absolutely brilliant performance], a bright but virtually uneducated kid from the sticks. At first they are pursed by no one except vigilant CNN-type reporter, Adriana Cruz [Nora Dunn]. All she's after is a good story.Remember that much of Iraq's army was still intact. They still guarded Saddam's stuff, like gold bars and luxuary cars hidden undergrounda. Archie and his co-conspritors don't face a risk-free mission. When they get to the bunker, they discover its in a town whose residents are some of the rebels mentiond earlier. The group decides that it's not their problem. Then something awful happens, and the situation turns ugly - and interesting. Do you get the gold or help the people? Do you do both? Neither? Aside from the problems attached to steeling gold, what do you do if helping these people is in direct violation of NATO orders?I love George Clooney. He's right up there with Bruce Willis in the Most Underrated Actors Hall of Fame. Despite their having come from rock and roll, both Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube are well know in the movie business as guys who take their acting very seriously. Nora Dunn, veteran of five years with Saturday Night Live, is a delight. I've already commented on Spike Jonze, but I must mention he did this while in preproduction on Being John Malkovich, which he directed. Writer/director David O. Russell brings the very best of his independent film background with him. He has all sorts of tricks he uses effectively with film, sound and camera angles. You've never seen a shootout like the one he creates here, for example. His use of color and of unusual film stock is extraordinary. Everyone involved has madeThree Kings a royal masterpiece.",5,One of my Top Ten of 1999,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,4552,"['reviewer', 'Three', 'Kings', 'was', 'single', 'most', 'neglected', 'movie', 'year', 'Oscar', 'race', 'old', 'idea', 'Academy', 'members', 'have', 'short', 'memories', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'Matrix', 'was', 'released', 'five', 'months', 'prior', 'Three', 'Kings', 'got', 'four', 'nominations', 'four', 'awards', 'true', 'were', 'less', 'exciting', 'technical', 'areas', 'Still', 'still', 'am', 'upset', 'Three', 'Kings', 'got', 'zilch', 'Oh', 'humanity', 'Gulf', 'War', 'just', 'ended', 'Are', 'victorious', 'Yes', 'Kuwait', 'saved', 'country', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'back', 'multibillion', 'dollar', 'oil', 'business', 'sheiks', 'cronies', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'gold', 'other', 'goodies', 'back', 'military', 'economic', 'force', 'Iraq', 'will', 'be', 'paralyzed', 'least', 'decade', 'bad', 'news', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bad', 'guy', 'Saddam', 'will', 'continue', 'rule', 'least', 'decade.What', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'guys', 'gals', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'was', 'call', 'Iraqi', 'people', 'rise', 'up', 'rebellion', 'Saddam', 'was', 'answered', 'many', 'parts', 'county', 'then', 'left', 'Just', 'packed', 'up', 'went', 'home', 'Left', 'rebels', 'fend', 'government', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'angry', 'guess', 'NATO', 'generals', 'decided', 'chaos', 'was', 'natural', 'byproduct', 'war.This', 'setting', 'Three', 'Kings', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'grim', 'movie', 'not', 'overtly', 'political', 'more', 'M.A.S.H', 'was', ""n't"", 'point', 'fingers', 'speeches', 'stance', 'soldiers', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'stunned', 'confused', 'speed', 'abrupt', 'end', 'conflict', 'people', 'watching', 'home', 'were', 'was', 'first', 'modern', 'high-tech', 'war', 'Conducted', 'primarily', 'air', 'assaults', 'left', 'majority', 'ground', 'troops', 'will', 'little', 'do', 'So', ""n't"", 'Vietnam', 'War', 'flick', 'are', 'given', 'unbelievable', 'orders', 'seemingly', 'insane', 'commanders', 'unwinnable', 'situation', 'Gulf', 'War', 'was', ""n't"", 'Armageddon', 'was', 'Alice', 'Wonderland.Major', 'Archie', 'Gates', '[', 'George', 'Clooney', ']', 'been', 'so', 'disgusted', 'way', 'war', 'been', 'conducted', 'decided', 'resign', 'back', 'civilian', 'life', 'two', 'weeks', 'time', 'most', 'interested', 'when', 'map', 'taken', 'prisoner', '[', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'prisoner', 'said', 'map', 'was', 'obtained', ']', 'map', 'location', 'bunker', '23,000,000', 'gold', 'bars', 'stolen', 'Kuwait', 'Now', 'could', 'make', 'nice', 'retirement', 'nest', 'egg', 'Archie', 'Soon', 'sets', 'off', 'select', 'group', 'most', 'unusual', 'heist', 'One', 'comrades', 'Troy', 'Barlow', '[', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', ']', 'wife', 'just', 'had', 'first', 'baby', 'back', 'America', 'getting', 'home', 'one', 'piece', 'Chief', 'Elgin', '[', 'Ice', 'Cube', ']', 'Army', 'reservist', 'Detroit', 'who', 'basically', 'four', 'month', 'vacation', 'job', 'airport', 'baggage', 'handler', 'Finally', 'have', 'Conrad', 'Vigs', '[', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'performance', ']', 'bright', 'virtually', 'uneducated', 'kid', 'sticks', 'first', 'are', 'pursed', 'one', 'vigilant', 'CNN-type', 'reporter', 'Adriana', 'Cruz', '[', 'Nora', 'Dunn', ']', 'good', 'story.Remember', 'much', 'Iraq', 'army', 'was', 'still', 'intact', 'still', 'guarded', 'Saddam', 'stuff', 'gold', 'bars', 'luxuary', 'cars', 'hidden', 'undergrounda', 'Archie', 'co-conspritors', 'do', ""n't"", 'face', 'risk-free', 'mission', 'When', 'get', 'bunker', 'discover', 'town', 'residents', 'are', 'rebels', 'mentiond', 'earlier', 'group', 'not', 'problem', 'Then', 'something', 'awful', 'happens', 'situation', 'ugly', 'interesting', 'Do', 'get', 'gold', 'help', 'people', 'Do', 'do', 'Aside', 'problems', 'attached', 'steeling', 'gold', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'helping', 'people', 'direct', 'violation', 'NATO', 'orders', 'love', 'George', 'Clooney', 'right', 'there', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Most', 'Underrated', 'Actors', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'having', 'come', 'rock', 'roll', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'are', 'well', 'know', 'movie', 'business', 'guys', 'who', 'take', 'acting', 'very', 'seriously', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'veteran', 'five', 'years', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'delight', ""'ve"", 'already', 'commented', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'must', 'mention', 'did', 'while', 'preproduction', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'directed', 'Writer/director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'very', 'best', 'independent', 'film', 'background', 'sorts', 'tricks', 'effectively', 'film', 'sound', 'camera', 'angles', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'shootout', 'one', 'here', 'example', 'use', 'color', 'unusual', 'film', 'stock', 'extraordinary', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'madeThree', 'Kings', 'royal', 'masterpiece']",Three Kings

THREE KINGS is a movie that manages to find humor in a non-humorous setting, but also is able to show us the ridiculous politics of war and how the Gulf War again denigrates the US as a global police force.  Our four heroes start out on a rather selfish mission to steal gold bars from Saddam Hussein, but end up being an escort service to the prisoners of war.  Tightly directed by David O. Russell, THREE KINGS bristles with some frentic action scenes and some poignant character sketches as well.  Spike Jonez is wonderful as the rather mentally challenged member of the team; George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are heroic and effective; and even Ice Cube manages to evoke some emotional empathy.

Unfortunately, the characters and the script don't measure up, leaving the film a visual masterpiece but an emotional mystery.Director David O. Russell's camera veers, sways and swings hypnotically; the landscape is washed out, monochromatic and almost mind-bending (the result of special film stock); we see pictures of human innards being pierced by a bullet as a voice-over describes the dangers of septic infection; a shoot-out is filmed from the point of view of bullets; and on and on.The story unfolds in the aftermath of the Gulf War; burnout Special Forces Major Archie Gates (a one-note George Clooney) figures out from a reporter that the Iraqis have stashed Kuwaiti gold in a nearby village, and that there is a map showing the location of the village.The map, as it turns out, has been retrieved from an Iraqi soldier's...ahem...posterior by two grunts: straight arrow Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and redneck Beavis wannabe Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze); later, Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) joins Barlow and Vig. Gates tracks the three down, and they devise a plan to retrieve the gold (though we have no idea how they plan to smuggle it back to the states).Eventually, the foursome ends up in the Iraqi village where the gold is stashed, but the natives mistakenly think that this is their chance to rise up (as President George Bush had exhorted them to do) to fight Saddam, whose forces occupy the village. Eventually, Gates decides to help the villagers out, and the Americans get caught up in a mini-rebellion.Frankly, no amount of innovative camera work or visuals can hide the fact that the plot to this movie makes absolutely no sense, and the characters (especially Gates, who inexplicably turns from greedy carpetbagger to heroic liberator) do things that make no sense.&quot;Three Kings&quot; has a sly, hip tone that includes numerous allusions to American pop culture (including Eddie Murphy's &quot;My Girl Wants To Party All The Time&quot;) and consumerism that the Iraqis are too backwards to really relate to (in one scene, an Iraqi soldier fleeing a bunker risks his life to smuggle out American bluejeans). But, perhaps honestly, Russell gives us no real reasons to admire the Americans either; for all their talk (and Bush's talk) about helping liberate Iraq, they're in it for the money.And that one-dimensional sort of attitude would seem to be consistent with Russell's aims with this film: he is in it to show us some very cool and hypnotic direction, but fills the film with patently uninteresting people.In the end, &quot;Three Kings&quot; is a mixed bag, but it's worth seeing for the excellent visuals alone.

521253,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00003CX73,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 0]","Like a Graham Greene for the MTV Generation, David O. Russell in Three Kings sends four naive, greedy American soldiers searching for stolen gold at the end of the Persian Gulf War. They create untold havoc as they blunder into cultural and political situations they can't begin to understand, plunging themselves and countless others into layer after layer of mortal dangers. Those who survive learn that hardest of home truths: &quot;No man is an island.&quot; This movie is tragic, horrifying, cynical, touching and roll-in-the-aisles hilarious--sometimes simultaneously.

Their plan, however, falls into complications when they become involved with Iraqui rebels whom Saddam Hussein has targeted for extinction.THREE KINGS was marketed as a rip-roaring action flick, and it certainly delivers the goods in that department, with several well-staged, John Woo-type explosive set pieces and shoot outs.  But the movie is so much more than the sum of its pyrotechnics.  Foremost it is a satire on American pop culture, with several choice barbs lobbed at famous musicians.  (One demented Iraqui's theory as to why Michael Jackson altered his appearance is particularly funny and quite possibly insightful.)  And the director's ironic use of pop tunes (i.e., Chicago's &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;)during moments of high tension is just masterful.  The cast is very good.  Clooney makes a solid, capable lead.  Walhberg discards his tough guy persona to limn a combination of sweetness and steel, and Ice Cube manages to make his trademark smirks and sneers palatable and appropriately funny.  But Spike Jonze, the famed video/film director, stands out in a very sharp, sad, and funny role as a naive young Southern soldier, gung ho to the very end, and Nora Dunn, as an ambitious reporter, is out and out hilarious.",4,The movies' wittiest look at war since M*A*S*H,988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,1399,"['end', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'War', 'three', 'soldiers', 'action', 'only', 'just', 'beginning', 'plot', 'steal', 'Kuwaiti', 'gold', 'Iraqui', 'outpost', 'plan', 'however', 'complications', 'when', 'become', 'involved', 'Iraqui', 'rebels', 'whom', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'targeted', 'extinction.THREE', 'KINGS', 'was', 'marketed', 'rip-roaring', 'action', 'flick', 'certainly', 'goods', 'department', 'several', 'well-staged', 'John', 'Woo-type', 'explosive', 'set', 'pieces', 'shoot', 'outs', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'sum', 'pyrotechnics', 'Foremost', 'satire', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'several', 'choice', 'barbs', 'lobbed', 'famous', 'musicians', 'One', 'demented', 'Iraqui', 'theory', 'why', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'altered', 'appearance', 'particularly', 'funny', 'quite', 'possibly', 'insightful', 'director', 'ironic', 'use', 'pop', 'tunes', 'i.e.', 'Chicago', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Now', 'quot', 'moments', 'high', 'tension', 'just', 'masterful', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'Clooney', 'solid', 'capable', 'lead', 'Walhberg', 'tough', 'guy', 'persona', 'limn', 'combination', 'sweetness', 'steel', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'make', 'trademark', 'smirks', 'sneers', 'palatable', 'appropriately', 'funny', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'famed', 'video/film', 'director', 'out', 'very', 'sharp', 'sad', 'funny', 'role', 'naive', 'young', 'Southern', 'soldier', 'gung', 'ho', 'very', 'end', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'ambitious', 'reporter', 'out', 'out', 'hilarious']",Three Kings

The devise a plan to go find this gold.  Their paln is somewhat confusing.  Should they keep it, should they give it back to Kuwait, or should they give it to the Iraqi rebels?  While on their mission, tensions rise as the Iraqi Republican Guard start harassing the Iraqi rebels at the bunker.  They first get the help of the few Iraqi soldiers that are there to load the gold onto a truck.  However, some hardcore Republican Guardsmen arrive in a T-72 battle tank and thing change.  They then realize that they must help the rebels escape.  While driving out of the village, they are mortared by tear gas rounds and they accidentally hit some land mines.  They are then picked up by rebels that not only get them into shelter, but also picking up the bags of gold.  However one soldier gets captured by the Iraqis and taken to a old fortress.It is during this time that the dialogue starts hitting home to what is happening today as talk is being made of finally deposing Saddam for good.  This part of the movie makes note of how the Iraqi rebels were encouraged to rise up against Saddam, but didn't get any support from President Bush.  (Kinda eirie you know.)  It comes down to that our ""Three Kings"" are there to steal gold while they let the rebels fend for themselves.  Once our Three Kings begin to see the potential threat against the rebels, is when they decide to help them cross the border into Iran.  They also decide that they will share the gold with the rebels.  It is after this sequence when you realize that this President Bush needs to finally depose Saddam.  Especially since the extras were special.  See the 2nd paragraph below.THREE KINGS was filmed with various stocks of film that give the film a surreal look when there's a state of confusion, but then with standard cinema film when things start to calm down.  So when viewing the movie, don't worry about your DVD player because the film looks different throughout the movie.An interesting note about the Iraqi rebels portrayed in the movie are *actually* Iraqi refugees.  In fact when designing the village sets, a set of brothers, who had in reality defaced hundreds of Saddam propaganda posters, were asked to deface the set props with grafitti of the same kind.  They gladly ablidged.As for the sound, I thought this DVD had the best surround sound envelopment I have ever heard.  The actions scenes came alive with bullets flying behind you and explosions with deep bass.  The helicopter strafing scene was especially intense sound-wise.  So I feel the 4 score that Amazon gave is WAY off the mark.  I believe it deserves a 5+.The extras on the DVD are an awesome mix of things.  You get a walk-through of the village and bunker sets by the designer which is extremely interesting.  You get a home-video documentary of the director from script to movie premier which is awesome, including casting screenings with George Clooney, Mark Walberg, and IceCube.  You also get a 20 minute ""Making of"" documentary.  I was extremely impressed with the Extras on this DVD for such a reasonable price.",5,THREE KINGS has a surprisingly renewed relevance post-9/11.,1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,3471,"['THREE', 'KINGS', 'story', 'gold', 'heist', 'March', '1991', 'cease-fire', 'agreement', 'had', 'been', 'signed', 'Saddam', 'Gulf', 'War', 'surprisingly', 'renewed', 'relevance', 'post-9/11', 'world.In', 'Three', 'Kings', 'group', 'five', 'US', 'soldiers', 'photojournalist', 'crew', 'get', 'wind', 'stolen', 'Kuwaiti', 'gold', 'bulion', 'bunker', 'village', 'Kabala', 'map', 'found', 'rectum', 'Iraqi', 'POW', 'devise', 'plan', 'go', 'find', 'gold', 'paln', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'Should', 'keep', 'should', 'give', 'back', 'Kuwait', 'should', 'give', 'Iraqi', 'rebels', 'mission', 'tensions', 'rise', 'Iraqi', 'Republican', 'Guard', 'start', 'harassing', 'Iraqi', 'rebels', 'bunker', 'first', 'get', 'help', 'few', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'are', 'there', 'load', 'gold', 'truck', 'However', 'hardcore', 'Republican', 'Guardsmen', 'arrive', 'T-72', 'battle', 'tank', 'thing', 'change', 'then', 'realize', 'must', 'help', 'rebels', 'escape', 'driving', 'village', 'are', 'mortared', 'tear', 'gas', 'rounds', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'land', 'mines', 'are', 'then', 'picked', 'up', 'rebels', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'shelter', 'also', 'picking', 'up', 'bags', 'gold', 'However', 'one', 'soldier', 'captured', 'Iraqis', 'taken', 'old', 'fortress.It', 'time', 'dialogue', 'hitting', 'home', 'what', 'happening', 'today', 'talk', 'being', 'made', 'finally', 'deposing', 'Saddam', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'note', 'how', 'Iraqi', 'rebels', 'were', 'encouraged', 'rise', 'up', 'Saddam', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'support', 'President', 'Bush', 'Kinda', 'eirie', 'know', 'down', 'Three', 'Kings', 'are', 'there', 'steal', 'gold', 'let', 'rebels', 'fend', 'Once', 'Three', 'Kings', 'begin', 'see', 'potential', 'threat', 'rebels', 'when', 'decide', 'help', 'cross', 'border', 'Iran', 'also', 'decide', 'will', 'share', 'gold', 'rebels', 'sequence', 'when', 'realize', 'President', 'Bush', 'finally', 'depose', 'Saddam', 'Especially', 'extras', 'were', 'special', 'See', '2nd', 'paragraph', 'below.THREE', 'KINGS', 'was', 'filmed', 'various', 'stocks', 'film', 'give', 'film', 'surreal', 'look', 'when', 'state', 'confusion', 'then', 'standard', 'cinema', 'film', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'calm', 'down', 'So', 'when', 'viewing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'DVD', 'player', 'film', 'different', 'movie.An', 'interesting', 'note', 'Iraqi', 'rebels', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', '*actually*', 'Iraqi', 'refugees', 'fact', 'when', 'designing', 'village', 'sets', 'set', 'brothers', 'who', 'had', 'reality', 'defaced', 'hundreds', 'Saddam', 'propaganda', 'posters', 'were', 'asked', 'deface', 'set', 'props', 'grafitti', 'same', 'kind', 'gladly', 'ablidged.As', 'sound', 'thought', 'DVD', 'had', 'best', 'surround', 'sound', 'envelopment', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'actions', 'scenes', 'came', 'alive', 'bullets', 'flying', 'explosions', 'deep', 'bass', 'helicopter', 'strafing', 'scene', 'was', 'especially', 'intense', 'sound-wise', 'feel', '4', 'score', 'Amazon', 'gave', 'WAY', 'mark', 'believe', '5+.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'awesome', 'mix', 'things', 'get', 'walk-through', 'village', 'bunker', 'sets', 'designer', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'get', 'home-video', 'documentary', 'director', 'script', 'movie', 'premier', 'awesome', 'including', 'casting', 'screenings', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Mark', 'Walberg', 'IceCube', 'also', 'get', '20', 'minute', 'Making', 'documentary', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'such', 'reasonable', 'price']",Three Kings

It doesn't use the Arabs as stereotypes, in fact, it paints them almost as equals to the American soldiers. Russell makes a great point, showing that the other side suffers just as much as us. &quot;Three Kings&quot; shows how the world is getting smaller and the word &quot;minority&quot; can't be used as much, which is just as good. Then there's the brilliant cinematography that has an energy of it's own.

I started to watch this movie expecting a lot of fluff and silly 'Die Hard' kind of chases but instead I got an action packed DVD with some surprisingly good acting and even some political criticism that, altough it bristled my republican heart, it was correct and worked into the movie.Briefly, the film is based on a group of US soldiers, in Iraq, shortly after the surrender by that nutbag Saddam Hussein. After capturing an Iraqui soldier with a secret map of the location of Iraqi gold that was stolen from Kuwait the team of soldiers decide to take an exctracurricular foray into the desert to libertae some of those gold buliion bars for their personal 'war trophies'.The band of soldiers find the underground warehouses full of gold in the middle of remote desert villages with no problem, but, what they didn't count on was that these riches were all guarded by well armed Iraqui soldiers. The fabulous  twist here (and an all to true twist) is that htese soldiers really cared more for their own lives and keeping the population under control rather than protect Husseins gold.Our band of thieving soldiers than faced a dilemma in doing the right thing in freeing villagers who were asked by the pres Bush to rise against Hussein with nothing more than a magic carpet in their hands, or, liberate the gold and sneak it back home ......

Some GI's played by Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg, and Spike Jonze find a map on a POW detailing where Saddam Hussein has stashed some gold bullion belonging to  Kuwait.  George Clooney, who plays an officer about to retire, leads the  group in an expedition to find the gold (hint:  they aren't planning to  give it back to Kuwait).They find the gold but then find that the Iraqui  civilians who our government told to &quot;rise up agaisnt Saddam&quot; are  being slaughtered by the Republican Guards.  Therein lies the dilemna faced  by Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube, and Jonze.The cinematography in this motion  picture is excellent, and each of the cast members turns in a splendid  performance.  Every trick in the bag is used to drive home certain plot  points, to include sequential frame advance, slow-mo, and a very  interesting little bit that shows what a bullet does to one's internal  organs.  The writing and dialogue, especially between Ice-T and Jones or  Ice-T and Wahlberg, is very good and sort of Quentin Tarantinoesque in a  charming way.Clearly, this is one of the most energetic and ambitious  works of the last few years in terms of technique.

Like the others this one goes on its own tangent with a private myth and runs with it, I suppose a historically-accurate film would not be interesting enough. The thing the film conveys when you cut through all the 90s-ish hipness is that while we were celebrating, people in Iraq were suffering. To get us to see this, the writer has us go on a Kelly's Heroes type quest for gold. The point here is that America needs to improve its ability after a war at finishing the job and restoring to governmental power legitimate rulers who will not allow civilians to be brutalized. We all know we (our government) were unwilling to oust Saddam Hussein from power and attempt this. At some point we had best get &quot;willing&quot; and able to do this.The next thing to praise the film is how it depicts what happends when a bullet hits the human body, its highly instructive and begs the question why we don't have some sort of area disinfectant that can be sprinkled into a wound like we had sulfa powder in WWII? The awareness of the vulnerability of the HMMWV to land mines is shown in the movie, which is good. Clooney's character the Major seems technically and tactically proficient with the situation he has placed himself in (not enough men, mobility or firepower, certainly no back up).The ending was actually realistic in that the conventional military frowns upon initiative and would seek to punish those that practice it even if staring in their face was what the moral thing was to do.All in all, the movie was better than what I expected and should be viewed more in an artistic, detached manner as a sort of statement using metaphors.Airborne!",5,Captures the mood of Desert Shield/Storm,970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,1718,"['better', 'film', 'Desert', 'Shield/Storm', 'others', 'one', 'own', 'tangent', 'private', 'myth', 'suppose', 'historically-accurate', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interesting', 'enough', 'thing', 'film', 'conveys', 'when', 'cut', '90s-ish', 'hipness', 'were', 'celebrating', 'people', 'Iraq', 'were', 'suffering', 'get', 'see', 'writer', 'go', 'Kelly', 'Heroes', 'type', 'quest', 'gold', 'point', 'here', 'America', 'improve', 'ability', 'war', 'finishing', 'job', 'restoring', 'governmental', 'power', 'legitimate', 'rulers', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'civilians', 'be', 'brutalized', 'know', 'government', 'were', 'unwilling', 'oust', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'power', 'attempt', 'point', 'had', 'best', 'get', 'quot', 'willing', 'quot', 'able', 'do', 'this.The', 'next', 'thing', 'praise', 'film', 'how', 'what', 'when', 'bullet', 'human', 'body', 'highly', 'instructive', 'question', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sort', 'area', 'disinfectant', 'can', 'be', 'sprinkled', 'wound', 'had', 'sulfa', 'powder', 'WWII', 'awareness', 'vulnerability', 'HMMWV', 'land', 'mines', 'shown', 'movie', 'good', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Major', 'technically', 'tactically', 'proficient', 'situation', 'placed', 'not', 'enough', 'men', 'mobility', 'firepower', 'certainly', 'back', 'up', 'ending', 'was', 'actually', 'realistic', 'conventional', 'military', 'frowns', 'initiative', 'would', 'seek', 'punish', 'practice', 'even', 'staring', 'face', 'was', 'what', 'moral', 'thing', 'was', 'do.All', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'what', 'expected', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'artistic', 'detached', 'manner', 'sort', 'statement', 'using', 'metaphors.Airborne']",Three Kings

I really didn't expect this movie to have quite the impact that it does. One of the things I liked the most was how the killing and shooting scenes were  handled by the director. But then again, I liked how the director handled  absolutely everything - including the lighting and uses of imagery. Being  an avid widescreen fan, I like how the 2.35:1 format is used to show off  the setting and images. Brilliant. And it really doesn't come off as a  mindless &quot;Commando&quot; flick where everyone and everything gets  blown up, although it does go into that for a short while. Clooney is real  good here, and quite funny in places; I think on the whole the cast did a  real good job. The only critique I have of it is that it gets a little too  sentimental towards the end, and that probably takes away some momentum.

Most young men don't want to think about all that challenging stuff, so perhaps pitching this as an action-comedy about American boys kicking sandy butt was the only way to get the audience which most needs to see it into the theatres.  The result is a film with just enough action to be enjoyed as a purely visceral war story, but which more politically aware viewers can admire for its bracing and balanced take on modern imperialism and the politics of oil - although everyone may feel let down by an anachronistic Hollywood ending which reeks of studio interference or post-preview jitters.  But the real tragedy is that in the current political environment which Bush has strategically dumbed down into the dishonest polarity of ""Good vs. Evil"", this is precisely the kind of forthright, sophisticated film we should be seeing more of - and precisely the kind of film which now has little chance of ever being made again.

Fentress,"[0, 0]","Well I have to admit I never had had any desire to see this film because of the subject matter and that I had heard it was basically a post-war style film. I also have to admit I finally saw it because I have recently become interested in seeing the other work of actor Mark Wahlberg because I liked him so well in ""Planet of the Apes""(go see it!). I became interested in seeing some of his other work. He is quite impressive in this film. To my surprise I really liked this film. It is smartly done in that it deals with some pretty serious subject matter but manages to add humor as well in some pretty difficult scenes. This film is excellent in so many different ways.One being that these 3 ""kings"" , George Clooney (Archie), Mark Walberg (Troy) and Ice Cube along with Spike Jonze (Conrad- sort've the comic relief who has great admiration for Troy) set out to basically steal some gold (23 million dollars worth) that they learned about through a map found in a captive's (buttocks). But what happens along the way is something else  and you learn that these guys have heart and care about the people they have to end up rescuing that they really don't want to deal with-they just want the gold but they end up having to go through quite a bit to accomplish this feat-things that they certainly didn't plan on. At first it seems everything they touch ...blows up! It is kind of funny almost. I never really understood this war and why it happened in the first place and you do learn more about it and that it had  to do with the crazy Saddam Hussein. These characters you get to learn alot about who they are(and they learn about themselves) along the way as the movie progresses and you have to see quite alot of things that perhaps you would never want to see or know about (a Iranian woman gets shot through the head in front of her daughter and husband which is the last straw for these soldiers and at this point they seem to decide that this isn't right and they are going to help out these people and still get the gold). Sometimes the lighting is really harsh but it is also true form. The scenery isn't the best to watch as it shouldn't be given the setting. There is some really suberb acting as well. I continue to be impressed with George Clooney with each film he does and Mark Wahlberg also is a standout.....This isn't usually the type of movie I like but it was smart, funny, heart-wrenching and I was so glad I finally saw it. I even watched again. You will not be disappointed and you may feel like you have even learned something. It is a solid film with very solid outstanding performances. I even bought it for my collection and at the end there is a 24 minute addition where they interview the stars and the director on th emaking of it...a nice touch at the end. rent it.

521309,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B00003CX73,Traveler,"[18, 23]","David. O. Russell, the director of Three Kings, is arguably the most courageous person in all of Hollywood. He created a film that tells the truth about the Gulf War with gut wrenching imagery, symbolism and, yes, even humor.After three weeks in wide release I finally got around to viewing this picture. I had been hesitant to go because I thought it might be just another gung ho, rah rah war movie that glorified US foreign policy. Was I ever wrong.Three Kings, starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube, tells the story of a small group of soldiers at the end of the Gulf War during the ""cease fire"" who head out on their own, unbeknownst to their superior officers, to find millions of dollars worth of gold that Saddam Hussein stole from Kuwait. At first all goes as planned, they find the gold and are ready to head back to base with the stolen loot. But then the reality in their midst sets in.The cease fire agreed to by US President George Bush has created a horrible situation for the Iraqis who want to oust Saddam from power. US soldiers are no longer ""legally"" allowed to fire upon Iraqi soldiers even though many are being ordered by Saddam Hussein to terrorize and murder any and all resistance groups, including women, children and the elderly. The men are faced with the dilemma: Take the gold with them or do what's morally right and help the people who the US government has abandoned to Saddam's military.Part of this film's astonishing quality is that it combines humor with its biting political commentary. Simply put, David O. Russell knows how to use a soundtrack, frequently in jarring contrast with the action that's taking place on the screen. In one scene the small group of US soldiers careens into Karbala with the Beach Boys song ""I Get Around"" blaring on the tape deck and a Bart Simpson doll as an ornament on the hood, all while Iraqi troops are killing the local civilians who are rebelling against Saddam. In another scene the soldiers are listening to Chicago's soft hit ""If You Leave Me Now"" as they head into battle with Republican Guard troops. I don't think I'll ever be able to hear that song again without thinking of this movie.I don't want to give any more details because you simply must see this movie for yourself. But I must warn viewers: This film does have graphic violence and at least two scenes that depict what a bullet does to a person's internal organs. However, that's reality -- it's war as it really is. I cannot stress that point enough. While the overall plot is fictitious, the background story surrounding Three Kings is all accurate. For example, the area surrounding Karbala, the town depicted in the film where the gold is hidden, is the very place where Saddam's army slaughtered an estimated 10,000+ Iraqis who did as George Bush asked and ""rose up against Saddam."" And the reality is, the US government left those people to hang in the wind to suffer under Saddam's military.Karbala is not the only truthful element of this film. David O. Russell also shows how big media colluded with the US government in only reporting a filtered view of what was taking place. And he also shows how the US government supported Saddam's military prior to the Gulf War when it was at war with Iran. The scene where an Iraqi soldier explains to the US soldier he's torturing that he learned his ""expertise"" from the US military is a damning commentary on US foreign policy.Russell commented in one interview, ""I'm presenting fact. George Bush has said himself that he has regrets about the way the war was ended.""I have not been this emotional about a film since Casualties of War, the true story of how a Vietnamese village girl was abducted, raped and murdered by US soldiers and how one man struggled to bring the perpetrators to justice. When I viewed both of these films I had to fight to keep from weeping. What both these films share is that, while they might have certain cinematic ""flaws,"" both depicted real events that occurred while the US was at war. Remember that when viewing Three Kings.What you see on the screen -- the shooting of an unarmed mother pleading for her husband's life, the slaughter of civilians, the US government censorship of the media -- is pretty much what really happened. While Americans were parading through the streets because we ""won"" the war, the Iraqi people who did stand up to Saddam -- under the encouragement of President George Bush who indicated that the US government would support an uprising -- were all slaughtered. Those same people did indeed wonder, ""Where is the US military? Why aren't they helping us?""If you can stomach the imagery, you should see this film. I urge everyone who is unaware of what has happened to the Iraqi people to see it.Michael Moore, of Roger & Me, TV Nation and Awful Truth fame, stated that Three Kings is ""the best movie of the year."" I'm willing to go a step further. It's also one of the bravest movies ever created and ranks up there All Quiet on the Western Front, Born on the 4th of July, Paths of Glory and other such films which tell us what we already know but refuse to acknowledge.",5,Truth of the Gulf War wrapped in a somewhat comic plot,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,5142,"['David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'director', 'Three', 'Kings', 'arguably', 'most',

521310,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00003CX73,trebe,"[0, 2]","One of the few mainstream films to be set in the Gulf War, Three Kings, is an interesting, entertaining, critically acclaimed, but totally improbable military adventure.  In 1991, during the clean up operations after the end of the war, reservist soldiers Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Vig (Spike Jonze), discover a map ...of a captured Iraqi prisoner.  The two soldiers, along with Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) are reviewing the contents of the map when they are interrupted by Major Archie Gates (George Clooney).  Gates, from Special Forces, shows the group that the prize to be had is actually stolen Kuwaiti gold bullion, hidden in a nearby village.  Soon the group is on their way to claim the treasure from Saddam's Army, anticipating a ""milk run"", expecting to complete their mission in a morning's time.Arriving at the village, the group is greeted enthusiastically by the villagers.  Iraqi soldiers are in control, and have as prisoners Bush inspired rebels, but no gold is to be found.  Believing that they have made a mistake, the Americans leave.  Realizing their mistake, they return to discover the gold in a hidden bunker, claiming it in the name of the USA.  With the help of the occupying Iraqi soldiers, the bullion bars, housed in hand luggage, are loaded into an Iraqi truck.  The group is about to leave the village, when an innocent civilian is brutally murdered.  This incident starts a chain reaction of violence that changes the whole dynamic of their for profit only mission.It is also from this point, that much of the story's credibility falls away, and logic no longer seems to matter.  The Americans, leave the village, taking as many of the Iraqi prisoners as they can.  As they speed away, they are gassed by mortar fire, causing their vehicles to crash, and spilling the gold out on to the desert.  Can perhaps six mortar rounds, really cause a large section of the desert to become so clouded with gas, that visibility is reduced to near zero?  Then fortuitously, members of the rebel forces appear at exactly the right spot, to rescue their friends and the Americans, and recover the gold as well.  They all then disappear into a hidden underground cave located in the middle of the desert.  How lucky can you get?Meanwhile, after launching the gas attack, Saddam's finest head out into the desert and succeed in capturing Sgt. Barlow.  Yet somehow they don't pursue anyone else, and have absolutely no interest in recovering any of the stolen bullion.  Barlow is immediately transported to a holding facility for interrogation.  Information is apparently more valuable than gold.  From this point, Three Kings continues along an improbable path to a questionable conclusion.  The US Army is apparently unable to locate the renegade group, which is operating within driving distance of their base camp.If you ignore the elements which don't make too much sense, and just concentrate on the film's technical and action aspects, there is much that is impressive and entertaining.  George Clooney is always a competent lead actor, and the supporting cast is solid.  Cliff Curtis a Maori from New Zealand, is excellent as the Iraqi rebel leader.  The film covers events that few others have been willing to deal with, and has much to say about the nature of war, and the Gulf War in particular.  However, the logical inconsistencies, and rather weak ending do distract from the film's total impact.  Three Kings is good film well worth seeing, but falls well short of being a great one.

Morris,"[1, 1]","First off let me say that I am a huge Robert Altman fan, so when I say that Three Kings is as good as M*A*S*H, that is not meant to be taken lightly.  It blends action, tragedy, social commentary, and flawless  cinematic techniques like no movie since Bonnie and Clyde.  David O.  Russell had never made a war movie before, but he delivers big time here.  The story has great, believable characters; a good plot; and is  surprisingly angry and political.  The direction is flawless, at times  subtle and at other times boldly self aware, but always unique.

Three Kings is a film that is as believable as Jack and the Beanstalk.  The plot, dialogue, and acting is inept and childish.  Once again, high tech action  sequences are needed to carry the picture but even these fail.  The scene  where a camera cam focuses on a bullit's internal damage path in a human  stomach is as convincing as a sixth grade science project.  Did the  director really think this was impressive?  When a truck explosion is the  highlight of a film, what else is there to say?  Probably the most annoying  and unrealistic portrayal of a newsreporter ever captured on screen is  evidenced here. How can the director, producer, scriptwriter, and actress  allow such a mockery of war correspondence?  I was hoping that a scud  missle would obliterate her.

521316,A1NSHD4YCL5DV3,B00003CX73,"Vish Iyer ""wish_1979""","[2, 2]","At the first instance, what are striking about this movie, is its cinematography, its camera-work, and the computer graphics used, to create certain scenes. Considering these elements, the movie almost certainly `appears' superficially like a Chemical Brothers video. From the beginning to the end, the movie is chaotic. Now, the movie is most certainly a two-hour Chemical Brothers video. As a matter of fact the movie is full of contemporary music-artists: Ice Cube, Marky Mark, and a prominent music-video director, Spike Jonze. Moreover, Spike has infact directed a couple of Chemical Brothers videos. So, there is a definite connection between Chemical Brothers and Three Kings.Actually, the slick and sleek look of the movie makes it very interesting to watch and to be studied. But, there is a lot more to this flick, than merely its skin-deep look. There is much beyond to this flick than its masterfully created outward faade. Three kings is a brilliant satire. Mainly during its first half, the movie shows American soldiers act like Hollywood heroes, frivolously doing things as they please, at the expense of the hapless people, who they actually are supposed to protect. In point of fact, this very first half is funny as well as grossly heartless. One can either laugh one's heart out during the first half, or at the same time one can feel really sick in the gut, for some of the really gruesome scenes, treated humorously and with aberrant detachment. But, herein lies the sarcasm of the flick.The second half of the movie is more hearted and thought-provoking than its first half. If `satire' is the word for the first half, then `irony' is the word for the second half. In the second half, the four protagonists set out to selfishly search for gold, actually end up doing just the opposite of what they intended to do, leading to the very warm-hearted end.This movie is definitely not the quintessential war movie. It stresses on frivolity of the human nature, with war just as a backdrop. A humorous, satirical, thought-provoking movie like Three Kings, shot brilliantly using fresh, new cinematographic techniques is very much a movie worth watching, more than once.",4,A SATIRE WITH INNOVATIVE CINEMATOGRAPHY,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,2186,"['first', 'instance', 'what', 'are', 'striking', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'camera-work', 'computer', 'graphics', 'used', 'create', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Considering', 'elements', 'movie', 'almost', 'certainly', 'superficially', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'video', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'chaotic', 'Now', 'movie', 'most', 'certainly', 'two-hour', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'video', 'matter', 'fact', 'movie', 'full', 'contemporary', 'music-artists', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'prominent', 'music-video', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'Moreover', 'Spike', 'infact', 'directed', 'couple', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'videos', 'So', 'definite', 'connection', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'Three', 'Kings.Actually', 'slick', 'sleek', 'look', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'be', 'studied', 'lot', 'more', 'flick', 'merely', 'skin-deep', 'look', 'much', 'flick', 'masterfully', 'created', 'outward', 'faade', 'Three', 'kings', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'Mainly', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'American', 'soldiers', 'act', 'Hollywood', 'heroes', 'frivolously', 'doing', 'things', 'please', 'expense', 'hapless', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'are', 'supposed', 'protect', 'point', 'fact', 'very', 'first', 'half', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'grossly', 'heartless', 'One', 'can', 'one', 'heart', 'first', 'half', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'really', 'sick', 'gut', 'really', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'treated', 'humorously', 'aberrant', 'detachment', 'herein', 'sarcasm', 'flick.The', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'more', 'hearted', 'thought-provoking', 'first', 'half', 'satire', 'word', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'irony', 'word', 'second', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'four', 'protagonists', 'set', 'out', 'selfishly', 'search', 'gold', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'just', 'opposite', 'what', 'intended', 'do', 'leading', 'very', 'warm-hearted', 'end.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'quintessential', 'war', 'movie', 'frivolity', 'human', 'nature', 'war', 'just', 'backdrop', 'humorous', 'satirical', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'Three', 'Kings', 'shot', 'brilliantly', 'using', 'fresh', 'new', 'cinematographic', 'techniques', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",Three Kings

Not that there isn't humor in Three Kings, at times it's very funny in a black humor kind of way. Where it shines is it's multilayered view of the 1991 Gulf War.The opening shot sums up the film. The war is over, an Iraqi stands on top of a bunker, he waives. The major issue is whether soldiers are still shooting with no one knowing.At once it lets viewers know this war was not like others, nothing is particularly clear - not unlike battles during a war - but typical of the convoluted policies behind the Gulf War.Politics are part of this film, still there are many interesting aspects to it. The acting is excellent and characters well defined. The air of confusion pervades the plot and view of the film's principle characters.There is the cynical veteran and young men who saw no action but think it is glamorous. There are the Iraqi people who's plight becomes more and more a part of the film as the soldiers change from, for lack of a better word, looters to men of concience.All the while there is a mix of adventure, humor and a touch of surrealism. Camera shots are gritty in the mostly outdoor film but are mixed with point of view and point of bullet's view which make for a visually unique film.By film's end the main characters go from likeable rogues to noble heros. There's a lot of great themes within the film and some memorable dialog.The extra material on the DVD delve deeper into the main themes of the film which enhances the experience.
