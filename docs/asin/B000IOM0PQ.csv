1021452,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000IOM0PQ,Julian Kennedy,"[3, 14]","Goodnight, We Love You: 5 out of 10: This collection of Phyllis Diller sex tapes is somewhat disappointing. Often filmed in that awful night vision green it is hard to make out the action. In addition, Miss Diller rarely takes on more than one man at a time (except for the Catalina Island orgy) and her only lesbian scene (with Elaine Boosler) is all to brief.Phyllis of course was a famous sex kitten who had myriad affairs with such luminaries as Troy Donahue and Anwar Sadat. In fact, Sadat's last words 'Phyllis it was always you' is often misquoted... okay okay I kid I kidFans of Phyllis Diller will be pleased... Fans of elderly woman checking into moderate hotel suites will be in heaven. Goodnight, We Love you does beg a few questions. The primarily one is should you allow your stalker to film your biography. To describe director Gregg Barson as fawning is to completely underestimate his obsequious servitude towards Miss Diller. Honestly, it is more than a bit creepy.Not that celebrities interviewed are any less ingratiating. Not one expresses surprise that Diller is still alive and the kind words flow as if they were giving an encomium rather than personal insights. I understand that is human nature to say something nice but after the twentieth or so collection of hosannas, Don Rickles' sneering come across as a breath of fresh air rather than the senile rambling it actually is.In fact, Rickles' own recent documentary 'Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project' would make a nice companion piece for this filmDiller's Guinness Book awarding rapid-fire delivery is well covered here and a reunion of her personal assistants is the highlight of the film. I wish there was more of the personal stories and less generic celebrity praising. There is also not enough actual stand-up in the film itself as a result the companion disk of her last live performance is a welcome addition.A nice enough film for Diller fans but one should check their blood sugar levels before watching.",3,Goodnight We Love You...

1021459,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,B000IOM0PQ,Phillip Oliver,"[36, 36]","In 2002, the 84 year-old legendary comedian Phyllis Diller decided to retire from doing stand-up comedy. But never retire altogether! As her son Perry says in the documentary, ""We never use the R word in mother's house. She will never retire. She'll always be working at something."" Today Diller continues to make appearances in films and on tv and continues to paint, another of her many talents. ""Goodnight, We Love You"" provides the viewer with a glimpse into Diller's private and public life and shows what a consummate professional and caring and giving person she truly is.This wonderful documentary follows Diller as she prepares for her final appearance in Las Vegas. We see her arriving at the hotel, inspecting her rooms, rehearsing, applying her make-up, wig and costume, and her 5-minute ""quiet time"" that she demands before every performance. It is a grueling routine and Diller is a perfectionist and pro when it comes to the set-up of her stage, lighting and sound. We also get a glimpse inside her beautiful Brentwood home which includes rooms for her wigs and costumes. She also shows off one of her many antique automobiles and her red kitchen, where she often prepares gourmet meals. Her home office contains huge filing cabinets where thousands of her jokes (all of which she wrote!) have been filed, cross-referenced and organized.Throughout the documentary, comments are provided by fellow comedians such as Don Rickles, Lily Tomlin, David Brenner, Bonnie Hunt and others as well as people who have worked with Diller through the years like her personal secretaries (who were given the name ""Dustbuters""), agents, etc.Extras on the dvd include her full 43-minute final performance in Las Vegas, a question and answer session with Diller and director Gregg Barson and a ""Dustbiter Reunion,"" where Diller meets up with many of her former secretaries.",5,A glimpse into the world of the legendary comedian,1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,1870,"['2002', '84', 'year-old', 'legendary', 'comedian', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'decided', 'retire', 'doing', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'never', 'retire', 'altogether', 'son', 'Perry', 'documentary', 'never', 'use', 'R', 'word', 'mother', 'house', 'will', 'never', 'retire', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'working', 'something', 'Today', 'Diller', 'make', 'appearances', 'films', 'tv', 'paint', 'many', 'talents', 'Goodnight', 'Love', 'viewer', 'glimpse', 'Diller', 'private', 'public', 'life', 'what', 'consummate', 'professional', 'caring', 'giving', 'person', 'truly', 'is.This', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'Diller', 'final', 'appearance', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'see', 'arriving', 'hotel', 'inspecting', 'rooms', 'rehearsing', 'applying', 'make-up', 'wig', 'costume', '5-minute', 'quiet', 'time', 'performance', 'grueling', 'routine', 'Diller', 'perfectionist', 'pro', 'when', 'set-up', 'stage', 'lighting', 'sound', 'also', 'get', 'glimpse', 'beautiful', 'Brentwood', 'home', 'rooms', 'wigs', 'costumes', 'also', 'one', 'many', 'antique', 'automobiles', 'red', 'kitchen', 'where', 'often', 'gourmet', 'meals', 'Her', 'home', 'office', 'huge', 'filing', 'cabinets', 'where', 'thousands', 'jokes', 'wrote', 'have', 'been', 'filed', 'cross-referenced', 'documentary', 'comments', 'are', 'provided', 'fellow', 'comedians', 'such', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'David', 'Brenner', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'Diller', 'years', 'personal', 'secretaries', 'who', 'were', 'given', 'name', 'Dustbuters', 'agents', 'etc.Extras', 'dvd', 'include', 'full', '43-minute', 'final', 'performance', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'Diller', 'director', 'Gregg', 'Barson', 'Dustbiter', 'Reunion', 'where', 'Diller', 'up', 'many', 'former', 'secretaries']","Goodnight, We Love You - The Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller"
1021460,A35RU0QMQNDS2X,B000IOM0PQ,Ryal McMurry,"[5, 5]","I have been a fan of Madame Diller's for a long time.  I had seen the A&E; Biography, and I've read her book (""Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse"" which is excellent by the way).  So I bought this expecting a nice little DVD.I was quite surprised at the depth.  This film is truly great.  It mixes footage leading up to and including her last stage show before retiring from stand-up.  This was great, but also interspersed was interviews with Phyllis Diller, friends, and associates.  There is also a fairly in-depth tour of her home: her clothes, her painting, her office, the gag file, etc.One of the most delightful things for me was the interviews with the ""Dustbiters.""  They were Madame Diller's traveling secretaries over the years (most apparently only lasted on the gruelling life of touring for a couple of years).  It is a true testament to the person that she is that they all have come together with only warm and loving things to say.  Her son Perry Diller also provides his thoughts as well.The bonus features are great too.  There is footage from a Q&A; with the director and Madame Diller after a showing of the film at some festival that lasts about 10 minutes.  It is entertaining as well as interesting.  Also included is a chat with a ""Dustbiter"" from the 1980's who was not with the other Dustbiters in the film.  The films trailer is also included, but by far the best bonus feature is the complete performance of Madame Diller's farewell show.  A lot of it is seen throughout the film, but it is really great to watch it in its entirety.This is a must-have for any fan of Phyllis Diller, but it is also a great buy for people who love to laugh.
