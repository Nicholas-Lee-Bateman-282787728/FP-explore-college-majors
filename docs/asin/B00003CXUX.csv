538056,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00003CXUX,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","The daughter of Senator Rose is kidnapped by her &quot;teacher&quot;; another teacher is killed. This crazy killer hides young Megan Rose, and calls Dr. Cross, a profiler. (How did this &quot;teacher&quot; pass his background checks?) The problem is to recover Megan Rose unhurt by solving this crime. The Secret Service agent who failed to protect Megan Rose partners with this profiler whose previous partner was killed on the job (an omen?).Dr. Cross discovers a clue hidden away in a digital photograph. (This crime is modeled after the Lindbergh kidnapping.) Megan Rose tries to escape, the man who tries to help her is killed by kidnapper Songee. There is an attempt to meet another student that goes awry, almost trapping Songee! The police seem to be closing in. Songee calls for $10 million in untraceable diamonds, but this call can't be traced. (Have they no Caller ID?) A series of phone calls leads Dr. Cross to the transit system to deliver the ransom. While this pair discuss the case, Songee invades their house to question them! (Believable?) This mistake leads to Songee's death. But Songee never got the ransom! Is there another criminal involved? The brains behind this plot is a killer! Now Megan Rose knows too much, and must be silenced. But Dr. Cross arrives to stop the killer and save Megan Rose.This is an entertaining story with plot twists; but the final ending seems incredible to me.",3,Kidnapping with a Surprise Ending,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,1414,"['daughter', 'Senator', 'Rose', 'kidnapped', 'quot', 'quot', 'teacher', 'killed', 'crazy', 'killer', 'hides', 'young', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'Dr.', 'Cross', 'profiler', 'How', 'did', 'quot', 'quot', 'pass', 'background', 'checks', 'problem', 'recover', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'unhurt', 'solving', 'crime', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'failed', 'protect', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'partners', 'profiler', 'previous', 'partner', 'was', 'killed', 'job', 'omen', '.Dr', 'Cross', 'clue', 'hidden', 'away', 'digital', 'photograph', 'crime', 'modeled', 'Lindbergh', 'kidnapping', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'tries', 'escape', 'man', 'who', 'help', 'killed', 'kidnapper', 'Songee', 'attempt', 'meet', 'student', 'awry', 'almost', 'trapping', 'Songee', 'police', 'seem', 'be', 'closing', 'Songee', '10', 'million', 'untraceable', 'diamonds', 'call', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'traced', 'Have', 'Caller', 'ID', 'series', 'phone', 'calls', 'Dr.', 'Cross', 'transit', 'system', 'deliver', 'ransom', 'pair', 'case', 'Songee', 'house', 'question', 'Believable', 'mistake', 'Songee', 'death', 'Songee', 'never', 'got', 'ransom', 'there', 'criminal', 'involved', 'brains', 'plot', 'killer', 'Now', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'too', 'much', 'must', 'be', 'silenced', 'Dr.', 'Cross', 'stop', 'killer', 'save', 'Megan', 'Rose.This', 'entertaining', 'story', 'plot', 'twists', 'final', 'ending', 'incredible']",N/A

Edward Azad,"[0, 3]","This is a contrived, goofy, badly-made film with no suspense or surprising twists.The story opens with Morgan Freeman witnessing the Death of His Partner.  The manner of this death is more laughable than sad.  A rapist decides to engage in sexual assault while cruising at high speed along a dam.  In a convertible. (what could go wrong?)  And this establishes the logic-defying mayhem which ensues.The villain (or is he?) of the film is a wackjob with a penchant for bad disguises.  ..In point of fact, this movie is similar to The Jackal remake, and not in a postive way.  Morgan Freeman does what he can with the material, which is admirable, but even he seems moronic when he can't spot the Traitor In the Police Force as quickly as the audience can.

""Along came a Spider"" has more twists (exclude the pun) than a spider web.  This, of course, makes most people want to go back and check out each character and see how it all envelops in the end.  It's very confusing, but makes almost perfect sense...well, almost.""Along came a spider"" is the sequel to ""Kiss the Girls""...or maybe it's a prequel?  You don't know.  The one thing you do know is that Dr. Alex Cross, the shady and ruthless detective, is back, reprised by the talented Morgan Freeman.  The beginning of the film is kinda farfetched and silly, when a car flips in the air like a board game dice and holds on by a thread over a dam.  It almost seems like the car has a mind of it's own!  Anyways, Dr. Cross has filed for retirement after his partner was killed in that car, after a sting operation went very bad.  Meanwhile, a international catastrophe goes out of control, when the daughter of a US senator is kidnapped by her teacher and posted as ransom.  The kidnapper, named ""Mr. Soneji"" (played perfectly by Michael Wincott) has unknown objectives to the kidnapping.  Meanwhile, Dr. Cross is thrusted back into action when Soneji calls him at home, wanting to play a game.  Cross is partnered up with a special agent Jezzie (played by Monica Potter) who's is to blame for Megan's (the girl) kidnapping, due to lack of security.  The two go out on the case, searching for Soneji, while the really plot starts to unveal about half-way through the film.ACAS is thrilling and suspenseful.  The only problem is that much of the climax doesn't exactly explain anything.  Most of all, the reason I said it was a ""international"" catastrophe, was because around somewhere in the film, Morgan's friend is the son of the Russian Embassador.  Obviously the Russians are stuck up and act like all of them have a stick up their [end].  In this case, in one scene, Alex and Jezzie stop Soneji from taking Morgan's friend from outside the Russian Embassy.  They almost have Soneji while he's getting away, but then the Russian Embassy guards come out and go postal on the two detectives, as if they were the assisins!

538059,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00003CXUX,Alex Udvary,"[3, 3]","2001 has proven to be the year of the detective\suspense\thriller genre! The year started out with the amazing Sean Penn film starring Jack Nicholson &quot;The Pledge&quot;. It was then followed by Ridley Scott's sequel to &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;. We then had Robert DeNiro and Ed Burns star in &quot;15 Minutes&quot; now along comes &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot;, which might not be as good as &quot;The Pledge&quot; and\or &quot;Hannibal&quot;, but it does prove to be a very entertaining film. It's a movie that's filled with lots of twist and turns and we go along with them, loving it! Back in 1997 we were first introduced to the character created in James Patterson's novel and the film version of &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;. Morgan Freeman under the direction of Lee Tamahori gives a wonderful performance. Freeman is an actor that truly has a presence that dominates on screen, no matter whom he's acting against. And that presence is very clear to see in this movie. The film opens up with a very exciting scene showing Freeman and his partner in action going after some rapist (I think). Right from that very first scene the viewer knows that they're in for a very suspenseful,exciting, and entertaining ride! A senator's daughter has been kidnapped dispite efforts by Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) who seems to work well in her scenes with Freeman. Flannigan (Potter) has been watching Megan (The senator's daughter) for 3 years. And can't believe how they're suspect Soneji (Michael Wincott) could have escaped. After a phone call from Soneji himself, sorta requesting that Detective Alex Cross (Freeman) take on this case, we are set to believe that for the rest of the movie Soneji is our man. But, the screenplay by Marc Moss has something else up it's sleeve. A major twist happens that sets us in a completely new direction. If someone can actually tell me that they saw what was going to happen in the end, then I must be the biggest moron walking around. Because I was shocked! If it wasn't for the plot twist, I don't think I would be recommending this movie. A lot of critics are complainng that the movie has too many plot holes. To them I say...LOSEN UP!!!! I've yet to actually see that is without any doubt absolutely perfect. The movie is entertaining. It keeps our attention, and has an ending no one will see coming. It's enjoyable, and exciting and I think people will like it for what it is, and will have a good time watching it.",3,A &quot;Spider's&quot; web of twist and turns!,987206400,"04 14, 2001",2001,2515,"['2001', 'proven', 'be', 'year', 'detective\\suspense\\thriller', 'genre', 'year', 'started', 'out', 'amazing', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'film', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'was', 'then', 'followed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hannibal', 'quot', 'then', 'had', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'star', 'quot', '15', 'Minutes', 'quot', 'now', 'quot', 'Along', 'Came', 'A', 'Spider', 'quot', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hannibal', 'quot', 'prove', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'movie', 'filled', 'lots', 'twist', 'turns', 'go', 'along', 'loving', 'Back', '1997', 'were', 'first', 'introduced', 'character', 'created', 'James', 'Patterson', 'novel', 'film', 'version', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'quot', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'direction', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Freeman', 'actor', 'truly', 'presence', 'screen', 'matter', 'whom', 'acting', 'presence', 'very', 'clear', 'see', 'movie', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'exciting', 'scene', 'showing', 'Freeman', 'partner', 'action', 'going', 'rapist', 'think', 'Right', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'viewer', ""'re"", 'very', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'senator', 'daughter', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'dispite', 'efforts', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Jezzie', 'Flannigan', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'who', 'work', 'well', 'scenes', 'Freeman', 'Flannigan', 'Potter', 'been', 'watching', 'Megan', 'senator', 'daughter', '3', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', ""'re"", 'suspect', 'Soneji', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'could', 'have', 'escaped', 'phone', 'call', 'Soneji', 'requesting', 'Detective', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Freeman', 'take', 'case', 'are', 'set', 'believe', 'rest', 'movie', 'Soneji', 'man', 'screenplay', 'Marc', 'Moss', 'something', 'else', 'sleeve', 'major', 'twist', 'sets', 'completely', 'new', 'direction', 'someone', 'can', 'actually', 'tell', 'saw', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'biggest', 'moron', 'walking', 'around', 'was', 'shocked', 'was', ""n't"", 'plot', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'recommending', 'movie', 'lot', 'critics', 'are', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'say', 'LOSEN', 'UP', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'actually', 'see', 'doubt', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'attention', 'ending', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'enjoyable', 'exciting', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'what', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching']",N/A

The suspense is there when needed, and the twists come and go with intended impact and yet, when all is said and done I can't seem to really care to see the film again.  I think maybe that has to do with the fact that, while it does everything with fine effect, it doesn't do anything `special'.  `Along Came a Spider' is a decent crime-thriller that sports a fine performance from Morgan Freeman (who could very easily have phoned this in and yet he surprisingly doesn't) and a clever twist here and there, but that is all.  I much preferred the films predecessor, which is actually a sequel to this film (`Kiss the Girls') which, while certainly teetering on the generic in certain respects, contained a savagely sincere performance from Ashley Judd that elevated the film immensely.  `Along Came a Spider' doesn't equal that intensity.

You are in for a treat with this genuine suspenseful tale.  Try to keep up with the detective as he discards false leads and picks up real clues during this thriller.MORGAN FREEMAN is the reason I watched this movie.  Loved it!  Every time there's an ""Alex Cross"" novel-movie available I watch it.  Driving Miss Daisy, Seven, High Crimes, Shawshank Redemption, Glory, Million Dollar Baby, and all those many other movies are excellent, still, Morgan Freeman as the outright leading character are the height of entertainment!Just get all the ""Alex Cross Detective"" movies starring Morgan Freeman available and watch them four or five times.  The movies share titles with novels, but don't let that delay your viewing.An avid reader, I had never heard of James Patterson until I had seen ""Along Came A Spider"" AND ""Kiss The Girls"".  Thus, I had the benefit of not being concerned as to whether the movie script followed the novel to the letter.  Who cares?!  If they differ, it is most likely because, duh, one is a MOVIE while the other is a BOOK.  Reviewers who complain about the differences must not understand that what makes a good chocolate cake doesn't quite make a good chocolate ice cream.  To achieve the same flavor, you've got to change some key ingredients.Morgan Freemam MADE the character Alex Cross worth watching.  When you need an actor to literally CARRY a movie, you've got to get someone with a reputation for doing the heavy lifting.  Freeman has long since done that in ""Driving Miss Daisy"".  Recently, though I don't know why he bothered to do it, unless as a personal favor to his friend Clint Eastwood, Freeman did all the hard work again in ""Million Dollar Baby"".  Come on folks.  I like Eastwood as much as anyone, but there's a REASON he's been directing movies and not acting in them for decades now, and ""MDB"" is a painful example.  Hilary Swank?  Well, if you get ""packaged"" between Eastwood's direction and Freeman's acting, cleary people will mistake you for an actress!  At least partially reminds me of Driving Miss Daisy.When you search ""DVDs"" for ""Morgan Freeman"", it lists 'related searches' as ""Denzel Washington"", ""Mel Gibson"", and ""Tom Hanks"".

Yet this mind-boggling and somewhat implausible thriller brings back Morgan Freeman to reprise his role as the brilliant forensic detective Alex Cross that he played in ""Kiss The Girls"" to such an electrifying effect.Of course, this whole opening sequence just lays the groundwork for the premise of the film, which is that Freeman's character has been sent into a tailspin, feeling personally  responsible for a colleague's death, and this self-enforced ""retirement"" from active casework becomes one of the provocative elements energizing the action in this thriller. thus, when an influential senator's daughter is kidnapped in broad daylight from an exclusive Washington private school, Cross is pressed into service in order to generate more ink and electronic media interest.Of course, some of the gee-whiz aspects of the plot are implausible, like Cross using advanced computer technology to virtually explore the topography of a suspect's room via a photograph, thereby discovering mind-boggling clues from that photograph that strain the credibility of the plot, but not to worry. We are quickly sped on our way toward another aspect of the developing story.Like the previous movie, there are a number of unanticipated plot twists here top keep one's interest, and the action sequences are very well done. The two aspects of rapid-fire action and a number of bizarre plot turn-arounds have one guessing right up to the end just what the blazes is going on. Like the prior film, it is also an interesting travelogue of the area in which it was shot, this time primarily around the nation's capital. After these two outings, one hopes to see Alex Cross (played by Freeman, of course) will return to truly establish this franchise with a while series of such movies.

Instead, I was served up a hackneyed and contrived, yet entertaining movie. After a little girl is kidnapped from an up-scale private school, detective Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is called in (literally) to find her. Also, secret service agent Jezzie (Monica Potter) who was responsible for the child's safety accompanies him. The plot winds mindlessly around trying to find the kidnapper, Gary Sonji, with a couple of twists and turns that don't make a heap of sense, but are moderately plausible. In a movie like this, everything usually ends up coming together in the end. But here, there are a few loopholes that will leave you scratching your head. Also, the musical score doesn't fit with the movie at all. At the parts where you'd expect a slow-building dissonant sound for suspense effect, you get a steady repetitive chord. It just doesn't work. Morgan Freeman and Monica Potter turn in good performances and their chemistry on-screen is positive, which is just enough for me to give the film a positive review.

Enjoy it I Did, but Viewers who aren't such Die Hard Devotees of the Genre mightn't be as Forgiving as I am.In ""Along Came a Spider"", which is actually a Prequel to ""Kiss the Girls"", Freeman again stars as Alex Cross, Famed Novelist and Detective who gets involved in a High-Profile Kidnapping by the Kidnapper Himself. Soneji (Michael Wincott) has read Cross' Books and wants him In on the Chase. The Girl he Kidnapped was a Senators Daughter and the Authorities need all the help they can get. Cross enlists the help of the kidnapped girls Secret Service agent, Jessie Flannigan (Monica Potter), and Together, they set out to Capture Sonjei and get the Girl back Alive.Morgan has played not only This role before (""Kiss the Girls""), but his played this Kind of role Numerous times before (""Seven"" and ""Under Suspicion""), so it's Not much of a Stretch for him, he knows Exactly what to do and When to do it, there aren't many Surprises for him, or the Audience for that matter. Morgan has seen this kind of Role before and We the Audience have seen this kind of Film before. Monica Potter is Serviceable in her role; she does get Better as the film goes along. Michael Wincott is the Real Winner in the Acting Category; I was on His side after his First line of Dialogue. He is one of my Favourite Character Actors and he Stole the Film in my Opinion. Penelope Ann Miller is Totally Wasted in a Grossly Underwritten role. Mika Boorem, who played the Kidnapped girl, is Wonderful. She doesn't Overdo the Hysterics of her Situation, she plays it Smartly and her performance is Always Believable. Dylan Baker gives a Great Supporting performance in a Well Written role.The film does have some High Points that Warrant Recommendation. The ""Cliffhanger"" style Opening is an Eye catcher. The scenes where Wincott and Freeman are together, weather it's on the phone or Onscreen, they bring out the Best in Each Other. Michael Wincott... He is worth Admission Prices or Purchase Prices alone. What I Didn't like was Director Lee Tamahori's lack of Energy in his Directing. He lets the film down by not seeming to Care about what's going on. The Ending is also a Major Let down, it comes out of Nowhere and it's Over way to Quickly. It all looks Very Rushed or Changed due to Test Screenings.Devotee's of the Genre and Fans of the ""Alex Cross series"" should give it a look, anyone else should look elsewhere, as this will Not show you anything you haven't seen before. But, in the end it's a Thriller that serves up a few Thrills, so it's Served its Purpose.

The book has truly translated well onto the screen.Morgan Freeman does an excellent job; he plays the character of Cross much less stiffly than we have seen with other genius detective types.  Most of the time, they're so clinical and absorbed (sometimes self-absorbed) that it's difficult to watch them.  At least Denzel Washington was supposed to be stiff in THE BONE COLLECTOR.The strength of the movie relies heavily on a quick change-up surprise which occurs at about twenty minutes from the end of movie, which is good, because once you figure out that not everyone is quite as they seem (and we all know who's going to win), a resolution shouldn't be drawn out too long.I was impressed by Monica Potter's performance.  Most critics called her a copy of Julia Roberts, which isn't a bad thing necessarily.  There is one scene in which the character Soneji is finally killed, and we see some good acting from her, but not only is she a good actress, her character is a good actress as well.  I won't leak too much information, but when the turning point comes, the movie relies much less on Morgan Freeman as a power-actor and turns the spotlight onto Potter.  Michael Wincott, as Soneji, and Mika Boorem, as Megan Rose, also do fine jobs.The movie's not a classic, but the surprise twist does spin your head a bit, and you will definitely not see it coming, unless you've read the book and you know the Alex Cross formula.

538113,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXUX,D. Litton,"[21, 28]","If you happen to be a fan of &quot;Kiss the Girls,&quot; the 1997 surprise hit thriller, then you may be a bit disappointed in its prequel, &quot;Along Came a Spider,&quot; which pits Dr. Alex Cross against yet another kidnapper who has an agenda to be dealt with. As Dr. Cross, Morgan Freeman makes the film watchable at best, but the ominous presence of loopholes, twisted logic, and the overall way in which the movie toys with the audience, results in slight disappointment.The movie opens with a chase sequence that serves little purpose other than to set up a time of emotional turmoil in Cross's life, after the death of his partner as a result of this pursuit. His personal war against himself is put on hold when he discovers that a young girl, the daughter of a Senator, has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper wants Cross on the case.Teaming up with Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), who was the child's guardian at the private school she attended, the two of them begin sorting through the clues and details involving the kidnapping, trying to get a lock down on the whereabouts of the teacher they believe responsible. To say that the movie makes a mistake by revealing the kidnapper's identity is a misfire, but the fact that we know who he is doesn't enhance the plot, either.The movie is a sea of loopholes, from the solving of clues to the realization that the kidnapper may not be working alone. Consider a scene in which Cross goes through computer video in order to find a clue to the villain's whereabouts. He goes from searching through a classroom to a live computer camera that is based in the kidnapper's apartment, without any logical explanation for this transition other than a mere piece of dialogue from an extra to explain that what he is looking at is no longer recorded video.In another scene, Cross has a conversation with the kidnapper about a ransom exchange that took place in an earlier sequence on a subway train. The amount of the money was a mere ten million dollars, but Cross congratulates him for his retrieval of twelve million. This is one of the movie's more admirable twists, letting us in on the fact that since our villain seems to know nothing of this ransom, then there must be someone else involved.There are plot points that work, and those that don't, and in the end, the movie has toyed with us a little too much. &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; toyed with our expectations, too, but allowed us time to build our own conclusion before throwing it back at us, all the while keeping our interest peaked. &quot;Spider&quot; toys with us in ways that leave little time to draw any sort of conclusion about what is going on, leading up to a particularly effective surprise twist ending that doesn't cheat according to the rules the plot has set up, though is somewhat hindered by the heightened disinterest in the lead-up.It's good to see Morgan Freeman back in such fine form; as Dr. Alex Cross, this is the Freeman we all know and love. His ability to instill calm in the most tense of situations is remarkable, and his solving of the crimes is shown in an intelligent, capable light. I will refrain from commenting on the acting of Monica Potter, so as not to reveal what happens, but I gather that the audience will make their own decision about her acting in the beginning and the end once the ending arrives. Michael Wincott is an ideal villain, and however little of him we get to see, his performance is remarkably chilling.In the end, &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; is worth it for Morgan Freeman's acting, and some key plot points, but the overall effect the movie has is disappointing. The plot twists of the movie feel more like obstacles than advancements, while the central mystery never reaches a fully interesting fever pitch until the end. There are things that work and things that don't in this film; unfortunately, they never reach a healthy medium.",3,This spider's web is too sticky.,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,3935,"['happen', 'be', 'fan', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'quot', '1997', 'surprise', 'hit', 'thriller', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'prequel', 'quot', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'quot', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'yet', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'agenda', 'be', 'dealt', 'Dr.', 'Cross', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'watchable', 'best', 'ominous', 'presence', 'loopholes', 'twisted', 'logic', 'overall', 'way', 'movie', 'audience', 'results', 'slight', 'disappointment.The', 'movie', 'chase', 'sequence', 'little', 'purpose', 'other', 'set', 'up', 'time', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'Cross', 'life', 'death', 'partner', 'result', 'pursuit', 'personal', 'war', 'put', 'hold', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'daughter', 'Senator', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'kidnapper', 'Cross', 'case.Teaming', 'up', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'Jezzie', 'Flannigan', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'who', 'was', 'child', 'guardian', 'private', 'school', 'attended', 'two', 'begin', 'sorting', 'clues', 'details', 'involving', 'kidnapping', 'trying', 'get', 'lock', 'down', 'whereabouts', 'teacher', 'believe', 'responsible', 'say', 'movie', 'mistake', 'revealing', 'kidnapper', 'identity', 'misfire', 'fact', 'know', 'who', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'plot', 'either.The', 'movie', 'sea', 'loopholes', 'solving', 'clues', 'realization', 'kidnapper', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'working', 'alone', 'Consider', 'scene', 'Cross', 'computer', 'video', 'order', 'find', 'clue', 'villain', 'whereabouts', 'searching', 'classroom', 'live', 'computer', 'camera', 'based', 'kidnapper', 'apartment', 'logical', 'explanation', 'transition', 'other', 'mere', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'extra', 'explain', 'what', 'looking', 'longer', 'recorded', 'video.In', 'scene', 'Cross', 'conversation', 'kidnapper', 'ransom', 'exchange', 'took', 'place', 'earlier', 'sequence', 'subway', 'train', 'amount', 'money', 'was', 'mere', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'Cross', 'retrieval', 'twelve', 'million', 'one', 'movie', 'more', 'admirable', 'twists', 'letting', 'fact', 'villain', 'know', 'nothing', 'ransom', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'are', 'plot', 'points', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'movie', 'toyed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'quot', 'toyed', 'expectations', 'too', 'allowed', 'time', 'build', 'own', 'conclusion', 'throwing', 'back', 'while', 'keeping', 'interest', 'peaked', 'quot', 'Spider', 'quot', 'ways', 'leave', 'little', 'time', 'draw', 'sort', 'conclusion', 'what', 'going', 'leading', 'up', 'particularly', 'effective', 'surprise', 'twist', 'ending', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'according', 'rules', 'plot', 'set', 'up', 'though', 'somewhat', 'hindered', 'heightened', 'disinterest', 'lead-up.It', 'good', 'see', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'back', 'such', 'fine', 'form', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Freeman', 'know', 'love', 'ability', 'instill', 'calm', 'most', 'tense', 'situations', 'remarkable', 'solving', 'crimes', 'shown', 'intelligent', 'capable', 'light', 'will', 'refrain', 'commenting', 'acting', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'so', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'gather', 'audience', 'will', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'acting', 'beginning', 'end', 'once', 'ending', 'arrives', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'ideal', 'villain', 'however', 'little', 'get', 'see', 'performance', 'remarkably', 'chilling.In', 'end', 'quot', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'quot', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'acting', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'overall', 'effect', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'plot', 'twists', 'movie', 'feel', 'more', 'obstacles', 'advancements', 'central', 'mystery', 'never', 'fully', 'interesting', 'fever', 'pitch', 'end', 'are', 'things', 'work', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'reach', 'healthy', 'medium']",N/A

Why, oh why, would a producer pay big bucks to a best-selling author for the rights to film his book, only to twist the plot into unintelligibility? James Patterson, author of the eponymous book, is perhaps the most uneven writer working today, but Along Came a Spider (the first book to introduce Detective Alex Cross) was a superb thriller--unquestionably one of his best. Why screenwriter Marc Moss and director Lee Tamahori tried to improve Patterson's story is beyond me. Frankly the plot twists they added simply don't make sense. This is the kind of film you enjoy while you are watching it, then within an hour or less you start questioning why things happened as they did. I'll not spoil the suspense for those interested by enumerating these details, but even the strength of the book's characters get the Hollywood treatment. The brilliant villain Gary Soneji is rather sidelined in the film, while Patterson liked him so much he brought him back in another Alex Cross book.The cast are the saving grace of the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job reprising his role as Alex Cross. Although in Kiss the Girls I thought he was rather too old for Cross (and he's certainly no younger now!) he seemed more convincing to me in Spider--perhaps I'm simply detaching his portrayal from my mental image. Monica Potter, as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan, bears a resemblance to a younger Julia Roberts and sounds uncannily like her. Michael Wincott, as Soneji, was fantastically evil, the highlight of the film. I look forward to seeing much more of him.Some final thoughts: the opening scene has some of the least convincing computer generated images seen onscreen in ages. This certainly isn't a reason to miss the film--the scene is almost entirely incidental to the rest of the movie (and not even in the book at al) and if you come in 5 minutes late you miss nothing--but I have to wonder why more care wasn't taken. And the musical score, by Jerry Goldsmith, one of the Hollywood giants, is not his best work by far. The music of the closing credits worked well, but there was a curious mis-match between music and scene in most of the film. Finally, in the opening credits the vowels drop down into the actor's names on CGI spiderwebs--a single textured filament, like a spider descending on its thread. I have to admit to almost laughing out loud at what was obviously supposed to be dramatic, but when the capital &quot;A&quot; dropped down I couldn't help but think it looked like a zipper...All in all, it's worth waiting for this one on network TV.",2,Arachnophobia,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,2701,"['female', 'spiders', 'eat', 'mates', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'apparently', 'Hollywood', 'inspired', 'such', 'behavior', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'would', 'producer', 'pay', 'big', 'bucks', 'best-selling', 'author', 'rights', 'film', 'book', 'only', 'twist', 'plot', 'unintelligibility', 'James', 'Patterson', 'author', 'eponymous', 'book', 'perhaps', 'most', 'uneven', 'writer', 'working', 'today', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'first', 'book', 'introduce', 'Detective', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'was', 'superb', 'thriller', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'best', 'Why', 'screenwriter', 'Marc', 'Moss', 'director', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'tried', 'improve', 'Patterson', 'story', 'plot', 'added', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'kind', 'film', 'enjoy', 'are', 'watching', 'then', 'hour', 'less', 'start', 'questioning', 'why', 'things', 'happened', 'did', ""'ll"", 'not', 'spoil', 'suspense', 'interested', 'enumerating', 'details', 'even', 'strength', 'book', 'characters', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'brilliant', 'villain', 'Gary', 'Soneji', 'rather', 'sidelined', 'film', 'Patterson', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'brought', 'back', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'cast', 'are', 'saving', 'grace', 'movie', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'fine', 'job', 'reprising', 'role', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'too', 'old', 'Cross', 'certainly', 'no', 'younger', 'now', 'seemed', 'more', 'convincing', 'Spider', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'simply', 'detaching', 'portrayal', 'mental', 'image', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'Jezzie', 'Flannigan', 'resemblance', 'younger', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'uncannily', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'Soneji', 'was', 'fantastically', 'evil', 'highlight', 'film', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'him.Some', 'final', 'thoughts', 'opening', 'scene', 'least', 'convincing', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'ages', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'reason', 'miss', 'film', 'scene', 'almost', 'entirely', 'incidental', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'book', 'al', 'come', '5', 'minutes', 'late', 'miss', 'nothing', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", 'taken', 'musical', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'giants', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'far', 'music', 'closing', 'credits', 'worked', 'well', 'there', 'was', 'curious', 'mis-match', 'music', 'scene', 'most', 'film', 'Finally', 'opening', 'vowels', 'drop', 'down', 'actor', 'names', 'CGI', 'spiderwebs', 'single', 'textured', 'filament', 'spider', 'descending', 'thread', 'have', 'admit', 'almost', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'supposed', 'be', 'dramatic', 'when', 'capital', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'dropped', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'looked', 'zipper', 'worth', 'waiting', 'one', 'network', 'TV']",N/A

This one takes it nearly as far as it can go.Here's the scoop. The young daughter of a U.S. Senator has been kidnapped. Famed detective Alex Cross is reluctantly brought in. The kidnapper has left some clever clues which Alex, and his secret service partner whose negligence led to the kidnapping, need to follow to retrieve the girl. Surprises abound in the investigation.Overall this is pretty good. It's a major studio release with good production values and a fine cast. Directing, editing, music score are all on par with the budget. I guess I had a problem with the fact that our kidnapper ( the always good Michael Wincott) was so darned clever. Someone would need to be a member of MENSA to figure out these clues. Then, way into the third act there were a couple of 180 degree turns that nearly took my head off.

Along Came a Spider is the first and the sequel is Kiss The Girls!!!!The book was absolutely brilliant and kept you on the edge of your seat for the whole time. This movie strays far away from it and instead greatly reduces the story. The end comes way too abruptly while on the other hand, the book was a lot longer. The kidnapper, Gary Soneji, eludes the police numerous times in the book and does a lot more. On top of it, in the book, you never know if the killer has a split personality and it's not his fault because of his mental condition or if he's just evil and crazy. The movie isn't even that bad but it screwed over the movie. I think that the director of this movie only read the first 100 pages and then made a movie. A lot more happens! This movie is just way too short, and ruins an excellent book. My recommendation is to read the book and forget the movie. The book is excellent, thrilling and will keep you on the edge of your seat.Oh and by the way, Alex Cross was supposed to be a young detective not a 60 year old one!

No offense to Morgan, but he was too old for this role to begin with yet they went with him because of his name and acting chops.

Shrimpie Goldberg is non-existent and D'mitri is the object of Meghan's affections??? Gone is the cellar in the barn and somehow there is a boat... And, Soneji/Murphy is now dead and therefore cannot come back in a later installment! Truly disappointing, hence the four stars.Kyle Craig does show up and there is an anonymous ransom drop that the doers get away with that is actually a little more creative than the book...

The scene caught my attention and my interest, but as the story steadily moved towards the ending, i began to feel that i have seen these scenes before. the ending is not really that shocking partly because Potter didnt act very well in this film (under-acting, as opposed to over-acting, kills some performances).And it's this kind of movie that shows whether an actor/actress is really all they're made out to be. When an actor (morgan freeman) stars in a lackluster film and is still a good actor, then that is a trademark of greatness. the other actors/ actresses do a fair job, but the kidnapper needs special mention because he does an excellent job, very convincing.I liked Kiss the Girls, perhaps because Ashley Judd is a much better actress than Potter is, but also perhaps because the story was more solid. While this film is attempting to shock us and throw a twist at every scene, it fails to really make us care about any of the characters.Now that ive said all that, I must say that this movie's first act (you'll know what i mean when you see it) is much better than its second act. if the movie would've maybe stuck a little closer to the nature of the 1st act then i would've given this film 4 stars - but instead the film drivels off into cliched territory where i dont really care what happens next.Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors alive right now, he has incredible timing, ive never seen him over-act or go out of character.

Not because of the pathos that comes along with such a case all the time, every time. Not because of the failed attempt of the girl to escape. Not because of the child's father's over-reacting. It works because the plot is too simple to be accepted like that. A solitary man could not have planned and realized that plot in Washington DC, with the Russian security services looking after the son of the Ambassador and the secret service working there full time in that private school. Too much security in that school for such a kidnapping to have been done by only one person. Then there must have been accomplices and that's how the film works because we do not know who he or she or they is or are and we are looking out for the clues, for the punch line, for the final and supreme plotter. And that's just what it is all about, one plotter double-crossing the other or the others, or even maybe three tiers instead of just two, and maybe even four tiers, and we are double-crossed in a magnificent way just the very same way the profiling cop is double-crossed in a very standard way. The profiler is profiled by the criminal and then side-tracked because when you know the profile of the profiler the profiler becomes predictable and then inefficient, impotent. So that helps to take the medicine down indeed, even if the girl survives only because the criminals did not do one thing right, only one thing, one single and unique thing.

538187,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00003CXUX,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[10, 11]","It seems as though I am in the minority with this film.  I enjoyed the plot twists, though you had to follow them carefully.  If you were watching you could, in theory, figure out who the bad guys are, though you really do not have all the facts to truly figure out every detail, somewhat like a Sherlock Holmes story.Our story focuses on one Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), who has carefully planned to kidnap the daughter of U.S. Senator Hank Rose, unconvincingly played by Michael Moriarty.  The point of the kidnapping is not to kidnap Megan (Mika Boreem), but to get access to a foreign diplomat's son, who is good friends with Megan.  Mr. Soneji is, as might be guessed, a bit of a wacko.  He wants Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), a famous profiler, to chronicle the battle of wits between them.  Ultimately there is a showdown between the two of them, but the showdown does not reveal the location of Megan.The plot twists and thickens more, and yet, there were clues in several places, I thought.  I was quite puzzled when the security guards went running out the front of the school instead of just closing the gates.  Further, I thought someone would have at least tried to grab a car to follow the kidnapper.  Later, Jezzie Flanagan (Monica Potter) has a chance to shoot the kidnapper and does not, though she seemed to have a chance to wound him.  All these little tidbits hint at the convolutions within the plot that are revealed only near the end of the movie.The convolutions did entertain me, and I got much more enjoyment out of trying to figure out the plot than with gunshots and car chases.  However, I prefer ""Murder, She Wrote,"" ""Columbo,"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"" to movies with nearly all action and no intelligence in their plot.  When you watch this movie, you do have to pay attention or you will lose direction, and you will see more plot holes than there actually are.  I thought nearly everything was explained as the movie progressed, and the only plot holes were mistakes by those involved in the kidnapping of Megan.There were four standout actors in this film.  Morgan Freeman is excellent, as usual, as Alex Cross.  Michael Wincott is quite convincing as the marginally sane Gary Soneji.  Monica Potter brings a good balance of strength and vulnerability to her role as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flanagan.  The real surprise performance is by Mika Boreem as Megan Rose.  Megan tries very hard to get away throughout the movie, and uses her head continuously, incidentally saving her own life.

It almost guarantees that a good piece of the audience will dislike the film simply because it diverges from the book and never even notice that it is a good film all on its own.And it is a good film.  Morgan Freeman does a superb job of portraying Detective Alex Cross as he tries to peel away the layers of a kidnapping that gets away from everyone - kidnapper and police alike.  Gary Soneji(Michael Wincott), a teacher at a posh school for the children of the powerful, decides to improve his social standing by kidnapping Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), a senator's daughter.  He has everything worked out in detail, including getting Cross out of of semi-retirement, in order to demonstrate Soneji's brilliance.Joined by Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter). who was the secret service agent on duty when Soneji makes his move, Cross begins to sift through the details to try to understand Soneji enough to win Megan's Freedom.  With each fact comes more confusion and the plot will zigzag all over the event horizon before the final confrontation.  In many ways, this is a compelling combination of police procedural and suspense/psychotic film as the film switches back and forth between Cross and Soneji.  A lot of people get shot, but the film doesn't dwell on the gory parts.Mika Boorem does a fantastic job as the kidnapped girl, by the way.  She manages to find an unusual balance between fearful weakness and a surprising inner strength.  The film is well directed in a nicely understated way.  If it wasn't for the arbitrary changes to an already good plot Along Came A Spider would have been a real winner.  But even so, the basic surprises are carried over from the book to the film, the work is good, and the popcorn is warm.

538194,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00003CXUX,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[41, 47]","At the time that I am writing this review I see 140 of these DVDs listed used starting at $2.98.  I would consider it a bargain for 3 times that!To the movie:I have not read the Alex Cross novels, so I am not able to comment on the movies based on them being faithful or not to the book. I HAVE seen both ""Along Came A Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"" and I enjoyed ""Spider"" much more, even though KTG was a good stab at the thriller genre.Morgan Freeman inhabits Alex Cross more completely, and I suspect that my appreciation of his performance was a combination of his wonderfully intelligent acting and Lee Tamahori's direction.  This version of Cross is intelligent, compassionate, brave, and scarcely takes a wrong step.  He'd be a good teacher and a good person to go get a beer with.  And if some psychotic killer were on your trail - he's the guy you'd want tracking the killer.*WARNING! Silence of the Lambs Spoiler in this paragraph!*The writers of thrillers have begun doing cartwheels trying to out ""surprise"" all that came before.  I can't pinpoint when this began.... but do you remember the surprise in ""Silence of the Lambs"" when Hannibal Lector suddenly appears from beneath the sheets in the ambulance?  The story here throws in several twists, and although in the lesser thriller you can often sense the ""twists"" a country mile before it occurs, I found myself genuinely surprised several times.It is worth mentioning both the character and performance given by young Mika Boorem as Megan Rose, the kidnapped daughter of a U.S. Senator.  In many thrillers adults often behave as if they've been lobotomized, with victims giving killers ample opportunity to have their way and with killers who give the hero a boring explanation of their motives as they also give the hero plenty of time to get the drop on them.  Megan Rose is no such character.  She is smart, resourceful, and after being kidnapped she plainly has no plans other than escaping.  A handful of times she thwarts the villains in ways that would not be thought of by any of the adults you see on ""Jerry Springer"".Monica Potter stands up adequately next to Morgan Freeman's powerful performance as Jezzie, the Secret Service Agent who was supposed to be guarding Megan when she is kidnapped suddenly by one of her teachers at her upscale prep school.  It seemed a little odd to me that Alex Cross would be initially reluctant to form an alliance with a Secret Service Agent when in ""Kiss The Girls"" he doesn't have any problem with becoming investigative partners with an amateur - a medical intern.There are several sequences which I found clever and suspenseful, such as the one in which a ransom of a thermos full of diamonds is transferred to the kidnapper - I always wonder how kidnappers think they're going to get away with it when they're trying to ransom - for you to get your loot you HAVE to go to where the loot is, right?  And if the ransom is several million, won't the cops be waiting for you?  The way THIS kidnapper overcomes this dillemma is ingenious.... and I read on the IMDB that this sequence was based on a similar sequence from ""High and Low"" by Kurosawa.At one point Alex Cross finds himself in the kidnapper's house, looking at two years of work that went into developing the kidnapping plan and he plainly has some admiration.""Imagine the patience...the dedication..."" he murmurs.Jezzie responds ""You sound like an admirer.""""Well, he's like a spider. I happen to like spiders.""I happen to like movies with clever villains, clever resourceful victims, sequences that pay homage to Kurosawa, and smart characters and actors like Morgan Freeman.Plus you can buy it for less than a rental at Blockbuster....",5,4 1/2 Stars actually - This DVD is a bargain!,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,3709,"['time', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'see', '140', 'DVDs', 'listed', 'used', 'starting', '2.98', 'would', 'consider', 'bargain', '3', 'times', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'novels', 'am', 'not', 'able', 'comment', 'movies', 'based', 'being', 'faithful', 'not', 'book', 'HAVE', 'seen', 'Along', 'Came', 'A', 'Spider', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'enjoyed', 'Spider', 'much', 'more', 'even', 'KTG', 'was', 'good', 'stab', 'thriller', 'genre.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'more', 'completely', 'suspect', 'appreciation', 'performance', 'was', 'combination', 'wonderfully', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'direction', 'version', 'Cross', 'intelligent', 'compassionate', 'brave', 'scarcely', 'wrong', 'step', ""'d"", 'be', 'good', 'teacher', 'good', 'person', 'go', 'get', 'beer', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'were', 'trail', 'guy', ""'d"", 'want', 'tracking', 'killer.*WARNING', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Spoiler', 'paragraph', '*The', 'writers', 'thrillers', 'have', 'begun', 'doing', 'cartwheels', 'trying', 'surprise', 'came', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'when', 'began', 'do', 'remember', 'surprise', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'when', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'suddenly', 'sheets', 'ambulance', 'story', 'here', 'several', 'twists', 'lesser', 'thriller', 'can', 'often', 'sense', 'twists', 'country', 'mile', 'found', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'several', 'times.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'character', 'performance', 'given', 'young', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'many', 'thrillers', 'adults', 'often', 'behave', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lobotomized', 'victims', 'giving', 'killers', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'have', 'way', 'killers', 'who', 'give', 'hero', 'boring', 'explanation', 'motives', 'also', 'give', 'hero', 'plenty', 'time', 'get', 'drop', 'Megan', 'Rose', 'such', 'character', 'smart', 'resourceful', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'plainly', 'plans', 'other', 'escaping', 'handful', 'times', 'villains', 'ways', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'thought', 'adults', 'see', 'Jerry', 'Springer', '.Monica', 'Potter', 'up', 'adequately', 'next', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Jezzie', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'guarding', 'Megan', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'suddenly', 'one', 'teachers', 'upscale', 'prep', 'school', 'seemed', 'little', 'odd', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'would', 'be', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'form', 'alliance', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'when', 'Kiss', 'Girls', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'becoming', 'investigative', 'partners', 'amateur', 'medical', 'intern.There', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'found', 'clever', 'suspenseful', 'such', 'one', 'ransom', 'thermos', 'full', 'diamonds', 'transferred', 'kidnapper', 'always', 'wonder', 'how', 'kidnappers', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'away', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'ransom', 'get', 'loot', 'HAVE', 'go', 'where', 'loot', 'right', 'ransom', 'several', 'million', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cops', 'be', 'waiting', 'way', 'THIS', 'dillemma', 'ingenious', 'read', 'IMDB', 'sequence', 'was', 'based', 'similar', 'sequence', 'High', 'Low', 'Kurosawa.At', 'one', 'point', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'kidnapper', 'house', 'looking', 'two', 'years', 'work', 'went', 'developing', 'kidnapping', 'plan', 'plainly', 'admiration', 'Imagine', 'patience', 'dedication', 'sound', 'admirer', 'Well', 'spider', 'happen', 'spiders', 'happen', 'like', 'movies', 'clever', 'villains', 'clever', 'resourceful', 'victims', 'sequences', 'pay', 'homage', 'Kurosawa', 'smart', 'characters', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman.Plus', 'can', 'buy', 'less', 'rental', 'Blockbuster']",N/A

Despite what everyone says, if it quacks like a duck and acts like a duck, then sometimes it's a cartoon replica or an impostor of some sort. An important girl gets taken from a secure school by her quasiteacher, Sonji, who barely escapes. He puts her in his boat; this is only important bc she later sets the boat on fire in a futile attempt to escape. This girl seems to be so smart that she's only a step or two down from Urkel or Smart Guy intelligence--a pretty smart little girl. Sonji is looking for infamy, but infamy on a grand scale. So, he tries to kidnap the Russian President's little boy, but Cross  puts 2 and 2 together and gets 4 after figuring out Sonji's MO and subroutines of it. He and his partner foil the plan. His partner supposedly panics and tries to kill Sonji instead of apprehend him. Next[I will not spoil this part, but ""supposedly"" Sonji's so angry about his plan not working that he asks for a ransom for the first time], Cross is ordered to deliver a 10 million dollar ransom out of a train to a waiting thief. I don't think that I can give you anymore except that the little girl--helped slightly by an intelligence beyond her years--is rescued by Cross.

This is not a sequel. Cross is a character in a series of books by James Patterson. Like the books they are based on, the movies are thrillers. All thrillers are not created equally, and Along Came a Spider is inferior to its predecessor. Freeman is as good as ever. The movie is full of surprises, and there are indeed some intense moments. The problem is the script. Whenever the movie tries to explain a previous scene, that scene is more full of plot holes than the one it is trying to explain. Still, the movie can prove enjoyable as long as you park your thinking cap next to the popcorn.The movie starts with a wild police pursuit in which Cross' partner is killed. Devastated, Cross goes into seclusion, uncertain whether or not he will be able to work again. Meanwhile, in a posh private school in the District of Columbia, student Megan Rose [Mika Boorem] is kidnapped by a teacher, Gary Sonji [Michael Wincott]. Megan is the daughter of a United States senator. This means that Jezzie Flannigan [Monica Potter], the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the girl, is in a lot of trouble. Cross, drawn against his will into the case, takes her under his wing, and the two set out to find Megan. The road they follow is full of dangerous twists and turns.Besides Freeman and those suspenseful scenes, there are some good elements. I liked Megan, because she is a kid with guts. She is as much heroine as victim, using her wits as often as possible. Wincott makes a convincing villain, effectively utilizing his sinister good looks. The photography is atmospheric and gives the movie a properly creepy look.It's too bad all the good parts of the movie don't make up for the confused plot. It is Sonji who calls Cross after the kidnapping and taunts him into coming out of retirement, but why he does this is never adequately explained. Sonji kidnaps Megan to get to his real target, Megan's best friend at school who is the son of the President of Russia. Why in the world is this kid in an American school? Why didn't Sonji just kidnap him in the first place? These are the kinds of questions many viewers will ask while watching the movie. A thriller generally works through suspension of disbelief. If you don't ask yourself questions until the movie is over, the movie succeeds in its mission. When the questions start during its first half hour, it hasn't done its job properly.",2,Only if you like thrill-less thrillers,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2529,"['Came', 'Spider', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'second', 'appearance', 'forensic', 'psychologist', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'first', 'was', '1997', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'not', 'sequel', 'Cross', 'character', 'series', 'books', 'James', 'Patterson', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'movies', 'are', 'thrillers', 'thrillers', 'are', 'not', 'created', 'equally', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'inferior', 'predecessor', 'Freeman', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'movie', 'full', 'surprises', 'are', 'indeed', 'intense', 'moments', 'problem', 'script', 'Whenever', 'movie', 'explain', 'previous', 'scene', 'scene', 'more', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'one', 'trying', 'explain', 'Still', 'movie', 'can', 'prove', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'long', 'park', 'thinking', 'cap', 'popcorn.The', 'movie', 'wild', 'police', 'pursuit', 'Cross', 'partner', 'killed', 'Devastated', 'Cross', 'seclusion', 'uncertain', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'work', 'again', 'Meanwhile', 'posh', 'private', 'school', 'District', 'Columbia', 'student', 'Megan', 'Rose', '[', 'Mika', 'Boorem', ']', 'kidnapped', 'teacher', 'Gary', 'Sonji', '[', 'Michael', 'Wincott', ']', 'Megan', 'daughter', 'United', 'States', 'senator', 'Jezzie', 'Flannigan', '[', 'Monica', 'Potter', ']', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'assigned', 'protect', 'girl', 'lot', 'trouble', 'Cross', 'drawn', 'will', 'case', 'wing', 'two', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'Megan', 'road', 'follow', 'full', 'dangerous', 'twists', 'turns.Besides', 'Freeman', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'elements', 'liked', 'Megan', 'kid', 'guts', 'as', 'much', 'heroine', 'victim', 'using', 'wits', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'Wincott', 'convincing', 'villain', 'effectively', 'utilizing', 'sinister', 'good', 'looks', 'photography', 'atmospheric', 'movie', 'properly', 'creepy', 'look.It', 'too', 'bad', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'confused', 'plot', 'Sonji', 'who', 'Cross', 'kidnapping', 'taunts', 'coming', 'retirement', 'why', 'never', 'adequately', 'explained', 'Sonji', 'Megan', 'get', 'real', 'target', 'Megan', 'best', 'friend', 'school', 'who', 'son', 'President', 'Russia', 'Why', 'world', 'kid', 'American', 'school', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Sonji', 'just', 'kidnap', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'kinds', 'questions', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'ask', 'watching', 'movie', 'thriller', 'generally', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'questions', 'movie', 'movie', 'mission', 'When', 'questions', 'start', 'first', 'hour', ""n't"", 'done', 'job', 'properly']",N/A

A kidnapper snatches the Senator's daughter, Meghan, with no real motive or purpose.  Trying to piece the puzzle together after Cross receives a phone call from the kidnapper, he teams up with the Secret Service Agent assigned to protect Meghan (Monica Potter).  The kidnapper seems to have no specific demands, but just toys with Cross.  But the tables turn drastically as Cross races to figure out what is really going on in this kidnapper's head, wondering why the kidnapper is saying he's proof that the mind can be an evil thing.WHAT WORKS: Amazing acting and chemistry between the characters, a remarkable plot with very unexpected twists at every turn, and undeniable spine tingling suspense and thrills.WHAT DOESN'T: The film can be too smart for the average audience who won't be able to understand some of the plot pieces that fit together so the film adds up.THE CATCH: You really don't need to see KISS THE GIRLS before you watch this film.  This is a movie in its own, even though it follows the character of Alex Cross.OVERALL: &quot;This is a knockout thriller which punches the buttons of all the other suspense films this year.

Most of the time, that is the really big disadvantage of reading the book before seeing the movie.  &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; was an okay movie, but it could've been a lot better.When a insane lunatic decides that he wants to be famous, he kidnaps a daughter of a senator.  After that, he contacts Alex Cross, and invites him to join his little game.  After trying to get away from the detective life after he had lost his partner, Cross knows he's back in the game, and that he may be the only hope the little girl has.  As he goes through a series of clues, Alex Cross realizes that the man who kidnapped the girl does not want money, he wants fame.  He wants to commit the crime of the century.  Now, Alex has to find out what exactly the kidnapper plans before it's too late.The book was a lot more suspenseful and thrilling than the movie.  The book was also a lot more sick and disturbing.  The kidnapper played by Michael Wincott, (who is also the bad guy in &quot;The Crow&quot;, and &quot;Metro), should've been more dangerous and psychotic, just like he is in the book.  In fact, if you read the book and picture Wincott as the kidnapper, it will send chills down your spine.  There were a lot of great things that happened in the book that don't even appear in the movie!  The very beginning of the movie seems very phony and fake; you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.  The DVD should've had more special features as well.  The only ones I could find were the theatrical trailer and a documentary on the making of the movie.Is this movie suspenseful?  Does it have some startling twists?  Does this movie keep you on the edge of your seat?  Yes, it does all of that, but not as well as the book does.  If you're more into movies than books, then see it.  If you like books better, read the book instead.

538206,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00003CXUX,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","I knew of two movies involving the character of Alex Cross: Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls.  I've seen neither and was interested as to what this mini-franchise is all about.  Plus I think Morgan Freeman is the bomb and was thrilled to hear he was the movie lead.The movie starts out with Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) following his partner, a pretty female cop who is a passenger to a known serial killer.  It's all a clever sting (oh the insect metaphors, I can't help myself!), but the plan falls apart when the serial killer decides he'd like a little pre-warm-up activity from his passenger.In an inexplicable moment of vulnerability, Cross' partner starts wailing that she doesn't want her face shoved into the lap of a serial killer.  Which is understandable, but not what we would expect of a cop trained to go undercover as serial killer bait.  Sure enough, the bad guy discovers the cop's ploy when he finds her earpiece (whatever happened to wires?) and things go downhill from there.The cop draws a gun on her companion, who freaks out.  Or maybe it's the cop who freaks out.  She shoots him dead, the car spins out of control and lands on the edge of a bridge (or a dam, hard to tell).  She screams helplessly for Cross' help, who can't save her.  She plunges to her death.This makes Cross understandably morose about his profession.  What is his profession, exactly?  It seems he's a cop.  But he's written a book about serial killers, so perhaps he's a profiler.  Since I'm writing my own book about this very subject, I found it curious that Cross' expertise is never fully explained.  Every mystery author wants his good guy to be a Bob Ressler or a John Douglas.  But it takes work to pull off these men as actual people as opposed to walking caricatures of Sherlock Holmes.Fade to...Children of important diplomats and politicians are sequestered in a high-security school known as the Cathedral.  There, kids attend weird classes with projects like, ""find Charles Lindbergh on the Web in the smallest number of hops.""  Get it?  Web?  Spider?I know, I was stunned by the connection too.As it turns out, the teacher of the class is actually a highly trained kidnapper, Gary Soneji (played by the gravelly Michael Wincott of The Crow and The Three Musketeers fame).  Soneji's been buried within the Cathedral hierarchy for two years using latex appliances and an amazing device that conceals his fingertips.We're never told where Soneji acquired these skills.  My guess is he was an ex-government agent of some country.  But the movie deems those facts unimportant.  What's important is that Soneji knows of Cross--he's read Cross' book, after all--and decides he will provide the kidnapping of the century by mimicking the kidnapping of the Lindbergh Baby. This of course means he makes an obligatory phone call, voice disguised, to Cross, thus dragging him into the plot.Soneji kidnaps poor Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), daughter of Senator Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty, of Law and Order fame, who only gets like three lines).  But really, Megan's just a ploy to get closer to another, more important child (Dmitri Stardubov, played by Anton Yelchin) of a Russian diplomat.  Imagine, if Soneji kidnapped the little Russian boy, there'd be an ""INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.""Those words are expressed over and over.  We're never entirely sure what the implications are, but they sound really bad.  Why is the Russian boy in an American school?  Why would it create an incident?  Who is the kid's father, anyway?Bristling after the embarrassing loss of her charge, Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) is determined to catch the bad guy.  That's JEZZIE, not JESSIE, for some reason I cannot fathom.After all, it's thanks to her bumbling and another agent, Ben Devine (Billy Burke), that the Megan was kidnapped. Ollie McArthur (Dylan Baker), another agent, is put on the case, for the sole purpose of insulting Cross and then barking orders at people.The character of Soneji seems awkwardly conceived.  Is her supposed to be a serial killer?  We discover that Soneji did burn down his parents' house when he was young, a trait that's definitely evident in serial killers.  He's most decidedly the ""organized"" type, capable of holding down a job, purchasing a boat, and doing a lot of other things that require an orderly, structured mind.  But he's so one-dimensional, so utterly focused on being known as a kidnapper, that his later confession about his past seems forced.  In essence, Soneji feels like a villain some writer (James Patterson wrote the novel, Marc Moss wrote the screenplay) whipped up to be a foil for our hero.It turns out the kids use ""Stego"" encryption to conceal the ""equivalent of passing notes"" in .GIF files that they send to each other in class.  Megan and Dmitri use it and Soneji does too.  He leaves clues to the kidnapping embedded in those .GIF files, revolving around Charles Lindbergh.  One of those clues leads to the World's Clearest Webcam, which focuses on a patch of wall in Soneji's home (!).It's a sad statement about the movie industry that many of the plot points that lead to the real bad guys have to do with incompetence on the part of the authorities.  There are several situations throughout the film where people don't do what they should to catch the bad guy, but the movie provides these moments as obvious, ""duh, they were incompetent on PURPOSE,"" examples.See, I was far too preoccupied with the fact that Soneji walks in and out of peoples' homes unchallenged, that he seems to know where everyone is at all times, to start questioning other stupidity like security guards not reacting fast enough or shooting when they should.  What's thrown out as proof of another, secret plan to make money off of a kidnapping is lost in the morass of confusing plot points.  In other words, if you're going to use discrepancies in character actions to reveal the mystery, everything else going on in the movie better be sewed up tightly.It isn't.The person who carries most of the movie is really Boorem, who plays a clever, frightened girl quite capable of escaping on her own, thank-you-very-much.  She manages not one but two major escapes from the bad guys without help from anybody.  Boorem's scenes are the best part of the film.Potter is suitably nervous and frustrated as a pretty agent, but she's a little too severe to empathize with.  That said, she has such a striking resemblance to Julia Roberts that it's distracting.  She has the same smile, same drawl, same arching eyebrows.  Potter just doesn't have the charm, but then again that might be appropriate for the plot.Then there's Freeman, who adopts the tired, world-weary narrative that he did better in Se7en and The Shawshank Redemption.  At one point, Cross has to run all over town at the kidnapper's whim, such that the scene becomes comical rather than compelling.  Freeman deserves better.Along Came a Spider tries to be serious, mysterious, action-packed, scary, and ironic.  We know this because the music forcefully tells us when those moments are.  But the movie just doesn't have a compelling plot to back it up. Even with the major twist mid-movie.In a lot of ways, the film reminded me of the Watcher.  And that's not a compliment.",2,Oh what a tangled Web we weave!,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,7268,"['knew', 'two', 'movies', 'involving', 'character', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider',

538208,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00003CXUX,Mike,"[0, 0]","""Along Came a Spider"" (2001)I'm a big fan of James Patterson novels. I enjoy the mystery and intelligence he puts into his books. I also highly enjoyed the adaptation of his book Kiss the Girls, which was put on the screen in 1997. Along Came a Spider is one of Patterson's most acclaimed novels, and it would be a hard job putting it on screen without some criticism. I agree with many critics that the movie could've been improved, but I still enjoyed this thrill ride.Morgan Freeman returns as Alex Cross, and yet again he embodies this fantastic detective with a style so strong and cool, and this is especially impressive for Freeman's age. Ashley Judd from Kiss the Girls is replaced by Monica Potter, who does nowhere as good as Judd's Oscar-worthy breakthrough, but Potter does make for an impressive and interestingly played sidekick to Freeman's Cross. The rest of the actors are merely okay, and pretty much there just to black up Freeman and Potter.The movie kick starts to an impressive and intriguing first half. In particular the first five minutes are amazingly action-packed (especially for such a small amount of time!) and get the movie on a good action feel. This movie actually moves a lot quicker than Kiss the Girls, but unfortunately doesn't build up as much atmosphere or have enough character development. Unfortunately as the movie brings a fabulous first half, the second half is not nearly as believable or interesting, unlike Kiss the Girls (yes, I know there are too many comparisons in this review) which went the opposite way around, and worked much better. The actual finale you don't see coming at all throughout the movie and is very clever, but the stuff in between the first half and final few shots is frankly pretty...The movie is also let down by some inexcusably silly scenes (Soneji parks the boat, tries to get this Dimitri kid, Potter and Freeman see him, don't shoot, and then just let him go? Is that what a real detective would do in this situation?). The kids in this movie weren't as annoying as I thought they would be (the young girl who is kidnapped is actually a very good actress, despite her horrible performance in Riding in Cars With Boys), but they are just way too smart. I didn't believe for one second that they could decode computers, make a fire burn with something electronic, or figure out completely mind-boggling puzzles.Another thing that got on my nerves was the usage of cell phones in the film! In one sequence, there are about 7 different conversations all used over different cell phones. The sequence in which I am talking about, is when Soneji (the kidnapper) plays his cat-and-mouse game with Cross, and makes him run here, there and everywhere. If I was a detective in his situation, I wouldn't exactly do everything the kidnapper was telling me (Cross, of course, does this, which proves a tense atmosphere, but an unrealistic backbone). Especially when the kidnapper can't see him?There is no lack of suspense in the film, the performances are good, the opening use of CGI is fabulous and the direction is spot-on excellent. I did find too many flaws to give this an above-average rating and fans of Patterson may be disappointed, but I can recommend Along Came a Spider for a late night suspense thriller.MY GRADE: C+",3,Mediocre thriller that delivers on some levels,1018310400,"04 9, 2002",2002,3298,"['Along', 'Came', 'Spider', '2001', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'James', 'Patterson', 'novels', 'enjoy', 'mystery', 'intelligence', 'books', 'also', 'highly', 'enjoyed', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'was', 'put', 'screen', '1997', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'one', 'Patterson', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'novels', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'job', 'putting', 'screen', 'criticism', 'agree', 'many', 'critics', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'improved', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'thrill', 'Freeman', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'yet', 'again', 'fantastic', 'detective', 'style', 'so', 'strong', 'cool', 'especially', 'impressive', 'Freeman', 'age', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'replaced', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'who', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'Judd', 'Oscar-worthy', 'breakthrough', 'Potter', 'make', 'impressive', 'interestingly', 'played', 'sidekick', 'Freeman', 'Cross', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'merely', 'okay', 'pretty', 'much', 'there', 'just', 'black', 'up', 'Freeman', 'Potter.The', 'movie', 'kick', 'impressive', 'intriguing', 'first', 'half', 'particular', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'amazingly', 'action-packed', 'especially', 'such', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'get', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'feel', 'movie', 'actually', 'lot', 'quicker', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'build', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'not', 'nearly', 'believable', 'interesting', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'yes', 'know', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'comparisons', 'review', 'went', 'opposite', 'way', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'actual', 'finale', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'movie', 'very', 'clever', 'stuff', 'first', 'half', 'final', 'few', 'shots', 'frankly', 'pretty', 'movie', 'also', 'let', 'down', 'inexcusably', 'silly', 'scenes', 'Soneji', 'boat', 'tries', 'get', 'Dimitri', 'kid', 'Potter', 'Freeman', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'then', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'what', 'real', 'detective', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'kids', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'annoying', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'horrible', 'performance', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'smart', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'second', 'could', 'decode', 'computers', 'make', 'fire', 'burn', 'something', 'electronic', 'figure', 'out', 'completely', 'mind-boggling', 'puzzles.Another', 'thing', 'got', 'nerves', 'was', 'usage', 'cell', 'phones', 'film', 'one', 'sequence', 'are', '7', 'different', 'conversations', 'used', 'different', 'cell', 'phones', 'sequence', 'am', 'talking', 'when', 'Soneji', 'kidnapper', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Cross', 'run', 'here', 'everywhere', 'was', 'detective', 'situation', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'do', 'everything', 'kidnapper', 'was', 'telling', 'Cross', 'course', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'unrealistic', 'backbone', 'Especially', 'when', 'kidnapper', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'lack', 'suspense', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'opening', 'use', 'CGI', 'fabulous', 'direction', 'spot-on', 'excellent', 'did', 'find', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'give', 'above-average', 'rating', 'fans', 'Patterson', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'can', 'recommend', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'late', 'night', 'suspense', 'thriller.MY', 'GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

Detective Cross is a serial kidnapper profiler who becomes involved in a cat and mouse chase that ensues when the daughter of a US Senator is abducted from her high security private school.  In order to solve the crime Freeman teams up with the head Secret Service agent in charge of security at the kidnapped child's school, a dubiously cast Monica Potter.  Since I am only used to seeing Ms. Monica frolic about in lightweight chick flick films I was surprised to see her granted such a meaty role...but anyway.This is the sort of movie that is better if you know as little about it as possible so I will not spoil it for you by getting into details.  I will say that, like a spider's web, the plot is as intricately woven and full of dead flies (just kidding about the flies).  Some parts of the story are completely unpredictable and exciting while others are almost expected...but in the end you'll wonder about the expected parts...that's all I can say.Freeman does a fine job in his role...but he's had enough practice don't ya think (""Kiss The Girls"", ""Seven"").  Potter, though at first seemed only cast for her pretty face, really pulls off her role well-I have to admit that I was surprised and as a results she's chalked up a few points in my book.Recommendation:  This film is interesting, suspenseful, and well worth the watch.  The people I've spoken with have given it mixed reviews.

However, the movie simply deviates too much from its source material to truly merit the description of ""adaptation"".  While the plot of the movie was good and its cast was superb (isn't Morgan Freeman always?), this film might have done better in my eyes had it not been adapted from the novel of the same name to begin with.  Ultimately, they don't share much apart from the character names and a few plot details.  I do understand that a movie must take certain liberties with its source material, especially a novel, as there are time constraints.  But so much that made this novel great was cut out and, in many cases, replaced by plot devices which probably did not take up more or less time than the original.  Perhaps this was a book that would have been best served by a movie split into two parts (i.e. like the 7th Harry Potter book.)  As a general crime thriller, I say it's far above average mostly thanks to its casting choices, but I feel so much more could have been done with it even if it weren't an adaptation.  As for my recommendation, I do recommend it to anyone who's a fan of crime thrillers with a decent plot and a great cast.

Most of my Kiss the Girls  review could be cut and pasted into this one, and that is the film's main failing; there's just not that much new here. The movie is a strictly paint-by-numbers mystery flick of the kind that seems to have been endemic over the past  couple of years. It's a good enough way to escape from the world for a couple of hours, but it ranks in the empty calories section of the video rental shelf: you won't take anything away from it.The film opens with the daughter of a Senator (Michael Moriarty) being kidnapped from her school. The kidnapper gets Cross involved in the investigation  by dropping a piece of evidence off in his mailbox and calling him. Jezzie Flanagan (Potter), who's been the Secret Service agent in charge of guarding the kid, latches onto him, and the two end up as partners in the  investigation.The plot twists show up exactly where you expect them, and should be predictable to anyone who's watched more than five mysteries between The Thirty- Nine Steps and Kiss the Girls.

It just happened that the &quot;something&quot; was this ridiculous waste of time and Morgan Freeman's acting ability (which should be a crime). I never read the book, as I am not a Patterson fan, so I can't compare the two. All I know is... After the very cliched prologue (i.e. the part that has nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the movie), the movie doesn't deviate from the cheap-o thriller rut. Freeman does what he can with the painfully bad dialogue, but to no avail. This was so predictable I found myself doing a mental checklist of coming events (killer calls NOW!....check.....twist comes NOW!....check). The worst part is the so-called, much-hyped twist. A good mystery gives you suspects and clues to foreshadow twists (Usual Suspects, 6th Sense), but this is one of those cheating movies that throws a totally unexpected twist that is, at first, shocking. After thinking briefly about the twist, one realizes that there IS NO WAY TO SEE IT COMING.

There are parts that are left out of the movie that could've otherwise been included. The story is the same but other things could've been differentiated.Matt Whittman plays Gary Soneji, a kidnapper at a private school who kidnaps the senator's daughter. Morgan Freeman plays Detective Alex Cross on his trail. Monica Potter plays Jezzie Flanagan, Cross' alias in getting Soneji.I guess the first annoyance of this movie is that its only &quot;based&quot; off the book. So a lot is changed around.  The beginning starts off with Cross' partner (and it isn't Sampson for those of you who read the book) in a car with a killer and eventually action comes into play and she's soon killed off merely 5 minutes into the movie (not including the opening credits). There's the attention grabber...unfortunately the movie can only go downhill from there.Gary Soneji is very out of character. This isn't bad for those who haven't read the book.  But the movie fails to show depth to Soneji's character.  This isn't just Soneji but Alex Cross as well. The characters in the movie feel wooden at times.  The dialogue is pretty corny at times so likewise most characters feel the same.The other part that annoys me is in the book they constantly told you that Gary Soneji wanted to commit the crime of the century.  In the movie there is no motivation whatsoever so you wonder &quot;What is Soneji's motive?&quot;  &quot;Why is he doing this?&quot;  Believe me you'll learn that it isn't for money.The plot twist wasn't done too well either.  We're supposed to believe that the senator's daughter was kidnapped from the boat Soneji imprisoned her on when we NEVER see it happen!  You wonder how she got to her new location near the end of the movie.Lastly, the ending.  With a few exceptions its easy to say the ending is usually changed for the worst and in this movie IT WAS FOR THE WORST!  Alex finds the girl and then it just...ends. No falling action or resolution it just ends.If you really loved the book the movie will more than likely disappoint you.

A particular role can overwhelm the story, or the story can be so convoluted as to leave the actors no room to maneuver.  Spider comes closer to the second option.  The film's plot concerns the kidnapping of a Senator's daughter from a high tone prep school.  There are Secret Service types all over the place [including one in background reading a magazine, which is hilarious in itself], and the one in charge, Monica Potter, roundly berates herself for failing to prevent the snatch.  The kidnapper, who's not a child abuser, has taken the kid in a bid to match wits with Morgan Freeman, ""perp"" analyst Alex Cross.  Can the kidnapper keep Mika Boorem alive and well, while crossing psychic swords with Freeman yet still pull this caper off?  Will Freeman make a pass at Potter to salve the loss of his partner?It's both fascinating and depressing to watch how one performer of style and class can nearly redeem an inadequately structured film.  In Spider, Morgan Freeman, who has a full payload of both, is in a position to keep this film together, but isn't allowed to do it.  In his role, Freeman  must be able to weave tenuous threads to create personality profiles in narrowing down  suspect lists.  While there's little doubt Freeman could portray such a role with ease, we aren't really allowed to watch the process unfold in Spider.  Director Tamahori, however, is too busy weaving his own threads.In Tamahori's hands, James Patterson's novel becomes a jerky sequence of thinly connected scenarios.  The plot, which is full of wonderful surprises, follows multiple paths.  Like any spider's web, they only meet at the centre after some rather bouncy progress.  Boorem makes a praiseworthy effort to steal the film with her escape attempts.  Potter is fetching enough to distract from her mediocre acting.  Michael Wincott as the kidnapper might have been an excellent foil for Freeman, but the story won't let him.  The story won't let any one individual become outstanding.  On the other hand, the film is too short to let the story develop fully. We are left with a tantalizing result: a plot rich with promise, but too sketchy in its presentation, and actors who might have given award-winning performances had they been given the opportunity to develop the characters.  It's a shame, but you can't award stars for the things that didn't happen.Like so many detective films, there are numerous details that intrude on credibility.  How the kidnapper prepared for the snatch is easily the most astounding.  His ""hideout"" was positioned solely to create a crisis.  If he's intelligent enough to read and understand Cross' books, his blunders are inexcusable.  Without giving away the ransom payoff, someone please explain how the material was to be disposed of without detection.  What steps does Freeman take to work out who the villain is?  These quirks catch the viewer's attention, distracting from the film's value and the protagonists' performance.  The film is easily worth a viewing or two, but to buy it?

Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor.

This film however struggles to make a lot of sense, and limps along despite him being in the starring role.It is set in a sort of phantasy world of super criminals and heroic police. A senators daughter is kidnapped by someone who has devoted most of his life to working up to this crime. He is not interested in a ransom but rather in being respected by the Freeman character. All simply nonsense of course.Again the villian seems to have worked as a teacher for some years, not a high paying job but one that has allowed him to collect such assets that he can hide out in boats and mystery houses. It also strains credability that he has been a teacher for over a year wearing a rubber face mask.One should not give away the plot developments of the second half of the film, but in reality they stretch what is believable to the point that a film which starts out as fantasy moves into another dimension of hyper fantasy.The difficulty with such films is that as they become so contrived they lose the ability to manipulate the audience. A flim works if you feel for the victims, if the villians appear original or grab your imagination, if the main characters seem to do something right. In this film the villian appears to be a moron, the victim precocious and the solving of the crime artificial.

538283,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXUX,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","After the success of ""Kiss the Girls,"" Morgan Freeman makes a welcome reprise as Alex Cross, infallably cool, intelligent, and most of all, very human detective.  However, let me set the record straight.  It is ""Along Came a Spider"" that really is the first of the now popular series by James Patterson, not the other one, so perhaps you should consider this as a prequel, not a sequel.As if to show that fact, this film opens with a botched undercover invetigation that ends with a miserably bad result. (And, let me say, so CGI generated car crash scene is.)  Flash forward, and now, feeling guilty of this failure, Alex Cross is thinking about retiring when he is forced to join in another investigation about a kidnapped girl of a senetor in a prestigeous school.  Then his partner turns out to be an FBI agent, who also experienced bitter taste of failed protection service, now feeling guilty as much as Alex.  They start to search for the clues about the girl's whereabout and the criminal's true purpose together until coming to a very unexpected ending of the story.You are to notice that the virtue of the film lies mostly in this unlikely pair of Morgan Freeman as Alex, and Monica Potter as his parter.  In spite of given little chance to reveal their inner characterizations before the audience, their highly convincing acting succeed to enhanse the value of the whole production by several notches, letting us forget the incredible happenings and prediatable settings in the script, which actually, differs radically from the original book, so don't tell anyone about how the story develops even to any of writer James Patterson's avid readers. (For example, villainous 'Soneji' meets another fate in the film version.)  Whether or not you've read the original, it is certain that you will be surprised to find the truth behind the kiddnapping case.Or you might cry out, ""You gotta be kiddin'!"" in which case, I agree, you are not to blame.  The story itself, if you write down on paper to summerize it, would be as believable as scientific theory in ""Independence Day"" or incredible disguise of Mr. Soneji's face -- didn't any one of the teachers there notice his cheesy make-up such a long time? -- but, there you are, you find yourself pretty much entertained by this train of thrilling set-pieces presented with a moody camera.After all, it is Lee Tamahori who is officially selected to do the next 007 series, not Tamanori who directed in his earlier days ruthlessly tough dramas.  This is, as a conclusion, a good timekilling thriller, as thrilling as the Mother Goose song, on which the title is based.

It is one of the fakest special effects I have ever seen in a film.  However, I do not dwell on it.  I like to think of the good things.Morgan Freeman has got to be one of the greatest actors of all time.  He delivers a very believable, and quite captivating, performance as Alex Cross.  This movie is a must for all Freeman fans.  His character is very admirable in the way he is able to figure how what are seemingly unsolvable mysteries.Another good thing about this movie is the eeriness and suspense.  Just watch the scene where Alex Cross tries to solve the ""Missing Picture"" piece of the puzzle.  That has to be one of the creepiest scenes I have ever seen!  And even before that, when they are walking around the crime scene in the embassy, and there is silence (no score at all), it creates this feeling of mystery and spookiness.And of course, as I do with all my movie reviews, I am going to comment on the original score.  Jerry Goldsmith was the perfect choice.  Sure, it's nowhere near his most original compositions and surprisingly simple, but is still effective.  Watch the scene mentioned above and pay attention to how the score makes it work (as well as Morgan Freeman).  You should also get the album as well!

He is one of my favorite actors, so for me, I was very happy with this movie.  Not totally satisfied, though, that I can admit.I did not like the beginning of the movie.  I do think it was necessary to show what had happened to Alex Cross (Freeman), but I think the Lee Tamahori could have played it out during the movie is small parts; bit by bit.  If you've seen the movie &quot;Signs&quot;, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Alex never really feels the need to tell anyone in the movie what had happened, but us viewers just had to know.  Also, the car falling into some sort of waterfall/pit-thing didn't really cut it.  It's not the way most car accidents end.  But hey, I don't want to be a 'bad' critic here; the movie was good.  Better than I think most people give credit.  Freeman stars alongside the up-and-coming actress Monica Potter.  She's a very pretty, yet very focused individual who is flawless throughout.  I like how Morgan is always cast with a female co-star as in &quot;High Crimes&quot; and in &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;, he starred with Ashley Judd.  I think it works wonders for him, although I think it's a little ironic.  He doesn't seem like the 'girl type' person you'd only see around woman.  And in the movie &quot;Nurse Betty&quot;, he looks too awkward next to Ren&eacute;e Zellweger for comfort.If you love Freeman as an actor, I'm sure you've seen this movie.
