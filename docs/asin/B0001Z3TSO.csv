It looked like he used a stunt double in his final fight. You have to judge for yourself. There are plenty of stunts and hand to hand combat. Norris trains a replacement so that he can retire from the secret service. His replacement is a very good fighter. They make a good team. The script and direction was good. There was plenty of action and Norris kicked but. Highly recommended. This film has a sequel that is also very entertaining. If you enjoyed this film you'll like the sequel.

817638,AY12DBB0U420B,B0001Z3TSO,Gary Peterson,"[2, 2]","I've been watching a lot of Chuck Norris movies lately. I like them. They're well done. They're fast action and very entertaining. Fun to watch! Last night I viewed ""The President's Man"" on DVD. There were five deaths before the title and credits came on the screen. Ah yes, that's off to a fairly good start as far as Norris movies go.Chuck Norris movies are so outrageous that they're actually quite funny, if you have time to stop and think about it. In the early going of this movie, Norris parachutes to the top of a skyscraper, dispatches a group of hoodlums, rescues the president's wife and then jumps off the building with her clinging to his front side and with her arms tightly locked around his neck. Of course, they land safely. Well, that's Norris, ""The Prsident's Man."" The problem here Is that Norris is getting a little long in the tooth and gray in the hair and is thinking of retiring. Well, who's going to replace him? The search is on. Who's going to be the new President's Man? The search quickly narrows down to a steel-tough young fellow who is serving a thirty-year prison term for killing a man, among other things. He was screwed over, so they say. Well, this young fellow is then released and put under the supervision of Norris through about half of the movie until they are dispatched by Delta Force to Columbia to raid a major drug manufacturing operation. Death, destruction and general mayhem quickly follow as the drug cartel feels the impact of Norris and his trainee sidekick. Of  course, the two leave piles of dead and wounded bodies and the manufacturing village is blown to smithereens. (some really spectacular footage here) Well, it's just all in the life of a President's Man and the new trainee did quite well.It's a good movie. There aren't any dull spots. The action is fast and furious with some really spectacular martial arts battles. If you enjoy seeing necks popped,  this is your kinda film. I don't  rate is as high as ""Missing in Action"" or Delta Force 2,"" but it wouldn't be far back in my ranking. Chuck Norris sagas all are a lot alike, but they all seem to be well done, with fast action and highly entertaining. ""The President's Man"" fits the standard.Gary Peterson",4,Highly Entertaining.

817640,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0001Z3TSO,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","The story: when Joshua McCord (Chuck Norris,Walker, Texas Ranger), the ""president's man"" - a solitary machine who undertakes terrorist assignments too sensitive for the nation to handle publicly - seeks a replacement to take up his dangerous mantel, he finds one in Deke Slater (Dylan Neal,Blood Ties), a military hero unjustly sent to prison. In learning from the master, Deke will need to prove himself through a series of missions culminating with the rescue of a top governmental engineer from the clutches of a sadistic chemical runner (Soon-Tek Oh,Beverly Hills Ninja).During the last few years of his cinematic career, Chuck Norris was big on presenting himself as a guide or teacher to others, and this is one of the movies where it actually works well enough. Chuck Norris is still obviously *Chuck Norris* but he's got enough of a wizened air about him to pull off the part; someone else could have played the role better, but Chuck does alright. Dylan Neal as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; has some good physical moves but will take a while to grow on you, if at all, seeing as he begins the movie as a sour-faced jerk. He and Norris make an okay team, but their chemistry is unexceptional and, seeing as Norris is a martial arts instructor in real life and used to teaching, their mentor/pupil relationship could have been explored a lot more. The perpetually under-appreciated Soon-Tek Oh has only a handful of scenes and doesn't speak for half of them.There's a decent amount of action in the film, but it's not great. Dylan Neal's training scenes (wherein he throws knives at a revolving poster, runs an aerobics course, and spars with Jennifer Tung of ""Masked Rider"" fame) are decent, but if you have your heart set on real hand-to-hand stuff, you're going to be disappointed. There are enough flashes of physical competence from both of the main stars to keep you watching, but - with the exception of the pretty good showdown between Norris and Soon-Tek's stunt double - most of the fights are choreographed and shot in boring made-for-TV fashion with way too many close-ups and shots from the back.It bothers me a bit that the movie goes back in time ten years from when it was made in being a pro-America advertisement at the expense of non-Americans: most of the missions in the film are simply Chuck Norris saving rich white Americans from evil brown-skinned people. However, it's difficult to be upset by the movie because everything it presents is so very dull and run-of-the-mill. This is television B-movery at its most formulaic, from the get-it-done filming of its action scenes to the script's by-the-numbers clich&eacute;s. It's odd that a film as bland as this would be one of the few that Chuck followed up witha sequel, but then again, it was probably done as a favor to his son/director Eric. In a good mood, I'd give this movie three stars for its overall competence, but since I'm not feeling generous, it'll have to endure two for its insipidness.

He's the pioneer of the genre hands down. Over the years he's brought us so many laughs, explosions, and  broken ribs that this weeks pick was a no brainer. Unfortunately The President's Man didn't hold up to the typical Chuck Diesel feature. Maybe the fact that Eric Norris, Chuck's youngest son, directed the film explains why it was so sub-par. You would have swore it was a movie you were watching on tv since it would blackout as if a commercial was soon to follow, only to immediately pick up where it left off. However that wasn't the real problem factor here. The real issue was the weak storyline that stretched way beyond anyone's attention span.The film starts off red hot as Joshua McCord (Norris) is ripping guy's apart left and right during a mission ordered by the President. He's a college professor who moonlights as the president's right hand man and realizes he may be getting to old for this. He then decides to find the perfect replacement and stumbles upon Deke Slater, who played Pacey's gay brother on Dawson's Creek, and begins to train him Norris style. The only issue is the training last for way too long and you loose interest in what's going on. In the end Deke finally proves himself and earns the job while Chuck focuses all his efforts to promoting the Total Gym.We really were dying to love this movie since it was a Chuck feature but just couldn't. It was all over the place and took way too long to get to the conclusion. Realistically the film could have been wrapped up in a half hour.
