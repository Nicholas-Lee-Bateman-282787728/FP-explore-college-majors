Wilson ""Atheen""","[0, 2]","I enjoyed this film, probably because I didn't see Darkman before viewing it and therefore had no preconceived ideas of how it should be.  I have since seen Darkman II, which I liked less because I liked the villian less.  Mr. Fahey in Darkman III is much more versatile; he convinced me--until I  actually took time to consider it--that he was Darkman in disguise, so  different was his demeanor in those instances.  His growing insanity was  quite believable as well.  Mr. Vosloo was also quite good in his role.  His  concern for his enemy's family seemed quite genuine.",4,Darkman III,952905600,"03 13, 2000",2000,573,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Darkman', 'viewing', 'therefore', 'had', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'have', 'seen', 'Darkman', 'II', 'liked', 'less', 'liked', 'villian', 'less', 'Mr.', 'Fahey', 'Darkman', 'III', 'much', 'more', 'versatile', 'convinced', 'actually', 'took', 'time', 'consider', 'was', 'Darkman', 'disguise', 'so', 'different', 'was', 'demeanor', 'instances', 'growing', 'insanity', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Vosloo', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'role', 'concern', 'enemy', 'family', 'seemed', 'quite', 'genuine']",Darkman 3:Die Darkman Die VHS

I thought the story was good and so was the action the acting was not bad. the guy who played the villain was pretty good. but the series would of been much better if they kept liam neeson.

Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get.Oh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing. I really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made. But that was untill I saw reptillian.

399956,A1FD8LITJZE48V,6304081006,"Frank Ponce ""Movie Mavin""","[3, 4]","I'm a big fan of the Darkman character. The original was outstanding, with the great Liam Neeson as Darkman. DARKMAN 3 is shouldn't be compared to it, but it still has alot of action and a pretty good storyline.Arnold Vosloo, who took the helm of Darkman in the second film(I skipped that one), is no Liam Neeson, but is absolutely enjoyable as Darkman. I'm happy to know that the filmmakers did a good job by keeping the character the same. His emotions, frustration, and alienation are well done here.Jeff Fahey is gives an over-the-top performance as the bad guy Peter Rooker, whose evil plan is to gain powerful strength just like Darkman's. Fahey is sort of believable as a bad guy, but he overacts himself, even with a sadistic character like Rooker! But Vosloo is the savior here, who potrays a more humane Darkman in this entry. He does a good job at playing different emotions with the character.I'm not that surprised that the film was a direct-to-video, but was a good film nonetheless. I love the Darkman character, and I'm dissapointed there isn't very much of a fan following. I just wish another Darkman film was made, or a TV series, which is a even better idea, because the Darkman films are fantastic.",4,"Not better then the original, but still good",1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,1219,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Darkman', 'character', 'original', 'was', 'outstanding', 'great', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Darkman', 'DARKMAN', '3', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'still', 'alot', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline.Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'who', 'took', 'helm', 'Darkman', 'second', 'film', 'skipped', 'one', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'absolutely', 'enjoyable', 'Darkman', ""'m"", 'happy', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'character', 'same', 'emotions', 'frustration', 'alienation', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'here.Jeff', 'Fahey', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'bad', 'guy', 'Peter', 'Rooker', 'evil', 'plan', 'gain', 'powerful', 'strength', 'just', 'Darkman', 'Fahey', 'sort', 'believable', 'bad', 'guy', 'even', 'sadistic', 'character', 'Rooker', 'Vosloo', 'savior', 'here', 'who', 'more', 'humane', 'Darkman', 'entry', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'different', 'emotions', 'character.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'direct-to-video', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'love', 'Darkman', 'character', ""'m"", 'dissapointed', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'fan', 'following', 'just', 'wish', 'Darkman', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'even', 'better', 'idea', 'Darkman', 'films', 'are', 'fantastic']",Darkman 3:Die Darkman Die VHS
399957,A2XVRCU5DQBULH,6304081006,"L. Varnau ""nerff20""","[1, 2]","This second sequel to ""Darkman"" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about ""Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die,"" which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one.

Continuing in pretty much the same style as part 2, Darkman 3 gives us a new villain in the form of Jeff Fahey.  Fahey's into marketing steroids and he's a lousy husband and father.  Darkman's on hand to throw a wrench in his steroid operation.  But when Fahey captures Darkman(thus screwing him once again right when he's on the verge of perfecting his synthetic skin.  Man, this guy's always having the rug pulled out from under him at the last minute), he finds a way to make a super steroid from Darkman's blood, thus injecting his henchmen with the steroid and giving them Darkman's strength.  He plans to make big bucks with this neat new drug.  Darkman gets away and goes after Fahey, but along the way becomes infatuated with Fahey's wife and daughter who he feels sorry for since they are treated like dirt.  Darkman does what he does best by being master of disguise and sneaking around Fahey's operation.  One amusing scene has him wearing Fahey's face and searching his home for a computer disc and then finding himself in the middle of a surprise birthday party thrown for him.  Of course it all leads to the big confrontation with Fahey and his supergoons.  Typical, yet fun little action flick.  There's a little bit more of an attempt to go for Darkman's emotional side again, moreso than the last film.  Vosloo's not gonna get the academy's attention around Oscar time, but he's still suave and cool as all hell as Darkman.  Fahey makes for a rather sinister, soft spoken villain.  He's no Robert G Durant, but he's a mean SOB.  If you liked the style of the second film, then there's no reason you shouldn't find this entertaining.
