Yet this film is not just another journey story; but uniquely  different and probably so simple that one can easily miss the meaning because of all the details.  It says what it says including a sequence of unusual animations in the form of giant drawings of colorful birds with narration. That is just one of the ""different"" parts!Basically the story line involves a woman(Renee Zellwenger)  who, having been injured in an accident and now in a wheelchair, had to give up her baby son seven years hence, because she could no longer care for him.  This runs along side the antics and compassion of her schizophrenic and very supportive(He calls himself her 'bodyguard') friend.(Forest Whitaker)  Together and joined by two more (Nick Nolte in a wonderfully supporting part..alone worth the price of renting the DVD) in which  on a trip to attend a first communion, each one seeks resolution from  past taumatic wounds such as: the car accident; great losses, mental anquish and disease,  broken relationships, and even the economic depriving devestation wrought by a ghastly hurricane.",3,Liked it and didn't.,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,1109,"['had', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'journey', 'story', 'uniquely', 'different', 'probably', 'so', 'simple', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'miss', 'meaning', 'details', 'what', 'including', 'sequence', 'unusual', 'animations', 'form', 'giant', 'drawings', 'colorful', 'birds', 'narration', 'just', 'one', 'different', 'parts', 'Basically', 'story', 'line', 'woman', 'Renee', 'Zellwenger', 'who', 'having', 'been', 'injured', 'accident', 'now', 'wheelchair', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'baby', 'son', 'seven', 'years', 'hence', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'care', 'side', 'antics', 'compassion', 'schizophrenic', 'very', 'supportive', ""'bodyguard"", 'friend', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Together', 'joined', 'two', 'more', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'wonderfully', 'supporting', 'part..alone', 'price', 'renting', 'DVD', 'trip', 'attend', 'first', 'communion', 'one', 'resolution', 'past', 'taumatic', 'wounds', 'such', 'car', 'accident', 'great', 'losses', 'mental', 'anquish', 'disease', 'broken', 'relationships', 'even', 'economic', 'depriving', 'devestation', 'wrought', 'ghastly', 'hurricane']",N/A

1382721,A2L0S5G4T7VMNI,B0042BAV8Y,Christian Gal,"[6, 6]","I rented this movie for $2.00 from a Red Box because I love Renee Zellweger.  I had never heard of the movie, so I was surprised to see it for rent.  My sister and I love watching movies - both at the theater and at home. As I told my sister, ""this movie is a keeper!""This movie is odd, quirky, and musically haunting. It is a lovely story of how our lives can touch other lives in big and small ways. The reality of broken lives all around us is too true.  The times of hopelessness and loss are too true. And the possibility for anyone of us who have been desperately hurt physically, emotionally or mentally to find acceptance, healing and/or love from another person - even someone other people dismiss as ""crazy"" or too strange - is also real. This is the foundation of this story.The main characters are Jane, a white quadriplegic (Renee Zellweger) and Joey, a mentally unstable black man (Forest Whitaker). They are the unlikeliest of friends.  Jane is singer whose life is changed inexorably seven years earlier after a tragic accident kills her husband, leaves her wheelchair bound, and where she must give up her 3 yr old son for adoption because of being unable to care for him. She has not sung since. Joey has attached himself to Jane and helps to care for her some and is her only friend.  How they meet is characteristic of this movies depth. (I'll let you see it to understand.) Joey claims to see angels and speak to them, but of course no one else believes him - even Jane thinks he's ""mental"" about this claim.Joey finds out his favorite author is going to be in New Orleans doing a conference to ""sell"" his latest book. This best-selling author writes about talking to angels to gain wisdom - that angels are not only real, but want to speak to us.  Joey desperately wants to go see the author so he can be vindicated about his unique gift. So Joey begs Jane to go on a road trip with him.  Joey also finds a letter from Jane's now 10 year old son (a letter she had never opened) inviting ""Jane or Mommy Jane"" to come to his 1st official communion with the address located in Baton Rouge.  Joey decides he's going to take Jane to her son's communion, but doesn't tell Jane about this part of their trip, or even that he found the letter until he was forced into it at a critical part of their trip.The movie takes us with Jane and Joey where we witness how real life is sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes scary or just plain sad. While on this trip we meet other characters - some we love and some we don't. The movie uniquely explores how every person we encounter - long term or short term - can change us for the better if we are receptive.  The movie also shows how even from the most odd or unlikely of persons our own psyche can be healed and our understanding of ourselves can be expanded to give us the opportunity to stretch ourselves in new and good ways.  Life is challenging, and this movie looks at life from two extremely unlikely ""hero's"" experience and we come away feeling like we've been touched by a lovely gift.  By the way, Jane's (Renee Zellweger's) singing is incredibly moving and sweet. When Jane sings for the first time since her accident, she sings a well known but older patriotic song and it is REMARKABLY moving and heart-felt. Wow!Treat yourself - enjoy the people, experiences and the redemption that this movie offers.I loved this movie!",5,"The Good, The Bad & Healing",1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,3400,"['rented', 'movie', '2.00', 'Red', 'Box', 'love', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'rent', 'sister', 'love', 'watching', 'movies', 'theater', 'home', 'told', 'sister', 'movie', 'keeper', 'movie', 'odd', 'quirky', 'musically', 'haunting', 'lovely', 'story', 'how', 'lives', 'can', 'touch', 'other', 'lives', 'big', 'small', 'ways', 'reality', 'broken', 'lives', 'too', 'true', 'times', 'hopelessness', 'loss', 'are', 'too', 'true', 'possibility', 'anyone', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'desperately', 'hurt', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'find', 'acceptance', 'healing', 'and/or', 'love', 'person', 'even', 'someone', 'other', 'people', 'dismiss', 'crazy', 'too', 'strange', 'also', 'real', 'foundation', 'story.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Jane', 'white', 'quadriplegic', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Joey', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'black', 'man', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'are', 'unlikeliest', 'friends', 'Jane', 'singer', 'life', 'changed', 'inexorably', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'tragic', 'accident', 'husband', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'where', 'must', 'give', 'up', '3', 'yr', 'old', 'son', 'adoption', 'being', 'unable', 'care', 'not', 'sung', 'Joey', 'attached', 'Jane', 'care', 'only', 'friend', 'How', 'meet', 'characteristic', 'movies', 'depth', ""'ll"", 'let', 'see', 'understand', 'Joey', 'see', 'angels', 'speak', 'course', 'one', 'else', 'even', 'Jane', 'mental', 'claim.Joey', 'out', 'favorite', 'author', 'going', 'be', 'New', 'Orleans', 'doing', 'conference', 'sell', 'latest', 'book', 'best-selling', 'author', 'talking', 'angels', 'gain', 'wisdom', 'angels', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'want', 'speak', 'Joey', 'desperately', 'go', 'see', 'author', 'can', 'be', 'vindicated', 'unique', 'gift', 'So', 'Joey', 'begs', 'Jane', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'Joey', 'also', 'letter', 'Jane', 'now', '10', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'letter', 'had', 'never', 'opened', 'inviting', 'Jane', 'Mommy', 'Jane', 'come', '1st', 'official', 'communion', 'address', 'located', 'Baton', 'Rouge', 'Joey', 'going', 'take', 'Jane', 'son', 'communion', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Jane', 'part', 'trip', 'even', 'found', 'letter', 'was', 'forced', 'critical', 'part', 'trip.The', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Joey', 'where', 'witness', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'sometimes', 'good', 'sometimes', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'just', 'plain', 'sad', 'trip', 'meet', 'other', 'characters', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'movie', 'uniquely', 'how', 'person', 'encounter', 'long', 'term', 'short', 'term', 'can', 'change', 'better', 'are', 'receptive', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'even', 'most', 'odd', 'unlikely', 'persons', 'own', 'psyche', 'can', 'be', 'healed', 'understanding', 'ourselves', 'can', 'be', 'expanded', 'give', 'opportunity', 'stretch', 'ourselves', 'new', 'good', 'ways', 'Life', 'challenging', 'movie', 'life', 'two', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'experience', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'touched', 'lovely', 'gift', 'way', 'Jane', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'singing', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'sweet', 'When', 'Jane', 'sings', 'first', 'time', 'accident', 'well', 'known', 'older', 'patriotic', 'song', 'REMARKABLY', 'moving', 'heart-felt', 'Wow', 'Treat', 'enjoy', 'people', 'experiences', 'redemption', 'movie', 'loved', 'movie']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[5, 5]","I don't think this ""little"" film played many theatres when released in 2010 but it sure has GREAT credentials and star power. Just look: We have Academy Award Winners Renee Zellweger and Forest Whitaker in the key roles, Academy Award nominee (twice!) Nick Nolte (in a brief role similar to what Jeff Bridges has been doing lately) and it was directed by French Director Olivier Dahan (who won Academy Awards for the French film ""La Vie En Rose"" (the Edith Piaf story). Oh yes, did I forget to mention that it includes original songs and music by Bob Dylan???With all that said, the film is really a ""small quiet film"". It's the story of two ""friends"" - one the crippled Zellweger (who used to be a singers-songwriter - with a vinyl Lp to her name!) and Whitaker - who has some mental issues (and sees angels!) and cares for - and transports Zellweger They set out on a journey to attend her (now adopted) son's Communion in New Orleans. You've seen these films before and this has a good story line though you know where it will end. The thing that makes this film ""quirky""- and you'll find yourself saying ""what the heck?"" is that there is a small side story which involves the legendary blues singer Robert Johnson and his pact with the devil at the ""Crossroads"" in Mississippi and at another point, animated birds begin to appear for no reason.Those looking for Dylan's music will be frustrated as well. He sings seven songs on the soundtrack to move the action, but these are usually only one verse and a chorus, lasting less than a minute. The only full Dylan track is the nice ""Life is Home"" which he sings over the end credits. This is a Dylan song that Zellweger sings in a scene in the film. (She also sings Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land"" in a most unusual arrangement. Nolte plays guitar while Zellweger sings the Guthrie tune.So, if you are looking for something ""different"" - think ""Independent Film"", this is worth watching. I enjoyed all the acting performances. I'm still wondering about some of those ventures off the beaten track but it was 105 minutes I'm glad I spent. And, obviously, Zellweger, Whitaker, Nolte AND Dylan did this for more than just a ""paycheck"".The standard DVD - which I watched - has only the Trailer as a bonus.
