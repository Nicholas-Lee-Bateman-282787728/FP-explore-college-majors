1051458,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000MV9OB8,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[0, 0]","Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc, nor any extras.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.'Ever Since the World Ended' seems nearly equally spaced between its high and low points.  As a faux-documentary that looks back a decade later on a plague that decimated the world, the film primarily moves through interviews of the remaining 186 people alive in the city of San Francisco.  Though not succinctly stated, these people are on the cusp of leaving behind the old world and creating a new one, with the reasonable idea that some still cling to the familiar, and others are facing the difficult realities ahead of them.  This is a fascinating, thought-provoking concept, with boundless room for exploration.  The problem is that the people who have survived in this area, with few exceptions, all closely resemble the stereotype of San Franciscans as dreamy, elitist artists or liberal unitarians sitting around a campfire singing Kumbayah.  Surely people like that exist, but I don't buy that San Franscisco is so completely overwhelmed with this type that if a random sample of 186 people were selected, this demographic would be the only one from which to draw.But, perhaps I'm wrong.  Maybe, for this particular area of the country, the film is more or less accurate in depicting the makeup of the survivors.  If so, I wouldn't bet much on them lasting another ten years - not without serious changes to their outlook.  One of the films strong points is amply illustrating how, with the exception of one man, none of the people who were accustomed to the old world were able to let it go, preferring to retain as much of the trappings of the society that spawned them as possible.  By feeding of the remains of civilization, they are able to continue the illusion of that society, and to avoid looking at what happens when the carcass of San Franscisco is no longer able to support them.Because the film has such a lop-sided representation of the survivor's cultural outlook, I suspect a large part of whether or not it appeals to someone is how much they identify with the people onscreen.  White, upscale, liberally tolerant folks with a relaxed attitude toward the world might really dig it.  Few others are represented, so it seems as though there would be less attraction for them.  In the end, the faux-documentarians themselves are unable to draw any conclusions from the footage they've taken, and instead leave it to speak for itself.  As a projection of what the world might look like given the film's parameters, it does make some interesting observations, and also provokes speculation in the viewer.  Yet ultimately what the footage suggested to me was that this particular group were unsuited for long-term survival due to their utter inability to discard the conventions of the past when dealing with the challenges of (their) present.  If I thought that was the filmmaker's objective, I would have given it higher marks - but I don't.  Rather I think they were enamored with the illusion that something viable could still come out of this society, that it would still be able to remake the world in the manner they would like for it to be.  Maybe - but it seems to me that the words and actions of a young teen, too young to remember the way things were, indicate better that their new world would be predicated along more primal lines.  That means that 'Ever Since the World Ended' is a bit of a misnomer - twelve years after the plague, the world is still ending, kept alive by the memories of those who won't let it go.",3,"Interesting, yet culturally lop-sided",1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,3664,"['Disclaimer', 'viewed', 'film', 'streaming', 'rental', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'disc', 'extras', 'review', 'concerned', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only', 'World', 'Ended', 'nearly', 'equally', 'spaced', 'high', 'low', 'points', 'faux-documentary', 'back', 'decade', 'later', 'plague', 'decimated', 'world', 'film', 'primarily', 'interviews', 'remaining', '186', 'people', 'alive', 'city', 'San', 'Francisco', 'not', 'succinctly', 'stated', 'people', 'are', 'cusp', 'leaving', 'old', 'world', 'creating', 'new', 'one', 'reasonable', 'idea', 'still', 'cling', 'familiar', 'others', 'are', 'facing', 'difficult', 'realities', 'ahead', 'fascinating', 'thought-provoking', 'concept', 'boundless', 'room', 'exploration', 'problem', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'survived', 'area', 'few', 'exceptions', 'closely', 'resemble', 'stereotype', 'San', 'Franciscans', 'dreamy', 'elitist', 'artists', 'liberal', 'unitarians', 'sitting', 'campfire', 'singing', 'Kumbayah', 'Surely', 'people', 'exist', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'San', 'Franscisco', 'so', 'completely', 'overwhelmed', 'type', 'random', 'sample', '186', 'people', 'were', 'selected', 'demographic', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'draw.But', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'Maybe', 'particular', 'area', 'country', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'accurate', 'depicting', 'makeup', 'survivors', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'bet', 'much', 'lasting', 'ten', 'years', 'not', 'serious', 'changes', 'outlook', 'One', 'films', 'strong', 'points', 'amply', 'illustrating', 'how', 'exception', 'one', 'man', 'none', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'accustomed', 'old', 'world', 'were', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'preferring', 'retain', 'much', 'trappings', 'society', 'spawned', 'possible', 'feeding', 'remains', 'civilization', 'are', 'able', 'continue', 'illusion', 'society', 'avoid', 'looking', 'what', 'when', 'carcass', 'San', 'Franscisco', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'support', 'film', 'lop-sided', 'representation', 'survivor', 'cultural', 'outlook', 'suspect', 'large', 'part', 'not', 'appeals', 'someone', 'how', 'much', 'identify', 'people', 'onscreen', 'White', 'upscale', 'liberally', 'tolerant', 'folks', 'relaxed', 'attitude', 'world', 'might', 'really', 'dig', 'Few', 'others', 'are', 'represented', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'attraction', 'end', 'faux-documentarians', 'are', 'unable', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'instead', 'leave', 'speak', 'projection', 'what', 'world', 'might', 'look', 'given', 'film', 'parameters', 'make', 'interesting', 'observations', 'also', 'provokes', 'speculation', 'viewer', 'ultimately', 'what', 'footage', 'suggested', 'was', 'particular', 'group', 'were', 'unsuited', 'long-term', 'survival', 'due', 'utter', 'inability', 'discard', 'conventions', 'past', 'when', 'dealing', 'challenges', 'present', 'thought', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'objective', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'higher', 'marks', 'do', ""n't"", 'Rather', 'think', 'were', 'enamored', 'illusion', 'something', 'viable', 'could', 'still', 'come', 'society', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'remake', 'world', 'manner', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'Maybe', 'words', 'actions', 'young', 'teen', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'indicate', 'better', 'new', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'predicated', 'more', 'primal', 'lines', 'World', 'Ended', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'twelve', 'years', 'plague', 'world', 'still', 'ending', 'kept', 'alive', 'memories', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go']",Ever Since the World Ended
1051459,A2Y2AOCBKWV0FC,B000MV9OB8,Carlo Barlo,"[0, 1]","I just watched this film and enjoyed it. It is the story of a documentary made by the survivors of a flu pandemic that has wiped out most of the worlds population, leaving small sparse groups of survivors. I do agree that some of it is far fetched, and there are a few holes here and there in the story. But what it does well is convey the feel of living in this situation. IE a VERY few people have survived, and they have whats left of the world to themselves. I almost felt like they were living in a far better world than the one that had fallen. Nature was recovering. There was peace and solitude for the people who did survive. Yes, there were a few crazies and it was still dangerous. But then you see them fishing, and imagine the fresh air and the quiet. This is a post apocalyptic world you might not mind having a go in. I do have a feeling that the end of the world would lean more towards this image than mad Max, because the really violent people would kill each other off within a few years and the peaceful more civilized groups with community skills would have more staying power. I do agree that it was a prettier picture than reality would be, ie no burned cars, dead bodies everywhere, etc. But all in all a decent attempt to get into the minds of the survivors. A worthy effort.

This movie focuses on them, but it does it in a way that it makes it seem like it really happened.  This movie is made to be a homemade documentwry filmed by future reporters who want to make a name for themselves by explaining what happened, interviewing people, and saying what life is like now.

This is a very simple film about people like most of us who have survived after an epidemic has decimated the human population.  The focus is on a small community in San Francisco of about 200 survivors and the situations they face as well as the pain of their loss.  I think it has some good points such as how the group has to deal with a potentially dangerous mentally unstable member of their society.  It also shows how the children who didn't know or don't remember the old world have a different view of life and the world.  It's not a groundbreaking film but it's not garbage as so many reviewers seem to have dubbed it.  It reminds me of a student film, very earnest and heartfelt yet never really grabbing you.

1051464,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000MV9OB8,Jason,"[2, 3]","Simply put, this movie is simple.  It's a faux-documentary of several post-apocalyptic San Franciscans who meander through their attempt to make sense of it all on film.First and foremost, there is nearly no description of how the world got to its current horrid state.  The only thing known is that there was a massive plague of some kind.  There's no development, no description, and there is no reasoning why the people still alive weren't affected, which is especially irritating when considering the fact that one of the initial reviews is with someone in the medical field.  It's an absolute must to really becoming interested in this sort of movie.The rest of the movie is somewhat difficult to stomach.  The whole environment is pristine, without as much as a pile of flaming trash in site.  It's a wonder how all the people in the movie aren't dying of dehydration and starvation considering all the work they must put in to clean up the entire city.  I guess it's easy considering all 186 people left in S.F. are all knowledgeable, educated, and actively in search of some sort of Zen-like existence amongst their fellow survivors.  Except of course that one arsonist who was added as a weak attempt at interpersonal tension or a decayed sense of a community's attempts of policing their own.  And those people in the woods, whatever they're all about other than getting away from everyone else.I have no problem with the positive outlook on life, the attempted utopia in a dystopian future, but there has to be some believability to be enticing.  The social gatherings and educational opportunities are completely unrealistic if amongst the last couple hundred survivors.

1051465,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000MV9OB8,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[3, 6]","The premise of EVER SINCE THE WORLD ENDED is one that has been done many times before, but here directors Cal and Josh try something new that works for the first half but quickly bogs down in areas that frankly grate on a viewer's intelligence.  A virus of near total lethality has swept the United States, killing hundreds of millions.  We see none of this.  What we do see are the after effects some twelve years later.  Cal and Josh are residents of San Francisco and they travel the city with a makeshift video camera, interviewing as many of the 186 survivors as they can. Their brief interviews form the film proper, which like a Shakesperean play within a play, is always two steps removed from the external world of the viewer. I have no problem with this concept, which in its own way is quite daring.  The major issues that do not ring true even in a cinematic sense are the ones that create the false reality of the filmmakers who seem determined to shrink the pre-plague years of a liberal leftist pot smoking San Francisco into a montage of scenes that suggest that the hip, ultra-liberal lifestyle of youngish ex-stock traders is quite sufficient to form the basis of a viable society that is as neatly ordered as if nothing of consequence has happened at all.  Except for a few thrown in scenes of some seriously disturbed individuals, everyone concerned is cultured, fit, well nourished and dressed, and possessed of a mental equilibrium that is rock solid. Nowhere does there exist any Mad Max motorcycle thugs wreaking havoc on the few peaceful remnants of society. Nowhere is there even a hint of the ravages of time that a lack of human beings will impact on the environment.  The recent hit television cable show LIFE WITHOUT PEOPLE creates a far different world minus people.  Within days, the environment would suffer noticeable degradation.  Certainly after twelve years, a major city like San Francisco would evidence an explosion of animals roaming the streets, collapsing buildings, and mosses and vines infiltrating ubiquitously.  Yet, this San Francisco is as well maintained as if an invisible army of garbage collectors and architects were working discretely overtime to maintain the clean lifetstyle that liberal urbanites insist is the inevitable accompaniment of those who demand latte coffees as they drive to the polls to vote for Barack Obama. There is even an incredulous scene in which an ultra-liberal female is debating the merits of having a child minus the presence of the biological father. In short, EVER SINCE THE WORKD ENDED is a left wing fantasy that defends a lifestyle that even God would find both politically correct and eminently desirable.

1051466,ARHQDLVS64GR5,B000MV9OB8,Matthew,"[2, 6]","This movie is very interesting to watch, and the characters bring a nice glimpse into the changed world, although some tend to sometimes sound as if they were in a Sociology discussion group in a coffee shop.  The makers of this film appear to have done their homework in that there is a good attention to detail of how the characters would probably be living after such an event.  It is worth watching for those, like myself, who are fans of the post-apocalyptic genre. Another minor drawback is that a small few of the characters, especially those who were existing in a less civilized manner, appeared to be very clean-shaven and not too far removed from a barber shop. Overall the film is definitely worth a watch.",4,A very interesting documentary style look at a post-apocalyptic world,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,718,"['movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'characters', 'bring', 'nice', 'glimpse', 'changed', 'world', 'tend', 'sometimes', 'sound', 'were', 'Sociology', 'discussion', 'group', 'coffee', 'shop', 'makers', 'film', 'appear', 'have', 'done', 'homework', 'good', 'attention', 'detail', 'how', 'characters', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'living', 'such', 'event', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'post-apocalyptic', 'genre', 'minor', 'drawback', 'small', 'few', 'characters', 'especially', 'who', 'were', 'existing', 'less', 'civilized', 'manner', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'clean-shaven', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'barber', 'shop', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch']",Ever Since the World Ended

1051468,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B000MV9OB8,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[0, 0]","Ever Since the World ended is a fictional, video-diary/documentary set in post-apocalyptic San Francisco.  A plague, (possibly of government origin), diminished massively the population, leaving this particular city with a mere 186 people.  The film peruses a handful of this collective through interviews and group conversations.Reading the description of this film, I had hoped that I'd catch some underrated gem chronicling the interior of human psych following a devastation of this magnitude.  Most stories in the Aftermath genre typically focus on thrashing horrors and unbelievably escalated confrontations.  I'm tired of these scenarios, so I turned my attention to this project hoping the doc-angle would add some much needed, basic realism.  I wanted to see inner workings in the inevitable government that will bloom during any drastic shift in the human condition.  I wanted to see reproduction, society, and a technological renaissance.  I wanted accuracy.Moral of this story: be careful what you wish for.The film started off strongly enough, I'll give it that.  I sat shotgun with a Fat Tire warming in hand while my host introduced his intentions and a small group of surrounding characters.  It was during this intro that I fell in love with the movie because it was discovered that Adam Savage rode out the Apocalypse.  Adam Savage.  Who wouldn't want him on board a sinking ship?  Nobody, that's who.Sadly though, my admiration proved a dying flame that even Adam couldn't re-kindle.While the acting wasn't bad, I only rarely found myself submerged in the performances.  Something inhibited me from doing so consistently, and it took me some time to sort it out, but I think the problem was that the actors seemed so similar.  I realize that they're all from the same city and have spent a considerable amount of time together, but that's not the problem.  To me, it seemed the actors were friends before the filming began and weren't completely capable of breaking their mold.I'll avoid rambling through specifics from here out and just advise that the movie never really left the ground for me.  Again, I ended up getting what I asked for, but discovered that that's not what I needed.  Peaks were present, but they felt forced and anti-climactic.  The goings-on of the community left me decidedly bored as did their small, unfortunate pilgrimage outside the city limits.In essence, this was just another day in dead San Francisco and it left me wanting.- t -",2,"Hey, at least one Mythbuster survived.",1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,2480,"['Ever', 'World', 'ended', 'fictional', 'video-diary/documentary', 'set', 'post-apocalyptic', 'San', 'Francisco', 'A', 'plague', 'possibly', 'government', 'origin', 'diminished', 'massively', 'population', 'leaving', 'particular', 'city', 'mere', '186', 'people', 'film', 'handful', 'collective', 'interviews', 'group', 'conversations.Reading', 'description', 'film', 'had', 'hoped', ""'d"", 'catch', 'underrated', 'gem', 'chronicling', 'interior', 'human', 'psych', 'following', 'devastation', 'magnitude', 'Most', 'stories', 'Aftermath', 'genre', 'typically', 'focus', 'thrashing', 'horrors', 'unbelievably', 'escalated', 'confrontations', ""'m"", 'tired', 'scenarios', 'turned', 'attention', 'project', 'hoping', 'doc-angle', 'would', 'add', 'much', 'needed', 'basic', 'realism', 'wanted', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'inevitable', 'government', 'will', 'bloom', 'drastic', 'shift', 'human', 'condition', 'wanted', 'see', 'reproduction', 'society', 'technological', 'renaissance', 'wanted', 'accuracy.Moral', 'story', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'for.The', 'film', 'started', 'off', 'strongly', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'give', 'sat', 'shotgun', 'Fat', 'Tire', 'warming', 'hand', 'host', 'introduced', 'intentions', 'small', 'group', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'was', 'intro', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'discovered', 'Adam', 'Savage', 'rode', 'out', 'Apocalypse', 'Adam', 'Savage', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'board', 'sinking', 'ship', 'Nobody', 'who.Sadly', 'admiration', 'proved', 'dying', 'flame', 'even', 'Adam', 'could', ""n't"", 're-kindle.While', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'only', 'rarely', 'found', 'submerged', 'performances', 'Something', 'inhibited', 'doing', 'so', 'consistently', 'took', 'time', 'sort', 'out', 'think', 'problem', 'was', 'actors', 'seemed', 'so', 'similar', 'realize', ""'re"", 'same', 'city', 'have', 'spent', 'considerable', 'amount', 'time', 'together', 'not', 'problem', 'seemed', 'actors', 'were', 'friends', 'filming', 'began', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'capable', 'breaking', 'mold.I', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'rambling', 'specifics', 'here', 'just', 'advise', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'left', 'ground', 'Again', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'what', 'asked', 'discovered', 'not', 'what', 'needed', 'Peaks', 'were', 'present', 'felt', 'forced', 'anti-climactic', 'goings-on', 'community', 'left', 'decidedly', 'bored', 'did', 'small', 'unfortunate', 'pilgrimage', 'city', 'limits.In', 'essence', 'was', 'just', 'day', 'dead', 'San', 'Francisco', 'left', 'wanting.-', 't']",Ever Since the World Ended
