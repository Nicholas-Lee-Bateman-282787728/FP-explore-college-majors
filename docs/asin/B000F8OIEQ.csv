985636,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000F8OIEQ,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 7]","Taped in 2005 surprises me, because I really like Henry Cho when I first saw him in the 90s.  But with this DVD comic show, I was disappointed.  Yes, he is slow paced, and I accept that, but there is very little entertaining humor.The comic act was lacking fresh material!  We have long heard about the marriage jokes, the pregnancy and kid stuff.  That has been hashed about for years and years.  What he brought was nothing fresh.  The in-law family humor was unoriginal and unfunny, been there, done that, heard that!! In other words, if the inlaws aren't worthy of exciting funny material,.... can 'em.Along with the slow pace, the structure of the act lacked interest.  Too often, he uses filler talk, you know, the repetition of phrases just to fill time.  This makes the act slower and less interesting.  Every word a comedian says, should be important, if not, use filler time.The audience was lackluster over the performance.  But I guess if you have a bunch of Tennesseans, this might be for suitable for them.  Otherwise, this slow-paced, unoriginal marital, family-type humor would not fly elsewhere.As much as I wanted to hear Henry Cho, this was a downer!  ....Rizzo",2,"Unfortunately it is slow, not enough humor, lacks refreshing material.",1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,1180,"['Taped', '2005', 'surprises', 'really', 'Henry', 'Cho', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '90s', 'DVD', 'comic', 'show', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Yes', 'slow', 'paced', 'accept', 'very', 'little', 'entertaining', 'humor.The', 'comic', 'act', 'was', 'lacking', 'fresh', 'material', 'have', 'long', 'heard', 'marriage', 'jokes', 'pregnancy', 'kid', 'stuff', 'been', 'hashed', 'years', 'years', 'What', 'brought', 'was', 'nothing', 'fresh', 'in-law', 'family', 'humor', 'was', 'unoriginal', 'unfunny', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'heard', 'other', 'words', 'inlaws', 'are', ""n't"", 'worthy', 'exciting', 'funny', 'material', 'can', ""'em.Along"", 'slow', 'pace', 'structure', 'act', 'lacked', 'interest', 'Too', 'often', 'filler', 'talk', 'know', 'repetition', 'phrases', 'just', 'fill', 'time', 'act', 'slower', 'less', 'interesting', 'Every', 'word', 'comedian', 'should', 'be', 'important', 'not', 'use', 'filler', 'time.The', 'audience', 'was', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'guess', 'have', 'bunch', 'Tennesseans', 'might', 'be', 'suitable', 'Otherwise', 'slow-paced', 'unoriginal', 'marital', 'family-type', 'humor', 'would', 'not', 'fly', 'elsewhere.As', 'much', 'wanted', 'hear', 'Henry', 'Cho', 'was', 'downer', '.Rizzo']",Henry Cho: What's That Clickin' Noise?

The fact that it is clean enough to play for any group just adds to the appeal of it.
