The conversation between mother and son coming toward the end provided the breakthrough that seemed impossible.  Both gained insight into how their attitudes and aspects, intentional and otherwise, had affected family members and broken the union.  It's a Christmas reconciliation picture, of which there are many, but I think this is one of the very best.  Interesting as it progresses, very attractively done, so moving.  Don't worry, you won't need a tissue until the very end, and then just a dab or two, mostly of joy.  But it kind of lays on your heart for a bit, in a positive way.  After Ms. Young, Trevor Howard was my favorite and then Arthur Hill.  It was all around well supported.

866740,A3RUMI4Y58S59,B0006FUHYS,Heaven's Hound,"[1, 1]","I've been looking for a DVD of Christmas Eve, with Loretta Young and Trevor Howard for years.  I recall the fist time it was aired on TV.  I was riveted to the screen, primarly to see what Loretta Young looked like after an absence of 24 years from TV.  She was true to her legend, still a beauty and still a fine actress.  She gave a moving performance of a wealthy matriarch, trying to bring her scattered family together again on Christmas.  The message is loud and clear:  family is everything and forgiveness of past wrongs is a must.  The film reflects L. Young's values, and I bet she probably had wished she had in real life been a better mother.  She made some bigtime mistakes with raising her kids, especially her daughter Judy Lewis, who was the illegitimate daughter Loretta had with Clark Gable.  But all that aside, the film is a delight, the performance, one of his last, of Trevor Howard was so touching. To see two old pros like Young and Howard together, both  likely knowing this film might be their last, makes this wonderful Christmas film even more poignant.  And Liebman's performance too was terrific.  Those weren't fake tears, something in the script must have moved, him and he wept naturally.  In fact, if you can maintain a dry eye at the end of this heartrending movie, well, I'd be very surprised.  Loretta Young is a legend of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and whether you like her or not, she made three superb Christmas films: Come to the Stable, The Bishop's Wife and Christmas Eve.  Every Christmas I try to see all three on TV, but they unfortunately aren't always on. So I will still keep looking for a good DVD of Christmas Eve.  One last note, on receiving her Golden Globe, Loretta delivered such a warm and loving acceptance speech.  The camera zoomed in on Anne Bankcroft, and the delight shown on her face for Loretta's victory, is wonderful to behold (she died shortly afterwards).  Anne B's generation knew well Loretta, but today's generation don't know much about America's great film past.  I guess it's to be expected.  To be candid, I don't know half of today's new stars.  On the other hand are they stars?  A real star possesses mystery.  I don't see much of that today.  How can you maintain mystery if you appear on every talk show on TV?",5,A Deserved Golden Globe for Loretta Young!,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,2293,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'years', 'recall', 'fist', 'time', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'primarly', 'see', 'what', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'looked', 'absence', '24', 'years', 'TV', 'was', 'true', 'legend', 'still', 'beauty', 'still', 'fine', 'actress', 'gave', 'moving', 'performance', 'wealthy', 'matriarch', 'trying', 'bring', 'scattered', 'family', 'together', 'again', 'Christmas', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'family', 'everything', 'forgiveness', 'past', 'wrongs', 'must', 'film', 'L.', 'Young', 'values', 'bet', 'probably', 'had', 'wished', 'had', 'real', 'life', 'been', 'better', 'mother', 'made', 'bigtime', 'mistakes', 'raising', 'kids', 'especially', 'daughter', 'Judy', 'Lewis', 'who', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'Loretta', 'had', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'aside', 'film', 'delight', 'performance', 'one', 'last', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'see', 'two', 'old', 'pros', 'Young', 'Howard', 'together', 'likely', 'knowing', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'poignant', 'Liebman', 'performance', 'too', 'was', 'terrific', 'were', ""n't"", 'fake', 'tears', 'something', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'moved', 'wept', 'naturally', 'fact', 'can', 'maintain', 'dry', 'eye', 'end', 'heartrending', 'movie', 'well', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'surprised', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'legend', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'made', 'three', 'superb', 'Christmas', 'films', 'Come', 'Stable', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Every', 'Christmas', 'try', 'see', 'three', 'TV', 'unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'will', 'still', 'keep', 'looking', 'good', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'One', 'last', 'note', 'receiving', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Loretta', 'delivered', 'warm', 'loving', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'camera', 'zoomed', 'Anne', 'Bankcroft', 'delight', 'shown', 'face', 'Loretta', 'victory', 'wonderful', 'behold', 'died', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'Anne', 'B', 'generation', 'knew', 'well', 'Loretta', 'today', 'generation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'America', 'great', 'film', 'guess', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'candid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'half', 'today', 'new', 'stars', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'stars', 'real', 'star', 'possesses', 'mystery', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'today', 'How', 'can', 'maintain', 'mystery', 'appear', 'talk', 'show', 'TV']",N/A

While both movies are good, I actually favor the 1986 made for TV version. There is a warmth that is palpable between the actors -- and the cast is impressive -- Loretta Young, Arthur Hill, Trevor Howard, etc. This is what a Christmas Movie should be -- heartwarming, family oriented, and a reminder that Christmas is about love, not gifts. The story contains just the right amount of tension to to keep it from being light-weight, it has substance, and yet, there is enough genuine tenderness that I am brought to tears at the end of the film, without fail, just like I am with It's a Wonderful Life.It is unfortunate that this made for TV movie has never been released on DVD.

I did have it on VHS, but it was lacking the fade in and out to drawings at the beginning of a segment and at the end of a segment. Thankfully someone released this title overseas and now I finally have it again!!!!  It was only ever shown on TV so I guess that is why it is so rare.  Loretta Young is superb as the matriarch who will not stop giving to those that are in need. This is her first film in like 23 years or something according to the DVD trivia page!!! Ron Leibman is excellent as the private investigator who will stop at nothing to find her grandchildren. He is as stubborn in locating them as she is determined that they will show up for Christmas.
