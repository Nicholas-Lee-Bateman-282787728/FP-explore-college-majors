This is a sequel to Flowers in the Attic which had a movie made of it in the 80s, but the way they ended it left no possibility for the movie sequel. Lifetime remade Flowers in  the Attic last year and stayed true to the book ending so they could make this sequel. It was great to finally see it made into a movie! There are a few graphic sex scenes, so this isn't a movie to watch with the family. They recast ed the siblings in this one since they had aged 10 years and because of the more mature content. The acting is &#34;tv acting&#34;, so don't expect &#34;Oscar worthy&#34; performances. But if you liked the book series, you will like this movie.

Also, I have to say this movie took the incest story arch from Flowers in the Attic and multiplied it by 10. At times I was surprised by the amount of sex it has in it for a lifetime movie. There was a scene in which Heather Graham confronts her husband while he's shaving that had me do a double take because I could not believe what I was seeing.

As much as it could be.I understand that producers try to make the best version into a movie by crowding as much of the book's important details so that the viewer can understand the concept.The acting was good. Not really great but fairly reasonable. The most talented actor was hardly shown which would be Ellen Burstyn . These were young actors on their way up and they were good. Can't take away from them their talent.Some of the parts were almost comical because as I said , they were crammed to close together and caused a little humor in that regard. But , take my word for it,. The book is better. More exciting and you cannot sense the confusion the kids had after getting away from their Grandmothers attic. In the movie they just show that their incestuous desires just  suddenly happened.

1697267,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00KFNF17E,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 17]","4 Stars for Lovers of Bad Movies or Fans of The Books2 Stars for Everyone ElseEarlier this year, the Lifetime network premiered a new interpretation of the 1979 cult novel ""Flowers in the Attic"" by V.C. Andrews featuring Heather Graham, Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka, and the incomparable Ellen Burstyn. While I appreciated that this adaptation tried to stay truer to the source novel than the previous film version, it lacked a bit of suspense for my taste. Aside from Burstyn, the entire production was missing a bite and energy which left a certain blandness in its wake. Maybe they tried to be too reverent to the plotting and lost track of how the piece should make you feel (unsettled and uncomfortable). For good or bad, Lifetime has committed to bringing the novel's sequels to the air as well. I think it's fair to say that ""Petals on the Wind"" is not a particularly good movie, but at least it's a lot more lunatic fun than its predecessor. As the movie zips along with cartoon villainy, elaborate revenge schemes, and a truly Gothic horror finale, I found the movie entirely entertaining if you can embrace its bad movie mojo.""Petals on the Wind"" picks up ten years later than the events of the previous movie. Cathy, Christopher and Carrie are still haunted by their days in the attic. Cathy (now played by Rose McIver) is an aspiring ballerina, Christopher (Wyatt Nash) is a medical student, and Carrie (Bailey Buntain) is a tormented high school student. Their adopted father and benefactor has recently died, and they face a brave new world as adults. As they struggle with their new destiny, the life they left behind is never far from memory. As both of the older siblings attempt grown-up relationships (while struggling with the lingering attraction for one another), the screenplay races through a number of twists and turns. Cathy's trip to New York to be a prima ballerina, for example, is so rushed as to be almost laughable. Strangely enough, though, that is part of the movie's charm. At the shocking end of this particular storyline (on the opening night of a rather lackluster Romeo and Juliet), I simply had to laugh out loud. It was all so spectacularly silly, but I don't want to spoil any of its pleasures.Of course, what we are all waiting for is the final showdown between mother and children. Graham spends the entire movie renovating the family home while Burstyn is mostly absent (and, sadly, she is missed). After some more plotting and machinations, the kids force a confrontation at an elaborate party that embraces a delightful lunacy that I loved. As I mentioned, ""Petals on the Wind"" is never particularly good (the performances and dialogue can be stilted and painful) but it is loopy enough to be enjoyable. Burstyn shines in her brief appearance and even the wooden Heather Graham has some nice moments at the end. I credit this adaptation for just going for it and embracing its madness. I laughed along with ""Petals on the Wind"" and, for me, that was enough. I didn't find it shocking or moving, I found it spirited, somewhat twisted, and a lot of fun.

The whole &#34;incest&#34; thing is enough to gag a maggot,  however,  it truly makes you feel anger for these characters.  The only real &#34;good guy&#34; in this film,  is the Grandmother.

The film picks up a few years later. Our children managed to survive until Dr. Paul Sheffield adopted them. The incestuous siblings pick up where they left off. Cathy (Rose McIver) leaves for NY for ballet. Christopher (Wyatt Nash) is following is adopted father in the medical field and young Carrie (Bailey Buntain) has trouble adapting socially to high school and the world in general.Christopher gets a girlfriend and plans to get married, while Cathy is pregnant with a child she claims is her ballet boy friend, but who knows. Mom (Heather Graham) makes it back into the film during the second half.I was scratching my head at the disjointed script and soap opera type drama. Wyatt Nash reminded me of Casper Van Dien and not in a good way. The plot twisted in ways I was not prepared for, i.e. the character has not really been established, especially Cathy who ranged from sweet innocent to demonic devious. The sexual curiosity of Carrie was done awkwardly if not unintentionally comical.  The bizarreness of the film, kept me watching, like a train wreak. Please don't make another one because I will watch it. I haven't read the book, but it has to be better.Rated TV-14 for theme and implied sex. Several scenes of clothes being removed and passionate kissing.  Rose McIver in bra.",4,WE CAN'T BECOME OUR PARENTS,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,1381,"['Lifetime', 'sequel', '34', 'Flowers', 'Attic', '34', 'left', 'speechless', 'film', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'children', 'managed', 'survive', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Sheffield', 'adopted', 'incestuous', 'siblings', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Cathy', 'Rose', 'McIver', 'NY', 'ballet', 'Christopher', 'Wyatt', 'Nash', 'following', 'adopted', 'father', 'medical', 'field', 'young', 'Carrie', 'Bailey', 'Buntain', 'trouble', 'adapting', 'socially', 'high', 'school', 'world', 'general.Christopher', 'girlfriend', 'plans', 'get', 'married', 'Cathy', 'pregnant', 'child', 'ballet', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'Mom', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'back', 'film', 'second', 'half.I', 'was', 'scratching', 'head', 'disjointed', 'script', 'soap', 'opera', 'type', 'drama', 'Wyatt', 'Nash', 'reminded', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'plot', 'twisted', 'ways', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'i.e', 'character', 'not', 'really', 'been', 'established', 'especially', 'Cathy', 'who', 'ranged', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'demonic', 'devious', 'sexual', 'curiosity', 'Carrie', 'was', 'done', 'awkwardly', 'not', 'unintentionally', 'comical', 'bizarreness', 'film', 'kept', 'watching', 'train', 'wreak', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'be', 'better.Rated', 'TV-14', 'theme', 'implied', 'sex', 'Several', 'scenes', 'clothes', 'being', 'removed', 'passionate', 'kissing', 'Rose', 'McIver', 'bra']",Petals On The Wind Digital

Even though it's been quite a few years since I read the Flowers in the Attic series, I'm still pretty sure that more than half of what happened in this film did not occur in the books. This was beyond cheesy and badly acted(Heather Graham anyone?). I had zero expectations going into this and after the not much better Flowers in the Attic, I didn't think it could get worse. I watched this because of boredom and a stupid sense of obligation. There hasn't been an adaptation of Petals on the Wind before so I gave it a chance.I wouldn't even call this a guilty pleasure. It's just plain bad. Ellen Burstyne is the only slightly redeemable part of this but her role is minuscule and not worth it in the end. Just stick to re-reading the books and not sullying those memories...",1,Pretty terrible,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,868,"['V.C', 'Andrews', 'fan', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'appalled', 'how', 'awful', ""'adaptation"", 'was', 'Even', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'read', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'series', ""'m"", 'still', 'pretty', 'sure', 'more', 'half', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'books', 'was', 'cheesy', 'badly', 'acted', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'anyone', 'had', 'zero', 'expectations', 'going', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'get', 'worse', 'watched', 'boredom', 'stupid', 'sense', 'obligation', ""n't"", 'been', 'adaptation', 'Petals', 'Wind', 'so', 'gave', 'chance.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Ellen', 'Burstyne', 'only', 'slightly', 'redeemable', 'part', 'role', 'minuscule', 'not', 'worth', 'end', 'Just', 'stick', 're-reading', 'books', 'not', 'sullying', 'memories']",Petals On The Wind Digital
