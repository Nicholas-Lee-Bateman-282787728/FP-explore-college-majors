1463937,A3LXAXRICA0XW6,B005KR6NNG,~Chase,"[45, 63]","I am a big Tyler Perry fan, I really enjoy watching his plays and movies, but Tyler Perry is getting very redundant. This play is a great joy to watch. Me and my dad watched it and we both loved it, but it still misses some of the key characteristics he had in his first 3 or 4 plays, and has to much of stuff he doesn't need. Every play Tyler Perry brings out he starts to cuss more and more. At first he just said ""hell"", with a few marijuana references here and there. As he produces more and more, he say's ""ass"" 20 times, ""damn"" 4-5 times....borderlines blasphemy in my opinion in some cases, and every play there is a marijuana reference, EVERY PLAY! Like c'mon Tyler, it was funny at first, but do something different. Not every character has to have a marijuana hobby.This play is more about Tyler Perry (Madea) than anybody. Of course, we ALL LOVE MADEA! She is so awesome and funny, but lately when there is a play with Madea, its ALL ABOUT MADEA! There is so much talent on the stage, yet Madea is the only one talking 90% of the time. Telling moral stories and how to live life. Let someone else give those words of wisdom. Only time there are actually serious moments in the play, is when Tyler Perry is not on stage. The play is very funny without Madea a lot of times. Or when the characters are trying portray a serious situation, Madea is just ad-libbing the entire time, pulling you out of the story seriousness. I truly want Tyler Perry to keep doing work and making plays and movies. However, variety is key. Not the same old concept of black people doing bad. Not to mention the movies, those have really been bad lately.. Madeas Big Happy Family movie is IDENTICAL to the play, no new jokes, same EVERYTHING! I really do not understand why make a movie into a play, but not change a darn thing about it....Money maybe? But you don't want me to bootleg..? But you want to make 2 shows the exact same way to just make more money???....right.There is another play coming out called ""The haves and the have nots"", it is currently on tour, yet, the title alone is basically the same story of this ""Christmas"" play....Cmon now...I'm getting off track here, I just really want the old Tyler Perry to start making great stories again, with an intriguing story line. Cut out all the excess fat and garbage. This is overall a good play, it is a GREAT play if you are not familiar with Tyler Perry plays. For older fans, it's just another money maker, that will turn into a movie.BLU-RAY -It was amazing to see this play on Blu-Ray, I wish he would go back and reformat the older plays and make them High Def. The sound and visual of the play, is VERY detailed. You can see everything on the set so smoothly, the colors are so vibrant. I was literally blown away with the video quality of this play on Blu-Ray. I'm going to have to snag ""Madeas Big Happy Family - The Play"" on Blu-Ray after seeing this fantastic quality.",3,"Great Play, but getting very old",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2932,"['am', 'big', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'plays', 'movies', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'getting', 'very', 'redundant', 'play', 'great', 'joy', 'watch', 'Me', 'dad', 'watched', 'loved', 'still', 'key', 'characteristics', 'had', 'first', '3', '4', 'plays', 'much', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'need', 'play', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'out', 'cuss', 'more', 'more', 'first', 'just', 'said', 'hell', 'few', 'marijuana', 'references', 'here', 'there', 'more', 'more', 'say', 'ass', '20', 'times', 'damn', '4-5', 'times', 'blasphemy', 'opinion', 'cases', 'play', 'marijuana', 'reference', 'EVERY', 'PLAY', ""c'mon"", 'Tyler', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'Not', 'character', 'have', 'marijuana', 'hobby.This', 'play', 'more', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'anybody', 'course', 'ALL', 'LOVE', 'MADEA', 'so', 'awesome', 'funny', 'lately', 'when', 'play', 'Madea', 'ABOUT', 'MADEA', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'stage', 'yet', 'Madea', 'only', 'one', 'talking', '90', '%', 'time', 'Telling', 'moral', 'stories', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'Let', 'someone', 'else', 'give', 'words', 'wisdom', 'Only', 'time', 'are', 'actually', 'serious', 'moments', 'play', 'when', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'not', 'stage', 'play', 'very', 'funny', 'Madea', 'lot', 'times', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'portray', 'serious', 'situation', 'Madea', 'just', 'ad-libbing', 'entire', 'time', 'pulling', 'story', 'seriousness', 'truly', 'want', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'keep', 'doing', 'work', 'making', 'plays', 'movies', 'However', 'variety', 'key', 'Not', 'same', 'old', 'concept', 'black', 'people', 'doing', 'bad', 'Not', 'mention', 'movies', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'bad', 'lately..', 'Madeas', 'Big', 'Happy', 'Family', 'movie', 'IDENTICAL', 'play', 'new', 'jokes', 'same', 'EVERYTHING', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'make', 'movie', 'play', 'not', 'change', 'darn', 'thing', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'bootleg..', 'want', 'make', '2', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'just', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'play', 'coming', 'out', 'called', 'haves', 'have', 'nots', 'currently', 'tour', 'yet', 'title', 'alone', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'Christmas', 'play', '.Cmon', 'now', ""'m"", 'getting', 'off', 'track', 'here', 'just', 'really', 'want', 'old', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'start', 'making', 'great', 'stories', 'again', 'intriguing', 'story', 'line', 'Cut', 'out', 'excess', 'fat', 'garbage', 'overall', 'good', 'play', 'GREAT', 'play', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'older', 'fans', 'just', 'money', 'maker', 'will', 'turn', 'movie.BLU-RAY', '-It', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'play', 'Blu-Ray', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'reformat', 'older', 'plays', 'make', 'High', 'Def', 'sound', 'visual', 'play', 'VERY', 'detailed', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'set', 'so', 'smoothly', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'vibrant', 'was', 'literally', 'blown', 'away', 'video', 'quality', 'play', 'Blu-Ray', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'snag', 'Madeas', 'Big', 'Happy', 'Family', 'Play', 'Blu-Ray', 'seeing', 'fantastic', 'quality']",Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas - The Play

He brings such a great message in every play...me and my husband laughs so hard when we watch Madea movies, but the plays are hilarious!!! Because Tyler get's overcome with laughter, and just can't help himself...The message is always clear, if we will go to our Bible, to search for answers in times of struggle, peace will come just from reading the words written in red...our outlook becomes bearable, and I'm so sadden, by the world's anti-christ behavior.  We don't allow the Bible in schools, yet we allow them in prison's?  Perhaps if we returned to allowing prayer in schools, and bibles to be taught or used in schools, they would not go the way of prison.  Unfortunately, as the Bible predicts, this way of our world must come about, for the last days on earth to be had.  I guess I hold out hope that someday, people will wake up and realize why our world is in a death spiral.  Our &#34;hope&#34; came already, He is still with us, He never left us, He's there, all we have to do is reach for the guidebook, and call our His name.

I was upset about that because I don't want to go through the return process; So I'm giving it away(to who? I have no clue).But anyhow. The play was just okay for me. It had some very funny scenes and slow ones as well. For me his plays are becoming a little boring. I mean they are starting to be a lot like the other plays he's done and even like some movies others has done.This play is okay, there is a good message in it itself, but, it kinda made me a upset because of the portrait painted for African Americans. It was okay at first, but then it just got worse and worst. In all of his plays except one(I believe) there are addict's, thieves, prostitutes, h*es(sleeping with best friend/sister's husband),rape etc. But in this play there's a rich African American family....oh and they're bougie. Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that act that way. The thing is, don't think you're better than someone that has less than you.And the way they(the maids family) were acting just made me sick. I know Madea is ghetto but dang she should know at least how to act while around others that maybe offend or even scared, lol. I was really hoping that when they came back that they would have a little bit more sense. I'm just tired of us always having to be portrayed as always being ghetto, hood, sluts, thieves or whatnot.I understand that there are people like that out there and the message's are meant to help. But that's not how all of us are/act. There are people out there that would love a play/movie by Tyler more about them that's not all about the ghettoness. I'm not sure if For Colored Girls display a different life style because I haven't seen it yet. All I ask is for Tyler to switch it up. Gives us something different.*UPDATE*I've finally received my package from amazon.

I thought this was the same Madea's Christmas play that aired several years ago on CTN Christian television network. Boy was I wrong. This was not the same play. I decided to rent this through Amazon Instant Video. I was so annoyed again there is nothing new or fresh about this play. I felt like I have seen this same story in his other play and I am really tired of the same story. I did not laugh at all it was so boring and predictable.There was too much singing and the content just lost my attention. I was checking my e-mail during the songs. It did not seem like there was much acting and when there was acting the content was so typical. Many recycled stories of other movies and plays that came out previously from Tyler. The fans need to speak out about this. I found myself loosing interest and barely made it to the end of the play. I really miss the plays that made Tyler popular in the beginning of his career. I find it disturbing to watch Madea and other characters making quotes from the bible and still use profanity from the same mouth of that character a few moments later in the same scene. I don't want my 13 year old daughter watching this to get the wrong message. The shock value in the play is not necessary. I was not shocked at all. All I can say is this play is not family friendly. I did not feel comfortable showing this play in the presence of my grandmother or any other relatives that expected the classic Tyler plays from a time when there was no profanity and the most you would hear is the word ""Hell"". I would say he is really pushing the limits and at some point many fans will loose interest and stop supporting his plays and films. I am having a hard time deciding if I will continue to support any future Tyler Perry productions. My 13 year old daughter was annoyed that there was too much singing and was very uncomfortable with the profanity drug references. I was hoping for a family friendly Christmas comedy that I would be proud to show at our holiday family gathering. Now I will need to find something that will not offend many of my christian relatives. So to save myself from being embarrassed during our family gathering I will not recommend this play to buy as a gift or recommend watching with a group of people with small children. Your holiday may turn into a big debate.
