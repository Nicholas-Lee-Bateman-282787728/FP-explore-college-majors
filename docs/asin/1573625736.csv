I have seen almost all of King's book-turned-movie projects and I must admit that this was the best of the lot. Unlike King's usual unbelievable and sometimes ludicrous endings, this one was believable.  The special effects were marvelous, particularly the raging sea scenes and the fall of the lighthouse.  The Roanoke reference was what I believe made this movie credible. I also liked the anagram as great minds think alike!  This film definitely gave me something to think about (if I were in his/her shoes, would I/could I...???) as well as some points to ponder about the fate of the settlers. I particularly liked the way The King grips you from frame one and slowly twists and turns you through the plot into the eye of the storm. The last few minutes were totally unexpected and I was flabergasted. This stormy tale makes for excellent viewing during inclement weather, and I recommend this film to anyone who has a taste for the unthinkable but possible.

Tuckey,"[0, 1]","I am a huge Stephen King fan, I love his books and movies like Rose Red, Misery, Doloris Clairborne, The Shining, 1408, IT and all the others. Now...this movie for the most part is VERY good, a good plot plus I thought it was witty to have the characters acutally have a brief talk about Doloris Clairborne...which is from another Stephen king movie/book.HOWEVER, the ending its downfall. It is VERY unrealistic even for a movie, and it makes zero sense really plus the type of ending they did seemed to bring false hope in faith.Basically even though the movie seems to be about a storm, yes there is a bad storm in it but it mainly focuses on a Demon who came to the town. He keeps leaving messages saying ""Give me what I want and I'll go away""So the movie is 3 hours long and your sitting through it suspeseful wanting to know what this guy wanted.It gets towards the end and he wanted one of the townspeoples' children. Ok...that alone thought it was a little off for a demonic type of thing but whatever.The part that really was weird was the fact this demon was able to take the child away and the parents never saw him again, pretty much the ending.Ok...I know its a horror movie, they don't have a happy ending most of the time. But this ending was twisted, unrealistic and just...ugh. God would never allow a demon to take a child in real life.And with all the people struggling with faith, this movie isn't gonna help them. I'm giving it four at of five because most of the movie was really intense and good, but the last 20 minutes of it went downhill fast.I think I'm also stunned because in most Stephen king movies I saw, it wasn't a ending as bad as this. In The Shining, Wendy and Danny were able to escape. In Rose Red, not all the tour but half of them were able to escape alive.In 1408, even though the ending was creepy, it was still the fact he got out of the demonic hotel room. IT had a good ending as well. So did Misery and Doloris Clairborne. The only one with a bad ending I saw was Pet Semetery but that one made sense and wasn't as twisted.I love Stephen King but this is not a piece of his work I would call a masterpiece or even good.",4,"Great movie, bad ending",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,2165,"['am', 'huge', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'love', 'books', 'movies', 'Rose', 'Red', 'Misery', 'Doloris', 'Clairborne', 'Shining', '1408', 'IT', 'others', 'Now', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'VERY', 'good', 'good', 'plot', 'thought', 'was', 'witty', 'have', 'characters', 'acutally', 'have', 'brief', 'talk', 'Doloris', 'Clairborne', 'Stephen', 'king', 'movie/book.HOWEVER', 'ending', 'downfall', 'VERY', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'movie', 'zero', 'sense', 'really', 'type', 'ending', 'did', 'seemed', 'bring', 'false', 'hope', 'faith.Basically', 'even', 'movie', 'be', 'storm', 'yes', 'bad', 'storm', 'mainly', 'Demon', 'who', 'came', 'town', 'leaving', 'messages', 'saying', 'Give', 'what', 'want', ""'ll"", 'go', 'away', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'sitting', 'suspeseful', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'guy', 'end', 'wanted', 'one', 'townspeoples', 'children', 'Ok', 'alone', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'demonic', 'type', 'thing', 'whatever.The', 'part', 'really', 'was', 'weird', 'was', 'fact', 'demon', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'child', 'away', 'parents', 'never', 'saw', 'again', 'pretty', 'much', 'ending.Ok', 'know', 'horror', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'time', 'ending', 'was', 'twisted', 'unrealistic', 'just', 'ugh', 'God', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'demon', 'take', 'child', 'real', 'life.And', 'people', 'struggling', 'faith', 'movie', ""n't"", 'gon', 'help', ""'m"", 'giving', 'four', 'five', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'intense', 'good', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'went', 'downhill', 'fast.I', 'think', ""'m"", 'also', 'stunned', 'because', 'most', 'Stephen', 'king', 'movies', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'ending', 'as', 'bad', 'Shining', 'Wendy', 'Danny', 'were', 'able', 'escape', 'Rose', 'Red', 'not', 'tour', 'half', 'were', 'able', 'escape', 'alive.In', '1408', 'even', 'ending', 'was', 'creepy', 'was', 'still', 'fact', 'got', 'out', 'demonic', 'hotel', 'room', 'IT', 'had', 'good', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'did', 'Misery', 'Doloris', 'Clairborne', 'only', 'one', 'bad', 'ending', 'saw', 'was', 'Pet', 'Semetery', 'one', 'made', 'sense', 'was', ""n't"", 'twisted.I', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'not', 'piece', 'work', 'would', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'good']",N/A
190484,A2582KMXLK2P06,1573625736,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","While Hurricane Sandy was blowing through on Monday night/early Tuesday morning and millions of us were bracing for the worst case scenario, I was watching Stephen King's 3-part mini series called Storm of the Century.  It's about a demon or perhaps the devil himself making an unexpected visit to a small town/island in upper Maine right before a severe blizzard is expected to hit, and well, what a fine time to make everyone pay for their sins, wouldn't you say?  I'd rather pay for mine in a more pleasant environment but, that's just me.  Anyway, the theme throughout the movie (to the point of repetition in fact) is that this devil demon creature disguised as a man with black eyes scatters messages literally everywhere about wanting to have a VERY important discussion about... well, that's too much of a spoiler so I won't reveal exactly what it's about.  You're just going to have to watch this 4 hour and 30 minute film until that specific point arrives my dear readers!I *did* have to laugh in a few spots such as the scene when the devil is forced to walk inside a grocery store because the back door is suspiciously sealed shut, so when the police take him down the aisles of the store and all the townspeople are standing around scared and confused at his presence, he reveals all the dirty sins, crimes and hidden secrets about certain people right in front of everyone else.  The subjects he discusses (and flat out embarrasses the people with) are of course the big ones- affairs, cheating relationships, murders, drug trades and businesses, etc.  The devil unleashes a verbal (and occasionally physical) tear throughout the entire movie basically picking apart everyone one by one in humiliating fashion.  Some of these subjects are really raw and offensive, but I guess that's the job of the devil now isn't it?  He doesn't hold back either.  Another memorable piece of writing is how he's willing to go to jail without a fight and even smiles on the way there.The townspeople are all given plenty of time to develop their characters so you end up caring deeply for many of them and certainly don't want to see anybody harmed in any way.  I like how the initial feeling is that the devil/demon could literally be anything bad, but we don't realize *just* how bad until later on.  The suspense that gradually builds with little fragments of storytelling involving this demon being able to read peoples minds, reveal their sins and basically know everything about them is just wonderful and addicting storytelling for viewers intrigued by the subject.I was totally attached to the storyline all the way through.  You just want to find out what's going to happen in the end, and my oh my what an *extremely* twisted and evil intention occurs during the final 45 minutes.  That's some really hard to watch storytelling and reveals why Stephen King is truly the master of unpredictable horror writing and just overall oddness.  His style never grows old.

This was the rare mini-series event to stem from an original screenplay instead of a written novel. And, in much the same manner as ""The Stand,"" I found ""Storm"" to be every bit as professional and well-crafted as any movie I've seen in a theater. Craig Baxley should be highly commended for the exceptional work he put into this production.The main hook of the story centers around a picturesque town straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting, whose inhabitants soon find themselves faced with two major threats. An unprecedented snow storm has cut off the entire immediate area from the outside world. That, alone, would be considered bad enough by most common people. But that, unfortunately, is only the beginning. The real danger arrives in the form of the mysterious Andre Linoge, a sinister figure who has come to the island of Little Tall with a singular purpose. One that might ultimately spell DOOM for all the townspeople.Say what you will about Stephen King's track record in film. I happen to enjoy the majority of movies adapted from his books, and this one is certainly up there with the best. The script benefits greatly from the tight pacing and high caliber writing we've come to expect from King. The characters here, in this film specifically, all shine because we are led to care about what happens to each of them. That is what I believe is Stephen King's primary gift as a writer.Colm Feore, it should be mentioned, turns in a positively stunning performance as Linoge. Anybody who claims they weren't the least bit affected by his bone-chilling delivery is seriously deluding themselves. He and Tim Daly, I thought, played remarkably well off each other. Their scenes, by themselves, are empowering enough for me to strongly recommend this movie to anyone who might have missed its initial televised run. I think anyone who, in general, simply enjoys a good story will want to add this to their collection.

In unique King style, ""Storm of the Century"" traps us with the victims seeking escape and, in the end, abolution that never really comes, and we feel the sense of entrapment and the danger of the icy grip outside if we run. With nowhere to run, we then are stuck to face our own choices, the moral implications they carry and the cost that will demand payment the rest of our lives. Director Craig R. Baxley manages to get from his actors chillingly effective performances, led by Colm Feore as Linoge, the messenger from hell, and Daly who, in the end, is left looking for a resolution that we are left to presume he will never find. In the end, evil is demanding from the town it entraps the souls of its children, and the morality play unfolds on the premise of what cost of survival. It's a provocative and worthwhile production that has King's unique signature throughout.

190501,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,1573625736,"citan-uzuki ""citan-uzuki""","[28, 30]","""Hell is repetition"", says Andre Linoge.  ""Hopefully, this review won't sound too much like repetition to my readers"", says your humble reviewer and friend.Out of all of Stephen King's mini-series for television, this one is my favorite.  And unlike his other mini-series, this one was written for television right from the start.  In other words, it was not adapted from one of his books.  He wrote it with TV in mind, right from the start.The story takes place on a small island near the coast of Maine, Little Tall Island.  The plot begins with the news of an upcoming storm, the storm of the century.  The town starts preparations for the storm, while on the edge of town, in front of a small house, a stranger in a navy peacoat appears.  He knocks on the door of the house and murders the elderly woman living there as soon as she opens the door.  He bludgeons the old woman with his cane, killing her.  ""Born in sin, come on in"", utters the stranger in the navy jacket as he enters the house, stepping over the dead woman.The town grocer, who is also the part-time constable, takes the man into custody and locks him in the jail cell behind his store (like I said, it's a small town).  The stranger identifies himself as Andre Linoge.  Linoge seems to know all of the town people's deeply-held secrets and makes them public, causing distress and mistrust to spread among the villagers.  Soon afterwards, the people start acting out in violent ways.  Murder and suicide begin.  And the only clue that Mike Anderson (constable and grocer) has is a cryptic message found on the corpses, ""Give me what I want, and I'll go away"".  Meanwhile, the storm continues to rage outside, increasing in fury and intensity.  The people all gather in the basement of the City Hall in order to shelter from the violent storm.  Snow pours down heavily from the sky as the waves batter the coast unrelentingly.Mike and his sidekick, Alton Hatcher, suspect Andre Linoge is the one causing the mass murders and mass suicides through some kind of mind manipulation.  They decide to form a small posse, with a pair guarding the jail cell at all times, taking shifts.  Linoge waits for the height of the storm and then breaks out of his jail cell, with the posse unable to stop him, he walks out into the storm.  A short time later, Linoge appears at the storm shelter beneath city hall, and instructs the villagers to call a meeting for that evening.  He tells them that he will return for the meeting, he will tell them what he wants during the gathering.  As he walks out, back into the storm, all of the children fall into a comatose state.I do not want to spoil the story for you, it's excellent.  This is definitely worth watching.  Tim Daly plays the town constable, Mike Anderson.  Mike is one of those people with natural leadership skills.  He is well-respected in the community for his intelligence and honesty.  Jeffrey DeMunn plays the town manager.  Debrah Farentino plays the role of Mike's wife, Molly Anderson.  And Colm Feore plays the role that he will be best remembered for, the sinister Andre Linoge.",5,Hell is Repetition!,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,3103,"['Hell', 'repetition', 'Andre', 'Linoge', 'Hopefully', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sound', 'too', 'much', 'repetition', 'readers', 'humble', 'reviewer', 'friend.Out', 'Stephen', 'King', 'mini-series', 'television', 'one', 'favorite', 'other', 'mini-series', 'one', 'was', 'written', 'television', 'right', 'start', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'not', 'adapted', 'one', 'books', 'wrote', 'TV', 'mind', 'right', 'start.The', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'island', 'coast', 'Maine', 'Little', 'Tall', 'Island', 'plot', 'news', 'upcoming', 'storm', 'storm', 'century', 'town', 'preparations', 'storm', 'edge', 'town', 'front', 'small', 'house', 'stranger', 'navy', 'peacoat', 'door', 'house', 'elderly', 'woman', 'living', 'there', 'as', 'soon', 'door', 'old', 'woman', 'cane', 'killing', 'Born', 'sin', 'come', 'stranger', 'navy', 'jacket', 'house', 'stepping', 'dead', 'woman.The', 'town', 'grocer', 'who', 'also', 'part-time', 'constable', 'man', 'custody', 'jail', 'cell', 'store', 'said', 'small', 'town', 'stranger', 'Andre', 'Linoge', 'Linoge', 'know', 'town', 'people', 'deeply-held', 'secrets', 'public', 'causing', 'distress', 'mistrust', 'spread', 'villagers', 'Soon', 'afterwards', 'people', 'start', 'acting', 'out', 'violent', 'ways', 'Murder', 'suicide', 'begin', 'only', 'clue', 'Mike', 'Anderson', 'constable', 'grocer', 'cryptic', 'message', 'found', 'corpses', 'Give', 'what', 'want', ""'ll"", 'go', 'away', 'Meanwhile', 'storm', 'rage', 'outside', 'increasing', 'fury', 'intensity', 'people', 'gather', 'basement', 'City', 'Hall', 'order', 'shelter', 'violent', 'storm', 'Snow', 'down', 'heavily', 'sky', 'waves', 'batter', 'coast', 'unrelentingly.Mike', 'sidekick', 'Alton', 'Hatcher', 'suspect', 'Andre', 'Linoge', 'one', 'causing', 'mass', 'murders', 'mass', 'suicides', 'kind', 'mind', 'manipulation', 'decide', 'form', 'small', 'posse', 'pair', 'guarding', 'jail', 'cell', 'times', 'taking', 'shifts', 'Linoge', 'height', 'storm', 'then', 'jail', 'cell', 'posse', 'unable', 'stop', 'out', 'storm', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'Linoge', 'storm', 'shelter', 'beneath', 'city', 'hall', 'villagers', 'call', 'meeting', 'evening', 'will', 'return', 'meeting', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'gathering', 'out', 'back', 'storm', 'children', 'fall', 'comatose', 'state.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'story', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'town', 'constable', 'Mike', 'Anderson', 'Mike', 'one', 'people', 'natural', 'leadership', 'skills', 'well-respected', 'community', 'intelligence', 'honesty', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn', 'town', 'manager', 'Debrah', 'Farentino', 'role', 'Mike', 'wife', 'Molly', 'Anderson', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'remembered', 'sinister', 'Andre', 'Linoge']",N/A

The box looked pretty cool and it was from Stephen King.  I was kind of concerned however because I had never heard of it before.  I asked around the store about people's opinions but they didn't know about it either.  Anyway I bought the DVD thinking I was going to get the classic Stephen King horror movie.  I was wrong.  If you are expecting the same level of horror as in Pet Semetary, and IT, then you will be dissapointed as I was.  The first thing you will notice about the movie was that it is very slow as the storyline seems to drag along forever. (its two DVD's)  Because the first half of the movie is VERY slow and you may not want to watch it at night because you might fall asleep (as I did).  However it does pick up a little on the second DVD when things start happening more frequently.  The last parts of the movie are very good and it makes up a little for the extremely boring start.  I wish I could give this movie 3.5 stars instead of 3 because in my opinion is better than The Blair Witch Project(I gave that 3). My advice is if you don't expect classic Stephen King horror from this one then you will be fairly satisfied with this movie.

Originally a three night event this movie is presented here in its entirety on dvd. The setting is a small island off the coast of Maine and the residents of the town are getting ready for a huge snowstorm. However, a mysterious and dangerous stranger comes to town and chaos ensues. People are murdered and secrets revealed. Timothy Daly plays the island town's constable and seems to be the only resident to keep a level head. His faith is put to the test as is his loyalty not only to the town's residents but also to his own family. The stranger who goes by the name Linoge begins to make a startling request. I won't give away any more of the plot but I think it's safe to say that this movie rates right up there when it comes to possessing all the elements that make a scary movie good. The setting is very creepy and, as with all Stephen King works, the storylines are thrilling and chilling with interesting characters and plot twists. And the bad guy is quite believable too.

All of those pundits who say King is worthless should take a lit course or two, as I have dedicated my life to mystery/suspense literature and films. What makes this one special are three things: the acting (Daly, Feore, and DeMunn are brilliant in their large roles), the setting (the film runs long, but the visual effects and music are both outstanding), and the character development (which King does here EVEN BETTER than he did in The Green Mile). One might say the ending is predictable, but it makes sense bacause the characters had continuously done the wrong thing all their lives. The big King twist at the end, few people get when they watch it the first time. I won't give it away, but I will just say this: Keep thinking after the film ends, about what will happen to the characters down the road, and which of them will ultimately get redemption and which others will be eternally punished.

My rating is not a judgment of the merits of Storm on a scale of good to bad, rather, it is simply how it impacted upon me. Fundamentally, I found that when I came back a second day to watch the third and final segment, I could not get into a properly receptive mood. Without revealing what went on in the segment, I can only say that the grip with which the first segment (of three) had upon me, was almost completely loosened and I  felt no sense of involvement with what was supposed to be the stunner. In fact, I began thinking more of what appeared to me to be the arbitrary construction of the story than the story itself. It seems to be the case that I felt he had  violated (what might be called) the dramatic code of this kind of story, in book, theater or film, the fight between good and evil; it was indeed, simply  the operation of evil vs. evil, a much less interesting dilemma.

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Agatha Christie's 1939 novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (also known as TEN LITTLE INDIANS) created the notion of a group of people trapped on an island with a psychotic killer determined to pick the others off one by one.  Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt's 1956 THE VISIT was a disconcerting comedy in which a wealthy woman returns to her childhood home promising a fortune to the townfolk--if they will kill the lover who wronged her so many years ago.  Stephen King's THE STORM OF THE CENTURY seems to combine both ideas, albeit in his own uniquely macabre way, and the result is an unexpected morality tale of the choice between dying to preserve good or living and thereby perpetuating evil.The story is set on Little Tall Island, a fishing community just off the coast of Maine, which is battening down the hatches for a major winter storm.  Residents are nervous but not unduly so: they have weathered such storms in the past.  But before the storm takes hold, an elderly woman is brutally murdered for no apparent reason, and her killer, Mr. Andre Linoge (Colm Feore) offers no resistance when he is arrested by town constable Michael Anderson (Timothy Daly)--but while being led to a jail cell at the back of the general store, Linoge makes unsavory statements about several store customers that are clearly true but which he has no natural way of knowing.  It soon becomes obvious that for Linoge, iron bars do not a prison make: there are several extremely strange suicides and murders, all of them tagged with the words ""Just give me what I want and I'll go away.""  But what, the townfolk wonder as the winter storm gathers in increasing violence, does Linoge want?  And who--or what--is he?  And can they escape his demands?THE STORM OF THE CENTURY feels slightly overlong, but unlike most made-for-television films the transitions have been edited into a smooth narrative (I will admit, however, the break between part one and part two is very abrupt.)  The performances are very nice across the board, with Feore and Dailey particularly memorable.  But the great power of the story is the question it poses: what would you do if caught in such situation?  Perpetuate the evil in order to live?  Or sacrifice yourself and your entire community in an effort to destroy it?  The DVD comes with an interesting commentary by Stephen King, who often states that this is favorite among his television works--it was not adapted from any of his novels but was written directly for the screen.

However, on the eve of a disastrous Winter storm, an evil, omnipresent creature visits the townspeople.  He knows their darkest secrets and exposes them for what they truly are: hypocrites.  Calling himself Andre Linoge, he uses his supernatural powers to isolate the island from the rest of the world and force its citizens to commit suicide one by one.  All the while he continues to make one cryptic demand:  ""Give me what I want and I'll go away.""  Constable Michael Anderson rushes to find out what this creature wants before the entire community vanishes forever as did the Roanoke Colony in 1590.""Storm of the Century"" is my favorite Stephen King miniseries.  The small, isolated island is the perfect setting for claustrophobic terror.  Two-hundred people are trapped and at the mercy of a diabolical creature whose origin is never fully understood.  Is Andre Linoge a demon or an alien?With his strong, chiseled face, Colm Feore (""Chronicles of Riddick"") gives an excellent performance as Andre Linoge.  Tim Daly (""Private Practice"" television series) is wonderful as the likeable Michael Anderson.  Debrah Farentino is perfect as his stubborn wife, Molly, who opposes him.  The entire cast, including many extras, was well chosen and made me feel as if they were an actual community of fishermen.Perhaps the citizens of Little Tall represent mankind in general.  After all, don't we all have dark secrets we don't want revealed?  This miniseries is very provocative.  How would we react in a similar situation?  Would we give the creature whatever he wanted so that he would go away?  I would hope that I would side with Michael Anderson.  Yes, Andre Linoge is a creature that is more powerful than a man, but he is also less than a god as he clearly stated.  Therefore, he can be defeated.  Also, where is the people's faith that the God of all creation can help them?  When facing a moral crisis, humans sometimes disregard their values.  I have learned that choosing to do right can sometimes be very difficult.""Storm of the Century"" is highly recommended for all Stephen King fans.  It is a superb example of modern gothic horror.

An ancient man/demon needs to be given a gift by the people of the island in order to continue his existence. He cannot take it but it has to be willingly given. All he can do is persuade by death and fear to get what he wants. I enjoyed this movie and the acting was pretty good. The only problem I had is that it just seemed too long. The movie is actually a mini-series from TV and it is 256 minutes long and contains 30 scenes. While this movie is good and I love almost anything written by Stephen King, it suffers the malady of moving slowly at times because of its length. If the movie had been 2 hours or even 2  it would have been a tighter story and kept your focus on it better. TV miniseries have to learn that sometimes less is more!I do recommend this movie and if you are a Stephen King fan it is a must see DVD.

190538,A311626XD2C4T2,1573625736,JordanJasper,"[0, 0]","For me, there's a definite irony attached to this project, as far as King is concerned. Most of his novels have not been very well adapted to the big screen (or small screen) during his long career. This likely has more to do with those who try to direct, produce, and adapt King's work than with the source-work itself. Even ""Carrie,"" ""Misery,"" and Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (the best adaptations of his material, so far) were not quite as good as the books. As a longtime King admirer, it's been a bit of a frustration to see film-versions of his work consistently fail to dazzle.With 'Storm of the Century,' however, we have a story from the mind of King that is extremely effective and resonant onscreen...BUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT IN NOVEL-FORM! Hence the irony. This is one bit of King's imagination I would love to have seen fleshed-out in a massive, juicy book. The film is genuinely spooky. The story is full of suspense. The setting is both claustrophic and wildly elemental. The characters are compelling. The performances are very good. Best of all is the premise. Here, King essentially seeks to offer a very spine-tingling explanation for the infamously mysterious (and never solved) disappearances of hundreds of colonists in 17th century Roanoke.In this tale, King offers a truly chilling villain in Andre Linoge, who is apparently some sort of ancient demon or sorcerer who, every few hundred years, needs to force some community of human beings to turn on each other and freely offer-up one of their small children to him. What Linoge does with the chosen child is only hinted-at in the film, but it seems that, as the sorcerer's body becomes ravaged by extreme age, he eventually ""possesses"" the child and is made young and semi-immortal again.There are several obstacles to the fulfillment of Linoge's black magic, however, and these are the things that make for a great story & plot. First, Linoge must apparently cull the chosen child from an isolated community (here, it's ""Little Tall Island,"" off the Maine coast). Then, he must infiltrate the community and terrorize it, sowing confusion and shame through threats and the revelation of the townsfolks' own, hidden secrets. Finally, he must essentially trick them (Shirley Jackson ""Lottery""-style) into agreeing to offer one of their children in order to spare the entire community from a complete destruction that is never defined (also quite spooky). Linoge's mantra is: ""Give me what I want and I'll go away."" In this case, the viewer is made aware that the previous community singled-out for demonic harassment (17th-century Roanoke Island) apparently did ~not~ comply with his wishes, and none were ever seen again.That, however, is just one bonus layer of intrigue and ""coolness"" about King's overall tale, and how it's delineated here. The meat of the film is the gradual unraveling of the entire town, which is cut-off from any chance of outside help by a tremendous winter storm obviously fueled by the powers of Linoge. As the secrets and vulnerabilities of one townsperson after another are exposed by the creature, the sense of doom grows more palpable and unsettling. Tim Daly ('Wings') effectively plays Mike Anderson, the local sheriff who stands as King's upright, good-hearted Everyman, trying to keep the town sane under the yoke of the evil oppressor, even as the storm worsens. In trying to protect the others in town, however, Anderson overlooks the deeper, more personal horror that Linoge has in store for *him*. I won't spoil it.A strong story, strong plotting, strong cinematography, and strong performances make this an absolute must-have for King fans, and a winner for any fan of contemporary horror. Light-years better than the messy ""It,"" ""Shining,"" and ""Rose Red"" TV-productions, ""Storm of the Century"" features the King imagination at its near-best, accurately captured on film.

King wrote this sinister little tale especially for ABC television and I have to admit, that beside the fact that it is a good story for a cold night, snow piling up outside, it is a very good mvie as well. I loved the actors, the filming and just every minute of the 4-hour mini-series. I even watched the whole thing just listening to Stephen King's commentary (although I skipped the parts director Craig Baxley commented) - the commentary was as good as the movie itself, because it was not some poor strawhat talking about something, but Stephen King doing what he can do best: not commenting, but telling. Stephen King gives very delightful inside-information on the making of the movie and talks about works related to this movie, how he came across the idea for the story (it was partly influenced by a play by Friedrich D&uuml;renmatt King had a part in when being in High School), how he tried to work it out, stuff like that.

Gordon,"[0, 0]","Intelligent Stephen King mini-series.A stranger comes to a small Maine island town during the titular storm,and turns the town upside-down, starting by killing a sweet old lady inthe very first scene.Played with wonderfully charismatic and subtle menace by Colm Feore,this supernatural stranger, who knows everyone's secrets and canmanipulate others to do in themselves or loved ones, has one repeatedmessage; 'Give me what I want and I'll go away'.Of course, we don't find out what that something is until the end ofthe third and last part of the series, but it is a surprising andeffectively unsettling twist that leads to moral complexities and humanemotion more than to simplistic horror.There are flaws. Tim Daly as the protagonist (the town's constable)tries hard, but the character is bland enough that he can't quite keepup our interest the way antagonist Ferore can.Also, for a 4 hour and 15 minute film, we get to know frustratinglylittle about many of the supporting characters. While well acted, weoften are given a first impression of a character, and then reallynever learn much else. This keeps the film from becoming truly greatwhen the climax involves the townspeople turning on themselves.There's also the slightly annoying logic question. If Feore's characteris so powerful, why can't he just take what he wants? (There's anexplanation, but it's pretty thin).None-the-less, I was almost never bored, and the film is very wellmade.

190552,A2NYP1VC6FOFER,1573625736,Larry Zieminski,"[2, 2]","I was very entertained by Storm of the Century.  Stephen King doesn't have a terrific track record in getting good adaptations made from his written works.  That isn't an issue here, however, as it was written specifically for the screen.  Unlike some of his other early works, this mini-series doesn't suffer from too many unfortunate CG shots (the cane look fake, but the storm itself looks and feels pretty realistic)...watchRose Redto see a movie that has its scares ruined by painfully obvious effects shots (obvious now, but pretty good when it came out of course).  The only real issue I had dealt with length.  The villain is constantly repeating ""Give me what I want and I'll go away,"" but due to the long running time, we have to wait more than 3 hours to hear what he wants.  By about hour 2 I was tired of hearing his threats that lacked information.  I chalk that up to the very long run time and requirements of stretching the suspense over 3 nights.The DVD is unfortunately not packed with features.  Unlike the Rose Red DVD, there is no documentary on the making of the film, no behind the scenes footage, or anything like that.  The two real features we get (aside from Cast bios) are a trailer for the mini-series and a commentary by the director (Craig R. Baxley) and King himself (recorded separately, then spliced together).  The commentary is actually pretty good.  King gives the backstory of how he came to write the mini-series and the director talks about how they made the show.  Unfortunately there are sections (some quite long) where there is no talking at all.  That meant that I had to fast forward, then stop, frequently to hear when the commentary started up again.  I would have preferred a track that showed just the sections with commentary audio (for a good example of that, check outGettysburg (Widescreen Edition)).",4,Very good mini-series gets a serviceable DVD,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,1855,"['was', 'very', 'entertained', 'Storm', 'Century', 'Stephen', 'King', ""n't"", 'have', 'terrific', 'track', 'record', 'getting', 'good', 'adaptations', 'made', 'written', 'works', ""n't"", 'issue', 'here', 'however', 'was', 'written', 'specifically', 'screen', 'other', 'early', 'works', 'mini-series', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'too', 'many', 'unfortunate', 'CG', 'shots', 'cane', 'look', 'fake', 'storm', 'feels', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'watchRose', 'Redto', 'see', 'movie', 'scares', 'ruined', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'effects', 'shots', 'obvious', 'now', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'course', 'only', 'real', 'issue', 'had', 'dealt', 'length', 'villain', 'constantly', 'repeating', 'Give', 'what', 'want', ""'ll"", 'go', 'away', 'due', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'have', 'wait', 'more', '3', 'hours', 'hear', 'what', 'hour', '2', 'was', 'tired', 'hearing', 'threats', 'lacked', 'information', 'chalk', 'very', 'long', 'run', 'time', 'requirements', 'stretching', 'suspense', '3', 'nights.The', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'packed', 'features', 'Rose', 'Red', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'scenes', 'footage', 'anything', 'two', 'real', 'features', 'get', 'aside', 'Cast', 'bios', 'are', 'trailer', 'mini-series', 'commentary', 'director', 'Craig', 'R.', 'Baxley', 'King', 'recorded', 'separately', 'then', 'spliced', 'together', 'commentary', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'King', 'backstory', 'how', 'came', 'write', 'mini-series', 'director', 'talks', 'how', 'made', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'sections', 'quite', 'long', 'where', 'talking', 'meant', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'then', 'stop', 'frequently', 'hear', 'when', 'commentary', 'started', 'up', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'track', 'showed', 'just', 'sections', 'commentary', 'audio', 'good', 'example', 'check', 'outGettysburg', 'Widescreen', 'Edition']",N/A

Bernabo,"[5, 6]","Living in the frozen north, where winters lasts half the year, it is good to know we have the perfect set of tapes on the shelf to watch when the next blizzard hits, we get dumped with a foot or more of snow, and we're going to be stuck inside for a while.  &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; combines the snowbound claustrophobia of &quot;The Shinning&quot; and the mob mentality of &quot;Needful Things&quot; with the most recurrent theme in King's work: good people having the courage to do good things.  However, as is often the case in King's stories, sometimes that is just not good enough.As King himself has observed, at its heart &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; is the dark counterpart to &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; with each centered on the mystery of the man in the jail cell.  Andre Linoge (Colm Feore) has come to Little Tall Island just as the fiercest winter storm in recorded history is about to hit.  After murdering one of the residents, Linoge waits calmly to be taken into police custody by Constable Mike Anderson (Tim Daly).  But once in his cell he tells the townsfolk, &quot;If you give me what I want, I'll go away.&quot;  Then things start to happen, secrets are revealed and more people die, and suddenly the citizens of Long Tall Island are ready to agree to Linoge's proposition even before they know exactly what it is he wants.&quot;Storm of the Century&quot; works better without commercial interruptions and viewed in one sitting than it did in the original three-parts.  This is a story where the horror grows slowly and you share the unease of the characters as to what is going on and what they can do about.  Colm Feore does a nice job of underplaying the role of Linoge, while Tim Daly slowly loses it as the situation and Linoge combine to undercut his legal and moral authority within the community.  Debrah Farentino has the pivotal role of his wife Molly, who ends up being caught in the middle.  Daly's is the key performance that holds the entire story together, and the cast of character actors does a nice job of providing the sense that this is a real community dealing with a most unreal situation.This television mini-series is much more suited to the intimacy of a television set in a living room than a movie theater, which better suits a film like &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot;  The blizzard merely sets the stage for the human drama.  In a way this story anticipates this summer's love affair with the television show &quot;Survivor,&quot; where people end up talking about what they would do, and to who, if they were in that situation.  King has always been a moralist, knowing full well that most people are not inclined to do the right thing, and always striving to come up with a story that might actually inspire some people to listen to the better angels of their nature.

190561,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,1573625736,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[0, 0]","This is one of Stephen King's better works. Its in the subset of his works with heavy religious undertones such as &#34;The Stand&#34;, &#34;Salem's Lot&#34; and so on. Its a style that is almost unique to him. The undertones of these works are so well done that they allow them to often rise above the horror genre material that they superfically represent. As always, the characters are well fleshed out as normal people.This is a story of a demon that comes to a very corrupt small town and demands something. The town is isolated because it is on an island and there is massive storm going on. Its in some sense a film about the test of the town and the one moral man in the town when confronted with an enormous evil.  Unlike many of King's works, the evil character in this story has rational understandable motives rather than just being a monster randoming killing people for no particular reason.The weakness of the story is that the monster has things too much his way. He seems to have absolutely no weak points and never seems to be challenged in the slightest by anyone. At the very least, they missed the opportunity to do a &#34;casting out&#34; of the demon from at least one victim in the story. What the story is missing is the good man showing that in the corrupt town *he* can stand up to the demon even if the town cannot. That the failure at the end is not the strength of the demon, but the weakness and moral corruption of the entire town.I think it also would have been better to show the demon's power over these people being based on their own guilt and shame over the things that they had done. It would have been better as well to establish him as having no particular power to simply kill innocents. The problem in story terms is that the character is shown as so overwhelmingly strong that the town's submission doesn't seem quite the failure it should be. His strength is also so overwhelming that its not clear at all why he needs the cooperation of the town. It comes close to getting everything right, but comes up just slightly short. The allusions to Job don't quite completely work either because of the ending.Its good in that it avoids King's usual story patterns and cliches. Its a pure story of man vs. town like high noon or enemy of the people.Colm Feore gives the best performance in the film. He manages to project a sense of menace and control in a real way. His performance can be compared to that of Rutger Hauer at his best in similar roles.  He brings a sense of confidence to the character that plays itself out in every scene.Tim Daly does well too in creating the convincing character of almost the one good man in a bad town.For a TV horror movie, its exceptional.",4,The story of a good man in a bad town,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,2719,"['one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'better', 'works', 'subset', 'works', 'heavy', 'religious', 'undertones', 'such', '34', 'Stand', '34', '34', 'Salem', 'Lot', '34', 'so', 'style', 'almost', 'unique', 'undertones', 'works', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'allow', 'often', 'rise', 'horror', 'material', 'superfically', 'represent', 'always', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'normal', 'people.This', 'story', 'demon', 'very', 'corrupt', 'small', 'town', 'demands', 'something', 'town', 'isolated', 'island', 'massive', 'storm', 'going', 'sense', 'film', 'test', 'town', 'one', 'moral', 'man', 'town', 'when', 'confronted', 'enormous', 'evil', 'many', 'King', 'works', 'evil', 'character', 'story', 'rational', 'understandable', 'motives', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'monster', 'randoming', 'killing', 'people', 'particular', 'reason.The', 'weakness', 'story', 'monster', 'things', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'have', 'absolutely', 'weak', 'points', 'never', 'be', 'challenged', 'slightest', 'anyone', 'very', 'least', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'do', '34', 'casting', 'out', '34', 'demon', 'least', 'one', 'victim', 'story', 'What', 'story', 'missing', 'good', 'man', 'showing', 'corrupt', 'town', '*he*', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'demon', 'even', 'town', 'can', 'not', 'failure', 'end', 'not', 'strength', 'demon', 'weakness', 'moral', 'corruption', 'entire', 'town.I', 'think', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'show', 'demon', 'power', 'people', 'being', 'based', 'own', 'guilt', 'shame', 'things', 'had', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'establish', 'having', 'particular', 'power', 'simply', 'kill', 'innocents', 'problem', 'story', 'terms', 'character', 'shown', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'strong', 'town', 'submission', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'failure', 'should', 'be', 'strength', 'also', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'cooperation', 'town', 'close', 'getting', 'everything', 'right', 'up', 'just', 'slightly', 'short', 'allusions', 'Job', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'completely', 'work', 'either', 'ending.Its', 'good', 'King', 'usual', 'story', 'patterns', 'cliches', 'pure', 'story', 'man', 'vs.', 'town', 'high', 'noon', 'enemy', 'people.Colm', 'Feore', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'project', 'sense', 'menace', 'control', 'real', 'way', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'best', 'similar', 'roles', 'sense', 'confidence', 'character', 'out', 'scene.Tim', 'Daly', 'well', 'too', 'creating', 'convincing', 'character', 'almost', 'one', 'good', 'man', 'bad', 'town.For', 'TV', 'horror', 'movie', 'exceptional']",N/A
190562,A2NC5BMF6QWC5B,1573625736,Mark Laflamme,"[6, 8]","Introduce yourself to Andre Linoge. He is tall and narrow, clad in jeans, a pea coat and a watch cap. He moves with deliberate grace clutching a strange cane and there seems to be a sly smile about his face at all times. Linoge is a charming man. He speaks with good cheer and even flirts a little with the ladies.But Andre Linoge is consumately evil and he has come among the people of Little Tall Island with a wish list. Always smiling, always sunny and playful, Linoge wreaks utter havoc with the island folk while a killer snowstorm rages around them. Ultimately, he only wants to get their attention. He wants something from them but does not state what it is until the last hour of the movie. Linoge spends most of his time convincing these stubborn, gritty island people that handing over what he desires is in their best interest. He does this with savagery, but also with a detached sense of joy like a cat pawing at a mouse.""Give me what I want,"" utters Linoge over and over, in a voice like a lullabye ""and I'll go away.""Linoge knows their secrets. He knows who is growing marijuana to supplement his income, who has gone to the city for an abortion, who beat up a gay man, who burned down the planing mill across the reach there in Machias, and who harbors hate in their hearts. Linoge sees it all and he doles it out to the increasingly mortified island people who tend to keep their secrets close.""Your town is full of thieves, gluttons, murderers, bullies, scoundrels and covetous morons,"" Linoge tells them. ""And I know every last one of them.""By the end of the movie, you have joined dozens of island characters in a desperate need to know what Linoge wants. When you find out, prepare for a moral quandary. The horror of murder and bizarre cruelty that marks the first half of the film is replaced in the second by a deeper horror, one that strikes closer to the human soul.This is a long movie, and a great one to watch on a blustery winter day. The story is fascinating from the opening scenes, the acting is superb, and even the overblown Maine accents don't distract too much from the crawling unpleasantness.King has proven time after time that he can introduce dozens of characters with such richness and personality, that the viewer (or the reader) will remember intimate details about these men, women and children as though they were neighbors. Some you hate, some you love and others you simply understand. In the end though, the focus narrows to the most significant characters in Linoge and town constable Michael Anderson. The latter is played perfectly by Daly, who manages to emote the rage, fear and frustration brought about by this stranger who has come among them. It is a stellar performance worthy of much notice.But all of the scenes are stolen by Colm Fiore and what proves to be one of the most striking, menacing and infinitely wicked characters ever to grace the screen. Linoge is so freakin' bad, you almost like him at times. The year this movie was released, I dressed as Linoge for Halloween and found it hard to get out of character. After a week of gliding through the newsroom uttering: ""Give me what I want, and I'll go away,"" my colleagues were eager to see that I delivered on the latter part of that promise.In the end though, Linoge and his sinful wants will make you cringe. The conclusion to the movie is worth fighting over with your spouse or your friends, who agree or disagree that Linoge should be handed what he came for.The best of King's made-for-tv flicks, ""Storm of the Century"" is a must see.

In spite of the film's length, director Craig Baxley keeps the suspense and underlying terror moving in this excellent Stephen King movie.  Not inspired by a book, King gives us his trademark setting and characters and a villain whose sheer malevolence oozes from the screen.  The pacing of the storm itself is in syncrhonicity with the townspeople's growing fear, and after discovering what Mr. Linoge wants from them, this heinous act comes easily to the frightened townspeople.  The cast is marvelous:  Tim Daly is perfect as the town constable and moral backbone.  We see him go from a measured self-confidence to a bewildered victim of his own community; Debrah Farentino is wonderful as his wife, Molly, whose tenacious perseverance crumbles as the storm and Linoge become fiercer; Casey Sieszmasko as Daly's friend and deputy has a naivete and innocence that crumbles easily under the gaze of Linoge; Jeffrey DeMunn takes the stereotypical blowhard town manager and infuses a complex portrait of a man's guilt and desire to be in charge.  A cast of lesser known actors (at least to me) are well chosen and bring life to the town's citizens.  Linoge's exposition of all their darkest secrets is bonechilling.  That brings us to Colm Feore, the actor wisely chosen to portray this demonic villain.  Using his oddly handsome face to show both contempt and control, Feore dominates all his scenes and makes us wish only the worst for him.The resolution of this movie is typically dark, so don't expect to come away feeling chipper.

Although the film is perhaps a bit longer than it should've been, the performances are wonderful, and the small Maine town really has a homespun feel to it. Of course, the element of evil is not far away, and this time it comes in the form of a mysterious stranger who promises that he'll go away, providing that the townspeople give him what he wants. The demon visitor cannot, it seems, simply take what he wants, for that would apparently be a violation of the rules of demonology.This teleplay was written directly for the screen, and there are moments where it feels a bit drawn out. It was shown over three or four nights back in 1999, but it still remains one of the best adaptations of any of King's offerings.

If you're familiar with the Dark Tower series and have read Eyes of the Dragon then watch Storm of the Century you'll see a character that embodies the character of Flagg almost perfectly. Its as if King didn't want to make it too obvious but just enough to satisfy our curiosity and make us wonder. Note, in Eyes of the Dragon that the magician Flagg has stones exactly like the ones Linoge had in Storm of the Century. Note to how the power of Flagg comes from his ability to manipulate others and make them turn against each other to accomplish his own goals.

You will want to know MORE, lots of whys and hows. However, David Lynch movies leave dis-satisfied but you know that seeing the movie again and again will unlock more mysteries and give you more clues to understand the movie.  Stephen King on the other hand gives you the best entertainment during the movie time yet, watching the movie a million time will leave you clueless because Stephen King deals with the super-natural things he introduces in his movies as normal things that need no explanation. In the Storm of the Century (I won't spoil the movie), we are introcued to this man-like person who does all sorts of supernatural things like killing people who are miles away from him, making things disappear, changing his looks,having silver vampire teeth every once in a while, a real wierdo.  And all the movie he is asking the people to 'give him what he wants and he will go away'.  Well, the hook ofthe movie for me was not what is it that this guy wants, nor was it the storm that cut off the island from the world, not the wierd deaths happening nor why did he kill this and not that,the hook for me was WHO was this man? Was he the devil? Was he an alien?  What was he? How did he get all these supernatural powers?Well, Stephen King offers a one liner explanation in the 5.5 hours running time of the series/movie which is most frustrating.  This movie is a masterpiece to watch, get entertained, get frightened without being disgusted from blood and all these slashers. However, if you are looking for more than entertainment,ifyou are looking for a movie analysis or a deep meaning to the super natural, then you will be as dis-satisfied as I was when the movie ended.I love Stephen King's works, I love his movies, they keep me excited from beginning to end so I decided I will watch his work in the future with that objective in mind: entertainment while it lasts. I see his movie and then life goes on, no analysis, no deep thinking, nothing. Just the mere entertainment and joy of watching his great build up of characters and classy horror.

It's a bit slow, long, but it's spooky, scary, terrifying, nightmarish, and it delivers an unforgettable message at the end. Vintage King.Now, for the rest...A weird guy shows up in an island in Maine (King's favorite State), and kills an old lady for no real reason. But he doesn't go away - he waits to get arrested. In this case, however, the real prisoners are the residents, some of whom are murdered in vicious ways by the stranger, with the help of his ominous-looking cane.Colm Feore is terrific in the role of the evil man, while Tim Daly does a decent job as the town grocer and Constable. The really cool thing about this film is that you never notice the length (close to 4 hours!), as scene after scene captures your imagination and tortures your soul.Small town mentalities and moralities are exposed for what they are - cheap, narrow, selfish, and deadly. Each character has (or has had) a past (or present) that they'd never like the world to ever know. But the stranger (the Legion) knows EVERYTHING about everyone.As secrets come out, and as hidden conflicts are brought out into the open, one can see the characters change faces. When the main objective of the stranger is revealed by him during a town meeting during the course of the storm, it's time for soul-searching and morals-testing. None emerges unscathed, except Tim Daly and his wife, though in completely opposite ways.The ending is definitely not satisfactory, and seems forced to deliver some sort of closure to the viewer.In summary- Positive things:1. Good, strong character development.2. Powerful storyline.3. Intelligent, relevant screenplay.4. Good photography.5. Excellent acting by most.6. Wonderful music score.Negative things:1. Length (some people will definitely groan!)2. Unsatisfactory ending.3. Colm Feore is not used very well.4.

Yet many King fans will attempt to associate it or transpose this work - don't bother. This movie is NOT based on any of his, or Bachman, books. Instead,  this is King's evolvolution into a a very visual movie producer attempting  to unbind himself from his book writing persona. He accomplishes this grand  task in &quot;Storm of the Century.&quot;Based on a Maine island  preparing for the snow storm of the century in 1989, the movie is based on  a stranger, Andre Linoge, who kills a elderly woman for no evident reason.  Then, he escalates into a bizarre evil force that captivates a small Maine  island whos occupants have a hard time dealing with the truth. Mr. Linoge  seems to know every evil act committed by the island's occupants: cheating,  lying, bodily harm, and adultery. Instead, they seem oddly comfortable  living in denial. &quot;Give Me What I Want And I Will Leave&quot; is the  ongoing testement for Mr. Linoge. His methodology for death, with the help  of his murderous cane, is often pointless and grotesque at times. The  significance of this cane is never mentioned. Yet I was very pleased and  quite surprised by Mr. King's ability to develop his characters so deeply.  The Constable, played by Tim Daly, is wonderfully acted and developed. In  &quot;Storm,&quot; viewers quickly become familiar with the many Islanders  only after the first hour. The unfortunate problem is that King doesn't  develop the antagonist, Andre Linoge (great acting by Colm Feore!), no  where nearly as some would have liked. Instead, throughout half of  &quot;Storm,&quot; you'll find Linoge's character sits and stares. When  Linoge does speak, it shows wasted time on and underdeveloped character.The ending is both vivid yet a letdown. Mr. Linoge's whole intent seems  overkill while the Islanders reactions often understated. I think viewers  will either love or hate it. Either way, viewers will enjoy the beautiful  scenery, vivid photography, and colorful charecters in &quot;Storm of the  Century.&quot;",3,King's Confusing Morality Play...,958262400,"05 14, 2000",2000,2084,"['Stephen', 'King', 'quot', 'Storm', 'Century', 'quot', 'good', 'flick', 'many', 'King', 'fans', 'will', 'attempt', 'associate', 'transpose', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'movie', 'NOT', 'based', 'Bachman', 'books', 'Instead', 'King', 'evolvolution', 'very', 'visual', 'movie', 'producer', 'attempting', 'unbind', 'book', 'writing', 'persona', 'grand', 'task', 'quot', 'Storm', 'Century.', 'quot', 'Based', 'Maine', 'island', 'preparing', 'snow', 'storm', 'century', '1989', 'movie', 'based', 'stranger', 'Andre', 'Linoge', 'who', 'elderly', 'woman', 'evident', 'reason', 'Then', 'bizarre', 'evil', 'force', 'small', 'Maine', 'island', 'whos', 'occupants', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'truth', 'Mr.', 'Linoge', 'know', 'evil', 'act', 'committed', 'island', 'occupants', 'cheating', 'lying', 'bodily', 'harm', 'adultery', 'Instead', 'seem', 'oddly', 'comfortable', 'living', 'denial', 'quot', 'Give', 'Me', 'What', 'Want', 'Will', 'Leave', 'quot', 'ongoing', 'testement', 'Mr.', 'Linoge', 'methodology', 'death', 'help', 'murderous', 'cane', 'often', 'pointless', 'grotesque', 'times', 'significance', 'cane', 'never', 'mentioned', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Mr.', 'King', 'ability', 'develop', 'characters', 'so', 'deeply', 'Constable', 'played', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'developed', 'quot', 'Storm', 'quot', 'viewers', 'quickly', 'become', 'familiar', 'many', 'Islanders', 'only', 'first', 'hour', 'unfortunate', 'problem', 'King', ""n't"", 'develop', 'antagonist', 'Andre', 'Linoge', 'great', 'acting', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'where', 'nearly', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Instead', 'half', 'quot', 'Storm', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Linoge', 'character', 'sits', 'stares', 'When', 'Linoge', 'speak', 'wasted', 'time', 'underdeveloped', 'character.The', 'ending', 'vivid', 'yet', 'letdown', 'Mr.', 'Linoge', 'whole', 'intent', 'overkill', 'Islanders', 'reactions', 'often', 'understated', 'think', 'viewers', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'way', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'vivid', 'photography', 'colorful', 'charecters', 'quot', 'Storm', 'Century.', 'quot']",N/A

While I thought the town would band together to fight the evil Linoge, it seems the sins of the past were more important and the town wanted to keep them buried.Who would think that among so much entertainment and so much evil, that there is an important lesson to be learned...",5,Good vs. Evil and Evil wins,1017619200,"04 1, 2002",2002,915,"['been', 'while', 'originally', 'saw', 'mini', 'series', 'TV', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'delightful', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'play', 'out', 'TV.Having', 'just', 'watched', 'entire', '256', 'minutes', 'straight', 'have', 'say', 'Storm', 'Century', 'riveting', 'entertaining', 'have', 'admit', 'much', 'fascination', 'mini', 'series', 'love', 'islands', 'coast', 'Maine', 'have', 'visited', 'many', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'imagine', 'pure', 'people', 'islands', 'may', 'hide', 'secrets', 'such', 'inhabitants', 'Little', 'Tall', 'Island.This', 'classic', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'story', 'more', 'realistic', 'yet', 'surprising', 'ending', 'thought', 'town', 'would', 'band', 'together', 'fight', 'evil', 'Linoge', 'sins', 'past', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'town', 'wanted', 'keep', 'buried.Who', 'would', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'entertainment', 'so', 'much', 'evil', 'important', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned']",N/A

190609,ABLBRUT8DALNN,1573625736,Todd Smith,"[0, 2]","Stephen King is a great writer, but even die hard fans of his work will agree that his films are hit or miss. Storm of The Century was one of his better novels, but was made for the big screen, not some PG rated mini-series. As a small island off the coast of Maine is hit with the most devastating storm in it's history, a stranger shows up and kill a beloved fixture on the island. The strange is quickly apprehended, but continues to wreak havoc, calming that he will go away if the towns people give him what he wants. I get that this was made for TV, but the fact is that if any of King's works deserved to be a regular R rated big screen film, it was this one. Almost everything worth while is cut out or toned down. Not to mention that in order to expand the story, to cover nearly 4 and a half hours worth of time, they had to put in a lot of things that wouldn't normally make it into a screenplay. There is so much unnecessary garbage in this thing that it completely destroys the story. Tim Daly was cast in the lead and all I can say is really? Honestly, Don Knotts made a more convincing cop than he did. The one bright spot in the film was Colm Feore, playing Andre Linoge, the mysterious stranger. He really was terrific and creepy at all the right moments. Aside from Feore, Storm of The Century wreaks of television and lacks all the suspense and horror of the original story. This is a fantastic read, but as a movie, Storm of The Century really doesn't cut it. My only hope is when they eventually remake it, they do it in the way King intended it to be.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,1573,"['Stephen', 'King', 'great', 'writer', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'work', 'will', 'agree', 'films', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Storm', 'Century', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'novels', 'was', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'not', 'PG', 'rated', 'mini-series', 'small', 'island', 'coast', 'Maine', 'hit', 'most', 'devastating', 'storm', 'history', 'stranger', 'up', 'kill', 'beloved', 'fixture', 'island', 'strange', 'quickly', 'apprehended', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'calming', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'towns', 'people', 'give', 'what', 'get', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'fact', 'King', 'works', 'deserved', 'be', 'regular', 'R', 'rated', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'Almost', 'everything', 'worth', 'cut', 'out', 'toned', 'down', 'Not', 'mention', 'order', 'expand', 'story', 'cover', 'nearly', '4', 'half', 'hours', 'time', 'had', 'put', 'lot', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'make', 'screenplay', 'so', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'garbage', 'thing', 'completely', 'story', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'was', 'cast', 'lead', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'Honestly', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'made', 'more', 'convincing', 'cop', 'did', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'was', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'playing', 'Andre', 'Linoge', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'really', 'was', 'terrific', 'creepy', 'right', 'moments', 'Aside', 'Feore', 'Storm', 'Century', 'wreaks', 'television', 'suspense', 'horror', 'original', 'story', 'fantastic', 'read', 'movie', 'Storm', 'Century', 'really', ""n't"", 'cut', 'My', 'only', 'hope', 'when', 'eventually', 'remake', 'do', 'way', 'King', 'intended', 'be']",N/A

190613,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,1573625736,Wayne C. Rogers,"[0, 0]","The movie, Storm of the Century, was written by Stephen King specifically for television and because of that most of the violence was down played and left to the viewer's imagination.  As King often says about television, ""the networks give and the networks take away.""  What this means is that the networks will give the time needed to broadcast a miniseries based on one of his stories, but they put a limit on the amount of violence that can be showed, especially when dealing with children.  As the writer and executive producer of Storm of the Century, King had to rely on creating scenes for the movie that were intense, but with the violence off screen.  In other words, the viewer never sees the cane actually hitting the old woman at the beginning, or the axe splitting someone's face, or an elderly lady drowning herself in a sink full of water, etc., etc.  This way, the movie leaves it to the viewer's imagination as to what takes place, which is sometimes good.  As the old saying goes, less is more.The story deals with an island town off the coast of Maine and the few hundred citizens that live there.  The part-time constable (played by Tim Daley) is also the owner of the local grocery store, while the town manager (played by Jeffrey DeMunn) is the local realtor.  As it begins, the town's people are stocking up on food in preparation for the worse storm of the century.  They know that they're going to be snowed in and unreachable from the mainland, but they're use to winter storms and know how to deal with them.  What they're not used to is the strange and malevolent visitor that suddenly appears from nowhere and beats a local resident to death with his cane and then waits for the constable to arrive.  The evil visitor is played to perfection by Colm Feore, and he unintentionally steals the movie away from the other actors with every scene that he's performing in.  In fact, he did such a great job that whenever I see him in another show or movie, I always think of him as Andre Linoge from this miniseries.  With his coal-black eyes and the gruesome smile that displays his four sharp incisors, Linoge is the villain of the century as he tells the town to give him what he wants and he'll go away.  Of course, it takes several deaths before the good and not-so-good citizens begin to understand that Linoge isn't your ordinary criminal and that a lot more people are going to die if they don't give in to his demands.  Tim Daley as the town's constable reflects the strength and moral attributes of a good person when he refuses to give into what Linoge wants; but, as in any small community, not all the citizens are pillars of society and many weaken rather quickly once the fear of the unknown sets in.  Though you can see the ending coming from a mile away, it still grips you within its claw-like hands when it finally arrives in the form of a town meeting and a decision has to be made that will change every person's life forever.I think Storm of the Century is one of the better miniseries based on a work by Stephen King.  Though it wouldn't hurt to cut thirty minutes from the show's four-hour length, the movie still manages to supply the viewer with what it promises--scares, edge-of-your-seat suspense, a frightening antagonist whose smile suggest that the best is still yet to come, and an ending that gives you food-for-thought about the goodness of mankind when push comes to shove.  This is a well-acted TV movie with good performances by all its actors, especially Colm Feore, Tim Daley, and the great Jeffrey DeMunn.  I've been a fan of DeMunn since he played the sheriff in the original movie version of The Hitcher.  His performances in each film since then have always been right on the mark, proving what a fantastic character actor he is.  The special effects, however, could be a little better, but then again this is television.  There is one scene where the town's people envision themselves walking off a long pier and into the ocean that was excellent.  Anyway, the DVD doesn't have much in the way extras, except for a feature-length commentary by Stephen King, which is definitely worth the price of admission.  It's not often that King does a commentary for one of his movies, so fans of the maestro of horror have to grab it where they can.

The medium does have its problems, but the story is well worth the wait.First the  length: yes, yes, yes, the story does drag a little. This four hour movie  could have been easily edited to three and a half or less hours with little  loss. But I suspect that the story would never have been produced unless it  could be formatted for a mini-series, hence the length.As for the story,  I was struck by the obvious parallelism with Nathaniel Hawthorne's Young  Goodman Brown. In each story the protagonist is confronted by the devil and  the community's sins are revealed one person at a time. Young Goodman  Brown's wife, Faith, is eventually shown to be a potential follower of the  devil, while Molly Anderson betrays her husband near the story's end.Apart from this parallelism, I don't see a lot of common ground between  these two stories. Storm of the Century appears to have a different theme:  can a community, so compromised by personal wrongs, be expected to make  sound moral decisions.One has to give Stephen King credit, he didn't  flinch from this issue.
