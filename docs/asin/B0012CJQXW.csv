The network  put it on some horrible time slot at 2AM or 2:30 AM on Sunday morning.  Some times I would watch it and catch myself dozing off since it came on so early.I did enjoy watching the TV Series. The networks kept changing the times it would come on. I had strong feeling they wanted to cancel it. The First TV Series ended with the explosion because it was going to be cancelled. Many fans wrote and complaining about the series being cancelled. It somehow it survived and came back as the outlaw years.  Although they did not even show the outlaw years on the network in my area.I did buy both sets seperatetly and watched them back to back. I enjoy the TV Series more than the outlaw years.  I really liked Hannah and I did not like her character being killed off. I think they took the heart out of the series when she left. Her character gave it a softness and gentleness that the outlaw years just does not have. Since it came on so early in the morning many people never even saw it at all.Get the series you will enjoy both of them. And viewing the hunk and a half gorgeous Eric McCormack on tv at 2AM was definelty a plus to. Wow! What a view!,5,Enjoyed Both Series,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1216,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'TV', 'Series', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'network', 'put', 'horrible', 'time', 'slot', '2AM', '2:30', 'AM', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'times', 'would', 'watch', 'catch', 'dozing', 'off', 'came', 'early.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'TV', 'Series', 'networks', 'kept', 'changing', 'times', 'would', 'come', 'had', 'strong', 'feeling', 'wanted', 'cancel', 'First', 'TV', 'Series', 'ended', 'explosion', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cancelled', 'Many', 'fans', 'wrote', 'complaining', 'series', 'being', 'cancelled', 'somehow', 'survived', 'came', 'back', 'outlaw', 'years', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'outlaw', 'years', 'network', 'area.I', 'did', 'buy', 'sets', 'seperatetly', 'watched', 'back', 'back', 'enjoy', 'TV', 'Series', 'more', 'outlaw', 'years', 'really', 'liked', 'Hannah', 'did', 'not', 'character', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'think', 'took', 'heart', 'series', 'when', 'left', 'character', 'gave', 'softness', 'gentleness', 'outlaw', 'years', 'just', 'not', 'have', 'came', 'so', 'early', 'morning', 'many', 'people', 'never', 'even', 'saw', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'viewing', 'hunk', 'half', 'gorgeous', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'tv', '2AM', 'was', 'definelty', 'plus', 'Wow', 'What', 'view']",Lonesome Dove: The Ultimate Collection

One of the best is Larry McMurtry's ""Lonesome Dove"" and we love watching it.  Neither one of us was aware of this television series inspired by the characters of Lonesome Dove, but we've really grown to enjoy it.  It picks up the story of Newt Call when he settles in the little town of Curtis Wells, Montana.  The first half of the disks are a bit too saccharine for my tastes, though the writing and acting is still good.  But the stories get a little grittier and the characters change a bit in the second half, ""The Outlaw Years.""  It's given us a great deal of enjoyment, watching a disk every Sunday afternoon for the past several weeks.

1136287,A3IPKOMED9Y2RO,B0012CJQXW,"Theresa ""ttyger""","[36, 37]","I am not particularly a western fan, but I do love Lonesome Dove the movie. Both ""The Series"" and ""The Outlaw Years"" were very engrossing and very enjoyable. For the most part, the stories and the characters carry you easily through spots of mediocre acting and directing and some, um, unusual filmmaking. The two series are quite different in tone and attitude. I let my seven year old watch ""The Series"", but not ""The Outlaw Years"" because of the increase in violence and change in the general mood.You don't get to find out what happens at the end of ""The Series"" until the first episode of ""The Outlaw Years"". It seems they intentionally left it open-ended to keep their options open.Then ""The Outlaw Years"" doen't 'end' at all. It just stops. Many developing threads are left hanging. It is as if it got cancelled mid-season.Lastly, the DVD production is less than stellar. The navigation is strange and the numbering and labeling on the DVDs is inconsistent or non-existent, but nothing that can't be worked out.Bottom line: Sometimes odd in its production, but completely worth watching.",4,Very enjoyable... many loose ends...,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,1094,"['am', 'not', 'particularly', 'western', 'fan', 'do', 'love', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'movie', 'Series', 'Outlaw', 'Years', 'were', 'very', 'engrossing', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'part', 'stories', 'characters', 'carry', 'easily', 'spots', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'directing', 'um', 'unusual', 'filmmaking', 'two', 'series', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'tone', 'attitude', 'let', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'Series', 'not', 'Outlaw', 'Years', 'increase', 'violence', 'change', 'general', 'mood.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'end', 'Series', 'first', 'episode', 'Outlaw', 'Years', 'intentionally', 'left', 'open-ended', 'keep', 'options', 'Outlaw', 'Years', 'doe', ""n't"", ""'end"", 'just', 'Many', 'developing', 'threads', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'got', 'cancelled', 'mid-season.Lastly', 'DVD', 'production', 'less', 'stellar', 'navigation', 'strange', 'numbering', 'labeling', 'DVDs', 'inconsistent', 'non-existent', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worked', 'out.Bottom', 'line', 'Sometimes', 'production', 'completely', 'worth', 'watching']",Lonesome Dove: The Ultimate Collection
