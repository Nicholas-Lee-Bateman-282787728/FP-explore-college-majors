Not to say Return of Jafar was a great movie either, but Jafar is one of Disney's best modern villains and an Aladdin movie without him is kind of weird.The Return of Jafar wasn't that great because of a lack of effort on the part of the animators and writers.  Aladdin &amp; the King of Theives wasn't great because it was missing the villain of the series; and he wasn't replaced with someone equally interesting.

400323,AOW7M9ULF0JND,6304089201,Alec Martin,"[0, 2]","You know, after about two movies, eighty-seven episodes, and countless spin-offs, you kind of have to get tired of something unless it holds up flawlessly for the longest time. Aladdin just ain't so. The King of Thieves' actual expectations and ambitions really weren't that high, in that it served to be a finale to the Aladdin TV series (and to the whole thing in general), in comparison to the Return of Jafar being the pilot for it. So in a way, we have the slightly obnoxious TV series to thank for this. Here's the unfortunate part - there's really nothing that Aladdin and the King of Thieves really adds. Return of Jafar definitely tied up loose ends; while there was no need for THAT, there certainly was no need for eighty-seven episodes and a third movie.Unfortunately, it shows, and it's unfortunate; there are definite ways in which King of Thieves is BETTER than the Return of Jafar. The animation is a lot more richer and sleeker, even if it is still at that sub-par level which spat on the second film. The colors are better, the movement is more focused, so that's definitely an improvement. However, in almost every other area, it fails in comparison; the performance, the story, the music, and in some cases the humor.The story goes like this: Aladdin and Jasmine are ready to have a weddin', but then they're target of a raid by the fabled, inept 40 Thieves; a bunch of second-rate criminals who sing. They're after some kind of ancient oracle that Aladdin has; and from the very oracle, which apparently knows everything (yeah, that's sparkling), it turns out the leader of these 40 Thieves is Aladdin's father, Cassim. It then launches into an 80+ minute adventure about Aladdin and the 40 Thieves, dealing with greed and money, and a bunch of familial issues. Yeah, there's nothing much else besides that.The biggest problem with the King of Thieves is pretty much this: it's NOT interesting. Despite it's story having a better concept than the Return of Jafar, the execution just feels repetitive and it more or less just feels like a long telemovie. Robin Williams finally returns, after being evidently absent from the last movie, but he serves for nothing more than to serve gag-worthy gags. There are a lot of good wedding jokes he makes, but after that beginning, it just gets... boring. Genie serves no purpose. Cassim is thankfully a decent enough character to support this story arc; he's got that personality that makes you want to love him, despite the fact that he ditched our hero. The series' new villain, a gray-skinned, abnormally strong, stupid man named Sa'luk... he's just purely there because they need a villain. Jafar was interesting because he had a personality that was interesting in its pure evil nature; Sa'luk wants power, and money, and fame, and he has such little personality that I end up not giving a damn about him. When compared to Jafar, hell, any villain, he's got no development or center of interest.Musically, King of Thieves also does a lot worse. It opens with a Genie-led song, ""A Party In Agrabah""; it's good to see Robin Williams back, but all of the gags just end up flat. When we are introduced to the 40 Thieves, they sing a little ditty called ""Welcome To The Forty Thieves"", arguably the film's worst. It's got an all-too familiar melody, bad rhymes, and just plain sucks; there's nothing funny nor clever about it. Genie's second song, ""Father and Son"" is far too light-hearted and predictable to be worth of any real value; it has some good woodwinds, I suppose, but it conveys the same idea as the previous track I mentioned; dull, throwaway, unmemorable. Sa'luk gets his moment in ""Are You In Or Out?"", which is supposed to be a 'rousing' call to action. While the big guy does have some clever lines when he begins, the minute the remnants of the 40 Thieves join in, it instantly just sucks.The only piece that holds some promise is 'Out Of Thin Air', a slow, string-led piece in 2. It's the first duet between Aladdin and Jasmine that isn't love, and despite its painfully familiar lines, it's a beautiful little piece. It's a shame the vibe and prose of this track didn't carry over into the rest of it.Despite my ranting of it, King of Thieves is far from terrible; it does things better than Return of Jafar, but it also does things worse. At best, it serves a way to wrap things up with a few moments of brilliance and humor. At worst, it serves an as unwelcome distraction with a second rate story made with profoundly second rate execution. (Pun not intended) It is at least better than a multitude of Disney sequels that followed it - for more than a damn decade - and does have one lovable character, it could of been done so much better.",2,"""Here's the path I (don't) recommend""",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,4725,"['know', 'two', 'movies', 'eighty-seven', 'episodes', 'countless', 'spin-offs', 'kind', 'have', 'get', 'tired', 'something', 'up', 'flawlessly', 'longest', 'time', 'Aladdin', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'King', 'Thieves', 'actual', 'expectations', 'ambitions', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'high', 'served', 'be', 'finale', 'Aladdin', 'TV', 'series', 'whole', 'thing', 'general', 'comparison', 'Return', 'Jafar', 'being', 'pilot', 'So', 'way', 'have', 'slightly', 'obnoxious', 'TV', 'series', 'thank', 'Here', 'unfortunate', 'part', 'really', 'nothing', 'Aladdin', 'King', 'Thieves', 'really', 'Return', 'Jafar', 'definitely', 'tied', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'was', 'need', 'certainly', 'was', 'need', 'eighty-seven', 'episodes', 'third', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'unfortunate', 'are', 'definite', 'ways', 'King', 'Thieves', 'BETTER', 'Return', 'Jafar', 'animation', 'lot', 'more', 'richer', 'sleeker', 'even', 'still', 'sub-par', 'level', 'spat', 'second', 'film', 'colors', 'are', 'better', 'movement', 'more', 'focused', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'However', 'almost', 'other', 'area', 'comparison', 'performance', 'story', 'music', 'cases', 'humor.The', 'story', 'Aladdin', 'Jasmine', 'are', 'ready', 'have', 'weddin', 'then', ""'re"", 'target', 'raid', 'fabled', 'inept', '40', 'Thieves', 'bunch', 'second-rate', 'criminals', 'who', 'sing', ""'re"", 'kind', 'ancient', 'oracle', 'Aladdin', 'very', 'oracle', 'apparently', 'everything', 'yeah', 'sparkling', 'out', 'leader', '40', 'Thieves', 'Aladdin', 'father', 'Cassim', 'then', '80+', 'minute', 'adventure', 'Aladdin', '40', 'Thieves', 'dealing', 'greed', 'money', 'bunch', 'familial', 'issues', 'Yeah', 'nothing', 'much', 'else', 'that.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'King', 'Thieves', 'pretty', 'much', 'NOT', 'interesting', 'story', 'having', 'better', 'concept', 'Return', 'Jafar', 'execution', 'just', 'feels', 'repetitive', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'feels', 'long', 'telemovie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'finally', 'being', 'evidently', 'absent', 'last', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'serve', 'gag-worthy', 'gags', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'wedding', 'jokes', 'beginning', 'just', 'boring', 'Genie', 'purpose', 'Cassim', 'thankfully', 'decent', 'enough', 'character', 'support', 'story', 'arc', 'got', 'personality', 'want', 'love', 'fact', 'ditched', 'hero', 'series', 'new', 'villain', 'gray-skinned', 'abnormally', 'strong', 'stupid', 'man', 'named', ""Sa'luk"", 'just', 'purely', 'there', 'need', 'villain', 'Jafar', 'was', 'interesting', 'had', 'personality', 'was', 'interesting', 'pure', 'evil', 'nature', ""Sa'luk"", 'power', 'money', 'fame', 'such', 'little', 'personality', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'giving', 'damn', 'When', 'compared', 'Jafar', 'hell', 'villain', 'got', 'development', 'center', 'interest.Musically', 'King', 'Thieves', 'also', 'lot', 'worse', 'Genie-led', 'song', 'A', 'Party', 'Agrabah', 'good', 'see', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'back', 'gags', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'flat', 'When', 'are', 'introduced', '40', 'Thieves', 'sing', 'little', 'ditty', 'called', 'Welcome', 'Forty', 'Thieves', 'arguably', 'film', 'worst', 'got', 'all-too', 'familiar', 'melody', 'bad', 'rhymes', 'just', 'plain', 'sucks', 'nothing', 'funny', 'clever', 'Genie', 'second', 'song', 'Father', 'Son', 'far', 'too', 'light-hearted', 'predictable', 'be', 'worth', 'real', 'value', 'good', 'woodwinds', 'suppose', 'same', 'idea', 'previous', 'track', 'mentioned', 'dull', 'throwaway', 'unmemorable', ""Sa'luk"", 'moment', 'Are', 'Out', 'supposed', 'be', ""'rousing"", 'call', 'action', 'big', 'guy', 'have', 'clever', 'lines', 'when', 'minute', 'remnants', '40', 'Thieves', 'join', 'instantly', 'just', 'sucks.The', 'only', 'piece', 'promise', ""'Out"", 'Thin', 'Air', 'slow', 'string-led', 'piece', '2', 'first', 'duet', 'Aladdin', 'Jasmine', ""n't"", 'love', 'painfully', 'familiar', 'lines', 'beautiful', 'little', 'piece', 'shame', 'vibe', 'prose', 'track', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'over', 'rest', 'it.Despite', 'ranting', 'King', 'Thieves', 'far', 'terrible', 'things', 'better', 'Return', 'Jafar', 'also', 'things', 'worse', 'best', 'way', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'few', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'humor', 'worst', 'unwelcome', 'distraction', 'second', 'rate', 'story', 'made', 'profoundly', 'second', 'rate', 'execution', 'Pun', 'not', 'intended', 'least', 'better', 'multitude', 'Disney', 'sequels', 'followed', 'more', 'damn', 'decade', 'have', 'one', 'lovable', 'character', 'could', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Aladdin and the King of Thieves VHS

The best character is Aladdin's long-lost father - Cassim, the leader of the legendary forty thieves.  A little Temple of Doom, a little swashbuckling, a little Sinbad, great costume designs, a lot of action and adventure, and a surprisingly thoughtful script.  A must-have for Disney and Aladdin fans.The story begins as Al and Jasime prepare to be wed.  The wedding is interrupted by the mysterious King of Thieves, after a treasure in Jasmine's wedding gifts.  Aladdin seeks to have a relationship with his father, but how can he if their lifestyles are so different?  Or are they really the same?

400346,A3M81YQA9Z6F0W,6304089201,M. Fisher,"[0, 0]","All the Disney DTV sequels--or, as we sometimes refer to them in our homes, ""cheap-quels""--have been bad.  Or horrible.  My problem with most of them is not actually with the movie itself, but with the all-but-inevitable leeching off of the original. Continuing a story that's already resolved or telling the same story as the first one are the M.O. for your average cheapquel--not remotely entertaining, just a ploy to make moneyThe surprising thing about this movie is the fact that it ISN'T your average cheapquel. There may be an element of nostalgia in this review, but watching it again recently, I was surprised at how much of it still actually stood up as a decent movie, with actual quality in it.  Despite the unavoidable stealing from the previous movies, this one actually DOES present some new material--and much of the story told is very creative and interesting.  The new characters add a dimension to the old characters and the world that they inhabit, rather than simply ripping off or rehashing the first or second movie.  The forty thieves and Caseem are interesting with their individual ways of fighting and talking.  The Vanishing Isle is especially amazing, coming in a DTV feature, and the Oracle, despite some flaws, has an amazingly cool design and quality effects surrounding it.  That sort of thought in character and design is exactly the kind of thing that the original Disney encouraged.  Also, this movie didn't contradict already-existing characters' traits; this is another of my pet peeves.  Aladdin was clearly himself, with no made-up flaws or strengths added to him--the same goes for the Genie and even Jasmine, Abu, Carpet, and Iago.  (The only exception was Jasmine's sudden expertise in karate, but I suppose this was because it was the 90's, when every female was a black-belt--no matter their background or age.)The fact that they made the movie stand (relatively) alone is a great tribute to the makers as well.  The original plan was to use a character from the TV show, Mozenrath, and reveal him to be Aladdin's brother.  The fact that they had the confidence in their own storytelling abilities to scrap that plan and go with introducing Aladdin's father made the film much more interesting, opening up more possibilities for the story and the characters.  Many of the sequences in the film are amazingly creative--again, see the Vanishing Isle sequence--and many of them are actually moving--the Challenge is surprisingly gripping, with effects like rim lighting and shadows.The animation, all in all, is better than your average TV show--which is what the animators were used to working on.  The music, especially the score, performs surprisingly well for what its status in a cheapquel movie would entail.  The voices, especially Caseem, Saluk, and of course the Genie (Robin Williams is back!) gave the movie, again, something new.All in all, this movie is surprisingly well done, in every sense.  Though not feature quality, it's the only one of its kind that seems to get past being the sequel to a very successful movie, offering new material and creative ideas.  For what it should have been, it is amazingly good.  I'd at least give it a rent, if not a buy--even if it does drift to the back of your video drawer, it's a pleasant surprise to pull out on a rainy day.",4,Suprising,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,3323,"['Disney', 'DTV', 'sequels', 'sometimes', 'refer', 'homes', 'cheap-quels', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'horrible', 'problem', 'most', 'not', 'actually', 'movie', 'all-but-inevitable', 'leeching', 'original', 'Continuing', 'story', 'already', 'resolved', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'M.O', 'average', 'cheapquel', 'not', 'remotely', 'entertaining', 'just', 'ploy', 'make', 'moneyThe', 'surprising', 'thing', 'movie', 'fact', ""N'T"", 'average', 'cheapquel', 'may', 'be', 'element', 'nostalgia', 'review', 'watching', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'still', 'actually', 'stood', 'up', 'decent', 'movie', 'actual', 'quality', 'unavoidable', 'stealing', 'previous', 'movies', 'one', 'actually', 'DOES', 'present', 'new', 'material', 'much', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'creative', 'interesting', 'new', 'characters', 'add', 'dimension', 'old', 'characters', 'world', 'inhabit', 'rather', 'simply', 'ripping', 'off', 'rehashing', 'first', 'second', 'movie', 'forty', 'thieves', 'Caseem', 'are', 'interesting', 'individual', 'ways', 'fighting', 'talking', 'Vanishing', 'Isle', 'especially', 'amazing', 'coming', 'DTV', 'feature', 'Oracle', 'flaws', 'amazingly', 'cool', 'design', 'quality', 'effects', 'surrounding', 'sort', 'thought', 'character', 'design', 'exactly', 'kind', 'thing', 'original', 'Disney', 'encouraged', 'Also', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'contradict', 'already-existing', 'characters', 'traits', 'pet', 'peeves', 'Aladdin', 'was', 'clearly', 'made-up', 'flaws', 'strengths', 'added', 'same', 'Genie', 'even', 'Jasmine', 'Abu', 'Carpet', 'Iago', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'Jasmine', 'sudden', 'expertise', 'karate', 'suppose', 'was', 'was', '90', 'when', 'female', 'was', 'black-belt', 'matter', 'background', 'age', 'fact', 'made', 'movie', 'stand', 'relatively', 'alone', 'great', 'tribute', 'makers', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'plan', 'was', 'use', 'character', 'TV', 'show', 'Mozenrath', 'reveal', 'be', 'Aladdin', 'brother', 'fact', 'had', 'confidence', 'own', 'storytelling', 'abilities', 'scrap', 'plan', 'go', 'introducing', 'Aladdin', 'father', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'opening', 'up', 'more', 'possibilities', 'story', 'characters', 'Many', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'amazingly', 'creative', 'again', 'see', 'Vanishing', 'Isle', 'sequence', 'many', 'are', 'actually', 'moving', 'Challenge', 'surprisingly', 'gripping', 'effects', 'rim', 'lighting', 'shadows.The', 'animation', 'better', 'average', 'TV', 'show', 'what', 'animators', 'were', 'used', 'working', 'music', 'especially', 'score', 'performs', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'what', 'status', 'cheapquel', 'movie', 'would', 'entail', 'voices', 'especially', 'Caseem', 'Saluk', 'course', 'Genie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'back', 'gave', 'movie', 'again', 'something', 'new.All', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'sense', 'not', 'feature', 'quality', 'only', 'one', 'kind', 'get', 'past', 'being', 'sequel', 'very', 'successful', 'movie', 'offering', 'new', 'material', 'creative', 'ideas', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'amazingly', 'good', ""'d"", 'least', 'give', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'even', 'drift', 'back', 'video', 'drawer', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'pull', 'out', 'rainy', 'day']",Aladdin and the King of Thieves VHS

Aladdin finds out that his father is still alive and goes on a quest to find him and rescue him from the Forty Thieves. Aladdin finds out that is his father Cassim is the King of Thieves. Father and son reunite and go looking for the Hand of Midas. Find the Hand and Cassim realizes that his greatest gift is his son, tosses the hand into the sea. Aladdin and Princess Jasmine get married while Cassim watches from a distance because he is still a criminal. Cassim and Iago ride off to the sunset. To get a better dicription of this movie go to this website: [...]. For me this was nothing more then Genie singing and showing off during the entire movie and some of Robin Williams scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. Also there is a major goof in this movie as well. At the end of Aladdin, Genie is given his freedom and his arm bands were removed. In this film however, the genie still has his arm bands. Even in the Return of Jafar there are no arm bands on Genie's wrists. During the first thirty minutes there was one musical number after another and some could have been left out.

I rented ""Jafar"" when it was released, watched it for the first 15 mins., then turned off the VCR in disgust. Everything about it was cheap: cheap story, cheap animation, and cheap execution. It was barely up to Saturday morning cartoon fare, let alone Disney's high standards. Especially disappointing was the exclusion of the comic genius of Robin Williams; didn't Disney realize his voice IS the Genie? A glaring oversight on their part.Thank goodness they made up for it with this concluding sequel to the Aladdin saga. While a notch below the original, AATKOT restored most of the magic missing from ""Jafar"".The subplot of Aladdin getting to know his long-lost, charmingly roguish father was well-handled and poignant. But as with the original film, Williams stole the show as the mischievous and all-powerful Genie, a perfect character for Williams to morph from one impersonation and/or satirical situation into another.I had it on VHS, but definitely want it on DVD to add to my Disney collection.

The list of direct-to-video stinkers made by Disney seems to be endless. Fortunately, Aladdin and the King of Thieves is the exception.Released early on before Disney decided to defile it animated classics, Aladdin and the King of Thieves features a solid, new storyline that does not simply rehash the original. Maybe this extra attempt at quality was made to get Robin Williams to reprise one of his coolest roles? After two movies and countless tv episodes, Aladdin and Jasmine are finally getting married. Then the forty thieves show up and trash the wedding, and Aladdin goes on a quest to find his father and a unique treasure with the golden touch. While not targeted to older kids like Disney's Atlantis was, this movie is slightly darker than the two that came before it, which is a good thing. A lot of this comes from the forty thieves, who sing about robbing, plundering, in an endearing kind of way. There is a sword duel conveyed in hellish reds, murky blues, and shadows, and lightning is used to symbolize Aladdin being wounded. And the villain's demise is quite original, not the usual ""falling to their death"" we've seen over and over. In fact, I daresay Atlantis even borrowed the demise for their film's climax. All in all, it's an entertaining, never-boring, thrill ride, and ties up the saga nicely, with a nod to the street merchant who began this whole thing.The songs in Aladdin and the King of Thieves are not up the quality of the original, but they are much better than all the other Disney DTV's. The two songs the forty thieves sing are quite hilarious and memorable, the romance song didn't make me cringe at all, and the opening number gets the ball rolling really well. The only semi-clunker is the father and son song, but that wasn't bad either. The animation isn't cinema-quality, but it's also above-average and commendable. My only curiosity with this movie is some of the Genie's jokes. The animators went with whatever ad-libs Robin Williams came up with, and even after six years of watching this movie, I still can't understand most of them, especially the homages to past comedians. This is the only part children won't understand.Aladdin and the King of Thieves is a high-quality Disney DTV, and as things stand, their ONLY high-quality release ever.

THE RETURN OF JAFAR was a trasy disappointment....And now Aladdin has his final adventures as the trilogy comes to a close in this final episode, ALADDIN AND THE KING OF  THIEVES.  The best part was by far Robin Williams' return as the great blue  Geenie.  But another pleasent suprise was a fresh, orginial plot (compared  especially to THE RETURN OF JAFAR's reused plot), and entertaining new  characters (such as the Forty Thieves).However, the music is no better  than THE RETURN OF JAFAR's.  Not even the big fanale song.  I wish we hadd  Alen Meken and Tim Rice back.  Their music for the first ALADDIN film was  extrodnary! I'll never forget how they helped Aladdin show his princess a  whole new world!  The visual effects were a  treat, though, and made up for  the loss of good music.  The Geenie's scenes were extreamly elebrate, and  the scenes featuring the Hand of Midis were also nicely done.It was also  nice for Aladdin to find relations, but his father's excuses for not being  there for Aladdin when he needed him were extreamly poor. As bad as THE  RETURN OF JAFAR was (in my opinion). And if you've seen my review of it,  you know how I feel.To sum everything up, ALADDIN AND THE KING OF  THIEVES was a treat, but still not as 100% classic as ALADDIN was.  It was  enjoyable to find that Disney obviously learned their lesson after the  trashy THE RETURN OF JAFAR.
