481686,A1C58YXM2A30CY,630587493X,,"[3, 3]","Recent reviews on robots and androids made me curious about The Bicentennial Man, directed by one of my fav directors, Chris Columbus (who had done a great job on Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone and the Harry Potter films) and one of my fav comedians, Robin Williams.Despite being marketed to the 1999 audiences of the time as a ""hilarious comedy"" it certainly was not!  Themes of euthanasia, corporate greed and death were certainly not funny nor for kids -- though older children may enjoy it.The film is about a robot who is delivered to a home to perform basic chores, except for one thing.  He has a heart and emotions and desires, impossible to program into a robot and is an anomaly.Being familiar with Isaac Asimov (on whose story the film is based), it was humorous to see the Three Law of Robotics emblazoned in a head- projector in the living room, to the consternation of the family!The family takes awhile to get used to the robot.  One girl lets the robot jump out a window!  Fear of windows and heights is briefly played.  Another has the robot (Andrew) get splashed with sand and he says, ""I understand now why some animals eat their young!""Williams' performance is understated -- but when he runs into trouble or is dealing with a ""fact of life"", he states ""That will not do!"" and immediately does something about it.  People die?  Wear out?  What's up with that?The film deals with time quickly -- we're ten years ahead, then 15 more, then 20 more and so on.  In each scene, the robot is still young, immortal, learning, while his family whom he has taken care of for  many years is dying away.The whole film is a fascinating journey into the human condition.Several points of interest:  Seeking out his own kind, years in the making, finally runs into a woman robot who plays 100 year old rock tunes out of her hip!  Following her, he finds the son of the man who invented his model in the first place!  With Rupert Burns' help, Andrew invents amazing biological devices that extend human life.But he wants freedom, love, these intangibles.Another point of interest:  He feels jealousy, which surprises him.  And love, which astonishes him.  When Andrew finds that he could actually be made to ""perform as a man"" by inventor Rupert, Andrew says of sex: ""It takes you to heaven, makes you as one, and then you come back and your love is at your side.""  Rupert:  ""Wish I could have that!""Yes, there is comedy.  And yes there is the future San Francisco with the huge buildings and the amazing cable cars (yes, they're still there!) and flying trucks and trams.The film is about the human condition.  Enjoy!  And bring a box of Kleenex, will you?Directed byChris ColumbusWriting creditsIsaac Asimov  (short story ""The Bicentennial Man"")Isaac Asimov  (novel ""The Positronic Man"") andRobert Silverberg  (novel ""The Positronic Man"")Nicholas Kazan  (screenplay)Cast:Robin Williams ...

481694,A1GOI8745FGIDN,630587493X,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[1, 1]","Similar to ""Artificial Intelligence,"" this movie is about the possibility of man creating a new form of life.  Robots are mass produced, which somewhat resemble humans, and are meant to serve some purpose.  In the case of Andrew, his purpose was to be a butler to a family.  It turned out that he became a member of the family, being treated more and more like a human than a machine as he evolved.  His owner realized that he had feelings and thoughts that none of the other robots had.  So he allowed the robot to read books and that began his journey.  He learned how to make crafts, and that's what he did in his spare time.  He eventually earned a very high income and his owner let him keep the money for himself, even opening a bank account for him.  He gets modifications done, first to allow his face to express the feelings he feels, and eventually getting a nervous system, artificial organs, skin, and a human face.  He desires freedom and his owner eventually gives him that- he builds his own house and supports himself.  He eventually falls in love with the decendant of his original owner's daughter (he lives to be 200 years old hence the title).  They want to get married but the law won't allow her to marry a ""robot.""  So he completes his evolution to the point where he is considered human by congress.  He pleaded before them saying that just because he has artificial organs does not disqualify him from being human because many humans have artificial organs that he himself invented.  It seems that the final requirement of congress for him to be considered human, and thus legally able to marry another human, is that his body age and eventually die.  So he ""acheives"" this.I guess the movie was supposed to be inspiring how the robot wants so badly to become more and more human.  But basically he had all the attributes of humans only more-- he had greater intelligence, memory, and calculating abilities, he did not require sleep or food, he could never age or die, he was capable of self-maintenence, etc.  I could understand him wanting upgrades but not wanting to downgrade from posthuman to human.  He could have lived with her just the same only without being legally married.In this movie, the robot is benign to humans.  However, if man did ever create artificial intelligence like this, a being that could think and feel on its own, it wouldn't necessarily be so nice to us.  And by its more advanced nature it could potentially break free from our control.  I think robots and machines should be advanced, but not given feelings.  They are supposed to be our servants, not our family.  We already know how to create people, but machines are supposed to serve us and if they were given feelings it would start to become unethical to make them work for us.  Also, if the robot could evolve towards being human, wouldn't it be likely then that humans could evolve towards being robotic?  They could keep the human attributes they want while taking on desirable robot features.  Imagine how much more fun and productivity we could get out of life by not requiring sleep.  Imagine how much faster we could learn if we could implant a computer chip into our brain.  Imagine being able to live through two centuries-- or longer.  If we ever decided we didn't want to live any longer, like the robot, we could end our existence at any time.Like ""Artificial Intelligence,"" this movie attempts to bring about the issues that will face us in the future-- rapidly escalating technology, posthumanism, robots/ computers that could potentially become humans, etc.  However, I think both movies do a poor job of effectively presenting the issues.  They really only introduce the concepts and nothing more.  If you want to learn more, just do an internet search of ""transhumanism"" or ""posthumanism.""  I liked Bicentenial Man better than AI because its funny.  That robot really was cute and funny at times like in its reaction to when its owner explained sex to him, or how it gives people insults unknowingly, etc.",4,"Good, but not complete or realistic about the Posthuman.",1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,4036,"['Similar', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'movie', 'possibility', 'man', 'creating', 'new', 'form', 'life', 'Robots', 'are', 'mass', 'produced', 'somewhat', 'resemble', 'humans', 'are', 'meant', 'serve', 'purpose', 'case', 'Andrew', 'purpose', 'was', 'be', 'butler', 'family', 'turned', 'out', 'became', 'member', 'family', 'being', 'treated', 'more', 'more', 'human', 'machine', 'evolved', 'owner', 'realized', 'had', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'none', 'other', 'robots', 'had', 'allowed', 'robot', 'read', 'books', 'began', 'journey', 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'crafts', 'what', 'did', 'spare', 'time', 'eventually', 'earned', 'very', 'high', 'income', 'owner', 'let', 'keep', 'money', 'even', 'opening', 'bank', 'account', 'modifications', 'done', 'first', 'allow', 'face', 'express', 'feelings', 'eventually', 'getting', 'nervous', 'system', 'artificial', 'organs', 'skin', 'human', 'face', 'freedom', 'owner', 'eventually', 'that-', 'own', 'house', 'eventually', 'love', 'decendant', 'original', 'owner', 'daughter', 'be', '200', 'years', 'old', 'hence', 'title', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'law', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'marry', 'robot', 'evolution', 'point', 'where', 'considered', 'human', 'congress', 'pleaded', 'saying', 'just', 'artificial', 'organs', 'not', 'disqualify', 'being', 'human', 'many', 'humans', 'have', 'artificial', 'organs', 'invented', 'final', 'requirement', 'congress', 'be', 'considered', 'human', 'thus', 'legally', 'able', 'marry', 'human', 'body', 'age', 'eventually', 'die', 'acheives', 'this.I', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspiring', 'how', 'robot', 'so', 'badly', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'human', 'basically', 'had', 'attributes', 'humans', 'only', 'more', 'had', 'greater', 'intelligence', 'memory', 'calculating', 'abilities', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'sleep', 'food', 'could', 'never', 'age', 'die', 'was', 'capable', 'self-maintenence', 'etc', 'could', 'understand', 'wanting', 'upgrades', 'not', 'wanting', 'downgrade', 'posthuman', 'human', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'just', 'same', 'only', 'being', 'legally', 'married.In', 'movie', 'robot', 'benign', 'humans', 'However', 'man', 'did', 'ever', 'create', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'being', 'could', 'think', 'feel', 'own', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'be', 'so', 'nice', 'more', 'advanced', 'nature', 'could', 'potentially', 'break', 'free', 'control', 'think', 'robots', 'machines', 'should', 'be', 'advanced', 'not', 'given', 'feelings', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'servants', 'not', 'family', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'create', 'people', 'machines', 'are', 'supposed', 'serve', 'were', 'given', 'feelings', 'would', 'start', 'become', 'unethical', 'make', 'work', 'Also', 'robot', 'could', 'evolve', 'towards', 'being', 'human', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'likely', 'then', 'humans', 'could', 'evolve', 'towards', 'being', 'robotic', 'could', 'keep', 'human', 'want', 'taking', 'desirable', 'robot', 'features', 'Imagine', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'productivity', 'could', 'get', 'life', 'not', 'requiring', 'sleep', 'Imagine', 'how', 'much', 'faster', 'could', 'learn', 'could', 'implant', 'computer', 'chip', 'brain', 'Imagine', 'being', 'able', 'live', 'two', 'centuries', 'longer', 'ever', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'longer', 'robot', 'could', 'end', 'existence', 'time.Like', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'movie', 'bring', 'issues', 'will', 'face', 'future', 'rapidly', 'escalating', 'technology', 'posthumanism', 'robots/', 'computers', 'could', 'potentially', 'become', 'humans', 'etc', 'However', 'think', 'movies', 'do', 'poor', 'job', 'effectively', 'presenting', 'issues', 'really', 'only', 'introduce', 'concepts', 'nothing', 'more', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'just', 'do', 'internet', 'search', 'transhumanism', 'posthumanism', 'liked', 'Bicentenial', 'Man', 'better', 'AI', 'funny', 'robot', 'really', 'was', 'cute', 'funny', 'times', 'reaction', 'when', 'owner', 'explained', 'sex', 'how', 'people', 'insults', 'unknowingly', 'etc']",Bicentennial Man

What sounded like good Robin Williams movie is a bad piece of film work. He acts like a man in a robot suit, even when he finally wears clothes.Starring Robin Williams as Andrew the Android, I expected the movie to have the dramatic excellence he showed in ""Awakenings"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" It isn't there. His acting is canned, reeking of predictability. Known for his comedic strength and range of vocalizations, his personality shows up mechanical. The casting director might as well have chosen Anson ""Potsie Webber"" Williams instead of Robin.The plot of the robot becoming human is old in SF circles. Isaac Asimov gave the screenwriter the same story as seen in many ""Outer Limits"" and ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, minus the succinct, intelligent writing that defined both shows. It draws out too long, and tries to carry too many transitions that should have been left in the original novel, ""The Positronic Man."" ""Dances With Wolves,"" in its 236 minutes, seems shorter than this 131 minute fiasco.One scenes which caused me to cringe was Andrew's preaching to the World Council about what makes a man. John Merrick said it more powerfully in one sentence, ""I am a man, not an animal"" in ""The Elephant Man."" Instead, we get a soliloquy by Andrew.Overloaded with morality messages, ""Bicentennial Man"" tries to tell us that people are different, that not all marriages need be procreative, that laws should be passed to validate the humanity of some people, that big corporations are bad, that artificial implants make for artificial people, and that euthanasia is no big deal. There are a few more statements beyond that had me shaking my head.The ideological cliches presented are akin to ""My Favorite Martian,"" with a dash of the Robot in ""Lost in Space,"" and some portion of ""Terminator.""The basic theme that humanity is not what we are but who we are is so oversold. By the time the credits came, I felt as if I had an Ayn Rand novel crammed down my throat.

Beeman,"[59, 64]","Based on the Isaac Asimov short story &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; which was later adapted by Robert Silverberg in &quot;The Positronic Man,&quot; director Chris Columbus has managed to merge a powerful romantic epic with Asimov's intellectual story.The story was written to celebrate the 1976 Bicentennial of the USA and Asimov's story told about a robot that strives to be human.  While this is a very prevalent idea nowadays, i.e. Data on Star Trek, it was pretty original at that time.Columbus shows wonderful respect for the source material, which he betters in every way.  How often can you say that of a movie?  Columbus understands that in the future everything will not be immediately different.  The film portray this by slowly adding futuristic elements on top of real settings.  In an era of CGI sets that don't look real, this sci-fi movie is all the better for it's matter of fact approach to the future.The performances are uniformly great with Williams giving such a strong performance beneath the costume that when his face is revealed it is a little startling.  He also injects a sense of humor that makes more powerful the romance and pathos of the plot.This is a film that deserved better than it got.  It is an epic, in the sense of Tolstoy and &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, with a science fiction worldview.In this film of a robot's search to become more human, we feel more strongly the precious gift of our own humanity.

Eventually he makes so many beautiful clocks that Mr. Martin sells them, and opens a bank account for Andrew to receive the fruit of his labors. An android with a bank account?

This is definitely a good one. Asimov was not a shoot-em-up kind of storyteller. His characters talk to each other and resolve their disputes in discussion. Commander Data from Star Trek The Next Generation owes a lot to Asimov's creations, and especially to this story, where a robot strives to become like a human being. If the story's premise strikes you as silly, it was just as silly when the story was about a wooden doll or a dead man brought to life in a laboratory.Robin Williams does a commendable job in this film. Those expecting the off-the-wall smart remarks and antics that are his trademark might be disappointed. Williams played this one straight and low-key.The look to this film is remarkable, too. The characters and the world it portrays are distinctly modern, affluent, upper-class. You won't find much grease or grime here, save in the roboticist's laboratory. The buildings get bigger and glossier; the vehicles lose their wheels and start levitating; the costumes get a bit more sleek; but there is nothing here that is too far out. It is a far cry from Blade Runner or Johnny Mnemonic, and is very &quot;clean.&quot; I couldn't even tell you if Disney made this, but it has the Disney feel to it; or perhaps the Disney theme park feel to it.Bicentennial Man is most definitely science fiction, but it is also very different from any SF that I have seen on the screen before.

The film needs to be seen: it is a true epic, spanning not only the 21st century, but ultimately moving into the 23rd!The production works on many levels.  Robin Williams' robot character benefits from the technology (our present day technology) that has resulted in his manufacture -- and, ultimately, that careening technology enables him to become incrementally more human-like. Of course, the humans are simultaneously becoming incrementally more bionic, another result of the technology.The screenplay is quite engaging.  Andrew (the android) immediately develops a fascinating relationship with his &quot;owner&quot;, a character he calls &quot;Mister&quot;, played quite well by Sam Neill.  Since Andrew is more or less immortal, as the decades move along in steady progression, he is later depicted as relating meaningfully with Mister's children, grandchildren --and great-grandchild. All the while, Andrew is incessantly learning, &quot;growing&quot;, and evolving.  Indeed, the theme of evolution is central to the unfolding of the story.  We witness the evolution of society as well, in the background -- and what a fascinating vision it is.  Negativity and antagonism seem to be evaporating in this intriguingly depicted future life.As a Northern Californian I was delighted to see what was done with San Francisco, for example.  Two hundred years from now the cable cars are completely unchanged. The Golden Gate Bridge is instantly recognizable, despite that fact that it now has an upper deck!  The world-famous Glide Memorial Cathedral is quite the same, though now surrounded by a neighborhood that is spectacularly futurized.  The film's special effects are magnificent and beyond criticism.Few actors are sufficiently nimble to handle the role that seems completely natural for Robin Williams.

Though the story is as old as Ovid's Pygmalion, or better yet, The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi (1883), director Chris Columbus has taken a fresh look at the hoary tale, and in it, discovered a new world. Set in the not too distant future and spanning 200 years (hence the somewhat confusing title), it tells of the robot Andrew Martin (Robin Williams), purchased by 'Sir' Richard Martin (Sam Neill), to be a servant for his family. Sir notices that Andrew, though a machine, has the soul of an artist, and he nurtures and protects him, and also profits when Andrew proves adept at creating designer clocks.-----------------Sir Martin: You're a unique robot, Andrew. I feel a responsibility to help you become -- whatever you're able to be.==============================Though he has made both Sir and himself rich, he yearns for something more, and sets off on a quest to discover what he can become.He arrives back in San Francisco, and underneath the San Francisco Bay Bridge he finds his Geppetto, Rupert Burns (the ubiquitous Oliver Platt). Burns' father had worked at the factory that originally created Andrew, and his son now runs a vintage Harley Davidson/robot shop where he carries on his father's work. With Andrew's finances, and also his brilliant designs, they create synthetic organs, making men more machine-like, and they combine organic parts with Andrew, making him more and more human. The line between man and machine grows increasingly blurred.With the success of their new venture he arrives back at the Martin household to see what he at first thinks is the grown up Little Miss Amanda Martin (Embeth Davidtz), but it is actually Amanda's grand daughter, Portia Charney. Hallie Kate Eisenberg plays Little Miss Amanda Martin at age 7, and she is very cute, and familiar as a frequent guest on Jay Leno's Tonight Show. But Embeth Davidtz as Portia is really a revelation. She resembled an older and wiser Anne Hathaway, and I thought I had seen her before but couldn't place her. Looking at the list of films she's done, I haven't seen any of them, but that is about to change. How long has this been going on? As Ira Gershwin said:Oh, I feel that I could melt; into heaven I'm hurledNow I know how Columbus felt, finding another worldAndrew dislikes her at first, but then, as he becomes more and more human, he falls for her. His quest to become 'a real boy' accelerates accordingly. Embeth Davidtz is really stunning in a performance that takes her from young womanhood into old age.-----------------------Portia: I like you. I even understand you some of the time. But I'm not about to invest my emotions in a machine.================================Kiersten Warren is also worthy of mention as Galatea, Rupert's female robot. She has been given a personality chip and can sing and dance; but she doesn't have that spark that drives Andrew. He finds her perky personality annoying, but she is a delight. The name Galatea refers to Pygmalion's statue that he falls in love with and wants to bring to life. Though Galatea was not the name of the statue in Ovid's original story, at some point it was added.It is strange to praise an actor for a performance when the effect is so dependent on special effects, but though embodied in robots the actors really showed their personalities. Both Williams and Warren did a fantastic job, but let's not forget the puppeteers, some of the finest I have seen in a film since Craig Schwartz performed ""Ex Epistolis duorum amantium"" based on the love letters of Abelard and Heloise.With all that Bicentennial Man had going for it, I am surprised that it wasn't more of a hit. I suppose the fates conspired against it.*((Gotta Put First Things First))*First, I think the title is confusing, and you'd expect the film to be set in 1976 with a patriotic theme. The name just doesn't say touching and heart felt robot sci fi film to me.Second, it was released around the same time as A.I., Artificial Intelligence. It had a similar theme as A.I. and that film didn't do as well as it should have either, considering that it was a proposed project of Stanley Kubrick finished by Steven Spielberg. Both films had production budgets of $100 million, but Bicentennial Man made less than $100 million back (But Bicentennial Man was released in 1999, while AI didn't come out until 2001, so the theory that AI saturated the robot movie market doesn't really hold up) (As a side note, Robin Williams has a voice cameo as Dr. Know in AI)).Third, Robin Williams was kind of experimenting with his screen persona around the time of Bicentennial Man. Trying to break out of his warm, tender, or funny characters, he was trying to get edgier, with the sinister children's show host Rainbow Randolph in Death To Smoochy, or the downright creepy Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo. There was also a Robin Williams backlash in full swing from his treacly performances in two other, then-recent releases -- Patch Adams and Jakob the Liar. Did fear of seeing Robin as a creepy -- or even worse -- a treacly robot cause the audience to stay home in droves?Too bad, for they missed an excellent film, with gorgeous locations in and around San Francisco, or the San Francisco of the future. I know that Robin Williams lives in and loves San Francisco, but Chris Columbus was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Ohio, and has lived in England, Illinois, New York, and Los Angeles. He must have left his heart in San Francisco when he made Mrs. Doubtfire with Robin Williams in 1993, because he is now living in San Francisco.A great scene where Andrew and Portia dance at a formal ball could only happen in San Francisco. With full orchestra a jazz singer of the future performs two classic jazz standards, ""Embraceable You"" written by George and Ira Gershwin and ""The Very Thought of You"" by Ray Noble. It is rare that a director will allow two full performances of jazz to play out, given the short attention span of the modern audience. The singer reminded me of Paula West, who I used to enjoy at The Plush Room. Lo and behold, it was her! Though worthy of wider recognition, she is most well known in her home of San Francisco. I only wish they had let her do another Gershwin tune as well, ""How Long Has This Been Going On?""

In the process he gains self-awareness, invents artificial organic-mechanical hybrid organs, learns to love and eventually die. What he strives for is humanity and I have to question, what is so great about being human that one would give up a rich, productive and essentially immortal life and choose to die? That is the central point of the movie and the explanation is filled with lots of sentimental new-age platitudes that are heaped on top of this movie with cynical smugness. The screenwriters primary job seems to be to manipulatively reinforce the belief that humans are somehow innately superior by the simple fact of their humanity and all that entails. I'm just not buying it. This is at best middle brow entertainment masquerading as humanist discourse and is Robin Williams second most icky role (see the insufferable Patch Adams for his worst), being filled with ridiculous ""moving"" and ""noble"" speeches on the virtue of humanity, blah blah blah.

481717,AXQXD1FKPVDQ1,630587493X,DANIEL J. ANTIL,"[35, 38]","I have just seen Bicentennial Man (on cable) for the second time.  I loved it even more than my first time seeing it in the theater, because I knew the story in advance and could relax and look forward to it, without being overwhelmed by the wonderful special effects and little tidbits of wonderment that pervade the movie.  Quite simply, Robin Williams portrays a robot who becomes human.  But, it's so much deeper than that.  I must say it is one of Robin's best works... and I've seen them all.  It has his delightful comedy, but moreover, his perfect portrayal with pathos and beguiling charm.  The movie begins with the robot (dubbed Andrew) being introduced to the family (with Sam Neill as the father).  One of the little girls in the family makes a quick connection with the new robot (Williams), and they become fast friends... for life, as it turns out.  As time goes by, Andrew (Williams) becomes more and more a member of the family.  But, Andrew also becomes more human, and eventually goes to search for his identity, and to seek out others like him.  The film moves rather quickly from one time period to another, since they have to cover Andrew's lifespan of two-hundred years (hence the title).  Throughout his life, he is constantly evolving, whether mechanically, thru technological improvements, or just by learning human qualities.  The thrust of it is that he eventually becomes human, but is not recognized as such until the end of his life.

THe only difference being that I, Robot is more action than drama. Also, contrary to what the back of the DVD says, Bicentennial man is no comedy. Sure, it has it humerous moments. But it leans towards being more of an emotional film.Bicentennial man is about one Robot who is distinctly unique, being able to feel  and understand to a certain degree that is rather human. It is a journey that leads him to try and discover his roots, and deal with the prejudices of his time. Finally leading Andrew down the path of becoming a man.Like Pinocchio, Andrew desperatly wants to become a real boy, er..man,  but unlike Pinocchio, Andrew was able to make that dream a reality. finding someone who owns a little robot repair shop, and willing to undertake such a momumental task.Andrew gradually becomes real, first covering his frame with real skin and more defined features, then when he falls in love, he takes the next step. This is where he invents mechanical hearts, kidneys, lungs ect... Andrew then designs a nervious system and the ability to feel. But it is not until he begins to force himself to age that people will even begin to accept him as the one thing that he ever wanted to be. A human man.""Men do not mind a immortal robot, but only an immortal man."" Andrew was told.The ending of the movie is sad, it is where he and his wife of fourty years are dying, awaiting the verdict from the council on wether Andrew will be known as a human or a robot. Andrew dies just as his verdict is announced, never knowing what that verdict was, but knowing to himself that it was not the mechanical parts inside him that made him a robot.

481731,A1JCN10T0TPOPH,630587493X,"Esn024 ""esn024""","[8, 10]","Let's just get one thing straight here; this movie is one of the most touching films that I've seen in quite a while.I read the wonderful Asimov ""short"" story before I saw the movie, so I had fairly high expectations of this film. Until, that is, I actually read the little blurb at the back of the video:""no run-of-the-mill robot!"" ?""a crowd-pleasing comedy hit"" ???Something was wrong here. Surely Hollywood would recognize the extraordinary potential of the story and try to bill it as something more than yet another ""light comedy""?! Right? But then, who was I kidding? The back cover makes it look like yet ANOTHER cliche American family film. Exactly the kind of film I'd avoid watching (Nice, huh? The people who'd normally come to see films like this are scared off by the ""yet another family comedy"" advertising!)That's what Hollywood advertised it as, and I have the feeling that the backers of this film were not very pleased with the director's attempts to make this film into something serious. So they fought back! An extremely annoying dancing ""female"" robot with a ""personality"", dumb jokes about sex; all these are attempts to mould this film into the specified Hollywood formula.Thankfully, they do not fully succeed in ruining this film, but they DO keep it from becoming a true classic. Despite these really stupid Hollywood throw-ins, the film still remains primarily an intelligent film, similar in tone to Asimov's stories. It deviates significantly from the story, but surprisingly most of the deviations are not bad, and are well thought-out. There is more humour, too, than in Asimov's stories. Most of it is intelligent, and was actually quite funny to me.The exception, of course, is the scene where Andrew starts following a sexy female robot. Which idiot cooked up this dumb idea?! First of all, he's a ROBOT; he is attracted to people/robots because of their personality, never because of their physical form! Secondly, that female robot defies practically everything that Asimov ever wrote about robots, up to and including the Three Laws of Robotics (she actually defies her owner in one scene, violating the Second Law)!Besides that, the deviations from the story mainly function to make this a film for the heart more than for the head. A typical Hollywood gimmick, but it really works here, especially in the heartwrenching final scene.Even so, I would have liked to see more on the resistance that Andrew encountered when dealing with ordinary human society; a lot of his interactions with the outside world from the story were removed or conveniently skimmed over in the movie, including most of the legal battles and the issue of him still having to obey the Three Laws of Robotics (which are hardly even mentioned in the movie after the first 30 minutes or so, unlike in the book where they were almost a central issue).Overall, this is a better-than average Hollywood film that has been noticeably ruined by ""input"" from Hollywood producers (this is my guess here). Ideally, this movie should have been given a lot more priority than it was; this IS after all based on one of the best stories of one of the 20th century's most famous science fiction writers!

Sure it had its moments like other dramas, but being billed as a comedy, this was surprising. The second is that most children watching this  film will be bored and confused with the subject matter. Although it is a  clean family movie, the topics covered (i.e. euthanasia, discrimination,  immortality, etc.) are most definitely adult.I am glad it wasn't a  simple comedy, as within I found a touching, human story about a robot's  search for meaning and humanity. It is a remarkable film, with great acting  by both Robin Williams and Sam Neil. This was combined with a great score  and wonderful visuals.

It overreaches its capabilities and can't pull it all together.  It seems that  the more human Andrew became, the worse the film got.This is based on  Isaac Asimov's short story about a robot named Andrew (Robin Williams)  whose flawed programming makes him obsessed with becoming human.  It shows  his relationship with four generations of the Martin family and his various  upgrades toward humanhood.  The first part of the film is engaging and  droll.  Williams is at his best when he is doing offbeat comedy, and this  segment had a warm kind of comedy that was enchanting.By the time the  film progressed to the romance between Andrew and Portia, it had used up  its charm.  It became contrived and implausible.  Williams is beyond his  talents as a romantic lead and all the romantic scenes were forced and  awkward.  As the film moved towards the ending, Andrew wasn't the only  thing getting moribund.  The entire film began to decay.Director Chris  Columbus did some excellent work in the area of makeup.  The robot costumes  and the aging makeup was wonderfully done.  Unfortunately, much was lacking  in the costumes and sets as the decades went by.  As time passed, nothing  seemed to change as regards dress and sets.  We are led to believe that 200  years hence, everything will look pretty much the way it looks today.  Think of the difference between dress in 1800 and today.  Shouldn't we  expect changes of similar magnitude over the next 200 years?  Apparently  not in Columbus' mind.  The only indications that it wasn't the 20th  century were a couple of futuristic blue screen city backdrops and that's  about it.  Very unimaginative.Sam Neill was marvelous as the Martin  patriarch.  He gave the father wisdom, character and a strong guiding hand.  Embeth Davidtz was lovely but a little tentative at times as Portia.  She  was stronger as Little Miss, which required more warmth than dynamism.  Williams was very good at the start, but as the water got deeper, he  floundered.  He needs to stay with wacky comedy roles and stop pretending  he is a dramatic/romantic lead.  Oliver Platt was great fun as the eccentic  inventor who develops Andrew's upgrades.There was a lot to enjoy about  this film. It was delightfully warm and schmaltzy even though it did  outlive its allure by the end. If you are the sentimental type, you will  probably enjoy it. If you are expecting side splitting comedy or good  Sci-Fi, forget it.

481744,APASOUCF2UD42,630587493X,Greg Curtis,"[4, 5]","Bicentennial Man, the latest vehicle for Robin Williams, follows the 200-year odyssey of android Andrew Martin, as he struggles to become human and seek acceptance as one.Not unlike the emotional struggle faced by Star Trek: The Next Generation's Mr. Data, Andrew is faced with fearful humans who refuse to see his impassioned side, and delight in labelling him as a subordinate ""it"". Thus, the film briefly touches on the theme of racial intolerance, and the age-old question of what makes a man a man. Andrew is also faced with learning about loss, as the characters he serves all grow old and eventually die.Taking place as it does over two centuries, the story tries hard to match the sweeping grandeur of such films as Forrest Gump and Gone with the Wind, but advances at such sudden intervals that the narrative becomes choppy. This will undoubtedly cause many children to become confused, with the characters pictured at so many progressive periods in their lives.But a children's picture this is not. In fact, Bicentennial Man is too heavy-handed for children, with not too subtle discussions of sperm function and sexual intercourse. Some viewers may also be upset with its pro-euthanasia stance. Further, there are not one, but four death-bed scenes, guaranteed to tug at one's heartstrings. Terms of Endearment from a robot's point of view?The score by James Horner, which at times is reminiscent of his Oscar-winning Titanic theme, swells at all the moments of poignancy, but one can only take so many ups and downs in two hours.Perhaps to lessen the film's fantasy concept and offer viewers something to relate to, a few generational conflicts are thrown in, but these seem misplaced surrounded by so much wonder. Certainly, the film presents a very Utopian vision of the future, and is visually quite attractive. From sumptuous sets to imposing matte paintings of cityscapes and futuristic (but not over-done) clothing, there is surprisingly minimal gadgetry.But why is that Hollywood make-up artists still have such a long way to go in creating convincing old-age effects?Those expecting Robin Williams' usual buffoonery and in-your-face wisecracks will be disappointed, as he instead offers a gentle and understated portrayal of a misfit trying to belong. Bicentennial Man also features Sam Neill, in his usual unobtrusive role, Pepsi-kid Halle Eisenberg as ""Little Miss"", and a sparkling performance by Ambeth Davidtz as both the grown-up Little Miss and her own granddaughter.Bicentennial Man is certainly a pleasant diversion from an audience member's own personal struggle, but will fail to generate much moral discussion. Despite his mental and physical transformation from machine to pseudo-man, Andrew can never develop a soul. Consequently, neither can the film itself, which beats with a prosthetic heart.

481745,A319SKSB556033,630587493X,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[6, 6]","When this film was released 18 days before the turn of the century it was hurt at the box office by two nearly fatal blows. The first was the temporary backlash against Robin Williams at the time for his performance in the manipulative Patch Adams. The second was the onslaught of reviews that called it ""schmaltzy"" and ""overly-sentimental"". Well, I never found it to be that way. If you want to watch a horribly manipulative and sentimental emotional rape then check-out the other Columbus/Williams movie Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd rather throw myself into the path of an oncoming combine harvester than watch that again.The film opens in 2005 (the ""near future"" at the time) as Mr. Martin (Sam Neill), a wealthy businessman has a robot servant delivered to his luxurious home. As soon as the robot is powered up he seems to be...different. His name is Andrew (which means ""man"" or ""manly"") and while his body may be robotic, his personality is not. In fact he very slowly develops and learns human characteristics as he interacts and responds to the world around him.Mr. Martin is astonished by Andrew's ability to understand art and music. He treats him like a member of the family and educates him by the fire every night on the customs and history of mankind. As the years pass and lives fade away Andrew sets-off on a decades-long journey to find other robots like him. The quest ends when he meets Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a robotics engineer who turns Andrew from a simple robot into a life-like android. Upon returning home with his new appearance he falls in love with his old master's great-granddaughter, who is an exact double of her grandmother. They want to be with each other so badly but know they will never be accepted by society unless Andrew can become fully human. Which is impossible.Or is it? It's a question for the atheists and religious zealots to fight over. At what point does Andrew develop a soul? Why is he different from other robots? Did God give him the gift of human emotion? It is a cosmic selection or is it up to the World Council to declare Andrew human? It all builds to a heartbreaking ending, that is honestly one of the toughest movie endings I have ever had to sit through. I can't even write about it so I'll end my description here.This is familiar territory for Williams though. His performance as Mork learning about Earth and marrying a human woman is rather close to Andrew Martin's journey to become a man. And although I wouldn't call it a kid's film, or even a comedy, there are still a lot of laughs. But not in the usual anarchic Williams style. Andrew's curiosity of the world is a much more refined and quieter performance. It's a shame that most people can't see that it's Williams inside the suit for the first hour of the film as it makes us forget he's there on the screen and perhaps appreciate his acting ability less.James Horner's score is also simply wonderful. It's hard to believe the man who gave us the storming action sound of Commando and Aliens could also be capable of something so warm and beautiful. I guess they didn't give him the award for Titanic for nothing. For this movie he again teamed-up with Celine Dion to record the song ""Then You Look At Me"", which is the perfect tune to roll the credits to. I don't care what you think about me, I love it. Even if the lyrics make that ending even more harrowing.Despite going as far ahead as the year 2205, there's no utopia or dystopia subtext to distract us from the story of Andrew's life. The evolution of technology and architecture is handled subtly and is unobtrusive. It's a quirky irony though, that Andrew's inventions and discoveries help save lives and forward the human race despite not being fully human himself.Bicentennial Man is certainly the most mature and subversive film of Chris Columbus' career as a director. As I said, not a kid's film but a masterpiece of science-fiction and character drama.

You can thank the great acting by Robin Williams and relative unknown Embeth Davidtz and the music by James Horner for doing this to me.  I especially enjoyed Davidtz.  Why this was her first &quot;Big time&quot; movie I do not know.  Williams and Horner as usual performed to thier potential.  Another thing well done in this movie was the special effects.  It's a rarity today to see a movie with special effects that actually has a plot.  In the end, you must see this movie.

I am so used to science fiction being aimed at a juvenile  or young adult audience I was somewhat wary about purchasing it.  However  my fears were totally unfounded.  &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; is a great  film despite the panning it got from the critics.  Robin Williams is great  as the robot Andrew bought in the year 2005 by a wealthy all American  Family as a &quot;household appliance&quot;.  The story follows his  relationship with the family over the years, especially Little Miss, the  youngest member of the Martin family.  Andrew is a robot with a quirk.  He  has the ability to feel emotions, and because of this has the ability to  expand beyond his original programming.  Not everyone is pleased about  Andrew's abilities especially the Robotics Company that created him but  with the aid of Sir Martin played excellently by Sam Neill Andrew becomes  an individual.  Throughout all of this Little Miss is there, and robot and  child forge a strong bond, so strong in fact that Little Miss actually  falls in love with him when she grows up unbeknown to Andrew.  We follow  Andrew through many learning experiences, with the grown up Little Miss at  his side he acquires a bank account for all the money he earns, and then  through his desire to be free, not owned by anyone, to the day he leaves to  try and find his own kind in the world.  Throughout the film Andrew has one  desire, to be human, first through his ability to feel, then to show them  through facial expressions, then with the help of Rupert Burns, played to  perfection by Oliver Platt, a human appearance that will make him human  looking.  The film moves slowly, Robin Williams gives a convincing  performance as the robot who wants humanity with all its trappings.  From  external to internal, he sets about achieving his goal, aided by Rupert and  then the granddaughter of Little Miss, Portia who he falls in love with and  who eventually becomes his partner.  The film shows the prejudices that  Andrew encounters, even within the Martin family; Portia's father hates him  as did, the original Little Miss' older sister.  This is not an action  packed science fiction film, rather it is thought provoking, deliciously  funny in parts, just watch Williams with the female robot Galatea played  wonderfully by Kiersten Warren (watch this girl she's going places!) and  you will know what I mean.  The ending is poignant and moving, especially  because you know that Andrew could have lived forever but choose mortality  because he did not want to live without his human consort Portia.  There is  a wonderful little twist at the end which left me smiling, so all in all  this is a wonderful film, aimed I think mainly at an adult audience but the  more mature teenager will probably appreciate it, so go out and borrow or  buy it, it's well worth it.",5,At Last!

I'm sure that if you never read the novella, you really enjoy the movie. But like most people who read the story first, I can't get past the fact that the storyline was butchered for the sake of making the movie. Asimov rarely included romance in his writing, and what little he did wasn't included in Bicentennial Man. Maybe if they just called it something else, or said ""loosely based on ideas and characters created by Isaac Asimov.""For those of you who have never read Isaac Asimov's original, enjoy this movie.

481760,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,630587493X,Keith Mirenberg,"[0, 0]","Bicentennial Man was a very enjoyable four star film for me. It contained comedy, drama and morality messages all in a sci-fi film setting. This film had wonderful mechanical effects. However, I enjoyed it first and foremost because of Robin Williams and don't understand what those 1 and 2 star rating people were complaining about. Robin Williams worked very hard at his performance and I think brought out qualities in Andrew that no one else could have. I think all the special effects were beautifully done and the musical score was exquisite. Frankly, this helped get me through some of the few more drawn out portions of the film.This is another in a long string of Hollywood robot films that quoted Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, although it didn't seem to invoke any of them too heavily in any of the plot developments. Several of the film messages are lost on me and I don't quite know what the writer was trying to say about marriage and sex defining humanity. Perhaps he wasn't saying any more about life than ""let's try to enjoy the ride"".I loved the scene in which the option of becoming ""a complete man"" was presented to Andrew by the robot maker and thought it was handled very well. I do know that when Andrew wished to be ""more human"" by being made mortal, I agreed with the robot maker. He felt that Andrew was definitely becoming more human because he was making one huge mistake.It is clear to me that as long as life is pleasant and not filled with intolerable pain, it is also filled with constant fascination. If I were the writer I would not have permitted Andrew to ""check-out"", by becoming artificially mortal.  Andrew, being above all things sentient and intelligent, should not have wished for death because his ""life partner"" was dying. In fact, I think he should have tried to convince his partner into extending her life by means of his biological implants. When she eventually died he could have remained behind to glorify her memory, and also could have developed devices to further extend the useful life of people and rendered other great services to humanity.If there was some great point the writer was trying to make about marriage and sexuality defining humanity I guess I just missed it. Although I count myself as a great fan of both, I really don't think a reasoning robot would permit his ""humanity"" to have been defined by such a measure or have chosen to abandon useful life and just ""check out"".",4,I Enjoyed the Bicentennial Man,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2444,"['Bicentennial', 'Man', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'four', 'star', 'film', 'contained', 'comedy', 'drama', 'morality', 'messages', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'setting', 'film', 'had', 'wonderful', 'mechanical', 'effects', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'foremost', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', '1', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'people', 'were', 'complaining', 'about', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'performance', 'think', 'brought', 'out', 'qualities', 'Andrew', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'think', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'beautifully', 'done', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'exquisite', 'Frankly', 'helped', 'get', 'few', 'more', 'drawn', 'out', 'portions', 'film.This', 'long', 'string', 'Hollywood', 'robot', 'films', 'quoted', 'Asimov', 'Three', 'Laws', 'Robotics', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'invoke', 'too', 'heavily', 'plot', 'developments', 'Several', 'film', 'messages', 'are', 'lost', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'writer', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'marriage', 'sex', 'defining', 'humanity', 'Perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'saying', 'more', 'life', 'let', 'try', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'loved', 'scene', 'option', 'becoming', 'complete', 'man', 'was', 'presented', 'Andrew', 'robot', 'maker', 'thought', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'do', 'know', 'when', 'Andrew', 'wished', 'be', 'more', 'human', 'being', 'made', 'mortal', 'agreed', 'robot', 'maker', 'felt', 'Andrew', 'was', 'definitely', 'becoming', 'more', 'human', 'was', 'making', 'one', 'huge', 'mistake.It', 'clear', 'as', 'long', 'life', 'pleasant', 'not', 'filled', 'intolerable', 'pain', 'also', 'filled', 'constant', 'fascination', 'were', 'writer', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'permitted', 'Andrew', 'check-out', 'becoming', 'artificially', 'mortal', 'Andrew', 'being', 'things', 'sentient', 'intelligent', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'wished', 'death', 'life', 'partner', 'was', 'dying', 'fact', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'convince', 'partner', 'extending', 'life', 'means', 'biological', 'implants', 'When', 'eventually', 'died', 'could', 'have', 'remained', 'glorify', 'memory', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'devices', 'further', 'extend', 'useful', 'life', 'people', 'rendered', 'other', 'great', 'services', 'humanity.If', 'was', 'great', 'point', 'writer', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'marriage', 'sexuality', 'defining', 'humanity', 'guess', 'just', 'missed', 'count', 'great', 'fan', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reasoning', 'robot', 'would', 'permit', 'humanity', 'have', 'been', 'defined', 'measure', 'have', 'chosen', 'abandon', 'useful', 'life', 'just', 'check', 'out']",Bicentennial Man
481761,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,630587493X,Kendal B. Hunter,"[5, 36]","This is an interesting film, so this will take a while.  My brother's name is Andrew Martin Hunter.This is a wonderful San Francisco movie.  The city does not overwhelm the story, but is a perfect nest for the action.  Good choice and good job!Similarly, the effects enhance the film, and do not overwhelm and choke the story being told, which is why we are seeing this movie in the first place.  There are plenty of Mork and Mindy reruns if you want to see Williams preform!ROBIN WILLIAMS:  I have a hard time seeing the character of Andrew through Robin Williams, sin Williams (call him &quot;W&quot;?) is such a strong personality.  I have to ask myself if this movie could this film stand alone with out Robin Williams.  I think it could, it is just theat Williams has the name draw, along with Asimov, so they had him do it.  Robin Williams got in the way of the story, though not intentionally.  He is so strong and such a high-pressure personality that I don;t think he can help it.  Plus the several wise-cracks which are a shadow of the comedian Williams.THEME:  This is a story of humanity by studying a contrast.  If this seems familiar, it is a leitmotif of Lt. Cmdr. Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I watched the film to see if they did anything fresh or new.  They didn't . . . except for the suicide.  I think you could piece this film together from fragments of the TV series and First Contact.  Indeed, Star Trek has treated this theme so well, there is a book called &quot;The Metaphysics of Star Trek: Is Data Human?&quot; which covers this whole ground.  See episode 135 &quot;The Measure of A Man.&quot;I saw the film as having two conclusions about humanity.CONCLUSION 1: Meaning of humanity is sex.  This is absolutely laughable.  Andrew Martin becomes a human, and has sex. ...  Egad!  So the point of humanity is sex.  Is heaven found at the red-light district, and is God's name &quot;Roxanne?&quot;  Is Bill Clinton the most enlightened human on earth?  Why my grandmother was dying of Alzheimer's disease, my grandfather has a sexless life.  So was he missing something, or did he find something in nurturing my grandmother, feeding her, dressing and bathing her, and so forth?  The Bible says that God is love, not that God is sex!CONCLUSION 2: Suicide is an option.  Aside from being just a change of scenery, suicide is the ultimate choice.  We can not unscramble that egg.  We talk about life being precious and full and rich, yet there are some people who do not see it as such.  We want to respect choices and we all feel pain, but we also have obligations to others and to society.  We are all needed somewhere,a nd suicide pulls us out of the pool of helping hands.Back to my Grandmother.  It cost [money]  to keep her alive, and took all of my grandfather's time to tend her.  A lethal injection of Kevorkian Juice cost [less].  Physician assisted suicide is less about pain, and more about money.  If we stop caring about the dying, we will lose feeling about the living.I wonder what Mr. Williams's opinion is about suicide.  He did a marvelous anti-suicide film, &quot;What Dreams May Come,&quot; yet he does this pro suicide film.  You can see why hypocrite was originally a theatrical term.Well, this was not one of my favorite films.  I think star Trek did a better job with the themes.

481773,A152C8GYY25HAH,630587493X,Matthew Horner,"[8, 11]","Bicentennial Man is based on questions that have long been popular in science fiction. More recently, they has gained attention in science and philosophy. As man creates increasingly sophisticated machines, how far will we go in giving them intelligence? If we reach a point where we can make them rational, will they be able to rationalize? Will they ever develop feelings? If they can do these things, then what exactly will we call them? This movie tries to answer these questions in a gentle, sometimes humorous way. Unfortunately, it has a tendency to use the 'feel good' approach, and the results are disjointed. Many viewers will have a question of their own at the end. That question may be either &quot;Huh?&quot; or &quot;What?&quot;In the year 2005, a welathy man has a robot or android delivered to his lavish suburban home. The robot, which looks suspiciously like Robin Williams because he/it is played by Williams, is silver and manniquin-like. It is programmed to be the modern version of a servant or, considering it is a machine, a slave. It cooks, cleans, talks and responds to voice commands. The man's wife finds the android, quaintly named Andrew by one of the children, to be distracting. The youngest daughter adores it, at first treating it like a highly intelligent pet, later as a good friend. The elder daughter can't stand it. At one point, she orders it to jump out of a second story window, which causes quite a bit of damage to it. Considering how annoying and too cute it often is, she may have the right idea. It doesn't take Dad long to find out that Andrew has unexpected gifts. He is very artistic and seems to have feelings. The manufacturer insists that the robot is defective, but Dad refuses to trade Andrew in. Instead, he teaches the android many things about life, love and human beings. After several years, Andrew wants to be human. He also wants his freedom and sets off on a long journey around the world to try to find others like himself. When he returns, he has many more experiences. In fact, the movie covers a period of two hundred years.I don't know what to say about Robin Williams at times. It's as though he is both the best and the worst of actors. Perhaps it's because of his demeanor or because he has such a dominant, recognizable personality. When I watch him in a serious dramatic scene, there is usually something in those dark, dancing eyes that suggests he's about to go into a series of wisecracks at any moment. I suppose I am suggesting that he stick with comedy, because it's impossible for me to take him seriously. Take this role. There may be things which are dark and compelling about a robot who yearns to be human and who almost gets there, but there is also a humorous side to this situation. In the comic scenes, Williams is great. Ultimately, though, this is a drama, and it's unfortunate that another actor wasn't cast in the role. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Johnny Depp come to mind.Bicentennial Man spends nearly half its running time on Andrew's first few years with the family. That means the next 180 years are sketchy at best, and this weakens the film.

Thankfully, it didn't make me cry! Only two films make me cry, and that's Armageddon &amp; My Girl - sad I know.I've vaguely heard of this film before, but that's due to my friend mentioning it.

Very weird to watch!I got very confused at one point, as when Andrew is playing the piano with Little Miss, and she suddenly changes! I thought she was suddenly the mother. But they'd just sped forward about 15 years, without any warning. (They did the rest of the time, unless I was too blind to notice it.) I hated the way this film kept speeding forward through time.I thought this film was three films rolled into one. The Green Mile (the whole immortality bit), The Terminator (I've just recently watched that and the bit where Andrew looks at his new family), and what was the other one? Of course, Mrs Doubtfire. Mainly because it's made by the same director, and it's just similar in little ways.Sack the little girls, they were such bad actresses!

This movie is first and foremost a touching Science Fiction Story.  This movie has many touching human  emotions, situations, and characters that we can relate to.  The main  character, goes on an epic and long journey (200 years) to find out who he  is and what his place is in the world.  He meets many people and  edventually finds love, he also has to cope with loosing loved ones.  Most  people can relate to this, which makes it such a good story.  Ironically,  the robot acts more human than some of the humans in the story.  This movie  also deals with subjects like immortality, and all the losses and changes  one would have to go through if he or she was immortal.  For a PG movie,  this has some pretty deep views.  It comes off as a kids movie, but it is  more for older kids and adults because it is quite long.

481784,A3IM5IGE0JCLHO,630587493X,"One World ""One World""","[8, 8]","This movie will be in my ""All-time"" collection.  Contrary to the writting on the  back cover of the VHS/DVD this is not a comedy but rather a sentimental and touching drama with some comedy thrown in.  This movie goes for the heart like E.T. and plays it like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar.  The movie's  central theme is one of humanity from and from one looking in from the outside and valuing what we take for granted.One thing that stood out was the ""freedom"" ideal as seen from Andrew's enlightened viewpoint.  He wanted to be able to be able to serve out of free will.  Thinking back on this, I believe that this - in a way - was a testament to Andrew's love for the family and wanting the Family's ultimate love/trust (If you love someone set them free....) Andrew demonstrated that even thought he was free he would exercise his freedom to continue serving and being apart of the family as he was already doing.  In a world were freedom seems to mean that there is no ""ball and chain""  of obligations, Andrew wants to show the family whom he serves that he does so because he wants to, not merely because he was designed, built and programmed to.Another one of the many issues this film deals with is the one of mortality vs immortality.  While he could live forever, see the many wonders that may come, become rich,  and all the ""goodies"" that come with this ""immortality"" was it worth it especially when it comes to death of ones he had come to care for.  As ones Andrew has come to care about begin to drop off his lament, ""Will every human being I care about just leave?"" sharply drives home a stinging realization that along with living forever one would also be tormented with watching loved ones leave over and over.  Then there was Porsha's assertion that she did not want to live forever because she accepted that she was not meant to, this is so much against our ""fountain of youth"" desires.  She did not want to live a lie by living forever courtesy of artificial organs, skin etc, it was not natural, it was not the ""order"".All in all this movie is as other reviewers say ""thought-provoking"".  It is sentimental toward the human condition and state of being, warts and all.Renting this movie ""won't do"".  I bought the DVD.  I don't own many movies.",5,Not a comedy.

Then he also decides to become mortal and die along with them. You get to see how the hospital of the future will look (it's quite beautiful). And there is some nice jazz muzic in the middle of the movie. The song is originally performed by Nat King Cole, and has memorable, romantic lyrics:""The very thought of you,and I forget to do,the little ordinary thingsthat everyone ought do...""The movie starts in an innocently playful way, with some family buying a robot, and the kids treating it like a broken toy, in a rude and unfriendly manner. Then gradually, the robot becomes more intelligent, capable of emotions and making money with his skills. Then he gets the desire to become human. Centuries pass by, and he is not granted acknoledgement, that he is human, because of his robotic brain. It kind of reminds me of an immigrant who wants to become an american, but can't fully complete the transformation, because he was born elsewhere.Finally, the robot becomes mortal and dies, just a moment before he is granted the acknowledgement that he is human.Because the story happens in the future, it's hard to imagine something that has lasted 200 years. I was thinking that the US Dollar has existed for about 200 years, so you could say that George Washington, the dead president on the dollar bill, is a bicentennial man. And I'm sure that after about 180 years, they will talk about the immortal, bicentennial Personal Computer (PC).I remove one star from the rating, because the ending is sad, the hero dies. The movie's producers could have allowed the robot to live eternally, as I am sure this will happen with real robots. Their bodies will wear out, but their souls will be immortal... like records on a DVD.For any viewer concerned about aging and death, this movie may be thought-provoking.",4,"A deeply emotional family movie, situated in a futuristic scenery",1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,1917,"['Synopsis', 'Generations', 'people', 'are', 'born', 'die', 'One', 'robot', 'unchangable', 'immortal', 'witness', 'lives', 'Then', 'also', 'become', 'mortal', 'die', 'along', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'hospital', 'future', 'will', 'look', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'jazz', 'muzic', 'middle', 'movie', 'song', 'originally', 'performed', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'memorable', 'romantic', 'lyrics', 'very', 'thought', 'forget', 'do', 'little', 'ordinary', 'everyone', 'ought', 'do', 'movie', 'innocently', 'playful', 'way', 'family', 'buying', 'robot', 'kids', 'treating', 'broken', 'toy', 'rude', 'unfriendly', 'manner', 'Then', 'gradually', 'robot', 'more', 'intelligent', 'capable', 'emotions', 'making', 'money', 'skills', 'Then', 'desire', 'become', 'human', 'Centuries', 'pass', 'not', 'granted', 'acknoledgement', 'human', 'robotic', 'brain', 'kind', 'reminds', 'immigrant', 'who', 'become', 'american', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'complete', 'transformation', 'was', 'born', 'elsewhere.Finally', 'robot', 'mortal', 'dies', 'just', 'moment', 'granted', 'acknowledgement', 'story', 'future', 'hard', 'imagine', 'something', 'lasted', '200', 'years', 'was', 'thinking', 'US', 'Dollar', 'existed', '200', 'years', 'could', 'say', 'George', 'Washington', 'dead', 'president', 'dollar', 'bill', 'bicentennial', 'man', ""'m"", 'sure', '180', 'years', 'will', 'talk', 'immortal', 'bicentennial', 'Personal', 'Computer', 'PC', '.I', 'remove', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'ending', 'sad', 'hero', 'movie', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'allowed', 'robot', 'live', 'eternally', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'happen', 'real', 'robots', 'bodies', 'will', 'wear', 'out', 'souls', 'will', 'be', 'immortal', 'records', 'DVD.For', 'viewer', 'concerned', 'aging', 'death', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'thought-provoking']",Bicentennial Man

Robin Williams much like his idol Jonathan Winters; either is very very good or very very bad depending on what he does.This movie qualifies as the very very good side of Williams.  Although this movie was panned when it first premiered way back when, time has been kind to this movie and Williams' performance, is a sensitive portrayal of a machine wanting to be human.The story has been told before:  Pinocchio and A.I. are two examples of similar stories.  ""Bicentennial Man"" falls in between the two.  Not a classic like Pinocchio; but definitely a better movie than A.I. (which isn't bad either).

481788,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,630587493X,Priscilla Stafford,"[5, 5]","First of all, I would like to say that I loved Isaac Asmiov's book, &quot;The Positronic Man&quot; from which the movie, &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; is based upon. Though both versions are different in ways, both are wonderful. Since this review is about the movie, I will make my review on &quot;The Bicentennial Man.&quot;Robin Williams stars as Andrew Martin, an android who is not the typical &quot;household appliance&quot;. The Martin family soon realize this by seeing his extraordinary talent in carving, and that's only the beginning. Andrew is different because he thinks and feels. He has thoughts and ideas which everyone thinks robots are incapable of. The story tells about Andrew's 200-year journey for his purpose in achieving one thing, his one goal... humanity.As I said already, this movie is different from Isaac Asimov's book, but this is also very entertaining. Robin Williams did an awsome job in his role, though some people don't think so. He was just so right to play the part of Andrew. Everyone else acting in &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; did a great job, too, especially Porschia.A few things though I'll tell you what not to expect. &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; is said to be for the family. Well, yes, but not for younger than teenager kids. The movie is very deep and some parts might not be appropriate for kids. They might not like it because they won't understand it that well. Also, it is said to be a comedy but actually, in my opinion, it is more like a drama. Yes, there are many funny and humorous places in it where I just laughed so hard! But it is not a comedy, it is a drama. Some parts my mother was crying, even I was feeling a little misty eyed. That's what I think is a good movie. A movie in which you can laugh and cry and feel with the characters in a movie.

481795,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,630587493X,Roland E. Zwick,"[24, 28]","Owing to the fact that it is based on an Isaac Asimov story, `Bicentennial Man' turns out to be a more interesting and meaningful film than both its  advertising campaign and its own opening section would indicate. The caveat  for those seeking out a fun film for the entire family is that this movie,  though initially sold as a warm cuddly comedy in the tradition of say `Mrs.  Doubtfire,' actually deals with some very heavy and heady issues like  sexuality, aging and dying, which may make it less-than-ideal viewing for  young children.The first section of the film is, by far, its weakest. In  2005, the wealthy Martin family receives delivery of a brand new servant  android (Robin Williams) who, almost immediately, begins to display a  remarkable range of human emotions and interests. Thus, we are set up for  yet another in a long line of predictable tales (i.e. `Harry and the  Hendersons,' `Stuart Little') in which a family comes to adopt a strange,  not-quite-human creature, welcoming him in as one of their own. Indeed, in  the film's early stages, there is no shortage of either bland humor or  drippy sentimentality as Andrew, the android, ingratiates himself with all  but one of the Martin household. The `wit' in the film consists, basically,  of endless jokes about how Andrew takes all idioms at literal face value, a  running gag that is, finally, as unoriginal as it is wearying.Then,  however, just as we are about to give up hope in it, the movie becomes more  intriguing. Rather than staying within the context of the present life of  this one family, the screenplay begins to move ahead in time, exploring  Andrew's gradual growth toward total humanity, while the initial family  grows up and eventually dies off. Actually, despite how one may feel about  the film itself, one must admire its boldness and audacity, for it is not  often that, in a film billed as a mass audience comedy, all the main  characters pass on to their heavenly reward at one point or another - but,  then again, how many comedies span a two hundred year time period?  `Bicentennial Man' obviously has more on its mind than mere  fish-out-of-water buffoonery, as it becomes an often-elegiac reflection on  the transience of life, the meaning of being human and the search for  societal acceptance. The mood of the film is remarkably hushed and  reflective at times, which again might make it slow going for the modern  mass audience more conditioned to a faster pace and giddier tone,  especially in a Robin Williams film (though, of late, his films have  certainly been taking on a much more somber quality, vide `What Dreams may  Come,' `Patch Adams' and `Jakob the Liar'). There are times when  `Bicentennial Man' seems overly impressed with its own self-importance, yet  one appreciates its refusal to settle for the easy path of cheap comedy and  upbeat sentiments. There is, indeed, a real sadness to much of the  film.Special acknowledgement should be made of the superb art direction,  set design, costume design, makeup and special effects that together give  the film its understated and believable futuristic look. In addition, James  Horner's melancholic symphonic score, though a bit lubricious at times,  does create an atmosphere of contemplative seriousness that perfectly  matches the tone and purpose of the film.`Bicentennial Man' may not turn  out to be what you are looking for when you first seek it out, but, if you  approach it with an open mind and a certain degree of tolerance and  indulgence, you may be pleasantly surprised and, perhaps, even rewarded.",3,flawed but rewarding film,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,3587,"['Owing', 'fact', 'based', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'story', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'meaningful', 'film', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'own', 'opening', 'section', 'would', 'indicate', 'caveat', 'seeking', 'out', 'fun', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'movie', 'initially', 'sold', 'warm', 'cuddly', 'comedy', 'tradition', 'say', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'actually', 'deals', 'very', 'heavy', 'heady', 'issues', 'sexuality', 'aging', 'dying', 'may', 'make', 'less-than-ideal', 'viewing', 'young', 'children.The', 'first', 'section', 'film', 'far', 'weakest', '2005', 'wealthy', 'Martin', 'family', 'delivery', 'brand', 'new', 'servant', 'android', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'almost', 'immediately', 'display', 'remarkable', 'range', 'human', 'emotions', 'interests', 'Thus', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'predictable', 'tales', 'i.e', 'Harry', 'Hendersons', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'family', 'adopt', 'strange', 'not-quite-human', 'creature', 'welcoming', 'one', 'own', 'Indeed', 'film', 'early', 'stages', 'shortage', 'bland', 'humor', 'drippy', 'sentimentality', 'Andrew', 'android', 'one', 'Martin', 'household', 'wit', 'film', 'basically', 'endless', 'jokes', 'how', 'Andrew', 'idioms', 'literal', 'face', 'value', 'running', 'gag', 'finally', 'unoriginal', 'wearying.Then', 'however', 'just', 'are', 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'movie', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Rather', 'staying', 'context', 'present', 'life', 'one', 'family', 'screenplay', 'move', 'ahead', 'time', 'exploring', 'Andrew', 'gradual', 'growth', 'total', 'humanity', 'initial', 'family', 'up', 'eventually', 'off', 'Actually', 'how', 'one', 'may', 'feel', 'film', 'must', 'admire', 'boldness', 'audacity', 'not', 'often', 'film', 'billed', 'mass', 'audience', 'comedy', 'main', 'characters', 'pass', 'heavenly', 'reward', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'many', 'comedies', 'span', 'two', 'hundred', 'year', 'time', 'period', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'obviously', 'more', 'mind', 'mere', 'fish-out-of-water', 'buffoonery', 'often-elegiac', 'reflection', 'transience', 'life', 'meaning', 'being', 'human', 'search', 'societal', 'acceptance', 'mood', 'film', 'remarkably', 'hushed', 'reflective', 'times', 'again', 'might', 'make', 'slow', 'going', 'modern', 'mass', 'audience', 'more', 'conditioned', 'faster', 'pace', 'giddier', 'tone', 'especially', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'late', 'films', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'taking', 'much', 'more', 'somber', 'quality', 'vide', 'What', 'Dreams', 'may', 'Come', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'Jakob', 'Liar', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'overly', 'impressed', 'own', 'self-importance', 'one', 'refusal', 'settle', 'easy', 'path', 'cheap', 'comedy', 'upbeat', 'sentiments', 'indeed', 'real', 'sadness', 'much', 'film.Special', 'acknowledgement', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'superb', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'design', 'costume', 'design', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'together', 'give', 'film', 'understated', 'believable', 'futuristic', 'look', 'addition', 'James', 'Horner', 'melancholic', 'symphonic', 'score', 'bit', 'lubricious', 'times', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'contemplative', 'seriousness', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'purpose', 'film.', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'may', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'when', 'first', 'seek', 'out', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'certain', 'degree', 'tolerance', 'indulgence', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'perhaps', 'even', 'rewarded']",Bicentennial Man

My guess is the action buffs would call this movie a chick flick because of the lack of violence and focus on emotional development. I pity you poor slobs for being so narrow minded. Bicentennial Man is like an autobiography. With that in mind the movie makes perfect sense and achieves what it sets out to do.First lets get to the sci-fi stuff. The movie is supposed to open in the year 2005, which is roughly five years after the movie was made. No idea why they decided on just a short time. Obviously we never developed positronic brains and fully self-capable robots, but that's just nit picking. Add a couple of decades to the movie's timeline and all is well. The android technology was well done and believable. Also the 'upgrades' that Andrew (the android) does during his lifetime tend to be believable as well. Not much other tech stuff in the movie. You'll see a hover car here and some fancy tools there, but for the most part the technology in this movie is focused on the androids.Because the movie's timeline covers about 200 years (thus the movie title) character development for the humans have been sped up, but not to the point to where you don't see it. There are a few one dimensional or static characters in the movie. The important characters fortunately aren't. Bicentennial Man is about character development by the way. It's about how Andrew becomes more and more human and how the humans around him adjust to how much he evolves.The acting was well done of course. I have to give notice to child actress Hallie Kate Eisenberg for doing a great job as the youngest of the Martin family children. The movie is full of beautiful scenes both natural and technological. One thing that bugged me was there were some breathtaking futuristic cityscapes in Bicentennial Man, but they don't show any of them until much later in the movie. That tends to make the movie unbalanced as far as imagery is concerned.If you like dramas then Bicentennial Man will hit the spot. If you like epics then you should be able to get something out of this movie too. It also makes a good date movie since it also involves love and relationships and all that mushy stuff.

481809,A3TSOUX8ZNE31P,630587493X,Steve Scheiber,"[1, 1]","I've owned this movie for a number of years.  I'd never watched it before.  I bought it because it was based on an Isaac Asimov story, and didn't watch it because I've seen what Hollywood does to his material.  ""I Robot"" and ""Nightfall"" are perfect examples.  Hollywood usually can see only in primary colors.  Many outstanding stories can't be told that way.  I didn't want to be disappointed again.Recently, I read some of the reviews here -- reviews that explicitly said that it is not for an audience looking for ""science fiction"" and lots of action.  I also realized that Chris Columbus had directed it, and finally decided to take a chance.  Perhaps I wouldn't have been so impressed if I'd seen it when I first bought it.  But there is so little gentle storytelling around these days, that its virtues stood out in bold relief.Has the story been done before?  Of course.  Most stories have been done before in one form or another.  I suspect I've been reading Asimov and other science fiction since before most of the other posters here were born.  My first comment is -- Isaac would have loved it.It is the warmest, gentlest, most beautiful science fiction movie I've ever seen -- and that's a long list.  I was completely surprised by its tone, its intelligence, and the fact that it was never in a hurry.  The marvelous cinematography alone told the audience the care and respect the writer and director had for the story.And Robin Williams?  He is a gifted, versatile actor with an extremely wide range.  He underplayed it throughout the movie and performed it with subtlety and grace -- one of the movie's best features and one his all-time best performances.  I can't think of another actor who could have succeeded the way he did.  In Mork and Mindy he was at his most manic, and he was extremely funny -- even now, after all the years have passed.  But he has moved on.  This role was totally different.  He created a gentle, naive, and malleable character who evolves as he learns who he is and what makes him unique.When the opening credits rolled, I was surprised that I had never heard of any of the actors except one (the executive at the robot factory).  By the closing credits I was impressed by all of them.As other posters have recognized, this is not a movie for children.  Children like LOUD, and this is a quiet movie.  It moves subtly from beginning to end.  It is not a comedy (nor was it billed as one) and it shouldn't be, although it has funny moments.  Instead, it is a wonderful drama that happens to be science fiction.If you're expecting Star Wars or Star Trek, or Terminator 1-2-3, you will be bored and disappointed.  But if you respect the genre and are looking for the way a complex and sophisticated story should be brought to the screen, then set up in a quiet room with a couple of hours to spare, and watch a beautiful, unhurried, thought-provoking story.",5,Remarkable -- and a total surprise,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,2899,"[""'ve"", 'owned', 'movie', 'number', 'years', ""'d"", 'never', 'watched', 'bought', 'was', 'based', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'material', 'Robot', 'Nightfall', 'are', 'perfect', 'examples', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'can', 'see', 'only', 'primary', 'colors', 'Many', 'outstanding', 'stories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'told', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'disappointed', 'again.Recently', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'explicitly', 'said', 'not', 'audience', 'looking', 'science', 'fiction', 'lots', 'action', 'also', 'realized', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'had', 'directed', 'finally', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'Perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'impressed', ""'d"", 'seen', 'when', 'first', 'bought', 'so', 'little', 'gentle', 'storytelling', 'days', 'virtues', 'stood', 'out', 'bold', 'relief.Has', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'course', 'Most', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'one', 'form', 'suspect', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'Asimov', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'most', 'other', 'posters', 'here', 'were', 'born', 'first', 'comment', 'Isaac', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'it.It', 'warmest', 'gentlest', 'most', 'beautiful', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'long', 'list', 'was', 'completely', 'surprised', 'tone', 'intelligence', 'fact', 'was', 'never', 'hurry', 'marvelous', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'told', 'audience', 'care', 'respect', 'writer', 'director', 'had', 'story.And', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'gifted', 'versatile', 'actor', 'extremely', 'wide', 'range', 'underplayed', 'movie', 'performed', 'subtlety', 'grace', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'features', 'one', 'all-time', 'best', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'way', 'did', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'was', 'most', 'manic', 'was', 'extremely', 'funny', 'even', 'now', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'moved', 'role', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'created', 'gentle', 'naive', 'malleable', 'character', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'unique.When', 'opening', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'surprised', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'actors', 'one', 'executive', 'robot', 'factory', 'closing', 'credits', 'was', 'impressed', 'them.As', 'other', 'posters', 'have', 'recognized', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'Children', 'LOUD', 'quiet', 'movie', 'subtly', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'comedy', 'was', 'billed', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'moments', 'Instead', 'wonderful', 'drama', 'be', 'science', 'fiction.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Terminator', '1-2-3', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'disappointed', 'respect', 'genre', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'complex', 'sophisticated', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'screen', 'then', 'set', 'up', 'quiet', 'room', 'couple', 'hours', 'spare', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'unhurried', 'thought-provoking', 'story']",Bicentennial Man

Wauldron ""iamtoddicus""","[0, 0]","Williams plays Andrew, a household robot of the future, who, through a melted circuit, developes his own personality, and questions his reason for being. While the movie was touted as a comedy (there are very funny bits with Oliver Platt acting as his adopted mentor and `parts improver'), it is more poignant than this.This film is a very well done study in humanity. Using a supposed inhuman character as the lead character, we are slapped in the face with a reality that has becaome all too common place in our society - the living in fear with not only the unknown, but living in fear because our government tells us we must. In the future, discrimination between races and beliefs is replaced with humans using androids as their focus of hate and rascism.Andrew the Android (Williams), having become self-aware, learns to hide his uniqueness, in a simple attempt to survive destruction. Not only does he learn to mask his abilities to the public, he is forced to hide his developed emotions, provided through one of Platt's programs. While this makes for a great story, it is a comment on how humans interact in the real world.As he searches for legitamacy, he demands Platt replace his robotic parts with more humanistic features in a desire to be nothing more than to be accepted by humans.Centuries pass in this sad tale. Political stances in our so called modern mores are questioned. And in the end (GOD I HATE to give it away...) Andrew discovers love, how painful it can be, and learns that death is the ultimate definition of life.I recommend this film for those who can stand introspection. If you are looking for a comedy, stop halfway through. The second half will jerk your heart, and hopefully open your eyes to the search that we all live for...the search for what makes us human.I gave this 4 stars due to the trailers making this a comedy. I love Robim Williams in his serious roles. He has a gift of drawing us into the characters he plays.

I was intrigued to see it when it was first advertised and am surprised more was not done to advertise it better.I gave it three stars simply because of the way the movie is formatted in its plot delivery. While Andrew, played by actor Robin Williams, starts as a robot who, being the exception to the rule, ""becomes aware"" from the day he is ""switched on"" and eventually reinvents himself into a human from his robot body; there were many gaps in the time passages of this film that left me with a feeling of ""emptiness"", a desire of wanting more of the story told about Andrew. Even when he is dismissed from his owners home, after gaining his freedom as a robot and builds his home by the sea shore with 20 years passing; you get a number of these large gaps of time passing with little said about Andrews development and growth as a robot slowly rebuilding himself and developing into a human.I think the permise is intriguing to begin with, but in need of greater development. I do not see this as a children's science fiction film meant for laughs, but something that operates as serious science fiction to begin with. You certainly can take your kids to this film.I think the personality of Andrew really teaches all of us what it is to be really ""humane"" in our dealing with others and that is a message I liked about the film. it was interesting to see a more toned down, serious side to Robin Williams; given how talented he is.It is a great film to watch, but I would have liked to see more even if it took another 45 minutes of added footage to fill in the gaps more during the time passages in the film as Andrew ages and how his friends die over time as he ages to be 200 years old.
