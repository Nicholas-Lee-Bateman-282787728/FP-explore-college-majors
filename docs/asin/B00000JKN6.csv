Torn pretty well conveys the psychopathic worldview in one line, ""we only pass this way once, darlin', might as well pass in a Cadillac"". It is a marvelous portrayal of a chronic, debauched user on the way downhill. Rip Torn is a great actor, and I think this is his masterpiece.Widescreen films, BTW, don't need to be ""matted"" because they are already widescreen, so I would guess that this is another blind application of a matte to a FS film to pass it off as widescreen.

However, these films are being sold individually, not as part of some boxed set. For those of you who are familiar with Rip Torn as irrascible and authoritarian yet lovable characters such as Artie in ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and Zed in ""Men in Black"" be prepared for a shock. In this film there is nothing likeable about Torn's character Maury Dann, a country singer currently on tour through the south. There is no wisdom behind his cynicism - he is all about using people. Specifically he is all about indulging in all the sex and substance abuse he can without regard to what it does to others. His life takes a turn to an even darker place when the boyfriend of one of his one-night stands catches up with him in a restaurant one day. This is one of those character study films that were very popular in the 1970's, and Torn does a great job playing a totally ruthless individual who has a totally different on-stage persona from his actual personality. He even does a fine job singing the country and western songs. Payday was directed by 1974 National Society of Film Critics Award winner Daryl Duke.DVD Special Features:Commentary by Director Daryl Duke & Producer Saul ZaentzWidescreen ""Matted"" formatSubtitles: English and French",5,A forgotten character study film from the 1970's,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1366,"['Payday', '1972', 'one', 'five', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'part', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'Directors', 'Showcase', 'Take', 'Three', 'collection', 'However', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'sold', 'individually', 'not', 'part', 'boxed', 'set', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'irrascible', 'authoritarian', 'yet', 'lovable', 'characters', 'such', 'Artie', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'Zed', 'Men', 'Black', 'be', 'prepared', 'shock', 'film', 'nothing', 'likeable', 'Torn', 'character', 'Maury', 'Dann', 'country', 'singer', 'currently', 'tour', 'south', 'wisdom', 'cynicism', 'using', 'people', 'Specifically', 'indulging', 'sex', 'substance', 'can', 'regard', 'what', 'others', 'life', 'turn', 'even', 'darker', 'place', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'one-night', 'stands', 'up', 'restaurant', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'character', 'study', 'films', 'were', 'very', 'popular', '1970', 'Torn', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'totally', 'ruthless', 'individual', 'who', 'totally', 'different', 'on-stage', 'persona', 'actual', 'personality', 'even', 'fine', 'job', 'singing', 'country', 'western', 'songs', 'Payday', 'was', 'directed', '1974', 'National', 'Society', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Award', 'winner', 'Daryl', 'Duke.DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Daryl', 'Duke', 'Producer', 'Saul', 'ZaentzWidescreen', 'Matted', 'formatSubtitles', 'English', 'French']",N/A
506193,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00000JKN6,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","The obvious comparison to ""Payday"" would be Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" but I think director Daryl Duke outdoes Altman here.  The setting of the film is the periphery of the Country-Western scene where the gate is measured in the hundreds and the film's anti-hero, Maury Dann(Rip Torn), gets paid in cash.  Dann plies his trade warbling cynical ditties to the cowboy hats and beehives hoping for that opening at the Opry or some misfortune to occur for a slot on ""The Johnny Cash Show"".  Nothing is beneath this rascal.  Squiring young girls in the back of his Caddie while nondiscretely tossing to the side of the road old groupies.  Payola.  Mistreatment of his sidemen.  Probably the lowest he can go is killing a man in cold blood and tossing it off on one of his flunkies because ""the show must go on"".  What makes Dann palatable is his devil-may-care attitude and his irresistible grin that is the most enticing this side of Jack.  Ironically, Torn was originally cast in the Jack Nicholson role in ""Easy Rider"" but had to pull out.  In the Seventies, the studios tackled interesting stories and character pieces and ""Payday"" is no exception.  Duke later made another underappreciated classic in 1979, ""The Silent Partner"" with Elliott Gould and Christopher Plummer.  It would behoove true cineastes to check both of these films out.",5,Ballad of A Bad Man,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1339,"['obvious', 'comparison', 'Payday', 'would', 'be', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Nashville', 'think', 'director', 'Daryl', 'Duke', 'Altman', 'here', 'setting', 'film', 'periphery', 'Country-Western', 'scene', 'where', 'gate', 'measured', 'hundreds', 'film', 'anti-hero', 'Maury', 'Dann', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'paid', 'cash', 'Dann', 'trade', 'warbling', 'cynical', 'ditties', 'cowboy', 'hats', 'beehives', 'hoping', 'opening', 'Opry', 'misfortune', 'occur', 'slot', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Show', 'Nothing', 'rascal', 'Squiring', 'young', 'girls', 'back', 'Caddie', 'nondiscretely', 'tossing', 'side', 'road', 'old', 'groupies', 'Payola', 'Mistreatment', 'sidemen', 'Probably', 'lowest', 'can', 'go', 'killing', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'tossing', 'off', 'one', 'flunkies', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'What', 'Dann', 'palatable', 'devil-may-care', 'attitude', 'irresistible', 'grin', 'most', 'enticing', 'side', 'Jack', 'Ironically', 'Torn', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'role', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'had', 'pull', 'out', 'Seventies', 'studios', 'tackled', 'interesting', 'stories', 'character', 'pieces', 'Payday', 'exception', 'Duke', 'later', 'made', 'underappreciated', 'classic', '1979', 'Silent', 'Partner', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'would', 'behoove', 'true', 'cineastes', 'check', 'films', 'out']",N/A

I'd heard about it for years, but only recently got the opportunity to see it.I'm not going to go into the plot here as others have done that already.  The underrated Rip Torn does a fine job as the egotistical and inmature second-rate manslaughtering Country music singer Maury Dann--and peformed his own singing.  (Torn also did another great job that same year in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE.)It's an interesting film and I'm sure nostalgic for many.  It received some critical praise but died at the box office.  And like that other 1973 film that received much critical praise, MEAN STREETS, it just rambles on without much structure or story until the climax. It's other flaws are how the Maury character just dumps those around him and no one else seems to mind.  I also did not buy how his driver took the fall for the manslaughter or that the restaurant manager would accept payola over a homicide.I've had a teen crush on the beautiful AHNA CAPRI ever since watching ENTER THE DRAGON in the late 70s and was dissapointed not to see more of her character in this movie.  Maury dumps her for a younger, more knaive woman just like that and then we NEVER see more of this interesting character!I see Ms Capri as one of those young and talented actresses of the time with star-potential, like a Tusday Weld or a Stella Stevens, which fell victim to either an incompetent or lazy (or both) agent.As far as the DVD, the commentary is less than satisfactory.  It needed to include more about the script and the production.  Even uncredited exec Saul Zaentz admits to as much.

506199,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00000JKN6,stoic,"[2, 3]","Payday is an interesting film about a mediocre country musician named Maury Dann (Rip Torn). The film follows Dann as he careens across the southeast while on tour. The people around Dann are awestruck by his celebrity and power, so they put up with his awful behavior. As the film progresses, Dann's life increasingly spirals out of control.The cast of Payday is excellent. The filmmakers did a good job of casting and the actors make the most of their opportunities. For me, the standout was Cliff Emmich as Dann's driver. The filmmakers also capture the sleazy, aimless lives that musicians live on the road. Payday includes some wonderful visuals of the South in the 1970s; the clothes, cars, and furnishings are incredibly gaudy.The biggest problem with this movie is that Maury Dann is completely unlikeable. He is sexist, violent, crude, self centered, etc. Dann has no particular ambition in life, other to continue taking drugs, having sex with groupies, and making music. The aimless quality of Dann's character tends to drain Payday of suspense because the viewer simply doesn't care about him.I think that Torn does a good job with Dann, but the script lets him down a bit. Perhaps the screenwriters could have made Dann a bit more interesting if they had developed his background more in order to provide a context for his actions.In the end I was mildly disappointed in Payday. I'd read the fantastic reviews before watching.
