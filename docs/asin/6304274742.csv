After all, these are 2 different types of media. I don't expect the actors to be identical to Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh, even though they'd serve as good insperation (which they haven't, in case anyone was wondering).But as the movie kept on going, its story line drifted further and further away from the book's. I don't want to spoil the 'experience' for people who were lucky enough not to see this movie yet, but let's just say that the only things in common the book's ending and the movie's ending are the fact that Scarlett is in danger, and Rhett saves her.If you MUST insist on watching this, please go to your video library first!",1,This has nothing to do with the book!!!!,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,743,"['accept', 'fact', 'movie', 'scripts', 'have', 'change', 'small', 'details', 'books', 'order', 'be', 'made', 'are', '2', 'different', 'types', 'media', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'actors', 'be', 'identical', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'even', ""'d"", 'serve', 'as', 'good', 'insperation', 'have', ""n't"", 'case', 'anyone', 'was', 'wondering', '.But', 'movie', 'kept', 'going', 'story', 'line', 'drifted', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', ""'experience"", 'people', 'who', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'yet', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'only', 'things', 'common', 'book', 'ending', 'movie', 'ending', 'are', 'fact', 'Scarlett', 'danger', 'Rhett', 'her.If', 'MUST', 'insist', 'watching', 'please', 'go', 'video', 'library', 'first']",Scarlett Special Collector's Editon  VHS

410695,A15XERCBNRLGP8,6304274742,Albert Gutierrez,"[4, 5]","Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (she later dropped Kilmer) is okay as a ""new and improved"" Scarlett.  You get the sense that Scarlett's a completely different person once Melly has died.  She's realized that she never truly loved Ashley, that the only woman who truly was her friend is gone, and the only man who truly loved her is gone as well.  It makes sense for her to be much more headstrong (and a bit more ruthless) than she was in Gone With The Wind.  But of course, she becomes a wispy little thing when she tries flirting back with Rhett (the severely miscast Timothy Dalton).The 4-part miniseries is based on the novel Scarlett (by Alexandra Ripley), which is considered a non-canon sequel to Gone With The Wind (both the book and the movie).  It's pretty long, clocking in at 6 hours, though you perhaps can simply watch the first disc (parts 1 and 2) and be satisfied.  My grim and cynical side is saying pretend that Scarlett dies in childbirth at the end of part 2 to give it a sense of finality.Quite honestly parts 3 and 4 are dull.  The story moves along like a bad soap opera, and it's a wholly different film than the first two parts.The 2-disc DVD is okay, though the making-of featurette could have been longer.  Video quality is okay for a TV miniseries.  I'm surprised that this DVD is available.  For the longest time (from around 2002-2005), I always read that this was out of print (though I can't understand why).  Pick it up if you like, though only if you want to step into it with an open mind (read: don't compare it to GWTW, otherwise you won't be satisfied with it at all).",3,Pretty good as a standalone miniseries,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,1597,"['Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'later', 'dropped', 'Kilmer', 'okay', 'new', 'improved', 'Scarlett', 'get', 'sense', 'Scarlett', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'once', 'Melly', 'died', 'realized', 'never', 'truly', 'loved', 'Ashley', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'was', 'friend', 'gone', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'truly', 'loved', 'gone', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'headstrong', 'bit', 'more', 'ruthless', 'was', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'course', 'wispy', 'little', 'thing', 'when', 'flirting', 'back', 'Rhett', 'severely', 'miscast', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', '.The', '4-part', 'miniseries', 'based', 'novel', 'Scarlett', 'Alexandra', 'Ripley', 'considered', 'non-canon', 'sequel', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'book', 'movie', 'pretty', 'long', 'clocking', '6', 'hours', 'perhaps', 'can', 'simply', 'watch', 'first', 'disc', 'parts', '1', '2', 'be', 'satisfied', 'grim', 'cynical', 'side', 'saying', 'pretend', 'Scarlett', 'childbirth', 'end', 'part', '2', 'give', 'sense', 'finality.Quite', 'honestly', 'parts', '3', '4', 'are', 'dull', 'story', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'wholly', 'different', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'parts.The', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'okay', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'Video', 'quality', 'okay', 'TV', 'miniseries', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'DVD', 'available', 'longest', 'time', '2002-2005', 'always', 'read', 'was', 'print', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Pick', 'up', 'like', 'only', 'want', 'step', 'open', 'mind', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'GWTW', 'otherwise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfied']",Scarlett Special Collector's Editon  VHS

410702,A37YM0WP2BWIYE,6304274742,BobSound,"[2, 2]","I tried to watch Scarlett without comparing it to GWTW, as many previous reviewers had suggested, but that is easier said than done.  The story and characters are so intertwined, you can't help but think how they got to where they are in the current situation.  That being said, Scarlett impresses me as a movie that had a lot of work, planning, and thought behind it.  There is some actual depth to the story which traces Scarlett back to her ancestral homeland in Ireland and for me actually fills in a lot of the gaps in the original GWTW.  Also the settings and costumes are extraordinarily well done.  The colors and photography are outstanding, however, I wish this would have been filmed in 16:9 widescreen instead of the 4:3 television format.  Unfortunately in 1994, when this made-for-TV movie was made, few directors were thinking about HDTV.My biggest gripe about the movie is Scarlett herself.  Timothy Dalton makes a convincing Rhett Butler, although you find yourself always comparing him to Clark Gable.  Actually, had Dalton been cast in the original GWTW, he might have actually made a better Rhett.  But it's too late and Gable is a hard act to follow.Getting back to the character Scarlett O'Hara, I'm not sure Joanne Whalley was the best choice here.  She is a fine actress indeed, but she is no Vivien Leigh.  Sure, the character Scarlett is supposed to be assertive and aggressive and maybe even a little bossy at times.  But in the mini-series, Scarlett comes off as being a ""witch"" (spelled with a ""b"") which for me at least, was thoroughly distracting and downright annoying a good bit of the time.I've read both the book GWTW and seen the movie numerous times and I would have never ever characterized the original Scarlett with the b-word.  Even though she could get a little self centered at times, you always knew in your heart that she was basically a good person and maybe just caught up in her own emotions and ambitions.But Whalley, playing Scarlett, comes off as being downright sinister at times.  Calling the movie ""Scarlett"" couldn't be more accurate because throughout the entire movie you can perceive Scarlett thinking ""This is about ME and don't even think about getting in my way"".  I'm not sure it's the dialog that is at fault here.  I think it is more the way Whalley projects her lines and the little smirk on her face that says ""I'm number one here"".  I'm not willing to blame Whalley for this.  Maybe that's what the director wanted from her as an actress.  But to me this is the number one reason this is not the great movie it could be.My second complaint has to do with some highly improbable circumstances.  For instance, Scarlett goes from being penniless to having the equivalent in today's dollars of about $10 million in the original GWTW then suddenly she is worth the equivalent of several billion dollars in the movie Scarlett.  None of this is explained fully in the movie and what little explanation there is, is not convincing to me.  I would not normally dwell on such a minor point except that Scarlett uses her vast new-found wealth to change the lives of the many people she comes in contact with.  Another highly improbable circumstance is when Good Sam goes from being a charming but uneducated field hand to a highly successful businessman.  Again, just not convincing to me.Finally, the overly graphic sexual encounters were completely unnecessary.  I was amazed they actually got away with showing this on TV back in 1994.  The scenes add nothing of value to the movie and were probably added just to appease the investors and movie moguls.Overall though, it was much better than I expected and I would recommend it as a must see.  If you can overlook the flaws, I think you will find Scarlett the movie enjoyable and entertaining and definitely worth seeing.",4,Good but could have been GREAT with some changes.,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3831,"['tried', 'watch', 'Scarlett', 'comparing', 'GWTW', 'many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'had', 'suggested', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'intertwined', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'are', 'current', 'situation', 'being', 'said', 'Scarlett', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'work', 'planning', 'thought', 'actual', 'depth', 'story', 'Scarlett', 'back', 'ancestral', 'homeland', 'Ireland', 'actually', 'lot', 'gaps', 'original', 'GWTW', 'Also', 'settings', 'costumes', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'done', 'colors', 'photography', 'are', 'outstanding', 'however', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'instead', '4:3', 'television', 'format', 'Unfortunately', '1994', 'when', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'few', 'directors', 'were', 'thinking', 'HDTV.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'convincing', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'find', 'always', 'comparing', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Actually', 'had', 'Dalton', 'been', 'cast', 'original', 'GWTW', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'better', 'Rhett', 'too', 'late', 'Gable', 'hard', 'act', 'follow.Getting', 'back', 'character', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'was', 'best', 'choice', 'here', 'fine', 'actress', 'indeed', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Sure', 'character', 'Scarlett', 'supposed', 'be', 'assertive', 'aggressive', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'bossy', 'times', 'mini-series', 'Scarlett', 'off', 'being', 'witch', 'spelled', 'b', 'least', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'distracting', 'downright', 'annoying', 'good', 'bit', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'GWTW', 'seen', 'movie', 'numerous', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'characterized', 'original', 'Scarlett', 'b-word', 'Even', 'could', 'get', 'little', 'self', 'centered', 'times', 'always', 'knew', 'heart', 'was', 'basically', 'good', 'person', 'maybe', 'just', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'emotions', 'ambitions.But', 'Whalley', 'playing', 'Scarlett', 'off', 'being', 'downright', 'sinister', 'times', 'Calling', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'perceive', 'Scarlett', 'thinking', 'ME', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'getting', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'dialog', 'fault', 'here', 'think', 'more', 'way', 'Whalley', 'projects', 'lines', 'little', 'smirk', 'face', ""'m"", 'number', 'one', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'willing', 'blame', 'Whalley', 'what', 'director', 'wanted', 'actress', 'number', 'one', 'reason', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'could', 'be.My', 'second', 'complaint', 'do', 'highly', 'improbable', 'circumstances', 'instance', 'Scarlett', 'being', 'penniless', 'having', 'equivalent', 'today', 'dollars', '10', 'million', 'original', 'GWTW', 'then', 'suddenly', 'equivalent', 'several', 'billion', 'dollars', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'None', 'explained', 'fully', 'movie', 'what', 'little', 'explanation', 'not', 'convincing', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'dwell', 'minor', 'point', 'Scarlett', 'vast', 'new-found', 'wealth', 'change', 'lives', 'many', 'people', 'contact', 'highly', 'improbable', 'circumstance', 'when', 'Good', 'Sam', 'being', 'charming', 'uneducated', 'field', 'hand', 'highly', 'successful', 'businessman', 'Again', 'just', 'not', 'convincing', 'me.Finally', 'overly', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'were', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'amazed', 'actually', 'got', 'away', 'showing', 'TV', 'back', '1994', 'scenes', 'add', 'nothing', 'value', 'movie', 'were', 'probably', 'added', 'just', 'appease', 'investors', 'movie', 'moguls.Overall', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'would', 'recommend', 'must', 'see', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'Scarlett', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",Scarlett Special Collector's Editon  VHS

410706,A18SL6NV2RU0Z5,6304274742,Colin Harrison,"[0, 0]","From the Damning-With-Faint-Praise Department: This sequel to ""Gone With the Wind"" is not as bad as it could have been.  And in fact, in several respects it is quite good, at least as entertainment.  I think Joanne Whalley and, especially, Timothy Dalton, make a pretty good pair of lead characters, as long as one doesn't expect Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.  In fact, the best way to enjoy this sequel - and one can enjoy it - is just to accept it for the pulp entertainment it is and not pine for the original.The story is intriguing with some nice twists and inventions, although there are a few too many over-the-top soap opera ""Oh, Come On, Now!"" moments, e.g. the the whole murder trial plot at the end. The 1939 classic was soap opera, too, but it was exalted soap opera and done with more style and flair than this one provides.  I liked some of the new characters, especially Sally, Mrs. Butler, and Grandfather Robillard (Sir John Gielgud exalts whatever he appears in).  The new Irish characters less so, particularly Scarlett's limp noodle of an Irish cousin.  Sean Bean's Snidely Whiplash bad guy is a bit much, although Bean does do good-looking villains well.Some have faulted Ripley for jettisoning a lot of Mitchell's characters.  I don't have a problem with that.  Mammy and Prissy would not be nearly as effective in the watered-down PC treatment they would have to receive today.  (The painfully PC exchange between Scarlett and ""Pansy,"" Prissy's replacement, makes one shudder at how Mammy and Prissy would have fared.) And good riddance to Ashley, the most tiresome character in Mitchell's book; this version has him collapsing on his knees in tears at Melanie's funeral, which is ridiculous.  Over all, Ripley and the director were probably wise to strike out in new directions, based on hints in Mitchell's original.  (Mrs. Butler, Grandfather Robillard and Scarlett's Savannah aunts are all mentioned in Mitchell's book but do not appear.)At least Scarlett's Irish grandmother knows somethin' about birthin' babies, even if the means are a bit unorthodox.Still, taken for what it is, this is worth a watch.

She wrote a masterpiece in the 1930's, then Alexandra Ripley bought the rights to her book by conning Margaret Mitchell's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative.  Alexandra Ripley's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush, even worse than a Barbara Courtland romance novel.Beautiful costumes and a good cast - but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche's.  The TV movie version is even worse than Alexandra Ripley's book. I would have given this movie zero stars - but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of Sean Bean as the deliciously evil Lord Fenton.Sean Bean heats up the screen as a sexy, feral villian along the lines of ""The Man You Love to Hate"" as an unsafe sex symbol.  Unless you are a Sean Bean fan, there is nothing worthwhile about this film.  The script is trite, cliche'd and very slow moving.  Sean Bean is only in Disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there.Disc 2 is overwrought with very boring, drawn out courtroom scenes...I was almost rooting that Scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie!I've always liked Joanna Whaley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton.

Timothy Dalton on the other hand I thought was brillantly cast but like most his films you like his character more than you are supposed to I think.

I found it quite interesting to meet Scarlett's posh relations on her mother's side, and I was glad that Suellen had finally got herself a husband, she wanted one os much, poor soul.  The killing off of Mammy is of course a big mistake, but the author clearly doesn't know how to portray black characters convincingly, which is I suppose why the film suddenly shifts to Ireland, where Scarlett goes to discover her roots.  From here on it's downhill all the way.  Pure melodrama, and Sean Bean is so blatantly wicked he might as well wear a hat with 'villain' written on it.  If only Margaret Mitchell had written a sequel herself!  Naturally I want Scarlett to get Rhett back, who doesn't, but the way it happens in this film is just too silly for words.

410735,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,6304274742,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[7, 9]","I am a huge, huge fan of ""Gone With The Wind"", and therefore had to really prep myself for this classic slice of early ninties TV Miniseries by completely abolishing my expectations, prejudices and memories of the indescribably brilliant prequel. ""Gone With The Wind"", I told myself, is an incredible motion picture, even now, some sixty eight years after its initial release. It's expansive, breathtaking, exciting, emotional, and absolutely riveting. ""Scarlett"", I replied, is a T.V. miniseries with that guy that used to be James Bond, and whats-her-name on a horse in ""Willow"".And so, bearing in mind these limitations, I sat down to an altogether pleasant surprise: ""Scarlett"" is no ""Gone With The Wind"", but it does what it does with vim and vigour, and is a very, very entertaining (and oftentimes side-splittingly hilarious) way to pass six hours.Basically: It's the day after the final scene of the original movie, and Scarlett shows up at Melanie Wilkes' funeral. She's still on her mission to recapture the affections of Rhett Butler, and must run a gamut of innumerable obstacles to get there, stretching from social disgrace, to the sale of Tara, to neatly sidestepping an incestuous relationship with her cousin - a Catholic priest - and becoming involved with a forerunner political group of the I.R.A.True to miniseries form, the production design and sets are expansive and spectacular - from Charleston and Atlanta to Dublin and London, the recreation of the historic backdrop of  the original ""Gone With The Wind"" is painstaking, and rewarding: a shame that there isn't the same talent behind the camera to photograph the beautiful sets and costumes in ""Scarlett"". Still, what's there is beautiful and very true to form, and visually, ""Scarlett"" works reasonably well.Acting-wise there's not a whole lot to stand out - Joanne Whalley-Kilmer isn't very good - bored and restrained - for the first ninety minutes or so, but then sinks her teeth into her role and is, for the main, a very watchable and likeable actress. Timothy Dalton, poor soul, is really dreadful as Rhett - his ""accent"" is the stuff of ridicule and he generally looks like he'd rather be anyplace else. Other principal nods go to Sean Bean as Evil Lord Richard Fenton, Rosaleen Linehan as the put-upon Irish housekeeper Mrs. Fitz., Colm Meany as Fr. Colum O' Hara, and John Gielgud as Grandfather Robillard.Sidebar: As an Irish man myself I am used to American actors forcing foul accents when Irishness is called for, but here, the actors are Irish so the accents are authentic, and that's a nice touch: even if the acting is, in parts, unspeakably foul, at least the audio is authentic!The minus points of casting come in the shape of Ann-Margaret as Belle Watling (Oh good Lord, she is appalling, it's like watching a slow-mo clip of a car accident with a big red wig on it) and bored, trite Annabeth Gish as repulsively ordinary Ann Hampton-Butler (although, given Dalton's reading of Rhett, maybe she's not so out of place after all?). When Ann meets her untimely demise (she dies of a nasty case of Plot), you feel relief and satisfaction - odd, since she's supposed to be a sympathetic character. Tina Kelleher as Mary Boyle puts me in mind of that ""Day In The Life Of An Irish Woman"" puppet vignette from the episode of ""Family Guy"", where Peter takes Chris to discover his Irish roots - Mary Boyle is the personification of everything pathetic, and so it's no surprise that her appearances on screen makes you want to vomit. Still, for entertainment value, her wild ramblings and attempted suicides can't be beat: this is real train-wreck acting wrought by a normally decent actress - she must have been in on the joke!So why, with an average, unintentionally hilarious cast and sub-average direction, am I awarding three stars to ""Scarlett""? Well, it's a miniseries, and I like miniseries. It's a bodice-ripping, pot-boiling, totally chiaroscuro romp through six hours of implausible plot twists (Scarlett, at one point, resembles Saint TooraLoora of Ireland with a direct line to Jesus), hilarious historical inaccuracies, plenty of ""Mommie Dearest""-esque overacting, and enough large gowns to keep a platoon of Drag Queens in work until the end of time. It's a lot of fun, but be warned: should you choose to watch it you WILL be bored silly for the first hour and a half or so: it's not really until Rhett leaves Scarlett in Charleston that the action really quickens pace. If you liked the likes of ""Sins"" and ""Master of the Game"" then you might like ""Scarlett"", too. Give it a chance and it will entertain you: as a continuation of ""Gone With The Wind"" it doesn't work at all, but then, what could have? ""Scarlett"" is self-contained, but for what it is, it's very enjoyable.",3,Hilarious!,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,4776,"['am', 'huge', 'huge', 'fan', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'therefore', 'had', 'really', 'prep', 'classic', 'slice', 'early', 'ninties', 'TV', 'Miniseries', 'completely', 'abolishing', 'expectations', 'prejudices', 'memories', 'indescribably', 'brilliant', 'prequel', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'told', 'incredible', 'motion', 'picture', 'even', 'now', 'sixty', 'eight', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'expansive', 'breathtaking', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'Scarlett', 'replied', 'T.V', 'miniseries', 'guy', 'used', 'be', 'James', 'Bond', 'whats-her-name', 'horse', 'Willow', '.And', 'so', 'bearing', 'mind', 'limitations', 'sat', 'down', 'altogether', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Scarlett', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'what', 'vim', 'vigour', 'very', 'very', 'entertaining', 'side-splittingly', 'hilarious', 'way', 'pass', 'six', 'hours.Basically', 'day', 'final', 'scene', 'original', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'up', 'Melanie', 'Wilkes', 'funeral', 'still', 'mission', 'recapture', 'affections', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'must', 'run', 'gamut', 'innumerable', 'obstacles', 'get', 'there', 'stretching', 'social', 'disgrace', 'sale', 'Tara', 'neatly', 'sidestepping', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'cousin', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'becoming', 'involved', 'forerunner', 'political', 'group', 'I.R.A.True', 'miniseries', 'form', 'production', 'design', 'sets', 'are', 'expansive', 'spectacular', 'Charleston', 'Atlanta', 'Dublin', 'London', 'recreation', 'historic', 'backdrop', 'original', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'painstaking', 'rewarding', 'shame', ""n't"", 'same', 'talent', 'camera', 'photograph', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Scarlett', 'Still', 'what', 'beautiful', 'very', 'true', 'form', 'visually', 'Scarlett', 'reasonably', 'well.Acting-wise', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'stand', 'out', 'Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'bored', 'restrained', 'first', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'so', 'then', 'teeth', 'role', 'main', 'very', 'watchable', 'likeable', 'actress', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'poor', 'soul', 'really', 'dreadful', 'Rhett', 'accent', 'stuff', 'ridicule', 'generally', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'anyplace', 'else', 'Other', 'principal', 'nods', 'go', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Evil', 'Lord', 'Richard', 'Fenton', 'Rosaleen', 'Linehan', 'put-upon', 'Irish', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs', 'Fitz.', 'Colm', 'Meany', 'Fr', 'Colum', 'O', 'Hara', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Grandfather', 'Robillard.Sidebar', 'Irish', 'man', 'am', 'used', 'American', 'actors', 'forcing', 'foul', 'accents', 'when', 'Irishness', 'called', 'here', 'actors', 'are', 'Irish', 'accents', 'are', 'authentic', 'nice', 'touch', 'even', 'acting', 'parts', 'unspeakably', 'foul', 'least', 'audio', 'authentic', 'minus', 'points', 'casting', 'come', 'shape', 'Ann-Margaret', 'Belle', 'Watling', 'Oh', 'good', 'Lord', 'appalling', 'watching', 'slow-mo', 'clip', 'car', 'accident', 'big', 'red', 'wig', 'bored', 'trite', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'repulsively', 'ordinary', 'Ann', 'Hampton-Butler', 'given', 'Dalton', 'reading', 'Rhett', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'place', 'When', 'Ann', 'untimely', 'demise', 'nasty', 'case', 'Plot', 'feel', 'relief', 'satisfaction', 'odd', 'supposed', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Tina', 'Kelleher', 'Mary', 'Boyle', 'mind', 'Day', 'Life', 'Irish', 'Woman', 'puppet', 'vignette', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'where', 'Peter', 'Chris', 'discover', 'Irish', 'roots', 'Mary', 'Boyle', 'personification', 'everything', 'pathetic', 'surprise', 'appearances', 'screen', 'want', 'vomit', 'Still', 'entertainment', 'value', 'wild', 'ramblings', 'attempted', 'suicides', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'real', 'train-wreck', 'acting', 'wrought', 'normally', 'decent', 'actress', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'joke', 'So', 'why', 'average', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'cast', 'sub-average', 'direction', 'am', 'awarding', 'three', 'stars', 'Scarlett', 'Well', 'miniseries', 'like', 'miniseries', 'bodice-ripping', 'pot-boiling', 'totally', 'chiaroscuro', 'romp', 'six', 'hours', 'implausible', 'plot', 'twists', 'Scarlett', 'one', 'point', 'Saint', 'TooraLoora', 'Ireland', 'direct', 'line', 'Jesus', 'hilarious', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'plenty', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', '-esque', 'overacting', 'enough', 'large', 'gowns', 'keep', 'platoon', 'Drag', 'Queens', 'work', 'end', 'time', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'warned', 'should', 'choose', 'watch', 'WILL', 'be', 'bored', 'silly', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'so', 'not', 'really', 'Rhett', 'Scarlett', 'Charleston', 'action', 'really', 'quickens', 'pace', 'liked', 'likes', 'Sins', 'Master', 'Game', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'Scarlett', 'too', 'Give', 'chance', 'will', 'entertain', 'continuation', 'Gone', 'Wind', ""n't"", 'work', 'then', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'Scarlett', 'self-contained', 'what', 'very', 'enjoyable']",Scarlett Special Collector's Editon  VHS

Timothy Dalton is excellent in his Clark Gable-follow-up to Rhett Butler, bringing a deep sense of humanity to the role lacking in Gable's performance. The story picks up right where &quot;GWTW&quot; left off, and we finally get to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett. Through this engrossing tale, Scarlett sets out to seek Rhett's love again, make peace with her past haunts, and discover her true identity. Her journey takes her from Atlanta to Charleston to Ireland and beyond before she can succeed in winning back the man she always loved. All the other memorable characters are back too: Ashley Wilkes, Mammy, Aunt Pittypat, Suellen and Will, just to name a few. And there are some new faces, as well: Jean Smart is immensely likable as Sally Brewten, a wily friend of the Butlers with a heart of gold. Colm Meaney is great in his role of Colum O'Hara, Scarlett's Irish cousin. And Ann-Margret makes a memorable cameo as Atlanta's leading madam, Belle Watling, along with Esther Rolle in the part of Mammy. And Sean Bean is very effective in his role of Richard Fenton, an Englishman whom Scarlett meets up with... and later regrets. A lively script, crisp direction, and gorgeous cinematography blend together perfectly to create the most anxiously awaited sequel in history... and it's all worth the wait!",5,A GREAT FOLLOW-UP TO &quot;GONE WITH THE WIND&quot;!,971308800,"10 12, 2000",2000,1908,"['most', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'sequel', 'history', 'proves', 'be', 'well', 'worth', 'nearly', 'sixty', 'years', 'waiting', 'quot', 'Scarlett', 'quot', 'lavish', 'epic', 'film', 'up', 'loose', 'strings', 'left', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'quot', 'not', 'combining', 'original', 'elements', 'quot', 'GWTW', 'quot', 'indeed', 'long', 'film', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'film', 'Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'excellent', 'tempestuous', 'post-Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Butler', 'bringing', 'freshness', 'originality', 'role', 'so', 'unique', 'diminishing', 'Leigh', 'emblazonment', 'role', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'excellent', 'Clark', 'Gable-follow-up', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'bringing', 'deep', 'sense', 'humanity', 'role', 'lacking', 'Gable', 'performance', 'story', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'quot', 'GWTW', 'quot', 'left', 'off', 'finally', 'get', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Scarlett', 'Rhett', 'engrossing', 'tale', 'Scarlett', 'out', 'seek', 'Rhett', 'love', 'again', 'make', 'peace', 'past', 'haunts', 'discover', 'true', 'identity', 'journey', 'Atlanta', 'Charleston', 'Ireland', 'can', 'succeed', 'winning', 'back', 'man', 'always', 'loved', 'other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'too', 'Ashley', 'Wilkes', 'Mammy', 'Aunt', 'Pittypat', 'Suellen', 'Will', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'are', 'new', 'as', 'well', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'immensely', 'likable', 'Sally', 'Brewten', 'wily', 'friend', 'Butlers', 'heart', 'gold', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'great', 'role', 'Colum', ""O'Hara"", 'Scarlett', 'Irish', 'cousin', 'Ann-Margret', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'Atlanta', 'leading', 'madam', 'Belle', 'Watling', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'part', 'Mammy', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'very', 'effective', 'role', 'Richard', 'Fenton', 'Englishman', 'whom', 'Scarlett', 'up', 'later', 'regrets', 'lively', 'script', 'crisp', 'direction', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'blend', 'together', 'perfectly', 'create', 'most', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'sequel', 'history', 'wait']",Scarlett Special Collector's Editon  VHS

Sure, its not as great as the original and was a trifle politically correct, but I LOVED seeing the beautiful costumes, handsome actors, and of course our beloved fibbing procrastinating Scarlett. The plot? Well, after reading numerous romance novels, I can't honestly say there is anything TOO original here, Scarlett and Rhett (played by hunky Timothy Dalton) eventually part because of a 'big misunderstanding,' but reunite after Scarlett is accused of a hideous crime.Peeves? I really hated to see Scarlett grovel towards the end. I felt Rhett was just as much to blame for the divorce. Also, I felt it unrealistic that the maid and butler would stand by and allow Scarlett be assaulted with a fire poker. Please. Also, I wanted to know what happened to Mary. This is never mentioned, and I felt the authors should've come up with a better manner of getting Scarlett off the hook. I was really surprised that Scarlett (always a pretty decent judge of male character), would fall for Lord Fenton.
