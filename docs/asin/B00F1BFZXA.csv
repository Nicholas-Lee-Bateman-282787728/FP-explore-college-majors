There's very little to no action, the characters are annoying, & there's not much of a story. I took a chance when I bought season 1, thinking it would be a good werewolf type show. I don't know why this show is so highly rated. Maybe it's good for little kids, but it's definitely not for me. I gave my copy away & will not be purchasing the other seasons.

(Wolfbloods are born that way unlike werewolves who are bitten to transform.)  They go through many different difficulties keeping their secret of changing to a wolf on full moon nights.  No one knows but their families, at first.The shows are done well for young children and last a half hour.  No extreme violence shown for the most part.  There's young love but no kissing or sex shown.  The live scenery is beautiful.I first saw it on the Disney channel.The only negatve of the show is that it is only season one.

I was pleasantly surprised by this sweet tale of two teenage werewolves in which the trait is inheirited. Even though this is very obviously England, the appeal is universal. Maddy is on the verge of being able to change to a full wolf when  Rhydian, a boy who has moved from family to family in the system starts at her school, the first wolfblood her own age she has ever known. Over the season the mythology behind the the tale is slowly developed. Interaction with Maddy, her parents and  Rhydian are complex and feel normal.

At first I wasn't sure what to think, but as the season progresses, the understanding of what wolfbloods are comes into focus.  They're not werewolves.  They're born wolfbloods, not bitten or transformed in any way.Since this is a BBC production, all the characters have accents, which can be initially difficult to understand.  The only major downside to the show is that it's only a 30 minute TV program.  The plot development would be better if the show were actually an hour program.The actors weren't great at the beginning, but as the show progresses, they seem to come into their characters better.  The school drama is pretty much the same as all the other teen school shows, but the added twist helps to bypass the cooklie-cutter drama.I suggest watching a few episodes before passing any judgement.
