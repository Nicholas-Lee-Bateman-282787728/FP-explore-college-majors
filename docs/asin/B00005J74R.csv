Ultimately, ""Last Place"" givesa very good presentation of the different approaches to polarexploration that Amundsen and Scott had.  Unfortunately, ""Shackleton"" did not do this as well.  Scott, a typical product of the hidebound Royal Navy and the class-ridden societythat made up late Victorian Britain believes that technology combined with immense will-power and ""natural superiority of the Englishman"" will overcome all obstacles.Amundsen, a citizen of newly independent Norway, was much more open-minded and willing to make due with less.  Unlike the British who believed they were a superior civilization and had nothing to learn from ""inferior natives"" like the Eskimos had clothing and food that was less well adapted to life in the very harsh polar climate.  This flexibility that Amundsen had led him to adopt the clothing of the Eskimos and also led him to be more concerned about the problem of scurvey which plagued previous expeditions to the polar regions. This meant that Amundsen's men were much healthier (they actually gained weight on the journey!) than Scott's.  By using dogs, there was less physical strain on the Norweigians than on the British who pulled their sled by themselves for much of the trip.Amundsen was a meticulous planner whereas Scott had a tendency to rely on the British habit of ""muddling through"" and hoping that things will work out.  In the end, these differences meant the difference between life or death for the two expeditions.It is true that Roland Huntford whose book of the same name is the basis of the series has a real hatred for Scott which comes out again and again and showing a negative image of Scott which is probably exaggerated in the series, but Amundsen's flaws are also brought out such as his hiding the truth about his plans to go to the South Pole instead of exploring the Arctic as he claimed he was going to do and his almost disastrous too-early start to the South Pole which brought out his conflict with the legendary Hjalmar Johansen.  Thus, I believe the viewer does come out of the series with a pretty honest idea of the truth about the race to the Pole and the very different outcomes for the two expeditions.Beside the outstanding script and acting, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and the almost hurculean efforts to film this in the harsh environment of Greenland really paid off in making making one of the most impressive productions ever to be seen on television or the cinema.  Anyone who is interested in history, exploration, or the psychology of men in extreme conditions will immensely enjoy this treasure.",5,Possibly the Finest Adventure Series Ever Televised,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,2865,"['decided', 'write', 'review', 'seeing', 'televisiondramatization', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'Endurance', 'expedition.Although', 'have', 'seen', 'Last', 'Place', 'many', 'times', 'seeing', 'Shackleton', 'not', 'bad', 'made', 'appreciate', 'howgood', 'Last', 'Place', 'really', 'Ultimately', 'Last', 'Place', 'givesa', 'very', 'good', 'presentation', 'different', 'approaches', 'polarexploration', 'Amundsen', 'Scott', 'had', 'Unfortunately', 'Shackleton', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Scott', 'typical', 'product', 'hidebound', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'class-ridden', 'societythat', 'made', 'up', 'late', 'Victorian', 'Britain', 'technology', 'combined', 'immense', 'will-power', 'natural', 'superiority', 'Englishman', 'will', 'overcome', 'obstacles.Amundsen', 'citizen', 'newly', 'independent', 'Norway', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'open-minded', 'willing', 'make', 'due', 'less', 'British', 'who', 'believed', 'were', 'superior', 'civilization', 'had', 'nothing', 'learn', 'inferior', 'natives', 'Eskimos', 'had', 'clothing', 'food', 'was', 'less', 'well', 'adapted', 'life', 'very', 'harsh', 'polar', 'climate', 'flexibility', 'Amundsen', 'had', 'led', 'adopt', 'clothing', 'Eskimos', 'also', 'led', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'problem', 'scurvey', 'plagued', 'previous', 'expeditions', 'polar', 'regions', 'meant', 'Amundsen', 'men', 'were', 'much', 'healthier', 'actually', 'gained', 'weight', 'journey', 'Scott', 'using', 'dogs', 'was', 'less', 'physical', 'strain', 'Norweigians', 'British', 'who', 'pulled', 'sled', 'much', 'trip.Amundsen', 'was', 'meticulous', 'planner', 'whereas', 'Scott', 'had', 'tendency', 'rely', 'British', 'habit', 'muddling', 'hoping', 'things', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'differences', 'meant', 'difference', 'life', 'death', 'two', 'expeditions.It', 'true', 'Roland', 'Huntford', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'basis', 'series', 'real', 'hatred', 'Scott', 'out', 'again', 'again', 'showing', 'negative', 'image', 'Scott', 'probably', 'exaggerated', 'series', 'Amundsen', 'flaws', 'are', 'also', 'brought', 'out', 'such', 'hiding', 'truth', 'plans', 'go', 'South', 'Pole', 'instead', 'exploring', 'Arctic', 'claimed', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'almost', 'disastrous', 'too-early', 'start', 'South', 'Pole', 'brought', 'out', 'conflict', 'legendary', 'Hjalmar', 'Johansen', 'Thus', 'believe', 'viewer', 'come', 'series', 'pretty', 'honest', 'idea', 'truth', 'race', 'Pole', 'very', 'different', 'outcomes', 'two', 'expeditions.Beside', 'outstanding', 'script', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'almost', 'hurculean', 'efforts', 'film', 'harsh', 'environment', 'Greenland', 'really', 'paid', 'off', 'making', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'productions', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'television', 'cinema', 'Anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'history', 'exploration', 'psychology', 'men', 'extreme', 'conditions', 'will', 'immensely', 'enjoy', 'treasure']",N/A

Roland Huntford's account of the big race between Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott speaks out the truth that was omitted when Scott's diary was first published, and kept from public interest so that Scott could be claimed as a hero throughout the British Empire. Though Amundsen claimed the South Pole one month ahead of Scott, the British looked upon him as an inferior and giving Scott all the glory. I've had the opportunity as a boy to meet the real Tryggve Gran, the youngest member of the South Pole Expedition more than once, who accompanied Scott to Antarctica as ski instructor. Gran, who was in his late seventies when I met him at his home in Norway, had written several books about the South Pole Expeditions of the two men. Gran knew that Scott was in trouble from the very beginning. The filming sequence was shot in the Arctic regions of northern Canada and Greenland where the actors could experience the real effects that those they portrayed had felt. Temperatures dipped down as low as -60F and howling winds were prevalent. This was done in order to get as close to reality as possible.

582488,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B00005J74R,Joanna Daneman,"[11, 11]","I'm a fan of history, the History Channel and all things exploration on earth or the moon. The story of the expeditions to both poles of the earth have fascinated me since I owned my first globe as an elementary school pupil. I used to trace the routes of Byrd, Amundsen and Scott with my finger across the paper-covered sphere and later, I read all I could on Shackleton, Scott, Cook, Perry and Amundsen.Years ago, Masterpiece Theater aired this seven part (six part back then) mini-series on the race to the Pole. It was based on Roland Huntford's worthy but controversial book. At the time, I was totally smitten with the series which was haunting in its tragedy and in its moral lessons about management and leadership.I obtained this copy of the series on DVD and we found, 20 years later, that it was as fresh and stunning as when originally aired.The music is excellent except for one overly 80's bit to cover a wordless section of skiing across the polar plateau. The South Pole has its own leitmotif, something rather like a ripoff of the Holy Grail leitmotif from Wagner's Parsifal, but what a good idea! The cinematography was for television, not film, so no letterboxing or wide shots, but the shots are cleverly framed to take advantage of the scenery and the camera angles are well conceived.The acting is top-notch: Martin Shaw is perfect as the introspective, political man Scott, driven by his feelings of inadequacy and his Valkerie hero-worshipping wife Kathleen. Amundsen is played by Sverre Ousdal, a great Norwegian actor. Ousdal uses his face and body to express a man who is short on words but long on action and deep feeling. The rest of the cast is so eerily well-chosen that if you read the books by Cherry Garrard and the accounts of the Pole and look at the photos, you will be amazed.The pace of the series quickens when the race between Scott and Amundsen is at its peak; and the horrors start piling on. There is no way you can come away from this series and not realize what an inhospitable place Antarctica really is. The film winds down after the shocking revelations on the fate of the Scott team, and leaves one thinking about men, their deeds and how it was when the earth still had wild places for men to be the first to set foot on.If you love history, exploration, National Geographic, and brave deeds of men, you really have to have this series. I'd recommend it for older kids doing home schooling (it's a bit shocking for the very young...use your judgment here. Frostbitten feet and scurvy are dramatically but not overly horribly depicted and the fate of dogs and horses is something you'll have to explain to the kids as well.)No extras on the DVD--this was filmed before VHS and DVD were available or widely distributed, so the studio did not have footage included for extra features.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,Must-see TV?

At the time it seemed like the most absurdly long movie I'd ever heard of, spanning six VHS tapes.  I was dubious, to put it mildy, and the first episode concerning the set up for the expedition didn't do much to impress me....Then the second episode started up, and I was hooked.As the title would suggest, it's really quite hard to think of how to describe this series.  It features so many powerful moments, so many exemplary performances, that any summary I could give would feel lacking.  I have never seen a more faithful or more compelling look at the race to be the first to reach the South Pole than this one.  The direction and cinematography is very simple, letting the endless white landscape do most of the work in telling the story.  Ample long shots which must have been amazingly difficult to film reveal a landscape unmarred by footprints or any other signs of humanity save for the small column of explorers forging their way through the snow.  Meticulous attention to detail brings the reality of the desolate yet beautiful Antarctic landscape home in a way that feels almost brutally honest.  There is no attempt to glorify or villify anyone.  No enemy but nature.  And it needs none.Anyone who is even barely interested in the history surrounding these expeditions owes it to themselves to give this a watch.

When the DVD came out, I bought it instantly.The acting is superb, the scenery is devastatingly beautiful, and boringly deadly.The race to the pole is chronicled in this fascinating dramatization of the race between Amundsen and Scott in 1911.  I was glued to my chair during the entire miniseries.  The story may be well-known, but to have the tragedy of the English expedition played out lets us all in on the heartbreak.  Scott and remaining crew were only a few miles from their stocked food drop at 'One Ton Depot'.Amundsen comes across as better prepared (and certainly more successful), but cold and dispassionate.Highly recommended.A follow-up:  I just rewatched this miniseries and can say it holds up very well for a production which is now 22 years old.  Knowing the story better, I could concentrate more on the acting and how Amundsen and Scott come across.  The series is based on the book 'Scott and Amundsen' by Roland Huntford.  It is plain that Huntford disliked Scott, and the miniseries bears out this bias.  Scott comes across as a bit of a unplanned bumbler who makes very obvious mistakes (sending a man who pleads he knows nothing about horses to buy Siberian ponies), and manages to get pretty much of his entire crew set against him.I would have liked a bit more balance in the miniseries, but they're never going to make one as exhaustive as this again, and this is plenty good enough.Highly recommended upon re-viewing.",5,'Am Turning South',1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,1942,"['Amundsen', 'uttered', 'words', 'similar', 'once', 'first', 'goal', 'conquest', 'North', 'Pole', 'was', 'achieved', 'could', 'get', 'there', 'One', 'final', 'goal', 'remained', 'South', 'Pole', 'harshest', 'most', 'inhospitable', 'place', 'earth', 'Nothing', 'there', 'few', 'return', 'vast', 'white', 'highlands', 'pole.The', 'last', 'continent', 'Earth', 'final', 'unexplored', 'vast', 'white', 'space', 'trip', 'doubtful', 'return', 'race', 'pole', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'meant', 'be.This', 'was', 'miniseries', 'PBS', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'bought', 'instantly.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'scenery', 'devastatingly', 'beautiful', 'boringly', 'deadly.The', 'race', 'pole', 'chronicled', 'fascinating', 'dramatization', 'race', 'Amundsen', 'Scott', '1911', 'was', 'glued', 'chair', 'entire', 'miniseries', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'well-known', 'have', 'tragedy', 'English', 'expedition', 'played', 'out', 'lets', 'heartbreak', 'Scott', 'remaining', 'crew', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'miles', 'stocked', 'food', 'drop', ""'One"", 'Ton', ""Depot'.Amundsen"", 'better', 'prepared', 'certainly', 'more', 'successful', 'cold', 'dispassionate.Highly', 'recommended.A', 'follow-up', 'just', 'rewatched', 'miniseries', 'can', 'say', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'production', 'now', '22', 'years', 'old', 'Knowing', 'story', 'better', 'could', 'concentrate', 'more', 'acting', 'how', 'Amundsen', 'Scott', 'come', 'series', 'based', 'book', 'Amundsen', 'Roland', 'Huntford', 'plain', 'Huntford', 'disliked', 'Scott', 'miniseries', 'bias', 'Scott', 'across', 'bit', 'unplanned', 'bumbler', 'who', 'very', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'sending', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'horses', 'buy', 'Siberian', 'ponies', 'get', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'crew', 'set', 'him.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'balance', 'miniseries', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'make', 'one', 'as', 'exhaustive', 'again', 'plenty', 'good', 'enough.Highly', 'recommended', 're-viewing']",N/A

582496,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005J74R,Trevor Willsmer,"[13, 13]","The Last Place On Earth is a now forgotten British mini-series that's worth remembering. Based on Roland Huntford's still controversial myth-shattering biography of Scott and Amundsen's race to the South Pole, it's the kind of thing which would be done in a rushed 2-3 hours at most today, but in 1985 got more than twice that running time over seven episodes. The benefits are amazing. It may take three episodes for the rivals to hit Antarctic waters, but Trevor Griffiths' excellent script, despite a few liberties with history, chronology and supporting characters (particularly Brian Dennehy's Frederick Cook, both men prone to dramatic license), has enough room for its characters' flaws and virtues to be fully explored and quietly builds up real involvement.Martin Shaw's Scott gets most of the flaws, though the show doesn't go quite so overboard with them as Huntford's book (to be fair, Scott's pomposity and ability to repeat disastrous mistakes gave him lots of ammo). But despite being played rather superbly with a charismatic twinkle in his eye by Sverre Anker Ousdal, Amundsen isn't perfect either, as his disastrously mismanaged false start and his jealousy and antagonism toward a more famous member of his expedition demonstrate. Although the story doesn't allow it to be explored, the final episode contains plenty of hints of the bitter man he would eventually become as his victory was increasingly overshadowed by the `glory' of Scott's failure.Ferdinand Fairfax's direction is impressively cinematic, one episode boasting a complex uninterrupted travelling take that's almost up there with Touch of Evil if only on a technical level. There's a lot of familiar British actors when they were still little-knowns among the supporting cast - Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Michael Maloney, Pat Roach, Richard Wilson and one of the lesser Dr Whos, Sylvester McCoy (excellent here) among them - as well as the one-time star of guilty pleasure Song of Norway, Toralv Maurstead, looking considerably older than his years as an ill-starred member of Amundsen's expedition (for once, with the exception of Max Von's Sydow's Nansen, the Norwegians are played by real Norwegians). Per Theodor Haugen also makes his mark as Amundsen's brother, constantly left to deal with the details and itinerary of the everyday life the explorer cannot deal with and Stephen Moore quietly shines as Scott's only real friend. There are a couple of moments that don't really work - Scott glimpsing what he thinks is a cross at Cape Evans where his own memorial would later stand is shot far too literally and the very 80s rock scoring of Amundsen crossing the mountains to the plateau is horribly sub-Chariots of Fire - and none of Amundsen's team on the Polar trek itself ever become characters in their own right the way Scott's men do, but they're minor flaws. This has a 9.4 rating on the IMDB. It earned it.Thankfully, unlike some recent mini-series releases, this hasn't been crudely cropped in fake widescreen but is in its original fullframe ratio, with all seven episodes presented with opening and closing titles over three discs. The quality isn't demo standard, but that's partially down to the original filmstock that was used (its look is typical of 70s-80s British TV), although the picture quality is noticeably sharper in the last two episodes.
