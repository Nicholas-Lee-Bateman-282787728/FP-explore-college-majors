I was so shocked that these talented actors and actresses allowed themselves to be seen in this movie. They must have owed Duane Martin a favor, he wrote the film. I could not even believed that Will &amp; Jada Smith financially backed the film and Vivica A. Fox should have never stooped this low....dayum.Duane Martin what trying so hard to be a thug in this movie, but it definitely did not work, not in the least. The story line was so corny.Jadakiss should stick to rapping, because acting is not one of his strong points.I was very happy to see one of my classmates from John Jay College in Manhattan, Phil Hayes in the movie, he had a short part but he did da dayum thang. I'm glad to see he is doing him.Back to the movie, instead of it going straight to DVD is should of went straight to the trash.Later!!!",2,And Another One,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,941,"['low', 'budget', 'movie', 'put', 'shelf.I', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'great', 'cast', 'movie', 'had', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'was', 'so', 'shocked', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'allowed', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'owed', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'favor', 'wrote', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'believed', 'Will', 'amp', 'Jada', 'Smith', 'financially', 'backed', 'film', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'stooped', 'low', '.dayum.Duane', 'Martin', 'what', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'thug', 'movie', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'not', 'least', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'so', 'corny.Jadakiss', 'should', 'stick', 'rapping', 'acting', 'not', 'one', 'strong', 'points.I', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'one', 'classmates', 'John', 'Jay', 'College', 'Manhattan', 'Phil', 'Hayes', 'movie', 'had', 'short', 'part', 'did', 'da', 'dayum', 'thang', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'doing', 'him.Back', 'movie', 'instead', 'going', 'straight', 'DVD', 'should', 'went', 'straight', 'trash.Later']",N/A

There were other elements in the film that I noticed and wondered about.Near the beginning, what were they doing to those animals? Did Duane have to shoot them down for it? It was never explained neither was the motive for the shooting.I never really understood what Vivica A. Fox's career was in this film.Meagan Good's character was very predictable. I was suspicious of her early on in the film for her clueless nature about her own husband.There were too many instances were people pulled out guns to threaten people. Also, there is a scene were Vivica blows Meagan to pieces. How was she able to do that? Is this a action thriller or an episode of power rangers?If you are a Duane Martin fan, I'll say watch it.",4,I liked it,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,801,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'loved', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'cool', 'funny', 'blast', 'watch', 'were', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'noticed', 'wondered', 'beginning', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'animals', 'Did', 'Duane', 'have', 'shoot', 'down', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'was', 'motive', 'shooting.I', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'career', 'was', 'film.Meagan', 'Good', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'was', 'suspicious', 'early', 'film', 'clueless', 'nature', 'own', 'husband.There', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'instances', 'were', 'people', 'pulled', 'out', 'guns', 'threaten', 'people', 'Also', 'scene', 'were', 'Vivica', 'blows', 'Meagan', 'pieces', 'How', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'action', 'thriller', 'episode', 'power', 'rangers', 'are', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'say', 'watch']",N/A

At no point before, during of after this film does it imply ""true or actual events"".It is far to easy for viewers to get online and downplay, belittle or outright disrespect the efforts of others, while they remain ""nobodies"" themselves.  Until you have walked a mile in someone else's shoes, you should try to be bit more understanding and appreciatvie.  Didn't yo mama tell you....If you don't have anything nice to say (or at least not nasty), then don't say anything at all?Yes!  There were parts in this movie that were so far fetched, it was laughable but, there were also aspects of the movies that are commendable.
