The dances continue to be challenging enough to be fun for me, but easy enough for my little girl to love it. The variety of music is splendid!What wonderful thing has happened to Murray's voice? He always sounded good enough, but now he has a rich, concert worthy baritone that was as lovely as it was unexpected. Jeff has relaxed enough to look as though he is enjoying his dancing at last instead of doing it for the sake of his friends. Sam seems to be finding his place, and Anthony has become very relaxed in front of the camera (almost preening) and a very good dancer.There was a lot of raw beauty in the early years, and more interaction with real kids. I feel this is a great use of resources, just the same.If you choose to use the captions, they are excellently done.

The thing I really like about this DVD in particular is that they take songs that an adult would like and do remakes in such a way that everyone can enjoy.  I've taken my girl to two of their concerts and I've seen them sing these songs live; my daughter HAD to tell me that only the kids were allowed to dance to the Wiggles.  What a disappointment.For anyone who doesn't know much about the Wiggles, it's an Australian band that plays kids' music, and they're taking the world by storm.  They are magnificent.  I think maybe you have to see them live in concert at least one time in order to fully appreciate them.  It is helpful for your child to see the DVD for the particular show before you go to see it (more than once ideally) so that they -- and you -- can fully appreciate the show.If you're considering this DVD, go for it!",5,This DVD Rocks!

I saw this having 60 reviews, mostly positive and bought it. Big fat bust. My 4.5 y/o--who was so excited about this DVD--turned it off 3 songs into it.Being new to the Wiggles and never having seen the show, I just assumed this DVD would be like The Big Red Car--live show format with some skits, some songs, some Wiggles-led dancing. Instead it's like a Wiggles MTV-80's video with the Wiggles singing songs, one after another with digital enhancement.Unless you're looking for some background music, I'd skip it altogether. As far as something to sit and watch, it's useless in my opinion. But that being said, I had to come back and edit this review because we DID use it as background music, and my 2 y/o loves it. My preschooler enjoys doing some of the dances and the songs are catchy, as usual. Still, out of the many Wiggles DVDs we own, this is the least played, and we usually have to suggest/encourage it.So for my new edited review, I've raised this from 1 to 3 stars.

1159247,A2MMYN8VLJ63J0,B0018BA6WM,,"[2, 5]","Update:I have bumped this up from 1 start to 2 stars. Here is what I have figured out about ""newer"" Wiggles videos. In the beginning, they were awesome to get your kids up and MOVING and DANCING. Now, many of them are more like ""toe tapping"" tunes rather than good exciting DANCE tunes. I do put this in on occasion for backgrond music, but we refer to it as ""the boring Wiggles DVD."" So, some ok songs, but don't expect to DANCE to this (ironic, right?).Prior review is below:All I can say is ""What were they thinking?"" and ""How is it possible any pre-k or toddler child really likes this?"" -My 13 year old son was nuts over the old Wiggles when little, so I was thrilled to recentely pull out the old tapes and introduce them to my 18 month old who went equally nuts for them...already dancing around to the catchiest songs. I was even more thrilled to find many more Wiggles videos have been made over the years and happily ordered several new ones from Amazon. Watched this one today and was shocked by how terrible it was, and how out of touch it was with what young kids like. It's full of long stretches of instrumentals...there is even one number with a bunch of adults waltzing. Are you kidding me? What toddler wants to watch Waltzing? Another song was nothing but meowing.  Not at ALL like the simple catchy songs with dance moves that are easy and fun to follow from the old videos (pretend to be a bear or chicken etc...THAT is what is fun for little kids, not rocket science here). While I did like the first song on the video and it mildly held my son's attention, by song 2 my toddler lost interest and ignored the rest of the DVD. What a waste of money.I was open to giving the new ""Sam"" a chance, and he can sing just fine, but the Wiggles ""product"" is not what it used to be. Maybe Greg used to write all the songs and now they don't know what to do. But in the newer videos it seems you find a lot of animation and goofy wigs and things to try to distract you from the fact the music and songs simply aren't that good anymore. It breaks my heart to say this as I've loved, loved, loved the Wiggles for so long, but it seems they lost their magic and I can't recommend this DVD at all. If it grows on my son with time I will update this review to be fair...I will continue to pop it in as background music now and then even though It's pretty bad.Oh, also two of the new Wiggles DVDs won't play properly in one of my DVD players, another bizarre issue that I can't explain, all other DVDs work fine.If you have money to throw around I guess you can try this video, but I'd recommend you save your money and stick with the classics.",2,Disappointed Wiggles Fan.

I personally think that Sam sings better than Greg ever did -- you know, it's become the whole Sammy Hagar vs. David Lee Roth thing for the preschool set.  Unfortunately, I think their popularity in the states is waning.  This has everything to do with Playhouse Disney.  When our oldest boy was born in 2003, the Wiggles were on practically all morning.  Disney realized they were missing out on merchandising and began to create more and more shows of their own with their own sets of toys and clothes tie-ins.  The means that the Wiggles have been banished to 6 a.m. (Central time) and they are not seen as often.  Even then, Disney only shows older shows that still have Greg, so it is very confusing for preschoolers to see Sam on the videos now.  Now Disney has given the Imagination Movers their own show and I suspect they will phase out the Wiggles almost entirely.  Too bad.  Their show is pretty fun.Now to the video.  It is very colorful and well produced and the Beatles outfits and wigs cracked me up.  If you can get past a very scary looking aged Leo Sayer doing his best falsetto on the first song, then your children will most likely enjoy this DVD.",4,Good DVD.

She can't do the dance moves as good as he can but she's working on it!!! Seriously, our whole family loves this DVD which has songs that I remember singing in high school (you make me feel like dancing).  It was great to see the original artist perform it (Thank you Leo Sayer).  I later watched several other Wiggle DVDs but this is far my fave.  I can't believe other reviewers find this one boring - have they seen the latest Barney dvds?  We're all new to the Wiggles since we only now have a little one in our family (his siblings are MUCH older than he is) so it's great to see how much better preschool programs are since the mid '80's to mid 90's.  Honestly watching this dvd felt like we were watching a specially made ""music video"" for preschoolers.  This is the BEST Wiggle dvd and I also love Same Wiggle.  You're a great singer, Sam and I can appreciate your ability since I'm a musician too.Bottom line - YOU ROCK, WIGGLES!!!!",5,My almost 17 year old daughter loves it too!!!,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,1062,"['daughter', 'mad', 'writing', 'DVD', 'as', 'much', 'almost', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'dance', 'moves', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'working', 'Seriously', 'whole', 'family', 'DVD', 'songs', 'remember', 'singing', 'high', 'school', 'make', 'feel', 'dancing', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'original', 'artist', 'perform', 'Thank', 'Leo', 'Sayer', 'later', 'watched', 'several', 'other', 'Wiggle', 'DVDs', 'far', 'fave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'other', 'reviewers', 'find', 'one', 'boring', 'have', 'seen', 'latest', 'Barney', 'dvds', ""'re"", 'new', 'Wiggles', 'only', 'now', 'have', 'little', 'one', 'family', 'siblings', 'are', 'MUCH', 'older', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'preschool', 'programs', 'are', 'mid', 'mid', '90', 'Honestly', 'watching', 'dvd', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'specially', 'made', 'music', 'video', 'preschoolers', 'BEST', 'Wiggle', 'dvd', 'also', 'love', 'Same', 'Wiggle', ""'re"", 'great', 'singer', 'Sam', 'can', 'appreciate', 'ability', ""'m"", 'musician', 'too.Bottom', 'line', 'YOU', 'ROCK', 'WIGGLES']",The Wiggles: You Make Me Feel Like Dancing

Smith ""Steampunk Enthusiast""","[23, 23]","There is an age difference between my boys and my middle child grew up on the ""old"" Wiggles with Greg and love them.  These ""new"" Wiggles of course have Sam instead now. Though I was sad to read about Greg's health issues, Sam, his replacement, brings a new energy and vocal focus to the group.My 18 month old and my 5 year old both adore this DVD, as do my wife and I, and even the ""too cool"" 6th grade middle-schooler in our home.  I actually found myself singing these songs to myself at work all day after first playing the DVD for my kids.  From classics like ""Old Dan Tucker"" and the ""Hornpipe"" to the ""Shimmy Shake"", every song here is wonderfully performed.The Wiggles program that my 5 year old knew as a toddler was mostly skits with music thrown in now and again.  This DVD is all music, all the time.  The fantastic CGI sets and colorful characters combine for a truly stimulating experience.  There are so many songs that kids will have no problem singing along to.  The choreography and dancing that support the main cast are great...some old dancers and newer faces too...all bring even more energy to the DVD.This 38 year-old dad of three boys ""feels like dancing"" too when he watches this DVD.  The final refrain of the last song on the DVD is ""and we all like Sam"".  Yes we do...you are my boys favorite Wiggle!",5,"The Wiggles...YES, They DO make you feel like dancing...",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,1329,"['age', 'difference', 'boys', 'middle', 'child', 'grew', 'up', 'old', 'Greg', 'love', 'new', 'Wiggles', 'course', 'have', 'Sam', 'instead', 'now', 'was', 'sad', 'read', 'Greg', 'health', 'issues', 'Sam', 'replacement', 'new', 'energy', 'vocal', 'focus', 'group.My', '18', 'month', 'old', '5', 'year', 'old', 'DVD', 'do', 'wife', 'even', 'too', 'cool', '6th', 'grade', 'middle-schooler', 'home', 'actually', 'found', 'singing', 'songs', 'myself', 'work', 'day', 'first', 'playing', 'DVD', 'kids', 'classics', 'Old', 'Dan', 'Tucker', 'Hornpipe', 'Shimmy', 'Shake', 'song', 'here', 'wonderfully', 'performed.The', 'Wiggles', 'program', '5', 'year', 'old', 'knew', 'toddler', 'was', 'mostly', 'music', 'thrown', 'now', 'again', 'DVD', 'music', 'time', 'fantastic', 'CGI', 'sets', 'colorful', 'characters', 'combine', 'truly', 'stimulating', 'experience', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'songs', 'kids', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'singing', 'along', 'choreography', 'dancing', 'main', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'old', 'dancers', 'newer', 'too', 'bring', 'even', 'more', 'energy', 'DVD.This', '38', 'year-old', 'dad', 'three', 'boys', 'feels', 'dancing', 'too', 'when', 'DVD', 'final', 'refrain', 'last', 'song', 'DVD', 'Sam', 'Yes', 'do', 'are', 'boys', 'favorite', 'Wiggle']",The Wiggles: You Make Me Feel Like Dancing
