979399,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B000EWBKIK,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[0, 0]","Usually Jackie Chan's movies have a substantial amount of humor in them, usually intermixed with the action sequences. To me that has always been a draw, as the dangerous stunt seem choreographed and flawless, the outtakes show a much more painful reality. But the finished work is usually awe inspiring. With this new addition to the Police Story saga, Jackie goes for broke. It's a melange of eastern Hong Kong movie styles and Western Styles. Jackie's inspector ends up falling victim to his own ego and must face of with a band of criminals who aren't in it for the money. They see it as a game, and even make it into a video game. the Inspector starts off rather gung ho, and ends up struggling just to survive and to keep his head above water. With a mysterious partner, he ends up finishing the job, but at a high cost. The action sequences are top notch and vertigo-inducint at times. But, with this film, the plot actually matters, this isn't just a mindless action flick (not that there is anything wrong with that). Jackie Chan seems to want to show off his acting chops in this one, and does a really great job. The action sequences never seem forced, and fits well within the over-the-top villians who are in it for the chaos. There are undertones of the ""like father, like son"" issue going on (on both sides of the coin) to show the influence parents have in the lives of their children. And all it takes is either one act of kindness or an act of viciousness to turn a child's life either around, or send it down the tubes. I really did like this movie. It seemed to have a lot of Western sensibilities mixed in with Hong Kong filmmaking techniques and I think that makes this movie more universal (even if it is dubbed). If you are a fan of cop dramas, action movies, martial arts, or Jackie Chan then this is a definite must have.",5,East Meets West in this gritty Hong Kong Police drama,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1847,"['Usually', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'have', 'substantial', 'amount', 'humor', 'usually', 'intermixed', 'action', 'sequences', 'always', 'been', 'draw', 'dangerous', 'stunt', 'seem', 'choreographed', 'flawless', 'outtakes', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'painful', 'reality', 'finished', 'work', 'usually', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'new', 'addition', 'Police', 'Story', 'saga', 'Jackie', 'broke', 'melange', 'eastern', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'movie', 'styles', 'Western', 'Styles', 'Jackie', 'inspector', 'up', 'falling', 'victim', 'own', 'ego', 'must', 'face', 'band', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'money', 'see', 'game', 'even', 'make', 'video', 'game', 'Inspector', 'rather', 'gung', 'ho', 'up', 'struggling', 'just', 'survive', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'mysterious', 'partner', 'up', 'finishing', 'job', 'high', 'cost', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'vertigo-inducint', 'times', 'film', 'plot', 'actually', 'matters', ""n't"", 'just', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'want', 'show', 'off', 'acting', 'chops', 'one', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'action', 'never', 'seem', 'forced', 'fits', 'well', 'over-the-top', 'villians', 'who', 'are', 'chaos', 'are', 'undertones', 'father', 'son', 'issue', 'going', 'sides', 'coin', 'show', 'influence', 'parents', 'have', 'lives', 'children', 'either', 'one', 'act', 'kindness', 'act', 'viciousness', 'turn', 'child', 'life', 'send', 'down', 'tubes', 'really', 'did', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'Western', 'sensibilities', 'mixed', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'universal', 'even', 'dubbed', 'are', 'fan', 'cop', 'dramas', 'action', 'movies', 'martial', 'arts', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'then', 'definite', 'must', 'have']",N/A
979400,A4ZQZP41D95JO,B000EWBKIK,Chad Varnadore,"[6, 8]","I've long been a fan of Jackie's films.  He breathed new life into the genre like no other with his humorous style of combat; and it's inspiring to still see him move like he does at his age.  The action in The New Police Story were just as fun as most of his lighter films; and the stunts were typically incredible, just as you expect from a Hong Kong production that isn't stiffled by Hollywood politics and/or insurance.  And despite the more dramatic seriousness of Police Story, with a little Drunken Master mixed in, I found myself laughing much more than I expected.  Aside from a few sequences that demand a little further explanation, The New Police Story was about as much fun as my favorite Chan films.  The only real disappointment of the Blu-ray was that Lionsgate didn't include a lossless track for the original language.  A lossless audio option is provided for the dub track; but only lossy audio is included in the original Chinese.  That said, since I had a guest that doesn't like reading her movies, I opted for the dubbed track when we watched it and was surprised at the fidelity.  The translation was word-for-word the same as the subtitles in the approx 5 minute portion of the film I compared the two.  And the harmonics sounded very natural and dynamic.  That Jackie did (most) of the voice dub for his character himself, further helped to make sitting through the dubbed track, not only bearable, but enjoyable.",3,Much Funner Than the Originals,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1439,"[""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Jackie', 'films', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'genre', 'other', 'humorous', 'style', 'combat', 'inspiring', 'still', 'see', 'move', 'age', 'action', 'New', 'Police', 'Story', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'most', 'lighter', 'films', 'stunts', 'were', 'typically', 'incredible', 'just', 'expect', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'production', ""n't"", 'stiffled', 'Hollywood', 'politics', 'and/or', 'insurance', 'more', 'dramatic', 'seriousness', 'Police', 'Story', 'little', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'mixed', 'found', 'laughing', 'much', 'more', 'expected', 'Aside', 'few', 'sequences', 'demand', 'little', 'further', 'explanation', 'New', 'Police', 'Story', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'favorite', 'Chan', 'films', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'Lionsgate', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'lossless', 'track', 'original', 'language', 'lossless', 'audio', 'option', 'provided', 'dub', 'track', 'only', 'lossy', 'audio', 'included', 'original', 'Chinese', 'said', 'had', 'guest', ""n't"", 'like', 'reading', 'movies', 'opted', 'dubbed', 'track', 'when', 'watched', 'was', 'surprised', 'fidelity', 'translation', 'was', 'word-for-word', 'same', 'subtitles', 'approx', '5', 'minute', 'portion', 'film', 'compared', 'two', 'harmonics', 'sounded', 'very', 'natural', 'dynamic', 'Jackie', 'did', 'most', 'voice', 'dub', 'character', 'further', 'helped', 'make', 'sitting', 'dubbed', 'track', 'not', 'only', 'bearable', 'enjoyable']",N/A
979401,A6J8D9V5S9MBE,B000EWBKIK,Curtis G,"[1, 1]","Chan Kwok-wing, the protagonist of ""New Police Story,"" is not (Kevin) Chan Ka-kui, hero ofJackie Chan's Police Story--or so they say. This Chan is older, wiser...and drunker. In short, he's a mess. He's even worse off than Martin Riggs inLethal Weapon: Our second glimpse of him prominently features several adult beverages. A couple of scenes later, he's facedown in an alley. How the mighty have fallen.Flash back one year: Chan is the hot dog cop stud, foiling grenade-wielding hostage takers and punching out shady businessmen in a scene that's a sort of Police Story Condensed. Shortly thereafter, Joe (Daniel Wu) and his gang of rich-kid criminals rob a bank and then...call the cops. Just when we start to wonder why the bad guys (and girl) want to stage a blatant open-air shootout in the street a laHeat, instead of escaping when they have the chance, we learn that they're some sort of thrillseekers club, competing among themselves to win the biggest share of the bank loot via a point system. Kill higher-value targets (like, say, cops), get more points and more money.Chan, cocky with previous success, declares on the TV news that he will apprehend the gang within three hours. Joe, however, has other plans, and when Chan's team ""infiltrates"" the gang's lair, the gang starts picking them off one by one. When Chan is unable to save them (indeed, Joe has cruelly engineered this foregone outcome), he spirals into depression and self-loathing, distancing himself from both the police force and his fianc&eacute;e, Ho Yee (Charlie Yeung), whose brother was one of the officers Chan lost. Just as Chan hits rock bottom, a young rookie cop (Nicholas Tse) appears to bring him back into the fold.In stark contrast to the raw quickie HK action movies of the mid-90s likeMan Wanted, for example, NPS is very slick. Beautifully lit and shot, NPS features some mostly excellent visual effects and dynamic cinematography. It's not all gritty back alleys and shuttered storefronts; it's shining chrome and glass and neon. HK has never looked better. Despite all the glitter, however, New Police Story is darker and more twisted than any other Police Story film...or any other Jackie Chan movie, for that matter. OK, so even if this isn't the same series, NPS still features numerous references to the original PS series, including a double-decker bus that crashes through a lot of glass.A solidly entertaining movie, NPS is, nevertheless, not without its annoying little foibles. For one, logic and physics go out the window--or should I say over the ledge?--immediately. The big action set piece in the beginning relies on that most implausible of movie gimmicks: the real-life video game scenario. Meaning that there are lots of intricate traps and setups that depend too much on people being exactly where they need to be. It's great in the movies, but it would never work in real life, because one misstep breaks the whole chain. Also, there's a little too much unnecessary wirework for my taste.Not surprisingly, with all the neon, chrome and hot English-speaking hipsters, NPS is more than a little reminiscent of Benny Chan's earlierGen-X Cops(Benny just loves the HK Convention Centre). As much as I enjoyed the fluffy goodness of GXC, however, in the case of NPS I think there's too much Benny and not enough Jackie.On the plus side, most of the gunfights are nicely restrained, and the police tactics are more realistic than usual. Perhaps my favorite part of the movie, besides Charlie Yeung's overbite, is a fantastic battle in Legoland between Jackie and Andy On, reminiscent of one of my all-time favorite JC fight scenes: the pachinko parlor fight in the mostly otherwise-forgettableThunderbolt. And there are some very funny bits that don't go over the top with the comedy. The ""ending"" was a little on the sappy side, but it still got to me, and the epilogue/flashback was even more resonant and touching.At last, Jackie shows some real range (and a new hairdo, sort of, thank god). He goes from confident and cocky to subdued, tired and weary--and, holy cow, he gets emotional (and I don't mean just angry). Not once, but multiple times. It's different, but different is good.The supporting players are well cast. Nicholas Tse is quite appealing here--not the lightweight he was in Gen-X Cops. At first I would have preferred Stephen Fung, but Tse won me over. (There is actually a cameo by Fung in the deleted scenes.) He even gets to play his role for some laughs, which was enjoyable.The irresistible Charlie Yeung's Ho Yee takes the place of Maggie Cheung's longsuffering May and brings some heart and humor to a role that could have been spectacularly unrewarding. On the other side of the female equation is Charlene Choi, who has obviously discovered the secret of eternal youth. How else to explain why she still appears to be 12 years old? For some gravitas, there's Yu Rong-guang doing his badass straight-arrow cop schtick. A Mandarin speaker, Yu has here been dubbed into Cantonese--but with a distractingly deep voice (I kept thinking of Sonny Chiba inThe Storm Riders).The standout performer here, hands down, is Daniel Wu. He was merely serviceable in GXC, and I didn't dig him inPurple Storm, but after seeing him in NPS, I have a new respect for him as (and I don't use this term lightly) an actor. As the quietly sinister tortured son-slash-criminal mastermind, Wu digs deep and puts it out there. Excellent job, sir.I wouldn't bet that this will be the last of the Police Story movies, New or otherwise, but if it is, it serves as a fitting bookend. In any case, it's certainly not the last major HK outing we'll see from Jackie Chan. That I'd bet on. Hey, if Robert Redford is still making action-type movies at his advanced age, Jackie can certainly be making them well into his hundreds. And I almost hope he does.",5,It's about time Jackie got serious again.,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,5859,"['Chan', 'Kwok-wing', 'protagonist', 'New', 'Police', 'Story', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Chan',

I have seen almost all of his films, where are the morals here? Where are the life lessons. This movie left Me in a dark mood. Crime Story shows that Jackie can play a straight role, but why make a Chinese version of a Steven Segal movie. Hope he never tries this type of thing again. This has nothing to do with the other Police Stories, and should not be marketed this way.

Jackie Chan is getting a little long in the tooth for this sort of thing, especially when pitted against all these kids, like the baddies and his new partner. But he can still put it out. Some of the stunts maybe aren't so ""wow!""-inducing as in the past, but the triple-slide down the building ranks right up there with the best (even if they cheat with cables that get digitally erased!).This is a far cry from JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE, the first Chan movie I ever saw...and miles above some of his recent American films, especially TUXEDO (although I did quite enjoy AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS). Not only is his acting surprisingly good, especially considering the language thing and the dubbing, but his supporting cast deserves equal credit, notably Nicholas Tse as his badgering partner.My only complaint is that it takes a bit too long to get moving. We get the picture right off: He's a drunk because of guilt over allowing his team to get slaughtered due to his pride and bravado. Fine. And we know he's going to snap out of it. But I think the director had him wallowing in his self-pity a bit too long.Also, I was somewhat put off by the editing, with various shots of action sequences overlapping.

But, that is not a bad thing. Here, we get to see Jackie expand his acting to the point of him being driven to tears as a malicious group of kids execute his team members one by one in front of him during a botched raid.A New Police Story has Chan playing the disgraced inspector who must come back from alcoholism to bring justice for his fallen comrades. Enter a young man who mysteriously wants to help the fallen officer out. Of course, you don't know why until the end, but suffice it to say, he is the comedic relief at times and until the end, you have to wonder why he's there. What are his motives? Is he good or bad?The unfortunate thing with this movie is some of it has been digitally enhanced to remove wires, but I can understand why. Unlike the first Police Story (which this has no connection with the previous characters), safety regulations are probably tougher now than they were when the first Police Story was shot. Plus, the budget is bigger and they can rehearse stunts. Of course, with Jackie Chan pushing 50, it's going to be tougher for him to recover from serious injuries. But, this doesn't detract from the action that occurs and believe me, there is some great stunt work in this movie.The fight scenes are fast and furious, but don't expect there to be a lot. This is a story that hinges more on Jackie's character redeeming himself, both with the police force as well as his fianc&eacute;e that never stopped loving or believing in him, even when the inspector himself felt he was a disgrace. Many might not like it, but for me, it was refreshing to see the focus more on Jackie's acting and his character rather than the actual fighting.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, possibly even more than the first Police Story. It's more polished and Jackie's acting is superb. There is still the funny humor in it and the use of props during the fights, especially the Lego fight and how can you not forget the skyscraper escape down the side of the building?

There's drama (Jackie's character can't stop blaming himself for the deaths of some of his co-workers), suspense (will bombs that have been triggered go off?), character development (we actually get to see what motivates the main characters, especially Jackie's and Daniel Wu's!), gunplay (lots of excitement during armed robberies), kung fu (Jackie shows no signs of slowing down!), and amazing stunt action (buses, cars, rollerblades, bicycles, and very tall buildings!).  Even Daniel Wu turns in a GREAT performance!  I've always hated this guy's performances in the past because his acting has always been weak, but this movie has completely changed my mind.

While the story won't win any awards, it's a fun movie to sit down and spend a couple hours watching. The story has Jackie facing off against a group of teen troublemakers riding bikes, rollerblades and just running in places that would make most people scared just to stand still in - it all leads to some fun action scenes with everyone. Besides Jackie, it was nice to see Charlene Choi (of ""Twins"" and a number of movies) and Nicholas Tse.The budget was pretty high on this one - I was impressed with all of the destruction going on throughout it. I've heard mixed reviews on the blu-ray, but decided to make the upgrade (I have the original release from when it was just coming out overseas) - the video quality was a definite step up from that already good looking disc (more than I expected for a budget title) - it won't win any awards but it's clear you're watching a Blu-Ray. Audio quality was good, not great. I'd say a step up from the DVD, but not a big reason to upgrade (the picture quality upgrade is much more noticeable). Extras, unfortunately, were sort of lacking. They run about 30 minutes combined and are presented in 480p - the overseas DVD release had quite a few more features, so it looks like Lionsgate might not have been able to acquire them and instead decided to make some ""new"" ones of their own (a dubbing session, commentary on 2 scenes and a 15 minute behind the scenes feature).While it's not quite as cool as some of the no-wires stunts you see Tony Jaa doing, it's definitely enjoyable. Not quite  up to the original Police Story classics, but not too far behind. Overall worth checking out, especially considering the title can be found very cheap. Recommended!",4,JC still has it!

979423,APIW11UEPKIC2,B000EWBKIK,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 2]","Wow did this one catch me by surprise.  I thought for sure I was getting another goofy Jackie movie.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!The movie starts out with Jackie as a drunken cop.  After showing him in some disgusting drunken moments, we get to see why he became like this.  There is a group of kids going around terrorizing the police.  They will do a standard bank job or something like that and then wait for the cops.  Having serious firepower, skills that will relate to the x games later in the movie, and already being rich, the cops certainly have theri hands full.  So the cops have serious problems and they finally get Jackie in a deadly game of 'can you do this to keep your fellow officers alive'?  Needless to say he doesn't and becomes a drunk.When the band of x-games teens are causing trouble again a young cop tries to get Jackie to help out.  I know you have probably heard this type fo a cop story before but this movie is seriously one of the best looking movies I have seen in a while.  All of the locations and buidings they are in are great to look at.  If you have seen Jackie Chan's Who am I?, Rumble in the Bronx, or even the well done First Strike, then get ready for a change.  New Police Story has very high production values and it is not cheesy.  Might not be what you are used to in a Jackie movie, but it was a very nice change to see this.The movie gets between a 3.5 and a 4 but could have gotten a 5.  Rongguang Yu(the Iron Monkey) is in this movie and him and Jackie do not fight.  That dissapointed me just a bit, but they still had some really good scenes together.The special features are pretty good with behind the scenes, behind the dubbing of Jackie doing his voiceover and a commentary for 2 scenes.  Also the picture is widscreened but the picture quality needs to be commented on. It seemed like I was watching a high definition TV.  Very nice!",4,"Very good dark Jackie movie.

There are stunts, but of course they are more toned down especially because of Chan's age (although he's still amazing). My biggest gripe is that the slap stick comedy is gone, replaced with a more dramatic tone like the police dramas you watch on the Chinese tv channels.

979433,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000EWBKIK,Tsuyoshi,"[21, 24]","After the disappointing `Around the World in 80 Days,' Jackie Chan went back to his roots in Hong Kong film industry. What is amazing is that Jackie (who is over 50 years old) can still do the death-defying stunts, as is seen in this film. The fact that his best films are made in 1980s cannot be denied, but `New Police Story' delivers its goods with Jackie and some of the new faces from Hong Kong.The story is given a new touch in `New Police Story.' This time Jackie plays a veteran Hong Kong police officer Wing, whose overconfidence leads to a botched raid. Feeling guilt deeply, Inspector Wing, now disgraced, is given to drink until a young `police detective' named Fung appears before him. With a help from Fung, Wing again begins to hunt the culprits responsible for the deaths of his men.[NEW BREED OF VILLAINS] As in his `The Myth,' Jackie's answer to the recent boom of wuxia (Chinese period martial arts films), in `New Police Story' Jackie Chan clearly intends to do something different. The baddies of the new film are a bunch of masked young gangsters, who can rob and kill as if it is a video game. As a fan of Jackie's actions, I can swear that this is very unusual choice. For in many cases the villains of his films may have been assassins or gangsters, but they never acted like spoiled kids. It is certain that deaths are sometimes depicted, but not in this violent way. Violent, in this case I mean, for Jackie's film. The decision of director Benny Chan (`Who Am I?') would divide the viewers' opinions, but it is certain that he and Jackie are trying to seek a new direction.[ACTIONS] But you want to know the actions. Good news is that Jackie is still alert and agile, and can move like when he was in his first `Rush Hour.' Considering the fact that he is now over fifty, this is just incredible. There are two outstanding scenes here; one is Jackie climbing down the vertical wall of a tall building in a very unique (and dangerous) way, followed by Jackie hanging on the roof of a runaway bus in the street of Hong Kong. The other is in a Lego showroom, where he shows a bone-crunching fighting against one of the baddie.[ACTING] This may not interest you, but Jackie does another new thing, and that is acting. Well, of course he must have been doing that for long, I know, but what I mean is he takes more time to reveal the complex nature of the character he plays, to show his ability as actor. There is even a love interest for his character.[SUPPORTS] Some of Jackie film fans seem not to remember the names of the supports, or you just don't care. For `New Police Story' Jackie assembled great cast. Nicholas Tse as mysterious Fung is a standout among them, and so is Daniel Wu as the leader of the gangs. Among the fighting scenes, Andy On shines who was wasted in deplorable `Black Mask 2.' As to the female players, after the 8 years' retirement Charlie Yeung comes back as love of Jackie's inspector, giving the rather generic story a human touch, and very busy (and very cute) Charlene Choine from the popular duo Twins also appears.`New Police Story' may not be the right place if you are going to see Jackie Chan films for the first time. It is overlong, sometime unnecessarily serious and violent, and Jackie's stunts, thrilling as they are, are not his best. Having said that, I must say it is a welcome addition to the works of one and only Jackie Chan, far better than any recent English-speaking films of his.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Welcome Back to Hong Kong, Jackie!
