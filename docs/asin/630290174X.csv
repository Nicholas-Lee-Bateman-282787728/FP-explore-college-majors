There is only one other such film in the Morse collection, and it too is a stinker.  The plot in this case is highly complex and implausible. That's okay, but the female script writer should not have been quite so blatant with her propaganda.  In short, this film is not worthy of the otherwise first class Morse series.",2,Having an agenda,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,396,"['agenda', 'film', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'feminism', 'anti-clericalism', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'such', 'film', 'Morse', 'collection', 'too', 'stinker', 'plot', 'case', 'highly', 'complex', 'implausible', 'okay', 'female', 'script', 'writer', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'so', 'blatant', 'propaganda', 'short', 'film', 'not', 'worthy', 'otherwise', 'first', 'class', 'Morse', 'series']",N/A
344613,A319KYEIAZ3SON,630290174X,Mary Whipple,"[6, 8]","Though I'm not sure the humor is intended, this is one of the more absurd--and ultimately humorous--episodes in the Inspector Morse series.  Though the series is always well acted, especially by John Thaw and Kevin Whately, and the photography and music are always gorgeous, the plot is such a jumble here, with so many weird scenes, that it is difficult to take the episode seriously, even when it involves accusations of murder within a church setting.Several competing--and incompatible--plot lines play out here.  Victoria Hazlett, a young female deacon hoping to become a priest in the Church of England, collapses and dies during the special exam she is taking.  She is part of Pax, a group of liberated female clerics who have become active at Oxford.  Hilary Dobson, another member of the group, is applying to become chaplain of St. Saviour's Church, competing for the position against a young man who has the backing of the conservative wing of the church, a group of neurasthenic priests much in evidence at Oxford and in this episode.  Inserted between the church scenes is a beauty pageant for Think Thin weight loss program participants, with the bathing suit-clad candidates vying for weight-loss queen of the year.  The primary connection between these two unlikely subjects seems to be Dinah Newberry, a former weight loss queen, who solos at the church.During the episode:  A priest with serious mental problems glares menacingly throughout the beginning scenes, orating about witchcraft and harlotry.  Several priests are caught in a ""Harlot's Room"" at the vicarage, a room filled, floor to ceiling, with kinky, adulterated photos of the local female clergy. All Victoria Hazlett's ecclesiastical research is stolen and burned by the weight-loss impresario, and Dinah Newberry, hysterical, is seen smearing her face and clothes as she gobbles a paste of flour and water, one of the most grotesque scenes in the entire Morse series.  Several attempts at murder occur, and Morse, not surprisingly, flirts with one of the female clerics.One of the weaker episodes, plot-wise, Fat Chance is enjoyable for its off-the-wall absurdity.  I suspect that even Morse and Lewis were smirking into their beer and orange juice, off-camera. n  Mary Whipple",3,"Unintentional black humor, verging on noir.",1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,2260,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'humor', 'intended', 'one', 'more', 'absurd', 'ultimately', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'series', 'always', 'well', 'acted', 'especially', 'John', 'Thaw', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'photography', 'music', 'are', 'always', 'gorgeous', 'plot', 'such', 'jumble', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'weird', 'scenes', 'difficult', 'take', 'episode', 'seriously', 'even', 'when', 'accusations', 'murder', 'church', 'setting.Several', 'competing', 'incompatible', 'plot', 'lines', 'play', 'out', 'here', 'Victoria', 'Hazlett', 'young', 'female', 'deacon', 'hoping', 'become', 'priest', 'Church', 'England', 'collapses', 'dies', 'special', 'exam', 'taking', 'part', 'Pax', 'group', 'liberated', 'female', 'clerics', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'active', 'Oxford', 'Hilary', 'Dobson', 'member', 'group', 'applying', 'become', 'chaplain', 'St.', 'Saviour', 'Church', 'competing', 'position', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'backing', 'conservative', 'wing', 'church', 'group', 'neurasthenic', 'priests', 'much', 'evidence', 'Oxford', 'episode', 'Inserted', 'church', 'scenes', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'Think', 'Thin', 'weight', 'loss', 'program', 'participants', 'bathing', 'suit-clad', 'candidates', 'vying', 'weight-loss', 'queen', 'year', 'primary', 'connection', 'two', 'unlikely', 'subjects', 'be', 'Dinah', 'Newberry', 'former', 'weight', 'loss', 'queen', 'who', 'solos', 'church.During', 'episode', 'priest', 'serious', 'mental', 'problems', 'menacingly', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'orating', 'witchcraft', 'harlotry', 'Several', 'priests', 'are', 'caught', 'Harlot', 'Room', 'vicarage', 'room', 'filled', 'floor', 'ceiling', 'kinky', 'adulterated', 'photos', 'local', 'female', 'clergy', 'Victoria', 'Hazlett', 'ecclesiastical', 'research', 'stolen', 'burned', 'weight-loss', 'impresario', 'Dinah', 'Newberry', 'hysterical', 'seen', 'smearing', 'face', 'clothes', 'paste', 'flour', 'water', 'one', 'most', 'grotesque', 'scenes', 'entire', 'Morse', 'series', 'Several', 'attempts', 'murder', 'occur', 'Morse', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'flirts', 'one', 'female', 'clerics.One', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'plot-wise', 'Fat', 'Chance', 'enjoyable', 'off-the-wall', 'absurdity', 'suspect', 'even', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'were', 'smirking', 'beer', 'orange', 'juice', 'off-camera', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",N/A
344614,AV33XOKKT2PH1,630290174X,Pamela Williams,"[10, 13]","I have viewed and own numerous DVD entries in the Inspector Morse series.  This particular mystery is not especially appealing, in that it revolves around a somewhat implausible combination of university/religious politics, eating disorders, and a weight loss organization which goes to extreme lengths to protect its reputation and profitability.  Ultimately, even the death which represents the subject of the investigation turns out to be unconnected to blatant criminal activity.  Compared to other entries in the series, FAT CHANCE is one of the less interesting stories.M.

Thor,"[3, 3]","A priest goes bad, a ""Fat Chance"" girl goes missing, communion wine may have been poisoned, another girl is thrown from her bicycle - and the bike goes missing; the same girl collapses during an exam; Morse becomes involved with yet another woman. all these events provides sufficient material for a good Morse episode.  But with all these happenings the plot really doesn't go anywhere - we as viewers go many places during the unfolding of the story, but our interest is not peaked.  The personalities alone help our entry to three stars but, alas, the story just doesn't develop beyond the basics.  Of the 33 episodes I have given three stars to only four, which says a lot about the quality of this series, unfortunately this one just does not make the grade.",3,Regarding this plot:  Think Thin,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,763,"['priest', 'bad', 'Fat', 'Chance', 'girl', 'missing', 'communion', 'wine', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'poisoned', 'girl', 'thrown', 'bicycle', 'bike', 'missing', 'same', 'girl', 'collapses', 'exam', 'Morse', 'involved', 'yet', 'woman', 'events', 'sufficient', 'material', 'good', 'Morse', 'episode', 'happenings', 'plot', 'really', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'viewers', 'go', 'many', 'places', 'unfolding', 'story', 'interest', 'not', 'peaked', 'personalities', 'alone', 'help', 'entry', 'three', 'stars', 'alas', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'develop', 'basics', '33', 'episodes', 'have', 'given', 'three', 'stars', 'only', 'four', 'lot', 'quality', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'make', 'grade']",N/A
344616,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,630290174X,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I love the Inspector Morse series, especially for John Thaw's amazing performance as the intellectual Chief Inspector and Kevin Whately as his long-suffering DS Lewis. Having just discovered this series several weeks ago, I've been working my way through them, but this is one of the weakest and least appealing in the series thus far.The plot is ludicruous here - on the one hand, there's a suspicious death of a female deacon destined for great things (she dies in the midst of sitting an important examination). Morse and Lewis soon discover an undercurrent of Oxford politics between the clerics who approve of change in the form of a female chaplain (would be a first for one of the colleges), and those who are vehemently against it. This plot arc also sees Morse getting attracted to a female cleric, Emma.The second story arc is what jumbles the plot - there's a young woman under the care of Emma who appears to know something about the death and has gone missing. She is shown throughout the story, running around, grabbing people, and shouting like a crazy woman. These outbursts are tenuously linked to a pharmaceutical company manufacturing slimming pills. At this point, I no longer cared what happened to these secondary characters, and the only reason I watched it till the end was because of Morse. Even the romance bit did not seem altogether credible, and frankly Morse appeared bored throughout the story. I'd give this a miss as there are other, highly superior Morse episodes than this drivel.",3,Not one of the better Morse episodes,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1515,"['love', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'especially', 'John', 'Thaw', 'amazing', 'performance', 'intellectual', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'long-suffering', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'Having', 'just', 'discovered', 'series', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'way', 'one', 'weakest', 'least', 'appealing', 'series', 'thus', 'far.The', 'plot', 'ludicruous', 'here', 'one', 'hand', 'suspicious', 'death', 'female', 'deacon', 'destined', 'great', 'things', 'midst', 'sitting', 'important', 'examination', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'soon', 'discover', 'undercurrent', 'Oxford', 'politics', 'clerics', 'who', 'approve', 'change', 'form', 'female', 'chaplain', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'colleges', 'who', 'are', 'vehemently', 'plot', 'arc', 'also', 'Morse', 'getting', 'attracted', 'female', 'cleric', 'Emma.The', 'second', 'story', 'arc', 'what', 'plot', 'young', 'woman', 'care', 'Emma', 'who', 'know', 'something', 'death', 'gone', 'missing', 'shown', 'story', 'running', 'around', 'grabbing', 'people', 'shouting', 'crazy', 'woman', 'outbursts', 'are', 'tenuously', 'linked', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'manufacturing', 'slimming', 'pills', 'point', 'no', 'longer', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'secondary', 'characters', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'end', 'was', 'Morse', 'Even', 'romance', 'bit', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'altogether', 'credible', 'frankly', 'Morse', 'appeared', 'bored', 'story', ""'d"", 'give', 'miss', 'are', 'other', 'highly', 'superior', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'drivel']",N/A
