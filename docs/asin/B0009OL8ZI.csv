All the chachators are good and my favorite is one that unfortunateally didn't that long and that was Arthurs sister Stephanie. Ironicly when I first saw theese they showed them at school in the auditorium and at the time I thought they were movies. It wasn't until later that I found out it was a tv show and I remember to this day being shocked to hear that it was. Unfortunatelly after I stopped going to that school I didn't see this show again until I got this a few years ago and its still good.

909605,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B0009OL8ZI,Genevieve Hayes,"[4, 4]","The marvellous thing about ""Degrassi"" is that it is a teen series in which teenagers actually act like teenagers and are actually played by teenagers, not actors who are fast approaching 30. Sure, the scripts are corny and the actors aren't always photogenic, but that's what real life is like, right?This box set contains the three seasons of ""Degrassi Jr High"" (which were immediately followed byDegrassi High - The Complete Collection). The show deals with a number of major issues including sex, pregnancy, anorexia and the other standard issues that you have come to expect in teen-oriented material, but it also deals with a number of minor issues that are probably easier for most teenagers to identify with: exams, school dances, rock and roll and part time jobs. It is, infact, the storylines involving these minor issues that I found to be the more enjoyable.""Degrassi"" was a landmark TV series when it was first aired and is still enjoyable to watch, even if its sometimes in a so-bad-its-funny kind of way.",5,A teen show in which teenagers actually act like teenagers,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1018,"['marvellous', 'thing', 'Degrassi', 'teen', 'series', 'teenagers', 'actually', 'act', 'teenagers', 'are', 'actually', 'played', 'teenagers', 'not', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'fast', 'approaching', '30', 'Sure', 'scripts', 'are', 'corny', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'photogenic', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'right', 'box', 'set', 'three', 'seasons', 'Degrassi', 'Jr', 'High', 'were', 'immediately', 'followed', 'byDegrassi', 'High', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'show', 'number', 'major', 'issues', 'including', 'sex', 'pregnancy', 'anorexia', 'other', 'standard', 'issues', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'teen-oriented', 'material', 'also', 'number', 'minor', 'issues', 'are', 'probably', 'easier', 'most', 'teenagers', 'identify', 'exams', 'school', 'dances', 'rock', 'roll', 'part', 'time', 'jobs', 'infact', 'storylines', 'involving', 'minor', 'issues', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Degrassi', 'was', 'landmark', 'TV', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'even', 'sometimes', 'so-bad-its-funny', 'kind', 'way']",Degrassi Junior High - The Complete Collection
909606,A308QC9XPFHFGJ,B0009OL8ZI,"Malfoyfan ""Cath""","[0, 0]","Amateur acting, horrible clothes, occasionally clunky dialogue and preachy subject matter: so why do I love Degrassi Junior High so much?  I just received this DVD set as a gift, after having wanted it for many years.  I remember watching this show on public TV back in the day, and in spite of the things I said at the beginning of this paragraph, the characters are so endearing and the depiction of life in junior high is so true that it's easy to overlook the parts that don't quite work.The young actors who portray the students were all close in age to the characters they played, and they clearly weren't culled from modeling agencies.  Most are very ordinary-looking, some are overweight, many have glasses and/or braces and some need braces.  They look and sound like real kids, and there's a sweetness and a sincerity about them that makes even the most annoying (yes, I'm talking about Joey) of them appealing.Some of the actors playing the parents aren't very good, but they're not in the show that much, so it's not much of an issue.  The teachers Miss Avery and Mr. Raditch aren't bad.The subject matter covers the expected range for junior high age kids: cheating for grades, trying to make friends, budding sexuality, dating, bullies, dealing with parents' issues.  I found it interesting that 12-year-olds in this show are interested in dating and sex - I wasn't quite that advanced when I was 12, but I'm sure others were.  In any case, it's always fun to see how the issues are resolved.I highly recommend this show if you've never seen it.  The messages conveyed through the episodes are still relevant.Note: the video transfer process on this program isn't very good.  It tends to make everyone look sort of squished.  You get used to it.  I've noticed this is a problem on a lot of programs from the 70s and 80s.",5,Why do I love this show so much??,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1834,"['Amateur', 'acting', 'horrible', 'clothes', 'occasionally', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'preachy', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'love', 'Degrassi', 'Junior', 'High', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'received', 'DVD', 'set', 'gift', 'having', 'wanted', 'many', 'years', 'remember', 'watching', 'show', 'public', 'TV', 'back', 'day', 'spite', 'things', 'said', 'beginning', 'paragraph', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'endearing', 'depiction', 'life', 'junior', 'high', 'so', 'true', 'easy', 'overlook', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.The', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'students', 'were', 'close', 'age', 'characters', 'played', 'clearly', 'were', ""n't"", 'culled', 'modeling', 'agencies', 'Most', 'are', 'very', 'ordinary-looking', 'are', 'overweight', 'many', 'have', 'glasses', 'and/or', 'braces', 'need', 'braces', 'look', 'sound', 'real', 'kids', 'sweetness', 'sincerity', 'even', 'most', 'annoying', 'yes', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Joey', 'appealing.Some', 'actors', 'playing', 'parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', ""'re"", 'not', 'show', 'much', 'not', 'much', 'issue', 'teachers', 'Miss', 'Avery', 'Mr.', 'Raditch', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'expected', 'range', 'junior', 'high', 'age', 'kids', 'cheating', 'grades', 'trying', 'make', 'friends', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'dating', 'bullies', 'dealing', 'parents', 'issues', 'found', 'interesting', '12-year-olds', 'show', 'are', 'interested', 'dating', 'sex', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'advanced', 'when', 'was', '12', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'were', 'case', 'always', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'issues', 'are', 'resolved.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'messages', 'conveyed', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'relevant.Note', 'video', 'transfer', 'process', 'program', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'make', 'everyone', 'look', 'sort', 'squished', 'get', 'used', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'problem', 'lot', 'programs', '70s', '80s']",Degrassi Junior High - The Complete Collection

But my boyfriend, whom prior to this DVD being released would go on and on about how much he loved the show, exposed me to this show. At first I laughed and said ""Why do you like this cheesy kid stuff?"". Honestly, alot of the acting and settings are hoakey...but then there's honest human drama that we can all relate to, and you get the sensation of peeking into a real school.The show was very grass rootsy and you can tell by the quality. But I believe that is what adds to the charm and why so many people relate to it. This show was a trailblazer and I'm happy that Canada produced this gem.
