817317,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001Z3HU4,Grady Harp,"[36, 40]","LOVE LETTTERS has been on making the boards of theaters large and small across the United States (and translated into many languages and performances throughout the world!) since A.R. Gurney first wrote it in 1989.  It is still a popular theater piece for actors from film who want to have public exposure on the stage, for benefits, for young actors in training. Why?  Because it is an unassuming, interesting easy to perform in reading fashion by just two actors on a small stage, ultimately fine exploration of the variations love has in the periods of each of our lives. It is unpredictable, clever, well written and very meaningfully tender.In this teleplay, revised for television screens in 1999 by A.R. Gurney, Stanley Donen directs this fleshed-out performing version with a cast that would be difficult to better.  Simply stated, this is a epistolary love story that begins when Andy meets Melissa in second grade and progresses through their very different lives (art school, Yale, Vietnam, alcoholism, divorces, politics, affairs, etc) until Melissa ultimately dies (we know this from the opening scene so this is NO spoiler!).The technique of mixing actual interaction between the two characters with remembered responses works very well.  Part of the reason this small play becomes important is the extraordinary performance by Laura Linney as Melissa. The breadth of her characterization is richly detailed, subtle, vulnerable, and wholly credible.  Steven Weber as Andy takes a while to warm to his character (the more difficult of the two with whom to identify) but in the end he gives his best work to date.This is really a fine little movie, interrupted only by the obvious splices of time where commercials were probably inserted in the original television version. It flows naturally and never ceases to hold your attention and your heart as it is lovingly enacted by Linney and Weber.

The correspondence between two lifelong friends, Melissa and Andy, was trite and ultimately boring beyond words.  This 1999 Canadian television production could not have paired together two more unsuited actors in Laura Linney, a superior actress with the lifeless and untalented Steven Weber.  Weber's performance was so stultifying that any hint of chemistry between the two was lost.  After seeing this done live on stage in 1998 as a reading, this teleplay adapted by the playwright A.B.Gurney himself had all of the stage emotion and life choked from it with Weber's numbing performance and Lee Holdridge's sappy 1970-esque musical scoring.  The stage play was average, but the teleplay is dreadful.",1,OMG are you serious?

817319,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B0001Z3HU4,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[7, 8]","As presented on stage, A.R. Gurney's popular play features an actor and actress seated at a table, reading a series of letters that describe their lifelong relationship.  In fact, during the height of its popularity back in the early 1990s, Los Angeles audiences were treated to an ever-changing cast of stars, each pair staying with the production for a week or so, then relinquishing the stage to another duo.For this 1999 television adaptation under the direction of Stanley Donen, Gurney opens up his play somewhat.  True, most of it takes place in one room, with the two principals speaking the contents of their letters to each other, but this approach, surprisingly, works very well.Steven Weber plays a U.S. Senator who has just attended the funeral of his friend, Laura Linney.  Alone in his office, he begins to read the letters that they wrote to each other over the years, and Linney's spirit appears to deliver her half of the communications, thus the scenes play as a dialogue.The two characters had met in grade school where they immediately fell in love.  However, the fact that Linney was a rebellious, free-spirited girl, while Weber was more serious and down-to-earth, kept them from consummating their romance, except for a brief affair.  Both married others, yet each was the great love of the other's life.The actors are terrific in one of the most moving films I've ever seen.  I can't recommend this one too highly. Michael B.

The acting was great and it was a very sentimental love story of two people who met in 2nd grade and had the connection of being soul mates but never fully developed their love for each other, but it was a love story with unspoken words of confirmation till the end.It was through these letters to each other throughout their lives, that they kept in touch from wherever life took them.  I am a very sentimental person in reality and so I appreciated this movie very much.....Would I say that it is more of a chick film? .... I guess that it is, unless you happen to be married or in a relationship to a new age man who also loves and honest real  love stories......and I can honestly say that if my late husband was still alive, he too would have loved this movie, as he was into writing letters for almost any excuse.  He could say more on a page than speak about it as it had a lasting quality about his emotions.I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story line with no sexual scenes or bad language to (enhance) the feelings between  these two people who genuinely loved each other, but it was always the wrong time for them to be together.......please buy it and you will not be  disappointed unless you are a cold hearted person, then I would say to you &#34;keep away&#34;.

817321,A2UYGOYMV73826,B0001Z3HU4,Rushmore,"[0, 0]","This is a very tough setup - basically a 2-character play in which the characters who are in the same room together recite several decades of their correspondence.  It's a very theatrical conceit and probably works better on the stage.  A movie gives you all kinds of advantages - you can have different actors play the characters at different ages (assuming the stage play uses the same two actors throughout); you can be more elaborate with your set and costume changes; when they are clearly in another time and place the characters can talk to each other in real time which should look and sound different from reading letters to each other.  However, these are the very reasons I expect a play like this to be more realistic, and in that regard this production of Love Letters is a failure for me.In real life people do not change their clothes, make-up and hairstyles in an instant and without any indication that time has passed.  When Laura Linney as Melissa wears one look for one spoken line, and a completely different look for the next line, even though they have not moved from the room where most of the action takes place, that just makes me want to laugh, or at least grimace.  Steven Weber fares better in this regard because he doesn't change much from the uptight lawyer/politician.  His is a fairly one-dimensional performance.  Laura Linney has a more vibrant character and benefits from more hair styles and a variety of costumes, but I have to say neither actor has the goods to transport this sometimes stilted script into gut-wrenching territory.  (If Steven Weber's Andy said the word ""constituency"" one more time, I might have turned the movie off.)In the 20+ years since the play was written, it's quite possible that the public's tastes have evolved.  In the opening scene where Andrew's aides pick him up at the airport as he is returning from Melissa's funeral, he says he wants to go home and the aide reminds him of his schedule for the rest of the day.  To me that is just trite shorthand for the pressures of a politician's responsibilities as they crash up against real life.  I would like to think a more contemporary screenplay would handle this conflict with more finesse.  In a similar vein, as Andy and Melissa's relationship progresses and causes issues about public perception of Andy as a political figure, Melissa does not act like someone a normal man would want to be with.  Spoiler alert if you have not seen this movie:  she makes it easy for him to walk away.  Like maybe he wishes he could run.The ending is touching, and the premise is interesting.  The script has its problems and the acting is just OK.  Linney is better than Weber, but neither successfully sells the concept.  This is a high-minded movie that doesn't quite rise to the challenge.",3,They didn't quite pull it off,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,2801,"['very', 'tough', 'setup', 'basically', '2-character', 'play', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'room', 'together', 'recite', 'several', 'decades', 'correspondence', 'very', 'theatrical', 'conceit', 'probably', 'better', 'stage', 'movie', 'kinds', 'advantages', 'can', 'have', 'different', 'actors', 'play', 'characters', 'different', 'ages', 'assuming', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'two', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'elaborate', 'set', 'costume', 'changes', 'when', 'are', 'clearly', 'time', 'place', 'characters', 'can', 'talk', 'other', 'real', 'time', 'should', 'look', 'sound', 'different', 'reading', 'letters', 'other', 'However', 'are', 'very', 'reasons', 'expect', 'play', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'regard', 'production', 'Love', 'Letters', 'failure', 'me.In', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'clothes', 'make-up', 'hairstyles', 'instant', 'indication', 'time', 'passed', 'When', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Melissa', 'one', 'look', 'one', 'spoken', 'line', 'completely', 'different', 'look', 'next', 'line', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'moved', 'room', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'just', 'want', 'laugh', 'least', 'grimace', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'better', 'regard', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'uptight', 'lawyer/politician', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'performance', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'more', 'vibrant', 'character', 'benefits', 'more', 'hair', 'styles', 'variety', 'costumes', 'have', 'say', 'actor', 'goods', 'transport', 'sometimes', 'stilted', 'script', 'gut-wrenching', 'territory', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Andy', 'said', 'word', 'constituency', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'movie', '20+', 'years', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'quite', 'possible', 'public', 'tastes', 'have', 'evolved', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Andrew', 'aides', 'pick', 'up', 'airport', 'returning', 'Melissa', 'funeral', 'go', 'home', 'aide', 'schedule', 'rest', 'day', 'just', 'trite', 'shorthand', 'pressures', 'politician', 'responsibilities', 'crash', 'up', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'more', 'contemporary', 'screenplay', 'would', 'handle', 'conflict', 'more', 'finesse', 'similar', 'vein', 'Andy', 'Melissa', 'relationship', 'issues', 'public', 'perception', 'Andy', 'political', 'figure', 'Melissa', 'not', 'act', 'someone', 'normal', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'easy', 'walk', 'away', 'maybe', 'could', 'run.The', 'ending', 'touching', 'premise', 'interesting', 'script', 'problems', 'acting', 'just', 'OK.', 'Linney', 'better', 'Weber', 'successfully', 'concept', 'high-minded', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rise', 'challenge']",Love Letters
