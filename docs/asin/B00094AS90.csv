901324,A38WJYEMGT0DTA,B00094AS90,Joanna,"[2, 2]","This film is a sublimely gentle presentation of a lesser known Hardy novel, and like allmost all Hardy novels it is deeply tragic and subtle. There are no simplistic villians or strong heroes here only deeply flawed souls trying and often failing in their various endevours...A loving father sends his daughter off to receive a better education than the rural 'Wessex' countryside can offer her. The father's shame over his own ignorance drives him to push her - creating a young lady neither at home in the city or the countryside, not really accepted by ""society"" or by the earthy woodsmen and farmers of her village. Her father - once happy to see her married to a gentle woodsman (Rufus Sewell) now decides that she would be 'wasted' in such a match and encourages the newly arrived village Doctor to court her. But the Doctor resents the cloying countryside world and has little but contempt for her friends or her family. Her ex fiance seems unable to resolve himself to their ended relationship. Both he and the young lady are manipulated by others into more and more untennable situations, until the inevitable doom at the heart of all Hardy novels - a stupid and pointless death - crushes the options for the central characters.While this version of the film lacks the depth of the book, stunning performances by Polly Walker and Rufus Sewell make this well worth the effort. Although the end of this film seemed more ""modern"" that my memories of the novel, I do recommend this highly!It's quiet,almost annoyingly slow pacing, and its highly predictable situations - unhappy affairs - unrequited loves - severe ilness - tragic miscommunications - in no way distract from the charm of the production.If you are looking for action, adventure, or full frontal nudity this is NOT the film for you - but if you desire deep and terrible beauty, bittersweet,fine and moving performances - stop in these woods and enjoy.",5,"Lovely and bittersweet as the apples in ""Woodlanders""",1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,1921,"['film', 'sublimely', 'gentle', 'presentation', 'lesser', 'known', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'allmost', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'deeply', 'tragic', 'subtle', 'are', 'simplistic', 'villians', 'strong', 'heroes', 'here', 'only', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'souls', 'trying', 'often', 'failing', 'various', 'endevours', 'loving', 'father', 'daughter', 'receive', 'better', 'education', 'rural', ""'Wessex"", 'countryside', 'can', 'offer', 'father', 'shame', 'own', 'ignorance', 'push', 'creating', 'young', 'lady', 'home', 'city', 'countryside', 'not', 'really', 'accepted', 'society', 'earthy', 'woodsmen', 'farmers', 'village', 'father', 'once', 'happy', 'see', 'married', 'gentle', 'woodsman', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'now', 'would', 'be', ""'wasted"", 'match', 'newly', 'arrived', 'village', 'Doctor', 'court', 'Doctor', 'cloying', 'countryside', 'world', 'little', 'contempt', 'friends', 'family', 'ex', 'fiance', 'unable', 'resolve', 'ended', 'relationship', 'young', 'lady', 'are', 'manipulated', 'others', 'more', 'more', 'untennable', 'situations', 'inevitable', 'doom', 'heart', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'death', 'options', 'central', 'characters.While', 'version', 'film', 'depth', 'book', 'stunning', 'performances', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'make', 'well', 'effort', 'end', 'film', 'seemed', 'more', 'modern', 'memories', 'novel', 'do', 'recommend', 'highly', 'quiet', 'almost', 'annoyingly', 'slow', 'pacing', 'highly', 'predictable', 'situations', 'unhappy', 'affairs', 'unrequited', 'loves', 'severe', 'ilness', 'tragic', 'miscommunications', 'way', 'distract', 'charm', 'production.If', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'adventure', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'NOT', 'film', 'desire', 'deep', 'terrible', 'beauty', 'bittersweet', 'fine', 'moving', 'performances', 'stop', 'woods', 'enjoy']",The Woodlanders

Characters, backstories and nuances that are Hardy trademarks are given short shrift in both versions. Not to worry, however. Newcomers to ""The Woodlanders"" will like this re-edited film, reduced and refocused as it is, because it is so well cast, acted, directed and photographed in beautiful locations. The film confirms that Hardy is as superb a storyteller as he is a social commentator.A timber merchant sends his daughter (Emily Woof) off to school but welcomes home less a country lass than an educated woman who is now ill at ease among her kith and kin, including the young woodcutter (Rufus Sewell) she promised to marry. Instead, she marries a class-conscious doctor (Cal Macaninch) on the insistence of her father, who seeks to improve her station. Everyone is at cross-purposes in Hardy stories (he rarely writes villains) and they always come to grief.
