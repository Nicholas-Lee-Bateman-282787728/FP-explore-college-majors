796156,A1E9SNNS24DA02,B0001906OA,"Amazon Customer ""chickenlittle25""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this video. The choreography is fun and looks pretty when being performed.  It's hard to find a beginner choreography that's interesting and I found this one to be really good.  It's not a choreography that you're going to learn in a day (unless you're going to play it for hours), but it's definitely learnable for any level of dancer.Jillina's instruction is pretty well done.  First she shows you the basic moves that you're going to need.  Absolute beginners (anyone who has never had a class) may want to go over this section several times before trying the combinations.  I like that you can see her from the back as well as in the mirror.  To me it felt more like being in an actual class and it's a million times better than videos where the instructor stands in front of you and says ""go right"" and then moves to HER right but YOUR left.  With this video when the instructor says to ""step left"", you're moving the same way that she is. I also think it's very helpful to see the instructor from the front as well as the back.  For the most part the camera is where it is supposed to be so you can see what you're supposed to be doing.  The choreo instruction is well done, you perform the section you're learning, then start from the beginning and go into the dance.  As you get to the section you've just learned she gives verbal directions in case you've forgotten anything.On the downside, I don't care much for the ""combo/choreo"" set up.  First she teaches you a set of combinations, so you learn how to do those, but when you get to the choreography part she'll tell you to do ""Combination one"" but change X to Y.  Why not just teach sections of the dance as they're going to be performed rather than have me learn things one way and then change them out on me?  Frankly I didn't like having to retrain myself to memorize a different pattern of steps after I just went to the trouble to learn the original ones.  After the first 2 sessions with this dvd I simply skipped the combo section and concentrated on the choreography. The other downside is that the warmup section isn't long enough (which she admits in the video), I thought that was really bad form.  This is a beginner's video, why on Earth would the producers expect beginners to guess at how to properly warm up?  This section should have been done properly instead of just rushed through.At the end is a stage performance by Jillina that has several dances, including a modified version of the one you've just learned.  While I can't say that she's the best dancer I've ever seen, I truly I enjoyed her performance, especially the drum solo.",4,One of my favorites,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,2635,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'choreography', 'fun', 'pretty', 'when', 'being', 'performed', 'hard', 'find', 'beginner', 'choreography', 'interesting', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'choreography', ""'re"", 'going', 'learn', 'day', ""'re"", 'going', 'play', 'hours', 'definitely', 'learnable', 'level', 'dancer.Jillina', 'instruction', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'First', 'basic', 'moves', ""'re"", 'going', 'need', 'Absolute', 'beginners', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'class', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'over', 'section', 'several', 'times', 'trying', 'combinations', 'like', 'can', 'see', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'mirror', 'felt', 'more', 'being', 'actual', 'class', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'videos', 'where', 'instructor', 'front', 'go', 'right', 'then', 'moves', 'HER', 'right', 'YOUR', 'left', 'video', 'when', 'instructor', 'step', 'left', ""'re"", 'moving', 'same', 'way', 'also', 'think', 'very', 'helpful', 'see', 'instructor', 'front', 'as', 'well', 'back', 'most', 'part', 'camera', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'choreo', 'instruction', 'well', 'done', 'perform', 'section', ""'re"", 'learning', 'then', 'start', 'beginning', 'go', 'dance', 'get', 'section', ""'ve"", 'just', 'learned', 'verbal', 'directions', 'case', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'downside', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'combo/choreo', 'set', 'up', 'First', 'set', 'combinations', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'when', 'get', 'choreography', 'part', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'do', 'Combination', 'one', 'change', 'X', 'Y', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'teach', 'sections', 'dance', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'performed', 'rather', 'have', 'learn', 'things', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'change', 'out', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'having', 'retrain', 'memorize', 'different', 'pattern', 'steps', 'just', 'went', 'trouble', 'learn', 'original', 'ones', 'first', '2', 'sessions', 'dvd', 'simply', 'skipped', 'combo', 'section', 'concentrated', 'choreography', 'other', 'downside', 'warmup', 'section', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'video', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'form', 'beginner', 'video', 'why', 'Earth', 'would', 'producers', 'expect', 'beginners', 'guess', 'how', 'properly', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'properly', 'instead', 'just', 'rushed', 'through.At', 'end', 'stage', 'performance', 'Jillina', 'several', 'dances', 'including', 'modified', 'version', 'one', ""'ve"", 'just', 'learned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'best', 'dancer', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'especially', 'drum', 'solo']",Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 1
796157,A1WXV2M71VH7TH,B0001906OA,A woman,"[7, 9]","The title is terribly misleading. A better title would be ""Jillina's combinations"".With respect to the break-down of bellydance moves, Jillina offers only a very fast-paced review. There is no drilling whatsoever. If this is your first bellydance instruction, you'll feel like a student who happened to miss the entire course and now is attending a review session before the exam. Jillina's explanations are rushed, and not always clear.I think the best instructional (and practice) video is ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"". Or, if you need a very, very gentle introduction to bellydance, get ""Amira's bellydance 101"". I also recommend ""Bellydance for Romance"" for inspiration. Even ""Discover bellydance"" series with all their flaws are a million times better then Jillina's DVD.Most of the time Jillina dedicates to assembling moves into dance combos. And that disproportionately large part I found to be even worse than her instruction:1. I prefer to combine the moves by myself. It wasn't nice of Jillina to use this DVD to show off her choreography instead of teaching the technique.2. Each sequence she first demonstrates without music. This makes it a chore. (The other programs that I mentioned above never stop the music while teaching their short routines, which makes them much more fun to learn.)3. Whenever the music is back, there is another disappointment: Jillina constantly shouts out the names of the movements or - even worse - counts. (Instructors on the DVD's that I mentioned above never yell at you).4. I don't find Jillina's choreography interesting.Moreover, I was surprised they didn't hire a professional to shoot this video. The camera is shaking; most of the time Jillina is shot from a wrong angle, far away, and poorly lit. Though by itself the idea of using a mirror was great, it was not successfully realized, since her reflection is hard to see due to the distance and dim light.And I didn't like Jillina's personality at all.

796158,A2VV4JWNKCQHF0,B0001906OA,Basbenee,"[5, 6]","I've got a lot of tapes and DVDs for bellydance instruction, soI had to try this one, too. At first I was reluctant to plop down more coin on another DVD when I wasn't sure I would like it, but this one is exactly what I had wanted to find for a long, long time.I've had lessons before, just community enrichement classes that left me sorely disappointed, and Jillina tops that experience by a long shot and everything I've run into prior to this DVD (and volumes 2 and 3 are just as good too).She starts out with some stretching, then breaks down the moves, runs through technique and has you repeat some steps and combos a few times to get them down. This one has seven 'breakdowns' and you repeat each part a number of times, eventually to music.Then she runs through choreography, adding a bit more layering and flair to the steps you learned. And as you go along you realize you're doing the dance she has at the end (where she performs in costume, though that one is a bit different, modified, so she says, for the stage, but you can see her doing the moves she just taught you).I love that in the instruction and choreography she shows the moves in front of a mirror, so you see her from the front and back, and she's very clear about how to move, which way to step (step left and turn to your right, etc). It's not terribly complicated but not so easy either that you'll get bored fast. I'm having a lot of fun with this DVD and I love volumes two and three (which grow in complexity) and only wish there were more Jillinas teaching out in the dance/DVD world.Some people love this DVD and others hate it, and I can understand both points of view, but I like the progression of showing individual moves (hip circles, omis, camels, etc) and building of the moves while in front of the mirror, and I love that she doesn't just dive into something without explanation. To me she comes across as a great teacher, and it's fun to work on the moves and feel it coming together more and more. I only wish other instructional DVDs would break down moves and weave together a dance. The only other one I've run into with this is the bellytwins' introduction to bellydance series, and Jillina (for me) gives a more satisfying chance to dance and with better music.",5,Worth every penny,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,2262,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'lot', 'tapes', 'DVDs', 'bellydance', 'instruction', 'soI', 'had', 'try', 'one', 'too', 'first', 'was', 'reluctant', 'plop', 'down', 'more', 'coin', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'one', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'wanted', 'find', 'long', 'long', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lessons', 'just', 'community', 'enrichement', 'classes', 'left', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Jillina', 'tops', 'experience', 'long', 'shot', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'run', 'prior', 'DVD', '2', '3', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'too', '.She', 'out', 'stretching', 'then', 'down', 'moves', 'technique', 'repeat', 'steps', 'combos', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'down', 'one', 'seven', ""'breakdowns"", 'repeat', 'part', 'number', 'times', 'eventually', 'music.Then', 'choreography', 'adding', 'bit', 'more', 'layering', 'flair', 'steps', 'learned', 'go', 'realize', ""'re"", 'doing', 'dance', 'end', 'where', 'costume', 'one', 'bit', 'different', 'modified', 'stage', 'can', 'see', 'doing', 'moves', 'just', 'taught', '.I', 'love', 'instruction', 'choreography', 'moves', 'front', 'mirror', 'see', 'front', 'back', 'very', 'clear', 'how', 'move', 'way', 'step', 'step', 'left', 'turn', 'right', 'etc', 'not', 'terribly', 'complicated', 'not', 'so', 'easy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'bored', 'fast', ""'m"", 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'DVD', 'love', 'volumes', 'two', 'three', 'grow', 'complexity', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'Jillinas', 'teaching', 'out', 'dance/DVD', 'world.Some', 'people', 'love', 'DVD', 'others', 'hate', 'can', 'understand', 'points', 'view', 'like', 'progression', 'showing', 'individual', 'moves', 'hip', 'circles', 'omis', 'camels', 'etc', 'building', 'moves', 'front', 'mirror', 'love', ""n't"", 'just', 'dive', 'something', 'explanation', 'across', 'great', 'teacher', 'fun', 'work', 'moves', 'feel', 'coming', 'together', 'more', 'more', 'only', 'wish', 'other', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'would', 'break', 'down', 'moves', 'weave', 'together', 'dance', 'only', 'other', 'one', ""'ve"", 'run', 'bellytwins', 'introduction', 'bellydance', 'series', 'Jillina', 'more', 'satisfying', 'chance', 'dance', 'better', 'music']",Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 1

The combinations are not easy, however, and they may be very challenging for an absolute beginner.The thing that makes this my absolute favorite is that Jillina demonstrates the combinations with her back turned to the camera so that you can mimick her actions exactly, without having to think about whether that's her right or left leg she's moving.  The camera shows a full-body shot of her and never zooms in for dramatic close-ups during the combinations, so you always know exactly what her other foot is doing, etc.  The performance parts include lots of interesting camera angles, but the instructional segments don't and I like that.

I don't think the video is horrible nor is her instruction, but I think dancing videos are just not for me.  I am young and coordinated, but catching dance moves without a teacher there to correct your move is seeming to be more and more of a bad idea if you aren't one who gets dance moves easily.  I felt like some of the moves could hurt you because you may pull something.  I chose not to finish it.  The warm up in the beginning felt great.  The stretches felt so good to me.  Usually warm ups suck but this one didn't.  If you are pretty good at belly dancing this one won't be so bad, but if not it may be hard for you to pick it up.  When it comes to exercise videos I am seeing that I need to stick with more traditional types and forget the ""fun"" dancing ones.  I didn't do so well with the dancing with the stars ones either but thank the Lord they were from the library.  I am more of a Denise Austin and Tamilee Webb gal.

796168,A4PI4DZJSVF6Q,B0001906OA,Miss B,"[69, 73]","Update 12/19/2011:  Someone commented on my review to say that nowhere does this DVD say it is for Beginners.  The commenter is correct.  It doesn't say ""beginner"" anywhere on the DVD... ANYMORE.  This DVD has been renamed since I wrote my review (in 2005!!) to reflect more accurately what you are getting.  I do, however, stand by my original statement that there is not enough detailed instruction on this DVD.  Lots of people have only DVDs to learn from...even calling it ""Level 1"" suggests something lower level than what you are actually getting.  Get a different DVD if you are a beginner and just starting out.  Once you lay down some groundwork, then get this for the very lovely piece of choreography Jillina teaches.Original Review:The title of this DVD is shockingly misleading.  This is NOT for the beginner!!  One of the most important things in bellydancing is that you keep the correct posture at all times so that you do not injure your lower back and Jillina doesn't really mention that and it's THE FIRST thing you'll learn in a class.  Please don't make the mistake of buying this as an instructional video if you are just starting out.  All Jillina is doing on this DVD is teaching you some nice looking choreography without any in depth explanations how to. There is NOT enough instruction or drilling.  I love Jillina, she's a beautiful dancer...so don't get me wrong on that score.  This is simply not good instruction for a beginner.  At all.  If you are looking for instruction similar to a class, go on the net and find Halyma or Amira (Amira is sometimes available on Amazon).  Trust me on this.  I've only been able to afford a few classes so far and DVDs are my main source of instruction at the moment.  I am a complete beginner.  I will use this DVD later on for fun and to get a feel for how to put moves together, but save your money for something else if you are looking for pure instruction.",3,Beginners beware,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,1928,"['Update', '12/19/2011', 'Someone', 'commented', 'review', 'say', 'nowhere', 'DVD', 'say', 'Beginners', 'commenter', 'correct', ""n't"", 'say', 'beginner', 'anywhere', 'DVD', 'ANYMORE', 'DVD', 'been', 'renamed', 'wrote', 'review', '2005', 'reflect', 'more', 'accurately', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'do', 'however', 'stand', 'original', 'statement', 'not', 'enough', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'DVD', 'Lots', 'people', 'have', 'only', 'DVDs', 'learn', 'even', 'calling', 'Level', '1', 'something', 'lower', 'level', 'what', 'are', 'actually', 'getting', 'Get', 'different', 'DVD', 'are', 'beginner', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'Once', 'lay', 'down', 'groundwork', 'then', 'get', 'very', 'lovely', 'piece', 'choreography', 'Jillina', 'teaches.Original', 'Review', 'title', 'DVD', 'shockingly', 'misleading', 'NOT', 'beginner', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'bellydancing', 'keep', 'correct', 'posture', 'times', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'injure', 'lower', 'back', 'Jillina', ""n't"", 'really', 'mention', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'class', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'buying', 'instructional', 'video', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'Jillina', 'doing', 'DVD', 'teaching', 'nice', 'looking', 'choreography', 'depth', 'explanations', 'how', 'NOT', 'enough', 'instruction', 'drilling', 'love', 'Jillina', 'beautiful', 'dancer', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'score', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'instruction', 'beginner', 'are', 'looking', 'instruction', 'similar', 'class', 'go', 'net', 'find', 'Halyma', 'Amira', 'Amira', 'sometimes', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Trust', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'able', 'afford', 'few', 'classes', 'so', 'far', 'DVDs', 'are', 'main', 'source', 'instruction', 'moment', 'am', 'complete', 'beginner', 'will', 'use', 'DVD', 'later', 'fun', 'get', 'feel', 'how', 'put', 'moves', 'together', 'save', 'money', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'looking', 'pure', 'instruction']",Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 1

I ordered Discover Bellydance-- It turned out to be a better series.  I still don't like bellydance.. but Neena and Veena (cheesy.. yes) were much more graceful and easy on the eyes.  Not to mention-- their instruction was way better-- I wasn't looking at their backside (as I was with Jilliana) during the majority of learning how to do things.Maybe I'm just into the bright colors and art of seduction through dance.

Because of this, I tried doing the hip isolations while keeping my legs absolutely straight, which felt really awkward.However, after watching her closer, I saw what she was doing and had a couple of ""OH! I get it now!"" moments.Also, I felt she could have gone a bit slower with the combinations (since it IS supposed to be a beginner's DVD) and repeated the instructions a couple more times.All in all though, I'm glad I bought this DVD.

I have been bellydancing for two years and have taken classes with a variety of live instructors, seen bellydancing live a number of times, danced in student shows, and done several of the videos on the market (Neena and Veena, Rania, etc).  Jillina's instructional video is terrific, although I'm not sure how easy it would be for beginners.  For a road-warrior who needs to take her dance practice into a hotel room, it's been great.Jillina's workout is separated into several parts.  There is a technique section, where you really practice individual moves.  I found this section almost as good as a classroom teaching environment.  Then, you learn combinations.  The combinations are drilled in, both without and with the music.  The combinations are creative, challenging, and yet repeated enough that even I could learn them.Finally, the combinations with variations are taught in a complete choreography.  Jillina has a great sense of musicality, as the rhythms and trills of the music are perfectly matched by the moves.  This really made the choreography sink in and ""make sense"" to me.  I also enjoyed putting together a full dance piece.Jillina also includes a video of her performing this choreography for a live audience.  It was so beautiful, it took my breath away.  Yet, as you watch it, you also recognize the very same moves that you learned in her video.
