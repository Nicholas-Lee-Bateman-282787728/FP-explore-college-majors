759507,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B00009XN5R,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[8, 9]","What you will find on this DVD is nearly 60 minutes of pure entertainment!  Complete performances by some of the great Broadway and theater performers of the 1950's and 60's.  With the exception of one, these are FULL performances without editing or voice-over.  If you've ever watched a tribute show where you get to see a 15-second blip of a classic performance, then you need to add this DVD to your collection.My only flaw (hence 4 stars, not 5) is that the first number with Ethel Merman is incomplete; although it is listed on the back cover of the DVD, it is NOT listed on the inside &quot;Chapter Index&quot;, nor is it included on the DVD Scene Index.  Chapter 1 is simply titled &quot;Introduction&quot; and includes a portion of the performance.  Again the only flaw.The overall quality is very good, keeping in mind there was no Dolby Surround Sound 30 plus years ago!  The DVD extras are just filler, nothing substantial, some text to read about each show.  By all means, this DVD is worth the money, and if people support this type of programming, I imaine the companies will produce more - a second volume is indicated in the credits.",4,Outstanding Performances - Well Done,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,1149,"['What', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'nearly', '60', 'minutes', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Complete', 'performances', 'great', 'Broadway', 'theater', 'performers', '1950', '60', 'exception', 'one', 'are', 'FULL', 'performances', 'editing', 'voice-over', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'tribute', 'show', 'where', 'get', 'see', '15-second', 'blip', 'classic', 'performance', 'then', 'need', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection.My', 'only', 'flaw', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'first', 'number', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'incomplete', 'listed', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'listed', 'inside', 'quot', 'Chapter', 'Index', 'quot', 'included', 'DVD', 'Scene', 'Index', 'Chapter', '1', 'simply', 'titled', 'quot', 'Introduction', 'quot', 'portion', 'performance', 'Again', 'only', 'flaw.The', 'overall', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'keeping', 'mind', 'was', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'Sound', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'just', 'filler', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'text', 'read', 'show', 'means', 'DVD', 'money', 'people', 'support', 'type', 'programming', 'imaine', 'companies', 'will', 'produce', 'more', 'second', 'volume', 'indicated', 'credits']",N/A

759509,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00009XN5R,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","""The Best of Broadway Musicals, Original Cast Performances from the Ed Sullivan Show"" is a treasure. Ed was a Great White Way columnist who became very popular when he hosted his Sunday night television performance show. On his show were comedians, vaudeville acts, the hottest new musicians like the Beatles and Elvis, and best of all his presentation of now rare scenes from the then current Broadway hits. Were it not for his show many of these scenes would have been lost forever. It starts with Ethel Merman belting out ""There's No Business like Show Business.""There's a 1955 video of Richard Rodgers conducting an orchestra and chorus for a sung number from ""Oklahoma"". There are performances by Carol Channing, John Raitt, Anthony Newley, Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Gwen Verdon, Richard Kiley, and Pearl Bailey. The early years are in black and white with color showing up in 1966 episodes; the quality is very good. Watching Richard Burton from ""Camelot"" whistling and doing a high-stepping dance is a treat.These are not just snippets but full performances with sets and costumes. There are brief interviews with Lerner and Loewe and Rodgers and Hammerstein. This is a must-see for people who love the American musical.",5,"Scenes from Great Broadway Shows, Almost Gone",1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,1232,"['Best', 'Broadway', 'Musicals', 'Original', 'Cast', 'Performances', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'treasure', 'Ed', 'was', 'Great', 'White', 'Way', 'columnist', 'who', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'when', 'hosted', 'Sunday', 'night', 'television', 'performance', 'show', 'show', 'were', 'comedians', 'vaudeville', 'acts', 'hottest', 'new', 'musicians', 'Beatles', 'Elvis', 'best', 'presentation', 'now', 'rare', 'scenes', 'then', 'current', 'Broadway', 'hits', 'Were', 'not', 'show', 'many', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'forever', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'belting', 'out', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', '1955', 'video', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'conducting', 'orchestra', 'chorus', 'sung', 'number', 'Oklahoma', 'are', 'performances', 'Carol', 'Channing', 'John', 'Raitt', 'Anthony', 'Newley', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'Pearl', 'Bailey', 'early', 'years', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'showing', 'up', '1966', 'episodes', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'Watching', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Camelot', 'whistling', 'doing', 'high-stepping', 'dance', 'treat.These', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'snippets', 'full', 'performances', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'brief', 'interviews', 'Lerner', 'Loewe', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'must-see', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'American', 'musical']",N/A
759510,A3BU6QT97HMF,B00009XN5R,Joseph Hart,"[0, 0]","I grew up in a backwater town in California, so all I knew of Bway musicals came from OBC albums which I reveled in (until 1970 when I moved to NYC and saw some Bway shows and was bored out of my mind by them).  Since my childhood, Bway has been replaced in my affections by Bach.  But this DVD is a treasure, pure gold, a sheer delight.  It is a rare and miraculous chance to go back 50 years and see these people do what they did the way they did it then.  I loved it almost completely and have ordered a copy of the DVD (the one I watched was rented).  A few quibbles.  Merman only sang a few lines of &quot;No Business,&quot; but that was okay with me because I've seen and heard lots of her and am tired of both her voice and that song (though she did have the ear to go to her grave baffled by the success of Stephen Sondheim).  Pearl Bailey's number was I thought both colorless and flat, as was that dreadful choreography which for some reason followed a knock-out dance by Bob Fosse, which I thought was one of the highlights of the disc.  Channing also was kind of dull, her number abbreviated, and the gimmick she did with the audience just a bit too.  Finally the touted interviews with the two sets of songwriters amounted to no more than a minute apiece, I don't recall Lowe saying anything at all, and I know Rodgers wasn't even in it.  But.  Rodgers himself conducted his own &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and then smiled and shook hands with John Raitt which was wonderful.  Enough quibbles.  Everything else else shone like a newly minted coin.  Newley sang his own &quot;Who Can I Turn To?&quot; and (like all the others) it was a jolt and a pleasure to see HOW he sang it, gestures, facial expressions.  (Incidentally, that song, commonly thought to be a love song, is actually a prayer, Cocky is singing to god, which explains some of Newley's gestures.)  Everyone has his favorites on this disc I'm sure, I loved pretty much all of it.  I couldn't get over the fact that I was actually looking into the past and seeing these performers as they were then, doing what made them &quot;great.&quot;  Also, it was only about 53 minutes long, so I didn't have time to get too bored, it was a treasure I will cherish and no doubt watch again, now back to Bach.",5,A treasure,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,2267,"['grew', 'up', 'backwater', 'town', 'California', 'knew', 'Bway', 'musicals', 'came', 'OBC', 'albums', 'reveled', '1970', 'when', 'moved', 'NYC', 'saw', 'Bway', 'shows', 'was', 'bored', 'mind', 'childhood', 'Bway', 'been', 'replaced', 'affections', 'Bach', 'DVD', 'treasure', 'pure', 'gold', 'sheer', 'delight', 'rare', 'miraculous', 'chance', 'go', 'back', '50', 'years', 'see', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'way', 'did', 'then', 'loved', 'almost', 'completely', 'have', 'ordered', 'copy', 'DVD', 'one', 'watched', 'was', 'rented', 'few', 'quibbles', 'Merman', 'only', 'sang', 'few', 'lines', 'quot', 'No', 'Business', 'quot', 'was', 'okay', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'lots', 'am', 'tired', 'voice', 'song', 'did', 'have', 'ear', 'go', 'grave', 'baffled', 'success', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Pearl', 'Bailey', 'number', 'was', 'thought', 'colorless', 'flat', 'was', 'dreadful', 'choreography', 'reason', 'followed', 'knock-out', 'dance', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'disc', 'Channing', 'also', 'was', 'kind', 'dull', 'number', 'abbreviated', 'gimmick', 'did', 'audience', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'Finally', 'touted', 'interviews', 'two', 'sets', 'songwriters', 'amounted', 'more', 'minute', 'apiece', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Lowe', 'saying', 'anything', 'know', 'Rodgers', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Rodgers', 'conducted', 'own', 'quot', 'Oklahoma', 'quot', 'then', 'smiled', 'shook', 'hands', 'John', 'Raitt', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Enough', 'quibbles', 'Everything', 'else', 'else', 'shone', 'newly', 'minted', 'coin', 'Newley', 'sang', 'own', 'quot', 'Who', 'Can', 'Turn', 'quot', 'others', 'was', 'jolt', 'pleasure', 'see', 'HOW', 'sang', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Incidentally', 'song', 'commonly', 'thought', 'be', 'love', 'song', 'actually', 'prayer', 'Cocky', 'singing', 'god', 'Newley', 'gestures', 'Everyone', 'favorites', 'disc', ""'m"", 'sure', 'loved', 'pretty', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'was', 'actually', 'looking', 'past', 'seeing', 'performers', 'were', 'then', 'doing', 'what', 'made', 'quot', 'quot', 'Also', 'was', 'only', 'about', '53', 'minutes', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'get', 'too', 'bored', 'was', 'treasure', 'will', 'cherish', 'doubt', 'watch', 'again', 'now', 'back', 'Bach']",N/A
