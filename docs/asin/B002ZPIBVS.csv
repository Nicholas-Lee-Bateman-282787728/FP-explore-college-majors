It was almost typical of what hollywood does when they either don't have the facts as to the events they are using as a basis for the movie, or they prefer to change it according to their belief system. Believe me, the bible account is quite exciting enough. I am particularly fond of this account for oh so many reasons. I noticed that this was popular, and without really paying attention to the product notes, I got sucked into looking at it. I would only recommend others see this movie to compare with another to see the difference. The problem is, when you see the other (as there are a number of these movies out there), you really don't want to revisit this one again.",2,One Night with the King,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,709,"['did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'almost', 'typical', 'what', 'hollywood', 'when', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'facts', 'events', 'are', 'using', 'basis', 'movie', 'prefer', 'change', 'according', 'belief', 'system', 'Believe', 'bible', 'account', 'quite', 'exciting', 'enough', 'am', 'particularly', 'fond', 'account', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'noticed', 'was', 'popular', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'product', 'notes', 'got', 'sucked', 'looking', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'others', 'see', 'movie', 'compare', 'see', 'difference', 'problem', 'when', 'see', 'other', 'are', 'number', 'movies', 'there', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'revisit', 'one', 'again']",N/A

1314461,AF5GJBN763Z7P,B002ZPIBVS,Plain Servant,"[6, 7]","I have to disagree with reviews that say this film is Biblically  correct, it is not. It does give the same general idea, but there are things added and things missing that would have helped the story. Hollywood has a hard time with Biblical stories because TRUTH is not in their vocabulary, so they do not understand why the audience does not like a story that THEY made better. This movie is closer then most. I like to have my grandchildren watch the movie and then play a game of who can find the most mistakes. That way, they get to watch the movie and they learn the truth at the same time. It also instills in them to question what they are told and read the word for themselves.",4,Good film for the family,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,686,"['have', 'disagree', 'reviews', 'say', 'film', 'Biblically', 'correct', 'not', 'give', 'same', 'general', 'idea', 'are', 'things', 'added', 'things', 'missing', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'hard', 'time', 'Biblical', 'stories', 'TRUTH', 'not', 'vocabulary', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'audience', 'not', 'like', 'story', 'THEY', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'closer', 'then', 'most', 'like', 'have', 'grandchildren', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'play', 'game', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'most', 'mistakes', 'way', 'get', 'watch', 'movie', 'learn', 'truth', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'question', 'what', 'are', 'told', 'read', 'word']",N/A
