1074614,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000Q7ZLQK,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","SLOW BURN is a film that has much to like, much promise, and a cast of trusty actors to bring it off.  The problem with the result is in director/writer Wayne Beach's hands and especially in the editing job on the completed film. It is like watching a 'follow-the-bouncing-ball' film: there are many surprises and subplots and altered identities that keeping a score card of where the story is going is a bit difficult.Reduced to the bare bones the plot takes place in a 24 hour period during which District Attorney Ford Cole (Ray Liotta) and his Assistant DA Nora (Jolene Blalock) are in a showdown with a significant crime boss Luther Pinks (LL Cool J).  Nothing is as it seems, as irritating flashbacks attempt to prove, and in the end the good guys and the bad guys are difficult to appreciate.  There are some excellent performances by reliable actors such as Taye Diggs, Mekhi Phifer, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and  Bruce McGill, but the plot depends on a significant point of the confused racial identity of Jolene Blalock's character, and though she acts well, the part would have been better served by an actress like Nicole Ari Parker, to name just one.The problem with this supposedly enigmatic thriller is that the astute viewer will see through the plot far too early.  But given the quibbles, it is good to see these actors at work, especially the underused Ray Liotta.

1074615,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000Q7ZLQK,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[10, 11]","Filmed in 2003 but kept on the shelf until now, ""Slow Burn"" is a so-so film noir that includes plenty of bewildering twists. Screenwriter-director Wayne Beach directorial debut keeps things moving at a steady pace while managing to generate a reasonable amount of suspense every now and then. The story focuses on committed District Attorney Ford Cole (Ray Liotta), whose potential mayoral career is on the line after his assistant D.A. and lover Nora Timmer (Jolene Blalock) becomes involved in the murder of Isaac Duperde (Mekhi Phifer), a local CD vendor who she claims attempted to rape her. The case, however, grows more mysterious with the sudden appearance of Luther Pinks (LL Cool J), a close friend of the victim who assures Cole that Isaac and Nora were in fact lovers, and that she persuaded him to reveal the whereabouts of an elusive criminal gang lord. With time running out, it is now up to Cole to uncover the truth if he wants to save his career.After watching this I personally thought Beach overloads his plot (from a story by himself and Anthony Walton) with successive twists that are too confusing to follow, thus destroying the credibility of his characters. The mystery elements of the story never really gel, and its much more confusing than it has to be. This is especially true considering the fact that the end of the movie is pretty much given away in the middle of the film, and I was sitting there waiting for my guess to pan out... which it did. They did, however, switch it up on me a few times with some red herrings here and there. It's still fun to watch, but some tighter writing would have put the film over the top.The best parts of the movie are the concepts and philosophies dealing with race that are present in the film. The most intriguing of these is the concept of ""passing,"" a situation where someone can pass as a member of another race, perhaps even two. As far as I know, this concept has only been played with in comedic films that make fun of the idea rather than explore the impact it can have on people's everyday lives where race is such a big factor. The ideas presented in the film are subtle, realistic, and never in your face. Those not interested in racial issues can skip over the ideas without a second thought, but they would never really get the full impact of the movie as much of the cultural aspects of the film are not told explicitly, but are implied, relying on the viewer's own concepts of race and culture.The popularity of the ensemble cast is probably what kept ""Slow Burn"" from going straight to video, even though none of the film's big-name actors -- except Ray Liotta -- live up to their reputation. As usual, Liotta imbues his character with the right amount of charisma and strength, but he fails to receive the necessary support from the inadequate LL Cool J and Mekhi Phifer. Also in the cast is the excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor, but his character is too underdeveloped to make any sort of impact. ""Slow Burn,"" is just a plain old crime thriller and may not be a total waste of time or money, but it is in-arguably a slight disappointment -- mostly because of its sub par screenplay. If you view it as a relative cultural issues playing major parts in the events of people's lives, its amazing. Somewhere in the middle, you will find the true nature of Slow Burn.",3,"[3.5]--""All you need  is love, sex, pain, and the rain.""",1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,3343,"['Filmed', '2003', 'kept', 'shelf', 'now', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'so-so', 'film', 'noir', 'plenty', 'bewildering', 'twists', 'Screenwriter-director', 'Wayne', 'Beach', 'directorial', 'debut', 'things', 'moving', 'steady', 'pace', 'managing', 'generate', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'suspense', 'now', 'then', 'story', 'committed', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Ford', 'Cole', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'potential', 'mayoral', 'career', 'line', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'lover', 'Nora', 'Timmer', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'involved', 'murder', 'Isaac', 'Duperde', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'local', 'CD', 'vendor', 'who', 'attempted', 'rape', 'case', 'however', 'more', 'mysterious', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'Luther', 'Pinks', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'close', 'friend', 'victim', 'who', 'Cole', 'Isaac', 'Nora', 'were', 'fact', 'lovers', 'persuaded', 'reveal', 'whereabouts', 'elusive', 'criminal', 'gang', 'lord', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'now', 'up', 'Cole', 'uncover', 'truth', 'save', 'career.After', 'watching', 'personally', 'thought', 'Beach', 'plot', 'story', 'Anthony', 'Walton', 'successive', 'twists', 'are', 'too', 'confusing', 'follow', 'thus', 'destroying', 'credibility', 'characters', 'mystery', 'elements', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'gel', 'much', 'more', 'confusing', 'be', 'especially', 'true', 'considering', 'fact', 'end', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'away', 'middle', 'film', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', 'waiting', 'guess', 'pan', 'out', 'did', 'did', 'however', 'switch', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'red', 'herrings', 'here', 'there', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'tighter', 'writing', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'film', 'top.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'concepts', 'philosophies', 'dealing', 'race', 'are', 'present', 'film', 'most', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'passing', 'situation', 'where', 'someone', 'can', 'pass', 'member', 'race', 'perhaps', 'even', 'two', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'concept', 'only', 'been', 'played', 'comedic', 'films', 'make', 'fun', 'idea', 'rather', 'explore', 'impact', 'can', 'have', 'people', 'everyday', 'where', 'race', 'big', 'factor', 'ideas', 'presented', 'film', 'are', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'never', 'face', 'not', 'interested', 'racial', 'issues', 'can', 'skip', 'ideas', 'second', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'movie', 'much', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'explicitly', 'are', 'implied', 'relying', 'viewer', 'own', 'concepts', 'race', 'culture.The', 'popularity', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'probably', 'what', 'kept', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'going', 'straight', 'video', 'even', 'none', 'film', 'big-name', 'actors', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'live', 'up', 'reputation', 'usual', 'Liotta', 'character', 'right', 'amount', 'charisma', 'strength', 'receive', 'necessary', 'support', 'inadequate', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Also', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'character', 'too', 'underdeveloped', 'make', 'sort', 'impact', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'crime', 'thriller', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'in-arguably', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'mostly', 'sub', 'par', 'screenplay', 'view', 'relative', 'cultural', 'issues', 'playing', 'major', 'parts', 'events', 'people', 'lives', 'amazing', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'will', 'find', 'true', 'nature', 'Slow', 'Burn']",Slow Burn 2007

How does it enhance the verisimilitude of the tale if most of our information has to come filtered down to us through a secondhand source, a person who wasn't even present at the events he's describing - unless, of course, he was hiding in a nearby closet during all those ""intimate"" moments he is able to recount in such juicy and exhaustive detail?  Either that or the murder victim was one of the chattiest, kiss-and-tell gossips in the history of the movies.  And why does it take till the closing reels for the supposedly intelligent professional investigators to smell a rat in that setup?  Eventually, the twist-and-turn plotting leads to so much incoherence and confusion that you might well wonder if the filmmakers themselves understood what it was they were doing.Beyond the clumsy, inscrutable storytelling, ""Slow Burn"" also suffers from some of the most overripe dialogue this side of ""The Black Dahlia.""  With such knee-slapping howlers as ""She stood there like a tangerine, ripe and ready to be peeled"" and ""She walked in smelling like mashed potatoes and every guy within thirty feet wanted to be the gravy,"" the script could easily win First Prize in a Bad Film Noir Writing contest.  It's hard to believe at such times that the film isn't actually intended to be a parody (the acting sure suggests it on occasion).  On second thought, perhaps it would be best to stick with that notion; it just might go down easier that way.",2,inscrutable film noir cop drama,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2688,"['opening', 'scene', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'found', 'wandering', 'streets', 'city', 'disheveled', 'confused', 'informing', 'who', 'find', 'just', 'killed', 'rapist', 'self', 'defense', 'alleged', 'attacker', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'was', 'man', 'supposedly', 'met', 'one', 'night', 'record', 'store', 'who', 'then', 'proceeded', 'stalk', 'weeks', 'thereafter', 'Suddenly', 'head', 'D.A', 'office', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'friend', 'deceased', 'who', 'considerably', 'different', 'story', 'tell', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'murder', 'as', 'well', 'entirely', 'disparate', 'take', 'couple', 'relationship', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'dicey', 'when', 'discover', 'D.A', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'have', 'been', 'conducting', 'torrid', 'affair', 'own', 'number', 'years', 'now', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'rudimentary', 'storytelling', 'filmmaking', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'exactly', 'begin', 'compiling', 'list', 'shortcomings', 'start', 'something', 'inherently', 'self-defeating', 'pointless', 'constructing', 'narrative', 'two', 'widely', 'conflicting', 'viewpoints', 'la', 'Rashomon', 'when', 'one', 'supposed', 'eyewitnesses', 'already', 'dead', 'thus', 'unable', 'personally', 'relate', 'side', 'story', 'How', 'enhance', 'verisimilitude', 'tale', 'most', 'information', 'come', 'filtered', 'down', 'secondhand', 'source', 'person', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'present', 'events', 'describing', 'course', 'was', 'hiding', 'nearby', 'closet', 'intimate', 'moments', 'able', 'recount', 'such', 'juicy', 'exhaustive', 'detail', 'murder', 'victim', 'was', 'one', 'chattiest', 'kiss-and-tell', 'gossips', 'history', 'movies', 'why', 'take', 'till', 'closing', 'reels', 'supposedly', 'intelligent', 'professional', 'investigators', 'smell', 'rat', 'setup', 'Eventually', 'twist-and-turn', 'plotting', 'so', 'much', 'incoherence', 'confusion', 'might', 'well', 'wonder', 'filmmakers', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'were', 'doing.Beyond', 'clumsy', 'inscrutable', 'storytelling', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'also', 'most', 'overripe', 'dialogue', 'side', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'such', 'knee-slapping', 'howlers', 'stood', 'tangerine', 'ripe', 'ready', 'be', 'peeled', 'walked', 'smelling', 'mashed', 'potatoes', 'guy', 'thirty', 'feet', 'wanted', 'be', 'gravy', 'script', 'could', 'easily', 'win', 'First', 'Prize', 'Bad', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Writing', 'contest', 'hard', 'believe', 'such', 'times', 'film', ""n't"", 'actually', 'intended', 'be', 'parody', 'acting', 'sure', 'occasion', 'second', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'stick', 'notion', 'just', 'might', 'go', 'down', 'easier', 'way']",Slow Burn 2007

Ray Liotta plays a District attourny Ford Cole in the middle of a campaign for mayor when crisis hits.  His beautiful Assistant DA, Jolene Blalock, gets caught up in a ""self defense"" killing at her appartment.  How is this going to reflect on the DA, will it hurt his Campaingn against crime, particularly organized crime.  The film takes off from there, having plenty of twists and turns, but this DA finds himself in a struggle with time and in a confusing game tracking down what actually happened this night at his assistant DA's appartment...and it has connections to what he always wanted, the Kingpin crime lord.It was entertaining, nice pace and action/drama.  Nudity/sex scenes not really needed and overdone, and I caught on to what the ending would be about midway through, but the story was good enough to keep me drawn in just to make sure I was right.  Check this one out, another overlooked film with Ray Liotta, who had another good film a couple years back with ""controll"" that had a short theater life.
