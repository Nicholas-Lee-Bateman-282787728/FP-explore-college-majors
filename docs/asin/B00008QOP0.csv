The sound mixing and score would've improved it. For a low budget film, it's fine quality.It's an obvious message (no subtlety), so it's perfect for children ages 6 and up. The movie wants to simplify and drive home a message from the Bible. You might want to watch it first, since it talks of being martyred. Children will come away with a sense of appreciation of the great sacrifices people in the past have made for Christianity.Then it's turned on the modern boys' experiences of persecution--how it's so much less-- and how modern Christians need to stand up for their beliefs in their own type of experiences.I gave it 4 stars for ""heart"".",4,Teaches about standing for your beliefs,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,758,"['will', 'be', 'acting', 'awards', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'compared', 'other', 'Christian', 'films', 'regard', 'sound', 'mixing', 'score', 'would', ""'ve"", 'improved', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'fine', 'quality.It', 'obvious', 'message', 'subtlety', 'perfect', 'children', 'ages', '6', 'up', 'movie', 'simplify', 'drive', 'home', 'message', 'Bible', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'being', 'martyred', 'Children', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'sense', 'appreciation', 'great', 'sacrifices', 'people', 'past', 'have', 'made', 'Christianity.Then', 'turned', 'modern', 'boys', 'experiences', 'persecution', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'how', 'modern', 'Christians', 'need', 'stand', 'up', 'beliefs', 'own', 'type', 'experiences.I', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'heart']",N/A
