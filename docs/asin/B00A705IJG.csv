1606187,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B00A705IJG,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]","Secret reunion is a film about male bonding of literal opposites as two spies from North and South Korea begin the film through a cat and mouse games and turn partners by the end of the film. This is a great spy versus spy who both love their countries, we hardly get to see such movies as this theme has lost its favor.  Secret Reunion is a great spy film with some good stunts and smart story twists to make this a worthwhile watch.Sung Ji-won (Gang Dong-won) and Lee Han-gyu (Song Kang-ho) are special agents for North and South Korea. They almost bump in to each other at a shootout  resulting from the at the very onset of the movie.botched assassination of a defector from the South.Their life changes because of this. and years later they bump in to each other again.Lee, runs a private detective agency now and he hires Sung because he thinks that he can be used to break the spy ring and Sung thinks he can break the Southern spy ring. There are many funny moments between the two men and they start discovering that they many things in commonThe direction and the editing is both top notch and the chase scenes, hallmarks of great spy movies are truly top notch. The actors are great especially Kang Ho, who essays a role that could have easily been a joke. Sung as the cold assassin also acts very well and shows the right amount of balance.

The acting is superb, as is the direction and camera work. It has the look of a big budget film which I'm sure it was in Korea. I've become a big fan of the South Korean film industry, which along with films from Norway and Sweden are the best movies being made for the last few years.

1606189,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B00A705IJG,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[2, 2]","Agent Lee Han-gyoo fails to stop an infamous North Korean assassin, known as Shadow, and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Ji-won, from assassinating a North Korean defector. Han-gyoo is discharged, and Ji-won is mistakenly labeled as a traitor. Years later, Han-gyoo and Ji-won begin to work together as private investigators, each with ulterior motives. Secret Reunion is a tense, often humorous action film.The story in this film is great. It works perfectly as a thrilling action film with hilarious comedy elements; it also has some commentary on people and their inhumane actions, regardless of origin (as in, because someone is from a different area/region, it doesn't automatically make them a bad person). The underlying messages aren't heavy or preached, you can watch this movie strictly for its high entertainment value. I was lost for the first few minutes, but I was quickly able to grasp the story; the rest of the storytelling was smooth. There are plenty of witty exchanges/actions between characters, intense chase scenes and shootouts, and a few twists, as well. The ending of the film was very suspenseful and surprising. The acting was great, Song Kang-Ho and Kang Dong-won were amazing as the leads. The music was great, what you'd expect from a modern action film.Overall, Secret Reunion is a superb action-thriller with genuinely funny moments. As of 4/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.Secret Reunion has strong violence and blood.",5,"A Tense, Often Humorous Action Film...

I might have given it 3.5 or 3.75 stars if I could have, but it's better than 3, so... 4 for the effort. The Korean guards infiltrating to the North for adventure, I'd seen. The northern spies in the South, specifically Seoul, I had not. New material here, dealing with the seemingly untouched subject of espionage between the Koreas, except North to South. The hard edge of the northern characters versus the weaker, yet organized southerners (trying to catch them)... the codes, the fights, etc. Neat. If you're from the U.S. or Europe, you get to see Seoul, too, which is not every day. The South Korean lead has a good command of his part. Carries the action and the humor well. The Northern spy comes off a bit boyish at first, but leaps into action with an authority.Maybe just me, but I thought they cg'd a part or two that wasn't necessary. Not to the point that an American film might, but still...Not a bad little movie.
