759846,A1JTTI1KH3DOCY,B00009YXAY,"Doggymcnuggets ""doggymcnuggets""","[0, 0]","I recently watched this with my 3 year old son and was mostly disappointed.  The film doesn't display any real heart or creativity to make it stand out and I doubt this one will garner any repeat viewings.  It felt like a second rate Saturday morning cartoon rather than a movie in terms of the animation and overall production quality.  The story is an odd mix of wacky pratfall antics, serious subject matter like animal cruelty, and left-field songs about things like the internet (seriously, no kidding).  This film just pales in comparison to releases from Pixar or most of Disney's other major movie projects, and isn't even on par with other more creative TV programs for kids like Charlie & Lola or Little Einsteins.

759849,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B00009YXAY,L. J Nary,"[0, 0]","The characters are all working and playing together, that is the nicest best thing about this cartoon. They help each other. They work with other appliances or furniture to help their human and the animals, so that you feel happy and safe inside. In this picture, they worked with the big tube computer to save the beautiful animals from lab research and found their humans thesis which had been lost on his labtop. I like the toaster's voice, it is so pretty. The radio gave up his life for another. I felt sad when he gave his battery up because he was so hurt by his friends inability to understand or forgive his actions when he clearly showed he was hurt. That part is not so good. He gave his little life up and he was so full of playfulness and energy and he wanted to help. Its just characters get mischievous and act out or are in struggles. Which is a reflection of real life. I just loved the safty of their togetherness, they could be themselves and the blanket and how much he wants to comfort, their safe feeling of energy. I also really like the vacumn because he reminds me of an eeyore. The monkey was sweet too and had a grandfather voice. I also found out that whatever is in a computer is always there and if you find the right person or information, you can retrieve whats lost, since my favorites were lost.",4,Such a nice bunch of characters,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,1329,"['characters', 'are', 'working', 'playing', 'together', 'nicest', 'best', 'thing', 'cartoon', 'help', 'other', 'work', 'other', 'appliances', 'furniture', 'help', 'human', 'animals', 'feel', 'happy', 'safe', 'inside', 'picture', 'worked', 'big', 'tube', 'computer', 'save', 'beautiful', 'animals', 'lab', 'research', 'found', 'humans', 'thesis', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'labtop', 'toaster', 'voice', 'so', 'pretty', 'radio', 'gave', 'up', 'life', 'felt', 'sad', 'when', 'gave', 'battery', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'hurt', 'friends', 'inability', 'understand', 'forgive', 'actions', 'when', 'clearly', 'showed', 'was', 'hurt', 'part', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'gave', 'little', 'life', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'playfulness', 'energy', 'wanted', 'help', 'just', 'characters', 'get', 'mischievous', 'act', 'out', 'are', 'struggles', 'Which', 'reflection', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'loved', 'safty', 'togetherness', 'could', 'be', 'blanket', 'how', 'much', 'comfort', 'safe', 'feeling', 'energy', 'also', 'really', 'vacumn', 'eeyore', 'monkey', 'was', 'sweet', 'too', 'had', 'grandfather', 'voice', 'also', 'found', 'out', 'computer', 'always', 'there', 'find', 'right', 'person', 'information', 'can', 'retrieve', 'whats', 'lost', 'favorites', 'were', 'lost']",N/A

759853,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B00009YXAY,unicornelia,"[5, 5]","This movie is good on several counts. First, it may be the third installment in the Brave Little Toaster trilogy, but it's obviously intended to be inserted between the original and ""Mars,"" to tie together the Master's departure for college and his marriage to Chris/fatherhood to Rob, Jr. in ""Mars."" That development seemed to come much too soon, leaving us to wonder just what occurred in between. This movie carries a wonderful message about animals and their rights, focusing rather heavily on a snake named Mergatroid, a devoted white mother cat named Maisie, a disaffected rat named Ratzo, an elderly ape named Sebastian, and a sweet Chihuahua named Alberto. The music in this movie is extremely good for a sequel. We're introduced to some new appliances as well; a modem, female computer, some printers, a security camera in the police Dobermans' pen. On the whole, the main characters retain their personalities true to form, but don't have quite enough funny or poignant lines to allow this to come close to matching its original. Not that anything ever could. This is a worthy sequel. The Master is studying to be a veterinarian, a suitable profession. The interaction of appliances and animals is interesting.Oh, and let's not forget Wittgenschtein, the old super-computer! This movie was obviously planned before ""Mars,"" because it explains how he came to live in the museum. Brian Doyle-Murray does a great job as the voice of this funny, nice guy. And it's a touching moment when Radio sacrifices his own WFC-11-12-55 tube to save him. The Toaster hasn't been the only brave one throughout these movies. The others have done some pretty brave things themselves.Overall, not a bad sequel at all. In fact, in my humble opinion this trilogy ranks right up there with Lord of the Rings; you've got the Brave Little Toaster: The Fellowship of the Office Chair, The Two Rescues, & Return From Mars.",5,A very worthy part 2 of the trilogy.,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,1906,"['movie', 'good', 'several', 'counts', 'First', 'may', 'be', 'third', 'installment', 'Brave', 'Little', 'Toaster', 'trilogy', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'inserted', 'original', 'Mars', 'tie', 'together', 'Master', 'departure', 'college', 'marriage', 'Chris/fatherhood', 'Rob', 'Jr.', 'Mars', 'development', 'seemed', 'come', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'leaving', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'occurred', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'message', 'animals', 'rights', 'focusing', 'rather', 'heavily', 'snake', 'named', 'Mergatroid', 'devoted', 'white', 'mother', 'cat', 'named', 'Maisie', 'disaffected', 'rat', 'named', 'Ratzo', 'elderly', 'ape', 'named', 'Sebastian', 'sweet', 'Chihuahua', 'named', 'Alberto', 'music', 'movie', 'extremely', 'good', 'sequel', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'new', 'appliances', 'as', 'well', 'modem', 'female', 'computer', 'printers', 'security', 'camera', 'police', 'Dobermans', 'pen', 'whole', 'main', 'characters', 'retain', 'personalities', 'true', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'enough', 'funny', 'poignant', 'lines', 'allow', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'original', 'Not', 'anything', 'ever', 'could', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'Master', 'studying', 'be', 'veterinarian', 'suitable', 'profession', 'interaction', 'appliances', 'animals', 'interesting.Oh', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Wittgenschtein', 'old', 'super-computer', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'planned', 'Mars', 'how', 'came', 'live', 'museum', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'great', 'job', 'voice', 'funny', 'nice', 'guy', 'touching', 'moment', 'when', 'Radio', 'own', 'WFC-11-12-55', 'tube', 'save', 'Toaster', ""n't"", 'been', 'only', 'brave', 'one', 'movies', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'pretty', 'brave', 'things', 'themselves.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'sequel', 'fact', 'humble', 'opinion', 'trilogy', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Lord', 'Rings', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Brave', 'Little', 'Toaster', 'Fellowship', 'Office', 'Chair', 'Two', 'Rescues', 'Return', 'From', 'Mars']",N/A
759854,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00009YXAY,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","Looking for something to entertain the kids on a wet night? This installment of the Toaster series will fit the bill quite nicely. Although it's not as well written, directed or produced as the first film (or even the second), To The Rescue does deal with a number of moral issues and difficult decisions that the Toaster and his pals have to make to save the life of some lab animals.More of a slapdash affair than the first film (or, in my opinion, the convoluted sequel), Rescue is a poor relation to the original film. THe characterizations and conflicts are still strong and suspenseful but the plotting is sloppy. Most younger children won't notice but a few older ones might. Luckily, kids can suspend their disbelief a lot easier than adults.Kids won't pay attention to the quality of animation as much as adults and the gaps in the plot probably won't be an issue. The songs are entertaining and almost to the quality of the first film. The best vocal performance comes from Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill Murray's brother and another Saturday Night Live/Second City alum) as the computer. His distinctive gravelly voice and performance add quality to this average sequel.Just a note for parents this is the second film in the Toaster series. It was planned and written after the third film Goes To Mars and is the only one in the series not inspired by Thomas Disch's children's stories.",3,Entertaining but not up to the original,1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,1391,"['Looking', 'something', 'entertain', 'kids', 'wet', 'night', 'installment', 'Toaster', 'series', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'quite', 'nicely', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'second', 'Rescue', 'deal', 'number', 'moral', 'issues', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'Toaster', 'pals', 'have', 'make', 'save', 'life', 'lab', 'animals.More', 'slapdash', 'affair', 'first', 'film', 'opinion', 'convoluted', 'sequel', 'Rescue', 'poor', 'relation', 'original', 'film', 'THe', 'characterizations', 'conflicts', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'suspenseful', 'plotting', 'sloppy', 'Most', 'younger', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'few', 'older', 'ones', 'might', 'Luckily', 'kids', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'lot', 'easier', 'adults.Kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'quality', 'animation', 'as', 'much', 'adults', 'gaps', 'plot', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'issue', 'songs', 'are', 'entertaining', 'almost', 'quality', 'first', 'film', 'best', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'brother', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live/Second', 'City', 'alum', 'computer', 'distinctive', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'performance', 'add', 'quality', 'average', 'sequel.Just', 'note', 'parents', 'second', 'film', 'Toaster', 'series', 'was', 'planned', 'written', 'third', 'film', 'Goes', 'Mars', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'not', 'inspired', 'Thomas', 'Disch', 'children', 'stories']",N/A
