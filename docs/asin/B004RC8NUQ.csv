I don't usually watch ""chick flicks"", but i'm a movie collector, so some ""get through"". This film is a (hard core) formula movie for this genres (chick flick). I have to say that when this movie started I couldn't help but think how ""prissy and ""gay-like"" (the new generation depicted by this movie...) was looking and acting. As the story started to go... it started to become entertaining. One thing that I just couldn't get past was the casual way people had sex with each other. I mean even back in my day of ""free love"" (despite what you may of heard or read) when you were ""boning a girl"" you liked, you didn't pass her around like a reefer (as some of the characters were doing). My ""distilled"" comment for this movie is that if you strip away all the ""fluff"" around the main story it is somewhat entertaining. Is it believable or true to life... not a chance in hell.

1426588,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004RC8NUQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[93, 106]","What ""No Strings Attached"" lacks in originality and unpredictability is made up for in the charm and likeability of its leads. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman not only have great onscreen chemistry, they also are individually well developed - at least, as well developed as they can be within the boundaries of a romantic comedy. It's also surprisingly funny, although it's only partly because of the well placed raunchy sex jokes; the film is one of the few recent romantic comedies to successfully find that balance between sweetness and silliness, and while that's only moderate praise for writer Elizabeth Meriwether and director Ivan Reitman, at least it's proof that they know how to take innately ridiculous material and make it accessible to general audiences.The film is not realistic in any way, shape, or form, but that's just stating the obvious because we don't go to movies like this looking for meaning or truth. It tells the story of Adam and Emma (Kutcher and Portman), who first met as teenagers in summer camp and saw each other off and on over the next several years. In the present day, they live in Los Angeles, Adam an assistant on a TV series that crosses ""Glee"" with ""High School Musical,"" Emma a doctor at UCLA. They have successfully maintained a friendship, although there's always a flash of jealousy whenever one of them shows up with a significant other. When Adam's girlfriend dumps him for his father (Kevin Kline), he goes on a bender, makes several phone calls to women he knows ... and wakes up in Emma's apartment, naked and surrounded by Emma's friends and fellow residents.No sex took place the night before. The morning after, however, Adam and Emma suddenly drop their defenses and just go for it. That's when they decide to take a stab at being friends with benefits; they will use each other for sex at any time of the day, but they won't commit to anything long-term. Surprisingly, this comes at the insistence of Emma, who for reasons left a little obscure is frightened by serious relationships. This is made clear in her habit of texting Adam rather than seeing him in person, a trend that has become all too real in today's smart phone society. I'll stop short of saying this movie is sending a message about technology limiting social interaction, although there are hints of it all throughout.No more of the plot needs to be described. It goes through the motions and ends exactly the way we expect it to end. There are, however, a couple of side characters that deserve to be mentioned. One of the best is Adam's on-set colleague, Lucy (Lake Bell), who's deeply neurotic and talks at a hundred miles an hour. Making this kind of character likeable is next to impossible, and yet Bell pulls it off, probably because she understood that there's a fine line between comedy relief and annoyance. And then there are Adam's best friends, played by Chris Bridges and Jake Johnson; they aren't given all that much to do, but you can count on them for a few good male-oriented one-liners. Kline is somewhat underutilized as Adam's father, a former TV star who does drugs as if it was the 1970s and has a thing for much younger women. He's mostly just a counterpoint to his son, a way for the audience to see what Adam should not do when it comes to meeting and loving the opposite sex.One of the film's funniest scenes is in Emma's apartment, where she and her girlfriends - along with one gay man - spend the night together in the throes of menstrual agony. Knowing they're all on the same cycle, Adam stops by with a box full of cupcakes. He also gives Emma a period-specific mix CD, with titles I probably can't repeat for the purposes of this review. There's also a moment when Emma gives Adam a Valentine's Day card, which reads, ""You give me premature ventricular contractions."" I laughed hard. But then again, I was raised by registered nurses who specialized in cardiology, so I probably have an unfair advantage.Reitman made the right choices in the casting of Kutcher and Portman, for they have that compatibility movies like this require. Kutcher is especially enjoyable and plays what may be the warmest, most caring role of his entire career. Portman is also a natural fit for this movie, which is surprising given her latest stint as a mentally ill ballerina; it's good for even the most dedicated and serious of actors to reveal that they do in fact have a sense of humor. ""No Strings Attached"" is by no means a great movie, and it will never be in the same league as ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Ghostbusters II,"" my two favorite Reitman comedies. But if you're in the mood for a conventional lightweight romantic comedy, this movie gets the job done nicely.",4,Who Needs Love?

Talent becomes a less critical factor in these casting selections. Early last year, Amy Adams did one betweenDoubtand The Fighter, a silly one set in Ireland calledLeap Year, and now it's Natalie Portman's turn. This 2011 film has a more provocative premise and a snappier tone, but the sensibilities are still very much in rom-com territory. As written by first-time screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and directed by industry veteran Ivan Reitman (whose last film was the overdoneMy Super Ex-Girlfriend), the movie deftly asks a less than earth-shattering question: can two friends sustain a commitment-free sexual relationship without any emotional expectations? In an age when text messaging makes anyone instantly available, the answer naturally looks to be yes, but Hollywood convention intervenes.Set conveniently in LA, the plot centers on the friendship between Emma, an overworked medical resident, and Adam, an overlooked production assistant on aHigh School Musical-type show who longs to be a writer. Moving fleetly from summer camp to a frat party to an accidental run-in at an outdoor market, they definitely have a connection but never act upon it. In the meantime, their personalities take shape as adults nearing thirty. She is an unromantic pragmatist who has convinced herself that she doesn't need a relationship to have sex, while he is a pushover whose airheaded girlfriend dumps him for his father, a self-infatuated former sitcom TV celebrity. After an all-night drunken binge lands a naked Adam in Emma's apartment, she proposes they take advantage of their mutual attraction and start a purely physical relationship with no expectation of commitment. She's in charge, and he agrees to play along. Needless to say, both start to have feelings that pull them in predictable directions with Adam also dealing with his unresolved anger toward his father. There is no real tension to the central dilemma since we all know how the movie will end, especially with stars as attractive and laid-back as Portman and Ashton Kutcher playing the leads.What I do like is how Portman doesn't subterfuge her own sensibilities as an actress to play Emma within formula. She plays a workaholic but on her terms as a sensible professional who needs to manage her schedule carefully. Unlike rom-com contemporaries like Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway or Kristin Bell, Portman comes across as too smart to go through much humiliating shtick to get her inevitable comeuppance beyond devouring a box of donut holes. Even though Kutcher has more experience in this genre, he comes across a bit more substantive this time around and shows a natural rapport with Portman that makes the movie breeze along with aplomb. A solid supporting cast helps with Greta Gerwig (Greenberg) and Mindy Kaling (The Office) as Emma's sharp-tongued roommates; Lake Bell (It's Complicated) as Adam's dithering, sweet-natured associate; Jake Johnson and a low-key Ludacris as his horndog buddies; and Kevin Kline as his vainglorious father. I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes as the veteran doctor whom Emma fawns over. Special mention should go to Rogier Stoffers whose bright-colored cinematography brings contemporary LA to vivid life.",4,Portman Elevates a Formulaic Rom-Com with Provocative Possibilities,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,3406,"['When', 'actresses', 'certain', 'caliber', 'age', 'reach', 'certain', 'level', 'potential', 'bankability', 'critical', 'respect', 'inevitable', 'do', 'standard-issue', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Talent', 'less', 'critical', 'factor', 'casting', 'selections', 'Early', 'last', 'year', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'did', 'one', 'betweenDoubtand', 'Fighter', 'silly', 'one', 'set', 'Ireland', 'calledLeap', 'Year', 'now', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'turn', '2011', 'film', 'more', 'provocative', 'premise', 'snappier', 'tone', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'rom-com', 'territory', 'written', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Elizabeth', 'Meriwether', 'directed', 'industry', 'veteran', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'overdoneMy', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'movie', 'deftly', 'less', 'earth-shattering', 'question', 'can', 'two', 'friends', 'sustain', 'commitment-free', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'emotional', 'expectations', 'age', 'when', 'text', 'messaging', 'anyone', 'instantly', 'available', 'answer', 'naturally', 'be', 'yes', 'Hollywood', 'convention', 'intervenes.Set', 'conveniently', 'LA', 'plot', 'centers', 'friendship', 'Emma', 'overworked', 'medical', 'resident', 'Adam', 'overlooked', 'production', 'assistant', 'aHigh', 'School', 'Musical-type', 'show', 'who', 'be', 'writer', 'Moving', 'fleetly', 'summer', 'camp', 'frat', 'party', 'accidental', 'run-in', 'outdoor', 'market', 'definitely', 'have', 'connection', 'never', 'act', 'meantime', 'personalities', 'take', 'shape', 'adults', 'nearing', 'thirty', 'unromantic', 'pragmatist', 'who', 'convinced', ""n't"", 'need', 'relationship', 'have', 'sex', 'pushover', 'airheaded', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'self-infatuated', 'former', 'sitcom', 'TV', 'celebrity', 'all-night', 'drunken', 'binge', 'naked', 'Adam', 'Emma', 'apartment', 'take', 'advantage', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'start', 'purely', 'physical', 'relationship', 'expectation', 'commitment', 'charge', 'play', 'along', 'Needless', 'say', 'start', 'have', 'feelings', 'pull', 'predictable', 'directions', 'Adam', 'also', 'dealing', 'unresolved', 'anger', 'father', 'real', 'tension', 'central', 'dilemma', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'especially', 'stars', 'attractive', 'laid-back', 'Portman', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'playing', 'leads.What', 'do', 'like', 'how', 'Portman', ""n't"", 'subterfuge', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'actress', 'play', 'Emma', 'formula', 'workaholic', 'terms', 'sensible', 'professional', 'who', 'manage', 'schedule', 'carefully', 'rom-com', 'contemporaries', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'Portman', 'too', 'smart', 'go', 'much', 'humiliating', 'shtick', 'get', 'inevitable', 'comeuppance', 'devouring', 'box', 'donut', 'holes', 'Even', 'Kutcher', 'more', 'experience', 'genre', 'bit', 'more', 'substantive', 'time', 'natural', 'rapport', 'Portman', 'movie', 'breeze', 'aplomb', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Greta', 'Gerwig', 'Greenberg', 'Mindy', 'Kaling', 'Office', 'Emma', 'sharp-tongued', 'roommates', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'Complicated', 'Adam', 'dithering', 'sweet-natured', 'associate', 'Jake', 'Johnson', 'low-key', 'Ludacris', 'horndog', 'buddies', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'vainglorious', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'veteran', 'doctor', 'whom', 'Emma', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'Rogier', 'Stoffers', 'bright-colored', 'cinematography', 'contemporary', 'LA', 'vivid', 'life']",N/A

As in literature, Romance and all its entanglements and disasters make up a good portion of Hollywood's output.  Yet, when it's paired with comedy, while a few classics are produced (""Bringing Up Baby"" comes to mind) most of the genre is pretty fluffball, rarely earning critical respect even with the passage of time.  ""No Strings Attached"" is not going to end up on one of the better lists of All Time Movies.""No Strings Attached"" as the billboards and cover imply, has tried to up the ante with Sex and near nudity, but the film remains nothing more than sweet entertainment, albeit for a more sex-tolerant crowd.  It's a dead ringer for ""Friends With Benefits"", at almost every point, and the fact that the leading men in both films, Ashton Kucher in this one and Justin Timberlake in the other, are men who make the heart flutter but get almost no  respect, is just one more parallel.  If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen the other, but if you're in a funk and need diversionary entertainment, yet can't stand the thought of ""Mama Mia""; streaming both films back to back is your corn-syrup-laden box of Mac n Cheese.  Mac n Cheese with real  bacon, because all four of the main actors are simply delightful when spared the antics of the wardrobe department.Oddly enough, with all the nudity and simulated sex, neither film is the least bit erotic.  Your evangelical relatives will never believe you, but what do they know?Basically, the two main characters are introduced at Camp, bump up against each other in College, and finally find themselves in LaLa land as adults; she's finishing med school, and he's an aspiring writer with a famous dad whose shadow he finds diffiicult to escape.  But, he does have that which many new grads won't, these days:  A swank, designer-made house, a BMW, and a job.In any case, she has commitment issues, mother oriented as it turns out,  and thus they agree to be Sex Friends, something which seems to puzzle everyone they know in Los Angeles, but would be so 2011 in San Francisco.  In effect,  they have a relationship a lot of gay men have, with pregnancy not being an issue; lots of sex with no entanglement.Except that they get entangled.  That's not as bad as it would seem:  Seventy years ago such ""loose"" women had to be punished, and usually Hollywood killed them, or in some other way wrote them into purgatory by the end of the film.  And it was always the women.  It's still the women. The guys here are exactly what they tell us women want, but these women don't want them.Ah well.  If you keep eating that mac n cheese you're going to die.  If you expect to find deep meaning in Romantic Comedies, well you're still going to die, but from something that pops up while you're distracted.

1426660,AX9C10JD538D9,B004RC8NUQ,Liviania,"[2, 4]","The friend I was staying with this weekend, who I shall call R, encourages my worst pop culture impulses. Or perhaps I encourage hers. Either way, we decided we needed to view a double billing of No Strings Attached andFriends With Benefits.All four lead actors (Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Justin Timberlake) were charming. Portman's Emma was my favorite character. She's brilliant, driven, and the movie doesn't make her sacrifice her career for true love. Justin Timberlake's Dylan was probably my least favorite, for reasons explained later. Therefore, No Strings Attached wins the leads.Both films have terrific supporting casts. I loved the side characters in No Strings Attached - Emma's neurotic med student roommates, Adam's friends with bad advice, coworker Lucy, and Kevin Kline as one of the worst parents ever. Then Friends with Benefits's came along with Woody Harrelson as a manly, openly gay coworker and Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father with Alzheimer's. Plus, there's tons of brilliant cameos. Friends with Benefits wins secondary characters.Final category: story. In No Strings Attached, Emma and Adam have been casual acquaintances for years. After beginning a casual sex relationship, Adam clearly wants something more while Emma isn't ready to make an emotional commitment. While both of them come close to screwing things up, neither makes a truly awful mistake. Friends with Benefits's Dylan and Jaime become friends first, then decide to sleep together. They obviously become something more, but Dylan isn't ready to admit it - which causes him to say some very hurtful things about Jaime. She, of course, overhears them. That scene felt cliche and made me dislike Dylan, but overall Friends with Benefits was funnier, more realistic, and had a truer emotional core. Thus, Friends with Benefits wins, by a hair, the better storyline.I slightly preferred No Strings Attached and R felt the same about Friends with Benefits. But both of us agree that if you're going to watch a 2011 romantic comedy, it should beCrazy, Stupid, Love. Also, Thor had a terrific trailer.

However, if you have some depth and are looking for a movie that's entertaining, has decent acting without an inane plot, look elsewhere. The plot is a non plot and the jokes, non jokes. The dialog is pretentious and sloppily written.  The movie is about a busy woman who gets into a relationship with a man so that they could ""use each other for sex"". She predictably falls in love with him and him with her and go on off into the sun set, etc. Yes, this is all there is to it. This is just a sad attempt at movie-making even by today's movie standards. It's like a big unapologetic cliche that drones on forever.

I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan at all. I think he is really annoying, however he did well in this role and meshed well with Natalie Portman. Kevin Kline plays Ashton's father in the film and he was hilarious, one of my favorite funny actors. All of the actors did well and pulled their weight through the film.

I must've been having one very easily amused day.Original review: With any project that Ashton Kutcher is involved in, I have to be prepared for ANYTHING. And this film is just that. I spent some of the movie with my front collar over my face because I was more embarrassed for the characters than THEY were.Funniest (and oddest scenes): 1) I never thought I'd like ""99 Problems"" as a country song, but I'd love to hear the extended version of that. I rewound that a couple of times because it was so GOOD! 2) I loved that, ""Am I boring you?"" scene with the dog. I rewound that one a few times and cracked up every time the dog reacted.Most awkward: 1) That period CD was so cringe-worthy. I actually Google'd the lyrics to see if she really says, ""And I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding."" I'm sure that wasn't what Leona Lewis had in mind, but I'd be especially interested in her reaction to that scene. Hilarious in the grossest way! 2) Pretty much every sex scene was anything but romantic especially the one with him confirming they were having sex like it was like saying, ""Hey, we reached the top of the mountain. How 'bout that?"" 3) The pole scene when they were kicked out, only because I had a similar situation via phone. That was uncomfortable to watch only because I had pretty much the same reaction. 4) The ""fingering"" question--AWFUL timing, but I laughed while I shook my head. 5) The ""boner"" phone conversation. I almost fell off the couch laughing at that. 6) The balloon. Aw man, I hope no guy in real life really did that after he saw the film, but quite honestly if somebody did that to me, I'd laugh...hard.Overall I thought this was a good film. I liked the serious scenes more than the comedic scenes but not by much--it was about 55/45. I don't think I'll ever understand the logic of FWB so I thought this was an interesting topic. I like the way it was covered, realistic instead of preachy. Would I recommend it?

Emma, who has intimacy problems, finds this concept easier than Adam and that is when the problems start.This has some decent jokes in it and it had me laughing out loud a few times.

The usual issues arise but the friend networks on each side keep things fun, along with Kline adding some great comedy as the mid/late life crisis dad going through his own serious love issues. No big surprises here, but this is about watching pretty people doing adult things in this modern era. The supplements are interesting and include:* Deleted scenes, 5 @ 11:04 minutes. The two obvious sequences where things had been removed early in the film are shown here (Reitman awkwardly edited the Jewish references out of the funeral scene). Glad they cut out more of the dancing high school numbers.* Alternate storyline, 2 @ 3:45 minutes. Wish this would have been left in the film as it shows Ashton's and Lake Bell's characters having a decent relationship, worth the watch.* Dos & Donts of Modern Love, 8:46 minutes. A clip-heavy take on all of the actors/creators giving their take on how modern relationships work like depicted in the film.* Sassy halls of Secret High, 11:22 minutes. What actually makes this Glee-ish mess watchable is Kevin Kline - again. All of the extras are worth the time just to see him talk about what he does - hilarious. If you are into the dance routines and musical references this would be your supplement.* Sex friends, the making of, 20:46 minutes. Lengthy talking head piece with plenty of clips and honest input about the film - including the original title; F**kbuddies. Virtually everyone gets interviewed here; if you are a fan of Meriwether's writing this is your one to watch.* Commentary by Reitman.

After a drunken adventure ends with Adam (Kutcher) naked on Emma's (Portman) couch they decide to strike a deal.  When Adam wants something more the problems begin.  This is a chick flick that many guys will also enjoy.  A little more girlie then I was expecting, but still a really, really funny movie.  The movie is pretty raunchy in some parts and you will find it difficult not to laugh.  If you are looking for a chick flick that your boyfriend/husband will watch with you this is a great choice.  If you are looking for a movie for your girlfriend/wife that will not be two hours of torture for you this is a great choice.  Very, very funny for both sexes, enough romance for the ladies, and enough comedy for the men.  A perfect movie for date night.  A little predictable, but most romantic comedies are.  I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I actually would.*Also try - Going The Distance & Love And Other Drugs",4,A very funny chick-flick that both men and women will enjoy.

The craziness and the intensity of their feelings and beliefs, regarding what a relationship (or non-relationship) should be, actually rang true to me.  People do crazy things when they are strongly attracted to one another--whether you are the person like Kushner who tries to frantically push the relationship forward, or the person like Portman who refuses to even consider the possibility that something special is happening.  Both parties, are, in point of fact, terrified that this thing will follow a different course than the one to which they are currently committed.For me, a very large and essential part of the appeal of this movie is that I could actually FEEL the intensity of the attraction between the characters played by Portman and Kushner!I was particularly taken by one scene in which Portman begins to realize how much she cares for Kushner.  As you would expect for someone who has strong emotions, her description of her feelings for Kushner are often incoherent.  I really loved it that she begin this outpouring of her feelings by exclaiming ""He's so tall!""",5,Full of the craziness and intensity that pervade real relationships,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1235,"['most', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'could', 'actually', 'identify', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'leads', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Ashton', 'Kushner', 'craziness', 'intensity', 'feelings', 'beliefs', 'regarding', 'what', 'relationship', 'non-relationship', 'should', 'be', 'actually', 'true', 'People', 'do', 'crazy', 'things', 'when', 'are', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'one', 'are', 'person', 'Kushner', 'who', 'frantically', 'push', 'relationship', 'forward', 'person', 'Portman', 'who', 'even', 'consider', 'possibility', 'something', 'special', 'happening', 'parties', 'are', 'point', 'fact', 'terrified', 'thing', 'will', 'follow', 'different', 'course', 'one', 'are', 'currently', 'very', 'large', 'essential', 'part', 'appeal', 'movie', 'could', 'actually', 'FEEL', 'intensity', 'attraction', 'characters', 'played', 'Portman', 'Kushner', 'was', 'particularly', 'taken', 'one', 'scene', 'Portman', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'Kushner', 'would', 'expect', 'someone', 'who', 'strong', 'emotions', 'description', 'feelings', 'Kushner', 'are', 'often', 'incoherent', 'really', 'loved', 'begin', 'outpouring', 'feelings', 'exclaiming', 'so', 'tall']",N/A

Also people wanted to see these to Hollywood stars going at it, well you barely see anything that you wouldn't see in a PG-13 film, there isn't even any NUDITY! Natalie Portman is a strange person to say the least, but if you want something better as far as a sex scene with a much better story then check out Black Swan. I can't stand Ashton Kutcher as he does the same old dork, clueless boy character that he does in all his films. Good Luck Chuck was much better, funnier and had a LOT more sex in it, also Natalie Portman (looks wise) just doesnt even compare to Jessica Alba. This is just a run through of nothing more than finding a girl you were friends with, having some casual sex, then liking her at the end, nothing more nothing less. There are about 200 movies just like this one in the last 8 years or so that have come out as well. Comedies in the last 10 years have really gone down hill. I can't even think of the last great comedy that i've seen.
