All the comedy is visual (i.e. there are no spoken words) and clean, so you don't have to worry about your kids becoming the new miscreants on the block as a result of viewing any of the episodes.  Each of the episodes, by the way, is less than five minutes long.  It's great to hear your kids laugh out loud at a show rather than staring dumbly at the screen, befuddled by a program that's over their heads.(Another wholesome and entertaining show for toddlers isPeep and the Big Wide World.  There is talking, but it's all fairly simple (i.e. no big words or complex plots) and clean (no lewdness, no one saying ""stupid"" or ""dumb"").  I should point out, as well, that the children love the show, too.)",5,"Simple, short, and fun for the whole family",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,887,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'toddler', 'two', 'house', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'most', 'what', 'TV', 'rest', 'assured', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'show', 'children', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'visual', 'i.e', 'are', 'spoken', 'words', 'clean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'kids', 'becoming', 'new', 'miscreants', 'block', 'result', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'way', 'less', 'five', 'minutes', 'long', 'great', 'hear', 'kids', 'loud', 'show', 'rather', 'staring', 'dumbly', 'screen', 'befuddled', 'program', 'over', 'heads', 'wholesome', 'entertaining', 'show', 'toddlers', 'isPeep', 'Big', 'Wide', 'World', 'talking', 'fairly', 'simple', 'i.e', 'big', 'words', 'complex', 'plots', 'clean', 'lewdness', 'one', 'saying', 'stupid', 'dumb', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'love', 'show', 'too']",N/A

The character showed enough potential in that short movie that he went on to get his own tv show. The episodes are quite short and run about 6-7 minutes each. The show follows the exploits of Shaun and the herd he lives with and takes care of. The herd is owned by a nameless Farmer who only ""speaks"" in gibberish mumbles. The animals on the farm are watched over by a sheepdog named Blitzer who has a good friendship with Shaun.  The main antagonists in the episodes on OFF THE BAA! are the Pigs.OFF THE BAA! contains eight episodes of Shaun the Sheep:""Off the Baa!"" - in this episode a cabbage rolls into the farm yard and Shaun and the flock use it to play a game of soccer. The game gets out of hand when the Pigs want to eat the cabbage for lunch.""Timmy In a Tizzy"" - the youngest sheep in the herd and Shaun's cousin, Timmy, become very upset when the Farmer takes away his stuffed animal. Shaun and company do everything they can to get Timmy to quiet down. As a side note, Timmy now has his own spin-off for preschoolers called Timmy Time.""Buzz Off Bees"" - the Farmer decides to try his hand at harvesting honey and keeps a bee hive on the farm. Trouble ensues for everyone.""Who's the Mummy"" - a group of baby chick hatch and in the absence of their mother, they become convinced Shaun is their mother.""Mower Mouth"" - a goat eats everything in sight and gives Shirley (the sheep who will eat anything) a run for her money. The goat gets loose and the usual chaos ensues.""Fleeced"" - it's shearing day, but Shaun and the sheep are determined not to have their wool taken. They make an escape into town and try to go incognito through fashion.""Shaun Shoots the Sheep"" - Shaun discovers a camera and becomes a photographer. However, Blitzer and the Pigs want the camera, too.""Mountains Out of Molehills"" - a sheep dance is interrupted by an unruly mole. The flock goes to increasingly extreme measures to rid the farm of the troublesome mole's presence.There aren't very many extras on OFF THE BAA! There's about a five minute featurette  (""Meet the Animals"") with the art department of the show that features several school children talking about the show and the characters. There are some trailers for two Aardman-related video games (SHAUN THE SHEEP and WALLACE AND GROMIT: GRAND ADVENTURES). There's also some trailers for a few Lionsgate films.I really liked OFF THE BAA! I find Shaun the Sheep just as entertaining as Wallace and Gromit, but in a completely different way. The humor in both franchises is similar. However, Wallace and Gromit is essentially a buddy story, whereas Shaun the Sheep focuses on Shaun and the crazy family of animals he lives with.You can find all of the episodes of SHAUN THE SHEEP: OFF THE BAA! on SHAUN THE SHEEP SEASON ONE. OFF THE BAA! was released before the complete season one was available on DVD. With that said, if you aren't familiar with the show, OFF THE BAA! would be a good DVD to rent or buy to see if you liked the concept.",5,It's Shaun the Sheep!,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,3060,"['Shaun', 'Sheep', 'first', 'made', 'appearance', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'A', 'Close', 'Shave', 'character', 'showed', 'enough', 'potential', 'short', 'movie', 'went', 'get', 'own', 'tv', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'short', 'run', '6-7', 'minutes', 'show', 'exploits', 'Shaun', 'herd', 'care', 'herd', 'owned', 'nameless', 'Farmer', 'who', 'only', 'speaks', 'gibberish', 'mumbles', 'animals', 'farm', 'are', 'watched', 'sheepdog', 'named', 'Blitzer', 'who', 'good', 'friendship', 'Shaun', 'main', 'antagonists', 'episodes', 'BAA', 'are', 'Pigs.OFF', 'THE', 'BAA', 'contains', 'eight', 'episodes', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'Baa', 'episode', 'cabbage', 'farm', 'yard', 'Shaun', 'flock', 'use', 'play', 'game', 'soccer', 'game', 'hand', 'when', 'Pigs', 'want', 'eat', 'cabbage', 'lunch', 'Timmy', 'Tizzy', 'youngest', 'sheep', 'herd', 'Shaun', 'cousin', 'Timmy', 'become', 'very', 'upset', 'when', 'Farmer', 'away', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'Shaun', 'company', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'get', 'Timmy', 'quiet', 'down', 'side', 'note', 'Timmy', 'now', 'own', 'spin-off', 'preschoolers', 'called', 'Timmy', 'Time', 'Buzz', 'Off', 'Bees', 'Farmer', 'try', 'hand', 'harvesting', 'honey', 'bee', 'hive', 'farm', 'Trouble', 'ensues', 'everyone', 'Who', 'Mummy', 'group', 'baby', 'chick', 'hatch', 'absence', 'mother', 'become', 'convinced', 'Shaun', 'mother', 'Mower', 'Mouth', 'goat', 'everything', 'sight', 'Shirley', 'sheep', 'who', 'will', 'eat', 'anything', 'run', 'money', 'goat', 'loose', 'usual', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'Fleeced', 'shearing', 'day', 'Shaun', 'sheep', 'are', 'determined', 'not', 'have', 'wool', 'taken', 'make', 'escape', 'town', 'try', 'go', 'incognito', 'fashion', 'Shaun', 'Shoots', 'Sheep', 'Shaun', 'camera', 'photographer', 'However', 'Blitzer', 'Pigs', 'want', 'camera', 'too', 'Out', 'Molehills', 'sheep', 'dance', 'interrupted', 'unruly', 'mole', 'flock', 'increasingly', 'extreme', 'measures', 'rid', 'farm', 'troublesome', 'mole', 'presence.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'extras', 'BAA', 'five', 'minute', 'featurette', 'Meet', 'Animals', 'art', 'department', 'show', 'several', 'school', 'children', 'talking', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'trailers', 'two', 'Aardman-related', 'video', 'games', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'SHEEP', 'WALLACE', 'AND', 'GROMIT', 'GRAND', 'ADVENTURES', 'also', 'trailers', 'few', 'Lionsgate', 'films.I', 'really', 'liked', 'BAA', 'find', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'humor', 'franchises', 'similar', 'However', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'essentially', 'buddy', 'story', 'whereas', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'focuses', 'Shaun', 'crazy', 'family', 'animals', 'with.You', 'can', 'find', 'episodes', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'SHEEP', 'BAA', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'SHEEP', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'BAA', 'was', 'released', 'complete', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'said', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'show', 'BAA', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'DVD', 'rent', 'buy', 'see', 'liked', 'concept']",N/A
