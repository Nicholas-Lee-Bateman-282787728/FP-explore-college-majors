The only reason I no longer watch it on Adult Swim is because I am unable to stay up long enough to watch it and I drink an entire pot of coffee on Saturdays. The animation is superb, it has a great story of love, reincarnation, magic, and fantasy. The villain is almost pure evil, yet also complex and tragic. Character development is done very well. Fight sequences are awesome, especially once Inuyasha unlocks a new power for Tetsuiga.",5,This is my review from TV.com,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,458,"['love', 'anime', 'only', 'reason', 'no', 'longer', 'watch', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'am', 'unable', 'stay', 'up', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'drink', 'entire', 'pot', 'coffee', 'Saturdays', 'animation', 'superb', 'great', 'story', 'love', 'reincarnation', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'villain', 'almost', 'pure', 'evil', 'yet', 'also', 'complex', 'tragic', 'Character', 'development', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'Fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'awesome', 'especially', 'once', 'Inuyasha', 'new', 'power', 'Tetsuiga']",N/A

It's great that it will be $20, but if anybody has watched InuYasha on Neon Alley, Hulu, or Toonami, the opening song has been changed, possibly due to no longer having the license to the original song. It's obvious the opening song won't be in the re-released InuYasha. Hopefully it will still be a box set and not a standard DVD case.",3,My thoughts on the re-release,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,415,"['big', 'waste', 'time', 'considering', 'seasons', 'are', 'still', 'available', 'great', 'will', 'be', '20', 'anybody', 'watched', 'InuYasha', 'Neon', 'Alley', 'Hulu', 'Toonami', 'opening', 'song', 'been', 'changed', 'possibly', 'due', 'longer', 'having', 'license', 'original', 'song', 'obvious', 'opening', 'song', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 're-released', 'InuYasha', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case']",N/A

While the original release was in digipack form, this release is just a regular DVD case, with 5 discs. They're the same ones from the original, but most likely with redressed disc art and the cover is the same as the original release. The discs, as a result of being the same as the originals, have both the dub & the Japanese audio, with English subtitles, so no one has to worry about that. Having said features, the episodes are also uncut & untouched, minus English credits, but those are forgivable. It's a shame the quality couldn't be a little better, considering when they were released, but it's still good. I wish it came with a slip cover, but it's still a good presentation as is. I'd definitely recommend this to those, who like me, didn't get the original sets & can't afford them now that they're out of print & upped in price. Don't worry, you're getting a good set for a good deal here.",5,Inuyasha Re-release DVD Set (Season 1),1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1025,"['Trust', 'when', 'say', 'set', 'lot', 'definitely', 'great', 're-released', 'version', 'original', 'DVD', 'set', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'digipack', 'form', 'release', 'just', 'regular', 'DVD', 'case', '5', 'discs', ""'re"", 'same', 'ones', 'original', 'most', 'likely', 'redressed', 'disc', 'art', 'cover', 'same', 'original', 'release', 'discs', 'result', 'being', 'same', 'originals', 'have', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'English', 'subtitles', 'one', 'worry', 'Having', 'said', 'features', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'uncut', 'untouched', 'English', 'credits', 'are', 'forgivable', 'shame', 'quality', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'little', 'better', 'considering', 'when', 'were', 'released', 'still', 'good', 'wish', 'came', 'slip', 'cover', 'still', 'good', 'presentation', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'original', 'sets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'now', ""'re"", 'print', 'upped', 'price', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'re"", 'getting', 'good', 'set', 'good', 'deal', 'here']",N/A
