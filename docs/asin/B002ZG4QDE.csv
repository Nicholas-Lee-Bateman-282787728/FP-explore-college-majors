I have seen Shaun the Sheep a few times as short skits on the Disney channel, but I didn't think much of it. When I watched this DVD, I laughed, laughed, and laughed some more! It is adorable and even though it is claymation and doesn't use spoken words. The way those mischievous sheep get into trouble with the dog trying to watch over them, and somehow the farmer never catches them!Shaun the Sheep ""A Woolly Good Time"" is just the newest video featuring those crazy sheep and it is 40 minutes of laughs, and I don't usually like slapstick humor. I was really surprised too that my 3-year old liked it, as he usually only likes cartoon but even he was laughing when the sheep were sneaking around! I can still picture those crazy sheep with the farmers clothes on their heads! I would definitely recommend it for all ages, not just kids!I was given a this DVD to review. This review is 100% my opinion and has not been edited or reviewed by anyone.",5,Loved it!,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,1085,"['Honestly', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'am', 'sure', 'glad', 'creators', 'came', 'out', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'have', 'seen', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'few', 'times', 'short', 'skits', 'Disney', 'channel', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'When', 'watched', 'DVD', 'laughed', 'laughed', 'laughed', 'more', 'adorable', 'even', 'claymation', ""n't"", 'use', 'spoken', 'words', 'way', 'mischievous', 'sheep', 'get', 'trouble', 'dog', 'trying', 'watch', 'somehow', 'farmer', 'never', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'A', 'Woolly', 'Good', 'Time', 'just', 'newest', 'video', 'featuring', 'crazy', 'sheep', '40', 'minutes', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'too', '3-year', 'old', 'liked', 'usually', 'only', 'cartoon', 'even', 'was', 'laughing', 'when', 'sheep', 'were', 'sneaking', 'around', 'can', 'still', 'picture', 'crazy', 'sheep', 'farmers', 'clothes', 'heads', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'ages', 'not', 'just', 'kids', 'was', 'given', 'DVD', 'review', 'review', '100', '%', 'opinion', 'not', 'been', 'edited', 'reviewed', 'anyone']",Shaun: Woolly Good Time

We were all disappointed to find that the pigs aren't in this episode at all, contrary to both the cover and cover description. The Wallace and Grommit shorts (Wrong Trousers, A Fine Day Out, Close Shave) are perfect for the whole family, but the Shauns and their nonverbal slapstick humor appeal more to my children, not so much the parents. If this is your first Shaun, go for Off the Baa rather than this one.",3,No pigs,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,500,"['cute', 'video', '5', 'y/o', 'wanted', 'specifically', 'pigs', 'cover', 'were', 'all', 'disappointed', 'find', 'pigs', 'are', ""n't"", 'episode', 'contrary', 'cover', 'cover', 'description', 'Wallace', 'Grommit', 'shorts', 'Wrong', 'Trousers', 'Fine', 'Day', 'Out', 'Close', 'Shave', 'are', 'perfect', 'whole', 'family', 'Shauns', 'nonverbal', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'appeal', 'more', 'children', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'parents', 'first', 'Shaun', 'go', 'Off', 'Baa', 'rather', 'one']",Shaun: Woolly Good Time
