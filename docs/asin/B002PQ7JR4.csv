If you're considering it and are a fan of intelligently-written comedy acted by the best actors out there then you've come to the right place. Everyone here is top-shelf from the writer, actors and technical staff. These folks make it look easy, which good comedy is NOT. My favorite character is Reverend Jim. The writing for him is so wonderful and Christopher Lloyd is pitch-perfect in the part. His first full episode as a series regular is one of the funniest episodes EVER aired from ANY series.Be warned, some (most?) of the episodes have been edited (I suspect the masters used for these DVDs were the trimmed, syndication versions), but until we get them all complete & uncut on Blu-ray someday (pray for it, but don't hold your breath), this is what we've got to work with. Better than nothing. Audio & Video are OK, but nothing spectacular. Complete set has no special packaging; just the individual season boxes shrink-wrapped into one bundle. VERY lame.
