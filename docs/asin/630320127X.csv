362545,A1PASRZ81DY9C,630320127X,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 7/08Rate: 27/08: It's nice to see The Wild Bunch to get blatantly disrespected when Bad Girls was made. The story is almost the same as the Western legend, and some of the camera work smacks of Peckinpah's distinctive style. I like the casting of the two of four prostitutes in Bad Girls: Madeleine Stowe and Andie MacDowell. I am not so sure about Mary Stuart Masterson, but I think she did fine. The only one I hated the most is Drew Barrymore who keeps pulling this Michelle Rodriguez crap the entire film. I can't stand her looks. Why not get Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio instead? I am okay with Susan Sarandon but definitely not Rene Russo. The biggest problem with Bad Girls is how poorly scripted the film is. It's just a lame Western that is too unbelievable to watch. Permitting Dermot Mulroney and James LeGros to star in Bad Girls is atrocious enough. Robert Loggia doesn't get magnified enough, and he should have been the main villain of the picture. When the action happens, I see 80% of it while 20% is lost, or sometimes it is 20% and 80%. Some of them, especially the last shootout, are lame, thus making Bad Girls a corny flick to watch. As I mention rip-offs from The Wild Bunch, there are bits of Sergio Leone from time to time. I have a hard time believing four prostitutes of the Old West are this good looking; worse than that, they don't look believable as slatterns. Ditto big time for Andie MacDowell. Jeez, she looks like a Sunday schoolteacher at best. Why is that seemly promising films involving Madeleine Stowe always fall apart? All in all, Bad Girls is uh...a female version of the Old West, not that kind I want to endure. One more time: bad...girls....*shuddering*.",1,Ugh!

362550,AUDIJM3VUULS7,630320127X,Charles Tatum,"[4, 7]","Is this country so starved for a decent western that we have to sit through this steaming cow patty to find it?  In the first few minutes, four prostitutes leave town in a frenzy after one of them kills another's client in hooker defense.  I don't have any character names, because this all happens in the first ten minutes without any background to who the characters are or their relationships to each other.The women escape and go for a pie in the sky dream of running a lumber mill in Oregon.  Enter James Russo, Madeleine Stowe's former beau and current outlaw.  He takes all of Stowe's hard earned money.  She works hard for her money...so hard for it, honey...  Dermot Mulroney of the ""Young Guns"" series happens by to flirt with the ladies while seeking his own revenge.  The rest of the film consists of at least three of our five heroes getting capture and disappearing, then the others riding to rescue them.  Three times...they shouldn't have quit their night jobs.The four leads are pretty and beautiful and buxom and nothing like the Old West's real soiled doves.  The quartet could have stepped off a Ralph Lauren fashion runway.  For a more realistic portrayal, try either ""Unforgiven"" or stupidly titled ""The Wicked Wicked West"" with Kelly McGillis and Brenda Fricker.You know the routine in this kind of film, the bad guys lose, the good girls (or is it bad girls?) win.  Director Kaplan apes the late great Sam Peckinpah, throwing in slow motion scenes.  Unlike Sam, Kaplan uses slow motion for no motivation or reason, just to do it.Except for Mulroney and James LeGros, all the men here are pigs who are just holding these poor women down.  A great feminist statement that is ironic in a film that dumped its first female director in favor of Kaplan, who decides we cannot get through the film without a couple of glimpses of Drew Barrymore topless.

This one is a bit of a different sort of western, however.  We get to see Madeline Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson AND Andie McDowell all in one film!  I've never cared much for Drew Barrymore, but I concede she does a pretty good job in this movie.Madeline Stowe still looks good today, but this movie was made in 1993, when she was @ the very apex of her beauty.  On top of being gorgeous & having a ""mystery"" about her (which intoxicates me so!) she is also a bona-fide accomplished actress.  It's great to see her go from a naieve woman in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS to being a tough-as-nails, no nonsense cowgirl in the present flick.  She is a much more diverse actress than most women in Hollywood.  Now if only she'd agree to a candlelight dinner with me.....Anyway, this DVD has often been thought of as a female version of YOUNG GUNS.  Well, perhaps.  However, in my mind, BAD GIRLS is the far more entertaining of the two (I found YOUNG GUNS rather boring).  Also, one nice thing about the film is that it is NOT a film that's just set about to glorify male-bashing. While it does set about to accurately depict examples of unfair treatment of 19th century women, it never becomes ""preachy.""  Moreover, our cowgirls stumble across some nice fellas who help them out.If you like westerns, you may or may not like this one.  If you like un-conventional westerns where the main characters are pretty girls (not too many other movies can compete in this category), then this movie is a must.

Like Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Bad Girls begins with the abuse of a prostitute whose vengeance sets the whole plot in motion. But in Bad Girls, plot development is synonymous with costume changes. Chaps, corsets, silks and flannel -- for women on the run who carry no baggage other than their historical baggage as former prostitutes, these four desperadoes scam more new outfits than a bevy of runway models. And at least one of them had to be packing a curling iron. But, okay, this is Hollywood after all, and what's the point of having four women starring in a movie if they don't at least look good, albeit illogical.The really grievous problems with Bad Girls are its lack of plot and undeveloped characters. On the lam after the most trigger-happy of the bunch, Madeleine Stowe, kills a customer who's roughing up one of the other girls in the brothel, they have very little sense of purpose once they're on their own. With a vague plan of heading toward the Oregon Territory to run a sawmill, Bad Girls moves forward in episodic fashion as they encounter one difficulty (or love interest) after another. You can practically picture it as a weekly TV series that poses hour-long detours on the road to the elusive Oregon Territory. The barrenness of the plot would be less noticeable; however, if there were at least some solid characters to hang the story on. Stowe nicely plays the sternness of her character against the delicacy of her features but even her tough-gal posture is belittled when she is whipped by one man and rescued by another. Masterson, considering her range as an actress of intelligence and physical dexterity, is given surprisingly little to do. As for the others, MacDowell flirts and Barrymore pouts, though each does what she does very well.The Cinematography is respectable, as is the directing for what the shooting schedule allowed. Not an extraordinary film, but one that entertains on one level. That and the sexual component really didn't need the exposure it received in this film. In other words it couldve been handled more tastefully, or axed altogether.",3,This movie could of been way better.,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,2182,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'couple', 'times', 'years', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Unforgiven', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'abuse', 'prostitute', 'vengeance', 'whole', 'plot', 'motion', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'plot', 'development', 'synonymous', 'costume', 'changes', 'Chaps', 'corsets', 'silks', 'flannel', 'women', 'run', 'who', 'carry', 'baggage', 'other', 'historical', 'baggage', 'former', 'prostitutes', 'four', 'desperadoes', 'scam', 'more', 'new', 'outfits', 'bevy', 'runway', 'models', 'least', 'one', 'had', 'be', 'packing', 'curling', 'iron', 'okay', 'Hollywood', 'what', 'point', 'having', 'four', 'women', 'starring', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'look', 'good', 'illogical.The', 'really', 'grievous', 'problems', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'are', 'lack', 'plot', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'lam', 'most', 'trigger-happy', 'bunch', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'customer', 'who', 'roughing', 'up', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'brothel', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'purpose', ""'re"", 'own', 'vague', 'plan', 'heading', 'Oregon', 'Territory', 'run', 'sawmill', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'forward', 'episodic', 'fashion', 'encounter', 'one', 'difficulty', 'love', 'interest', 'can', 'practically', 'picture', 'weekly', 'TV', 'series', 'hour-long', 'detours', 'road', 'elusive', 'Oregon', 'Territory', 'barrenness', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'noticeable', 'however', 'were', 'least', 'solid', 'characters', 'hang', 'story', 'Stowe', 'nicely', 'sternness', 'character', 'delicacy', 'features', 'even', 'tough-gal', 'posture', 'belittled', 'when', 'whipped', 'one', 'man', 'rescued', 'Masterson', 'considering', 'range', 'actress', 'intelligence', 'physical', 'dexterity', 'given', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'do', 'others', 'MacDowell', 'flirts', 'Barrymore', 'pouts', 'what', 'very', 'well.The', 'Cinematography', 'respectable', 'directing', 'what', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'allowed', 'Not', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'one', 'one', 'level', 'sexual', 'component', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'exposure', 'received', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'couldve', 'been', 'handled', 'more', 'tastefully', 'axed', 'altogether']",N/A
