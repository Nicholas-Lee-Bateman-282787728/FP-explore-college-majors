The usual comedy criminals are then persued  by the oddly paired cops.I'm far from being a Puritan and like some funny or serious well placed foul mouths now and again, but The Heat's dialogue seemed written by a teenager on steroids. The vulgarity was forced beyond belief. McCathy comes across more like a pathetic, angry and unstable woman then a street wise cop. She's very annoying with zero humor. Bullock had her part down pat, too bad the flawed comedic partnering and drivel of a story sunk it for her.Comedies take all kinds of liberties with real life scenarios for sure, but the way McCarthy acted in the police station house was so far fetched that Oz was a more likely setting. What really amazes is that this type of garbage comedy is given four and five stars. McCarthy should head back to some run of the mill bar and foist her raunchy comedy routine on those prepared for amateur night.

McCarthy plays a street wise, loud, foul mouthed cop whose reputation is anything but stellar although she does her job and does it well. Sandra is an arrogant FBI agent that knows her job and does it well but also seems to have a less than stellar reputation. So neither woman is liked by their co workers although both get the job done. Put them together and you have a time bomb waiting to happen. And it does as both are determined to take down a narcotics drug lord but their methods often conflict until they decide to work together instead of fighting each other. Turns out both women are lonely and a bit pathetic in their own way, no matter their back ground, and both have more in common with each other than they realize or want to know. Bullock and McCarthy were much better suited as partners than Bullock and her last partner in Miss Congeniality 2.

1665471,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00E8RK5OC,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","Ah, the buddy cop movie. Such a fun and familiar genre from when I was growing up amidst the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"" and it's ilk. It's not seen as much anymore, and when this type of movies does come around these days, it never holds a candle to the movies they are emulating. While ""The Heat"" doesn't ascend to the heady highs of the genre at it's best or comes close to classics in the category, it's still the best of it's kind I've seen in a very, very long time.Sandra Bullock (seriously, does this woman ever age? She's as beautiful now as ever) stars as Special Agent Sarah Ashburn, a super smart agent that none of the other agents like. When she is put on the case of a dangerous drug lord in Boston, she unwillingly meets up with street-wise, bullying, harsh, and potty mouthed Detective Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy, the new queen of comedy). This odd couple are soon at each other's throats as they both try to adhere to the different working skills of one another and to get this dangerous criminal off the streets.""The Heat"" is a action/comedy and it makes no bones about it. It knows what it is and sets out to satisfy the needs of the audience looking for such a thing. Nothing more. Nothing less. Sometimes, that's just all we need. Even though we don't usually see two female leads in such a movie, the movie is still not ground breaking or revolutionary. It doesn't re-invent the wheel and simply doesn't care too. It's here to be funny and entertaining and it accomplishes just that. The pairing of Bullock and McCarthy is a stroke of genius. They are a great pair together with a lot of chemistry and on screen appeal working with one another. The character of Sarah Ashburn should be right at home with Bullock and her fans, if the violent and profanity laced movie itself isn't. Still, it's a nice change of pace for her. McCarthy, coming hot off the heels of the mega success of ""Identity Thief"", is a force to be reckoned with. This seems to fall well into her type of comedy here lately, and there is nobody else like her currently working in this genre of comedy. As I mentioned earlier, she is certainly the new reigning queen of comedy. There are also more familiar faces here that include Jane Curtin (""Saturday Night Live"", ""Kate & Allie"", ""3rd Rock From The Sun""), Thomas F. Wilson (""Back To The Future""), Marlon Wayans, Michael Rapaport and even New Kids On The Block singer Joey McIntyre as one of McCarthy's brothers.Director Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"") moves things along at a pretty brisk pace, but the movie does start to feel a little long and sluggish towards the end, and the amusement of the F-bomb being dropped all the time does get a bit old after a while as well. Still, these aren't much in the way of complaints that ruin the simple fun of a popcorn movie like this. If this were to turn into a new buddy/action franchise, I certainly wouldn't say no to a The Heat 2.",4,"Funny Cop, Funnier Cop",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2920,"['Ah', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'fun', 'familiar', 'genre', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'likes', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'ilk', 'not', 'seen', 'much', 'anymore', 'when', 'type', 'movies', 'come', 'days', 'never', 'candle', 'movies', 'are', 'emulating', 'Heat', ""n't"", 'ascend', 'heady', 'highs', 'genre', 'best', 'close', 'classics', 'category', 'still', 'best', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'seriously', 'woman', 'ever', 'age', 'beautiful', 'now', 'ever', 'stars', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Sarah', 'Ashburn', 'super', 'smart', 'agent', 'none', 'other', 'agents', 'When', 'put', 'case', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'lord', 'Boston', 'unwillingly', 'up', 'street-wise', 'bullying', 'harsh', 'potty', 'mouthed', 'Detective', 'Shannon', 'Mullins', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'new', 'queen', 'comedy', 'odd', 'couple', 'are', 'soon', 'other', 'throats', 'try', 'adhere', 'different', 'working', 'skills', 'one', 'get', 'dangerous', 'criminal', 'streets', 'Heat', 'action/comedy', 'bones', 'what', 'out', 'satisfy', 'needs', 'audience', 'looking', 'thing', 'Nothing', 'more', 'Nothing', 'less', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'see', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'such', 'movie', 'movie', 'still', 'not', 'ground', 'breaking', 'revolutionary', ""n't"", 're-invent', 'wheel', 'simply', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'here', 'be', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'just', 'pairing', 'Bullock', 'McCarthy', 'stroke', 'genius', 'are', 'great', 'pair', 'together', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'appeal', 'working', 'one', 'character', 'Sarah', 'Ashburn', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'home', 'Bullock', 'fans', 'violent', 'profanity', 'laced', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Still', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'McCarthy', 'coming', 'hot', 'heels', 'mega', 'success', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'fall', 'well', 'type', 'comedy', 'here', 'lately', 'nobody', 'else', 'currently', 'working', 'genre', 'comedy', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'certainly', 'new', 'reigning', 'queen', 'comedy', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'familiar', 'here', 'include', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Kate', 'Allie', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Thomas', 'F.', 'Wilson', 'Back', 'Future', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'even', 'New', 'Kids', 'Block', 'singer', 'Joey', 'McIntyre', 'one', 'McCarthy', 'brothers.Director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'Bridesmaids', 'things', 'along', 'pretty', 'brisk', 'pace', 'movie', 'start', 'feel', 'little', 'long', 'sluggish', 'towards', 'end', 'amusement', 'F-bomb', 'being', 'dropped', 'time', 'get', 'bit', 'old', 'while', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'complaints', 'ruin', 'simple', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'were', 'turn', 'new', 'buddy/action', 'franchise', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Heat', '2']",N/A

This was similar to the role Bullock played in MISS CONGENIALITY but that was a much better role for her (as an FBI agent who had to pose as a beauty contestant). Bullock never does a bad job in anything but her main job here is to be the uptight partner who gradually loosens up under McCarthy's influence. Bullock is FBI and McCarthy is Boston PD. The same director who did BRIDESMAIDS, which was a big hit for McCarthy, is on this film and he is very well attuned to McCarthy's very physical humor. He seems out of synch with Bullock though and doesn't seem to know how to use her talent best. As a female buddy cop film it is ok but if you want to see Bullock, a very talented actress, in something much better, watch MISS CONGENIALITY instead. This is nothing very different for McCarthy. She has a comedy shtick which she stays within and in that narrow range she is a funny comic.

My sister raved about it - so obviously people out there ARE finding it funny....i'm just not sure why.Maybe it's me.

Sandra Bullock plays Ashburn, a straight-laced CIA agent who is trying to get a promotion and Melissa McCarthy plays Mullins, a really foul-mouthed drug enforcement detective with street smarts and a familiarity with the neighborhood in question. They are brought together to take a down a mysterious drug kingpin and of course they are like oil and water.As you can gather, all of it sounds to be pretty clich&eacute; and done before and to an extent it is. It's a typical buddy cop movie with a pretty predictable plotline. What &#34;The Heat&#34; does bring though, is a barrage of hilarity that will have you in stitches. If anybody tells you that &#34;The Heat&#34; isn't funny, they're wrong or are offended by foul language. Sure, there is a lot of foul language, most of it from McCarthy as Bullock's character is the exact opposite. Most of the comedy is one note, insult comic type stuff, but the way McCarthy zings them one after the other and seems to always have another one loaded up, is comic greatness. Not to say that there isn't plenty of great physical comedy as well.The movie gets distracted pretty frequently from its storyline just to deliver some comedic moments. This was a double-edged sword as the screenplay went off to unimportant places to deliver some pretty effective laughs, but what suffered was a pretty good crime storyline that could have been much better than what it was. There's a pretty ruthless drug kingpin who is whacking people in some pretty gruesome ways. Maybe it's just me, but I wanted the movie to deliver comedy and thrills. Yet, the balance of comedy and thrills was way off kilter.Maybe the comedy would have suffered if they had explored the actual crime the women were investigating a little more thoroughly, but there was plenty of comedy to spare. The comedy was plenty dirty, but the detective suspense work needed to be way dirtier. I gather that people who appreciated &#34;Bridesmaids&#34; or came to see &#34;The Heat&#34; in order to get a good laugh will certainly get what they paid for. Although those of us that like our movies a little more deep, challenging and complex will only be able to imagine a better movie.",4,Those who like a little ACTION in their Action/Comedy... may not like,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2408,"['34', 'Heat', '34', 'far', 'stretch', '34', 'Bridesmaids', '34', 'smash', 'hit', 'comedy', 'director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'surprised', 'everybody', '2011', 'same', 'elements', 'made', 'comedy', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'certainly', 'utilized', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ashburn', 'straight-laced', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'promotion', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Mullins', 'really', 'foul-mouthed', 'drug', 'enforcement', 'detective', 'street', 'smarts', 'familiarity', 'neighborhood', 'question', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'take', 'down', 'mysterious', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'course', 'are', 'like', 'oil', 'water.As', 'can', 'gather', 'be', 'pretty', 'clich', 'eacute', 'done', 'before', 'extent', 'typical', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'plotline', 'What', '34', 'Heat', '34', 'bring', 'barrage', 'hilarity', 'will', 'have', 'stitches', 'anybody', '34', 'Heat', '34', ""n't"", 'funny', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'are', 'offended', 'foul', 'language', 'Sure', 'lot', 'foul', 'language', 'most', 'McCarthy', 'Bullock', 'character', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Most', 'comedy', 'one', 'note', 'insult', 'comic', 'type', 'stuff', 'way', 'McCarthy', 'one', 'other', 'always', 'have', 'one', 'loaded', 'up', 'comic', 'greatness', 'Not', 'say', ""n't"", 'plenty', 'great', 'physical', 'comedy', 'well.The', 'movie', 'distracted', 'pretty', 'frequently', 'storyline', 'just', 'deliver', 'comedic', 'moments', 'was', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'screenplay', 'went', 'unimportant', 'places', 'deliver', 'pretty', 'effective', 'laughs', 'what', 'suffered', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'crime', 'storyline', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'pretty', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'who', 'whacking', 'people', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'movie', 'deliver', 'comedy', 'thrills', 'balance', 'comedy', 'thrills', 'was', 'way', 'comedy', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'had', 'explored', 'actual', 'crime', 'women', 'were', 'investigating', 'little', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'there', 'was', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'spare', 'comedy', 'was', 'plenty', 'dirty', 'detective', 'suspense', 'work', 'needed', 'be', 'way', 'dirtier', 'gather', 'people', 'who', 'appreciated', '34', 'Bridesmaids', '34', 'came', 'see', '34', 'Heat', '34', 'order', 'get', 'good', 'laugh', 'will', 'certainly', 'get', 'what', 'paid', 'movies', 'little', 'more', 'deep', 'challenging', 'complex', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'imagine', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

I think Melissa McCarthy is a real talent (though I thought her turn as Suki St. James on Gilmore Girls was a subtler, more amusing performance than the broad slapstick she's become famous for) and in the right vehicle Sandra Bullock can be tolerable.  Add to this the fact that the director is Paul Feig, the man behind Bridesmaids and, more notably, the venerable Freaks and Geeks. Mix all these elements together into a buddy cop comedy, and you should have a winner. Or at least not a loser.Instead this is one of the unfunniest, most tone-deaf films I've seen in recent years, which is really saying something. There are no actual jokes in the movie: all of the &#34;humor&#34; is derived from McCarthy doing physical slapstick which seems more in line with last minute SNL filler than a major motion picture. And Bullock is simply awful. I don't think she knows what movie she's in.But that's not all her fault. The script is a disaster. It's so poorly set-up that the even the simple &#34;cop who plays by the book paired with one who breaks all the rules&#34; isn't established properly, instead Bullock's character is a field agent that's somehow both incredibly good at her job but also completely clueless about it, while McCarthy is a bull in a china shop who's also an undercover master. None of the elements mesh, or even make sense, so without a firm basis to launch the &#34;plot&#34; from (a disaster of episodic tedium that I won't even touch on) you are never engaged in what's happening, just waiting for another &#34;joke&#34; about balls.Another thing that bears mentioning is that in lieu of any actual humor, there is a really startling amount of violence in the film. Head shots complete with blood spray, photographs of completely dismembered bodies, stabbings, it's completely out of joint with the &#34;humorous&#34; tone of the film.A far better example of a really funny, but action-packed buddy-cop film would be Jonah Hill's recent 21 Jump Street remake. And I'm fully aware of how baffling it is to say that Jonah Hill had a more sophisticated, ironic take on the genre. Yes, that film has some violence, but it is far more in keeping with the tone of the film (with one notably sophomoric exception). Plus it's FUNNY. And going into both films, I would have expected Feig and McCarthy to deliver more good-natured laughs than someone out of the Apatow Arrested Adolescent Brigade.Imagine my surprise.",1,Totally baffling how such talented people made such an awful movie.,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,2457,"['real', 'disappointment', 'think', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'real', 'talent', 'thought', 'turn', 'Suki', 'St.', 'James', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', 'subtler', 'more', 'amusing', 'performance', 'broad', 'slapstick', 'become', 'famous', 'right', 'vehicle', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'can', 'be', 'tolerable', 'Add', 'fact', 'director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'man', 'Bridesmaids', 'more', 'notably', 'venerable', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'Mix', 'elements', 'together', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'should', 'have', 'winner', 'least', 'not', 'loser.Instead', 'one', 'unfunniest', 'most', 'tone-deaf', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'are', 'actual', 'jokes', 'movie', '34', 'humor', '34', 'derived', 'McCarthy', 'doing', 'physical', 'slapstick', 'more', 'line', 'last', 'minute', 'SNL', 'filler', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Bullock', 'simply', 'awful', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'in.But', 'not', 'fault', 'script', 'disaster', 'so', 'poorly', 'set-up', 'even', 'simple', '34', 'cop', 'who', 'plays', 'book', 'paired', 'one', 'who', 'rules', '34', ""n't"", 'established', 'properly', 'instead', 'Bullock', 'character', 'field', 'agent', 'somehow', 'incredibly', 'good', 'job', 'also', 'completely', 'clueless', 'McCarthy', 'bull', 'china', 'shop', 'who', 'also', 'undercover', 'master', 'None', 'elements', 'mesh', 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'so', 'firm', 'basis', 'launch', '34', 'plot', '34', 'disaster', 'episodic', 'tedium', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'are', 'never', 'engaged', 'what', 'happening', 'just', 'waiting', '34', 'joke', '34', 'balls.Another', 'thing', 'mentioning', 'lieu', 'actual', 'humor', 'really', 'startling', 'amount', 'violence', 'film', 'Head', 'shots', 'complete', 'blood', 'spray', 'photographs', 'completely', 'dismembered', 'bodies', 'stabbings', 'completely', 'joint', '34', 'humorous', '34', 'tone', 'film.A', 'far', 'better', 'example', 'really', 'funny', 'action-packed', 'buddy-cop', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'recent', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'remake', ""'m"", 'fully', 'aware', 'how', 'baffling', 'say', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'had', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'ironic', 'take', 'genre', 'Yes', 'film', 'violence', 'far', 'more', 'keeping', 'tone', 'film', 'one', 'notably', 'sophomoric', 'exception', 'FUNNY', 'going', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Feig', 'McCarthy', 'deliver', 'more', 'good-natured', 'laughs', 'someone', 'Apatow', 'Arrested', 'Adolescent', 'Brigade.Imagine', 'surprise']",N/A

1665602,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00E8RK5OC,Darren,"[2, 3]","Hey, I came in wanting to like this.  The general consensus is that Sandra Bullock is Hollywood's most popular female actor under 50.  She's one of the very few female actors (sadly!) who is enough of a draw to basically ensure a picture gets made and released widely.  My own opinion corresponds with all that:  she has charmed me for two decades with her talent, down-to-earth style, and comic timing.  The tried-and-true story of an uptight FBI agent buddying up with the local slovenly detective sounds like a sure-fire winner, especially when you have Bullock as the FBI agent and Melissa McCarthy as the Boston detective.  Alas, it isn't.The plan seems to have been to not worry about carefully worked-out situations or anything resembling true wit, but rather to just let McCarthy run wild, on the assumption that the humor would therefore take care of itself.  A miscalculation.  McCarthy needs to be reined in carefully -- at least for now, until she learns her comic chops better, and that might require a few more films.  Let's hope this was a learning experience for her.  As one watches this, one gets the feeling that much of the dialogue was improvised.  Bullock is considerably more successful at this sort of thing, having had much more experience.  Example:  there's a scene where Bullock and McCarthy are staking out a nightclub, waiting for a suspect.  The two have been bickering in the car for several minutes, and, when the guy emerges, McCarthy hollers out irritably, ""There's our man!""  To which Bullock replies with a great throwaway line that certainly feels improvised, ""I can see too, you know!"", as they exit their car.  Natural, and keeping ""within the scene"".  McCarthy, on the other hand, relies on trying to shock us with profanity and over-the-top anger.  (HER best lines feel like they were actually written.)I'm not sure why they started with a 70s vibe at the beginning and end credits of the picture; I would have advised not drawing attention to how cliched the ""buddy cops"" picture is by heaping on the nostalgia.  On the positive side, the great stand-up comedian Bill Burr, who plays one of McCarthy's obnoxious Southie brothers, proves he can act naturally, and whoever played the albino DEA agent was quite funny -- the movie could have used a lot more of him.  2 out of 5, the second star assigned out of goodwill towards Bullock.",2,Surprisingly bad,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,2376,"['Hey', 'came', 'wanting', 'like', 'general', 'consensus', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'popular', 'female', 'actor', '50', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'female', 'actors', 'sadly', 'who', 'enough', 'draw', 'basically', 'ensure', 'picture', 'made', 'released', 'widely', 'own', 'opinion', 'corresponds', 'charmed', 'two', 'decades', 'talent', 'down-to-earth', 'style', 'comic', 'timing', 'tried-and-true', 'story', 'uptight', 'FBI', 'agent', 'buddying', 'up', 'local', 'slovenly', 'detective', 'sounds', 'sure-fire', 'winner', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'Bullock', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Boston', 'detective', 'Alas', 'plan', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'worry', 'carefully', 'worked-out', 'situations', 'anything', 'resembling', 'true', 'wit', 'rather', 'just', 'let', 'McCarthy', 'run', 'wild', 'assumption', 'humor', 'would', 'therefore', 'take', 'care', 'miscalculation', 'McCarthy', 'be', 'reined', 'carefully', 'least', 'now', 'comic', 'chops', 'better', 'might', 'require', 'few', 'more', 'films', 'Let', 'hope', 'was', 'learning', 'experience', 'one', 'one', 'feeling', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'improvised', 'Bullock', 'considerably', 'more', 'successful', 'sort', 'thing', 'having', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'experience', 'Example', 'scene', 'where', 'Bullock', 'McCarthy', 'are', 'staking', 'out', 'nightclub', 'waiting', 'suspect', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'bickering', 'car', 'several', 'minutes', 'when', 'guy', 'McCarthy', 'out', 'irritably', 'man', 'Bullock', 'replies', 'great', 'throwaway', 'line', 'certainly', 'feels', 'improvised', 'can', 'see', 'too', 'know', 'exit', 'car', 'Natural', 'keeping', 'scene', 'McCarthy', 'other', 'hand', 'relies', 'trying', 'shock', 'profanity', 'over-the-top', 'anger', 'best', 'lines', 'feel', 'were', 'actually', 'written', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'started', '70s', 'vibe', 'beginning', 'end', 'credits', 'picture', 'would', 'have', 'advised', 'not', 'drawing', 'attention', 'how', 'cliched', 'buddy', 'cops', 'picture', 'heaping', 'nostalgia', 'positive', 'side', 'great', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'Bill', 'Burr', 'who', 'one', 'McCarthy', 'obnoxious', 'Southie', 'brothers', 'can', 'act', 'naturally', 'whoever', 'played', 'albino', 'DEA', 'agent', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'lot', 'more', '2', '5', 'second', 'star', 'assigned', 'goodwill', 'towards', 'Bullock']",N/A

She insisted it was probably almost over so we kept on. 15 minutes later, the end is nowhere in sight, we check the timer and see we've only made it through an hour and 13 minutes of this 2 hour movie. From then on we skipped through another 30 minutes, found that we hadn't missed anything, and watched the end.Here's what happened:The girl that's not sandra bullock made it big with her last movie bridesmaides, which was genuinely funny, and she was a funny person in it, she has a great delivery of funny lines and demeanor. This movie was painfully obviously written to be that, over and over, and over again for 2 hours. It comes off as funny for the first half hour, but then it becomes obvious that that's all they've got. Bullock acting quirky and this other girl acting silly, and that's the act and it keeps it on life support throughout the entire film. Didn't care about what was going on, didn't care about the characters, i had no interest in the outcome, there wasn't any urgency, there wasn't any believable drive, it was all forced. Any possibility of caring about what was going on was completely overshadowed and shoved into the garbage by the god awfully long drawn out scenes of just banter dialogue which had NOTHING to do with anything going on, just them saying or doing things that are supposed to be funny.If you genuinely like this movie, YOU are the problem with hollywood. Garbage like this only exists because enough people somehow get enjoyment out of its boiler plate generic everything, with just a metric ton of quirkiness and overacting akin to a cat finding enjoyment in dangling keys.I'm sorry, i'm sure that was offensive, but this movie really annoyed me with it's blatant worthlessness.Why not 1 star instead of 2?

Everything Melissa McCarthy touches turns to gold.  The result is this ingratiating cop buddy movie.  Bullock plays an uptight Yale educated FBI agent.  McCarthy plays a profane street smart Boston detective.  The obvious and not so obvious sparks fly when these two are bought together to nab an elusive drug dealer.  The central plot is only so-so but as a means to getting these two incredibly talented lasses together it suffices.  Watching Bullock trying to respond to McCarthy's vulgarity laced dialogue is priceless.  Director Paul Feig makes good use of the gritty Beantown locales and stylistically the film is very reminiscent of the great Seventies cop flicks notably the work of Sidney Lumet.

Interestingly, it is not her unapologetically rapacious turn as Megan that serves as the inspiration for McCarthy's role as pugnacious Boston detective Shannon Mullins. I think it's the hilariously crazy rant she unspooled as the mad-as-hell mother in the outtake shown during the end credits of Judd Apatow'sThis Is 40. This sharp comic actress is a master of timing, and her character's nasty-edged tirades produce pure comedy gold. She and Bullock generate real chemistry as a mismatched pair of social misfits who are thrown together to take down a Boston drug lord. As written by Kate Dippold, the film is little different in premise from any other cop-buddy actioner made since48 Hrs.andLethal Weapon. The novelty is that they're women. In that respect, it does resemble a distaff version of the Will Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg 2010 comedy,The Other Guys.Bullock plays straight-arrow FBI agent Sarah Ashburn who is gunning for a promotion based on her enviable track record of captures, but the problem is nobody in her department can stand working with her due to her arrogance. Her boss sends her to Boston to work on the drug case and also her people skills. Mullins is Ashburn's polar opposite, a fear-based cop who knows the neighborhoods that Ashburn desperately needs to search. Just as Ashburn wears no-nonsense pantsuits, Mullins looks like a streetwise biker with her worn Paw Sox T-shirt and fingerless leather gloves. The movie consists mostly of their personal embattlements as each can't stand the other, but hints of mutual respect lurk as Mullins sets up a diversion at a drug supplier's apartment while Ashburn picks up an incriminating cigarette butt. There's also a funny nightclub scene where Mullins cuts up Ashburn's outfit in the restroom to make her look sexy enough to distract a dealer while installing a tracking device into his smartphone. A hilariously executed drunken binge provides just the bonding moment they need to join forces to nab their prey. At the same time, Dippold's screenplay is not without its share of predictable elements.For example, Mullins has a fractious, mouthy family right out ofThe Fighterand a brother who could be a linchpin in the case (shades ofConviction). This gives her character a tether to humanity that appears a bit forced amid all the action. Moreover, after Mullins and Ashburn reach the turning point in their relationship, the plot doesn't seem to matter as much, and the pacing feels uneven. There are a surprising number of grisly moments including ones involving an oyster shucking knife and an unexpected tracheotomy, but these moments appear true to the genre. The 1970's-style credits are a plus as well as the rap-heavy soundtrack coordinated by Mike Andrews. Bullock is really playing another variation ofMiss Congenialityonly much more uptight, and while she does it very well, McCarthy steals almost every scene. Feig has surrounded them with an eclectic supporting cast including Demian Birchir (A Better Life) as Ashburn's patient boss, Tom Wilson as the prematurely aging precinct captain, a surprisingly dapper Marlon Wayans as a fellow FBI agent who has a crush on Ashburn, Jane Curtin in a too-brief role as Mullins' judgmental mother; and MADtv's Michael McDonald and SNL's Taran Killam in unexpected roles.

The funny thing about comedies is that they depend entirely on a viewer's sense of humor.  And whether or not you have a taste for vulgarity camouflaged as comedy.  The script is less concerned with jokes or an interesting premise, than the number of times it can utilize a single expletive.  The story involves a loud mouth detective (Melissa McCarthy) and her unwanted know-it-all partner (Sandra Bullock).  Both characters are obnoxious.  Presumably, that's the main ""joke"" in this formula buddy/cop flick.  They do not get along.  When they're not insulting each other they're insulting everyone around them.  McCarthy's role consists entirely of angry tirades.  Just three minutes shy of two hours, this is a lot of hostility to ingest.  To break up the bouts of abject animosity, the filmmakers tossed in a requisite number of maudlin scenes to supposedly balance out all the angry.Normally, I love Sandra Bullock in anything (as for McCarthy, I can't abide her in anything).

Sandra Bullock plays an uptight FBI agent whose abrasive attitude has alienated her colleagues and whose shot at getting the big promotion rests on her ability to successfully complete a drug smuggling case with partner Boston cop Melissa McCarthy, who has her own, um, personality issues.  McCarthy is currently alienated from her working class clan, too because of turning in her brother (Michael Rappaport), as a way to get him help for his drug problems.  (Bullock's own ""family"" consists of a cat who used to belong to her but currently resides (his choice) with a neighbor.)  The duo has the obligatory meet messy when Bullock filches McCarthy's parking spot and then mistakes McCarthy for a perp who's waiting to be interrogated. Neither attempts by their superiors (Thomas Wilson, Marlon Wayans) to mediate nor the stresses of the case itself is enough to make them meld into a seamless team, but it would be a pretty dull movie it was. In the end, of course, they do come to rely on each other and even (gasp) become friends.There's lots of crude dialogue in the movie, but nothing cruder than ""This Is the End,"" or most Hollywood comedies these days.

1665681,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00E8RK5OC,FNDNreview,"[13, 20]","It's been quite some time since we've seen ""Miss Congeniality"" on the big screen.  Since 2009, when she won an Academy Award (Best Actress) and Razzie Award (Worst Actress) in the same year, Sandra Bullock has only been seen on the big screen once - in 2011's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close.  While the A-list star has been away, Melissa McCarthy has reached new career heights of her own, becoming a household name by starring in a prime-time television comedy and in a handful of successful films, including Identity Theft and Bridesmaids.  Now, this highly unlikely pair has teamed-up in the law enforcement comedy, The Heat.Directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids), The Heat stars Sandra Bullock as cocky FBI agent Sarah Ashburn and Melissa McCarthy as vulgar Boston detective Shannon Mullins - both looking to take down the same mobster that's been flooding the streets with drugs.  Even though she's highly disliked by her colleagues, Agent Ashburn is desperate to be promoted, and in order for her to be considered, she must solve the Boston drug case.  At the same time, Detective Mullins has ambitions and methods of her own to keep the streets she lives on clean, so much so that she's even put her own brother, Jason (Michael Rapaport) in jail.  Initially wanting nothing to do with one another, this diverse duo decides to put their differences aside for the greater good - as the shenanigans ensue.  Demi&aacute;n Bichir, Marlon Wayans, and Spoken Reasons also star in supporting roles.The Heat has received quite a bit of attention for its vulgar dialogue, reportedly dropping the ""F-bomb"" an estimated 190 times.  I'm not sure what's more bothersome - the fact that a film needs to use that much vulgarity or the fact that someone actually sat through the film and counted how many times the F-bomb was dropped.  In any event, the language will either:  completely turn you off to the film and it won't bother you one bit.  If you're already a fan of Melissa McCarthy's brand of humor - especially her hilarious improve ability, you should feel free to enjoy this film like you did Bridesmaids.  On the other hand, Sandra Bullock has never been associated with this kind of obscure style of humor (at least not to this degree), often coming off as bland or ironic in films, such as Two Weeks Notice, Miss Congeniality, and The Proposal.Comedy aside, the film's plot is hardly worth the price of admission - often focusing more on the Bullock/McCarthy dynamic than the overall quality of film.  The couple is completely unorthodox and easily comparable to Oscar and Felix from The Odd Couple.  Regardless, these two talented actresses complement each other extremely well, easily setting up the possibility for an endless amount of sequels (though more than one may be unbearable).  At one point in the film, Bullock even goes off-keel, taking of McCarthy's brand of humor by dropping a series of f-bombs of her own while sticking it to her colleagues.  This particular scene happens to be amusing, but several other scenes often suffer from Bullock trying too hard for laughs, leaving a forced feeling - including a bathroom scene (which was heavily promoted in the movie trailer) and a scene where she is pointlessly stabbed in the leg, which served very little purpose other than to contribute to an uneventful climax.Surprisingly, there's not a whole lot going on in this film that's worth elaborating upon as far as the rest of the cast goes.  It's a main character driven film with a supporting cast that neither helps nor hurts the film, and that includes the normally derogatory Marlon Wayans - who plays a serious character that is completely unlike anything he's ever done before.  Perhaps the lack of character depth is one of the many reasons that the film's voids were filled with the cheap abundance of vulgarity and randomness.  Although, the insulting ""bull in a China shop"" references that are directed at McCarthy's character never lose their amusement.From beginning to end, this is a comedy through and through.  It barely turns serious for more than one brief scene in the entire film, which isn't necessarily as problematic as it may seem.  The only real question is:  how will Sandra Bullock fans take this film?  Truth be told, The Heat might just be enough to traumatize her diehard devotees - but for film-goers that don't particularly care for her films (present company included), you might just want to give her another chance with her future endeavors.  Still, this is a Melissa McCarthy film, as she dominates the comedy and continues to earn herself a high amount of praise as one of the funniest leading ladies in all of Hollywood.  While Bullock's days as an A-list actress appear to be numbered, Melissa McCarthy's popularity will no doubt continue to soar far beyond its current levels.  Is she the next mega-star of Hollywood?  The signs say yes, but only time will tell.Grade: C+FNDNreview.com",3,"The new odd couple of comedy, Sandra Bullock & Melissa McCarty, star in 'The Heat'",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,4943,"['been',

1665798,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00E8RK5OC,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[4, 5]","***This review may contain spoilers**Although as old as a dinosaur fossil, the ""Mismatched Duo (Usually Cops)"" formula almost always promises movie success. Why? Well, there's always someone to relate to and/or make fun of, for one thing, For another thing, it's usually funny when the duo are at first hostile to each other, then stumble hilariously when they try to get along, then finally get their act together when the chips are down. Finally, among the laughs, the formula penetrates into the complicated, sometimes sad private lives of the duo and allows each one to sympathize with and help each others. When you find a formula that works, you stick with it, as they say.So, yeah, yeah, ""The Heat"" is yet another variation on the ""Mismatched/Odd Couple Cops work together to bring down a crime (usually drug) lord"" plot. Ah, but the variation is that both cops are women. In our supposedly gender-enlightened times, that shouldn't come as a surprise, but unfortunately for many, that premise alone is a knee-slapper. On top of that, one law enforcement official is accomplished and disciplined but abrasive and anal-retentive FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) and the other is equally accomplished but disrespectful, profane and uninhibited Detective Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy).Haw, haw, women that act like men. But in reality, ""The Heat"" is an effective comedy/drama not just because of the swear words and the infighting and flamboyant but vicious drug dealers. ""The Heat"" works because it showcases two women -two PEOPLE- who are smart, adaptable, experienced, and good at their jobs but also appealing, vulnerable, and, well human who help each other become better people.When FBI Agent Ashburn, spurred by the promotion her New York boss Hale (Demian Bicher) dangles in front of her, arrives in Boston to help capture drug lord Larkin (Taran Killam), she's determined to do it alone, as she always does. Therefore, she at first strongly resists teaming up with the frumpy, kinda slobby Detective Mullins, even though she has intimate Boston street smarts. But when Ashburn's uptight, by-the-book demeanor threatens to get in the way of the investigation, especially when trying to infiltrate a drug dealer's night club, Mullins steps in to help her let her hair (and her clothing) down so she doesn't give away the game. Later on, learning about Ashburn's lonely, nerdy childhood (from a yearbook), Mullins softens her rough disposition and starts befriending her.In turn, Ashburn learns about Mullins family pariah status due to her arresting her brother Jason (Michael Rappaport) for drug possession. Ashburn is also introduced to Mullins's rowdy, raucous, uncultured clan, headed by Mrs. Mullins (Jane Curtain), which reminded me of Micky Ward's (Mark Walburg's) wild South Boston clan in ""The Fighter"". Ashburn helps Mullins seek protection from the dealers after they learn about the Jason/Shannon connection. And Ashburn is there when Jason is wounded by the dealers and ends up in the hospital.So as ""The Heat"" winds its action-stuffed, funny but harrowing and slapsticky way to the Asburn/Mullins/Larkin showdown, it still somehow manages to strike a blow for female (law enforecement) empowerment. Furthermore, it proves that, while Ashburn and Mullins are effective law enforcement officials on their own, once they establish their sisterhood and mutually respectful friendship, become an even more formidable force to be reckoned with. Yep, they continue to do it for themselves.P.S.: ""The Heat"" also demonstrates Hurricane Melissa McCarthy's rising cinematic star, it being another lucrative hit for her after ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Identity Thief"". I just hope that McCarthy does not typecast herself as the wild, raunchy tomboy type, and that she gets involved in projects that showcase her dramatic side.",4,"Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock Strike a Blow for Female Empowerment and Sisterhood in ""The Heat""",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,3852,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers**Although', 'as', 'old', 'dinosaur', 'fossil', 'Mismatched', 'Duo', 'Usually', 'Cops', 'formula', 'almost', 'always', 'movie', 'success', 'Why', 'Well', 'always', 'someone', 'relate', 'and/or', 'make', 'fun', 'one', 'thing', 'thing', 'usually', 'funny', 'when', 'duo', 'are', 'first', 'hostile', 'other', 'then', 'stumble', 'hilariously', 'when', 'try', 'get', 'along', 'then', 'finally', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'Finally', 'laughs', 'formula', 'complicated', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'private', 'lives', 'duo', 'one', 'sympathize', 'help', 'others', 'When', 'find', 'formula', 'stick', 'say.So', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'Heat', 'yet', 'variation', 'Mismatched/Odd', 'Couple', 'Cops', 'work', 'together', 'bring', 'down', 'crime', 'usually', 'drug', 'lord', 'plot', 'Ah', 'variation', 'cops', 'are', 'women', 'supposedly', 'gender-enlightened', 'times', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'premise', 'alone', 'knee-slapper', 'top', 'one', 'law', 'enforcement', 'official', 'accomplished', 'disciplined', 'abrasive', 'anal-retentive', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Sarah', 'Ashburn', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'other', 'equally', 'accomplished', 'disrespectful', 'profane', 'uninhibited', 'Detective', 'Shannon', 'Mullins', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', '.Haw', 'haw', 'women', 'act', 'men', 'reality', 'Heat', 'effective', 'comedy/drama', 'not', 'just', 'swear', 'words', 'infighting', 'flamboyant', 'vicious', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Heat', 'two', 'women', '-two', 'PEOPLE-', 'who', 'are', 'smart', 'adaptable', 'experienced', 'good', 'jobs', 'also', 'appealing', 'vulnerable', 'well', 'human', 'who', 'help', 'other', 'become', 'better', 'people.When', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Ashburn', 'spurred', 'promotion', 'New', 'York', 'boss', 'Hale', 'Demian', 'Bicher', 'front', 'Boston', 'help', 'capture', 'drug', 'lord', 'Larkin', 'Taran', 'Killam', 'determined', 'do', 'alone', 'always', 'Therefore', 'first', 'strongly', 'teaming', 'up', 'frumpy', 'kinda', 'slobby', 'Detective', 'Mullins', 'even', 'intimate', 'Boston', 'street', 'smarts', 'when', 'Ashburn', 'uptight', 'by-the-book', 'demeanor', 'get', 'way', 'investigation', 'especially', 'when', 'trying', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'dealer', 'night', 'club', 'Mullins', 'help', 'let', 'hair', 'clothing', 'down', 'so', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'game', 'Later', 'learning', 'Ashburn', 'lonely', 'nerdy', 'childhood', 'yearbook', 'Mullins', 'rough', 'disposition', 'befriending', 'her.In', 'turn', 'Ashburn', 'Mullins', 'family', 'pariah', 'status', 'due', 'arresting', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'drug', 'possession', 'Ashburn', 'also', 'introduced', 'Mullins', 'rowdy', 'raucous', 'uncultured', 'clan', 'headed', 'Mrs.', 'Mullins', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'reminded', 'Micky', 'Ward', 'Mark', 'Walburg', 'wild', 'South', 'Boston', 'clan', 'Fighter', 'Ashburn', 'Mullins', 'seek', 'protection', 'dealers', 'learn', 'Jason/Shannon', 'connection', 'Ashburn', 'there', 'when', 'Jason', 'wounded', 'dealers', 'up', 'hospital.So', 'Heat', 'action-stuffed', 'funny', 'harrowing', 'slapsticky', 'way', 'Asburn/Mullins/Larkin', 'showdown', 'still', 'manages', 'strike', 'blow', 'female', 'law', 'enforecement', 'empowerment', 'Furthermore', 'Ashburn', 'Mullins', 'are', 'effective', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'own', 'once', 'establish', 'sisterhood', 'mutually', 'respectful', 'friendship', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'formidable', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Yep', 'continue', 'do', 'themselves.P.S', 'Heat', 'also', 'Hurricane', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'rising', 'cinematic', 'star', 'being', 'lucrative', 'hit', 'Bridesmaids', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'just', 'hope', 'McCarthy', 'not', 'typecast', 'wild', 'raunchy', 'tomboy', 'type', 'involved', 'projects', 'showcase', 'dramatic', 'side']",N/A

Sandra Bullock does a much better job, I thought, than Bateman as being the more &#34;straight&#34; half of the couple.  The plot involves Sandra's character, an aspiring FBI agent angling for a promotion, being forced to pair up with a local police woman (yes, that would be McCarthy) to solve a case.  Of course it turns out to be much more complicated than they expected.  And the usual plot of one or two cops confronting all the bad guys and winning, without calling for massive backup, is handled less awkwardly than in many of these stories.It's a nice mixture or pure comedy, the old cop-buddy story this time with two female cops, and action.

But every once in awhile, someone gets it.  Paul Feig, the director of Bridesmaids, is back with a buddy cop movie featuring two of the funniest women alive: Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock.  Now, I wasn't the biggest fan of Bridesmaids, mostly because it was approximately an hour too long.  But The Heat is a much tighter, if more conventional, movie.Bullock plays Special Agent Ashburn, who desperately wants a promotion but first needs to prove that she can play well with others.  McCarthy plays Officer Mullins, a cop from the streets who has no desire to play well with others.  She just wants her neighborhood safe.  Once again, Bullock is relegated to the uptight role, although there are plenty of chances for her to show off her physical comedy chops.  McCarthy is the one allowed to let loose and go crazy with it.  She sells every single second of it.  I've loved McCarthy since she played Sookie St. James on Gilmore Girls, and Mullins is a long way from Stars Hollow.  When McCarthy is on the screen, she owns it.  She might not be able to chase a perp down on foot, but you believe that she has the confidence and authority to get the job done.Okay, one of my favorite things about The Heat is that when Ashburn or Mullins gets hurt then they actually act hurt.  There is no magical recovery from wounds.  My second favorite might be that there's no romantic storyline bogging down the proceedings.  The movie makes it clear that both women can get it, then backs off.  There is a nice bit of flirting that intensifies throughout the movie between Ashburn and another agent (Marlon Wayans), but not a full-blown romance.  Who knew Wayans would age so well?  (Especially when you put him in some dapper threads.)In case you doubted it, The Heat is hilarious.  Only one moment really fell short for me, and that was because there was a great deal of blood and I am squeamish.  (And yet I was laughing at corpse humor earlier in the movie.  My squeamishness is mostly limited to blood.)  I love seeing comedies in theaters.  You don't hear the experience praised as much as special effects extravaganzas, but there's something about laughing with other people.The Heat is a movie men and women can love.  Adding some estrogen to the buddy cop formula doesn't ruin anything.  Especially not when the movie rides on the shoulders of actors as talented as Bullock and McCarthy.  If you're looking for a funny, profanity-laden action film, then go see The Heat.",4,Extremely funny,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2586,"['reason', 'vast', 'majority', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'understand', 'women', 'love', 'movies', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'men', 'once', 'awhile', 'someone', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'director', 'Bridesmaids', 'back', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'featuring', 'two', 'funniest', 'women', 'alive', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'biggest', 'fan', 'Bridesmaids', 'mostly', 'was', 'approximately', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'Heat', 'much', 'tighter', 'more', 'conventional', 'movie.Bullock', 'plays', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Ashburn', 'who', 'desperately', 'promotion', 'first', 'needs', 'prove', 'can', 'play', 'well', 'others', 'McCarthy', 'Officer', 'Mullins', 'cop', 'streets', 'who', 'desire', 'play', 'well', 'others', 'just', 'neighborhood', 'safe', 'Once', 'again', 'Bullock', 'relegated', 'uptight', 'role', 'are', 'plenty', 'chances', 'show', 'off', 'physical', 'comedy', 'chops', 'McCarthy', 'one', 'allowed', 'let', 'loose', 'go', 'crazy', 'single', 'second', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'McCarthy', 'played', 'Sookie', 'St.', 'James', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Mullins', 'long', 'way', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'When', 'McCarthy', 'screen', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'chase', 'perp', 'down', 'foot', 'believe', 'confidence', 'authority', 'get', 'job', 'done.Okay', 'one', 'favorite', 'things', 'Heat', 'when', 'Ashburn', 'Mullins', 'hurt', 'then', 'actually', 'act', 'hurt', 'magical', 'recovery', 'wounds', 'second', 'favorite', 'might', 'be', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'bogging', 'down', 'proceedings', 'movie', 'clear', 'women', 'can', 'get', 'then', 'off', 'nice', 'bit', 'flirting', 'intensifies', 'movie', 'Ashburn', 'agent', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'not', 'full-blown', 'romance', 'Who', 'knew', 'Wayans', 'would', 'age', 'so', 'well', 'Especially', 'when', 'put', 'dapper', 'threads', 'case', 'doubted', 'Heat', 'hilarious', 'Only', 'one', 'moment', 'really', 'fell', 'short', 'was', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'blood', 'am', 'squeamish', 'yet', 'was', 'laughing', 'corpse', 'humor', 'earlier', 'movie', 'squeamishness', 'mostly', 'limited', 'blood', 'love', 'seeing', 'comedies', 'theaters', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'experience', 'praised', 'as', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganzas', 'something', 'laughing', 'other', 'people.The', 'Heat', 'movie', 'men', 'women', 'can', 'love', 'Adding', 'estrogen', 'buddy', 'cop', 'formula', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'anything', 'Especially', 'not', 'when', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'actors', 'as', 'talented', 'Bullock', 'McCarthy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'funny', 'profanity-laden', 'action', 'film', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'Heat']",N/A

Melissa McCarthy previous movie with Jason BatemanIdentity Thiefgrossed over $134 million.  Heat has grossed over $146 domestically in 6 weeks of release.Heat features a well pinned down yet ambitious FBI agent, played by Sandra Bullock, who does not get along with her peers, and will probably despite her accomplishments, be overlooked for promotion yet again.  She is reassigned to work with the local police, which brings her into contact with the irrepressible Melissa McCarthy character, who does not play apparently by any established rules.The more sophisticated FBI tactics and the local less sophisticated tactics create numerous humorous situations which are developed to great comic effect.  Although the Academy does not usually honour comic performances,  Melissa did break this particular pattern in Bridesmaids, and I consider her performance in this movie the best i have seen to date, and even more deserving than her previous nominated effort.The entire movie crackles with humor even from the bad guys in response to her, and several memorable bits with an Albino character.  I admit I am not a close follower of her career and hardly ever watched her tv comedy series, yet after seeing these most recent two movies in particular I realise that a classic comedy talent like this comes along rarely, maybe once in a generation.If there is a funnier movie this year it has yet to be released.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",5,Melissa's best movie yet-  Theatrical release review.,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,1691,"['must', 'say', 'am', 'surprised', 'movie', 'been', 'out', 'while', 'only', 'one', 'review', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'posted.If', 'love', 'great', 'comedy', 'movies', 'go', 'see', 'one', 'probably', 'funniest', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'year', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'previous', 'movie', 'Jason', 'BatemanIdentity', 'Thiefgrossed', '134', 'million', 'Heat', 'grossed', '146', 'domestically', '6', 'weeks', 'release.Heat', 'features', 'well', 'pinned', 'down', 'yet', 'ambitious', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'not', 'get', 'peers', 'will', 'probably', 'accomplishments', 'be', 'overlooked', 'promotion', 'yet', 'again', 'reassigned', 'work', 'local', 'police', 'contact', 'irrepressible', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'play', 'apparently', 'established', 'rules.The', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'FBI', 'tactics', 'local', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'tactics', 'create', 'numerous', 'humorous', 'situations', 'are', 'developed', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'Academy', 'not', 'usually', 'honour', 'comic', 'performances', 'Melissa', 'did', 'break', 'particular', 'pattern', 'Bridesmaids', 'consider', 'performance', 'movie', 'best', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'even', 'more', 'deserving', 'previous', 'nominated', 'effort.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'crackles', 'humor', 'even', 'bad', 'guys', 'response', 'several', 'memorable', 'bits', 'Albino', 'character', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'close', 'follower', 'career', 'hardly', 'ever', 'watched', 'tv', 'comedy', 'series', 'yet', 'seeing', 'most', 'recent', 'two', 'movies', 'particular', 'realise', 'classic', 'comedy', 'talent', 'along', 'rarely', 'maybe', 'once', 'generation.If', 'funnier', 'movie', 'year', 'yet', 'be', 'released.I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

It also hankers back to those wiseass buddy-buddy movies of the Seventies where everyone is a &#34;perp&#34; or a &#34;narc&#34; or a &#34;douchebag&#34; - and cops keeping the mean streets free of drugs are all heart, gut instinct and no procedure. Throw in an FBI Captain (Demian Bichir) and a Boston Police Chief (a fabulous turn by Thomas Wilson) who are antagonistic and put upon and you get the picture.What makes &#34;The Heat&#34; so enjoyable is just that &#8211; it&#8217;s 'so' enjoyable. And I mean the whole way through. You can&#8217;t help but think that both Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy had an absolute blast making this. And there&#8217;s that rare thing between them too &#8211; a genuine oddball chemistry that shouldn&#8217;t be there but is. These are two great actresses at the top of their game - making it look easy.Bullock is Ashburn &#8211; a snooty rubs-everyone-up-the-wrong-way career-obsessed FBI agent who dresses in immaculate suits and has a way with closing cases that annoys the men in the Bureau (even the sniffer dogs don&#8217;t like her). McCarthy plays Mullins &#8211; a bedraggled foul-mouthed drug-busting Boston Street cop whose hair was last groomed in 1972 and wears the same teeshirt for six days in a row in her beat up car.  One is all rules and regulations and by the book &#8211; while the other is more likely the use the Telephone Book as a weapon during interrogation (her fridge is full of revolvers and rocket launchers instead of food). Bullock about McCarthy as she turns over her Captain&#8217;s office: &#8220;What&#8217;s she doing? Captain: She&#8217;s looking for my balls&#8230;&#8221; There then follows a McCarthy tirade of insults to the whole office about the mediocre size of his appendages that will have you howling with laughter.Both are unwillingly assigned to a pusher called &#34;Larkin&#34; who has eluded the Boston Police forever. Mullins also has to contend with her estranged crazy family and her kid brother Jason (Michael Rappaport) whom &#8216;she&#8217; put in jail for dealing. Jason is a good kid (she was trying to protect him from addiction) &#8211; but just out of jail - maybe he&#8217;s tempted to go back to the wrong crowd again. And on it goes to Ashburn with a knife wound in her knee crawling through hospital corridors to save her partner&#8217;s kin&#8230;As you can imagine &#8211; most of the crudity &#8211; vagina and dick jokes &#8211; barroom hijinks &#8211; hanging drug-dealers over fire escapes &#8211; personal hygiene gags and non-stop laughs is provided by McCarthy - who probably spouts more good one-liners in &#8220;The Heat&#8221; than there&#8217;s been in all 50 of Woody Allen&#8217;s movies. &#8220;I used to be married you know&#8221; says Bullock as they get hammered on shots in a dive bar (a really funny set piece) &#8211; McCarthy replies &#8220;What! To a hearing man!&#8221; The jokes are all like this and Director Mike Feig keeps you giggling at them - all the time.The BLU RAY picture quality is immaculate throughout &#8211; defaulted to 2.40 (bars top and bottom of the screen) &#8211; but even stretched to full aspect &#8211; it looks amazing &#8211; a proper Hollywood blockbuster set of production values.There are two cuts of the movie &#8211; &#8220;Theatrical&#8221; and &#8220;Extended&#8221; and as you can imagine the outtakes in the huge amount of Extras go on for hours and generously feature a lot of the seriously talented supporting cast:1.

1665932,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00E8RK5OC,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[4, 10]","THE HEAT is yet another in a long line of action comedies about hilariously mismatched partners in the police force. Bullock stars as Ashburn, a straight-laced, talented, but ego-maniacal FBI agent. While investigating a drug ring, she is paired up with the loud- and foul-mouthed Mullins (McCarthy). Polar opposites, they bicker relentlessly while getting involved in all kinds of monkey shines, such as trying to bug a drug dealer's phone in a club, performing an emergency tracheotomy, or interrogating suspects by dangling them over two-story balconies.First of all, this has all been done before. The movie is stale from the get-go, and not once does the script attempt any kind of freshness or originality. Bullock rehashes her same basic character fromMiss Congeniality, while McCarthy basically channels a slightly crasser version of nearly every character she's played in  the last seven movies she's been in (all within the last three years; I'd say she's risking over-exposure).Even with its rewarmed plot and cookie-cutter dialogue, the movie wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't try so hard to be both ludicrous and sentimental at the same time. Case in point:-- McCarthy does a solid job in her role, but Mullins is annoying to the point of distraction. She breaks every rule in the book in her capacity as a police officer, and she is relentlessly belligerent and rude to everyone, including her superiors, for no good reason. This is supposed to be funny, I guess, but I kept wondering why she wasn't suspended or fired for her disruptive attitude.-- Also, I found it completely asinine that the film then tries to pretend like Mullins's inability to follow the rules is part of her determination to police bad guys, people who should be in jail for, y'know, not following the rules. Bullock's Ashburn, at one point, gives an impassioned speech about how Mullins is the smartest and best cop she's ever worked with, but this is never really demonstrated in the movie. At all. Instead, we see Mullins constantly endangering people's lives and breaking the law herself on a constant basis. Maybe that's part of the movie's message? That cops should be allowed to commit crimes as long as it's both hilarious and in service of stopping drug dealers?I don't know. All I know is that it feels really disingenuous and stupid and even kind of insulting, as if the film believes that its audience will have the kind of cognitive dissonance needed in order to enjoy watching a woman be violent and crass for ninety minutes and also to buy the contrived sentimental bonding and ""save the day"" antics that are meant to make her not a completely despicable character.Comedies don't always have to make a lot of sense, but they should at least be consistent in their senselessness, and this one just didn't have the balls (even the tiny, half-mouse balls) to avoid the hokey schmaltz and embrace its complete lack of realism. The result is a tepid police procedural punctuated with the same basic joke, over and over again, until the predictably lukewarm ending.",2,Rewarmed Annoyance,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,3066,"['HEAT', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'action', 'comedies', 'hilariously', 'mismatched', 'partners', 'police', 'force', 'Bullock', 'Ashburn', 'straight-laced', 'talented', 'ego-maniacal', 'FBI', 'agent', 'investigating', 'drug', 'ring', 'paired', 'up', 'loud-', 'foul-mouthed', 'Mullins', 'McCarthy', 'Polar', 'opposites', 'bicker', 'relentlessly', 'getting', 'involved', 'kinds', 'monkey', 'shines', 'such', 'trying', 'bug', 'drug', 'dealer', 'phone', 'club', 'performing', 'emergency', 'tracheotomy', 'interrogating', 'suspects', 'dangling', 'two-story', 'balconies.First', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'movie', 'stale', 'get-go', 'not', 'once', 'script', 'attempt', 'kind', 'freshness', 'originality', 'Bullock', 'same', 'basic', 'character', 'fromMiss', 'Congeniality', 'McCarthy', 'basically', 'slightly', 'crasser', 'version', 'nearly', 'character', 'played', 'last', 'seven', 'movies', 'been', 'last', 'three', 'years', ""'d"", 'say', 'risking', 'over-exposure', 'rewarmed', 'plot', 'cookie-cutter', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'ludicrous', 'sentimental', 'same', 'time', 'Case', 'point', 'McCarthy', 'solid', 'job', 'role', 'Mullins', 'annoying', 'point', 'distraction', 'rule', 'book', 'capacity', 'police', 'officer', 'relentlessly', 'belligerent', 'rude', 'everyone', 'including', 'superiors', 'good', 'reason', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'guess', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'suspended', 'fired', 'disruptive', 'attitude.', 'Also', 'found', 'completely', 'film', 'then', 'pretend', 'Mullins', 'inability', 'follow', 'rules', 'part', 'determination', 'police', 'bad', 'guys', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'jail', ""y'know"", 'not', 'following', 'rules', 'Bullock', 'Ashburn', 'one', 'point', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'how', 'Mullins', 'smartest', 'best', 'cop', 'ever', 'worked', 'never', 'really', 'demonstrated', 'movie', 'Instead', 'see', 'Mullins', 'constantly', 'endangering', 'people', 'lives', 'breaking', 'law', 'herself', 'constant', 'basis', 'Maybe', 'part', 'movie', 'message', 'cops', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'commit', 'crimes', 'as', 'long', 'hilarious', 'service', 'stopping', 'drug', 'dealers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'really', 'disingenuous', 'stupid', 'even', 'kind', 'insulting', 'film', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'kind', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'needed', 'order', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'woman', 'be', 'violent', 'crass', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'also', 'buy', 'contrived', 'sentimental', 'bonding', 'save', 'day', 'antics', 'are', 'meant', 'make', 'not', 'completely', 'despicable', 'character.Comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'consistent', 'senselessness', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'balls', 'even', 'tiny', 'half-mouse', 'balls', 'avoid', 'hokey', 'schmaltz', 'embrace', 'complete', 'lack', 'realism', 'result', 'tepid', 'police', 'procedural', 'punctuated', 'same', 'basic', 'joke', 'over', 'again', 'predictably', 'lukewarm', 'ending']",N/A

There were some funny parts but overall it was just long and formulaic. McCarthy's performance was not believable and the profanity got old very fast. It seemed like she was using so much profanity to be funny and tough at the same time but it was just boring to me. Actually, she should have been fired and the Boston Police should have had massive lawsuits on their hands. Bullock gave a credible performance but it was stilted at times and fell into the familiar pattern of a straitlaced cop learning that there are better ways of bring down bad guy than following the law. It was a waste of money (to make and see). The only positive is that I only spent $5.99 rather than ~$20.00 at a theater. Sorry, Sandra.

1665934,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00E8RK5OC,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Sandra Bullock may have one an Oscar for her dramatic role in BLINDSIDE but she's more known for her comedic roles. But over the past few years she's released some decent comedies that just didn't take off like those in her past. That's made up for THE HEAT.Bullock stars as FBI Agent Sarah Ashburn, a no nonsense top agent who solves more cases than most of her fellow officers. Unfortunately her attitude is in serious need of adjustment. Ashburn suffers no fools and often not only outshines her fellow agents but lets them know it too. To say she's not popular is an understatement.When a possible promotion comes up she's informed of this problem and sent to Boston to help in an investigation of a drug lord that's been untouchable to date. Following up where the clues lead, she arrives at the Boston precinct just as a suspect has been placed in lockup. What she doesn't know is the police officer who arrested this suspect and the way she handles things.Officer Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) is a die hard cop, one who is also no nonsense but in a more in your face manner. Mullins thinks nothing of slamming a suspect around or carrying more weapons on her than most Marines. She's so tough that the rest of the police officers around her are afraid of her, including her captain. When she learns that Ashburn is interrogating her suspect rather than co-operate she heads straight for her.The two part ways but in an attempt to get the information she needs and to work with her counterpart, Ashburn tries to talk to her at a bar not noticing when Mullins slips the FBI case file out of her purse. With this information she shows up at the next suspect's house at the same time Ashburn does and the two make an attempt to work as partners. What develops as the film moves forward is a certain amount of respect that the two have for one another ala the odd couple as they attempt to find the bad guy and take him down.There are several sub plots going on here as well, most of them dealing with Mullins family or the fact that while these two women are career minded they also tend to be loners. Neither has a deep friendship with anyone else but you know before the end credits roll that one will develop. Does that make the movie predictable? Sure but so what? People who dislike movies that are predictable need to look closer because nearly every movie made involves a story that's been told before. What makes a movie special is the way it comes together or as in this case the life brought to it by the stars involved.These two ladies are tops in their field and bring the funny to what could have been a boring movie. Bullock's straight laced, attractive career girl with no man in her life and no one who likes her is loosened up by the very open Mullins. McCarthy does what she's best at as the brashest of characters whose love life is filled with guys she keeps running into but none that she wants to stay with. Watching her hard facade ease up as she and Ashburn work the case makes hers a more interesting character than one would expect.A word of caution and that is that the movie has more F bombs in it than most films. While that makes it not a family friendly movie it does end up providing some of the laughs here. I've only seen two movies that have used the use of the word to full effect, this one and the car rental scene in PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. While it might get overused here there are moments when it comes into play with the characters and their changes. Just go in expecting it because it's used not for shock value but for character development.I've been surprised this past year. Twice I've seen comedies that have made me actually laugh out loud even the second time around that I watched them. THIS IS THE END was the first and this movie is the second. It may not be a movie I'll watch week after week but it is one I'll be glad to add to the collection of moves to keep. And when I need a good laugh, I'll put it in the DVD player and start up.",5,BULLOCK & MCCARTHY TURN UP THE HEAT,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,4005,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'Oscar', 'dramatic', 'role', 'BLINDSIDE', 'more', 'known', 'comedic', 'roles', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'released', 'decent', 'comedies', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'past', 'made', 'up', 'THE', 'HEAT.Bullock', 'stars', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Sarah', 'Ashburn', 'nonsense', 'top', 'agent', 'who', 'more', 'cases', 'most', 'fellow', 'officers', 'Unfortunately', 'attitude', 'serious', 'need', 'adjustment', 'Ashburn', 'fools', 'often', 'not', 'only', 'fellow', 'agents', 'know', 'too', 'say', 'not', 'popular', 'understatement.When', 'possible', 'promotion', 'up', 'informed', 'problem', 'sent', 'Boston', 'help', 'investigation', 'drug', 'lord', 'been', 'untouchable', 'date', 'Following', 'up', 'where', 'clues', 'lead', 'Boston', 'precinct', 'just', 'suspect', 'been', 'placed', 'lockup', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'arrested', 'suspect', 'way', 'things.Officer', 'Shannon', 'Mullins', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'die', 'hard', 'cop', 'one', 'who', 'also', 'nonsense', 'more', 'face', 'manner', 'Mullins', 'nothing', 'slamming', 'suspect', 'carrying', 'more', 'weapons', 'most', 'Marines', 'so', 'tough', 'rest', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'afraid', 'including', 'captain', 'When', 'Ashburn', 'interrogating', 'suspect', 'rather', 'co-operate', 'heads', 'straight', 'her.The', 'two', 'part', 'ways', 'attempt', 'get', 'information', 'work', 'counterpart', 'Ashburn', 'talk', 'bar', 'not', 'noticing', 'when', 'Mullins', 'FBI', 'case', 'file', 'purse', 'information', 'up', 'next', 'suspect', 'house', 'same', 'time', 'Ashburn', 'two', 'make', 'attempt', 'work', 'partners', 'What', 'film', 'moves', 'forward', 'certain', 'amount', 'respect', 'two', 'have', 'one', 'ala', 'odd', 'couple', 'attempt', 'find', 'bad', 'guy', 'take', 'down.There', 'are', 'several', 'sub', 'plots', 'going', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'dealing', 'Mullins', 'family', 'fact', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'career', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'loners', 'Neither', 'deep', 'friendship', 'anyone', 'else', 'know', 'end', 'roll', 'one', 'will', 'develop', 'make', 'movie', 'predictable', 'Sure', 'so', 'what', 'People', 'who', 'dislike', 'movies', 'are', 'predictable', 'need', 'look', 'closer', 'nearly', 'movie', 'made', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'What', 'movie', 'special', 'way', 'together', 'as', 'case', 'life', 'brought', 'stars', 'involved.These', 'two', 'ladies', 'are', 'tops', 'field', 'bring', 'funny', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'movie', 'Bullock', 'straight', 'laced', 'attractive', 'career', 'girl', 'man', 'life', 'one', 'who', 'loosened', 'up', 'very', 'open', 'Mullins', 'McCarthy', 'what', 'best', 'brashest', 'characters', 'love', 'life', 'filled', 'guys', 'running', 'none', 'stay', 'Watching', 'hard', 'facade', 'ease', 'up', 'Ashburn', 'work', 'case', 'hers', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'one', 'would', 'expect.A', 'word', 'caution', 'movie', 'more', 'F', 'bombs', 'most', 'films', 'not', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'providing', 'laughs', 'here', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'used', 'use', 'word', 'full', 'effect', 'one', 'car', 'rental', 'scene', 'PLANES', 'TRAINS', 'AND', 'AUTOMOBILES', 'might', 'get', 'overused', 'here', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'play', 'characters', 'changes', 'Just', 'go', 'expecting', 'used', 'not', 'shock', 'value', 'character', 'development.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'surprised', 'past', 'year', 'Twice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'comedies', 'have', 'made', 'actually', 'out', 'loud', 'even', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'THIS', 'THE', 'END', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'second', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'week', 'week', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'add', 'collection', 'moves', 'keep', 'when', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'start', 'up']",N/A

1665952,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00E8RK5OC,M. Bullions,"[185, 212]","One thing I hate about female-driven comedy is the oft-sub par material that women have to work with. The punchline is always something tasteless or stale - like age, body image or gender roles. For some reason, the misogynistic question of whether or not women are funny is still a topic of hot debate. Kristen Wiig's ""Bridesmaids"" should have been enough to shut these guys up once and for all, but alas, it was not.""The Heat"" reunites ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy, who, after 15 years in show business, was finally recognized as the star that she is, after the release of that film, which earned her an Academy Award nomination. Since then, McCarthy has been one busy gal -  on her time off from filming her sitcom ""Mike & Molly,"" this married mother of two has been filming movies left and right. She's a box office sure thing - the critically panned ""Identity Thief"" scored $135 million at the box office, and ""The Heat"", originally planned for an April 2013 release, was moved to the more profitable and lucrative summer movie season by 20th Century Fox, when the film played astoundingly well to test audiences.And it was worth the wait. ""The Heat"" isn't very original, thematically or plot-wise. It's a buddy-cop movie, and it's ""The Odd Couple,"" with women, but it's also so much more than that, and here's why. It's funny. It works. The chemistry between the two leads is exuberant enough to make the two lead characters instantly likable.""The Heat"" follows Sarah Ashburn (Bullock), an uptight and straitlaced FBI special agent who is sent to Boston to take down a notorious drug lord, with the possibility of a big promotion, should she do her job well. She's thrown together with foulmouthed, brash and brazen Shannon Mullins, who is an opposite personality, to say the least. But McCarthy and Bullock bring out the best in each other, in a film where much of the humor is clearly reliant on improvisation. It's easy to think that these women are good friends in real life, considering how well they play off of each other in this film.Vanity has no place in comedy, and this is something that McCarthy completely understands. Sandra Bullock is wearing makeup and looks gorgeous throughout the whole movie, while McCarthy does much better with the rough exterior, wearing little to no makeup at any given time, and engages in the brash physical comedy more than Bullock does...but McCarthy often gets the bigger laughs, and leaves a more lasting impression. That's not to say that Bullock isn't great in her own right either.One thing I particularly liked in this film was the lack of a romantic storyline. With female-driven comedies, we almost always see a love story of some kind - because that's the cliche. It could have had running gags about age and body image, or either of these characters finding a husband, but it doesn't. Chick flick cliches are thankfully avoided, making this movie just as enjoyable for men, as it is women. The one time the issue of being a woman in a testosterone-driven workplace is brought up, it's discussed in a ""do we have to talk about this?"" kind of way.Director Paul Feig seems to have a knack for capturing McCarthy at her best. She's given the two best performances of her film career in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat."" I just hope they collaborate for Fieg's next project. In the end, ""The Heat"" is a movie that really is funny the entire way through, with two instantly likable and non-stereotypical female leads. It's about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but the laughs are magical, and they just keep coming.Grade: A",5,"Absolutely hilarious, from beginning to end.",1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,3596,"['One', 'thing', 'hate', 'female-driven', 'comedy', 'oft-sub', 'par', 'material', 'women', 'have', 'work', 'punchline', 'always', 'something', 'tasteless', 'stale', 'age', 'body', 'image', 'gender', 'roles', 'reason', 'misogynistic', 'question', 'not', 'women', 'are', 'funny', 'still', 'topic', 'hot', 'debate', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Bridesmaids', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'shut', 'guys', 'up', 'once', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'Heat', 'Bridesmaids', 'director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'who', '15', 'years', 'show', 'business', 'was', 'finally', 'recognized', 'star', 'release', 'film', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'then', 'McCarthy', 'been', 'one', 'busy', 'gal', 'time', 'filming', 'sitcom', 'Mike', 'Molly', 'married', 'mother', 'two', 'been', 'filming', 'movies', 'left', 'right', 'box', 'office', 'sure', 'thing', 'critically', 'panned', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'scored', '135', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'Heat', 'originally', 'planned', 'April', '2013', 'release', 'was', 'moved', 'more', 'profitable', 'lucrative', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'when', 'film', 'played', 'astoundingly', 'well', 'test', 'audiences.And', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'Heat', ""n't"", 'very', 'original', 'thematically', 'plot-wise', 'buddy-cop', 'movie', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'women', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'why', 'funny', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'exuberant', 'enough', 'make', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'instantly', 'likable', 'Heat', 'Sarah', 'Ashburn', 'Bullock', 'uptight', 'straitlaced', 'FBI', 'special', 'agent', 'who', 'sent', 'Boston', 'take', 'down', 'notorious', 'drug', 'lord', 'possibility', 'big', 'promotion', 'should', 'do', 'job', 'well', 'thrown', 'together', 'foulmouthed', 'brash', 'brazen', 'Shannon', 'Mullins', 'who', 'opposite', 'personality', 'say', 'least', 'McCarthy', 'Bullock', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'other', 'film', 'where', 'much', 'humor', 'clearly', 'reliant', 'improvisation', 'easy', 'think', 'women', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'considering', 'how', 'well', 'play', 'other', 'film.Vanity', 'place', 'comedy', 'something', 'McCarthy', 'completely', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'gorgeous', 'whole', 'movie', 'McCarthy', 'much', 'better', 'rough', 'exterior', 'wearing', 'little', 'makeup', 'given', 'time', 'brash', 'physical', 'comedy', 'more', 'Bullock', 'McCarthy', 'often', 'bigger', 'laughs', 'more', 'lasting', 'impression', 'not', 'say', 'Bullock', ""n't"", 'great', 'own', 'right', 'either.One', 'thing', 'particularly', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'lack', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'female-driven', 'comedies', 'almost', 'always', 'see', 'love', 'story', 'kind', 'cliche', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'running', 'gags', 'age', 'body', 'image', 'characters', 'finding', 'husband', ""n't"", 'Chick', 'flick', 'cliches', 'are', 'thankfully', 'avoided', 'making', 'movie', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'men', 'women', 'one', 'time', 'issue', 'being', 'woman', 'testosterone-driven', 'workplace', 'brought', 'up', 'discussed', 'do', 'have', 'talk', 'kind', 'way.Director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'have', 'knack', 'capturing', 'McCarthy', 'best', 'given', 'two', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'career', 'Bridesmaids', 'Heat', 'just', 'hope', 'collaborate', 'Fieg', 'next', 'project', 'end', 'Heat', 'movie', 'really', 'funny', 'entire', 'way', 'two', 'instantly', 'likable', 'non-stereotypical', 'female', 'as', 'subtle', 'sledgehammer', 'laughs', 'are', 'magical', 'just', 'keep', 'coming.Grade']",N/A

The combination of Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock is very welcome and some of the scenes are simply hysterical. Unfortunately, the film is wildly uneven that inhibits much of the comedy.Basically, the plot is straight from the &#34;Lethal Weapon&#34; series, a cop/buddy flick from the 1980s. A dangerous drug dealer named &#34;Larkin&#34; (really?) is being tracked down by the FBI with Bullock as the over-achieving, under-appreciated agent. In Boston, she runs headlong into the large, cursing machine detective played by McCarthy. For many, the film may ride on just how they can stand the flood of invectives from McCarthy's character. However, it must be said that her fire is part of the hilarity.This film features some amazing, hilarious moments, particularly the entire scene in a club where Bullock must place a bug into the phone of one of Larkin's henchman. From the fake fire alarm to the bathroom to dancing with the henchman, the entire sequence is one of the funniest I've seen in quite a while. Unfortunately,  a lot of the humor is undercut by the emphasis on violence and blood, particularly when Bullock tries to administer a tracheotomy to a person choking to death. This scene is really more shocking and sick than funny, yet it is played for laughs which makes it all the more uncomfortable.A little trimming here, a little less violence there and a revamping of Bullock's character who unfortunately is way under-developed with too much emphasis on &#34;background&#34; and not enough on her personality. It isn't helped by the opening scene which shows off the agents' considerable talents, yet she's not promoted because the guys don't like her? Really? Bullock's character should be stronger with fewer &#34;goofs&#34; so when she does screw up it is hilarious...unfortunately she screws up way too much and its rather sad.Still, if you enjoy the cop/buddy movies of the 1980s and can take the considerable foul-mouth gab from McCarthy, this is one potent, if uneven comedy.",3,"Wildly uneven, this effort does have the laughs",1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2078,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'said', '34', 'Heat', '34', ""n't"", 'already', 'be', 'said', 'combination', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'very', 'welcome', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'hysterical', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'much', 'comedy.Basically', 'plot', 'straight', '34', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '34', 'series', 'cop/buddy', 'flick', '1980s', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', '34', 'Larkin', '34', 'really', 'being', 'tracked', 'down', 'FBI', 'Bullock', 'over-achieving', 'under-appreciated', 'agent', 'Boston', 'headlong', 'large', 'cursing', 'machine', 'detective', 'played', 'McCarthy', 'many', 'film', 'may', 'ride', 'just', 'how', 'can', 'stand', 'flood', 'invectives', 'McCarthy', 'character', 'However', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'fire', 'part', 'hilarity.This', 'film', 'amazing', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'particularly', 'entire', 'scene', 'club', 'where', 'Bullock', 'must', 'place', 'bug', 'phone', 'one', 'Larkin', 'henchman', 'fake', 'fire', 'alarm', 'bathroom', 'dancing', 'henchman', 'entire', 'sequence', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'Unfortunately', 'lot', 'humor', 'undercut', 'emphasis', 'violence', 'blood', 'particularly', 'when', 'Bullock', 'administer', 'tracheotomy', 'person', 'choking', 'death', 'scene', 'really', 'more', 'shocking', 'sick', 'funny', 'played', 'laughs', 'more', 'uncomfortable.A', 'little', 'trimming', 'here', 'little', 'less', 'violence', 'there', 'revamping', 'Bullock', 'character', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'under-developed', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', '34', 'background', '34', 'not', 'enough', 'personality', ""n't"", 'helped', 'opening', 'scene', 'agents', 'considerable', 'talents', 'not', 'promoted', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Really', 'Bullock', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'stronger', 'fewer', '34', 'goofs', '34', 'so', 'when', 'screw', 'up', 'hilarious', 'unfortunately', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'rather', 'sad.Still', 'enjoy', 'cop/buddy', 'movies', '1980s', 'can', 'take', 'considerable', 'foul-mouth', 'gab', 'McCarthy', 'one', 'potent', 'uneven', 'comedy']",N/A

And while there are many recent comparisons that come to mind, I mostly thought of Eddie Murphy in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" (1984) as I watched this film. Sure the gender is different and that makes it even more fun.Paul Feig seems to be specializing in female led raunchy comedies with the highly successful ""Bridesmaids"" his only other film. Here he brings back Melissa McCarthy and turns her loose as Boston police detective Mullins forced to work with FBI special agent Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) in an effort to bring a high profile drug operation down.Mullins is loud, brash, profane, vulgar, disrespectful, and well...damn funny. Ashburn is quite the opposite. She's career motivated, eager to a fault, buttoned up and has a personality that could be described as anal. Nobody wants to work with her and she cannot command respect even though she is technically thorough.They make a great pair even if they are like oil and water after they meet. Some will take offense at some of the violence (innocent people are killed) and certainly McCarthy as Mullins has deep pockets of profanity with an unusual but effective way of stringing the words together. I found the writing to be terrific and McCarthy is always a hoot. Bullock holds her own as the mostly ""straight man"" but gets in some funny stuff as well.

The chemistry created here is Oil and Water....no romance, just a raucous, raunchy romp with a refreshing twist on the good-cop-bad-cop theme!Initially viewers are introduced to Boston PD street cop Shannon Mullins(Melissa McCarthy).  Hysterically funny in her ""duty"" she is overly endowed with ""street cred"" but obviously shortchanged on Estrogen; her manner is loud, abrupt and incessantly profane.  FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) is so smug and pedantic her co-workers avoid her like a patch of Poison Oak.  As reluctant partners thrown together by an inter agency assignment, they set out to locate and apprehend a notorious drug kingpin who holds Boston in his bloody hands.There is an abundance of really funny physical comedy here and some hilarious lines delivered with rapidity between Officer Mullins and her unfortunate targets (especially Agent Ashburn!) however all too often the punchlines are drowned out by seemingly unnecessary profanity (there are MORE ""F words"" thrown around here than a Tarrantino script).  Our two Lasses are fighting one another for a good 2/3 of the film until they unite following a traumatic family event.  Now it really goes over the top and delivers a spectacular (and of course predictable) funny ending..........One of my favorite scenes involves Sarah accompanying  Shannon home to visit her estranged (outrageous and  hilariously DYSFUNCTIONAL) family (who knew?) and learning a new language.........also who could forget Officer Mullin's apartment in the neighborhood drug apartment complex with her Rambo-like motif.

Mullins is a real down and out detective, who us feared by all of her colleagues. Ashburn is the snooty FBI outsider, who wants thus new case all on her own. We know that Ashburn has problems getting along. Ashburn and Mullins are forced to work together by Ashburn's FBI boss, to bring down a Boston drug kingpin.Mullins comes from a big Boston family whose members are no longer speaking to Mullins because she put her own brother in jail. Mullins' own mother played by Jane Curtin, slows down the car as she drives past Mullins, holding up her middle finger. Crazy family, yes siree!Their new case brings them together, finding and fighting the bad guys. Lots of violence and cuteness mixed together. Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy have chemistry together, the good and the bad, the funny and the not funny at all, the beautiful and the not so beautiful.

Melissa McCarthy, still on her hit-movie roll, is the Boston cop whose slovenly appearance, verbal abusiveness, foul-mouthed demeanor and borderline-psychotic tendencies mask the heart-of-gold that beats just beneath the surface. Against their better judgment, they are forced to team up to capture a dangerous drug kingpin operating in McCarthy's jurisdiction.Movies like ""The Heat"" rise and fall on the appeal of their players and the humor of the writing, and ""The Heat"" does reasonably well on both counts under the auspices of writer Katie Dippold and director Paul Feig.

At its heart it is a formula buddy film except in this movie the buddies are women.  Actually they don't start out as buddies but the fun part is watching the transformation from antagonist to buddy.  Sandra Bullock does her usual excellent job but the film is stolen by her co-star Melissa McCarthy.  What really puts this film into a whole new category is that the leads are not there because of their looks but are real characters.  Melissa is not only far from slim in body and brain but she is perhaps one of the most unattractive females I have seen on screen in a long time and never is such a pivotal role.  In fact Melissa makes the film and is hysterical in her role as a hard street detective.  There is non-stop action from the very first moments as we see Sandra Bullock innocently get off on the wrong foot with Melissa who never takes anything lightly.

It's the old &#34;Odd Couple&#34; dynamic.There is a reason why this concept is used time and time again....it works! The Heat is no exception!But even though the outline is as old as comedy itself, The Heat is not just recylced junk. It brings a new and entertaining look at this classic routine.Mellissa McCarthy is the comedy. Sandra Bullock is the straight man (or woman, in this case). It's unique for this dynamic because you almost exclusively see this done with men. But these two women make it their own! Mellissa McCarthy is a tough no nonsense, kind of dirty, explosives loving street cop. Sandra Bullock is a by the book, prim and proper paperwork loving FBI agent.Both are great cops, but in very different ways. And they need each other to solve a case that is the most important of both's career.Melissa McCarthy does not mess around in this part. She takes her grungey character to the extreme and is so over the top outlandish that it goes from funny to overdone, to all the way back around to funny again. She is clearly ad libbing much of the part as is evident by Sandra Bullock's reactions. There are times when McCarthy is so funny that Bullock is just in shock. (I don't mean her character is in shock. I mean the actress is in shock)There were several times my wife and I had to rewind the movie (funny how we still say rewind, isn't it?) becuase we missed a few minutes from laughing so hard.

That said, this a a review of the Bluray combo pack.There are already 70 reviews of the ""film"" posted as I write this and nearly all concentrate on the film itself, so I will not spend a lot of space on that (you can read the others) except to say that I found it a fun film to watch, especially watching Sandra Bullock out of her element. I'll admit that I have not seen ""The Bridesmaids"" so this was my first opportunity to see Melissa McCarthy (and her mouth) in action. I guess I find the profanity a bit forced (and there for ""shock value"") but there were some funny lines.Okay, now to give you info on the BD/DVD. First off, the package includes BOTH the Theatrical (R rated) version and the ""Unrated"" version. The R runs an hour and 57 minutes while the Unrated one adds three more minutes. I chose to watch the longer one but, since I don't plan to watch the film again, I can't tell you which three minutes were added back. I will say that the cuts must have been for language or violence (there is a gruesome scene in which a man is saved from choking and that could be it) because there is no nudity here. (Bullock doesn't even show much cleavage in the ""drunken night"" scene.)The package touts ""2 Hours of Hysterical Bonus Features"" and I got through some of those, which include: ""How THE HEAT was made"", ""Von Bloopers"", ""Let's Get Physical - on the stunts,  and one called ""All the Stuff We Had to Take Out But Still Think Is Funny - Deleted, Alternate & Extended Scenes"".  Then there are FIVE commentaries including the director (an over the top ""comic"") and the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000. There is even - I kid you not - a Bonus Feature titled "" ""Welcome to The Bonus Features!"" with Director Paul Feig doing comic shtick. Obviously they didn't leave ANYTHING on the ""cutting room floor"".If you are a fan of the film, and have a few extra hours to kill, you might want to avail yourself of all these bonuses. I decided to be selective and just choose some - but they are there in case you want them.  With the success of this film I'm sure that Feig is already planning ""THE HEAT 2"" (and, maybe TH3 and TH4)I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Review of the Bluray/DVD version - Bonus features galore!,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,2451,"['have', 'not', 'noticed', 'now', 'Amazon', 'groups', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'movie', 'release', 'together', 'so', 'always', 'recommend', 'customers', 'note', 'format', 'being', 'reviewed', 'better', 'yet', 'sort', 'reviews', 'most', 'recent', 'said', 'review', 'Bluray', 'combo', 'are', 'already', '70', 'reviews', 'film', 'posted', 'write', 'nearly', 'concentrate', 'film', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'spend', 'lot', 'space', 'can', 'read', 'others', 'say', 'found', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'especially', 'watching', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'element', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Bridesmaids', 'was', 'first', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'mouth', 'action', 'guess', 'find', 'profanity', 'bit', 'forced', 'there', 'shock', 'value', 'were', 'funny', 'lines.Okay', 'now', 'give', 'info', 'BD/DVD', 'First', 'package', 'Theatrical', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'Unrated', 'version', 'R', 'hour', '57', 'minutes', 'Unrated', 'one', 'three', 'more', 'minutes', 'chose', 'watch', 'longer', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'three', 'minutes', 'were', 'added', 'back', 'will', 'say', 'cuts', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'language', 'violence', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'man', 'saved', 'choking', 'could', 'be', 'nudity', 'here', 'Bullock', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'much', 'cleavage', 'drunken', 'night', 'scene', 'package', '2', 'Hours', 'Hysterical', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'got', 'include', 'How', 'HEAT', 'was', 'made', 'Von', 'Bloopers', 'Let', 'Get', 'Physical', 'stunts', 'one', 'called', 'Stuff', 'Had', 'Take', 'Out', 'Still', 'Think', 'Is', 'Funny', 'Deleted', 'Alternate', 'Extended', 'Scenes', 'Then', 'are', 'FIVE', 'commentaries', 'including', 'director', 'top', 'comic', 'guys', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'even', 'kid', 'not', 'Bonus', 'Feature', 'titled', 'Welcome', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'doing', 'comic', 'shtick', 'Obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'ANYTHING', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', '.If', 'are', 'fan', 'film', 'have', 'few', 'extra', 'hours', 'kill', 'might', 'want', 'avail', 'bonuses', 'decided', 'be', 'selective', 'just', 'choose', 'are', 'there', 'case', 'want', 'success', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Feig', 'already', 'planning', 'THE', 'HEAT', '2', 'maybe', 'TH3', 'TH4', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

1666250,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00E8RK5OC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 9]","There is such a thing as overhyping a film. Case in point: ""The Heat"" starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. Directed by Paul Feig, hot off ""Bridesmaids"", the publicity machine has been working overtime since the film began production, amping up our expectations to such a point it would be difficult (if not impossible) for any film to meet, let alone exceed these expectations.Everyone wants a female buddy film to succeed. There are a lot of talented actresses out there who are woefully underused and there are far too many bad male buddy films made every year. Give the women their due! This is one aspect of the film many media outlets have been touting for almost a year. Then, when you add Bullock, an A-Lister and Oscar Winner, McCarthy, an Emmy winner and extremely hot property, and Feig, who became an A-Lister after the success of ""Bridesmaids"", the three are a match made in Holltywood heaven. The trio also give the publicity machine a lot to discuss.Last November, I began to see the trailer for ""The Heat"" before at least 90% of the films I saw. I see a lot of films, so I saw the trailer a lot, many, many times. And my partner and I laughed every time. But when the television commercials started, everything seemed to become less funny. My partner even began to question if he wanted to see the film at all. Twentieth Century Fox had reached the oversaturation point.When we did see it, I was underwhelmed. ""The Heat"" is a pretty funny film, but it isn't funny enough. After all of the hype, I was expecting something hilarious.FBI Agent Ashburn (Bullock) is not well-liked by her co-workers. When she learns her boss (Demian Bichir, TV's ""The Bridge"", ""Weeds"", ""A Better Life"") is going to get a promotion to Washington, she expects to be his replacement. But he knows she doesn't get along with her co-workers and sends her to Boston to find a drug kingpin; one of his low-level dealers, Rojas, has just been arrested. Detective Mullins (McCarthy) arrests Rojas and takes him in. Ashburn arrives and insists on interrogating Rojas without Mullins approval or knowledge. Everyone in the station house knows this is a mistake, but Ashburn persists, unaware of Mullins' reputation. When Mullins finds out Ashburn has begun interrogating her suspect, their relationship doesn't get off on the right foot. As they continue to investigate the case, Ashburn's by-the-book manner clashes with Mullins' bull-in-a-china-shop attitude.Bullock has played this role before, so it doesn't offer any surprises. She does the uptight, by-the-book character well, so when we realize this is what Ashburn will be, and all she will be, it is a bit of a letdown. Bullock is an Oscar winner so when she does a role she could do in her sleep, it is like watching her do a television show. Worse, once we begin to get who Ashburn is, we know how, when and why her character will evolve.Bullock is also the straight man to McCarthy's Mullins. Again, this is the easy way out. It would be much more unexpected for Bullock to play the aggressive, down-and-dirty Boston detective. And if it worked, we would be discussing one of the most memorable films of the year. But because they took the easy way out, the film is simply OK and doesn't overwhelm.McCarthy is a very funny comedian who is just beginning to receive acclaim for what will be a long career in film and television. She is great in her TV show ""Mike & Molly"" and the film ""Bridesmaids"". She made ""Identity Thief"" watchable. Her cameo in ""The Hangover Part III"" wasn't interesting or funny, a misstep for this usually very funny comic. Basically, she is striking while the iron is hot and taking on many different projects. Unfortunately, the quality of the work varies quite a bit. This isn't a problem only for McCarthy, every actor has ups and downs, but it seems like this problem could be avoided by being a little more choosy.In ""The Heat"", she plays Mullins, a foul-mouthed detective with a very short fuse. Very, very short. This short fuse is the catalyst for a lot of the comedy; she is extremely aggressive towards her captain, other detectives, Ashburn, her family, the criminals, everyone. If she doesn't get what she wants, she begins to make extremely nasty threats, some of these are funny while others fall victim as an ad lib gone on too long. There is also a fair bit of physical humor; some of which works and some doesn't. Ultimately, McCarthy's performance is good, but it is a mixed bag. And since her performance provides the majority of the humor, the film suffers as a result.Marlon Wayans pops up as Levy, a Boston based FBI agent assigned to help Ashburn. His performance has a few nice quirks making him more interesting than the rest of the supporting cast.Jason, Mullins' brother, played by Michael Rappaport, has recently been released from prison, serving a sentence his sister arrested him for. He may have a connection to the case and Mullins reluctantly agrees to visit her estranged family, led by Mom (Jane Curtin). Her entire family is strange and this leads to one of the extended scenes that just fall flat: Ashburn is forced to sit at the family dinner table while Mullins goes outside to talk to her brother. The family begins to interrogate the FBI agent, hurling insults about her sexuality and profession. Yeah, this is about as funny as it sounds.The investigation is a pretty pointless affair, the duo seems to stumble on most of the information they gather and there isn't a lot of detective work. But that isn't really the point of ""The Heat""; the point is to watch the two female stars interact with one another and generate some laughs. While there are some laughs, there aren't enough. Because ""The Heat"" is all about their relationship, it isn't very memorable either.Because the film was so overhyped, my expectations were much higher. If the publicity for this film were just normal, the film's average nature would be more acceptable. As it is, ""The Heat"" will play for years on cable; every time you are doing housework, and you catch a few minutes, it will make the mundane nature of your chores a little more enjoyable. But sit and watch the film as a whole? That would be a chore.",3,Not Worthy of the Excessive Hype,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,6206,"['such', 'thing', 'overhyping', 'film', 'Case', 'point', 'Heat', 'starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock',

1666272,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00E8RK5OC,Turfseer,"[6, 37]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0Capitalizing on the success of 'Bridesmaids', Director Paul Feig once again employs his overweight, over the top actress, Melissa McCarthy, in another gross out comedy. This time the foul-mouthed McCarthy plays Detective Shannon Mullins of the Boston PD, paired up with Sandra Bullock as a stuck up FBI Agent, Sarah Ashburn. 'The Heat' is pretty much a formulaic cop-buddy movie, played mostly for laughs, with some occasional violent detours.I'm happy to report that Sandra Bullock continues to delude herself that she has talent as a comic actress. You'll recall that she also was cast as an FBI agent, in the much more entertaining 'Miss Confidentiality'. But here she's merely repeating her 'straw man' (or should I say 'straw woman'?) persona, which was continually on depressing display in her earlier 2009 pseudo-comic foray, 'The Proposal'.The dictionary informs us that a 'straw man' is a ""fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person, object, matter, etc., used as a seeming adversary or argument."" In 'The Proposal', Bullock played a narcissistic editor-in-chief who was basically a klutz and totally incompetent in her social life. The same goes for her anal FBI agent here--consider the obnoxious scene, where she bungles an emergency tracheotomy. Ms. Bullock has an idea that exposing a character such as Special Agent Ashburn is funny. The problem is that no one can identify with such a character, since they don't exist in real life. Can you really believe that such an incompetent character as Ashburn would rise through the ranks, especially in such an organization as the FBI, which prides itself on its training? And even if there were such a character as Bullock depicts here, no one should be at all amused by such an unappealing character's comeuppance. Ashburn gives all 'alpha' men and women, a bad name!McCarthy also has the same problem in that the idea of a ball-busting detective, who intimidates her male superiors, is simple wish fulfillment on the part of the film's scenarists. The way in which Captain Woods (played by Thomas F. Wilson-the actor who played 'Biff' in 'Back to the Future) kow-tows to Mullins, is the opposite of the patriarchal sub-culture typically found in most police departments today. In other words, it's too much of an exaggeration to take seriously. We see this from the outset, when Mullins grabs a John's cell phone and calls his wife, to humiliate him. Not only is this a grave violation of police procedure and conduct but we immediately regard Mullins' general lack of respect as off putting.Before encountering the villains of the piece, Mullins gets to do battle with a couple of buffoonish petty criminals (including one played by Marlon Wayans), who all seem to be deathly afraid of the loose cannon police detective. Why should we laugh when again, such scenarios are so detached from reality? You might have guessed that 'The Heat' moves along as the prim and proper Ashburn must rely on the street smarts of Mullins, despite their mutual antipathy for one another. Along the way, there are unfunny bits about 'Albino cops' and Boston accents. Too much time is taken up with Mullins' unlikeable family, who mug for the camera, every chance they get. You'll probably recognize Satruday Night Live veteran Jane Curtin, in the thankless role, as Mullins' churlish mother. The comic tone is ruined when Ashburn and Mullins unhappily end up as witnesses to the murder of a drug dealer. Worse is when Ashburn (Bullock) is stabbed in the leg with a knife by one of the bad guys and then crawls around a hospital, desperate for laughs but only ending up, making a complete fool of herself.The mechanics of the plot are equally silly. The protagonists manage to track down an extremely elusive drug dealer, Larkin, from a series of tips from Mullin's tainted brother, Jason. The first tip leads to an abandoned paint factory, where Mullins and Ashburn witness the inappropriate (for this kind of slapstick movie) murder of that drug dealer. Jason's sends Mullins and Ashburn on a wild goose chase when he believes a harmless pleasure cruise boat, is the conduit for a large scale drug deal. I will not chronicle in detail how the rest of the plot resolves itself but suffice it to say that Mullins and Ashburn manage to figure out who Larkin is and Mullins has no guilt feelings about taking him out in a manner most men will find offensive (hint: it has something to do with testicles!).After McCarthy as Mullins manages to offend just about every character she encounters throughout this over long, virtually unfunny narrative, she ends up all buffed up in her dress uniform and receives a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Thus, despite all her prior nastiness, Mullins successfully gains acceptance within her community. Ashburn also gets in on the act by lecturing the males at the police department, that Mullins has more class then any of them. I guess all you have to do if you want your accolades (as a beleaguered female professional), is to shoot some bad-ass guy in the balls.One must conclude that 'The Heat' stands for the kind of unethical and vulgar behavior, that has been formerly reserved for male law enforcement professionals, but now becomes the province of women, who can now gracefully jump in, on the act.If 'The Heat' has provided any service to the curious film goer, it proves that when it comes to comic acting chops, Bullock proves the old adage that the Emperor does indeed, 'have no clothes.' As for McCarthy, they'll never be any surprises from the portly thespian--she'll always try to get laughs through being vulgar. At her best, McCarthy may elicit chuckles through the Three Stooges school of slapstick comedy. But she's guaranteed to muck things up, time and again, by being insufferably rude, crude and boorish, to the nth degree.",1,"'No concept of comedy' Bullock pairs with ubiquitously vulgar McCarthy, in

However, the underlying plot is not complex, but simply more of a means to piggyback the humor between Bullock and McCarthy.Premise: Sandra Bullock's character is a super FBI agent. She is arrogant, demeaning and even worse, female. As a result, she is being bypassed for promotion. So, Bullock's boss makes her a deal. Go to Boston and solve a case and you get the promotion. McCarthy's character is a Boston cop. Rude, crude and lacking in hygiene. She also arrested a suspect in Bullock's FBI case. So guess what? These two clash. Big time.Basically, this movie is 2 hours of Melissa McCarthy seeing how many curse words she can fit into each line. She attempts to make every response as vulgar, nasty, mean and rude as she possibly can. The movie is centered around McCarthy's character which is so overpowering that Bullock is barely noticeable most of the movie. McCarthy is so crass and aggressive she totally dominates every scene.Sandra Bullock is the &#34;straight guy.&#34; She is there so McCarthy can have someone to insult. Bullock's character attempts to verbally compete with McCarthy's but she is simply overpowered. Bullock looks like she wants to cry during the first half of the movie. In the second half, she becomes a mini McCarthy, imitating McCarthy's character. I am surprised Bullock would do a movie like this. She even changes how she talks and dresses.Family friendly: Not at all. Not even a little. It is rated &#34;R.&#34; No nudity, no sex.There are a few rare scenes where there is no cursing and nothing really offensive. This is where the movie shines and is totally hilarious. The bar scene, near the end, had me laughing and snorting.To those that are not bothered by intense profanity and vulgarity, you will probably love this movie. To those of you that find such behavior negative, then avoid this movie like the Black Plague. I am kinda in the middle, hence the 3 stars, but I felt that McCarthy's character was so extreme that it severely detracted from the humor. If this movie is closed captioned, I cannot image the number of times the typist had to insert the &#34;F&#34; word.My review is not an exaggeration nor a condemnation of the cursing or vulgarity. However, although it was rated &#34;R,&#34; I was not expecting it to be so severe and overwhelming. I know my review seems to concentrate on this a lot, but this is what the majority of the movie concentrates upon. If you have ever seen Eddie Murphy's &#34;Raw&#34; this is similar in language.",3,"It is rated ""R"" for a reason.

Instead of the pageant scene, though, this time it's the rough streets and rougher people of South Boston. And, instead of a solo undercover operation, this one turns into a buddy-cop flick, with Bullock's prim and by-the-book character grating against a foul-mouthed but effective native. The plot goes as you might expect - so, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll let you see it play itself out. Given so predictable a plot, the entertainment comes wholly from the main characters. Great entertainment, but not for those with delicate ears.But, since Miss Congeniality was so effective, they recycled more than just the character. The boozy buddy-bonding scene gets reused, too. If you're looking for something new and different, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. Instead, this is like comfort food: familiar, cozy, and nothing to think too hard about.

This movie is about FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn, who contains traits of high confidence and maturity, who is set up with police officer Shannon Mullins, who is very vulgar and unique in her approach at work, on a case. Throughout their adventure together they clash, learn about their different lives, teach each other, and solve the case with hard work and determination. While it was all predictable, what I found especially refreshing about this plot was that there was no real romantic sideline. It just focused on the women's friendship and bond together. It was extremely funny in both dialogue and action, Melissa McCarthy stealing the show and Sandra Bullock making a great sidekick for the film.I would highly reccomend The Heat to both women and men who enjoy good laughs and fun.
