It has a fun story as well if you are into anime like i am, then you can't go wrong with such a buy! Make sure to get the 1st season or watch it before buying incase it is not for you. This anime is about a almost normal guy in which gets killed walking home one night from a store, then someone or something brings him back to life (don't wanna spoil the show), and he becomes a zombie. Later on in the show he gains extra powers by mistake from another char in the show, which she is not to pleased about. There are only a few anime that really fit this style. Here are a few i like that are a little bit like this one.  1)vampire + rosario  2)heaven's lost property  3)Sekirei season 1 and 2. 4) Cat planet cuties (one of my fav).  These are all very much alike in some ways, also note that i did not place them in any order , all are just random. They all have what people tend to call &#34;Fan service&#34;, I enjoy all of theses anime.The 1st time i saw this anime it took me half a episode to get into it, then i got hooked, don't know why really i guess i love the plot lol. Me any my brother are anime collectors so we have a lot of anime of course, and i just recently bought the 2nd season Is this a Zombie.
