Was this affair emotional or physical or both? My husband and I both discussed this.  Comparing the movie with our married friends lives, as well as our own, we saw a true depiction of how a mariage can grow stale and not meet our preconceived notions.I can only believe that individually we are responsible for our own personal growth, our happiness.  When you marry, that is the person they will always be, no matter what the changes in life, deep down.  We have had examples, methods etc. that we adapt as we go along but you cannot expect to change someone.  You will be sorely disappointed.Unfortunately, we don't always grow at the same pace and same direction.

788626,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0000X2EJ2,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[3, 4]","Marriage is a crazy dance many people in our modern Cosmopolotian world choose not to take.  The apostle Paul warned young men that it's a better life not to be married and yet here we are in 2004 with hundreds of Divorces daily, and still men and women walk down that isle into eternity.  People are pledging their lives to one another.  Marriage still goes on even if society and our own greed and selfishness tries to break it down.It wasn't until I sat down and watched THE SECRET LIVES OF DENTISTS that I  realized how many movies are about real Marriages.  Hollywood seems preoccupied with fake superficail stories where things sometimes go wrong, and yet by the end everybody loves each other, or they like to focus on the romance, or the out and out horror of it all.  But let be honest and ask the question why hasn't anyone really attempted to look at marriage in the context of what it is: a union of two people, with fears, feelings, and a deep angst.Marriage is not unlike teeth.  They are strong, you can grind away at them and yet they stay rock hard.  But you must take care of teeth, if you don't they break apart.  Improper dental hygene will cause cavaities at first, but if you progress your gums can bleed, they can get filled with puss, they can rot and they can finally fall out.  Marriage like teeth can fall apart if you don't fix it.In the SECRET LIFE OF DENTISTS we meet Dave (Campbell Scott, The Spainish Prisoner) and his wife (Hope Davis, Nest Stop Wonderland).  They share a profitable life and dental pratice together.  They have three beautiful daughters, and a marriage that is as common as any.  That is until Dave catches his wife in what he thinks is an affair. The rest of the film is a dark and humorous, silly and tragic spirial into the worst and best of what makes marriages what they are.Director Alan Rudolph (Trixie) takes what could be an average slice of life and elevates it with well placed dark humor.  He also gives Dave his own id, in the form of Denis Leary.  Leary plays the part of the crotchety guy with a kind of subtle bravaura.  Sure we've seen him play it a thousand time before but the way Scott reacts to it, its priceless.Scott and Davis have a really good chemistry together.  The film cast them perfecty because you feel the anguish and the grapsing for each other.  It works because although they're pulling apart from eachother.  They are grapsing at the same time.  IUT makes for tension that feels real and not forced.At the end of the day the Scret life of Dentists is about wht makes us human and what draws us togther and what utltimatly keeps us togther as well.",4,A Ode to Real Life,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,2635,"['Marriage', 'crazy', 'dance', 'many', 'people', 'modern', 'Cosmopolotian', 'world', 'choose', 'not', 'take', 'apostle', 'Paul', 'warned', 'young', 'men', 'better', 'life', 'not', 'be', 'married', 'yet', 'here', 'are', '2004', 'hundreds', 'Divorces', 'daily', 'still', 'men', 'women', 'walk', 'isle', 'eternity', 'People', 'are', 'pledging', 'lives', 'one', 'Marriage', 'still', 'even', 'society', 'own', 'greed', 'selfishness', 'tries', 'break', 'down.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'DENTISTS', 'realized', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'real', 'Marriages', 'Hollywood', 'preoccupied', 'fake', 'superficail', 'stories', 'where', 'things', 'sometimes', 'go', 'wrong', 'yet', 'end', 'everybody', 'other', 'like', 'focus', 'romance', 'out', 'horror', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'ask', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'really', 'attempted', 'look', 'marriage', 'context', 'what', 'union', 'two', 'people', 'fears', 'feelings', 'deep', 'angst.Marriage', 'not', 'teeth', 'are', 'strong', 'can', 'grind', 'away', 'yet', 'stay', 'rock', 'hard', 'must', 'take', 'care', 'teeth', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'apart', 'Improper', 'dental', 'hygene', 'will', 'cause', 'cavaities', 'first', 'progress', 'gums', 'can', 'bleed', 'can', 'get', 'filled', 'puss', 'can', 'rot', 'can', 'finally', 'fall', 'out', 'Marriage', 'teeth', 'can', 'fall', 'apart', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'it.In', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'DENTISTS', 'meet', 'Dave', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Spainish', 'Prisoner', 'wife', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Nest', 'Stop', 'Wonderland', 'share', 'profitable', 'life', 'dental', 'pratice', 'together', 'have', 'three', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'marriage', 'as', 'common', 'Dave', 'wife', 'what', 'affair', 'rest', 'film', 'dark', 'humorous', 'silly', 'tragic', 'spirial', 'worst', 'best', 'what', 'marriages', 'what', 'are.Director', 'Alan', 'Rudolph', 'Trixie', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'average', 'slice', 'life', 'well', 'placed', 'dark', 'humor', 'also', 'Dave', 'own', 'id', 'form', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Leary', 'part', 'crotchety', 'guy', 'kind', 'subtle', 'bravaura', 'Sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'thousand', 'time', 'way', 'Scott', 'priceless.Scott', 'Davis', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'film', 'cast', 'perfecty', 'feel', 'anguish', 'grapsing', 'other', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'apart', 'eachother', 'are', 'grapsing', 'same', 'time', 'IUT', 'tension', 'feels', 'real', 'not', 'forced.At', 'end', 'day', 'Scret', 'life', 'Dentists', 'wht', 'human', 'what', 'togther', 'what', 'utltimatly', 'togther', 'as', 'well']",N/A

They share a practice and, seemingly have a happy marriage. David has a patient who seems a little off kilter. Later, as he attends an opera in which Dana has a bit part, he sees her backstage in the arms of another man. He begins to hallucinate as this strange, hostile patient, played by Dennis Leary, becomes his alter ego, giving him advice on how to deal with his wife and three young daughters. There is a lot for him to cope with. It is not clear whether Dana has been sexually unfaithful but, in David's mind, she was. Meanwhile, raising his daughters is a challenge, icluding bouts with the flu in which all members of the family, one by one, have vomiting fits.His hallucinations of this alter ego cause him to straddle a very fine line between coping and going over the edge. He was in a troubled marriage and the ""advice"" from the patient may have been the only way he could deal with the stress. On the other hand, as he followed the advice, he exhibited behavior which was inappropriate and bordered on the dangerous. This movie is suspenseful in that it is never clear, until the end, whether David will become dangerously detached from reality or whether his coping mechanism will enable him to get his life and marriage back together.If you like offbeat, comedy/dramas with a dark side, I recommend this DVD.",5,Will he cope or go over the edge?,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1421,"['David', 'Hurst', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'wife', 'Dana', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'are', 'husband', 'wife', 'dentist', 'team', 'share', 'practice', 'seemingly', 'have', 'happy', 'marriage', 'David', 'patient', 'who', 'little', 'off', 'kilter', 'Later', 'opera', 'Dana', 'bit', 'part', 'backstage', 'arms', 'man', 'hallucinate', 'strange', 'hostile', 'patient', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'alter', 'ego', 'giving', 'advice', 'how', 'deal', 'wife', 'three', 'young', 'daughters', 'lot', 'cope', 'not', 'clear', 'Dana', 'been', 'sexually', 'unfaithful', 'David', 'mind', 'was', 'Meanwhile', 'raising', 'daughters', 'challenge', 'icluding', 'bouts', 'flu', 'members', 'family', 'one', 'one', 'have', 'vomiting', 'fits.His', 'hallucinations', 'alter', 'ego', 'cause', 'straddle', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'coping', 'going', 'edge', 'was', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'advice', 'patient', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'deal', 'stress', 'other', 'hand', 'followed', 'advice', 'exhibited', 'behavior', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'bordered', 'dangerous', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'never', 'clear', 'end', 'David', 'will', 'become', 'dangerously', 'detached', 'reality', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'will', 'enable', 'get', 'life', 'marriage', 'back', 'offbeat', 'comedy/dramas', 'dark', 'side', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A
788628,A2CCWUHE0Q4G1M,B0000X2EJ2,Doran Steele,"[2, 3]","With a title like ""The Secret Lives of Dentists,""  one almost expects a muck raking portrayal and a series of shocking revelations about the secret exploits of dental professionals.  Instead, we find out that dentists are normal people leading normal lives with normal problems.  The plot revolves around how the husband dentist suspects that the wife dentist may be having an affair.To be fair, the idea of ""secret lives"" does come into play:  the wife has a not-so-secret life in the form of her increasingly obvious affair and the husband has a secret fantasy life in which his suspicions and frustrations play out.  The most interesting scenes of the film take place in the latter, where the husband has a running conversation with his darker alter ego in the guise of one of his rude patients.  There are a couple of zany fantasy sequences--I liked the ""dental identification"" scene, but I found the family beat down ""kick her out of the house"" scene to be tasteless.The biggest problem of the film is lack of character development.  We see very little of the motivations of the wife and no direct scenes involving her affair--this character plays more of a role in the film through her conspicuous absences than through anything she says or does.  The husband fairs little better:  At the beginning of the film the husband is a put-upon loser and at the end of the film he is a put-upon loser who has let his wife know that he knows about the affair.  Even the moment when the dental hygienist seems to be fleetingly interested in the husband turns out to be nothing more than pity for a cuckold.  After all of his interior conversations with his patient/alter ego, the husband decides that it would be too inconvenient and too much hassle to rock the boat of his comfortable middle-class life by putting any substantial effort into his relationship with his wife.  While I disagreed with most of the input of the patient/alter ego, I do share his disgust that the husband couldn't amount to more--it's hard to root for someone who chooses a living room full of nice furniture over love, happiness, self-respect and dignity.",2,No character development in this character-driven drama,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,2130,"['title', 'Secret', 'Dentists', 'one', 'almost', 'muck', 'raking', 'portrayal', 'series', 'shocking', 'revelations', 'secret', 'exploits', 'dental', 'professionals', 'Instead', 'find', 'out', 'dentists', 'are', 'normal', 'people', 'leading', 'normal', 'lives', 'normal', 'problems', 'plot', 'how', 'husband', 'dentist', 'wife', 'dentist', 'may', 'be', 'having', 'affair.To', 'be', 'fair', 'idea', 'secret', 'lives', 'come', 'play', 'wife', 'not-so-secret', 'life', 'form', 'increasingly', 'obvious', 'affair', 'husband', 'secret', 'fantasy', 'life', 'suspicions', 'frustrations', 'play', 'out', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'latter', 'where', 'husband', 'running', 'conversation', 'darker', 'alter', 'ego', 'guise', 'one', 'rude', 'patients', 'are', 'couple', 'zany', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'liked', 'dental', 'identification', 'scene', 'found', 'family', 'beat', 'kick', 'house', 'scene', 'be', 'tasteless.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'motivations', 'wife', 'direct', 'scenes', 'involving', 'affair', 'character', 'more', 'role', 'film', 'conspicuous', 'absences', 'anything', 'husband', 'little', 'better', 'beginning', 'film', 'husband', 'put-upon', 'loser', 'end', 'film', 'put-upon', 'loser', 'who', 'let', 'wife', 'know', 'affair', 'Even', 'moment', 'when', 'dental', 'hygienist', 'be', 'fleetingly', 'interested', 'husband', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'pity', 'cuckold', 'interior', 'conversations', 'patient/alter', 'ego', 'husband', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'inconvenient', 'too', 'much', 'hassle', 'rock', 'boat', 'comfortable', 'middle-class', 'life', 'putting', 'substantial', 'effort', 'relationship', 'wife', 'disagreed', 'most', 'input', 'patient/alter', 'ego', 'do', 'share', 'disgust', 'husband', 'could', ""n't"", 'amount', 'more', 'hard', 'root', 'someone', 'who', 'living', 'room', 'full', 'nice', 'furniture', 'love', 'happiness', 'self-respect', 'dignity']",N/A

My wife is seeing another man, and I don't kick her out of the house. She doesn't kick me out. I can't imagine kicking anyone out of the house. Do you kick them? Or do you... kick them?&quot;Campbell Scott has always been one of my favorite actors, and his performance as a somewhat repressed, subdued and not very socially adept dentist is excellent and compelling. It slowly dawns on his character, Dave Hurst, that his wife is seeing another man. The distance between his wife, Dana (who is also a partner in their shared dental practice), and him grows while both try to carry on with their lives as normal. Sadly I think the movie with its deliberate and slow pace reflects accurately the non-communicative state of many marriages. People becomeso busy and wrapped up in the daily grind (in the case of the Hursts, they have three small children, none of whom seem to like their mother very much). Dave struggles not only with expressing himself but with the question of why his wifelooks at him, as he puts it, &quot;with regret&quot; rather than with desire. Dave's frustrations, questions and suspicions finally boil over when he treats a rather belligerent, cantankerous patient (Denis Leary), and Dave imagines the patient is following him around, provoking him and making him think about his relationship to Dana.Dave is not interested in confrontation with Dana because he is not interested in taking action. He fears the adverse consequences if he were to confront her. What if Dana wanted to leave him for someone else? What if their marriage split up? He was more willing to accept doing nothing to maintain a strained status quo. As the relationship becomes more strained, and as Dave personifies many of the qualities he imagines his belligerent patient to have, there are physical repercussions in the family... the entire family gets violently ill, with theoldest daughter manifesting ongoing symptoms of nausea brought on by stress and anxiety (which is she clearly sensing in the household).Overall I felt this movie was well done. The performances were excellent (cannot really complain about Hope Davis and Campbell Scott), the mundane quality of daily life and the sometimes silent suffering and lack of understanding that accompanies the tedium is captured here. As Dana comes alive in the beginning ina community theater musical, and the let down that comes when the production ends, she embodies a person emotionally distraught at having lost some kind of passion. Most telling, she cries about the end of this period of artistic expression, freedom, and Dave does not notice. Dave and Dana share aconversation at one point in the movie about whether they are really friends with each other. Dana always felt their marriage would grow wider and larger, but she only saw that it became smaller.

788633,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0000X2EJ2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","""The Secret Lives of Dentists"" is an interesting, low-key, and mature film about the life of a dentist. It's odd and that oddness makes it perfect, until halfway into the movie (which I'll get too). It's got a great cast that features Campbell Scott (The Dying Gaul), Hope Davis (The Weather Man), Robin Tunney (TV's ""Prison Break""), and Denis Leary (Jesus' Son). Scott, Davis, & Leary deliver some of the best performances of their career, without even trying. Scott plays Dave Hurst, a dentist who seems to have a perfect life. He's got a thriving dental practice that he shares with his wife Dana (Davis), he's got a nice house, and three young daughters. Everything's perfect. But then, when he drops his wife of at an opera that she's in he catches her in the arms of another man. Trying not to think about it, and succeeding for a while, Dave eventually begins harboring semi-sexual & violent fantasies that are brought on by an alter-ego named Slater (Leary, who's very very good).This alter-ego is actually a rude patient that Dave forms into his ego, but it works. Now the first half of the movie (60 minutes or so) is perfect; It captures a low-key sense of real life. In these 60 minutes it's a movie you can rank with ""About Schmidt"" or something like it, but at about this point in the film, the movie takes a different turn. Suddenly, every character gets the flu and we spend the next 35 minutes with a bunch of vomiting characters; Yes, some of these scenes were fine but it lost the magic & momentum that it had in that first 60 minutes. I still liked the movie and I was satisfied with the ending, and even if I didn't like the movie Leary is fascinating to watch. Tunney co-stars as Dave's assistant who shows up in a few of his fantasies, looking very sexy at that.GRADE: B+",4,Perfect...Until The Sickness Begins,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1794,"['Secret', 'Dentists', 'interesting', 'low-key', 'mature', 'film', 'life', 'dentist', 'odd', 'oddness', 'perfect', 'halfway', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'too', 'got', 'great', 'cast', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Dying', 'Gaul', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Weather', 'Man', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'TV', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'Scott', 'Davis', 'Leary', 'deliver', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'even', 'trying', 'Scott', 'Dave', 'Hurst', 'dentist', 'who', 'have', 'perfect', 'life', 'got', 'thriving', 'dental', 'practice', 'shares', 'wife', 'Dana', 'Davis', 'got', 'nice', 'house', 'three', 'young', 'daughters', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'then', 'when', 'wife', 'opera', 'arms', 'man', 'Trying', 'not', 'think', 'succeeding', 'while', 'Dave', 'eventually', 'harboring', 'semi-sexual', 'violent', 'fantasies', 'are', 'brought', 'alter-ego', 'named', 'Slater', 'Leary', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'good', '.This', 'alter-ego', 'actually', 'rude', 'patient', 'Dave', 'forms', 'ego', 'Now', 'first', 'half', 'movie', '60', 'minutes', 'so', 'perfect', 'low-key', 'sense', 'real', 'life', '60', 'minutes', 'movie', 'can', 'rank', 'Schmidt', 'something', 'about', 'point', 'film', 'movie', 'different', 'turn', 'Suddenly', 'character', 'flu', 'spend', 'next', '35', 'minutes', 'bunch', 'vomiting', 'characters', 'Yes', 'scenes', 'were', 'fine', 'lost', 'magic', 'momentum', 'had', 'first', '60', 'minutes', 'still', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Leary', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Tunney', 'co-stars', 'Dave', 'assistant', 'who', 'up', 'few', 'fantasies', 'looking', 'very', 'sexy', 'that.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
788634,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0000X2EJ2,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 4]","I was amazingly moved and impressed by this movie -- but only after I finished watching it.  During the movie, it does plod at an incredibly petty pace, to quote the Bard.  But after the picture was over, I realized that the laborious pace of the film reflected the lives of these two characters.I was greatly impressed by Campbell Scott in the TV movie with Christine Lahti called ""The Pilot's Wife.""  As a result, I tuned into the fact that he is the son of George C. Scott & Colleen Dewhurst, although one can't really see that by his looks.  He's also worked in ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" ""The Imposters"" & ""Lush.""  His career has grown as he's begun to also produce films, as he does here on this project.The thing that I came to so value about this movie was how excellently it reflects on the reality of a man who dearly loves being a husband & father.  It is not always easy, nor is it always glorious & romantic, just as this film was neither of these.  Lost in the march of life, the husband's fantasies help him to work his way through his life.  There's one scene where fantasy Dennis Leary asks David Hurst (Campbell Scott) why he's doing this.  Hurst replies that he went to college, studied dentistry and worked hard just so he could have this.  He says it even though he's in the midst of a highly emotional trauma in his marriage.  It seemed so utterly real to me and incredibly poignant.The other thing I came to value about this film was how important a father's role is in a family and how good of a caregiver a dedicated father can be to his children.  Yes, the whole ongoing flu sequences were laborious and seemed to be a trail of never-ending vomit, but through it all Hurst never wavers in his dedication to his wife or his kids, even when he feels so very ill.  For me, this reflected the strength of a father's love.  I think Campbell Scott wonderfully portrayed this aspect of the film.His wife, Dana Hurst, is played by Hope Davis who has been in ""Daytrippers,"" ""Next Stop Wonderland,"" ""Kiss of Death"" with Nicholas Cage & ""About Schmidt.""  I found disturbing her detachment from her children, but came to understand that she was also going through a tremendous crisis of identity.  Whether her amateur opera acting was a ploy for outside interests or to find romantic stimulation, I don't know.  But for me the climax of the movie, which came without thunder, was all the more powerful.  David Hurst says that he has just one question, ""Are you staying or leaving?""  For all else, he can forgive.  She says, ""I'm staying.""  And that is the climax.  For Hurst, it's enough, all he's wanted.  As a parting shot, he says that he wants to know who it was, but not what they did.Dennis Learly was adept at being obnoxious.  As he moved from the dental chair to David Hurst's fantasy life, he executed it flawlessly.  The deleted scene on the DVD where Leary scrubs Hurst's back in the bathtub was appropriately cut since it suggests a rather strange fantasy, which is not where the film was headed.  But the outtakes are a hoot!  Robin Tunney as the dental assistant has a small but valuable role in the script.  The children all do excellent jobs.  The youngest provides great comic relief by slapping those that distress her.All in all, I wound up loving this film.  I was about ready to turn it off several times, but I'm glad I hung with it.

Sometimes indie films are just as bad as Hollywood films, that's a given, but as with anything, when you find the good stuff, the search was worth it!This movie was fairly depressing, and moved slow, but the pace is fitting and it works for the film. I felt the relationship between Dave and Dana was handled really well. The performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis were wonderful. All the acting in the film was great, especially Denis Leary in this movie, and generally I dislike him(A LOT), and that's good thing for this film!  :DI really enjoyed watching what Dave was going through, it seems to reflect what I'd be thinking if my husband were cheating on me, or  some-what like thoughts I've had about people hating me as well. It is a lot of fun watching him play-out the scenarios in his mind.The main problem with marriages and many relationships is lack of communication (whether they be about financial issues or sexual issues). That's especially true in this film, they've gotten so wrapped up in they're day-to-day lives they don't have real communication about the most basic things. When one of them tries to communicate the other isn't in the mood to listen, of course there's the whole affair thing with his wife, so she is generally unreceptive of his attempts at affection and communication.The only thing I dislike about the movie is just how unsympathetic it is. While makes sense because if you're cheating on somewhat you're not really thinking much about their feelings, or if you are, you block it out, at the same time, the film comes across a bit coldly at times.Overall it is worth a view for people who want an honest look at marriage.

788640,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0000X2EJ2,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","Dave (Campbell Scott) and Dana Hurst (Hope Davis) are married dentists who share a practice, two lovely homes, and three young daughters. Ten years of marriage has brought  many successes but left them disinterested and unable to enjoy each other's company. When Dave sees Dana speaking to another man backstage at her amateur opera production, he interprets a simple gesture as an indication of infidelity. Exacerbated by Dana's unusually prolonged errands, Dave's frustration comes out in the form of daydreams in which he is goaded by an alter-ego (Denis Leary). Being cloistered together for 5 days while the flu makes its way through the family may or may not bring tensions out into the open.&quot;The Secret Lives of Dentists&quot; has been adapted by Craig Lucas from Jane Smiley's novella &quot;The Age of Grief&quot;, which borrows some of its ideas from James Thurber's short story &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;. Like Walter Mitty, Dave Hurst is frustrated and bored and daydreams a lot as a result. He dreams of the relationship he used to have with his wife, and he imagines scenarios for his marriage's current condition. &quot;The Secret Lives of Dentists&quot; is essentially a &quot;relationship movie&quot;, but one in which people deal with their discontent by avoiding one another. Dave and Dana don't communicate what they feel or think. Their interactions are brief and usually dishonest. We see what is going through Dave's mind, so we come to  understand him. I don't think we ever fully understand Dana, but neither does her husband. Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are two of cinema's best character actors, and they do a convincing job of these two ordinary people who stopped working at their relationship at some point and woke up later to find that their marriage has turned into something neither of them expected or wanted. There are some darkly comic moments in the film, and I appreciate director Alan Rudolph's ability to see the humor in the Hursts' strife. Recommended as the trials of an affluent suburban marriage with an interesting twist and talented cast.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Alan Rudolph and actor  Campbell Scott, &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; featurette, a blooper reel, and some deleted scenes. The audio commentary is decent. The &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; featurette is one of those that was produced by and aired on the Sundance Channel. It's 25 minutes long. The scene -or scenes- that is discussed is the family's evening at Dana's opera performance, including the scene in which Dave begins to suspect her infidelity, which is the catalyst for the rest of the movie. The writer, producer, director, actors, and others involved with the production of the opera sequence are interviewed. This is a good featurette for aspiring filmmakers. I recommend the &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; and then the audio commentary if your interest has not be quenched or you want  to explore a different scene.

788641,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000X2EJ2,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","Despite all the work they have done during their careers, very few viewers will have even seen anything that Campbell Scott or Hope Davis has appeared in, or for that matter very little of what Alan Rudolph has directed. Which is probably a good thing because ""The Secret Lives of Dentists"" is supposed to reach out to viewers with a relatively typical marriage they can relate to, and the identification process is aided by using actors with little historical baggage to get in the way.This is an ordinary story more suited to its original form, a novelette (""The Age of Grief"") by Jane Smiley. As a film this type story is simply boring. Recognizing this reality, the screenwriter and the director tried using movie storytelling devices like flashbacks, visions, and slow motion. While these do make things more interesting, they also create confusion, as the younger ""flashback"" Dave (Scott) is sometimes hard to distinguish from his visions of Dana's lovers. Also it is often hard to distinguish (out of context) what is flashback, vision, and reality. Blame both the director and the postproduction people because the only visual difference is a slight bleach processing of the regular film stock for the visions (giving them less color and more contrast) and the use of cross-processed reversal film stock for the flashbacks (giving them slightly brighter colors).Compound this by recurrent appearances in the reality segments of Dave's fantesy alter ego Slater (Denis Leary), an angry patient who frequently has on-screen conversations with Dave, these jump start Dave's passive-aggressive personality. Other than Dave, only Stephanie (the middle daughter) ever actually sees the fantasy Slater, and only in her flu fever delirium. She orders her dad's ghosts to leave (""it's my house"") which causes her father to stop the Slater manifestations soon after. The best part of Slater is how he typically appears out of nowhere, disconcerting to the audience but not even startling to Dave.The writers are big on using dental issues as metaphors for marriage and life. The main one of these involves Slater's wisdom teeth, which are coming in all wrong. He refuses to get them pulled, they are not so bad that they cannot continue to be ignored. Likewise the marriage could go on as long as Dave and Dana avoid confronting and dealing with the suspected affair.While some viewers will really connect with this film, mainstream viewers will be either bored or irritated. Bored because this is a minimalist movie that was made that way to illustrate the idea that marriage is all about the details-unfortunately most of these details are boring. Irritating because the story requires that neither Dave nor Dana be particularly likable or admirable. Both performances are solid but Scott can't really show much of what Dave is really about even though the story is told from his point of view, he can be interpreted as both hero and coward, making a sympathetic audience connection generally impossible. Likewise Davis is not permitted to portray Dana as anything but the subject of yet another fruitless examination of the mysteries of female discontent. It is a nice role for Davis as she contrasts Dana's rapture when performing in the local opera (Verdi's ""Nabucco"") with the pervasive boredom of her real life.The film's saviors are the three little actresses who play the couple's children. Credit the writer and director for capturing what is arguably the most realistic portrayal of children in any film. Children under age ten have little mastery of the acting craft, while these girls are no exception they obviously brought a professional dedication to their involvement and somehow each just got it. Rudolph knows how to direct them and how to stay within their limitations. I particularly enjoyed Leah, the youngest, greeting her father with repeated ""Hi Dad's"" until he finally focused his attention on her.Then again, what do I know?

Their marriage seems ideal, with their successful practice, two homes, and three beautiful children.  However, the idyllic appearance of their relationship belies the festering problems brought on by years of neglect and passivity.Director Alan Rudolph is known for highly stylized films that examine the complications of relationships, such as &quot;Choose Me&quot; and &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  What his works often lacks in realism, he makes up for by eliciting gorgeous performances from his cast.  Scott brings great subtlety to his character - a submissive man who refuses to fight for his crumbling marriage.  Davis is also excellent, managing to make her character sympathetic despite her actions.Overall, &quot;The Secret Lives of Dentists&quot; is perhaps the best Rudolph film I've seen, and the script and acting is often quite perceptive.  However, it ultimately falls flat in several ways.  In particular, the film takes an ugly turn with the character played by Denis Leary - a devil's advocate type who attempts to goad Scott into action.  The movie really loses traction with every scene in which Leary plays a key role.  In addition, the tone of the film is strangely aloof, and I found myself struggling to connect with the characters or become involved emotionally.  In sum, the film is an above average and quirky look at modern marriages with some very good acting.Extras - Plenty of extras including an episode from the Sundance Channel's show &quot;Anatomy of a Scene,&quot; which dissects the opera scene.",3,Scenes from a Modern Marriage,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,1689,"['Secret', 'Dentists', 'documents', 'seemingly', 'typical', 'marriage', 'two', 'dentists', 'played', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'who', 'are', 'joint', 'practice', 'marriage', 'ideal', 'successful', 'practice', 'two', 'homes', 'three', 'beautiful', 'children', 'However', 'idyllic', 'appearance', 'relationship', 'festering', 'problems', 'brought', 'years', 'neglect', 'passivity.Director', 'Alan', 'Rudolph', 'known', 'highly', 'stylized', 'films', 'examine', 'complications', 'relationships', 'such', 'quot', 'Choose', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Afterglow.', 'quot', 'What', 'works', 'often', 'realism', 'up', 'eliciting', 'gorgeous', 'performances', 'cast', 'Scott', 'great', 'subtlety', 'character', 'submissive', 'man', 'who', 'fight', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'Davis', 'also', 'excellent', 'managing', 'make', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'actions.Overall', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Dentists', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Rudolph', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'script', 'acting', 'often', 'quite', 'perceptive', 'However', 'ultimately', 'flat', 'several', 'ways', 'particular', 'film', 'ugly', 'turn', 'character', 'played', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'devil', 'advocate', 'type', 'who', 'goad', 'Scott', 'action', 'movie', 'really', 'traction', 'scene', 'Leary', 'key', 'role', 'addition', 'tone', 'film', 'strangely', 'aloof', 'found', 'struggling', 'connect', 'characters', 'become', 'involved', 'emotionally', 'sum', 'film', 'above', 'average', 'quirky', 'look', 'modern', 'marriages', 'very', 'good', 'acting.Extras', 'Plenty', 'extras', 'including', 'episode', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'show', 'quot', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'quot', 'opera', 'scene']",N/A
