Julian dominates the last half of season five because he is very ill.  This illness forces him to make choices both personally and professionally that he would have rather avoided making for the rest of his life. Liz figures prominently in these choices, especially since Julian wants to fully provide for Wilbur. There is an absolutely hilarious event which occurs when Julian hires another plastic surgeon to come on board to help Sean as his condition worsens.  Both Julian and Sean catch this guy making love to their FURNITURE and Julian is just outraged.  How dare this guy come in and ravish his.....sofa!  Sean's love life continues to ricochet with bizarre choices while he never really seems to move beyond Julia. He also continues to explore his life in tv now that he is needed in LA LA land for series tv. There are some fascinating plastic surgery cases too, as per usual. The final few episodes though have you hanging on every moment as to what will happen to Julian as you are afraid he is about to be lost forever to Nip n Tuck.  This is well worth watching but one does not need to own it.  I cannot envision going back to watch this again and again.
