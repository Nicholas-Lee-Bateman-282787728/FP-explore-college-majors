After seeing this film, I really appreciate more their musicianship. It's good to know a band can stay a band for life with very few personal changes.

1345328,AGEIT17HENDIS,B003GCMX5Y,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","In the old days, the old high school days when such things mattered, my best friend at North Adamsville High School (we actually went back to old North Adamsville Middle School days together), Frankie, Francis Xavier Riley to give his full moniker, spent endless hours arguing over the merits of The Beatles vs. The Rolling Stones as the primo rock band of the times. The times being the early 1960s, the time of the edge, just the wee edge of the beginning of the uprisings associated with our generation, the generation of '68.I will get into the specifics of that Frankie controversy a little later but for the purposes of this review of a film documentary about the making of the Stones' 1972 album, Exile on Main Street, the real controversy is over whether this album was their best ever or not. At that point Frankie and I had lost contact so that I will just give as my opinion that for pure blues-ness, pure Stones' foundational blue-ness, for country rooted-ness, and for musicianship it is hard to argue that any other Stones album was better. And that opinion, now with the benefit of the documentary footage and current interviews with many of the personalities from Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to the sidemen, hangers-on, gofers, and their manager during this period, Marshall Chess (son of the legendary blues label founder, Leonard Chess), about how it was produced, and what it all meant, still holds up.I noted in the headline that in the 1960s we, at least those of us who were politically alienated from mainstream Western social norms or at wits end for some other more personal reasons, were all exiles on Main Street. Main Street being a convenient term of art for all that was square, not cool, up-tight, piggish, and a thousand other words we used to separate our youth culture out from the ticky-tack little white house with the picket fence dream that passed for social reality then (and, unfortunately, now, well kind of now). For the Stones this notion of exile, self-imposed exile, not glad-tiding self-imposed exile to hear the lads now, had another element. They had to flee England in order to escape from some terrible tax burdens that had accumulated and for which they did not have control over solving (or money to pay). So off to the south of France they go, to live and to produce the new album and in order to get some dough.Of course, with such well-known edge city crazies as Mick and Keith this was not going to be a Sunday in the park. Along the way they picked up musicians, groupies, hangers-on, bag men, bad guys, dope dealers and everyone with a little cache who could get to France and be around the scene. And that scene included, surprise, surprise, dope of every kind- from pills to smack (heroin, then, as now, not a ""cool"" drug staple), booze by the buckets full, sex, women and everything else under the sun. Let's leave it that the scene was the epitome of the slogan ""drug, sex and rock and roll"" and along with the expression ""live fast, die young and make a good corpse""  will get you the flavor of  what went on just about right. Oh ya, in case you forgot, it also included an incredible amount of work by Mick and Keith writing material, all members playing riffs until arms got sore, throats died and fingers began to bleed. Not a recipe that your mothers would suggest for making successful careers, of any kind. But just the right recipe to unleash the rock energy built up in one of the great rock bands that every exited, then and AARP and old age home-worthy now.Take an hour out and look at some serious rock history. Then go up in the attic and dust off the album, or check it out in your CD collection, or download it to your iPOD, or Google it on YouTube but listen to it. Especially the blues-ish stuff like Tumbling Dice (that will get even grandpa out of his rocking chair); Sweet Virginia; Sweet Black Angel; and the rootsy (Robert Johnson rootsy) Stop Breaking Down.",4,We Were All Exiles On Main Street,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,3945,"['old', 'days', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'when', 'such', 'things', 'mattered', 'best', 'friend', 'North', 'Adamsville', 'High', 'School', 'actually', 'went', 'back', 'old', 'North', 'Adamsville', 'Middle', 'School', 'days', 'together', 'Frankie', 'Francis', 'Xavier', 'Riley', 'give', 'full', 'moniker', 'spent', 'endless', 'hours', 'arguing', 'merits', 'Beatles', 'vs', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'primo', 'rock', 'band', 'times', 'times', 'being', 'early', '1960s', 'time', 'edge', 'just', 'wee', 'edge', 'beginning', 'uprisings', 'associated', 'generation', 'generation', ""'68.I"", 'will', 'get', 'specifics', 'Frankie', 'controversy', 'little', 'later', 'purposes', 'review', 'film', 'documentary', 'making', 'Stones', '1972', 'album', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'real', 'controversy', 'album', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'not', 'point', 'Frankie', 'had', 'lost', 'contact', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'opinion', 'pure', 'blues-ness', 'pure', 'Stones', 'foundational', 'blue-ness', 'country', 'rooted-ness', 'musicianship', 'hard', 'argue', 'other', 'Stones', 'album', 'was', 'better', 'opinion', 'now', 'benefit', 'documentary', 'footage', 'current', 'interviews', 'many', 'personalities', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'sidemen', 'hangers-on', 'gofers', 'manager', 'period', 'Marshall', 'Chess', 'son', 'legendary', 'blues', 'label', 'founder', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'how', 'was', 'produced', 'what', 'meant', 'still', 'up.I', 'noted', 'headline', '1960s', 'least', 'who', 'were', 'politically', 'alienated', 'mainstream', 'Western', 'social', 'norms', 'wits', 'end', 'other', 'more', 'personal', 'reasons', 'were', 'exiles', 'Main', 'Street', 'Main', 'Street', 'being', 'convenient', 'term', 'art', 'was', 'square', 'not', 'cool', 'up-tight', 'piggish', 'thousand', 'other', 'words', 'used', 'separate', 'youth', 'culture', 'ticky-tack', 'little', 'white', 'house', 'picket', 'fence', 'dream', 'passed', 'social', 'reality', 'then', 'unfortunately', 'now', 'well', 'kind', 'now', 'Stones', 'notion', 'exile', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'not', 'glad-tiding', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'hear', 'lads', 'now', 'had', 'element', 'had', 'flee', 'England', 'order', 'escape', 'terrible', 'tax', 'had', 'accumulated', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'control', 'solving', 'money', 'pay', 'So', 'south', 'France', 'go', 'live', 'produce', 'new', 'album', 'order', 'get', 'dough.Of', 'course', 'such', 'well-known', 'edge', 'city', 'crazies', 'Mick', 'Keith', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Sunday', 'park', 'way', 'picked', 'up', 'musicians', 'groupies', 'hangers-on', 'bag', 'men', 'bad', 'guys', 'dope', 'dealers', 'everyone', 'little', 'cache', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'France', 'be', 'scene', 'scene', 'included', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'dope', 'kind-', 'pills', 'smack', 'heroin', 'then', 'now', 'not', 'cool', 'drug', 'staple', 'booze', 'buckets', 'full', 'sex', 'women', 'everything', 'else', 'sun', 'Let', 'leave', 'scene', 'was', 'epitome', 'slogan', 'drug', 'sex', 'rock', 'roll', 'expression', 'live', 'fast', 'die', 'young', 'make', 'good', 'corpse', 'will', 'get', 'flavor', 'what', 'went', 'just', 'right', 'Oh', 'ya', 'case', 'forgot', 'also', 'included', 'incredible', 'amount', 'work', 'Mick', 'Keith', 'writing', 'material', 'members', 'playing', 'riffs', 'arms', 'got', 'sore', 'throats', 'died', 'fingers', 'began', 'bleed', 'Not', 'recipe', 'mothers', 'would', 'suggest', 'making', 'successful', 'careers', 'kind', 'just', 'right', 'recipe', 'unleash', 'rock', 'energy', 'built', 'up', 'one', 'great', 'rock', 'bands', 'exited', 'then', 'AARP', 'old', 'age', 'home-worthy', 'now.Take', 'hour', 'look', 'serious', 'rock', 'history', 'Then', 'go', 'up', 'attic', 'dust', 'off', 'album', 'check', 'out', 'CD', 'collection', 'download', 'iPOD', 'Google', 'YouTube', 'Especially', 'blues-ish', 'stuff', 'Tumbling', 'Dice', 'will', 'get', 'even', 'grandpa', 'rocking', 'chair', 'Sweet', 'Virginia', 'Sweet', 'Black', 'Angel', 'rootsy', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'rootsy', 'Stop', 'Breaking', 'Down']",N/A

There's lots of great old and new footage of the Stones, plenty of interesting discussion of the album's creation and its meaning from the band members and from such luminaries as Martin Scorsese and Jack White of the White Stipes, cool bonus features, etc. But EXILE isn't really an album you get into by watching a documentary about it and then going out and buying it; it's an album (as the wonderful Liz Phair indicates in a special feature interview on the DVD) that you develop a personal relationship with over time, the way you would with a great film or a classic novel - a rich, ambiguous work whose meaning is different for everyone and which will only be revealed to you, after many, many listens, in the fullness of time.",4,Great For The Already-Converted; For the Rest Of The World...?,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,1053,"['DVD', 'was', 'easy', 'sell', 'EXILE', 'ON', 'MAIN', 'STREET', 'been', 'album', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fanatical', 'off', 'last', 'quarter-century', 'True', 'story', 'completed', 'undergraduate', 'degree', '1990', 'was', 'seriously', 'considering', 'getting', 'Ph.D.', 'Popular', 'Culture', 'doing', 'doctoral', 'dissertation', 'EXILE', 'lots', 'great', 'old', 'new', 'footage', 'Stones', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'album', 'creation', 'meaning', 'band', 'members', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Jack', 'White', 'White', 'Stipes', 'cool', 'bonus', 'features', 'etc', 'EXILE', ""n't"", 'really', 'album', 'get', 'watching', 'documentary', 'then', 'going', 'buying', 'album', 'wonderful', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'DVD', 'develop', 'personal', 'relationship', 'time', 'way', 'would', 'great', 'film', 'classic', 'novel', 'rich', 'ambiguous', 'work', 'meaning', 'different', 'everyone', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'revealed', 'many', 'many', 'listens', 'fullness', 'time']",N/A

1345331,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B003GCMX5Y,"bass boy ""music fan""","[85, 88]","This is a very good DVD release, although it doesn't seem like the Holy Grail of Glimmer Twins releases we fans have wished for all these years. It's interesting to see footage (and there's a lot of it) from this time period, with snippets of C-S Blues and more of Ladies and Gentlemen thrown in. I could have done without the interviews with Kings of Leon's Caleb Followill, Jack White, Liz Phair and probably Sheryl Crow. White's comments seem to repeat themselves, and while Crow and Phair are OK in the main movie, their cutting-room floor segments on the DVD's bonus features really starts to drag, especially Phair, who comes across as self-absorbed and almost desperate for attention.On the plus side, the interview with Don Was is good, probably the best of the non-Stones interviews, and Black Eyed Peas' Will I. Am gives a decent interview. Much of Mick Taylor's and Bill Wyman's comments are relegated to the bonus features area, but they are seen and heard in the main film, also. And speaking of the main film, it's only 61 minutes in the length, unfortunately. The bonus features bump up the running time on this release. I was hoping for a 2-hour documentary, ""25 X 5""-style, with maybe 30 or 40 minutes of bonus interviews. Not so. It is a short feature, but what is there is pretty cool. To hear Keith Richards reveal why he did heroin in that time period (and presumably for another five or six years) is a revelation, and Wyman's playful jibe at Taylor's comatose-like stage presence during the 1972 shows is hysterical and ironic. Wyman does finally utter something like, ""I'm one to talk.""  ""In 30 years with The Rolling Stones, I maybe took three steps on the stage,"" Wyman says while laughing.""Stones in Exile"" is a good release, but it falls just short of being an immaculate document of one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Maybe Eagle Rock's upcoming DVD release of ""Ladies and Gentlemen ...

1345332,AS558SNWF1DXG,B003GCMX5Y,Clare Quilty,"[8, 10]","I agree with the previous reviewer -- at just about an hour, ""Stones in Exile"" seems to wrap up just as it's getting going, and as a consequence it leaves a lot of biographical territory unexplored (""Hello, Gram Parsons?"").And yet ... this is so much better than I was expecting. Aside from opening and closing segments featuring interviews with celebrity fans of ""Exile on Main St.,"" the bulk of the movie is a well-choreographed montage of clips (footage from ""C.S. Blues"" and ""Ladies & Gentleman..."" plus home movies) and photographs (largely by Dominique Tarle, whose book ""Exile"" is about $1,000 beyond most fans' price ranges).I had no idea there was so much period material out there, and the filmmakers structure it with the songs perfectly. The resulting whole does a great job of putting ""Exile"" into the context of the Stones' history as well as the era in which it was made. Interview audio from the band as well as producer Jimmy Miller, engineer Andy Johns, label head Marshall Chess, actor Jake Weber (who remarkably was, at the time, the son of a member of the Stones' entourage) and Bobby Keyes (who, decades after the fact, still sounds elated to have been there) round out the reporting. And the film also occasionally just sits back and lets songs play out.I'm frequently disappointed in music docs, and as a longtime fan of ""Exile"" I was prepared to be let down (much as I was with the recently released ""sweetened"" extra tracks on the ""Exile re-release).

1345337,A3B8V9P1I5O3UV,B003GCMX5Y,Gary Pig Gold,"[2, 3]","For an album that received such a lukewarm-at-best reception upon its initial release (even the almighty ""Rolling Stone"" Magazine used the words ""overdone blues clich&eacute;"" whilst making snide comparisons to Tommy James), the tenth album produced by Keith Richards and company - ""The fact is that Mick spent most of his time away 'cause Bianca was pregnant; you know, ROYALTY IS HAVING A BABY. So what am I supposed to do?"" the human guitar griped in 1979, ""I'M supposed to be making an album!"" - has certainly enjoyed a critical reappraisal and then some over the ensuing four decades. Why, even the proud papa Jagger who in '72 complained ""This new album is [expletive deleted!] mad. It's very rock and roll. I didn't want it to be like that. I mean, I'm very bored with rock and roll,"" today insists the recording of ""Exile On Main St."" ""was a wonderful period; a very creative period.""And of course ""Rolling Stone"" now places those very same blues clich&eacute;s near the tip-top of most every Greatest Album Of All Time list it regularly publishes in between all the sneaker and suntan cr&egrave;me ads.Now, the (in)famous ""Exile"" has been fully refurbished, re-struck, and reconstituted through and through by a crack crew of audio surgeons headed by honorary Glimmer Twin Don Was, digitally polished to an immaculate sheen, ""correcting"" the original soupy subterranean mixes (""The cymbals sound like dustbin lids"" Mick again complained as ""Tumbling Dice"" was first being readied for release) so as not to have the album stand as too sore a sonic thumb alongside Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber, I suppose. Personally, I much prefer dustbins to ""Just Dance"" ...but I digress.Meanwhile, as part of this gala ""Exile"" resurrection comes an accompanying behind-the-scenes documentary film, ""Stones in Exile,"" which gathers together all five circa-early-Seventies Stones within a wealth of vintage studio (meaning the basement of Richards' villa on the French Riviera, where most of the album's basic tracks were recorded) and on-stage footage (via the post-""Exile"" tour film ""Ladies and Gentlemen... The Rolling Stones,"" which itself is now available). Why, even snippets from the beyond-cult 1972 road-film-from-hell ""CS [sic!] Blues"" are cunningly slipped between shots of various waterskiing and overdubbing Brits-in-, yes, exile.Not so surprisingly however, some subjects (such as the rampant drug use which eventually resulted in Keith's total submission to heroin) are only delicately alluded to, whilst other key players in the scenario - houseguest Gram Parsons, most obviously, who schooled Monsieur Richards especially in nuances of the country blues which permeate the entire ""Exile"" album - are ignored altogether. Plus the ""Stones in Exile"" bonus footage could have been much better filled with, say, a complete study of the original, highly innovative ""Main St."" record cover shoot by ""CS"" director Robert Frank, as opposed to rambling heads the likes of Caleb Followill and Sheryl Crow.Still, the contemporary footage of Mick Jagger and the immaculate-as-ever Charlie Watts wandering around Olympic recording studios and Jagger's former Stargroves estate - sites of the initial ""Exile"" sessions - are both fascinating and entertaining ...in a ""Sunshine Boys"" sort of way (if you get my octogenarian drift). Naturally Keith Richards appears throughout the proceedings in ghostly stark black-and-white, the multitude struggles of '72 still etched deep into his face, whilst good ol' Bill Wyman remains ever the Stone Alone with the most revealing, reproachful, yet detailed reminisces of the bunch (a man still upset, it seems, at not being able to locate a proper brew of British tea in the south of France, for example).So while I may indeed have my doubts over the, um, validity of a vintage-2010 ""Exile On Main St."" album per se, this ""Stones in Exile"" film, far on the other hand, is a perfectly under-polished production which more than succeeds in placing one square down the very depths of Keith Richards' basement during the festering summer of '71 ...yes, with all the horror and gorgeous excess - not to mention utterly magnificent, guttural music - such a locale entails.And somehow, still, continues to inspire.",3,Out Of Exile,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,4238,"['album', 'received', 'lukewarm-at-best', 'reception', 'initial', 'release', 'even', 'almighty', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'Magazine', 'used', 'words', 'overdone', 'blues', 'clich', 'eacute', 'making', 'snide', 'comparisons', 'Tommy', 'James', 'tenth', 'album', 'produced', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'company', 'fact', 'Mick', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'away', 'Bianca', 'was', 'pregnant', 'know', 'ROYALTY', 'IS', 'HAVING', 'A', 'BABY', 'what', 'am', 'supposed', 'do', 'human', 'guitar', 'griped', '1979', ""'M"", 'supposed', 'be', 'making', 'album', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'critical', 'reappraisal', 'then', 'ensuing', 'four', 'decades', 'Why', 'even', 'proud', 'papa', 'Jagger', 'who', ""'72"", 'complained', 'new', 'album', '[', 'expletive', 'deleted', ']', 'mad', 'very', 'rock', 'roll', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'mean', ""'m"", 'very', 'bored', 'rock', 'roll', 'today', 'recording', 'Exile', 'Main', 'St.', 'was', 'wonderful', 'period', 'very', 'creative', 'period', 'course', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'now', 'very', 'same', 'blues', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tip-top', 'most', 'Greatest', 'Album', 'All', 'Time', 'list', 'regularly', 'sneaker', 'suntan', 'cr', 'egrave', 'famous', 'Exile', 'been', 'fully', 'refurbished', 're-struck', 'reconstituted', 'crack', 'crew', 'audio', 'surgeons', 'headed', 'honorary', 'Glimmer', 'Twin', 'Don', 'Was', 'digitally', 'polished', 'immaculate', 'sheen', 'correcting', 'original', 'soupy', 'subterranean', 'mixes', 'cymbals', 'sound', 'dustbin', 'lids', 'Mick', 'again', 'complained', 'Tumbling', 'Dice', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'readied', 'release', 'so', 'not', 'have', 'album', 'stand', 'too', 'sonic', 'thumb', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'suppose', 'Personally', 'much', 'prefer', 'Just', 'Dance', 'digress.Meanwhile', 'part', 'gala', 'Exile', 'resurrection', 'accompanying', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'film', 'Stones', 'Exile', 'together', 'five', 'circa-early-Seventies', 'Stones', 'wealth', 'vintage', 'studio', 'meaning', 'basement', 'Richards', 'villa', 'French', 'Riviera', 'where', 'most', 'album', 'basic', 'tracks', 'were', 'recorded', 'on-stage', 'footage', 'post-', 'Exile', 'tour', 'film', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'now', 'available', 'Why', 'even', 'snippets', 'beyond-cult', '1972', 'road-film-from-hell', 'CS', '[', 'sic', ']', 'Blues', 'are', 'cunningly', 'slipped', 'shots', 'various', 'waterskiing', 'overdubbing', 'Brits-in-', 'yes', 'exile.Not', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'however', 'subjects', 'such', 'rampant', 'drug', 'use', 'eventually', 'resulted', 'Keith', 'total', 'submission', 'heroin', 'are', 'only', 'delicately', 'alluded', 'whilst', 'other', 'key', 'players', 'scenario', 'houseguest', 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'most', 'obviously', 'who', 'schooled', 'Monsieur', 'Richards', 'especially', 'nuances', 'country', 'blues', 'permeate', 'entire', 'Exile', 'album', 'are', 'ignored', 'altogether', 'Stones', 'Exile', 'bonus', 'footage', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'filled', 'say', 'complete', 'study', 'original', 'highly', 'innovative', 'Main', 'St.', 'record', 'cover', 'shoot', 'CS', 'director', 'Robert', 'Frank', 'opposed', 'rambling', 'heads', 'likes', 'Caleb', 'Followill', 'Sheryl', 'Crow.Still', 'contemporary', 'footage', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'immaculate-as-ever', 'Charlie', 'Watts', 'wandering', 'around', 'Olympic', 'recording', 'studios', 'Jagger', 'former', 'Stargroves', 'estate', 'sites', 'initial', 'Exile', 'sessions', 'are', 'fascinating', 'entertaining', 'Sunshine', 'Boys', 'sort', 'way', 'get', 'octogenarian', 'drift', 'Naturally', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'proceedings', 'ghostly', 'stark', 'black-and-white', 'multitude', 'struggles', ""'72"", 'still', 'etched', 'deep', 'face', 'whilst', 'good', 'ol', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'ever', 'Stone', 'Alone', 'most', 'revealing', 'reproachful', 'yet', 'detailed', 'reminisces', 'bunch', 'man', 'still', 'upset', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'locate', 'proper', 'brew', 'British', 'tea', 'south', 'France', 'example', '.So', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'doubts', 'um', 'validity', 'vintage-2010', 'Exile', 'Main', 'St.', 'album', 'se', 'Stones', 'Exile', 'film', 'far', 'other', 'hand', 'perfectly', 'under-polished', 'production', 'more', 'placing', 'one', 'square', 'very', 'depths', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'basement', 'festering', 'summer', ""'71"", 'yes', 'horror', 'gorgeous', 'excess', 'not', 'mention', 'utterly', 'magnificent', 'guttural', 'music', 'locale', 'entails.And', 'somehow', 'still', 'inspire']",N/A

But this is a big moment in the history of the band - a make or break point. It is the children left to their own devices, except that they are not such little kids anymore. All the minders are gone and they have left home, see what happens... As for the documentary, there has been a lot of criticism of the lack of actual film footage and the use of still photos in montage to make up for it. Look you whiners, not everyone was walking around with a flipping movie camera 24/7 back in the early 70's. You might also be surprised to learn that they did not have cell phones either.

He was, however, angry about what he perceived as a betrayal of trust and accused Sanchez of profiteering. Really.

1345350,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B003GCMX5Y,Steve,"[1, 3]","Stones in Exile, the eagerly anticipated dvd companion piece to the re-release of Exile on Main Street is a fascinating and highly worthwhile document. It is important to point out how the entirety of this dvd constitutes the evidence of my argument. The initial hour long piece must be coupled with the bonus interviews to fully flesh out the history, the mythology, the influence, the timelessness, and the miracle that is the album.The main feature is a sweeping mosaic of photos, old and new film footage, snippets from CS Blues and Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, and scores of interviews that form the overdubbed narrative to the story. We get the history of not only the circumstances but the recording itself including some great background about various tracks which is always fascinating to me. For hardcore fans much of the material has been seen before, but there are many places where you think you've seen or heard it before and realize you haven't. A great example: an infamous photo of Keith playing guitar with Gram Parsons beside him, is now expanded to show how this heretofore assumed private moment was actually going on near a table full of guests, thus the photo and the mental image behind it are totally transformed. Also, you get interviews from some highly unusual and yet truly illuminating participants, some quite accidentally. Listening to the recollections of an eight-year old child's role at Nellcote is at once horrifying and charming. This dvd is full of enough of these treasures to soften even the most bitter Stones' fans who complain of nothing new under the sun. I'm a fair-sized Stones collector and even I had never heard Anita Pallenberg speak of her life with Keith, let alone get some lucid and interesting tales. Speaking of lucid, it's endearing to see how Keith has morphed into Johnny Cash, gray hair and all, speaking with a clarity and frankness that is refreshing.The bonus features rival the main feature in terms of value despite some questionable interview choices. There are two interview sections, one with the band and one with fans. The fan part, ""Exile Pans,"" is an endless hyperbolic homage to the folklore and personal affect the band and this album had on their younger musician fans. The Kings of Leon member and Will.I.Am seem to have the least to offer and I find it hard to believe that there weren't two other artists who came closer to the level of devotion and Stones' fandom that Sheryl Crow and Liz Phair do. Jack White makes some sense too, but the highlight is Don Was providing a very detailed and thoughtful opinion on the album/band's impact as well as giving plenty of insight into his experiences working with The Rolling Stones. I can't imagine any Stones fan not nodding their head in agreement with Was. Ditto for Liz Phair, who may get a bit off-point at times, but nonetheless shares her heartfelt affection and attraction to this album that only the truest fans of a group understand. Hearing rock stars themselves wax poetically about an album that you both share such a deep love for is powerful. At heart, we are all fans and these interviews bring that point home marvelously. My only complaint is that they should have been relegated exclusively to the bonus feature instead of bookending the main piece wherein they seem tacked on and unnecessary.The band interviews go deeper into the explanations touched upon in the feature film and offer a wealth of background, de-bunking and validity to the wildly varying stories that orbit around this work. It is a lovely contradiction to hear them talk in very matter-of-fact terms of what they did versus the breathless confessions of the fans. To the band, this was simply another album to make that had some unusual recording circumstances. To the fans and critics, this represents so much more. Don Was hits on this with his comment about how musicians don't just want to make records that sound like Exile but they want to live that glorified legendary lifestyle. To fans, Exile on Main Street clearly represents so much more than eighteen amazing songs. It stands for excess, bohemianism, sex, drugs, booze, darkness, evil, hedonism, danger, fear, wanting, and desperation, and that's just a sampling. If all Rolling Stones roads lead to Main Street as I believe, it can also be said that those same roads lead outward in a billion different directions to the people this album touches, influences, jolts, comforts, moves, and heals.I have a lot of Stones dvds and I rarely watch them. This is one that I will watch often because there is a shared joy in the whole viewing process. As I watched, I became part of a discussion group of like-minded individuals, united by our love of this epic album. A sense of belonging such as this film creates is a precious thing indeed.What are you doing this weekend, Liz Phair?",5,"A treasure trove, a shared love",1280188800,"07 27,

1345351,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B003GCMX5Y,Steven A. Peterson,"[2, 3]","I enjoyed this a lot. There are many shots of the Rolling Stones as they develop the classic album ""Exile on Main Street."" They comment on their work as do others. And, in the background, is music from ""Exile."" The lads look so young. The juxtaposition of them talking then and them speaking now shows the toll the years have taken on them.It starts off with the tune ""Shake Your Hips."" The album began in the south of France, as the Stones left England as tax exiles. Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts start things off in the present as they revisit the place where the album was developed--Keith Richards' place in southern France.Then, back to the time. . . . The video shows the Stones starting with ""Satisfaction."" Then, tax problems and the flight to France. Interesting note: the people who lived in that part of France were not so aware of the group, and they could be something like ordinary people. Keith and Anita (with their kid Marlon) and Mick and Bianca are featured to some extent as couples. To refer to the metaphor of exile, some of the Stones genuinely felt like they had been exiled from their home country, and some of the scenes are rather poignant on this score.Keith created a studio in the basement of his house, and much of the footage takes place in that venue (hot and humid much of the time, making creation of the double album quite uncomfortable at times). Joining the Rolling Stones were talents such as Bobby Keys, Nicky Hopkins, and Jim Price. The creative process seems well told here. Lots of improvisation, some chaos, but with an end result that is one of their absolute best works.The images and videos are often rather rough and unpolished, but that seems to enhance the process described just above. Too, the role of drugs is pretty openly portrayed, a darker part of the creative process.After the works are completed, the group went to LA to take the raw material and create a finished album.All in all, a nice work.",4,Nice retrospective view of the Stones in tax exile,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,1956,"['enjoyed', 'lot', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'develop', 'classic', 'album', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'comment', 'work', 'do', 'others', 'background', 'music', 'Exile', 'lads', 'look', 'so', 'young', 'juxtaposition', 'talking', 'then', 'speaking', 'now', 'toll', 'years', 'have', 'taken', 'them.It', 'tune', 'Shake', 'Hips', 'album', 'began', 'south', 'France', 'Stones', 'left', 'England', 'tax', 'exiles', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Charlie', 'Watts', 'start', 'things', 'off', 'present', 'revisit', 'place', 'where', 'album', 'was', 'developed', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'place', 'southern', 'France.Then', 'back', 'time', 'video', 'Stones', 'starting', 'Satisfaction', 'Then', 'tax', 'problems', 'flight', 'France', 'Interesting', 'note', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'part', 'France', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'aware', 'group', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'ordinary', 'people', 'Keith', 'Anita', 'kid', 'Marlon', 'Mick', 'Bianca', 'are', 'featured', 'extent', 'couples', 'refer', 'metaphor', 'exile', 'Stones', 'genuinely', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'exiled', 'home', 'country', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'poignant', 'score.Keith', 'created', 'studio', 'basement', 'house', 'much', 'footage', 'place', 'venue', 'hot', 'humid', 'much', 'time', 'making', 'creation', 'double', 'album', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'Joining', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'were', 'talents', 'such', 'Bobby', 'Keys', 'Nicky', 'Hopkins', 'Jim', 'Price', 'creative', 'process', 'well', 'told', 'here', 'Lots', 'improvisation', 'chaos', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'works.The', 'images', 'videos', 'are', 'often', 'rather', 'rough', 'unpolished', 'enhance', 'process', 'described', 'just', 'above', 'Too', 'role', 'drugs', 'pretty', 'openly', 'portrayed', 'darker', 'part', 'creative', 'process.After', 'works', 'are', 'completed', 'group', 'went', 'LA', 'take', 'raw', 'material', 'create', 'finished', 'album.All', 'nice', 'work']",N/A
1345352,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B003GCMX5Y,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[4, 4]","The documentary sets the scene, drifting along to the parts where the band is forced to go into tax exile to pay their back taxes, as they were being taxed 93% of their incomes, and they'd been fleeced by management, so they headed to the south of France to record in an infamous mansion at Villefranche-sur-Mer in the Cte d'Azur called Villa Nelcte. Interviews with irrelevant celebrities, like some kid from Kings of Leon (?), and Benicio Del Toro (?). Don Was seems to have some perspective, at least, and so does Jack White (maybe). Great pics of a shirtless Keith lighting up a cig. Nice video clips of the Stones entourage getting off of an airplane, great pics of the whole gang in their glory. Waterskiing in the South of France. Keith and Marlon. Keith with a big white sweater. Anita was the only one who could argue with the chef, Fat Jacques, there's a pic of her holding a copy of the French version of Tintin The Black Island. ""Every morning Keith would be up at 8:30 in the morning, ready to jump into his car, looking after his kid Marlon. Nobody knew the Stones in the South of France, so they were able to act and live normally, we would go to the zoo or the beach. In the afternoon, Anita would look after Marlon and Keith would play music. Every morning it would be the same. It was a normal way of life."" Keith dating Bianca. Mick posing with Keith's Gibson acoustic guitar. Bill Wyman complaining about living in France, Charlie too, because they couldn't get their British creature comforts there. Rare picture of Mick Taylor smiling. The late Jimmy Miller, the album's producer, noted in a recording that the band chose convenience over sound and used Keith's house. Brought in the BMC sound truck.Audio from recording sessions. Commuting around the South of France, Charlie lived six hours away. Eight-man band with kids, and technicians. Can't separate family life from professional activity in the tribes. Random images like album cover. Difficult recording conditions. Crazy entourage setup. ""Mick's rock, I'm roll,"" says Keith. Marshall Chess with a nice mullet. Mick playing a Flying V. Jammin'. ""As unrehearsed as a hiccup,"" says Bobby Keys, ""it wasn't exactly spontaneous combustion."" A very nice blues jam with Mick and Keith going away, with Mick also playing guitar.The Stones playing pool, Mick swigging from a flask. Jake Weber's father was a race car driver, drug smuggler and adventurer, Jake was 8.5 years old at the time. Describes downtime and creative process. Picking away at guitars, the basement at night was the epicentre. Great Dominique Tarl&eacute; picture of Jake with five classic Keith guitars - a flying V, the famous ampeg Dan Armstrong plexiglass guitar, an SG and a big Gibson ES-355. Swigging from bottles of Jack Daniels. A glimpse into the recording process. Andy Johns, recording engineer, noted that ""they would play very poorly for two or three days on whatever song. And then if Keith got up and started looking at Charlie, then you knew that something would go down. And then Bill would get up and put his bass at that sort of 84 angle, and you'd say `ah, here it comes, they're going to go for it now, ha ha ha.' And it would turn into this wonderful, God-given music."" Some funky animation from still photos of Keith's fretting hand moving, Bill's bass shifting to an 84 angle (how did they do that?). The giant dinner, everybody gathered once a day. Jake's function in life was to roll joints. A decadent life, everything was out in the open, this was the light before the moment of darkness. Charlie Watts: ""everybody had a great time, but it was very stressful. You're having a good time, but ready to go back home. The only one who wasn't like that was Keith, of course, who was being supplied in his mansion, with his band downstairs, it must have been heaven for him in a way."" A real live rabbit in a tray next to the guitars. The anecdote of Keith in the bus saying ""oh, I forgot something, we have to go back,"" then he proceeded to simply drop a TV out of the balcony. Keith singing ""Happy"".Keith's voice heard more than Mick's, until the end. ""We always went to LA to finish our records. That was our modus operandi."" Keith: ""It was kind of fun playing it to lots of musicians and friends in LA. It was interesting to get their input, because everything that went in at Nelcte was a just bubble, really."" Mick: ""We'd never made a double album before, so we were a bit nave about it. It was just a bit too much work, considering that we'd had all these pressures, plus we were a bit burned on it."" Mick made ""Tumbling Dice"" out of a conversation with the maid, ""Casino Boogie"" had no lyrics, they were desperate so they used a cut-up method. This is illustrated with visuals. Beautiful. Description of the after-production at Sunset Sounds. Overdubs gave the songs a new twist. Little jams improve the original sessions. Awesome Robert Frank session footage of the band walking down the street, Mick Jagger yawning and stretching his face, and then it's up on a billboard. Wild post-release pastiche of the media swirl of radio, billboard and magazine-cover (Rolling Stone), with a great ""Rocks Off"" images m&eacute;lange, Kasey Casem voce-over, playing with Stevie Wonder. Don Was: ""Exile on Main Street dramatically altered the vocabulary of record-making. There are textures on that that no-one ever laid down before."" Irrelevant statements from Sheryl Crow, Martin Scorsese, Benecio Del Toro and others at the end.Extended interviews:Keith Richards: Wanted to get started in the basement, then decided to keep it on, so much experimentation because of the sound of the various basement rooms. Dense sound down there. First month was touch and go, then it started to flow. Wanted to be a soul band, added horns with Bobby Keys and Jim Price. Two guys fitted into the size of the band, gave it extra texture and turned into a soul band. Bobby and Keith found out after many years that they had been born within hours of each other. Never intended Exile to be a double album until they realised that they'd recorded so many songs that they didn't know which to cut.Bill Wyman: The engineer and the producer and the band couldn't see each other, and they had to communicate by voice, and it's a miracle that it worked out, the whole band was only there 30% of the time, sometimes they were all there, except for Keith, who was just upstairs, despite Charlie coming five hours from where he lived, Bill and Mick Taylor coming two hours from where they lived, Bill coming one hour from where he lived. Mick Taylor was, musically, the better musician than any others in the band; he was young, and some of the things he had done were amazing, but he was incredibly boring onstage despite doing these incredible licks and solos.Mick Taylor: he talks! Keith and Anita were mixing domesticity and art. Although the recordings were in the basement, there were constant power failures, and primitive and basic procedures. Ended up being a holiday resort for the Stones' friends and all their friends, ""and in the midst of all this partying, we were trying to make an album.""Anita: the guitars get the best seats. Kids are kids, they can sleep with any noise. They had a great attitude for adults, and the adults had to deal with them, especially Jacob and Charlie. Confronting adults and playing with them. Good vibe. A freeloading brigade. Anita became a bouncer as the freeloaders piled up, throwing everybody out. Moved from room to room. Weird sailor shoot-outs when they were in town. Charlie bought an Edwardian villa, still has it. Keith is very easy to play with, very comfortable. Exile picked up a lot of stuff that was missed off of earlier releases.An interview with Ronnie Wood: ""I'd never played the songs, but I knew them."" ""It hits the nail on the head whether the songs are mixed or not.""Return to Stargroves: Jagger: completely, exactly the same. ""I had this house for 1970 to 1975. It does have a lot of memories, because one of the reasons is that we recorded here, but it has other memories for me too, children, my parent, all that sort of thing, my brother lived here a lot. He liked it a lot, my brother, having this very large house. I don't blame him."" Earliest recordings for Exile, such as Sweet Black Angel, were recorded there.Extra interviews: Liz Phair's comments the best, listens to ""Loving Cup."" Sheryl Crow's comments on ""Sweet Virginia."" Will.I.Am is a moron. Kings of Leon guy, from Memphis, is too childish. Jack Black is savvy. Martin Scorsese is the only commentator of the same age as the Stones, maybe also Don Was, who talks passionately about the extra tracks, like ""Sophia Loren"" and the new mix of ""Loving Cup."" Very expressive and passionate about the band.Packaging is not that great - three-panel foldout booklet contains a pic of Charlie, a pic of Keith holding an acoustic, and a pic of Mick with a flying V guitar. The other side has a collage of Robert Frank pics. Through the transparent DVD case you also see a pic of Keith and the two Micks jamming.",4,"Great archival footage, worthless interviews",1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,9074,"['documentary', 'sets',

I'd just like to note that there's virtually zero footage of the band actually recording the ""Exile on Main Street"" album. So this movie is not a documentary. What it is is a lot of photos and brief, silent video from the French villa scene of the basic-tracks recording, with modern-day voiceover from all sorts of people, mostly the band members, of course. However, what they say, to me at least, is very descriptive and insightful - and probably will be to others who are fans of the Stones and this album in particular. Interspersed are bits of current sit-down interviews with Don Was, Sheryl Crow, Jack White, and several other people - most of whom are clearly very knowledgeable about rock music in general as well as this album specifically. The other interviews are with non-musician fans simply describing what they enjoy about the album and what it means to them. There's extended versions of these interviews in the movie's special features portion. The movie is good, for a Stones fan, but still, it's a lot of photos and a lot of people talking. If you're looking for a fair amount of footage of the ""Exile on Main Street"" recording sessions, it's not here.",3,"Good, but not a documentary",1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,1250,"['think', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'who', 'big', 'Stones', 'fan', 'will', 'like', 'Stones', 'Exile', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'note', 'virtually', 'zero', 'footage', 'band', 'actually', 'recording', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'album', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'What', 'lot', 'photos', 'brief', 'silent', 'video', 'French', 'villa', 'scene', 'basic-tracks', 'recording', 'modern-day', 'voiceover', 'sorts', 'people', 'mostly', 'band', 'members', 'course', 'However', 'what', 'say', 'least', 'very', 'descriptive', 'insightful', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Stones', 'album', 'particular', 'Interspersed', 'are', 'bits', 'current', 'sit-down', 'interviews', 'Don', 'Was', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Jack', 'White', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'clearly', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'rock', 'music', 'general', 'as', 'well', 'album', 'specifically', 'other', 'interviews', 'are', 'non-musician', 'fans', 'simply', 'describing', 'what', 'enjoy', 'album', 'what', 'extended', 'versions', 'interviews', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'portion', 'movie', 'good', 'Stones', 'fan', 'still', 'lot', 'photos', 'lot', 'people', 'talking', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fair', 'amount', 'footage', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'recording', 'sessions', 'not', 'here']",N/A
1345354,A3G36QYR6PWME9,B003GCMX5Y,Timothy P. Stallcup,"[0, 1]","This is just a cool, fun and engaging look at the Stones and the making of Exile on Main Street. Stones fans can argue endlessly whether Exile is THE great Stones album, one of the greats, or neither, but you don't have to address, much less resolve, that dispute to enjoy the film.  The soundtrack is great and the stills and video are a blast.  The details about the technical difficulties in making the album out of Keith's basement in the south of France (Stones in tax exile) are probably well known, but it is interesting to see as much as we do of the house and the equipment and the general set up.  Mostly, it's just great to see photos and video of the Stones making some great music 40 years ago. I didn't have access to the video extras, so I can't comment.  The film is short, and it seems like a lot more could have been done with it.  The snippets of ""talking heads"" are fairly lame. I really didn't care about most of their comments. Hey, I like Benicio Del Toro, but I'm not really sure what he adds. So while I can see why some might have wanted more or been disappointed with this package, it is still a lot of fun for an hour.",4,Cool Look at a Great Album,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1146,"['just', 'cool', 'fun', 'engaging', 'look', 'Stones', 'making', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'Stones', 'fans', 'can', 'argue', 'endlessly', 'Exile', 'THE', 'great', 'Stones', 'album', 'one', 'greats', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'address', 'much', 'less', 'resolve', 'enjoy', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'stills', 'video', 'are', 'blast', 'details', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'making', 'album', 'Keith', 'basement', 'south', 'France', 'Stones', 'tax', 'exile', 'are', 'probably', 'well', 'known', 'interesting', 'see', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'house', 'equipment', 'general', 'set', 'up', 'Mostly', 'just', 'great', 'see', 'photos', 'video', 'Stones', 'making', 'great', 'music', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'video', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'film', 'short', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'snippets', 'talking', 'heads', 'are', 'fairly', 'lame', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'most', 'comments', 'Hey', 'like', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'more', 'been', 'disappointed', 'package', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'hour']",N/A
