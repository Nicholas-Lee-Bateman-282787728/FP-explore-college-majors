1093779,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,B000UAE7BS,Flower,"[1, 1]","This is a very good movie with a great cast! More movies about the church need to be made.. This movie has twist and turns and shows you what goes on behind the church scenes.The messages in this movie show the truth about everyday church activities. Many ministers go through on a daily bases. Many pastors are cast out of the church. This movie will not disappoint you.Always pray and keep your eyes on the Lord and not man or money. There are many personalities in the church, and many issues and conflict within the church walls. The church is like a hospital where many souls go for healing, salvation, prayer etc. This movie will touch on many different things. There are many churches going through court currently on many different issues.There is another great movie called The Undershepherd that is also about the church that we have been looking for on DVD and unable to find.You will enjoy both movies! Do not listen to the negative reviews, feed your spirit man with good food for thought.Keep your focus on Christ! Study the word for yourself. Be a light to the world. Focus on the promises and not the problems.Praise God!

1093781,AW5LNZBFQAOWM,B000UAE7BS,"Noir Man ""Foggy Dude""","[5, 5]","For a movie that had a very interesting storyline I cannot say that I recommend spending the money to buy it.  It was interesting to examine different personalities at work in the church, to see vulnerabilities and human frailties displayed by those at the ""top"" in ministry, but I honestly couldn't hear what they were saying sometimes because the sound was horrible....it was hissing, too low, or even almost mute!!  It was ridiculous, especially during a key scene when the bishop and Luther Heir were discussing a proposal in Luther's limousine...who was the Einstein that decided to film the scene with the back windows open and the overwhelming sound of the outside traffic/noise??!!  Very frustrating.  I could have at least survived with subtitles, but alas, there were none.The acting was good, generally, but there were some disconnections in the story....one not-too-loud shot was fired in one part of the building and suddenly the Conference was screaming and scrambling in sheer terror?! And what about all those snake tattoos...there could have been more done with that theme.  There were also some non-creative stereotypes used -- the accountant is a nerdy, argyle-sweater-wearing guy; the film's title character was a Turk, a Muslim (at least assumed) with the name, Luther?? It's hard to not come off as arrogant when the Christians have a Muslim-type as Lucifer in their film.  Not a good choice in my opinion.As a Christian I enjoy the look at a public, successful leader in ministry that is complex in that he is still proud, yet humble, sober and drunk, confident and cowardly....it just would have been very, VERY nice to actually hear ALL of the dialog.Definitely rent it ( the scenes with DMX were my favorites ) but don't buy it until they improve the quality of the DVD.",3,Better Sound + Better Camera = Better Movie,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,1796,"['movie', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'recommend', 'spending', 'money', 'buy', 'was', 'interesting', 'examine', 'different', 'personalities', 'work', 'church', 'see', 'vulnerabilities', 'human', 'frailties', 'displayed', 'top', 'ministry', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'sometimes', 'sound', 'was', 'horrible', '.it', 'was', 'hissing', 'too', 'low', 'even', 'almost', 'mute', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'especially', 'key', 'scene', 'when', 'bishop', 'Luther', 'Heir', 'were', 'discussing', 'proposal', 'Luther', 'limousine', 'who', 'was', 'Einstein', 'decided', 'film', 'scene', 'back', 'windows', 'open', 'overwhelming', 'sound', 'outside', 'traffic/noise', 'Very', 'frustrating', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'survived', 'subtitles', 'alas', 'were', 'none.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'generally', 'were', 'disconnections', 'story', '.one', 'not-too-loud', 'shot', 'was', 'fired', 'one', 'part', 'building', 'suddenly', 'Conference', 'was', 'screaming', 'scrambling', 'sheer', 'terror', 'what', 'snake', 'tattoos', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'done', 'theme', 'were', 'also', 'non-creative', 'stereotypes', 'used', 'accountant', 'nerdy', 'argyle-sweater-wearing', 'guy', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'Turk', 'Muslim', 'least', 'assumed', 'name', 'Luther', 'hard', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'arrogant', 'when', 'Christians', 'have', 'Muslim-type', 'Lucifer', 'film', 'Not', 'good', 'choice', 'opinion.As', 'Christian', 'enjoy', 'look', 'public', 'successful', 'leader', 'ministry', 'complex', 'still', 'proud', 'yet', 'humble', 'sober', 'drunk', 'confident', 'cowardly', '.it', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'VERY', 'nice', 'actually', 'hear', 'ALL', 'dialog.Definitely', 'rent', 'scenes', 'DMX', 'were', 'favorites', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'improve', 'quality', 'DVD']",Father Of Lies
