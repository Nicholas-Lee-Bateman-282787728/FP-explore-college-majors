1280213,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B002NTDXS2,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[0, 0]","Tony Shalhoub is the idiosyncratic ""Monk"" a private detective, trying to get back on the police force.  But his obsessive-compulsive behavior, which contributes to his brilliance as a detective, is so personally distracting to him and those around him that he brilliantly solves case after case without achieving his goal of reinstatement.  Sad for Monk, but much more interesting dramatically for the audience.His compulsive behavior makes him almost supernaturally aware of details that others miss, and hypersensitive to things that are amiss.On Disc 1, Monk solves the attempted murder of the mayor whose wife is a master of the brittle retort, after which he reluctantly takes a case for his oddball brother who is agoraphobic.  And if things weren't bad enough, Monk solves his last two cases when he's not thinking straight.  In one case he has an accident, and in the other, his psychiatrist overmedicates him.The first case on Disc 2 deals with leprosy.  It's done in the style of 1950s Science Fiction, and it shows that leprosy is now curable, but the subject is still a little uncomfortable, although Natalie and her young daughter take things in stride.When Monk stays up all night, he has a supernatural and touching encounter, but pay attention, or you may miss the important scam.  The Miracle of Monk and the Miracle, is surprising, but not miraculous, although after Monk gives the down to earth explanation for the ""supernatural"" phenomena, it is he who quietly petitions God for help.Mr. Monk and the UFO is my favorite.  The characters are interesting ranging from the garage repairman to the sheriff to the eccentrics who come to view the little men from outer space.  Not even Monk finds this one easy to bring down to earth.",5,Put a Little Monk in Your Life,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1748,"['Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'idiosyncratic', 'Monk', 'private', 'detective', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'police', 'force', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'behavior', 'brilliance', 'detective', 'so', 'personally', 'distracting', 'brilliantly', 'case', 'case', 'achieving', 'goal', 'reinstatement', 'Sad', 'Monk', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'dramatically', 'audience.His', 'compulsive', 'behavior', 'almost', 'supernaturally', 'aware', 'details', 'others', 'miss', 'hypersensitive', 'things', 'are', 'amiss.On', 'Disc', '1', 'Monk', 'attempted', 'murder', 'mayor', 'wife', 'master', 'brittle', 'retort', 'reluctantly', 'case', 'oddball', 'brother', 'who', 'agoraphobic', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Monk', 'last', 'two', 'cases', 'when', 'not', 'thinking', 'straight', 'one', 'case', 'accident', 'other', 'psychiatrist', 'him.The', 'first', 'case', 'Disc', '2', 'deals', 'leprosy', 'done', 'style', '1950s', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'leprosy', 'now', 'curable', 'subject', 'still', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'Natalie', 'young', 'daughter', 'take', 'things', 'stride.When', 'Monk', 'up', 'night', 'supernatural', 'touching', 'encounter', 'pay', 'attention', 'may', 'miss', 'important', 'scam', 'Miracle', 'Monk', 'Miracle', 'surprising', 'not', 'miraculous', 'Monk', 'down', 'earth', 'explanation', 'supernatural', 'phenomena', 'who', 'quietly', 'petitions', 'God', 'help.Mr', 'Monk', 'UFO', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'ranging', 'garage', 'repairman', 'sheriff', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'come', 'view', 'little', 'men', 'outer', 'space', 'Not', 'even', 'Monk', 'one', 'easy', 'bring', 'down', 'earth']",Best of Monk

If you are a real ""Monk"" fan, you probably will want every season anyway.However, if you are a 'kind of' or 'so so' ""Monk"" fan, this DVD really gives you a lot of 'Monk Power' for your dollar.It begins with the Pilot ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate"" which allows you to meet everyone, and is kind of a 2 for 1, since it is the length of 2 episdoes.""Mr. Monk and the 3 Pies"" is a great episdoe that makes you wonder 'what on earth is going on?' for just the right amount of time. (Nice conclusion with a bang too.)""Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine"" is a nice episdoe where we realize if Monk were normal, he wouldn't be so effective or nice.""Mr. Monk Bumps His Head"" is a nice episdoe where he forgets who he is, and a woman finds him SO attractive.""Mr. Monk Is Up All Night"" is yet another interesting episdoe with an unusually creepy feel.Without going through every episdoe, I'll just say, all in all, it's a really great dvd for the 'so so' ""Monk"" fan.

1280218,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B002NTDXS2,Mark Baker,"[44, 45]","This little two disc set is fun for the casual Monk fan.  Of course, can there really be such a thing when you are talking about the obsessive compulsive detective?The two disc contain one episode a season from the hit show.  That's right, they've include one from the about the conclude eighth season.  These aren't necessarily the most important, but they are the ones that were chosen as the best.The episodes include ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate,"" ""Mr. Monk and the Three Pies,"" ""Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine,"" ""Mr. Monk Bumps His Head,"" ""Mr. Monk and the Leper,"" ""Mr. Monk is Up all Night,"" ""Mr. Monk and the Miracle,"" and ""Mr. Monk and the UFO.""Frankly, I can see how this would be an almost impossible choice.  I'm sure everyone has their favorites.  It does make sense to start off with the two part pilot, which sets things up.  And ""Three Pies"" is one of my favorites.  On the other hand, ""Up all Night"" is one of my least favorites.  Why was it included here?Still, if you want a taste of this quirky mystery comedy in your collection, you will be satisfied.  Some of these cases are downright confusing, which is saying something for a show known for light mysteries.  ""UFO"" in particular had me confused the entire way through.  There are some great laughs here as Monk has to deal with the outside world.  And the acting and character interactions are always top notch.I doubt you could please all the fans of this show with only eight episodes.  Still, I would choose something different if it were up to me.
