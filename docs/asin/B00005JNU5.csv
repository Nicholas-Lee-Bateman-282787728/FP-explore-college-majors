Not a perfect gem, and perhaps even a bit rough; but one well worth having, despite its minor (and debatable) flaws.True, the set does not include every single item that a Max Headroom fanatic might wish for. The original UK movie is absent for example, as is the music video for the Art of Noise's 'Paranoimia,' and those are genuine disappointments. Both of them would have greatly added to this DVD set's value.The 'New Coke' commercials are also not included; but for those of us who truly loved Max Headroom, those commercials were a grotesque and venal abomination anyway.Never mind what the set does NOT include, though. It DOES include every episode of the TV show, and that's really all ""The Complete Series"" means, yes?All things considered (and putting aside the aforementioned omissions), I have only two minor complaints with this DVD set: 1) The TV show's 23-year-old video quality really would have benefitted from remastering, and 2) Assembling ""Members of the Cast"" for a round table discussion to stick into the Extras is almost meaningless when you omit the STAR of the show, Matt Frewer. The man's not dead. Why couldn't they get him to participate?However, neither of those complaints is significant enough to make me regret my purchase.

It was like seeing ""Road Warrior"" or ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" for the first time. It was refreshing and different and most of all not afraid to be that way. Clever writing and good acting sustained the show, afterall as fun as Max's head was it couldn't have carried the show on it's own. And of course that is why it failed as well. It seems networks somehow lose sight of giving good new SciFi shows much of a chance. Recently case in point ""Threshold"" was a wonderful brilliant new series, but like Max it was pre-empted for everything but your brothers bathroom breaks. I am afraid although I understand Baseball or some sport may appeal to alot of viewers you should just move the great SciFi show to another time slot. What would you fill in with till the sports show is ready to go on? How about Stupidous Home Videos or some other show that no one will miss if it isn't on every week or that it doesn't matter what order the episodes are shown in.

636055,A2GOTXRA1HV9MU,B00005JNU5,Dan,"[18, 19]","I received my set yesterday and watched the first two episodes along with all the bonus features.I think people are being a little too harsh on the image quality.  Part of what I remembered about this series is the soft, but gritty look.  The soft grittiness contrasts well with the video segments that are super-imposed into the show and gives it a very distinct style.  In fact, the video portions look very sharp.  If the overall image was any sharper, you would be able to detect the imperfections in the sets and the costumes...along with the shots of Network 23 in the cityscape that is obviously a model.The image is definitely an improvement over the VHS rips that have been on the internet.  Also, the versions that people captured from TechTV are edited for time...so at least these DVDs are the full versions that originally aired on ABC.The extras are pretty good...except for a few holes. It's interesting that they talk about the making of the original UK mini-movie, yet it isn't included in the set...that seems disappointing (I still have the original on VHS that I bought in the late 80s).  Also as many people have stated, Matt Frewer is absent...but from the vibe I was getting in the round table with the actors, he seems like he ended up  bitter about the entire Max Headroom persona.  There are no segments from the Max Headroom video show and none of the New Coke commercials.  So anyone looking for a super complete Max Headroom retrospective are going to be disappointed.The segment on the making of the show features interviews with the people who invented Max Headroom along with the writers and the producers of both the original UK movie as well as the US TV Show (they actually brought most of the creative talent to the US to help).  It's interesting that the went to such great lengths to create a back story for a character that wasn't going to do much more than introduce music videos.The round table interview is OK.  Amanda Pays sounds like she just drank a few Red Bulls before they started shooting...and Chris Young doesn't really say too much, but is pleasant enough and it's always nice to see a child actor who actually turned out ok. I think Concetta Tomei (Blank Dominique) and Jeffery Tambor (Murray) offer the most insight about working on the show.  Both seem genuinely sad when they talk about the last day when the show was canceled.The rest are just segments that seemed removed from the first two features that focus on specific topics.  I did love the little talk between Concetta Tomei and Morgan Sheppard as you can see a genuine friendship that blossomed on the set of Max Headroom and continues on to this day.In the end, it's really about the original TV show.  Max Headroom has aged extremely well. Sure, we still get a few punks who look like Pat Benetar fans that escaped from Flash Dance with their cut-off t-shirts.  It also has a bit of the early MTV/Cyberpunk look (notice the live statues in the bar in episode 2) but the good news is, it really doesn't scream 80s and feels timeless. This show would have been just as acceptable if it was created this year.Highly recommended.",4,Better than your old VHS copies or bootlegs...,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,3143,"['received', 'set', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'features.I', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'harsh', 'image', 'quality', 'Part', 'what', 'remembered', 'series', 'soft', 'gritty', 'look', 'soft', 'grittiness', 'contrasts', 'well', 'video', 'segments', 'are', 'super-imposed', 'show', 'very', 'distinct', 'style', 'fact', 'video', 'portions', 'look', 'very', 'sharp', 'overall', 'image', 'was', 'sharper', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'detect', 'imperfections', 'sets', 'costumes', 'shots', 'Network', '23', 'cityscape', 'obviously', 'model.The', 'image', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'rips', 'have', 'been', 'internet', 'Also', 'versions', 'people', 'captured', 'TechTV', 'are', 'edited', 'time', 'so', 'least', 'DVDs', 'are', 'full', 'versions', 'originally', 'aired', 'ABC.The', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'few', 'holes', 'interesting', 'talk', 'making', 'original', 'UK', 'mini-movie', ""n't"", 'included', 'set', 'disappointing', 'still', 'have', 'original', 'VHS', 'bought', 'late', '80s', 'Also', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'stated', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'absent', 'vibe', 'was', 'getting', 'round', 'table', 'actors', 'ended', 'up', 'bitter', 'entire', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'persona', 'are', 'segments', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'video', 'show', 'none', 'New', 'Coke', 'commercials', 'anyone', 'looking', 'super', 'complete', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'retrospective', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'segment', 'making', 'show', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'invented', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'writers', 'producers', 'original', 'UK', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'US', 'TV', 'Show', 'actually', 'brought', 'most', 'creative', 'talent', 'US', 'help', 'interesting', 'went', 'such', 'great', 'lengths', 'create', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'introduce', 'music', 'videos.The', 'round', 'table', 'interview', 'OK.', 'Amanda', 'Pays', 'just', 'drank', 'few', 'Red', 'Bulls', 'started', 'shooting', 'Chris', 'Young', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'ok', 'think', 'Concetta', 'Tomei', 'Blank', 'Dominique', 'Jeffery', 'Tambor', 'Murray', 'offer', 'most', 'insight', 'working', 'show', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'sad', 'when', 'talk', 'last', 'day', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'canceled.The', 'rest', 'are', 'just', 'segments', 'seemed', 'removed', 'first', 'two', 'features', 'focus', 'specific', 'topics', 'did', 'love', 'little', 'talk', 'Concetta', 'Tomei', 'Morgan', 'Sheppard', 'can', 'see', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'blossomed', 'set', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'end', 'really', 'original', 'TV', 'show', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'aged', 'extremely', 'well', 'Sure', 'still', 'get', 'few', 'punks', 'who', 'look', 'Pat', 'Benetar', 'fans', 'escaped', 'Flash', 'Dance', 'cut-off', 't-shirts', 'also', 'bit', 'early', 'MTV/Cyberpunk', 'look', 'live', 'statues', 'bar', '2', 'good', 'news', 'really', ""n't"", 'scream', '80s', 'feels', 'timeless', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'acceptable', 'was', 'created', 'year.Highly', 'recommended']",Max Headroom: The Complete Series

But not only does Max develop a mind of his own, but Edison is still alive and well -- and determined to tell the world about a deadly new ad campaign.And Max continues to come in handy when Edison and his new controller Theora (Amanda Pays) investigate a deadly new sport, a corrupt security company, a terrorist group on a rival network, the defiant Blanks, organ-stealing bodysnatchers, a corrupt telereligion, a friend accused of a deadly crime, a strangely addictive TV show, a deadly dream-hijack, babysnatchers, memory manipulation, and more in-network politics...I watched Max Headroom as a very, very small child, and I only have a few vague memories of it. But it was enough to make me nostalgic about this series, and send me scuttling to rewatch it once more -- while the technology is pretty dated, it has a wonderfully glitzy dystopia divided between the luxurious world of TV and the bleak, grimy punk world of the Blanks.Every episode has a solid mystery to unravel, or a problem that somehow has to be picked apart with computers (ie Max). But what really makes the writing stand out is the clever jabs at commercials (""We make everything you need and you need everything we make!""), politics, big corporations, big corporations in bed with politicians, and a world increasingly ruled by money and the media (""Credit fraud? My God, that's worse than murder!"").And therein lies the wit of this series. Every episode sticks another needle in the media-saturated world and pops its bubble (""Without television, this city would be ungovernable!"").Matt Frewer does a brilliant double turn as both Carter and Max. Carter is a steely-eyed, brilliant reporter who pursues the truth at all costs, and Max is a deliciously irreverent, stuttering CGI head who unveils all Carter's deepest thoughts. Pays does a good but not brilliant job as Frewer's love interest/coworker; Jeffrey Tambor has a nice smaller role as Frewer's overstressed boss; and W. Morgan Sheppard is awesome as the grizzled rebel Blank Reg.""Max Headroom: The Complete Series"" is one of those shows that seemed like it would never be released on DVD -- a short but brilliant shard of cyberpunk.",5,Head in a box,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,3061,"['Cyberpunk', 'think', 'collision', 'point', 'near-future', 'sci-fi', 'information', 'tech', 'first', 'exploded', 'television', 'form', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'focused', 'adventures', 'crack', 'reporter', 'digital', 'doppelganger', 'few', 'flaws', 'clunky', 'TVs', 'also', 'sly', 'wit', 'plenty', 'jabs', 'increasingly', 'media-obsessed', 'society.Network', '23', 'mysteriously', 'been', 'pulling', 'top', 'news', 'stories', 'including', 'man', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'exploded', 'top', 'reporter', 'Edison', 'Carter', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'when', 'prowling', 'around', 'secret', 'floor', 'network', 'building', 'up', 'running', 'life.In', 'effort', 'see', 'Edison', 'learned', 'too', 'much', 'secret', 'blipverts', 'network', 'corrupt', 'boss', 'orders', 'teen', 'genius', 'Bryce', 'Chris', 'Young', 'make', 'digital', 'duplicate', 'Edison', 'mind', 'who', 'dubbed', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'not', 'only', 'Max', 'develop', 'mind', 'own', 'Edison', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'determined', 'tell', 'world', 'deadly', 'new', 'ad', 'campaign.And', 'Max', 'come', 'handy', 'when', 'Edison', 'new', 'controller', 'Theora', 'Amanda', 'Pays', 'investigate', 'deadly', 'new', 'sport', 'corrupt', 'security', 'company', 'terrorist', 'group', 'rival', 'network', 'defiant', 'Blanks', 'organ-stealing', 'bodysnatchers', 'corrupt', 'telereligion', 'friend', 'accused', 'deadly', 'crime', 'strangely', 'addictive', 'TV', 'show', 'deadly', 'dream-hijack', 'babysnatchers', 'memory', 'manipulation', 'more', 'in-network', 'politics', 'watched', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'very', 'very', 'small', 'child', 'only', 'have', 'few', 'vague', 'memories', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'series', 'send', 'scuttling', 'rewatch', 'once', 'more', 'technology', 'pretty', 'dated', 'wonderfully', 'glitzy', 'dystopia', 'divided', 'luxurious', 'world', 'TV', 'bleak', 'grimy', 'punk', 'world', 'Blanks.Every', 'episode', 'solid', 'mystery', 'unravel', 'problem', 'somehow', 'be', 'picked', 'apart', 'computers', 'ie', 'Max', 'what', 'really', 'writing', 'stand', 'out', 'clever', 'jabs', 'commercials', 'make', 'everything', 'need', 'need', 'everything', 'make', 'politics', 'big', 'corporations', 'big', 'corporations', 'bed', 'politicians', 'world', 'increasingly', 'ruled', 'money', 'media', 'Credit', 'fraud', 'My', 'God', 'worse', 'murder', '.And', 'therein', 'wit', 'series', 'Every', 'episode', 'needle', 'media-saturated', 'world', 'bubble', 'television', 'city', 'would', 'be', 'ungovernable', '.Matt', 'Frewer', 'brilliant', 'double', 'turn', 'Carter', 'Max', 'Carter', 'steely-eyed', 'brilliant', 'reporter', 'who', 'truth', 'costs', 'Max', 'deliciously', 'irreverent', 'stuttering', 'CGI', 'head', 'who', 'Carter', 'deepest', 'thoughts', 'Pays', 'good', 'not', 'brilliant', 'job', 'Frewer', 'love', 'interest/coworker', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'nice', 'smaller', 'role', 'Frewer', 'overstressed', 'boss', 'W.', 'Morgan', 'Sheppard', 'awesome', 'grizzled', 'rebel', 'Blank', 'Reg', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'Complete', 'Series', 'one', 'shows', 'seemed', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'short', 'brilliant', 'shard', 'cyberpunk']",Max Headroom: The Complete Series
636058,A23JNLBAE18XO0,B00005JNU5,Frank R. Schoonover,"[1, 1]","This is the short lived 1987 science fiction TV series called Max Headroom. The TV series is set in the future where TV networks are at war with each other for ratings and where as a result of that war, TV's can't be turned off for any reason. The TV stays on day in and day out even when people are sleeping and also, people who are homeless also have access to TV.In the series, the main network, Network 23 is always in search of things to do exposes on. Their main reporter Edison Carter(Matt Frewer) is always hot on the trail of a story, but one night, he gets knocked out with the last thing that he sees is something that says ""Max Headroom"" before losing consciousness. Computer genius Bryce(Chris Young)creates a computer generated alter ego of Carter's and the end result is a digital likeness of Edison Carter that keeps saying ""Max Headroom"" repeatedly, which is how he got it's name. Carter always continued getting to the bottom of things despite the objections of his producer Murray(Jeffrey Tambor), whose only thing is that he only wants to please the network executives and also, at the same time, tries to balance his job and his relationship with Edison, and his co-worker Theora Jones(Amanda Pays), who is a pseudo love interest for Edison though she really isn't that interested in him for that type of thing. The other competing TV networks and their allies try to stop Edison Carter every time, but Edison always stays one step ahead and even when he is down and supposedly out, he comes back with a vengeance to see that his stories and exposes make it to Network 23 and it's viewership despite the objections of Network 23 executives and the executives of all the other competing networks. Along the way, his computer generated alter ego Max Headroom also aids and abets Carter when it comes to getting what he needs to get done and is also Edison's staunchest ally when the going does get tough. Plus, Max is what Edison might be personality-wise as he stutters, makes cracks about the shows that the networks, including Network 23, show and also, all the things regarding TV. But, at times, Max also got on Edison's nerves and was also a pain in the neck to Edison during those times, especially when Max interrupted the live transmission of Network 23 by making cracks about sponsors and making fun of network business. Plus, in this fictional future, we see that that there are many barbaric themed TV shows with violence and other meaningless imagery. The show was always action packed and always kept you guessing until the bitter end.This show was launched in the wake of it's 60 minute British produced TV pilot that was called ""Max Headroom:20 Minutes Into The Future(called The Original Story for VHS home video release)"", and also, all the Coca Cola TV commercials that Max Headroom appeared in advertising the soft drink that were shown repeatedly from 1986 to 1987. Max Headroom, despite being a digitized ego of actor Matt Frewer, actually became a sex symbol for that brief time that he was in the world's spotlight. The series premiered on the ABC network and though British TV producers did produce the series, the vast majority of the actors were all US born. They simply asked Chrysalis Video and Lakeside Productions to produce an American form of the series for US television and they delivered. The show was a mid-season replacement for a show that ABC cancelled from it's schedule and the ratings were good enough to renew it for another season, but the ratings dropped because the show was in competition with other popular TV shows of the day, such as Dallas and Miami Vice. A total of 14 episodes were produced.I used to watch this show religiously back in the day when it was first running on the ABC network. I had become a fan of Max Headroom seeing all of those Coca Cola commercials that he appeared in constantly running on TV on all the major networks. I watched the show until the final episode was shown. It was a disappointment that this show didn't really get the chance that it truly deserved as it was one of the most original and most innovative TV shows ever created for the small screen. Again, it was a terrific show and was never dull.This DVD set has all 14 episodes of the series on four DVD's. There is also a fifth DVD of special features.PROS: The episodes of the TV series look as fresh and new as the day that they were originally broadcast. The episodes look very colorful and the audio sounds wonderful. The special features include six behind the scenes featurettes that includes interviews with the cast and crew talking about their experiences working on the show and how they all made it work. There are also talks with the writers and those who developed all the technological aspects of the show. There is also a small featurette, which features producer Brian Frankish sharing his reflections on being a producer for the show.CONS: Matt Frewer does not participate with the rest of the cast and crew in the featurettes on this DVD set. There are also no Max Headroom Coca Cola commercials as a feature, which would have also made this worth owning as well as it would have been a trip down memory lane back to the 1980's.Still, it is on DVD and that is wonderful and despite the shortcomings, it's still worth owning if you were a fan of Max Headroom.Overall, the Max Headroom TV series is worth revisiting if you were a fan of the series when it ran on TV. It is also worth revisiting if you were a fan of Max Headroom in general if you also enjoyed all the Coca Cola TV commercials that were always constantly being shown on TV when least expected on all the major networks. The point is that no fan of this series or even Max Headroom himself shouldn't be without this DVD set in their DVD libraries.",4,Wonderful Science Fiction TV Show Is Finally On DVD!,1327104000,"01

636062,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00005JNU5,Just Bill,"[15, 16]","Max Headroom was a TV show so far ahead of its time it was scary. I loved that bizarre-but-prescient show and couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD.Twenty years after the show first aired, my wait is over.I'm watching the Max Headroom DVDs as I type this. (Our local Barnes & Noble put them sale this week, ahead of street date.)I have good news and bad news.The good news: I'm watching Max Headroom on DVD. That, alone, deserves a hearty hip-hip-hooray! I can finally throw away the VHS tapes of the show I recorded from TV some 10-12 years ago. Those tapes have been through a flood, boxed in an outdoor storage unit during winter's frigid temps and summer's scorching heat, and endured so many playbacks that the images became thin as ghosts.The bad news: the picture on these DVDs is VHS quality. The colors are muddy. The color is grainy and seems overexposed to the point of harshness.The sound is fine, thankfully. But the images look just like they did on my VHS tapes, or when they were first broadcast on network TV.Granted, I'm viewing these episodes on a 42"" Philips flat-screen TV with 50,000:1 dynamic contrast. It's the sharpest picture possible. But other TV shows I own (Lost in Space, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Hawaii Five-O, Miami Vice, The Bob Newhart Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show, etc.) look great on my TV.The difference is those shows were remastered. It's obvious Max Headroom was not.That bugs me. A lot. For a show this groundbreaking, this important, you'd think the people who own the rights to it would have spent a little money to clean them up. If any show deserves to be remastered, it's Max Headroom.Alas, that's not the case.Another problem: The cuts from what used to be commercials is sometimes sudden. The screen doesn't go black and then come up on the next scene, smoothly and tastefully removing what would have been a commercial. A time or two, the cut was noticeably sudden.Another problem: The round-table discussion (on the special-features disc) with the cast doesn't include Matt Frewer, the star of the show. The round-table discussion is somewhat inane, even though it's cool to see the actors again. They said they hadn't been in the same room with each other for 23 years. They look like they're having fun being together again. Still, where's Matt?All in all, I'm glad to see Max Headroom again. I'm glad it's on DVD, a format that won't turn ghostly with repeated viewings.Unfortunately, it looks ghostly right off the bat, and -- thanks to the digital age -- will remain so forever.",4,"Fantastic Series, WAY Ahead Of Its Time...DVD Picture Grainy And Muddy",1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,2547,"['Max', 'Headroom', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', 'scary', 'loved', 'bizarre-but-prescient', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'released', 'DVD.Twenty', 'years', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'wait', 'over.I', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'DVDs', 'type', 'local', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'put', 'sale', 'week', 'ahead', 'street', 'date', 'have', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news.The', 'good', 'news', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'DVD', 'alone', 'hearty', 'hip-hip-hooray', 'can', 'finally', 'throw', 'away', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'show', 'recorded', 'TV', '10-12', 'years', 'ago', 'tapes', 'have', 'been', 'flood', 'boxed', 'outdoor', 'storage', 'unit', 'winter', 'frigid', 'temps', 'summer', 'scorching', 'heat', 'endured', 'so', 'many', 'playbacks', 'images', 'became', 'thin', 'ghosts.The', 'bad', 'news', 'picture', 'DVDs', 'VHS', 'quality', 'colors', 'are', 'muddy', 'color', 'grainy', 'overexposed', 'point', 'harshness.The', 'sound', 'fine', 'thankfully', 'images', 'look', 'just', 'did', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'broadcast', 'network', 'TV.Granted', ""'m"", 'viewing', 'episodes', '42', 'Philips', 'flat-screen', 'TV', '50,000:1', 'dynamic', 'contrast', 'sharpest', 'picture', 'possible', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'own', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Voyage', 'Bottom', 'Sea', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'etc', 'look', 'great', 'TV.The', 'difference', 'shows', 'were', 'remastered', 'obvious', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'was', 'bugs', 'lot', 'show', 'groundbreaking', 'important', ""'d"", 'think', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'rights', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'money', 'clean', 'up', 'show', 'be', 'remastered', 'Max', 'Headroom.Alas', 'not', 'case.Another', 'problem', 'cuts', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'commercials', 'sometimes', 'sudden', 'screen', ""n't"", 'go', 'black', 'then', 'come', 'up', 'next', 'scene', 'smoothly', 'tastefully', 'removing', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'commercial', 'time', 'two', 'cut', 'was', 'noticeably', 'sudden.Another', 'problem', 'round-table', 'discussion', 'special-features', 'disc', 'cast', ""n't"", 'include', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'star', 'show', 'round-table', 'discussion', 'somewhat', 'inane', 'even', 'cool', 'see', 'actors', 'again', 'said', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'same', 'room', 'other', '23', 'years', 'look', ""'re"", 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'together', 'again', 'Still', 'where', 'Matt', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'again', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DVD', 'format', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'ghostly', 'repeated', 'viewings.Unfortunately', 'ghostly', 'right', 'bat', 'thanks', 'digital', 'age', 'will', 'remain', 'so', 'forever']",Max Headroom: The Complete Series

All you die-hard fans of the show know what I'm talking about! So, how happy was I to learn that this show was finally coming to DVD!-I bought this the other week and it arrived really quickly.  I have watched the first 4 episodes, and WOW - it's STILL entertaining!  I was afraid that it would seem really cheesy after all this time (and it is, a little) but it still holds up REALLY well!  The show is just as entertaining and fun as ever!

636074,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00005JNU5,Robert Badgley,"[9, 10]","It is 20 minutes into the future and this is the world as the series Max Headroom sees it.A medium that has often been called a ""vast wasteland"" is now the very thing that populates and dominates this vast wasteland of a world.It is a post-apocalyptic like world where everyone and everything is ruled by television and the interference of a transmission is a worse transgression than even murder.Every man,woman and child has direct access to a set,which has become the opiate of the people.Consumerism rules and television dictates their tastes,what they wear,what they eat and what they can do.Although there are rebels(more often than not called"" blanks""),off switches for the medium are illegal.Network 23 dominates the airwaves with it's big Japanese backed sponsor the ""Zik-Zak"" Corporation.To illustrate just how dependant people are on television in this world there is an ep in which a huge apartment complex collapses.The thing most of the survivors cherish out of all their possessions is their tiny sets.Stock markets have been superseded by Ad markets where the big networks vie for sponsorship and money.Out getting the stories and hopefully boosting the ratings(which are monitored by all networks constantly)are the reporters and the most well known is Edison Carter(Max Frewer) of Network 23 with his vid-cam.His boss is Murray(Jeffrey Tambor)and his invaluable assistant at the other end of the camera is Theora(Amanda Pays).Mr.Cheviot(George Coe)is the top boss of Network 23 while Bryce(Chris Young) is the boy genius that created the shows namesake.Max Headroom was a computer generated construct Bryce created from the mind of Edison Carter after he suffered a serious head injury while trying to escape from the scene of one of his stories.Edison was fleeing on a motorcycle and his head struck a lift gate with the words""maximum headroom"" on it;thus it got shortened to Max Headroom.Max comes and goes on screen at will and coupled with an innate ability to adapt and learn,he makes a formidable but humorous presence on the Network airwaves with his many jibes and jokes;often at Network 23's expense.Also inhabiting this future world is Blank Reg(William Sheppard)and his assistant Dominic.They run their own small version of a television network with their ""Big Time TV"".They work with a low wattage and transmit out of a pink bus.Reg looks like an old punk rocker but he has an on going and mutually beneficial relationship with Edison and company.Max Headroom was certainly cutting edge stuff back in /87 and with a jaundiced 22 year look back we can easily overlook those floppy discs that pop up now and again as representing ""high tech"",those obviously 80s inspired get ups and the early work in animation,CGI and small models.But all in all this show still works tremendously as its' entire philosophy of people's obsession with television,the greed of networks,sponsors and their precious ""ratings"" which rule them and what we see,and the need for the real ""truth"" instead of all the spoon fed drivel on the airwaves;all are as valid today as they were in /87...even more so.Max Headroom was a huge presence on early MTV in the 80s and in commercials.I watch Max today(or should I say Matt Frewer) and I still find myself mesmerized by the effect.It may be comparatively old stuff now but Max still works beautifully and can still be absolutely hilarious,in a smart way.Technically this set has NOT been remastered.The Shout Factory isn't the only ones releasing non remastered TV shows(all the majors are doing it unfortunately),but Warners who owns the series seems to have provided Shout with decent prints so over all I can say I like it.Everything from picture to sound is generally good to very good.On top of the entire series on four DVDs the entire fifth disc is filled with featurettes on the story of Max,a couple of roundtables with some of the cast,and a look at the writing,the set rigging and animation creating of Max.The one person who is quite conspicuous by his absence is star Matt Frewer.He is not on any of the featurettes and the  11 page booklet that is included with this set doesn't even mention him by name(!).I find this strange to the nth degree.It is obvious Mr Frewer wanted nothing to do with the production of this set but I'll leave the ""whys"" to your imagination.Even though it was a long time coming this is one series that was highly anticipated by this fan and well worth the wait.It's cancellation back then still has me burning today.The last ep was aired about seven years after the series was cancelled so the last ep(that would really be second last)aired during its' initial run(""Lessons"")in North America is probably the most appropriate to have ended with.It is a scathing attack on the ratings system and as you watch it you can easily see its' creators giving ABC the middle finger through their tried and true mascot Max.This is a highly recommended DVD set and show.As an aside:look for two well known original series Star Trek actors in the 2nd show""Raking"" and one very well known Babylon 5 actor in many of the later eps(hint:he works for Network 66).",4,"""Morals are one thing,ratings are everything""",1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,5139,"['20', 'minutes',

636077,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00005JNU5,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[7, 9]","As many have said before Max Headroom was ahead of its time in a lot of ways. I believe this was the first, dystopic cyperpunk styled television series to be released on either side of the pond. And not many came after that. In other words all you William Gibson/Blade Runner fans out there should take note. This show was dark, gritty, and with loads of tech goodies. It delved into the same Gibson-type themes like class warfare, dependence on technology, the rise and domination of major corporations, and more. In many ways it takes on this material better than most cyberpunk movies did at the time.Max Headroom started off as a fictional computer construct that had his own show. Of course back then the technology wasn't there to make a decent enough computer generated image so the character was portrayed by Matt Frewer (Honey I Shrunk the Kids) with a lot of make up and video editing effects. The Max Headroom Show was essentially a music video program with Max as the host. The concept was Max was an artificial intelligence. People loved it. He also did Coke commercials, specials and even was featured in some songs. Then a TV movie called Max Headroom and 20 Minutes into the Future came to be. From there this television series was born.Building on the A.I. concept the show gave an origin for Max as the digital alter ego of a prolific news reporter Edison Carter from said dystopic future. In this future government is put to the side in place of big business, and the biggest are the television stations. So Edison goes around finding great exposes for his relatively benevolent TV megacorporation Network 23. So that's the premise in a nutshell. Lots of great ideas came from that including commercials that can fry your brain, pirate tv channels run from mobile vans, subliminal mind control, dream recording, and other crazy stuff.The Max Headroom series was really ahead of its time in a number of ways. A part of Edison's crew includes a ""controller"" that can access various public and security cameras as well as hack into security access and other subsystems rather easily. This controller also can pull up just about any information Edison needs from whatever database she accesses (Internet anyone?). Max himself seems to be able to talk to and get into just about any computer, television or other network device available. There are episodes that deal with gene manipulation on the fetal level, conspiracies to gain attention through false terrorist acts, people not acknowledged because they are not on any database, apocalyptic religions. This all may seem old hat these days. However television didn't really touch on a lot of these subjects in those days.So yes, Max Headroom is cool if you like this kind of stuff. Now this DVD has been a long time coming. All 14 episodes (that includes the one that didn't aire in the U.S.) are already slated. As for there being a Blu-Ray release it likely won't happen anytime soon. Shout! Factory hasn't had a Blu-Ray release yet. I don't think they have the resources for the remastering and touching up that is involved. Oh well. Maybe we'll see it 20 minutes in the future.",4,Lots of potential for a great DVD set.

Let's venture to the basement and find that old 1986 $2,000 Toshiba 30"" CTR TV I use to play my laser discs through. I connected the TV to the analog outputs of my DVD player. I sat down and started to watch episode one.  It was...clear, about the same as the regular TV channels seen through a converter box. But, the question remains, could it have been clearer.A video recorder VAR in Burbank (1970-1980s) did modify Bosch BCN??? video recorders for 24-frame at 10 MHz bandwidth, with twice the standard maximum 525-line NTSC resolution, equaling 1050 vertical lines of resolution.  So, the question is, was Max Headroom shot with such a system in the 80s?Note, interspersed in the shows are actual video tape recordings from various portable cameras, not possible to transfer from 30 FPS to 24 FPS.  You can clearly see that this footage is 30 FPS.  So, they probably shot the regular stuff on film and then edited it all onto 525 line resolution Video tape.What we got on DVD was transferred from 525 NTSC second or third generation copy video tape...a poor copy.  It's not even as clear as my BetaMax.  Yes, I found a copy of one of the shows I recoded in the 80s when it was originally broadcasted.  Maybe they lost the originals.I'm sure that to recreate...or create a higher def (720 DVD - 1080P Blu Ray) versions will take a much greater following.  This would necessitate reconstruct the series...providing they still had all that stuff.When they made these shows, 525 was all anyone had.  The same is true for the Norman Lear stuff like All in the Family, and other shoes like Night Court plus all the other straight video recorded TV shows.  Every one of these shows I saw was fuzzy on HD.So, I'll give Max 3 stars.  Yes, it's better than the bootleg copies.  No, it's not as good as it could be.You-know, I had to wait ten years for Granada Television to redo Sherlock Holmes.

Seeing much further than merely twenty minutes into the future, the writers' vision has proven prophetic in many ways; the whole world plugged in and ""hyper-connected,"" 24-hour news networks seeking ratings as the ultimate bottom line--truth be damned, the incestuous relationships of corporate media with politics, religion, and--most chillingly--law enforcement, data-mining, artificial intelligence, subliminal advertising, fertility clinics dabbling in eugenics, as well as the yawning economic and cultural divisions in an increasingly stratified and resource-strapped society. Dont get me wrong, this show is also great fun to watch, with lots of campy humor and comedic gestures to maintain narrative buoyancy. The look of the show may best be described as a kind of retro-futuristic with elements of '80s punk and classic dystopian sci-fi thrown in for good measure--think ""Blade Runner"" meets ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" The acting is surprisingly good, too, with the wonderful Matt Freuer in the dual role of TV-journalist Edison Carter and his wise-cracking cyber alter-ego Max Headroom (who was doing Jim Carey's schtick better than Jim Carey ever did long before ""In Living Color""); and strong supporting work from Jeffrey Tambor, George Coe, and the lovely Amanda Pays, not to mention a whole raft of interesting, then up-and-coming talent like Charles Rocket and Bill Maher.

But where I had hoped for all the quirky Max Headroom smart-alec remarks as the show went to commercial and unbelievably not even the Farwell Address were to be seen. They've given us the best digitized pictures of the official episodes, but that's it. The Bonus Disc is okay, good to see the partial cast reunion, they were amazed to see each other after all these years. The host really sits back most of the time and lets them talk which made it very personal. The absence of Matt Frewer is glaring to say the least, but getting some input from the writers and directors and producers provided some interesting insight. I am glad I still have the VHS tapes I made all those years ago and saved all these years. I'm not the most ardent Max Headroom fan and I'm almost wishing now I hadn't bought this set with these omissions. I must say, I don't really recommend buying it unless you really are a deeply connected fan. Borrow it from someone you know who has it if you just want to see it.As for the show, the best word I can use to to describe it is prescient. The core ideas behind the show are brilliant, looking back over the past 23 years it hit upon some really good questions. But the show was saddled with being rushed into production to make money NOW and just did not allow for the ideas to be properly analyzed and presented. The writing was mostly bland and faded to downright horrible in the end. I don't fault the actors, they did what they could with it. The show just needed more time to be discussed and logically thought out. The seeds were there. It was brilliant lambasting of network TV and society that could have been so much more.

While the presentation case is quite nice with its lenticular graphic, the quality of the DVDs show their age. Perhaps it's the way the series was originally shot, but the discs suffer the same fate as those comprising the Star Trek The Next Generation seasons sets in terms of low def video quality. It is obvious this Max was mastered off of video tape and not film, as virtually every shot borders on blurriness, and one can see the horizontal scan lines quite often. Sometimes, too, characters or objects throw off auras. My guess is that it would probably show better on an old CRT TV. Max Headroom, though, was a breakthrough series that costarred Amanda Pays, who later graced the similarly ahead of its time (also short-lived) the Flash. Did the Max expression, ""20 minutes into the future"" give rise to the later lament, ""That was so 20 minutes ago?"" As Number 2 from the Prisoner might say, ""That would be telling.""",3,Don't Expect HD from This One,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,974,"['rating', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'series', 'presentation', 'case', 'quite', 'nice', 'lenticular', 'graphic', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'show', 'age', 'Perhaps', 'way', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'discs', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'comprising', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'seasons', 'sets', 'terms', 'low', 'def', 'video', 'quality', 'obvious', 'Max', 'was', 'mastered', 'video', 'tape', 'not', 'film', 'virtually', 'shot', 'borders', 'blurriness', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'horizontal', 'scan', 'lines', 'quite', 'often', 'Sometimes', 'too', 'characters', 'objects', 'throw', 'off', 'auras', 'guess', 'would', 'probably', 'show', 'better', 'old', 'CRT', 'TV', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'though', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'series', 'costarred', 'Amanda', 'Pays', 'who', 'later', 'graced', 'similarly', 'ahead', 'time', 'also', 'short-lived', 'Flash', 'Did', 'Max', 'expression', '20', 'minutes', 'future', 'give', 'rise', 'later', 'lament', 'was', 'so', '20', 'minutes', 'ago', 'Number', '2', 'Prisoner', 'might', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'telling']",Max Headroom: The Complete Series
