1671954,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B00FL2F2UK,mk,"[11, 12]","Michael Landon Jr.(MLJ) delivers the next part of the Ultimate Gift.  Based on Jim Stovall's successful novel,  this movie emphasizes the importance of family and love over just money as seen through the saga of a rags to riches grandfather and the recipient of his riches, his grandson.I am a newbie to this series, having not read the book or seen the movie; however, I had no problem following the tale and the obvious message.  The grandson(this time played by handsome Logan Bartholomew- who has done other MLJ movies) is under pressure trying to run Grandpa's(James Garner- seen briefly via video) company.  His courtship with the love of his life(again played by Ali Hillis- she remains me of Amy Grant) hits a roadblock of conflict as she needs more and decides to head to Haiti to work as a nurse.The grandson flounders trying to keep balance in his life and to value what's really important.  He receives from long time family friend(another great veteran actor- Bill Cobbs) his granddad's journal.  Here, the story flashes back and relates the deceased patriarch's story- a Carnegie success of rising out of poverty by hard work ethic and determination.  We see the young man through thick and thin including hopping a freight train, working menial jobs but making an impression(with Peter Fonda), a brief scene of fighting in WWII and trying to strike it rich in the oil fields with neglected family in tow.All along, we know what's going to happen; there are no great revelations here, typical for this genre; although, I have to give MLJ a lot of credit for tying all these time periods and changing actors together, and doing it quite well for a pretty limited budget(I believe~3 million).  The filming is well done, and the actors solid enough.  This is a pleasant journey with drama, humor, moral theme and the veteran cameos(also must not forget, Lee Meriwether).They bundle it in a nice, family friendly, PG package, young kids will be bored, and the extras include a brief making of the movie, interviews with cast including Peter Fonda (giving us his take on life), deleted scenes and a music video.

Loved Drew Fuller as Jason and Abigail Breslin, an amazing young talent, was excellent as Emily Rose.  It was a fast paced, never a dull moment, entertaining story, which, in my opinion, did not need a sequel.  The iconic James Garner did well in explaining why he needed someone in his family responsible enough to entrust his fortune to.  After putting Jason, Drew Fuller, through a series of tests to find himself and what, ultimately, is the most important thing in life - the gift of giving, Jason proved himself worthy of his inheritance, which was used in part to build a research hospital dedicated to Emily Rose...the daughter of the woman he loved.That being said, I bought &#34;The Ultimate Life&#34; with the anticipation of learning what made &#34;Red&#34; tick, and that is what the movie is mostly about...Red's Steven's valuable lessons on what is REALLY important in life.  It jumped around a bit, from Jason's life and his present day struggles, back to the WWII era and Red Steven's life and his all-consuming greed for money, and the development of his friendship with Ted Hamilton (his lawyer who stuck by Red through thick or thin).Thank goodness Red kept a journal of his up and down struggles, which was eventually given to Jason by Hamilton.
