There IS NO movie here.  This is such a bad joke.  Don't buy this movie for your children.  I bought it for my son today and he came in after being in his bedroom trying to watch it and told me there was just a fire, I thought he forgot how to use his DVD remote.  I went in his room to show him how to play the actual movie, I'm an adult, to my surprise - there is no 98 minute movie.  That is total FRAUD!  DreamWorks should pull this move off the store shelves and make the correction, the ""movie"" is only 7:25 minutes long, that's a far cry from 98 minutes!!!!!

1426904,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B004RQ7ALU,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[2, 2]","After the delightful and in character ""Shrek the Halls"" Christmas special I had high hopes for ""Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular"" and I was sorely disappointed.  Not only does it frequently lift bits from the original (that felt like cheating me out of my moolah) but the narrative is extremely weak and serves mainly as a reason to have a variety of the Shrek cast, based out of the wonderful fourth film, to sing some lackluster reworked Christmas songs that don't come close to being ""chestnuts"".This may be far, far more enjoyable for the young ones but part of the delight of the Shrek movies/ series is that it was written for the adult just as much if not more than for the child.  This one misses that completely.  The extras are okay and pretty par for the course and you get (wait for it...) a Shrek themed yule log!  Trust me, don't try to sit through this.  If you make use of this feature just put it on in the background and walk away.  If you think that you've missed something it won't be worth your time to go back and try to see it.Avoid this like you would Shrek's boogers or earwax.

1426905,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B004RQ7ALU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","SHREK THE HALLS was a decent Shrek-themed Christmas movie. Therefore, I was looking forward to seeing what DONKEY&#8217;S CHRISTMAS SHREKTACULAR would be like. This &#8220;special&#8221; (if you can call it that-it has a running time of about 7 minutes including credits) has Donkey, Shrek, and the rest of the gang, including characters from SHREK FOREVER AFTER, gathering together to sing Christmas songs. All of the songs are shortened versions of songs; it&#8217;s as though the writers just threw together the first verse and part of a chorus for each piece and that&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s a few funny one-liners and Gingy has a running subplot of trying to get all of the non-living gingerbread cookies out of the place before someone eats them.The extras on the DVD include some music videos, an outtake of &#8220;Who I&#8217;d Be&#8221; from SHREK THE MUSICAL, some silly games, music videos from other Dreamworks animated features, almost the entire story of SHREK THE HALLS told in still animation form and voice over, and the &#8220;big&#8221; bonus is a Shrek-themed yule log! That sucker plays longer than all of the extra features and the Donkey&#8217;s Christmas Shrektacular combined. Overall, while it&#8217;s nice to see the Shrek characters in action again, they really aren&#8217;t screen much. There&#8217;s really nothing very Shreky or spectacular about this Christmas special.",2,Nothing Spectacular Here,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,1403,"['SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'was', 'decent', 'Shrek-themed', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'DONKEY', '8217', 'S', 'CHRISTMAS', 'SHREKTACULAR', 'would', 'be', '8220', 'special', '8221', 'can', 'call', 'that-it', 'running', 'time', '7', 'minutes', 'including', 'credits', 'Donkey', 'Shrek', 'rest', 'gang', 'including', 'characters', 'SHREK', 'FOREVER', 'AFTER', 'gathering', 'together', 'sing', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'shortened', 'versions', 'songs', '8217', 'writers', 'just', 'threw', 'together', 'first', 'verse', 'part', 'chorus', 'piece', '8217', 's', '8217', 'few', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'Gingy', 'running', 'subplot', 'trying', 'get', 'non-living', 'gingerbread', 'cookies', 'place', 'someone', 'them.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'music', 'videos', 'outtake', '8220', 'Who', '8217', 'Be', '8221', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'MUSICAL', 'silly', 'games', 'music', 'videos', 'other', 'Dreamworks', 'animated', 'features', 'almost', 'entire', 'story', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'told', 'still', 'animation', 'form', 'voice', '8220', 'big', '8221', 'bonus', 'Shrek-themed', 'yule', 'log', 'sucker', 'longer', 'extra', 'features', 'Donkey', '8217', 'Christmas', 'Shrektacular', 'combined', 'Overall', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'see', 'Shrek', 'characters', 'action', 'again', 'really', 'aren', '8217', 'screen', 'much', '8217', 'really', 'nothing', 'very', 'Shreky', 'spectacular', 'Christmas', 'special']",Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular
