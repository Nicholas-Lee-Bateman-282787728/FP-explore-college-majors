989528,A3GI6DS6I474K8,B000FG65SU,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[0, 0]","This is an awesome DVD and a must have for any Dio fan. Eagle Rock entertainment have done a much better job on this DVD than they did on Dio: Evil or Divine. While Evil or Divine contained a great show, the DVD's picutre was grainy and the sound wasn't the very best. This time around, we're presented with a widescreen version of the show with a crisp picture and great sound quality.The show itself opens up with some classic Rainbow and Sabbath tunes before delving into the classic 1983 Holy Diver album in its entirety and in sequence. Dio sounds great and although he's not accompanied by his 1983 lineup with Vinny Appice and Viv Campbell, he's got some excellent musicians: Doug Aldrich on guitar, Rudy Sarzo on bass, Simon Wright on drums, and Scott Warren on keyboards. It's a very similar lineup to his Evil or Divine concert.Once they're done with the set, they don't stop there; we're treated to some more songs spanning Dio's career, mainly with Rainbow. They give a great performance of ""Heaven and Hell"" (my favorite Sabbath song) and end the show with the usual ""We Rock"". As a bonus feature, there are some backstage interviews with the band.Whether you're a casual or longtime fan of Dio's, this is the best DVD out there. Evil or Divine had a great setlist, but the quality wasn't as good as this one yet still deserves to be seen. You might also want to check out some vintage Dio from 1986 with Sacred Heart: The DVD.",5,Dio at his best!,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,1440,"['awesome', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'Dio', 'fan', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'entertainment', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'DVD', 'did', 'Dio', 'Evil', 'Divine', 'Evil', 'Divine', 'contained', 'great', 'show', 'DVD', 'picutre', 'was', 'grainy', 'sound', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'best', 'time', 'around', ""'re"", 'presented', 'widescreen', 'version', 'show', 'crisp', 'picture', 'great', 'sound', 'quality.The', 'show', 'up', 'classic', 'Rainbow', 'Sabbath', 'tunes', 'delving', 'classic', '1983', 'Holy', 'Diver', 'album', 'entirety', 'sequence', 'Dio', 'great', 'not', 'accompanied', '1983', 'lineup', 'Vinny', 'Appice', 'Viv', 'Campbell', 'got', 'excellent', 'musicians', 'Doug', 'Aldrich', 'guitar', 'Rudy', 'Sarzo', 'bass', 'Simon', 'Wright', 'drums', 'Scott', 'Warren', 'keyboards', 'very', 'similar', 'lineup', 'Evil', 'Divine', 'concert.Once', ""'re"", 'done', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', ""'re"", 'treated', 'more', 'songs', 'spanning', 'Dio', 'career', 'mainly', 'Rainbow', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'favorite', 'Sabbath', 'song', 'end', 'show', 'usual', 'Rock', 'bonus', 'feature', 'are', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'band.Whether', ""'re"", 'casual', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Dio', 'best', 'DVD', 'there', 'Evil', 'Divine', 'had', 'great', 'setlist', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'one', 'yet', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'might', 'also', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'vintage', 'Dio', '1986', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'DVD']",N/A

989532,AGP9IA5IIG3VW,B000FG65SU,DerWeg,"[13, 14]","RJ Dio's voice still has much of its original fullness and colour well into the singer's (at least) seventh decade of life. At times you can tell he's pushing things just a little - but he has the SKILLS to know just where to back off & still sound great - masterful use of his still-viable voice after so many years. Time cannot conquer this little man. At moments Dio cannot help sounding a bit raspy/ old mannish (give him a break already) but more often than that his powerful vocal phrases leap out at you with staggering brilliance. Witness ""Gates of Babylon."" Yowza!!The band is fully professional, and note-on. They are also almost dour, especially the Scott keyboardist and Doug the guitarist. Rudy Sarzo on bass at least makes a show of rocking out & having a good time. Doug Aldrich seems a little disconnected & usually has little interaction at all with the singer onstage which seems odd. His playing is incredibly fluid and the guitar tones are perfect - just utterly flourishing and musical! Maybe he's just full-on player that night, no goofing around onstage because it's a live recording. Doug could easily stand in for Zakk Wilde or any player like that, with his endless capacity for aggressive, flashy tuneful playing (he tries to restrain it.) At times I'd wish Dio would NOT yodel over the solos, but you get used to that on repeat viewings I think, as you come around to like the small flaws of any recorded concert.You may feel the overall tuning sounds lower, and it is - to little ill effect usually. I'd rather bands do this than tire the singer's voice excessively. Dio's voice really warms up as he goes on in the set and at certain moments he evokes a much younger vocalist! Fans will rejoice.Overall this did not feel like a ""Rock in Rio"" type insanely fun concert (the crowd and band were both more subdued but hey this isn't Brazil.) Regardless, this sure is an exercise in brilliant musicality; a showcase of the enduring talent Dio still has, and some utterly monster guitar thrown in (a highly rewind-able bonus feature.)

Back then and throughout his career, he undoubtedly was phenomenal, had a monstrous vocal range and great theatrical performance. But on this DVD he is - like many other aging rock stars - trying to revive the glorious past unsuccessfully. It's like a former champion racehorse trying to win the race after 20+ years and ends up gasping behind. It just doesn't transpire anymore. It is not only about Dio's ability to hit his famous high pitches, it is about how it sounds and it does sound muffled and a bit rusty as his vocal cords are not as what they used to be. Even the audience is a little unamused and not fervid. Despite that distinction, I still think it is a good DVD for collectors because the music is great and Dio is really giving a wholehearted performance. I totally agree with some reviews here that the other band players (excluding Scott Warren - on the keyboard - who acts as a pissed off mummy for some reason), Rudy Sarzo gives a great stage performance unlike Jimmy Bain, Doug Aldrich is a fine guitarist with great style (but as much as I like him, he can't be compared with Blackmore or Vivian Campbell for that matters). I liked his Gates of Babylon's interpretation though. Much better than Malmstein's Inspirations CD version.

He's Ronnie James Dio, 63 years old, and he belts out the classics like he was 30 again.  Great DVD.  I watched it as soon as I got it, curious to see how one of the gods of heavy metal was still doing.  Older, a little ragged, but his voice is still full of piss and vinegar.  Doug Aldrich fills in for the injured Craig Goldy and he plays all the Holy Diver riffs and licks like he was Vivian Campbell reincarnated (I know Viv's not dead, but he may as well be).  The tunes aside from the complete Holy Diver album are all killer and some were a bit surprising.  Opening with Rainbow Rising's Tarot Woman was a real treat, and kicking out Sabbath's The Sign Of The Southern Cross was killer as well.  Aldrich is a phenomenal guitarist and he plays the Blackmore and Iommi tunes with heart.  Rudy Sarzo is on bass.  It's kinda funny to watch Rudy because he's still doing the same moves he did on the After Hours Show in 1981 when he was playing with Ozzy.  But he's a welcome change from the usual boringness of Jimmy Bain, and Rudy can play like a madman.  Simon Wright on drums.  Scott Warren on keyboards.  As Sarzo says in one of the interviews included on the DVD, there's something about this lineup that justs clicks and he's absolutely right.  Is it 1983 again?  It feels like it watching this show.

989542,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,B000FG65SU,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[2, 2]","I toyed with giving this just three stars but then decided to put it up to a four star release and my reasoning behind this, and my feelings about this release, can be summed up as below;Firstly Dio is a very early hard rock/identity and as such he deserves a certain amount of respect. Anyone working in such a demanding business as the music industry for that long deserves, nay, commands some level of appreciation. And Dio actually still has much of his once amazing voice which is truly inspiring when you think the guy must be getting ready to sign up for his social security cheque.Secondly it is quite obvious that the singer still enjoys much of what he does and is at peace with his past. This means that the concert, filmed in London, has a real celebratory feel which is deserved - it is after all the 25th anniversary of the release of Holy Diver, one of the more amazing albums from Ronnie's amazing career. This celebration factor comes across not only in the quality yet understated stage performances of the band but also the fact that the band absolutely adore the players and the material being offered up. The number of young faces in the crowd surprised me and was actually a high point for me.My third reason for enjoying this live DVD to the point of giving it four stars is that the material in question is of a very high standard. Personally I'm not in thrall to the legend of the Holy Diver album but such is the gusto with which it's attacked it really does come alive. Not to mention that his release is more than just a run through of the Holy Diver album, it also cherry picks from Ronnies back catalogue including work he did with the mercurial Mr Blackmore and Black Sabbath which really made me thing that he is quite at ease with his heritage within the heavy metal genre.My personal gut feeling is that if you are a Dio fan, or if you ever were a Dio fan you should pick this up, preferably cheap. You will get a traditional style heavy metal show with interesting players plying their trade honestly in front of an appreciative crowd. The stage production values are not lavish, but they are quite sufficient to blend in with the songs and the bonus interview footage while not earth shattering is actually not too bad in that it isn't a relentless back slapping session.

And that's who this show is all about... The singer. The ""alpha male"" of the band.Dio starts out a 1/3 of the show with a raspy voice such as a guy who smokes 3 packs a day (and I don't think Ronnie is a smoker). The 2/3 of the show it starts to come together and the last part of the show sounds great.Always his timing is great and he's right on but with age limitations.It starts with Elf tunes, Rainbow, Sabbath and then the solo material.It's a very good show AGAIN for a guy in his 60's.If your looking for the 1983 Dio you're not going to find him here.The camera work is top notch and the sound exceptional but maybe with exception to the mix regarding the musicians (guitar). The vocal is always VERY clear and pronounced. Maybe at some times too pronounced.This is the first Dio video I've purchased so I don't know if there's better choices.The video was cool though. I don't think I'll watch it again because there's so many better selections available but I'm not disappointed.If your a big RJD fan I don't think you'll be let down. A ""semi"" fan should also find this video entertaining. Less than that, find another Dio video.Happy Viewing.UPDATE (12-21-2007): Without mentioning I saw this video, a buddy told me that Dio had a cold this evening and recommended purchasing another DVD...

989545,A2AY6WTLHYSJB,B000FG65SU,R. Spiker,"[9, 9]","I just received my blu-ray copy of this concert and first impressions are;The Video;Excellent! Superb clarity and contrast with lots of great camera shots. Black levels are deep and inky and shadow detail is impressive, especially on Dio's outfit. If I had anything to complain about it would be the typical rock show editing where the viewer is rarely given more than a second or two with any given shot. Due to the editing, I give the video 4.5 out of 5 stars, otherwise it's stellar.Audio;For a blu-ray DTS-HDMA lossless soundtrack, it comes off as a little lackluster. I have a nice 7.2 surround system that's clean and loud.  After a few tunes I started to check things out as it just didn't sound right and much to my surprise, there is nothing eminating from the center channel. After doing some system checks and confirming that it wasn't the surround sound equipment, I noticed that suddenly, right at the time the Fan jumped up on stage and grabbed Ronnie James, when he spoke a bit, voila, the sound briefly came out of the center channel so I knew the disc wasn't defective. But as soon as they started the next song, again, no center channel. Wierd! Otherwise, the sound was OK but nothing exceptional. The guitar seemed weak and I kept longing for someone to ""turn it up"" a bit. It also seemed as though the band as a whole could have been mixed with more upper midrange as it sounded kind of ""muffled"" to a small degree. I give the audio 3 out of 5 stars.Overall, this blu-ray should please Dio fans. It's not a show from back in the day when the energy was intense as were the musicians but there are some moments that will bring back those memories for sure. And the fact that they did Holy Diver from start to finish is well worth the price of admission.R.I.P. Ronnie James. You were an extraordinary frontman and an even more extraordinary human being who touched a lot of lives.Edit; I relistened to this a few times and am still at a loss as to why there is no center channel. So I sent an e-mail to eaglerock.com and got this reply;""Hi RandyThank you for purchasing our Dio Holy Diver Blu Ray!You are indeed correct - there is only a center channel when Ronnie is talking between tracks.

DIO, the band, and the Man, is a powerhouse , and an essentially Brilliant Artist.Gimmicks or not, this man and this band, can do Rock wonders, truly miraculous.I have a tape of a 1977 concert that Ronnie James Dio did with RAINBOW, and the quality of the concert is the same, just better recording in this show ( and thankfully, the 77 concert is available on DVD, so DIO's legacy over 3 decades can be vividly illustrated), and much better separate  tracks ( in the 5.1 I mean) in the 2005 show recording. How this man can maintain his voice at such a high quality for so many years is beyond me.Doug Aldridge, the so called ""Fill-in"" guitarist is almost note perfect. The Bass is Brilliant. Drums are beyond good, and the solo shows this off. The Keyboard work is great,and is most prominent in the start of GATES OF BABYLON.The Credits state that DIO mixed the show, but it is not clear if that means Ronnie, or the whole band.About the only criticism  in 5.1 regular, is that the  middle channel drops during songs, and returns during breaks. Hopefully this will be different during a DTS  playback which I don't have at this time.

Now he gets to look down from the top of the Silver Mountain on so much that he inspired and influenced. So it's about time that this live performance of Holy Diver be released on Blu Ray. It wasoriginally released on DVDin 2006, so I can tell you that the production defines how a music DVD should be done.This performance of the 2005 Holy Diver tour was captured live at London's Astoria. The show features the Holy Diver album in its entirety, from start to finish, with other Dio, Rainbow and Black Sabbath classics.The concert portion of the disk is all show. No indulgence by some videographer that thinks a viewer wants to see effects like cut to black and white or split screen pop ups. The picture is crystal clear, and most importantly, the video doesn't jump around every 4 seconds, so you really get to see the performance in a way that feels like you have a front row seat to the concert instead of sitting there watching a DVD. The sound is terrific. If you've got a surround system you're in for a pounding Heavy Metal experience.Ronnie was really up for this show; there's barely a crack in the vocal armor that had been RJD's signature sound for more than 30 years. Missing are Jimmy Bain, Vinnie Appice and Viv Cambell. In are a group of guys with some impressive resumes: Rudy Sarzo on Bass, Simon Wright on Drums, Doug Aldrich is spectacular on guitar (Craig Goldy was out on injured reserve) and Scott Warren on keyboards. All of the guys are on. They clearly committed to each other to give performances that were true to the studio versions, and their performances indeed channel the original line-up precisely.You get:1. ""Tarot Woman""2. ""Sign Of The Southern Cross""3. ""One Night In The City""4. ""Stand Up And Shout""5. ""Holy Diver""6. ""Gypsy""7. ""Caught In The Middle""8. ""Don't Talk To Strangers""9.

The sound through the DTS is wonderful and I like the fact that we get a straight ahead show with no cheap effects!
