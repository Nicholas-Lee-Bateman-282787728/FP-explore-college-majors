This movie is decently made, but is far inferior to the the other movies about people with the same condition, particularly Mozart and the Whale. Dancy's portrayal of an Aspie feels strained at times - it's almost as if he watched the other movies to see how the actors played the characters inflicted with it, rather than going out and researching the condition, its symptoms, and maybe meeting people who were affected by it. Yet, the story of the one man's struggle with the condition and a woman's struggle to have a relationship with him is an intriguing concept and worth exploring.",3,"promising, and interesting in its plot, but flaky on the acting",1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,702,"['Hugh', 'Dancy', 'young', 'man', 'Asperger', 'syndrome', 'who', 'forced', 'find', 'father', 'away', 'movie', 'decently', 'made', 'far', 'inferior', 'other', 'movies', 'people', 'same', 'condition', 'particularly', 'Mozart', 'Whale', 'Dancy', 'portrayal', 'Aspie', 'feels', 'strained', 'times', 'almost', 'watched', 'other', 'movies', 'see', 'how', 'actors', 'played', 'characters', 'inflicted', 'rather', 'going', 'out', 'researching', 'condition', 'symptoms', 'maybe', 'meeting', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'affected', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'condition', 'woman', 'struggle', 'have', 'relationship', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'worth', 'exploring']",N/A

Cullison ""obie-wan-kenobi""","[4, 5]","This is a very good movie and it takes the next step from the ""Rain Man"" autism stereotype to a more contemporary perspective of the high functioning atypical autistic person.In the movie, Adam is portrayed as having Aspergers Syndrome.  He is college educated and is self aware of his challenges. Many people associate autism with savant gifts, such as counting cards (as in Rain Man).  This is more atypical than most people know, but in the movie Adam's gift is that of astronomy.My personal opinion about the accuracy of the film has to do with the diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome as related to other levels and spectrums of the autism scale.  Adam slaps himself in the face, has anxiety attacks, demonstrated destructive tendencies, and even hit his head in a mirror.  I would suggest that these behaviors are slightly downscale from a conventional Aspergers Syndrome diagnosis.Now, in all fairness, the discussion and parameters associated with different levels of autism are still vague and ambiguous. Also, in all fairness to the movie itself, Adam had recently lost his father resulting in him being left alone, fired from his job, had a fight with his girl, man-handled by the police, and was overall extremely stressed from situations that infrequently occur; especially all at once.  Most autistic people have developed complex coping mechanisms.  Stress can shed those coping layers back to reveal a less capable and more vulnerable autistic person.I am grateful that the movie sheds more light on the world of the autism.  The years between the institutionalized Rain Man and this independent living Adam have hopefully removed and/or at least changed the perception/stereotype of the high functioning atypical autistic person.[...]",4,A new contemporary perception of autism.,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,1746,"['very', 'good', 'movie', 'next', 'step', 'Rain', 'Man', 'autism', 'stereotype', 'more', 'contemporary', 'perspective', 'high', 'functioning', 'atypical', 'autistic', 'person.In', 'movie', 'Adam', 'portrayed', 'having', 'Aspergers', 'Syndrome', 'college', 'educated', 'self', 'aware', 'challenges', 'Many', 'people', 'associate', 'autism', 'savant', 'gifts', 'such', 'counting', 'cards', 'Rain', 'Man', 'more', 'atypical', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'movie', 'Adam', 'gift', 'astronomy.My', 'personal', 'opinion', 'accuracy', 'film', 'do', 'diagnosis', 'Aspergers', 'Syndrome', 'related', 'other', 'levels', 'spectrums', 'autism', 'scale', 'Adam', 'face', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'demonstrated', 'destructive', 'tendencies', 'even', 'hit', 'head', 'mirror', 'would', 'suggest', 'behaviors', 'are', 'slightly', 'downscale', 'conventional', 'Aspergers', 'Syndrome', 'diagnosis.Now', 'fairness', 'discussion', 'parameters', 'associated', 'different', 'levels', 'autism', 'are', 'still', 'vague', 'ambiguous', 'Also', 'fairness', 'movie', 'Adam', 'had', 'recently', 'lost', 'father', 'resulting', 'being', 'left', 'alone', 'fired', 'job', 'had', 'fight', 'girl', 'man-handled', 'police', 'was', 'overall', 'extremely', 'stressed', 'situations', 'infrequently', 'occur', 'especially', 'once', 'Most', 'autistic', 'people', 'have', 'developed', 'complex', 'coping', 'mechanisms', 'Stress', 'can', 'shed', 'coping', 'layers', 'back', 'reveal', 'less', 'capable', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'autistic', 'person.I', 'am', 'grateful', 'movie', 'more', 'light', 'world', 'autism', 'years', 'institutionalized', 'Rain', 'Man', 'independent', 'living', 'Adam', 'have', 'hopefully', 'removed', 'and/or', 'least', 'changed', 'perception/stereotype', 'high', 'functioning', 'atypical', 'autistic', 'person.', '[', ']']",N/A

Even the ending was not what you would have expected.It deals with Asperger's in a sensitive way, and does mention the fact that it is a ""spectrum,"" meaning not every individual will act identically to Adam.

When you're an Aspie, you grow up feeling that everybody else has a secret they are not telling you, that you are being excluded from what everyone else seems to know, that you are for some mysterious reason shut out from the human race.  The worst thing any one can do to you is confirm all these fears by TRICKING you and making a FOOL out of you, using your weakness AGAINST you.  What Beth did to Adam was ten times worse than if she had cheated on him sexually - that is at least something that might happen to anybody.  But her betrayal caused Adam to turn on himself, beating his head and screaming, ""Dumb Adam!""  It was as if she'd cut his heart out and then forced the knife into his hand.I was actually more than a bit critical of her even before that, though.  I didn't like the way she made him go to that party when she knew it would make him miserable, and she didn`t even seem to care.  I didn`t like the way she got apologetic when he acted like himself in front of her friends and parents.  And I didn't like the way she discounted his opinion about writing; I thought he had a good point - a raccoon should not be an accountant!  But no, she said in that sneery way, ""You would"" (think that).  As if his point of view were worthless.  I was sorry when they broke up, but after I'd thought about it I realized that she would only have continued to hurt and belittle him if they stayed together.

1316200,A285W3N2KHGII1,B0030Y12FU,Andrew Greimann,"[3, 3]","People often mention that this is a romantic comedy of sorts, but it really is more than this, as the making was inspired by the director listening to a story of a real man with Asperger's on the radio, and then creating a completely fictional story to try to portray a few characteristics. This film is about as serious as any other that you would find covering this genre, but it does indeed have its lighter moments at the same time, and a *much* better understanding than movies before it, and overall, it is very well-done.Interestingly enough, I initially watched this movie last summer as I decided to find out about Asperger's to learn more about it, even though this is a fictional story. I have watched it several times since to try to comprehend the movie more, and I believe I finally understand enough to write a review on it.- Firstly, I will certainly congratulate this movie over its time, effort, and the ability to portray an average character, without resorting to the extremes or stereotypes, etc. that other movies covering a character with an ASD have done with zero research and a humiliating script. &#34;Adam&#34; does the opposite--it reveals time and detail, as it reflects work to get the script done right, and to show the character as realistically as possible throughout the film. For example, there are several scenes, such as: where Adam smashes through a mirror, when the sound and blur simulate a pre-shutdown aura in the scene where Adam is walking out, the police scene, and where Adam is talking to Beth's father in the theater are all filmed well. Additionally, the scene where the clock volume is 'turned up', and when Beth knocks on the door are both memorable.- Secondly, however, I did want to critique the movie a bit. Certain scenes that were shown as demonstrating Adam's symptoms were subtle or could be easily mistaken as dramatization for those who aren't familiar with what Asperger's is. Some characteristics--such as the fixation on the spinning model on the desk, were not defined as being significant, with shortened time lengths, and without reading it before watching the film, some scenes will not make as much sense as a viewer. Also, one thing the movie fails to mention is that the reason ASD is described as a &#34;spectrum&#34; is because no two people on it will look, act, or even completely think the same, (though the characteristics to meet it will be) and therefore, Adam cannot be seen as being the entire set of people inside one character. Rather, the movie was simply made to be entertaining.- And lastly, for more conscientious viewers of movies (such as myself) there are a few sexual/suggestive scenes in this flick that are brief that you may wish to skip over, as they do not really contribute to the movie's core point anyway. There is also one use of God's name when Adam is eating lunch on the park bench, and use of the f-word in the meltdown scene by Beth, along with a few minor words in the movie, for those monitoring content of the movie before they rent.Overall, I give this movie four stars for a subtle musical score that pairs excellently with the movie, a fresh, new look at ASDs in adulthood that &#34;Rain Man&#34; failed miserably at in the last generation, and for attention to detail packaged inside a love story that I would strongly recommend seeing, especially if you want to understand a friend or relative that has an ASD a bit more--but I would definitely watch it carefully to see the details. I hope this review helps whoever reads it; please vote this as helpful if it helped you.",4,A subtle--yet well-detailed film,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,3585,"['People', 'often', 'mention', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'really', 'more', 'making', 'was', 'inspired', 'director', 'listening', 'story', 'real', 'man', 'Asperger', 'radio', 'then', 'creating', 'completely', 'fictional', 'story', 'try', 'portray', 'few', 'characteristics', 'film', 'as', 'serious', 'other', 'would', 'find', 'covering', 'genre', 'indeed', 'have', 'lighter', 'moments', 'same', 'time', '*much*', 'better', 'understanding', 'movies', 'overall', 'very', 'well-done.Interestingly', 'enough', 'initially', 'watched', 'movie', 'last', 'summer', 'decided', 'find', 'out', 'Asperger', 'learn', 'more', 'even', 'fictional', 'story', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'try', 'comprehend', 'movie', 'more', 'believe', 'finally', 'understand', 'enough', 'write', 'review', 'it.-', 'Firstly', 'will', 'certainly', 'congratulate', 'movie', 'time', 'effort', 'ability', 'portray', 'average', 'character', 'resorting', 'extremes', 'stereotypes', 'etc', 'other', 'movies', 'covering', 'character', 'ASD', 'have', 'done', 'zero', 'research', 'humiliating', 'script', '34', 'Adam', '34', 'opposite', 'time', 'detail', 'work', 'get', 'script', 'done', 'right', 'show', 'character', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', 'film', 'example', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'such', 'where', 'Adam', 'mirror', 'when', 'sound', 'blur', 'simulate', 'pre-shutdown', 'aura', 'scene', 'where', 'Adam', 'walking', 'out', 'police', 'scene', 'where', 'Adam', 'talking', 'Beth', 'father', 'theater', 'are', 'filmed', 'well', 'Additionally', 'scene', 'where', 'clock', 'volume', ""'turned"", 'up', 'when', 'Beth', 'door', 'are', 'memorable.-', 'Secondly', 'however', 'did', 'want', 'critique', 'movie', 'bit', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'shown', 'demonstrating', 'Adam', 'symptoms', 'were', 'subtle', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'mistaken', 'dramatization', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'what', 'Asperger', 'characteristics', 'such', 'fixation', 'spinning', 'model', 'desk', 'were', 'not', 'defined', 'being', 'significant', 'shortened', 'time', 'lengths', 'reading', 'watching', 'film', 'scenes', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'viewer', 'Also', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'mention', 'reason', 'ASD', 'described', '34', 'spectrum', '34', 'two', 'people', 'will', 'look', 'act', 'even', 'completely', 'think', 'same', 'characteristics', 'meet', 'will', 'be', 'therefore', 'Adam', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'being', 'entire', 'set', 'people', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'made', 'be', 'entertaining.-', 'lastly', 'more', 'conscientious', 'viewers', 'movies', 'such', 'are', 'few', 'sexual/suggestive', 'scenes', 'flick', 'are', 'brief', 'may', 'wish', 'skip', 'over', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'contribute', 'movie', 'core', 'point', 'anyway', 'also', 'one', 'use', 'God', 'name', 'when', 'Adam', 'eating', 'lunch', 'park', 'bench', 'use', 'f-word', 'meltdown', 'scene', 'Beth', 'few', 'minor', 'words', 'movie', 'monitoring', 'content', 'movie', 'rent.Overall', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'subtle', 'musical', 'score', 'excellently', 'movie', 'fresh', 'new', 'look', 'ASDs', 'adulthood', '34', 'Rain', 'Man', '34', 'failed', 'miserably', 'last', 'generation', 'attention', 'detail', 'packaged', 'love', 'story', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'especially', 'want', 'understand', 'friend', 'relative', 'ASD', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'carefully', 'see', 'details', 'hope', 'review', 'whoever', 'please', 'vote', 'helpful', 'helped']",N/A

But Adam (3.5 stars out of 5) is a movie that has a heart and soul that Dear John only acted like it had. Having watched both movies this weekend, it's ironic how similar yet different they are. The production design and photography is better in Dear John, but the writing and acting in Adam is what makes it stand out. I'm sure Adam had a single-digit percentage of the budget that Dear John had, but the filmmakers squeezed every cent out of it. It's not a flashy film, but solidly crafted. The casting was spot on for all of the characters in the film, and I found myself escaping into the world created by writer/director Max Mayer.There's a subtle and loving simplicity to the story and the lead character of Adam, played convincingly and perfectly by actor Hugh Dancy. From the first scenes of the movie, I was immediately drawn into Adam's world. I wanted to understand his life and the challenges he has having Asperger's Syndrome (a high functioning version of Autism). Asperger's seems to be a ""popular"" condition lately in TVs and movies, as it is highlighted in Dear John, Parenthood, and Adam. I saw a bit of myself in Adam, because he's really just another guy growing up and learning how to be an adult. He's a little behind the rest of us at age 29, but the journey feels so similar to me. He fears change and likes routine. He doesn't know how to socially interact with people, especially women. Adam lost his mother when he was a child and grew up living only with his father, until his recent death. Now Adam is on his own and he is forced to change and mature simply to survive. He also loses his job, which of course adds to the frustration and difficulty Adam feels.By the end of the movie, we've gone on a journey with Adam...and his neighbor and love interest Beth, played by Rose Byrne. It's an interesting journey in which there isn't a perfect Hollywood happy ending, and yet it is a hopeful ending. It's small indie films like Adam that give me hope and inspiration as a filmmaker. I'm glad to see that these movies are still being made, even though most of Hollywood is focused on big budget blockbuster sequels for comic book and action heroes. Adam is a hero in my eyes...for living his life the best that he can with the tough circumstances he's been given. This film made me think about how we all have a place in this world of ours. We all have a role to play. Adam is brilliant and extremely intelligent in his own way, especially with astronomy and science.

I won't spoil it for anyone but, needless to say, it seemed like it was a bit of a filler.The main love story works mainly because of the onscreen chemistry between Hugh Dancy's quirky Asperger's syndrome affected persona and Rose Byrne's caring understanding and funloving view on life.The extras on the DVD are run of the mill although the interview of Rose Byrne by three film students was a nice change of pace.Great to see the corrupt captain from ""The Wire"" in a classic bit part as a friend of Dancy's recently deceased father who plays a bit of a replacement father figure in his scenes.",4,quirky and the actors save this,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,784,"['storyline', 'movie', 'bit', 'thin', 'lead', 'actors', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'pull', 'off', 'thought', 'whole', 'scandal', 'involving', 'Byrne', 'character', 'family', 'was', 'tad', 'contrived', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'needless', 'say', 'seemed', 'was', 'bit', 'filler.The', 'main', 'love', 'story', 'mainly', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'quirky', 'Asperger', 'syndrome', 'affected', 'persona', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'caring', 'understanding', 'funloving', 'view', 'life.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'run', 'mill', 'interview', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'three', 'film', 'students', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'pace.Great', 'see', 'corrupt', 'captain', 'Wire', 'classic', 'bit', 'part', 'friend', 'Dancy', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'who', 'bit', 'replacement', 'father', 'figure', 'scenes']",N/A

1316205,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B0030Y12FU,Charity Bishop,"[1, 2]","It can be difficult to live with someone who has Asperger Syndrome. Most people have never even heard of it, but those who have know that the people with it are very special, very unique, and very blunt. Adam is a film that explores the life of a young man who has it, and the woman he becomes involved with. It is an interesting film that gives a hint of the challenges those with the syndrome possess, but also has an unrealistic conclusion.Everything has just changed for Adam (Hugh Dancy). His father has died. That is monumental for anyone, but more so for Adam, who has relied on him for everything since he was a child. An extremely bright, obsessive person who eats the exact same meals every day, at the exact same time, and expects his life to be in perfect order, Adam is not like most people. Adam has Asperger Syndrome -- something his new upstairs neighbor Beth (Rose Byrne) does not fully understand when she runs into him while doing her laundry in the machines downstairs. At first she thinks Adam is just withdrawn, then a bit strange, but when he tells her about his social anxiety and the eccentricities that make it hard for him not to show his excessively logical nature, Beth is intrigued. Adam is the sweetest young man she has never known, and in spite of cautions from her coworkers, she starts spending more time with him.Dealing with the loss of his father is a challenge but even more devastating is when Adam loses his job due to downsizing in the company. His former boss assumes Adam's dad will merely explain his condition to the next business and assist him in obtaining another job, but of course that now cannot happen. Adam soon comes to rely on Beth, who might need more than Adam can provide for her as she deals with the arrest and trial of her father (Peter Gallagher), who has been accused of underhanded dealings in his prestigious law firm. The film is unique but will generate a variety of responses within the viewer: for someone who has no contact with anyone with this syndrome, it will be an eye-opening but not always accurate experience. For someone like me, who is very close to someone who does have the syndrome, it can be almost painful at times, because it explores the helplessness of Adam's situation and can be, in my mother's words, ""depressing"" as a result.It is apparent that the writer / director knows something about the syndrome, but not everything and as a result he attempts to brighten the harshness of the picture with ""a sort of happy ending"" that isn't possible given Adam's severe social anxiety. The concept of the movie is quite sweet but can also be heavy at times, since it deals with a variety of topics ranging from the loss of family members to a dependency. It takes an interesting approach in contrasting Adam's brutal honesty with the deceptiveness of Beth's father. And it doesn't shy away from pointing out Adam's quirks or Beth's inability to deal with them. She makes the mistake of expecting him to behave ""normally,"" even though his unusual behavior is what draws her to him in the first place. Depending on the viewer takes it, it could also imply that people with the syndrome do not love as deeply as others do, and that is untrue: they merely don't know how to express their love like the rest of us.As a film it is well photographed, beautifully acted, and has some genuinely charming scenes, but the ending seems weird and not in sync with the rest of the movie. (Perhaps I am so accustomed to ""love stories"" that to have a twist like this one surprised me.) At times it can be downright melancholy and some of its themes might prove emotional for certain audiences, but its depictions of the syndrome are spot on -- the need for routine, a very black and white view of right and wrong, various behavioral tendencies, endlessly talking about one topic, and an inability to read people's emotions based on their physical responses. The content is not too much of an issue but does bear mentioning -- there are two f-words said close together, as well as several harsh abuses of deity and mild profanities. Adam embarrasses Beth early on in their friendship by asking her if she was aroused by an experience they had in the park. Beth says they will take the romance slow but after a month they enter into an intimate relationship. (She puts his hand inside her blouse and he asks if this means she wants sex; she says yes.) Conversation revolves around a man's extra-marital affairs and the impact it has on his family.I had to do a lot of thinking about this movie before writing a review because the subject is close to my heart. I am blessed to know someone like Adam and so the film meant more to me than it would to a common viewer. It is a good introduction into what life is like for someone facing these challenges, but is not always truthful in how various situations are dealt with. It hints to the audience that certain things can simply be overcome by force of will, and the reality is that no, they can't. That aside, it is a moving film that will stick with you a long time.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,5082,"['can', 'be', 'difficult', 'live', 'someone', 'who', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'Most', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'who', 'have', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'special', 'very', 'unique', 'very', 'blunt', 'Adam', 'film', 'life', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'involved', 'interesting', 'film', 'hint', 'challenges', 'syndrome', 'possess', 'also', 'unrealistic', 'conclusion.Everything', 'just', 'changed', 'Adam', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'father', 'died', 'monumental', 'anyone', 'more', 'so', 'Adam', 'who', 'relied', 'everything', 'was', 'child', 'extremely', 'bright', 'obsessive', 'person', 'who', 'exact', 'same', 'meals', 'day', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'life', 'be', 'perfect', 'order', 'Adam', 'not', 'most', 'people', 'Adam', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'something', 'new', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'Beth', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'when', 'doing', 'laundry', 'machines', 'downstairs', 'first', 'Adam', 'just', 'withdrawn', 'then', 'bit', 'strange', 'when', 'social', 'anxiety', 'eccentricities', 'make', 'hard', 'not', 'show', 'excessively', 'logical', 'nature', 'Beth', 'intrigued', 'Adam', 'sweetest', 'young', 'man', 'never', 'known', 'spite', 'cautions', 'coworkers', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'him.Dealing', 'loss', 'father', 'challenge', 'even', 'more', 'devastating', 'when', 'Adam', 'job', 'due', 'downsizing', 'company', 'former', 'boss', 'Adam', 'dad', 'will', 'merely', 'explain', 'condition', 'next', 'business', 'assist', 'obtaining', 'job', 'course', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'happen', 'Adam', 'soon', 'rely', 'Beth', 'who', 'might', 'need', 'more', 'Adam', 'can', 'provide', 'arrest', 'trial', 'father', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'been', 'accused', 'underhanded', 'dealings', 'prestigious', 'law', 'firm', 'film', 'unique', 'will', 'generate', 'variety', 'responses', 'viewer', 'someone', 'who', 'contact', 'anyone', 'syndrome', 'will', 'be', 'eye-opening', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'experience', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'close', 'someone', 'who', 'have', 'syndrome', 'can', 'be', 'almost', 'painful', 'times', 'helplessness', 'Adam', 'situation', 'can', 'be', 'mother', 'words', 'depressing', 'result.It', 'apparent', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'something', 'syndrome', 'not', 'everything', 'result', 'brighten', 'harshness', 'picture', 'sort', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'possible', 'given', 'Adam', 'severe', 'social', 'anxiety', 'concept', 'movie', 'quite', 'sweet', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'heavy', 'times', 'variety', 'topics', 'ranging', 'loss', 'family', 'members', 'dependency', 'interesting', 'approach', 'contrasting', 'Adam', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'deceptiveness', 'Beth', 'father', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'pointing', 'out', 'Adam', 'quirks', 'Beth', 'inability', 'deal', 'mistake', 'expecting', 'behave', 'normally', 'even', 'unusual', 'behavior', 'what', 'first', 'place', 'Depending', 'viewer', 'could', 'also', 'imply', 'people', 'syndrome', 'do', 'not', 'love', 'as', 'deeply', 'others', 'do', 'untrue', 'merely', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'express', 'love', 'rest', 'us.As', 'film', 'well', 'photographed', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'scenes', 'ending', 'weird', 'not', 'sync', 'rest', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'so', 'accustomed', 'love', 'stories', 'have', 'twist', 'one', 'surprised', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'downright', 'melancholy', 'themes', 'might', 'prove', 'emotional', 'certain', 'audiences', 'depictions', 'syndrome', 'are', 'spot', 'need', 'routine', 'very', 'black', 'white', 'view', 'right', 'wrong', 'various', 'behavioral', 'tendencies', 'endlessly', 'talking', 'one', 'topic', 'inability', 'read', 'people', 'emotions', 'based', 'physical', 'responses', 'content', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'issue', 'bear', 'mentioning', 'are', 'two', 'f-words', 'said', 'close', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'harsh', 'abuses', 'deity', 'mild', 'profanities', 'Adam', 'Beth', 'early', 'friendship', 'asking', 'was', 'aroused', 'experience', 'had', 'park', 'Beth', 'will', 'take', 'romance', 'slow', 'month', 'enter', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'hand', 'blouse', 'sex', 'yes', 'Conversation', 'around', 'man', 'extra-marital', 'affairs', 'impact', 'family.I', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'thinking', 'movie', 'writing', 'review', 'subject', 'close', 'heart', 'am', 'blessed', 'know', 'someone', 'Adam', 'so', 'film', 'meant', 'more', 'would', 'common', 'viewer', 'good', 'introduction', 'what', 'life', 'someone', 'facing', 'challenges', 'not', 'always', 'truthful', 'how', 'various', 'situations', 'are', 'dealt', 'audience', 'certain', 'things', 'can', 'simply', 'be', 'overcome', 'force', 'will', 'reality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'aside', 'moving', 'film', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'time']",N/A

My main reason for watching this was because it was a romantic film and because Rose Byrne was on the cover.  I love Rose Byrne.Anyhow Adam falls for Beth(Rose Byrne) the new neighbor in his building.  The attraction is there for both of them, but Beth is a little thrown off by Adam's odd behavior until she finds out his has Asburgers syndrome. Then she reads up on it and tries to get to know him and love him and be sensitive to his condition at the same time.  Inevitably worlds collide when things get serious, meeting Beth's parents etc which leads Beth and Adam to make a decision...stay or split. Well I won't give it away but it's just a great movie.The movie has many sweet, cute moments in it between the couple as they start falling in love. But the movie has its serious topics and has a certain overall sadness to it.  The ending was not what I wanted, but was still a happy ending nonetheless.If you like movies about real people, real problems, and everything that comes with it you will love Adam -check it out. Hugh Dancy who I never heard of or saw til this movie gives a great performance with someone with Aspergers syndrome and Rose Byrne proves that she is not only beautiful but a great actress as well.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","There are wonderful reviews here for this film, so I am taking my usual tack of 'fickle-pointing', and see if I can help potential buyers of this film. Firstly let me say: BUY IT.2000 was the year I was diagnosed with Asperger's Autism, and I am proud to be an expert on it and have written a book. I also have Tourette Syndrome and with those things confessed, let me proceed to the so-called 'review'....Hugh Dancy would not have been my choice for this role, Adam Raki who has Asperger's autism. Dancy, in my opinion, strains a bit to attain the American accent and yes, his speech pattern did grate on my nerves--but that is one curse of AS (as Asperger's is abbreviated). Dancy did it well, overall.The introduction of a genuine friend and potential girlfriend, teacher Beth Buchwald (a lovely Rose Byrne), is not as uncommon as one might think in an Aspie's life (what As sufferers commonly call themselves and others so afflicted). She is bright, understanding and funny--things Adam fully perceives and likes.Though it is predicatable, I love Amazon's quoted comment that this isn't an illness-of-the-week movie or anything patronizing. That was very important to me, because I'd seen something horrendously annoying along these lines, MOZART AND THE WHALE. That was a stinker of a film, and I felt patronized after that puke-stravaganza.Dancy shows a surprising, tender and skilled ability with this role. He is someone you'd like to cradle and care for, though he wouldn't really like the cradling part too much. Particularly amazing were a few scenes in which Adam shows just how much like Einstein he really is...and it is that more than anything that hooked me on this excellent film.Everyone should see and understand this film: it might help you understand other characters such as Dr. Bob Kearns inFlash of Genius, and Dr. Jack Kevorkian inYou Don't Know Jack. I think this will also help makeTemple Grandinmore palatable for those who can't quite get it. Please read my reviews for all the aforementioned films.Some solid, though 2nd-string, talent bolsters this film with the likes of Peter Gallagher as Beth's father, Amy Irving as Beth's mother, and the hilarious yet respectable Frankie Faison as Harlan, Adam's workplace pal.

Because Asperger's is also called high-functioning autism, most people don't realize that someone with the syndrome is struggling in a world that is hard for him to understand.  I have a teenage son with Asperger's and I think Hugh Dancy played his part excellently without going overboard.  Even the bewildered and faraway look he had is typical of the syndrome. Most people just look at someone with Asperger's and just think they're weird but as hard as the world is for regular folk, they have it even harder so I think this movie will help a lot of people understand better.I also recently saw Mozart and the Whale, which is also about Asperger's but although Josh Harnett's acting was superb, Adam is a much better plot line.  It didn't have the standard happy ending, which is probably what most sufferers of Asperger's will have to go through until they find the right person who will love them for who they are.

1316214,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0030Y12FU,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","ADAM is one of those movies you hope that the filmmaking industry will continue to make - films that are not reliant on big budget and special effects to succeed, but instead films with stories that are meaningful and enrich the lives of the viewers, Max Mayer wrote and directed this very fine film that deals with an extraordinary 29 year gifted man who happens to also have Asperger's Syndrome - a form of autism that the straightforward dialogue of the script defines beautifully without depending on a voice over explanation.Adam Raki (a brilliant performance by Hugh Dancy) has been living an ordered life with his father: as the film opens Adam is at his father's graveside following his funeral. Adam is a genius completely consumed with knowledge of outer space and space technology. He works for a toy factory designing chips to animate toys. His best friend is Harlan (Frankie Faison), an old war buddy of his deceased father, who understands Adam's mental dilemma and is ever present to help him adjust and feel 'normal'. Adam lives in the apartment/condo in New York that he had shared with his father. A new tenant moves in above Adam, one Beth Buchwald (Rose Byrne) who teaches school and is recovering from a broken relationship. Very gradually Adam and Rose connect (the development of this love relationship is one of the most sensitive and uniquely satisfying on film) and Rose learns to appreciate Adam's worth and begins to see a relationship developing despite the warnings of her parents (Peter Gallagher and Amy Irving). But when Rose's father is exposed in a scandal and must face prison, Rose's need for stability and for caring for her mother supersedes her need for Adam. Adam loses his job and is offered work in California, work that directly involves space exploration topics! These changes in the focus of life alter the flow of the love relationship between Adam and Beth and they make their choices. Both Adam and Beth learn to view the world differently than before they met and that is enough.Hugh Dancy has obviously studied people with Asperger's Syndrome, but the manner in which he convincingly plays this role is not one of mimicking or parody: Adam is a thoroughly realized, complex, enormously gentle, lovable being. This is a performance so rich in subtleties that it begs for recognition as an Oscar contender. The entire cast is excellent, no doubt in large part due to the sensitive direction by Max Mayer. The cinematography and the music score are standouts, helping to make this one of the truly fine films of the past year.

1316219,AAX9ZIMIYJ77W,B0030Y12FU,Lei,"[4, 4]","I wouldn't call this film a comedy. It's more of a drama. A schoolteacher named Beth moves into her new apartment and meets her new neighbor, Adam. Adam is a 29 year old engineer who loves astronomy. In my opinion, Rose Byrne wasn't fitting for the character of Beth. She seemed rather oblivious to Adam's character. I'm sorry, I know Adam has a deficiency in expressing his feelings for Beth, but I never saw the slightest bit of chemistry between the two characters. Just nothing. Hugh Dancy did a great job in comprehending people with asperger's syndrome, although some scenes felt forced. There were a lot of aspects of asperger's syndrome presented in the film. One can see that an aspie can be dominating in everyday conversation. Emotions are invisible to them. It is difficult for them to create and maintain relationships with other people. Adam was alone after his father died, but he never expressed grief. He remained at work or at home. It's not healthy for human beings to be alone. I'm glad Adam sought employment as a tour guide at the planetarium, despite his social impediments. Still, I feel unsatisfied with the ending. What was the message of the film? Aspies are difficult to live with and difficult to love? Beth finds herself incapable of moving in with Adam because of her father's situation in court. I understand that relationships rely on emotional support and empathy, but Beth didn't show much support for Adam either. There really wasn't anything about her father's situation that could be helped. Beth treated Adam like he was inept. She lied to him. She should have known that a person with asperger's is inclined to routine activity, efficiency, and truth. She just didn't take the relationship seriously. Just as Beth's mother accepted her father (Gallagher) wholeheartedly to love, Beth should have accepted Adam for who he was. I guess that is up to the audience to pass judgment on. I think the unlit fireplace scene was too long. In fact I think a lot of scenes were a few seconds too long. I know they are trying to capture the awkwardness of the characters, but lengthening all of them isn't necessary.

1316222,A2H2AJY184XDS3,B0030Y12FU,Mike Williams,"[5, 5]","Like Adam, I have Asperger's, and I want to review this film from that basis. It is essentially a romantic comedy: Adam, who having lost his father, lies alone with the typical regimented lifestyle of someone with Asperger's. This is thrown into disarray with the arrival of Beth, his upstairs neighbour, to whom he feels attraction and wants to get to know better. The awkwardness of their interactions (and Adam's painful emergence into the world of restaurants, theatres, and parties) is gentle, amusing, and extremely realistic. Whilst everyone with Asperger's is an individual, I recognised Adam's behaviours and attitudes from my own. The indictment of Beth's father on charges of dishonesty make her rethink the qualities of honesty and integrity that Asperger's brings to Adam and strengthens their bond. However, when things get difficult for Beth, she turns on Adam and his Asperger behaviour and curses both him and his condition. For me, this was painful as people with Asperger's are governed by the condition - Asperger's is not something that can be switched on and off as events determine. What might, on occasions, seem sweet or cute can, at other times, seem disrespectful and unfeeling. Whilst I found the mirror held to my condition painful, the film was very honest in this regard. (For the record, I saw the situation from Adam's viewpoint - which I think might differ from others watching the film without Asperger's?)

1316227,A35VI0H5AFHOJ5,B0030Y12FU,Sharon Isch,"[16, 17]","The ability to empathize--or ""walk in someone else's shoes,"" can be particularly difficult for people with Asperger's syndrome, an offshoot of autism. That may be at least partly because Aspies, as they call themselves, can't read the body language or other ""social signals"" that give the rest of us important clues about what's really going on with other people. It wouldn't occur to an Aspie to tell a white lie or dissemble;  they take themselves and all else literally.  ""Adam"" is a fictional look at the life of one such young man and how he comes to cope with and surmount this particular disorder--especially as applied to romance and career.I wanted to see this movie because I'd heard such great things about Hugh Dancy's performance in it and because in the past few years I've gotten to know, slightly, two exceptionally interesting people with Asperger's syndrome and wanted to know more about it. Luckily, before I saw it, I happened upon a rave review written by an ""Aspie"" and was able to go into the movie armed with his assurance that the filmmakers mostly got it right.So--accuracy aside--how is ""Adam"" as entertainment? Excellent, in my view.  In short order our hero, a lifetime New Yorker,  finds himself newly orphaned, attracted to a young woman who's just moved into his building, out of a job...and totally at sea about what to do about any of it.  Hugh Dancy as ""Adam"" is every bit as terrific as the press he's getting. And he gets great support from his co-stars, director and a story that not only rings true but also has a great sense of humor and (most unusual for a rom-com) doesn't telegraph its ending and,  when it gets there, opts for believability over mush.Also recommended: ""Parallel Play,"" Pulitzer Prize winner Tim Page's deeply personal account of growing up with undetected Asperger's.

Hugh Dancy doesn't overdo the physical traits -- an unusual accomplishment.  And Rose Byrne is just delightful.I'm giving the movie 4 stars because it is 95% excellent.SPOILER ALERTHowever.  Then comes that last 5%.  The ending is simply awful.  I don't mean it's not what the viewer is hoping for.  I mean it's badly written, in that it feels completely artificial and tacked on; it doesn't follow from what we've seen of the relationship up to that point, which is very real, genuine and mutual affection.  I also mean it does a terrible injustice to Aspies, who generally do NOT see their loved ones in such cold and utilitarian terms as those put into Adam's mouth by this script.  Rather, when they manage to make a connection with another human being in spite of the difficulties, they treasure that person.I appreciate that the writers/producers/director were trying not to sugarcoat or over-sentimentalize (as American movies so typically do) the difficulties of the relationship.  They didn't want to make a romantic comedy with Asperger's standing in as the comedic hurdle the romance must overcome (as the viewer knows it will, per the formula).  Good thinking.  But I think they tragically overcompensated.  They spent the movie creating a very real and mutual affection between Adam and Beth, while also showing the difficulties of getting there.  Then they tacked on an artificial ending that dynamited all that work, and turned Adam into just another unfeeling, relationship-incapable guy who's interested only in what a woman can do for him, and Beth into just another girl who gives it her all and gets her heart broken: formulaic Hollywood gets its revenge.  The ending is just as cheap as the typical rom-com ending; just with the opposite valence.The message of the movie ends up being: ""Don't get involved with an Aspie.  No matter how hard you try, no matter how wonderful and understanding you are, no matter how well things seem to be going, you're screwed. They're incapable of love.""
