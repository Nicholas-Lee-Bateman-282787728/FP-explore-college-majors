1458980,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005FLSZQU,A kids review,"[3, 7]","As with plenty of franchises before it, the Spy Kids movies may be running low on creative juice, but that doesn't mean they know when to pack it in. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, the latest entry in Robert Rodriguez's venerable kiddie adventure series, wasn't exactly greeted fondly by me, mainly because I haven't enjoyed a Spy Kids movie since Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. Jessica Alba stars as a retired spy who's lured back into action when a maniacal supervillain threatens the free world. She's joined in her mission by some newly recruited spy kids. The movie will probably appeal to the little ones, and there are moments of visual inventiveness, but for the most part adults may be less than charmed this time out. For all you Spy-hards out there, the new Blu-ray has plenty of cool extras, including an interview with Rodriguez by an intrepid kid reporter, behind-the-scenes footage, and deleted scenes.",1,Spy Kids 4: All The Time In The World,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,937,"['plenty', 'franchises', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'running', 'low', 'creative', 'juice', ""n't"", 'mean', 'know', 'when', 'pack', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'Time', 'World', '4D', 'latest', 'entry', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'venerable', 'kiddie', 'adventure', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'greeted', 'fondly', 'mainly', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movie', 'Spy', 'Kids', '2', 'Island', 'Lost', 'Dreams', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'retired', 'spy', 'who', 'lured', 'back', 'action', 'when', 'maniacal', 'supervillain', 'free', 'world', 'joined', 'mission', 'newly', 'recruited', 'spy', 'kids', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'little', 'ones', 'are', 'moments', 'visual', 'inventiveness', 'most', 'part', 'adults', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'charmed', 'time', 'out', 'Spy-hards', 'there', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'plenty', 'cool', 'extras', 'including', 'interview', 'Rodriguez', 'intrepid', 'kid', 'reporter', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

1458991,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005FLSZQU,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez may be known for his action and violent films but he's also known as family man who is dedicated to his wife and children and it led him to create a family action adventure film series known as ""Spy Kids"".  So far, three ""Spy Kids"" films have been released: ""Spy Kids"" (2001), ""Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"" (2002) and ""Spy Kids 3: Game Over"" (2003).All three films would do remarkably well in the box office and combined, have made over $460 million dollars worldwide.While the third film was supposed to be a conclusion to the ""Spy Kids"" series, with the films doing so well, why not continue it, especially for a new generation of children.  The idea of having to do another film was after Robert Rodriguez who was working on ""Machete"", saw Jessica Alba (who also stars in the film) trying to take care of her one-year-old daughter Honor Marie and saw her diaper ""exploding"" and trying to change her daughter while trying not to get anything on her.  So, the idea of ""Spy Mom"" came to mind for a new ""Spy Kids"" film.Beginning in 2001, we were introduced to two children named Carmen (played by Alexa Vega) and Juni (played by Daryl Sabara) who find out that their parents were spies for the organization OSS (Organization of Super Spies).  Through circumstances, both children find out their parents previous careers and now both are pulled into the world of being a spy and the kids take on various missions for the next three films.With ""Spy Kids: All the Time In the World"", consider this film as the passing of the torch as Carmen and Juni return to meet the new ""Spy Kids"": Rebecca (played by Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (played by Mason Cook) Wilson. And like the previous films, ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D"" did very well in the box office, making $70 million in the U.S.Now ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" will be released  on Blu-ray and DVD on Nov. 2011.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" is pretty much a film where you know Robert Rodriguez loves to showcase a lot of CG, weaponry and cool gadgets via technology in his ""Spy Kids"" films.  With that being said, every Robert Rodriguez film we have reviewed have been awesome when it comes to picture quality, audio quality and special features.The same can be said for this fourth film.  First, I must say that if you want the best version of this film, you definitely want the Blu-ray version!  Otherwise, the DVD is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (1:78:1) and in Dolby Digital 5.1.  On DVD, picture quality is good, the picture quality is clear as one can expect on DVD but I can imagine that the special effects is possibly even more vibrant on Blu-ray.  It's important to also note that if you have a 3D enabled Blu-ray player and television, by going with the Blu-ray 3D release, because this film was made with 3D in mind, it's another reason to consider going for the 3D Blu-ray release.The Dolby Digital 5.1 sounds great on DVD as you can hear the kids' rocket flying in air, the weapons blowing up the front door... but if you want more of a punch and want an even more immersive soundscape, definitely go for the Blu-ray release!Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (8:12) Featuring a total of six deleted scenes:  Trouble at School, Sneaking Around, Testing Lab, Spy Tracker 6000, Inside Argo, and Camouflage Poncho.Robert Rodriguez Interview with Kid Reporter - (6:58) A young girl interviews Robert Rodriquez about the film.Spy Kids: Passing the Torch - (7:59) For those who grew up with ""Spy Kids"", Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara talk about working with the new kids, Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook.  But also what they will miss about being in the ""Spy Kids"" films.Rowan and Mason's Video Diary - (4:52) The new Spy Kids visit various crew members on the set.How to Make a Robotic Dog - (3:46) A sort feature on the challenges of working with a live dog and a fake dog in the film.Ricky Gervais as Argonaut - (4:20) Ricky Gervais talks about his role in the film.Spy Gadgets - (3:51) A look at the cool gadgets featured in the film.EXTRAS:""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:A fun children's film and a passing of the torch from the original Spy Kids to the new Spy Kids.""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" is a film that many children who grew up in early 2000's have remembered watching as children.  And similar to the original cast who started shooting the film when they were younger and are now adults (actress Alexa Vega is now married), it goes to show how quickly time passes by and that why ""Spy Kids"" is one of those films that probably can be made due to new technology, lasting potential as spy films, even children spy films will always have potential and similar to the 007 James Bond films, they can always be enjoyed from one generation after the other.While the film stars Jessica Alba and funnyman Joel McHale, this is all about the new kids and of course, possibly seeing the original Spy Kids, now adults, one last time.While the film wasn't loved by film critics, I watched this film with my 8-year-old son and sure, as an adult, for me...the scenes with a pregnant Marissa  (played by Jessica Alba) is quite absurd and I would have never imagined Jessica Alba and Joel McHale ever playing husband and wife in a film.But watching my son smiling while watching the film, may it be the constant fart jokes or the robotic dog farting as well, needless to say, he enjoyed the film and wanted to see it again.So, my feeling is that these popcorn action films geared for children, there is always a place for them. Whether or not the adults love the story or not, when you have a good balance of humor and action, the truth is that children, love it as indicative by looking at the box office returns.  This film has been a box office hit because children want a film with a lot of action and just to sit down and have a fun and exciting time.  And needless to say, these kids will laugh at anything that involves flatulence.The film is rated PG and as a parent, aside from a pregnant woman fighting crime while in labor is a bit of a far stretch and with Alex Vega screaming ""Holy Shi...taki Mushrooms"", I heard my son repeating those words quite a bit.  So, I had to tell him...""please do not say this anymore and definitely not at school, because it sounds like the actual bad word"".But other than that, for older children, I think they will love this film.  For those who grew up with the previous ""Spy Kids"" films and are more conscious about character development and plots, sure they may find this film a bit too childish for their taste.  But as a family film, I tend to observe my son and nephews when watching these films for children and whenever I can hear them laugh and smile throughout a film, I know they enjoyed the film and it's all that matters.For the young-at-heart, I know the grownups might not all enjoy the film but for those who do, I do recommend considering the Blu-ray release as it is more immersive and the picture quality is much more vibrant and detailed.  And also, if you own a 3D television and Blu-ray player, the 3D version of the film may be what you are looking for.Overall, while I found ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" to be an OK family film with a lot of action and laughs, it's a popcorn action film that is definitely for the children and if your kids love action and the constant fart jokes, they'll love this film!",3,"The fourth

Then we heard that the second and third installments were less impressive, so we passed on them.  However, the local theatre had showings of SpyKids 4 at $4/adult, free to children, so on a rainy weekend, we took the children (ages 2, 4, 6, 8,and 11). I only got on-line to write this because... well, it was so bad, I couldn't let anyone else waste $8 (or even rental price) on this movie.The jokes are vomit/feces based, slapstick at their mildest.  The children are sarcastic, selfish, and destructive.  They have no regard or respect for adults, show greed when given treats, and cannot follow the simplest of directions.  What an example for our children!  Not once did they ever so much as even smile at their baby sister, for the most part, they were so wrapped up in themselves that they completely ignored the baby.  The father was as self-absorbed and egotistical, so I suppose it's no surprise the offspring ended up in the same way.None of the time travel concepts in this movie held a shred of logic - I swear, I lost brain cells just sitting in the theatre suffering through it.  The villain supposedly goes back in time and each time comes back older, but every incarnation of himself that is shown is the exact same age, for example, with the exception of the 30-something villian who comes back as an elderly man.

1459007,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005FLSZQU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 19]","Director Robert Rodriguez seems determined to keep the ""Spy Kids"" franchise alive at all costs. ""Spy Kids: All The Time In The World"" is essentially a reboot as opposed to a true sequel as it launches viewers upon the adventures of a new central family. Yes, original kids Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara are on hand as grown counterparts of themselves, but it feels as if they are passing the torch to the younger generation. While this, the fourth in the series, has much of the visual inventiveness you've come to appreciate from Rodriguez, it does lack some of the easy charm of the first couple of pictures. Trading cleverness for obvious humor, though, has its drawbacks. Thankfully, on DVD, we are spared the theater's Aroma-Scope scratch cards that surely promised a plethora of unpleasant smells. (For the record, I liked it when John Waters did it, but that was a different story entirely). The movie plays to a certain demographic--if you think passing gas, vomit, and other bodily emissions are hysterical, this might be just up your alley. I always hear the argument ""but the movie is for kids"" when people are defending entertainment of this type, but the point seems rather irrelevant when you think of all the good kids' movies with genuine smarts.Jessica Alba plays Vega and Sabara's aunt. She, too, is a spy. Upon giving birth to her daughter, she decides to quit this dangerous occupation to focus on her new baby, husband (Joel McHale), and step kids (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook). However, when a nefarious mastermind starts moving time forward at an alarming rate--the fate of the very world is in jeopardy. She has had prior dealings with another criminal who holds the key to this mystery, so she is drafted back into service. This being ""Spy Kids,"" though, Blanchard and Cook are soon up to their little necks in danger as well. Will these darn kids be able to save humankind? I won't ruin the surprise. Jeremy Piven is cast as Alba's superior at the agency, and Ricky Gervais provides unusual support. Everyone is game and, as I said, certain visuals are fun to watch. But that being the case, I found most of the actual humor forced and flat. There are only so many times passing gas can effectively be used as a punchline!The movie, despite its slapstick silliness, wants to have its share of warm moments as well with the family drawing closer. I never really responded to Blanchard, though, who needed more discipline than understanding. I love Jeremy Piven, who despite having a large role, is never given any real comedy. And Gervais, to my mind, is a comic genius but his running monologue is uninspired and obvious. All the elements were here to make a good picture, I even liked the plot well enough--the screenplay just needed that extra push to make it more fun and funnier. Mostly for the kids, I can't really make this much of a recommendation. It's easy enough to watch (since I didn't have to smell it), I just wanted to laugh along.3-D: For those with 3-D technology, the film comes across well in that regard. The fanciful scenes have a real depth with the extra dimension, but there aren't really out-of-screen shots to take it to the next level. Neither the best or worst the technology has to offer, this doesn't elevate the movie to a different level of quality. Overall, about 2 1/2 stars but I'll round up for the kiddies.

I think Antonio Banderas and Alexa Vega lifted these films a bit in the past, and without them, it is feeling tired. In this one, a new generation of parents and kids are introduced, and they do OK, but lack the charisma of the original. The tone of the movie is different too - much more focus on humor, and a fair amount of slapstick. The highlight for me was Ricky Gervais voicing a robotic dog - he gets some of the best lines of the film, although my kids didn't quite get him. Jeremy Piven has some good moments as a two-faced agent/villain, but he also overplays it at times. Jessica Alba and Danny Trejo are fine, but don't compare to Banderas and Vega.The plot is so-so, although I did appreciate the stepmother/blended family theme, as I do think that is relevant to many modern families. I also appreciated that even though this is an action movie, it is more focused on humor than violence.

1459014,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005FLSZQU,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","If you're not a fan of the SPY KIDS movies then you should be. Sure, the movie is promoted as a made for kids film but the fact of the matter is that Robert Rodriguez series is made for not just kids but the kids in all of us. And it holds true in his latest installment SPY KIDS 4: ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.This time around we have a new set of kids since the originals have grown up. As the movie opens, Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is the top OSS spy and on a mission...even though she's due to give birth the next day. Still able to tangle with Tick Tock her able bodied enemy Marissa wins the day, retires and heads for the delivery room.A few years later we get to see her dealing with family problems now. She's married to Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale), a reality TV star whose show has him hunting for spies. In addition to the new baby she has two young step children as well. Cecil (Mason Cook) gets along with her fine but his older sister Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) resents her step mother and always makes her the butt of her pranks.Of course Marissa is called out of retirement when Tick Tock escapes and lines himself up with a new enemy, The Timekeeper. They've set out to start the Armageddon machine and take over the world. The only thing that can prevent it is a stone encased in a necklace that Marissa just gave Rebecca. Asking for it back starts a whole new problem as Rebecca gives her a prank instead of the necklace.Left home, Rebecca and Cecil find themselves under attack by Tick Tock's henchmen which initializes the home defense system Marissa installed to protect them. Soon the kids are off to a secret panic room and discover their unusual dog Argonaut is actually a robot. As the henchmen close in the kids are tossed into small rockets and whisked away towards OSS headquarters with the henchmen in pursuit. Of course they escape and make it to base.There, they're introduced to their cousin Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) of the original series now grown up and working at OSS. Carmen tells them all about their mother and heritage and the Spy Kids program, now defunct. Soon the kids find themselves involved with trying to stop The Timekeeper on their own with the help of a few gadgets they were given as gifts and the whole family winds up in the middle of saving the world before the end of the film, including their other cousin from the original 3 films, Juni (Daryl Sabara).Like the other films in the series this one isn't a movie intended to win over Oscar members. While some have panned the movie saying it displays Rodrigeuz' selling out I disagree. What it shows is his ability to entertain people who go to movies and it does so in spades. The movie does feature a number of gross out jokes for kids but that's the core audience of the film. It also offers plenty of laughs and some fantastic special effects. The fact that many are intended for 3-D doesn't hamper the movie at all.Alba and McHale do a great job as the parents here, one aware and the other not much so of the spy heritage of the family. Both Blanchard and Cook do commendable jobs as the new kids on the block having had some small shoes to fill. And it's nice to see Vega and Sabara able to return to their original roles as adults. Let's hope they can all stick it out for at least another film.This is the definition of a popcorn movie. A movie that is meant to entertain and make you laugh a little, to stretch your imagination and to just make you have fun. It does all of that. There's nothing offensive here and the movie's safe for family consumption unless you're offended by jokes about passing gas. If not then rent this one and watch it with your kids. If you don't have kids watch it anyway and remember when you were a kid and thought all of those James Bond gadgets would be cool to have. The movie offers more entertainment in 5 minutes than most do in 2 hours.

If you were like me you thought you remember reading that, Spy Kids 3D: Game Over was the last movie in the series, even with Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. This movie in part seems to be a remake of the first movie, the only remaining cast members with a lot of more screen time then other cast members are Alex Vega and Daryl Sabara. The Spy Kids are now Spy Teens, or at least very late in their teens. The Spy Kids world as competely changed I will leave that for you to discover if you have not seen the movie. As the movie begins we meet one of more new characters Marissa, (Jessica Alba) who is a secret agent for the OSS and she is on a mission finding a villian named Tick Tock. She is expecting a baby and manges to defeat Tick Tock even with going into labor. And has a baby girl named Maria, she retires for the safety of her two step children, or them finding out that she is a secret agent, doesn't this sound very familar. She is the stepmother of twins Rebecca and Cecil Wilson (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook). Rebecca also no respect for her and loves to play pranks on her, Marrissa is also married to their spy-hunting reporter Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale). And like a lot of other fathers in movies, he is wrapped up with his work and TV show that he doesn't have a lot of time for them. Of a sudden time starts to seem to run out, and Earth is being threatened by someone only known by ""the Timekeeper"" (Jeremy Piven). And now Marissa is called in for the mission, she has to bring the baby, and leaves a red-sapphire necklace (the key to the Timekeeper's plan) with Rebecca, but his thugs manges to get into the house, and they have to go to the safe room, where they see a video where she reveles to them that she is a secret agent. They of course don't believe it, their dog named Argonaut talks to them., and revels that he is a robot dog, they mange to escape and head to the OSS. Marrissa finds out that have left and is there and she calls in her niece Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) is there to welcome them, and takes them on a tour of the OSS.

1459036,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005FLSZQU,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 11]","Nearly ten years have passed since the original ""Spy Kids"" hit the screen in 2001. After two sequels, one so-so and the other pretty bad, the fourth installment of Robert Rodriguez's family picture series arrives.In ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World,"" a retired spy Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba), now a mother of one daughter and two step-children, is called back into action once again, when the world is threatened by a mysterious villain ""The Timekeeper."" Her husband Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale) and two step-kids Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) know nothing about Marissa's true identity until they too get involved in a fight against the evil organization.With so many familiar story elements, ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" almost makes us feel like watching the original, but with less imagination. All the freshness is gone out of the franchise. The story doesn't make much sense (and honestly I couldn't understand why or how the entire world is in danger). Cheesy special effects are acceptable (in fact, welcome) if gadgets are fun. No such luck, as they are only recycled ideas from the past ""Spy Kids"" movies. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino might have saved the unoriginal plot development. No such luck, either. It's nice to meet Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara again as grown-up Carmen and Juni Cortez, but their presence only reminds us of the original.Of course this is an opinion from an adult. But I think not many children would follow the unnecessarily complicated storyline (and its confusing wrap-up). They may find the film's toilet jokes very funny. I don't know. But when there is a better ""Spy Kids"" movie made ten years ago, what is the point of making an inferior one?",2,Weakest Entry of the Series,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,1723,"['Nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'original', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'hit', 'screen', '2001', 'two', 'sequels', 'one', 'so-so', 'other', 'pretty', 'bad', 'fourth', 'installment', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'family', 'picture', 'series', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'Time', 'World', 'retired', 'spy', 'Marissa', 'Wilson', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'now', 'mother', 'one', 'daughter', 'two', 'step-children', 'called', 'back', 'action', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'world', 'threatened', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'Timekeeper', 'husband', 'Wilbur', 'Wilson', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'two', 'step-kids', 'Rebecca', 'Rowan', 'Blanchard', 'Cecil', 'Mason', 'Cook', 'know', 'nothing', 'Marissa', 'true', 'identity', 'too', 'get', 'involved', 'fight', 'evil', 'organization.With', 'so', 'many', 'familiar', 'story', 'elements', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'Time', 'World', 'almost', 'feel', 'watching', 'original', 'less', 'imagination', 'freshness', 'gone', 'franchise', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'how', 'entire', 'world', 'danger', 'Cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'acceptable', 'fact', 'welcome', 'gadgets', 'are', 'fun', 'such', 'luck', 'are', 'only', 'recycled', 'ideas', 'past', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movies', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'might', 'have', 'saved', 'unoriginal', 'plot', 'development', 'such', 'luck', 'either', 'nice', 'meet', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'Daryl', 'Sabara', 'again', 'grown-up', 'Carmen', 'Juni', 'Cortez', 'presence', 'only', 'original.Of', 'course', 'opinion', 'adult', 'think', 'not', 'many', 'children', 'would', 'follow', 'unnecessarily', 'complicated', 'storyline', 'confusing', 'wrap-up', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'toilet', 'jokes', 'very', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'better', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movie', 'made', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'point', 'making', 'inferior', 'one']",N/A
