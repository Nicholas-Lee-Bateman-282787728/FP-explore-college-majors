1171901,AEBW7EDN6FZH3,B001BEK8B0,"D. Walczak ""88 Fingers""","[3, 3]","Friends,As an accomplished professional pianist, and one who owns the top 100 or so concert blu-rays that are for sale on Amazon's website, I can say, unequivocally, that if this DVD will not put you in a ""happy place"" there is utterly nothing that will.  I run a top of the line home theater in my basement, and the sound and picture of this remarkable concert are second to none.  Barry's many years of paying his dues in lesser paying gigs have brought him to this point - an utterly honed, ice-in-the-veins, polished performer.  His vocal chops, piano technique, stories, engagement with the audience and his orchestra, deliver a second to none performance worthy of being on EVERY musician's DVD-shelf in addition to the non-musician music lover.  The crisp visuals of Barry's expressions, the falsetto of the voice, the unbridled happiness and positivity of all of these tunes provide a performance that you will watch over, and over, and over - by yourself, with tears in your eyes, and with friends - with tears in all of our eyes.  The Sinatra section is dazzling, with a particularly touching performance of ""When October Goes"" - Barry's music set to the incredible lyrics of Johnny Mercer.  If that tune does not bring nostalgic tears to your eyes, I don't know what will.  Hits like ""Even Now"" make one think back on every relationship that one has had in younger years - whether the relationship had painful points or not.  The audience reveres in his wonderful story telling - from the buzzing electricity of Manhatten to his grandfather trying to coax a song out of him at a 25-cent recording-jukebox in Brooklyn, with Barry balking and crying about doing it.  They actually play the recording of this nostalgia, with his Brooklyn-thick-accented grandfather trying to get Barry to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to his cousin when Barry is a wee-lad.  You can see a picture of this event in his wonderful biography:  ""Sweet Life.""  ""Can't Smile Without You"" - one of his standards, is infinitely touching and heartfelt, with a sincere lady-fan (Michelle) from Arkansas, being the lucky one helping him, tearfully, through the duet.  Mr. Manilow is the definition of showmanship - happy, positive, a million hits, and one who truly can engage his audience.",5,Manilow Shines,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2261,"['Friends', 'accomplished', 'professional', 'pianist', 'one', 'who', 'top', '100', 'so', 'concert', 'blu-rays', 'are', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'website', 'can', 'say', 'unequivocally', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'put', 'happy', 'place', 'utterly', 'nothing', 'will', 'run', 'top', 'line', 'home', 'theater', 'basement', 'sound', 'picture', 'remarkable', 'concert', 'are', 'second', 'none', 'Barry', 'many', 'years', 'paying', 'dues', 'lesser', 'paying', 'gigs', 'have', 'brought', 'point', 'utterly', 'honed', 'ice-in-the-veins', 'polished', 'performer', 'vocal', 'chops', 'piano', 'technique', 'stories', 'engagement', 'audience', 'orchestra', 'deliver', 'second', 'none', 'performance', 'worthy', 'being', 'EVERY', 'musician', 'DVD-shelf', 'addition', 'non-musician', 'music', 'lover', 'crisp', 'visuals', 'Barry', 'expressions', 'falsetto', 'voice', 'unbridled', 'happiness', 'positivity', 'tunes', 'provide', 'performance', 'will', 'watch', 'tears', 'eyes', 'friends', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Sinatra', 'section', 'dazzling', 'particularly', 'touching', 'performance', 'When', 'October', 'Goes', 'Barry', 'music', 'set', 'incredible', 'lyrics', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'tune', 'not', 'bring', 'nostalgic', 'tears', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'will', 'Hits', 'Even', 'Now', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'back', 'relationship', 'one', 'had', 'younger', 'years', 'relationship', 'had', 'painful', 'points', 'not', 'audience', 'wonderful', 'story', 'telling', 'buzzing', 'electricity', 'Manhatten', 'grandfather', 'trying', 'coax', 'song', '25-cent', 'recording-jukebox', 'Brooklyn', 'Barry', 'balking', 'crying', 'doing', 'actually', 'play', 'recording', 'nostalgia', 'Brooklyn-thick-accented', 'grandfather', 'trying', 'get', 'Barry', 'sing', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'cousin', 'when', 'Barry', 'wee-lad', 'can', 'see', 'picture', 'event', 'wonderful', 'biography', 'Sweet', 'Life', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Smile', 'one', 'standards', 'infinitely', 'touching', 'heartfelt', 'sincere', 'lady-fan', 'Michelle', 'Arkansas', 'being', 'lucky', 'one', 'helping', 'tearfully', 'duet', 'Mr.', 'Manilow', 'definition', 'showmanship', 'happy', 'positive', 'million', 'hits', 'one', 'who', 'truly', 'can', 'engage', 'audience']",Barry Manilow: Manilow Live!

I loved all the songs he sang, except the 2 Frank Sinatra songs.  They're OK if & when Frank sang them, but Barry's a different kind of singer. Loved ""When October Goes and Weekend in New England, the two songs that the late Johnny Mercer's wife gave Barry M. to write music for J. Mercer's lyrics.  He wrote beautiful music to those songs.  One of my favorite Manilow songs is ""Could it be Magic and has been since I first heard it. My daughter brought it home one day and I fell in love with it. I'd never heard it played, and sang ""up"" as it was in the beginning of the show, and I had mixed feelings about that, but after I heard it a few times, I liked the up rhythm too.  I sang and played it at my little granddaughter's birthday party.  Two of the songs I really enjoyed were ""All the Time"" and New York City Rhythm.  I also loved the two songs he sang from Harmony.  I hope one day that project will be done, and his musical will be played in NY or DC.",5,Love This Album,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1112,"['love', 'album', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blue-Ray', 'whatever', 'called', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'anything', 'else', 'make', 'better', 'loved', 'songs', 'sang', '2', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'songs', ""'re"", 'OK', 'when', 'Frank', 'sang', 'Barry', 'different', 'kind', 'singer', 'Loved', 'When', 'October', 'Goes', 'Weekend', 'New', 'England', 'two', 'songs', 'late', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'wife', 'gave', 'Barry', 'M.', 'write', 'music', 'J.', 'Mercer', 'lyrics', 'wrote', 'beautiful', 'music', 'songs', 'One', 'favorite', 'Manilow', 'songs', 'Could', 'be', 'Magic', 'been', 'first', 'heard', 'daughter', 'brought', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'fell', 'love', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'played', 'sang', 'up', 'was', 'beginning', 'show', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'heard', 'few', 'times', 'liked', 'up', 'rhythm', 'too', 'sang', 'played', 'little', 'granddaughter', 'birthday', 'party', 'Two', 'songs', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'Time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Rhythm', 'also', 'loved', 'two', 'songs', 'sang', 'Harmony', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'project', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'musical', 'will', 'be', 'played', 'NY', 'DC']",Barry Manilow: Manilow Live!

This is my first Manilow video, but I was familiar with quite a few of his songs from the radio.  There's a long set list of other songs too.Mr. Manilow is so enthusiastic and more than willing to interact with the audience.  The ""duet"" or sing a long with the excited and happy lady from the audience is so touching and heart-wrenching. Her personal story is sweet and sad, at the same time.  If you are a Barry Manilow fan, you should get this Blu-ray or if you know very little about Mr. Manilow, (like me), and want an exciting concert experience, get this disc.

His music always seemed over played and overrated to me.  But I decided to give it a chance and am so glad I did.Of course the blu-ray video is outstanding, but it was the performance that got my attention.  This artist has alot of charisma, energy and way of interacting with the audience with that makes it a joy to watch.The arrangements with live orchestra make it really special.  It's not a studio sound - more casual, soothing and beautiful.

Despite of his aging, his performance is flawless and very entertaining. He knows what audience wants from a concert! He sings most his hits including Mandy, Copacabana, One voice, I write the songs, etc. I wished he'd sung Ships. The concert was well prepared and features an orchestra.
