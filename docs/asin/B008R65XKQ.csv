1574456,A3E5V5TSTAY3R9,B008R65XKQ,I'd rather be at the Beach,"[0, 0]","Uncle Buck is a classic movie in this family!  John Candy was born to play Uncle Buck with a cast of youngsters that were awesome in their roles, too.  The children's parents have to leave suddenly when the mother's father is taken very ill.  The only person they can get to watch the kids is the bachelor uncle, Uncle Buck, who is childless and known to be undependable.  They are not too happy about leaving the 3 children with him, but there is no choice.  Some great hilarious situations arise from this and I won't spoil them here.  Surprisingly, this is a multi-layered story that manages to always keep your attention.
