351030,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6303022901,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 1]","""The Joy Luck Club"" is an interesting movie. Like an assortment of dim sum, there are many flavors. It tells of four Chinese women who emigrate to the United States and the experiences of their daughters. It was produced by Oliver Stone, astoundingly, and directed by Wayne Wang at the beginning of his career. June (Ming-Na) is mourning the death of her mother,Suyuan,only to learn that she has half-sisters in China because of WWII. June now heads the Joy Luck Club,a gathering of women playing mah jong.There are several entwined stories. An-Mei Hsu's mother was a concubine,a fourth wife who committed suicide to save her children. An-Mei's daughter, Rose,is now in the midst of a painful divorce. Lindo claims that another member of her household has a ""spiritual pregnancy"" by her husband to escape a sexless arranged marriage. Ying-Ying ""Betty"" St. Clair drowns her infant son in the movie to get back at her abusive husband; however, in the novel, it was an abortion. Wang's timidity in tackling the subject of abortion is a contrast to his recent Internet movie, ""Princess of Nebraska"",in which a teenaged girl from China comes to the US for an abortion and tries to keep her family in the dark. The mothers' problems come down to their daughters. Lindo is especially cruel, enjoying her daughter Waverly's tears. Lena is married to a wimpy husband who insists on equality, but is deeply unhappy.""Joy Luck Club"" has deeply human stories at its heart. It's about generational conflict, the power of family, the immigrant experience, and Chinese culture. It's beautifully done. San Francisco, the City by the Bay, becomes a convergence of East and West. There's joy and sorrow. It's bittersweet. Like a Chinese garden, it is intricate and for contemplation.",4,The Bittersweet Club,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,1764,"['Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'interesting', 'movie', 'assortment', 'dim', 'sum', 'are', 'many', 'flavors', 'four', 'Chinese', 'women', 'who', 'emigrate', 'United', 'States', 'experiences', 'daughters', 'was', 'produced', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'astoundingly', 'directed', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'beginning', 'career', 'June', 'Ming-Na', 'mourning', 'death', 'mother', 'Suyuan', 'only', 'learn', 'half-sisters', 'China', 'WWII', 'June', 'now', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'gathering', 'women', 'playing', 'mah', 'are', 'several', 'entwined', 'stories', 'An-Mei', 'Hsu', 'mother', 'was', 'concubine', 'fourth', 'wife', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'save', 'children', 'An-Mei', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'now', 'midst', 'painful', 'divorce', 'Lindo', 'member', 'household', 'spiritual', 'pregnancy', 'husband', 'escape', 'sexless', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Ying-Ying', 'Betty', 'St.', 'Clair', 'infant', 'son', 'movie', 'get', 'back', 'abusive', 'husband', 'however', 'novel', 'was', 'abortion', 'Wang', 'timidity', 'tackling', 'subject', 'abortion', 'contrast', 'recent', 'Internet', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Nebraska', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'China', 'US', 'abortion', 'tries', 'keep', 'family', 'dark', 'mothers', 'problems', 'come', 'down', 'daughters', 'Lindo', 'especially', 'cruel', 'enjoying', 'daughter', 'Waverly', 'tears', 'Lena', 'married', 'wimpy', 'husband', 'who', 'equality', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'deeply', 'human', 'stories', 'heart', 'generational', 'conflict', 'power', 'family', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'beautifully', 'done', 'San', 'Francisco', 'City', 'Bay', 'convergence', 'East', 'West', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'bittersweet', 'Chinese', 'garden', 'intricate', 'contemplation']",The Joy Luck Club VHS

She  learns what they went through not only there, but what they had to face in  adjusting to life in the U.S. And as each mother has had daughters, so we  also learn how they grew up as first-generation Americans - caught between  two wildly-different cultures, never quite fitting into either. There are  some six stories in all, with a linking subplot. You don't have to have  lived a similar life to enjoy this film, but it's not everyone's cup of  tea, being one of those movies that pulls more than once at your  heartstrings.

They call these informal social gatherings the 'Joy Luck Club', a name meant to express their parental hopes and dreams for their daughter's future.While most of their conversations through the years are based on one-upmanship, eventually their false personas fall away and the real emotional traumas and hardships of their lives float to the surface. As we learn more about the past of these four women and the lives they led in China the better we come to understand the emotional, cultural dynamics between mother and daughter and how their relationships have adversely affected the lives of their offspring.There is much sadness in this film, but there is also hope and redemption offered for a brighter future.

351042,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6303022901,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","I found this a wonderful visual movie and a great venue for Chinese-American actresses, all of whom I found fascinating to watch.With  eight stories woven into this two hour, 19 minute movie. I think it would be understandable if many first-time viewers get a little confused if you don't know the stories or the actors. It also got a little soap-opera-ish, too, but then again, this film was based on a best-selling book that was read primarily by women.On the second viewing, almost two years later, I liked it a lot more and upgraded my ""star"" rating considerably. It's still a ""chick flick"" and a feminist one. The young women are that way, the Americanized women, while their mothers, those all born in China, are quite traditional. The older ladies are a bit too strict and their daughters are a bit too liberal. That included general morals and language - a big difference between the two generations and cultures. The feminist angle I didn't like was that in almost every relationship the man is painted as the bad guy (the abuser, the non-loving type, etc.) That kind of story bias was too much.For me, the best part of the film was the cinematography. There were some beautiful scenes and great colors: bright oranges, yellows, reds and browns. Some of the young women were beautiful, too. The lady narrating in the beginning, ""June"" (Melanie Chang as a nine-year-old and then Ming-Na as an adult) was very appealing and had a great voice. Her story is the one that begins and ends the film.

Three immigrant woman  from China (Tsai Chin, France Nuyen, Lisa Lu) recall the difficult journey from pre-Revolutionary China to their present comfortable San Francisco lifestyle, while their four daughters (Ming-Na Wen, Tamlyn Tomita, Rosalind Chao, Lauren Tom) remember how difficult it is to please their demanding mothers, who are still very much influenced by a culture that the daughters have never experienced.  It is the universal dilemma of the newly immigrated, this cultural disconnect between parents and children, but this film also touches upon family issues that anyone can recognize.  The complex story is made perfectly clear through a skilled screenplay (by Ronald Bass and Amy Tan, from her novel) and direction (by Wayne Wang).One dark cloud: like so many stories about ethnic women, the men are portrayed almost exclusively in an unfavorable light.

It was a suggested film for a Sociology in the Media course, and I can definitely see why it was reccomended.  It's a tearjerker and was beautifully adapted for the screen.  Director Wayne Wang brings the harrowing stories of eight Chinese and Chinese-American women, spanning two generations, together as an epic tale of the turbulence and pain of immigration and assimilation.  The cast includes the wonderful Ming Na (as one of the daughters).This story really takes an honest look at the struggle and sacrifice that immigrants must make, in the face of all odds, to survive and adapt to a new culture, language and set of social expectations.  All the while, in the case of these strong women, they hold strong to their culture through weekly games of mah jong, where they gather together to gossip, give advice and commiserate.  This is a great film, and has been called a ""chic flick,"" but I really don't believe that that stereotypical term is fitting of THE JOY LUCK CLUB at all.  It is truly a film for all people.

Once the stories from the past are told and understood within the context of ancient Chinese culture and values, the mother-daughter bonds of love become even stronger and indestructable.The stories of the four mothers are told from the cultural viewpoint of the past as flashbacks throughout the film. The viewer learns boys are more revered than girls, a daughter is given in an arranged marriage to a boy from a wealthy family and she is expected to be obedient to her husband and servile to her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law expects a grandchild and blames the daughter-in-law for failing to produce offspring, not recognizing or accepting her son's part in the problem. This particular story was cleverly resolved and had a happy ending due to the creative efforts of the daughter-in-law who used superstition, religion, and cultural values to get out of this unhappy marriage. In another life story, a young attractive daughter is raped by a wealthy businessman, her parents disown her not believing this story. They thought she allowed herself to be seduced due to his wealth. To sustain herself, she became his fourth wife, a concubine but also produced a son, an heir ...whom the first wife took ownership of, as if he were her son. The real mother was not allowed near her own child. Eventually, she proved herself a worthy daughter by a sacrificial ceremony done for her dying mother. Later she reunitd with her first child, a daughter, whom she raised within the businessman's household where the mother enacted an even more heartbreaking sacrifice ...All the stories from the past are connected in some way with the problems the Chinese daughter's are experiencing in their adult lives. Through flashbacks in time, each daughter recalls her own past and how she felt pushed to do things for her mother, trying to please her, yet feeling unworthy. The film blends the stories of all the characters in a very creative and unique manner helping the viewer understand how the context of Chinese culture became the foundation of love on which all their lives are based.June one of the American-raised Chinese daughters begins telling her story and the relationhship and conflicts with her mother who had recently passed away. The roots of the misunderstandings become more clear as the viewer learns about June's mother's life in China ... June learns the expectations her mother had for her, the hopes and dreams for her American daughter were part of an unresolved loss her mother never spoke about to June. June learns about a very painful experience in her mother's life which forced her to make decisions no mother should have to make ... However, due to a letter written by Auntie Lindo to June's relatives in China, June is reunited with her mother's secret past.

We are neither Asian nor Jewish, but it would appear that the archetypical mother figure is very similar among cultures, including my mom's which is Italian. The gathering scene at the beginning of ""Joy Luck Club,"" especially with its cacaphony of loud, multiple conversations, reminded me very much of when my mother's relatives used to get together.My point is that there is much in ""The Joy Luck Club"" with which many of us can identify, regardless of gender or culture. People are people and life can be cruel as well as wonderful.Be warned -- the goings get very tough in some of the flashback sequence. One scene in particular will never quite leave my mind, or my wife's. I won't spoil it but it involves France Nuyen's character as a young wife and mother, pushed to the edge. (Parent's note: this is a film about a family, but definitely NOT a family film and is rated ""R."") My ignorance of the other actors' work is my shortcoming, because these artists are clearly outstanding in their blend of intensity, strength and dimension.Ms. Nuyen is among the more familiar actors in the film, at least to my little world. She's been in countless films and TV shows, but I remember her best at the side of her husband, actor Robert Culp, on numerous talk shows. Ming Na Wen, the speaking voice of Mulan, plays the central young character. Christopher Rich (""Murphy Brown,"" ""The Charmings,"" ""Reba"") appears as a well-meaning but occasionally -- and painfully -- oafish suitor.The photography is brilliant and looks marvelous in Blu-ray.

351064,A1XJWXF9LDFSL0,6303022901,Hwang,"[0, 0]","Co-written by Amy Tan, The Joy Luck Club brings what constitutes one of the finest Chinese novels to the big screen, delivering to audiences a finely crafted drama full of poignant and memorable moments in the vein of modern classics.The story comprises of a vignette of four Chinese women whose parents derive from their motherland, People's Republic of China, and is primarily told from the standpoint of the heroine, whose mother made the tireless journey from China to the United States because she wanted the feathers of the ugly duckling to transform into that of a swan before the eyes of appreciating people who will accept women from their true worth unlike the sexist men they faced in the People's Republic.Basically, for two of the vignettes, the story comprises of a competition beginning from childhood of two women, whose parents encouraged them - one into the pursuit of becoming the chess champion of the world, and the other into becoming the greatest piano player known to man despite the fact that she had no musical talent. One of them, remains single, while the other is married to a Caucasian who finds it difficult to find acceptance in her family, making a fool of himself through his ignorance of Chinese attitudes and practices, bumbling along in his first dinner with her family prior to their marriage. (The supporting actress who plays this character is the most gorgeous Japanese woman you will ever lay eyes on and the most exquisite woman on earth)The other two vignettes revolve around two women, one married to a Caucasian, who initially worshiped the ground upon which she tread despite the fact that she was discriminated against by his parents who considered her to be of too lowly a class to be wed to their son, and the other married to an overly materialistic Chinese man who would calculate to the last penny everything they spend together to be split equally among them as husband and wife - taking the idea of gender equality to the extreme.All of these are interspersed with flashbacks of their parent's history in the People's Republic, as they struggled against the sexism that existed throughout the world prior to the bra-burning era that spawned the feminist movement.This, then, constitutes the basic theme of the movie: women struggling against sexist attitudes, struggling for independence against overbearing husbands, against polygamous husbands who show preferential treatment for certain wives while treating other as sexual objects, struggling against ill treatment from their husbands and, in general, struggling to break free of their social constraints like an ugly duckling transforming into a beautiful swan the way women were meant to be.Without a doubt an Oliver Stone classic that will go down in history as one of the finest Chinese dramas ever made.",5,Classic Drama from the Mind of Amy Tan,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,2817,"['Co-written', 'Amy', 'Tan', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'what', 'one', 'finest', 'Chinese', 'novels', 'big', 'screen', 'delivering', 'audiences', 'finely', 'crafted', 'drama', 'full', 'poignant', 'memorable', 'moments', 'vein', 'modern', 'classics.The', 'story', 'comprises', 'vignette', 'four', 'Chinese', 'women', 'parents', 'derive', 'motherland', 'People', 'Republic', 'China', 'primarily', 'told', 'standpoint', 'heroine', 'mother', 'made', 'tireless', 'journey', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'wanted', 'feathers', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'transform', 'swan', 'eyes', 'appreciating', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'accept', 'women', 'true', 'worth', 'sexist', 'men', 'faced', 'People', 'Republic.Basically', 'two', 'vignettes', 'story', 'comprises', 'competition', 'beginning', 'childhood', 'two', 'women', 'parents', 'encouraged', 'one', 'pursuit', 'becoming', 'chess', 'champion', 'world', 'other', 'becoming', 'greatest', 'piano', 'player', 'known', 'man', 'fact', 'had', 'musical', 'talent', 'One', 'single', 'other', 'married', 'Caucasian', 'who', 'difficult', 'find', 'acceptance', 'family', 'making', 'fool', 'ignorance', 'Chinese', 'attitudes', 'practices', 'bumbling', 'along', 'first', 'dinner', 'family', 'prior', 'marriage', 'supporting', 'actress', 'who', 'character', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'will', 'ever', 'lay', 'eyes', 'most', 'exquisite', 'woman', 'earth', 'other', 'two', 'vignettes', 'revolve', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'married', 'Caucasian', 'who', 'initially', 'worshiped', 'ground', 'tread', 'fact', 'was', 'discriminated', 'parents', 'who', 'considered', 'be', 'too', 'class', 'be', 'wed', 'son', 'other', 'married', 'overly', 'materialistic', 'Chinese', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'calculate', 'last', 'penny', 'everything', 'spend', 'together', 'be', 'split', 'equally', 'husband', 'wife', 'taking', 'idea', 'gender', 'equality', 'extreme.All', 'are', 'interspersed', 'flashbacks', 'parent', 'history', 'People', 'Republic', 'struggled', 'sexism', 'existed', 'world', 'prior', 'bra-burning', 'era', 'spawned', 'feminist', 'movement.This', 'then', 'basic', 'theme', 'movie', 'women', 'struggling', 'sexist', 'attitudes', 'struggling', 'independence', 'overbearing', 'husbands', 'polygamous', 'husbands', 'who', 'show', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'certain', 'wives', 'treating', 'other', 'sexual', 'objects', 'struggling', 'ill', 'treatment', 'husbands', 'general', 'struggling', 'break', 'free', 'social', 'constraints', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'transforming', 'beautiful', 'swan', 'way', 'women', 'were', 'meant', 'be.Without', 'doubt', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'classic', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'finest', 'Chinese', 'dramas', 'ever', 'made']",The Joy Luck Club VHS

This superlative movie was based on her book of the same name.In this story (the script was written by Tan and Ronald Bass) the tension between four Chinese women, who were born in China and later came to the United States, and their Americanized daughters, is the foundation of the story, and is the theme that epitomizes Amy Tan's stories.  She has noted in an interview that such tension existed in her own life between her and her own mother.Much of the tension is due to the cultural clash.  Times in China were hard a few short decades ago, and life was harsh. Starvation and disease was rife even in later years, when I was there in the late 'forties.  When Americans today refer to poverty or hunger in this country, they have no conception of the real poverty and hunger that existed in China in the 'thirties and 'forties, or customs like the very painful historical binding of women's feet, which in effect crippled them for life, in the name of beauty, or the custom of wealthy Chinese men often having multiple wives and concubines, or the total degradation of women which existed and was totally accepted throughout the culture. Not to mention the impact of continuing warfare between warlords, the nationalists (Kuomintang) and communists, and the Japanese occupation all of which lasted for generations.This is an emotion evoking story.  It is more than simply entertainment; it is a story with which you will identify, with characters with which you will empathize.Amy Tan knows whereof she writes, and her stories are compelling and sympathy evoking.  Another Chinese woman who wrote her autobiography which touched on some of the same themes, who was in Tsingtao when I was, and whose tale enchanted me, was Dr. H. Mei Lu, who now lives in Honolulu, and whose book was titled, ""Grandfather's Microscope"" q.v.  Coming from a humble background, in China, she became an esteemed pathologist in the United States.

This is an intimate portrait of two generations of Asian women - the mothers who risked everything to create a better life for their daughters in the United States.  At this juncture in American history, the movie resonates more than ever by reminding the viewer of our fore-mother's immigrant experience.  In doing so, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; serves as a vibrant contemporary document on freedom and the pursuit of happiness.Ming-Na Wen (now known to millions as Ming-Na or Deb Chen on NBC's top rated drama &quot;ER&quot;) is superb in the central role of June, greiving for her recently deceased mother with the 3 &quot;aunties&quot; who miantain her place at the mah-jon table.  Their gatherings continue, with June's presence, and in the process form the backdrop from which these women's personal stories and life-journies are shared.  Each auntie - and their now-adult Americanized daughters - explain their often-harrowing attempt to escape Communist China and their difficult transition to an American way of life in the U.S.  Tears flow in both generations, not only for what has been lost, but also for what has been found here - a society with different values that challenges these women in unexpected but nearly universal ways.  As both generations - and all eight women eventually - share their stories, the viewer literaly steps into each life, aware of where the characters end up, yet fully experiencing the challenges each of them faces.  Set against the backdrop of June's trip to China to find her long-lost sisters (whom her mother was forced to leave behind in one of the film's most powerful sub-plots) &quot;The JOy Luck Club&quot; can be ANY family's story, regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in this country.  In doing so, it succeeds at building bridges to the past, while staunchly looking ahead to the future.  This is the sort of film that embraces real life and human themes, but also puts a face on what it means to be a zero-generation immigrant, or an exile in a land far from one's home and culture.  Like the current spate of Latin and Soviet block immigrants and the last century's explosion of new Americans from Europe and Africa, we recognize through the characters the meaning and value of freedom, family and peace as well as the unimaginable challenges our elders faced in coming to this land of opportunity.The cast of Asian-American actresses is uniformly superb, straddling a delicate balance for the viewer that requires they be both accessible AND remote at once.  Although long seen as a &quot;woman's movie&quot; the film deserves to be widely experienced by all people, including men, who might otherwise reject the film as nothing more than handkerchief fluff.  In fact, since few similar films exist with central male characters, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; stands as a film I believe many men would embrace if they give it a chance.  The film speaks for our fathers and brothers, not just our sisters, mothers or wives.  This is grand, epic storytelling with a heart, beautifully directed by Wayne Wang and amazingly accessible in every way, due to its stellar cast.  Had there been a Best Ensemble Oscar designed to honor the contribution of a group of actors at the top of their form, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; cast would have surely been honored.A magnificent film that fully captures what it means to be an American of any descent.",5,A Heartbreaking and Powerful Testament to the Human Spirit,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,3741,"['quot', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'quot', 'ground-breaking', 'film', 'universal', 'themes', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'regardless', 'age', 'gender', 'nationality', 'Truly', 'scope', 'haunting', 'vision', 'movie', 'also', 'deeply', 'heartfelt', 'familial', 'enhancing', 'ability', 'speak', 'audience', 'myriad', 'boundless', 'ways', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'two', 'generations', 'Asian', 'women', 'mothers', 'who', 'risked', 'everything', 'create', 'better', 'life', 'daughters', 'United', 'States', 'juncture', 'American', 'history', 'movie', 'more', 'ever', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'fore-mother', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'doing', 'so', 'quot', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'quot', 'vibrant', 'contemporary', 'document', 'freedom', 'pursuit', 'happiness.Ming-Na', 'Wen', 'now', 'known', 'millions', 'Ming-Na', 'Deb', 'Chen', 'NBC', 'top', 'rated', 'drama', 'quot', 'ER', 'quot', 'superb', 'central', 'role', 'June', 'greiving', 'recently', 'deceased', 'mother', '3', 'quot', 'aunties', 'quot', 'who', 'miantain', 'place', 'mah-jon', 'table', 'gatherings', 'continue', 'June', 'presence', 'process', 'form', 'backdrop', 'women', 'personal', 'stories', 'life-journies', 'are', 'shared', 'auntie', 'now-adult', 'Americanized', 'daughters', 'explain', 'often-harrowing', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Communist', 'China', 'difficult', 'transition', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'U.S.', 'Tears', 'flow', 'generations', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'been', 'lost', 'also', 'what', 'been', 'found', 'here', 'society', 'different', 'values', 'women', 'unexpected', 'nearly', 'universal', 'ways', 'generations', 'eight', 'women', 'eventually', 'share', 'stories', 'viewer', 'literaly', 'steps', 'life', 'aware', 'where', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'yet', 'fully', 'experiencing', 'challenges', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'June', 'trip', 'China', 'find', 'long-lost', 'sisters', 'whom', 'mother', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'behind', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'sub-plots', 'quot', 'JOy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'ANY', 'family', 'story', 'regardless', 'how', 'long', 'ancestors', 'have', 'lived', 'country', 'doing', 'so', 'building', 'bridges', 'past', 'staunchly', 'looking', 'ahead', 'future', 'sort', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'human', 'themes', 'also', 'face', 'what', 'be', 'zero-generation', 'immigrant', 'exile', 'land', 'far', 'one', 'home', 'culture', 'current', 'spate', 'Latin', 'Soviet', 'block', 'immigrants', 'last', 'century', 'explosion', 'new', 'Americans', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'recognize', 'characters', 'meaning', 'value', 'freedom', 'family', 'peace', 'as', 'well', 'unimaginable', 'challenges', 'elders', 'faced', 'coming', 'land', 'opportunity.The', 'cast', 'Asian-American', 'actresses', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'straddling', 'delicate', 'balance', 'viewer', 'be', 'accessible', 'remote', 'once', 'long', 'seen', 'quot', 'woman', 'movie', 'quot', 'film', 'be', 'widely', 'experienced', 'people', 'including', 'men', 'who', 'might', 'otherwise', 'reject', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'handkerchief', 'fluff', 'fact', 'few', 'similar', 'films', 'exist', 'central', 'male', 'characters', 'quot', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'quot', 'film', 'believe', 'many', 'men', 'would', 'embrace', 'give', 'chance', 'film', 'speaks', 'fathers', 'brothers', 'not', 'just', 'sisters', 'mothers', 'wives', 'grand', 'epic', 'storytelling', 'heart', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'amazingly', 'accessible', 'way', 'due', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Had', 'been', 'Best', 'Ensemble', 'Oscar', 'designed', 'honor', 'contribution', 'group', 'actors', 'top', 'form', 'quot', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'quot', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'surely', 'been', 'honored.A', 'magnificent', 'film', 'fully', 'what', 'be', 'American', 'descent']",The Joy Luck Club VHS

The individual stories of the 3 mothers are told in flashback.  Each woman suffered terrible loss and heart break in their homeland.  The film moves from past to present seemlessly.  The stories of the 3 modern American daughters and their mothers unfold during a huge celebration party for daughter June, who is flying to China to be reunited with her long lost twin half-sisters.This movie is heart wrenching at points.  During some of the story telling I was amazed at the degree of pain and suffering another human benig can withstand and still go on living.  But the point is, they do go on living, and they pass their strength on to their daughters who are each enduring their own heartache, disappointments and struggles.This is a movie that every female should see.  My 13 year old son even watched it with me and my daughter, long before Amy Tan's book became required reading at his middle school.

When I read the book, I could visualize the characters having their flashbacks to childhood. But in the movie, it was too disjointed. I did not feel a connection to the grown up and to the flashback child. It just seemed like a jumble of too many little stories.And I have no idea why they had to weaken the two most powerful and interesting stories in the book. First, they watered down the story of the women whose husband leaves her--and gave her a child to boot. That was really the best story, of how she grows to stick up for herself, but it the movie, it was some stupid hogwash. Second, about the mother who abandons the twins in China. In the movie, they make it so that the mother just laid down and thought she was dying, and then woke up to find her twins gone. That changed the whole scenario, of why this woman was wracked with guilt for all of these years. She abandoned the babies because she couldn't carry them anymore.I don't know why this is necessary to do this in movies. Maybe if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't care--but then, if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have had a clue what was going on. Sorry, but I felt no emotion watching this.

And it is one of the most emotionally, psychologically, and also inspiring films I have seen in years.Took place at a party on the night before the main protanganist, June, was to go over to China to meet her long lost half-sisters, reluctantly abandoned by their mother (one reviewer dare to say the movie have the mother fall asleep and woke up with the children gone, that is NOT what happened), we are introduced to four elderly chinese american women and their respective daughters (of which June is one).As everyone celebrates June going over to China to meet her half sisters,  we also see each mother and daughter pair reckoned over the event, and told in flashback, what tragedies and trumphs they themselves have also face in the past....whether it is being promised at age 4 to be somebody's future bride, having your mother being somebody's &quot;fourth wife&quot;, having your husband bringing home a prostitute right in your face, or desperately trying to save your children only to have to leave them behind and hope for the best.This last story, about the woman who tries to bring her two daughters out of Japanese occupied territory to her husband only having to leave them behind: brace yourself. It is emotionally wrenching and actually brought tears to my eyes. What is even sadder is realization that such a scenario had probably happened in real life.Ultimately, watching this film made me realized how lucky I am living in America (esepcially to all you anti-men feminists out there who think you are being &quot;oppressed&quot;, you ain't seen NOTHING), and that nobody living here now, no matter what your nationality, should ever take this country for granted....and appreciate the sacrifices of our parents, grandparents and forebearers, who took that step and came here so we can have a better life.For that alone, The Joy Luck Club merits my five star rating.",5,Inspiration for all..not only for Asians.,995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,2039,"['Believe', 'not', 'got', 'copy', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'close', 'year', 'half', 'not', 'more', 'only', 'recent', 'decided', 'unwrap', 'watched', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'also', 'inspiring', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years.Took', 'place', 'party', 'night', 'main', 'protanganist', 'June', 'was', 'go', 'China', 'meet', 'long', 'lost', 'half-sisters', 'reluctantly', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'one', 'reviewer', 'dare', 'say', 'movie', 'have', 'mother', 'fall', 'asleep', 'woke', 'up', 'children', 'gone', 'NOT', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'introduced', 'four', 'elderly', 'chinese', 'american', 'women', 'respective', 'daughters', 'June', 'one', 'everyone', 'June', 'going', 'China', 'meet', 'half', 'sisters', 'also', 'see', 'mother', 'daughter', 'pair', 'reckoned', 'event', 'told', 'flashback', 'what', 'tragedies', 'trumphs', 'have', 'also', 'face', 'past', '.whether', 'being', 'promised', 'age', '4', 'be', 'somebody', 'future', 'bride', 'having', 'mother', 'being', 'somebody', 'quot', 'fourth', 'wife', 'quot', 'having', 'husband', 'bringing', 'home', 'prostitute', 'right', 'face', 'desperately', 'trying', 'save', 'children', 'only', 'have', 'leave', 'hope', 'best.This', 'last', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'bring', 'two', 'daughters', 'Japanese', 'occupied', 'territory', 'husband', 'only', 'having', 'leave', 'brace', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'actually', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'What', 'even', 'sadder', 'realization', 'scenario', 'had', 'probably', 'happened', 'real', 'life.Ultimately', 'watching', 'film', 'made', 'realized', 'how', 'lucky', 'am', 'living', 'America', 'esepcially', 'anti-men', 'feminists', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'being', 'quot', 'oppressed', 'quot', 'ai', ""n't"", 'seen', 'NOTHING', 'nobody', 'living', 'here', 'now', 'matter', 'what', 'nationality', 'should', 'ever', 'take', 'country', 'granted', '.and', 'appreciate', 'sacrifices', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'forebearers', 'who', 'took', 'step', 'came', 'here', 'can', 'have', 'better', 'life.For', 'alone', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'merits', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",The Joy Luck Club VHS

It felt like the producers threw him in to keep the Asian community from getting upset, because there was no story development about him and Lena's life and their love, but you knew EXACTLY what happened with Waverly, Rose, and their white husbands.The one character that really bugged me was Rose. Her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an Asian wife. She put her husband's needs before hers and as a result, he wanted to leave her, which she tries to stop. It is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her ""worth"". After learning her worth, she and her husband stays together. The movie is blaming HER and her culture for why her husband cheated, but blames Asian men when they do the same thing (am I the only one that sees this?).I am a black female (how odd for a black woman to be defending Asian men) and I have studied the Asia culture, so I know this movie is bias. What strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to ""The Color Purple"". At least the black men (like Mister) are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men (of any race) for their happiness as this movie does. There is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man (I am a traditionalist in that perspective), but Rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy. If you want a more balanced portrayal of Asian women and men, check out the movies from Asia.

I would not hesitate to give it ten stars out of a possible ten. The mostly Chinese American cast is absolutely superb in their performances. My favorite character is June, the daughter of Suyuan. At the beginning of the movie, her friends and family have gathered together before she is about to go to China to meet two sisters she did not realize she had until after her mother died.The movie centers around four Chinese women and their daughters. The experiences of the women in China, apparently between the two world wars, were often filled with sorrow and suffering. Their stories are told in Chinese with English subtitles. The experiences of the women in China as young girls and young women strongly influenced how each of them raised their daughters in the United States.I have only a couple quibbles with this otherwise outstanding movie. One is that the women, as young females in China during the 1930's, are occasionally unusually bold in asserting themselves with men who oppress them. While, as a feminist and a very strong believer in completely equal rights based on gender, I generally applaud most of their actions, it does not seem historically realistic given the unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship of Chinese women during that time period.""The Joy Luck"" is a great film in all respects, the peformances by the actresses, the general storyline, the cinematography and the music.

Mazza,"[2, 2]","&quot;The Joy Luck Club,&quot; directed by Wayne Wang, is an impressive multi-generational saga that spans two continents and several decades. The film looks at the lives of four Asian-American families. In particular, the film focuses on four mother-daughter pairs. This group of eight women is tied together by the friendship of the mothers, each of whom emigrated from China to the United States. The screenplay is based on the novel by Amy Tan.The film deals with many issues: death, loss, racism, communication (or the failure thereof), male/female dynamics, and economic independence. The film also addresses such mythic concepts as the United States as a &quot;melting pot,&quot; or as a land of opportunity.The film is not without its flaws. At times, it seems like a whittled-down miniseries; it's as if the screenwriters and director are simply trying to stuff too much material into a limited amount of film. And the endless parade of abusive, selfish male characters gets a little tiresome; I believe that some will view this as a &quot;male-bashing&quot; film. At times, the story seems a bit too soap opera-ish.But the film's strengths, in my opinion, outweigh its weaknesses. Wang gets many good performances from the very large cast. The production values are superb; the film has the look and feel of a true epic. The complex storytelling technique (multiple flashbacks, including flashback-within-flashback) is pretty well handled by the filmmakers. And Rachel Portman's musical score effectively complements the film as a whole.

I had expected this to be more of a gender-focussed film that would make it as interesting to a male audience as a Rambo movie would be of interest to a female audience.  I watched it recently I confess that I was very very wrong.  This is a movie of so many dimensions that it defies any categorization other than ""Great Movies"".  It tells six seperate stories and uses a trio of mother/daughter experiences and relationships to tell those stories.  From the first to the last (and everything in between) these stories are woven together to give us all an insight to life and life's experiences.  The contrast between Old World and New World are as instruction as the generational differences that we all are familiar with.  Each story tells of an individual struggle against diverse challenges.  The movie amplifies it's greatness by allowing a willing audience to share in the revelations that mother and daughter, ""aunts and nieces"", as well as ""cousins"" discover about each other.  Each person grows from the discoveries in the stories that are shared and we, the audience, are all the better for the experience.The acting is superb, the sets and costumes are outstanding, and the script and direction are first-rate.  Maybe you have heard all about this movie, seen it several times, read the book, or otherwise know that ""The Joy Luck Club"" is a modern screen classic.

I had read the book when I was in the seventh grade and had a remarkable teacher. She was Mrs. Lattimer (and yes, she was white), a Harvard graduate teaching at an impoverished neighborhood from where I used to grow up. Sometimes, I wondered why she never taught at one of the more prestige middle schools even right now. Still, it was a book that we middle school students had to read and analyze. The class was actually an advance seminar class. Even to this day, I am surprised that we middle school students got a chance to watch a rated ""R"" movie. It was a ""never"" to watch a rated ""R"" movie. The only movies that I can remember watching that were rated ""R"" were movies in my former AP english literature class-Othello (which actually contained nudity). It's funny because from what I recall, I had couple of friends from the regular classes and they have never seen a rated ""R"" movie shown in an educational setting. Perhaps being in a gifted class really did come with all the special privileges(even though I was never identified as ""gifted""; I was recommended). It just seemed that every book my classmates and I read in AP english could never resist incorporating some kind of sexual element. Indeed, the literary works were very great. And of course, sex is also shown in this movie.Besides the entertainment value of this movie as well as the complex relationships between the mothers and the daughters, it was certainly a movie about survival. Presently, as I sit in my comfortable room, I could only relate to the need to survive and live a fulfilling life, a life that is so wonderful and full of bliss. Life is about survival. The word ""survival"" will always vibrate and echoe inside my ears and in my mind. It is a word that summarizes the very essence of life. When you're child or an adolescent, it is about surviving through school. Once you graduate from high school, a new level of survival comes into play; and that is to make a living. Let's face it. Life really does center around making a living. We all need and want to live a life free from having to live a low standard of living like poverty and shortages of healthy food and crapy material possessions. Virtually everyone desires to have a career and be financially stable. In times where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, insecure feelings arise and stays in tact somewhere in our minds.

It's perhaps no surprise that she is married to a white man.

This film is no exception. However, I must say, while not surprised by the volume and intensity of the one-star reviews, I'm perplexed by much of their detail.One review sited the old adage that film should show rather than tell a story. While that may be true for some subject matter, it does not hold true for all. Additionally, narrative serves to do what action and dialogue cannot--fill the gap of the senses that sight and sound don't address. A well narrated tale is a pleasure to behold, especially when the narrator has the proper voice and emotion.Joy Luck Club has become one of my favorite films. The only reason I can't give it a full five stars is because it is emotionally painful to watch. That is to say, the emotional toll is so great I must take breaks between repeated viewings. It is much the same with City of Angels and Shindler's List.As to the issue of stereotyping Asians--especially Asian males--I can only say that from my perspective, ""this"" story addresses certain characters under certain circumstances. It paints some of them in an unfavorable light. However, I believe it would be unfair to believe the author was attempting to make a statement about all people of the group or even the bulk of the same people.We have only to look at our present culture and the instances of violence against women to realize that such men are not merely characters of fiction. They still exist in today's society and in nearly every country across the globe. A news article from just two days past (30 August 2008) reported where five women in Pakistan were stoned, shot, and then buried alive because they wanted to chose they own husbands. To deny that animals who prey on women do not exist in every culture is simply to be blind to the world as it is.That said, The Joy Luck Club was interesting, thought-provoking, well-paced, and emotionally draining.

Even though there are many stories and characters to follow, I didn't feel overwhelmed by them.Whether you are a man or a woman, you will identifiy with a least  one of the chareacters. It helps us to realize that our parents, whether intentional or not, can harm their children's emotionl development by their actions.Grown children and their parents need to watch this movie together and discuss the events and how it parallels their lives.Bring the tissue. This movie is very moving and emotionally charged.

Won't give away the story but I will say that this is a must see. The movie is from a woman's perspective. The acting is great and the story is too. The characters although played mainly by Asian actors, have no ethnicity. You will find yourself relating to at least one if not a combination of the characters. It is not a man-bashing movie by any means. It is more about the human heart, relationships and knowing yourself. By the end of the movie you will find yourself examining where you are and where you want to be. Oh, and don't forget your box of tissues. You will find yourself laughing and crying all at once.

The story of each of the women is personal and engaging.  Different lives and pasts leading to the same destination, each road is harsh and lined with perils.  The film is a nice blend of period piece and modern drama.I love the dialog (""She will know I am waiting like a tiger in the trees, now ready to leap out and cut her spirit loose."")  Visually, the film is almost too pretty.  The women are all heart-breakingly beautiful, and each setting is dream-like in it's perfection.  However, what could be a flaw is a strength, due largely to the quality of the actors.  Each of the characters is strong and individual.It is a very touching story of mothers and daughters, of hopes and fears.  One of my favorite character actors, Victor Wong, even has a small part.  A good film all around.",5,Joy Luck Club is of best quality,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,887,"['Having', 'not', 'seen', 'was', 'theater', 'forgot', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'story', 'women', 'personal', 'engaging', 'Different', 'leading', 'same', 'destination', 'road', 'harsh', 'lined', 'perils', 'film', 'nice', 'blend', 'period', 'piece', 'modern', 'drama.I', 'love', 'dialog', 'will', 'know', 'am', 'waiting', 'tiger', 'trees', 'now', 'ready', 'leap', 'out', 'cut', 'spirit', 'loose', 'Visually', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'pretty', 'women', 'are', 'heart-breakingly', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'dream-like', 'perfection', 'However', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'flaw', 'strength', 'due', 'largely', 'quality', 'actors', 'characters', 'strong', 'individual.It', 'very', 'touching', 'story', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'hopes', 'fears', 'One', 'favorite', 'character', 'actors', 'Victor', 'Wong', 'even', 'small', 'part', 'good', 'film']",The Joy Luck Club VHS
