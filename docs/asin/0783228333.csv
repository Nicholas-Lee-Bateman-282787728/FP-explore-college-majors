61016,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0783228333,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","W.C. Fields takes some getting use to. When I was much younger I enjoyed watching many of the great comedians from Fields' era. I was\am devoted to watching Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Bob Hope, and Buster Keaton. But for some reason W.C. Fields didn't interest me much. I had difficulty understanding the persona, finding the humor in his work. It should be pointed out I was only 3 or 4 years old at the time. In fact I really didn't become a fan until I was about 20. But now that I do understand his comedy, I think few people are as funny.""You're Telling Me"" was made in 1934 and directed by Erle C. Kenton, who's name means nothing to me, but maybe it does to you. By 1934 the Fields persona had been in place; the drinking, the one-liners, the disinterest with children and animals, it was all there. The films he made prior didn't take full advantage of it though. Before this film was made Fields appeared in ""International House (1933)"", ""Million Dollar Legs (1932)"", and ""Running Wild (1927)"". ""You're Telling Me"" was the first film to really center itself directly on Fields' persona. The shorts he made of course always did.In this film Fields plays Sam Bisbee, a second rate inventor, who's inventions include a device which helps drunks find the key hole much fast, a chair to capture murders, and his biggest invention, a puncture proof tire. Bisbee though is seen as a disgrace and a failure to his wife (Louise Carter) and his daughter (Joan Marsh), who plans to marry a millionair, who literally lives on the other side of the tracks (I'm not kidding). It's felt if the boy's family ever sets eyes on Bisbee everything will be called off.But Bisbee is a dreamer. He knows one of his inventions will hit big. He's placed all of his trust in his puncture proof tire and sadly when it doesn't sell, a mishaps occurs when he demonstrates it to a tire company, Fields sees suicide as his only way out. But he meets a young woman, (Adrienne Ames) who just happens to be a princess, unknown to Bisbee. The two talk and become friendly quickly as Bisbee spills his life story to her.The woman for some reason takes a strong liking to Bisbee and wants to help him and his family. So she decides to visit him one day in town. Of course everyone is surprised to find out a man like Bisbee knows a princess. And at this point Bisbee still doesn't know she is. The princess then proceeds to help Bisbee out in more ways than one.One of the most famous gags in the movie is the golf bit at the end. Now, first of all, there really wasn't any need for this bit. The writers or Fields merely threw it in because they knew it would get a laugh.Now Fields had done this bit before, many times. His 1930 comedy short ""The Golf Specialist"" is one example. Some people may feel the piece isn't funny. That Fields is simply going threw the motions. I can maybe understand their point, but I diagree. I think Fields tackles the bit with just as much energy as he did in ""The Golf Specialist"". Don't hold Fields repeating gags against him. He wasn't the only comedian to do so. Harold Lloyd once repeated his famous climb building routine from ""Safety Last"" in his talking comedy ""Feet First"". Laurel and Hardy also redid many of their gags from their silent films and adjusted them for sound. The golf bit still works and is funny. I don't think it's as funny as when he did it in 1930 though, if only because it's not as ""fresh"" to me. I knew what to expect before it happened.Still though I think fans of W.C. Fields, and fans of classic comedy will enjoy this movie and find plenty to laugh at.Bottom-line: Not Fields' best comedy it still has plenty to laugh at. Fields' reuse of his 'golf bit' many not seem as ""fresh"" to some viewers but still makes us laugh.",3,You've Been Told!,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,3782,"['W.C.', 'Fields', 'getting', 'use', 'When', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'many', 'great', 'comedians', 'Fields', 'era', 'was\\am', 'devoted', 'watching', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'reason', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'much', 'had', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'persona', 'finding', 'humor', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'only', '3', '4', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'fact', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'fan', 'was', 'about', '20', 'now', 'do', 'understand', 'comedy', 'think', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'funny', ""'re"", 'Telling', 'Me', 'was', 'made', '1934', 'directed', 'Erle', 'C.', 'Kenton', 'who', 'name', 'nothing', 'maybe', '1934', 'Fields', 'persona', 'had', 'been', 'place', 'drinking', 'one-liners', 'disinterest', 'children', 'animals', 'was', 'there', 'films', 'made', 'prior', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Fields', 'appeared', 'International', 'House', '1933', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Legs', '1932', 'Running', 'Wild', '1927', ""'re"", 'Telling', 'Me', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'center', 'directly', 'Fields', 'persona', 'shorts', 'made', 'course', 'always', 'film', 'Fields', 'Sam', 'Bisbee', 'second', 'rate', 'inventor', 'who', 'inventions', 'include', 'device', 'drunks', 'find', 'key', 'hole', 'much', 'fast', 'chair', 'capture', 'murders', 'biggest', 'invention', 'puncture', 'proof', 'tire', 'Bisbee', 'seen', 'disgrace', 'failure', 'wife', 'Louise', 'Carter', 'daughter', 'Joan', 'Marsh', 'who', 'marry', 'millionair', 'who', 'literally', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'felt', 'boy', 'family', 'ever', 'eyes', 'Bisbee', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'off.But', 'Bisbee', 'dreamer', 'one', 'inventions', 'will', 'hit', 'big', 'placed', 'trust', 'puncture', 'proof', 'tire', 'sadly', 'when', ""n't"", 'sell', 'mishaps', 'occurs', 'when', 'tire', 'company', 'Fields', 'suicide', 'only', 'way', 'young', 'woman', 'Adrienne', 'Ames', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'princess', 'unknown', 'Bisbee', 'two', 'talk', 'become', 'friendly', 'quickly', 'Bisbee', 'life', 'story', 'her.The', 'woman', 'reason', 'strong', 'liking', 'Bisbee', 'help', 'family', 'visit', 'one', 'day', 'town', 'course', 'everyone', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'Bisbee', 'princess', 'point', 'Bisbee', 'still', ""n't"", 'know', 'princess', 'then', 'help', 'Bisbee', 'out', 'more', 'ways', 'one.One', 'most', 'famous', 'gags', 'movie', 'golf', 'bit', 'end', 'Now', 'first', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'need', 'bit', 'writers', 'Fields', 'merely', 'threw', 'knew', 'would', 'get', 'laugh.Now', 'Fields', 'had', 'done', 'bit', 'many', 'times', '1930', 'comedy', 'short', 'Golf', 'Specialist', 'one', 'example', 'people', 'may', 'feel', 'piece', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Fields', 'simply', 'going', 'threw', 'motions', 'can', 'maybe', 'understand', 'point', 'diagree', 'think', 'Fields', 'bit', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'energy', 'did', 'Golf', 'Specialist', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Fields', 'repeating', 'gags', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'comedian', 'do', 'so', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'once', 'repeated', 'famous', 'climb', 'building', 'routine', 'Safety', 'Last', 'talking', 'comedy', 'Feet', 'First', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'also', 'redid', 'many', 'gags', 'silent', 'films', 'adjusted', 'sound', 'golf', 'bit', 'still', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'funny', 'when', 'did', '1930', 'only', 'not', 'fresh', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'think', 'fans', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'fans', 'classic', 'comedy', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'find', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'at.Bottom-line', 'Not', 'Fields', 'best', 'comedy', 'still', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'Fields', 'reuse', ""'golf"", 'bit', 'many', 'not', 'seem', 'fresh', 'viewers', 'still']",N/A

Then again, you'd expect that from William Claude: what might surprise you is his delicate touch when pathos and tenderness are called for. The scene on the train where a despondent Fields, playing struggling eccentric inventor Sam Bisbee, accidentally meets a travelling Princess and tries to talk her out of 'suicide' (she had no such plans...but HE did, in a moment of despair) is quite unexpectedly moving. It's not so much the scene as written that affects the viewer as it is Fields' flawless playing of it. Plot contrivance it may be, but the easy, simple grace he brings to his line readings - the small, near-imperceptible shadings of wistfulness and regret in his voice, facial expressions &amp; body language - all give testimony to this brilliant comic actor's mastery of craft, and his ability to draw water from the well of his own loneliness. Don't misunderstand; this is a side-splitting comedy. Much of the comedy is purely visual; all of it is unforgettable. But never make the error of short-counting WC Fields, or confuse him with an impressionist's caricature. Where other clowns tried their damndest to make you laugh till it hurts, Fields knew his gift was to create a character forever set-upon and assaulted by a blithe, uncaring parade determined to pass him by - a man who hurt till all you can do is laugh. You'll laugh often throughout this 65-minute model of construction and economy, but watching Fields trampled underfoot again - warily rising to his feet with no higher expectation than a brief, sweet respite before his next inevitable shellacking from the fates and furies - you might just get an idea of why they called him 'The Great Man'.

61021,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783228333,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","As the film opens, it's late at night and we see an inebriated W.C. Fields slowly making his way up the walkway to his front door; as he moves along, he staggers off the path and has an encounter with a tree limb that raises havoc with his straw hat and knocks it off, which gives Fields-- the all-time master of physical comedy-- a field upon which to ply his craft to the fullest.  He makes the simple task of refitting chapeau to pate engagingly hilarious.  And once he makes it into the house (shoes in hand, of course, but too late!-- the little woman is waiting for him), it's more of the same, beginning with an encounter with some draperies, this time.  It's classic Fields schtick, and what a great way to kick off one of his lesser known, but vibrantly funny films, ""You're Telling Me,"" directed by Erle C. Kenton.Pauline Bisbee (Joan Marsh) and Bob Murchison (Buster Crabbe) are in love, and want to be married; but there's a snag:  The Bisbee house is located on the ""wrong"" side of the tracks, and the union is meeting strong resistance from Bob's mother, Mrs. Edward Quimby Murchison (Kathleen Howard), who is ever discerning of the Murchison's place in society.  And Pauline's father, Sam (Fields), is of little help.  An inveterate dreamer, Sam is an inventor, and though he knows it's only a matter of time before the world beats a path to his door, his time, unfortunately, has not yet come, which leaves him in the quagmire of anonymity, and his family still on the wrong side of the tracks.All of that is about to change, however, because Sam has at last invented something that will assure him fortune and fame:  A 1000% puncture-proof automobile tire.  He has an appointment in the city with a tire company, and once they see his demonstration, he knows his future will be made, Pauline will be able to marry Bob, and all will be well.Alas, the demonstration goes awry, and the hapless Sam, dejected, disgraced and alone, boards a train for home.  He thinks it's the end; but on the train, he befriends a beautiful young woman, unaware that she is a foreign dignitary, the Princess Lescaboura (Adrienne Ames), currently on a goodwill tour of America.  And it turns out to be an auspicious encounter, as Sam's kindness to her is about to be repaid in a way that will change his life forever.This film is vintage W.C. Fields, featuring all of the trademark elements that make him (and his films) so endearing and enduring, even today:  The sight gags, presented in that unique Fields' way; Fields as the underdog; the innate cynicism Fields honed into a veritable art form; Fields as the hen-pecked husband (a role he played often, and perfected in ""It's A Gift,"" made this same year-- 1934-- with Kathleen Howard as his wife); the witty retorts; and, of course, the genuine humor.  In one respect, however, this film differs from most of his others, in that, as Sam, Fields displays a gentler side of his usually caustic nature.  The acerbity is present, to be sure, but toned down; and Sam, perhaps more than any character Fields ever created, is genuinely likable.As Bob Murchison, Buster Crabbe's performance leaves something to be desired, but that charismatic spark that would make him a matinee idol later in the Sci-fi serials ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Buck Rogers,"" and later in numerous ""Billy the Kid"" and ""Billy Carson"" westerns, is evident, and most importantly, he does well enough to set the stage for the antics of the film's star.In only her second film, Kathleen Howard is a delight in the role of Mrs. Murchison, who is something of a prototype for many who would come later in other films, such as Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn of Meredith Willson's ""The Music Man.""  As Bob's domineering mother, she affects an aloofness that strikes just the right chord and makes her the perfect foil for the down-to-earth Sam Bisbee.The supporting cast includes Louise Carter (Bessie Bisbee), Tammany Young (Caddy), Dell Henderson (Mayor), James B. ""Pop"" Kenton (Doc Beebe), Robert McKenzie (Charlie Bogle), Nora Cecil (Mrs. Price), George Irving (Mr. Robins) and Frederick Sullivan (Mr. Edward Quimby Murchison).  Comparatively short (at 66 minutes), ""You're Telling Me"" is nevertheless something of a minor classic and pure Fields from start to finish.  Thoroughly enjoyable and highly entertaining, It even gives the inimitable W.C. a chance to perform a bit of his famous ""golf"" routine.  A funny, and often downright hilarious film, it's a showcase for one of cinema's premiere funny men, and in the end, more than anything else, one thing is certain:  It's going to make you laugh.

61022,A10Q8NIFOVOHFV,0783228333,Robert S. Clay Jr.,"[18, 18]","&quot;You're Telling Me&quot; is amusing nonsense from one of the great film comedians.  We see Fields' screen persona begin to take shape in Sam Bisbee.  Sam is an inventor of such peculiar devices as the &quot;nose lifter-upper,&quot; the &quot;murder chair&quot; (for catching burglars), and his puncture-proof tire.  Sam also drinks.  He stumbles home at midnight, and tries to persuade his long-suffering wife that it's only 8:30.  In this opening segment, we observe Fields' comic timing and his juggler training as he fumbles with his shoes and his straw hat.  A running theme in Fields' movies is the debunking of upper crust snobbery and phony middle class morality.  His modest home includes some very pretentious draperies around the living room doorway.  Tipsy Sam finds he can't pass the draperies without becoming entangled in the cumbersome sash.  Fields stresses physical humor, sight gags, and his trademark hilarious &quot;asides.&quot;  He chronically has trouble finding his own head with his hat, and anyone unexpectedly coming at him constantly startle him.  After he fails to sell his puncture-proof tire in the big city, Sam befriends a mysterious woman on the train trip home.  This sets up an hilarious plot twist that has Sam fraternizing with polite society.  The mayor asks Sam to tee-off the first ball at the town's new golf course.  This gives Fields the ideal chance to do his classic &quot;golf game&quot; routine, complete with a dim-witted caddy.  The movie looks dated in places, but it has been restored nicely.

61023,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,0783228333,"""scotsladdie""","[6, 6]","A remake of Field's 1926 silent SO'S YOUR OLD MAN has W.C. playing Sam Bisbee, a drunk and an unsuccessful inventor who resides in the small town of Crystal Springs.  His daughter Pauline (Joan Marsh) hopes to marry Bob (Larry &quot;Buster&quot; Crabbe), the son of the well-to-do haughty Murchisons.  Mrs. Murchison is livid about her son's association with Pauline - until she finds that Mrs. Bisbee's maiden name was Warren: she's a descendant of a prominent Virginia family. Amusing comical antics ensue...The title of the picture comes from an inside line: Sam tells Marie (the lovely Adrienne Ames) &quot;We certainly put that Princess stuff over, didn't we&quot;?  To which Marie replies: &quot;You're telling me&quot;!. Field's golf sketch was first used in the ZIEGFELD FOLLIES OF 1915 on Broadway. Later, Fields reprised the routine in THE SPECIALIST an early talkie short from 193O. As a piece of genuine trivia, the character Robert McKenzie plays - Charlie Bogle - was the real-life pseudonym Field used as a screenwriter for various films",4,A LESSER-KNOWN FIELDS GEM.,1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,1052,"['remake', 'Field', '1926', 'silent', 'SO', 'YOUR', 'OLD', 'MAN', 'W.C.', 'playing', 'Sam', 'Bisbee', 'drunk', 'unsuccessful', 'inventor', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'Crystal', 'Springs', 'daughter', 'Pauline', 'Joan', 'Marsh', 'marry', 'Bob', 'Larry', 'quot', 'Buster', 'quot', 'Crabbe', 'son', 'well-to-do', 'haughty', 'Murchisons', 'Mrs.', 'Murchison', 'livid', 'son', 'association', 'Pauline', 'Mrs.', 'Bisbee', 'maiden', 'name', 'was', 'Warren', 'descendant', 'prominent', 'Virginia', 'family', 'Amusing', 'comical', 'antics', 'ensue', 'title', 'picture', 'inside', 'line', 'Sam', 'Marie', 'lovely', 'Adrienne', 'Ames', 'quot', 'certainly', 'put', 'Princess', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Marie', 'replies', 'quot', ""'re"", 'telling', 'quot', 'Field', 'golf', 'sketch', 'was', 'first', 'used', 'ZIEGFELD', 'FOLLIES', 'OF', '1915', 'Broadway', 'Later', 'Fields', 'reprised', 'routine', 'THE', 'SPECIALIST', 'early', 'talkie', 'short', '193O', 'piece', 'genuine', 'trivia', 'character', 'Robert', 'McKenzie', 'Charlie', 'Bogle', 'was', 'real-life', 'pseudonym', 'Field', 'used', 'screenwriter', 'various', 'films']",N/A

61025,A315WMPERH1S0Z,0783228333,Tee,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed this movie as I do all of Fields' films but it can't hold a candle to his best work.  The really wonderful thing about W.C. Fields' movies is that the supporting cast usually is very funny as well and gets some hilarious lines (as opposed to most of his comedy legend rivals who almost never let the secondary and bit players shine.)  Fields' plays a born loser, widely disliked in his hick smalltown, who spends his time trying to concoct inventions.  On a return train trip from an unsuccessful sales pitch in the big city, he befriends a princess mistakenly believing she is a suicidal shopgirl.  Touched by his concern, the princess decides to visit him in his small town with great fanfare, which makes him a hero to his neighbors (although Fields believes the princess is still a shopgirl pulling a ""fast one"").The supporting female cast is particularly good.  It's wonderful to see Adrienne Ames (as the princess) and Joan Marsh (Fields' daughter) on video - they were the leading ladies in scores of 1930's films but never big stars and are sadly forgotten today.  Kathleen Howard, Fields' wife in several other films, here plays the snooty queen bee from the better side of the tracks who is horrified her son is engaged to Fields' daughter.  Best of all is  Nora Cecil, an elderly character actress who played bits in several Fields' movies and scores of other 1930's movies as an old bat who sees Fields and the princess together on the train in suspicious circumstances and starts a tidal wave of smalltown gossip that Fields was messing around with some big city floozy while away.  Every person who hears the story embelishes it to their own dramatic satisfaction!  I especially loved the scene where old Miss Cecil is listening into to the latest fictional spin of the story with relish, knowing fully of course that the story has been changed from her original tale! (Shortly after this the princess arrives in town and the whole Fields' adultery legend is totally dropped from storyline as is Nora Cecil who of course would recognize the princess as ""that woman"".  It is hard to believe the townspeople would so quickly abandon such a juicy story or that busy body Nora wouldn't want to be among the hoardes who wanted a looked at this famous princess.)  The storyline is quite thin, accounting for the film's running time of barely an hour and this with Fields' doing his classic ""golf routine"" that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot.",3,Good But Not Great Fields,1054944000,"06 7, 2003",2003,2476,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', 'Fields', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'best', 'work', 'really', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'movies', 'supporting', 'cast', 'usually', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'opposed', 'most', 'comedy', 'legend', 'rivals', 'who', 'almost', 'never', 'let', 'secondary', 'bit', 'players', 'shine', 'Fields', 'plays', 'born', 'loser', 'widely', 'disliked', 'hick', 'smalltown', 'who', 'time', 'trying', 'concoct', 'inventions', 'return', 'train', 'trip', 'unsuccessful', 'sales', 'pitch', 'big', 'city', 'princess', 'mistakenly', 'believing', 'suicidal', 'shopgirl', 'Touched', 'concern', 'princess', 'visit', 'small', 'town', 'great', 'fanfare', 'hero', 'neighbors', 'Fields', 'princess', 'still', 'shopgirl', 'pulling', 'fast', 'one', '.The', 'supporting', 'female', 'cast', 'particularly', 'good', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Adrienne', 'Ames', 'princess', 'Joan', 'Marsh', 'Fields', 'daughter', 'video', 'were', 'leading', 'ladies', 'scores', '1930', 'films', 'never', 'big', 'stars', 'are', 'sadly', 'forgotten', 'today', 'Kathleen', 'Howard', 'Fields', 'wife', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'here', 'snooty', 'queen', 'bee', 'better', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'horrified', 'son', 'engaged', 'Fields', 'daughter', 'Best', 'Nora', 'Cecil', 'elderly', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'bits', 'several', 'Fields', 'movies', 'scores', 'other', '1930', 'movies', 'old', 'bat', 'who', 'Fields', 'princess', 'together', 'train', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'tidal', 'wave', 'smalltown', 'gossip', 'Fields', 'was', 'messing', 'around', 'big', 'city', 'floozy', 'away', 'Every', 'person', 'who', 'story', 'own', 'dramatic', 'satisfaction', 'especially', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'old', 'Miss', 'Cecil', 'listening', 'latest', 'fictional', 'spin', 'story', 'relish', 'knowing', 'fully', 'course', 'story', 'been', 'changed', 'original', 'tale', 'Shortly', 'princess', 'town', 'whole', 'Fields', 'adultery', 'legend', 'totally', 'dropped', 'storyline', 'Nora', 'Cecil', 'who', 'course', 'would', 'recognize', 'princess', 'woman', 'hard', 'believe', 'townspeople', 'would', 'so', 'quickly', 'abandon', 'such', 'juicy', 'story', 'busy', 'body', 'Nora', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'hoardes', 'who', 'wanted', 'looked', 'famous', 'princess', 'storyline', 'quite', 'thin', 'accounting', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'barely', 'hour', 'Fields', 'doing', 'classic', 'golf', 'routine', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'main', 'plot']",N/A
