Released in 1985, I guess you'd call it an espionage thriller but it's not very smart and not very thrilling. These movies have gotten so good over the years that this seems really naive.Here's the scoop. Anthony Edwards is a college student in California and the only son in a rich family. He's a nerdy virgin who plays an ongoing game of paintball assassination on campus. He heads off to Europe on Spring Break with a buddy, falls for Linda Fiorentino who plays him like a fiddle as she gets him involved in an espionage scheme. Now he's running for his life.The plot is no where near clever enough for this sort of thing. It wouldn't even float on TV in this day and age. Anthony Edwards was already 10 years into his career, and though he's likeable enough, his acting skills were not as well honed as they would become later on. Linda Fiorentino is Okay but nothing to write home about. Alex Rocco is Alex Rocco. He has his own gravity and it's no different here. But, again, the plot just isn't there and the directing is hack level. A couple of times during the flick Linda tells Anthony something that should have raised red flags all over the place and he doesn't so much as raise an eyebrow or ask a question. Dumb. And correct me if I'm wrong, but If I were a Russian spy and I lost my prey, would I follow him all the way back to the U.S. and shoot at him out in the open in broad daylight? Or would I phone ahead and have someone else do it in more discreet fashion. Dumb stuff like this happens throughout. And the music stinks as well. Bill Conti, a renown music composer, penned some really cheesy notes for this one.Unless you're a real fan of second tier 80s flicks, I'd give this a pass.",3,The Test of Time,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1800,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'original', 'release', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'product', 'time', 'Released', '1985', 'guess', ""'d"", 'call', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'not', 'very', 'smart', 'not', 'very', 'thrilling', 'movies', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'good', 'years', 'really', 'scoop', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'college', 'student', 'California', 'only', 'son', 'rich', 'family', 'nerdy', 'virgin', 'who', 'ongoing', 'game', 'paintball', 'assassination', 'campus', 'Europe', 'Spring', 'Break', 'buddy', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'who', 'fiddle', 'involved', 'espionage', 'scheme', 'Now', 'running', 'life.The', 'plot', 'where', 'near', 'clever', 'enough', 'sort', 'thing', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'float', 'TV', 'day', 'age', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'was', 'already', '10', 'years', 'career', 'likeable', 'enough', 'acting', 'skills', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'honed', 'would', 'become', 'later', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Okay', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'own', 'gravity', 'different', 'here', 'again', 'plot', 'just', ""n't"", 'directing', 'hack', 'level', 'couple', 'times', 'flick', 'Linda', 'tells', 'Anthony', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'raised', 'red', 'flags', 'place', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'ask', 'question', 'Dumb', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'were', 'Russian', 'spy', 'lost', 'prey', 'would', 'follow', 'way', 'back', 'U.S.', 'shoot', 'out', 'open', 'broad', 'daylight', 'would', 'phone', 'ahead', 'have', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'more', 'discreet', 'fashion', 'Dumb', 'stuff', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'renown', 'music', 'composer', 'penned', 'really', 'cheesy', 'notes', 'one.Unless', ""'re"", 'real', 'fan', 'second', 'tier', '80s', 'flicks', ""'d"", 'give', 'pass']",N/A

It's a clever game; except for the fact that it's highly improbable that a college campus would allow a bunch of students to run around with realistic looking pistols, firing away at one another.  Nonetheless, the environment is set up for all sorts of gun play and killing.Jonathan Moore, hereafter known as ""Dork"", travels to Europe with his friend, Manolo, after high school graduation.  He eventually meets a woman, Linda Fiorentino (who looks incredible in this movie), who is an exotic Eastern European woman named Sasha for which Dork is craving.  What follows is the classic tale: Dork has sex for the first time, Dork falls in what he thinks is love, Dork gets used, Dork gets hurt, and Dork eventually learns a harsh lesson in life.Dork's lesson starts when he follows Sasha into East Berlin.  Somehow Dork was able to rent a car even though he's never been to Germany and he doesn't have a license outside of the U.S.  Regardless of the obvious loophole, Dork and Sasha go into commie territory for her work; she's a courier and is involved in some shady dealings.  She picks up some film that gets her in trouble, and it turns out that some Russians want her.  What follows is the chase that leads Dork all over the place avoiding danger, eluding commies, and eventually returning to America.In America, Dork learns that he was part of a scam, the commies are still after him, and Sasha is really an CIA operative of some sort.  She used him, and he has to find out what all the spy games were about.

Got my wife to watch it with me, though it is not exactly a chick flick she enjoyed it. For most it requires suspending your disbelief. You have to remember it was made in a different era before many things changed. A major plot device, paint ball guns are a significant part in the beginning of this movie. Paint ball gun wars were actually happening at one time. But today you even dream of trying this and the cops will swarm around you. This was also at a time before so many campus shootings which has made everyone jumpy over any gun. The cold war was in full swing and Eastern Europe was a dangerous place to go visit. For many they will find this movie a tad too unbelievable. But for those of us old enough to really remember the times it is a simple yet quite enjoyable flick.The plot is simple enough. Slightly odd geeky rich college boy involved in a paint ball gun war and desperately seeking to get laid goes on a spring break trip with his college roommate (a womanizing East LA gang member) to Europe. While his roommate is off getting women to swoon over him, he ends up looking like a dorky tourist as he sits in a coffee shop. An slightly older woman picks him up and so he finally gets laid. Then she gets him to go to with her to Eastern Germany. Being a dork and desperate for sex he does not realize that she is a spy and the danger he is placed in by her. She uses him to transport some film out of Eastern Germany. He ends up being chased around Europe by some East block spy thugs. He manages to get on a plane back home where he finds that several groups of spy characters are after something he has. Takes him a bit to realize that he has a roll of film that is not his. Once he gets his big head doing some thinking he finally turns the tables on all the spies. The finish that really resonated with the guys in the theater years ago is where he uses a tranquilizer gun to nail a stuck up college girl that has coldly and cruelly spurned every advance he has made to her.",5,Forgotten oldie but goodie,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2097,"['Saw', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Bought', 'enjoy', 'again', 'Got', 'wife', 'watch', 'not', 'exactly', 'chick', 'flick', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'have', 'remember', 'was', 'made', 'different', 'era', 'many', 'things', 'changed', 'major', 'plot', 'device', 'paint', 'ball', 'guns', 'are', 'significant', 'part', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Paint', 'ball', 'gun', 'wars', 'were', 'actually', 'happening', 'one', 'time', 'today', 'even', 'dream', 'trying', 'cops', 'will', 'swarm', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'campus', 'shootings', 'made', 'everyone', 'jumpy', 'gun', 'cold', 'war', 'was', 'full', 'swing', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'was', 'dangerous', 'place', 'go', 'visit', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'tad', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'old', 'enough', 'really', 'remember', 'times', 'simple', 'yet', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'flick.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'Slightly', 'odd', 'geeky', 'rich', 'college', 'boy', 'involved', 'paint', 'ball', 'gun', 'war', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'get', 'laid', 'spring', 'break', 'trip', 'college', 'roommate', 'womanizing', 'East', 'LA', 'gang', 'member', 'Europe', 'roommate', 'getting', 'women', 'swoon', 'up', 'looking', 'dorky', 'tourist', 'coffee', 'shop', 'slightly', 'older', 'woman', 'up', 'so', 'finally', 'laid', 'Then', 'go', 'Eastern', 'Germany', 'Being', 'dork', 'desperate', 'sex', 'not', 'realize', 'spy', 'danger', 'placed', 'transport', 'film', 'Eastern', 'Germany', 'up', 'being', 'chased', 'Europe', 'East', 'block', 'spy', 'thugs', 'get', 'plane', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'several', 'groups', 'spy', 'characters', 'are', 'something', 'Takes', 'bit', 'realize', 'roll', 'film', 'not', 'Once', 'big', 'head', 'doing', 'thinking', 'finally', 'tables', 'spies', 'finish', 'really', 'resonated', 'guys', 'theater', 'years', 'ago', 'where', 'tranquilizer', 'gun', 'nail', 'stuck', 'up', 'college', 'girl', 'coldly', 'cruelly', 'spurned', 'advance', 'made']",N/A

He was so dark and ghetto when he was supposed to be a romeo and goofy. Yeah the ghetto connections at the end helped but it was dark, not funny, like I think it was supposed to be. Wrongly cast. Ironic he even used the words ""Algerian terrorist"" in the movie in one of his lines as he has that creepy dark look even when the line calls for him to be funny.Anyway the funniest part, for me, was when Edwards' character was in the French cafe and the banter between him and the rude French waiter.
