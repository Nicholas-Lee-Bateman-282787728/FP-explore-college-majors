Its already almost a year since the last Series episode and who knows when we'll get the first episode of Series 8.And to top-off all that long wait-time - the BBC advertises the new Series Collection on Blu-Ray before the First Episode's even been aired.I understand we get 13 episodes starting sometime this year...

I do have a certain amount of trepidation this time around.  Capaldi, big fan of his work, yet it seems like Moffat is trying to stuff Doctor Who back into the box it came from (rebooting back to the old style stories, etc.).  Hope I'm wrong on that.No, this is about pre-ordering (can't pre-order streaming?  Seriously?), and pricing, who (pun intended) are they kidding.  I've seen the same strategy with Newsroom Season 2 (which is still in a holding pattern and who knows when it's even going to be released).I am a firm believer that a creator / cast should get credit and compensation for their work.On the other hand, flat out gouging those that have been faithful to this series or any other series is a serious slap in the face.Come up with a sensible price, I might buy it.  This however is not even close.There are other ways to get my Doctor Who fix, and at these prices, and based on Amazon's current track record of being able to deliver episodes somewhere even close to air date (Game of Thrones, anyone?), will make use of those channels instead.",1,"Review on price point and availability, not on content of series itself",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1143,"['Not', 'review', 'actual', 'series', 'yet', 'will', 'update', 'when', 'available', 'do', 'have', 'certain', 'amount', 'trepidation', 'time', 'around', 'Capaldi', 'big', 'fan', 'work', 'Moffat', 'trying', 'stuff', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'back', 'box', 'came', 'rebooting', 'back', 'old', 'style', 'stories', 'etc.', 'Hope', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'that.No', 'pre-ordering', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pre-order', 'streaming', 'Seriously', 'pricing', 'who', 'pun', 'intended', 'are', 'kidding', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'strategy', 'Newsroom', 'Season', '2', 'still', 'holding', 'pattern', 'who', 'when', 'even', 'going', 'be', 'released', '.I', 'am', 'firm', 'believer', 'creator', '/', 'cast', 'should', 'get', 'credit', 'compensation', 'work.On', 'other', 'hand', 'flat', 'out', 'gouging', 'have', 'been', 'faithful', 'series', 'other', 'series', 'serious', 'slap', 'face.Come', 'up', 'sensible', 'price', 'might', 'buy', 'however', 'not', 'even', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'get', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fix', 'prices', 'based', 'Amazon', 'current', 'track', 'record', 'being', 'able', 'deliver', 'episodes', 'somewhere', 'even', 'close', 'air', 'date', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'anyone', 'will', 'make', 'use', 'channels', 'instead']",N/A

1694863,ADBT2QYXGQCSJ,B00IT3KQMC,"TV-Tastic ""Shawn""","[35, 96]","*Sigh* Once again I'm forced to do a review of product that is in Pre-Order status but to make things really interesting, it's five months before a single episode airs (and before they're even done filming), so I'm going to have to wing it and go based on past experiences for the most part with a little commentary thrown into the mix to attempt to address some of the confusion.As a fanatic of the &#34;NuWho&#34; series (that would be from 2005 forward) I have a crapton of experience with the home video releases of our favorite Time Lord and although this is a certainly unique approach to home video marketing, it's not THAT surprising for a few reasons.  First, as my headline indicates, this pre-release (if not intentionally than certainly appropriately) is defying the laws of physics navigating the big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey goodness so that we can all salivate over what's to come.  I mean. c'mon... this is the Doctor we're talking about... you really expected anything less.Regardless of the not-so-subtle metaphor, this makes sense on a practical side for BBC Home Video for a couple of reasons.1.) We've been bone dry on any new regular DW since Christmas, obviously, but lets look at the bigger picture here; between the  end of series seven and the 50th Anniversary Special that was six months and then there was another month in between the Day of the Doctor and The Time of Doctor.  By the time Series Eight premieres, we will have had two episodes over the course of 17 months.  I think that it's safe to say that we're all getting a little anxious, here, and the curiosity surrounding our new Doctor is making it exponentially worse and BBC Home Video is quite aware of that... especially with us Americans who have ZERO patience with anything other than immediate gratification.  Doing the pre-release now is the equivalent of putting bread sticks on the table at the Olive Garden.  I'm so excited about this, I could puke... and that sucks because I just got these kicks.2.) An obnoxiously early pre-release is an excellent gauge for consumer demand and the importance of that cannot be overstated.  Also, not for nothing but the review process here on Amazon is an EXCELLENT tool for a distributor to be able to find out exactly what the consumer is looking for in a product and while I don't necessarily agree with the &#34;kitchen sink&#34; mentality of some of the other reviewers who, in my opinion, are expecting too much out of this release (The Day of the Doctor and The Time of the Doctor, specifically) it's great that these folks are letting their opinions be heard because guess what? I've come to find out that BBC Home Video actually listens to their consumers.I'm on the BBC's Consumer Panel which basically means that every now and then I receive emails asking me to participate in surveys about BBC programming and upcoming product releases.  In late 2012 I participated in a survey regarding (of all things) DVD boxed set releases of DW and what I would like to see.  I ahd to navigate to the end of the survey to get the aprt where they give you the &#34;Other SUggestions&#34; box to fill in and I explained in no uncertain terms that no one wants a GD DVD set of the entire series and that it needs to be released on Blu-ray even if that meant upconverting the 570 resolution of the first four seasons.  Well, to my surprise, they REMASTERED the entire series (including the audio... yay for DTS HD-MA!) for a Blu-ray only boxed set release that came out in November 2013.  Now, I'm not suggesting that I was &#34;the guy&#34; they listened to but I'm sure others provided similar input and BBC Home Video acted on it realizing that there was a true demand... which of course was a risk for them simply for the cost in the remastering process and the fact that a $300 Blu-ray set can be a tough sell, especially for fans that had already purchased individual seasons.So what's going on here is good thing for them and US as consumers.Now, I obviously can't rate the eighth series as I've never seen it, but seriously... do you think it's going to stink?  Has it ever? SO. let's just preemptively go with the notion that much like in the LEGO Movie, everything will be awesome.Time to clear up some confusion with a little bit of fact mixed in with speculation.1. Unlike how they've done it in the past, don't expect a split season release.  As noted, we're getting all 13 episodes consecutively with no break so this is it, kids.  As per the usual, however, I would expect a release date a month after episode 13 airs which is perfect for the holiday season but of course means that the 2014 Christmas Special will not be included... which is to be expected.  Those have been traditionally single disc releases available in March and eventually included in the full sets of the FOLLOWING series (in this case, the ninth). And to the person who asked, no you will not be receving the episodes as they are aired (really... that was a question?) but wouldn't it be freaking awesome if Amazon rewarded all of its pre-orderers with the episodes on Amazon Instant Video as they were aired?  That they could do (HINT, HINT Amazon/BBC Home Video)2. The Day of the Doctor (the 50th Anniversary Special) will NOT be included.  By design that was an individual release to celebrate the series as a whole more than act as a bridge to the next series.  It's also a Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray/DVD release which gives it a premium stand-alone value in and of itself. Seriously, it was meant to be seen in 3D and for crap's sake, if you're a fan, how could you have not purchased this when it first came out?  It was $15 on release day!  So, if you don't have this, it's your own fault.3. The Time of the Doctor will not be included.  Seriously, folks, why would you think it would be?  The final episode of 10's didn't show up on the Series Five set, did it?  Again, $13 on release day, why did you not get it then (only $17 now).  The best I think you can hope for is a set including the Matt Smith Specials (which, actually is a &#34;thing&#34; on Amazon Instant Video) but that's it.4. Yeah, this is pre-order was made VERY early but despite what people have said about how they'll buy it when it comes out but not now, you're not buying it now, you're only pre-ordering.  Amazon doesn't charge your form of payment until the item ships.  That goes for pre-orders or anything they sell.5. Expect a 1080p/DTS-MA HD presentation.  You may not know this, but before that magnificent boxed set came out in November, 2013, the Blu-Ray releases of DW (which includes the Tennant Specials forward) were all 1080i video transfers with DTS HD HR audio tracks.  Yes, if you don't know already, there is a huge difference (especially if you have a contemporary home theater setup).  To make matters worse, BBC Home Video was tricky about the audio tracks (which were faulty codecs and didn't play right on many brands of receivers) and labeled them a &#34;DTS HD&#34; leaving off the &#34;HR&#34; and therefore implying that it was a DTS HD-MA lossless audio track. They fixed all of this with the remastered set AND with the individual releases of The Day of the Doctor and The Time of the Doctor (despite the fact that they've mislabeled ALL of these new releases incorrectly as DTS HD).That's it for now, hope I didn't bore you.  I'll provide more details as I get them and revise my review accordingly!",5,"Set Available For Pre-Order 5 Months Before A Single Ep. Airs + The Doctor + T.A.R.D.I.S. = Wibbly, Wobbly Timey.
