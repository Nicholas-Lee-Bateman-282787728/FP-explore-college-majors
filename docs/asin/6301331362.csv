250038,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301331362,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","""Cinderella Liberty"" is another example as to why the Seventies were so great.  Filmmakers could tackle more provocative subject matter but not at the expense of character.  James Caan's turn as John Baggs, a loner Navy lifer, couldn't be anymore different than Sonny Corleone.  This is a nuanced performance of quiet understatement that holds your attention as well as the film together.  Caan was inexplicably overlooked by the Academy.  Why I don't give the film the full five star treatment is I didn't buy the central romance between Baggs and Maggie the streetwalker played by Marsha Mason, who was nominated.  Outside of a plot convenience I didn't get this relationship at all.  For that matter I didn't buy Mason as a worldweary lady of the night.  There is more chemistry between Baggs and Maggie's bi-racial son Doug played by Kirk Calloway.  There is a streetwise naturalness to Calloway's performance that you almost believe he was plucked from the mean streets.  Another debit is the god-awful warbling of Paul Williams on the soundtrack.  Williams won an Oscar for his treacly ""Evergreen"" in 1976.  Randy Newman had to wait 16 times before he won.  Go figure.  Of note is that this is one of two naval flicks released in 1973 based on Daryl Ponicsan novels, the other being ""The Last Detail"" starring Jack Nicholson and directed by Hal Ashby.

250049,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6301331362,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""Cinderella Liberty"" is a 1973 picture written for the screen by Daryl Ponicsan, adapted from his book of the same name. I dug this 40 year old picture up as I was looking for movies with James Caan in the lead, and wasn't exactly sure what to expect. This was one of the first movies Caan did after the 1972 classic ""The Godfather"", where he became a screen icon and legend as the hot tempered Sonny Corleone. Most people know Caan as that tough wiseguy character, which he reprised in many films subsequent to ""The Godfather"", such as ""The Gambler"" and ""Slither"", and more recently in the 2011 dramedy ""Henry's Crime"" as an institutionalized con who gets one last chance at freedom.This movie was an interesting choice for Caan, as in 1973 I'm sure he had his pick of roles after the legendary success of ""The Godfather."" It shows alot of range and an about face in terms of character temperment, as Caan's preformance as John Baggs Jr. tells the story of a rather ordinary sailor in the post Vietnam US Navy who is temporarily stationed at a base in Seattle, Washington. There is not much history or back story to the character of Baggs, as his origins or his service in the Navy aren't exactly clear. There are subtle clues as to his background, one being the Vietnam ribbon he wears on his uniform, and the other a statement about his father taking a belt to him when he misbehaved.Despite his belief in stern discipline, Baggs walks the line between a man with surprisingly deep empathy and a toughguy sailor who knows how to handle himself as well as women and children in a family scenario. Though this movie has alot of intimate knowledge of what being in the service means, it is essentially the story of Baggs' attempt to make an unorthodox family from the life of a prostitute who fronts as a pool hall hustler in a sailor joint in Seattle, and her 11 year old angry half black son, Doug.  In Caan's character there is a unique mix of sensitivity to civil rights era race and class tension, and the rigid discipline of an experienced career sailor in between ""cruises"". This whole movie takes place on the streets of Seattle, and like ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" several years later, it gives the viewer a solid depiction of the mix between naval annd civilian personal in a military town.Caan's portrayal of Baggs has a good mix of a hardheaded military toughness with a private civilian's desire for a family life and a stable existence, yet the lives in hich he decides to intervene would certainly be considered radical even for the era of social change in which the film was made. This fact is not lost on his superior officers, who berate him for trying to make a life with ""undesirable"" people, and perhaps not coincidently, his record is ""misplaced"" and he is not able to recieve pay.Caan is a natural leader in his most famous role, and this film lives up to ""The Godfather"" legacy.  It is also a great ensemble preformance, with Kirk Calloway as a heartfelt mixed race child of poverty who Caan is constantly working on to correct his bad behavior, perhaps the most dangerous habit being his penchant for a switchblade. Burt Young has a solid cameo as the Master at arms, Dabney Coleman (recently the Commodore in HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"") is an unsympathetic Commanding officer and Marsha Mason is Maggie, the woman of unfortunate circumstances.",4,James Caan as a sailor with a big heart,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,3369,"['Cinderella', 'Liberty', '1973', 'picture', 'written', 'screen', 'Daryl', 'Ponicsan', 'adapted', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'dug', '40', 'year', 'old', 'picture', 'up', 'was', 'looking', 'movies', 'James', 'Caan', 'lead', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'Caan', 'did', '1972', 'classic', 'Godfather', 'where', 'became', 'screen', 'icon', 'legend', 'hot', 'tempered', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'Caan', 'tough', 'wiseguy', 'character', 'reprised', 'many', 'films', 'subsequent', 'Godfather', 'such', 'Gambler', 'Slither', 'more', 'recently', '2011', 'dramedy', 'Henry', 'Crime', 'institutionalized', 'con', 'who', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'freedom.This', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'Caan', '1973', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'pick', 'roles', 'legendary', 'success', 'Godfather', 'alot', 'range', 'face', 'terms', 'character', 'temperment', 'Caan', 'preformance', 'John', 'Baggs', 'Jr.', 'story', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'sailor', 'post', 'Vietnam', 'US', 'Navy', 'who', 'temporarily', 'stationed', 'base', 'Seattle', 'Washington', 'not', 'much', 'history', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'Baggs', 'origins', 'service', 'Navy', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'clear', 'are', 'subtle', 'clues', 'background', 'one', 'being', 'Vietnam', 'ribbon', 'uniform', 'other', 'statement', 'father', 'taking', 'belt', 'when', 'misbehaved.Despite', 'belief', 'stern', 'discipline', 'Baggs', 'line', 'man', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'empathy', 'toughguy', 'sailor', 'who', 'how', 'handle', 'as', 'well', 'women', 'children', 'family', 'scenario', 'movie', 'alot', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'what', 'being', 'service', 'essentially', 'story', 'Baggs', 'attempt', 'make', 'unorthodox', 'family', 'life', 'prostitute', 'who', 'pool', 'hall', 'hustler', 'sailor', 'joint', 'Seattle', '11', 'year', 'old', 'angry', 'half', 'black', 'son', 'Doug', 'Caan', 'character', 'unique', 'mix', 'sensitivity', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'race', 'class', 'tension', 'rigid', 'discipline', 'experienced', 'career', 'sailor', 'cruises', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'streets', 'Seattle', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'viewer', 'solid', 'depiction', 'mix', 'naval', 'annd', 'civilian', 'personal', 'military', 'town.Caan', 'portrayal', 'Baggs', 'good', 'mix', 'hardheaded', 'military', 'toughness', 'private', 'civilian', 'desire', 'family', 'life', 'stable', 'existence', 'lives', 'hich', 'intervene', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'considered', 'radical', 'even', 'era', 'social', 'change', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'fact', 'not', 'lost', 'superior', 'officers', 'who', 'berate', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'undesirable', 'people', 'perhaps', 'not', 'coincidently', 'record', 'misplaced', 'not', 'able', 'recieve', 'pay.Caan', 'natural', 'leader', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'film', 'up', 'Godfather', 'legacy', 'also', 'great', 'ensemble', 'preformance', 'Kirk', 'Calloway', 'heartfelt', 'mixed', 'race', 'child', 'poverty', 'who', 'Caan', 'constantly', 'working', 'correct', 'bad', 'behavior', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dangerous', 'habit', 'being', 'penchant', 'switchblade', 'Burt', 'Young', 'solid', 'cameo', 'Master', 'arms', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'recently', 'Commodore', 'HBO', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'unsympathetic', 'Commanding', 'officer', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'Maggie', 'woman', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances']",Cinderella Liberty VHS

Spangler ""goldenrod""","[1, 2]","1) Marsh Mason (Good Bye Girl)  2) Kirk Calloway in the best first acting job (with little training) in history.  3) Burt Young, an ex-fighter, who also played the sick hit man who died while driving away (after wacking his target) in one of the Godfather movies.  James Caan and the movie's dialog is as unforgettable as that best movie of all time-The Godfather.  Watching this will show anyone the extent that the movie industry has deteriorated.  The slow cook method of making a masterpiece does not happen today.  The scenes were shot on location or modified locations. You will agree that Caan and Mason are not just perfect.  They are a glorious treat.The baby delivery scene was of a real person of poverty giving birth.  Many other break-through, (first ever filmed) events were introduced in this picture.  Even though the screen play was written from only one chapter in a book, every scene is a masterpiece.  It is a story of the hopelessness  of a past history loaded with heavy baggage. The clawing and slipping is as tragic as a Greek play, but so real and gritty.  Falling back to the sloppy comfort that is safe (but still damaging) happens all around us but is all most never filmed.
