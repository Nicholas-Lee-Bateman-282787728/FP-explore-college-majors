Mui ""Mui""","[13, 19]","I have always thought that Daniel Barenboim has all along been overrated as a pianist, since the early 1970's.True that he is a 'star' pianist; with all the associations with his former wife and all the stories; but frankly, apart from that, he has never attained maestro status in the strict sense of the word. He has crossed over to conducting this last decade, and his performance at the keyboard rightfully and logically diminished even further in terms of luster and style.These Beethoven sonatas, whatever you might call it, is in no way satisfying in that they are rather graceless and glacial all in one.Graceless in that the pianist seems not to pay heed to the sonics but just concentrates on the pyro-techniques. Nowhere could you find a more ponderous sounding set of Beethoven sonatas: just listen to the end of each phrase, each harmonic structure. May be he has a reason for this, but I find the blurring and the clamouring very much distasteful, and could under no circumstances imagine that these are the composer's wishes.One saving aspect of this set is the 'master classes' - interesting, though you doubt if it is really that instructive.",1,"Dull, boring camera work, poor sonics.",1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,1159,"['have', 'always', 'thought', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'all', 'along', 'been', 'overrated', 'pianist', 'early', ""1970's.True"", ""'star"", 'pianist', 'associations', 'former', 'wife', 'stories', 'frankly', 'apart', 'never', 'attained', 'maestro', 'status', 'strict', 'sense', 'word', 'crossed', 'conducting', 'last', 'decade', 'performance', 'keyboard', 'rightfully', 'logically', 'diminished', 'even', 'further', 'terms', 'luster', 'style.These', 'Beethoven', 'sonatas', 'might', 'call', 'way', 'satisfying', 'are', 'rather', 'graceless', 'glacial', 'one.Graceless', 'pianist', 'not', 'pay', 'heed', 'sonics', 'just', 'concentrates', 'pyro-techniques', 'Nowhere', 'could', 'find', 'more', 'ponderous', 'sounding', 'set', 'Beethoven', 'sonatas', 'just', 'listen', 'end', 'phrase', 'harmonic', 'structure', 'May', 'be', 'reason', 'find', 'blurring', 'clamouring', 'very', 'much', 'distasteful', 'could', 'circumstances', 'imagine', 'are', 'composer', 'wishes.One', 'saving', 'aspect', 'set', ""'master"", 'classes', 'interesting', 'doubt', 'really', 'instructive']",Barenboim on Beethoven - The Complete Piano Sonatas Live from Berlin
1035908,A1XKI53W1E891T,B000KWZ7VU,Amy,"[4, 4]","Beethoven was a revolutionary man living in a revolutionary time. He captured his inner voice, demons and all and the spirit of his time, and in doing so, created a body of music the likes of which no one had ever before imagined. A virtuoso at the keyboard, Beethoven used the piano as his personal musical laboratory, and the piano sonata became, more than any other genre of music, a place where he could experiment with harmony and his developing view of music as a self expressive art. Spanning the length of his compositional career, Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas provide a window into his personal musical development, and they show the concept of the piano as an instrument and the piano sonata as a genre undergoing an extraordinary evolution. The sonatas are not simply compositions for the piano, but are about the developing technology of the piano itself, an evolving instrument that Beethoven pushed to its limits and then beyond, ultimately writing music for an idealized piano that didn't come into existence until about 40 years after he died. Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas include some of his most popular works that took him about 30 years to compose gradually transforming a medium that Mozart and Haydn had already turned into a staple of Classical expression to a vehicle for personal expression that takes us to the time of 19th century Romanticism. These works were very much intended for home entertainment, and Beethoven initially continued that tradition by writing a number of works for his students to play. But as he began to be affected by deafness, playing the piano became his only tangible means of, as it were, 'hearing' music.There's no denying Beethoven's capacity for communing with the soul through his piano. The adventures in form and musical working out of ideas were all part of this need to say things in music that had never been said before. Beethoven was constantly striving for more, particularly in range and dynamic capability. As an example, he composed the ""Hammerklavier"" Sonata about seven years before he had a piano that could cope with its demands of register. He often said, ""The whole tribe of pianoforte manufacturers have been swarming around me in their anxiety to serve me and all for nothing."" Just one more example of the way Beethoven in his sonatas was always ahead of the game.  In this 6 DVD set Daniel Barenboim does an amazing job of playing all of Beethoven's sonatas and what truly baffles and impresses me the most every time I watch this set is that he plays them all by memory. This is a wonderful set and anyone interested in seeing Beethoven's sonatas performed will not be disappointed.  Truly, Beethoven's piano music is his voice, emerging from his mind, through his fingers, to our ears and hearts. And his piano sonatas are, more than any other of his amazing works, his personal testament, expressed in his own voice.",5,Daniel Barenboim plays all of Beethoven's Sonatas,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,2899,"['Beethoven', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'man', 'living', 'revolutionary', 'time', 'captured', 'inner', 'voice', 'demons', 'spirit', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'created', 'body', 'music', 'likes', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'before', 'imagined', 'virtuoso', 'keyboard', 'Beethoven', 'used', 'piano', 'personal', 'musical', 'laboratory', 'piano', 'sonata', 'became', 'more', 'other', 'genre', 'music', 'place', 'where', 'could', 'experiment', 'harmony', 'developing', 'view', 'music', 'self', 'expressive', 'art', 'Spanning', 'length', 'compositional', 'career', 'Beethoven', '32', 'piano', 'sonatas', 'provide', 'window', 'personal', 'musical', 'development', 'show', 'concept', 'piano', 'instrument', 'piano', 'sonata', 'genre', 'undergoing', 'extraordinary', 'evolution', 'sonatas', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'compositions', 'piano', 'are', 'developing', 'technology', 'piano', 'evolving', 'instrument', 'Beethoven', 'pushed', 'limits', 'then', 'ultimately', 'writing', 'music', 'idealized', 'piano', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'existence', '40', 'years', 'died', 'Beethoven', '32', 'piano', 'sonatas', 'include', 'most', 'popular', 'works', 'took', '30', 'years', 'compose', 'gradually', 'transforming', 'medium', 'Mozart', 'Haydn', 'had', 'already', 'turned', 'staple', 'Classical', 'expression', 'vehicle', 'personal', 'expression', 'time', '19th', 'century', 'Romanticism', 'works', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'intended', 'home', 'entertainment', 'Beethoven', 'initially', 'continued', 'tradition', 'writing', 'number', 'works', 'students', 'play', 'began', 'be', 'affected', 'deafness', 'playing', 'piano', 'became', 'only', 'tangible', 'means', 'were', ""'hearing"", 'denying', 'Beethoven', 'capacity', 'communing', 'soul', 'piano', 'adventures', 'form', 'musical', 'working', 'ideas', 'were', 'part', 'need', 'say', 'things', 'music', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'said', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'constantly', 'striving', 'more', 'particularly', 'range', 'dynamic', 'capability', 'example', 'composed', 'Hammerklavier', 'Sonata', 'seven', 'years', 'had', 'piano', 'could', 'cope', 'demands', 'register', 'often', 'said', 'whole', 'tribe', 'pianoforte', 'manufacturers', 'have', 'been', 'swarming', 'anxiety', 'serve', 'nothing', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'way', 'Beethoven', 'sonatas', 'was', 'always', 'ahead', 'game', '6', 'DVD', 'set', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'amazing', 'job', 'playing', 'Beethoven', 'sonatas', 'what', 'truly', 'baffles', 'impresses', 'most', 'time', 'watch', 'set', 'memory', 'wonderful', 'set', 'anyone', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Beethoven', 'sonatas', 'performed', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Truly', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'music', 'voice', 'emerging', 'mind', 'fingers', 'ears', 'hearts', 'piano', 'sonatas', 'are', 'more', 'other', 'amazing', 'works', 'personal', 'testament', 'expressed', 'own', 'voice']",Barenboim on Beethoven - The Complete Piano Sonatas Live from Berlin

But I've always known the feeling he's brought to music both as a pianist (I like his Chopin Nocturnes) as well as as a conductor (some of the Hindemith he's done is outstanding). A DVD collection of all the Beethoven sonatas by a single artist is vulnerable to all the same complaints as a cycle on CD: odds are you can think of someone you'd rather swap out on a specific sonata.But right now the pickings are slim, and Barenboim is ""first to market."" That having been said, I can't really complain about the set. It IS, after all, a set. By far and away it has more ups than downs, and its downs aren't that extreme. He plays with a wide range of dynamics, brings the skill, and understands the pieces.There are complaints in the reviews about the visual choices; I hear them, but I don't think this set is for people yearning to learn all the fingering. You get a fine mix of hand work and facial expressions. You see the technique, and you get plenty of shots of right hands crossing over the left and vice versa.Yes, people complain about the close ups of beads of sweat, instead of hands. But let's get serious: this is a DVD! It's *supposed* to provide a variety of visual experiences!My only complaint -- and this is the reason for my only giving it four stars -- is that the master classes are bundled in. Some of us aren't interested in that. And if we were, I would prefer to have them include a coupon to buy them, or some flyer announcing their availability.

1035911,A2AJ57CG4T153E,B000KWZ7VU,JohnB,"[0, 0]","I personally believe this series of concert recordings should have been rated a 4.5, but since the rating system only allows 5 choices, I chose a &#34;4&#34;, which is explained in my closing comments.I enjoyed watching and listening to these DVDs - a total of 6 separate discs, plus Barenboim's personal written analyses of each of the 32 sonatas.  This is a lot of Beethoven to work one's way through and I took a bit over a week to do it and will likely need to repeat that several times to properly appreciate what this set of amazing DVDs represents.  Overall, the performances are terrific, particularly considering the fact Barenboim appeared to have performed them in a short time frame.  4 of the DVDs contain the actual concerts - 8 separate concerts of 3 to 5 sonatas each before a live audience.  Barenboim's playing was impressive for its somewhat romantic interpretations and technical brilliance, but in some of the more &#34;bombastic&#34; pieces, I felt the microphones were not placed as well as they could have been - there were times when the piano sounded like the microphones were a bit too close and large fortissimos came across with too much of a &#34;crashing&#34; sound.  I lowered the base output on my system, and it was still a bit of a problem - not enough to take away from the enjoyment of Barenboim's playing, which is borderline amazing, but the &#34;crashing&#34; sound did occasionally distract.  The acoustics of the hall were captured quite well with the exception noted above.The remaining 2 discs are of Barenboim conducting master classes with a 6 notable pianists: Shai Wonser, Alessio Bax, Jonathan Biss, David Kadouch, Saleem Abboud and Lang Lang.  In each case, the individual pianists played portions from 6 sonatas Barenboim performed as part of the 8 concerts, followed by critiques and discussions with the master class &#34;students&#34;.  I enjoyed hearing how these accomplished pianists approached the pieces they played and how they differed from Barenboim's interpretations.  And it was interesting to witness 6 well-regarded pianists adjusting their approaches to the pieces selected based on Barenboim's recommendations, etc.I was a music major in college (clarinet, not piano), and had to learn to play piano well enough to work my way through a number of these sonatas in classes where we analyzed these amazing works - actually they were a major part of all music majors' training.  They are monumental, not only for the incredible skill they demand from the pianist, but also because they represent the bench mark of music written for solo piano by one of the greatest musical geniuses in music history - Beethoven's writing for piano changed the way subsequent composers looked at the instrument's range and overall possibilities, if not the way they wrote for any combination of musical instruments.  I couldn't begin to work my way through all 32 sonatas (then or now), and was found myself more than a little dazzled to witness Barenboim perform all 32 sonatas over the course of 8 separate concerts in what appeared in a short period of time completely from memory and with no indication he wasn't completely prepared - plus his playing was routinely brilliant, considering these performances were not something produced in a recording studio.This set of DVDs a terrific addition to any serious music lover's collection.  The picture and sound quality are both excellent with the sound capturing the apparently wonderful acoustics of the rather intimate hall very well - which could be part of the minor complaint I had about microphone placement; and that small complaint is not going to stop me from enjoying this set of live concert recordings for years to come.  I am delighted to have these wonderful discs as a permanent part of my growing collection of concert DVDs/BlueRays; and I believe this is the only collection available in a video format, which makes it that much more noteworthy.  If it weren't for the occasional &#34;crashing&#34; sounds in a few loud passages I believe were likely due to the close placement of the microphones, I would have had no issues with rating this collection with 5 stars.",4,Major undertaking by Barenboim,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,4183,"['personally', 'believe', 'series', 'concert', 'recordings', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rated', '4.5', 'rating', 'system', 'only', '5', 'choices', 'chose', '34', '4', '34', 'explained', 'closing', 'comments.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'listening', 'DVDs', 'total', '6', 'separate', 'discs', 'Barenboim', 'personal', 'written', 'analyses', '32', 'sonatas', 'lot', 'Beethoven', 'work', 'one', 'way', 'took', 'bit', 'week', 'do', 'will', 'likely', 'need', 'repeat', 'several', 'times', 'properly', 'appreciate', 'what', 'set', 'amazing', 'DVDs', 'Overall', 'performances', 'are', 'terrific', 'particularly', 'considering', 'fact', 'Barenboim', 'appeared', 'have', 'performed', 'short', 'time', 'frame', '4', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'actual', 'concerts', '8', 'separate', 'concerts', '3', '5', 'sonatas', 'live', 'audience', 'Barenboim', 'playing', 'was', 'impressive', 'somewhat', 'romantic', 'interpretations', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'more', '34', 'bombastic', '34', 'pieces', 'felt', 'microphones', 'were', 'not', 'placed', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'piano', 'sounded', 'microphones', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'close', 'large', 'fortissimos', 'came', 'too', 'much', '34', 'crashing', '34', 'sound', 'lowered', 'base', 'output', 'system', 'was', 'still', 'bit', 'problem', 'not', 'enough', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'Barenboim', 'playing', 'borderline', 'amazing', '34', 'crashing', '34', 'sound', 'did', 'occasionally', 'distract', 'acoustics', 'hall', 'were', 'captured', 'quite', 'well', 'exception', 'noted', 'above.The', 'remaining', '2', 'discs', 'are', 'Barenboim', 'conducting', 'master', 'classes', '6', 'notable', 'pianists', 'Shai', 'Wonser', 'Alessio', 'Bax', 'Jonathan', 'Biss', 'David', 'Kadouch', 'Saleem', 'Abboud', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'case', 'individual', 'pianists', 'played', 'portions', '6', 'sonatas', 'Barenboim', 'performed', 'part', '8', 'concerts', 'followed', 'critiques', 'discussions', 'master', 'class', '34', 'students', '34', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'how', 'accomplished', 'pianists', 'approached', 'pieces', 'played', 'how', 'differed', 'Barenboim', 'interpretations', 'was', 'interesting', 'witness', '6', 'well-regarded', 'pianists', 'adjusting', 'approaches', 'pieces', 'selected', 'based', 'Barenboim', 'recommendations', 'etc.I', 'was', 'music', 'major', 'college', 'clarinet', 'not', 'piano', 'had', 'learn', 'play', 'piano', 'well', 'enough', 'work', 'way', 'number', 'sonatas', 'classes', 'where', 'analyzed', 'amazing', 'works', 'actually', 'were', 'major', 'part', 'music', 'majors', 'training', 'are', 'monumental', 'not', 'only', 'incredible', 'skill', 'demand', 'pianist', 'also', 'represent', 'bench', 'mark', 'music', 'written', 'solo', 'piano', 'one', 'greatest', 'musical', 'geniuses', 'music', 'history', 'Beethoven', 'writing', 'piano', 'changed', 'way', 'subsequent', 'composers', 'looked', 'instrument', 'range', 'overall', 'possibilities', 'not', 'way', 'wrote', 'combination', 'musical', 'instruments', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'work', 'way', '32', 'sonatas', 'then', 'now', 'was', 'found', 'more', 'little', 'dazzled', 'witness', 'Barenboim', 'perform', '32', 'sonatas', 'course', '8', 'separate', 'concerts', 'what', 'appeared', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'completely', 'memory', 'indication', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'prepared', 'playing', 'was', 'routinely', 'brilliant', 'considering', 'performances', 'were', 'not', 'something', 'produced', 'recording', 'studio.This', 'set', 'DVDs', 'terrific', 'addition', 'serious', 'music', 'lover', 'collection', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'sound', 'capturing', 'apparently', 'wonderful', 'acoustics', 'rather', 'intimate', 'hall', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'part', 'minor', 'complaint', 'had', 'microphone', 'placement', 'small', 'complaint', 'not', 'going', 'stop', 'enjoying', 'set', 'live', 'concert', 'recordings', 'years', 'come', 'am', 'delighted', 'have', 'wonderful', 'discs', 'permanent', 'part', 'growing', 'collection', 'concert', 'DVDs/BlueRays', 'believe', 'only', 'collection', 'available', 'video', 'format', 'much', 'more', 'noteworthy', 'were', ""n't"", 'occasional', '34', 'crashing', '34', 'sounds', 'few', 'loud', 'passages', 'believe', 'were', 'likely', 'due', 'close', 'placement', 'microphones', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'issues', 'rating', 'collection', '5', 'stars']",Barenboim on Beethoven - The Complete Piano Sonatas Live from Berlin

1035913,A1J2LQPDI4NKRG,B000KWZ7VU,Kirk McElhearn,"[0, 0]","Watching this set of DVDs and listening to his magnificent performances shows why Barenboim is clearly the pre-eminent performer of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. While many will disagree - after all, there are countless recordings by dozens of performers - what comes through after seeing these recitals is the deep familiarity that Barenboim has with the music. Playing these sonatas for some fifty years, they have become a part of him, and this shows in the way he performs these works with such conviction. (And without scores, which, alas, too many performers depend on.)This set contains films of a series of eight recitals that Barenboim performed in Berlin in 2005, comprising all 32 of the sonatas. Each recital lasts from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, and contains four sonatas, a mixture of early, middle and late works. The programs themselves work well, but any selection of sonatas played by Barenboim would be fine. The camera work is among the best I've seen for this type of performance; there are enough different camera angles to keep it from being repetitive, and the intensity of watching Barenboim perform is enough to trump the limits of filming. The sound is in PCM stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1; the surround mix is excellent.Barenboim has already recorded the complete Beethoven sonatas twice: once for EMI when he was in his late twenties, and a second time for DG in the 1980s. One could say that these live recitals are closer to the second recording; slow tempi, much rubato, a great intensity and an often meditative approach to the music. Barenboim shines in the late sonatas, and at the end of the op. 111 sonata (no. 32), his intensity is such that he has to wipe tears from his eyes. But the early Haydnesque/Mozartian sonatas are also wonderful, with a full range of youthful passion.In addition to the eight recitals, this set contains two DVDs of master classes, where Barenboim shares his knowledge and experience with six young pianists. While much of the discussion is quite technical, even non-musicians will find some of the comments illuminating, providing insights into music in general and these sonatas in particular.This set is perhaps my best musical purchase in years. I plan to watch these recitals many times, and have gotten many insights into the music - some of the best for piano - simply by watching it performed.",5,Daniel Barenboim owns Beethoven!,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2383,"['Watching', 'set', 'DVDs', 'listening', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'why', 'Barenboim', 'clearly', 'pre-eminent', 'performer', 'Beethoven', '32', 'piano', 'sonatas', 'many', 'will', 'disagree', 'are', 'countless', 'recordings', 'dozens', 'performers', 'what', 'through', 'seeing', 'recitals', 'deep', 'familiarity', 'Barenboim', 'music', 'Playing', 'sonatas', 'fifty', 'years', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'way', 'works', 'such', 'conviction', 'scores', 'alas', 'too', 'many', 'performers', 'depend', 'set', 'films', 'series', 'eight', 'recitals', 'Barenboim', 'performed', 'Berlin', '2005', 'comprising', '32', 'sonatas', 'recital', 'lasts', 'hour', 'quarter', 'hour', 'half', 'four', 'sonatas', 'mixture', 'early', 'middle', 'late', 'works', 'programs', 'work', 'well', 'selection', 'sonatas', 'played', 'Barenboim', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'camera', 'work', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'type', 'performance', 'are', 'enough', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'keep', 'being', 'repetitive', 'intensity', 'watching', 'Barenboim', 'perform', 'enough', 'trump', 'limits', 'filming', 'sound', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix', 'excellent.Barenboim', 'already', 'recorded', 'complete', 'Beethoven', 'sonatas', 'twice', 'once', 'EMI', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'twenties', 'second', 'time', 'DG', '1980s', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'live', 'recitals', 'are', 'closer', 'second', 'recording', 'slow', 'tempi', 'much', 'rubato', 'great', 'intensity', 'often', 'meditative', 'approach', 'music', 'Barenboim', 'shines', 'late', 'sonatas', 'end', 'op', '111', 'sonata', '32', 'intensity', 'such', 'wipe', 'tears', 'eyes', 'early', 'Haydnesque/Mozartian', 'sonatas', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'full', 'range', 'youthful', 'passion.In', 'addition', 'eight', 'recitals', 'set', 'two', 'DVDs', 'master', 'classes', 'where', 'Barenboim', 'shares', 'knowledge', 'experience', 'six', 'young', 'pianists', 'much', 'discussion', 'quite', 'technical', 'even', 'non-musicians', 'will', 'find', 'comments', 'illuminating', 'providing', 'insights', 'music', 'general', 'sonatas', 'particular.This', 'set', 'perhaps', 'best', 'musical', 'purchase', 'years', 'plan', 'watch', 'recitals', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'gotten', 'many', 'insights', 'music', 'best', 'piano', 'simply', 'watching', 'performed']",Barenboim on Beethoven - The Complete Piano Sonatas Live from Berlin

There's even a camera high above and slightly behind Barenboim, looking down with the keyboard stretching from one end of the widescreen image to the other. Splendid! The video switching is conservative and generally very tasteful. I only wish they'd used that spectacular overhead view more, and showed fewer extreme closeups of the artist's face. The poor fellow sweats a lot.The audio is uncompressed stereo PCM, and of excellent quality. A closely-spaced pair of microphones is visible, suspended in front and above the instrument. The perspective is very close and clear, with little or no audience noise (except for applause between sonatas, of course).It's hard to imagine this repertory getting a better treatment anytime soon. Too bad this isn't a Blu-ray. Looks great on my HDTV anyway.What I would have given to attend this concert series in person ...",4,"Not perfect, but as good as we're likely to get",1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,1289,"['Barenboim', 'not', 'favorite', 'interpreter', 'works', 'prefer', 'Arrau', 'delicacy', 'live', 'concerts', 'are', 'marvel', 'nonetheless', 'thirty-two', 'sonatas', 'memory', 'Incredible', 'only', 'detected', 'handful', 'minor', 'flubs.The', 'video', 'production', 'very', 'classy', 'best', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'solo', 'piano', 'concert', 'warm', 'lush', 'lighting', 'scheme', 'are', 'SEVEN', 'cameras', 'surrounding', 'instrument', 'angle', 'even', 'camera', 'high', 'slightly', 'Barenboim', 'looking', 'down', 'keyboard', 'stretching', 'one', 'end', 'widescreen', 'image', 'other', 'Splendid', 'video', 'switching', 'conservative', 'generally', 'very', 'tasteful', 'only', 'wish', ""'d"", 'used', 'spectacular', 'overhead', 'view', 'more', 'showed', 'fewer', 'extreme', 'closeups', 'artist', 'face', 'poor', 'fellow', 'lot.The', 'audio', 'uncompressed', 'stereo', 'PCM', 'excellent', 'quality', 'closely-spaced', 'pair', 'microphones', 'visible', 'suspended', 'front', 'instrument', 'perspective', 'very', 'close', 'clear', 'little', 'audience', 'noise', 'applause', 'sonatas', 'course', '.It', 'hard', 'imagine', 'repertory', 'getting', 'better', 'treatment', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'Blu-ray', 'great', 'HDTV', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'attend', 'concert', 'series', 'person']",Barenboim on Beethoven - The Complete Piano Sonatas Live from Berlin

Having just watched the excellent 2disc '50 Years on Stage', I went looking for more. This is a superb film (6 discs) and Barenboim's Beethoven is wise and abundant - and the film's not just music. Conversation, breezy cutaways, but always returning to the reason for the season, which is Barenboim's musical maturity and his seeming emergence as a revered elder. In the Master Class segments, Barenboim even manages to get Lang Lang to LISTEN more! Young musicians have a great deal to learn from the maestro in this phase of his musical life: learning to lean on music, to trust it, to set aside ego inside one's work, and how to listen as a musician. These pure qualities this pianist possesses in spades. Absolute recommendation. How many times can you hear these sonatas played with this kind of beautiful authority? Dont even think twice.
