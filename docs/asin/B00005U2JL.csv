This DVD I think delivers just what it is supposed to and that is Marilyn at his best. He is a shaman of sorts to open our comatose eyes to reality. He puts on a rockin show. Being in 5.1 surround the sound quality is awesome and the picture is very clear. The concert captures all the best parts of each song performed with clear and smooth transitions, for the most part. I love the effects of his show and the feelings he brings out. At one point, he comes out on a black covered platform, I presume, and looks larger then life. On the ""Nobodies"", he performs in painter's stilts to highten his vision that he wants to share with you, a little part of his world. The 30 minute documentary, ""The Death Parade"", was enjoyable but I guess I was expecting a whole lot more. Personally I got a better view of the person and his life on the road on his ""God is in the TV"" video. But the poet put this together himself and showed us what he wanted.

The rest spent to much time attempting to make this artist seem weird or maybe was an attempt to appear similar to certain Alice Cooper recordings.  When I first saw this DVD, I had accidentally checked it out from the local Library.  I do not recall what title I was reaching for but somehow this ended up in my stack.  So I got to see this video for free by accident.Although I still thought MM appeared to be a little strange in his on stage activities, he really seemed to get a rise out of the audience, and eventually even had a stagnant rocker like myself enjoying the show.  Although it may not have been as grand as seeing Kiss or Alice Cooper -- it did seem to fit into this same catagory.

His vocal range is intense and the band makes the songs that you love so much even more enjoyable.  Examples would be the end to Beautiful People or Sweet Dreams with the Hell Outro, it's just insane!  The only complaint that most people have is that it was filmed in multiple countries, the angle changes can get annoying.  I think the best example of that is the Irresponsible Hate Anthem.  It hurt my eyes the first time I watched that song, but most of the people who complain about it must understand this, I've been to a Manson show, and when they played it, the strobe lights went crazy, and here they try to replicate that, but it doesn't work quite as well.  The combination of strobe lights mixed with angle changes with every change in the song isn't necessarily the best thing.  Another complaint would be that because of the changes his clothes constantly change over and over again.  In one shot he has this helmet on and another he has a dress on or he has paint on him or in somewhat normal Goth clothes, I could go on forever.  But this DVD is so good, that I could care less about those things.Every song is played with amazing quality and sometimes better then the studio versions.  The props Manson brings out make it all the more interesting and never get you bored.  The audiences for these shows are absolutely HUGE by the way.  One of my favorite moments is during the love song Manson comes out wearing a pope outfit or something and John 5 plays a double guitar.  As with the song list, its great, its only missing Angel with the Scabbed wings and more songs from the portrait era, as they only play Lunchbox, I would love to see Dope Hat, but you can't have everything I suppose.  The death parade documentary was entertaining, disgusting an hilarious, but I felt it was too short or still missing some things.  but once again you can't have everything, that's why they make B-Sides.

He always, to me, looked like a character out of The nightmare before Christmas. Plus, I thought it was bizarre how he hit the mainstream by the popularity of recording a Erthymics cover, since his music was distinct and was a milestone of later 90's hard rock. Much of his stuff, I didn't like until the Mechanical Animals stuff.  Yet, I always loved that song LONG HARD ROAD OUT OF HELL from the Spawm Movie.  In fact, I like alot of MM songs from Soundtracks: Sweet Tooth, Tained Love (remake), and the 1st scene into. song to Blair Witch 2: Disposable teens...So,I figured I'd add this DVD to my collection.  I did see this show at Ozzfest so knew what I was getting.  This dvd is well made, the sound is great and I have grown to respect this guy alot as a musician and his crazy-cool lyrics.  Funny, tough, I laughed hysetericly at this concert during his performance of THE NOBODIES and still laught watching it on dvd.  I just think it's whacked him on those old circus stilts.

I'll overlook the fact there are times he's singing, but the microphone ain't quite there. It's obvious Marilyn Manson puts on one hell of a show. This DVD is rockin', in that sense. Just remember, teeenie boppers, it's theatrics. Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and others, in the late sixties and seventies, did this sh--. Manson ain't nothin' new. It ain't like Satananic theatrics are scary anymore. This DVD borders on a three star rating. It's just that he does put on one hell of a show.Marilyn just isn't all that and a bag of chips. His theatrics are good, but it's hard to take a man, in a thong like S&M; type outfit, seriously. Oh, when he supposedly pisses on himself is just so ridiculous. I'm sorry. Smellin' his butt with his fingers just gets comical.I still give it the four stars because I like his music, and this DVD sounds good.The editing takes numerous clips from numerous shows and combines them into one song. Sure it's well done, but it ticks me off when bands do this. Bad Religion did it; but, my lord, how much money does this band have and they release this kind of DVD? It annoys me.I probably should give this DVD three stars, but it does rock. You just have to get over the fact Marilyn looks like an idiot.
