Frank Peretti must have faced this when he sat down to watch ""The Visitation"", a movie very loosely based on his novel of the same name. Fans clamored for months waiting to see this movie come out after hearing rumors of it on the internet for so long. So how did it stack up?Well, if you've read the novel, you probably aren't going to like this movie. It bears little resemblance to that story, though many of the characters have the right names from the book. Edward Furlong was an odd choice for Brandon, since the character was so vital to the story and supposed to be a caring leader with charisma and love. Furlong shows a lot of road wear from his days of drug and alcohol abuse, making him a hard man to want to follow, but this hardness ends up coming in helpful as Brandon slides into the evil side.The ending (and most of the picture) is a major deviation from the book. And things go a little too ""Green Mile"" at a couple of points, but if you're just wanting to watch a good movie, this is a better choice than many. The story is good on its own merit, and spooky in a lot of places it should be. Familiar faces like Kelly Lynch, Randy Travis, and even Priscilla Barnes (from Three's Company) are sprinkled throughout the cast, keeping it from being completely anonymous.Not the worst picture ever made, but a horrible adaptation of Peretti's excellent story. I understand budget contraints, but there had to be a way to make it a little closer to the novel.

I hate Christianity and I hate their films even more. Yet how could I pass up the opportunity to review a Christian horror film? So I watched, and I disliked, and now I will tell you why. Borrowing heavily from ""The Ring,"" ""Visitation"" tries very hard to be entertaining as well as preachy. I must admit these Christian films have gotten a lot better over the past few years. Back in the day they were clueless attempts at making feature length commercials that preached to the converted and left everybody else dashing for the exit. But times are better now. The characters actually change (though in predictable ways), there are actual special effects (though they cry out for more love from the donation plate), and even a little nuance has slipped in. And this one has a message that is even a little sane, beware of false prophets. Now there's something that we all need to hear.The film starts off by following Travis, the town skeptic who conveniently enough is also the town drunk. He lives in one of those middle of nowhere towns where the local folk have nothing better to do than look for images of Jesus in their mildew. Suddenly miracles start to occur. A wheelchair bound man regains his ability to walk, a dog rises from the grave, etc. Then a strange man named Brandon appears claiming to be healer and insinuating that he is the second coming of Jesus. People, being people, are all too eager to believe him and I guess I can't really blame them. It does beg the question though, if a man with scars on his wrists who has the ability to perform miracles appears on the scene why shouldn't people believe that it is Jesus? These are the same people, after all, who though George Bush would make a good president, so they are obviously very easily bamboozled. Brandon is a bad seed and a plot is uncovered where he has to kill somebody every three years to make his master happy. I have to admit, the behavior I saw in Brandon's followers is the same that I see in followers of Jesus today. That cultish, sheep-like way of thinking that led people to believe that it is a sin to read Harry Potter. The film drags on and on. The acting was generally terrible, but I expected that going in. In the end the skeptic puts his Jesus hat back on and everybody goes back to church happy. I just hope that the filmmakers hadn't hoped to convert me because of this little gem. Maybe had the events actually happened to me then I would have become a believer. But seeing ""Spider-Man"" didn't make me believe that he existed either. Don't the Christians realize that in the real world miracles never happen, but in their films they just pile up unchecked. Still, this imbalanced, sluggish film did have some artistic merit. I'm never going to be in Christian demographic so I'm sure they could give two Hail Mary's what I think, but I am only recommending this film to those of you that belong to the lunatic fringe. **",2,Um.  . .It could have been Worse,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,2994,"['Yes', 'know', 'am', 'last', 'person', 'should', 'ever', 'review', 'film', 'hate', 'Christianity', 'hate', 'films', 'even', 'more', 'how', 'could', 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'review', 'Christian', 'horror', 'film', 'So', 'watched', 'disliked', 'now', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'Borrowing', 'heavily', 'Ring', 'Visitation', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'preachy', 'must', 'admit', 'Christian', 'films', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'better', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Back', 'day', 'were', 'clueless', 'attempts', 'making', 'feature', 'length', 'commercials', 'preached', 'converted', 'left', 'everybody', 'else', 'dashing', 'exit', 'times', 'are', 'better', 'now', 'characters', 'actually', 'change', 'predictable', 'ways', 'are', 'actual', 'special', 'effects', 'cry', 'out', 'more', 'love', 'donation', 'plate', 'even', 'little', 'nuance', 'slipped', 'one', 'message', 'even', 'little', 'sane', 'beware', 'false', 'prophets', 'Now', 'something', 'need', 'hear.The', 'film', 'starts', 'off', 'following', 'Travis', 'town', 'skeptic', 'who', 'conveniently', 'enough', 'also', 'town', 'drunk', 'one', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'towns', 'where', 'local', 'folk', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'look', 'images', 'Jesus', 'mildew', 'Suddenly', 'start', 'occur', 'wheelchair', 'man', 'ability', 'walk', 'dog', 'grave', 'etc', 'Then', 'strange', 'man', 'named', 'Brandon', 'claiming', 'be', 'healer', 'insinuating', 'second', 'coming', 'Jesus', 'People', 'being', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'eager', 'believe', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'beg', 'question', 'man', 'scars', 'wrists', 'who', 'ability', 'perform', 'miracles', 'scene', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'people', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'George', 'Bush', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'president', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'easily', 'bamboozled', 'Brandon', 'bad', 'seed', 'plot', 'uncovered', 'where', 'kill', 'somebody', 'three', 'years', 'make', 'master', 'happy', 'have', 'admit', 'behavior', 'saw', 'Brandon', 'followers', 'same', 'see', 'followers', 'Jesus', 'today', 'cultish', 'sheep-like', 'way', 'thinking', 'led', 'people', 'believe', 'sin', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'drags', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'terrible', 'expected', 'going', 'end', 'skeptic', 'Jesus', 'hat', 'back', 'everybody', 'back', 'church', 'happy', 'just', 'hope', 'filmmakers', 'had', ""n't"", 'hoped', 'convert', 'little', 'gem', 'Maybe', 'had', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'believer', 'seeing', 'Spider-Man', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'believe', 'existed', 'either', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Christians', 'realize', 'real', 'world', 'miracles', 'never', 'happen', 'films', 'just', 'pile', 'up', 'unchecked', 'Still', 'imbalanced', 'sluggish', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'artistic', 'merit', ""'m"", 'never', 'going', 'be', 'Christian', 'demographic', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'give', 'two', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'what', 'think', 'am', 'only', 'recommending', 'film', 'belong', 'lunatic', 'fringe', '**']",N/A
954084,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B000BZISXK,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[4, 8]","Sometimes I'm presented with the challenge of making sense of Christian entertainment.  Working in Christian radio a number of weird videos pass across my desk.  Today the promotions manager at work handed me a wild looking DVD and asked me If I would watch it and tell her if I thought it was safe for a family audience.  What I was treated to was probably the silliest ""supernatural"" thriller  I have ever seen.THE VISITATION, based on the best selling novel by FRANK PERETTI, tells the tale of a Pastor named Travis, who lost his faith when he lost his wife, and of a town in the middle of a spiritual crisis.  The town of Antioch has experienced a series of weird religious miracles. A boy survives a deadly car crash without a scratch, a man is healed of knee pain when he touches the tears that come from a wooden crucifix, a picture of Jesus has shown up in a mildew stain on a shower wall, and the local shopkeeper has gotten out of his wheelchair and walked.  Then, a stranger named Brandon Nichols (Edward Furlong) comes to town ans is seen as the man who made all these miracles happen, so obviously the town embraces him as the second coming of Christ.  But alas things may not be what they seem, and it's up to Travis and Antioch's new Veterinarian (Kelly Lynch) to figure out just what is going on.I guess in every group there is a special language that outsiders can't quite understand.  In evangelical Christianity we call it ""Christianese.""  THE VISITATION is steeped in it.  Even I felt like I needed a refresher course.  If your not familiar with the lingo  most of this film will make little sense.  Every moment of the film seemed to be predicated on some basic Christian Theology without any entry way for those who are not familiar to catch up.  It also renders a lot of the dialogue corny and contrived.But if you can get past that you probably won't even be able to figure out just what the movie is trying to say.  There is no logic to the world that created in this film.  Good and Evil may be defined but why can someone cast out a demon in one scene and not be able to do it in another scene?  Are the demons really demons?  If they are really Demons how exactly do they manifest themselves as humans? Why go through all the trouble anyway?These questions are surprising because normally Frank Peretti as an author defines Evil in terms that make sense and because he is listed as one of producers on the film the rough script by Brian Godawa (TO END ALL WARS) had to have passed his desk at some point during the production.  Is his novel as convoluted as the screenplay?  I would hope not.I especially loved the nod to ""CSI"" as the plucky Vet (Kelly Lynch) uses an a CAT scan to read a piece of newspaper.  It seems to be the only reason that her character is a vet, is so that someone  can use this machine to gleam absolutly nothing that is important.  But I laughed as that black piece of paper was run through the machine.  It was silly.More importantly who the heck came up with the ending of this film?  I've seen some really bad closing moments in movies but THE VISITATION'S hokey ending actually mad me laugh.  It is easily the dumbest closing moment I've ever seen.  It involves a chisel and a Bible and it really does have to be seen to be believed.As for the cast you really can't blame them for their performances they're as good as they can be.  Randy Travis plays the dull pastor whose faith never waivers with as much passion as he can.  Martin Donovan gives Travis enough passion to keep his performance watch able, and Kelly Lynch does what she can with the damsel in distress role.  As for Edward Furlong he gets the Christian Slater award of excellence for his over the top tirade in the closing minutes of the film.Don't rent this movie unless your prepared to toss popcorn at the TV and laugh heartily at its complete and utter insanity.  This is a bad movie and if you like that kind of thing this will be your cup of tea.

Ah what a prophecy this is. As the bible says, it's a sin to pay homage to plaster versions of the almighty (or in this case, his son), and so sets the theme for the movie. 'You dont always get what you bargained for is the overwhelming theme throughout the Visitation, a reasonably well done god loving flick for his flock. Is Edward Furlong's portrayal of a mysterious hand scarred stranger indeed the second coming, or is he someone a bit more sinister? are the residents of Antioch receiving miracles or is there another explanation? Ultimately, there are some seriously screwed up circumstances that lead to the visitation and while not original, they are heart wrenching and powerful and provide an excellent opportunity for Edward Furlong to shine as an actor. I was more pleased overall with The Visitation than another frank peretti vehicle called the Hangman's curse simply because it was a better story to follow, but The Visitation's visual effects at times were annoyingly low budget and took away from what could have been a much better film.

954089,A1CHM200OEN65X,B000BZISXK,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[15, 18]","Years ago, I read Peretti's ""The Visitation"" and loved the character development and wary look at American church-ianity.  It depicted a town's struggle between a cynical ex-pastor and a charismatic newcomer, a grassroots preacher with a bag of signs and wonders meant to deceive God's people.  The story was so-so, but my personal connection with many of Peretti's autobiographical tidbits made it a wonderful read.When I rented this movie, I expected to be disappointed, to lose most of what I loved about the book.  Books into movies generally disappoint me, and when it comes to Christian movies--meaning, low-budget and preachy--the disappointment factor intensifies.  (Don't even mention ""The Omega Code"" or ""Left Behind"" to me, please.)  ""The Visitation"" actually rises above many of the typical problems, telling an engaging story, using nice camera work and decent visual effects, and enlisting good actors--although Randy Travis' character seems somewhat stiff due to the script.  The movie falters in its nonstop use of eerie music in an attempt to heighten fear, rather than trusting the other well-handled elements.  While it throws in some wry dialogue between a group of local ministers, it also resorts to a few moments of cliched exorcism and a final plea for redemption that seemed forced, in light of everything else.Yes, this movie deviates from the book in a number of ways, but the story's elements remain intact.  Peretti's thematic point in the book was not to diminish God's miracle power, but to remind believers that a relationship with Jesus is the necessary foundation for discerning between good and evil spirits.  While this point is mostly lost in the film, ""The Visitation"" proves to be an entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking experience.",4,Only Mildy Disappointing,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,1776,"['Years', 'ago', 'read', 'Peretti', 'Visitation', 'loved', 'character', 'development', 'wary', 'look', 'American', 'church-ianity', 'depicted', 'town', 'struggle', 'cynical', 'ex-pastor', 'charismatic', 'newcomer', 'grassroots', 'preacher', 'bag', 'signs', 'wonders', 'meant', 'deceive', 'God', 'people', 'story', 'was', 'so-so', 'personal', 'connection', 'many', 'Peretti', 'autobiographical', 'tidbits', 'made', 'wonderful', 'read.When', 'rented', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lose', 'most', 'what', 'loved', 'book', 'Books', 'movies', 'generally', 'disappoint', 'when', 'Christian', 'movies', 'meaning', 'low-budget', 'preachy', 'disappointment', 'factor', 'intensifies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'Omega', 'Code', 'Left', 'Behind', 'please', 'Visitation', 'actually', 'many', 'typical', 'problems', 'telling', 'engaging', 'story', 'using', 'nice', 'camera', 'work', 'decent', 'visual', 'effects', 'enlisting', 'good', 'actors', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'character', 'somewhat', 'stiff', 'due', 'script', 'movie', 'nonstop', 'use', 'eerie', 'music', 'attempt', 'heighten', 'fear', 'rather', 'trusting', 'other', 'well-handled', 'elements', 'wry', 'dialogue', 'group', 'local', 'ministers', 'also', 'few', 'moments', 'cliched', 'exorcism', 'final', 'plea', 'redemption', 'seemed', 'forced', 'light', 'everything', 'else.Yes', 'movie', 'book', 'number', 'ways', 'story', 'elements', 'remain', 'intact', 'Peretti', 'thematic', 'point', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'diminish', 'God', 'miracle', 'power', 'remind', 'believers', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'necessary', 'foundation', 'discerning', 'good', 'evil', 'spirits', 'point', 'mostly', 'lost', 'film', 'Visitation', 'be', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'thought-provoking', 'experience']",N/A

So this is coming from a person familiar with Peretti but not with this particular novel.I found this movie was great at the questions of whether all supernatural activity is good, whether healing can come from evil sources as well as God, the issues of deception, and the issues of losing one's faith.  The book may do better than the movie did about the process of reclaiming a lost faith, an important theme to the story, but it is possible that the movie makes this hard to do.I am trying to avoid spoiling any surprises.  I will say that like a good mystery that there are hints scattered that make the revelations make sense.  Also, the cast was good.  Martin Donovan was perfect for the role of Travis.  Randy Travis was great as a stern but compassionate Pentecostal preacher (I think it was great to have a character whose theology has him open to the working of the supernatural also be discerning enough to see the difference between the hand of God and the demonic.)  One reviewer questioned Edward Furlong's casting as Brandon, but he did have a Jesus like face, and I found him believable as both the likeable drifter and as the . . . oops, I'm about to spoil the story!  I'm not going to do that!Another reviewer commented on the movie's darkness.  Can a Christian movie be dark?  Yes, because there is darkness in the world, and we are to confront that darkness.  The darkness in the movie fits the story.  I will concur with a different reviewer who stated that this is an adult (as in mature, not as in porn) movie.  It does have disturbing scenes.  But sometimes, we should be disturbed.  My wife and I represent a ministry that works with persecuted Christians.  It was criticized when in one issue it showed Christians being tortured.

954093,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000BZISXK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","I went into ""The Visitation"" with the preconceived notion that it was some sort of Christian propaganda--just from what I've read about it.  I was not familiar with the book and had little knowledge of the movie's story.  I was, then, completely surprised that I didn't find it ""preachy,"" nor did I think it had a strong religious agenda whatsoever.  It was just a mild supernatural thriller, the context of which just happened to be religious.And while I thought I might not like ""The Visitation,"" I was pleased to see Martin Donovan in the lead and a bizarre Edward Furlong hamming it up.  I was, in equal part, entertained and annoyed with the story, because to really enjoy this film--you have to put your brain on hold.  It's an odd situation, really--one that I haven't encountered very often.  The thing that keeps this movie from being very good is the same thing that keeps it from being really bad.  While that may not initially make sense, let me try to elucidate.""The Visitation"" lacks a certain amount of logic and believability in its plotting.  If the story wasn't set in modern day, it definitely would have worked better.  But this movie is set in the world of Internet, cell phones, and mass media--and that just raises all kinds of problems.  For example, take the ""healer"" who may be Christ himself.  He raises dead dogs, cures paralysis and blindness, eliminates scars.  He does become a local celebrity, but does this town exist in a vacuum?  In reality, we know a media circus and throngs of believers in a religious fervor would descend upon that town.  In the day when a grilled cheese sandwich with the image of Jesus' face makes international news, it seems odd no one is particularly interested in the Second Coming.  He has also adopted several different personas within a relatively small geographical area--so if he was ever on TV or the Internet, he would likely have been identified much earlier.  In fact, after a slew of ""miracles,"" his first tent meeting is attended only by about 20 people--even Kevin Federline would draw more of a crowd.So while this is completely implausible, it is just this that keeps the movie from completely derailing.  By keeping things localized, the film is able to present itself as a tidy little thriller.  The deranged and gullible townspeople provide a lot of amusement, especially the more overwrought they become.  I'm not sure I ever understood just what the villain's agenda was--I know he needed a kill, I'm not sure why he had to torment the town (he didn't do that any other time).  It's never made clear what is different in this instance.  Ultimately, though, I actually enjoyed most of this film as a cheesy bit of fluff.  It's fun in a campy, bad movie sort of way--and I'd probably even recommend it.You could do worse, and when you see the movie, I hope you'll understand my title to this review.

954099,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000BZISXK,Michael Butts,"[2, 4]","THE VISITATION, the movie, bears little resemblance to Frank Peretti's book.  On its own, it's a fairly good thriller, although better actors in the leading roles might have made it more convincing.Martin Donovan plays Travis, a former minister, who left his calling when his wife was brutally murdered and her killer never found.  Donovan is too stiff to evoke any real compassion or concern.  Kelly Lynch plays Antioch's new vet whose son is mystified by the new stranger in town----someone who claims to be a new Messiah.  When several people are miraculously ""cured,"" the whole town falls under the spell of one Brandon Nichols, a supposedly charismatic man with the healing touch.  Edward Furlong (The Terminator movies) is all wrong for the part of Nichols.  His scruffy hair and his laconic manner hardly give him any kind of charisma; he seems too egocentric and self-serving to be a true Messiah.  Country singer Randy Travis sleepwalks through his role as the Revered Kyle who suspects Nichols is a phoney; and Richard Tyson and Priscilla Barnes ham up their roles as the redneck sheriff and his gushing wife.Fans of demonic possession will probably enjoy the goings-on, which are pretty tame as far as violence and gore go.

954100,A2VPDTH3KMTHIE,B000BZISXK,"Richard A. Back ""Video Voyeur""","[1, 1]",The Visitation is a fairly interesting movie concerning a sort of mixture of demonic possession and faith healing.  Edward Furlong stars as Christ-like faith healer who mesmerizes a small town into believing that he is a returning Jesus through the healing of various forms of illness and disabilities merely by the use of touch.  The protagonists in the movie are several doubters with clerical backgrounds in different Christian faiths and others who have abandoned their beliefs altogether who see him as a false prophet and do not buy into his veneer of altruism.  It turns out that the fake prophet has a dark agenda which is motivated by his hatred of the town due to their failure years ago to remove him from the household of an abusive father and his own subsequent covenant with the devil who offered him a sanctuary in return for human sacrifices.  The fake prophet has some frightening accomplices which help him and herald his forthcoming and there are some pretty good supernatural shocks during the course of the movie.

954101,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000BZISXK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","The Visitation (Robby Henson, 2006)Stop me if you've heard this one before: Satan (and assorted henchmen) appear in a bucolic rural town, does a few parlor tricks, and immediately wins over most of the town's fervent Christians, leaving only an agnostic, an atheist (who used to be a minster, natch) and the town's Evangelical not believing this guy is really Jesus returned to Earth. But they persevere, with the help of the real Jesus, and of course everyone gets Christianized in the process. Sound familiar? It should; this is a tried and true plot of Christian (and, actually, secular) horror fiction. And guess what? The movie's based on a novel by Frank Peretti, the John Coyne of Christianity. (For those who don't remember Coyne, whose horror career-- he writes golf books now-- died a relatively unmourned death in the late eighties, he was responsible for hard-line genre potboilers that were notable for never straying from convention. I grabbed his name out of the air because I thought a couple of his books had been turned into movies, but IMDB seems to be rebuffing me on that point. I can't believe no one made a movie of The Legacy-- sheesh!)That said, for an utterly predictable, silly potboiler, it's not half terrible; it reminds me a great deal of some of the killer-bug movies from the mid-seventies, lining up a great, great cast and giving them absolute squadoosh to work with. In this case, Satan's henchman is played by Edward Furlong, who never fails to being the noise. The fallen minister, quite ironically, is played by Martin Donovan (whose character in Saved! was such a delicious counterpoint to this); the agnostic is Kelly Lynch; the Evangelical is Randy Travis, who I have to say makes a much better actor than he does a singer. While that's not saying much, I do mean it as a compliment. There's a pretty good supporting cast backing them up, too; Satan's minion's right-hand man, especially. He's played by James Horan, of whom you haven't seen much, but you know him; he's done a great deal of voice work over the years. Why he's not in front of the camera more is beyond me; he's got a great look. Ellen Geer (Will's daughter) is a lot of fun here, too, and there are a bunch of other folks who provide as much color. Director Robby Henson seems to have a knack for making movies on a shoestring budget and getting casts of this caliber, look up his movie The Badge on IMDB and marvel. (This cast looks like pikers by comparison.) And to be fair, Henson did a fantastic job with what he had to work with; given the budget, this is a fine, fine-looking movie. I'm surprised two and a half million covered the film stock, much less everything else. Catering by Taco Bell, I guess?If it hadn't been saddled with such a terrible, terrible script, this really would have been a bang-up effort. I'm simultaneously looking forward to and dreading Henson's two more recent films, both of which have been adaptations of Ted Dekker novels. ***",3,Not nearly as awful as I expected.,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,2974,"['Visitation', 'Robby', 'Henson', '2006', 'Stop', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'one', 'before', 'Satan', 'assorted', 'henchmen', 'appear', 'bucolic', 'rural', 'town', 'few', 'parlor', 'tricks', 'immediately', 'most', 'town', 'fervent', 'Christians', 'leaving', 'only', 'agnostic', 'atheist', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'minster', 'natch', 'town', 'Evangelical', 'not', 'believing', 'guy', 'really', 'Jesus', 'returned', 'Earth', 'persevere', 'help', 'real', 'Jesus', 'course', 'everyone', 'Christianized', 'process', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'tried', 'true', 'plot', 'Christian', 'actually', 'secular', 'horror', 'fiction', 'guess', 'what', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Frank', 'Peretti', 'John', 'Coyne', 'Christianity', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Coyne', 'horror', 'career', 'golf', 'books', 'now', 'died', 'relatively', 'unmourned', 'death', 'late', 'eighties', 'was', 'responsible', 'hard-line', 'genre', 'potboilers', 'were', 'notable', 'never', 'straying', 'convention', 'grabbed', 'name', 'air', 'thought', 'couple', 'books', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'movies', 'IMDB', 'be', 'rebuffing', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'made', 'movie', 'Legacy', 'sheesh', 'said', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'silly', 'potboiler', 'not', 'half', 'terrible', 'great', 'deal', 'killer-bug', 'movies', 'mid-seventies', 'lining', 'up', 'great', 'great', 'cast', 'giving', 'absolute', 'squadoosh', 'work', 'case', 'Satan', 'henchman', 'played', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'who', 'never', 'being', 'noise', 'fallen', 'minister', 'quite', 'ironically', 'played', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'character', 'Saved', 'was', 'such', 'delicious', 'counterpoint', 'agnostic', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'Evangelical', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'who', 'have', 'say', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'singer', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'do', 'mean', 'compliment', 'pretty', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'backing', 'up', 'too', 'Satan', 'minion', 'right-hand', 'man', 'especially', 'played', 'James', 'Horan', 'whom', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'know', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'voice', 'work', 'years', 'Why', 'not', 'front', 'camera', 'more', 'got', 'great', 'look', 'Ellen', 'Geer', 'Will', 'daughter', 'lot', 'fun', 'here', 'too', 'are', 'bunch', 'other', 'folks', 'who', 'provide', 'much', 'color', 'Director', 'Robby', 'Henson', 'have', 'knack', 'making', 'movies', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'getting', 'casts', 'caliber', 'look', 'up', 'movie', 'Badge', 'IMDB', 'marvel', 'cast', 'pikers', 'comparison', 'be', 'fair', 'Henson', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'given', 'budget', 'fine', 'fine-looking', 'movie', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'two', 'half', 'million', 'covered', 'film', 'stock', 'much', 'less', 'everything', 'else', 'Catering', 'Taco', 'Bell', 'guess', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'saddled', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'script', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bang-up', 'effort', ""'m"", 'simultaneously', 'looking', 'forward', 'dreading', 'Henson', 'two', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'adaptations', 'Ted', 'Dekker', 'novels', '***']",N/A

They hear the term applied, assume that the movie is going to be perfectly horrible, and watch it thinking as such. When THE VISITATION came out on DVD, I picked it up. I had enjoyed Frank Peretti's book by the same title a lot, and was very shocked by the ending of the story. And as I settled in to watch the movie, I started getting really excited.Pretty much, a fallen minister, Travis Jordan, is at the end of his rope, not caring too much about what else happens in the little town around him. But then miracles start happening, people are being healed, and a mysterious stranger has come to town proclaiming love and peace to the people. Travis Jordan, a local veterinarian, and Kyle Sherman, a preacher, are all feeling very uneasy about the goings on, and when they start looking deeper into the situation, they start to find something they never wished they had stumbled onto...The story does deviate slightly from the book, but the major plot points are intact, and the ending gives the viewer a somewhat disturbing feeling after film's end. The cinematography is amazing, finding perfectly wonderful angles to film, and the cutting is just right to give an intense creepy feel to the film. The acting actually was pretty good, featuring Martin Donovan (Saved!) Randy Travis, Edward Furlong (Terminator 2), and Hilary Tuck (Honey I Shrunk The Kids the Television Series).As far as CONTENT goes: There is a little bit of cleavage during one scene in the film, there are some very disturbing situations, but nothing incredibly graphic is shown. Blood is about the worst of the gore. There is no language in the film, which is a nice change for movies today.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed THE VISITATION, and I would encourage viewers to remember that movies and books are different entities.
