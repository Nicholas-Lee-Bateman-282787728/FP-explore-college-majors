Among them is Leslie Neilson (CREEPSHOW, DAY OF THE ANIMALS) and Jessica Walter (PLAY MISTY FOR ME). The victim was found at the bottom of the swimming pool, he'd been shot twice. The case becomes increasingly complicated as it goes along. When the murder weapon disappears, the mystery deepens.  Watch for the lovely Jo Ann Pflug (THE NIGHT STRANGLER, SCREAM OF THE WEREWOLF) as a perky reporter, Michael Petaki (GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE, ZOLTAN: HOUND OF DRACULA) as a crusty suspect, Vic Tayback (BLOOD AND LACE) as a crusty private investigator, and Ed Asner as a crusty cop!

825026,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00025XGIQ,drkhimxz,"[4, 4]","This is a routine TV film from 1970. It is worth watching primarily for its creator and the later stars who made it. The original novel was by Erle Stanley Gardner, whose Perry Mason,was the basis for one of the Big hits of 1950's TV; with much better production, it returned to TV a couple of decades later as a highly successful series of TV movies, also starring the Canadian actor, Raymond Burr. The lead of this film is Jim Hutton, who died while starring in the short lived but excellent Ellery Queen series (and co-starred as the love interest in Cary Grant's last film). The woman in the case is Jessica Walter, award winning actress. The ubiquitous Lloyd Bochner, fine Canadian actor, who appeared frequently in television and films, was the suave attorney, while Ed Asner, on the cusp of his career breakthrough with Mary Tyler Moore and then his own show, plays the police chief. Other familiar faces fill out the cast, Quality is what you would expect from an (apparently) untouched video from 1970; for me it enhanced the nostalgic flavor of the material.All in all, it is decent entertainment with a bit of a riddle to it.",4,A Nice TV Film based on Erle Stanley Gardner,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1136,"['routine', 'TV', 'film', '1970', 'worth', 'watching', 'primarily', 'creator', 'later', 'stars', 'who', 'made', 'original', 'novel', 'was', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'basis', 'one', 'Big', 'hits', '1950', 'TV', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'returned', 'TV', 'couple', 'decades', 'later', 'highly', 'successful', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'also', 'starring', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'lead', 'film', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'who', 'died', 'starring', 'short', 'lived', 'excellent', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'series', 'co-starred', 'love', 'interest', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'last', 'film', 'woman', 'case', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'award', 'winning', 'actress', 'ubiquitous', 'Lloyd', 'Bochner', 'fine', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'who', 'appeared', 'frequently', 'television', 'films', 'was', 'suave', 'attorney', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'cusp', 'career', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'then', 'own', 'show', 'police', 'chief', 'Other', 'familiar', 'fill', 'out', 'cast', 'Quality', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'apparently', 'untouched', 'video', '1970', 'enhanced', 'nostalgic', 'flavor', 'material.All', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'bit', 'riddle']",They Call It Murder

This is a story of Jim Hutton as a prosecuting attorney personally involved in investigating a murder. This was before Columbo but in the same spirit. It was a walk down memory lane with actors that were in their prime and well known.  I would recommend this film as a great nostalgic walk.

825033,AMW04HD3LSI89,B00025XGIQ,Richard L. Jackson,"[4, 4]","Based on Erle Stanley Gardener's book The D A draws a circle, Jim Hutton and a cast of easily recognized actors star in what was probably intended to be a pilot for a new weekly tv series. This series of books is interesting in that Gardner reverses the Perry Mason formula and has the young D.A. be the crusader for justice. I have often wondered why any of the books were never filmed in the past. Upon reading the books, one can imagine Jimmy Steward playing the part of Doug Selby. Unfortunately, if it was intended as a pilot, it was not picked up. The quality of the film is a bit cheesy as well. It sort of plods along. One would do well to read the book and compare notes. You will find the tv film, whose script was written by the talented Sam Rolfe (the man who invented Palidin in Have Gun will Travel) is actually an improvement structurally. Personally I enjoyed the film. I feel, given the opportunity, it could have made a nice series. Of course, this is still a possibility. Wouldn't it be weird (to say the least) to see the cast of Monk re-assembled to play the parts? Lt Disher would be Doug Selby, Stottlemeyer would play the sheriff and Monk could play the suave but wicked attorney A B Carr. Just kidding. The movie is worth watching but I am not sure about buying it. Bad copy.
