196967,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6300147967,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 8]","SAVING GRACE (Dir. Robert M. Young, Writ. Richard Cramer after Celia Gittelson's novel, 1986, 112 minutes). OK, my review title is a cheap shot. Let me explain: this excellent film (I truly love it) came on the heels of the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978. That was the year of 3 popes and 2 conclaves: Paul VI died, John Paul I was elected and died 33 days later, then Pope John Paul II was elected.It wasn't until the early 1980s that the smear campaign story got out: someone had ""murdered"" Pope John Paul I. A book was published on the subject in the 1980s (David Yallop'sIn God's Name: An Investigation Into the Murder of Pope John Paul I, see my review). It was destiny that the story of Pope John Paul I would sooner rather than later inspire a few films.This Tom Conti vehicle is 'the original SAVING GRACE' (with at least one other film and one TV series having the exact same title ... WHY?). With Robbie Coltrane's disastrous turn in 1991's THE POPE MUST DIE (later retitledThe Pope Must Diet [VHS] after a terrible international stink, see my review) SAVING GRACE make up what I used to call ""The Vatican Duo"". Later, someone came along to pin the slight misnomer ""The Vatican Trilogy"" on Morris West's two pope-related novels.Here, at least, there is a sane approach to the life we suppose the pope lives at the Vatican. Tom Conti, a doubtful cardinal, gets elected pope (I believe he chooses the name Leo XIV). Soon he gets himself locked out of the Vatican (they say this happened to John Paul I) due to his gardening clothes - he looks like a bum, so he runs off to live like one. I am sorry about the delirious fan who states to me that he does not run off to live like a bum, but if you know anything of this film, you know he ran off to live like a bum in a nearby village.What, the man didn't know how to use a phone from just outside Vatican City? Anyway, he goes to a small quarantined village and makes a home there. I love the reviewer who compares Conti's pope to the Christ figure. I never thought of it that way, and I saw this film new when it was released. I've watched it ever since, and it improves with age.Naturally Leo wishes to put the townspeople back on their feet, and he's lucky: no one recognizes him. Only ex-priest Abalardi, a local shepherd, recognizes him. Then Pope Leo has to do battle with the criminal forces of the village. The talent here is a marvel for such a low-budget production: Fernando Rey as Stefano Cardinal Biondi, the Camerlengo; Giancarlo Gianini as ex-Father Abalardi the shepherd; Edward Olmos in an early role, as Ciolin the villain and gang-leader; and the lovely Patricia Mauceri as the charming Lucia.Viewers will immediately see the obvious connexion with Morris West'sThe Shoes of the Fisherman Volumes One and Two. This is, after all, about a suddenly elected pope who doesn't want the job and longs to escape from the Vatican. He manages to do so, and gets invovled in all kinds of highjinks. That is the basic synopsis for SAVING GRACE and FISHERMAN. Naturally, no one could do a pope-oriented film without acknowledging Morris West's final 3rd of his 'trilogy',The Clowns of God(see my review of that, it really deserves to be made into a film).I cannot give away the whole story as the great reviewer had to do to make his point about the pope and Christ. I can only promise that you will grow to love this gentle, silly film as I have, over time, and you will appreciate it now more than ever.

196972,A2POFUU2U3X96U,6300147967,Lj Magic,"[2, 2]","I remember seeing the preview to this movie when it was released in the theaters, and thinking, ""Sounds Funny!"" Well, we may have been a little mislead by that. However, this movie shows what we all must go through at one time in our lives: Self-Realization. As the Pope, is Leo really doing God's work? As a figurehead, maybe. But that's not why he became a priest. His lack of opportunity to help others, and the guilt that it brings to him is sparked by a small girl from a remote town who comes all the way to Rome to tell him that her town has no priest. His heart aches, and when he finds himself locked out of the Vatican and dressed pretty much like a bum, his impulse is to find this town and see how life can be infused back into it. Along the way, he meets bullies, theives, and love. This movie could have gotten ugly, and we could have seen the Pope in bed with a beautiful young woman, whom he understandably finds very attractive. Instead, we see a morality tale, where he won't be stopped from helping these people when they don't want to help themselves. He suffers a tremendous loss when a boy from the village is mudered, but through his death, the town once again comes alive. They do in fact have a priest in their town, and with Leo's help, he finds God again. There are plenty of smiles in this movie, but I am more touched by the story of a man who truly wants to help his fellow man. I know this is a little known show. Too bad. There are so many good lessons to be learned. But as is has no wild sex scenes, or guns blasting, most people aren't interested. I wish there were more shows like this one. After watching it, you feel like even you may make a contribution to someone's life that will change it forever, just like Leo did.",5,Why not DVD?!,1184976000,"07 21, 2007",2007,1758,"['remember', 'seeing', 'preview', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'thinking', 'Funny', 'Well', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'mislead', 'However', 'movie', 'what', 'must', 'go', 'one', 'time', 'lives', 'Self-Realization', 'Pope', 'Leo', 'really', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'figurehead', 'maybe', 'not', 'why', 'became', 'priest', 'lack', 'opportunity', 'help', 'others', 'guilt', 'sparked', 'small', 'girl', 'remote', 'town', 'who', 'way', 'Rome', 'tell', 'town', 'priest', 'heart', 'aches', 'when', 'locked', 'Vatican', 'dressed', 'pretty', 'much', 'bum', 'impulse', 'find', 'town', 'see', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'infused', 'back', 'way', 'bullies', 'theives', 'love', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'ugly', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'Pope', 'bed', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'understandably', 'very', 'attractive', 'Instead', 'see', 'morality', 'tale', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'stopped', 'helping', 'people', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'help', 'tremendous', 'loss', 'when', 'boy', 'village', 'mudered', 'death', 'town', 'once', 'again', 'alive', 'do', 'fact', 'have', 'priest', 'town', 'Leo', 'help', 'God', 'again', 'are', 'plenty', 'smiles', 'movie', 'am', 'more', 'touched', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'help', 'fellow', 'man', 'know', 'little', 'known', 'show', 'Too', 'bad', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'wild', 'sex', 'scenes', 'guns', 'blasting', 'most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'shows', 'one', 'watching', 'feel', 'even', 'may', 'make', 'contribution', 'someone', 'life', 'will', 'change', 'forever', 'just', 'Leo', 'did']",Saving Grace VHS

196977,A3O0Q743WSQ2AJ,6300147967,Margaret Magnus,"[86, 88]","I think this is the most underrated movie I know of. And I frankly don't understand why it's not a major hit readily available on DVD. It's very well directed and cast -- I especially like Giancarlo Giannini (sp?), but Conti and Olmos and others were great too. However, the real power of the movie derives from the quality of Celia Gittelson's story. It's intelligent, warm-hearted, deep, and very funny. I watch it on sad evenings before I fall off to sleep, and life's not so bad.I can't help using this as a forum to explain what I see in the movie.The Pope grows heavy from being an abstraction -- longs to return to the life of a priest where he can do some concrete good for concrete people. And suddenly he finds himself with an opportunity to wander in the world incognito.This of course leaves room for all kinds of hysterical lines by people who don't know who he is (""You can go straight to hell. Who do you think you are?"" or ""Maybe he's a priest?"" ""Naw, a priest would tell us we go to hell for this.""), and how his friends at the Vatican try to cover for him (""You got a job?... With all due respect, your Holiness, can't these villagers sort their own rags?"")And there's one concrete thing that he wants to do. He -- the most significant -- is guided to it, by one of the most insignificant a deaf girl from a small village (Isabella) who has taken the step of leaving her home to find him... and this act somehow demands that he respond.It's the story of how the Christ figure (who I regard as our own true self) comes to earth and lives among us; how he works; what doubts, fears and confusions he has; what matters to him; what effect he has on various types of people. It's an explanation of the mechanism whereby mankind is redeemed.The mechanism is to go to a place where people are defeated, take on some arbitrary project which represents a positive step, and simply act. The extent to which you know what you're doing is irrelevant. What matters is the intention.The Pope chooses in this defeated village to rebuild the aqueduct. He knows nothing about construction. And as none of the important people -- the adult males -- will help, he gets his help from those whom society deems insignificant -- orphaned children, widows.And then you see the incredibly venomous and destructive reaction which his actions evoke in the negative forces in the society. They begin by burning the partially reconstructed aqueduct. At this point Isabella's beautiful, sane and soulful mother -- with whom he is falling in love -- asks him, ""So what are you going to do?"" ""I'll build it again."" ""He'll just burn it again."" ""So I'll build it again. And when he comes back, I'll be here. I'll be waiting for him.""It maybe sounds stupid, but on several occasions in life, I've felt defeated -- my actions seem to be in a void, no one notices -- and this movie somehow helps me to get off my duff and 'rebuild the aqueduct'... restore my faith that my intention is heard somewhere in the ether, even if I can't see the results.I find myself these days also relating the film to world politics. It's an essentially European film, and it restores my faith somehow that despite all their criticism of the US these days, Europe does understand the mechanism of nihilism and restoration. Europe too is on some level understandably defeated. And for all her doubts and failings, I believe the US is a positive force in the world...The second attempt to burn is headed off by his band of ophaned boys whose allegiance the Pope has usurped from the main bad guy (Olmos). In the third burning, the incredibly charming leader of the gang is killed. He's the sacrificial lamb which spreads the Pope's intentions among the community as a whole. The Pope now feels defeated, but the community fills in.And then there's the one town drunk, Abalardi, who lives on the outskirts, tends sheep, and is the only one who recognizes the Pope for who he really is.

But never mind, in this movie he is the youngish Pope Leo XIV.  The story is that the pope is feeling detached from the rest of the world and during an audience comes into contact with a young deaf girl from a small village that is without a priest.  She asks the pope to send them one and he agrees.By a sheer accident of fate, while Pope Leo is doing some gardening in old clothes he accidentally gets locked out of his home in Vatican City.  He has no money but for once he feels free as he gets tossed in the Trevi Fountain after a successful football game. After all, these Italians love their game and know how to celebrate. After finding his way to the small village of the young girl, he discovers more than just a missing priest, and this is where the story really starts to take place.While a lot of this plot seems unbelievable, there really is a message underneath all of this.  During his stay in the village, Pope Leo strives to discover what it is that he is really meant to do.  What it boils down to is instilling motivation and hope into a group of people who have lost their way.  Not only has the village become dilapidated and run down, there is an old aquaduct that no longer functions and no one seems motivated to remedy that.  Some of the reasons come in the guise of a group of ruffians who seize control of the villagers.  How can the people stand up to such bullies?  For one, you must believe in yourself and have faith.  Everyone is tested, including the Pope.There are a lot of funny moments in this film.  I loved the one scene where a member of the curia says, ""The Vatican Bank needs more investors,"" and describes ways to do this.  The Pope replies ""And what should we give to the most wealthy investors?""
