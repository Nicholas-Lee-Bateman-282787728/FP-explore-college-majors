It gave me an opportunity to remember my childhood when the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" TV show was shown more frequently.  I constantly laughed during the episodes.  If you like the old school ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and their ability to provide humor, you should definitely purchase this DVD set.  I could tell on the episodes that the boys really did not want Dave to get married.  I don't want to spoil it for future viewers.
