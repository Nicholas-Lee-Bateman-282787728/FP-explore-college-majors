Garp marries, has kids, whom he loves dearly and dotes on. His wife has an affair with disastrous consequences; his mother is eventually assassinated.

As with many films The World According to Garp sat on my DVD shelf until I had a chance to watch it. Well, that night came this week and I gave The World According to Garp DVD a spin. I was shocked at how poorly this movie was treated on DVD. The audio is simply awful - I had to crank my receiver WAY up and even then I could hear a hiss in the audio track. The video is equally poor with scenes so riddled with edge enhancement that it looks like this DVD was mastered from the video tape! Also the DVD has zero special features.I know every release can't get Special Edition treatment, but The World According to Garp is so rich with possibilities - why not get John Irving to do a commentary (he did one for The Cider House Rules)? Robin Williams who could talk about the role that really launched him as a serious actor. Even director George Roy Hill (who also did The Sting, Slap Shot and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) is still around and has done commentaries!

Williams is grand here - far better than he was in ""Good Will Hunting"" for which he received an Academy Award.  But the best part of the movie rests in the supporting performances from Glenn Close as Jenny (Garp's mom) and John Lithgow as the transexual Roberta.  Both were Oscar nominated - deservedly so - for their rich, uncompromising performances, that transcend stereotypes and involve the audience every step of the way.  Mary Beth Hurt as Garp's wife, hits her notes well, especially in the heart-wrenching scenes of marital infidelity that ultimately cost her dearly.  Aside from these terrific characterizations, the movie boasts a number of unforgettable lines....""Garp bit Bonky"" is a classic (when Williams bites a neighbor's dog), and who can ever forget the car coasting accident when Garp arrives home early (and stealthily) only to back into a car holding his wife and her lover (who pays dearly for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.)

It is Robin Williams first starring role, as well as making stars out of Glenn Close and John Lithgow. As whimsical as most of Williams' characters to this point, he nonetheless plays it reasonably straight suggesting future brilliant performances (&quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, etc.). The acting, in general, is superb with great bits from the likes of Amanda Plummer and Swoozie Kurtz. The bittersweet tale (from John Irving's novel) involves life seen through the eyes of a collection of free-spirited individuals, most notably Jenny Fields (Close) and her son Garp (Williams). It's a fascinating narrative, and would make no sense to try to explain the plot. In any form--VHS, DVD, edited for content--it's worth seeing. The opening titles are, indeed, a joy to behold. My problem with the just-released DVD is that, though the film is rated R, it has been slightly edited to about a PG. Some of the most brilliant lines have been cut, or clouded over. Disappointing as this may be, it's still a brilliant film, an achievement worthy of the term &quot;classic&quot; (definitely &quot;cult-classic&quot;). Also, though filmed in Panavision, the &quot;widescreen&quot; transfer is only 1.85:1. Director Geore Roy Hill had lots of business going on that was virtually lost, or rendered unimportant.

Amusing, often. But despite the fact that it sets itself up as a tragicomic social satire walking several different ropes at the same time, not much of it really stays with you after it's over.One minute we have a character gaping doe-eyed at his children, speaking lovingly about the joys of fatherhood, and the next minute he's taking an iron pipe to an electrician's truck because the electrician was driving too fast through the neighborhood. Which is all fine, thanks in no small measure to the convincing wigs of John Lithgow as a transvestite.Holes begin to appear when all this reverie is broken with grave issues like a cultic feminist group, members of which cut off their tongues in protest for a young girl's rape. Deep. Our protagonist Garp wishes to lead a happy life of apathetic normalcy  (not altogether different from what the audience wants, really) but his mother has other plans. When the film gets preachy, we have little choice but to squirm and play along.To be fair, the film is a very decent rental ride though, sporting a fairly blithe tone, a sprawling scope to appeal to different pallettes, and some fabulous performances all round (you can see why Williams shot to fame shortly after this film), both on-screen as well as off-screen (in the form of the best Beatles number ever).A recommendation somewhere between mildly pleasing and terrific.",3,"BREEZY ""TERMS OF ENDEARMENT"", BUT THEN IT GETS PREACHY",1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,1504,"['lovely', 'odysseys', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'oddly', 'unaffecting', 'movie', 'Interesting', 'yes', 'Original', 'occasionally', 'Amusing', 'often', 'fact', 'up', 'tragicomic', 'social', 'satire', 'walking', 'several', 'different', 'ropes', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'over.One', 'minute', 'have', 'character', 'gaping', 'doe-eyed', 'children', 'speaking', 'lovingly', 'joys', 'fatherhood', 'next', 'minute', 'taking', 'iron', 'pipe', 'electrician', 'truck', 'electrician', 'was', 'driving', 'too', 'fast', 'neighborhood', 'Which', 'fine', 'thanks', 'small', 'measure', 'convincing', 'wigs', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'transvestite.Holes', 'begin', 'appear', 'when', 'reverie', 'broken', 'grave', 'issues', 'cultic', 'feminist', 'group', 'members', 'cut', 'off', 'tongues', 'protest', 'young', 'girl', 'rape', 'Deep', 'protagonist', 'Garp', 'lead', 'happy', 'life', 'apathetic', 'normalcy', 'not', 'altogether', 'different', 'what', 'audience', 'really', 'mother', 'other', 'plans', 'When', 'film', 'preachy', 'have', 'little', 'choice', 'squirm', 'play', 'along.To', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'very', 'decent', 'rental', 'ride', 'sporting', 'fairly', 'blithe', 'tone', 'sprawling', 'scope', 'appeal', 'different', 'pallettes', 'fabulous', 'performances', 'round', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Williams', 'shot', 'fame', 'shortly', 'film', 'on-screen', 'as', 'well', 'off-screen', 'form', 'best', 'Beatles', 'number', 'ever', '.A', 'recommendation', 'somewhere', 'mildly', 'pleasing', 'terrific']",N/A
