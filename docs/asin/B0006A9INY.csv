The emotional tension remains tight all the way through, yet the movie never becomes oppressive.  There are a number of relieving moments of achievement, of aid from other people, of being befriended by strangers.  The characters, especially the father, are all realistic.  No stereotypes here.  The father is a real horror.  Unfortunately, such people are not only real but not uncommon.Rick Shroeder does an excellent job with the acting and with the Georgia accent.  Not a trace of his natural southern California accent comes through in any of the scenes.Good movie for the whole family.

864697,A1OEYPETQ24X4O,B0006A9INY,"Linda Huntington ""Lives for music""","[11, 11]",I have always thought Ricky Shroeder was a great star and this movie just adds to his greatness in my mind.  As an older brother he was determined to keep his promise to his dying mother to keep his siblings together.  Feeling he had failed at times did not stop him from pushing forward to accomplish his goal. The odds against him were great but he made you believe in the boy and his fight. I would recommend this highly and I have watched it over and over again.  He also did a great job of acting with Brad Pitts in Across the Tracks another great movie about brothers.,5,A Son's Promise,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,574,"['have', 'always', 'thought', 'Ricky', 'Shroeder', 'was', 'great', 'star', 'movie', 'just', 'greatness', 'mind', 'older', 'brother', 'was', 'determined', 'keep', 'promise', 'dying', 'mother', 'keep', 'siblings', 'together', 'Feeling', 'had', 'failed', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'pushing', 'forward', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'odds', 'were', 'great', 'made', 'believe', 'boy', 'fight', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly', 'have', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'Brad', 'Pitts', 'Across', 'Tracks', 'great', 'movie', 'brothers']",A Son's Promise
