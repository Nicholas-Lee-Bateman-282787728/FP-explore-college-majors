424121,A38N4MOCLSOKOH,6304460260,Armando A. Gomez,"[2, 4]","In the pantheon of Great War movies such as ""Patton,"" ""Hell Are For Heroes"" and ""The Sand Pebble"" I rank ""Castle Keep"" right along with them.  Castle Keep starts off with a sense of ""Look out, folks, this is uncommon rabbit hole.""  And it is.  But this isn't an ordinary WWII war movie as the narrator of the movies starts: ""Eight walking wounded chanced upon a castle...""  Its premise is uncommon: its art and history vs. theory and practice.  Who will be the victor?  Can there be a victory?  Almost immediately I'm reminded of the bombing of Dresden.  Does that metaphor carry any weight in the film?  Whether it does or not it's still a weighty film.  It's a film about misfits, about baker's dozen and The Lost Boys.  About make-shift prophets and a buffalo riding on a horse. It's about catching your breath and the Red Queen's whores.  For these weary soldiers they suddenly find themselves in a world of shell shock and storybook fantasy.  But the business of killing persists.  With the Germen reaching and breaching the walls of Castle Keep it's every man and connoisseur for himself.  It's a battle that every players of this movie can't afford to lose regardless of the outcome, of motive.  Above all one of the soldiers is a writer.  From the lowly trooper to the top major they all request one thing from him: write the truth.  When the ashes of war settles the storyteller always rise.  Without storytellers there are no war stories.  Oh, yeah, there's the Countess of the castle.  You'll going to have to see this movie to know more about her.  After viewing this movie I think I'm going to read the novel.",5,Finder's Keeper,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1622,"['pantheon', 'Great', 'War', 'movies', 'such', 'Patton', 'Hell', 'Are', 'Heroes', 'Sand', 'Pebble', 'rank', 'Castle', 'Keep', 'right', 'Castle', 'Keep', 'sense', 'Look', 'out', 'folks', 'uncommon', 'rabbit', 'hole', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'WWII', 'war', 'movie', 'narrator', 'movies', 'Eight', 'walking', 'wounded', 'chanced', 'castle', 'premise', 'uncommon', 'art', 'history', 'vs.', 'theory', 'practice', 'Who', 'will', 'be', 'victor', 'Can', 'there', 'be', 'victory', 'Almost', 'immediately', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'bombing', 'Dresden', 'metaphor', 'carry', 'weight', 'film', 'not', 'still', 'weighty', 'film', 'film', 'misfits', 'baker', 'dozen', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'make-shift', 'prophets', 'buffalo', 'riding', 'horse', 'catching', 'breath', 'Red', 'Queen', 'whores', 'weary', 'soldiers', 'suddenly', 'find', 'world', 'shell', 'shock', 'storybook', 'fantasy', 'business', 'killing', 'persists', 'Germen', 'reaching', 'breaching', 'walls', 'Castle', 'Keep', 'man', 'connoisseur', 'battle', 'players', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'lose', 'regardless', 'outcome', 'motive', 'one', 'soldiers', 'writer', 'lowly', 'trooper', 'top', 'major', 'request', 'one', 'thing', 'write', 'truth', 'When', 'ashes', 'war', 'storyteller', 'always', 'rise', 'storytellers', 'are', 'war', 'stories', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Countess', 'castle', ""'ll"", 'going', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'know', 'more', 'viewing', 'movie', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'read', 'novel']",Castle Keep VHS

Some of the dialogue is outright funny and also ironic, but the movie is not played strictly for laughs. Indeed, the ending is both bleak and disheartening, but the action is relentless, uncompromising, and very violent.I thought about the movie after it had ended, and wanted to watch it again. This is a movie that bears repeat viewings. Taken in its context of being released in 1969, the parallels to the futility of the Vietnam War are unmistakeable. As powerful an anti-war movie as PATHS OF GLORY and GO TELL THE SPARTANS (also starring Burt Lancaster...where's the DVD?), it is also a compelling adventure story filled with great perfomances (Burt Lancaster, Patrick O'Neal, and especially Peter Falk as a sergeant turned... baker!) and witty black humor tinged with non-sequitors and one-liners.A must for war movie buffs, fans of Sydney Pollack, Burt Lancaster and Peter Falk, and lovers of over-the-top action/adventure.

424125,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,6304460260,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[2, 2]","""We don't believe in fighting,"" a soldier tells Peter Falk's character in the middle of the night on an otherwise quiet street.  ""Oh,"" Falk responds, ""who believes in fighting?""  The soldier, who a moment before had been leading a handful of soldiers singing for redemption, responds that ""We believe in God.  That frightens you doesn't it?  All you believe in is fornication and killing.  We're conscientious objectors,"" the soldier (played by Bruce Dern) tells Falk, in conclusion.  Patrick O'Neil's character is an objector in a way too.  He plays a ""famed art historian"" turned fighting subordinate who tries to persuade Burt Lancaster to abandon the castle they are holed up in rather than see it destroyed should they try to hold it against advancing Germans.  He tells Lancaster, his one-eyed commander (a man who apparently can't see the forest for the trees, or so it seems to be suggested) that ""If something isn't saved, what's it all for?""  Lancaster, whose name herein is Falconer, continuing on this theme,  objects by saying that ""You can't save anything by giving it to the Germans.  If you give them anything you have to give them everything.""All this, mind you, takes place in Belgium at ""a tenth century castle in a twentieth century war,"" as the film trailer states.  The characters herein likewise are rather oddly situated.  We have the art historian in a historic castle filled to the rafters with priceless art; the one-eyed commander determined to hold the fort, as they say; a preacher (not the singing guy above who was from another unit), who berates a German tank with words until it is simply too close not to be fired upon; a would-be writer who is trying to absorb all that is happening around him; a cowboy of sorts, who takes a liking to a Volkswagon Beetle Bug car and spends an inordinate amount of his free time polishing it and driving it in circles in front of the castle; and we have Peter Falk's character, a baker turned soldier---the most alive character in the film, the most watchable actor herein---who, almost just to make him as odd as some of the others, winds up helping the local baker's wife (whose husband is presumably dead) literally make bread.  Falk:  ""I've got no place to go, no place to retreat to.""  The words could just have easily been spoken by Lancaster's character, of course.  Hence the latter's determination to stand his ground.  Is this a wonderful picture?  That should be easy enough for you to answer from just this sketch I've provided you with, but as you can project a bit of your own thinking into this film,  you can argue (as others have here) that this film has more depth than one might at first glance see.  That depends more on you than anything else, of course, so I'll leave it at that and give Castle Keep a rather neutral three stars and leave it to you to decide whether to have a gander at this film.

He was far too good a director to have turned out such a turkey in his mature days. If there is any kind of political message (Pollack's specialty) here it is well hidden beneath the literary veneer. That veneer is the death of the movie since it motivates much of the inane dialogue. The very important problem faced in every war we (and other liberal democratic nations) have fought is the extent to which, morally, we can sacrifice irreplaceable cultural monuments to achieving military objectives while limiting the number of dead and injured soldiers (and, sometimes, civilians). The question is raised in the film but buried in the detritus of a misguided film and its all-too-literary dialog.Burt Lancaster comes closest to salvaging a role from the chit-chat more fitting to amateur night at a Village coffee-house of the period. I suppose he drew on his many fine performances to bring some air of authority  to his part. None of the others had that good luck, with even Peter Falk too handicapped to make any sense out of his role. Oh, yes, there is an attractive young woman who has the good fortune to be relieved of all acting chores while looking good.For my part this has no more to do with World War 2 than  it has to do with the Korean or Vietnamese Wars (or the American Revolution or Civil War). I do understand that it is sufficiently meaningless to allow almost anything to be read into it. My advice would be to watch it only as an historian of the American Cinema or a student of the post-war (WW2)films about the war. Secondarily, it can be watched as a lesson in how a fine actor survives while all about him are biting the dust. Posthumous sympathy can be offered to Sidney Pollock for having to do this film in order to be given the chance at the outstanding career he had in front of him.v",3,Burt Lancaster and a Lost Squad,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1925,"['had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'seeing', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'was', 'filmed', 'so', 'early', 'Sidney', 'Pollock', 'career', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'good', 'director', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'such', 'turkey', 'mature', 'days', 'kind', 'political', 'message', 'Pollack', 'specialty', 'here', 'well', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'literary', 'veneer', 'veneer', 'death', 'movie', 'much', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'very', 'important', 'problem', 'faced', 'war', 'other', 'liberal', 'democratic', 'nations', 'have', 'fought', 'extent', 'morally', 'can', 'sacrifice', 'irreplaceable', 'cultural', 'monuments', 'achieving', 'military', 'objectives', 'limiting', 'number', 'dead', 'injured', 'soldiers', 'sometimes', 'civilians', 'question', 'raised', 'film', 'buried', 'detritus', 'misguided', 'film', 'all-too-literary', 'dialog.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'closest', 'salvaging', 'role', 'chit-chat', 'more', 'fitting', 'amateur', 'night', 'Village', 'coffee-house', 'period', 'suppose', 'drew', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'bring', 'air', 'authority', 'part', 'None', 'others', 'had', 'good', 'luck', 'even', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'too', 'handicapped', 'make', 'sense', 'role', 'Oh', 'yes', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'good', 'fortune', 'be', 'relieved', 'acting', 'chores', 'looking', 'good.For', 'part', 'more', 'do', 'World', 'War', '2', 'do', 'Korean', 'Vietnamese', 'Wars', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Civil', 'War', 'do', 'understand', 'sufficiently', 'meaningless', 'allow', 'almost', 'anything', 'be', 'read', 'My', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'only', 'historian', 'American', 'Cinema', 'student', 'post-war', 'WW2', 'films', 'war', 'Secondarily', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'lesson', 'how', 'fine', 'actor', 'survives', 'are', 'biting', 'dust', 'Posthumous', 'sympathy', 'can', 'be', 'offered', 'Sidney', 'Pollock', 'having', 'do', 'film', 'order', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'outstanding', 'career', 'had', 'front', 'him.v']",Castle Keep VHS

The film hosts quite an impressive cast attached to a very strange story.CASTLE KEEP opens as two jeep-loads of Army rejects billet themselves in a castle. The lord of the castle is willing to pander to any army as long as his castle survives unscathed. Unfortunately the Germans are about to launch their 1944 Ardennes Offensive and the castle is smack in the path of the Nazi advance.If the German attack was the only problem then there would not be much of a story. To complicate matters the lady of the castle picks Burt Lancaster's character to father a successor to the ownership of the castle, Peter Falk wanders into town to become a baker, a soldier falls in love with an abandoned Volkswagen, and Bruce Dern leads an oddball assortment of deserters on a holy crusade. Additionally, the soundtrack is a bit out of place and sounds very similar to that of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.The final German Siege of the castle almost makes up for the surreal first two thirds of the film.

424140,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6304460260,Robert Morris,"[25, 29]","As I saw this film and  Midnight Clear again recently, I thought about Stanley Weintraub's book Silent Night in which he discusses a brief period prior to Christmas in 1914, on the battlefields of Flanders, when German and British soldiers spontaneously agreed to declare a truce and suspend fighting, thereby defying their commanding officers. Centuries ago, knights and their attendants would work with their enemies to clear a field for combat the next day. Such cooperation had an obvious practical value. That's not what interests Weintraub as he examines a temporary truce during one of the bloodiest wars ever fought. It had little (if any) practical or tactical value but it did (and does) suggest a human need which transcends military obligations. However, war is war. After a brief respite, the carnage inevitably resumes.Directed by Sydney Pollack and based on William Eastlake's novel, it stars Burt Lancaster (Major Abraham Falconer), Patrick O'Neal (as Captain Lionel Beckman), and Peter Falk (as Sergeant Orlando Rossi). They and their five associates are in Belgium during the winter of 1944 when they seek some R&amp;R in the 10th century castle of Count Henri Tixier and his wife, Countess Therese. The Count is impotent and desperate for his wife to produce a male heir. Falconer is an obvious candidate to help the Count achieve his objective. Meanwhile, the war in Europe continues, of course, but the castle keeps them safe from its dangers and deprivations.While seeing this film the first time and then again recently, I felt as if I were dreaming that I had returned to the 1940s in a time machine, to Belgium near the end of World War Two. Credit Henri Decae's cinematography with creating an uncommonly beautiful setting within which savage combat eventually occurs, reminiscent of John Mathieson's visually stunning camera work during the ""Hell Unleashed"" sequence early in Gladiator. This is a haunting film, at times an exquisitely lovely film. Certain scenes caused me to think that I was hallucinating.It now occurs to me that perhaps (just perhaps) Castle Keep portrays a group of men at war, not as they really were nor as war really was at a given time but as those men would remember it decades later, had all of them survived and eventually shared their memories of the castle and surrounding area. That is about as close as I have come (thus far) to understanding certain surrealistic moments in the film. Castle Keep deserves more attention than it has received.Hopefully it will soon be available in DVD format, accompanied by special features will include as much discussion of it as is already available or can be generated. I fondly recall the ""Movies in Time"" series on the History cable television channel, hosted by Sander Vanocur, which featured films such as Saving Private Ryan. Before, during, and then following each screening, Vanocur and his guests would discuss the film. How much I wish there were a recorded interview out there, somewhere, during which Pollack, Decae, Lancaster, Falk, and others associated with Castle Keep share their thoughts and feelings about its meaning and significance.",5,The Multiple Realities of War,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,3151,"['saw', 'film', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'again', 'recently', 'thought', 'about', 'Stanley', 'Weintraub', 'book', 'Silent', 'Night', 'brief', 'period', 'prior', 'Christmas', '1914', 'battlefields', 'Flanders', 'when', 'German', 'British', 'soldiers', 'spontaneously', 'agreed', 'declare', 'truce', 'suspend', 'fighting', 'thereby', 'defying', 'commanding', 'officers', 'Centuries', 'ago', 'knights', 'attendants', 'would', 'work', 'enemies', 'clear', 'field', 'combat', 'next', 'day', 'Such', 'cooperation', 'had', 'obvious', 'practical', 'value', 'not', 'what', 'interests', 'Weintraub', 'temporary', 'truce', 'one', 'bloodiest', 'wars', 'ever', 'fought', 'had', 'little', 'practical', 'tactical', 'value', 'did', 'suggest', 'human', 'need', 'military', 'obligations', 'However', 'war', 'war', 'brief', 'respite', 'carnage', 'inevitably', 'resumes.Directed', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'based', 'William', 'Eastlake', 'novel', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Major', 'Abraham', 'Falconer', 'Patrick', ""O'Neal"", 'Captain', 'Lionel', 'Beckman', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Sergeant', 'Orlando', 'Rossi', 'five', 'associates', 'are', 'Belgium', 'winter', '1944', 'when', 'seek', 'R', 'amp', 'R', '10th', 'century', 'castle', 'Count', 'Henri', 'Tixier', 'wife', 'Countess', 'Therese', 'Count', 'impotent', 'desperate', 'wife', 'produce', 'male', 'heir', 'Falconer', 'obvious', 'candidate', 'help', 'Count', 'achieve', 'objective', 'Meanwhile', 'war', 'Europe', 'course', 'castle', 'safe', 'dangers', 'deprivations.While', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'again', 'recently', 'felt', 'were', 'dreaming', 'had', 'returned', '1940s', 'time', 'machine', 'Belgium', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'Credit', 'Henri', 'Decae', 'cinematography', 'creating', 'uncommonly', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'savage', 'combat', 'eventually', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Mathieson', 'visually', 'stunning', 'camera', 'work', 'Hell', 'Unleashed', 'sequence', 'early', 'Gladiator', 'haunting', 'film', 'times', 'exquisitely', 'lovely', 'film', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'caused', 'think', 'was', 'hallucinating.It', 'now', 'perhaps', 'just', 'perhaps', 'Castle', 'Keep', 'group', 'men', 'war', 'not', 'really', 'were', 'war', 'really', 'was', 'given', 'time', 'men', 'would', 'remember', 'later', 'had', 'survived', 'eventually', 'shared', 'memories', 'castle', 'surrounding', 'area', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'have', 'come', 'thus', 'far', 'understanding', 'certain', 'surrealistic', 'moments', 'film', 'Castle', 'Keep', 'more', 'attention', 'received.Hopefully', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'format', 'accompanied', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'include', 'much', 'discussion', 'already', 'available', 'can', 'be', 'generated', 'fondly', 'recall', 'Movies', 'Time', 'series', 'History', 'cable', 'television', 'channel', 'hosted', 'Sander', 'Vanocur', 'featured', 'films', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'then', 'following', 'screening', 'Vanocur', 'guests', 'would', 'discuss', 'film', 'How', 'much', 'wish', 'were', 'recorded', 'interview', 'there', 'somewhere', 'Pollack', 'Decae', 'Lancaster', 'Falk', 'others', 'associated', 'Castle', 'Keep', 'share', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'meaning', 'significance']",Castle Keep VHS

A group of American soldiers, led by eye patched Major Abraham Falconer (Burt Lancaster) decamp in a medieval castle that stands between the advancing Germans and Bastogne. The castle is the residence of the Count of Malorais and Therese, a winsome lass with a wandering eye, and contains a Louvre's worth of art.Having established a promising plot the movie promptly abandons it and spends nine-tenths of its remaining time standing around talking.  Oh, Major Burt makes a heavy move on Therese, Captain Patrick O'Neal moons over the art, the enlisted men spend some time in a cat house in town and, inexplicably, Sergeant Peter Falk takes up residence with a widowed baker's wife.  And wild-eyed Bruce Dern, with choir, pops into the movie every now and then as a hymn singing conscientious objector.  But most of the time it's just tedious, pretentious, impenetrable talk.  For instance, at one point Therese and the Count share this exchange - ""They planned this war because there was something they hadn't yet smashed."" ""Who are we, Henri?""

424146,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6304460260,T O'Brien,"[17, 21]","Castle Keep is a very good war movie with an excellent storyline that is a little different from other war movies.  The story takes place in the Ardennes during WWII in the Battle of the Bulge.  Eight walking wounded misfit Americans discover a castle whose count offers to let them stay there.  The Americans must decide whether to stay and delay the Germans at the risk of destroying the beauty of the castle or just turning around and running for their own lines.This movie boasts an excellent cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Peter Falk, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Tony Bill, Patrick O'Neal, and Bruce Dern.  Lancaster gives another great performance as Major Falconer, the leader of the group.  O'Neal is also very good as Captain Beckman, an art historian who wants to abandon the castle so it won't be destroyed by the advancing Germans.  Another interesting performance is by Peter Falk as Sergeant Rossi, who disappears into the nearby town and becomes their baker.  This movie has some anti-war messages, but at other times it is very funny.  I hadn't heard of this movie before I saw it on TV, but it is very good.  Well developed characters, good action, some humor, and an interesting if sometime out of place musical score.

How can it tank (pun intended) with the likes of Burt Lancaster, Peter Falk, Patrick O'Neal and Jean-Pierre Aumont?  This is a war movie that can't decide whether it's coming or going. The plot - if it even exists - asks more questions than it can answer.  If you are one of those war buffs, you will get enough to whet your appetite. There are explosive firefights and a little humor on the side with the fire-bombing whores and a band of anti-war (""we're conscientious objectors - we don't believe in fighting"") led by the irrepressible Bruce Dern.

424150,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6304460260,William Timothy Lukeman,"[7, 9]","If you're expecting a traditional WWII action film, you may well be puzzled or put off by this film, which completely upends the idea of traditional heroism ... yet without disparaging it, either, which is no mean feat. Clearly an allegorical, symbolic film that speaks to Vietnam as much as to WWII, deliberately & gleefully anachronistic, it remains timely to this day. As long as there are wars, the absurdity, black humor, destruction & loss depicted here will remain relevant. In a way, it revises a notable statement from Vietnam & asks, ""Will it become necessary to destroy civilization in order to save it?""It's a visually stunning film, thankfully released in widescreen at last, which it needs & deserves. There's a fairy tale quality to many of the shots, accentuated by the then-contemporary pop music soundtrack by Michel Legrand, very Swingle Singers at times, always haunting. Yet other scenes have a bold, garishly surreal quality to them. And the battle scenes are brutally realistic & bloody, a harsh & effective counterpoint to the earlier fairy tale quality.The ensemble cast is wonderful, with Burt Lancaster rightfully leading the pack. He's a stolid, realistic, undeniably brave man -- and short-sighted for that very reason, seeing only the mission, willing to sacrifice everything to fulfill it. Yet what other sort of man would be able to go on fighting an implacable enemy? That's one of the things I especially like about this film: it asks difficult questions & doesn't take the easy way out by unfairly demonizing one viewpoint.The rest of the cast is equally good, from Al Freeman's Ishmael-like novelist (""And I alone am escaped to tell thee""), to Patrick O'Neal's tortured, sensitive art historian, so desperate to preserve the endangered beauties of the castle, to Peter Falk's earthy sergeant, who would rather bake bread (the staff of life) rather than bring more death to the world. Yet in the end, death will inevitably overtake all but one of them.The script is a writer's delight, filled with dark jokes, poignant reveries, wicked one-liners. It's a literate script, from a more literate time, and well worth hearing more than once. Again, this is a film that's meant to be fully experienced in the viewing & then thought about & discussed at length afterwards.

424151,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6304460260,Wuchak,"[3, 4]","Two World War II flicks involving a European castle came out in 1968, ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Castle Keep."" If you're a fan of war films you've no doubt heard of ""Where Eagles Dare,"" which is one of the greatest war action/adventure films ever made; but I wouldn't be too surprised if you've never heard of ""Castle Keep"" or only vaguely heard of it. There's good reason for this.THE PLOT: The Germans are marching on a Belgium village in the Ardennes where a small group of American soldiers make a stand at a 10th century castle.""Castle Keep"" has a lot going for it: a great cast, including Burt Lancaster, Peter Falk, Bruce Dern & many more; fabulous Yugoslavian Winter locations & castle; thrilling action scenes; it's well-made on a technical level; and it hardly comes across dated at all, even though it's forty years old. Fans of the film describe it as ""poetic"" & ""haunting""  and it's certainly obvious the filmmakers were shooting for something groundbreaking, meaningful and artistic.Unfortunately ""Castle Keep"" failed to grab my attention until well into the second half of its 1 hour & 45 minute runtime, which is when the great action scenes start. The characters have a lot of dialogue but you never get to know them or care about them. Maybe because the chatter comes off as unreal, artsy and inscutable. Want a sample? The Count of the castle comments to Theresa (who is his wife, I think), ""They planned this war because there was something they hadn't yet smashed."" She replies, ""Who are we, Henri?"" ""We are the keepers."" [Thanks to Amazon reviewer Steven Hellerstedt for citing this dialogue].The script is full of such ""deep"" nonsense. Which I suppose would be okay as long as the story itself pulled me in, but it didn't. The story doesn't perk up and grab the viewer's attention until the Germans march on the village well past the hour mark.Want another example of the film's ""unreal"" vibe? The soldiers go into town to kill time at the local whore house. When they enter all the prostitutes are standing or lying around in various tantalizing poses in lingerie. I'm sure they were just hanging around like that waiting for five soldiers to walk in -- WHY SURE! You gotta see it to believe it. I busted out laughing!One reviewer offered the interpretation that one soldier, the writer, is simply remembering how it was, not how it really was, and that's why it comes across so dreamlike, bizarre and unreal. I find this a valid explanation. Others point out that it's an allegory about the futility of the Vietnam War which was going on at the time of release. Another interpretation is that the message is one of contrast: Life from death, and death where once life was (Huh?).Hey, I'm all for ""message"" films with deeper meanings, that is, as long as the film itself is interesting; the original ""Apocalypse Now"" is a good example. The greatest sin in filmmaking is to be boring. The second is to be pretentious. Unfortunately ""Castle Keep"" commits both of these transgressions IMHO.BOTTOM LINE: ""Castle Keep"" is an avant-garde film palatable to a chosen few. It's either groundbreaking or pretentious depending on your tastes. I certainly respect it and enjoy numerous aspects noted above, but personally deem it a failure. Still, I'm an open-minded person. Maybe next time I'll ""get it.""If my words intrigue you, check it out. I strangely found it worth viewing (and owning) even though I currently don't like it.
