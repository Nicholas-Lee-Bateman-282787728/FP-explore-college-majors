920933,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000A3XY8C,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","If you're looking for a workout that is going to focus on pounding your abs into fantastic shape every second of the workout, then this is not for you.  ""Crunch Fat Burning Ab Attack"" is a casual, laid-back approach to working your abs while also burning calories at the same time.  Coming in at about only 30 minutes, it's not the longest workout on the market nor is it the most intense.  It is, however, an enjoyable way to spend an ""off"" day when you still want to work your core a bit.It all starts with a warm-up which is almost like a dance routine.  It has step touches, hamstring curls, V steps, and mambos.  It simply starts to slightly raise the heart rate and get the blood flowing.  Some quick stretches follow.  It takes about 6 minutes to complete.Standing abs is next; there are two sections of this portion of the DVD.  Each section has about 4 moves: 2 for lower body and 2 for abs.  Your heart rate will still be barely elevated because there is a lot of squatting and some quick leg lifts.  Usually, Cat Chiarelli (the instructor) will teach you a slow oblique move such as a standing oblique crunch.  You'll do that move 8-16 times slowly, do something like 8 fast squats, then do the same slow oblique move on the other side of your body.  Eventually, the tempo will be picked up, you will do it quickly a few times, and then move onto another exercise.  At the end of each section, you put all moves together into a combo.  I didn't find any of the standing abs moves to be tough on the abs; it more worked my thighs and butt with all of the squats.  However, my heart rate was up a bit, and I did enjoy it.  It all lasts a little bit less than 15 minutes.Floor abs are the follow-up to standing abs, and they are more traditional in that you are doing familiar crunches and planks.  There are some different crunch variations, though, so you won't get bored.  I'm used to difficult ab workouts, and this did burn a bit...never so much that I had to take a break, but it did seem quite effective.  I really liked this (approximately) 10 minute section and will probably add it (and only it) as a supplement to other workouts that I do.A quick 2 minute cool down finishes off the workout.Cat is a pleasant instructor.  She comes across as a bit cheesy, constantly asking if you're ""cool.""  However, she really is fantastic about making sure your form is good.  Another helpful thing that she does is give you metaphors for some of the exercises.  For instance, in the crunches you're supposed to imagine an orange between your chin and chest.  In one of the standing exercise, visualize a ballerina's posture.I've seen better standing ab workouts (Jennifer Galardi's Standing Abs on exercisetv), but I understand that Cat was trying to use this section to focus on cardio more than abs.  It's very light, though, so it's best for a beginner.  The floor abs was very effective for me, although it could have been a bit longer.  Overall, I recommend this DVD as a very light workout for your days ""off.""  It's also really good for beginners who are easing into fitness.",4,Decent short ab workout,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,3089,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'workout', 'going', 'focus', 'pounding', 'abs', 'fantastic', 'shape', 'second', 'workout', 'then', 'not', 'Crunch', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Ab', 'Attack', 'casual', 'laid-back', 'approach', 'working', 'abs', 'also', 'burning', 'calories', 'same', 'time', 'Coming', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'not', 'longest', 'workout', 'market', 'most', 'intense', 'however', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'off', 'day', 'when', 'still', 'want', 'work', 'core', 'bit.It', 'warm-up', 'almost', 'dance', 'routine', 'step', 'touches', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'V', 'steps', 'mambos', 'simply', 'slightly', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'get', 'blood', 'flowing', 'quick', 'stretches', 'follow', '6', 'minutes', 'complete.Standing', 'abs', 'next', 'are', 'two', 'sections', 'portion', 'DVD', 'section', 'about', '4', 'moves', '2', 'lower', 'body', '2', 'abs', 'heart', 'rate', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'barely', 'elevated', 'lot', 'squatting', 'quick', 'leg', 'lifts', 'Usually', 'Cat', 'Chiarelli', 'instructor', 'will', 'teach', 'slow', 'oblique', 'move', 'such', 'standing', 'oblique', 'crunch', ""'ll"", 'do', 'move', '8-16', 'times', 'slowly', 'do', 'something', '8', 'fast', 'squats', 'then', 'do', 'same', 'slow', 'oblique', 'move', 'other', 'side', 'body', 'Eventually', 'tempo', 'will', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'will', 'do', 'quickly', 'few', 'times', 'then', 'move', 'exercise', 'end', 'section', 'put', 'moves', 'together', 'combo', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'standing', 'abs', 'moves', 'be', 'tough', 'abs', 'more', 'worked', 'thighs', 'butt', 'squats', 'However', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'up', 'bit', 'did', 'enjoy', 'little', 'bit', 'less', '15', 'minutes.Floor', 'abs', 'are', 'follow-up', 'standing', 'abs', 'are', 'more', 'traditional', 'are', 'doing', 'familiar', 'crunches', 'planks', 'are', 'different', 'crunch', 'variations', 'though', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', ""'m"", 'used', 'difficult', 'ab', 'workouts', 'did', 'burn', 'bit', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'take', 'break', 'did', 'seem', 'quite', 'effective', 'really', 'liked', 'approximately', '10', 'minute', 'section', 'will', 'probably', 'add', 'only', 'supplement', 'other', 'workouts', 'do.A', 'quick', '2', 'minute', 'cool', 'down', 'finishes', 'workout.Cat', 'pleasant', 'instructor', 'across', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'constantly', 'asking', ""'re"", 'cool', 'However', 'really', 'fantastic', 'making', 'sure', 'form', 'good', 'helpful', 'thing', 'give', 'metaphors', 'exercises', 'instance', 'crunches', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'imagine', 'orange', 'chin', 'chest', 'one', 'standing', 'exercise', 'visualize', 'ballerina', 'posture.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'standing', 'ab', 'workouts', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'Standing', 'Abs', 'exercisetv', 'understand', 'Cat', 'was', 'trying', 'use', 'section', 'focus', 'cardio', 'more', 'abs', 'very', 'light', 'though', 'best', 'beginner', 'floor', 'abs', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'longer', 'Overall', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'very', 'light', 'workout', 'days', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'beginners', 'who', 'are', 'easing', 'fitness']",Crunch: Fat Burning Ab Attack

Some movements you can follow through on much more than the instructor does (what she calls ""lunges"", for example, look more like one is just swaying to and fro) to increase range of motion and get more of a workout.The standing work does have a lot of squats which might be an issue for those with bad knees, and the instructor uses a lot of fast repetitions on balance moves where slower moves would give you a more difficult workout in the same amount of time. Luckily, she ""stops"" to cue the next moves several times while marching in place, so even if you decide to perform the moves more slowly, you'll still be able to catch up to the next sequence.The mat work is basic, but on the short side.

920953,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B000A3XY8C,Sheri in Reho,"[57, 62]","Instructor Catherine Chiarelli takes you through a warm-up, a standing cardio workout and a mat ab workout that felt to me, in places, like Tae-bo Lite.  Not that it was like Tae-bo in that it features kickboxing, but in the moves she uses to work the abs from a standing position, several of which Tae-bo fans will recognize.  Following is a glimpse of each segment:Warm-Up:  A standard, relatively easy-to-follow cardio warm-up featuring marching in place, step-touch to the side, kickback, V-step, mambo and stretches.  The only thing I found awkward was the mambo step.  I've done a mambo step in several other workouts and always found it one of my favorites...until now.Standing Ab Work:  Cat focuses on abs at a moderate cardio pace with squats, oblique twists, plies, boxer twists, side lunges, standing side crunches, and upper body twists.  If you've done Tae-bo, you will recognize several of these moves.  Like Tae-bo, you need excellent balance for this.  The intensity was enough to get my breathing elevated and I did sweat some, but not as much as I usually would during a cardio workout.  I really didn't feel my abs being worked as much as I would expect in an ab-focused workout.  I've only done this workout twice so far, but I am not sold on the benefits of this segment.Mat Ab Work:  Down on the floor, you'll do several variations of crunches, side planks, oblique work, Superman variations, and stretches.  It's a silly thing, I suppose, but I really didn't like doing mat work after I'm sweaty from doing a cardio workout (even though I wasn't AS sweaty from this as I would be from, say, Tae-bo).  The repetitions here are higher than other ab workouts I've done and, as a result, I found this section tough.  I could do the various crunches for 8 or 10 reps but she does 15 reps and I couldn't ""hang in there"" for the last several reps of each crunch.  This was especially true because she does a LOT of crunches with the legs in the air, one right after the other, so you're not getting any opportunity to rest.All in all, certainly not a BAD workout, but not real high on my list of recommends either.  It felt inconsistent because the standing section was easier than expected and the mat section was harder than expected...so it's hard to know who to recommend this workout to.  The people who could handle the tough mat section would find the standing section too easy and the people who would find the standing section just right would find the mat section too hard.",3,"Good ab workout, but sort of a dancey Tae-Bo Lite",1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,2499,"['Instructor', 'Catherine', 'Chiarelli', 'warm-up', 'standing', 'cardio', 'workout', 'mat', 'ab', 'felt', 'places', 'Tae-bo', 'Lite', 'Not', 'was', 'Tae-bo', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'work', 'abs', 'standing', 'position', 'several', 'Tae-bo', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Following', 'glimpse', 'segment', 'Warm-Up', 'standard', 'relatively', 'easy-to-follow', 'cardio', 'warm-up', 'featuring', 'marching', 'place', 'step-touch', 'side', 'kickback', 'V-step', 'mambo', 'stretches', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'awkward', 'was', 'mambo', 'step', ""'ve"", 'done', 'mambo', 'step', 'several', 'other', 'workouts', 'always', 'found', 'one', 'favorites', 'now.Standing', 'Ab', 'Work', 'Cat', 'focuses', 'abs', 'moderate', 'cardio', 'pace', 'squats', 'oblique', 'twists', 'plies', 'boxer', 'twists', 'side', 'lunges', 'standing', 'side', 'crunches', 'upper', 'body', 'twists', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Tae-bo', 'will', 'recognize', 'several', 'moves', 'Tae-bo', 'need', 'excellent', 'balance', 'intensity', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'breathing', 'elevated', 'did', 'sweat', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'usually', 'would', 'cardio', 'workout', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'abs', 'being', 'worked', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'expect', 'ab-focused', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'workout', 'twice', 'so', 'far', 'am', 'not', 'sold', 'benefits', 'segment.Mat', 'Ab', 'Work', 'Down', 'floor', ""'ll"", 'do', 'several', 'variations', 'crunches', 'side', 'planks', 'oblique', 'work', 'Superman', 'variations', 'stretches', 'silly', 'thing', 'suppose', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'doing', 'mat', 'work', ""'m"", 'sweaty', 'doing', 'cardio', 'workout', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'AS', 'sweaty', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'Tae-bo', 'repetitions', 'here', 'are', 'higher', 'other', 'ab', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'done', 'result', 'found', 'section', 'tough', 'could', 'do', 'various', 'crunches', '8', '10', 'reps', '15', 'reps', 'could', ""n't"", 'hang', 'there', 'last', 'several', 'reps', 'crunch', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'LOT', 'crunches', 'legs', 'air', 'one', 'right', 'other', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'opportunity', 'rest.All', 'certainly', 'not', 'BAD', 'workout', 'not', 'real', 'high', 'list', 'recommends', 'felt', 'inconsistent', 'standing', 'section', 'was', 'easier', 'expected', 'mat', 'section', 'was', 'harder', 'expected', 'hard', 'know', 'who', 'recommend', 'workout', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'handle', 'tough', 'mat', 'section', 'would', 'find', 'standing', 'section', 'too', 'easy', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'find', 'standing', 'section', 'just', 'right', 'would', 'find', 'mat', 'section', 'too', 'hard']",Crunch: Fat Burning Ab Attack

Catherine Chiarelli leads this 30 minute routine and is joined by several other ladies and one man.  You start with a simple warmup consisting of marches, step touches, hamstring curls, v-steps and mambos, then you stretch briefly.You start with standing work and I agree with the reviewer who called some of these moves ""Tae Bo Lite"".  The moves seen here include torso twists, boxer twists, standing oblique crunches, and clock twists.  The boxer and clock twists are done while in a plie squat position, after a while I could feel my legs working pretty hard, but this section didn't do much for my abs, though I liked the moves in general.  Lots of squats and side lunges are inserted in between some of the ab work so it breaks it up a little bit.The floor work I felt more than the standing, but it was still pretty easy.  Here you will see traditional crunches, one set of them with legs in the air at a 90 degree angle, oblique twists, double crunches, leg sweeps, side planks with knees bent, lying side oblique crunches and Supermans.Catherine does an okay job leading the workout, she does offer some pointers and tips throughout, as well as reminding you to breathe.  She is in fantastic shape herself, though I don't know if she got those abs doing this workout.  The routine itself was unique and interesting, especially the standing work but it wasn't working for me.  Anyone whose abs are in decent condition will not be challenged by this workout.

Cat is a nice instructor, sweet without being overwhelming, but don't expect cueing of any kind. I was wondering if this lack of cues was the reason for me not exactly feeling the work in my abs in the approximately 15 minutes of standing work; I was doing some sweating all right, and I did feel my thighs working, but as far as my abs go, nothing really felt there.
