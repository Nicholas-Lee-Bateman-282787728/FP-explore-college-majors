It's silent and from a different era, so some of the story elements are portrayed with a heavy hand, but the visuals remain powerful and unique.  The director draws characters just from their faces, and powerful action simply from standing still.  The plot is linear enough for this kind of art- if you like powerful artistic expression, you'll like this film.",5,Still tremendously powerful after 80 years,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,400,"['film', 'remarkable', 'enjoyable', 'silent', 'different', 'era', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'portrayed', 'heavy', 'hand', 'visuals', 'remain', 'powerful', 'unique', 'director', 'characters', 'just', 'powerful', 'action', 'simply', 'standing', 'still', 'plot', 'linear', 'enough', 'kind', 'art-', 'like', 'powerful', 'artistic', 'expression', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film']",Arsenal

Its silent, from the USSR in the late 20's, B+W, with odd imagery and very surreal. It was supposed to be a soviet propaganda film, but I would say its more a kind of film noire art film. Stark and tragic from a stark and tragic era.Don't watch it if you are depressed or on drugs ! From the same era as &#34;Nostaferatu&#34;. Spooky.

731193,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B00007L4MH,Richard J. Brzostek,"[1, 2]","Alexander Dovzhenko brings us into a chaotic time in Ukrainian history with Arsenal -- a silent Russian movie made in 1928.  The action takes place at the end of World War I and the several subsequent wars that shortly followed it.  Albeit a silent movie, it takes on balancing the story of several people and their emotions, as well as expressing these things in an artistic way.  Not everything is expressed in the dialogue text, so seeing the meaning of various actions and symbolism helps one appreciate the many memorable scenes of this film.Knowing about the history of this time is helpful, but not essential (although it will probably take watching it at least twice to take it all in).  This period was a confusing time in Ukraine, but the various groups can be distinguished by their clothing.  As simple as it may be, their clothing are a giveaway of who they support.  There is a group that resurrected 17th century fashions wearing zupons -- but instead of matchlock pistols they have revolvers.  And probably as polar opposite to that are the Bolsheviks, who are ultimately portrayed as the ""heroes"" of the film.  The main characters are obviously all workers and revolutionaries as Dovzhenko himself was a Ukrainian but supported the Soviets.Ukrainian history is a bit confusing and complicated, especially at this time period.  It isn't simplified in this movie, but it also isn't made terribly complicated by mentioning too many names, dates and places.  The movie mentions there were four wars in four years, but doesn't get into any more details than that.  The bottom line is there were a number of groups within the country that supported various political ideas.  Although by no means did I think the whole film was propaganda, but a few parts are unmistakable for anything else.  All in all, the movie amazingly brings to life this time period, but as it was actually made not too long after the actual events took place, it is more powerful than if something along these lines were made today.",5,Dovzhenko brings us into a chaotic time in Ukrainian history,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,2017,"['Alexander', 'Dovzhenko', 'chaotic', 'time', 'Ukrainian', 'history', 'Arsenal', 'silent', 'Russian', 'movie', 'made', '1928', 'action', 'place', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'several', 'subsequent', 'wars', 'shortly', 'followed', 'silent', 'movie', 'balancing', 'story', 'several', 'people', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'expressing', 'things', 'artistic', 'way', 'Not', 'everything', 'expressed', 'dialogue', 'text', 'seeing', 'meaning', 'various', 'actions', 'symbolism', 'one', 'appreciate', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film.Knowing', 'history', 'time', 'helpful', 'not', 'essential', 'will', 'probably', 'take', 'watching', 'least', 'twice', 'take', 'period', 'was', 'confusing', 'time', 'Ukraine', 'various', 'groups', 'can', 'be', 'distinguished', 'clothing', 'As', 'simple', 'may', 'be', 'clothing', 'are', 'giveaway', 'who', 'support', 'group', 'resurrected', '17th', 'century', 'fashions', 'wearing', 'zupons', 'instead', 'matchlock', 'pistols', 'have', 'revolvers', 'probably', 'polar', 'opposite', 'are', 'Bolsheviks', 'who', 'are', 'ultimately', 'portrayed', 'heroes', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'obviously', 'workers', 'revolutionaries', 'Dovzhenko', 'was', 'Ukrainian', 'supported', 'Soviets.Ukrainian', 'history', 'bit', 'confusing', 'complicated', 'especially', 'time', 'period', ""n't"", 'simplified', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'made', 'terribly', 'complicated', 'mentioning', 'too', 'many', 'names', 'dates', 'places', 'movie', 'mentions', 'were', 'four', 'wars', 'four', 'years', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'details', 'bottom', 'line', 'were', 'number', 'groups', 'country', 'supported', 'various', 'political', 'ideas', 'means', 'did', 'think', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'propaganda', 'few', 'parts', 'are', 'unmistakable', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'life', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'actual', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'more', 'powerful', 'something', 'lines', 'were', 'made', 'today']",Arsenal
