361912,A1K3WK2QHB8397,6303187064,A Customer,"[4, 4]","First and foremost, I really enjoyed this film, as evidenced by the 5 stars I gave it.  However, there are some problems I had with the film and  the DVD release of it.  First of all, The Crow follows James O'Barr's  original story quite closely, with the addition of some characters such as  Top Dollar's sister the Asian mystic, and Top Dollar's assassin/bodyguard.  I found that the Asian mystic took away from the film.  She was added in in  order to play the role that the skeleton portrayed in the book, but her  feeble lines and lack of acting ability took away from this film for me.  I  also hold this film responsible for the unfortunate current trend in  selling a movie based on the soundtrack.  The soundtrack to The Crow was  well thought out, and utilized much of the music that James O'Barr listened  to while writing The Crow.  Irritatingly enough, Trent Reznor is featured  as well, covering a Joy Division song - the soundtrack should have just  featured Joy Division - but Reznor was flavor-of-the-month when this film  was released in '94 and his popularity sells records.  I was disappointed  to see James O'Barr take his creation and sell it off - The Crow was never  meant to move beyond the initial story, but O'Barr got greedy and now  there's a plethora of comics featuring the Crow, and even a complete  cheese-ball of a sequel that made me sick to watch (see my review of The  Crow: City of Angels).  There's even talk of a third movie, to further  disgrace Brandon Lee's memory and the reason for the writing of The Crow to  begin with.  A TV series cropped up a few years back that the Sci-Fi  Channel is running in syndication - it generally follows the ideals of the  film and I have found some of the episodes enjoyable to watch.  The DVD was  put together nicely (one review said the picture quality was too dark, but  the DVD has the same level of brightness as on VHS as well as when the film  was first on the silver screen).  I was really hoping for some extras: the  theatrical trailer, the interview snippet that was included on the  widescreen VHS, and the unreleased footage of Eric and the skeleton.  A  secondary audio-only track would have been nice, especially with all the  thought that went into both the score by Graeme Revell and the soundtrack.  But the most important part is the film itself, and that is reason enough  to purchase the DVD.  The Crow is an incredible film, and a fitting final  piece for Brandon Lee's talent.",5,A Fitting Final Piece,967939200,"09 3, 2000",2000,2479,"['First', 'foremost', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'evidenced', '5', 'stars', 'gave', 'However', 'are', 'problems', 'had', 'film', 'DVD', 'release', 'First', 'all', 'Crow', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'original', 'story', 'quite', 'closely', 'addition', 'characters', 'such', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'sister', 'Asian', 'mystic', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'assassin/bodyguard', 'found', 'Asian', 'mystic', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'added', 'order', 'play', 'role', 'skeleton', 'portrayed', 'book', 'feeble', 'lines', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'also', 'hold', 'film', 'responsible', 'unfortunate', 'current', 'trend', 'selling', 'movie', 'based', 'soundtrack', 'soundtrack', 'Crow', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'utilized', 'much', 'music', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'listened', 'writing', 'Crow', 'Irritatingly', 'enough', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'featured', 'as', 'well', 'covering', 'Joy', 'Division', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'featured', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Reznor', 'was', 'flavor-of-the-month', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', ""'94"", 'popularity', 'records', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'take', 'creation', 'sell', 'off', 'Crow', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'move', 'initial', 'story', ""O'Barr"", 'got', 'greedy', 'now', 'plethora', 'comics', 'featuring', 'Crow', 'even', 'complete', 'cheese-ball', 'sequel', 'made', 'sick', 'watch', 'see', 'review', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'even', 'talk', 'third', 'movie', 'further', 'disgrace', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'memory', 'reason', 'writing', 'Crow', 'begin', 'TV', 'series', 'cropped', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'running', 'syndication', 'generally', 'ideals', 'film', 'have', 'found', 'episodes', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'DVD', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'nicely', 'one', 'review', 'said', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'DVD', 'same', 'level', 'brightness', 'VHS', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'extras', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'interview', 'snippet', 'was', 'included', 'widescreen', 'VHS', 'unreleased', 'footage', 'Eric', 'skeleton', 'secondary', 'audio-only', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'especially', 'thought', 'went', 'score', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'reason', 'enough', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Crow', 'incredible', 'film', 'fitting', 'final', 'piece', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'talent']",N/A
361913,A2S166WSCFIFP5,6303187064,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[162, 168]","This DVD has it all, and is well worth the extra price. First of all there is a great movie. The Crow is a cult classic, but I don't mean to demean it at all by calling it one. Based on the comic book of the same name, The Crow has a great premise (a man comes back from the dead to avenge the death of the woman he loves) and is made well. It's a dark film made in muted, dark colors, almost black and white. The action sequences are great (after all, Brandon Lee is Bruce Lee's son). This would have been Brandon's break-out role if he hadn't died. It also has one of my favorite fight scenes, the shoot out at Top Dollar's. And Ernie Hudson is surprisingly good in his role in the film. And a great soundtrack.The DVD is loaded with extras. There is commentary by Jeff Most (producer and executive music producer of the Crow movies) and John Shirley (co-writer of The Crow). Their commentary is almost as good as the film. You get a lot of insight into the movie, how it was made, and why certain choices were made. This is what DVD commentaries should be like. (It is a shame that Brandon Lee was unable to do a commentary, it would have been very interesting to see what he had to say about the film). Most's commentary is very informative and very entertaining. My only fault with the commentary is that there wasn't much on Brandon's death. I really expected to hear more about it, since it is such a huge part of the mythos of the film. Also on disc one is the DVD-ROM extras. There is the script that you read the same time the film is playing. There is a trivia game (which really isn't that great and is about the entire Crow franchise and not just this movie). You can also watch the ""enhanced playback track"" which has trivia and other features as the film plays.In addition to the usual production stills, posters, and (five) story boards (one of those is the story board for the Shoot Out at Top Dollar's and it is very interesting to see), Disc 2 contains a Behind the Scenes featurette that runs about 15 minutes. It is not a making of, rather those involved with the movie (including Brandon Lee) discuss the movie and concept. There is a 30 minute Portrait of James O'Barr (creator of The Crow comic book) which is O'Barr in his basement talking to someone holding a video camcorder. You get a lot of insight into his life, his work, the movie, Hollywood, and where many of his ideas for The Crow came from.  There is something called the Deleted Footage Montage, but it really isn't deleted footage. There is some deleted footage in the montage, but most of it is outtakes, alternate takes, behind the scenes footage, and what looks like scenes that weren't deleted from the movie. It's a touching `tribute' to Brandon Lee, but not what it should have been. And finally there are three extended scenes (The Arcade Bombing; Fun Boy Fight; Shoot Out at Top Dollar's). What makes these so interesting is that you see what the original footage was and how they edited the scene to make it move so fast paced. You see the decision process in removing unessential footage to keep the movie from bogging down.So you have a great movie and some really good extras on this DVD. Definitely one that should be in your library.",5,This has it all,1018742400,"04 14, 2002",2002,3235,"['DVD', 'well', 'extra', 'price', 'First', 'great', 'movie', 'Crow', 'cult', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'demean', 'calling', 'one', 'Based', 'comic', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Crow', 'great', 'premise', 'man', 'back', 'dead', 'avenge', 'death', 'woman', 'made', 'well', 'dark', 'film', 'made', 'muted', 'dark', 'colors', 'almost', 'black', 'white', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'great', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'son', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Brandon', 'break-out', 'role', 'had', ""n't"", 'died', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'fight', 'scenes', 'shoot', 'out', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'role', 'film', 'great', 'soundtrack.The', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'extras', 'commentary', 'Jeff', 'Most', 'producer', 'executive', 'music', 'producer', 'Crow', 'movies', 'John', 'Shirley', 'co-writer', 'Crow', 'commentary', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'get', 'lot', 'insight', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'why', 'certain', 'choices', 'were', 'made', 'what', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'should', 'be', 'shame', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'was', 'unable', 'do', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'film', 'Most', 'commentary', 'very', 'informative', 'very', 'entertaining', 'only', 'fault', 'commentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'Brandon', 'death', 'really', 'expected', 'hear', 'more', 'such', 'huge', 'part', 'mythos', 'film', 'Also', 'disc', 'one', 'DVD-ROM', 'extras', 'script', 'read', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'playing', 'trivia', 'game', 'really', ""n't"", 'great', 'entire', 'Crow', 'franchise', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'enhanced', 'playback', 'track', 'trivia', 'other', 'features', 'film', 'plays.In', 'addition', 'usual', 'production', 'stills', 'posters', 'five', 'story', 'boards', 'one', 'story', 'board', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'Disc', '2', 'Scenes', 'featurette', '15', 'minutes', 'not', 'making', 'rather', 'involved', 'movie', 'including', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'movie', 'concept', '30', 'minute', 'Portrait', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'creator', 'Crow', 'comic', 'book', ""O'Barr"", 'basement', 'talking', 'someone', 'holding', 'video', 'camcorder', 'get', 'lot', 'insight', 'life', 'work', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'many', 'ideas', 'Crow', 'came', 'something', 'called', 'Deleted', 'Footage', 'Montage', 'really', ""n't"", 'deleted', 'footage', 'deleted', 'footage', 'montage', 'most', 'outtakes', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'footage', 'what', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'deleted', 'movie', 'touching', 'tribute', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'not', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'finally', 'are', 'three', 'extended', 'scenes', 'Arcade', 'Bombing', 'Fun', 'Boy', 'Fight', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'What', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'original', 'footage', 'was', 'how', 'edited', 'scene', 'make', 'move', 'so', 'fast', 'paced', 'see', 'decision', 'process', 'removing', 'unessential', 'footage', 'keep', 'movie', 'bogging', 'down.So', 'have', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Definitely', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'library']",N/A

Michael Wincott is, very menacing as the main villain, and was perfect for the part. The flashbacks were very cool, however I wished, I could see more of Shelley's character. The Directing is outstanding!. Alex Proyas does an outstanding job here, creating lots of, dark atmosphere, great use of the rain machine, cool visuals, and keeping the pace, action packed, and engrossing all the way!. The film is very violent, but not all of it is bloody. We get several knives in the chest, knife in the hand, lots of gunshot wounds, some bloody, some not, hole through hand, 2 slashing's, slit throat,2 bloody impaling's, sword in the neck and a crow pecks a girls eyes out. The Acting is WONDERFUL!. Brandon Lee, gives an Oscar worthy performance here, he is completely mesmerizing, creepy, kicks that ass and, just thought he was too cool, his AMAZING performance here, will always be remembered, what happened too him was a tragedy, and i for one will never forget him!. Rochelle Davis is awesome here, and is very likable, her and Brandon, had very good chemistry and is one of the best kid actors out there!, especially since she hasn't acted since then!. Ernie Hudson, is terrific as the Sgt., very likable, and very convincing. Michael Wincott, is great as the main villain, I loved his voice, and he was very menacing!.

The Crow resonates with a melancholy feel, probably because of the death of its star, Brandon Lee.  But what struck me more than anything was the cinematography of the whole film.  Even though it's in color, it's shot like it was in black and white.  There are hardly any colors at all and those that are there, are washed out in the gritty urban hell that the story takes place in.  The story by itself is not all that spectacular.  In fact, it is not much more than a B movie revenge drama, but the look is what makes it so great.The other element that makes the Crow so good is the soundtrack.  The Onion accurately called the soundtrack a great soundtrack to an otherwise mediocre film.  The soundtrack is a wonderful slice of the feeling of the time.  It is a tiny time capsule of the early 90s when the members of Gen X were justifiably angry at the Baby Boomers and Me Generation for creating a great party but sticking us with the bill, all the while blithely droning on about how great they were and their accomplishments were and what shiftless layabouts we were by comparison.

The problem is that it didn't deliver in the right places and didn't do the story any justice.The story is one of revenge.  The main character, eric draven, was going to be married to his sweetheart.  When a bunch of degenerates break in and kill him and his girlfriend in a brutal manner.  All seems to be forgotten until the one year after the event, then Eric is raised from the dead and returns for vengence.The original comic book was gritty, violent, and filled with dark poetry and philosophy.  The movie had the feeling of something that MTV would produce, more of a collecion of music videos than a cohesive movie.  The editing is poor, the directing was worse, the characters were two dimensional and often annoying, the dialogue weak, and turned an interesting story into a shallow action flick on par with Johhny Mneumonic or Demolition Man.In the original, there was no point to the original murders.  They were just on the highway and were unlucky enough to run into a pack of degenerates.  Funboy had a much bigger role and assisted in the death of T bird.  Top dollar wasn't into black magic, he was a crack dealer that was one of the first to go.  One of the biggest differences is that Eric Draven in the comic was like an angel of death, he knew what he was about and why he was there.  In the movie he was a confused metalhead that stumbles through the movie.  Plus the whole idea of Eric being a musician that was going to get married on Halloween was just cheesy, trying way too hard to package him for the metal/goth crowd.I give this a two stars for the fact that it was a pretty movie, and it had some good action sequences.",2,James O Barr's tale told by MTV,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,1719,"['was', 'movie', 'was', 'hoping', 'lot', 'delivered', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'right', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'story', 'justice.The', 'story', 'one', 'revenge', 'main', 'character', 'eric', 'draven', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'married', 'sweetheart', 'When', 'bunch', 'degenerates', 'break', 'kill', 'girlfriend', 'brutal', 'manner', 'be', 'forgotten', 'one', 'year', 'event', 'then', 'Eric', 'raised', 'dead', 'returns', 'vengence.The', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'gritty', 'violent', 'filled', 'dark', 'poetry', 'philosophy', 'movie', 'had', 'feeling', 'something', 'MTV', 'would', 'produce', 'more', 'collecion', 'music', 'videos', 'cohesive', 'movie', 'editing', 'poor', 'directing', 'was', 'worse', 'characters', 'were', 'two', 'dimensional', 'often', 'annoying', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'turned', 'interesting', 'story', 'shallow', 'action', 'flick', 'par', 'Johhny', 'Mneumonic', 'Demolition', 'Man.In', 'original', 'was', 'point', 'original', 'murders', 'were', 'just', 'highway', 'were', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'run', 'pack', 'degenerates', 'Funboy', 'had', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'assisted', 'death', 'T', 'bird', 'Top', 'dollar', 'was', ""n't"", 'black', 'magic', 'was', 'crack', 'dealer', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'go', 'One', 'biggest', 'differences', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'comic', 'was', 'angel', 'death', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'confused', 'metalhead', 'movie', 'whole', 'idea', 'Eric', 'being', 'musician', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'Halloween', 'was', 'just', 'cheesy', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'package', 'metal/goth', 'crowd.I', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'fact', 'was', 'pretty', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A
361926,A22JR9ROYRPN7P,6303187064,ANAN KHALIQUE,"[1, 3]","This box set includes the Collector's Editions of 3 dvds from The Crow film series: The Crow, The Crow: City Of Angles & The Crow: Salvation. Before buying this, I hadn't seen any of the films. I got it because most people I knew compared the original to Dark City & the original 1989 Batman, 2 other favorites of mine & since they didn't have the original dvd alone, I had to get the boxed set. I'll start with the worst & work my way up to the best.I have not seen the last 2 films so I'm basing what I say on memory.Salvation - This movie was the worst (before the Wicked Prayer film) of the series. It stars Eric Manibus (or however you spell his last name lol who was Riley in Buffy) as Alex Corvis & Kirsten Dunst of Spiderman 1-3 fame. Unlike the other films I've seen, Alex Corvis is the only one who dis not have face paint on. He's framed for murder & because he was wrongfully accused for Lauren's (Alex's girlfriend) death, the mysterious crow brings him back to avenge her death who happens to be the sister of Dunst's character. Some of the music is quite enjoyable: The music heard while Alex visits the grave & where the statue has a tear of blood (this is at the cemetery at night where Alex first sees his girlfriend;s sister but disappears when she calls her dad, screaming that there's someone there), the music at the end where the final dialogue is heard (right before the end credits hit). They are on the score soundtrack as appears as: Alex Visits Lauren's Grave, Slo-Mo Walking, Love Theme - Ending. Listen to these 3 tracks.City Of Angels - This one while better than Salvation & Wicked Prayer still does not hold a candle to the original. Here, Vincent Perez stars in the lead role. Vincent's character is Ashe Corven, who's killed along with Danny, his son. Sarah from the original flm returns, older & played by another actor (Mia Kirshner). Corven is resurrected (which is witnessed by Sarah herself) & along with the guidance of the crow & Sarah, he seeks vengeance on the criminals to murdered him & his son. Sarah paints his face & he gets black colored clothing & a motorcycle. After killing off the minions one by one, he returns to his grave so he can rest in peace.The Original Crow - THE BEST of the series & one of the BEST films in my lifetime & in the history of films. The late, great, ahead of his time, Brandon Lee gave a performance second to none & I cannot find the words to describe his portrayal. He was totally dedicated to this film. It was his BEST performance & this film made his career, which ended prematurely thanks to a tragic accident on set during the making of the film. I will not go into detail about it because it saddens me too much to do so & people who read this likely already know what happened. Everything about this film is really just magnificently amazing! And that's putting it mildly! The entire cast were great & fit the roles better than anyone I know. But the MVP is & always will be IMO Brandon Lee. It's tragic yet at the same time ironic that the film in which the lead character, Eric Draven dies & is also the film which was supposed to lead Brandon Lee to superstardom, perhaps beyond that the film I believe he was most dedicated to, is also the film where he passed during the making of it. In the film, Eric returns after his death. Too bad Brandon can't.Note: The Skull Cowboy is a character that does not appear in the film. But he was intended to & you can see him for a second or two in an extended version of a scene. You'll find out which one eventually. He witnesses Eric's resurrection or does the resurrecting. I'm not sure. But he's just there to explain certain things to Eric such as why he's come back, what his mission is. Also, he explains to Eric that he lost a portion of his powers because he went off mission for a time to talk Darla into being a mom again to Sarah & quit using morphine cause it's bad. In the extended edition of the Funboy scene, he stabs Eric, who screams. THe reason for that is Cowboy's explanation for Eric losing some powerDVD Extras: Deleted footage montage (excellent bgm), Extended scenes, Making-Of Featurette (I love these kinds of extras. It's why I buy DVD's. This was a great one! Wish all the main cast members & crew were present for this. But it wasn't to be), and finally, Brandon Lee's very last interview (that was also on The Crow vhs).If you can find the dvd of the original alone & you should be able to, get it cause the movie & extras are definitely worth multiple viewings & I also recommend the score more than the soundtrack although the soundtrack does have some great songs on it. Both fit the film well especially the tracks that appear in the film. I thought they were heard in the movie at the right times & places. I don't know but I prefer the DVD's audio over the bluray. But the bluray has better picture quality & that is the reason I have both versions.",5,"THE CROW, CITY OF ANGELS, SALVATION",1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,4917,"['box', 'set', 'Collector', 'Editions', '3', 'dvds', 'Crow', 'film', 'series', 'Crow', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angles', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'buying', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', 'got', 'most', 'people', 'knew', 'compared', 'original', 'Dark', 'City', 'original', '1989', 'Batman', '2', 'other', 'favorites', 'mine', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'original', 'dvd', 'alone', 'had', 'get', 'boxed', 'set', ""'ll"", 'start', 'worst', 'work', 'way', 'best.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'last', '2', 'films', 'so', ""'m"", 'basing', 'what', 'say', 'memory.Salvation', 'movie', 'was', 'worst', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'film', 'series', 'Eric', 'Manibus', 'however', 'spell', 'last', 'name', 'lol', 'who', 'was', 'Riley', 'Buffy', 'Alex', 'Corvis', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Spiderman', '1-3', 'fame', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Alex', 'Corvis', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'face', 'paint', 'framed', 'murder', 'was', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'Lauren', 'Alex', 'girlfriend', 'death', 'mysterious', 'crow', 'back', 'avenge', 'death', 'who', 'be', 'sister', 'Dunst', 'character', 'music', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'heard', 'Alex', 'grave', 'where', 'statue', 'tear', 'blood', 'cemetery', 'night', 'where', 'Alex', 'first', 'girlfriend', 's', 'sister', 'disappears', 'when', 'dad', 'screaming', 'someone', 'there', 'music', 'end', 'where', 'final', 'dialogue', 'heard', 'right', 'end', 'credits', 'hit', 'are', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'Alex', 'Visits', 'Lauren', 'Grave', 'Slo-Mo', 'Walking', 'Love', 'Theme', 'Ending', 'Listen', '3', 'tracks.City', 'Angels', 'one', 'better', 'Salvation', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'still', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'Here', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'stars', 'lead', 'role', 'Vincent', 'character', 'Ashe', 'Corven', 'who', 'killed', 'Danny', 'son', 'original', 'flm', 'returns', 'older', 'played', 'actor', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'Corven', 'resurrected', 'witnessed', 'Sarah', 'guidance', 'crow', 'Sarah', 'vengeance', 'criminals', 'murdered', 'son', 'Sarah', 'paints', 'face', 'black', 'colored', 'clothing', 'motorcycle', 'killing', 'off', 'minions', 'one', 'one', 'grave', 'can', 'rest', 'peace.The', 'Original', 'Crow', 'BEST', 'series', 'one', 'BEST', 'films', 'lifetime', 'history', 'films', 'late', 'great', 'ahead', 'time', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'gave', 'performance', 'second', 'none', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'words', 'describe', 'portrayal', 'was', 'totally', 'dedicated', 'film', 'was', 'BEST', 'performance', 'film', 'made', 'career', 'ended', 'prematurely', 'thanks', 'tragic', 'accident', 'set', 'making', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'likely', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Everything', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'magnificently', 'amazing', 'putting', 'mildly', 'entire', 'cast', 'were', 'great', 'fit', 'roles', 'better', 'anyone', 'know', 'MVP', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'IMO', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'tragic', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'ironic', 'film', 'lead', 'character', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'also', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'lead', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'superstardom', 'perhaps', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'most', 'dedicated', 'also', 'film', 'where', 'passed', 'making', 'film', 'Eric', 'returns', 'death', 'Too', 'bad', 'Brandon', ""can't.Note"", 'Skull', 'Cowboy', 'character', 'not', 'appear', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'can', 'see', 'second', 'two', 'extended', 'version', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'one', 'eventually', 'Eric', 'resurrection', 'resurrecting', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'just', 'there', 'explain', 'certain', 'things', 'Eric', 'such', 'why', 'come', 'back', 'what', 'mission', 'Also', 'Eric', 'lost', 'portion', 'powers', 'went', 'off', 'mission', 'time', 'talk', 'Darla', 'being', 'mom', 'again', 'Sarah', 'quit', 'using', 'morphine', 'cause', 'bad', 'extended', 'edition', 'Funboy', 'scene', 'stabs', 'Eric', 'who', 'THe', 'reason', 'Cowboy', 'explanation', 'Eric', 'losing', 'powerDVD', 'Extras', 'Deleted', 'footage', 'montage', 'excellent', 'bgm', 'Extended', 'scenes', 'Making-Of', 'Featurette', 'love', 'kinds', 'extras', 'why', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'Wish', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'crew', 'were', 'present', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'finally', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'very', 'last', 'interview', 'was', 'also', 'Crow', 'vhs', 'can', 'find', 'dvd', 'original', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'cause', 'movie', 'extras', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'also', 'recommend', 'score', 'more', 'soundtrack', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'great', 'songs', 'fit', 'film', 'well', 'especially', 'tracks', 'appear', 'film', 'thought', 'were', 'heard', 'movie', 'right', 'times', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'prefer', 'DVD', 'audio', 'bluray', 'bluray', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'reason', 'have', 'versions']",N/A

361931,A4VH04TA14CPE,6303187064,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[2, 8]","Okay, this is a definitely good movie. Brandon Lee was the perfect man for the role of the Crow, and of course, his untimely death lent an air of even deeper tragedy to the story. The supporting cast is pretty good too - T-Bird, Top Dollar, Funboy, all fit their roles excellently. And what's more, the soundtrack is filled with great _original_ material from some of the best alternative bands ever.So why doesn't this movie deserve the full 5 stars? Simply put, it isn't as good as the graphic novel. The graphic novel is a masterpiece of perversity and pain. In the graphic novel, there is none of that stuff about how if the crow was hurt, Eric would lose his super powers. The book does not rely on creating drama by putting the character's life in danger (especially by means of such a cheeky device) - it creates it by the utterly unbearable despair that permeates every page. We know Eric is going to win, but that doesn't keep us from fervently wishing that he'll find his inner peace.The movie doesn't have that. In addition to the fact that the screenwriters added that bit, they took several other ""creative liberties"": for instance, in the book, Top Dollar was killed fairly early on, very ignominiously and without the climactic showdown bit. In the movie, he's not only the head of a whole crime ring, but he didn't even participate in the original murders of Eric and Shelly. Another ""creative liberty"" was the addition of Top Dollar's sister/lover, Myca, who was not present in the book at all. Her presence adds some New-Age/mysticism stuff that really has no place at all in the storyline. (Hey, we should thank our lucky stars an editor rejected the ORIGINAL screenplay, which featured a Chinese sorcerer named Lao.)There were several other scenes that I thought the book did far better than the movie. For instance, in the book, Eric does not have a showdown with Funboy - he throws Darla (or ""Sandy"" in the book) out, sits down on a chair and has himself a nice metaphysical discussion with the junkie. (Trust me, it's MUCH more effective than it sounds.) Of course, there were numerous other scenes left out (the Jones Transfer episode, Skank's death, which was COMPLETELY different and far more horrific in the book), etc. This is partially because you can only cram so much into ninety minutes; and while the movie was very faithful to the book (for a movie), one can't help but feel that it simplified some of the book's subtleties and replaced some of its horrifically cruel, but beautiful moments with more-or-less generic action. It has plenty of its own merits, but if you liked the movie a lot, DEFINITELY find the book, as it's darker, more poignant, and generally better at telling the story than the movie.

361934,A1FE06N5A77K8W,6303187064,Annie Feng,"[2, 18]","I have seen this film-labeled the best one, and the 4th Crow movie-labeled the worst one at pretty much the same time. And I just gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with both, but especially this one, which has been labeled the best Crow film and it's soooooo good and a must see etc etc etc. Needless to say, my expectations for this film is pretty high.So here's my comparason of The Crow and The Crow: Wicked Prayer:But when I saw the film, I was pretty much cringing for most of the way through. First of all there was Brandon Lee's acting. he wasn't so much as ""the crow"" as ""the clow"", or more accurately, ""the Joker"". Edward Furlong had a much cooler ""The Crow"" look, while Brandon Lee's Crow look is pretty much like a clow, it was a really ridiculous look. And secondly, if I had to compare acting, I would choose Edward Furlong for he had more character depth than Brandon Lee (and just on a side-note, I'm not a fan of Edward Furlong, I didn't even know him until I saw the fourth crow movie). Furlong pulled off the Crow as someone who is deeply confused, and was despairing over what he had become, and even resisted his undead-ness. Brandon Lee, on the other hand, fully embraced his power to create havoc, and was pretty sadistic most of the time throughout the film(especially when he was telling people to shoot him-I was cinging like heck) (hence making him more ""the joker"" for me). Furlong had some pretty good lines, Lee, on the other hand, the only line that gave me a few chuckles was when he told the cop ""your hat is still on"", all his other lines are really cheesy, and he failed to show me how he brought people together by using his wisdom. So basically, I felt Furlong was a better crow in looks, character depth and cunning speeches, and he kills the bad guys in rage(which made me feel more for his revenge). While Lee was pretty much a crazy and at many times pathetic clow killing people sadistically(which pretty much made me cringe).So that said, what are the things this movie is better than the fourth one?? There are lots- mainly the violence. Lee's Crow had pretty creative plots for each of the people he's gonna kill. The film is also much much darker and set in a feeling of sad, dangerous, yet at the same time sacrete place. So needless to say, this move definitely had the best action.As for the plot. both films, in my opinion, are equal in different way. And I pretty much mean the villains. This movie's villains were pretty over the top. The ending-how the crow killed the guy, is creative but didn't work as well-it got kinda destroyed when he thanked the cop-gosh I was literally screaming CHEESY!!! the fourth crow movie's villain wasn't great either, and also pretty cheesy, but at least in the fourth crow movie the villains were formidable-aka he had power almost equal that of the crow. While this movie the crow kills like everybody, and the resolution of his power being taken away is pretty stupid too-the bird peck the woman's face, geeez I wouldn't have thought of that *sarcasm*So why do people praise this movie to the stars? Simple, two reasons: 1. this was the first film, and I know about the first initial biase over everything in most people-so basically this was the first crow movie, people loved it(there was this saying that ""it's always the first one that is the best one"" but it's just not true, it's because of the first-biase). 2. Brandon Lee lost his life for this movie, yet this movie was still released, I gotta say, that is really impressive.But I also know that this movie is released in 1994, yeah, that was before Joss Whedon-the master creater of dark themes-and who nowadays pretty much everybody(who tries to make the similar genre) was trying to copy on was known. So it's understandable, but that's pretty much proving what I've always observed-films (in general of course) get BETTER, not worse. Actors get better and better as the generations goes on. In fact, nowadays when I see old movies like Gone With the Wind and the 40s version of Pride and Prejudice, I was literally YELLING how incredibly HORRIBLE the actings are.So hit at me if you wish, but this is the solid opinion of someone who is completely unbiased. For the viewers: if you really enjoy violence and juss wanna watch violence, this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for something a little more, I suggest you look elsewhere.",3,those who praise this film to the stars are all biased,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,4397,"['have', 'seen', 'film-labeled', 'best', 'one', '4th', 'Crow', 'movie-labeled', 'worst', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'one', 'been', 'labeled', 'best', 'Crow', 'film', 'soooooo', 'good', 'must', 'see', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'Needless', 'say', 'expectations', 'film', 'pretty', 'high.So', 'here', 'comparason', 'Crow', 'Crow', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'cringing', 'most', 'way', 'First', 'was', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'crow', 'clow', 'more', 'accurately', 'Joker', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'had', 'much', 'cooler', 'Crow', 'look', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Crow', 'look', 'pretty', 'much', 'clow', 'was', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'look', 'secondly', 'had', 'compare', 'acting', 'would', 'choose', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'had', 'more', 'character', 'depth', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'just', 'side-note', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'saw', 'fourth', 'crow', 'movie', 'Furlong', 'pulled', 'off', 'Crow', 'someone', 'who', 'deeply', 'confused', 'was', 'despairing', 'over', 'what', 'had', 'become', 'even', 'resisted', 'undead-ness', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'other', 'hand', 'fully', 'embraced', 'power', 'create', 'havoc', 'was', 'pretty', 'sadistic', 'most', 'time', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'telling', 'people', 'shoot', 'him-I', 'was', 'cinging', 'heck', 'hence', 'making', 'more', 'joker', 'Furlong', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'lines', 'Lee', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'line', 'gave', 'few', 'chuckles', 'was', 'when', 'told', 'cop', 'hat', 'still', 'other', 'lines', 'are', 'really', 'cheesy', 'failed', 'show', 'how', 'brought', 'people', 'together', 'using', 'wisdom', 'So', 'basically', 'felt', 'Furlong', 'was', 'better', 'crow', 'looks', 'character', 'depth', 'cunning', 'speeches', 'bad', 'guys', 'rage', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'revenge', 'Lee', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'crazy', 'many', 'times', 'pathetic', 'clow', 'killing', 'people', 'sadistically', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'cringe', '.So', 'said', 'what', 'are', 'things', 'movie', 'better', 'fourth', 'one', 'are', 'lots-', 'mainly', 'violence', 'Lee', 'Crow', 'had', 'pretty', 'creative', 'plots', 'people', 'gon', 'kill', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'much', 'darker', 'set', 'feeling', 'sad', 'dangerous', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'sacrete', 'place', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'move', 'definitely', 'had', 'best', 'action.As', 'plot', 'films', 'opinion', 'are', 'equal', 'different', 'way', 'pretty', 'much', 'villains', 'movie', 'villains', 'were', 'pretty', 'top', 'ending-how', 'crow', 'killed', 'guy', 'creative', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well-it', 'got', 'kinda', 'destroyed', 'when', 'thanked', 'cop-gosh', 'was', 'literally', 'screaming', 'CHEESY', 'fourth', 'crow', 'movie', 'villain', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'also', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'least', 'fourth', 'crow', 'movie', 'villains', 'were', 'formidable-aka', 'had', 'power', 'almost', 'equal', 'crow', 'movie', 'crow', 'kills', 'everybody', 'resolution', 'power', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'too-the', 'bird', 'peck', 'woman', 'face', 'geeez', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', '*sarcasm*So', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'praise', 'movie', 'stars', 'Simple', 'two', 'reasons', '1.', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'know', 'first', 'initial', 'biase', 'everything', 'most', 'people-so', 'basically', 'was', 'first', 'crow', 'movie', 'people', 'loved', 'was', 'saying', 'always', 'first', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'true', 'first-biase', '2', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'lost', 'life', 'movie', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'released', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'really', 'impressive.But', 'also', 'know', 'movie', 'released', '1994', 'yeah', 'was', 'Joss', 'Whedon-the', 'master', 'creater', 'dark', 'themes-and', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'who', 'make', 'similar', 'genre', 'was', 'trying', 'copy', 'was', 'known', 'understandable', 'pretty', 'much', 'proving', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'observed-films', 'general', 'course', 'get', 'BETTER', 'not', 'worse', 'Actors', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'generations', 'fact', 'when', 'see', 'old', 'movies', 'Gone', 'Wind', '40s', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'literally', 'YELLING', 'how', 'incredibly', 'actings', 'are.So', 'hit', 'wish', 'solid', 'opinion', 'someone', 'who', 'completely', 'unbiased', 'viewers', 'really', 'enjoy', 'violence', 'juss', 'wan', 'watch', 'violence', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

361936,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6303187064,Anthony Hinde,"[3, 3]","When Alex Proyas released &quot;The Crow&quot;, he picked his time well. The film was a modern Gothic style-fest, at the height of the Gothic movement. But it has so much more than style that it has captured a strong  following, loyal despite the years. This is, in no  small part, due to the  presence of Brandon Lee and of course his controversial death during  filming.Most people are aware that &quot;The Crow&quot; started  out as a Top Dollar comic, penned by James O'Barr. The brooding tale of a  murdered man, returned from the dead to right wrongs, was very popular. The  comic and the film spoke to a youthful generation, frustrated by a culture  which was ruled by apathetic adults seemingly blind to the unstoppable  decline of the world. How right it would feel to have the power and the  motivation to do something positive for the world. And if a few bad guys  get crushed beneath your boots in the process... so much the better.The comic was always depicted from a very personal angle. Eric  Draven's brutal quest, his torment and his compassion were always the  driving force  behind the tale. Choosing Brandon Lee to play this part was  a stroke of brilliance. He certainly had the look and the moves to carry it  off. But more importantly he had a screen presence that was almost magical.  His father had the same sort of charisma and if anything, Brandon actually  exuded more style. It would have been interesting to see what else he could  have done had he not been shot during filming.Although some of  the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; were a little over the top, the main protagonist,  interestingly named Top Dollar and played by Michael Wincott, was very  convincing. He and his half sister made a strangely relaxed but menacing  duo against which Eric Draven sets himself all unknowing. You see, when he  first returned from the grave, literally, his only thoughts were for  revenge against the men who had raped and murdered his betrothed. It is  only when his  mission is nearly complete that he learns their violent acts  have in fact been orchestrated by higher powers.On the sideline  we have two other characters. The detective, now sergeant Albrecht, that  investigated the initial murders has never quite let go of the case. This  is partly because he has to look out for a semi-orphaned girl called Sarah,  (Rachael Davis), who was previously cared for by Eric and his love. The cop  and the street urchin provide witnesses tot he events and in the end get  drawn directly into the conflict. In fact, Sarah is the only thing that  holds Eric back from resting in peace.Just when things seemed to  be over, the evil siblings make a bid for Eric's power as personified by a  crow which haunts his every move. They want the same invulnerability that  Eric has but even more Top Dollar want his own revenge on Eric for spoiling  his plans for devil's night mayhem. In the end, with his supernatural  protection stripped, it is just passion against passion.

Unfortunately for us, this is Brandon Lee's one and only good movie.The Crow had tremendous impact on the Goth scene of the 90's, due to Brandon Lee's brooding acting and the Nine Inch Nails composed ""Dead Souls"" theme song. There are other vigilante films that came before and after The Crow, yet it remains the best given the accidental death of Brandon during filming, who died very young like his dad.Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven, a recently deceased guitarist who comes back from the grave to exact revenge on those who put him to sleep. Between the nasty guitar licks, soaking gothic imagery, and eponymous crow that follows him throughout the movie, Eric is one gloomy guy. He still manages to catch his girl on the rebound however, even as an undead stiff.In terms of goth appeal, The Crow has since been unseated by Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in Dark Knight, who also passed away due to unusual circumstances during filming of that movie.

As much as i enjoy a good super hero movie, i personally like the darker ones the best. Spiderman was pretty good, but too cheery for me. The darker movies tend to rely more on imagery and power than an overload of special effects. Some of the hero movies try to be dark but end up crappy (Daredevil). Personally, the best to pull it off are a select few of the Batmans (Begins, 1 and 2) and this. The best scenes of this movie are those that have little or no dialogue. Not saying that any time someone talks it ruins the movie, its just the way that the imagery takes over. The look that Brandon Lee gives himself as the Crow is both subtle and pure evil at the same time. The Crow shows that you don't need to go overboard on costumes to give a frightning image. I'd sh*t my pants if i saw some guy coming towards me looking like Lee. The plot was simple yet creative and believable. The acting slips a bit here and there, for example when Lee gives the morphine lecture to Sarah's mother and at times he seems uncomfortable saying the word ""Shelly."" However, the movie always seems to recover. Favorite scenes are probably when he goes after Tin Tin because it just looks so dark and evil , and the big shootout at Top Dollar's, that just goes without saying. Despite that Skank guy being a little annoyingly dumb and the unthreatening gang member names (Tin Tin, Fun Boy) this movie excels. My favorite superhero movie is still Batman Begins, but this one really surprised me with its simple, dark, and just downright evil ways.",4,"For what it's worth, a quality dark movie",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,1646,"['day', 'when', ""'re"", 'getting', 'overload', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'left', 'right', 'Crow', 'still', 'top', 'As', 'much', 'i', 'enjoy', 'good', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'i', 'personally', 'darker', 'ones', 'best', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'cheery', 'darker', 'movies', 'tend', 'rely', 'more', 'imagery', 'power', 'overload', 'special', 'effects', 'hero', 'movies', 'try', 'be', 'dark', 'end', 'up', 'crappy', 'Daredevil', 'Personally', 'best', 'pull', 'off', 'are', 'select', 'few', 'Batmans', 'Begins', '1', '2', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'have', 'little', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'saying', 'time', 'someone', 'talks', 'movie', 'just', 'way', 'imagery', 'look', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Crow', 'subtle', 'pure', 'evil', 'same', 'time', 'Crow', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'overboard', 'costumes', 'give', 'frightning', 'image', ""'d"", 'sh*t', 'pants', 'i', 'saw', 'guy', 'coming', 'towards', 'looking', 'Lee', 'plot', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'creative', 'believable', 'acting', 'slips', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'example', 'when', 'Lee', 'morphine', 'lecture', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'saying', 'word', 'Shelly', 'However', 'movie', 'always', 'recover', 'Favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'probably', 'when', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'just', 'so', 'dark', 'evil', 'big', 'shootout', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'just', 'saying', 'Skank', 'guy', 'being', 'little', 'annoyingly', 'dumb', 'unthreatening', 'gang', 'member', 'names', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'Fun', 'Boy', 'movie', 'favorite', 'superhero', 'movie', 'still', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'one', 'really', 'surprised', 'simple', 'dark', 'just', 'downright', 'evil', 'ways']",N/A

But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it, and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back, to put the wrong things right.&quot;The Crow is mythmaking at its best. Eric Draven (Lee) is brought back from the dead to avenge the rape and murder of his wife and his own murder. While filming the scene where his character is shot dead at the beginning of The Crow, in order to return to life as an immortal Jesus figure, the cap from the blank hit him and lodged in his spine, and Brandon Lee died. The way Lee's death on set at that particular moment fit into the myth of the movie is just as much to do with the cult status of this picture, as its fantastic gothic landscape, exciting story, gorgeous score and irresistable central figure.Brandon Lee, being interviewed about The Crow, was asked about death and his character in the film. He said this:&quot;Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything happens only a certain number of times. And a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood. An afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it. Perhaps four or five times or more. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.&quot;He died not long after.

Throughout the entire movie there's a confusing mix of feelings - wanting to see him obtain revenge, wishing their was some justification for the wrongs done to him, and wondering what mysterious turn the plot will take next. The movie has excellent fighting sequences and wonderful directing. The way Brandon Lee could present himself as such an enraged person, the way he would talk to his victims before exacting his revenge upon them, how he didn't hesitate to do what was necessary, and how after the horrible events that took place a year before he was resurrected, he could still find redemption in his past-life memories. He even managed to twist in a moderate amount of comedy with his angry side, which is in my mind, true talent as an actor.

Not bad for a small budget movie with a cast of unknowns.Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancee Shelly (Sophia Shinas) are brutally murdered on the night before Halloween, the Devil's Night. However their love for each other proves to be so strong that even death cannot prevent Eric from seeking revenge against the four men responsible for the homicides. With the help of an animal familiar, the crow, he digs his way out of the grave a year later and returns to the scene of the crime. As another Halloween approaches the Devil's Night is about to take on a whole new meaning.'The Crow' is without a doubt the ultimate gothic/romance movie of all-time and quite likely the most revered film adaptation of a comic book hero. This is an amazing work of cinematography coupled with a deeply touching story. Despite the high degree of death and brutality in this film it's first and foremost a love story. Now eleven years since its release we can see in retrospect the profound effect this '94 movie has had in influencing the Goth Movement so prevalent today. A true classic to be enjoyed over and over again!Cast: Brandon Lee (Eric Draven), Sophia Shinas (Shelly),  Rochelle Davis (Sarah), Ernie Hudson (Sergeant Albrecht), Michael Wincott (Top Dollar) and Ling Bai (Myca).",5,"""There Ain't No Coming Back""  ~  ""Then Sometimes, Just Sometimes""",1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,1582,"['Create', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'urban', 'wasteland', 'shroud', 'ambience', 'depression', 'hopelessness', 'then', 'add', 'cutting', 'edge', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Answer', 'cult', 'classic', 'captured', 'angst', 'generation', 'given', 'quintessencial', 'anti-hero', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Not', 'bad', 'small', 'budget', 'movie', 'cast', 'unknowns.Eric', 'Draven', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'fiancee', 'Shelly', 'Sophia', 'Shinas', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'night', 'Halloween', 'Devil', 'Night', 'However', 'love', 'other', 'proves', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'even', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'prevent', 'Eric', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'four', 'men', 'responsible', 'homicides', 'help', 'animal', 'familiar', 'crow', 'way', 'grave', 'year', 'later', 'returns', 'scene', 'crime', 'Halloween', 'Devil', 'Night', 'take', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'Crow', 'doubt', 'ultimate', 'gothic/romance', 'movie', 'all-time', 'quite', 'likely', 'most', 'revered', 'film', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'amazing', 'work', 'cinematography', 'coupled', 'deeply', 'touching', 'story', 'high', 'degree', 'death', 'brutality', 'film', 'first', 'foremost', 'love', 'story', 'Now', 'eleven', 'years', 'release', 'can', 'see', 'retrospect', 'profound', 'effect', 'movie', 'had', 'influencing', 'Goth', 'Movement', 'so', 'prevalent', 'today', 'true', 'classic', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'over', 'again', 'Cast', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'Sophia', 'Shinas', 'Shelly', 'Rochelle', 'Davis', 'Sarah', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Sergeant', 'Albrecht', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'Ling', 'Bai', 'Myca']",N/A

361957,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,6303187064,Charismatic Creature,"[32, 34]","I never saw this originally in '94 because I dismissed it as A. a martial arts film (and I hate those) and B. adapted from a comic (and I just can't get into those) and C. aimed at a teen/goth/punk audience (and I am way too old for that). What a mistake! Finally almost ten years on, a friend heard me say I really liked Alex Proyas' DARK CITY -- a neat sci fi film with a very different story but the same kind of dark fantasy look -- and couldn't believe I had never seen THE CROW and made me watch it.I have to say that I really think this is a fine, well made movie and none of my preconceptions were remotely correct. The art direction is brilliant, with a wonderful and creepy gothic fantasy look, almost but not quite black-and-white, set in a mysteriously surreal &quot;Detroit&quot; that is in some kind of alternate universe from the real Motown. Brandon Lee is really charismatic and haunting in the role of Eric Draven, and not merely because of the tragic incident surrounding the film. He was real star material and just totally inhabits this part.After seeing the film, I did read the O'Barr comic, which is very sincere and heartfelt, but I think the filmakers -- in what is a pretty rare event -- IMPROVED the plot and characters while keeping all of the angst and atmosphere. They totally honored the character of Eric and the basic idea of the avenger, the memories of his beautiful girlfriend, and sense of overwhelming grief that inhabits the graphic novel. Where they impoved the storyline in cinematic terms is in the treatment of the minor characters and villians. They really fleshed them out, and it enriches the movie and balances the storyline well.Bookending the film with quotes from Sarah (Rochelle Davis), the little girl who narrates and observes much of the story is an example of a good idea that doesn't really exist in the comic, where the little girl is called Sherri and only appears briefly. Even more so is the expansion of the character of Top Dollar, who again is a minor episode in the comic and more of a grubby hell's angel/drug dealer -- in the film he has been  transformed into a complex and compelling crimelord. Michael Wincott is simply amazing in this part, playing Top Dollar as a kind of depraved, satanic, renaissance prince, and clearly having a great deal of fun with this role, especially some wonderful and very clever dialogue. The very, very sick but quite sincere love story between Top Dollar and his psychic half-sister is the reversed-mirror image of the pure and innocent love of Eric and his fiance, a clever idea.Wonderful music, great visuals, terrific acting...The Crow should NOT be missed.NOTE: I bought the &quot;Collector's DVD&quot;. Don't bother. There is NOTHING worth looking at on the second DVD, some production sketches and posters, nothing special. The director's commentary (on the first disk) is interesting to listen to ONCE, but you can get that on the single disk DVD. There is a smattering of extra footage, but nothing you will miss.

But The Crow was a brilliant combination of Death Wish, Ghost and the Dark Knight.  It has a rather standard, staid theme of revenge, but adds to it such odd imagery - a ghoul hero with a Death symbol for a pet and poetry from Edgar Allen Poe.  This all gives the film a rich depth and body, like a robust wine, which surprisingly for all the dark imagery, goes down rather smoothly.  The reason the deeply shadowed film feels so good is because of its counterpoint meta message - the power of love.  This note is admittedly a chic-flick theme, but with all the explosions and fight scenes and a walking corpse, this is hardly Sleepless in Seattle.Brandon Lee gives a powerful performance and it is truly unfortunate we won't see more of him, because his very natural style on this screen hints to more amazing skill that could have been his future.  It's also exciting that he was willing to take on such an ""alternative"" film.The music score was marvelous, but admittedly, I also love Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, early Queensryche and other metal rockers.  So if you don't like metal, the music might not connect.  The music connected clearly with the dark image of random gangs of rouges that rape, pillage and plunder for pure entertainment - a hint of A Clockwork Orange in that regard.The film has a bit of the Hollywood standard T&A;, but no gratuitous sex scenes.  It has explosions purely for the sake of excitement, but the other elements of image and shadow, philosophical themes of humanity and eternal love, powerful music and hard-hitting, well timed poetry.  As a result, the standard tools of sex, violence and ""rock and roll"" can be forgiven.  The Crow is truly a work of art, not just a flick.

Energy  packed fight scenes will truly amaze you, as they are choreographed at a  pace that will rarely be scene again. At the same time look past the action  and you will see and feel the love and the loss in this. The music is also  a great addition to the story, as it seems to capture the scene and only  enhance it.Based on the comicbook of the same name, it is one of the  best of such adaptations to ever be brought to the screen. It stayed true  to the story and the flavor, and didn't cheapen itself by taming itself to  pander to the kiddies like Spawn did.&lt;MINOR SPOILER BELOW&gt;The  story is of a man and woman slain on the eve of their wedding by a gang of  lowlifes for a trivial matter. This pain carries over with him to the other  side, and makes his eternal rest impossible. So he returns to revenge the  deed, so he can finally rest. The twist is, he is already dead, so he  doesn't need to eat, or sleep. This also makes him almost unstoppable, as  how do you kill a dead man?

361968,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6303187064,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 4]","Based on characters originally presented in the popular comic strip and comic book series created by James O'Barr, The Crow (1994) was directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, I, Robot) and featured Brandon Lee (Showdown in Little Tokyo, Rapid Fire), in what was supposed to be his breakout role, but instead was his last due to his shocking and untimely demise after suffering a critical injury near the end of filming.  Also appearing is Rochelle Davis, Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters II), Michael Wincott (Along Came a Spider), Sofia Shinas (Terminal Velocity), David Patrick Kelly (Dreamscape), Jon Polito (Miller's Crossing), Ling Bai (Wild Wild West), Laurence Mason (Behind Enemy Lines), Michael Massee (Catwoman), Angel David (G.I. Jane), and Tony Todd (Final Destination), probably best known for his memorable role in the horror/fantasy film Candyman (1992) along with its numerous follow ups.As the film begins we learn it's October 30th, Devil's Night, and we see a cityscape riddled with fire.  We also learn, through a helpful voice over, that crows act as guides for the recently departed, showing them the way to the hereafter, that is unless the deceased died in such a heinous and miserable way to where they might return to set things right (or something like that), as is the case with Eric Draven (Lee), who, along with his fianc&eacute;e Shelley (Shinas), were brutally murdered by a depraved gang of no goodniks led by a greasy character named T-Bird (Kelly).  Anyway, a year later we see Eric's grave.  Shortly after the arrival of a crow, from the rain soaked earth (it rains continuously throughout the film) rises a human form, that of Eric, who's actually looking pretty fit for being dead and buried and all.  Eric returns to the scene of the crime (the lofty apartment he and Shelley shared), which results in a flood of traumatic images and memories, all of which leads up to his smearing make-up on his mug, giving him the appearance of nightmarish mime.  From here Eric begins seeking out those responsible for what happened a year earlier, specifically T-Bird and his jolly, good time boys, as their day of reckoning has arrived...I should probably mention in Eric's avenging spirit form, he's nigh invulnerable, has increased strength and agility, and can see through the eyes of his ever present feathered companion (heck, I was impressed with that whole rising from the dead trick).  Anyway, as Eric works his way up the sleaze food chain he soon finds himself up against a criminal boss named Top Dollar (Wincott), a seemingly suave and sophisticated type who enjoys swords, chaos, and the occasional incestuous coupling with his creepy half sister Myca (Bai), who has a thing for peoples eyes (so much so she tends to remove them).I really enjoyed this dark and moody film as I thought it was extremely faithful to the original material, along with being an exceptionally well-produced feature in general.  Also, there's just something so satisfying about onscreen vigilante justice, i.e. seeing sadistic, criminal slime receiving their comeuppance, especially when the retribution is delivered in a provocative and befitting manner (each suffered a unique penalty for their indiscretions), as was the case here. All the characters presented have specific and defined roles within the context of the story, and none seemed extraneous.  I suppose I could have done without some of the sappier bits, those involving the little skateboarding street urchin Sarah played by Rochelle Davis, but the other strengths of the feature far outweigh any minor, relatively insignificant issues I may have come across.  I thought all the performers did a great job, the standouts, in my opinion, being Lee, Michael Wincott, and David Patrick Kelly.  Lee really seemed a perfect fit for the role not only in terms of his appearance or athletic abilities, but also in a sense he seemed to really understand and expand on the part.  I remember the bittersweet feeling I felt after seeing this film in the theaters as Lee's appearance here seemed to put forth a real sense of potential, potential that would never be realized due to his untimely death, which was brought about by a prop failure (the incident involved a gun, loaded with blanks, that was fired at Lee during shooting).  The accident occurred near the end of the shooting schedule, so in order to finish the film, computer graphics were used to modify Lee's stand in to look like Lee himself.  There's a lot of action in this film, and it's spread evenly enough to keep things moving at a respectable pace.  My favorite sequence comes near the end, as Eric crashes a rather large assemblage of criminal types, all armed to the teeth, as the ensuing melee is balls out.  The story is solid, the script believable (with some great, comedic touches), and the production values excellent.  There's an abundant selection of appropriate tunes present throughout the film, including some by The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots, My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult, Helmut, Pantera, Rollins Band, Violent Femmes, Nine Inch Nails, and more.This two DVD set features a sharp looking, anamorphic, widescreen (1.85:1) picture, along with audio available in DTS 5.1 Digital Surround Sound and Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  Extras include a commentary track with producer Jeff Most and screenwriter John Shirley, a behind the scenes featurette, a profile of James O'Barr, extended scenes, a deleted scenes montage, original poster concepts, production design stills, storyboards, a French language track, subtitles in English and Spanish, and sneak peeks at other Miramax/Dimension DVD release like Phantoms (1998), The Faculty (1998), Break Up (1998), along with advertising for the Scream and From Dusk Till Dawn DVD box sets.  There are also DVD-ROM features including a Devil's Night Retribution trivia game, an enhanced playback track, a screenplay viewer, and weblinks.Cookeiman108By the way, in case you're interested, there's been a number of follow ups to the original including (so far, and in order) The Crow: City of Angels (1996), The Crow: Salvation (2000), and The Crow: Wicked Prayer (2005).

The standout performance goes to Brandon Lee (eldest son of famed martial artist/actor Bruce Lee) as Eric Draven, a rock musician. Tragically, in real life, Brandon Lee died during the final filming of this movie - accidentally shot by real bullets instead of blanks.  His excellent performance in the movie may serve as his legacy.  The Crow is based on a comic book story.  The atmosphere of the movie is dark and sinister, but not at all campy as many comic book stories can be.  Eric and his fiancee, Shelley, are brutally murdered on Halloween by a group of thugs who terrorize the whole town.  A year later, with the help of a mystic crow, Eric returns from the grave to exact his revenge.  Two of my favorite bad guys in this movie are; T-Bird, played by David Patrick Kelly, a talented actor who plays a lot of bad guys - you might remember him from The Warriors, Dreamscape, Commando, or various Law & Order episodes... my other favorite bad guy is Top Dollar, played by the very impressive and enigmatic  Michael Wincott, whom you might remember as Guy of Gisborne in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.  Ernie Hudson (also in Ghostbusters) plays a recently demoted cop... he was involved in the murder case of Eric and Shelley, and when Eric returns, he becomes Eric's friend and ally.

Your link between the land of the living and the realm of the dead ... or in this case, your link between a really good movie and a couple mediocre sequels.The Crow collector's series turns out to be a pretty good disc overall, with a couple unfortunate ommissions. The picture looks and sounds fantastic! The deleted scenes are great for anyone who has never seen them. The extended arcade games sequence shows us what truly &quot;bad guys&quot; these men are. I can't for the life of me figure out why they cut this scene down. The funboy extended scene was also great. It showed him going absolutely insane on drugs and you could see why he did the things he did. The shootout at Top Dollar's lair was the weakest of the three with just a few alternate takes and extended takes of the shootout, but it does have one great line delivered by Brandon that was not in the theatrical release. There is also a deleted scenes montage (similar to the one in Gladiator), which could have been great, but it looked like they put it together in about 5 minutes. Couple nice shots of Brandon though within.The Jeff Most commentary is OK with some funny and interesting side stories, but he just talks and talks and talks. The point of a commentary is to tell little stories about what the viewer is watching at the time AND still be able to see and hear what is going on in the movie! Sheesh!The most noticeable ommission from this dvd is NO DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY. This is a real drag. According to David Schow, the main writer of the film, Alex Proyas had indeed completed a commentary for the film, which was to originally be included. There was some in-fighting between the producer, Miramax and Alex, which I won't go into, and ultimately Alex was pulled from the disc. VERY sad for the fans. Maybe in 2 years, for the Crow's 10 year anniversary, we will get a better disc with the Crow Chronicles and the Commentaries included this time. What do you say guys, can we put our feelings aside and do something for the fans for a change??It would have also been nice to see the skull cowboy footage (shown very briefly in the deleted scenes montage) which is on the CD-Rom and also it would have been nice to see Brandon's &quot;Complete&quot; last interview. Even though this has been shown elsewhere, it's nice to have this stuff neatly packaged together. I hear that there is a moment where Brandon is talking about &quot;safety&quot; on movie sets and how no one should get hurt doing movies. Very eerie. No wonder Miramax won't give us this.The featurette is not good. It's just a re-hash of interviews from 1993 with very little new material. This could of and should have been much better if the Crow Chronicles had been included, but it wasn't because of more Hollywood nonsense.The James O'Barr interview is good and for the first time, James really opens up. He's just a little dry and uncomfortable in front of the camera, but if you can get past this, this is really pretty good.Other extras: There are some alternate Crow poster concepts that were really cool to check out. I hope one of these shows up in auction sometime. The storyboards and conceptual art included was also neat to see, but ultimately a &quot;one time&quot; viewing in my opinion. It would have been nice to see some unpublished photos of Brandon and some behind the scenes stuff from on-set photographer Robert Zuckerman. I REALLY wish they would have included these. I don't have a dvd-rom so I was unable to check out the other goodies. I REALLY wish they would stop putting dvd-rom stuff on dvd's. Just put it on the disc so I can watch it all in ONE PLACE!!! Why do I have to watch most everything from my dvd player and then take the disc out and put it in my computer to see the rest?

361977,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,6303187064,Daniel K.,"[2, 2]","The Crow is based on the dark comic series by James O'Barr.  The film was directed by Alex Proyas who later made Dark City and the upcoming feature I, Robot, which is due out July 16, 2004.  The Crow is a stunning film, its visuals are dazzling.  This film of course is always remembered for the sad and unfortunate death of Brandon Lee, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee.  Brandon Lee had emerged and stunned us with this great performance and if he had lived he could have had a promising and grand career as an action star.Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven, a rock musician who is brutally murdered along with his fiancee.  A year later he comes back to life by the powers of a crow and the crow guides him as he seeks revenge for those who took away his life.  The movie does turn simply into a revenge flick, but it is a quite stunning one.  This film features some great action sequences and Lee as I stated earlier gives a great performance.  The film was released in 1994 and spawned two sequels, neither were as good as the original, infact the third went straight to video.  Due to Lee's unfortunate death, the filmmakers were able to finish the film using digital technology by what they had filmed of Lee's performance so the film could be released.  Proyas released the film to honor and in tribute of his death, some where upset by this but others think it was good of him.  This is a great film and I'm pleased to say it is a part of my DVD collection.The Crow is rated R for A Great Amount of Strong Violence, Language, Drug Use and Some Sexuality.  The violence is pretty intense and some might be offended or upset by it, after it one can expect that considering this is a dark and gritty film.  The violence includes the use of guns, knives, swords as well as fisticuffs.  There's also use of profanity, most of which is strong, and some drug use.

After wanting to see The Crow for years, I finally got it as a gift for Christmas and saw it.As a first time viewing, I rather enjoyed the movie. It wasn't a case where I felt the movie dragged on or it was getting hard to get through certain parts of the movie.The Crow deals with the murder of guitarist Eric Draven and his soon-to-be wife (literally, they were getting married the next day) by a gang of thugs around Halloween. One year later, Eric is brought back by the titular Crow so that he can avenge his fiance's and his own murders.Watching the movie, I could tell it was the kind of movie that you just know was never destined for blockbuster status but rather being a cult classic. Not a bad thing, of course, just an observation.I thought Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, and Rochelle Davis (who sadly seems only did two movies, fifteen years apart) all did a great job throughout the movie. The head villain in this also did a good job at exuding and being a slimy evil crime boss.Having never seen the movie on VHS or DVD, I can't compare but I thought the blu-ray quality looked nice.Bottom line, it's worth a viewing if you've never seen it.",4,Good Cult Movie,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,1336,"['Crow', 'one', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'always', 'heard', 'lot', 'often', 'heard', 'sad', 'story', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'dying', 'filming', 'accident', 'never', 'saw', 'wanting', 'see', 'Crow', 'years', 'finally', 'got', 'gift', 'Christmas', 'saw', 'it.As', 'first', 'time', 'viewing', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'where', 'felt', 'movie', 'dragged', 'was', 'getting', 'hard', 'get', 'certain', 'parts', 'movie.The', 'Crow', 'murder', 'guitarist', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'soon-to-be', 'wife', 'literally', 'were', 'getting', 'married', 'next', 'day', 'gang', 'thugs', 'Halloween', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'Eric', 'brought', 'back', 'titular', 'Crow', 'can', 'avenge', 'fiance', 'own', 'murders.Watching', 'movie', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'kind', 'movie', 'just', 'know', 'was', 'never', 'destined', 'blockbuster', 'status', 'rather', 'being', 'cult', 'classic', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'course', 'just', 'observation.I', 'thought', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Rochelle', 'Davis', 'who', 'sadly', 'only', 'did', 'two', 'movies', 'fifteen', 'years', 'apart', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'head', 'villain', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'exuding', 'being', 'slimy', 'evil', 'crime', 'boss.Having', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'thought', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'looked', 'nice.Bottom', 'line', 'viewing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen']",N/A

You could show this movie to a person who has never seen it before and they would never guess that it was made in 1994. It is that good! I don't think there could have been a better casting job on this movie, every actor/actress performed their characters roll extremely well. The top two performances IMO are Brandon Lee and Michael Wincott. Brandon did excellent as the Crow and Michael was the perfect villan boss as Top Dollar. With a dark, B&W; comic book feel to it, The Crow is one of the best revenge movies ever made. It is definitly one of my favorite movies!In Detroit on Devils night, the night before Halloween, the city becomes a playground for arsons, thugs, and criminals as they run rampant throughout the city unleashing their evil and carnage upon anything and everything. Eric Draven and his fiancee Shelly Webster fall victim on this night in their apartment to a gang of thugs. Eric was shot and thrown from his window on the top floor of the building and Shelly was raped and beaten to a pulp, both of them died from their injuries. Two people who loved each other dearly and couldn't be happier had everything tragically taken away from them the day before they were to marry. They say sometimes when a tragedy is so severe, the crow carrying the soul of the departed returns the soul so that they may put the wrong things right.Eric comes back one year later crawling out of his grave guided by the crow. Discovering his newly inherited powers, Eric, with the help of the crow, sets out to find the thugs who robbed him of his life to return the favor. Starting with Tin-Tin, one of the guys who murdered him and his fiancee, he begins his quest for revenge, working his way from man to man until there is one left. However, Eric soon discovers that the city's top criminal kingpin has the last man in his custody as it turns out that the gang works for him and he was the one who gave the green light for the murder of him and Shelly. So Eric now has to deal with a criminal druglord and all of his minions. Even with the power of the Crow, will it be enough?...This is tied with another movie for my favorite movie of all time. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking it was the coolest movie ever! The only thing bad about this movie is that it was Brandon Lee's last movie as there was a tragic accident while making this movie that cost Lee his life. This movie was really close to being scrapped, but Eliza, Brandon's fiancee, gave her blessings to have them finish the movie knowing that Brandon would of want it that way. So at the beginning of the movie is a tribute for Brandon and Eliza. Some say it was the curse of the Lee family, First Bruce Lee and then his son Brandon, but I think that is rediculous. They also done well to finish the movie with movie magic as it wasn't quite finish yet after the death of Brandon.

The point, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it; emphasizes Lee's death.The movie itself emphasizes a rock and roll theme which is absent in the comic because sound can only be transferred over though words. It's natural for such a dark comic to breed dark music but there is also a wonderful collection of soft, harmonizing music that helps the tone of the story greatly.For a dark story it is replete with humor, mixed together with violence, poetic prose, and strong messages about life, death and doing what you can in the time that is given to us.

361999,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,6303187064,FNDNreview,"[1, 1]","Before the current wave of superhero comic book films, like Marvel's Avengers and The Dark Knight series, comic book franchises had really been a hit or miss endeavor - so much so that most directors wanted nothing to do with them.  Richard Donner started a whole new trend of comic book films with Superman and it went from there.  Filmmakers set out to make superhero films because they dared not just to make a great film for comic book fans - but also films that they thought everyone would go see.  After the Superman films fizzled out in the 80s, filmmakers turned to other characters in the 90s, like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Batman.  However, one particular film from that mid-90s era is completely overlooked and doesn't typically appear on most fans' Top 10 comic book film lists:  The Crow.Created by James O'Barr and adapted to film in 1994, The Crow tells the story of Eric Draven and his fianc&eacute;e, Sarah, a couple brutally beaten and murdered by a local gang.  One year after his death, Eric returns from the dead, with immunity to physical harm, to take revenge upon the gang members responsible for the death of him and his former bride-to-be.The Crow is a standalone story revolving around the brutal death of a couple - who are literally a day away from being married.  It's heartbreaking and tragic, but at the same time, it's action-packed, anti-hero entertainment by a characterl that wanted nothing more than to be happily married, even though the world around him was already in despair.  The Crow is a difficult story about love and vengeance.  With that being said, it is entirely possible audiences weren't entirely ready for this character.By 1994, audiences were already introduced to Tim Burton's darker rendition of the Dark Knight, and a more realistic - and again dark - version of the Ninja Turtles.  Keeping with that same dark and dreary theme, The Crow still struggled to match-up (box office-wise) to these mirrored versions of Batman and the Turtles.  Was it because people didn't know The Crow?  It's possible.  However, unlike the loveable turtles or the caped crusader, The Crow is a visually hard to digest story and at times, is a very depressing story.Regardless of the box office outcome (which is still considered to be a success), Brandon Lee, the late son of the legendary Bruce Lee, gave one of the greatest comic book performances to this day.  If you think Heath Ledger was the first person to make crazy look cool, then you're encouraged to take another look at Brandon Lee's performance in The Crow.  Unfortunately, Lee's accidental death during the shooting of the film cast a dark cloud over this film.  Knowing that Lee dies during one of the scenes in the film makes it hard enough to watch the film without taking the story into account, and his death alone could very well be one of the biggest reason's that The Crow  has become a long forgotten gem in a genre full of duds.Overall Film Grade:  AFNDNreview.com",5,'The Crow' a comic adapted gem,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2988,"['current', 'wave', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'series', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises', 'had', 'really', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'endeavor', 'so', 'much', 'most', 'directors', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'started', 'whole', 'new', 'trend', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'Superman', 'went', 'there', 'Filmmakers', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'superhero', 'films', 'dared', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'also', 'films', 'thought', 'everyone', 'would', 'go', 'see', 'Superman', 'films', 'fizzled', 'out', '80s', 'filmmakers', 'turned', 'other', 'characters', '90s', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'Batman', 'However', 'one', 'particular', 'film', 'mid-90s', 'era', 'completely', 'overlooked', ""n't"", 'typically', 'appear', 'most', 'fans', 'Top', '10', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'lists', 'Crow.Created', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'adapted', 'film', '1994', 'Crow', 'story', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sarah', 'couple', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'murdered', 'local', 'gang', 'One', 'year', 'death', 'Eric', 'dead', 'immunity', 'physical', 'harm', 'take', 'revenge', 'gang', 'members', 'responsible', 'death', 'former', 'bride-to-be.The', 'Crow', 'standalone', 'story', 'revolving', 'brutal', 'death', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'literally', 'day', 'away', 'being', 'married', 'heartbreaking', 'tragic', 'same', 'time', 'action-packed', 'anti-hero', 'entertainment', 'characterl', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'happily', 'married', 'even', 'world', 'was', 'already', 'despair', 'Crow', 'difficult', 'story', 'love', 'vengeance', 'being', 'said', 'entirely', 'possible', 'audiences', 'were', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'ready', 'character.By', '1994', 'audiences', 'were', 'already', 'introduced', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'darker', 'rendition', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'more', 'realistic', 'again', 'dark', 'version', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'Keeping', 'same', 'dark', 'dreary', 'theme', 'Crow', 'still', 'struggled', 'match-up', 'office-wise', 'mirrored', 'versions', 'Batman', 'Turtles', 'Was', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Crow', 'possible', 'However', 'loveable', 'turtles', 'caped', 'crusader', 'Crow', 'visually', 'hard', 'digest', 'story', 'times', 'very', 'depressing', 'story.Regardless', 'box', 'office', 'outcome', 'still', 'considered', 'be', 'success', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'late', 'son', 'legendary', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'gave', 'one', 'greatest', 'comic', 'book', 'performances', 'day', 'think', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'make', 'crazy', 'look', 'cool', 'then', ""'re"", 'encouraged', 'take', 'look', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'performance', 'Crow', 'Unfortunately', 'Lee', 'accidental', 'death', 'shooting', 'film', 'cast', 'dark', 'cloud', 'film', 'Knowing', 'Lee', 'one', 'scenes', 'film', 'hard', 'enough', 'watch', 'film', 'taking', 'story', 'account', 'death', 'alone', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'reason', 'Crow', 'become', 'long', 'forgotten', 'gem', 'genre', 'full', 'duds.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'AFNDNreview.com']",N/A

I saw it when it was first released and was mesmerized by it for its unique style and by the death of Lee. I returned to it and I have watched several times once again this year. Film making has changed since this film was first released and that is what makes this film stand out. It almost looks like an artificial Gothic horror film, something very dark, something very strange, something very different, not artificial at all in reality. The characters are real, yet they seem to exist in a very unreal world, and there is its strength, its life. Its nightmarish quality is hard to shake. It looks like it came from another time, another era, all its own. It does not fit nicely into any genre. It is all its own. Brandon Lee's Eric Draven is such a powerful, subtle, vengeful, remorseful and tragic figure that he is almost hard to watch. I do not think I have ever seen such a performance.

362006,A1H7IQM3WMOF11,6303187064,"Heather Richards ""darkjediqueen""","[2, 2]","The irony of The Crow is that part of its mystique comes from the tragic death of Brandon Lee during filming. There's no way of knowing if the movie would have been the cult hit that it is if he had gone on to make other movies. What is undisputed is that this movie has an eerie power all its own in spite of the much talked about tragedy.Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven, a young musician killed with his fiancee on Devil's Night by a band of ruthless thugs. None of the killers are brought to justice and exactly a year later, Draven returns as The Crow, an immortal being bent on claiming justice for his dead fiancee by doing away with their murderers. Donning white makeup and a black outfit held together with electrical tape, The Crow goes about destroying those who hurt his loved ones.It's hard to separate the movie from actual events during filming, but one thing is for certain, Brandon Lee was at his finest in this film. He effectively plays a heartbroken lover, merciless vigilante, and caring father figure to the young girl he and his fiancee took care of, all at once. Draven is ruthless, but very likable and sympathetic. Injected with a dry sense of humor, Draven is trying to tie up loose ends, be they of the justice type or the emotional as he tries to keep Sarah safe. Lee made a character that could have been just a plain vigilante into something you care about. This is his movie, and while it's hard to say whether he would have become a star because of it, he definately deserved to become one from the performance. The movie itself is a nightmare of urban decay and crime. Everything is dark and ominous and Draven fits right into the scenery. The movie is at its heart a love story between Draven and his fiancee. Everything he does, all the pain he goes through and puts other people through, is for her. Draven is a kind, loving man turned into a weapon of justice by death, yet it's still all for his fiancee, which he makes plain.This movie about death and love has taken on a life of its own with events, yet it possibly is the greatest tribute to Brandon Lee as an actor that he could have.",5,Dark and Disturbingly Powerful,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,2125,"['irony', 'Crow', 'part', 'mystique', 'tragic', 'death', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'filming', 'way', 'knowing', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cult', 'hit', 'had', 'gone', 'make', 'other', 'movies', 'What', 'undisputed', 'movie', 'eerie', 'power', 'own', 'spite', 'much', 'talked', 'tragedy.Brandon', 'Lee', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'young', 'musician', 'killed', 'fiancee', 'Devil', 'Night', 'band', 'ruthless', 'thugs', 'None', 'killers', 'are', 'brought', 'justice', 'exactly', 'year', 'later', 'Draven', 'Crow', 'immortal', 'being', 'bent', 'claiming', 'justice', 'dead', 'fiancee', 'doing', 'away', 'murderers', 'Donning', 'white', 'makeup', 'black', 'outfit', 'held', 'together', 'electrical', 'tape', 'Crow', 'destroying', 'who', 'hurt', 'loved', 'ones.It', 'hard', 'separate', 'movie', 'actual', 'events', 'filming', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'was', 'finest', 'film', 'effectively', 'heartbroken', 'lover', 'merciless', 'vigilante', 'caring', 'father', 'figure', 'young', 'girl', 'fiancee', 'took', 'care', 'once', 'Draven', 'ruthless', 'very', 'likable', 'sympathetic', 'Injected', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'Draven', 'trying', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'be', 'justice', 'type', 'emotional', 'keep', 'Sarah', 'safe', 'Lee', 'made', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'plain', 'vigilante', 'something', 'care', 'movie', 'hard', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'star', 'definately', 'deserved', 'become', 'one', 'performance', 'movie', 'nightmare', 'urban', 'decay', 'crime', 'Everything', 'dark', 'ominous', 'Draven', 'fits', 'right', 'scenery', 'movie', 'heart', 'love', 'story', 'Draven', 'fiancee', 'Everything', 'pain', 'other', 'people', 'Draven', 'kind', 'loving', 'man', 'turned', 'weapon', 'justice', 'death', 'still', 'fiancee', 'plain.This', 'movie', 'death', 'love', 'taken', 'life', 'own', 'events', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'tribute', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'actor', 'could', 'have']",N/A

One year later, Eric's restless soul is carried by a crow and he returns from the dead to seek revenge on the thugs that murdered him and raped his girlfriend and left her to die.

Eric also helps Shelly's friend Sarah (who is about twelve years old) develop a relationship with her drug addicted mother. Eric has two days to make things right before he returns to the grave, can he make it? I highly recommend that you watch and see for yourself.

Alex Proyas is an excellent director but this is his weakest effort of the 2 movies of his that I have seen. Dark City is a masterpiece digging into your minds days after you watch it. This movie isn't thought provoking, is predictable and is very dark. Batman is Barney compared to this. This movie is always dark. But, most of this movie's faults don't really matter because it's a superhero movie. At the start of all superhero movies, you know what's going to happen. But, I like superhero movies, as they deliver good laughs and awesome fights. This movie wasn't funny and wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be dark. And it was. Superhero movies are the easiest to make because they're croud pleasing as long as they have cool fights and awesome visuals. Who cares if it's mindless junk? It's still fun.But, this movie was really dark. It is a solid rental for fan of superhero movies but beware, it has over the top violence and curse words unlike other superhero movies. But, Blade had curse words and lots of violence but I still loved it. Well, I just don't know, but this movie was slow moving, weird and too violent. On top of it, there aren't really any cool fight scenes.In one shootout, the crow (not the bird, the superhero) shoots and kills everyone. But, he gets shot at also but he's invincible and can't die. This scene is lame because bullets just go through him and he deosn't die and just shoots them.The movie is fun and exciting at times but most of the time, it's weird, really violent and way too dark. This movie isn't like the other superhero movies. No this one is infested with drugs, nonstop blood and gore, and lots of weird stuff.This movie could have been an excellent movie but to me, it was a movie that was a descent watch that I'll never rewatch again.The only reason that this movie is probably famous is because of the tragedy that befell Brandon Lee in it. This is something horrifying and tragic, and bizarre.And don't even get me started about the acting. Good job by Brandon Lee but even he seems to not be into it at all. But all of the other actors/actresses were horrible, notably the skater girl.Lastly, this movie is made in a very corny and cheesy way. Why? Because one minute, the crow will be stabbing people and blowing up buildings and the next he'll be hugging a little girl. Oh and what the heck was up with the crow weird quotes. Why was he talking about the raven by Edgar Allen Poe? Is he supposed to be an intellectual zombie? Oh, and what's up with him talking about God and how God doesn't want people to use heroin. I'm sure he's drugged up in the movie! I mean, he must be on drugs to paint that weird stuff on his face. Sure it's cool looking but he must be high. For a superhero movie, this movie is a major letdown. And that makes it even a bigger letdown because superhero movies are the easiest movies to make. They all are predictable, they all have tons of problems but most are likeable.

I first saw this movie in Paris France a long time ago.  But reason I say it one of my favorite movies is because of a couple of lines within the movie those being ""Real love is forever"", that is at end of the movie, at the start of the movie ""If two people are meant to be together...nothing can keep them apart.""  That is how I feel about my girlfriend because we have together real love and we will be together forever.  So if you like a movie with drama, lots of action, great gun fight scene (scene being where Brandon Lee lost his life because of the real bullet in one of the guns), and mutiple visuals that will take your breathe away.  Two scenes for myself was the Brandon Lee hanging on the broken window in the loft, and the crow scene near the water where it's lit up with gasoline.  Another scene I enjoy lot was him walking into the Church great visual.  But for being a dark movie with lots of bad elements it is by far a very powerful movie and will keep your intrest from start to finish, bonus note to add the soundtrack is as amazing as the movie so pick that up as well with the movie.",5,One of my favorite movies in my collection because of the message it has,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,1234,"['Crow', 'far', 'one', 'single', 'favorite', 'movies', 'collection', 'message', 'fans', 'movie', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'Paris', 'France', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'reason', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'couple', 'lines', 'movie', 'being', 'Real', 'love', 'forever', 'end', 'movie', 'start', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'nothing', 'can', 'keep', 'apart', 'how', 'feel', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'together', 'real', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'together', 'forever', 'So', 'like', 'movie', 'drama', 'lots', 'action', 'great', 'gun', 'fight', 'scene', 'scene', 'being', 'where', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'lost', 'life', 'real', 'bullet', 'one', 'guns', 'mutiple', 'visuals', 'will', 'take', 'breathe', 'away', 'Two', 'scenes', 'myself', 'was', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'hanging', 'broken', 'window', 'loft', 'crow', 'scene', 'water', 'where', 'lit', 'up', 'gasoline', 'scene', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'was', 'walking', 'Church', 'great', 'visual', 'being', 'dark', 'movie', 'lots', 'bad', 'elements', 'far', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'intrest', 'start', 'finish', 'bonus', 'note', 'add', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'amazing', 'movie', 'so', 'pick', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'movie']",N/A

362016,AQ01Q3070LT29,6303187064,James McDonald,"[2, 3]","Something happened in Eric's apartment on October 30.  Here it is known as Devil's night.  Ernie Hudson plays the cop in charge of the scene of the crime.  Shelly Webster has been hurt badly and Eric Draven is dead outside on the sidewalk.  It appears he has crashed through the window above.  Sarah is a girl that Shelly took care of.One year later, Sarah visits the graves of Shelly and Eric.  She puts a bunch of flowers on Shelly's and a white rose on Eric's.  There is a crow sitting on Eric Draven's tombstone. (Notice Draven has ""raven"" in it).  Sarah asks the crow, ""What are you the night watchman?"".  Indeed he is.  Later the ground is lifting above Eric's grave.  It is Eric (Brandon Lee), who looks normal, trying to get out of the ground from his coffin.  he lets out a primal scream.  It is raining hard.  He goes back to his apartment.  Everything was left as it was a year ago.  it is filthy.  Window was never boarded.  His crow flies with him everywhere he walks.  Eric's white cat, Gabriel, is still there who recognizes him.  Eric begins to have total recall of what happened to him and his fiancee in the apartment.  When Eric touches the broken window, both of his hands are cut with blood coming out.  But they heal before his eyes.  Eric has manifested.  he decides he must get revenge.  he puts on white clown make-up with black on his lips.  He will now hunt down those thugs with his guide The Crow.This film is gritty, rainy and dark.  It sets the mood real well.  Gothic!Numerous gritty, rock n' roll films have been made, but The Crow (1994) was the first of its kind.I do not like the drug use and foolish sex in this film.  But I do enjoy the long, continuous scenes as you fly like The Crow.Sadly, Brandon Lee was doing a scene (March 30, 1992) where he was continuously being shot at.  A faulty prop gun had shot him in the abdomen.  The cap of a blank had lodged into his spine after entering his abdomen.  He died the next day.  Brandon Lee's father was Bruce Lee, a martial arts expert and actor who had been in ""The Green Hornet"" tv series and made martial arts films as well.  His father had died in 1973 from a brain edema and marihuana was found in his stomach.Since Brandon Lee died, they used a stand-in and spent over $3000,000 to computerize Brandon's face on the stand-in to make new scenes to finish the film.  This technique was later perfected and became known as CGI effects in the film, TWISTER (1996).Followed by two horrible sequels:The Crow - City of Angels (Collector's Series)(1996) with Vincent Perez.The Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete Series(1998) tv series.The Crow - Salvation (Dimension Collector's Series)(2000) with Eric Mabius.The Crow - Wicked Prayer(2005) with Edward Furlong.On this VHS, ""The Making of The Crow"" is followed after the movie.

I had heard things about this movie for just about all of my life, but just never felt like picking it up. I had heard about how dark the art and story is, and about how Brandon Lee died during filming, but I knew absolutely nothing about the story, and did not know what to expect when the movie started playing. I think this is probably the best way to go into a movie, and I was very pleased.The movie's artistic direction, along with Brandon Lee's performance, make The Crow enjoyable for the entire 2 hours, and the action and violence keeps you glued to the screen.My only complaint is with the story, which I understand they had to cut character development scenes and rewrite other scenes to finish after Brandon Lee's untimely death. It is a typical story mostly, of a man who comes back from the dead to avenge his girlfriends death. The story is mainly just there as a reason for him to be going about killing various people.

Well I can tell that I've almost seen every movie with Brandon Lee playing in it... Although he only played in (mostly) action movies he played his best part in ""The Crow""... I watched the movie the first time right after it was released. I've always been a big fan of Bruce Lee his father but also of Brandon Lee because he didn't want people to see him like his father. Brandon always wanted to play in a non-action movie and I know The Crow is one of those... His acting in this movie is good... I know they use a lot of CGI which is done superb. Yes, the fact that he was really killed in the movie made me see it even more.This is the ultimate movie about vengeance from beyond the grave, good versus evil, wrongs made right, and the power of love conquering all. That last line may sound straight out of a chick flick, but this movie is anything but. Eric Draven is one of the most emotionally deep characters of all time. He drives through the plot with such power and momentum, never letting the adrenaline slow. If you want to see a true artist performing a true work of art, watch Brandon Lee in The Crow. Any artist can recognize the beauty of Brandon Lee's work here. Just like his father, Brandon Lee has mastered the artless art.In addition to Brandon Lee's amazing mastery of Eric Draven, Michael Wincott is incredible as Top Dollar, the villainous leader of the gang infamous for beginning the tradition of Devil's Night. Rochelle Davis's performance as Sarah was superb, despite the fact that ""The Crow"" is the only movie she's ever been in.The Crow is also full of memorable scenes, and quotes. ""It can't rain all the time."" became a household phrase among some of my friends and anyone familiar with the scene will know why I adore ""Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children."" I can truthfully say that this is one of the better made films in all of the years since ""The Crow"" came out in 1994. It has a special magic that I sorely miss in today's movies.

362024,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6303187064,J from NY,"[2, 2]","I've seen ""The Crow"" so many times (anyone who was around 13 when this movie came out should understand) that one would think it only natural for a person of that generation to have come to a conclusion about the moral of the story, a final judgment of the film.  This would be presumptuous.Eric Draven, a young man very much in love with his wife, Shelley Webyster, is dealt a cruel hand in every sense of that term; he is forced to watch while a group of (believably) degenerate thugs rape her as he dies from a quick knife wound.Resurrected from the dead by forces we never get to understand fully, Draven dishes out grisly punishment just as bad as he got.  Painting his face up with his wife's wedding makeup (the symbolism here is beautiful, and all of it is owed to James O' Barr's masterpiece graphic novel of the same name), he possesses powers of recuperation and invulnerability to pain that can only be characterized as divine.The cinematography here is perfect; when Draven is leaping across the rooftops, just understanding precisely what he is and how he came back from the dead, Nine Inch Nails gives their try at ""Dead Souls"" by Joy Division.  It works.  Perhaps the most representative seen of the whole film is where he confronts Tin Tin before killing him, the urge toward vengeance pumping through his veins like a steroid from high above.Draven inhabits a remorseless dark night of a world in which ghosts are certainly not believed in.  (Too bad for the boss and everyone else.)  Rain falls constantly, and the director did a perfect job of starting a new Goth trend that was alternately corny and stylish.  In the end, we cannot fault Draven for his actions; and the people he eliminates are one step above animals.  This is a Shakespearean tale of absolute wrath.I often wondered if this would have been so popular if the unfortunate Brandon Lee had not been killed during filming accidentally.  I still think it would have.  I remember every line from this film almost verbatim, just from repeated viewings with friends.

362025,A2GVJ83F092MIS,6303187064,J. Hayes,"[3, 3]","Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven in this story of revenge and justice. Eric Draven and his fiancee are alone on &quot;Devil's Night&quot; which has been named that because of the crime and arson that goes on in the city. Devil's Night takes place on the night before Halloween. Eric and his fiancee are interrupted by a group of thugs that rape and kill Eric's fiancee in front of him, and then proceed to kill him. Now the idea of The Crow is this; when a person dies, a crow carries their soul to the afterlife, but sometimes the crow will bring the person back for unfinished business. Guided by the crow, Draven returns to exact revenge on those responsible for the rape and murders, and he targets each and every person involved. He returns as a tortured soul, bent on revenge for taking the life that he and his fiancee Shelly wanted to live, a life that was taken from them for no reason.Along the way Eric is helped by Sargeant Albrecht, who is the only one who truly cared about bringing the killers to justice. Every time Eric kills one, the task at hand gets harder as he gets to the source of the evil.This is a superb film, perfect in every way in my opinion. It is dark, graphic and I would even go so far to call this a true masterpiece of American cinema. Brandon Lee plays his role with a passion, truly giving the dark feel of this film and the message behind it. It really is a shame that he died, I think he would have been a great actor. But this is his legacy, and it is a great legacy to leave behind. I have not seen the 2 sequels yet, but I am fairly certain this is the best one. I encourage you to see this movie if you haven't already.The dvd itself is packed with extras that take an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the film as well as other things. The movie really sounds great turned way up on a surround system, and the picture quality is great.I should also mention the soundtrack to the movie, which is one of the best I have ever heard. Seeing this will make you want to buy the soundtrack, it is just that cool. My only regret about this movie is that I didnt see it sooner. So I have given my opinion, and I really recommend that you see this movie. If it isn't considered one already, it will go down as a true classic in cinema for the rest of time.",5,A truly dark masterpiece!,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2292,"['Brandon', 'Lee', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'story', 'revenge', 'justice', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'fiancee', 'are', 'alone', 'quot', 'Devil', 'Night', 'quot', 'been', 'named', 'crime', 'arson', 'city', 'Devil', 'Night', 'place', 'night', 'Halloween', 'Eric', 'fiancee', 'are', 'interrupted', 'group', 'thugs', 'rape', 'kill', 'Eric', 'fiancee', 'front', 'then', 'proceed', 'kill', 'Now', 'idea', 'Crow', 'when', 'person', 'crow', 'soul', 'afterlife', 'sometimes', 'crow', 'will', 'bring', 'person', 'back', 'unfinished', 'business', 'Guided', 'crow', 'Draven', 'exact', 'revenge', 'responsible', 'rape', 'murders', 'person', 'involved', 'tortured', 'soul', 'bent', 'revenge', 'taking', 'life', 'fiancee', 'Shelly', 'wanted', 'live', 'life', 'was', 'taken', 'reason.Along', 'way', 'Eric', 'helped', 'Sargeant', 'Albrecht', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'truly', 'cared', 'bringing', 'killers', 'justice', 'time', 'Eric', 'one', 'task', 'hand', 'harder', 'source', 'evil.This', 'superb', 'film', 'perfect', 'way', 'opinion', 'dark', 'graphic', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'call', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'American', 'cinema', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'role', 'passion', 'truly', 'giving', 'dark', 'feel', 'film', 'message', 'really', 'shame', 'died', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'actor', 'legacy', 'great', 'legacy', 'leave', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '2', 'sequels', 'yet', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'best', 'one', 'encourage', 'see', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'already.The', 'dvd', 'packed', 'extras', 'take', 'interesting', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'really', 'great', 'turned', 'way', 'up', 'surround', 'system', 'picture', 'quality', 'great.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Seeing', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'cool', 'only', 'regret', 'movie', 'didnt', 'see', 'sooner', 'So', 'have', 'given', 'opinion', 'really', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'considered', 'one', 'already', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'true', 'classic', 'cinema', 'rest', 'time']",N/A

362029,AK81WLVD5KGUX,6303187064,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[1, 1]","In the history of screen adaptations of comic books, Alex Proyas's adaptation of James O'Barr's underground comic _The Crow_ is one of the finest. I like Marvel Comics a lot and I've enjoyed most of the recent adaptations of the Marvel catalogue. But in comics-to-screen-land, I have _three_ favorite Lees: Stan, Ang, and the late Brandon.(Brandon Lee, as most visitors to this page will already know, died tragically as this film was being produced. That's a terrible loss and it adds an even darker edge to an already dark film.)Alex Proyas, who would later give us the haunting noir-SF _Dark City_, here turns his directorial hand to bringing _The Crow_ to (heh heh) life. The film recalls all the best elements of Tim Burton's first _Batman_ film and, I think, outdoes its predecessor by quite a bit.You probably already know the plot here. Rock musician Eric Draven (d'Raven; get it?) and his fiancee Shelly Webster are brutally murdered on Devil's Night (the night before Halloween). Exactly one year later, Draven returns temporarily to life in order to exact revenge on the thugs who murdered them. Which he does, very stylishly.Dressed in Goth black and with his face painted white, he comes across as something like a vampire, something like a one-man combination of Batman and the Joker, and something like the old comic book hero the Spectre (remember? murdered policeman Jim Corrigan returned from the dead?). The whole thing is calculated, in the old Batman phrase, to strike terror into the hearts of evildoers, and so is Draven's remarkable healing ability: since his wounds close over just about as fast as they're formed, he's all but unstoppable.Anyway, the overarching theme is that love is eternal, but along the way we get to see a lot of dark and gratifying violence as the bad guys get what's coming to them.The cast and the script are magnificent. Of course the late Brandon Lee steals the show. But everybody else is good too, including the bird.The cinematography is brilliant. Everything is muted into almost pure black and white, with occasional touches of red. The cityscape is wonderfully realized, fitting somewhere between Burton's Gotham and Proyas's own Dark City. And it always seems to be raining. On top of all that, the entire thing is lifted high into the (night) sky by Graeme Revell's otherworldly score.If you like noir fantasy, don't miss this one.

The movie starts off with Cops investigating a crime scene in an apartment where a couple have been killed named Eric Draven & Shelly Webster Eric was shot, stabbed & thrown out the window this group of thugs named T Bird, Tin Tin, Funboy &S  k  an  k. They assaulted Shelly & beat her. Officer Albercht had Shelly taken to the hospital. He runs into this Skateboarding Girl named Sarah Eric & Shelly were Father & Mother figures for her cause she has no Father & her Mother is a dug addict & is with 1 of the men that killed Eric Shelly Funboy. A year later Eric Draven comes back from the dead along with a bird companion. Cause if 2 people love each other die under tragic circumstances & nothings been done 1 will come back to put the wrong things right. Eric is led to his old apartment you even have Eric & Shelly's Cat remember him he figures out what he has to do. Then you go to Officer Albercht who has really been taking care of Sarah T Bird & his gang attacked Arcade Games & have blown it up with the owner still inside. Draven has painted his face & when he's getting ready a really good son is playing ""Burn"" by The Cure. Eric finds this man named Tin Tin he confronts him he throws knives at Eric he catches them or throws them out of the way. He takes a knife & tells Tin Tin ""Victim's aren't we all?"" He messes up Tin bad. The villains in The Crow are entertaining they're in this bar & they yell ""FIRE IT UP! FIRE IT UP!"" They're putting bullets in their mouth & washing them down with their booze. The lead Villain Top Dollar played by Michael Wincott a guy that doesn't get who doesn't get any respect in Hollywood. He has some good lines when he's told by T Bird that Tin Tin has been killed Top Dollar says ""Well gentlemen, by all means, I think we oughta have an introspective moment of silence for poor ol Tin Tin."" Or what he tells his Girlfriend-Sister when he has this Snow Globe ""Dad gave me this 5th Birthday. He said Childhoods over the moment you know you're going to die."" Anyway you have Eric go to this Pawn Shop headed by a man named Gideon which criminals use this Pawn Shop to sell items they stole from their victims. Gideon shoots Eric his reaction to him not being harmed is very funny. Eric finds The Engagement Ring he gave Shelly & his old guitar which I like how character traits they keep for the character when they were alive. Eric points a Shotgun at Gideon he tells him everyone involved who killed him & Shelly. He pours gas all over the place he tells Gideon to tell that crew that death is coming for them he says ""Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards."" Before he leaves he asks ""is that gasoline I semll?"" He fires The Shotgun at puddles of gas blowing up The Pawn Shop. The Police found Tin Tin & while looking around they find a Crow symbol in blood. Officer Alberct runs into Eric Draven he asks him if he likes his coat cause he got from Tin Tin he tells him ""He was a friend that shouldn't have played with knives."" He tells him that Tin Tin & everyone in the gang is dead they just don't know it. That causes Officer Albercht to look into The Eric Draven & Shelly Webster murder case that hasn't been solved. Eric also saves Sarah from being ran over & she tells him that she wished it would stop raining he replies ""It can't rain all the time."" Which was a song in Eric's bang Hangman's Joke. The Crow leads him to Funboy Where he & his Girlfriend Darla Sarah's Mom are getting high. Funboy pulls his gun out at Eric he puts his hand on the barrel & let's him shoot but he shows him that he can't be hurt. Eric has this telepathy power & uses it to Funboy feel the pain that he put them through. Funboy accidentally shoots himself he drags him to the bathroom where Darla comes at him with a straight razor he grabs her & gets through to her he cleanses her of the drugs in her system & he tells her to go home her Daughter is waiting for her she storms out of there Top Dollar's Right Hand Man checks on Funboy he finds him dead & he has all these needles in him with all these drugs injected to him. Top Dollar knows someone is after him Gideon tells him what happened to his Pawn Shop & Top Dollar's Right Hand Man tells him what happened to Funboy. Top Dollar kills Gideon. Eric chats with Officer Albercht he tells Eric that he stayed with Shelly until she died he hoped she would make it out of it so she could tell him something so he could arrest the people who did it. Eric uses his telepathy & he finds out he's telling the truth. T Bird &S  k  an  k go to this Convince Store to get some smokes & beer while T Bird is in his Car Eric is waiting for him he puts a gun to his head & makes T Bird drive to the docks & S  k  an  k sees what's going on he runs out & is stuck by a car the motorist starts cussing him out he beats him up & steals his vehicle. The Police get into the chase. 1 thing leads to another The Cops &S  k  an  k crash into each other. Eric tapes T Bird to the seat of the car he places an explosive between T Birds legs he puts the car in gear before it goes into the river it explodes in mid air then Eric leaves a flaming a Crow symbol  which if you read my Punisher 04 review I said they got the flaming skull idea from this movie. Officer Albercht is suspended for misconduct cause his superior thinks that he's in with the person killing all these gang members. Sarah & her Mom start to have normal relationship. S  k  a  nk has lost his mind after what happened to T Bird & this scene is funny he's running around yelling & Top Dollar says we oughta record this & play & play it back on slow mo. Top Dollar calls a meeting with all The Crime Bosses. Eric goes there he tells him he just wants S  k  a  n  k which leads to a great action scene where Brandon Lee just clears house with this awesome song called ""After The Flesh"" by The Thrill Kill Kult. He finally get a hold of S  k  an  k & he tosses him out the window The Police chase after him Albercht helps him out. Eric goes to the Grave Yard he finds Sarah there he tells her why he can't stay. He gives her Shelly's Engagement Ring. Sarah is captured so they can lure Eric to The Church Cause Top Dollar Girlfriend-Sister tells him that you have to kill The Crow to to kill the man. So Top Dollar's Right Hand Man & Top Dollar says to Eric ""Quick impression for you. Caw! Caw! Bang!F  *  *  k I'm DEAD!"" Draven says he just came here to get Sarah & he will be out of here. Top Dollar shoots him Officer Albercht comes in & he gets in shoot out with Top Dollar & his Right Hand Man he kills his Top Dollar's Right Hand Man. They go after Top Dollar his Girlfriend_ Sister shoots Albercht Eric goes after her she has a hold of The Crow it pecks her eyes out & she falls to her death. Eric goes to the top of The Church & Top Dollar takes full advantage of Eric being weakened. Top Dollar even impales Eric with a sword. Top Dollar admits to being behind what happened to he & Shelly. Eric uses his Telepathy on Top Dollar he gives him 30 hours of pain he falls off the roof & is impaled on a Gargoyle Statue. Eric gets Sarah to safety & makes sure Albercht is ok he goes back to the Graveyard where he reunites with Shelly. Sarah visits Eric & Shelly's Graves 1 more time where The Crow gives her Shelly's Engagement Ring.EXCELLENT MOVIE! Closing this The Crow is an awesome movie I have a lead I care about along with 2 side characters I care about. Villains were entertaining. The look of the film is great the action scenes that were in here were great. The score by Graeme Revell is 1 of his better movie scores & the soundtrack is awesome. Alex Poryas did a really good job directing. Brandon Lee did a great job in his final performance. Michael Wincott did a great job. Ernie Hudson did a very good job. Rochelle Davis wasn't an annoying child actress & she did a good job. If you have never seen The Crow you owe it to yourself to see it. It's a classic.

But, what if you had a chance to return to exact vengeance upon whomever was responsible for such an event? This was the basis for the 1994 gothic-infused action film ""The Crow"" based on the comic book created by James O'Barr.""The Crow"" follows the quest for revenge that consumes Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) upon his return from the dead one year after he and his fianc&eacute;e, Shelly, were brutally murdered by a deadly gang. Assisting him in his mission are a mystical crow, a former detective turned beat cop (Ernie Hudson), and a young girl that he and Shelly used to care for. Now, one by one Eric is picking off those responsible for that horrific night, so that his soul may finally know peace. However, the gang isn't willing to just go down without a fight, and their leader (Michael Wincott) has his eye on gaining the supernatural power that drives this new hero.When this film was released it had been two years since Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns"" had met with mixed reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and the comic book movie craze was still years away. So, to adapt a relatively obscure title such as this one, amidst a fickle public regarding dark heroes (audiences embraced Burton's first Batman movie, but shunned the second due to its darker tone); not to mention using a fairly unproven actor as your star, made ""The Crow"" a potentially risky endeavor. Yet, the gamble paid off across the board, and to this day the movie remains one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever created.Charged with adapting this lesser-known comic book into a potential feature film were scribes David J. Schow (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"") and John Shirley (""The Specialist""). Finding success with comic book inspired movies during the nineties was not the easiest of challenges to complete. So, why is it that this comic book movie, dark overtones and all, was able to succeed where many others failed?Well, as with any comic book movie, one of the most important elements that must be present is a respect for the source material, and the willingness to stay as close to said material as possible. Of course, when dealing with not only a dark and gritty source, but also one steeped heavily into the supernatural, staying true could result in an alienation of virtually everyone except for the most ardent of fans. Even so, the writers stayed the course, remained as faithful as possible (there were some changes and omissions, but in my estimation they were for the better) and delivered to audiences a hard-hitting, fast-paced, and undeniably entertaining action flick that succeeded despite the odds.Within the movie's story there are many interesting segments, as any good movie should have over its duration. For many viewers I'm sure the action scenes were some of the most memorable, and of course exciting moments. To me the portions that really sold the movie were the quieter, more introspective scenes that delved deeper into the various characters of the film.For two writers that had previously dealt with either crappy horror sequels or a couple of episodes for Saturday morning cartoons, the amount of solid, intriguing character development was surprising. At the time, it seemed that the mind set for comic book movies was to go bigger, better, and louder with the action sequences, and if the story suffered in the process, so be it. This would prove to be a fatal blow for one of the biggest superhero franchises around at that time; it's just too bad nobody heeded the warning signs to prevent the issue. Thankfully, the writers of ""The Crow"" were wise enough to avoid this type of mistake, thus the movie was able to do well.Two other key aspects to the movie remaining believable and enjoyable were keeping it grounded by terrific performances and having a visually stylistic director. Obviously, getting the story right is paramount for any film to thrive, but when dealing with this type of movie, not having the right director and/or actors can be extremely detrimental no matter how incredible the script.Leading the cast with a star-making performance is actor Brandon Lee (""Rapid Fire""). As Eric Draven, Brandon delivers an excellent performance that is often times full of rage, intensity and sadness, but during the flashbacks we see a fun-loving and caring individual that possesses a charisma that instantly captures your attention. It's that ability to convey such a wide range of emotions in a single performance that would have made Brandon a massive success. Sadly, this rising star was accidentally killed during the filming of this movie, and much like his late father (Bruce Lee), his end came far too soon.In the most noteworthy supporting roles are actors Ernie Hudson (""The Substitute"") and Michael Wincott (""Alien: Resurrection""). Ernie's portrayal of Sergeant Albrecht, an officer who discovers that Eric has returned and assists him in his pursuit for revenge, is plagued by some minor bouts of clich&eacute;d dialogue. Yet, in the end the sincerity and earnestness in his portrayal carried the character well beyond the flaws.As for Michael Wincott's performance, his gravelly and menacing voice helped make him a perfect choice to portray the leader of the gang. Displaying such an obvious disdain for anything good or righteous in this world and a somewhat twisted sense of humor provides for a chilling and memorable performance for Michael, but also an excellent villain for this type of movie.Lastly, serving as the glue that binds all of the various aspects of the movie together is director Alex Proyas (""I, Robot""). Taking an obvious cue from Tim Burton's work on ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", the look of the film is undeniably gothic from the characters to the architecture. To the point, that there are moments that one could begin to wonder if some of the set pieces were simply brought over after those two films wrapped. Beyond the drab look of the film, Proyas moves out from Burton's shadow to create a world consumed by darkness and evil that could arguably be more hopeless than that of Gotham City.Then there's the terrific camera work that gave the movie an even more distinctive style, from the establishing shots of the city via the mystical crow's arrival to the kinetically-charged action sequences that are guaranteed to get the adrenaline pumping. Every scene was well staged and executed to deliver an all-out satisfying experience for moviegoers. Aside from the borrowing of the color pallet from the aforementioned movies (and even that's forgivable), Alex Proyas proved he was the right man to bring this particular comic book adaptation to cinematic life.Featuring a talented cast and great performances, a surprisingly well-conceived story, and action sequences jam-packed with intensity, ""The Crow"" is a thoroughly entertaining action film that absolutely leaves you wanting more.""The Crow"" is rated R for violence, language, sexuality, and brief nudity.",5,Evil Must Be Punished...,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,7102,"['one',

I say perfect cast because everyone remembers Brandon Lee's iconic Eric Draven, a role he would have been remembered for even if he wasn't killed accidentally on set. Every character was played to the brink of perfection. You hated ever inch, ever sweaty cell of those gang members, and Mr. Big was almost the personification of modern big city, dark alley evil. Ernie Hudson's street beat cop was a great link between the viewers and the world of burning Detroit.As a reader of the original graphic novel of which the movie was based, I was worried that the tone would never make it to film, but Alex Proyas practically dunked the celluloid into blackest ink as this movie was so dark I had problems viewing it on crappy televisions.You couldn't call Eric Draven a hero, and I don't like the term anti-hero because that doesn't fit either.

Its success is, however undeniable: after all, it spwaned two sequels and a TV series. It also has to live with a very infamous reputation, since action star Brandon Lee was accidentally killed during the shoot. Now, for the movie, it's a classic tale of love and revenge beyond death. A rock-musician called Eric Draven (no pun intended, or is it?) is brutally killed, along with his girlfriend, by a pack of hooligans. One year later, whoever is in charge in the next world grants him a chance to come back as a living dead super-hero and take a not less brutal revenge on the runamuckers who had their number. All this he does with a fellow crow on his shoulders. The rest of the plot is superflous: in the midst of all this mayhem are the local cops who had little to do against the band of thugs that hold the city hostage, so, in the end, the Crow is avenging not only the death of himself and his girl, but all deaths.Personally, I'm not a huge fan, but if you are, then you shouldn't even blink in front of this edition. Since it takes 2 discs, the picture and sound quality is the best you're going to find, as well as tons of stuff about the making of this comic-book-like film. Of course, a lot of the material is dedicated to the unfortunate demise of Brandon Lee, who happened to die in very similar conditions to those of his father.""The Crow"" is probably not one of my favorite films, but it does have an undeniable cult audience.

362055,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,6303187064,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[1, 1]","Tragedy was thick with the production of this film. Not only did a relative of star Ernie Hudson's die during production, we also lost a great actor and indeed a great person on the set with Brandon Lee, who died of a malfunction during a scene in which he gets shot. Ironic and tragic, Brandon Lee left us  with a fantastic swansong, and a bitter taste of what would have come had he not tragically met fate during shooting.As sad as that is, we are blessed with a beautiful, moody film that can only be described as a true gothic offering. James O'Barr's simple, yet completely captivating, comic set the grounds for what can easily be described as one of the best comic book movies to ever grace the cinematic world.Eric Draven, along with his fiancee, Shelly, are brutally murdered by a gang of vicious thugs the night before their wedding- October 31st. Exactly one year later, Eric is brought back from the dead to avenge their deaths, and in his quest for vengeance, clean up the streets of the city in which they lived.Alex Proyas shot a film that easily defined his career. There's an abundance of moody, gothic atmosphere that has the classic feel of an Edgar Allen Poe world. Indeed, the film matches up to the very definition of Gothic, both in terms of the set pieces and the overall look of the film. Everything seems so saturated, with greys and blacks being the primary colors, but we also get to be treated to a tone of orange and reds throughout the film. Alex got everything he could out of his actors, but with such a stunning cast as it was, he didn't have to give much direction to any of them.Astounding in the role of Eric Draven is Brandon Lee, who was the definitive Crow, and also the only man I can ever see playing the Crow. Brandon really embodied the role, seeming to put a lot of himself into, though I doubt Brandon was such a vindictive person in real life. Even though coated with makeup, you could still tell that this was Brandon Lee, the ultimate Brandon Lee, the only and only Brandon Lee. Like Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, we can see that to Lee, this was more than just another role- this was something that Brandon believed in, and he gave it his all, both in terms of what he was able to do as an actor and, tragically, his own life.Ernie Hudson, who I have always thought is an extremely underrated actor, gives us a great performance as Sergeant Albrecht. He is witty, smart, clever, and extremely unique, doing things his own way and not caring what the consequences may be. His eventual role as a partner to Eric is completely believable, and to see him in one of his best roles ever was a breath of fresh air.Young Rochelle Davis as Sarah also did a good job, though at time I felt that she was a little too dry, and that she didn't really know at times what she was doing. In some ways, that worked in her favor. It described the naivety of children, and also fit her character at times, who has seen darkness and just stopped caring about the light. Her tragic loss of two people that took care of her, loved her, is apparent, and you can't help but feel something when she finally reunites with Eric.We don't even need to go into how good Michael Wincott was as Top Dollar, nor do we need to dissect David Patrick Kelly as T-Bird. These two did a fantastic job in their respective roles, bringing truly evil characters to life.What this DVD has for us is something wonderful. Deleted scenes, an interview with James O'Barr, a behind-the-scenes feaurette with some great interviews with Brandon Lee and Ernie Hudson, story boards, extended scenes- everything you could want from a movie. The folks at Miramax gave us what will probably always be the definitive version of the film, and they did a good job with what they gave us. There could be more, but I am happy with what we were given.All in all, The Crow is a intense, moody film, packed with rich, interesting characters played by top-notch performers. Tragic that Brandon Lee is no longer with us, but we can always thank him for giving us this triumphant film, and hope that wherever he is, he knows that we have not forgotten about him. Rest in peace, Brandon Lee. You are dearly missed.",5,It Can't Rain All The Time...,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,4207,"['Tragedy', 'was', 'thick', 'production', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'relative', 'star', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'die', 'production', 'also', 'lost', 'great', 'actor', 'indeed', 'great', 'person', 'set', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'who', 'died', 'malfunction', 'scene', 'shot', 'Ironic', 'tragic', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'left', 'fantastic', 'swansong', 'bitter', 'taste', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'had', 'not', 'tragically', 'met', 'fate', 'shooting.As', 'sad', 'are', 'blessed', 'beautiful', 'moody', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'true', 'gothic', 'offering', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'simple', 'yet', 'completely', 'captivating', 'comic', 'set', 'grounds', 'what', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'described', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'ever', 'grace', 'cinematic', 'world.Eric', 'Draven', 'fiancee', 'Shelly', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'gang', 'vicious', 'thugs', 'night', 'wedding-', 'October', '31st', 'Exactly', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'Eric', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'avenge', 'deaths', 'quest', 'vengeance', 'clean', 'up', 'streets', 'city', 'lived.Alex', 'Proyas', 'shot', 'film', 'easily', 'defined', 'career', 'abundance', 'moody', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'classic', 'feel', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'world', 'Indeed', 'film', 'very', 'definition', 'Gothic', 'terms', 'set', 'pieces', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'Everything', 'so', 'saturated', 'greys', 'blacks', 'being', 'primary', 'colors', 'also', 'get', 'be', 'treated', 'tone', 'orange', 'reds', 'film', 'Alex', 'got', 'everything', 'could', 'out', 'actors', 'such', 'stunning', 'cast', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'much', 'direction', 'them.Astounding', 'role', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'who', 'was', 'definitive', 'Crow', 'also', 'only', 'man', 'can', 'ever', 'see', 'playing', 'Crow', 'Brandon', 'really', 'embodied', 'role', 'seeming', 'put', 'lot', 'doubt', 'Brandon', 'was', 'such', 'vindictive', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'Even', 'coated', 'makeup', 'could', 'still', 'tell', 'was', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'ultimate', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'only', 'only', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'can', 'see', 'Lee', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'role-', 'was', 'something', 'Brandon', 'believed', 'gave', 'terms', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'actor', 'tragically', 'own', 'life.Ernie', 'Hudson', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'actor', 'great', 'performance', 'Sergeant', 'Albrecht', 'witty', 'smart', 'clever', 'extremely', 'unique', 'doing', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'consequences', 'may', 'be', 'eventual', 'role', 'partner', 'Eric', 'completely', 'believable', 'see', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'ever', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.Young', 'Rochelle', 'Davis', 'Sarah', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'though', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'dry', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'times', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'ways', 'worked', 'favor', 'described', 'naivety', 'children', 'also', 'fit', 'character', 'times', 'who', 'seen', 'darkness', 'just', 'stopped', 'caring', 'light', 'tragic', 'loss', 'two', 'people', 'took', 'care', 'loved', 'apparent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'something', 'when', 'finally', 'Eric.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'go', 'how', 'good', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'was', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'do', 'need', 'dissect', 'David', 'Patrick', 'Kelly', 'T-Bird', 'two', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'bringing', 'truly', 'evil', 'characters', 'life.What', 'DVD', 'something', 'wonderful', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'interview', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'behind-the-scenes', 'feaurette', 'great', 'interviews', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'story', 'boards', 'extended', 'scenes-', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'movie', 'folks', 'Miramax', 'gave', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'be', 'definitive', 'version', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'gave', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'am', 'happy', 'what', 'were', 'given.All', 'Crow', 'intense', 'moody', 'film', 'packed', 'rich', 'interesting', 'characters', 'played', 'top-notch', 'performers', 'Tragic', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'longer', 'can', 'always', 'thank', 'giving', 'triumphant', 'film', 'hope', 'wherever', 'have', 'not', 'forgotten', 'Rest', 'peace', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'are', 'dearly', 'missed']",N/A

One year later Draven is resurrected and with the a Crow guiding him. Hunts down his killers one by one extracting his revenge.The real meat of the movie is in Brandon Lee's performance. When he's extracting his revenge you find yourself wanting to cheer for this guy but at the same time kind of feeling sorry for his victims. Lee is relentless in his pursuit but he's also human. This isn't some mindless killing machine.

You could classify it as action, revenge, supernatural -- but it is really a love story, set against a background so grungy and gothic it looks like the Boulevard of Broken Dreams after an artillery boimbardment. The city (Detroit, sort of) is a decaying, rain-swept sewer run by an occultist crimn lord... who sends his goons to murder good-natured guitarist Eric Draven (Lee) and his fiance... Cut to a year later, when Draven bursts out of his own grave on a quest for some serious payback... ""The Crow"" is an extremely dark, bleak, bleached-out film, set to a sly, sinister rock-grunge soundtrack, but the overall message is actually sappy -- that love triumphs over all. The contrast works, and while Lee may not have been a great actor, he had more charisma than he knew what to do with. I can't think of any other actor who could have pulled off such a complicated role, alternating from tenderness to bloodlust and back, without batting an eye. The idea of a soul reaching out from beyond to right a wrong and meet up with his lost true love is poignent enough, and Lee's tragic demise only adds to that emotion.

With Michael Wincott as the appropriately vile chief villain and Ernie Hudson as the cop who helps him out, Lee manages to get his desired revenge.

If you do, chances are that you were very disappointed with it, like I was.  It didn't have any extra features, but that's not what upset me so much.  What really got to me was how horrible the picture looked.  The quality was terrible.  It was as if they just copied over the VHS and just put it on DVD.  It was bright when it was supposed to be dark.  Talk about a let down.  But now, everything has changed.Now, a new and improved version is out, and it is outstanding. It was like seeing the movie for the first time. The picture quality was more than satisfactory. When it was supposed to be dark, it was dark, and when it was supposed to be bright, it was bright. The sound quality was also a big improvement, now that you can watch it in DTS if you have it. There were even some scenes that I could've sworn that I had never seen before. That goes to show you how much better this version is.Although Amazon doesn't go into detail about the special features, believe they are there.  Tons of them, I should say.  There's two disks in this collection, so that pretty much lets you know that there are plenty of extras lurking about.  A very big improvement on that front.Here's the story for those who haven't seen ""The Crow"": Eric Dravin and his girlfriend, Shelly, are brutally murdered on Devil's Night. Eric was shot and thrown out of the window, while Shelly was horribly beaten and raped to death. A year later, a hypnotic crow comes about and starts pecking on the tombstone of Eric Dravin. He digs out of his grave and is back from the world of the dead, and he wants vengeance for the murder of him and his girlfriend. He plans to make everyone who was responsible for the crimes pay with their lives. Dressed in black, with white makeup on his face, he begins his quest for vengeance and justice in this dark adventure.This still reamains a favorite to me.  It is a masterpiece, or at least that's how I feel about it.  The movie has everything.  Action, drama, suspense, and much much more.

He had the right look  and screen magnetism like Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford.Anyway, what a  great movie! Great action sequences. Touching love story. Developed  characters. Creativity on the part of the director. A good film score.

The film is very dark, literally and figuratively.  Still though, in the midst of that darkness is the love story of Eric and  Shelly.  Their murders spawn one of the most twisted and bittersweet  revenge-from-the-grave stories I have ever seen. The love story is a  central figure to Eric's return, but it doesn't weigh down the movie by  going into the sappiness territory. You really feel for Brandon Lee's  character, and you can't  help but cheer him on as he wastes those punk  losers who murdered him.  Michael Wincott (playing yet ANOTHER villain,  what's with that?) is perfect as the sadistic Top Dollar, and I love the  little girl on the skateboard.  The soundtrack is great too--a combination  of industrial, alternative, and a very haunting score.  The ending of the  movie always makes me cry. I won't give it away, but it does give you a  sense of hope in this dark and cynical world.

His fiancee, Shelly Webster, was raped and murdered in front of him on that same night. It is said that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead, ... but, sometimes, the crow will bring them back for revenge! That's just what happens in 1994's comic book-based ""The Crow,"" a dark, beautifully gothic tale of violence, revenge, and justice.One year after his death, Eric (Brandon Lee, in his tragic, final role) returns as an unstoppable force of vengeance, with a supernatural Crow as his guide to those whom he must destroy. One by one, Eric takes out the scumbags that took his life and love, Shelly. As his work becomes more challenging, he enlists the aid of kindhearted Police Sergeant Albrecht, played by beloved Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson.  Together, they protect a young girl named Sarah, as Eric goes on with his vigilante executions, eventually leading him to a much bigger source of evil.The Crow is a masterpiece of modern film. The first in the now popular style of dark, gothic tales of supernatural Urban warfare. The tale is cold and unforgiving, yet equally touching, and straight from the heart of creator James O'Barr. The film is dark and graphic, and perfectly matched to the story it tells. The acting is superb, the writing poetic, and the attention to detail baffling. This is a film that is truly an event to watch, as simple as the story may be. The DVD is loaded with extras that really give you insight into the depth the film-makers went to bring The Crow to the big screen. You'll also get a keen understanding of the comic and its creator, or at least, as best as you can without reading the comic yourself.Tragically, Brandon Lee was shot and killed while filming this Masterpiece of a movie in a somewhat suspicious ""accident.""

362092,A23MFVRAAJUP78,6303187064,Nina,"[1, 1]","I have a long list in my mind of my dozen favorite movies which includes many different varying genres of films-from the Nightmare Before Christmas to Benny and Joon to the Fifth Element-and I must say that The Crow is definitely up there within my top 3 or 4 favorites. It takes a certain dark-sided yet romantic person to enjoy this movie to its fullest, but even if that doesn`t sound like you, Lee`s cocky charm and the beautifully melancholy mood of the movie may just bring out those traits in you. However, you may also be a more polite-movie person with zero feel for macabre or violence who would be much better off with some Hitchock classics. Let me put it this way: you will either love The Crow with a passion or become very confused by it. Probably the most capturing elements of this movie are three things: the look, the music, and Brandon Lee himself. There are some wonderful movies out there in which the creators took the time to make the movie look good-many by Tim Burton in particular-and The Crow reminded me a lot of those other beautiful films. The city that the movie takes place looks like a deliciously eerie hell. There are some pretty scenes too-one of my favorite moments is when Lee appears through a window before his friend Sarah in a sudden beam of golden light, and you`ll notice that it isn`t until then that it starts raining outside. (This perhaps could be symbolism of Lee`s character being trapped in sadness.) The hard rock songs and the haunting music that Eric Draven plays on his electric guitar adds to the sad mood, seeming to speak to the city about the rock-and-roll person Eric was in life with a depressing depth to it. And finally, Brandon Lee is, of course, the movie`s main delight. He carries out his lines with a smooth confidence that sort of sends a shiver down your spine-if looking at his face alone doesn`t. You can tell that Lee really connected with his role-in fact, he died for it.

I think I know why this film is so deeply stirring. Here is the essence of the shaman hero returned from the realm of death to correct profound injustice, profound imbalance. The return from the realm of the dead, the crow as spirit guide, the mask, the music (yes, it would have been more appropriate if he was a drummer, but when does a drummer ever get any recognition....) Here is the age old tale of profound evil generating an equally profound response. Yes, there is a lot of violence in this film, yet somehow it doesn't come across as either gratuitous or self-righteous. Eric Draven has returned to show the conscienceless the true evil and pain that they cause others- right before he sends them to their true judgement.I've had people tell me that they won't watch this film because they don't like dark and negative images.

362105,AXV9GS0TMSVW,6303187064,Poor Napoleon,"[1, 1]","""The Crow"" debuted in theatres amid a myriad of stories about Brandon Lee's death.  The ghost of Lee hovering over the film overshadowed the film itself.  The film is a classic vengence tale.  It differs from the norm in that it deals with the supernatural.  But rather than paint the Crow as a cold blooded hero delivering vigelante justice, we are given a character crushed and saddened by the harsh  memories of his and his fiance's death.  This sadness drives him to deliver justice to his killers.""The Crow"" is a great adaptation of the comic. And while I understand all the purists out there, I think the film is even better.  Brandon Lee breathes a certain humanity into the character that helps us root for him more.  The Sarah character helps elevate The Crow beyond being out there for purely vengence, as he still has a bond with her.  Alex Proyas and co have created in some senses, a deeper story than the book.  Though, admittedly, the emotion is elevated by Brandon Lee's sad demise during production.As to the production itself, I don't think any other director could pull this film off.  This and Proyas' subsequent ""Dark City"" are visual marvels in how they create a setting that becomes a character itself.  I think there are only two scenes that show light in this movie.  So to call this movie dark is an understatement.  But it's how it's the mood that it creates and how it's so artfully done that makes the film look so terrific.  As the Crow flies over the city, we are given a look of ruin and chaos.  Proyas makes an effort to make this film look ""dirty,"" down to the very characters.In addition, this film boasts a tremendous soundtrack.  It's not just the alt-rock hits either.  Graeme Revelle delivers a haunting score that adds to the ambience of the film. The best example of how it adds to the tone is when Erik goes to find Skank and during the shootout, the sound becomes muffled with the exception of the score.To be sure, Alex Proyas' ""The Crow"" is different than J.O. Barr's.  He is featured on this disc - and let me tell you, I would never guess that he was the creator of the Crow.  Additional features on the disc include a commentary, which is insightful, but none of the major players are present.  It's a producer and screenwriter.  Interestingly, but probably not surprisingly, little of what happened actually on set is mentioned.  Rather, it talks a lot about how the film came to fruition. It's informative, if nothing else.",4,"""Crow"" a classic story of vengence, brought to life by great visuals",1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2473,"['Crow', 'debuted', 'theatres', 'myriad', 'stories', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'death', 'ghost', 'Lee', 'hovering', 'film', 'overshadowed', 'film', 'film', 'classic', 'vengence', 'tale', 'norm', 'supernatural', 'rather', 'paint', 'Crow', 'cold', 'blooded', 'hero', 'delivering', 'vigelante', 'justice', 'are', 'given', 'character', 'crushed', 'saddened', 'harsh', 'memories', 'fiance', 'death', 'sadness', 'deliver', 'justice', 'killers', 'Crow', 'great', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'understand', 'purists', 'there', 'think', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'certain', 'humanity', 'character', 'root', 'more', 'Sarah', 'character', 'elevate', 'Crow', 'being', 'out', 'there', 'purely', 'vengence', 'still', 'bond', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'co', 'have', 'created', 'senses', 'deeper', 'story', 'book', 'Though', 'admittedly', 'emotion', 'elevated', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'sad', 'demise', 'production.As', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'director', 'could', 'pull', 'film', 'off', 'Proyas', 'subsequent', 'Dark', 'City', 'are', 'visual', 'marvels', 'how', 'create', 'setting', 'character', 'think', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'scenes', 'show', 'light', 'movie', 'So', 'call', 'movie', 'dark', 'understatement', 'how', 'mood', 'how', 'so', 'artfully', 'done', 'film', 'look', 'so', 'terrific', 'Crow', 'city', 'are', 'given', 'look', 'ruin', 'chaos', 'Proyas', 'effort', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'dirty', 'down', 'very', 'characters.In', 'addition', 'film', 'tremendous', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'just', 'alt-rock', 'hits', 'Graeme', 'Revelle', 'haunting', 'score', 'ambience', 'film', 'best', 'example', 'how', 'tone', 'when', 'Erik', 'find', 'Skank', 'shootout', 'sound', 'muffled', 'exception', 'score.To', 'be', 'sure', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'Crow', 'different', 'J.O', 'Barr', 'featured', 'disc', 'let', 'tell', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'was', 'creator', 'Crow', 'Additional', 'features', 'disc', 'include', 'commentary', 'insightful', 'none', 'major', 'players', 'are', 'present', 'producer', 'screenwriter', 'Interestingly', 'probably', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'what', 'happened', 'actually', 'set', 'mentioned', 'Rather', 'lot', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'fruition', 'informative', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A

Then by it's beautiful story.  The story should have been enough, Lee should have lived to make other films.  But that's just wishing in the wind.The story of a murdered man's return one year after his death to exact vengeance on those who killed him and his wife is based on the popular comic book.  The idea of love transcending the borders of Life/Death allow the violence to be overlooked, if not accepted as just.  Filled with darkness and rage, Eric Draven (Lee) seeks out those who killed him and his wife, guided by a psychopomp crow.  Brandon Lee's portrayal of the tortured spirit is nothing but masterful.  Alex Proyas's direction is both superb and haunting.  The script by John Shirley brilliant.  Not only was The Crow one of the best and most memorable movies made in the 1990's but it did a wonderful thing in this age of teenage illiteracy, it prompted teens to seek out and read the source material.

I have a number of versions of the CROW on VHS and DVD, and the Extras on the triple pack fail in one respect; there is an interview with Lee on the VHS version that is without a doubt, one of the most poignant, touching, and eerily prescient interviews on tape. Lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless, and yet... how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious... it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment, but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now , because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment, we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant. And just the loss ,the loss , or at least the change, of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the DVD.However, the triple  pack is well worth it, if only to get the brilliant film, and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original THE CROW, and the sequels should never have been made...

362134,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6303187064,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[1, 1]","I was one of the people who read James O' Barr's graphic novel long before the movie was released. The novel really struck a nerve in me and touched me in a way no other book, comic or otherwise, has yet to do. When I heard a movie was coming out based on O' Barr's Crow I was both skeptical and hopeful. Luckily my expectations for a movie to respect the original did not fall short with The Crow.The book was dark, moody, and extremely emotional. Though much of the content in the book can hardly translate to a movie made for the general public, The Crow has very much the spirit of the book. Admittedly it was severely toned down, but you have to expect that. The most important elements were there. The Crow is ultimately a love story and the movie kept that. It also held onto the mood of the books, paying tribute to the gothic and the post-modern genres. It actually might be the only mainstream movie out that does this right.The differences that were made between the book and the movie didn't diminish the spirit either. One big change was making one of the books characters into the ultimate bad boss. I know for Hollywood you need to focal point for the hero to eventually end up at and they sure got a doozy of a villain. The other characters are well rounded and you get enough to know who they are what they are about. Character development can make or break a movie so I was glad to see all of the characters from Officer Albrecht (a major supporting character) to Darla (minor supporting character pivotal to a side story) and her daughter get well defined within their airtime.This is definitely Brandon Lee's finest performance. I was very much saddened to hear his passing during the making of the film. He is one of the celebrities out there I feel left us much too soon and I really miss him. At least his final movie truly showed the kind of actor he can be and not just a martial arts prodigy. Pretty much all of the actors did a splendid job with this movie. Director Alex Proyas picked a great cast and has a knack for making the film feel grim without being depressing.Not only do you have a good story put together with good plot and character development you also have a healthy dose of very cool action. This might be Brandon's greatest acting role, but that doesn't mean we don't see the man kick some serious butt. While I wouldn't call this an action movie you get a nice amount of excitement sprinkled along the story. The special effects are right on par too. The backdrop models are real gothic and moody. The digital effects are the best you will find in this era. Due to Brandon't untimely tragedy they had to superimpose his image digitally on body doubles and other scenes to finish the movie. I dare you to figure out which scenes aren't him without looking it up.Did I forget to mention the soundtrack? Oh yeah... the soundtrack gives The Crow its moodiness and does it well. Whoever picked the songs and composer knows what are talking about. Music is what defines the gothic and post-modern styles and The Crow was oozing with that kind of music. You get songs by The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rollins Band, Rage Against the Machine and more. There were also cameo appearances by My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult and Medicine. I normally don't make a point to bring up bands in a soundtrack, but considering the specific look and feel of the movie I felt like it deserved mentioning.The collector's series is the DVD to get for The Crow. You get interviews with the cast and crew as well as a sweet commentary by Alex Proyas. You also get interviews with James O' Barr regarding the genesis of the comic book. The one thing that disappointed me was the deleted scene montage. Instead of actually giving us the scenes you get chopped up one second cuts in a music-dubbed montage. I would have really liked to see the scenes they made with ""Skull Cowboy"" and instead I get a music video. Shame on you.The Crow is an excellent film. It's pretty different from any film that even comes close to this kind of plot. Not only is it done different it is done right. Keep in mind it might be an acquired taste for some not used to this kind of movie.If any of you are into the gothic/post modern genre, or have any interest in it, you're going to really like The Crow. If you're into dark and moody stories you're going to love it. And since it's not too dark and moody for the normal people out there I think many others will enjoy The Crow too. As for that acquired tasted I mentioned...

With his widow's consent, the filmmakers persevered and completed the film, intercutting doubles and digital reinsertions of Brandon Lee into the film.Based on James O'Barr's graphic novel, the film was a groundbreaking entry into the realm of adult ""comic book"" fiction, using a non-traditional superhero (in many ways, an anti-hero) as its protagonist.  This dark film showed studio execs the power and profit waiting to be mined from graphic novel/comic book fiction.  Without the overwhelming success of The Crow, the dark heroes in Spawn, Blade, Road to Perdition, LXG, and the forthcoming Constantine and Hellboy might never have made it to the silver screen.The film has always had the following aspects I found appealing:1. The delicious characterization of the antagonists in the film.  Although some border on caricature, the villans are all uniquely evil, and all receive retribution commensurate for their crimes.  Particularly juicy are David Patrick Kelly's Milton-quoting ""T-Bird"" and Michael Wincott's ""Top Dollar,"" who has it all but wants even more.2. The poetic justice of the villans (usually) having their own vices turned against them.  Particularly impressive is the death of T-Bird, whose tendencies toward arson are rewarded with his incendiary demise behind the wheel of his eponymous vehicle, and the Crow's subsequent ""signature,"" left in flaming accelerant at the scene of the crime.3. The unique way in which a theme that has been done frequently (love is stronger than death) is handled throughout the film.4. The stunning incorporation of music.  Alex Proyas has been unfairly criticized for turning the film into one long music video.  Certainly, the combination of Proyas' visual sense with the dark, nihilistic music of NIN, STP, The Cure, Rollins Band, Helmet, and Violent Femmes (just to name a few) displays his roots in directing music videos, but the film seamlessly oscillates between Graeme Revell's tender, melodic score and the film's heavy, alternative soundtrack at just the right moments.Although the ill-advised sequels failed to live up to the visual (or box office) power of the original, The Crow offers a mournfully tragic, yet redeeming story if the viewer can look past the violence and strong language to the beauty of the story of eternal love and justice that lies beneath.",5,"Quoth the Raven, &quot;Awesome Movie!&quot;",1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,2700,"['Tragically', 'film', 'been', 'dismissed', 'many', 'critics', 'excessively', 'violent', 'movie', 'designed', 'play', 'audience', 'teenage', 'Goths', 'vampire', 'wannabees', 'harboring', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'death', 'Equally', 'tragic', 'fact', 'star', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'completed', 'picture', 'died', 'on-set', 'accident', 'end', 'principal', 'photography', 'widow', 'consent', 'filmmakers', 'persevered', 'completed', 'film', 'intercutting', 'doubles', 'digital', 'reinsertions', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'film.Based', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'entry', 'realm', 'adult', 'comic', 'book', 'fiction', 'using', 'non-traditional', 'superhero', 'many', 'ways', 'anti-hero', 'protagonist', 'dark', 'film', 'showed', 'studio', 'execs', 'power', 'profit', 'waiting', 'be', 'mined', 'graphic', 'novel/comic', 'book', 'fiction', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'Crow', 'dark', 'heroes', 'Spawn', 'Blade', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'LXG', 'forthcoming', 'Constantine', 'Hellboy', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'made', 'silver', 'screen.The', 'film', 'always', 'had', 'following', 'aspects', 'found', 'appealing:1', 'delicious', 'characterization', 'antagonists', 'film', 'border', 'caricature', 'villans', 'are', 'uniquely', 'evil', 'receive', 'retribution', 'commensurate', 'crimes', 'Particularly', 'juicy', 'are', 'David', 'Patrick', 'Kelly', 'Milton-quoting', 'T-Bird', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'who', 'even', 'more.2', 'poetic', 'justice', 'villans', 'usually', 'having', 'own', 'vices', 'turned', 'Particularly', 'impressive', 'death', 'T-Bird', 'tendencies', 'arson', 'are', 'rewarded', 'incendiary', 'demise', 'wheel', 'eponymous', 'vehicle', 'Crow', 'subsequent', 'signature', 'left', 'flaming', 'accelerant', 'scene', 'crime.3', 'unique', 'way', 'theme', 'been', 'done', 'frequently', 'love', 'stronger', 'death', 'handled', 'film.4', 'stunning', 'incorporation', 'music', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'been', 'unfairly', 'criticized', 'turning', 'film', 'one', 'long', 'music', 'video', 'Certainly', 'combination', 'Proyas', 'visual', 'sense', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'music', 'NIN', 'STP', 'Cure', 'Rollins', 'Band', 'Helmet', 'Violent', 'Femmes', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'roots', 'directing', 'music', 'videos', 'film', 'seamlessly', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'tender', 'melodic', 'score', 'film', 'heavy', 'alternative', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'right', 'ill-advised', 'sequels', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'visual', 'box', 'office', 'power', 'original', 'Crow', 'mournfully', 'tragic', 'yet', 'redeeming', 'story', 'viewer', 'can', 'look', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'beauty', 'story', 'eternal', 'love', 'justice', 'beneath']",N/A

362146,A31BBNT8C62MLU,6303187064,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[1, 1]","Somehow or other I missed this film until now.  I happened to watch the TV series, with Mark Dacascos, left a glowing review, and liked it so much I had to see the original.  Wow- a great soundtrack (with the Cure, a favorite band), my favorite car ('73 T-Bird), and Brandon Lee dynamic and angst-ridden as the Crow.  And best of all, more shots in the movie than in the TV series of the crow (the bird) itself, flying, guiding, etc.- more in keeping with its mystical nature.My purpose here is to contrast the movie and the series.  I'm not sure if I would have liked the film QUITE as much had I not seen the TV show first (hard to know- you can't un-ring a bell).  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of glorifying evil, especially, with gratuitous sex and violence (cutting out people's eyeballs and eating them, lascivious sex scenes with one's sister, etc).  Nor am I a fan of films that create entire WORLDS peopled by beings that glory in others' pain- sadists who laugh with glee while cutting out others' hearts, etc.  Fortunately, in the real world such people are relatively few and far between.But the movie was suspenseful and jam-packed, well-crafted.  It left me wanting more.  And that ""more"" was MORE than satisfied by the TV series.  I thought it superior in several ways to the film, but it's like comparing apples and oranges- in other ways the film was superior.  The TV series was a somewhat kinder and gentler version of the film.  Less of a roller-coaster ride, yes, but more thoughtful, detailed, far-reaching.  For example, as in the scene where the Crow wreaks such a profound change on Darla, we simply see her fix her daughter breakfast and that's it.  In the series, we see her wrestle with change, witness the complete metamorphosis of her character.  The TV show took the time to flesh out Draven, Shelley, Albrecht, Darla, everyone.  We see in detail Eric and Shelley's relationship, and his resurrection.  And it deviates in some intriguing ways from the film, e.g., in its treatment of Fun Boy, which spans several episodes.  There are plenty of challenging ideas hinted at in the movie, with no time to explore.The main difference between a movie and a TV show is pacing (duh).  The show was 22 hours long (one season).  It took different elements of the film and developed entire episodes around them, for example, the capture of the bird itself, Eric becoming mortal, Sarah being taken hostage, all in different episodes.  There was time to explore many more issues and possibilities.  I'm no prude, but I don't think the show suffered in the least by omitting obscenities and gore (although every episode features an exciting fight scene or two).The world created in the TV show is not quite as dark- more mysterious- sometimes menacing, sometimes beautiful.  And bad people aren't everywhere, just here and there- in boardrooms, in laboratories, in organized crime, even in internal affairs, but never fear, wherever they are, the Crow will find them.Dacascos's violence is toned down (i.e., fewer deaths result, at least until the end) and tempered with justice.  I thought he held his own in every way, charisma-wise, with Lee, and his martial arts skills are simply breathtaking, a thing of beauty.  And, he maintained this charisma, dynamism and quasi-magical persona throughout the entire series- never a false or incongruous note.  The only person I felt whom suffered by comparison to his character in the movie was the actor who played Albrecht, perhaps too reserved, in contrast to Ernie Hudson- a TOUGH act to follow.If the movie left you wanting more, and it's not just more violence and knee-jerk, quick vengeance you're craving, I encourage you to buy the TV series (it's a bargain).  It definitely rounded out and deepened my Crow experience.The Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete Series",4,Wow- but compare it with the TV series...,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,3842,"['Somehow', 'other', 'missed', 'film', 'now', 'happened', 'watch', 'TV', 'series', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'left', 'glowing', 'review', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'see', 'original', 'Wow-', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Cure', 'favorite', 'band', 'favorite', 'car', 'T-Bird', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'dynamic', 'angst-ridden', 'Crow', 'best', 'more', 'shots', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'crow', 'bird', 'flying', 'guiding', 'etc.-', 'more', 'keeping', 'mystical', 'nature.My', 'purpose', 'here', 'contrast', 'movie', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'QUITE', 'much', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'first', 'hard', 'know-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'un-ring', 'bell', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'glorifying', 'evil', 'especially', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'violence', 'cutting', 'out', 'people', 'eyeballs', 'eating', 'lascivious', 'sex', 'scenes', 'one', 'sister', 'etc', 'am', 'fan', 'films', 'create', 'entire', 'WORLDS', 'peopled', 'beings', 'glory', 'others', 'pain-', 'sadists', 'who', 'laugh', 'glee', 'cutting', 'out', 'others', 'hearts', 'etc', 'Fortunately', 'real', 'world', 'such', 'people', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'far', 'between.But', 'movie', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'jam-packed', 'well-crafted', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'was', 'MORE', 'satisfied', 'TV', 'series', 'thought', 'several', 'ways', 'film', 'comparing', 'apples', 'oranges-', 'other', 'ways', 'film', 'was', 'superior', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'somewhat', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'version', 'film', 'Less', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'yes', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'detailed', 'far-reaching', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Crow', 'wreaks', 'such', 'profound', 'change', 'Darla', 'simply', 'see', 'fix', 'daughter', 'breakfast', 'series', 'see', 'wrestle', 'change', 'witness', 'complete', 'metamorphosis', 'character', 'TV', 'show', 'took', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'Draven', 'Shelley', 'Albrecht', 'Darla', 'everyone', 'see', 'detail', 'Eric', 'Shelley', 'relationship', 'resurrection', 'intriguing', 'ways', 'film', 'e.g.', 'treatment', 'Fun', 'Boy', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'plenty', 'challenging', 'ideas', 'hinted', 'movie', 'time', 'explore.The', 'main', 'difference', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'pacing', 'duh', 'show', 'was', '22', 'hours', 'long', 'one', 'season', 'took', 'different', 'elements', 'film', 'developed', 'entire', 'episodes', 'example', 'capture', 'bird', 'Eric', 'becoming', 'mortal', 'Sarah', 'being', 'taken', 'hostage', 'different', 'episodes', 'was', 'time', 'explore', 'many', 'more', 'issues', 'possibilities', ""'m"", 'prude', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'suffered', 'least', 'omitting', 'obscenities', 'gore', 'episode', 'exciting', 'fight', 'scene', 'two', '.The', 'world', 'created', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'quite', 'dark-', 'more', 'mysterious-', 'sometimes', 'menacing', 'sometimes', 'beautiful', 'bad', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'everywhere', 'just', 'here', 'there-', 'boardrooms', 'laboratories', 'organized', 'crime', 'even', 'internal', 'affairs', 'never', 'fear', 'are', 'Crow', 'will', 'find', 'them.Dacascos', 'violence', 'toned', 'down', 'i.e.', 'fewer', 'deaths', 'result', 'least', 'end', 'tempered', 'justice', 'thought', 'held', 'own', 'way', 'charisma-wise', 'Lee', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'are', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'thing', 'beauty', 'maintained', 'charisma', 'dynamism', 'quasi-magical', 'persona', 'entire', 'series-', 'never', 'false', 'incongruous', 'note', 'only', 'person', 'felt', 'whom', 'suffered', 'comparison', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Albrecht', 'perhaps', 'too', 'reserved', 'contrast', 'Ernie', 'Hudson-', 'TOUGH', 'act', 'follow.If', 'movie', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'not', 'just', 'more', 'violence', 'knee-jerk', 'quick', 'vengeance', ""'re"", 'craving', 'encourage', 'buy', 'TV', 'series', 'bargain', 'definitely', 'rounded', 'out', 'deepened', 'Crow', 'experience.The', 'Crow', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'Complete', 'Series']",N/A

362149,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,6303187064,Tristan,"[0, 0]","Based on the brutal graphic novels of James O' Barr, The Crow follows a murdered rock star named Eric Draven(Brandon Lee) who was murdered along with his fianc&eacute;, who was also brutally raped, by a pack of savage hoodlums on the night before Halloween. A year later, a crow brings Eric back to life as a kind of zombie in order for him to avenge the death of his loved one so that they can finally rest in peace. After putting on mime make-up and dressing himself in dark clothing, he goes out and exacts gruesome revenge He eventually comes across the drug lord and gang leader known as Top-Dollar, a decadent and incestuous monster of a man who will make his task of avenging the death of a loved one a lot trickier.One thing that I can easily say about this film is that it is one of the best looking superhero films out there, if not THE best. Forget about films like Sin City, which goes all the way into basically replicating the exact look of the comic book that it is based on. There's nothing wrong with that film, but I feel that using practical effects, lighting, and skillful photography works a lot better. I feel that it looks better, it helps bring you into the world that the film takes place in a lot more smoothly, and it incites more of a sense of atmosphere. Sin City is fine, but this is more my kind of thing. The Crow makes it a point to allow the tone of this story to shine through over everything else. It is a film that is, more than anything, about loss and about death. What I find unique about it is that it takes it's time to not get into the heavy-handed nature of it all and instead allows it to be a part of the story. I found this approach to be incredibly powerful, and also somewhat unusual. Instead of showing us these characters as how they are, we are instead treated to a kind of dignified anthem of madness and chaos. The villains in this film are just as crazy and just as deranged as those in any other action comic book superhero film, but instead of giving them a bunch of cool lines and ridiculous costumes, the film gives them personality. Sure, they are recycled personalities, but what I appreciated the most about them was that the death scenes were about as cold and as brutal as they could be without being preachy. There is a lot of death and a lot of blood, but it all works surprisingly well in establishing the bleak, dark, and sinister atmosphere. Alex Proyas is a skilled filmmaker who has always been talented when it comes to establishing worlds, and this is a tremendous example of his visual imagination. Yes, the source material comes from the mind of James 'O Barr, but Proyas does a great job of translating those same feelings into this, both visually and also through the tone of the scenes. I like the way he uses more of a distanced sense of interest in his events and a closer and more intimate sense of interest in his characters, including his villains. Everyone in the film has their own neat little quirks, and it's so refreshing to see that in an action film, especially one like this that uses supernatural elements.I'll probably always love this film. It was the first R-rated film I ever watched. My mom rented it when I was about five. I remember not trying to pay too much attention to it because it kept on scaring the hell out of me, particularly because of a scene involving a character's eyeballs being pecked out by the crow. That scene makes me laugh now, but at the time I was frozen in fear at that scene. I think my mom probably forgot about that scene and left the room before that part happened. One thing that is worth noting is that this is an extremely violent film, probably the worst film I've seen or at least one of the most worst. One of the most bizarre things about this film, actually, is that it's filled with graphic, gruesome death and gore, and yet it has a sense of morality to it as well as morality based lessons about love, companionship, and doing the right thing in times of darkness. It's one of the strangest juxtapositions I've seen in film, and I'm sure that a lot of viewers probably were, or are, turned off from it for these reasons. I never let things like that bother me, however, especially if the film is a superhero film. Despite what many people say, this is an entertaining film that is full of over-the-top action, brutal fight scenes, gut-wrenching sadism, and explosive death. If you like brutal violence, this is one to check out.Brandon Lee, while he is certainly not a good actor, has plenty of charisma, and the sadistic glee he takes in dispatching his victims is quite amusing and is well-timed. He plays a character who, while not entirely interesting, is certainly very likable. Lee's screen presence in this film is exceptional. The rest of the cast is colorful and appropriately cartoon-like. The little girl, Sarah, is angry and deeply reminiscent of teenagers I knew from the nineties. I'm not sure if this is a good thing, but either way the performance of Rochelle Davis is the second strongest of the entire cast, the first being from Ernie Hudson. Ernie Hudson is an actor that has continued to impress me over and over and over again, and his performance in this is no exception. Out of all the actors in this film, his portrayal as a depressed police officer is what really elevates the material to the highest degree. He's the most sympathetic and the most honest character out of the entire cast, and Hudson's performance is just great. He's also not afraid to have a sense of humor, despite the strange situations he finds himself in.The one thing that really helps make this film work, however, is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled to the brim with dirty, grimy, dark, and hard metal and industrial music from the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Cure. It is absolutely one of the best, I repeat, THE BEST nineties film soundtracks you will ever hear. Not only does it flow well with the film, but it also is the best example of the time period the film was released in. As many people know, 1994 was an insane year in music. Bands like Green Day, Soundgarden, and Nine Inch Nails were getting a lot of airplay, but at the height of their popularity came the death of Kurt Cobain. Nirvana was as popular again as it had ever been, but along with their popularity came a slew of other bands that fans of that kind of music had been clamoring for. Grunge music had never been so popular, and it was that kind of music that people were raving about. The soundtrack to this film features some of the best of that kind of music and some of the best of this time in the nineties. It works because this film takes place in a kind of universe that is full of disappointment and death, and that's what a lot of this music is about. It's rare to find such a perfect combination of music and mood in film, but this is one of the best examples of a nineties film that does exactly that.Make no mistake, The Crow is still an action film. However, it is an action film that takes advantage of all opportunities to elevate itself above the material and works in doing so a good amount of the time. It's one of the best films of it's genre and one of the best action films of the nineties. It's not for the squeamish, nor is it for the easily offended, but it's got a lot of beautiful cinematography, a lot of good emotion, some stunning performances from the supporting cast, a lot of high quality action, and a brilliant soundtrack. When the film doesn't work, it's not overly distracting or ridiculous. In a lot of ways, it's one of the most charming films I've seen of it's type. I think that it's a very good film and that it's worth seeing. If anything, it's one hell of a satisfying and savage action film.",4,An action film that manages to transcend the genre in more ways than one,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,7783,"['Based', 'brutal',

It captures ugly acts by ugly people in an ugly city in the rain - but does it beautifully.The plot may not be anything grand, based on supernatural vengeance for a vicious murder. It's played out in a spectacular way, though, set against a combination of crumbling Victorian and 90s grunge in a city that seems never to see daylight. The crow itself is never wholly explained but never far away, giving a pervasive sense of mystery to the movie. Police sergeant Albrecht brings some sense of justice to the vengeance, and little Sarah reminds us of what needs to be avenged. Rochelle Davis, aged 14 when she played the role, put in a truly memorable performance. She managed to convey everything sulky and rebellious in a teen of her actual age, along with the strength of the young woman and fragility of the little girl that combine in her one small person. She never acted again after this movie - understandable, given the tragedy of its production - and I am sure that cinema lost something valuable because of that.One scene showed Sarah playing an LP album, reminding me that this movie predates today's pervasiveness of CDs. It also predates most of the computer-driven effects seen routinely in today's movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm as big an effects nut as anyone. The movie, though, is a stark and strong reminder of how good a movie can be without that kind of enhancement.If movies adapted from comics put you off, I have to agree that you have lots of good reason for that feeling.
