We find the character Light continuing to play the role of ""god of the new world,"" ending the lives of the people he deems evil and unworthy of life.  Light continues to write names in the Death Note, with the genius detective L hot on his trail.  Light stays sharp so that he can eliminate L, keep his grades up, and keep Ryuk from going into withdrawal by feeding him apples.  The show begins to start getting much more interesting in Volume 3 with Light entering college and L begins to keep an even closer watch on Light.  More importantly, the revelation of another Death God coming to Earth with a second Death Note.  The Death God not only gives the second Kira a Death Note, but they also provide a nice pair of Shinigami eyes to the owner allowing them to see everyone's name and lifespan by just looking at their face.

1112360,A1XUG3EJX89KNG,B000WW1YOW,Moonchild,"[2, 2]","**Contains NO story spoilers.**--This review is for Death Note vol. 7.My husband and I have loved watching this series, and have impulsively bought the next dvd, and then the next dvd, without caring how much money we had left in our bank account because this show was so addicting... and we are finally caught up waiting for December 30th for the next volume.  Hard to wait!  We went through the available dvd's really fast.It's a great series, but it has dipped on this volume... Let me explain.I browsed through the other reviews and was absolutely stunned that NO reviewer has mentioned, (or maybe they all didn't notice?), the one main thing that jostled my like for this late turn of events on this volume 7:  On the second to last episode, AND including the last episode on this dvd, the animation is quite different to me.  And I happen to -hate- it.  And my husband has noticed the difference in the animation as well.  It's really hard to explain how it has changed.  And I would call it a subtle change since it seems no once else has noticed it.  So, why should I be so bugged?  Because. it. is. different. to. me., it's. not. the. same., and I don't like the change.  So, in my anger on this fact, I would say that it looks cheaper.  It's almost as if the main animating company didn't have enough time to finish animating the rest of this set of episodes, and hired out for someone who is not as good and it was just quickly pumped out and uncared for.  That is a theory of ours, not a fact.  It's just what it seems like.  And I would say that it looks like the same bozos who animated that old G.I. Joe cartoon from the 80's got the green light to animate the last two episodes on this volume. =A joke, not a fact.  And please heaven forbid that the animation remains this way!  Granted, the up close shots of the main characters still look relatively the same, but it's when the characters are being shown together in a group and you see their whole bodies in the frame, or when characters are shown from torso shots, especially noticable when the are talking in those same kind of frames.  It was hard for me to keep enjoying what I was watching, and also the story is getting weird...I'm not so sure about this new direction in story the last two episodes take on this volume.  I thought the same thing as we were watching the Yotsuba involvement part of the story, but that has worked ok I guess.  My husband and I aren't too excited about the new characters that were introduced on this volume 7.  It's like the chemistry of the story of Deathnote is being changed again, as it felt like with the Yotsuba involvement.  The new horrible animation style doesn't help me enjoy everything about the new direction of story.  Apparently the new animation is only horrible to me and my husband.  I can't believe no one else has noticed or mentioned...)I -could- have given this volume 4 stars if it wasn't for the disapointment in the new animation.  The lack of 5 stars I give it just mainly has to do with how I'm not sure about the direction the story is going, haven't enjoyed it as thoroughly as the first 5 volumes.",3,3 & 1/2 stars.

1112363,A187O4M7CZMTDB,B000WW1YOW,T. Hunter-Selbrede,"[3, 3]","There is thus far nothing wrong in my world regarding Death Note, including the more recent attempts at beating a dead horse with a stick with the live-action ""L-change the WorLd"" and the BB murders novel.  The only disappointing thing for me was the decision to not include L's successors in the live-action Death Note movies (though there is a vague nod to Near at the end of ""L-change the WorLd"").  Considering that the original manga is really an extremely convoluted mind-game of chess, where there are more thought bubbles than speech bubbles, it's amazing that they were able to pull off fantastically the first two live action movies albeit in a truncated form.More amazing is that the anime version manages to keep the manga's mind games nearly whole.  Unlike most people, I find the characters of L's successors, Mello, and especially Near, not to mention the background of all three young men being orphans raised in a home full of brilliant children for the express purpose of picking certain of them for duties such as L, aka the Whammy House, to be much more interesting.  Particularly in the fact of their different approaches from L, their similarities and drive to beat each other to avenging L and to end the reign of Kira - all while Mello does so with a dark, passionate drive and seeming hatred of Near and his passive, painstaking method.  In a way seeing how Mello and Near interact gives you more of a perspective of L's background than watching L himself for a majority of the series.Basically, if you've made it this far through my review I'm surprised you haven't already hit the 'One-Click' buy button.  This is the point of the anime where you go from the long, steady, plodding pace of Death Note to the beginning of the brawling, psychotic stampede to the end of the series.",5,The Whammy Boys!,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,1805,"['thus', 'far', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'world', 'regarding', 'Death', 'Note', 'including', 'more', 'recent', 'attempts', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'stick', 'live-action', 'L-change', 'WorLd', 'BB', 'murders', 'novel', 'only', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'was', 'decision', 'not', 'include', 'L', 'successors', 'live-action', 'Death', 'Note', 'movies', 'vague', 'nod', 'Near', 'end', 'L-change', 'WorLd', 'Considering', 'original', 'manga', 'really', 'extremely', 'convoluted', 'mind-game', 'chess', 'where', 'are', 'more', 'thought', 'bubbles', 'speech', 'bubbles', 'amazing', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'fantastically', 'first', 'two', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'albeit', 'truncated', 'form.More', 'amazing', 'anime', 'version', 'manages', 'keep', 'manga', 'mind', 'games', 'nearly', 'whole', 'most', 'people', 'find', 'characters', 'L', 'successors', 'Mello', 'especially', 'Near', 'not', 'mention', 'background', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'being', 'orphans', 'raised', 'home', 'full', 'brilliant', 'children', 'express', 'purpose', 'picking', 'certain', 'duties', 'such', 'L', 'Whammy', 'House', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Particularly', 'fact', 'different', 'approaches', 'L', 'similarities', 'drive', 'beat', 'other', 'avenging', 'L', 'end', 'reign', 'Kira', 'Mello', 'so', 'dark', 'passionate', 'drive', 'seeming', 'hatred', 'Near', 'passive', 'painstaking', 'method', 'way', 'seeing', 'how', 'Mello', 'Near', 'interact', 'more', 'perspective', 'L', 'background', 'watching', 'L', 'majority', 'series.Basically', ""'ve"", 'made', 'far', 'review', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'hit', ""'One-Click"", 'buy', 'button', 'point', 'anime', 'where', 'go', 'long', 'steady', 'plodding', 'pace', 'Death', 'Note', 'beginning', 'brawling', 'psychotic', 'stampede', 'end', 'series']",Death Note - Vol. 3
