Stepp,"[11, 12]","This is a TV movie and it has the usual TV type dramatic elements such as alcoholism, divorce, dysfunction, etc.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was also genuine and sweet.  It's a simple story of a 17 year old girl (Kristen Bell) spending the summer with her father (Tim Matheson) whom she hasn't seen in ten years.  He lives by a lake in a small town in Arizona which gives the movie a very nice look and mood.  I wish it were shot in wide screen to take better advantage of the scenery but alas, this is TV fare.Matheson and Bell are very good together and the supporting characters are low-key and likable.

It never seems to dawn on these filmmakers that people who watch family movies try to avoid repulsive people.What saves this movie from one-star status is Tim Matheson and a rather restrained Sean Young.  You can't completely dislike Tim no matter how dismal the character he plays, and Sean Young is always a treat to watch.On the other hand again, it doesn't bother the moviemakers that having the only beautiful young woman in this small town in love with a hateful old man might be just a little incredible.",3,Caveat emptor,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,632,"['yet', 'movie', 'following', 'same', 'old', 'tired', 'recipe', 'Make', 'character', 'obnoxious', 'can', 'change', 'Act', '3', 'never', 'dawn', 'filmmakers', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'family', 'movies', 'try', 'avoid', 'repulsive', 'people.What', 'movie', 'one-star', 'status', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'rather', 'restrained', 'Sean', 'Young', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'dislike', 'Tim', 'matter', 'how', 'dismal', 'character', 'Sean', 'Young', 'always', 'treat', 'watch.On', 'other', 'hand', 'again', ""n't"", 'bother', 'moviemakers', 'having', 'only', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'small', 'town', 'love', 'hateful', 'old', 'man', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'incredible']",The King And Queen Of Moonlight Bay

The movie seems a little short in run-time.  I was wishing the script to be a little longer, so that there would be more scenes for the actors.the film gives a realistic look at how alcohol can destroy a family, (divorce, abuse, emotional scars).  Kristen Bell & Tim Matheson especially deliver good performances, as daughter & father.  Many people who come from broken homes can surely relate to these characters and circumstances.This is also interesting for those children/adolescents whose parents are going through, or have already had, a divorce.
