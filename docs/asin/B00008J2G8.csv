743045,AIMR915K4YCN,B00008J2G8,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[3, 3]","Lon Chaney jr. plays the devil in this 3 part horror anthology. He gives one of his female lost souls a chance to be his assistant on earth. Her name is ""Satanya"" and she delivers various key items to the main characters in each story. The first one involves a psycho photographer, who takes a picture of a strange girl before murdering her. Let's just say that she is not happy! She haunts the man in a unique way. In the second story (the weakest of the three), a girl is found underground, frozen in ice. An anthropologist falls in love with her and kills one of his colleagues for trying to study her. He then defrosts his ""girlfriend"" and a strange surprise awaits him. The final story is about a man who dreams of being on a dark street and entering a door. His psychologist convinces him to actually visit the place. When he does, he runs into a fortune teller who tells him that she will kill him by midnight. This is the best of the trilogy, and has a cool twist ending. All in all a fair production. Lon is wasted in my opinion.

743046,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00008J2G8,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","This may be a 60s Black and White, but it was way ahead of its time. One could easily call it an excellent forerunner of the ""Devil's Advocate."" The world will probably remember Chaney Jr as the gentle and sympathetic wolf man. But he is a GREAT devil! The movie starts with a young woman (Kadler) who killed herself over lost love. She confronts the devil and he says: ""Love, well, love is such a stupid emotion."" This may sound strange, but think about it! Isn't it stupid to kill yourself over someone who doesn't love you?Moving on, perhaps seeing her potential, Chaney makes a deal with her that if she does some tasks for him, she could escape the worst parts of hell. (She has to deliver cursed items up to earth.) This leads to 3 separate stories that eventually connect. (The 1st deals with a man sexually obsessed with several women. The 2nd deals with a man who betrays his profession and friends over a woman frozen in ice.)The signature moment is when Kadler rebukes the devil for messing up people's lives, and he responds: ""Dear, people ruin their own lives."" The devil can tempt and persuade, but we make our own decisions. If we notice, the parties the devil picks out already had problems to begin with.In an especially chilling moment, Chaney manipulates Kadler's most vulnerable emotion. He offers her a chance to get even with the man who rejected her. Needless to say, Kadler gets more enthusiastic about her work. The 3rd story deviates from the standard formula and focuses on revenge more than anything. (Kadler's x lover is not really a bad person, and we really have no reason to dislike him.) One could even defend his act of murder in that a reasonable person would have felt threatened. But the 3rd story does compensate with fear, suspense, and tragic irony.Another reason I consider this a masterpiece ahead of its time is because while some movies glorify war, this movie seems to emphasize that war is hell on earth. And while suicide over love is a common thing, we have an interesting conversation that could occur between the parties: ""I'm not in love with her, and I haven't been for a long time!"" In one brief moment, we see how stupid suicide over love is.Between the great acting, the scenery, the scary stories, the memorable themes, and the sudden unification of 3 great stories, this movie is a masterpiece of horror!",5,A Masterpiece Way Ahead of Its Time!,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,2361,"['may', 'be', '60s', 'Black', 'White', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'call', 'excellent', 'forerunner', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'world', 'will', 'probably', 'remember', 'Chaney', 'Jr', 'gentle', 'sympathetic', 'wolf', 'man', 'GREAT', 'devil', 'movie', 'young', 'woman', 'Kadler', 'who', 'killed', 'lost', 'love', 'devil', 'Love', 'well', 'such', 'stupid', 'emotion', 'may', 'sound', 'strange', 'think', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'kill', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Moving', 'perhaps', 'seeing', 'potential', 'Chaney', 'deal', 'tasks', 'could', 'escape', 'worst', 'parts', 'hell', 'deliver', 'cursed', 'items', 'earth', '3', 'separate', 'stories', 'eventually', 'connect', '1st', 'deals', 'man', 'sexually', 'obsessed', 'several', 'women', '2nd', 'deals', 'man', 'who', 'profession', 'over', 'woman', 'frozen', 'ice', 'signature', 'moment', 'when', 'Kadler', 'devil', 'messing', 'up', 'people', 'lives', 'Dear', 'people', 'ruin', 'own', 'lives', 'devil', 'can', 'tempt', 'persuade', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'notice', 'parties', 'devil', 'out', 'already', 'had', 'problems', 'begin', 'especially', 'chilling', 'moment', 'Chaney', 'Kadler', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'emotion', 'chance', 'get', 'even', 'man', 'who', 'rejected', 'Needless', 'say', 'Kadler', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'work', '3rd', 'story', 'deviates', 'standard', 'formula', 'focuses', 'revenge', 'more', 'anything', 'Kadler', 'x', 'lover', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'person', 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'dislike', 'One', 'could', 'even', 'defend', 'act', 'murder', 'reasonable', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'threatened', '3rd', 'story', 'compensate', 'fear', 'suspense', 'tragic', 'irony.Another', 'reason', 'consider', 'masterpiece', 'ahead', 'time', 'movies', 'glorify', 'war', 'movie', 'emphasize', 'war', 'hell', 'earth', 'suicide', 'love', 'common', 'thing', 'have', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'could', 'occur', 'parties', ""'m"", 'not', 'love', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'see', 'how', 'stupid', 'suicide', 'love', 'is.Between', 'great', 'acting', 'scenery', 'scary', 'stories', 'memorable', 'themes', 'sudden', 'unification', '3', 'great', 'stories', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'horror']",The Devil's Messenger
743047,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00008J2G8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","If you have three lemons, you might as well try to make lemonade - but there's no guarantee it's going to taste very good.  That pretty much sums up The Devil's Messenger.  I'm a little iffy on the history here, but apparently Curt Siodmak (the man who wrote The Wolf Man and Donovan's Brain, as well as a string of complete flops) put together a horror show (filmed in Sweden) called 13 Demon Street around 1960 or so.  Apparently, no one was the least bit interested in the show, so it died in relative obscurity.  Having watched The Devil's Messenger, which incorporates three of the show's 13 episodes, it's not hard to see why no one wanted to take a chance on such drivel.  The only interesting thing about this production is its host, Lon Chaney, Jr. (looking old before his time).  Chaney is the gatekeeper of Hell; equipped with his infernal Rolodex, he sends all the new recruits through the door to get what they deserve (which seems to involve listening to silly evil laughter).  Suicides are special cases, though, because they supposedly hurt only themselves and not others.  When a third-time's-the-charm suicide victim by the name of Satanya arrives, he cuts her a deal.  All she has to do is make three deliveries for him back up on Earth, and she might have a chance at getting her Hell Express ticket voided.Satanya first delivers a camera to an obnoxious, womanizing photographer who is soon haunted by a photograph that seems to be very much alive.  Satanya returns, whines about having to do such awful things as delivering cameras, and is sent back up with a pickaxe for a certain Swedish miner.  That pickaxe soon leads to the discovery of a 50,000 year old woman encased in ice.  An anthropologist with the buggiest eyes I've ever seen then goes completely cuckoo for Cocoa puffs over the young lass.  This is really a stupid episode.  Finally, Satanya gets an assignment that gives her a chance to get some revenge on the guy she killed herself over.  Haunted by a recurring nightmare, this fellow goes to the location in his dream and watches everything he dreamed come true - yada yada yada.  There's not an ounce of originality in this or either of the earlier little episodes - and the twist at the end isn't anything to write home about, either.  If you're not a Lon Chaney, Jr., fan, I can assure you there's really no reason in the world for you to watch The Devil's Messenger.",2,"Sometimes, it should actually be OK to kill the messenger",1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,2410,"['have', 'three', 'lemons', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'try', 'make', 'lemonade', 'guarantee', 'going', 'taste', 'very', 'good', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'Devil', 'Messenger', ""'m"", 'little', 'iffy', 'history', 'here', 'apparently', 'Curt', 'Siodmak', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'Donovan', 'Brain', 'as', 'well', 'string', 'complete', 'flops', 'put', 'together', 'horror', 'show', 'filmed', 'Sweden', 'called', '13', 'Demon', 'Street', '1960', 'so', 'Apparently', 'one', 'was', 'least', 'bit', 'interested', 'show', 'died', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'Having', 'watched', 'Devil', 'Messenger', 'three', 'show', '13', 'episodes', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'wanted', 'take', 'chance', 'such', 'drivel', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'production', 'host', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'looking', 'old', 'time', 'Chaney', 'gatekeeper', 'Hell', 'equipped', 'infernal', 'Rolodex', 'new', 'recruits', 'door', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'involve', 'listening', 'silly', 'evil', 'laughter', 'Suicides', 'are', 'special', 'cases', 'though', 'supposedly', 'hurt', 'only', 'not', 'others', 'When', ""third-time's-the-charm"", 'suicide', 'victim', 'name', 'Satanya', 'arrives', 'deal', 'do', 'make', 'three', 'deliveries', 'back', 'up', 'Earth', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'getting', 'Hell', 'Express', 'ticket', 'voided.Satanya', 'first', 'camera', 'obnoxious', 'womanizing', 'photographer', 'who', 'soon', 'haunted', 'photograph', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'Satanya', 'returns', 'whines', 'having', 'do', 'such', 'awful', 'things', 'delivering', 'cameras', 'sent', 'back', 'up', 'pickaxe', 'certain', 'Swedish', 'miner', 'pickaxe', 'soon', 'discovery', '50,000', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'encased', 'ice', 'anthropologist', 'buggiest', 'eyes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'completely', 'cuckoo', 'Cocoa', 'puffs', 'young', 'lass', 'really', 'stupid', 'episode', 'Finally', 'Satanya', 'assignment', 'chance', 'get', 'revenge', 'guy', 'killed', 'over', 'Haunted', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'fellow', 'location', 'dream', 'watches', 'everything', 'dreamed', 'come', 'true', 'yada', 'yada', 'yada', 'not', 'ounce', 'originality', 'earlier', 'little', 'episodes', 'twist', 'end', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'either', ""'re"", 'not', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'fan', 'can', 'assure', 'really', 'reason', 'world', 'watch', 'Devil', 'Messenger']",The Devil's Messenger
