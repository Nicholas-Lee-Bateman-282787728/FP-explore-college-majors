Everyone is looking for love but ends up finding heartache because they don't really know what they want.  There is Jessica Stein, a nice Jewish girl being pressured by her concerned mother to find a suitable man.  After too many disasterous dates, including a speedating series Jessica, ends up answering an ad placed by a woman.  The woman who has run the ad isn't really interested in a relationship, she just wants to have a new sexual experience.  Then there is Jessica's colleague at her job, a guy who picks up women whose brains are somewhere between their feet and knees and insults Jessica about her requirements for Mr. Right.  The woman discovers too late that she's in love with Jessica, but Jessica isn't in love with her.  Jessica's male colleague discovers he never really knew Jessica but he gets a second chance when her  female lover breaks up with her.Everyone involved gets a lesson in love and lessons in life.",4,Alternate Romance,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,1170,"['bought', 'movie', 'was', 'acquainted', 'someone', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'read', 'making', 'movie', 'article', 'indie', 'film', 'magazine.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'designed', 'adults', 'Everyone', 'looking', 'love', 'up', 'finding', 'heartache', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'being', 'pressured', 'concerned', 'mother', 'find', 'suitable', 'man', 'too', 'many', 'disasterous', 'dates', 'including', 'speedating', 'series', 'Jessica', 'up', 'answering', 'ad', 'placed', 'woman', 'woman', 'who', 'run', 'ad', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'relationship', 'just', 'have', 'new', 'sexual', 'experience', 'Then', 'Jessica', 'colleague', 'job', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'women', 'brains', 'are', 'somewhere', 'feet', 'knees', 'insults', 'Jessica', 'requirements', 'Mr', 'Right', 'woman', 'too', 'late', 'love', 'Jessica', 'Jessica', ""n't"", 'love', 'Jessica', 'male', 'colleague', 'discovers', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'Jessica', 'second', 'chance', 'when', 'female', 'lover', 'up', 'her.Everyone', 'involved', 'lesson', 'love', 'lessons', 'life']",Kissing Jessica Stein

Stephen King, at the end of &quot;The Langoliers,&quot; said of his characters that they seemed &quot;somehow brighter than anyone ... More actual.  More there.&quot;  That could be said of these characters, for we're taken so deeply into who they are.  Such characterizations are a credit to the actors' performances as well as to the writers.  It's rare, though, that such characterizations are joined by an almost flawlessly written comic screenplay delivered with near-perfect comic timing, and a great soundtrack (as better detailed in others' comments).

Even if you're a self-defacating person, this movie will get your endomorphines pumping.[That will seem funnier after you've seen the movie.]Here are 5 reasons to see 'Kissing Jessica Stein':1. Not only are Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen superb actresses, they are persistent and talented entrepreneurs as well. They sheparded this movie through development hell and produced a brilliant movie for $980,000. To date the movie has grossed over $6 million. Let's hear it for perseverance and vision. Go out and support these two businesswoman.2. The talent in the movie. It runs very deep - beyond the obvious talents of the two co-stars, don't forget about Tovah Feldshuh, Scott Cohen and (especially) Jackie Hoffman (hilarious as Jessica's cubicle-mate).3. The New York City setting. Studios asked Jennifer and Heather to consider moving the filiming to Toronto and other 'cheap' locales. The girls insisted on New York. See the movie and you'll agree - this could not have been filmed anywhere but NYC. Go see the movie and get a slice of what makes New York special.4. The stars themselves. The studios pushed to get 'name' actresses like Lisa Kudrow and Courtney Cox for the roles. The girls insisted that only they would play the parts, or the movie wouldn't get done. You'll feel rewarded by their stubborn streak when you see the film.5. The script - these girls know comedy. Check out the ""Dates From Hell"" scene. You'll bust a gut. Can't wait for the DVD because I've read interviews in which Juergensen says that a lot of hilarious ""Dates From Hell"" material was left on the cutting room floor.",5,5 Reasons to See 'Jessica Stein',1020988800,"05 10, 2002",2002,1650,"['fantastic', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'Even', ""'re"", 'self-defacating', 'person', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'endomorphines', 'pumping', '[', 'will', 'seem', 'funnier', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', ']', 'Here', 'are', '5', 'reasons', 'see', ""'Kissing"", 'Jessica', ""Stein':1"", 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'Heather', 'Juergensen', 'superb', 'actresses', 'are', 'persistent', 'talented', 'entrepreneurs', 'as', 'well', 'sheparded', 'movie', 'development', 'hell', 'produced', 'brilliant', 'movie', '980,000', 'date', 'movie', 'grossed', '6', 'million', 'Let', 'hear', 'perseverance', 'vision', 'Go', 'out', 'support', 'two', 'businesswoman.2', 'talent', 'movie', 'very', 'deep', 'obvious', 'talents', 'two', 'co-stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'especially', 'Jackie', 'Hoffman', 'hilarious', 'Jessica', 'cubicle-mate', '.3', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'setting', 'Studios', 'asked', 'Jennifer', 'Heather', 'consider', 'moving', 'filiming', 'Toronto', 'other', ""'cheap"", 'locales', 'girls', 'insisted', 'New', 'York', 'See', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'anywhere', 'NYC', 'Go', 'see', 'movie', 'get', 'slice', 'what', 'New', 'York', 'special.4', 'stars', 'studios', 'pushed', 'get', ""'name"", 'actresses', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'roles', 'girls', 'insisted', 'only', 'would', 'play', 'parts', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'done', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'rewarded', 'stubborn', 'streak', 'when', 'see', 'film.5', 'script', 'girls', 'know', 'comedy', 'Check', 'Dates', 'Hell', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'bust', 'gut', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'read', 'interviews', 'Juergensen', 'lot', 'hilarious', 'Dates', 'Hell', 'material', 'was', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor']",Kissing Jessica Stein

544241,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00003CYJ4,Benjamin,"[1, 2]","""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is getting blasted here by viewers who were expecting a lesbian romance film, which it is ... and is not. Though it features a lesbian romance between the cute Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, it's not really about that. The film, actually, is about Jessica Stein coming to terms with who she is, what she tolerates and how she can learn to open up to new things, whether they be a bisexual romance or, on a smaller scale, e-mail use.Jessica Stein is a pretty and nice, if snobbish and paranoid, Jewish girl. She works as an editor, has a hang-up about people with bad grammar and has so many pet peeves that she shuts down any potential date before they have a chance to prove themselves. This is what kept her from a relationship with her editor, played by ""Gilmore Girls"" actor Scott Cohen, and is what keeps her from meeting anyone new. But she doesn't see what she's doing wrong.One day, she reads a personal ad from an intelligent prospect who seems just about perfect, even quoting a line from Jessica's favorite philosopher. One thing is wrong, though, for this prospect is a woman. But Jessica, frustrated with her lot, goes out with the girl anyway and ends up, more or less, falling for her. Though intellectually attracted and curious about her new ""friend,"" Jessica, saddled with those pet peeves and an overbearing Jewish mother, can't quite fake her way through a sexual relationship, wherein lies the problem. And just how gay does Jessica have to be? Can she be gay enough or open enough to make her new relationship work?Those expecting a gay movie will be, on the whole, disappointed. Those open to the possibility that the movie's not about romance, but about opening yourself up to chance, will appreciate it more.In the title role, Jennifer Westfeldt does an interesting thing with her character that doesn't quite work. She essentially channels the onscreen personality and line delivery of Diane Keaton, so much so that a friend of mine argued that she seemed possessed by the actress. The movie, because of that, doesn't reach its full potential, seeming mostly like ""Annie Hall Meets a Girl.""But there are intriguing ideas here.",4,"A comedy about loving the person, no matter the sex.",1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,2188,"['Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'getting', 'blasted', 'here', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'lesbian', 'romance', 'film', 'not', 'lesbian', 'romance', 'cute', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'Heather', 'Juergensen', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'actually', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'coming', 'terms', 'who', 'what', 'how', 'can', 'learn', 'open', 'up', 'new', 'things', 'be', 'bisexual', 'romance', 'smaller', 'scale', 'e-mail', 'use.Jessica', 'Stein', 'pretty', 'nice', 'snobbish', 'paranoid', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'editor', 'hang-up', 'people', 'bad', 'grammar', 'so', 'many', 'pet', 'peeves', 'down', 'potential', 'date', 'have', 'chance', 'prove', 'what', 'kept', 'relationship', 'editor', 'played', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'what', 'meeting', 'anyone', 'new', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong.One', 'day', 'personal', 'ad', 'intelligent', 'prospect', 'who', 'just', 'perfect', 'even', 'quoting', 'line', 'Jessica', 'favorite', 'philosopher', 'One', 'thing', 'wrong', 'though', 'prospect', 'woman', 'Jessica', 'frustrated', 'lot', 'out', 'girl', 'anyway', 'up', 'more', 'less', 'falling', 'Though', 'intellectually', 'attracted', 'curious', 'new', 'friend', 'Jessica', 'saddled', 'pet', 'peeves', 'overbearing', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fake', 'way', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'wherein', 'problem', 'just', 'how', 'gay', 'Jessica', 'have', 'be', 'Can', 'be', 'gay', 'enough', 'open', 'enough', 'make', 'new', 'relationship', 'work', 'expecting', 'gay', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'whole', 'disappointed', 'open', 'possibility', 'movie', 'not', 'romance', 'opening', 'chance', 'will', 'appreciate', 'title', 'role', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'interesting', 'thing', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'essentially', 'onscreen', 'personality', 'line', 'delivery', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'so', 'much', 'friend', 'mine', 'argued', 'seemed', 'possessed', 'actress', 'movie', ""n't"", 'reach', 'full', 'potential', 'seeming', 'mostly', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Girl', 'are', 'intriguing', 'ideas', 'here']",Kissing Jessica Stein
544242,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00003CYJ4,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[9, 41]","I recall a girl I used to know from work who once said to me, in the height of her disgust over dating, that she knew of a lesbian who used to sleep with men occasionally just to remember how bad it was.  The girl thought this a great story.  It is with sentiments like hers in mind that ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" was written and made into a motion picture. ""Lesbian chic"" is all the rage today and vengence towards men is an inherent feature of this fad.Lesbianism is propagandized into being a nuclear option to be used against men, and the relationship that we are privy to in this film is drawn clearly to juxtapose men with women as romantic partners.  We find (surprise!) that men are inferior in comparison.  An important question that never arises is how a ship can sail with two captains or how a song can simultaneously feature two soloists.  ""Viva la diffrence"" is a thing of the past and not something to be tolerated any longer today.In this film, we find, much to Jessica's surprise, that society as a whole admires women who sleep with women. I think that's quite accurate.  Homosexuality in America is not only accepted; it is celebrated.  When Jessica informs her friend about the  same sex affair she has embarked upon, she hears not condemnation but that her friend is ""impressed"" as she repeats, ""Wow! Wow! Wow!"" The friend is obsessed with the lesbianic mechanics and wants to know what it's like and how the sex is better than it is with men. What else would the conformists say nowadays? Post sexual revolution, experimentation always equates with enlightenmentAt a wedding, a crowd gathers around Jessica's lover, Helen, and people can't wait to hear all about their exciting and new Feng Shui lifestyle.From the outset, we see that an anti-male stance will be taken in all of what will follow.  The camera provides us with a montage of five ""failed"" dates that Jessica has gone on.  The men portrayed in the opening sequence are strawmen, meaning, no such men actually exist or, if they do, they are statistical aberrations of the greater whole. They are the subject of jeering but, inconveniently, they are not representative in the least.A straight-up, unimaginative view of men is shared with the audience.  The only males depicted sympathetically are non-white, gay, or whimps.  Our alleged sexual inadequacy is an important theme of this film.  A perfect example of this comes when Helen, stares longingly at a matchbox with Jessica's number on it while a lover (one of many) performs oral sex on her.  In another scene, two guys approach them while they're at dinner offering to buy them drinks.  The fellows, despite being 40, are immature jugheads who use words like ""double sexy"" and love lesbians. Outside of pornographic websites, I sincerely doubt that they do.  The real ones do not look or act like Jenna Jameson.Jessica's neurosis, alongside her repressed heterosexuality, is the enemy of this idyllic relationship, but the movie chooses to begin and end with fantasy.  We see that men can forgive and forget everything, while friendships can remain strong despite past sexual entanglements.  The climax we are given turns out not to be a climax but, instead, is a prelude to another climax that begins and ends in the last three minutes.  Overall, set amidst an abysmal soundtrack, Kissing Jessica Stein is a poor movie from start to finish.",2,An Advertisement for  Lesbianism.,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,3380,"['recall', 'girl', 'used', 'know', 'work', 'who', 'once', 'said', 'height', 'disgust', 'dating', 'knew', 'lesbian', 'who', 'used', 'sleep', 'men', 'occasionally', 'just', 'remember', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'girl', 'thought', 'great', 'story', 'sentiments', 'hers', 'mind', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'was', 'written', 'made', 'motion', 'picture', 'Lesbian', 'chic', 'rage', 'today', 'vengence', 'towards', 'men', 'inherent', 'feature', 'fad.Lesbianism', 'propagandized', 'being', 'nuclear', 'option', 'be', 'used', 'men', 'relationship', 'are', 'privy', 'film', 'drawn', 'clearly', 'juxtapose', 'men', 'women', 'romantic', 'partners', 'find', 'surprise', 'men', 'are', 'inferior', 'comparison', 'important', 'question', 'never', 'how', 'ship', 'can', 'sail', 'two', 'captains', 'how', 'song', 'can', 'simultaneously', 'feature', 'two', 'soloists', 'Viva', 'la', 'diffrence', 'thing', 'past', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'tolerated', 'longer', 'today.In', 'film', 'find', 'much', 'Jessica', 'surprise', 'whole', 'admires', 'women', 'who', 'sleep', 'women', 'think', 'quite', 'accurate', 'Homosexuality', 'America', 'not', 'only', 'accepted', 'celebrated', 'When', 'Jessica', 'friend', 'same', 'sex', 'affair', 'embarked', 'not', 'condemnation', 'friend', 'impressed', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'friend', 'obsessed', 'lesbianic', 'mechanics', 'know', 'what', 'how', 'sex', 'better', 'men', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'conformists', 'say', 'nowadays', 'Post', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'experimentation', 'always', 'enlightenmentAt', 'wedding', 'crowd', 'gathers', 'Jessica', 'lover', 'Helen', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hear', 'exciting', 'new', 'Feng', 'Shui', 'outset', 'see', 'anti-male', 'stance', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'what', 'will', 'follow', 'camera', 'montage', 'five', 'failed', 'dates', 'Jessica', 'gone', 'men', 'portrayed', 'opening', 'sequence', 'are', 'strawmen', 'meaning', 'such', 'men', 'actually', 'exist', 'do', 'are', 'statistical', 'aberrations', 'greater', 'whole', 'are', 'subject', 'jeering', 'inconveniently', 'are', 'not', 'representative', 'least.A', 'straight-up', 'unimaginative', 'view', 'men', 'shared', 'audience', 'only', 'males', 'depicted', 'sympathetically', 'are', 'non-white', 'gay', 'whimps', 'alleged', 'sexual', 'inadequacy', 'important', 'theme', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'when', 'Helen', 'longingly', 'matchbox', 'Jessica', 'number', 'lover', 'one', 'many', 'performs', 'oral', 'sex', 'scene', 'two', 'guys', 'approach', ""'re"", 'dinner', 'offering', 'buy', 'drinks', 'fellows', 'being', '40', 'are', 'immature', 'jugheads', 'who', 'use', 'words', 'double', 'sexy', 'love', 'lesbians', 'pornographic', 'websites', 'sincerely', 'doubt', 'do', 'real', 'ones', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'act', 'Jenna', 'Jameson.Jessica', 'neurosis', 'repressed', 'heterosexuality', 'enemy', 'idyllic', 'relationship', 'movie', 'begin', 'end', 'fantasy', 'see', 'men', 'can', 'forgive', 'forget', 'everything', 'friendships', 'can', 'remain', 'strong', 'past', 'sexual', 'entanglements', 'climax', 'are', 'given', 'turns', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'climax', 'instead', 'prelude', 'climax', 'last', 'three', 'minutes', 'Overall', 'set', 'amidst', 'abysmal', 'soundtrack', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'poor', 'movie', 'start', 'finish']",Kissing Jessica Stein

Despite the lesbianism there is little T&A- the leads are rather frumpy, but not unattractive, women. The story is every lesbian's fantasy- seducing a clueless straight girl fed up with the male sex. This banal premise goes nowhere. Jessica's hetero-frustration is portrayed in a montage of bad dates that could only occur in films, so right away emotional realism is tossed, & sets the film up for a failure to connect on anything but a superficial level.

Even though the ad claims to seek `friendship or more' any person over the age of 20 (especially a copy editor) would know this is adspeak for a lesbian relationship. The 30+ Jessica is clueless, & spends the whole film never even attempting to get with it. That Jessica, as portrayed before meeting Helen, could ever be attracted to such a duplicitous & shallow sort as Helen- even if a man- undercuts the whole point of her dates-from-hell montage.

When mousy, perfectionist copyeditor Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) answers a personal ad for &quot;women seeking women&quot; on a whim - she is, and always has been, heterosexual - she meets Helen (Heather Juergenson), a sexy, confident bisexual who works in an art gallery.  The two women click on a deep soul-mate level.  As Jessica begins to find the happiness that has eluded her for so long,  her high spirits are contagious - except to dark but lovable Josh (Scott Cohen), who is perplexed by his own feelings for the newly liberated, but still closeted, Jessica.  Westfeldt and Juergenson, who also co-wrote the screenplay, provide so much depth to their characterizations and situations that the viewer must wrestle with his own expectations. Jessica's awkward and sometimes outrageously funny exploration of what it means to love another woman never takes the easy way out.The chemistry between Westfeldt and Juergenson is so phenomenal that even the most prudish viewer will want them to find happiness together.  Tovah Feldshuh plays Jessica's mother with energy and deep sensitivity; her powerful performance in one scene provides the pivot upon which the entire film turns.  And how can one not like angst-filled, love-stricken Josh the way Cohen plays him?  Even the supporting actors turn in memorable performances.&quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot; is an off-beat romantic comedy that has far more hilarity than its more tired and traditional siblings.

544257,A3BGLVC6OZM2JW,B00003CYJ4,"douglas barton ""emotions in motion""","[3, 6]","Let me put this into the form of a question and you dear reader can answer as to the best of your abilities. What romantic comedy have you seen lately that featured these elements: Let's see, filmed in mid-town Manhattan, our protagonists have cute jobs ( usually in an art gallery or perhaps a chic uptown magazine ) wear even cuter clothes, have huge, gorgeous high ceiling apts. ( which would cost a not-so-small fortune in mid-town! ) and have funny, cute friends who always seem to be terribly understanding and devoted...and of course, at times, even convienently wacky? Add a few well chosen standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn or even any other classic vocalist, throw in a couple of scenes filmed in posh, ultra-chic restaurants ( although everyone's always model thin, of course ) and indeed the movie-going masses will beat a path to the front door of your theatre. Now inserting 'all of the above' into any movie isn't necessarily the makings of a bad film. It's simply that while watching "" Kissing.... "" I feel as though I've seen this done more times then even I can count. Whether it be "" When Harry Met Sally "", "" You've Got Mail "" or anything by Woody Allen ( to which this film owes a debt of gratitude ) watching this movie left me with a vague feeling that while entertaining a true sense of deja vu swept over this viewer. While I've always enjoyed these ' Manhattan fairy tales ' it's gotten to the point where any adult viewer can almost make his/her own laundry list as to the stock in trade characters that will appear on the screen next. But before you think me a true cynic let me explain.....Above all else I will state that watching "" Kissing Jessica Stein "" was not an entirely disagreeable way of killing two hours. The movie does have a certain sense of style and flair that is undeniable. The two leads, Jennifer Westfeld and Heather Juergensen who also happen to have written this off Broadway vignette, have a certain amount of chemistry together. Ms. Juergensen's character Helen especially seemed to have bit more of an edge that was refreshing and I found myself at times wishing the film had concentrated more on her character. As to Jessica herself she, during most of her scenes, came across as far too whiney and indecisive for me to really care about what happened with her. There was the usual stand-bys though....two gay friends who were brought in for comedic relief ( something I've seen countless times ) and a supporting family, in this case Jewish, who seemed comfortable ( and with an acceptance that seemed to come far too easily ) with the idea of their only daughter having entered into an affair with another woman. At times, much of what I was viewing was simply either too far contrived and ultimately far too cozy. Again, entertaining but everything has been polished to a brilliant sheen that effortlessly seemed to skirt any real, serious issues. Plus, and this is what I found truly disingenous....was that other then one of two 'kisses' Jessica and Helen shared they had no other physical contact throughout the film. I realize that many movie-goers may be uncomfortable with the idea of our two female leads having prolonged intimate, physical encounters so it was all simply glossed over. A self-styled "" Will & Grace "" homogenized view of today's Gay society. You know, it's OK being homosexual ( as long as you're shown to be attractive and extremely well dressed of course )....just don't show intimacy or physical carressing to a suburban movie-going public that may feel far too uncomfortable watching anything other then a certain ""gay-lite "" version of what real life is all about for many gay couples/singles in this country. Sadly, it was all terribly predictable.In the end, while I did enjoy "" Kissing Jessica Stein "" I do feel that a golden opportunity had been lost. Although I did actually purchase the soundtrack as well. As to should you own your very own copy of "" Kissing Jessica Stein "", well, that I'm unable to answer but it is worth a view...if nothing else then for the light hearted Gay fairy tale that is all it purports to be. Overall, it was enjoyable if taken with a grain of salt and a sense of humour. 3.5 stars",3,Kiss &Tell,1050019200,"04 11, 2003",2003,4213,"['Let', 'put', 'form', 'question', 'dear', 'reader', 'can', 'answer', 'best', 'abilities', 'What', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', 'seen', 'lately', 'featured', 'elements', 'Let', 'see', 'filmed', 'mid-town', 'Manhattan', 'protagonists', 'have', 'cute', 'jobs', 'usually', 'art', 'gallery', 'perhaps', 'chic', 'uptown', 'magazine', 'wear', 'even', 'cuter', 'clothes', 'have', 'huge', 'gorgeous', 'high', 'ceiling', 'apts', 'would', 'cost', 'not-so-small', 'fortune', 'mid-town', 'have', 'funny', 'cute', 'friends', 'who', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'terribly', 'understanding', 'devoted', 'course', 'times', 'even', 'convienently', 'wacky', 'Add', 'few', 'well', 'chosen', 'standards', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'Sarah', 'Vaughn', 'even', 'other', 'classic', 'vocalist', 'throw', 'couple', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'posh', 'ultra-chic', 'restaurants', 'everyone', 'always', 'model', 'thin', 'course', 'indeed', 'movie-going', 'masses', 'will', 'beat', 'path', 'front', 'door', 'theatre', 'Now', 'inserting', ""'all"", 'above', 'movie', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'makings', 'bad', 'film', 'simply', 'watching', 'Kissing', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'even', 'can', 'count', 'be', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'anything', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'watching', 'movie', 'left', 'vague', 'feeling', 'entertaining', 'true', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'swept', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Manhattan', 'fairy', 'tales', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'adult', 'viewer', 'can', 'almost', 'make', 'his/her', 'own', 'laundry', 'list', 'stock', 'trade', 'characters', 'will', 'appear', 'screen', 'next', 'think', 'true', 'cynic', 'let', 'explain', '..Above', 'else', 'will', 'state', 'watching', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'disagreeable', 'way', 'killing', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'have', 'certain', 'sense', 'style', 'flair', 'undeniable', 'two', 'leads', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeld', 'Heather', 'Juergensen', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'have', 'written', 'off', 'Broadway', 'vignette', 'have', 'certain', 'amount', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Ms.', 'Juergensen', 'character', 'Helen', 'especially', 'seemed', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'edge', 'was', 'refreshing', 'found', 'times', 'wishing', 'film', 'had', 'concentrated', 'more', 'character', 'Jessica', 'most', 'scenes', 'came', 'far', 'too', 'whiney', 'indecisive', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'usual', 'stand-bys', '.two', 'gay', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'brought', 'comedic', 'relief', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'supporting', 'family', 'case', 'Jewish', 'who', 'seemed', 'comfortable', 'acceptance', 'seemed', 'come', 'far', 'too', 'easily', 'idea', 'only', 'daughter', 'having', 'entered', 'affair', 'woman', 'times', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'viewing', 'was', 'simply', 'either', 'too', 'far', 'contrived', 'ultimately', 'far', 'too', 'cozy', 'Again', 'entertaining', 'everything', 'been', 'polished', 'brilliant', 'sheen', 'effortlessly', 'seemed', 'skirt', 'real', 'serious', 'issues', 'what', 'found', 'truly', 'disingenous', '.was', 'other', 'then', 'one', 'two', ""'kisses"", 'Jessica', 'Helen', 'shared', 'had', 'other', 'physical', 'contact', 'film', 'realize', 'many', 'movie-goers', 'may', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'idea', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'having', 'prolonged', 'intimate', 'physical', 'encounters', 'was', 'simply', 'glossed', 'over', 'self-styled', 'Will', 'Grace', 'homogenized', 'view', 'today', 'Gay', 'society', 'know', 'OK', 'being', 'homosexual', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'shown', 'be', 'attractive', 'extremely', 'well', 'dressed', 'course', '.just', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'intimacy', 'physical', 'carressing', 'suburban', 'movie-going', 'public', 'may', 'feel', 'far', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'anything', 'other', 'then', 'certain', 'gay-lite', 'version', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'gay', 'couples/singles', 'country', 'Sadly', 'was', 'terribly', 'end', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'do', 'feel', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'did', 'actually', 'purchase', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'own', 'very', 'own', 'copy', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'well', ""'m"", 'unable', 'answer', 'view', 'nothing', 'else', 'then', 'light', 'hearted', 'Gay', 'fairy', 'tale', 'be', 'Overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'sense', 'humour', '3.5', 'stars']",Kissing Jessica Stein

She is neurotic, funny, quirky, intelligent, and also very likable.  Although she is much more attractive than Woody.She becomes very downhearted about dating and decides to answer a personal ad in the  ""women seeking women"" section because she likes the quote in the ad.The woman who places the ad is Helen. She is funny, smart, but certainly not neurotic like Jess.  She is looking for something different in her life that she hasn't tried before.Eventually they meet....And Jessica goes from downhearted to down right happy.  I am not one to totally rehash an entire movie and it's plot in my reviews. I recommend this movie because it is refreshingly funny, really funny, and just an all around entertaining time out at the cinema. Also, the acting by all the actors is great, especially the actress who plays Jessica's mother, Tovah Feldshuh.  She plays the role of the overbearing mom to perfection.  The script was written by the two actresses that played Jess and Helen, and it is so amazingly well written and produced.

Richards ""Herself""","[3, 3]","This is a nice, light little film with a decent script, charming actors and actresses, and a New York Flavor thicker than the pastrami sandwiches at the Carnegie Deli. And oy, gevalt, it is so deliciously Jewish. The premise of the film is that a somewhat conservative (""vanilla"", not ""political"") young professional woman has wiped out on bad dates with various New York men and decides to answer to a personal ad placed by a woman who shows (on advice of her gay friends) a literary bent.The friendship and romance are developed very believably, as are the reactions of friends and loved ones for both parties. This film does not talk down to the viewer, nor does it pander. It is a sweet, simple story. Although many screenwriting hacks say that a good story is driven by conflict and distopia, this film succeeds in telling a story where *everyone* is a decent person. How refreshing!Having said that, let's describe the DVD itself. The quality is good, the colors have not been tweaked to death. The features are what you expect - you can get subtitles, commentary, and deleted scenes. There's a lot of extra footage about ""Grandma Esther"", who is the granny of one of the people involved in the film. Its a nice little look into the fantasy I certainly have had - ""What if someone threw me in front of a camera in a movie and shouted, 'ACTION!'"" (Tovah Feldsuh gently instructs Grandma Esther - ""Honey, wait 'till they say ""action"" and THEN you can talk."")The chatty commentary is interesting. One is the director and cameraman and they go on about sweeps, pans, angles, and other technical stuff. The other is the two women who wrote and starred in it. They go more into  the story. Both commentaries agree that the film had a lot of kind benefactors who had the coolest apartments in New York City.I think commentary is the best thing about DVDs. I love hearing the people talking about all the folks who don't get a lot of recognition for their work in film - these folks acknowledged contributions from everyone from the catering truck to the production assistants who had to run out and buy juice for a prop to a neighborhood cat who just happened to sit itself down right in the middle of a fruit stand to grab some screentime.",4,Charming Indie Film - Great New York Flavor,1037577600,"11 18, 2002",2002,2239,"['nice', 'light', 'little', 'film', 'decent', 'script', 'charming', 'actors', 'actresses', 'New', 'York', 'Flavor', 'thicker', 'pastrami', 'sandwiches', 'Carnegie', 'Deli', 'oy', 'gevalt', 'so', 'deliciously', 'Jewish', 'premise', 'film', 'somewhat', 'conservative', 'vanilla', 'not', 'political', 'young', 'professional', 'woman', 'wiped', 'out', 'bad', 'dates', 'various', 'New', 'York', 'men', 'decides', 'answer', 'personal', 'ad', 'placed', 'woman', 'who', 'advice', 'gay', 'friends', 'literary', 'bent.The', 'friendship', 'romance', 'are', 'developed', 'very', 'believably', 'are', 'reactions', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'parties', 'film', 'not', 'talk', 'viewer', 'pander', 'sweet', 'simple', 'story', 'many', 'screenwriting', 'hacks', 'say', 'good', 'story', 'driven', 'conflict', 'distopia', 'film', 'telling', 'story', 'where', '*everyone*', 'decent', 'person', 'How', 'refreshing', 'Having', 'said', 'let', 'describe', 'DVD', 'quality', 'good', 'colors', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'tweaked', 'death', 'features', 'are', 'what', 'expect', 'can', 'get', 'subtitles', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'lot', 'extra', 'footage', 'Grandma', 'Esther', 'who', 'granny', 'one', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'nice', 'little', 'look', 'fantasy', 'certainly', 'have', 'had', 'What', 'someone', 'threw', 'front', 'camera', 'movie', 'shouted', 'Tovah', 'Feldsuh', 'gently', 'Grandma', 'Esther', 'Honey', 'wait', 'say', 'action', 'THEN', 'can', 'talk', 'chatty', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'One', 'director', 'cameraman', 'go', 'sweeps', 'pans', 'angles', 'other', 'technical', 'stuff', 'other', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'wrote', 'starred', 'go', 'more', 'story', 'commentaries', 'agree', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'kind', 'benefactors', 'who', 'had', 'coolest', 'apartments', 'New', 'York', 'City.I', 'think', 'commentary', 'best', 'thing', 'DVDs', 'love', 'hearing', 'people', 'talking', 'folks', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'recognition', 'work', 'film', 'folks', 'acknowledged', 'contributions', 'everyone', 'catering', 'truck', 'production', 'assistants', 'who', 'had', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'juice', 'prop', 'neighborhood', 'cat', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'sit', 'down', 'right', 'middle', 'fruit', 'stand', 'grab', 'screentime']",Kissing Jessica Stein

Heather is a very different person from Jessica, open, friendly, outgoing, not uptight, and these qualities appeal to Jessica, it seems.

Eventually the two live together and enjoy a relatively happy relationship, although it turns platonic. Despite the fact that the relationship ends, Jessica's life is changed and it was a life affirming relationship for her, but ultimately not what she was looking for. Therein lies the draw and power of this story; two people work hard to give each other a shot, like people should in any kind of relationship, and when they split, they take away a feeling of being richer for the experience rather than bitterness that accompanies the end of many relationships.

Still, I had it for awhile before I got around to watching it, sure it would be too racy for my father...I ended up watching it with my mother and wondered why I waited so long!  Jessica is a nice Jewish girl working as a copyeditor, who's gone on a series of hilariously bad dates.  (anyone who's been on jdate or match can relate!) She answers an ad by Helen, who has put in a Rilke quote that Jessica had just admired, but is conflicted about it:  in part she was provoked by Josh at a dinner party who told her she was too picky and closed-minded.  Josh is both her boss, and an old college boyfriend.Jessica and Helen click, but Jessica really is straight and it takes her a while to work up to being fully sexual with Helen.  Nevertheless, she does fall in love, and a scene just before her brother's wedding, in which her mother (delightfully played by Tovah Feldshuh) lets on that she knows, is really touching.  In general the portrayal of the Jewish family from Scarsdale is both funny and loving; no cheap, mean satire here.But-- this is not really a coming out film, or a film whose treatise is that beneath every straight girl lies a bisexual girl waiting to be released.

Its cover has always deterred me from renting it -- it just seemed too immature-ish and teenage-esque.

Well, after over a decade of dodging it, I am remorsefully admitting how absolutely wrong I was to not have watched it sooner. It's lighthearted, true; but the main subject of the movie is quite heavy, when applied to the real world, so, in my opinion, the two stars, Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt  (who also wrote the script) have picked just the right delivery mode (and mood).It is a good movie, with a positive message.

544267,A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0,B00003CYJ4,I. Westray,"[7, 7]","This movie, to my mild surprise, had a lot going for it the second time around. I saw it in the theater, originally, and took it as a pleasant little movie about learning to take risks (with an almost incidental twist about sexual preference). Seeing it again, though, I was struck that it's not as simple as the sitcom of your choosing. It's got some ideas in its head -- that Rilke quote about inertia and shyness is one -- and there are several moments when it doesn't give you exactly what you're wanting, which is always a shock of fresh air in a pop movie.Let's see... what's a good example to use of all that? How about the funny little montage of bad dates near the beginning? We're meant to laugh at those, sure -- and hey, a copy editor on a date with a man who describes himself as ""self-defecating,"" that's funny. But Josh has a point at the party a bit later; he lays into Jessica for her quick judgments about all those men, and suddenly their faults don't sound so earthshaking, do they? So, how real were those bad dates? Were those just Jessica's impressions of them? We don't really know. The movie gave us the laughs, but then it asked a question. I like that.Another thing that struck me, both times, was the wonderful casting and the nice writing, even for the minor roles. This isn't like a prefab modern romantic comedy, where at least one of the main characters always has a sort of Greek chorus of zany sidekick friends who feel like assembled parts from the bin of character actors Hollywood keeps out back. Tovah Feldshuh as Jessica's mother is fantastic, in a part that had to be pretty slight on paper. Jessica's pregnant friend at work and Helen's gay friends feel like real individuals, not like the one-episode romantic interests on Friends, you know? The smallest roles are still memorable -- Helen's bike messenger man tries on a cowboy hat, and her jealous lover at the studio glares, and the dissheveled man comes up from the covers with a completely wonderful expression on his face... they're all distinctive and well-played.That's leaving alone the three main roles. Jessica and Helen and Josh are all dead-on. This is the sort of movie that gives its characters good arguments to make, not just lines that represent who they're supposed to be in the story, you know? Sure, Jessica has a modest dash of stock writing: she's Jewish, her mother's trying to fix her up, and so on. But I believed in her, and I liked her, and the questions the movie was asking about her life held my interest -- more than once now.And that's what this one comes down to, I think. If you ""buy"" the characters, as individuals, then you're going to appreciate the movie. There are going to be some people who can't do that. One of the other reviews here decided the movie wasn't a good example of how lesbianism happens, I guess, and gave it one star. (It's unclear whether that person saw the scene in which the gay couple argues over that exact point. Another question, to the credit of the movie.) These are individuals, not representatives of their races or classes or anything else. They aren't making up the rules for all Jewish people, or all lesbians -- the movie's about how, having been kissed, Jessica has some choices to make, and decides, tentatively, to make up her own rules with Helen.And if you don't try to make the decisions for her, you'll probably enjoy watching.",4,"Decent, funny little movie, on individual terms",1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,3400,"['movie', 'mild', 'surprise', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'theater', 'originally', 'took', 'pleasant', 'little', 'movie', 'learning', 'take', 'risks', 'almost', 'incidental', 'twist', 'sexual', 'preference', 'Seeing', 'again', 'was', 'struck', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'sitcom', 'choosing', 'got', 'ideas', 'head', 'Rilke', 'quote', 'inertia', 'shyness', 'one', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'when', ""n't"", 'give', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'always', 'shock', 'fresh', 'air', 'pop', 'movie.Let', 'see', 'what', 'good', 'example', 'use', 'How', 'funny', 'little', 'montage', 'bad', 'dates', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'meant', 'laugh', 'sure', 'hey', 'copy', 'editor', 'date', 'man', 'who', 'self-defecating', 'funny', 'Josh', 'point', 'party', 'bit', 'later', 'Jessica', 'quick', 'judgments', 'men', 'suddenly', 'faults', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'so', 'earthshaking', 'do', 'So', 'how', 'real', 'were', 'bad', 'dates', 'Were', 'just', 'Jessica', 'impressions', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'movie', 'gave', 'laughs', 'then', 'asked', 'question', 'thing', 'struck', 'times', 'was', 'wonderful', 'casting', 'nice', 'writing', 'even', 'minor', 'roles', ""n't"", 'prefab', 'modern', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'where', 'least', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'always', 'sort', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'zany', 'sidekick', 'friends', 'who', 'feel', 'assembled', 'parts', 'bin', 'character', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'back', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Jessica', 'mother', 'fantastic', 'part', 'had', 'be', 'pretty', 'slight', 'paper', 'Jessica', 'pregnant', 'friend', 'work', 'Helen', 'gay', 'feel', 'real', 'individuals', 'not', 'one-episode', 'romantic', 'interests', 'Friends', 'know', 'smallest', 'roles', 'are', 'still', 'memorable', 'Helen', 'bike', 'messenger', 'man', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'jealous', 'lover', 'studio', 'glares', 'dissheveled', 'man', 'up', 'covers', 'completely', 'wonderful', 'expression', 'face', ""'re"", 'distinctive', 'well-played.That', 'leaving', 'alone', 'three', 'main', 'roles', 'Jessica', 'Helen', 'Josh', 'are', 'dead-on', 'sort', 'movie', 'characters', 'good', 'arguments', 'make', 'not', 'just', 'lines', 'represent', 'who', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'know', 'Sure', 'Jessica', 'modest', 'dash', 'stock', 'writing', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'trying', 'fix', 'up', 'so', 'believed', 'liked', 'questions', 'movie', 'was', 'asking', 'life', 'held', 'interest', 'more', 'once', 'now.And', 'what', 'one', 'down', 'think', 'buy', 'characters', 'individuals', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'One', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'decided', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'example', 'how', 'lesbianism', 'guess', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'unclear', 'person', 'saw', 'scene', 'gay', 'couple', 'exact', 'point', 'question', 'credit', 'movie', 'are', 'individuals', 'not', 'representatives', 'races', 'classes', 'anything', 'else', 'are', ""n't"", 'making', 'up', 'rules', 'Jewish', 'people', 'lesbians', 'movie', 'how', 'having', 'been', 'kissed', 'Jessica', 'choices', 'make', 'decides', 'tentatively', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'rules', 'Helen.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'decisions', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching']",Kissing Jessica Stein

Desperation causes her to answer a personal ad in the paper placed by Helen (Heather Juergensen), the bisexual, adventurous and passionate manager of an art gallery. The subsequent closet relationship progresses from unsure trepidation (on Jessica's part) to a full-scale lesbian affair that generates a ""guess who's coming to dinner"" tension when Jessica brings Helen, a shikse, to meet her family gathered together for her brother's wedding. Of course, Mom (Tovah Feldshuh) has always wanted her daughter to wed a nice (and successful) Jewish boy, and hasn't been shy about matchmaking. Oy!This isn't a bad film by any means. All of the principle characters are attractive and sympathetic.  However, except for one poignant heart-to-heart between Jessica and her mother, the emotional depths and pitfalls of a relationship with a same-sex lover are barely plumbed. This is not a deep film in any sense, and Jessica dances across what could be a potential minefield relatively unscathed. It's as if the film's producers didn't know whether to make it a comedy or drama, and by the final scene I wasn't sure why they'd bothered. Perhaps they thought it would raise more eyebrows in Traditional America. And maybe it did.

She?s a mess of perfectionism and neurosis, and her love life is just plain lousy. The movie opens with a montage of disastrous first dates that collectively bring Jessica to a breaking point. She is desperate to find someone with whom to share her life. When she spots a personal ad quoting her favorite poet, it catches her attention. Only one problem, it?s a woman?and Jessica is straight. Isn?t she? She?s so fed up with men that she?s actually ready to try something a little different, so against her better judgment, she meets with Helen, the art gallery manager who placed the ad.Much to her surprise, they have a lot in common and, after a few hilarious false starts, they stumble their way into an awkward romance, the first same-sex romance either of them has ever had. Helen is a lot more relaxed about this new state of affairs than Jessica. Jessica is especially scared of telling her friends and her traditional Jewish mother that she is in a lesbian relationship. The issue is forced to a head when she must decide whether or not to bring Helen to her brother?s wedding. Will Jessica be able to maintain her relationship with Helen, and is she even really a lesbian?Kissing Jessica Stein was based on the off-Broadway play Lipschtick, which was written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, who starred in the original stage production as well as this film adaptation.

544278,A1OWJKPPCQNFES,B00003CYJ4,"Justin McGill ""Justin McGill""","[1, 1]","Some people just don't ""get it"". I really don't understand why. People see ""Chasing Amy"" and say.. ""well she really wasn't GAY then"". Characters in the movie say something along the lines of ""Well.. you're born GAY."" My question is, do you HAVE to be? Is this wrong to decide to come to it on your own terms? Someone quoted on the bottom says that the in the film Jessica only wants her boyfriend to notice her again.. which she accomplishes. Well he DOES notice her again. but, I don't think she ever fell for him again EITHER. Is the viewer saying Jessica as a female (gay,bi or hetero) still can't have a MALE friend? If this is what they are saying then that frightens me.. and does that mean that gay persons hate all others of the opposite gender? The ending isn't a pat Hollywood ending.. but I don't really classify this as the typical ""Indie"" fare, but.. the women, neither Jessica nor Helen, were GAY.Onto the film. Helen a rather free spirit, and lets just face the fact, promiscuous woman on a whim places a personal ad seeking a woman.. Enter Jessica of the title who answers, hesitantly, and the two hit it off. Neither really have a feel for BEING gay... but I think neither have really found what they wanted where they were. This film tracks the slow and neurotic Jessica on her journey to try and accept who she might be.I will not say Jessica is gay... or straight, that's a value judgment without really knowing someone. Even in the film, you really don't know for sure. Jessica is a guarded, secretive and neurotic but sweet woman. While Helen being kind.. is more a physical agressive type. The film resolves with no answers.. there is no ""we see the man and woman ride off into the sunset"". This is more akin to ""Chasing Amy"" but, on a lighter note as opposed to the heavy and rather dramatic ending with a Dave Pirner composition.. It's still very much left open.. sure, you can conclude Jessica ends back up with her boyfriend.. You may think she ends up with the cute girl with glasses.. But the film offers no real answer. It says nothing against gays, or for. Film many seem to want to see as propaganda. And they want it to present a certain ""viewpoint"". And those films that don't are ""explotive, vile, or garbage"".People are all different.. and it's nice to see something that.. someone doesn't quite know where they are.. and maybe she is straight, maybe she isn't. I don't know, but I enjoyed seeing her make the connections. It's a character film and surprisingly good performances from the producer and writer of the film, and a turn from Scott Cohen as the frustrated editor. Surprising, perhaps to me, for only noticing before Cohen in a game for the PC called ""Ripper"" and several tv commercials. Over all though a uniform well acted, and written film.. Sure, at times it may have been too cute.. and times, it may have been too pat.. but at the end of the movie, if a romantic film works.. then it's done its job, this is one of the FEW films in the genre of the last few years that does.. and straight, bi, or gay.. It's still a good watch for anyone... and everyone. While it may not pull your particular ""party line"", that's ok too.. It's only a movie, its not a speech, or a statement. It doesn't speak for or to everyone.. and its not supposed to.. It shows two people, maybe not the poster girls for any gay organization but it was sweet.. and heartfelt.

544284,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003CYJ4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a nice, young Jewish girl who cannot find herself a man.  Based on the montage of some of the worst (and funniest) first dates in history, a reasonable course of action would be for Jessica to just stop looking.  However, as Woody Allen observed so long ago the heart is a resilient little muscle, so Jessica answers a ""women seeking women"" ad placed by Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), who is bisexual.  But since Helen is straight this would actually give them something in common to talk about, namely men, except that Helen has a lot more success with men, at least in terms of sex.As you watch ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" it becomes clear that both women are looking for love rather than sex, which is perfect because this film is not about sex, and those who are looking for really hot lesbian sex scenes should just go rent ""Mulholland Drive.""  The question here is not just whether the girl will get the girl, but what they are going to do when that finally happens.  Then there is Josh Myers (Scott Cohen), Jessica's college boy friend, who now speaks of her with the same sort of practiced cynicism he reserves for the rest of the world.  She disregards his jabs, and her disdain eventually inspires him to reconsider Jessica.  However, we do not think as highly of Josh as he does himself, and there is something intrinsically sweet about the relationship between Jessica and Helen.  Besides, the biggest obstacle to their happiness is not Josh, but Jessica herself, which remains both the character's curse and her charm.Helen is not sure what to expect when Jessica shows up, but someone who is not only straight but who also brings a bunch of manuals and handbooks about lesbians would not have been a high expectation.  Getting physical proves difficult because they are so many places where Jessica does not want to be touched, but there is an undeniable something between the two young women that serves as the basis for a relationship, with or without benefits.  Once Helen becomes aware that Jessica loves her, she suddenly shows a patience that we would not have expected from her.  Yet Helen is even more uncomfortable with the idea of her family and friends knowing about their relationship than she is with actual physical intimacy, and there is no doubt that things will come to a head between them.Westfeldt and Juergensen first created and played the characters of Jessica and Helen for their stage play ""Lipschtick,"" which certainly explains why they are both so totally comfortable in their roles.  As writers they have created a script that is smart and witty, and one of the biggest surprises is that they do not give the film's best moment to themselves but to Tovah Feldshuh as Judy Stein, Jessica's mother.  I have been a fan of Feldshuh's ever since she played Katharine Hepburn in ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" and Helena Slomova in ""Holocaust.""  Catching her as Danielle Melnick on ""Law and Order"" has always been a treat as well, so it was nice to see she was in this movie.  But I was still blown away by her mother-daughter talk with Jessica, and the exquisitely powerful delivery of a single line.  This is one of those memorable jewels of a moment in a movie where you know you will never forget it and just thinking about it invokes its power.The DVD of ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" has two commentary tracks, the first with director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and the second with co-stars and co-writers Westfeldt and Juergensen.  It will not surprise you that the latter is both more interesting and more insightful.  There are a series of deleted scenes, including some choice outtakes from the bad date montage, and a standard behind the scenes featurette.  ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is not a great romantic comedy, but it is very good, which makes it stand out in that genre, especially with regards to same sex romantic comedies.  Besides, any romance that treats both the heart and the head with equal regard is worth checking out.",4,"When it comes to love, Jessica just can't think straight...",1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,4039,"['Jessica', 'Stein', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'nice', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'man', 'Based', 'montage', 'worst', 'funniest', 'first', 'history', 'reasonable', 'course', 'action', 'would', 'be', 'Jessica', 'just', 'stop', 'looking', 'However', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'observed', 'so', 'long', 'heart', 'resilient', 'little', 'muscle', 'so', 'Jessica', 'women', 'seeking', 'women', 'ad', 'placed', 'Helen', 'Cooper', 'Heather', 'Juergensen', 'who', 'bisexual', 'Helen', 'straight', 'would', 'actually', 'give', 'something', 'common', 'talk', 'namely', 'men', 'Helen', 'lot', 'more', 'success', 'men', 'least', 'terms', 'sex.As', 'watch', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'clear', 'women', 'are', 'looking', 'love', 'rather', 'sex', 'perfect', 'film', 'not', 'sex', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'really', 'hot', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scenes', 'should', 'just', 'go', 'rent', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'question', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'girl', 'will', 'get', 'girl', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'when', 'finally', 'Then', 'Josh', 'Myers', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'Jessica', 'college', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'now', 'same', 'sort', 'practiced', 'cynicism', 'reserves', 'rest', 'world', 'disregards', 'jabs', 'disdain', 'eventually', 'reconsider', 'Jessica', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'highly', 'Josh', 'something', 'intrinsically', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'Jessica', 'Helen', 'Besides', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'happiness', 'not', 'Josh', 'Jessica', 'character', 'curse', 'charm.Helen', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'Jessica', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'straight', 'who', 'also', 'bunch', 'manuals', 'handbooks', 'lesbians', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'expectation', 'Getting', 'physical', 'proves', 'difficult', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'Jessica', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'touched', 'undeniable', 'something', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'basis', 'relationship', 'benefits', 'Once', 'Helen', 'becomes', 'aware', 'Jessica', 'suddenly', 'patience', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'Helen', 'even', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'idea', 'family', 'friends', 'knowing', 'relationship', 'actual', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'doubt', 'things', 'will', 'come', 'head', 'them.Westfeldt', 'Juergensen', 'first', 'created', 'played', 'characters', 'Jessica', 'Helen', 'stage', 'play', 'Lipschtick', 'certainly', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'totally', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'script', 'smart', 'witty', 'one', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'best', 'moment', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Judy', 'Stein', 'Jessica', 'mother', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Feldshuh', 'ever', 'played', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Amazing', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Helena', 'Slomova', 'Holocaust', 'Catching', 'Danielle', 'Melnick', 'Law', 'Order', 'always', 'been', 'treat', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'blown', 'away', 'mother-daughter', 'talk', 'Jessica', 'exquisitely', 'powerful', 'delivery', 'single', 'line', 'one', 'memorable', 'jewels', 'moment', 'movie', 'where', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'just', 'thinking', 'power.The', 'DVD', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'first', 'director', 'Charles', 'Herman-Wurmfeld', 'cinematographer', 'Lawrence', 'Sher', 'second', 'co-stars', 'co-writers', 'Westfeldt', 'Juergensen', 'will', 'not', 'surprise', 'latter', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'insightful', 'are', 'series', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'choice', 'outtakes', 'bad', 'date', 'montage', 'standard', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'not', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'very', 'good', 'stand', 'out', 'genre', 'especially', 'regards', 'same', 'sex', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Besides', 'romance', 'heart', 'head', 'equal', 'regard', 'checking', 'out']",Kissing Jessica Stein

Both are typical New York urbanites, both are young and pretty and both have had their share of men.  But then, on a whim, Helen puts an ad in the newspaper seeking a woman.  Also on a whim, Jessica answers. The results are both real and funny and I found myself laughing out loud as they awkwardly get to know each other and ultimately fall in love.  There are complications of course.  Jessica's Jewish mother (Tovah Feldshuh) keeps trying to play matchmaker with a wide variety of men, her boss and former boyfriend (Scott Cohen) is still interested in her, and her brother's wedding is coming up to which she is reluctant to invite Helen.I totally enjoyed this film.  It was the New York I know with the exception of the downtown skyline, which I understand, was purposely avoided because of the 9/11 tragedy. The characters were individuals, not stereotypes and the humor was really funny.  The director, Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, was able bring the humor to every scene and kept the tone lighthearted and real.  I'm not so sure I liked the ending, but there are hints throughout and certain inevitability to it.  Don't miss this small gem.

544286,AD2BIAIH78QI5,B00003CYJ4,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[16, 19]","I saw the previews of ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" and thought it looked like a funny movie about a Jewish American Princess's flirtation with the idea of embarking on a lesbian relationship. The trailers said Jessica would have to choose between ""a man who's almost impossible, and the woman who's almost perfect."" I thought I had figured out the movie darn near entirely from the coming attractions, and that I would be in command at the movie.But I was wrong. The movie took some turns I didn't really expect. Frankly, I was honestly shocked that Jessica and Helen truly do become lovers--I thought it was going to remain that Jessica wouldn't be able to ""go all the way"", a parody of '50s cheerleaders and their Ken doll boyfriends. I wasn't prepared for the actual realization of their lesbian affair. I wasn't in control at all--I didn't know where it was going to go, and what was going to happen. But despite the unease that did cause in me, I thought this was a really funny movie, but yet not one without poignance.I was genuinely moved by the scene between Jessica and her mom, played by Tovah Feldshuh, as the mother demonstrates a better knowledge of her daughter than Jessica suspected. She provides such an absolution to her daughter that I felt so desperately unhappy for all those who can never come out to their families, who must keep such a large and integral part of themselves unspoken.Why only 4 stars, and not 5? Like some of the previous reviewers, I thought the ending was something of a cop-out. At the last minute, they decided to play it safe. Now, I'm a straightGal, but if I were a lesbian, I know I'd be disappointed by the last scene. However, I suppose the best way to look at it is this: The movie made a lot of strides as it was, showing attractive women as positive gay role models. I'm sure most folks would have to agree that the earliest attempts to dare depict male homosexual themes in mainstream American movies could only go so far. So why would you think that ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" ought to be different and could go the full distance as one of the first mainstream lesbian-themed movies?Like John Hurt's wonderful depiction of Quentin Crisp in ""The Naked Civil Servant"", the two performances in ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" have given me something to think about in regards to attitudes towards same-sex relationships, while being very funny to boot. I'd recommend this movie to anyone except the extremely conservative, but maybe even they might be surprised by their own reactions.",4,"I Laughed, but There Were Surprises in Store for Me",1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,2521,"['saw', 'previews', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'thought', 'looked', 'funny', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'American', 'Princess', 'flirtation', 'idea', 'embarking', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'trailers', 'said', 'Jessica', 'would', 'have', 'choose', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'impossible', 'woman', 'who', 'almost', 'perfect', 'thought', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'movie', 'darn', 'entirely', 'coming', 'attractions', 'would', 'be', 'command', 'movie.But', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'took', 'turns', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'Frankly', 'was', 'honestly', 'shocked', 'Jessica', 'Helen', 'truly', 'do', 'become', 'lovers', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'remain', 'Jessica', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'go', 'way', 'parody', ""'50s"", 'cheerleaders', 'Ken', 'doll', 'boyfriends', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'actual', 'realization', 'lesbian', 'affair', 'was', ""n't"", 'control', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'unease', 'did', 'cause', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'yet', 'not', 'one', 'poignance.I', 'was', 'genuinely', 'moved', 'scene', 'Jessica', 'mom', 'played', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'mother', 'better', 'knowledge', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'suspected', 'such', 'absolution', 'daughter', 'felt', 'so', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'come', 'families', 'who', 'must', 'keep', 'large', 'integral', 'part', 'unspoken.Why', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'something', 'cop-out', 'last', 'minute', 'decided', 'play', 'safe', 'Now', ""'m"", 'straightGal', 'were', 'lesbian', 'know', ""'d"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'last', 'scene', 'However', 'suppose', 'best', 'way', 'look', 'movie', 'made', 'lot', 'strides', 'was', 'showing', 'attractive', 'women', 'positive', 'gay', 'role', 'models', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'folks', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'earliest', 'attempts', 'dare', 'depict', 'male', 'homosexual', 'themes', 'mainstream', 'American', 'movies', 'could', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'why', 'would', 'think', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'ought', 'be', 'different', 'could', 'go', 'full', 'distance', 'one', 'first', 'mainstream', 'lesbian-themed', 'movies', 'John', 'Hurt', 'wonderful', 'depiction', 'Quentin', 'Crisp', 'Naked', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'two', 'performances', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'have', 'given', 'something', 'think', 'regards', 'attitudes', 'same-sex', 'relationships', 'being', 'very', 'funny', 'boot', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'maybe', 'even', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'own', 'reactions']",Kissing Jessica Stein

544289,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00003CYJ4,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[6, 6]","Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen have such fascinating on-screen chemistry and I think that is why ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" succeeds so well...After an optimistic but nightmarish dating spree, neurotic New York journalist Jessica Stein happens upon an intriguing personal ad whose only drawback is that it's in the 'women seeking women' section. On a daring whim, she decides to answer it, and, to her surprise, ends up instantly clicking with downtown hipster Helen Cooper. The women proceed to muddle through an earnest courtship in which they are forced to make it up as they go along. ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" has the look and feel of a smart, stylish New York romantic comedy in which the principals are articulate and forthright about their intelligence and sophistication. Yet for an American film it is a groundbreaker in exploring the realm of sexual fluidity, and it does so with wit, wisdom and in a completely entertaining fashion. It has the sheen of a polished Hollywood production but is never glossy or glib as it deals with serious matters with delicacy, good humor and, at times, outright hilarity. It's a low-key comedy with a risque hook -- a seemingly straight woman dabbles in lesbianism -- yet it maintains an old-fashioned faith in literate dialogue, believable behavior and themes that reach beyond the plot points.Like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon with ""Good Will Hunting,"" co-stars Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt wrote ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" as a way to get themselves better roles than they were (or weren't) being offered. Westfeldt plays the title character, a neurotic Jewish New York newspaper copy editor who manages to stand apart from the various other neurotic Jewish New Yorkers we've seen on film. In slender build and nervous energy, Westfeldt suggests a Lisa Kudrow type, but Jessica's flakiness is rooted in too much -- rather than not enough -- thinking: She's so compulsively rational that she stifles any spontaneous feelings.Juergensen's Helen Cooper, an outgoing Soho art gallery manager, has no such fears of impulsiveness. Helen, whose features are as full as Jessica's are fine, is casually juggling three male lovers but feels a void. So she takes out a woman-to-woman personal ad that Jessica, in a rare quick-reflex reaction, answers, the selling point being a Rilke quote about opening oneself up to possibilities.Much of the humor of ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" lies in these two likable, odd-couplish women trying to construct a relationship from scratch. While Helen is gung-ho to get to the physical side of things, Jessica is busy studying lesbian-sex pamphlets and studying Helen's method of blending lipsticks.The movie has its broader gags, too, some that score -- such as Jessica's mom (a wonderful Tovah Feldshuh) and grandmother (a very cute and funny Esther Wurmfeld) conspicuously scoping out the Yom Kippur service crowd for potential Jessica fix-ups -- and some that cover overly familiar ground -- such as the parade of capital-L Loser dates that Jessica must endure before meeting Helen.But what enables ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" to overcome its awkward moments and ragged patches is its truthfulness. Westfeldt and Juergensen have written and portrayed these characters with a high level of specificity. Helen may be the less fleshed-out of the two, but we get a real sense of her world and a restlessness that is borne less of frustration than an eagerness to experience more.The lesbian content may titillate some and scare off others -- though the movie shows nothing more graphic than kissing -- but that's not really what ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is about. It's about the need to take a daring leap to discover who you truly are. Various characters see their risk-taking open up new possibilities. The same might be said of Westfeldt and Juergensen, who should reap the rewards of having thrown their considerable energies into the perilous indie film world and emerged with an engaging, original work.

544293,A36EMEZX84IKSB,B00003CYJ4,Michael Greenwaldt,"[4, 5]","KISSING JESSICA STEIN (2002)Kissing Jessica Stein is a low budget romantic comedy about a neurotic New York journalist who, after a series of bad dates, decides to answer a personal ad that catches her eye, the only problem is that it's in the ""women seeking women"" section----and she's straight.Thankfully ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" was able to live up to its catchy concept, resulting in one of the best and most original romantic comedies I've seen in quite some time. It's sort of like a same sex version of ""When Harry Met Sally,"" in fact you could even call it ""When Sally Met Sally."" Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, who star as Jessica and Helen, also wrote the wonderfully clever script. I must say these two real life best friends have a lot of talent, not only do they give two very natural and charming performances, but they also wrote this gem of a film. The character of Jessica could have been semi-annoying if she were played by anyone else, but Westfeldt gives Jessica the right amount of charm and cuteness to make us love her. Westfeldt, who is like a cross between Jennifer Aniston and Helent Hunt, and Juergensen, who is like a younger Janeane Garofalo, are definitely quite a find. They were able to take a controversial topic and create a light and fun film that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. Now that's not to say that it doesn't have its serious moments, one particular scene involving Jessica and her mother, Judy (Tovah Feldshuh), was quite touching. I loved how the simple line ""I think she's a very nice girl"" was able to make such an unbelievably huge impact.I think anyone, male/female or gay/straight, will be able to relate to ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" in one way or another. It's not easy finding someone you can ""click"" with and it can seem hopeless sometimes, like you will never find ""the one."" So when you actually do find someone you ""click"" with, it's a great feeling. In ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" Jessica is shocked when her date with Helen ends up being one of the best dates she's ever been on. She finds herself confused because she has finally found someone she ""clicks"" with, except it's not a man, and she's not a lesbian. Jessica, not sure what to do, pursues a relationship with Helen. This leads to a number of funny moments with Jessica trying to be turned on by Helen and trying to find herself by experimenting, at one point she even breaks out the how-to books on lesbianism.Another thing I really enjoyed about ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" was the music. I usually don't like Jazz but the songs went perfect with the film, especially the very fun and catchy ""When The Special Girlfriend"" by Ute Lemper.Overall, I really appreciated the originality of this film. I hope the Academy remembers it come Oscar time because it deserves to at least be nominated, especially for ""Best Original Screenplay,"" which it deserves to win. I also must say for such a small budget the film looked great, director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld did a top notch job.  It had the feel of a Woody Allen movie, although it was better than any Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. It delivered everything it promised and more. I didn't even mind the ending, which a lot of people seem to have a problem with. At first I was disappointed when it started going in that direction because there's a spot where it could have ended perfectly (you'll see what I mean when you see it), but in the end I thought they pulled it off really well.

544294,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00003CYJ4,Michael J. Mazza,"[89, 94]","""Kissing Jessica Stein,"" directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, tells the story of a young, single, Jewish professional woman in New York City (the Jessica of the title, played by Jennifer Westfeldt). She's fed up with men after a series of bad experiences. Intrigued by a ""woman-seeks-woman"" personal ad, Jessic decides to give lesbianism a try. The object of her often clumsy affection is Helen (Heather Juergensen), a sexy art gallery manager.This movie hooked me from its outrageous opening scene, in which Jessica, her mother, and her grandmother bicker and gossip about men during a Day of Atonement service. ""Jessica"" is a wonderfully funny and sweet film, filled with witty dialogue and some genuinely touching moments. The ensemble cast is superb. Westfeldt and Juergensen shine in the lead roles. Westfeldt, who looks remarkably like Lisa Kudrow, is reminiscent of a young female Woody Allen in this quirky, neurotic role. Juergensen brings an irreverent sensuality to her role. The two are delicious together. Although the whole supporting cast is great, I was particularly moved by Tovah Feldshuh as Jessica's loving mother.I'm sure people will be tempted to pigeonhole ""Jessica"" as a ""lesbian"" movie, a ""New York"" movie, and/or a ""Jewish"" movie. It's certainly all of these, but its charm and universality also transcend all categories. It's about love, family ties, friendship, self-knowledge, and other issues that are relevant to everybody. And the film is populated with a wonderful group of characters -- male and female, Jewish and gentile, straight, gay, and ""bi-curious"" -- who are treated with affection and respect by the filmmakers. My advice: whatever your own preferences, prepare to kiss ""Jessica"" and love it.",5,"Pucker up for ""Jessica""!",1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,1735,"['Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'directed', 'Charles', 'Herman-Wurmfeld', 'story', 'young', 'single', 'Jewish', 'professional', 'woman', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Jessica', 'title', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'fed', 'up', 'men', 'series', 'bad', 'experiences', 'Intrigued', 'woman-seeks-woman', 'personal', 'ad', 'Jessic', 'give', 'lesbianism', 'try', 'object', 'often', 'clumsy', 'affection', 'Helen', 'Heather', 'Juergensen', 'sexy', 'art', 'gallery', 'manager.This', 'movie', 'hooked', 'outrageous', 'opening', 'scene', 'Jessica', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'bicker', 'gossip', 'men', 'Day', 'Atonement', 'service', 'Jessica', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'sweet', 'film', 'filled', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'superb', 'Westfeldt', 'Juergensen', 'shine', 'lead', 'roles', 'Westfeldt', 'who', 'remarkably', 'like', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'reminiscent', 'young', 'female', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'quirky', 'neurotic', 'role', 'Juergensen', 'irreverent', 'sensuality', 'role', 'two', 'are', 'delicious', 'together', 'whole', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'was', 'particularly', 'moved', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Jessica', 'loving', 'mother.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'tempted', 'pigeonhole', 'Jessica', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'and/or', 'Jewish', 'movie', 'certainly', 'charm', 'universality', 'also', 'transcend', 'categories', 'love', 'family', 'ties', 'friendship', 'self-knowledge', 'other', 'issues', 'are', 'relevant', 'everybody', 'film', 'populated', 'wonderful', 'group', 'characters', 'male', 'female', 'Jewish', 'gentile', 'straight', 'gay', 'bi-curious', 'who', 'are', 'treated', 'affection', 'respect', 'filmmakers', 'advice', 'own', 'preferences', 'prepare', 'kiss', 'Jessica', 'love']",Kissing Jessica Stein

544306,A3UF6OQ3CLCD3S,B00003CYJ4,"R. McNally ""Author, 'CLASS DISMISSED: 75 Outr...","[3, 4]","""Kissing Jessica Stein"" features no major (or even minor) stars, a low budget (about $1 million), and a taboo topic. But the film, which never would have been made without the perseverance of screenwriters and co-stars Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt, is a refreshing mix of quirky indie spirit and classic romantic-comedy sentiment.Westfeldt plays Jessica Stein, a neurotic New York copy editor who's fed up with the dating game. If having her overprotective Jewish mother set her up with undesirable suitors wasn't bad enough, she also has to deal with one bad date after another, not to mention working for her ex-boyfriend (a solid Scott Cohen).The movie gets off to a somewhat rocky star, with the humor coming across as forced and the scenarios boasting a been-there-seen-that feel.Fortunately, when Jessica decides to answer a personal ad in the ""Women Seeking Women"" section, the film takes off. The first date between Jessica and Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), a downtown hipster with bisexual preferences, is beautifully written and acted. Jessica's gradual transition from feeling awkward to being intrigued is completely believable.From then on out, with the exception of a few minor lapses, ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is a fresh and funny romantic comedy that explores the ups and downs of the blossoming relationship between Jessica and Helen. Juergensen and Westfeldt, aided by a solid supporting cast, deliver plenty of laughs. Case in point: a highly amusing scene in which Jessica and Helen prod two unknowing, would-be male suitors into telling them why two women together are so sexy.But ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" isn't all light laughs. With the help of director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, Juergensen and Westfeldt dig into some highly effective dramatic scenes that round out the characters and give the film a little more depth. A nicely shot scene in which the two quarrel about Jessica's unwillingness to tell her family and friends about their lesbian relationship packs a powerful emotional wallop. Ditto a heartfelt exchange between Jessica and her mom late in the film.While director Herman-Wurmfeld does a fine job of making this low-budget pic look like its budget is much larger, he wisely leaves the focus on the actors and the film's excellent script. Westfeldt, who brings to mind an indie Lisa Kudrow, digs beyond sitcom superficiality to find the longing beneath Jessica's perfectionist leanings. The charismatic Juergensen, tough yet vulnerable, is superb as Helen -- keep your eye on this promising actress.It's a kick to see two talented young women sticking it to the male-dominated movie scene and creating a top-notch film through their perseverance and talent.

There are obvious neuroses (what would a romantic comedy be without it?) but the two women, Helen and Jessica, are impressively ""together"" all on their own.Jessica Stein is a brilliant, but bored, copy editor whose boss happens to be an old flame from college.  Just when she has convinced herself that she isn't the problem--blaming everything the non-commital ...men of New York--her brother announces his engagement.  Mortified and a little worried about her own single status, Jessica makes a life-altering decision:  she answers a singles ad placed by another woman....I won't leak any details (because it's too funny to give away) but they're hilarious as they fumble through their relationship, learning as they go.This movie is laden with great actresses, many of whom I've never seen before.  We'll doubtless see more of Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen (hopefully as a team, since they write and act exceptionally well together).  The wonderfully quirky performances of Jackie Hoffman (Joan) and Esther Wurmfeld (Grandma) are hilarious.The most refreshing aspect of this movie is that it doesn't acknowledge the ""femme"" and ""butch"" stereotypes of lesbian relationships.  Also, Westfeldt and Juergensen have written a screenplay that beautifully depicts (FINALLY) a long-neglected truth:  sexuality is not black and white but rather fluid and ever-changing.

Frustrated single girl Jessica Stein decides to try something different (to put it mildly) and answer a lesbian personal ad in the paper; never did she expect to meet Helen.  The two lead actresses are also the writers and producers of the is fine movie, and they are FANTASTIC.

The movie is hilarious, wildly romantic, touching, and poignant, all blended into one bittersweet milkshake.  Jessica and Helen just make the most adorable and gorgeous couple ever.  It's difficult to choose a favourite, since both girls are so beautiful and likeable.  Women and romantic straight men should greatly enjoy this movie.

You'll know what I'm talking about when you go see it.That said, I found the ending greatly unappealing.  I felt like cheated by the ending, like a cop-out.  In the DVD commentary, Juergensen and Westfeldt defend their decision for the nature of the ending, and I can see where they're coming from, but personally I don't agree.  I just feel that the tone and events of the ending are incongruous with evidence from the rest of the movie, and that it should not have occurred.
