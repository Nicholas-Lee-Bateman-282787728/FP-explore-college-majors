Another favorite ""My Kinda Lover"" - off key and lyrics were choppy and some words were not audible.  If there are any fans of ""Lonely Is The Night"" or ""Young Girls"" - now those 2 are done really well. ""I Need You"" is done well.  It's worth the price of the DVD just for Young Girls in my opinion.",3,Hmmm...In the Dark not good in this DVD,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,415,"['favorite', 'song', 'reason', 'why', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Dark', 'really', 'key', 'train', 'wreck', 'sorry', 'Billy', 'favorite', 'Kinda', 'Lover', 'key', 'lyrics', 'were', 'choppy', 'words', 'were', 'not', 'audible', 'are', 'fans', 'Lonely', 'Night', 'Young', 'Girls', 'now', '2', 'are', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'Need', 'done', 'well', 'price', 'DVD', 'just', 'Young', 'Girls', 'opinion']",N/A

I bought this DVD to prep myself for seeing Billy live this past summer, and I was just blown away by the sound.  Not only is the playing superb, but the re-mastering of the tracks completely eliminates the sound problems that seem to plague other live videos from days gone by (AC/DC's &quot;Let There Be Rock,&quot; for example).  This is a crystal clear version of what Billy Squier in the early '80s was.  And it's a great prep for what Billy Squier still sounds like today.  After seeing him this past May, I can attest to the man's ability to sound just as awesome now as he did almost 20 years ago.",5,An '80s Gem,1000771200,"09 18, 2001",2001,643,"['DVD', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'bought', 'DVD', 'prep', 'seeing', 'Billy', 'live', 'past', 'summer', 'was', 'just', 'blown', 'away', 'sound', 'Not', 'only', 'playing', 'superb', 're-mastering', 'tracks', 'completely', 'sound', 'problems', 'seem', 'plague', 'other', 'live', 'videos', 'days', 'gone', 'AC/DC', 'quot', 'Let', 'Be', 'Rock', 'quot', 'example', 'crystal', 'clear', 'version', 'what', 'Billy', 'Squier', 'early', ""'80s"", 'was', 'great', 'prep', 'what', 'Billy', 'Squier', 'still', 'today', 'seeing', 'past', 'May', 'can', 'attest', 'man', 'ability', 'sound', 'just', 'awesome', 'now', 'did', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago']",N/A

It's an incredible performance by Billy and his killer band at the Santa Monica Civic Center in 1981. Let me tell you, whoever mixed this in 5.1 is a genius. It sounds fantastic. The guitars are absolutely scorching (and I do mean scorching) and the drums are pounding. I had no idea his band was so good. There is some awesome knock down drag out guitar work by Billy and his rhythm guitar player refered to only as Mr.&quot;C&quot;. It's pure energy and straight forward hard rock at it's best. Also, the camera work is very good. This is one of the few concert videos that gives you a taste of actually being there in person. The DVD exhibits a nice clean picture and includes a very interesting (and rare) interview track, a photo gallery, and discography. The set list includes all his best of the day: In the dark, Rich kid, My kinda lover, Whadda you want from me, A great Jam followed by Lonely is the night, Young girls, I need you, The stroke, You should be high love, Two daze gone, The big beat, and You know what I like. All in all, a smoking DVD that hard rock fans will surely enjoy. Highly recommended, this is one of the good ones.",5,Pure Energy,988848000,"05 3, 2001",2001,1241,"['thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'exceeded', 'even', 'highest', 'expectations', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Billy', 'killer', 'band', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'Civic', 'Center', '1981', 'Let', 'tell', 'whoever', 'mixed', '5.1', 'genius', 'fantastic', 'guitars', 'are', 'absolutely', 'scorching', 'do', 'mean', 'scorching', 'drums', 'are', 'pounding', 'had', 'idea', 'band', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'awesome', 'knock', 'down', 'drag', 'out', 'guitar', 'work', 'Billy', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'player', 'refered', 'only', 'Mr.', 'quot', 'C', 'quot', 'pure', 'energy', 'straight', 'forward', 'hard', 'rock', 'best', 'Also', 'camera', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'few', 'concert', 'videos', 'taste', 'actually', 'being', 'person', 'DVD', 'nice', 'clean', 'picture', 'very', 'interesting', 'rare', 'interview', 'track', 'photo', 'gallery', 'discography', 'set', 'list', 'best', 'day', 'dark', 'Rich', 'kid', 'My', 'kinda', 'lover', 'Whadda', 'want', 'A', 'great', 'Jam', 'followed', 'Lonely', 'night', 'Young', 'girls', 'need', 'stroke', 'should', 'be', 'high', 'love', 'Two', 'daze', 'gone', 'big', 'beat', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'smoking', 'DVD', 'hard', 'rock', 'fans', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'good', 'ones']",N/A
