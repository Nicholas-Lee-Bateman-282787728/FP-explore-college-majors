220780,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6300216349,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 7]","Franco Zefferelli's biography of St. Francis, `Brother Sun and Sister Moon,' is a bona fide masterpiece.  The cinematography--thanks partly to Ennio Guarnieno--unfolds kaleidoscopically.  The editing and camera angles are sheer perfection.  Watching the beauty unfold in every scene, village and landscape have the glory as if they were from Francis's own eyes.  Created in 1972, Zefferelli draws from an audience during the waning years of the hippie era.  Nevertheless, his implementation of an icon classic is one of the few figures of Catholicism to thrive during that time.  (Unless you want to qualify John XXIII, but he provided less hippie appeal.)  `Brother...' is sensual without being disrespectful and enjoyable without becoming out of context.  The architecture and garments never forget that Francis came from medieval times--even if the pageantry, too, imitates a peacock's myriad of colors.  Included in the story is a rather harsh rendering of ecclesiastical authority.  (G.K. Chesterton, in his biography of Francis, maintains that upon their meeting, Francis was the big man and the pope was the small man, but the small man was needed.  Francis restored a gospel simplicity to a church that was as damaged as the actual one he had to reassemble, but the pope had prudent points to make.)  Francis's father and the local bishop bring enough conflict to provide a plot.  Anyway, theology aside, there isn't much to argue about in this rendering.  Besides Alec Guinness doesn't disappoint as the pope.  Speaking of acting, Graham Faulkner is a dead-ringer in looks and interpretation for the troubadour of God and nature.  And ""Sister Moon,"" Claire (Judy Bowner)--if you will--is radiant, even if she seems misplaced--more like a runner-up to play Juliet.  Every aspect of Francis is represented, and, although, like the rest of us, he led an episodic life, the threads are woven as seamlessly as one of his father's garments.  Francis's life comes off like a glistening mosaic in movie form.  Zefferelli's treatment of Francis walks on water.  Never plodding nor resorting to spiritual fast food, the pace is as flawless as everything else.  How they manage to use Donovan's original soundtrack and a ""Gloria"" that never become tongue-in-cheek or embarrassing is a miracle in itself.  (Donovan was a perfect choice for exhuding the saint's simplicity.)  Florid without being vapid, timely without seeming dated, 'Brother Sun and Sister Moon' is a celebration of Francis's life.  Like his rendering of 'Romeo and Juliet,' `Brother Sun and Sister Moon' deserves to be a Zefferelli classic.",5,Gorgeous Canticle Reflects St. Francis,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2605,"['Franco', 'Zefferelli', 'biography', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'bona', 'fide', 'masterpiece', 'cinematography', 'thanks', 'partly', 'Ennio', 'Guarnieno', 'unfolds', 'kaleidoscopically', 'editing', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'Watching', 'beauty', 'unfold', 'scene', 'village', 'landscape', 'have', 'glory', 'were', 'Francis', 'own', 'eyes', 'Created', '1972', 'Zefferelli', 'audience', 'waning', 'years', 'hippie', 'era', 'Nevertheless', 'implementation', 'icon', 'classic', 'one', 'few', 'figures', 'Catholicism', 'thrive', 'time', 'want', 'qualify', 'John', 'XXIII', 'provided', 'less', 'hippie', 'appeal', 'sensual', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'enjoyable', 'becoming', 'context', 'architecture', 'garments', 'never', 'forget', 'Francis', 'came', 'medieval', 'times', 'even', 'pageantry', 'too', 'peacock', 'myriad', 'colors', 'Included', 'story', 'rather', 'harsh', 'rendering', 'ecclesiastical', 'authority', 'G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'biography', 'Francis', 'meeting', 'Francis', 'was', 'big', 'man', 'pope', 'was', 'small', 'man', 'small', 'man', 'was', 'needed', 'Francis', 'restored', 'gospel', 'simplicity', 'church', 'was', 'as', 'damaged', 'actual', 'one', 'had', 'reassemble', 'pope', 'had', 'prudent', 'points', 'make', 'Francis', 'father', 'local', 'bishop', 'bring', 'enough', 'conflict', 'provide', 'plot', 'Anyway', 'theology', 'aside', ""n't"", 'much', 'argue', 'rendering', 'Alec', 'Guinness', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'pope', 'Speaking', 'acting', 'Graham', 'Faulkner', 'dead-ringer', 'looks', 'interpretation', 'troubadour', 'God', 'nature', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'Claire', 'Judy', 'Bowner', 'will', 'radiant', 'even', 'misplaced', 'more', 'runner-up', 'play', 'Juliet', 'Every', 'aspect', 'Francis', 'represented', 'rest', 'led', 'episodic', 'life', 'threads', 'are', 'woven', 'as', 'seamlessly', 'one', 'father', 'garments', 'Francis', 'life', 'glistening', 'mosaic', 'movie', 'form', 'Zefferelli', 'treatment', 'Francis', 'walks', 'water', 'Never', 'plodding', 'resorting', 'spiritual', 'fast', 'food', 'pace', 'as', 'flawless', 'everything', 'else', 'How', 'manage', 'use', 'Donovan', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'Gloria', 'never', 'become', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'embarrassing', 'miracle', 'Donovan', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'exhuding', 'saint', 'simplicity', 'Florid', 'being', 'vapid', 'timely', 'seeming', 'dated', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'celebration', 'Francis', 'life', 'rendering', ""'Romeo"", 'Juliet', 'Brother', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'deserves', 'be', 'Zefferelli', 'classic']",N/A

220785,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6300216349,Brian E. Erland,"[40, 41]","I first saw this movie in 1976 and immediately fell in love with it. Now some twenty-nine years later I can honestly say it hasn't lost much of its initial impact on me. While I won't go so far as to say that it played a part in my conversion to Catholicism, I will say that it provided me with a 'divine ideal' of what being Catholic should be about.While it's true that the sixties hippie movement was a little too influential in Franco Zeffirelli's re-imagining of the young, nature loving saint, it doesn't take too much effort to simply acknowledge those cultural elements and move past them. Of course the Donovan music in the soundtrack may make it a little difficult for some.Another often heard complaint concerns a number of historical inaccuracies within the script. I'd like to point out that the main function of a movie is to entertain. I don't know of any movie based on a real person or true event that is completely accurate. When you watch a movie a certain amount of artistic freedom with the storyline should be a given.What we do have in 'Brother Sun, Sister Moon' is a film of overpowering innocence and spiritual purity. It's a story of one man's vision of the ""Life of Christ"" and his commitment to living that vision to its fullest. Coupled with some of the most amazing scenic footage of the Italian countryside you'll ever see Zefirelli has given us not only a moving spiritual document but a visual feast not soon to be forgotten.Praise should also be given to a young cast, most of whom I've never seen in anything else.

220787,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6300216349,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","I missed seeing Brother Sun and Sister Moon back in 1973 when I was in college. I really wanted to go because I was greatly impressed by Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet and also I had read Nikos Kazantzakis' novel ""Brother Sun and Siser Moon"" which must have been a background resource for this film. Now, after 36 years I finally have seen the film. I found I had very mixed opinions about the film and thus had to give it a 3 out of 5 stars.The film is very beautiful in its art direction and cinematography. The Tuscan landscapes are beautiful.  Tuscany is one of the most beautiful regions of the world and the film captures the villages, the architecture, the farms and fields, and the strong and beautiful Italian people.  In fact, Zeffirelli does a superb job of showing the aged and ill in contrast and in communtion with the young and beautiful. The actors are physically beautiful, even Francis' French mother is stunning. The men are portrayed as robust, energetic and full of enterprise. His father and the bishop perfectly portray this role of the robust, world-wise, enterprising player in the world. Graham Faulkner and Judi Bowker are young and attractive and portray St Francis and St Clare. Faulkner takes off his clothes and gives them back to his parents in the middle of the village and the nudity is in keeping with the message of the film and the concept that mankind and the entire earth is a part of God's beautiful creation. Leigh Lawson plays Francis' loyal friend Bernardo, a war hero who becomes a follower of Francis.  Alec Guinness plays Pope Innocent III perfectly, for he plays the part so that we are not sure if he is really spiritually moved by the hermitic band with Francis or whether he recognized a rebellious off-shoot that required pulling back into the big tent, or both. This was the most subtle performance in the film.The film is divided into 3 sections; the young Francis returns from war in a state of exhaustion and illness. He recovers but in his recovery reveals that he may be insane as he walks on roof tops trying to catch birds or crys out in church from visions he sees in the crucifix. His spiritual awakening puts him in conflict with his father and he eventually is disowned. The second part of the film focuses on the gradual building of his ministry, one disciple at a time, as he gradually rebuilds a ruined church in the countryside. The final part is the crisis when his church is burned and he goes to visit Pope Innocent III to find out what he must have done wrong. This is a very interesting part of the film for we see two forces merge. We see the poor hermit religious expressionists come into contact with the established machinery of organized religion. This could have been very messy. Francis sees how the machinery of religion had hidden the spiritual light and dares to quote the Gospels to the Pope and cardinals. But Pope Innocent III reacts openly to the visit and exhibits extreme humility as he kisses the dirty feet of Francis.Thus Francis leaves with the understanding that his imitation of the life of Christ is acceptable under the Roman Catholic umbrella and the Pope avoids a popular grassroots religious revival becoming a competitive and divisive force within the church.But why did the film miss the mark? Why does it not come up to expectations?  Primarily this is due to the interpretation of Francis as an air-headed space cadet who is intoxicated with God's presence.  We don't really grasp the high intelligence, moral strength, and spiritual courage of the Saint. Francis was not only a spiritual follower of Christ, he also casts away all his earthly supports and material possessions and lives the life that Christ lived, walking from village to village preaching and teaching to those that are most cast aside by society. To some degree the film equates this spiritual state with a 1960's influenced view that equates flower-power with the hard reality of spiritual suffering and sacrifice. There are odd scenes where Francis talks to a stone in Bernardo's home, or his follower bathe outcasts with leprosy in a very odd and silly scene. The scenes between St. Clare and St. Francis border on romance.  Katantzakis keeps the concept of spiritual suffering alive in his novel, for there are real earthly sacrifices that must be made to live the life of Christ. A film with a more intelligent and less air-headed St. Francis should be madeand unfortunately this film, for all its good intentions, misses the final mark.",3,I had hoped it was going to be a better film,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,4521,"['missed', 'seeing', 'Brother', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'back', '1973', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'really', 'wanted', 'go', 'was', 'greatly', 'impressed', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'also', 'had', 'read', 'Nikos', 'Kazantzakis', 'novel', 'Brother', 'Sun', 'Siser', 'Moon', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'background', 'resource', 'film', 'Now', '36', 'years', 'finally', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'found', 'had', 'very', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'film', 'thus', 'had', 'give', '3', '5', 'stars.The', 'film', 'very', 'beautiful', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'Tuscan', 'landscapes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Tuscany', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'regions', 'world', 'film', 'villages', 'architecture', 'farms', 'fields', 'strong', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'people', 'fact', 'Zeffirelli', 'superb', 'job', 'showing', 'aged', 'ill', 'contrast', 'communtion', 'young', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'are', 'physically', 'beautiful', 'even', 'Francis', 'French', 'mother', 'stunning', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'robust', 'energetic', 'full', 'enterprise', 'father', 'bishop', 'perfectly', 'role', 'robust', 'world-wise', 'enterprising', 'player', 'world', 'Graham', 'Faulkner', 'Judi', 'Bowker', 'are', 'young', 'attractive', 'portray', 'St', 'Francis', 'St', 'Clare', 'Faulkner', 'clothes', 'back', 'parents', 'middle', 'village', 'nudity', 'keeping', 'message', 'film', 'concept', 'mankind', 'entire', 'earth', 'part', 'God', 'beautiful', 'creation', 'Leigh', 'Lawson', 'Francis', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Bernardo', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'follower', 'Francis', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Pope', 'Innocent', 'III', 'perfectly', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'spiritually', 'moved', 'hermitic', 'band', 'Francis', 'recognized', 'rebellious', 'off-shoot', 'required', 'pulling', 'back', 'big', 'tent', 'was', 'most', 'subtle', 'performance', 'film.The', 'film', 'divided', '3', 'sections', 'young', 'Francis', 'returns', 'war', 'state', 'exhaustion', 'illness', 'recovery', 'reveals', 'may', 'be', 'insane', 'roof', 'tops', 'trying', 'catch', 'birds', 'crys', 'out', 'church', 'visions', 'crucifix', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'conflict', 'father', 'eventually', 'disowned', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'gradual', 'building', 'ministry', 'one', 'disciple', 'time', 'gradually', 'ruined', 'church', 'countryside', 'final', 'part', 'crisis', 'when', 'church', 'burned', 'visit', 'Pope', 'Innocent', 'III', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'wrong', 'very', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'see', 'two', 'forces', 'merge', 'see', 'poor', 'hermit', 'religious', 'come', 'contact', 'established', 'machinery', 'organized', 'religion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'messy', 'Francis', 'how', 'machinery', 'religion', 'had', 'hidden', 'spiritual', 'light', 'quote', 'Gospels', 'Pope', 'cardinals', 'Pope', 'Innocent', 'III', 'openly', 'visit', 'exhibits', 'extreme', 'humility', 'dirty', 'feet', 'Francis.Thus', 'Francis', 'understanding', 'imitation', 'life', 'Christ', 'acceptable', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'umbrella', 'Pope', 'popular', 'grassroots', 'religious', 'revival', 'becoming', 'competitive', 'divisive', 'force', 'church.But', 'why', 'did', 'film', 'miss', 'mark', 'Why', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'expectations', 'Primarily', 'due', 'interpretation', 'Francis', 'air-headed', 'space', 'cadet', 'who', 'intoxicated', 'God', 'presence', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'grasp', 'high', 'intelligence', 'moral', 'strength', 'spiritual', 'courage', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'spiritual', 'follower', 'Christ', 'also', 'away', 'earthly', 'supports', 'material', 'possessions', 'life', 'Christ', 'lived', 'walking', 'village', 'village', 'preaching', 'teaching', 'are', 'most', 'cast', 'aside', 'society', 'degree', 'film', 'spiritual', 'state', '1960', 'influenced', 'view', 'flower-power', 'hard', 'reality', 'spiritual', 'suffering', 'sacrifice', 'are', 'odd', 'scenes', 'where', 'Francis', 'stone', 'Bernardo', 'home', 'follower', 'bathe', 'outcasts', 'leprosy', 'very', 'odd', 'silly', 'scene', 'scenes', 'St.', 'Clare', 'St.', 'Francis', 'border', 'romance', 'Katantzakis', 'concept', 'spiritual', 'suffering', 'alive', 'novel', 'are', 'real', 'earthly', 'sacrifices', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'live', 'life', 'Christ', 'A', 'film', 'more', 'intelligent', 'less', 'air-headed', 'St.', 'Francis', 'should', 'be', 'madeand', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'good', 'intentions', 'final', 'mark']",N/A
220788,A2YD21XOPJ966C,6300216349,C. Freeman,"[4, 5]","I first saw this movie almost 15 years ago and fell immediately under it's fascinating spell. I've always been an admirer of Zeffirelli's work, especially his ever popular Jesus Of Nazareth, which IMO remains the best version of Jesus' life ever put on film. I've also had an interest in the life of Francis Of Assisi, and to my knowledge there ARE no other versions of St. Francis' life in a movie format, so this one may be the only one available, and what a version it is. What it lacks in historical accuracy, as the Amazon reviewer (Tom Keogh) suggests, it MORE than makes up for in wonderful visuals, a terrific score, and of course Graham Faulkner as the young St. Francis.In spite of what Keogh says about Faulkner's acting, he does a splendid job playing the impoverished saint who turns his back on a life of wealth to pursue his God amongst nature and a life of simplicity. The scene near the end where St. Francis is summoned to Rome to see the Pope - amidst the splendour and pomp of the Vatican - is perhaps one of the most memorable in the movie.It bears repeating that since this movie was made in the '70's, when the Hippie movement and Flower Children were still going strong, it isn't too surprising that the signs of those times invariably found it's way into the movie, which portrays St. Francis' followers and their settlement as a type of Hippie commune. I'm no historian but would venture a guess that in reality there probably was little similarity between the movie and the actuality of how St. Francis and his followers lived, at least in this regards.In closing, take Keogh's review with a grain of salt. It's not a perfect movie to be sure, but in spite of it's shortcomings is still a terrific movie, and IMO, an early Zeffirelli classic.",5,An Early Zeffirelli Classic,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,1769,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'almost', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'fell', 'immediately', 'fascinating', 'spell', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'admirer', 'Zeffirelli', 'work', 'especially', 'ever', 'popular', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'IMO', 'best', 'version', 'Jesus', 'life', 'ever', 'put', 'film', ""'ve"", 'also', 'had', 'interest', 'life', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'knowledge', 'ARE', 'other', 'versions', 'St.', 'Francis', 'life', 'movie', 'format', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'available', 'what', 'version', 'What', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'Tom', 'Keogh', 'MORE', 'up', 'wonderful', 'visuals', 'terrific', 'score', 'course', 'Graham', 'Faulkner', 'young', 'St.', 'Francis.In', 'spite', 'what', 'Keogh', 'Faulkner', 'acting', 'splendid', 'job', 'playing', 'impoverished', 'saint', 'who', 'back', 'life', 'wealth', 'pursue', 'God', 'amongst', 'nature', 'life', 'simplicity', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'St.', 'Francis', 'summoned', 'Rome', 'see', 'Pope', 'splendour', 'pomp', 'Vatican', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'movie.It', 'repeating', 'movie', 'was', 'made', ""'70"", 'when', 'Hippie', 'movement', 'Flower', 'Children', 'were', 'still', 'going', 'strong', ""n't"", 'too', 'surprising', 'signs', 'times', 'invariably', 'found', 'way', 'movie', 'St.', 'Francis', 'followers', 'settlement', 'type', 'Hippie', 'commune', ""'m"", 'historian', 'would', 'venture', 'guess', 'reality', 'probably', 'was', 'little', 'similarity', 'movie', 'actuality', 'how', 'St.', 'Francis', 'followers', 'lived', 'least', 'regards.In', 'closing', 'take', 'Keogh', 'review', 'grain', 'salt', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'still', 'terrific', 'movie', 'IMO', 'early', 'Zeffirelli', 'classic']",N/A

No, it is definitely not historically accurate. What it IS, is a very calming film which tries to tell the story of a very young man who gave up all of the riches from his family so he could live out his Calling from God. There is no question that the entire film was influenced by the late 1960s ""hippy"" or ""Flower Child"" movement going on. (Make love, not war). But it depicts a man being extremely counter cultural which is exactly how the late Pope John Paul II asked us all to live. Not that all of us are asked to live in real poverty, but that we listen to where God calls us to be in life. St Francis is a bit unrealistic in some ways, it shows him singing and only interested in the butterflies and flowers in his young days. It may not translate well to today's audiences but for me being in my 50s, I enjoy the music and the beautiful cinematography. I also see it as a calming, soothing film. If you want to know the more historical life of St Francis, I suggest you check out your local Catholic bookshop and find some good printed material. I also would suggest a film called ""Francis and Clare"" which is more accurate of the lives of Francis and Clare. It's not perfect but definitely based on more factual accounts. But with that film being about 3 hours long, I find it harder to sit through. It's not exactly an action packed, suspenseful movie. Anyway, I enjoy this film for what it is and I'm a little disappointed in the review that Amazon wrote for it. If you can watch it with a mindset of late 60s and early 70s, then it might help you with the storyline. It's similar to how ""Godspell"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" were influenced by the world situation at the time.

Pawl ""Dani""","[6, 6]","BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON is a beautiful film, directed by Franco Zefferelli, that chronicles the life of St. Francis of Assisi (Graham Faulkner), following his time in the war and his eye-opening conversion, to serve God and cast away ties to the material world.  St. Francis (or Francesco, as he is known to his affluent family and friends) also has a chance encounter with Clare (St. Clare), beautifully played by Judi Bowker.  Francis is labelled as mad by his family, as well as many of the townspeople, and stuns everyone when he would rather spend time smelling flowers, admiring the beautiful simplicity of the life of birds and butterflies and reflecting on his true calling, in God's eyes.At first, this film was a little difficult for me to connect with.  At times, the pacing and direction felt more like a rock music video than a movie (it definitely has a 1970s feel to it).  Also, the music of Donovan, featured in the film, at first felt quite out of place.  Eventually the melodious and understated quality to his songs definitely grew on me.  The cast was so beautiful here and it is really surprising that this was the only film that Graham Faulkner was known for.  His portrayal of Francis was glowing, sensitive and genuine.

220804,A13TO5TU4A68LD,6300216349,Gryphonisle,"[0, 0]","I've wanted to see this film since it came out.  I still remember the ads for it, in the Oregonian.  I could have waited another forty years, without undue suffering.  This is a vintage '70s film, and evokes a lot of what I remember about the period, including the witlessness of some of the back-to-earth types.  In an early scene, the young and eventual Saint, Francis, sees a bird on a balcony, but when it won't hop into his hand, he climbs down onto the roof and chases it along the roof line, where he finally catches it.  It's a wild animal, it was doing perfectly well without his intervention, and is safer not trusting humans, but of course, animals can't talk and won't criticize, and poor Francis, home from the war between Perugia and Assisi (but oddly enough, living in a San Gmignano tower dwelling, not Assisi), is having issues.His father thinks he needs a woman, as he would.  I think he was looking for a man (the movie character, not St. Francis).In any case, Zefferelli apparently wanted to draw parallels between the life of St. Francis and the hippie movement, so he does.  Except that the hippies were pretty much about pot, sex, and rock and roll, even if they preferred people to think they were up to something more noble.  Yes, they did hate the establishment, much like St. Francis, but their poverty was not so much a vow as a necessity---when cities like San Francisco were willing to lavish welfare funds and food stamps, it only went so far, and the beer---and the pot---still cost money.  But, there's lots of terrible music with even more insipid lyrics, and sung in those drippy boy voices so popular among some segments back when.Yeesh!I mean, St. Francis wrote canticles that are still light on the ear, could not they have been used instead? Of course they had a lot of Jesus talk in them, not exactly what the '70s were about...As freakish as St. Francis is portrayed, it's not without precedent.  Donatello's famous statues of Mary Magdalene and Habbakuk render both as demented looking street people, burning with an inner light that has rendered them off kilter to reality.  So perhaps Zefferelli's portrayal isn't that far off.I had a hard time sitting through this badly dated film though;  there is far more cliche than drama, as when they receive bread from other threshers, taking it with dirty, desperate hands and then suddenly, with delicate, outstretched fingers, handling it like they're cardinals during Communion at the Vatican.  Still, the scene with the Pope is impressive.  It reminds me of the scene in &#34;Elizabeth&#34; where she appears in vestigal white, shorn of her ginger hair, and announces she is &#34;Married to England&#34;.  The whole scene with the Pope is impressive, not the least the way the Pope is bundled back into his robes, by his handlers, after kissing Francis' feet, as if to hustle him back to the safe and secure senility of the Order.The costumery should also be noted.  This was the beginning of the first Industrial Age, when eastern Italy was seeing great wealth from the trade in textiles (which, like the more famous 19th Century version, drew rural people to the cities, and to great poverty, thus giving St. Francis the audience and the parishes for his church building) so the clothes, while often ridiculous to look at today, are of gorgeous construction, with fabrics that catch the eye with their textures and finish.Still, for those who sensibly question the dogma and fairy tales of Relgion; who don't have a particular weakness for the hippie era; this is going to be a hard film to watch.

I make no pretense at being any type of theological scholar.The movie itself never pretended to be a strictly biographical study of Francis.  It was intended to communicate the love and spirit of charity that he practiced.  It was not meant to be a reference for theologians.

It's towards the end, but Francis makes a pilgrimage to see the pope in order to get permission to establish a church of his own. He and his crew are, by all appearances, a disheveled bunch, and everyone in the papal agency are beautifully ordained with all kinds of rich and luxurious robes and jewlrey and Francis appears before the pope in a tattered robe almost embarrassed by his appearance and yet the pope is moved by him and says to the effect, ""We have all been so stirred up by 'original sin' that we most of us have forgotten about original innocence. Go my, son, and build your church...""That line made me lose it because we do, we all do, we focus on sin, on guilt, on punishment and forget that in each and every moment God is giving us nothing but Love, Grace, and Peace.

220822,AFOK05KDCHSHL,6300216349,Libretio,"[12, 12]","BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON(UK/Italy - 1972)Aspect ratio: 1.75:1Theatrical soundtrack: MonoThe early life of St. Francis of Assisi (Graham Faulkner), the son of a wealthy merchant who underwent a spiritual conversion following his experiences in the crusades and later renounced his worldly goods before establishing a holy order separate from traditional Church teachings.Conceived and executed in much the same visual manner as his ultra-popular ROMEO AND JULIET (1968), Franco Zeffirelli's BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON attempts to draw parallels between the work and philosophy of St. Francis and the ideology which underpinned the worldwide hippy movement throughout the 1960's and early 70's. Hence the ragged-but-lyrical cinematography (by Ennio Guarnieri), fractured editing (by Reginald Mills), and the use of contemporary - but strangely timeless - folk songs written and performed by Donovan, all of which conjures the requisite mood of spiritual awakening whilst simultaneously dating the movie quite firmly within its period. Cynics will hate it, while others will embrace Zeffirelli's defiant romanticism. Daringly, Zeffirelli's script (co-written by Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Lina Wertmuller) contrasts Francis' piety and virtue with the bloated pomp of official Church doctrine, weighed down by internal politics and social indifference, though it's difficult to gauge if this represents a veiled attack on Christian orthodoxy or is simply a reflection of Francis' dismissal of outdated customs in favor of a return to Nature.Lovingly crafted by Lorenzo Mongiardino (art direction) and Danilo Donati (costumes), the movie is toplined by a cast of gifted newcomers and screen veterans, including Judi Bowker (one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation), Leigh Lawson, Kenneth Cranham, Valentina Cortese and Alec Guinness. But the film derives much of its visual strength from Faulkner as the young, battle-scarred nobleman laid low by his wartime experiences, who emerges from the horrors of conflict with a completely new and spiritual outlook on life. Faulkner was one of a handful of young actors (including FELLINI-SATYRICON's Hiram Keller and LISA AND THE DEVIL's Alessio Orano) who emerged from European cinema in the 1970's, handsome and talented in equal measure, to burn brightly and briefly before disappearing into relative obscurity. Here, Faulkner's intense beauty and fresh-faced innocence are illuminated by Guarnieri's worshipful camera and Zeffirelli's attentive direction, which places him center-stage throughout (there's even a generous, PG-level nude scene halfway through the movie). This was Faulkner's cinematic debut, and while Zeffirelli couldn't have made a better choice for such a crucial role, the director later described him as being slightly aloof from his fellow actors, which may explain his subsequent disappearance from the movie scene. But here, his grace and dignity are displayed in abundance, and it's hard not to fall in love with him, every time he appears on-screen.The Italian version, FRATELLO SOLE SORELLA LUNA, runs approximately 14 minutes longer and replaces Donovan's music with a fully orchestral score by Riz Ortolani. The film's editor, Reginald Mills, produced a 16mm documentary in 1973 entitled FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI: A FLORENTINE ARTIST, compiled from footage shot during the making of the movie and featuring a lengthy interview with the director himself. Running a mere 51 minutes, it provided an invaluable insight into Zeffirelli's working methods and the thinking which gave rise to the finished product, and its absence from Paramount's DVD is hugely disappointing.",4,Vivid religious parable for 'youth' audience,1080086400,"03 24, 2004",2004,3639,"['BROTHER', 'SUN', 'SISTER', 'MOON', 'UK/Italy', '1972', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.75:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'MonoThe', 'early', 'life', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'Graham', 'Faulkner', 'son', 'wealthy', 'merchant', 'who', 'underwent', 'spiritual', 'conversion', 'following', 'experiences', 'crusades', 'later', 'renounced', 'worldly', 'goods', 'establishing', 'holy', 'order', 'separate', 'traditional', 'Church', 'teachings.Conceived', 'executed', 'much', 'same', 'visual', 'manner', 'ultra-popular', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', '1968', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'BROTHER', 'SUN', 'SISTER', 'MOON', 'attempts', 'draw', 'parallels', 'work', 'philosophy', 'St.', 'Francis', 'ideology', 'underpinned', 'worldwide', 'hippy', 'movement', '1960', 'early', '70', 'Hence', 'ragged-but-lyrical', 'cinematography', 'Ennio', 'Guarnieri', 'fractured', 'editing', 'Reginald', 'Mills', 'use', 'contemporary', 'strangely', 'timeless', 'folk', 'songs', 'written', 'performed', 'Donovan', 'requisite', 'mood', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'whilst', 'simultaneously', 'dating', 'movie', 'quite', 'firmly', 'period', 'Cynics', 'will', 'hate', 'others', 'will', 'embrace', 'Zeffirelli', 'defiant', 'romanticism', 'Daringly', 'Zeffirelli', 'script', 'co-written', 'Suso', 'Cecchi', ""d'Amico"", 'Lina', 'Wertmuller', 'Francis', 'piety', 'virtue', 'bloated', 'pomp', 'official', 'Church', 'doctrine', 'weighed', 'down', 'internal', 'politics', 'social', 'indifference', 'difficult', 'gauge', 'veiled', 'attack', 'Christian', 'orthodoxy', 'simply', 'reflection', 'Francis', 'dismissal', 'outdated', 'customs', 'favor', 'return', 'Nature.Lovingly', 'crafted', 'Lorenzo', 'Mongiardino', 'art', 'direction', 'Danilo', 'Donati', 'costumes', 'movie', 'toplined', 'cast', 'gifted', 'newcomers', 'screen', 'veterans', 'including', 'Judi', 'Bowker', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'generation', 'Leigh', 'Lawson', 'Kenneth', 'Cranham', 'Valentina', 'Cortese', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'film', 'much', 'visual', 'strength', 'Faulkner', 'young', 'battle-scarred', 'nobleman', 'laid', 'low', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'who', 'horrors', 'conflict', 'completely', 'new', 'spiritual', 'outlook', 'life', 'Faulkner', 'was', 'one', 'handful', 'young', 'actors', 'including', 'FELLINI-SATYRICON', 'Hiram', 'Keller', 'LISA', 'AND', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'Alessio', 'Orano', 'who', 'emerged', 'European', 'cinema', '1970', 'handsome', 'talented', 'equal', 'measure', 'burn', 'brightly', 'briefly', 'disappearing', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'Here', 'Faulkner', 'intense', 'beauty', 'fresh-faced', 'innocence', 'are', 'illuminated', 'Guarnieri', 'worshipful', 'camera', 'Zeffirelli', 'attentive', 'direction', 'center-stage', 'even', 'generous', 'PG-level', 'nude', 'scene', 'halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'Faulkner', 'cinematic', 'debut', 'Zeffirelli', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'better', 'choice', 'crucial', 'role', 'director', 'later', 'described', 'being', 'slightly', 'aloof', 'fellow', 'actors', 'may', 'explain', 'subsequent', 'disappearance', 'movie', 'scene', 'here', 'grace', 'dignity', 'are', 'displayed', 'abundance', 'hard', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'time', 'on-screen.The', 'Italian', 'version', 'FRATELLO', 'SOLE', 'SORELLA', 'LUNA', 'approximately', '14', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Donovan', 'music', 'fully', 'orchestral', 'score', 'Riz', 'Ortolani', 'film', 'editor', 'Reginald', 'Mills', 'produced', '16mm', 'documentary', '1973', 'entitled', 'FRANCO', 'ZEFFIRELLI', 'FLORENTINE', 'ARTIST', 'compiled', 'footage', 'shot', 'making', 'movie', 'featuring', 'lengthy', 'interview', 'director', 'Running', 'mere', '51', 'minutes', 'provided', 'invaluable', 'insight', 'Zeffirelli', 'working', 'methods', 'thinking', 'gave', 'rise', 'finished', 'product', 'absence', 'Paramount', 'DVD', 'hugely', 'disappointing']",N/A

The performance by Graham Faulkner is one example as it is a lucid, careful effort with a truly unique Franciscan understanding of simplicity and compassion. A really unguarded ""childlike"" innocence.  I really hate to sound uncharitable to our friend Tom but for goodness sake!  . I remember when I saw this film at a theatre in the spring of 1973 I was with a group of friends who scoffed and joked at the naivite of it. Outside a young man approached us and said that he had recently talked with Franco Zefferelli and that he had made this movie "" from his heart"". This young man was brimming with quiet good will and charity and this really struck me(and at that time I easily ridiculed all such non-sense as I then saw it). I too had really been moved by the film and this young person moved me too. My friends howled and scoffed at him(we were very young, all knowing, very clever Theatre students consumed by externals) but I refused to join in and told my friends that they were mistaken and misguided in their behavior and most of them scoffed at me too. Later one of them told me that she too knew where I was coming from  and this too moved me. I mark this moment as when I really began to take a deeper interest in things spiritual and have continued to love St Francis and have read much about him and try to emmulate( as best I can ) his example hard though it is!

Over the years I have watched it countless of times and it keeps getting better after each screening. I first saw it in a theatre in Toronto when it came out in 1973 and quite a few people were leaving early. I guess they weren't prepared for such an avant-garde movie.I cannot possibly fault this picture. To me it is beyond criticism. The spirituality of Francesco transpires with such power that it is sometimes overwhelming. The scenario is utterly brilliant. Each scene is extremely atmospheric and the pictures are sometimes stunningly beautiful. Human emotions are displayed bare for the viewers. Zeffirelli uses caricatural effects to convey his message, but he does it with extreme class. All the actors are very very good. Obviously the director did a great job of guiding each and every one to display maximum authenticity. This Francesco is an imaginary figure, but one that is totally credible.At the beginning we see Francesco undergoing a profound transformation, one that is displayed as if it was identical to the Christ's transfiguration. This is quite subtle though. You may not grasp it's significance the first time you see it. But  other strong parts are less equivocal. Like when Francesco is forced to go to church where he sees the abject poverty in which people live. He revolts against this misery, for he wants everybody to be happy. And he will himself find happiness by first getting rid of his identity as the son of a rich merchant. This will give us the most powerful scene of this entire motion picture. After being dragged by his father to appear in front of the bishop, he takes all his clothes off and give them back to his father and tell him that he is no longer his father. After that, completely naked, he proceeds to walk out of town where he will start his mystical life.The apotheoses comes at the end when Francesco, after going through a period of serious doubts, requests an audience with the Pope. Alex Guinness is magnificent in his role as Innocent III. Francesco will leave Rome with a new set of wings.

At least in the title. Anyhow...Brother Sun, Sister Moon is, in my opinion, one of the greatest love stories of all time. And no, I'm not just talking about Francis and Clare (though their shared love certainly resonates). This is actually three love stories:-As mentioned, there is Clare and Francis's story.-There is the story of Francis's love for God and His Church.But the great over-arching story is that of God's love for humanity as told through the eyes of Francis and the words of Jesus that Francis quotes. ""Consider the birds of the air..."" God's care for humanity, His hope for their true, life-giving freedom, is, in the eyes of Francis, complete.This movie is beautifully done. While Donovan's soundtrack shows its age, it is more of a plus to my mind than a minus.

I do understand why this movie is popular as it touches a lot of primal emotions.  However, I do also realize that if we want to get to know the saint, we must be aware of the pertinent facts of his life.  Interpretation is understandable but not when the facts are twisted into downright  unrecognizability.  The major events are there up to the audience with Pope Innocent III, but the way they are presented are all misleading. Hence, while I must also apologize to those who sincerely love this movie, I encourage you to judge my review only after you have seen the other movies about Saint Francis or at least, read a historically accurate account of his life (I suggest the catholic encyclopedia online) and compare it to Brother Sun, Sister Moon - that way you can understand my rating of this movie more.My review will contain some spoilers so please skip the next paragraph if you don't want to read them:SPOILERS START HEREWhile it is true that Saint Francis got into trouble with his father with regards to property, Francis did NOT just take the bolts of cloth and throw them away.  In reality he took them, sold them and tried to donate the money to the priest in charge of San Damiano.  Another thing is that the local bishop definitely did NOT authorize any action against the Franciscans, rather he in fact arranged for them to meet the Pope and was their ardent supporter.  And the way Francis reacted during his audience with Pope Innocent III? Boulderdash.  He didn't go to ask the Pope ""what we've done wrong"", he went to ask permission to establish a new religious order.  Big, big difference there.Worst of all, Francis' love of SCRIPTURE was nowhere evident in this movie.  Shame.SPOILERS END HEREI've seen four major St. Francis of Assisi movies.

The 60's created a spiritual awakening in the hippy movement, and it continued through the early 70's. The early 70's was a time of rebirth and innocence. It was truly a wonderful gift that Franco Zeffirelli chose Donovan to write the music for the film, because the story is all about the realizations a young man has about the world around him. It's a film for the young at heart in many ways, and the soundtrack helps clarify the direction of the film as a celebration of youth and discovery of life.

But the finished product was something else. Filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli (Endless Love) makes a decorous effort at communicating the ideals of Francis and even tweaking the character toward flower-power relevance. But the result is feel-good fluff, a boring movie that doesn't penetrate its subject as much as reinvent him toward a modern bias. Graham Faulkner is entirely forgettable in the lead, and Donovan's songs on this project aren't exactly first-rate, either. --Tom Keogh""HOWEVER - even though this is not the best interpretation of St. Francis, and the music is, indeed, too hippie and forgettable, one has to understand that this movie is created in the same period and with the same thoughts as Romeo and Juliet.It is still a powerful film - maybe I am biased by the fact that Francis is my favorite saint and I will never get tired of him - even though this view is somewhat superficial compared with others.The sequence with the pope is incredibly powerful.

His critique was like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa! Seriously, Filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli, (Romeo and Juliet, and Jesus of Nazareth) is one of the greatest artistic masters of film I have ever seen. And you couldn't find a more perfect virtuous couple of actors than Graham Faulkner and Judi Bowker to play the roles of Saint Francis and Claire. Since childhood, Saint Francis has always been my favorite saint. Pope Gregory IX, commissioned Franciscan Friar, Thomas of Celano, to write an accurate biography of Francis. This is the principle source on Francis life. I was happy to see that the movie closely followed the historic account. A few items not covered in the film are that Francis was active in the gifts of the Holy Spirit. He prayed for many that had incurable illnesses, and they were instantly healed. He had the Stigmata, which were the wounds of Jesus. His hands, feet and side bled. Once, when he was praying, there was a glow about him that was so bright, that several people rushed out with water pails because they thought there was a fire. Another occasion, he was seen giving a sermon under a tree. There were no other people present, but the tree was filled with birds, that were listening and then answering him. Francis and Claire were deeply in love. Once, he came to visit her and she was not at home. He prayed and the rose bush next to her door became completely covered with new blossoms to let her know that he came by to see her. There were also a few sad notes. Francis took a literal view of denying the flesh for the sake of the Spirit. He would beat his legs with a rock and command his body to be submitted. He slept on a stone floor with a stone for a pillow. There were hundreds of others who had become Franciscan Friars, but they could not live his type of life of suffering. He strongly protested and they took away his leadership. And he died in his mid 40s because of his renouncing the flesh. I deeply admire Francis humility, his self-sacrifice to serve others, and his adherence to the Words of Jesus Sermon on the Mount, more than almost anyone else in history.

While I liked the film, its' failure to develop any of the characters taught me little about St. Francis, St. Clare or anyone else in the movie.  I got to know St. Francis the symbol, not St. Francis the man.In the movie St. Francis seems like a nice enough fellow.  He grew up wealthy and spoiled but his experiences during one of the crusades, his near death experience and his realization that the poor suffer while the rich are fed change him.  He changes from a rich brat to a saint who renounces his, and his fathers, worldly possessions and ministers to the poor.  Along the way he converts many of his friends and even St. Clare.  He even seeks the Pope's advice and approval when local church leaders turn against him.The Pope sees the holiness in St. Francis.  I was pleased with the Pope's response and found myself wishing the best for St. Francis.  He really was a nice holy man.The problem is I never got to know St. Francis or anyone in the movie.  All the characters seem like symbols.  For instance, the father of St. Francis is a rich man who worships money.  There is a rich playboy who once he really saw the poor joined Francis.  There is the war hero who was troubled by what he saw in the war and finds peace with Francis.  There is even a skeptical friend who works for the church but finally sees the holiness in the message preached by St. Francis.  Yet, I don't know why they changed or who they were before their conversions.I wish the movie spent more time developing a few of the characters, especially St. Francis, so their conversions actually meant something.

Saint Francis of Assisi 's life forms the basis of the movie, and to my mind, Zeffirelli has captured the essence of his ultimate religious insight decisively and with great beauty.  To my mind the most powerful moments in the film are in the end, where the poverty of Saint Francis and the extravagant luxury of the Roman church are placed in stark contrast.  It is interesting that the practice of religion can, and has, led to both extremes.First, let me laud the actors.  Graham Faulkner is superb in this most demanding role.  One deeply senses the searching and dedication that led Saint Francis to his ultimate life of poverty and freedom. Clare is played with pristine innocence and beauty by Judi Bowker.  Other major characters are exceptionally well cast and depict their parts extremely well: the crude, covetous and overpowering father, the sensitive, loving but powerless mother, the various egotistical and highly-adorned religious leaders, the care-free band of youthful friends who later were captivated by the sincerity of St. Francis, the helpless and hopeless laborers who were given new hope -- all these actors rang true, thanks to Zeffirelli's knowledgeable and deft direction.I am neither a Catholic nor a fundamentalist, but as St. Francis did, I do take the words of Jesus of Nazareth seriously and often ponder which of them are within my capacity to emulate.  I could stand neither the poverty nor the humility demanded of a saint, but somehow am gratified that there are people who can rise to their highest levels.  Aristotle has said that the true nature of anything is the highest it can become.  St. Francis gives the human race an example of a man who sought and found his true nature, and thereby gives hope for the future of humanity.I sincerely thank Zeffirelli for his vision, conception and direction of this masterpiece of a film.  It is wonderful to be able to share his eye for beauty, both of humans and their trappings, and of the glory of the earth.

While his suffering from the wounds ofChrist, and the illness that eventually took his life were not included, what was included was outstanding and quite befittingof the Saint and of the 1970's, while there was the Vietnam Conflict (war) coming to an end. So, to pick Donovan for the words and music, which is tranquil and simple, seem to go along and compliment the St.The starting is very dramatic, which has the saint returning from war, through the fog and haze, with an appropriate piece from Donovan going. He is then ill with fever, and has vivid recollections of happenings before and during the war. His mother singing to him by his bed was tender and motherly--very sweet moment. Claire is not overly made-up, but rather natural throughout the film, would have remained at a Benedictine Monastary for a time, then, as in this film, spent most of her time at San Damiano. She is seen with lepers, during a flash-back of Francis while still recovering illness, and later his efforts of helping the lepers and the poor takes you back to the earlier portion of the film. Very interesting.Francis' life has touched my own in many ways. Simplicity. Appreciation of the ill, sick, poor, and the down trodden. Theseare lessons that Christ our Lord taught on, especially the Sermon on the Mountain. That, regardless of our modern times, westill can grasp the teachings of Christ in these areas.

Director Zeffirelli has combined beautiful artistic elements and fine story telling to make a very enjoyable film.  He used two unknown actors to play the leads to further lend a mystical quality to his Francis. The film was shot in the Tuscany town of San Gimignano, and has a great feel for an ancient version of Assisi.  After watching the movie and then walking through the streets of modern Assisi, one has a whole new appreciation of Francis and his times.  True, the film is dated and a little bit hokey in places, but the emotion is genuine and the work is obviously an effort of pure devotion. I know a number of Franciscan monks and while they all agree it is a little corny, they all enjoy the moive and recommend it to those wanting an introduction to St. Francis and the life he lived.  The DVD version is a crisp cut of the film and has good sound and color.  One trivial note: on the front cover montage, in the lower left corner, Francis is seen raising his arms in front of a church- the church is the Church of St. Francis, which wasn't built until several years after his death (his tomb is in the lowest level); and it is obviously not anywhere seen in the film!  Interesting.Die hard fans will want to obtain the Italian version of the film (Fratello Sole, Sorella Luna); it contains an additional 15 minutes not in the version here, including a few additional scenes (the opening of the Italian version has Francis and his friends drunkenly admiring the suits of armor Pietro has bought them for their upcoming military service) and extensions of some other scenes.  One of these extended scenes, cut from the American release, shows the brothers begging in the streets of Assisi and coming upon a house where a chicken is cooking; the brothers all longingly linger over the smell of the cooking chicken, until Francis comes along and pities the person who would be cruel enough to eat one of God's creatures.  I wonder why Zeffirelli chose to exclude this ""vegetarian Francis"" from the American version?  The Italian version also has different music (none of the Donovan songs), and contains a few extras (there are no extras on this DVD), including a 16 minute ""making of"" film shot with a more amatuer lens.  The clips are priceless and include some ""behind the scenes"" footage; it is a hoot to see Francis and his friends all sitting around smoking cigarettes!  ""Minerva Classics"" has released a 2 DVD set with both the Italian and American cuts of the movie- it is available other places on the web, and also in the monestary bookstore in Assisi (and is less expensive there).This is one of my favorite films, and I highly recommend it for everyone.

This film displays Zeffirelli's genius at it's clearest and is a perfect amalgamation of his other two films, ROMEO AND JULIET and JESUS OF NAZARETH. In fact it almost feels like a prequel to ROMEO AND JULIET.Ennio Guarnieri's beautiful photography is some of the greatest ever filmed. Any single frame in this movie is a work of art. The people and objects in every scene seem to radiate a certain light. Donovan's and Riz Ortolani's music is incredibly beautiful. Like ROMEO AND JULIET, Zeffirelli brings a sense of urgency to every word and movement. Everything feels extremely realistic yet romanticized; like a simple fable told by a medieval minstrel combined with early 1970's flower-power.This has to be the most underrated film I've ever seen.
