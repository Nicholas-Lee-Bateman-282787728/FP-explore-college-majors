1683601,A3AYYRWQB4ZSJV,B00H4KQN82,,"[7, 9]","05/15/14Viewed ""Screaming Skull"" and found it to be a very good print, better than two other poor DVD copies I own. Bright, reasonably clear, with only a few minor quick blemishes. Appears complete with no splices/missing frames, and no reel marker/burn marks typically found on the public domain/TV syndicated copies. I had to turn up the volume a little on the audio. It has the ""Orion"" pictures credit at the beginning, and the MGM Lion logo at the end. Appears to be as promised, a genuine studio supplied print used for this DVD.I also viewed ""Vampire Lovers"" and found it to be a very good print as well. I don't have any other DVD to compare it to, but it is a clean, bright, blemish free widescreen print with strong audio. Had to turn down my audio volume below the average setting. Shamefully admit I had never seen this movie before. I've been a fan of Ingrid Pitt since enjoying her cleavage and eastern European beauty in the war movie ""Where Eagles Dare"". Imagine my delight with all the nudity of her in this movie. It quickly won me over!Recommended buy.",5,Worth it for a nice copy of Screaming Skull alone,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1070,"['05/15/14Viewed', 'Screaming', 'Skull', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'print', 'better', 'two', 'other', 'poor', 'DVD', 'copies', 'own', 'Bright', 'reasonably', 'clear', 'only', 'few', 'minor', 'quick', 'blemishes', 'Appears', 'complete', 'splices/missing', 'frames', 'reel', 'marker/burn', 'marks', 'typically', 'found', 'public', 'domain/TV', 'syndicated', 'copies', 'had', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'little', 'audio', 'Orion', 'credit', 'beginning', 'MGM', 'Lion', 'logo', 'end', 'Appears', 'be', 'promised', 'genuine', 'studio', 'supplied', 'print', 'used', 'DVD.I', 'also', 'viewed', 'Vampire', 'Lovers', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'print', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'DVD', 'compare', 'clean', 'bright', 'blemish', 'free', 'widescreen', 'print', 'strong', 'audio', 'Had', 'turn', 'down', 'audio', 'volume', 'average', 'setting', 'Shamefully', 'admit', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Ingrid', 'Pitt', 'enjoying', 'cleavage', 'eastern', 'European', 'beauty', 'war', 'movie', 'Where', 'Eagles', 'Dare', 'Imagine', 'delight', 'nudity', 'movie', 'quickly', 'won', 'Recommended', 'buy']",Movies 4 You: Horror

The image is nice and sharp. The sound, however, isn't the greatest but maybe it never was to begin with. Too bad the movie isn't better but it is fun if you are in an undemanding mood.
