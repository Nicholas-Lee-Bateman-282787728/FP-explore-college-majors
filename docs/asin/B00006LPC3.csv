This film was action-packed and also held a dose of humor at what life is like with ""the family"" and who get promoted to side of the big man.  Another plus was Malik's commentaries and how he found amazement in what some people will kill for.  There were some unexpected moves within the movie, which added to the conflict, and the romance with the beautiful and dangerous Hylene added dimension.  The end battle with the syndicate over an act of conscience was almost like watching a video game, it was so over the top, but then, so was this movie.

720327,A1UOTG037037XY,B00006LPC3,Cleo,"[0, 0]","I thought Treach was just another Black Actor who didn't get much big work like Isaiah Washington before that doctor show.  I had no idea he was a rapper - how exciting!  He was in some terrible movie where this unrealistic rude Chinese American girl used him biblically - it was pretty embarassing to be on the Chinese side of the audience - sorry, African Americans.  Anyway, this movie is so quietly nutty but very entertaining and succinct.  Treach has really good pants and shoes and shows off his knife skills in the kitchen.  And a bunch of Black guys finally get to make some money from all those trips to Shao Lin Monastery to learn Wu Shu from the source.  There are no aerial tricks, no special effects, just a bunch of Black guys kicking perfectly at each other.  He is very pretty boy so it's still kind of unbelievable that he was part of Naughty By Nature but he had a bandana covering half his face so I guess that's how that happened.  I have to watch this movie again.  I can't quite believe it.  It's headache/stress free.  This movie also showcases the powerful advantage of having action figure muscles in portraying a character's dominance even if it is not supposed to be about physical dominance.  Muscles on male leads validate the leading man status.",5,What were they thinking?

720328,A14PS7BDSYKG9U,B00006LPC3,"K. Eisenberger ""dance music freak!""","[1, 1]",This movie stars Treach from Naughty By Nature fame as a hit man that is the best there is. The movie tells of his father killing his mother then himself so he is no stranger to violence. This brings him into contact with a white mob type guy who brings him in and teaches him the ropes along with others like him- but he is the best there is. Then the boss hires him to kill his girlfriend  but is told if he hears from him by a certain time then to spare her. But when he does so anyway  all hell breaks loose in one of the funniest fights sequences I've  seen in a long time. There is also a love interest with a Goverment agent and what most people seem to be talking about--Treach's full frontal nude scene that highlight this movie. Violent but funny. The best part is the cooking cornbread while having to go out and do a hit while trying to contact the meat/pick up guys.

720329,AIWIVN4UAFCA4,B00006LPC3,"Linda Lou ""Obsessive reader, 6-10 books a wee...","[0, 0]","I thought this action-packed film was quite good.  I've read quite a few reviews on this film over the years and I'm still not understanding all of the over-analyses over whether the script is racist in its treatment of African-Americans as killers.  I've never been a fan of what used to be called ""blaxploitation"" movies. I came of age during the initial release of such films as ""Super Fly"", ""Foxy Brown"", and ""Sweet Sweetback's Badaass Song"".  I missed them all and haven't seen too many of their contemporary counterparts and I don't think that I am any better or any worse for the experience (although I strongly believe that ""blaxploitation"" was then, and is now, a misnomer).  However, when I accidently came across this movie on cable late one night, I was hooked!!  I always thought Treach was sexy, but he laid it down in this flick!  His portrayal of Malik Bishop, a hit man with a heart, is rivoting.  What some people refer to what they call stilted acting by all the actors, I found it to be merely tongue-in-cheek camp satire.  Although violent at times, none of the scenes are gratuitous or out-of-context.  After all, the film IS about a contract killer with a conscience who is looking for the love of a good woman.  So what if she's at the ""executive level of execution"" while he's still a ""murderous mailboy""?  She handles an assault weapon in her 4"" Manolo Blahniks while carrying a back-up rocket launcher tucked away in the zippered compartment of her Birkin bag.  Her hits exhibit much better strategic planning than those of her ""future baby daddy"".  But don't most females take the lead in traditionally male-dominated positions?  Isn't it the same in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""?  With the exception of the races of the killer couples, weren't the story lines similar?  Yet, no one had anything fundamentally negative to say about the ""Brangelina"" film.  Both contain bullets, big guns, buffed bods, and big lips.  However, one film is a hit while the other goes straight to video.  If you watch this film while keeping in mind that nothing in it is meant to be serious, then you will find  ""Love and a Bullet"" to be a film rich in satirical black comedy (and I'm referring to the literary genre, not race).  The film only fails with some of the principle characters.  Kent Masters King was horribly miscast as a kept woman.  She is just not sexy enough in this role to be believable as the potential victim of a jealous rich lover.  Even her clothes were frumpy.  Kelly McGillis was hotter as an Amish woman in ""Witness""!!  Why waste a hit man of Bishop's caliber on this woman when Shug Knight is out of a job right now?  Now let's talk about what's really going on - the MALE NUDITY, albeit brief.  Wow, it is refreshing to see a man ""drop trou"" for a change - and Treach IS the man for full-frontal nudity.  Is that your gun, Mr. Treach or are you just happy to see EVERYONE?!?  I burned my DVD player up, rewinding and freeze-framing his ripped abs and everything ""South of the Border"".  Yeah, I'm down for ""O.P.P.""!

I think Treach(the rapper) could have a real future in action films, he carries this one well with an almost constant running narrative, which is engaging and funny. Plus ladies he's willing to do full frontal. The scene chewing thief in this film however is Sam Scabber, as the ""disgruntled, older, face like a fist) hitman.
