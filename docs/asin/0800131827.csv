163350,A1WLZYEOIL1HLT,0800131827,"Michael King ""Mike""","[10, 12]","Jerry Lewis stars as Gerald Clamson, a chief bank auditor who is on vacation in San Diego.  While fishing on the beach, he happens to land a frogman who looks just like him! The dying frogman, who was shot, hands Lewis a map to a stash of smuggled diamonds, and instructs him to look for a hotel with a yardarm.  This is somewhat reminiscent of the opening to the movie ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" a great film in which Jerry Lewis had a memorable cameo.  The gang he double-crossed shoots the frogman from aboard their yacht, and then swim ashore looking for the fisherman.  Jerry flees and later stumbles upon the hotel with the yardarm, the Hilton Inn.  In his rush to get there he knocks over Suzie, played by Susan Bay.  This is Susan's movie debut, as well as her only movie role to date!  She would figure prominently in the film as Jerry's love interest.  Jerry also manages to accidentally injure the front desk clerk, who refuses to rent him a room.  Determined to get into the hotel, Jerry later returns in disguise, combing his hair down, wearing a set of false buck teeth, reading glasses and an old tweed suit, and speaking in a funny voice.  This character is EXTREMELY reminiscent of the title character he played in ""The Nutty Professor.""The bulk of the film finds Jerry either in disguise or as himself, trying to stay one step ahead of the gang that wants to kill him, a different mob that wants to buy the smuggled diamonds from him, an Oriental outfit that wants the diamonds to finance their fake pearl business, and the hotel staff who want to throw him out.  Especially noteworthy is the hilarious, over-the-top performance of Charlie Callas as one of the gang members.  The big mouth in the title of the movie is an ironic reference to Jerry's failed attempts to convince anybody that his outrageous tale is true, that it's just a case of mistaken identity, and that he really doesn't know where the diamonds are.  The climax of the film takes place at SeaWorld on Mission Bay, including a scene where Jerry is disguised as a Kabuki dancer!  All the movie's characters corner him on the roof of a theater, but Susan Bay manages to arrive with a helicopter to rescue Jerry at the last minute.  This film is one of Jerry's funniest, with nonstop action, many plot twists and turns, outrageous antics, and great on location scenery.",5,"Co-written, Produced, Directed By And Starring Jerry Lewis!",1061251200,"08 19, 2003",2003,2361,"['Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Gerald', 'Clamson', 'chief', 'bank', 'auditor', 'who', 'vacation', 'San', 'Diego', 'fishing', 'beach', 'land', 'frogman', 'who', 'just', 'dying', 'frogman', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'Lewis', 'map', 'stash', 'smuggled', 'diamonds', 'look', 'hotel', 'yardarm', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'opening', 'movie', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'great', 'film', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'had', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'gang', 'double-crossed', 'shoots', 'frogman', 'yacht', 'then', 'swim', 'ashore', 'looking', 'fisherman', 'Jerry', 'flees', 'later', 'stumbles', 'hotel', 'yardarm', 'Hilton', 'Inn', 'rush', 'get', 'there', 'Suzie', 'played', 'Susan', 'Bay', 'Susan', 'movie', 'debut', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'movie', 'role', 'date', 'would', 'figure', 'prominently', 'film', 'Jerry', 'love', 'interest', 'Jerry', 'also', 'accidentally', 'injure', 'front', 'desk', 'clerk', 'who', 'rent', 'room', 'Determined', 'get', 'hotel', 'Jerry', 'later', 'disguise', 'combing', 'hair', 'down', 'wearing', 'set', 'false', 'buck', 'teeth', 'reading', 'glasses', 'old', 'tweed', 'suit', 'speaking', 'funny', 'voice', 'character', 'EXTREMELY', 'reminiscent', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'bulk', 'film', 'Jerry', 'either', 'disguise', 'trying', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'gang', 'kill', 'different', 'mob', 'buy', 'smuggled', 'diamonds', 'Oriental', 'outfit', 'diamonds', 'finance', 'fake', 'pearl', 'business', 'hotel', 'staff', 'who', 'want', 'throw', 'out', 'Especially', 'noteworthy', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Charlie', 'Callas', 'one', 'gang', 'members', 'big', 'mouth', 'title', 'movie', 'ironic', 'reference', 'Jerry', 'failed', 'attempts', 'convince', 'anybody', 'outrageous', 'tale', 'true', 'just', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'diamonds', 'are', 'climax', 'film', 'place', 'SeaWorld', 'Mission', 'Bay', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'Jerry', 'disguised', 'Kabuki', 'dancer', 'movie', 'characters', 'corner', 'roof', 'theater', 'Susan', 'Bay', 'arrive', 'helicopter', 'rescue', 'Jerry', 'last', 'minute', 'film', 'one', 'Jerry', 'funniest', 'nonstop', 'action', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'great', 'location', 'scenery']",N/A
163351,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0800131827,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","""An Emperor who cares for nothing but his appearance and attire hires two tailors who promise him the finest suit of clothes from a fabric invisible to anyone who is unfit for his position or ""just hopelessly stupid"". The Emperor cannot see the cloth himself, but pretends that he can for fear of appearing unfit for his position; his ministers do the same. When the swindlers report that the suit is finished, they mime dressing him and the Emperor then marches in procession before his subjects, who play along with the pretense. Suddenly, a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all......"".""The Big Mouth"" was perhaps the greatest inside joke on audiences since the 1938 radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"". Billed as a comedy, heavily promoted, widely distributed, and featuring Jerry Lewis (who played multiple roles, wrote, and directed) this was a must see for our junior high group of cut-ups. We found the experience a surreal one. A comedy film where nobody in the theater laughed including us (absolutely no laughter).  We caught on quicker than the adults that this was a complete sham but were spellbound waiting for a single funny sequence that would shatter the audience silence.  It never happened.Afterward we scanned newspaper and magazine reviews for some sign that a prominent reviewer was going to spill the beans and expose the ""Emperor"", but there was nothing.  It was like the whole industry had clammed up by mutual agreement to allow Columbia to recover a portion of their investment. I suspect that this kind of industry-wide ""quid pro quo"" was fairly common in those days.  Word of mouth (pun intended) in our town killed attendance within a few days, although some may have attended just to observe Hollywood finally bottoming out. ""The Big Month"" deserves a place in cinema history because it was this bottoming out process that opened the door for innovative stuff like ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Easy Rider"" in mainstream theaters.In fairness the chase sequences might have had some amusement value except they had been done much better by Harvey Lembeck (playing Eric Von Zipper) in countless beach movies released earlier in the decade.The only saving grace at the time for us 14-year-olds was that Jeannine Riley (Billie Jo from ""Petticoat Junction"") was featured in several eye-scorching outfits.Then again, what do I know?

163353,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,0800131827,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 1]","I've loved 1967's ""The Big Mouth"" ever since I saw it on TV growing up. In the age of hippie counter-culture, mod fashion & the Vietnam War, it was proof that Jerry Lewis could still pull a rabbit out of the hat & create a wildly funny comedy, far outdistancing such misfires as ""Way...Way Out"" and ""Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River"". After  experimenting with his comic style to adapt to modern tastes (the results very uneven), Lewis wisely returned to his comedic roots with a movie that's not only hilarious, but more importantly, GOOD.Here, he's still the same outrageous, spastic, broadly mugging Jerry; the difference is that he's tweaked his characterization to be a hapless innocent caught up in a zany tale of mistaken identity, stolen jewels, coincidental romance, and multiple disguises (a shtick Lewis performs wonderfully; look at past comedies like ""The Family Jewels"" or ""Three on a Couch""). Again, Lewis turns himself into a living cartoon in some gags, and allows the excellent cast (Charlie Callas, in his film debut, is particularly memorable) to share the laughs, such as Harold Stone, Leonard Stone, Del Moore, etc.The theme of the film slyly parodies the popularity of the current James Bond series as Lewis' character is pitted against some menacing but amusing villains. There's many moments to treasure in this contagiously fun comedy (too many to go over). One running gag has thugs reacting to supposedly-dead Lewis' appearance in the extreme: One turns into a dog; another spits out all his teeth, his hair looking like he's been electrocuted, and fixed in a zombie-like state; and the third (Callas) trembling and speaking incoherently, incorporating Callas' trademark grunts, snorts & assorted weird noises.So I have to beg Columbia Pictures: PLEASE release this hilarious Jerry Lewis comedy to DVD!
