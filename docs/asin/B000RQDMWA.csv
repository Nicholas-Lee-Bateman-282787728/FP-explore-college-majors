With a drama that unveils the progression of this insidious disease, Fiona, herself, can only describe saying, ""I think I'm beginning to disappear,""  we get a revealing portrait of aging like no other in memory since `On Golden Pond'.  Said as a matter of fact without a trace of self-pity, we get glimpses at times of her quiet terror.  More of a focal point, her husband, Grant (Canadian actor Gordon Pinchot of 'Red Green' fame, here in a beautifully understated pensive performance) mirrors the torment as she forgets him as her husband when they both agree to committing her to Meadowlake, a facility handling Alzheimer's patients as a specialty.  Using cross-country skiing and Icelandic books to elicit memory, Grant must face the clinical facts of his wife's closing synapses.  The story zeroes on his dilemma as he tries to sort out his guilt over his past transgressions and discerning her continuing decline.Deliberately slow moving, `Away from Her' reveals the degeneration well with Christie's excellent performance.  Both husband and wife have flashbacks to earlier times, trying to live in a mindset when life was not as much of a struggle.  As consolation Grant has a neighbor friend, Marianne (Olympia Dukakis) whose husband, Aubrey, is suffering from the same illness, making Mari a good resource.  Some of the beautiful scenes with their cozy home in the snow and  Grant's conversations with Meadowlake caretaker,  (Kirsten Thomas) give some emotional depth to the story.  Sarah Polley's screen adaptation and directing give the drama laudably understated realism which could have easily been overdone.  All the performances shine, and Christie gives us a flashback of brilliance like O'Toole did earlier this year.

1083855,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000RQDMWA,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[7, 8]","Away From Her mildly portrays the agony of an Alzheimer patient and spouse.  The story revolves a woman who develops Alzheimers disease and while in the nursing/treatment home, through confusion, she begins a relationship with another patient.  As Fiona and Grant, Julie Christie and Gordon Pinset have portrayed the characters well, especially the pain we see in Grant's eyes when he can't reach out to his wife as her interest is with another patient.However, as a directorial debut, the film mildly portrays the pain and agony of an Alzheimers care giver/spouse.  For example, frequently, we view the ""nursing home"" setting that is far from reality.  I can't imagine an Alzheimer/nursing home main common room being so docile, silent, structured, everyone playing cards, displaying excellent behavior, etc.  The room and settings were just too staged.Also, a few ""incidences"" thrown in that gives us a view of other patient's condition and that, too, didn't portray convincing. We also have the staff intervene, and they seem so out of place.We don't have much time to absorb the marital relationship of Fiona and Grant, therefore, we miss out on the bond that enables us to ""feel"" deeply for Grant. Characters must evolve enough for us, the viewer to feel for them, whether they like or dislike them.Interspersed with flashback, one might need to pay attention, as there are no defining transitions, in other words not done well. Olympia Dukakis plays the wife of the other man who Fiona encounters.  Here, again, the character role was lacking in development.Julie Christie...Oscar nomination???

1083856,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000RQDMWA,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","I had some reservation walking into ""Away From Her"". First of all I thought the title was terrible. To be honest I still think it is a bad title. Secondly, I wasn't sure what kind of job director Sarah Polley would turn out to be.Polley, for those who don't know is an actress who has gained some fame from the independent movie crowd for her work with Atom Egoyan (one of the executive producers of this film) and David Cronenberg. She is only 28 so I couldn't quite understand why this story would appeal to her.I'm happy to say I was wrong. Polley is a born story-teller. She directs with such a sure hand it makes you think what else is she going to give us in the future. The way she handles her actors (all pros), her ability to know where to place the camera, and her sense of pacing impressed me so much.""Away From Her"" is the emotional story of a man (Gordon Pinsent) whom after 42 years of marriage comes to realize his wife (Julie Christie) is suffering from alzheimer's disease. She decides it would be best if she goes to an institution where she can be properly taken care of. This goes against her husbands' wishes, who wants to turn a blind eye to her behavior, saying things like, ""she was always different"".When at the institution Fiona (Christie) ends up starting a relationship with another patient, Aubrey (Michael Murphy). Fiona does not remember that she is married. She does not recognize her husband when he comes to visit.Of course Grant (Pinset) does recognize his wife, and as one can imagine it is hard knowing first of all your wife doesn't know who you are and secondly, seeing her flirt with another man in front of you.After reading the story you could pretty much tell what kind of story we are dealing with. This is a weeping romance novel on film. In fact it was based on a novel written by Alice Munro, ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain"".""Away From Her"" doesn't do everything it could have. It doesn't really dwell into how alzheimer's can truly affect people's lives. The alzheimer's is used as a romantic device. It gives the film that kind of tragic, failed, doomed, romance feel to it. This is not a put down. I'm just trying to warn viewers expecting something different. If you thought the film was going to address alzheimer's in a realistic manner, this isn't the film for you.""Away From Her"" though does work fine as a romance. It is heartfelt and sincere. The performances by Pinsent and Christie are great. Everyone and his brother has been throwing praise at Christie, and it is well deserved, but, please, lets not forget Pinsent. He is great in this role. He is really the heart and conscience of the film. It is his story really. Some of you may recognize him from ""The Shipping News"" and ""The Good Shepherd"".""Away From Her"" is one of the year's best films. It is very emotional and incredibly well made. Sarah Polley is a new voice in cinema that is meant to be taken serious.Bottom-line: One of the year's best film. This directorial debut from Sarah Polley proves what kind of new force she will be. The performances are pitch perfect.",4,"""Away"" Contains Brilliance",1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,3089,"['had', 'reservation', 'walking', 'Away', 'First', 'thought', 'title', 'was', 'terrible', 'be', 'honest', 'still', 'think', 'bad', 'title', 'Secondly', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'job', 'director', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be.Polley', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actress', 'who', 'gained', 'fame', 'independent', 'movie', 'crowd', 'work', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'film', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'only', '28', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'story', 'would', 'appeal', 'her.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'was', 'wrong', 'Polley', 'born', 'story-teller', 'such', 'sure', 'hand', 'think', 'what', 'else', 'going', 'give', 'future', 'way', 'actors', 'pros', 'ability', 'know', 'where', 'place', 'camera', 'sense', 'pacing', 'impressed', 'so', 'much', 'Away', 'emotional', 'story', 'man', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'whom', '42', 'years', 'marriage', 'realize', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'suffering', 'alzheimer', 'disease', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'institution', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'properly', 'taken', 'care', 'husbands', 'wishes', 'who', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'behavior', 'saying', 'things', 'was', 'always', 'different', '.When', 'institution', 'Fiona', 'Christie', 'up', 'starting', 'relationship', 'patient', 'Aubrey', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'Fiona', 'not', 'remember', 'married', 'not', 'recognize', 'husband', 'when', 'visit.Of', 'course', 'Grant', 'Pinset', 'recognize', 'wife', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'hard', 'knowing', 'first', 'wife', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', 'secondly', 'seeing', 'flirt', 'man', 'front', 'you.After', 'reading', 'story', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'what', 'kind', 'story', 'are', 'dealing', 'weeping', 'romance', 'novel', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'Bear', 'Came', 'Mountain', 'Away', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'could', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'dwell', 'how', 'alzheimer', 'can', 'truly', 'affect', 'people', 'lives', 'alzheimer', 'used', 'romantic', 'device', 'film', 'kind', 'tragic', 'failed', 'doomed', 'romance', 'feel', 'not', 'put', 'down', ""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'warn', 'viewers', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'address', 'alzheimer', 'realistic', 'manner', ""n't"", 'film', 'Away', 'though', 'work', 'fine', 'romance', 'heartfelt', 'sincere', 'performances', 'Pinsent', 'Christie', 'are', 'great', 'Everyone', 'brother', 'been', 'throwing', 'praise', 'Christie', 'well', 'deserved', 'please', 'not', 'forget', 'Pinsent', 'great', 'role', 'really', 'heart', 'conscience', 'film', 'story', 'really', 'may', 'recognize', 'Shipping', 'News', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'Away', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'very', 'emotional', 'incredibly', 'well', 'made', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'new', 'voice', 'cinema', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'serious.Bottom-line', 'One', 'year', 'best', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'what', 'kind', 'new', 'force', 'will', 'be', 'performances', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect']",N/A
1083857,A3C00N4UHA5XYX,B000RQDMWA,alooknac,"[2, 3]","I expected more from these actors and this much acclaimed film. I thought it was boring as all get out. It kept jumping around sequentially and at one point I realized it had taken about 15 minutes just to watch the male lead pull up to a house, park his car, and go up to the door, and I still was unsure of who the person who answered the door was.Gordon Pinsent had only one facial expression the whole 30 or 45 minutes I watched. Everybody except the tour guide at the nursing home talked in the same subdued voices.If anyone cares, there definitely was at least one F word; the husband uses it towards his wife when she teases him and he can't take it.Lots of unrealistic stuff. Why would the husband leave his wife's room and then zip his fly and buckle his belt in the public hallway of the nursing home? Does he have Alzheimers too? I couldn't keep watching long enough to find out. Fiona deciding that it was time to go into full care seemed absurd. Most people use in-home care or assisted care until their condition progresses too far. I've never heard of anyone just deciding to check themselves into full care; usually people fight it tooth and nail, don't even want to give up their drivers license. Would you let someone with Alzheimers go off crosscountry skiing alone and not go looking for them till it's almost dark?I thought the care facility was unrealistic, but now that I've read that the film is Canadian, it may well be accurate, just not what we Americans are used to. My aunt went into a Canadian nursing home and it was somewhat like the one in the film and she didn't have lots of money. In fact (and this is less than 10 years ago) she had about $100,000 total assets and her attorney told me it would last her about 10 years in that nursing home. (Try that in the U.S.!) Contrast that with my mother, who had dementia, and ended up in a top echelon nursing home in a major U.S. city, that couldn't hold a candle to the one in the film. Even so, it was where the elite of the city ended up--a former newscaster, head of a large nonprofit, CEO's, etc. Don't get me wrong, it was a very nice nursing home,just not the luxury level depicted in the movie.",2,"Didn't Like It, Gave Up Watching",1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,2181,"['expected', 'more', 'actors', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'boring', 'get', 'out', 'kept', 'jumping', 'around', 'sequentially', 'one', 'point', 'realized', 'had', 'taken', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'just', 'watch', 'male', 'lead', 'pull', 'up', 'house', 'park', 'car', 'go', 'up', 'door', 'still', 'was', 'unsure', 'who', 'person', 'who', 'answered', 'door', 'was.Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'whole', '30', '45', 'minutes', 'watched', 'Everybody', 'tour', 'guide', 'nursing', 'home', 'talked', 'same', 'subdued', 'anyone', 'cares', 'definitely', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'F', 'word', 'husband', 'wife', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'it.Lots', 'unrealistic', 'stuff', 'Why', 'would', 'husband', 'leave', 'wife', 'room', 'then', 'zip', 'fly', 'buckle', 'belt', 'public', 'hallway', 'nursing', 'home', 'have', 'Alzheimers', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'watching', 'long', 'enough', 'find', 'out', 'Fiona', 'deciding', 'was', 'time', 'go', 'full', 'care', 'seemed', 'absurd', 'Most', 'people', 'use', 'in-home', 'care', 'assisted', 'care', 'condition', 'too', 'far', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'just', 'deciding', 'check', 'full', 'care', 'usually', 'people', 'fight', 'nail', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'drivers', 'license', 'Would', 'let', 'someone', 'Alzheimers', 'go', 'off', 'crosscountry', 'skiing', 'alone', 'not', 'go', 'looking', 'till', 'almost', 'dark', 'thought', 'care', 'facility', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'now', ""'ve"", 'read', 'film', 'Canadian', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'accurate', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'Americans', 'are', 'used', 'My', 'aunt', 'went', 'Canadian', 'nursing', 'home', 'was', 'somewhat', 'one', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lots', 'money', 'fact', 'less', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'had', '100,000', 'total', 'assets', 'attorney', 'told', 'would', 'last', '10', 'years', 'nursing', 'home', 'Try', 'U.S.', 'Contrast', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'dementia', 'ended', 'up', 'top', 'echelon', 'nursing', 'home', 'major', 'U.S.', 'city', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'one', 'film', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'where', 'elite', 'city', 'ended', 'up', 'former', 'newscaster', 'head', 'large', 'nonprofit', 'CEO', 'etc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'nursing', 'home', 'just', 'not', 'luxury', 'level', 'depicted', 'movie']",N/A
1083858,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000RQDMWA,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 10]","`Away from Her' is one of those movies that really got inside of me, inside my soul and made me look at my life now and in the future and contemplate the man I would one day become.  It's true testament of a wonderful and utterly breathtaking film when one is that deeply moved by it, not just to tears or emotions but to actions.  `Away from Her' is a film that will make you strive to be a better person, husband, wife, father, mother, child, whatever the case may be, because the deep-seated moral of this film is one that begs to be dissected and analyzed for the betterment of the viewer.There's a moment within the film where Gordon Pinsent (who so deserves an Oscar for this performance) is sitting on a bench watching the woman that used to be his wife conversing with a man she feels she now loves and that single scene is so emotionally overwhelming I felt I was going to lose it.  It was in that scene though that I finally realized what this movie was all about, and as I sat there, my gaze shifting from the screen to my wife who was nursing our child I felt the tears rolling down my cheek as I wondered if I would be that strong if that time ever came.The film follows an elderly couple, Grant and Fiona, who have had a wonderful life together until Fiona's Alzheimer's begins to make their life all the more difficult.  Against his wishes Grant eventually gives into Fiona's persistence and admits her into a home for those suffering for this condition.  Regulations don't allow him to visit Fiona for thirty days, which proves to be just enough time for her to forget him entirely and form a romantic bond with another patient Aubrey.  Faithfully Grant visits his wife every day, trying his hardest to make her remember their love but it seems almost hopeless.What makes this movie so incredibly moving are the powerful performances by the entire cast, but especially those of Pinsent and Mrs. Julie Christie (who will most likely get her Oscar for this).  Pinsent and Christie both avail themselves to the central core of their characters, playing them as real people and not overly emotional, dramatized or clich&eacute;d variations of what Hollywood would like them to be.  With extreme delicacy and subtlety they embody Grant and Fiona and bring them to life before our eyes.  Another standout here is Olympia Dukakis who brilliantly compliments Gordon's performance.  Dukakis plays Marion, the wife of Fiona's new love interest Aubrey.  With their spouses falling into their own relationship Grant and Marion find themselves relying on each other for support and stability.  Michael Murphy also delivers a solid if wordlessly convincing performance as Aubrey, but he's easily overshadowed by his costars.Sarah Polley, a young actress who never seemed to get the attention she deserved, stakes her claim to fame with this impressive directorial debut.  Her style is reminiscent of another favorite of mine Todd Field (who is also an actor turned director) in his directorial debut `In the Bedroom'.  While arguably Todd's masterpiece is a little more refined and polished a film and in effect I believe is a better film, Polley's debut can also be considered a masterpiece of sorts.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that `Away from Her' is the finest film I've seen so far this year.  Pinsent and Christie should both be up for Oscars come the years end, although sadly I feel that Pinsent has less than a fair shot.`Away from Her' is a film I believe everyone should see for it is a film that reaches the soul and can move any and everyone.  There is rarely a movie this powerful, this magnificent that it `deserves' to be seen.  If only I could get across the emotions this film brought out in me, but I fear that I could never do them justice.  I guess the best I can do is urge you to see this movie and experience those emotions for yourself for that is the only way you could truly understand.",5,"She was taken away from him, but he would never let her go; a truly moving and magical film...",1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,3916,"['Away', 'Her', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'got', 'soul', 'made', 'look', 'life', 'now', 'future', 'contemplate', 'man', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'true', 'testament', 'wonderful', 'utterly', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'deeply', 'moved', 'not', 'just', 'tears', 'emotions', 'actions', 'Away', 'Her', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'strive', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'husband', 'wife', 'father', 'mother', 'child', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'deep-seated', 'moral', 'film', 'one', 'be', 'dissected', 'analyzed', 'betterment', 'viewer.There', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'who', 'so', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'sitting', 'bench', 'watching', 'woman', 'used', 'be', 'wife', 'conversing', 'man', 'now', 'single', 'scene', 'so', 'emotionally', 'overwhelming', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'lose', 'was', 'scene', 'finally', 'realized', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'sat', 'there', 'gaze', 'shifting', 'screen', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'nursing', 'child', 'felt', 'tears', 'rolling', 'down', 'cheek', 'wondered', 'would', 'be', 'strong', 'time', 'ever', 'came.The', 'film', 'elderly', 'couple', 'Grant', 'Fiona', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'wonderful', 'life', 'together', 'Fiona', 'Alzheimer', 'begins', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'difficult', 'Against', 'wishes', 'Grant', 'eventually', 'Fiona', 'persistence', 'home', 'suffering', 'condition', 'Regulations', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'visit', 'Fiona', 'thirty', 'days', 'be', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'forget', 'entirely', 'form', 'romantic', 'bond', 'patient', 'Aubrey', 'Faithfully', 'Grant', 'wife', 'day', 'trying', 'hardest', 'make', 'remember', 'love', 'almost', 'hopeless.What', 'movie', 'so', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'are', 'powerful', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'Pinsent', 'Mrs.', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'who', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'get', 'Oscar', 'Pinsent', 'Christie', 'avail', 'central', 'core', 'characters', 'playing', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'overly', 'emotional', 'dramatized', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'variations', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'extreme', 'delicacy', 'subtlety', 'embody', 'Grant', 'Fiona', 'bring', 'life', 'eyes', 'standout', 'here', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'Gordon', 'performance', 'Dukakis', 'Marion', 'wife', 'Fiona', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Aubrey', 'spouses', 'falling', 'own', 'relationship', 'Grant', 'Marion', 'find', 'relying', 'other', 'support', 'stability', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'also', 'solid', 'wordlessly', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Aubrey', 'easily', 'overshadowed', 'costars.Sarah', 'Polley', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'seemed', 'get', 'attention', 'deserved', 'claim', 'fame', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Todd', 'Field', 'who', 'also', 'actor', 'turned', 'director', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Bedroom', 'arguably', 'Todd', 'masterpiece', 'little', 'more', 'refined', 'polished', 'film', 'effect', 'believe', 'better', 'film', 'Polley', 'debut', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'sorts', 'fact', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'Away', 'Her', 'finest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'Pinsent', 'Christie', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'Oscars', 'come', 'years', 'end', 'sadly', 'feel', 'Pinsent', 'less', 'fair', 'shot.', 'Away', 'Her', 'film', 'believe', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'soul', 'can', 'move', 'everyone', 'rarely', 'movie', 'powerful', 'magnificent', 'deserves', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'emotions', 'film', 'brought', 'out', 'fear', 'could', 'never', 'do', 'justice', 'guess', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'urge', 'see', 'movie', 'experience', 'emotions', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'truly', 'understand']",N/A

Egoyan is listed as an Executive Producer here.  Ms. Polley obviously observed him closely.  She's applied those lessons well.Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent are both outstanding.  Christie - radiant at 66 - is heartbreaking.  She's also a living lesson to Hollywood about growing old gracefully and being comfortable with who you are.  She's such a pleasant sight instead of these botox/collagen freaks.  I also liked Michael Murphy's excellent turn as 'Aubrey.'

The film is more about the story that develops dealing with the mans wife and her new male friend taking care of each other, and how the man has to deal with his wife in the condition that she's in.I liked the movie.

The complexity of his character is as enigmatic as Fiona's. Together, their love story provides hope for anyone who has stopped believing in love.While this film sheds light on Fiona's descent into Alzheimer's disease, the film is neither about dementia nor is it about the hopelessness that often surrounds it. It is about the unexpected storms that overtake relationships and the ways in which two good people come to grips with disruption.  For Alice Munro, whose story provides the basis of the screenplay, love is riddled with extraordinary pain, but it often conquers the odds.Gorgeous nature cinematography is a character in the film. In the opening scene, as in occasional scenes after, the lovers cross-country ski across frozen landscapes suffused with an Alpine glow.  They are at peace, saying few words but sharing what could never be spoken.The scene in which Fiona, sensing her decline into dementia, becomes momentarily lost -- only to become a snow angel, suggests that even early dementia has its respite.Thre were a number of minor issues that troubled me.  Julie Christie's American/Canadian accent wasn't persuasive at the start. The example the director uses to objectify early dementia -- putting an object to be refrigerated into a cabinet -- is too common to be considered aberrant.The nurse overseeing Fiona's unit delves a to deeply into the history of the couple, more than is believable. In turn, the nursing home admin is just a too evil to fit into the world we know. Many administrators are kind but impotent. Some rage against the undue influence of physicians over their nurses prevails.Love scenes between unlikely bedfellows seem superfluous here, even though they can and do occur in ""real life.""The final scene, which I will not disclose, is worth the trip.  It summarizes, in brief, passionate strokes, what love is, and it does so in terms which are fallible but filled with character.This very young, gifted director has delivered a poignnt film. It should be required viewing for anyone entering the helping professions, but also the betrothed.In today's prurient terms, love is not what ""they"" think, nor it it what most of us think. The director has taken great pains to reveal truths in a manner both restrained and dignified.AWAY FROM HER may be one the best films of the year. And Gordon Pinsent delivers an incredible performance -- which brought tears to my eyes more than once.I'd grant five easy stars, even though the  DVD release appears to have been redited from the theatrical version.

Alzheimer's is a worldwide problem that cost billions of dollars in healthcare costs, rips at the fabric of families, and challenges us as a people to come up with ways of handling this mind-killer. And the best way to focus on this problem is to encapsulate it via one couple and show the havoc this disease wreaks. Thus we get AWAY FROM HER, actress Sarah Polley's first time in the director's chair. If it's any indication as to Mrs. Polley's future behind the camera, I'd say we're in for some great cinema from her.I enjoyed this film for a couple of reasons. First is what I mentioned above about showing world issues. Second is the simplicity of the filming. There are no camera tricks, no lingering shots on falling leaves to indicate the end of one's life, and no easing into how difficult it is to let go of the mind (and eventually their body) of someone you've loved all your life. It's hard, cold and ultimately forces one to deal with situations they never thought possible. And finally I have to mention the acting.Julie Christie is getting plenty of awards buzz because of her portrayal as Fiona Anderson, an aging woman who seems too young to be getting Alzheimer's. Although I enjoyed her acting immensely, it paled in comparison to Gordon Pinsent's awesome portrayal as Grant, her husband and man she leaves behind.Pinsent played the perfect role as the equally lost husband, forced to put his wife in an institution designed for Alzheimer's patients and watch her slowly decay and drift from him. Pinsent goes through all of the emotions, from denial, anger and finally acceptance.Olympia Dukakis plays Marian, a woman who's husband lives in the same institution as Fiona. As Fiona and Marian's husband become too close for comfort for both Grant and Marian, the two are forced together in hopes of connecting again with someone their own age who are experiencing the same horrific life-ending events of their spouses. Dukakis plays her role well and one scene in particular between her and Pinsent will probably make viewers both laugh and cry in the same moment.My only complaint with Away From Her is that all of the major award groups (Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG, etc.) neglected to nominate Pinsent, while Julie Christie has been showered with them. It doesn't seem fair. The one's left behind -- after Alzheimer's -- pack the most emotional wallop when translating such devastation to film. And Pinsent pulled it off perfectly.",5,Hey! Academy!

As of last year she was nothing more than an actor, today she is also known for the film ""Away From Her"" which she wrote and directed and does so with some authority. She has obviously tried quite hard to make a good movie here, and in the process has won rave reviews in some of the most prestigious newspapers in the country. My take is that the film is neither good nor bad, somewhere in the middle. A powerhouse first half is not enough to sustain the second half that never really evolves past its set up and instead feels like a geriatric wife swap. Polley's directing has a consistent tone throughout and everything looks very professional. Once in a while her editing shows its seams as there are gaps in the actor's movements, but this is a trivial complaint. It is an intelligent, sad, thought provoking film that is weighed down by its pacing that has a mothbally taste to it.The story centers on Fiona and Grant, an elderly couple who begin to realize that her memory ain't what it used to be.  He looks into nursing home and rejects the idea outright, but for some reason she insists. Once there her memory rots more and more (or does it?) and she begins to keep company with Aubrey who is used as a stand in husband since she claims to not remember Grant anymore. He continues to visit his wife, pushing loyalty well past the point of common sense. His visits are either useless or just him taking part in his own abuse. . .or both I suppose. The nursing home is filled with weakly drawn but endearing characters (the best being a former Winnipeg Jets play-by-play guy who can't stop using his radio voice). But the nursing home itself does not do a very good job of representing its own kind. Grant allows Fiona to be immersed into the world because she demands it, but he sees it as a place of regimented happiness, corporate talking points, and unexplained policies out the wazoo. As the movies continues and eventually winds down all the characters are forced to make tough decisions as to how to deal with the brutal hand that they have been dealt.The aspect I found to be most interesting was whether or not Fiona was really losing her mind or if it was just a subversive act to avenge Grant's former indiscretions. She is the one who pushed for the change and she is the one who immediately jumped into a new relationship (which she also rubs in Grant's face). On the drive into her new retirement community Fiona scolds Grant for his former adulterous behavior. Convenient timing I would say. If it is revenge then the payback isn't exactly Biblical, more like passive aggressive Machiavelli. And maybe that tactic hurts him more, not knowing if he is being put on or merely forgotten. Fiona claims that Aubrey doesn't confuse her, but to the viewer's eyes all he provides to the relationship is a comatose body that Fiona can push around the hospital. He would have a tough time confusing anybody. Throughout my many years of watching movies I have seen many excuses for adultery but lost marbles is a new one to me. . .that is assuming that the marbles were actually lost.

Grant is in denial even though he witnesses Firona becoming more distant and distracted over time. When she decides it is time for her to enter an assisted living facility, Grant s  heartbroken and lost within the world they had created for themselves. After the 30 days restriction policy where residents were not allowed any contact with friends or relatives, Grant is anxious to greet his wife at long last.  He is devastated when he discovers that she no longer remembers him, and shockingly enough he also has to come to terms with the fact that Fiorna seems to have developed a new life for herself that he is not a part of. He clings to the memories they had both shared but, whereas they confuse her. On top of that, Grant's past haunts him and he desperately wants to find a way to help his wife now as a final act. Not only because of his failures but, to ensure her happiness at all costs and for the devotion she had had toward him.  What he 'gives,' and what he gives up,  is heartbreaking and yet symbolizes his strong deep, true love for her. As well, it was Firona's love for Grant is what had persuaded her decide to enter into the facility in the first place. She wanted to give him a chance to develop at a new life without her as a burden. This is an excellent movie that represents the devotion couples create over time, despite turbulences during their marriage.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","Twenty-seven year old Sarah Polley has written and directed ""Away from Her,"" based on a short story by Canadian author Alice Munro.  This deeply moving film traces the final stages of a marriage that has lasted for over four decades.  Fiona and Grant Andersson live in a beautiful home in Canada, and on the surface they seem like a perfect couple.  However, Fiona has begun to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  As time passes, she wanders off, misplaces things, and has memory lapses that increase in severity.  Fiona is aware of her condition and she and her husband reluctantly decide that she should move into Meadowbrook, an upscale facility that caters to patients suffering from varying degrees of dementia.  Grant, who in his youth was a philanderer, is guilt-ridden and devastated; he fears that he is about to lose his beloved wife forever.  However, Fiona courageously accepts the inevitable and urges her husband to do the same.Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent is amazing as an aging spouse who stands by helplessly while his wife slowly disappears from his life.  He is consumed with jealously when Fiona forms a close bond in Meadowbrook with a fellow resident, Aubrey, played without words by the expressive veteran actor, Michael Murphy.  In a moment of lucidity, Fiona explains to Grant that Aubrey doesn't confuse her by expecting her to remember things.  Julie Christie should be an Oscar contender for her indelible performance as a woman whose beauty and understanding has deepened with age, but who unfortunately, is experiencing frightening and irrevocable mental deterioration.  Her luminous blue eyes and marvelous smile light up Christie's magnificent face. Sadly, as her memory fades and she loses her reason for living, Fiona becomes increasingly despondent and lost.  The scenes between Christie and Pinsent are master classes in understated acting.  Polley wisely steps back and gives her characters the space they need to fully inhabit their roles.Olympia Dukakis is perfect as Marian, Aubrey's wife and sole companion.  She is a cynical but realistic woman who cannot afford to keep her husband in Meadowbrook indefinitely.  When a bewildered Grant visits Marian to discuss Fiona's relationship with Aubrey, Marian dismisses him at first, but she eventually decides that she must reach out to someone or she will wither away emotionally.  In a key supporting role, Kristen Thomson portrays a perky and compassionate nurse whose advice and support help Grant adjust to the unsettling changes in his life.  Wendy Crewson is a condescending and officious bureaucrat who runs Meadowbrook with a plastered-on smile and a kindergarten teacher's voice.  Cinematographer Luc Montpelier makes the most of the beautiful Ontario landscape and his close-ups lend an air of intimacy to every scene.  ""Away from Her"" will bring tears to the eyes of anyone who has lost a loved one to Alzheimer's.  It is a restrained and touching film about imperfect people trying their best to confront tragedy with grace and dignity.",5,Heartbreaking.,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3042,"['Twenty-seven', 'year', 'old', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'written', 'directed', 'Away', 'Her', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Canadian', 'author', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'deeply', 'moving', 'film', 'final', 'stages', 'marriage', 'lasted', 'four', 'decades', 'Fiona', 'Grant', 'Andersson', 'live', 'beautiful', 'home', 'Canada', 'surface', 'seem', 'perfect', 'couple', 'However', 'Fiona', 'begun', 'develop', 'symptoms', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'time', 'passes', 'off', 'misplaces', 'things', 'memory', 'lapses', 'increase', 'severity', 'Fiona', 'aware', 'condition', 'husband', 'reluctantly', 'decide', 'should', 'move', 'Meadowbrook', 'upscale', 'facility', 'caters', 'patients', 'suffering', 'varying', 'degrees', 'dementia', 'Grant', 'who', 'youth', 'was', 'philanderer', 'guilt-ridden', 'devastated', 'lose', 'beloved', 'wife', 'forever', 'However', 'Fiona', 'courageously', 'inevitable', 'husband', 'do', 'same.Canadian', 'actor', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'amazing', 'aging', 'spouse', 'who', 'helplessly', 'wife', 'slowly', 'life', 'consumed', 'jealously', 'when', 'Fiona', 'close', 'bond', 'Meadowbrook', 'fellow', 'resident', 'Aubrey', 'played', 'words', 'expressive', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'moment', 'lucidity', 'Fiona', 'Grant', 'Aubrey', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'expecting', 'remember', 'things', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'should', 'be', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'indelible', 'performance', 'woman', 'beauty', 'understanding', 'deepened', 'age', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'experiencing', 'frightening', 'irrevocable', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'luminous', 'blue', 'eyes', 'marvelous', 'smile', 'light', 'up', 'Christie', 'magnificent', 'face', 'Sadly', 'memory', 'fades', 'reason', 'living', 'Fiona', 'increasingly', 'despondent', 'lost', 'scenes', 'Christie', 'Pinsent', 'are', 'master', 'classes', 'understated', 'acting', 'Polley', 'wisely', 'back', 'characters', 'space', 'need', 'fully', 'inhabit', 'roles.Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'perfect', 'Marian', 'Aubrey', 'wife', 'sole', 'companion', 'cynical', 'realistic', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'keep', 'husband', 'Meadowbrook', 'indefinitely', 'When', 'bewildered', 'Grant', 'visits', 'Marian', 'discuss', 'Fiona', 'relationship', 'Aubrey', 'Marian', 'first', 'eventually', 'must', 'reach', 'out', 'someone', 'will', 'wither', 'away', 'emotionally', 'key', 'supporting', 'role', 'Kristen', 'Thomson', 'perky', 'compassionate', 'nurse', 'advice', 'support', 'help', 'Grant', 'adjust', 'unsettling', 'changes', 'life', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'condescending', 'officious', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'Meadowbrook', 'plastered-on', 'smile', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'voice', 'Cinematographer', 'Luc', 'Montpelier', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Ontario', 'landscape', 'close-ups', 'lend', 'air', 'intimacy', 'scene', 'Away', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'anyone', 'who', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'Alzheimer', 'restrained', 'touching', 'film', 'imperfect', 'people', 'trying', 'best', 'confront', 'tragedy', 'grace', 'dignity']",N/A
1083874,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000RQDMWA,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","At 28, Canadian actress Sarah Polley already has a prodigious career exploring characters with searing intelligence and psychological depth (Guinevere,The Sweet Hereafter). With the addition of director and writer to her resume, she offers a film most unexpected from someone so young since it reflects a keen perspective that recognizes the subtle changes in relationships that have endured for decades. The 2007 film is a compelling character-driven study of people well past sixty, all dealing with loss in various forms. The chief focus is on Grant, a retired English professor, and his wife Fiona, a handsome, childless couple married for 44 years and living an idyllic life in her parents' comfortable country home in rural Ontario. Suffering from increasing memory lapses, Fiona is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and recognizes the need to enter an assisted living facility, Meadowlake.However, instead of focusing solely on the erosion of Fiona's memory, the unsentimental film looks at Grant's hard-pressed response to her debilitating condition, which is made all the more heartbreaking by Meadowlake's strict policy of not allowing him to visit Fiona during the first thirty days of her stay. Moreover, Fiona's memory appears to deteriorate in a most unpredictable manner as long dormant feelings of anger and resentment come to the surface over Grant's past indiscretions with his female students. This added emotional complexity makes it even more difficult for Grant to accept how Fiona, now completely robbed of her memories, has now bonded with Aubrey, a wheelchair-bound stroke victim whose wife Marian routinely leaves him there during the day. Another unexpected bonding occurs between Grant and Marian, who find themselves in similarly isolated situations.Casting the luminous Julie Christie, still achingly beautiful at 65, as Fiona is Polley's masterstroke here. Christie - whose own illustrious career goes back to vivid images of her beauty and conviction inDarling,Far from the Madding Crowd, and most memorably, as the elusive Lara inDoctor Zhivago- gives so much unobtrusive dimension to her moving performance that I didn't realize how much I've missed seeing the full bloom of her talent work onscreen. It is also a tribute to the delicacy of her work that she does not overshadow veteran Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent, who plays the mostly taciturn Grant with a subtle force that beckons his determined resistance to allow his wife to go gentle into that good night. Two other performances are compelling - Olympia Dukakis, who brings her trademark no-nonsense manner to Marian and then reveals her vulnerability in halting measure, and Kristen Thomson, who makes the smiling nurse Kristy a hard-earned voice of reason with an unexpected edge.Michael Murphy has little to do as Aubrey except react mutely to the drama around him, and Wendy Crewson presents that familiar arm's-length crispness to Meadowlake's chief administrator. Fully capturing the snowy beauty of the area, especially in the cross-country skiing sequences, Luc Montpellier's cinematography is especially noteworthy here.  Polley takes no easy avenues in telling the story she has adapted with precision from Alice Munro's powerfully affecting short story, ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain"" (from her excellent short story compilation,Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage). Amazingly avoiding any confusion, she intriguingly adjusts the narrative by having characters go back and forth in time by hinging on the key turning points in the plot. As a whole, the film represents a truly masterful debut.The 2007 DVD features a commentary track from Christie. With no one else with whom to converse, especially a conspicuously absent Polley, she sounds engaged in the first half-hour and then drifts in and out thereafter. She can be quite illuminating, but most of her comments are rather general in nature. It would have been nice if Polley could have probed further into some of the actress' observations. Polley, however, is present, on the commentary of five minor deleted scenes. There is also a celebrity-filled PSA for for the Alzheimer's Association.",5,Astounding Filmmaking Debut for Polley Spotlights a Luminous Christie in a Moving Study of Loss,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,4173,"['28', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'already', 'prodigious', 'career', 'exploring', 'characters', 'searing', 'intelligence', 'psychological', 'depth', 'Guinevere', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'addition', 'director', 'writer', 'resume', 'film', 'most', 'unexpected', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'keen', 'perspective', 'subtle', 'changes', 'relationships', 'have', 'endured', 'decades', '2007', 'film', 'compelling', 'character-driven', 'study', 'people', 'well', 'sixty', 'dealing', 'loss', 'various', 'forms', 'chief', 'focus', 'Grant', 'retired', 'English', 'professor', 'wife', 'Fiona', 'handsome', 'childless', 'couple', 'married', '44', 'years', 'living', 'idyllic', 'life', 'parents', 'comfortable', 'country', 'home', 'rural', 'Ontario', 'Suffering', 'increasing', 'memory', 'lapses', 'Fiona', 'diagnosed', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'need', 'enter', 'assisted', 'living', 'facility', 'Meadowlake.However', 'instead', 'focusing', 'solely', 'erosion', 'Fiona', 'memory', 'unsentimental', 'film', 'looks', 'Grant', 'hard-pressed', 'response', 'debilitating', 'condition', 'made', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'Meadowlake', 'strict', 'policy', 'not', 'allowing', 'visit', 'Fiona', 'first', 'thirty', 'days', 'stay', 'Moreover', 'Fiona', 'memory', 'deteriorate', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'manner', 'long', 'dormant', 'feelings', 'anger', 'resentment', 'come', 'surface', 'Grant', 'past', 'indiscretions', 'female', 'students', 'added', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'Grant', 'accept', 'how', 'Fiona', 'now', 'completely', 'robbed', 'memories', 'now', 'bonded', 'Aubrey', 'wheelchair-bound', 'stroke', 'victim', 'wife', 'Marian', 'routinely', 'day', 'unexpected', 'bonding', 'Grant', 'Marian', 'who', 'find', 'similarly', 'isolated', 'situations.Casting', 'luminous', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'still', 'achingly', 'beautiful', '65', 'Fiona', 'Polley', 'masterstroke', 'here', 'Christie', 'own', 'illustrious', 'career', 'back', 'vivid', 'images', 'beauty', 'conviction', 'inDarling', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'most', 'memorably', 'elusive', 'Lara', 'inDoctor', 'Zhivago-', 'so', 'much', 'unobtrusive', 'dimension', 'moving', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'seeing', 'full', 'bloom', 'talent', 'work', 'onscreen', 'also', 'tribute', 'delicacy', 'work', 'not', 'overshadow', 'veteran', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'who', 'mostly', 'taciturn', 'Grant', 'subtle', 'force', 'determined', 'resistance', 'allow', 'wife', 'go', 'gentle', 'good', 'night', 'Two', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'compelling', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'who', 'trademark', 'no-nonsense', 'manner', 'Marian', 'then', 'vulnerability', 'halting', 'measure', 'Kristen', 'Thomson', 'who', 'smiling', 'nurse', 'Kristy', 'hard-earned', 'voice', 'reason', 'unexpected', 'edge.Michael', 'Murphy', 'little', 'do', 'Aubrey', 'react', 'mutely', 'drama', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'familiar', ""arm's-length"", 'crispness', 'Meadowlake', 'chief', 'administrator', 'Fully', 'capturing', 'snowy', 'beauty', 'area', 'especially', 'cross-country', 'skiing', 'sequences', 'Luc', 'Montpellier', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'here', 'Polley', 'easy', 'avenues', 'telling', 'story', 'adapted', 'precision', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'powerfully', 'affecting', 'short', 'story', 'Bear', 'Came', 'Mountain', 'excellent', 'short', 'story', 'compilation', 'Hateship', 'Friendship', 'Courtship', 'Loveship', 'Marriage', 'Amazingly', 'avoiding', 'confusion', 'intriguingly', 'narrative', 'having', 'characters', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'hinging', 'key', 'turning', 'points', 'plot', 'whole', 'film', 'truly', 'masterful', 'debut.The', '2007', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'Christie', 'one', 'else', 'whom', 'converse', 'especially', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'Polley', 'engaged', 'first', 'half-hour', 'then', 'drifts', 'thereafter', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'illuminating', 'most', 'comments', 'are', 'rather', 'general', 'nature', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Polley', 'could', 'have', 'probed', 'further', 'actress', 'observations', 'Polley', 'however', 'present', 'commentary', 'five', 'minor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'celebrity-filled', 'PSA', 'Alzheimer', 'Association']",N/A
1083875,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B000RQDMWA,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[8, 9]","It's my feeling that Sarah Polley's Away From Her, starring Julie Christie, based on a short story by Alice Munro, can be viewed as a triumph for Polley fans, for Christie fans, or for Munro fans, based on which one you prefer to be a fan of.  It's the story of Fiona Andersen (Christie) and her husband Grant (Gordon Pinsent) facing Fiona's unexpectedly young case of alzheimer's, but that description makes it sound like a made-for-tv ""brave sick woman"" movie.  Away From Her, to me, a fan of all three of those women, a Munro triumph most of all, proof that such an adaptation is possible and interesting.  Munro gains momentum from scenes that quietly sneak in their details and revel in how unconsciously human they are.  An early scene in which Fiona forgets how to pronounce the word ""wine"" is heartbreaking, but it's also much more than that - it's an indication of her unraveling social decorum.  Fiona as a character is much like her hair - large, specifically coiffed, and somewhere on the line of lovely and ridiculous.  Grant observes, as Fiona becomes worse and makes a surprising connection with another patient in her treatment facility, that Fiona may not be sick at all, that it may simply be the latest expression of who she is.  That detail and thought is pure Munro, and, having not read ""The Bear Came Over The Mountain,"" on which Away From Her is based, I love that the details feel pure to the story - a later, more debilitated Fiona has a simple comment about her house, which she may or may not recognize anymore, and it too is a moment of purity and disquieting ambiguity, and it happens simply by letting Fiona walk around a little.  That is where Polley and Christie - and, just as much, Pinsent - have their equal triumphs.  This is a wise story about human behavior and long-term love, nailed home by a beautiful set of lead performances and sensitive directions.  Its kept from perfection, I think, from being so small scale, and being a little long about it, but it is, however it got there, dead on in its portrayal of a personality slowly draining away.",4,"""I should be so lucky""",1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,2088,"['feeling', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Away', 'Her', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'triumph', 'Polley', 'fans', 'Christie', 'fans', 'Munro', 'fans', 'based', 'one', 'prefer', 'be', 'fan', 'story', 'Fiona', 'Andersen', 'Christie', 'husband', 'Grant', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'facing', 'Fiona', 'unexpectedly', 'young', 'case', 'alzheimer', 'description', 'made-for-tv', 'brave', 'sick', 'woman', 'movie', 'Away', 'Her', 'fan', 'three', 'women', 'Munro', 'triumph', 'most', 'proof', 'adaptation', 'possible', 'interesting', 'Munro', 'gains', 'momentum', 'scenes', 'quietly', 'sneak', 'details', 'revel', 'how', 'unconsciously', 'human', 'are', 'early', 'scene', 'Fiona', 'how', 'pronounce', 'word', 'wine', 'heartbreaking', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'indication', 'unraveling', 'social', 'decorum', 'Fiona', 'character', 'much', 'hair', 'large', 'specifically', 'coiffed', 'somewhere', 'line', 'lovely', 'ridiculous', 'Grant', 'Fiona', 'worse', 'surprising', 'connection', 'patient', 'treatment', 'facility', 'Fiona', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sick', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'latest', 'expression', 'who', 'detail', 'thought', 'pure', 'Munro', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'Bear', 'Came', 'Mountain', 'Away', 'Her', 'based', 'love', 'details', 'feel', 'pure', 'story', 'later', 'more', 'debilitated', 'Fiona', 'simple', 'comment', 'house', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'anymore', 'too', 'moment', 'purity', 'disquieting', 'ambiguity', 'simply', 'letting', 'Fiona', 'walk', 'little', 'where', 'Polley', 'Christie', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Pinsent', 'have', 'equal', 'triumphs', 'wise', 'story', 'human', 'behavior', 'long-term', 'love', 'nailed', 'home', 'beautiful', 'set', 'lead', 'performances', 'sensitive', 'directions', 'kept', 'perfection', 'think', 'being', 'so', 'small', 'scale', 'being', 'little', 'long', 'however', 'got', 'there', 'dead', 'portrayal', 'personality', 'slowly', 'draining', 'away']",N/A

1083879,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000RQDMWA,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[137, 145]","27 year old Sarah Polley made her directorial debut for a feature film with this movie. She had previously directed four short films, and a TV episode. Most of her past notoriety was for being a fine actress, having already appeared in more than 50 films since 1985. She was 9 years old when she did Terry Gilliam's ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (1988). She spent several years as a child star on the television series ROAD TO AVONLEA. She appeared in THE SWEET HEREAFTER, GUINEVERE, and in THE CLAIM (2000). Recently I enjoyed her work with Sam Shepard in Wim Wender's DON'T COME KNOCKING (2005).Polley's mother died when she was 11 years old. She considers actress Julie Christie to be her ""surrogate mother"". She worked with her twice before in NO SUCH THING (2000), and LIFE OF WORDS (2005). Originally Polley wanted to do a feature film about a 12 year old girl who finds herself being the star of a TV series, something she knows a little about -but there was no financial interest. Then she went with adapting a short story she liked by Alice Munro, THE BEAR CAME OVER THE MOUNTAIN. She wrote the screenplay with Julie Christie specifically in mind to play Fiona.The film's plot revolves around a retired 60ish professor who lives a comfortable lifestyle with his gorgeous wife in a cabin his mother used to own. They are forced to face the harsh reality of the wife's impending cognitive decline secondary to Alzheimer's disease. While still coherent, Fiona (Julie Christie) convinces her husband, Grant (Gordon Pinsent) that it would be prudent to allow her to check herself into a special retirement home that specializes in Alzheimer's patients. Reluctantly, the husband agreed. The institution had a 30-day waiting period before the first family visit to allow new residents to ""settle in"". When Grant came for his first visit he found himself greeted with a blank stare. Fiona no longer seemed to recognize him. Worse still, she had become emotionally attached to another patient -Aubrey, a mute in a wheelchair.How far can love be stretched before it lapses into heartache? Yet the textures of this plot are turgid, and darker forces yet are at work. As a popular professor, Grant had had several affairs in the past with nubile female student admirers. It appeared that Fiona forgave him and stayed with him into their retirement -but had she? I am told, and have read that realistically Alzheimer's does not progress so aggressively in just 30 days. So was Fiona punishing Grant? Was she still capable of such a callous and shrewd machination? Perhaps.The dialogue crackles with Stoppard-like language -most of which it seems came directly out of the Munro manuscript. But young Sarah Polley did shed some important light on several salient issues, with the real tragedy of Alzheimer's being only the tip of the iceberg; things like the reality of physical love and sex amongst seniors, forgiveness -or lack of it after decades of matrimony, and the tedious toll of unresolved regrets. Julie Christie is still radiant, sexy, and beautiful in her 60's. She makes a lot out of Fiona -savoring a plum role. Gordon Pinsent, a Canadian veteran of more than 100 films, is wonderful as Grant, showering us with his compassion, his nobility, and the unsavory aspects of his complex personality. Olympia Dukakis was perky, pessimistic, and a chain smoker as Aubrey's wife Marion -becoming Grant's new ""girlfriend"" in an odd plot twist. Michael Murphy did a lot through his eyes at the mute Aubrey. Kristin Thomson stole every scene she appeared in as Nurse Kristy.This thoughtful little film challenges our preconceived notions about older adults. Although it does not pack the dramatic punch of a film like IRIS (2000) with Judi Dench, it sweeps us onto fresh plateaus of consideration, and it creates a lot for us to ponder.",4,Winged Cognition,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,3834,"['27', 'year', 'old', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'movie', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'four', 'short', 'films', 'TV', 'episode', 'Most', 'past', 'notoriety', 'was', 'being', 'fine', 'actress', 'having', 'already', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', '1985', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'did', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'BARON', 'MUNCHAUSEN', '1988', 'spent', 'several', 'years', 'child', 'star', 'television', 'series', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'AVONLEA', 'appeared', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', 'GUINEVERE', 'THE', 'CLAIM', '2000', 'Recently', 'enjoyed', 'work', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Wim', 'Wender', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'COME', 'KNOCKING', '2005', '.Polley', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'actress', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'be', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'worked', 'twice', 'NO', 'SUCH', 'THING', '2000', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WORDS', '2005', 'Originally', 'Polley', 'wanted', 'do', 'feature', 'film', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'star', 'TV', 'series', 'something', 'little', '-but', 'was', 'financial', 'interest', 'Then', 'went', 'adapting', 'short', 'story', 'liked', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'THE', 'BEAR', 'CAME', 'OVER', 'THE', 'MOUNTAIN', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'specifically', 'mind', 'play', 'Fiona.The', 'film', 'plot', 'around', 'retired', '60ish', 'professor', 'who', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'cabin', 'mother', 'used', 'own', 'are', 'forced', 'face', 'harsh', 'reality', 'wife', 'impending', 'cognitive', 'decline', 'secondary', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'still', 'coherent', 'Fiona', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'husband', 'Grant', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'would', 'be', 'prudent', 'allow', 'check', 'special', 'retirement', 'home', 'Alzheimer', 'patients', 'Reluctantly', 'husband', 'agreed', 'institution', 'had', '30-day', 'waiting', 'period', 'first', 'family', 'visit', 'allow', 'new', 'residents', 'settle', 'When', 'Grant', 'came', 'first', 'visit', 'found', 'greeted', 'blank', 'stare', 'Fiona', 'no', 'longer', 'seemed', 'recognize', 'Worse', 'still', 'had', 'become', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'patient', '-Aubrey', 'mute', 'wheelchair.How', 'far', 'can', 'love', 'be', 'stretched', 'heartache', 'textures', 'plot', 'are', 'turgid', 'darker', 'forces', 'yet', 'are', 'work', 'popular', 'professor', 'Grant', 'had', 'had', 'several', 'affairs', 'past', 'nubile', 'female', 'student', 'admirers', 'appeared', 'Fiona', 'forgave', 'stayed', 'retirement', '-but', 'had', 'am', 'told', 'have', 'read', 'realistically', 'Alzheimer', 'not', 'progress', 'so', 'aggressively', 'just', '30', 'days', 'So', 'was', 'Fiona', 'punishing', 'Grant', 'Was', 'still', 'capable', 'such', 'callous', 'shrewd', 'machination', 'Perhaps.The', 'dialogue', 'crackles', 'Stoppard-like', 'language', '-most', 'came', 'directly', 'Munro', 'manuscript', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'did', 'shed', 'important', 'light', 'several', 'salient', 'issues', 'real', 'tragedy', 'Alzheimer', 'being', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'things', 'reality', 'physical', 'love', 'sex', 'amongst', 'seniors', 'forgiveness', '-or', 'lack', 'decades', 'matrimony', 'tedious', 'toll', 'unresolved', 'regrets', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'still', 'radiant', 'sexy', 'beautiful', '60', 'lot', 'Fiona', '-savoring', 'plum', 'role', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'Canadian', 'veteran', 'more', '100', 'films', 'wonderful', 'Grant', 'showering', 'compassion', 'nobility', 'unsavory', 'aspects', 'complex', 'personality', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'was', 'perky', 'pessimistic', 'chain', 'smoker', 'Aubrey', 'wife', 'Marion', '-becoming', 'Grant', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'odd', 'plot', 'twist', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'did', 'lot', 'eyes', 'mute', 'Aubrey', 'Kristin', 'Thomson', 'stole', 'scene', 'appeared', 'Nurse', 'Kristy.This', 'thoughtful', 'little', 'film', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'older', 'adults', 'not', 'pack', 'dramatic', 'punch', 'film', 'IRIS', '2000', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'fresh', 'plateaus', 'consideration', 'lot', 'ponder']",N/A

1083881,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000RQDMWA,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","AWAY FROM HER is a remarkable film from Canada for many reasons: the subject matter is tough but handled with sincerity and candor, the story from a short story by Alice Munro has been beautifully adapted for the screen by young and gifted director Sarah Polley, and the cast is homogeneously excellent - topped by shining Oscar worthy performances by Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent. Polley has elected to share this tale of descent into Alzheimer's Disease and it effect on all manner of people by taking a subtle fragmentary approach to revealing the story and character development and in doing so she gives a feeling of how the world slowly loses its sense as the brain bumps around in deepening chaos.The setting is Ontario, Canada where a couple has lived in a family home for the past twenty years of their 44-year marriage. Fiona (Julie Christie) remains a lovely woman but her memory is slipping and her husband Grant (Gordon Pinsent) adjusts to her diminished ability to cope with compassion and love. Through flashbacks and little moments in the present, the encroaching effects of Alzheimer's Disease become more prominent and together the couple arrives at the decision that placement in Meadowlands, a home of Alzheimer's victims, is necessary. An obligatory separation of 30 days 'while patients settle in' is followed by Gordon's visiting Fiona, only to discover that she doesn't recognize him and has transferred her affection to a mute wheelchair-confined Aubrey (Michael Murphy). Trying to understand this change Gordon visits Aubrey's wife Marian (Olympia Dukakis) and despite the devotion each has for their spouses, they seek some sense of security and rekindled meaning to life by dating. 'It's a strange world' they continue to sigh, struggling to adapt to the life into which they have been thrown.The cast is brilliant: not only does Julie Christy deliver a carefully studied, nuanced, informed portrayal of the Fiona at odds with diminishing brain activity and Gordon Pinsent matching her with a man torn by the throes of their misfortune, but the smaller roles by Dukakis and especially by Kristen Thomson as the worldly wise and kind nurse Kristy are so well defined they astonish us. The isolation of the story is captured in the snows of Ontario by cinematographer Luc Montpellier and Composer Jonathan Goldsmith has fashioned a musical score that relies inventively and subtly on Bach. Sarah Polley may be young in experience as a director and writer, but if the brilliant AWAY FROM HER is any indication of her talent, we are in for a series of significant films. Highly Recommended.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[6, 7]","Based on a short story by Alice Munro, ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain,"" AWAY FROM HER, directed by Sarah Polley, will break your heart. Fiona, in her early 60's develops Alzheimer's and makes the decision, when the time comes, that she will enter a nursing home. The plot is straight forward and all too familiar to those of us who have dealt with this insidious, unforgiving disease. When Fiona enters the nursing facility, she becomes more distant to her husband Grant (Gordon Pinsent) and develops a crush on another patient Aubrey, who is married to Marian (Olympia Dukasis). Fiona becomes every person with Alzheimer's: the putting of the skillet in the refrigerator, the covering up of memory loss, (""I'm not adept at names"") remembering things in the distant past, (on the way to the nursing home, Fiona reminds Granta of his affairs with women students twenty years previously) the remembering of things one minute and forgetting them the next, the gradual deteriorating of both mind and body.Both Pinsent and Dukasis give fine performances. (She as Marian has her own problems which are mostly financial. She cannot leave Aubrey in the home or she will lose their house, their only asset.) But Christie is magnificent as Fiona-- and looks the way a woman who was otherworldly beautiful at 20 would look at 66, still beautiful in old age. Much of the action is set in snowy Canadian winters and there are shots of Christie that remind us of Laura in DOCTOR ZHIVAGO.For all its bleakness-- and there is plenty of that, particularly the scenes in the nursing home where some patients just sit, others shout, and the female staff with their forced cheerfulness, many of whom wear those awful flowered tops and ugly pastel pants-- the movie is also about the power of love and staying together for the duration. There is a beautiful passage when Fiona reminds Grant that he had nothing to hold him to her in the marriage, that he could have left but he didn't. She loves him for that and thanks him.We should thank our neighbors to the north for this thoughtful film.",5,The Incomparable Julie Christie Moves Us Again,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,2073,"['Based', 'short', 'story', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'Bear', 'Came', 'Mountain', 'AWAY', 'FROM', 'HER', 'directed', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'Fiona', 'early', '60', 'develops', 'Alzheimer', 'decision', 'when', 'time', 'will', 'enter', 'nursing', 'home', 'plot', 'straight', 'forward', 'too', 'familiar', 'who', 'have', 'dealt', 'insidious', 'unforgiving', 'disease', 'When', 'Fiona', 'nursing', 'facility', 'more', 'distant', 'husband', 'Grant', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'crush', 'patient', 'Aubrey', 'who', 'married', 'Marian', 'Olympia', 'Dukasis', 'Fiona', 'person', 'Alzheimer', 'putting', 'skillet', 'refrigerator', 'covering', 'memory', 'loss', ""'m"", 'not', 'adept', 'names', 'remembering', 'things', 'distant', 'past', 'way', 'nursing', 'home', 'Fiona', 'Granta', 'affairs', 'women', 'students', 'twenty', 'years', 'previously', 'remembering', 'things', 'one', 'minute', 'forgetting', 'next', 'gradual', 'deteriorating', 'mind', 'Pinsent', 'Dukasis', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'Marian', 'own', 'problems', 'are', 'mostly', 'financial', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'Aubrey', 'home', 'will', 'lose', 'house', 'only', 'asset', 'Christie', 'magnificent', 'Fiona', 'way', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'otherworldly', 'beautiful', '20', 'would', 'look', '66', 'still', 'beautiful', 'old', 'age', 'Much', 'action', 'set', 'snowy', 'Canadian', 'winters', 'are', 'shots', 'Christie', 'remind', 'Laura', 'DOCTOR', 'ZHIVAGO.For', 'bleakness', 'plenty', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'nursing', 'home', 'where', 'patients', 'just', 'sit', 'others', 'shout', 'female', 'staff', 'forced', 'cheerfulness', 'many', 'whom', 'wear', 'awful', 'flowered', 'tops', 'ugly', 'pastel', 'pants', 'movie', 'also', 'power', 'love', 'staying', 'together', 'duration', 'beautiful', 'passage', 'when', 'Fiona', 'Grant', 'had', 'nothing', 'hold', 'marriage', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'did', ""n't"", 'thanks', 'him.We', 'should', 'thank', 'neighbors', 'north', 'thoughtful', 'film']",N/A

Sarah Polley directs actors who could easily be her parents with a sure, but light touch.  They are pros; let them run.  She does and in doing so brings sensitivity, wit, sympathy and grace to their layered lives.  Julie Christie -- what can you say?  More than 40 years after Dr. Zhivago she is still beautiful and still walks away with a movie, which is to take nothing away from her three co-stars.  The only caveat on this movie for me is that it feels a bit stretched, especially in the several cross-country skiing scenes.But I think the greatest credit for this absorbing movie about final gifts in an enduring, loving, but not trouble-free marriage belongs to Alice Munro, who wrote the short story -- The Bear Came Over the Mountain -- on which it is based.  Munro mines the complexities of the everyday better than any other writer I know.  She writes, mostly, of adults and for adults.

Could that be a truth of her long term memory,is she delusional,or is Fiona secretly lying? Grant even seeks out Aubrey's wife,Marian,(an ever saucy Olympia Dukakis), about this,but she is unable to confirm anything as she states ""I did not grow up here.""

The success of this chronicle of a long-lived marriage threatened by the descent into dementia of the wife is not only due to the literate script, but to a pair of remarkable performances: that of the ageless Julie Christie as Fiona, the wife, and of Gordon Pinsent as her husband Grant. Christie conveys Fiona's calm self-awareness in the face of her early symptoms with grace and touches of gallows humor (""I seem to be disappearing,"" she remarks at one point). Later, her increasing withdrawal from reality after her husband is compelled to institutionalize her is painful to watch. Pinsent, whose long career has been mainly as a journeyman character actor, is perhaps less immediately striking but no less compelling as the husband. Grant is forced to witness, first, his beautiful, elegant wife's gradual loss of her grip on reality; second, her strange attachment to a fellow patient, Aubrey, in the care center where they both are placed. In a kind of jealous despair he embarks on a relationship with Aubrey's embittered wife (the reliable Olympia Dukakis). ""Away from Her"" catches to perfection the waste and indignity not only of the  disease itself, but the milieu into which its sufferers are forced. Ultimately, though, the film is not about Alzheimer's; it is about the love between two people that endures their human flaws, and that binds them as they face an unimagined and unimaginable end to their journey together.

1083897,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000RQDMWA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[16, 19]","I do not remember if the word ""Alzheimers"" is even mentioned in ""Away from Her,"" although its utterance is not necessary to understand what is happening with Fiona (Julie Christie).  When she put the frying pan in the freezer, where it is dutifully retrieved by her husband, Grant (Gordon Pinsent), we know the situation, even without seeing the PSA for fighting the dastardly diseases that plays at the start of this DVD. Fiona has taken to wandering away, unable to find her way back home, and Grant cannot watch her every minute.  Since that is the sort of attention she needs as the disease progresses (captured in a painful moment at a dinner party where Fiona struggles to remember what is in the bottle she holds in her hand), Grant must find a home in which to place his wife of nearly 50 years.  He chooses Meadowlake.When Grant brings Fiona to Meadowlake the first of two flaws that affect my response to ""Away from Her"" moves the story forward.  Meadowlake has a policy that new residents cannot have neither visitors nor phone calls during the first 30-days of their stay.  Now, I fully understand why such a policy makes sense if you are dealing with somebody sent to prison or checking into a rehab clinic, but at a home for the elderly that pays attention to people suffering from Alzheimer's?  It would be hard to come up with something crueler.  Your mind is starting to betray you and you move away from the home you have known for decades into a strange new place, and you cannot see your family and friends?  No wonder when Grant arrives a month later his beloved wife thinks that he is just a new resident of the home.This ""policy"" is ultimately a plot contrivance to arrive at just this situation, with the added insult to injury that Fiona has apparently transferred her affections to Aubrey (Michael Murphy), another one of the residents at Meadowlake.  Aubrey is mute and has trouble getting around, but Fiona is constantly attentive to his every need.  Clearly taking care of him makes her happy, but we cannot help but see the irony that Aubrey no more acknowledges Fiona that she acknowledges Grant on what are becoming daily visits.  For Grant the situation is unacceptable, but with Fiona's condition there does not seem to be anything that he can do about it, and that is what serves as the film's ultimate conflict.This 2006 Canadian film is based on Alice Munro's short story, ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain.""  It is faithfully adapted to the screen by Sarah Polley in the actress' first feature film as director.  Polley has assembled a solid cast to tell this tale.  Christie is still radiant, and any attempt to make her look haggard can never fully succeed once you see her eyes.  Pinsent brings a sense of restraint to both his pain and his resolve in dealing with this cruel twist of fate that life has dealt him (one of my favorite scenes takes place between Grant and a teenager forced to come visit somebody at the home by her family).  In contrast, Olympia Dukakis as Marian brings a harsh dose of reality to both Grant and the story.  Despite the stupid policy that creates the film's tragic situation, Meadowlake is a fine place for Fiona to be, personified by Kristy (Kristen Thomson), one of those angels that you pray would be taking care of your loved one.The performances perfectly match the delicate situation, but for me there is a second flaw in this film in what happens between Grant and Marian.  That is because it takes away some of the grace from the film's moving final scene and changes Grant's motivation from what I would want it to be into something much less noble.  At one point I was thinking that it would be better if Marian did not have the specific relationship she has to another character in this story, but without that reason Grant would never have cause to seek her out (certainly he would not meet her by happenstance).

1083898,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000RQDMWA,Lee Armstrong,"[8, 9]","""Away From Her"" is a very good film about the very difficult subject of Alzheimer's.  It reminded me of the filmIrisfor which Judi Dench was nominated for an Oscar and won the British Academy Award.  Director Sarah Polley adapted this film from Alice Munroe's short story.  She has been nominated for the Oscar for ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" and won for her screenplay from the San Francisco Film Circle.  Polley won the ""New Generation Award"" from the Los Angeles Film Critics, ""Best First Film"" from the New York Film Circle and ""Breakthrough Film Artist"" from Ohio Film Critics.  The film is cerebral, showing us the deterioration of Fiona's mind and the incredibly difficult role as her husband Grant must watch the woman he loves deteriorate.The performances are outstanding.  Gordon Pinsent who plays the husband Grant won two Genie Awards, Canada's highest acting awards, as Best Supporting Actor in ""Klondike"" in 1980 and as Best Actor in ""John & the Missus"" in 1987.  His performance is subtle, controlled, but amazingly deep as the woman he loves slips away from him.Julie Christie is nominated for an Oscar, which as I write will soon be awarded & the British Academy Award.  Christie's Oscar was for ""Darling"" in 1965.  She's been in many excellent films like ""Doctor Zhivago,"" ""Shampoo"" &Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition).  As Fiona, she plays the various levels of her illness with amazing wit, showing glimpses of the undoubtedly brilliant woman that captured Grant's heart.  She has won best acting honors for her performance from film critics circles in Dallas/Ft. Worth, New York, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Toronto, Washington D.C. as well as the Screen Actors Guild & the National Board of Review.Olympia Dukakis who won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Moonstruck"" in 1987 plays Marian.  Marian is married to Aubrey.  As the memories from Alzheimer's fade, new friendships and attachments develop.  Both Marian and Grant watch as their husband and wife carry on as if they were a couple, not connected to the life that was before.  Michael Murphy has had a long acting career that spans films from ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" to ""Smokin' Aces.""  He is amazingly powerful as the wordless Aubrey who pines over being pulled out of the nursing home where his new friend Fiona is.  Wendy Crewson, who played the mother inThe Covenantand is married to Michael Murphy, plays the administrator at the facility who tries to handle the many difficult feelings of the families with a smile and a firm hand.  Alberta Watson who became a favorite of mine in the TV show ""La Femme Nikita"" has a nice cameo as Dr. Fisher.  Kristen Thomson also does a nice job as Kristy.  Polley is generous to the supporting players, giving them variety to bring both the location and the nursing home to life.  While the film did seem to drag a bit for me, I think it is just because the subject is so emotionally difficult.  The film is very well done, well worth watching.  It was named ""Best Canadian Film"" by the Toronto Film Circle.

She is the reason that I gave this movie 4 stars, when it really deserves 2 or 3. I felt sorry for her character, Fiona, and tried not to feel sorry for her husband, Grant. Yes, he's losing his wife and it's all so sad, but he wasn't the greatest husband, as you will find out.  He now looks devoted and is understandably jealous of Fiona's new friend in the nursing home, but maybe he understands how he made her feel in the earlier part of their marriage.  I don't care if the Alzheimer's was real or if she was truly punishing him - either way, he needed to be punished.This is a very quiet movie. The nursing home director seemed to be the loudest part - she was condescending and annoying.Some scenes at the end, particularly those of Grant with Olympia Dukakis' character, did not fit and made a stronger case against Grant's loyalty to Fiona. (In fact, he is the disloyal type that never grows out of his selfishness.)  If not for those scenes, I could have felt a little sorry for him - yes, he was a bad husband in his younger years but he might have truly repented (though that doesn't make it right...I would have divorced him in a second if I'd been unfortunate enough to be married to him), he might have changed for the better, matured somehow. It looked as if he was trying to make up for the wrongs he committed against her throughout the years. However, it's all meaningless and FAKE when you see how he reverts to his old ways at the end.

Beautiful Julie Christie is the Alzheimer's victim, and her husband watches her deteriorate.  Just as sadly, she watches herself deteriorate.As she does, she insists on checking in to an Alzheimer's facility, leaving her husband, who is asking her to stay with him.The turning point of the movie is the first month in the facility.  They have a rule that there is to be no contact between patients and family for the first month of residence.  When that month is over and the husband visits his beloved wife, she is already in love with another man and pays scant attention to her husband, who she either doesn't recognize as her husband, or wishes to revenge herself on for his infidelities to her during their marriage.  Her motive is never explained.  It appears that she's innocent of a vengeful motive, sweet as she is, but her extreme deterioration in that one month doesn't seem right.I understood it to be that she is far more comfortable as the support giver for the other man than as the pathetic wife losing her mind.  With this other poor man, she comforts him, takes care of him, mothers him, gives him affection that he is desperate for.  She can have a positive self image and not feel so low.  She can be useful.  She can be a whole woman to this man, his mom, his beloved.There even seems to be some question as to whether Julie has sex with this man.  Probably not, I suppose, but that is left in the air.  There is a sudden departure.  The two of them are separated.  He is pulled out of the facility.  Later we hear that his wife couldn't afford to leave him there.  That same wife is anxious to start an affair with Julie Christie's husband, and they consummate it.Julie Christie's husband finds himself in the position of wanting to bring his rival back to be with his beloved wife, just to stem the tide of her apathy and deterioration.  He drives the other man back to visit his beloved wife.  Then the movie gets one final zinger in.  Julie recognizes her husband, for the first time in ages, and hugs him.  We realize that it is not going to last.  She'll forget him soon enough.

Quido ""quidrock""","[15, 18]","There is little likelihood that more than 9 movies will be as well made, or as moving a film experience in 2007 than ""Away From Her"". Thus, it already makes my top 10. Do whatever you have to do to find it and see it.It is perhaps easier with short stories, and almost a virtual certainty if you retain the novelist as screenwriter. With the short story format, not chosen by many any more, going to the screen means the author can build on the story, feature nuances from the novel as scenes on the film, build character. No ripping apart and leaving on the film floor, you get to add to your own work.Those are the choices made by first time Director Sarah Polley in her film from 2006 (released in the US in 2007) - ""Away from Her"" . Polley is a fine Canadian film actress noted for her independent choices (and political agenda) who had just finished filming ""No Such Thing"" with the sublime Julie Christie in a character role, in 2001. Polley was returning to North America from a Iceland, where the film was made, when she read ""The Bear Went Over the Mountain"" from one of Alice Munro's collections of short stories, 2001's ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage: Stories"". She embarked on a path to make this film, doggedly determined to feature Christie in the lead role. And, she succeeded in a way that she must be immensely proud of.This particular story of the impact of Alzheimer's on a family has always struck a chord with me. Munro is truly one of our great contemporary writers, and although I didn't favor this collection (my favorite Munro collections are ""Runaway"" and ""Dance of the Happy Shades""), when I watched the film ""The Notebook"", a tale of coping with Alzheimer's in a marriage, I returned to this subliminal story and fell in love with it all over again. I didn't know about Polley's project to bring it to the screen until I read some scraps of a movie reviewer's piece last year, relishing the thought of Julie Christie returning to a leading actress role.In ""Away From Her"", a couple (Christie as Fiona and Gordon Pinsent, for over 70 years a fine Canadian talent) confront the emotional as well as physical ravages of Alzheimer's, as they must part in order for her to obtain care in a nursing home. Filmed beautifully, Polley never lets the movie drag, as sad movies with determined endings often do. Polley evokes the strangeness of the situation in the facial expressions of the lovely Fiona. There is an invisible force of the disease present in almost every scene, in her manner, her face, her actions.If the buzz surrounding ""Away from Her"" strengthens, if it moves from art houses to the big screen, as it did in my city, if American film-goers continue to try to find the best, not just the biggest films at their 20+ plexes, well ""Away from Her"" may result in a new career for Munro on the screen, an ability for Polley to command projects as a director and awards for Julie Christie's amazing performance. Indeed, the ensemble is truly all worth note.Not to be outdone, and with award possibilities all around, the finest individual performance, it can be argued, is Gordon Pinsent's. He is remarkable as Grant, a role that is perfect for his skills. Devastated, heart broken, and still a hero, Pinsent is worth his weight in gold.",5,"One of my ""top 10"" for 2007!",1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3290,"['little', 'likelihood', 'more', '9', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'moving', 'film', 'experience', '2007', 'Away', 'Thus', 'already', 'top', '10', 'Do', 'have', 'do', 'find', 'see', 'it.It', 'perhaps', 'easier', 'short', 'stories', 'almost', 'virtual', 'certainty', 'retain', 'novelist', 'screenwriter', 'short', 'story', 'format', 'not', 'chosen', 'many', 'more', 'going', 'screen', 'author', 'can', 'build', 'story', 'feature', 'nuances', 'novel', 'scenes', 'film', 'build', 'character', 'No', 'ripping', 'apart', 'leaving', 'film', 'floor', 'get', 'add', 'own', 'work.Those', 'are', 'choices', 'made', 'first', 'time', 'Director', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'film', '2006', 'released', 'US', '2007', 'Away', 'Polley', 'fine', 'Canadian', 'film', 'actress', 'noted', 'independent', 'choices', 'political', 'agenda', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'filming', 'Such', 'Thing', 'sublime', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'character', 'role', '2001', 'Polley', 'was', 'returning', 'North', 'America', 'Iceland', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'read', 'Bear', 'Went', 'Mountain', 'one', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'collections', 'short', 'stories', '2001', 'Hateship', 'Friendship', 'Courtship', 'Loveship', 'Marriage', 'Stories', 'embarked', 'path', 'make', 'film', 'doggedly', 'determined', 'feature', 'Christie', 'lead', 'role', 'succeeded', 'way', 'must', 'be', 'immensely', 'proud', 'particular', 'story', 'impact', 'Alzheimer', 'family', 'always', 'struck', 'chord', 'Munro', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'contemporary', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'favor', 'collection', 'favorite', 'Munro', 'collections', 'are', 'Runaway', 'Dance', 'Happy', 'Shades', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'Notebook', 'tale', 'coping', 'Alzheimer', 'marriage', 'returned', 'subliminal', 'story', 'fell', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Polley', 'project', 'bring', 'screen', 'read', 'scraps', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'piece', 'last', 'year', 'relishing', 'thought', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'returning', 'leading', 'actress', 'role.In', 'Away', 'Her', 'couple', 'Christie', 'Fiona', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', '70', 'years', 'fine', 'Canadian', 'talent', 'emotional', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'ravages', 'Alzheimer', 'must', 'part', 'order', 'obtain', 'care', 'nursing', 'home', 'Filmed', 'beautifully', 'Polley', 'never', 'movie', 'drag', 'sad', 'movies', 'determined', 'endings', 'often', 'do', 'Polley', 'strangeness', 'situation', 'facial', 'expressions', 'lovely', 'Fiona', 'invisible', 'force', 'disease', 'present', 'almost', 'scene', 'manner', 'face', 'actions.If', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'Away', 'strengthens', 'art', 'houses', 'big', 'screen', 'did', 'city', 'American', 'film-goers', 'continue', 'try', 'find', 'best', 'not', 'just', 'biggest', 'films', '20+', 'plexes', 'well', 'Away', 'may', 'result', 'new', 'career', 'Munro', 'screen', 'ability', 'Polley', 'command', 'projects', 'director', 'awards', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Indeed', 'ensemble', 'truly', 'worth', 'note.Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'award', 'possibilities', 'around', 'finest', 'individual', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'remarkable', 'Grant', 'role', 'perfect', 'skills', 'Devastated', 'heart', 'broken', 'still', 'hero', 'Pinsent', 'weight', 'gold']",N/A

It presents the decline of the wife to the point that she needs to go into an assisted living facility as we would call them in the US.  The wife slowly declines and finds her own life in the institution as the husband finds some life besides the wife.  But they do come together in their own way and in a their new life.The story is good as is but is missing the worry about finances (the US health system), doctors (everyone seems to be more of a social worker), and the light side of dementia.  I know when my father had dementia, he could very be very sweet and funny, utterly charming at times.  Other people can get belligerent.  Fighting about care is missing too.  I remember staff who poorly paid and not always caring.

At the wise old age of twenty-seven she has matured and made a skilled feature film debut.""Away From Her"" joins Fiona and Grant Anderson after fifty years of marriage.  Fiona, played by Julie Christie in a way that makes her character vulnerable, but desirable, is advancing into the mental greyness of Alzheimer's.  Grant, played by Canadian treasure Gordon Pinsent as a man who loves Fiona, but earned the lines on his face and carries regrets about some of the things in his past with Fiona.Fiona doesn't want Grant to see her progression into dementia, and she doesn't want to be a burden.  She decides to go to one of those places.  They're taken aback (as a viewer I was too) when they discover that the policy of the facility is for the new resident to not receive any family contact for a month.Fiona's condition seemed to be limited to forgetting ""little things"" prior to the admission.  When Grant returns she looks at him as if she were looking at a stranger on a subway she thought she knew long ago.Although their screen time seemed about even, I identified more with Grant, perhaps because of being a man myself, but I think even more because the further Fiona goes away, the less insight we have into her character.  Pinsent is absolutely superb in his part - his words are soothing and experienced, and we see the hurt in his face as he can see Fiona right in front of him, but realizes that the Fiona he knew and loved for decades is no longer there.  There is even a moment when we see Gordon wonders if Fiona is giving him a little extra cold shoulder because of a past wrong.Michael Murphy plays the mute Aubrey, another resident at the facility.  Fiona freely gives her attention to Aubrey while occasionally looking at Gordon as if he were a crossing guard.  Olympia Dukakis does her usual excellent work as Marian, Aubrey's husband, and it makes sense that Gordon and Marian should bond a little, although I always sensed that his friendship with Marian paled in comparison to his memories of his earlier life with Fiona.Kristen Thomson deserves mention for her role as a nurse at the facility.  Nurse Kristy cares for her patients, and she cares for the families and loved ones as well.  She knows about the inner turmoil that churns in the minds of the families, and she knows how the past colors the perceptions of the present.This is a wise movie, adapted from Alice Munro's short story.  Roger Ebert ends his review: ""Sarah Polley emerges here as a director who is in calm command of almost impossible material. The movie says as much for her strength of character as for her skills. Anyone who could read Munro's original story and think they could make a film of it, and then make a great film, deserves a certain awe.""",5,Away From Each Other,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2806,"['Sarah', 'Polley', 'was', 'exceptional', 'Canadian', 'child', 'actress', 'wise', 'old', 'age', 'twenty-seven', 'matured', 'made', 'skilled', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Away', 'Fiona', 'Grant', 'Anderson', 'fifty', 'years', 'marriage', 'Fiona', 'played', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'way', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'desirable', 'advancing', 'mental', 'greyness', 'Alzheimer', 'Grant', 'played', 'Canadian', 'treasure', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'man', 'who', 'Fiona', 'earned', 'lines', 'face', 'regrets', 'things', 'past', 'Fiona.Fiona', ""n't"", 'want', 'Grant', 'see', 'progression', 'dementia', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'burden', 'go', 'one', 'places', ""'re"", 'taken', 'aback', 'viewer', 'was', 'too', 'when', 'discover', 'policy', 'facility', 'new', 'resident', 'not', 'receive', 'family', 'contact', 'month.Fiona', 'condition', 'seemed', 'be', 'limited', 'forgetting', 'little', 'things', 'prior', 'admission', 'When', 'Grant', 'were', 'looking', 'stranger', 'subway', 'thought', 'knew', 'long', 'screen', 'time', 'seemed', 'about', 'even', 'identified', 'more', 'Grant', 'perhaps', 'being', 'man', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'further', 'Fiona', 'away', 'less', 'insight', 'have', 'character', 'Pinsent', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'part', 'words', 'are', 'soothing', 'experienced', 'see', 'hurt', 'face', 'can', 'see', 'Fiona', 'right', 'front', 'Fiona', 'knew', 'loved', 'decades', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'even', 'moment', 'when', 'see', 'Gordon', 'wonders', 'Fiona', 'giving', 'little', 'extra', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'past', 'wrong.Michael', 'Murphy', 'mute', 'Aubrey', 'resident', 'facility', 'Fiona', 'freely', 'attention', 'Aubrey', 'occasionally', 'looking', 'Gordon', 'were', 'crossing', 'guard', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'usual', 'excellent', 'work', 'Marian', 'Aubrey', 'husband', 'sense', 'Gordon', 'Marian', 'should', 'bond', 'little', 'always', 'sensed', 'friendship', 'Marian', 'paled', 'comparison', 'memories', 'earlier', 'life', 'Fiona.Kristen', 'Thomson', 'mention', 'role', 'nurse', 'facility', 'Nurse', 'Kristy', 'cares', 'patients', 'families', 'loved', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'minds', 'families', 'how', 'past', 'colors', 'perceptions', 'present.This', 'wise', 'movie', 'adapted', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'short', 'story', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'here', 'director', 'who', 'calm', 'command', 'almost', 'impossible', 'material', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'strength', 'character', 'skills', 'Anyone', 'who', 'could', 'read', 'Munro', 'original', 'story', 'think', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'then', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'certain', 'awe']",N/A
1083905,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000RQDMWA,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[25, 29]","Away From Her tells the moving, sad story of a woman who is slipping slowly but surely into Alzheimer's disease. The plot essentially involves her relationships with her husband of forty-four years and her moving away from him once she becomes a permanent resident in a nursing facility for people with Alzheimer's. The plot moves along at a good pace but many of the lines are not well written; look for the ward nurse to get many of the best lines in the movie! The acting was convincing; but the portrayal of the nursing facility looks so unrealistically pure and nurturing it appears copied out of a fairy tale book.First we meet an older married couple living in rural Canada: Grant and Fiona Anderson (Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie). Fiona is already slowly forgetting more and more; and when she begins wandering away and getting lost Fiona and Grant make the painful decision to move her, temporarily at least, into a nursing facility for persons with her disease. They try at times to deny that Fiona has Alzheimer's disease but their denial never works because the truth is becoming more and more painfully obvious.Unfortunately for Grant, Fiona checks into a facility that actually has the brutal policy that new residents cannot have phone calls or any visitors for the first thirty days. Wow--sounds like a wonderful place. Who would trust them with that? In addition, when Grant does return, in just one month his wife has almost completely forgotten who he is--and she has fallen in love with another resident, Aubrey (Michael Murphy). This pains Grant and it brings up issues for Grant of past infidelities that may never be ironed out with his wife because she is now too ill to deal with it properly in a conversation.Grant also meets Aubrey's wife Marion (Olympia Dukakis) and together they explore their feelings about their lives and how things ""didn't work out.""The plot can go anywhere from here. Will Fiona stay in the nursing facility or will she come home and let it be a temporary experience after all? How will Grant and Marion manage a potentially difficult relationship--after all, their ill spouses have forgotten them because of the illness and in the nursing home their spouses are in love. What about Grant's desire to iron out past infidelities with his wife Fiona--will it truly be too late for them to work it out and smooth over bad feelings hidden over so many years? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!The DVD has a director's commentary and there are a few deleted scenes.Too bad the extras didn't include the movie as it would have looked in real life. Another reviewer notes correctly that nursing facilities mean ringing the bell constantly for 40 minutes to get an overburdened attendant to change your parent's diaper. The nursing home is pictured with such purity you'd think they had to be joking--and it's a bad joke at that. None of the care facilities are ever that clean and they don't have staff who look so perfectly composed at all times. I know; I've been there with a very sick mother.Overall, Away From Her features a fine performance from actors who are burdened with an average script. The lines are best when Grant and Fiona interact; and the ward nurse gets some great lines, too. Watch this when you don't have kids around and there's nothing else to watch. If there IS something better to watch, leave this one for another day--and send condolence cards to the actors who got stuck with this script!",3,send condolence cards to the actors who were stuck with this script !!!,1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,3491,"['Away', 'Her', 'moving', 'sad', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'slipping', 'slowly', 'surely', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'plot', 'essentially', 'relationships', 'husband', 'forty-four', 'years', 'moving', 'away', 'once', 'permanent', 'resident', 'nursing', 'facility', 'people', 'Alzheimer', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'many', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'look', 'ward', 'nurse', 'get', 'many', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'nursing', 'facility', 'so', 'unrealistically', 'pure', 'nurturing', 'copied', 'fairy', 'tale', 'meet', 'older', 'married', 'couple', 'living', 'rural', 'Canada', 'Grant', 'Fiona', 'Anderson', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Fiona', 'already', 'slowly', 'forgetting', 'more', 'more', 'when', 'wandering', 'away', 'getting', 'lost', 'Fiona', 'Grant', 'make', 'painful', 'decision', 'move', 'temporarily', 'least', 'nursing', 'facility', 'persons', 'disease', 'try', 'times', 'deny', 'Fiona', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'denial', 'never', 'truth', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'painfully', 'obvious.Unfortunately', 'Grant', 'Fiona', 'facility', 'actually', 'brutal', 'policy', 'new', 'residents', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'phone', 'calls', 'visitors', 'first', 'thirty', 'days', 'Wow', 'wonderful', 'place', 'Who', 'would', 'trust', 'addition', 'when', 'Grant', 'return', 'just', 'one', 'month', 'wife', 'almost', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'resident', 'Aubrey', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'Grant', 'up', 'issues', 'Grant', 'past', 'infidelities', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'ironed', 'out', 'wife', 'now', 'too', 'ill', 'deal', 'properly', 'conversation.Grant', 'also', 'Aubrey', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'together', 'explore', 'feelings', 'lives', 'how', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'Will', 'Fiona', 'stay', 'nursing', 'facility', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'let', 'be', 'temporary', 'experience', 'How', 'will', 'Grant', 'Marion', 'manage', 'potentially', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'ill', 'spouses', 'have', 'forgotten', 'illness', 'nursing', 'home', 'spouses', 'are', 'love', 'What', 'Grant', 'desire', 'iron', 'out', 'past', 'infidelities', 'wife', 'Fiona', 'will', 'truly', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'work', 'out', 'smooth', 'bad', 'feelings', 'hidden', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'are', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes.Too', 'bad', 'extras', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'real', 'life', 'reviewer', 'correctly', 'nursing', 'facilities', 'mean', 'ringing', 'bell', 'constantly', '40', 'minutes', 'get', 'overburdened', 'attendant', 'change', 'parent', 'diaper', 'nursing', 'home', 'pictured', 'such', 'purity', ""'d"", 'think', 'had', 'be', 'joking', 'bad', 'joke', 'None', 'care', 'facilities', 'are', 'ever', 'clean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'staff', 'who', 'look', 'so', 'perfectly', 'composed', 'times', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'sick', 'mother.Overall', 'Away', 'features', 'fine', 'performance', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'burdened', 'average', 'script', 'lines', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'Grant', 'Fiona', 'interact', 'ward', 'nurse', 'great', 'lines', 'too', 'Watch', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'IS', 'something', 'better', 'watch', 'leave', 'one', 'day', 'send', 'condolence', 'cards', 'actors', 'who', 'got', 'stuck', 'script']",N/A

Fiona and Grant Anderson have been married 44 years when Fiona's (Julie Christie) Alzheimer's has advanced to the point that they consider a nursing home. Grant (Gordon Pinsent) is reluctant to part with his still-vital wife, but Fiona insists that it's best. Grant visits Fiona frequently but must cope with the pain and frustration as he slips from his wife's memory.It's not as dull as it sounds. This is Grant's story, and Gordon Pinsent's understated performance is sympathetic and unsentimental, Grant's wistfulness notwithstanding. Julie Christie is a radiant older woman, even if Fiona is losing her identity. Olympic Dukakis is wonderful as the acerbic, cynical wife of a another resident at the home, to whom Grant turns for assistance. The characters, the conversations, the frozen Canadian countryside are all terrific, though I felt there was more of them than necessary. The film runs a little long. But these 3 performances are truly noteworthy, and Sarah Polley's ability to communicate visually what happens internally is striking.The DVD (Lionsgate 2007): Bonus features are 5 deleted scenes and an audio commentary by actress Julie Christie.

Soon the scene cuts to Fiona (Julie Christie) skiing across a similar snowy background, and somewhere within these first two scenes, the first minute or so of film, I was sure that this film was going to be great.Fiona and Grant have been married for 44 years; it seems to be a happy marriage though there are signs right from the opening of the film that a serious problem has arisen: Fiona is starting to lose her memory. Alzheimers is suspected, but unspoken in the first several scenes. We see Fiona and Grant skiing, cooking, talking together; we see them with another couple; we see the lines of tragedy beginning to show on Grant's face much more starkly than on Fiona's. She is frustrated, but somehow less frustrated than Grant, who seems desperate.We learn that Grant has looked into an expensive but nonetheless artificial nursing home, Meadowlake; soon the narrative starts to fracture a little...we see later scenes, as Grant is conversing with a woman whose husband seems to figure into Fiona's story, and we get flashbacks of the recent past and the far past, images of the couple when young and beautiful. Problems in the marriage are now visible; Grant had apparently cheated on Fiona when a young professor...now Fiona is in the nursing home, and doesn't seem to know Grant, but has become very friendly with another patient, Aubrey, whose wife Marian (Olympia Dukakis) it is that Grant is talking with, eventually pleading with, in her home at a later point in time. Grant wants Marian's husband to return to Meadowlake, despite the relationship that was developing with Fiona; why he wants to do this is one of the many deep, not entirely fathomable decisions we see made by these damaged people, as their lives are changing and perhaps ending.I don't want to divulge more here; not that any of the revelations or developments are shocking, or even surprising, but because they are not - because they have a reality to them that is all too rare in family dramas like this one. There are no easy answers here, there is no promise of a happy ending nor is there the release of tragedy - at least, not in any obvious theatrical way. The performances are uniformly terrific; Julie Christie (Fiona) is rightfully getting a lot of praise for the way she can simultaneously show vivacity and joy, and the sorrow at losing herself - but to me Gordon Pinsent's performance as Grant is if anything even more memorable, he is the sorrowful center, he understands how his world is crumbling even when Fiona does not, and in his enormously expressive face are all the years of joy, discovery, guilt and anguish.Sarah Polley's direction at first seems a bit mannered, a bit Euro-artsy, with several static shots of Fiona and Grant talking, reading, looking at each other, and quite a few cutaway establishing shots that don't at first have obvious meaning, but as the story takes on a sad inevitability the feel of the film becomes warmer and more open. It's an amazingly assured and mature debut and probably the very best compliment I can make is that I find it difficult to compare it to anything.

But it's not a joke: Fiona has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.""  Dennis HarveyFiona, Julie Christie, is in the midst of Alzheimer's. She is having symptoms and when she becomes lost in the cold she makes the decision to enter a facility for care. Fiona and her husband, Grant, a retired professor, played by Gordon Pinsent , live on a lake in Ontario and have been married for over 40 years. Loving, fulfilled years and they seem the happy, retired couple.  This movie is so well played that we enter into the mindset of both Fiona and Grant and have a glimpse of what their lives might be like. First from the person involved with Alzheimer's and then from the partner's perspective. Julie Christie, one of the most beautiful of actresses, remains as lovely and serene as ever. As Fiona she plays this part with extreme serenity and intelligence.  Gordon Pinsent, her husband Grant, is a charismatic  man and his part is played with subtlety and perfection. Kristen Thomson, the lead nurse at the facility is wonderful with her compassion, knowledge and insight.At an early point in their marriage, Grant had affairs with his younger students and even though Fiona stayed there seems to be an unspoken anger within her.  At times you wonder if some of her symptoms and behavior are not exaggerated by her anger. At the facility, Fiona becomes involved in the daily life of a man, Aubrey, and seems at times to have forgotten who Grant is.  The issue of finding another soul to hang onto when you are going down this path of the unknown seems to me to be a human need. And, as Fiona says to Grant, ""Aubrey does not confuse me"". Many lovely scenes ensue as the Alzheimer's progresses and Grant visits daily and sits and watches his wife slowly slipping away.  Grant does become involved with life again but in his mind Fiona comes first. The life of partners when one has Alzheimer's should be viewed by all.""In a refreshingly direct, unassuming manner, ""Away From Her"" considers two great human mysteries: the persistence of love and the workings of the brain. It takes the twilight of a long, mostly happy marriage as a vantage point from which to look back at youth and forward into the waiting darkness.  I can't remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true."" A.

It's wonderful to see Julie Christie again, and yes, she is still beautiful and so classy.  Gordon Pinsent gives a truly memorable performance as the man who has to stand by and see the woman he loves disappear.  Olympia Dukakis is always great and she doesn't disappoint here.  The minor characters, the head nurse and the husband of Dukakis are both very well played.The scenes are wonderful---the sunlit snow makes everything gorgeous.  As the Amazon reviewer noted, seeing Julie Christie in the snow has to bring back memories of Lara in Zhivago.The script brings up the important issues of what love is. For this the film is worth seeing.  The moral questions that the husband faces and the choices he makes are immensely important.The Dukakis character, the pragmatist, who decides to make the best of what life brings her, gives us something else to think about.What bothered me is what many of the other reviewers have commented on--the unrealistic depiction of Alzheimers as well as the very unrealistic nursing care facility.  I don't have any personal experience with this disease so I can only suggest that anyone who is truly interested in getting insight into the problem should read all of the reviews. I can really understand the anger that some of the reviewers have expressed about this....The film attempts some sort of a positive ending in the sense of ""humans overcoming tremendous problems with pragmatism and grace,"" but it didn't work for me.  I was left with a feeling of great sadness about the horrors of the disease and I only hope and pray that a cure is found quickly for it.I think that Sarah Polley has some talent as a director but that she was far too young to undertake such a big subject.  She succeeds in trivializing it and almost romanticizing it by casting her favorite, Julie Christie, as the patient. Christie manages to look gorgeous in almost all of the scenes.

Over time she eventually gets to the point where she no longer recognizes Grant. Shortly after that time Fiona becomes romatically linked with a new companion at the home, a mute, wheel-chair bound resident named &#8220;Aubrey&#8221;.Of course Grant finds this new state of affairs enormously painful. But he also recognizes that this new relationship gives Fiona some emotional stability in her ever worsening situation and so during his visits to the home he mostly keeps his distance, watching Fiona from across the room as she sits with Aubrey, oblivious to the fact that she had ever been married. (When Grant does attempt to refresh her memory she becomes distraught at this strange man telling her strange things.)Like Grant, the viewer is forced to wrestle with feelings of fidelity and betrayal. We want to judge Fiona and Aubrey for their intolerable behavior. And yet we know there is no betrayal here. Fiona no longer knows Grant is or was her life-companion. She may be committing adultery by a narrow, legal definition (if we understand &#8220;adultery&#8221; to encompass a broader range of activity than sexual intercourse), but it is not defensible to say she his committing adultery by a moral definition.Now let&#8217;s think about this. If it is not possible for Fiona to be unfaithful to Grant, is it still possible for Grant to be unfaithful to Fiona? Perhaps. It may be that there is a radical asymmetry here which is rooted in Alzheimer&#8217;s. Thus, it may be that Fiona can have a romantic relationship with Aubrey (emotionally if not physically) which is non-culpable and thus non-adulterous because of her loss of mind, but it is not possible for Grant to do the same.But given this radical asymmetry, is it possible for Grant to dissolve the union? After all, if a spouse can have a romantic relationship with a third party with moral impunity, one might think that is evidence that the marriage has ended. Even if you do not ultimately conclude that Grant would be correct in divorcing Fiona, I hope you can see why others might disagree.randalrauser.com",4,The morality of Alzheimers,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2343,"['2006', 'dramatic', 'film', '8220', 'Away', 'Her', '8221', 'horror', 'Alzeheimer', '8217', 'mind', 'Fiona', 'played', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'eventually', 'forcing', 'husband', 'Grant', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'institutionalize', 'own', 'protection', 'time', 'eventually', 'point', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'Grant', 'Shortly', 'time', 'Fiona', 'romatically', 'linked', 'new', 'companion', 'home', 'mute', 'wheel-chair', 'bound', 'resident', 'named', '8220', 'Aubrey', '8221', 'course', 'Grant', 'new', 'state', 'affairs', 'enormously', 'painful', 'also', 'new', 'relationship', 'Fiona', 'emotional', 'stability', 'ever', 'worsening', 'situation', 'so', 'visits', 'home', 'mostly', 'distance', 'watching', 'Fiona', 'room', 'Aubrey', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'married', 'When', 'Grant', 'attempt', 'refresh', 'memory', 'distraught', 'strange', 'man', 'telling', 'strange', 'things', 'Grant', 'viewer', 'forced', 'wrestle', 'feelings', 'fidelity', 'betrayal', 'want', 'judge', 'Fiona', 'Aubrey', 'intolerable', 'behavior', 'yet', 'know', 'betrayal', 'here', 'Fiona', 'no', 'longer', 'Grant', 'was', 'life-companion', 'may', 'be', 'committing', 'adultery', 'narrow', 'legal', 'definition', 'understand', '8220', '8221', 'encompass', 'broader', 'range', 'activity', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'not', 'defensible', 'say', 'committing', 'adultery', 'moral', 'definition.Now', 'let', '8217', 'think', 'not', 'possible', 'Fiona', 'be', 'unfaithful', 'Grant', 'still', 'possible', 'Grant', 'be', 'unfaithful', 'Fiona', 'Perhaps', 'may', 'be', 'radical', 'asymmetry', 'here', 'rooted', 'Alzheimer', '8217', 'Thus', 'may', 'be', 'Fiona', 'can', 'have', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Aubrey', 'emotionally', 'not', 'physically', 'non-culpable', 'thus', 'non-adulterous', 'loss', 'mind', 'not', 'possible', 'Grant', 'do', 'same.But', 'given', 'radical', 'asymmetry', 'possible', 'Grant', 'dissolve', 'union', 'spouse', 'can', 'have', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'third', 'party', 'moral', 'impunity', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'evidence', 'marriage', 'ended', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'ultimately', 'conclude', 'Grant', 'would', 'be', 'correct', 'divorcing', 'Fiona', 'hope', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'others', 'might', 'disagree.randalrauser.com']",N/A
1083917,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B000RQDMWA,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[71, 76]","AWAY FROM HER is a film about an elderly couple that copes with Alzheimer's disease.  Director Sarah Polley take's Alice Munro's short story, ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain,"" and shows viewers the relationship between Fiona (Julie Christie) and Grant (Gordon Pinsent).  Although the film is based on Munro's story, Polley adds more to the film's storyline, such as her focus on Grant's denial and slow acceptance of Fiona's deteriorating condition, and the long drawn out scenes at Meadowlake, the facility where Fiona decides to spend the rest of her life, which adds another dimension to story and the film.Polley does a fine job in showing the intricacies that may occur in a marriage.  The film takes place in Ontario, Canada, where a somewhat remote and snow-covered landscape captures the cold and emotionless feelings between Grant and Fiona.  With the use of subtle home movie-like snapshots that capture the couple's past, the images show the irony of their lives; this is yet another film where the dialogue between the characters are short and ambiguous, but their facial expression fill-in the gaps where nothing is said as well as the film's soundtrack which complement the scenes.The film is purely fiction but interesting.  Grant shows his undying love for Fiona by making her as comfortable as possible - he comes to visit her everyday and reads her favorite books about Iceland; she does not remember being from Iceland.  And when Grant finds out that Fiona befriends one of the residents at Meadowlake, Aubrey (Michael Murphy), he is somewhat resilient and disconcerted with her behavior, but eventually accepts it in order to make her happy.  In turn, Grant has an unusual meeting/affair with Aubrey's wife, Marion (Olympia Dukakis).Although a few of the scenes may not be realistic, AWAY FROM HER is an intriguing film that confronts the issue of Alzheimer's disease.

We see her in this beautiful story of Fiona, a woman who after 45 years of marriage is faced with Alzheimer's desease.  Her quiet marriage to her husband Grant, a former college professor, was not always like that.  As time goes on, her short term memory diminishes quickly but her long term memory is as sharp as ever.  As Fiona is embracing her departure to a nursing home, where she can get medical help and attention she needs, she recalls younger years of her marriage with Grant who as a college professor had his share of young students and indiscretions.  For some unknown reason, Fiona has accepted Grant's transgressions and miraculously their marriage endured.  But now, faced with her new state of mind that she can no longer control, Fiona establishes a bond with another patient in the nursing facility who (we learn) happened to be one of her ghosts from the past.  Grant is faced to accept this new bond that Fiona has established and come to terms of his new predicament.  This quiet film shows us the many forms of love.  And letting go of person that one has shared a lifetime together with is an ultimate acceptance of the fate.  There are funny moments in this film too.

1083919,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,B000RQDMWA,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[5, 5]","I saw this a few weeks ago when Ms. Christie was winning all the awards. I had to see what the fuss was all about. Well, this first effort screenplay by Sarah Polley allows the great Ms. Christie to give a complete, reflective and understated performance that is quite stunning and heart-breaking. The film is slow, and is very much in tune with that very heartbreak that affects the families of Alzheimers victims. The husband, played by Gordon Pinsent, is the reactive character, and, as such, had the far more difficult role. He is excellent.  The frustration and insecurity he faces when his wife begins to forget is truly centered and focused; the most underrated performance of the year. I won't go into specifics of the plot, since it's pretty well laid out already. Ms. Christie is, and has been, a fine actress throughout her career. She's a maverick, and chooses her roles carefully. That she hasn't been named a Dame of the British Empire is probably because she's reclusive ad never draws attention to herself. (She also moved to Canada). She's had 4 Oscar nominations, and had won for her first, ""Darling"" (1965). She's still gorgeous. She shed some of that charm when the great Robert Altman chose her for ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" in '72. Another nomination.  Nominated in '97 for ""Afterglow"", by Alan Rudolph, opposite Nick Nolte, it only proved that this woman is still strong. And 10 years later she appears, and, again disappears into another riveting character. I have no end of admiration for Julie Christie, but, to be honest, Marion Cotillard deserved the Oscar.

1083920,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B000RQDMWA,R. Kyle,"[20, 22]","When Fiona Anderson (Christie) discovers she has Alzheimer's Disease, she opts to go to a nursing home.  Her husband, Grant (Pinsent) objects, but she's firm and believes it is for the best.  It takes a lot of grace to step away from a 44 year marriage and into a home on your own.  Christie's depiction of her parting with her husband is heart-wrenching.The couple has never been apart for 44 years, but the facility requires that they have no contact for the first 30 days.  This is to allow Fiona to settle in.  When Grant returns, he's greeted by a stranger who has formed an attachment to another male inmate Aubrey (Michael Murphy).The story focuses mainly on the older couple, but we see occasional flashbacks of younger times.  And Grant rightfully questions whether Fiona has forgotten him after the 30 day separation or if she's punishing him for his infidelities as a young college professor.""Away From Her"" brings into focus issues of eldercare and elder sexuality that many of us might shy away from. The story is treated with grace and compassion and while it could be depressing, is uplifting in many ways.22-year-old Sarah Polley did an astounding job bringing this cast and story together.  She's already a force to be reckoned with and has been since her film debut at 9.The depiction of the care facility Fiona's committed to is lovely and I wish with all my heart it was so.  There are many compassionate and loving people in the eldercare business, but there are also many under-staffed, underpaid and overworked employees as well whose decisions are made by 'bean counters' and staff convenience rather than the welfare of the patient.  One solid example of this in the movie is the 30-day required separation for new patients to 'settle in' to the facility.  How cruel is that to entrust your beloved family member to a new place without being able to see them and check on their welfare?",3,Grace under pressure--but very unrealistic care facility,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,1911,"['When', 'Fiona', 'Anderson', 'Christie', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'go', 'nursing', 'home', 'husband', 'Grant', 'Pinsent', 'firm', 'best', 'lot', 'grace', 'step', 'away', '44', 'year', 'marriage', 'home', 'own', 'Christie', 'depiction', 'parting', 'husband', 'heart-wrenching.The', 'couple', 'never', 'been', 'apart', '44', 'years', 'facility', 'have', 'contact', 'first', '30', 'days', 'allow', 'Fiona', 'settle', 'When', 'Grant', 'greeted', 'stranger', 'who', 'formed', 'attachment', 'male', 'inmate', 'Aubrey', 'Michael', 'Murphy', '.The', 'story', 'mainly', 'older', 'couple', 'see', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'younger', 'times', 'Grant', 'rightfully', 'questions', 'Fiona', 'forgotten', '30', 'day', 'separation', 'punishing', 'infidelities', 'young', 'college', 'professor', 'Away', 'focus', 'issues', 'eldercare', 'elder', 'sexuality', 'many', 'might', 'shy', 'away', 'story', 'treated', 'grace', 'compassion', 'could', 'be', 'depressing', 'uplifting', 'many', 'ways.22-year-old', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'did', 'astounding', 'job', 'bringing', 'cast', 'story', 'together', 'already', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'been', 'film', 'debut', '9.The', 'depiction', 'care', 'facility', 'Fiona', 'committed', 'lovely', 'wish', 'heart', 'was', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'compassionate', 'loving', 'people', 'eldercare', 'business', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'under-staffed', 'underpaid', 'overworked', 'employees', 'as', 'well', 'decisions', 'are', 'made', ""'bean"", 'counters', 'staff', 'convenience', 'rather', 'welfare', 'patient', 'One', 'solid', 'example', 'movie', '30-day', 'required', 'separation', 'new', 'patients', ""'settle"", 'facility', 'How', 'cruel', 'entrust', 'beloved', 'family', 'member', 'new', 'place', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'check', 'welfare']",N/A
1083921,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000RQDMWA,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","****1/2Julie Christie gives the performance of her career in ""Away From Her,"" a profoundly moving and beautifully realized film about the tragedy of Alzheimer's.  Christie plays Fiona Anderson, a once-vital woman now suffering the ravages of that uniquely cruel disease.  As her condition worsens, she and Grant, her husband of 44 years, agree that she must finally move into a facility specifically designed for the care of Alzheimer's patients.Based on a story by Alice Munro, ""Away From her"" is more than just the tale of a woman slowly losing herself and her identity in a world of increasing mental oblivion;  it is a heartbreaking story of enduring love, as Grant comes to terms with losing his life partner not merely to the condition itself but possibly to a fellow patient with whom she seems to have developed a romantic relationship.  Sarah Polley's superb debut script doesn't shy away from showing us the grim effects of the disease both on the person afflicted and the loved ones being gradually left behind.  Grant is, in many ways, the focal point of the drama and it is his selfless devotion to the woman he loves that serves as a beacon of hope for what would otherwise be an unendurably depressing story.Christie and Gordon Pinsent are utterly flawless in their performances and both deserve every accolade that could conceivably be bestowed on them for their work in this film.  Without a trace of histrionics or the slightest hint of affectation, Christie conveys the terrifying blankness of a woman forced to exist in her own private hell from which there is no escape, cut off from the people and things that once meant so much to her.  Equally impressive is Pinsent's shattering portrayal of a man trying to accept the inevitability of the disease yet, in his own subtle, quiet way, kicking and screaming against that acceptance every step of the way.  Olympia Dukakis is also moving as the wife of the man with whom Fiona has forged a relationship, a situation that provides a common ground upon which the two hurting spouses can meet and share their concerns.Polley displays a remarkable assurance and control in this her maiden effort as a director.  She somehow manages to avoid all the potential pitfalls inherent to this type of a story.  Though her film is undeniably moving, it never slips over into morbid sentimentality or disease-of-the-week condescension as it so easily might have, thanks, in large part, to the stark and spare way in which she films most of her scenes (the wintry Ontario locale helps immeasurably with this).  My one slight criticism of the film is its portrayal of the nursing home administrator, who seems remarkably obtuse in the things she says at times.  I don't doubt that such people exist in those positions, but she seems too much of a subtly smiling Nurse Ratched-type to really work in this film.  The character tends to throw the equilibrium of the piece out of whack whenever she appears.Still, this is an amazing movie that certainly should have been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.

1083922,A13D4E28S63SYF,B000RQDMWA,"Ron ""true faith""","[4, 8]","A quiet and affecting film, but a little too slow for my taste.  (I don't recommend you seeing it late at night unless you have trouble going to sleep.)  And not very plausible in some areas.  This movie reminded me of other films, so I guess it's also derivative.  Overall, it is like an Ingmar Bergman film without all that angst.  Just some of it in the form of the husband or Grant.  Although the actor who portrayed Grant was on cue, I just wished he would ""break loose"" once in a while--just as the Liv Ullmann character did in ""Autumn Sonata.""  Julie Christie reminded me of Audrey Hepburn if she continued to act in her 60s.  Christie's Fiona Anderson was a lot like Hepburn's Holly Golightly in mannerism.I know the Grant character talked about how ""we're all alone in the world.""  I guess he was talking about things that happen at his age.  But I kept wondering--don't Fiona and Grant have any kids?  grandkids?  Where are they?  Why aren't they visiting them--especially since the mother or grandmother just checked into a nursing facility.  Or, don't they see their parents or grandparents for Christmas, which is when the movie opens.  It would've been nice if this important issue was addressed in the movie.  This was one of several things that I didn't buy.  Another thing was the whole Grant/Marian relationship.  Didn't buy that either.  I don't know what Grant saw in Marian.  She's abrasive, rude and not very intelligent.  Totally unlike Fiona.  And I don't know what Marian saw in Grant--especially after she called him a jerk.  I guess the filmmaker was trying to show how desperate these two lost souls were for each other.  Again--where are the kids and grandkids?  Doesn't Marian have any either?  And don't these people have any neighbors, friends or relatives living nearby?  I find it hard to believe that these ""mature"" people would be living all by themselves.  Suppose someone had a heart attack?  Who would help them?  If Grant and Marian don't know anyone--then why don't they check into a retirement center?  (I know Marian talked about holding onto to her house because it was the only thing she and Aubrey owned outright.  But who is she saving it for?  Her kids and grandkids that we never see in the movie.)  They'll meet lots of people there and not be so lonely.  Plus, they'll get medical attention if they need it.  These were the things that didn't ring true for me in the movie.Again, a difference of opinion between me and the critics.  Something I didn't care much for but the critics raved about.

1083923,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000RQDMWA,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[7, 7]","The Academy Award nominations are a long way off, but that has not hindered the vast amount of buzz surrounding Sarah Polley's ""Away From Her,"" her directorial debut. Based on a short story by renowned Canadian writer Alice Munro, it should come as no surprise that moviegoers didn't see it in droves - its three principal actors are over the age of 65, and its driving plot point - the trauma facing a long-married man as his wife disappears into the throws of Alzheimer's disease - sounds rather cumbersome for a night out at the local theater. However, while the subject matter is certainly harrowing, Polley's script carefully matches this with an equal amount of passion and romance, all the while avoiding the sugary and trite. Matters of the heart, indeed, never taper with age.Grant and Fiona, channeled respectively through the unforgettable talents of Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie, have been married for 44 years. While those years were not without their share of troubles, they are still endlessly devoted to one another. However, neither can any longer deny that Fiona's mental capacities are starting to elude her; she gets lost after taking an evening stroll, finds she can't recall the paths of the beautiful woodlands she's known all her life, and can no longer even navigate their kitchen.""I think I may be beginning to disappear,"" she tells Grant, finally ready to accept the inevitable.Although Christie has incurred much deserved acclaim for her unprecedented performance - it takes an actress with incredible skill to pull off such a complex role - this movie really belongs to Pinsent, who knows the power of understatement. Grant never sheds a tear as the woman he devoted his life to slowly but surely forgets who he is, but he does not need to - the look in his eyes betrays the despair and anguish in his heart. It doesn't help that Madeleine, the administrator of the hospice Fiona moves to played by the always lovely Wendy Crewson, is bureaucratic and detached.To escape his solace Grant is able to confide in Kristy, a nurse played by the wonderful Kristin Thomson.""She said, `Do you think it'd be fun we got married?'"" he recalls.""And what did you say?""""I took her up on it,"" he says. ""I never wanted to be away from her.""Pinsent really hits the nail on the head when it comes to Grant's feelings of betrayal when Fiona becomes emotionally involved with Aubrey (Michael Murphy), another Alzheimer's sufferer. Despite his efforts, however, Fiona greets him for the first time every time he comes to visit her through no fault of her own.With his emotional needs now unfulfilled, Grant turns to Aubrey's wife Marian, played by the legendary Olympia Dukakis. The two form a close emotional bond over the loss of their spouses to the devastating illness.Upon Grant's asking her how she is able to maintain her sanity and keep going from day to day, Marian is frank.""Things aren't ever what you'd hope they'd be,"" she says. ""Sometimes you just have to make the decision to be happy.""All who have ever been close to anyone affected by Alzheimer's will be clearly able to see their loved ones in Fiona and themselves in Grant and Marian. However, one need only be acquainted with the emotion of true love to have the film resonate with them. Indeed, the fact that Polley wrote and directed this as a newlywed in her 20's speaks volumes not only to its emotional immediacy but its universality.Films like ""Away From Her"" are distinct from the average clutter that fills movie theaters these days for two key reasons. First, they run the emotional gamut from A to Z, while the average flick tends to do so from A to B. Second, while thoroughly entertaining, they exercise the mental muscle of their audiences - who ever said going to the movies means having to leave your brain at the door?This one is likely to become inescapable during the awards season, so precipitate the hype and check it out now.",4,Don't Turn 'Away' From This,1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,3929,"['Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'are', 'long', 'way', 'not', 'hindered', 'vast', 'amount', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Away', 'Her', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Based', 'short', 'story', 'renowned', 'Canadian', 'writer', 'Alice', 'Munro', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'moviegoers', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'three', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'age', '65', 'driving', 'plot', 'point', 'trauma', 'facing', 'long-married', 'man', 'wife', 'throws', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'rather', 'cumbersome', 'night', 'out', 'local', 'theater', 'However', 'subject', 'matter', 'certainly', 'harrowing', 'Polley', 'script', 'carefully', 'equal', 'amount', 'passion', 'romance', 'while', 'avoiding', 'sugary', 'trite', 'Matters', 'heart', 'indeed', 'never', 'age.Grant', 'Fiona', 'channeled', 'respectively', 'unforgettable', 'talents', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'have', 'been', 'married', '44', 'years', 'years', 'were', 'not', 'share', 'troubles', 'are', 'still', 'endlessly', 'devoted', 'one', 'However', 'can', 'longer', 'deny', 'Fiona', 'mental', 'capacities', 'are', 'starting', 'elude', 'lost', 'taking', 'evening', 'stroll', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'paths', 'beautiful', 'known', 'life', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'even', 'navigate', 'kitchen', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'beginning', 'disappear', 'Grant', 'finally', 'ready', 'accept', 'inevitable.Although', 'Christie', 'incurred', 'much', 'deserved', 'acclaim', 'unprecedented', 'performance', 'actress', 'incredible', 'skill', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'complex', 'role', 'movie', 'really', 'Pinsent', 'who', 'power', 'understatement', 'Grant', 'never', 'tear', 'woman', 'devoted', 'life', 'slowly', 'surely', 'forgets', 'who', 'not', 'need', 'look', 'eyes', 'despair', 'anguish', 'heart', ""n't"", 'help', 'Madeleine', 'administrator', 'hospice', 'Fiona', 'played', 'always', 'lovely', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'bureaucratic', 'detached.To', 'escape', 'solace', 'Grant', 'able', 'confide', 'Kristy', 'nurse', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Kristin', 'Thomson', 'said', 'Do', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'fun', 'got', 'married', 'what', 'did', 'say', 'took', 'up', 'never', 'wanted', 'be', 'away', 'Pinsent', 'really', 'nail', 'head', 'when', 'Grant', 'feelings', 'betrayal', 'when', 'Fiona', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'Aubrey', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'Alzheimer', 'sufferer', 'efforts', 'however', 'Fiona', 'first', 'time', 'time', 'visit', 'fault', 'own.With', 'emotional', 'needs', 'now', 'unfulfilled', 'Grant', 'Aubrey', 'wife', 'Marian', 'played', 'legendary', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'two', 'form', 'close', 'emotional', 'bond', 'loss', 'spouses', 'devastating', 'illness.Upon', 'Grant', 'asking', 'how', 'able', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'keep', 'going', 'day', 'day', 'Marian', 'frank', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'ever', 'what', ""'d"", 'hope', ""'d"", 'be', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'make', 'decision', 'be', 'happy', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'close', 'anyone', 'affected', 'Alzheimer', 'will', 'be', 'clearly', 'able', 'see', 'loved', 'ones', 'Fiona', 'Grant', 'Marian', 'However', 'one', 'need', 'only', 'be', 'acquainted', 'emotion', 'true', 'love', 'have', 'film', 'resonate', 'Indeed', 'fact', 'Polley', 'wrote', 'directed', 'newlywed', '20', 'speaks', 'not', 'only', 'emotional', 'immediacy', 'universality.Films', 'Away', 'are', 'distinct', 'average', 'clutter', 'movie', 'theaters', 'days', 'two', 'key', 'reasons', 'First', 'run', 'emotional', 'gamut', 'A', 'Z', 'average', 'flick', 'tends', 'do', 'so', 'A', 'B', 'Second', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'exercise', 'mental', 'muscle', 'audiences', 'who', 'ever', 'said', 'going', 'movies', 'having', 'leave', 'brain', 'door', 'one', 'likely', 'become', 'inescapable', 'awards', 'season', 'so', 'precipitate', 'hype', 'check', 'out', 'now']",N/A

Julie Christie, as a woman stricken with Alzheimer's disease, and Gordon Pinsett, as the man seeing his beloved wife slipping away from him, give fine performances.

As someone who cared for parents with this terrible disorder, I found that the pathos and heartbreak that comes when you watch your loved ones deteriorating was missing from the film.  Perhaps the feelings are too deeply personal to be adequately expressed to others.  If you haven't been there, you cannot possibly understand what it's like.

A long-term marriage between Grant Anderson (Gordon Pinsent) and his wife of forty four years, Fiona (Julie Christie), is in jeopardy as actions that are questionable begin with Fiona; such as putting a skillet into the freezer while drying the dishes.  Her memory is fading; the things that were staunch in her mind are now fragmenting.  As Grant never ceases to correct the odd behavior, he denies that it could be anything too serious.  Fiona does not.  While skiing outside of the country cottage on the land she knows by heart, and has traversed for years, she gets lost and travels on foot for hours before Grant is able to find her walking along a lonely and dark sidewalk.  The memory loss is progressing quickly.Fiona is checked by Dr. Fischer (Alberta Watson) who finds cause to believe she is in the stages of AD.  Fiona accepts this while Grant is reticent to believe that this could be, and is, happening.  Their marriage, since moving to this beautiful area has been very happy and loving as they spend so much time doing things together always.  Theirs is a seemingly wonderful life; now this, an admission to Meadowlake Facility for the probable, to definite, diagnosis of the disease. To add extreme insult to injury, the policy of this exclusive facility requires no visitation or phone calls for a thirty day settling in period (which I found exceptionally cruel).  After this time, Grant is there to visit Fiona, who appears not to know who he is.  The illness has progressed that rapidly. The movie vividly demonstrates how quickly the short-term memory fades and the long-term becomes somewhat more pronounced; Fiona can recall much earlier indiscretions done by Grant while he worked as a Professor, although cannot get through a sentence without forgetting the point.While Fiona is in the facility she begins a coddling attachment to a patient, Aubrey (Michael Murphy), who also suffers memory loss, is mute and wheelchair bound.  Fiona spends her time lavishing her attention on him and basically taking care of him while Grant sees this and desperately grieves for the wife he had in Fiona.  He soon becomes friends with the spouse of Aubrey, Marian (Olympia Dukakis), a peppy and spirited, pessimistic woman who adds life to Grant's emotionally overwrought days. Fiona and Grant had not spent even one day away from each other in their forty four year marriage until the permanence of right now.The movie easily pulls your emotions every way that they can go.  From the person afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, to the spouse equally in pain by being left behind and forgotten.  One of the cruelest illnesses to hit a family, marriage or intimate situation, there simply is no way to shed light to brighten such darkness.

In fact, it was: excellent Canadian actress Sarah Polley, for her first directing venture, adapted a short story by the esteemed Canadian author Alice Munro, ""The Bear Came Over The Mountain,"" with the still-lovely Christie in mind.Christie plays Fiona, a beautiful older woman, married to Grant, (Gordon Pinsent.)  Both are aware that she has Alzheimer's disease coming on.  To save his becoming a suffering caregiver -- though she still hasn't forgiven him an earlier indiscretion -- she insists she must be institutionalized.  And her husband just must deal with it.  Michael Murphy turns in a memorable performance as Aubrey, a wheelchair-bound mute whom she meets at the nursing home, and begins to believe is her husband.  Olympia Dukakis plays Marian, Aubrey's wife, toughened up by struggling to care for him, elbows at the ready.The movie jiggles its timeline and has a lot of confusing flashbacks, and forwards, that I could have lived without.  And many who know will say that Fiona's filmic Alzheimer's isn't nearly as destructive as the real thing.  But Christie towers over all; her glowing, intelligent face that shows its age is the heart of the film, and I doubt it could have been made without her.  The audience needs to remember just how beautiful she was as a younger woman (think ""Dr. Zhivago,"" or ""Far From The Madding Crowd."")  One further quibble: there's loads of footage available of Christie as that beautiful younger woman: why on earth didn't the producers buy some of it, instead of confusing me, at least, by giving us footage of Stacy La Berge as the younger Fiona?

1083934,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000RQDMWA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 6]","""Away From Her"", the new film written and directed by actor Sarah Polley (best known for her role in ""Go""), based on a short story by Alice Munro and starring Julie Christie, Gordon Pinsent and Olympia Dukakis, is a real revelation.First and foremost, this is the directorial debut of Polley. This is a major accomplishment in and of itself, but she also wrote the screenplay. Both are so understated, so low key, she almost appears to be filming real people as they go through the tribulations of their lives. She might have gotten away with this except for two things; she uses well-known actors and presents the story in a non-linear fashion.Grant (Gordon Pinsent), a former college professor, and his wife, Fiona (Julie Christie), live in a lodge on a frozen lake in Canada. They enjoy each other and live their days of retirement with a lot of activity; cross country skiing is a particular favorite activity. Then, Fiona begins to have trouble remembering things and still other things confuse her. Grant recognizes this as well, but seems to think she will get better. Fiona is diagnosed with Alzheimer's and they face the news with their usual steadfastness. They don't seem to talk about it much, but it haunts their activities and time together. Soon, the problem becomes too much and Fiona recognizes she will soon need to check into Meadowlark, a new facility for Alzheimer's patients. There, she befriends Aubrey (Michael Murphy), a silent man who seems to respond to her attention and care. Grant is shaken by this and seems put off. Then, Aubrey is removed from the home and Fiona becomes bedridden. Grant travels to Aubrey's home and meets his wife, Marian (Olympia Dukakis). They form a friendship and Grant tries to figure out a why to help Aubrey return to the home, so his wife will become better, and also a way to forge a new life with his friend Marian.It has been a while since I have seen Julie Christie on screen and she is, quite frankly a revelation. Always a beautiful woman, she has retained much of her beauty through her career and now seems both mature and beautiful. In an industry that relies so heavily on twenty something starlets, it is nice to see an actress of Christie's caliber getting a really good, juicy role. Every time she is on screen, we see something about her character. When she is in a room with Grant, we see how she is confused by her new medical problem. Gradually, we see how they come to accept the problem. In the nursing home, she latches onto Aubrey as a sort of project, a way to keep her mind working, to keep as strong as possible. But there are also moments when the disease is winning. The combination of these moments helps to paint a picture of a strong woman who is more in turmoil because of her lack of strength and independence. She has been robbed of these things and seems unsure how to get them back.She clearly loves Grant, but they have had their moments, and these show in their every interaction. As good as Christie is, Pinsent (whose background seems to be primarily as a guest star on various television series) is her equal. A former professor, he still retains the thought processes of an intellectual. Every time he is faced with something new, he stops, pauses and thinks the problem through. These include the few moments we watch as he has to deal with a new facet of his wife's disease.When he initially witnesses the relationship between his wife and her new friend, his face remains impassive, yet a number of emotions also seem to cross his features. I am not sure how this was accomplished, but it is particularly impressive. Is his wife having an affair? If she is, should he let it continue? Will it help her more than it hurts him?Olympia Dukakis hasn't been this good in years. As Marian, the wife of Aubrey, she is hardened, lonely and abrupt. It has been a struggle for her to care for her husband and then it is a financial struggle for her to keep him at Meadowlark. When Grant shows up at her door, she immediately blurts something out, unsure of his intentions. But then she realizes he simply wants to talk and warms up a little. But Marian could help stop all of the icecaps from melting, simply by looking at them. Then, as they get to know each other, she seems to realize if she participates in Grant's life, she might not feel so lonely.Michael Murphy is also great as Aubrey. He never speaks a word, confined to a wheelchair. Yet, he is able to demonstrate his character's emotions and feelings for Fiona. When they are together, his eyes follow her around as she helps him play cards. When her attention diverts from him, he `drops' his cards and she immediately returns to pick them up and help him out. It is a touching, believable performance.Generally, films told in non-linear fashion turn me off. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Go"" and others are told in non-linear fashion and I loved them, but they are told in a more mainstream fashion. ""Away From Her"" is told in true non-linear style. As we watch, a series of scenes help depict Fiona and Grant's relationship, their life together, their love, both in present day and the immediate past. Then, we see Grant dealing with the bureaucracy of Meadowlark and the decision to check his wife into the facility. He meets Marian and we learn she has brought Aubrey back home, yet, we just saw her husband and Fiona together at the home. This is the type of non-linear story presented with many different timelines happening concurrently on the screen. This is usually the type of non-linear film I can't stand. But in ""Her"", Polley uses this technique effectively. It just makes sense that we would watch the film in this fashion, because we are witnessing the story through the eyes of Fiona and Gordon, and their entire existence becomes about dealing with Fiona's memory loss. As they work through various issues, they will remember snippets of information piecemeal. Things will come back in a non-chronological fashion. This helps to put us in the shoes of Gordon, and see the world through his eyes.""Away From Her"" is a remarkably accomplished film with some outstanding performances. Hopefully, it will break out of the independent film circuit and enjoy a wider audience.

Because I remember her most as the ultra-glamorous character who shared the screen with Warren Beatty inShampoo. And watching her character, Fiona, gradually lose herself to quickly encroaching dementia was just so ineffably sad. My wife and I are currently around the same age as Grant and Fiona, married about the same number of years. And to watch their lives, the golden years they'd looked forward to sharing, simply slip away was just, well, frightening and tragic. Oh, yes, it's true that Grant was probably not the perfect husband, but he didn't deserve this. Reviewers rave about Christie's acting, but Gordon Pinsent was equally effective.

Well, that is actually not entirely true, since the love in this film ends up being one-sided. We see a husband and wife, married for decades and never apart from each other, suddenly being torn apart when they discover she has alzheimers. It is all very moving, especially the performances by Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent. Pinsent especially plays the faithful, yet lonely husband beautifully. I love that his performance is never over-the-top and though you can tell he is hurting, hides it very well. Though there is hardly a flaw to this film, one thing that irked me and stayed with me is the awful plot device they used in regards to Christie's stay at the nursing home. Upon admittance, the patient must not have a single visitor for 30 days. Well, I'm sure you can imagine what happened once the 30 days were up, and her husband tried to visit her.

Two red flags:  1 - It was an airplane movie & 2 - He called it ""Away From Here"".  I guess he must have been being sarcastic, which I wish I would have realized before buying the movie.The movie dives right into the Alzheimer's story, so you don't really get any time to bond with the woman (or the couple for that matter) and understand who she is.  Having a grandfather who had Alzheimer's, I agree with the many other reviews that the movie treats the condition way too lightly.  It does reflect the pain of the husband dealing with his wife not knowing him, but they do not show the realistic side of the rage and sometimes abusive behavior and outright rejection of the spouse.  You get the feeling that at times she knows who he is, but is almost choosing not to acknowledge him so SHE won't have to deal with the situation.The acting is OK and the story is awkward at times along with a couple gratuitous F-bombs throw in.  Anyway, I obviously didn't think the movie was that great.  If you want a pretty sterile look at Alzheimer's combined with an underdeveloped ""love"" story, then this is for you.

It's clearly convincing to see Polley's first feature film as a director to be a heavy duty drama/tearjerker. This film will have a huge following of female audiences over 40, I was like one of 10% male audiences in the full house seating. If you enjoy movies like ""Iris"" which deals with very similar issues of mental health, love, and relationship crisis, then you will easily be taken by this movie as well as the mesmerizing and deeply moving performances from Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.The story takes place in a small town in Northern Ontario, and it evolves around the relationship of a seemingly loving couple Fiona and Grant played by Christie and Pinsent. They have no children and have been happily married for more than forty years. At one point, we find out that that Grant had cheated on Fiona with a university student of his, and in order to make amends to her, they moved away to another town. Fiona gradually becomes forgetful, and was eventually diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. She She was welling to submit herself to special care centre for treatment, and it was the first time that Grant had to be away from her for at least the first month while she's there. He was not prepared to see that gradually her condition became so severe that she no longer identified him and she started to become involved with another patient. The other patient's wife Marian is played Olympia Dukakis, who is equally frustrated by her husband's condition and the financial burden she has to face on her own. Grant and Marian find solace in each other, but Grant is so devastated and continued visit Fiona in hope that she will remember him.....Julie Christie is simply mesmerizing in her meticulous body language and facial expressions. She doesn't have as much dialogues as Pinsent, but her silent and confused scenes were so powerful. I truly see Christie and Pinsent getting all kinds of acting awards for their powerful performances. I also enjoyed Olympia Dukakis' performance, even though her screentime is relatively brief.

Here are the great wisdoms. As he takes her to the nursing home, she has a lucid moment of remembering, and while we have until that moment watched only the most ideal moments of marriage - the love making, the leaning on the shoulder in camaraderie, the sweet whispered nothings, the reading of bedtime stories - now surfaces a deeper nuance. She speaks of a fling of some 20 years ago, a pained look crossing his face at her recalling, but she is calm and she is peace, saying only that people are too demanding, and that too many of us demand to be in love every day. That he did well by her. That she wishes to thank him. What four decades plus teach a couple is that there are many kinds of days, and to have a life of love, one must accept the less loving days alongside the glorious ones.Perhaps it has taken him to this moment of parting to fully understand what she understood 20 years ago. Institutionalized, she disappears into a fog. It seems the only figure emerging from the fog is that of Aubrey, a man in a wheelchair who never speaks, but forms a bond with her that excludes both his wife and her husband. The real husband can only watch, heartbroken, as the love of his life no longer recognizes him, but clings to another. We watch his heart shatter, yet his loyalty never waivers. Not even when comfort is found in the strangest places.""Away From Her"" has all the elements of a grand love story: passion, betrayal, loyalty, forgiveness, acceptance, transitions, letting go, finding home again.
