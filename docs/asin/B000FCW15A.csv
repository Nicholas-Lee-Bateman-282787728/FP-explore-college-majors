988080,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FCW15A,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Charming, spunky and amusing, Aquamarine isn't so much about mermaids as about negotiating the trials and tribulations of adolescent passage. Based on a novel by Alice Hoffman, the film is all about the gift of friendship, the search for romance and eventually finding love in some of the most unexpected places. The presence of the mermaid angle is really a vehicle for helping two friends sort out their feelings about each other and their future together.Although Aquamarine isn't perfect, at least it tries to put a friendship between two teenage girls in a positive light. Claire (Emma Roberts) and Hailey (Joanna ""Jojo"" Levesque) are 13-year-olds living in a small Florida town - both are facing an uncertain future. Hailey's mother, a marine biologist, has taken a job in Australia and they are going to be moving there shortly, much to Hailey's chagrin.Claire lives with her grandparents who run a beach club - her parents died, presumably drowned in a boating accident.  Both the girls have crushes on the local lifeguard Raymond Calder (a hunky Jake McDorman). When a sudden storm arrives, the girls' lives are changed forever when it dumps a gorgeous naked mermaid into the beach club's swimming pool. Her name is Aquamarine (Sara Paxton) and she is fleeing from an arranged marriage with a slimy merman.Aquamarine's angry dad agrees to let her explore ashore - courtesy of a ""shell phone."" She's also lucky that she's got long legs that magically appear -- for just three days, long enough for her to test her theory that love actually exists. When Aquamarine first sees Raymond, she is convinced that he is the one she can love.The plot is formulaic and there are no great surprises here, but the film is buoyed by the enormous appeal of all the leads - Paxton is suitably lovely as Aquamarine and McDorman is a standout as the sexy surfer dude -who has the look and the body to match. Of course, there are some moments that don't quite work - the cutesy friendship between Claire and Hailey is sometimes a little overdone, and there's an awful lot of adolescent giggling and squealing going on which gets a bit tiresome as the movie wears on.I also think the film could have benefited from a bit more imagination. We could have met Aqua's father and seen a bit more of her underwater world. Also Aqua could have been much more magical - perhaps the most creative bit in the movie is when Aqua tells her two new friends that starfish make great earrings because they whisper little words of praise and endearment into her ears; it's something teenage girls who have low self-esteem perhaps need more of.Aquamarine's unassuming charms make it an enjoyable distraction for its intended demographic and for those of us who like watching cute chick flick movies. You can tell the next mermaid or merman you meet that there really is such a thing as love, if only in the movies.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","AQUAMARINE certainly won't help you sprout any new brain cells, but it will entertain and is very appropriate for tweens.The story of friendship between young girls has been done ad nauseam. But this time a half-fish, half-human gets thrown into the mix. Aquamarine (Sara Paxton, SUMMERLAND TV series), gets heaved from the ocean after an argument with her father (we can easily assume that her dad is Neptune or some such god). She lands one stormy night in the swimming pool near the beach. The following evening best friends Claire (Emma Roberts, SPYMATE) and Hailey (Joanna `Jo Jo' Levesque, RV) discover Aquamarine and immediately befriend the mermaid. Crazy antics happen as Aqua learns to walk for the first time, tries to get Raymond (Jake McDorman, ECHOES OF INNOCENCE) -- the local lifeguard stud -- to fall in love with her in hopes that she won't have to return to the ocean and marry some merman she doesn't care for, and teaches the best friends what true friendship, and growing up, is all about.The open-faced innocence of the movie is the biggest draw. Clair (Roberts) and Hailey (Levesque) know nothing of sex, drugs, alcohol, or other teenage hazards. They live in a safe bubble that is barely held together by the idyllic community in which we find them. And, strangely enough, that is a pretty big plus for the film. Its minimally challenging plot harkens back to times when kids didn't have giant obstacles to overcome and just had to be ...kids.But the production still has some inventive and modern moments. ""Shellphones"" are pretty cool, as are the tiny starfish that can be worn as earrings (not to mention the fact that the starfish speak in your ears and compliment the wearer).This is as safe a movie as parents will find out there in the ever increasing minefield of questionable teen films.

988089,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000FCW15A,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 5]","Adopted from the novel by Alice Hoffman, Aquamarine is a movie about a mermaid of the same name who needs to find love in order to avoid having to marry a man that her father has approved for her and to prove him wrong (he doesn't believe love exists) about human emotions. The deal she and her father strike is a simple one: If she can find love in three days, she can escape the arranged marriage. If she doesn't find it, she will be forced to accept the hand of a man she doesn't love.Aquamarine has all the qualities one would expect in this type of movie: Juvenile situations, girls who are infatuated with the same guy, and plenty of young girl silliness. It's a premise that has been used over and over in movies before: A bunch of girls like the same guy and fight for his affections, with only one victorious in the end. Contrived and predictable, it's the type of plot one expects in a young chick flick.Some parts of this movie will have relevance to the young girls that comprise its primary audience and this is one of the reasons that children in the 7 to 13 age group will probably enjoy this film. There are several scenes where Aquamarine, Claire, and Hailey (the two girls who discover her) are forced to lock horns with the gal pal of the guy they like. Her name is Cecillia (played by Arielle Kebbel), and she is joined by a cast of arrogant friends. Aquamarine shows the girls, without realizing it, that they can and should have more confidence in themselves. They should stand up to Cecillia and others like her and not listen to the nasty things she and her friends say. There is also the message of friendship that most will relate to. At the beginning of the film, for example, Claire and Hailey are both willing to give up on their dream of falling in love and fighting over the same guy in the process if it means getting a wish fulfilled that will prevent Hailey from moving to Australia.There is a certain degree of innocence that will make Aquamarine appealing to some moviegoers, but there are plenty of flaws with this movie that will make others consider it weak and forgettable. First of all, this is obviously not a critical masterpiece. The characters are empty and you don't feel you know any of them very well. The story is predictable and unexciting, with a small amount of emotion added for minimal effect. But there isn't much else to this movie, and even the performance of Sara Paxton as Aquamarine (about the only decent one in the movie) isn't quite good enough to save the film.Speaking of performances, those of Joanna Levesque and Emma Roberts (Claire and Hailey) are both a little weak, and this is especially true of Roberts. Levesque at least keeps your attention and her expressions seem to be true to her feelings. Roberts isn't very good, however, and she doesn't look as good as she has in other pictures. Jake McDorman, who plays Raymond (the girls' common love interest), is also a little on the empty side.

988096,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FCW15A,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Yeah, yeah, it's basically a girls' movie, but I still enjoyed Aquamarine.  As far as mermaid movies go, you don't expect to find a lot of substance, so this film came as a really nice surprise to me.  Formulaic or not, this movie is all about friendship, family, overcoming your fears, and the true nature of love.  It never devolves into anything silly, either, which is why I think just about anyone would enjoy spending time with Aquamarine.Best friends Claire (Emma Roberts) and Hailey (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) are entering the late stages of what may be their last summer together, as Hailey and her mom are about to move all the way to Australia.  There's still time for them to wallow in their mutual crush for lifeguard Raymond (Jake McDorman), comb through magazines to learn everything they can learn about boys, and just enjoy spending time together at the beach, but they can no longer pretend that Hailey won't be leaving.  They both yearn for a miracle that will keep them from having to say goodbye to each other all too soon.  And sure enough, a miracle turns up right at the bottom of their pool, courtesy of a powerful storm.  That would be Aquamarine (Sara Paxton), the world's hottest mermaid, who has run away (actually, I guess she swam away) from home to avoid marrying a merman she cares nothing about.  She has three days to prove that love actually exists - only then will her father call off the arranged wedding.  Claire and Hailey, with all the knowledge of romance they have gleamed from teen magazines and Cosmo, are more than eager to help her in her quest - especially since Aquamarine has the power to grant them one wish if they succeed in helping her.Luckily, mermaids can change their tails into legs during the daylight hours, so Claire and Hailey can easily pass Aquamarine off as a friend of theirs.  They are initially disheartened when she picks Raymond to fall in love with, but friendship is thicker than schoolgirl crushes.  They actually make pretty darn good romantic coaches, but the fact that Aquamarine is gorgeous also helps her catch Raymond's eye - despite her sometimes odd behavior.  Even still, it's no walk in the park.  Aquamarine basically goes through the whole cycle of love in three days - the whole tell-tale giddiness and confusion, the heartbreak of mixed signals and possible rejection, the first kiss, etc. - and even the jealous rage of the snobby rich girl who thinks Raymond belongs to her.But will Raymond fall in love with Aquamarine in such a short period of time?  And will the stress of it all strike a wedge between Claire and Hailey?  I won't answer these questions, but I will say the film manages to tell this fanciful story with focus, integrity, and - most importantly - a lot of heart.  Actual truths are learned here, as the two girls overcome some of their own personal fears and really grow as human beings as a direct result of Aquamarine's influence on their lives.  Obviously, I think Aquamarine is a great film, and not just for young teenaged girls (although they will identify particularly well with the story).  You don't find many wholesome, genuinely funny comedies around these days.",5,You won't want to throw this one back,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,3179,"['Yeah', 'yeah', 'basically', 'girls', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Aquamarine', 'As', 'far', 'mermaid', 'movies', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'lot', 'substance', 'film', 'came', 'really', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Formulaic', 'not', 'movie', 'friendship', 'family', 'overcoming', 'fears', 'true', 'nature', 'love', 'never', 'anything', 'silly', 'either', 'why', 'think', 'just', 'anyone', 'would', 'enjoy', 'spending', 'time', 'Aquamarine.Best', 'friends', 'Claire', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Hailey', 'Joanna', 'JoJo', 'Levesque', 'are', 'entering', 'late', 'stages', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'summer', 'together', 'Hailey', 'mom', 'are', 'move', 'way', 'Australia', 'still', 'time', 'wallow', 'mutual', 'crush', 'lifeguard', 'Raymond', 'Jake', 'McDorman', 'comb', 'magazines', 'learn', 'everything', 'can', 'learn', 'boys', 'just', 'enjoy', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'beach', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'pretend', 'Hailey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'leaving', 'yearn', 'miracle', 'will', 'keep', 'having', 'say', 'goodbye', 'other', 'too', 'soon', 'sure', 'enough', 'miracle', 'up', 'right', 'bottom', 'pool', 'courtesy', 'powerful', 'storm', 'would', 'be', 'Aquamarine', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'world', 'hottest', 'mermaid', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'actually', 'guess', 'away', 'home', 'avoid', 'marrying', 'merman', 'nothing', 'three', 'days', 'prove', 'love', 'actually', 'only', 'then', 'will', 'her', 'father', 'call', 'off', 'arranged', 'wedding', 'Claire', 'Hailey', 'knowledge', 'romance', 'have', 'gleamed', 'teen', 'magazines', 'Cosmo', 'are', 'more', 'eager', 'help', 'quest', 'especially', 'Aquamarine', 'power', 'grant', 'one', 'wish', 'succeed', 'helping', 'her.Luckily', 'mermaids', 'can', 'change', 'tails', 'legs', 'daylight', 'hours', 'so', 'Claire', 'Hailey', 'can', 'easily', 'pass', 'Aquamarine', 'off', 'friend', 'theirs', 'are', 'initially', 'disheartened', 'when', 'Raymond', 'fall', 'love', 'friendship', 'thicker', 'schoolgirl', 'crushes', 'actually', 'make', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'romantic', 'coaches', 'fact', 'Aquamarine', 'gorgeous', 'also', 'catch', 'Raymond', 'eye', 'sometimes', 'odd', 'behavior', 'Even', 'still', 'walk', 'park', 'Aquamarine', 'basically', 'whole', 'cycle', 'love', 'three', 'days', 'whole', 'tell-tale', 'giddiness', 'confusion', 'heartbreak', 'mixed', 'signals', 'possible', 'rejection', 'first', 'kiss', 'etc', 'even', 'jealous', 'rage', 'snobby', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'Raymond', 'belongs', 'her.But', 'will', 'Raymond', 'fall', 'love', 'Aquamarine', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'will', 'stress', 'strike', 'wedge', 'Claire', 'Hailey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'tell', 'fanciful', 'story', 'focus', 'integrity', 'most', 'importantly', 'lot', 'heart', 'Actual', 'truths', 'are', 'learned', 'here', 'two', 'girls', 'overcome', 'own', 'personal', 'fears', 'really', 'grow', 'human', 'beings', 'direct', 'result', 'Aquamarine', 'influence', 'lives', 'Obviously', 'think', 'Aquamarine', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'young', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'will', 'identify', 'particularly', 'well', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'wholesome', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'comedies', 'days']",N/A

988113,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000FCW15A,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[32, 38]","Demographically speaking, ""Aquamarine"" has a clearly defined target audience.  Young girls from the ages five through fifteen will think that this is the greatest movie ever.  For the rest of us, meaning anyone over the age of fifteen, this is still a pretty cute film with likeable characters and decent acting.The story goes like this:  Two young friends are about to be worlds apart when one of them's mother gets a grant to work in Australia.  They pray to the weather gods in typical silly sleepover fashion in hopes to remain together.  Luckily, a mermaid washes up in the local public pool and agrees to grant them their wish if they can help her prove that love exists by getting the local lifeguard dreamboat to fall in love with her.Sounds sort of silly, right?  Well, it is, but not so silly that this flick is unwatchable.  The three lead actresses, Emma Roberts, JoJo, and Sara Paxton, are all very likeable.  Roberts and JoJo convincingly play best friends who are afraid of losing each other.  JoJo can be accused of over-acting at times, but both she and Roberts do very well in the acting department.  Arielle Kebbel plays the local mean/popular/spoiled girl that frequents films like this.  Jake McDorman plays heartthrob Ray, the apple of the mermaid's eye.  The real standout here, however, is Sara Paxton as the title character.  She's a lovely young lady who can pull off goofiness with pure Cameron Diaz flair.  Her character goes from snappy princess to giddy teenager with the flip of a switch.The story moves at a decent pace, and the special effects are actually pretty good too.  There are a couple of ""girly"" montages that include a trip to the mall and studying teen magazines that did sort of grate my elder nerves, but I survived through them and the film was worth it in the end.  This whole film plays out with a sugary sweet charm that's expected of films of this nature.Overall, I'd have to say that this flick is a safe bet for anyone who's hosting a sleepover party for their young daughter and her friends.  Another decent flick for this demographic is the conveniently titled ""Sleepover,"" which also features Sara Paxton, who plays the mean/popular/spoiled girl opposite ""Spy Kids"" alum, Alexa Vega.Highly recommended to anyone who falls in or has family members in the five to fifteen demographic, or anyone who enjoys sweet and silly teen romances.",4,Wonderful Pre-Teen/Early Teen Flick,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,2390,"['Demographically', 'speaking', 'Aquamarine', 'clearly', 'defined', 'target', 'audience', 'Young', 'girls', 'ages', 'five', 'fifteen', 'will', 'think', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'rest', 'meaning', 'anyone', 'age', 'fifteen', 'still', 'pretty', 'cute', 'film', 'likeable', 'characters', 'decent', 'acting.The', 'story', 'Two', 'young', 'friends', 'are', 'be', 'worlds', 'apart', 'when', 'one', 'mother', 'grant', 'work', 'Australia', 'pray', 'weather', 'gods', 'typical', 'silly', 'sleepover', 'fashion', 'hopes', 'remain', 'together', 'Luckily', 'mermaid', 'up', 'local', 'public', 'pool', 'grant', 'wish', 'can', 'help', 'prove', 'love', 'exists', 'getting', 'local', 'lifeguard', 'dreamboat', 'fall', 'love', 'her.Sounds', 'sort', 'silly', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'so', 'silly', 'flick', 'unwatchable', 'three', 'lead', 'actresses', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'JoJo', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'are', 'very', 'likeable', 'Roberts', 'JoJo', 'convincingly', 'play', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'losing', 'other', 'JoJo', 'can', 'be', 'accused', 'over-acting', 'times', 'Roberts', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'acting', 'department', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'local', 'mean/popular/spoiled', 'girl', 'films', 'Jake', 'McDorman', 'heartthrob', 'Ray', 'apple', 'mermaid', 'eye', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'however', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'title', 'character', 'lovely', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'goofiness', 'pure', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'flair', 'character', 'snappy', 'princess', 'giddy', 'teenager', 'flip', 'switch.The', 'story', 'moves', 'decent', 'pace', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'are', 'couple', 'girly', 'montages', 'include', 'trip', 'mall', 'studying', 'teen', 'magazines', 'did', 'sort', 'grate', 'elder', 'nerves', 'survived', 'film', 'was', 'worth', 'end', 'whole', 'film', 'out', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'charm', 'expected', 'films', 'nature.Overall', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'flick', 'safe', 'bet', 'anyone', 'who', 'hosting', 'sleepover', 'party', 'young', 'daughter', 'friends', 'decent', 'flick', 'demographic', 'conveniently', 'titled', 'Sleepover', 'also', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'who', 'mean/popular/spoiled', 'girl', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'alum', 'Alexa', 'Vega.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'family', 'members', 'five', 'fifteen', 'demographic', 'anyone', 'who', 'sweet', 'silly', 'teen', 'romances']",N/A

She has just a few days to prove it exists, and she picks out the local life guard whom the two young protagonists also admire.There's a bit of romance, a bit of humor, even a bit of suspense as the boy's previous girlfriend jealously interferes, and a few poignant moments as well.

It's been done in Splash(a film that made Daryl Hannah a star), and even Christy Chung(Jan Dara, Sam Sara) played in a mermaid in a Hong Kong fairy tale. With Aquamarine, it's not really a romantic comedy, it's more of a coming of age movie about the summer life on the beach and two best girlfriends having fun with a new friend from sea named Aquamarine.The mermaid has a few moments of good water swiming visuals to serve as eye-candy, but it's really not so funny just watch the three teens trying to win the heart of a hearthrob body guard. I think the film had neglected to explore the under water marine life and the family of the mermaid. That was something that I was hoping to see. Just imagine all the underwater mermaids and sea creatures and stuff, that would've been fun to watch. Maybe they don't have the budget to cover those areas.
