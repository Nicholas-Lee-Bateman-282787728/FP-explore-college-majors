I heard it here in California on a radio show hosted by a DJ (back when they were actual Disk Jockies) named Greg Stone, his show Stone Trek. I loved what i heard then and i went crazy tring to find the rest of their albums.Shortly after i discovered them Fish left and I was never able to see them with Fish in concert. I DID get to see them in a CD store with Steve Hogarth and i still thought they were one of the best Prog Rock bands alive (Genesis was dieing at that time and Yes went somewhere i didn't want to go). Their closing song for the set in the store was The Who's Substitute, whre steve sang ""i'm a substitute for that other guy""I am writing this to let you all know they are not completely undiscovered here in the states. I wasn't the only person in the store. Amazingly enough (i knew the store owners at that time) the people in the store hadn't heard them, but from that da forward until they went out of business i had heard their music in that store every time i went in.This was a band of great musicians (as i am sure it still is) and they were great, in the late morning after a hard night of partying the night before. I can only imagin what time has aged them into",5,Haven't seen it YET,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,1253,"['first', 'experience', 'Marillion', 'was', 'Missplaced', 'Childhood', 'heard', 'here', 'California', 'radio', 'show', 'hosted', 'DJ', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'actual', 'Disk', 'Jockies', 'named', 'Greg', 'Stone', 'show', 'Stone', 'Trek', 'loved', 'what', 'i', 'heard', 'then', 'i', 'went', 'crazy', 'tring', 'find', 'rest', 'albums.Shortly', 'i', 'discovered', 'Fish', 'left', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'see', 'Fish', 'concert', 'DID', 'get', 'see', 'CD', 'store', 'Steve', 'Hogarth', 'i', 'still', 'thought', 'were', 'one', 'best', 'Prog', 'Rock', 'alive', 'Genesis', 'was', 'dieing', 'time', 'Yes', 'went', 'somewhere', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'closing', 'song', 'set', 'store', 'was', 'Who', 'Substitute', 'whre', 'steve', 'sang', 'i', ""'m"", 'substitute', 'other', 'guy', 'am', 'writing', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'undiscovered', 'here', 'states', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'person', 'store', 'Amazingly', 'enough', 'i', 'knew', 'store', 'owners', 'time', 'people', 'store', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'forward', 'went', 'business', 'i', 'had', 'heard', 'music', 'store', 'time', 'i', 'went', 'in.This', 'was', 'band', 'great', 'musicians', 'i', 'am', 'sure', 'still', 'were', 'great', 'late', 'morning', 'hard', 'night', 'partying', 'night', 'can', 'only', 'imagin', 'what', 'time', 'aged']",N/A

Having had the dvd from the "" Marbles-Live "" Tour, I thought, how can they better this ? Amazingly they did ! When the "" Somewhere Else ""cd came out I was, quite frankly, disappointed, as the recording was very lackluster. Marillion literally seemed to be going through the motions. The mix /mastering also had an odd sense of compression. Needless to say, the cd didn't last in my collection for long.The fidelity as well as the performance quality on THIS dvd, however, more than makes up for it predecessor in spades. If you're at all a fan of Marillion, this is the dvd to have !!! Nothing lackluster about the way these guys played at this particular concert.
