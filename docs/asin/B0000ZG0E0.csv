It wasn't particularly funny, it was only sometimes interesting, the beginning of the film was nearly unwatchable because it was so awful, and yet, here I am giving the movie a 4 out of 5 rating!It's about a bunch of people who work at a bank who develop their own ways to steal the money out of the safes.  The story is actually carefully and somewhat intelligently put together, and some of the scenes near the middle of the film were really good (such as that one guy leaving his fancy home with a shotgun and walking down the street going after the people he believes are throwing eggs at the house, not to mention his little dog was hysterical too).A very good moment at the very end of the film before the credits start rolling.

But circumstances dictate they pull out all the stops, gamble with everything they have or will ever have, and choose another path.In this case, three tellers in a small southwestern community have decided that they're going to rob the bank. The twist: None of them knows the plans of the others -and- each has independently planned to do it over the same weekend.Sheila (Silverstone) because she wants to get back at her recent-ex-boyfriend, the prig bank manager. Stuart (Costanzo) because he's never done anything ""big"" in his life. And Woods (Harrelson) the wilderness hippie who has been working undercover as a corporate stooge in order to get revenge for the death of his best friend's mother. His best friend is a duck named George.And almost any production that has Woody Harrelson in the mix is likely to be, at the very least, interesting - even if the film itself sucks toads. In Harrelson's case - that can be taken literally.As it happens, Woody notwithstanding, this was an enjoyable flick.Lightheartedly funny throughout, touching and sentimental at the right spots, and plausible enough to make some sense in movie terms. A difficult balance for this kind of low-budget ensemble production. So credit is due to Director Grazer who achieved it.My only real complaint is the ""what happened after"" history clip didn't include one of the main characters - spunky Rachael Leigh Cook. It's rather insulting to her and her character not having a resolution.This is a solid rental choice for a cold rainy day. Something light to pass away the time and catch a few laughs. And to be blunt, watching the always enjoyable John Cleese running around in a gaudy kimono, loaded shotgun in hand, and an angry pomeranian hunting pesky egg throwers is always good for a few chuckles.Three stars, but a strong three - or a perhaps low four - depending on the type of movies you enjoy.",3,Familiar Recipe But Enjoyable Nonetheless,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2278,"['Scorched', 'one', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'Crazy', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'destined', 'life', 'less', 'realized', 'circumstances', 'dictate', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'gamble', 'everything', 'have', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'choose', 'path.Scorched', 'one', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'Crazy', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'destined', 'life', 'less', 'realized', 'circumstances', 'dictate', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'gamble', 'everything', 'have', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'choose', 'path.In', 'case', 'three', 'tellers', 'small', 'southwestern', 'community', 'have', 'decided', ""'re"", 'going', 'rob', 'bank', 'twist', 'None', 'plans', 'others', '-and-', 'independently', 'planned', 'do', 'same', 'weekend.Sheila', 'Silverstone', 'get', 'back', 'recent-ex-boyfriend', 'prig', 'bank', 'manager', 'Stuart', 'Costanzo', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'big', 'life', 'Woods', 'Harrelson', 'wilderness', 'hippie', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'undercover', 'corporate', 'stooge', 'order', 'get', 'revenge', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'duck', 'named', 'George.And', 'almost', 'production', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'mix', 'likely', 'be', 'very', 'least', 'interesting', 'even', 'film', 'toads', 'Harrelson', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'literally.As', 'Woody', 'notwithstanding', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'flick.Lightheartedly', 'funny', 'touching', 'sentimental', 'right', 'spots', 'plausible', 'enough', 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'terms', 'difficult', 'balance', 'kind', 'low-budget', 'ensemble', 'production', 'So', 'credit', 'due', 'Director', 'Grazer', 'who', 'achieved', 'it.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'what', 'happened', 'history', 'clip', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'spunky', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'rather', 'insulting', 'character', 'not', 'having', 'resolution.This', 'solid', 'rental', 'choice', 'cold', 'rainy', 'day', 'Something', 'light', 'pass', 'away', 'time', 'catch', 'few', 'laughs', 'be', 'blunt', 'watching', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'John', 'Cleese', 'running', 'around', 'gaudy', 'kimono', 'loaded', 'shotgun', 'hand', 'angry', 'pomeranian', 'hunting', 'pesky', 'egg', 'throwers', 'always', 'good', 'few', 'chuckles.Three', 'stars', 'strong', 'three', 'perhaps', 'low', 'four', 'depending', 'type', 'movies', 'enjoy']",Scorched

With a talented cast and intriguing characters, this movie has it all - except a solid plot and some funny one-liners.  Still, the movie does get it right at random moments and I found myself laughing quite often.

Also, for having so many talented comedians in the film, I have to admit that there were no real standouts as far as the cast is concerned.

790082,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B0000ZG0E0,S Martin,"[0, 1]","We rented this movie on a whim, wanting a good comedy that doesn't rely on loads of toilet humor to be funny. This one fits the bill. It's not an outstanding movie, but if you're looking for a fun, lighthearted movie, it's perfectly adequate, especially since there's several big name stars in the cast.The local branch of a bank in a small town has three tellers. First is Stuart. He's a little nervous, and he's always telling his best friend, Max, why Max's hair brained make money fast schemes won't work. Then there's Jason, an ecologically minded desert dweller, who lives with a duck. And last is Sheila, who moved out with her boyfriend. The boyfriend is the bank manager, Rick.In addition to the three bank tellers and the bank manager, there's Carter and Shmally, Mark, and Cherchant. Carter has motivational problems and Schmally has trouble sorting out the fantasies of her D&amp;D character and her real life. Mark's a firefighter and kind of love interest to Sheila. And Charles Merchant is the zany millionaire who sells his tapes on how to get rich through real estate.The three tellers are less than pleased with their jobs, and all three decide to rob the bank. However, no one mentions their plan to anyone else, and they all pick the same weekend to do it. Stuart's plan is simple; he can grab a set of keys that will let him get into the mini vault behind the teller's bench, which contains about $250,000. He plans on grabbing it Friday, leaving for Vegas that night, and betting it all on black on the roulette table. If he wins, he puts it back. If he loses, he becomes a criminal.Jason's plan is a little more devious. As the assistant manager (with a whopping 55 cents an hour raise), he has one of the two the keys needed to get into a Safe Deposit Box. Charles Merchant keeps a large amount of money in his, and his fuzzy dog keeps the key hidden in its collar. Jason plans to snag the key off the dog, use his door key to get into the bank when it's closed on Sunday, and take Merchant's money. Part of it is a payback on Merchant, who shot and killed his duck's mother.Sheila plans to not only rob the bank, but get Rick, the manager fired. It turns out she'd spent all her money to send him to college and hire him a tutor, and now he's dating the tutor and has dumped her.  She makes a copy of the key that protects the room behind the ATMs and is going to steal the $40,000 in each of the ATMs. Hackers once got in and through the codes and cleaned the ATM's out that way, and if it happens again Rick gets fired.The movie isn't bad, although I did have a couple questions. First, why did Rachael Leigh Cook get billing with Silverstone, Cleese, and Harrelson? She only has a bit part. Paul Costanzo should have gotten top billing, as he's one of the three tellers. I can only guess that he's not a big enough star. My other question is a rather obvious plot hole. Shiela's plan is to steal the money out of the ATM's and have it blamed on hackers. In the opening scene it's obvious both of them are in the lobby of the building. If the bank is closed on Sunday, and there's no sign of forced entry, how would hackers break into the ATM's and get the money out of the lobby? It's not like they could just transfer it, the physical money would still be there. Sheila used her keys to get into the bank, so the lobby wasn't left open for customers.The movie is really quite funny, with all the characters running into each other and getting tied into the plot in varying ways. It's almost slapstick the way things work out, and the ending has you cheering for the three bank robbers.
