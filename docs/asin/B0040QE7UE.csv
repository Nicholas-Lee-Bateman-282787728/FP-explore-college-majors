1379563,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0040QE7UE,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 7]","There are any number of movies out like this one. The scenarios are very similar. A winning coach coaches a bunch of losers into a fine tuned machine. A has-been coach coaches a bunch of losers into a fine tuned machine. A good coach ends up in an adverse situation and manages to coach a bunch of losers into a fine tuned machine. The details differ but the road map is always very similar.The Winning Season isn't entirely unlike it's predecessors but it differs enough to make it interesting. Here, Sam Rockwell must overcome his personal demons to not only coach a less than good girls basketball team, but to catch up with a world that is passing him by.This movie has a lot of nice touches in it. Rockwell is his usual good self as guy who needs to get back on the horse. But he ends up on a horse of a different color. He's not overjoyed at the prospect of working with girls, but it beats bussing tables. As he works with them he now must come to grips with the whole idea of political correctness. The girls keep reminding him when he says things that are less than sensitive. He must also try to patch up his relationship with his estranged daughter, and kicking his addiction to the bottle will take some doing as well.He works on them all with less than a great amount of enthusiasm but starts to come around with the help of those around him. However, like many weak men, he stumbles and falls and everything is in danger of crashing down around him.This is where the movie falters. The final few scenes degrade into near slapstick. It got so bad I couldn't help but wonder if writers or directors were switched at that point. I couldn't imagine any viewer believing any of it for a minute and it's a shame. Because, up until those final few scenes, this movie had a lot going for it.The performances are mostly decent to good. The production values are good enough to get the point across. The directing (outside of some feeble game sequences) is decent enough. All in all this is not a bad outing. If you're into sports related movies give it a go. Though not the best of its kind, it's still worth seeing.",3,Falters at the Finish Line,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,2121,"['are', 'number', 'movies', 'one', 'scenarios', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'winning', 'coach', 'bunch', 'losers', 'fine', 'tuned', 'machine', 'has-been', 'coach', 'bunch', 'losers', 'fine', 'tuned', 'machine', 'good', 'coach', 'up', 'adverse', 'situation', 'manages', 'coach', 'bunch', 'losers', 'fine', 'tuned', 'machine', 'details', 'differ', 'road', 'map', 'always', 'very', 'similar.The', 'Winning', 'Season', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'predecessors', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'Here', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'must', 'overcome', 'personal', 'demons', 'not', 'only', 'coach', 'less', 'good', 'girls', 'basketball', 'team', 'catch', 'up', 'world', 'passing', 'by.This', 'movie', 'lot', 'nice', 'touches', 'Rockwell', 'usual', 'good', 'self', 'guy', 'who', 'get', 'back', 'horse', 'up', 'horse', 'different', 'color', 'not', 'overjoyed', 'prospect', 'working', 'girls', 'bussing', 'tables', 'now', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'whole', 'idea', 'political', 'correctness', 'girls', 'keep', 'reminding', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'less', 'sensitive', 'must', 'also', 'try', 'patch', 'up', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'kicking', 'addiction', 'bottle', 'will', 'take', 'doing', 'well.He', 'works', 'less', 'great', 'amount', 'enthusiasm', 'come', 'help', 'However', 'many', 'weak', 'men', 'falls', 'everything', 'danger', 'crashing', 'down', 'him.This', 'where', 'movie', 'falters', 'final', 'few', 'scenes', 'degrade', 'slapstick', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'writers', 'directors', 'were', 'switched', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'viewer', 'believing', 'minute', 'shame', 'up', 'final', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'it.The', 'performances', 'are', 'mostly', 'decent', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'directing', 'feeble', 'game', 'sequences', 'decent', 'enough', 'not', 'bad', 'outing', ""'re"", 'sports', 'related', 'movies', 'give', 'go', 'not', 'best', 'kind', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
1379564,AY12DBB0U420B,B0040QE7UE,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I enjoy a sports movie now and then, so when I spotted &#34;The Winning Season&#34; starring Sam Rockwell and Emma Roberts in the five-dollar DVD bin at Wal-Mart I picked it up. It was concerned with small-town Indiana girl's high school basketball, surely not the most glamorous of team spectator sports. Rockwell, a former basketball star, got the chance to be the coach of a six-girl, rag-tag team. He was not enthusiastic, to say the least, but it lifted him out of a temporary bus-boy job. He quickly endeared himself to the girls and other high school employees and was widely regarded as a rear-side body opening. It's one of the more commonly used words in the movie, and it fits. Even he uses it when talking about himself.In any case, the whole story is practically a sports cliche and you all know what's going to happen. The rag-tag team will have a few big early losses, then somehow find themselves, then start to win and finally get into the state division title match. Yawn! The somewhat alcoholic coach chooses their overweight lesbian bus driver to be his assistant coach, and the head coach finally manages to get kicked off the team and banned from the school. By this time, of course, he's enthusiastic about girl's basketball and tries everything to get his coaching position back. He coaches the final couple games through a variety of ruses including sending in instructions via the phone. Somehow, it all works and makes for a very enjoyable and exciting movie. Plus, it's very funny in places.Well, this movie has to be the ultimate in low-cost productions. Everything is minimal. An actual high school serves as the set and there are no fancy design changes. The grounds are as is. There are no action scenes. The crowds are minimal and look like local townspeople who are enjoying being part of a movie. The acting is minimal, but it fits the situation. Everything works. You feel like you are there and you develop a good dislike for the coach, until he finally wins you over. It turns into an amazingly emotional experience. Well done. Why can't we have more minimalist movies such as this one?Gary Peterson",5,Ultra-low-cost Production. Well Done!

1379566,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0040QE7UE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","Imagine everything good or bad you could say about an underdog sport's story.  There have been down-on-their-luck coaches paired with mismatched teams more times than I care to count in films with varying degrees of success.  The indie charmer ""The Winning Season"" offers absolutely nothing new in the realm of sport's movie cliches.  But if you're going to take a tried and true formula, at least make it likable and do it well.  And here is where ""The Winning Season"" excels.  Even though the film offers little to surprise you, there is a talented cast that will have you rooting.  And sometimes that's enough!Of course, it doesn't hurt when the coach in question is the always interesting Sam Rockwell.  The eccentric Rockwell is easily one of our more underrated actors, and in ""The Winning Season"" he employs his hangdog charm to good affect.  A former basketball player and coach, Rockwell's volatile temper has reduced him to busboy status at a local Indiana eatery.  With no preamble, the film gets him set up on the coach track again--this time spearheading a team of six high school girls in serious need of guidance.  He hates the new position, the girls hate him--it's a classic pairing.  But before you can say ""I've seen it all before,"" the girls start winning and the team dynamic starts evolving.  Not only can the girls learn from Rockwell, but their faith can help restore him--as he is also a hopeless alcoholic with a strained relationship with his own daughter (naturally).But, for the most part, I went with this tale.  Amusing, without being preachy, this slight and familiar romp works on its own merits.  The young cast of familiar faces (Emma Roberts, Rooney Mara, Emily Rios, Connor Paolo, Shareeka Epps) are appealing and believable.  Margo Martindale is also particularly interesting as the team's bus driver/assistant coach.  Not everything rang true, however, there is some racial and sexual orientation hostility that seems like it comes from another movie (and one from about 20 years ago).  Rockwell is also such an obvious disaster, it doesn't seem likely he'd have lasted long in the public school system.  But I was still enchanted by this story of a man and his team who overcome adversity to realize the best in one another.  And there are plenty of laughs along the way.  Rockwell's appearance of the final game borders on madcap genius.  If you have a soft heart for these films, I think ""The Winning Season"" will be a crowd pleaser.  About 3 1/2 stars.
