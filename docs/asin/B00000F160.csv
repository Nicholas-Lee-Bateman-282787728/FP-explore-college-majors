How incredibly annoying it is to see the exploitation of the immortal artist name for the most pecuniary purposes of those who stage such vulgar garbage.  This is even beyond the discussion on rape, which indeed could have been used to obtain a contract; many artists resorted to any treachery and deceit, as Tintoretto in Scuola Grande di San Rocco (although no rape was involved there!).What is offending here is vulgarization of art; the destruction of what was initially used to obtain profit in the box office; Artemisia Gentileschi name is used for an erotic tale in style of French beloved ""Emmanuele"", while no notion is given to her actual work.  And how poor it is dramatically - the dialogs are so dumb, predictable and primitive; and acting is to match.  I stopped after 20 minutes watching - it was becoming so repetitive and unbearable.I give this film one star only for the beauty of costumes, while nudity could be much better filmed - so even from the erotic standpoint, this is a very poor opus.  Also, it is impossible not to give any stars, alas.It is simply a bad movie - Artemisia or not.

496590,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00000F160,Brian E. Erland,"[3, 4]","The '98 French film `Artemisia' fluctuates back and forth between artsy, romantic, decadent, eloquent and profound. According to a large number of reviews preceding mine the film is greatly lacking in historical content and since I know nothing about this real life figure from the 17th century other than what is portrayed in this film I will not attempt to contradict their opinion. I will simply confine my comments to the film itself.`Artemisia' is a dreamy, insightful period piece with the lovely Valentina Cervi in the role of the immensely talented painter Artemisia. The task of finding an appreciative audience for this film falls predominately on Valentina's shoulders. As she battles against the limitations placed on 17th century women by society at large one must be able to relate to the interior angst and anger of the highly artistic and emotional Artemisia if one is going to stay focused on the storyline. In my opinion Valentina did a superb job displaying her feelings and frustrations non-verbally through her expressive and angelic face and bottomless, unfathomable eyes. If you like her performance you'll enjoy the film, if you don't then it's time to move on.`Artimisia' is a bit uneven here and there and probably too slow for some. However the scenes and dialogue between Artimisia and her art teacher and love interest Agostino Tassi (Miki Manojlovic) are beautifully done and make it well worth watching.",4,"""More Earth, Less Sky"" ~ Lessons In Perspective",1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,1434,"[""'98"", 'French', 'film', 'Artemisia', 'back', 'forth', 'artsy', 'romantic', 'decadent', 'eloquent', 'profound', 'According', 'large', 'number', 'reviews', 'preceding', 'mine', 'film', 'greatly', 'lacking', 'historical', 'content', 'know', 'nothing', 'real', 'life', 'figure', '17th', 'century', 'other', 'what', 'portrayed', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'attempt', 'contradict', 'opinion', 'will', 'simply', 'confine', 'comments', 'film', 'itself.', 'Artemisia', 'dreamy', 'insightful', 'period', 'piece', 'lovely', 'Valentina', 'Cervi', 'role', 'immensely', 'talented', 'painter', 'Artemisia', 'task', 'finding', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'film', 'predominately', 'Valentina', 'shoulders', 'limitations', 'placed', '17th', 'century', 'women', 'society', 'large', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'interior', 'angst', 'anger', 'highly', 'artistic', 'emotional', 'Artemisia', 'one', 'going', 'stay', 'focused', 'storyline', 'opinion', 'Valentina', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'displaying', 'feelings', 'frustrations', 'non-verbally', 'expressive', 'angelic', 'face', 'bottomless', 'unfathomable', 'eyes', 'like', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', 'time', 'move', 'on.', 'Artimisia', 'bit', 'uneven', 'here', 'there', 'probably', 'too', 'slow', 'However', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'Artimisia', 'art', 'teacher', 'love', 'interest', 'Agostino', 'Tassi', 'Miki', 'Manojlovic', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'make', 'well', 'watching']",Artemisia VHS

As someone who graduated from art school in the 1970's, I can attest to the the almost total neglect paid to the accomplishments of woman artists prior to the 1960's. One of the few exceptions that comes to mind is Mary Cassatt; and what credit she has been afforded is unfairly stigmatized by her "" woman's "" subject matter.I bought this DVD because I'm a painter, and I had incorrectly assumed that this was going to be a more accurate telling of her remarkable life story. Frankly, I wish I had seen it first; I would have spent my money elsewhere.Update: Having seen the film again recently, I have to say that I disliked it even more upon a second viewing.

But there was no son so she worked in the family business which happened to be turning out paintings for wealthy patrons and the Church. To his credit, her father attempted to have her admitted to schools for formal artistic training, but although her talent was outstanding, her sex was against her. She sought out informal instruction from an artist working with her father. The lessons soon included training in lovemaking as well.

The affair is open to interpretation--did Tasso rape Artemisia, or did he initiate her sexually because they really loved each other?  This becomes an important point later in the film as Tasso goes on trial for raping her.I will not spoil the outcome of the trial.  In fact, the trial is the least interesting aspect of the film.

496602,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B00000F160,One More Option,"[5, 8]","The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of ""Blue Lagoon"" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tassi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that ""historical accuracy"" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, ""No one dies of sorrow.""  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in ""Angels in America"" says, ""The body is the garden of the soul.""  Sorrow is worth full attention.The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply ""good"" or ""bad""; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.Compare Caravaggio's ""Judith Beheading Holofernes"" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions.",2,Personal truths and loyalties,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,4272,"['movie', 'evocative', 'work', 'art', 'encourage', 'people', 'read', 'reviews', 'want', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'agree', 'many', 'positive', 'negative', 'comments', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'other', 'reviewers', 'will', 'limit', 'comments', 'items', 'not', 'previously', 'mentioned.The', 'DVD', 'cover', 'false', 'impression', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'sort', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'Renaissance', 'not', 'misleading.I', 'concede', 'story', 'probably', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'b', 'statutory', 'rape', 'occurred', 'probably', 'rape', 'definition', 'c', 'Tassi', 'was', 'probably', 'inconsiderate', 'conceited', 'immoral', 'quality', 'film', 'not', 'judged', 'solely', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'high', 'morality', 'characters', 'Having', 'said', 'do', 'object', 'movie', 'according', 'rape', 'trial', 'transcript', 'best', 'evidence', 'available', 'not', 'just', 'inaccurate', 'oppositional', 'what', 'probably', 'occurred', 'Therefore', 'critique', 'film', 'portraying', 'story', 'real', 'person', 'movie', 'internally', 'justify', 'actual', 'historical', 'effects', 'fictional', 'incorrect', 'causal', 'factors', 'cause-effect', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'ring', 'true.Having', 'said', 'agree', 'Richard', 'Burt', 'review', 'comments', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'reasonable', 'Artemisia', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'adversarial', 'speaking', 'public', 'rape', 'trial', 'defending', 'freedom', 'reputation', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Tassi', 'personally', 'too', 'easy', 'just', 'paint', 'Tassi', 'purely', 'evil', 'character', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'usually', 'more', 'complexity', 'diverse/conflicting', 'interests', 'most', 'people', 'especially', 'strong', 'objection', 'end', 'film', 'Artemisia', 'one', 'sorrow', 'probably', 'intended', 'sarcasm', 'comment', 'line', 'frustrated', 'People', 'DO', 'die', 'sorrow', 'limited', 'experience', 'suggested', 'smartest', 'most', 'sensitive', 'artistic', 'caring', 'people', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'were', 'same', 'people', 'most', 'threatened', 'sorrow', 'people', 'have', 'admired', 'most', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'mortally', 'threatened', 'sorrow', 'Not', 'selfish', 'controlling', 'passive-aggressive', 'sorrow', 'rather', 'sorrow', 'other', 'less', 'obvious', 'motivations', 'often', 'unidentified', 'misunderstood', 'misconceptions', 'Sorrow', 'can', 'lead', 'literal', 'death', 'deaths', 'spirit', 'character', 'soul', 'creativity', 'Sorrow', 'not', 'incidental', 'Sorrow', 'can', 'destroy', 'health', 'Angel', 'America', 'Angels', 'America', 'body', 'garden', 'soul', 'Sorrow', 'worth', 'full', 'attention.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'examine', 'effect', 'Artemisia', 'loyalties', 'father', 'teacher', 'screenwriter', 'not', 'bent', 'assessing', 'relationships', 'simply', 'good', 'bad', 'relationships', 'are', 'drawn', 'having', 'good', 'bad', 'effects', 'Artemesia', 'loyalties', 'encourage', 'artistry', 'expression', 'work', 'create', 'environment', 'not', 'inhibit', 'conceal', 'gifts', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'intrusive', 'almost', 'certainly', 'affect', 'choices', 'privacy', 'pacing', 'desired', 'level', 'influence.Artemisia', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'painter', 'father', 'drive', 'design', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'constant', 'intervention', 'narrowed', 'occupations', 'could', 'participate', 'polite', 'society.May', 'loyalties', 'encourage', 'seeking', 'speaking', 'best', 'personal', 'truths', 'can', 'find', 'may', 'best', 'personal', 'truths', 'can', 'find', 'shape', 'loyalties.Compare', 'Caravaggio', 'Judith', 'Beheading', 'Holofernes', 'Artemisia', 'version', 'same', 'painting', 'version', 'more', 'violent', 'realistic', 'less', 'idealized', 'posing', 'dirtiness', 'lighting', 'etc.', 'version', 'female', 'servant', 'actively', 'helping', 'Judith', 'Artemisia', 'paintings', 'show', 'palpable', 'understanding', 'hate', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'compassion', 'Artemisia', 'likely', 'became', 'expressive', 'personal', 'feelings', 'experiences', 'knew', 'best', 'why', 'people', 'care', 'movie', 'life', 'experiences', 'accurately', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'led', 'creative', 'decisions']",Artemisia VHS
496603,A16MZ9PUXO3Z9D,B00000F160,Oposum in the Garden,"[4, 6]","This movie could have some value if you look at it purely as a work fiction, if the stroy wouldn't be so ridiculous.But the director claimed it was Artemisia's true story. Of course, artists can take certain liberties in the portrayal of their subjects, this movie is not a documentary. It is a movie about a young female painter and her sexual initiation. A young women in love with the man who rapped her. (Women don't fall in love with the guys who rapped them).The fact that their names are  those of historical persons, doesn't make the story close to Artemisia Gentileschi's real experiences. And I know this movie was first advertised as showing the true story, which shows how sloppy the research must have been.  I think the director knew that Artemisia, after the rape wanted  Tassi to marry her. And this fact got the basis for the entire twisted story in the movie.How it was in reality? She was rapped, and as not being a virgin anymore, she wouldn't be able to find a husband.  Those days a woman who was raped was considered loose, and if not married, her life wasn't easy. So, the rape victims got married to the rapists, from fear of society. Her case, her wish and fear is not unusual in this regard. In  he promised her marriage, but didn't keep his promise. There was rape trial, but of course Tassi got a better treatment,as being a man.He could testify without being tortured. She testified under torture, and if anyone reads the trial transcripts, (I did), will see it was rape.  During torture she screamed in one point, ""this is the ring you promised me!"" when the thumb screws were applied. But this doesn't mean she was really in love with him. Cultural history can be very complex, specially when gender issues are involved. What today seems as logical, was not so obvious than:  rape victims got blamed for the crime, as being the accomplice, as being the seductress. As said before, a rape victim would have trouble to find husband. In the movie her story is distorted beyond recognition.As for me: I am not an Artemisia expert, but I did research on her as an undergraduate student, as many did. She is an icon, and many students or scholars are very interested in her. Historians, art historians, cultural historians, gender and women studies people, students or experts: she is a very attractive subject of interest and research, no doubt. Her true life story is amazing.There is a lot of information about her accessible to a serious seeker. Hey, if I was able to read the translation of the rape trial transcripts, I doubt the director of the movie would have trouble to finding them either! This movie cheapens her achievements, she was quite an exception already when young. And Tassi was not teaching perspective to Artemisia. First, her own father was a better painter than Tassi, and was teaching her the craft, and Artemisia already was a genius while a teenager. She didn't need average painter to teach her. So, I really disliked the movie, those are my reasons.If you look for a movie about artist's life,a  fictionalized account from which you can learn something about how his/her life was, this is not a movie for this purpose. Yes the costumes are gorgeous, acting two stars, good camera work, but this it is. Unless you like a nice movie about a girl's sexual relationship, this can be enjoyable. But if you wan to see  a more satisfying movie about a painter, not the main character though, with even more beautiful pictures (they look like paintings by Dutch Masters), better acting, I recommend The Girl with the Pearl Earring.

496604,A2AV6S1DYKDWDB,B00000F160,Richard Burt,"[15, 20]","When the film came out in the U.S. in May, 1998, art historian Mary Garrard, who has written a book on Artemisia, along with feminist Gloria Steinnem put up a website attacking the film as untruthful in presenting  what they say was Artemisia's rape by her teacher, Agostino Tassi.  But as  feminist Germaine Greer points out in her chapter on Artemisia in her book  on women painters, the  Obstacle Race, the rape trial transcripts are not  transparent, and there is evidence that suport's Merlet's construction.  (They may be found in an appendix to Garrard's book.)  Garrard spins them  her way (Artemsia was raped, didn't love Tassi; Greer spins them hers  (Artemisia was raped, but came to love her rapist); Merlet spins them hers  (Merlet loved her rapist from the start). Merlet's account of Artemisia is  psychologically complex and is realy intersted in a feminism that departs  from the standard rape narrative (woman undone permanently by traumatic  experience caused by a man).  Garrrd's accpunt was savaged bya  number of  feminist reviewers, adn most recently calleneged (in a friendly way) by  Griselda Pollock in Differncing the Canon and by R. Ward Bissell in his  book, Artemisia Gentileschi. The film is one of many fictonal afterlives,  including a play by Sally Clark aind three novels, three of which have been  translated into English.  These are Anna Banti's, Marine Bramly's (the  basis for the film) and Alexandra Lapierre's.  They are entitled  _Artemisia_.  Raudi Jamis's French novel, also called Artemisia, has not  been translated.  In any case, taking Merlet's film on its terms and in  relation to alternative feminist readings of Artemisia's life and  paintings, I think one will find it intellectually refreshing in its  departures from American &quot;pop&quot; feminism, aesthetically pleasing,  and emotionally moving.

Agostino Tassi, likewise, was never the loving and caring person portrayed in this film but an opportunistic man who believed himself to be superior to all other artists of his time, and the reason he raped Artemisia was that a virtuous girl would ""pay"" a lot of money amongst friends, and the one who rid the girl of her virginity would win and ensure that the girl didn't find a suitable husband.  Yes, Artemisia did go to trial, and yes she was tortured, but all the while for her case against Agostino Tassi.

496608,A4N3GPYHOTFY3,B00000F160,"Susan E. Wood ""Susan""","[59, 72]","This film is a must-see for feminists and art historians although (or perhaps precisely BECAUSE) it may make you angry.  It is a beautiful, intensely sympathetic study of the young Artemisia Gentileschi, her struggles to learn and grow as an artist in a society that makes it very difficult for her to do so, and her relationships with the men in her life.  Artemisia has no desire to be the feminist role model that she later became (how could she?  The word and concept of &quot;feminism&quot; didn't exist in her day), she just needed to paint.  The part of this movie that infuriated feminists is its portrayal of her relationship with her much older and very disreputable teacher Tassi as consensual, rather than as a violent rape, followed by a relationship in which Artemisia reluctantly cooperated because he had promised her marriage.According to modern definitions, of course, Tassi was guilty of some form of rape, whether Artemisia said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; because she was only 17 at the oldest, and he took advantage of his position of power.  But there may be some truth in the movie's version of their relationship; Artemisia wouldn't be the first or the last young woman to have a crush on an older teacher, and to try out her powers of sexual attraction without fully understanding the consequences.  It's true that the movie probably whitewashes Tassi's character in order to portray his relationship with Artemisia as a love story.  In the actual trial transcript, Artemisia mocked him bitterly when they applied the thumb-screws to her hands during testimony, saying, &quot;This is the wedding ring you promised me!&quot;  If she had ever felt any affection for him, it was gone by then.  But if you allow the film some leeway for artistic license, it presents a fascinating study of how even a seemingly devastating experience like the rape trial and scandal could be part of an artist's growth.

According to the end of the movie, she was the first woman painter to be commissioned for her work. I decided to do a little research since to be honest, I haven't heard of her. I guess from the information I have found, this film is a romanticize version of her early life. In this film, she is shown to be a precocious minx who falls in love with Agostino Tassi, her mentor. What I've read, she was raped. I don't want to give too much away, you can Google information yourself before/after or instead of watching the movie. This film borders on pornography and to some viewers I'm sure it will be pornography. Even I'm not sure. So this will be offensive to some and definitely not for children. If anyone is interested in learning more about her, I personally would not recommend this movie. Read a book about her or check out a biography of her here on the internet.",3,"As a story and movie, it's...okay",1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,915,"['story', 'Artemisia', 'Gentileschi', 'According', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'painter', 'be', 'commissioned', 'work', 'decided', 'do', 'little', 'research', 'be', 'honest', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'guess', 'information', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'romanticize', 'version', 'early', 'life', 'film', 'shown', 'be', 'precocious', 'minx', 'who', 'love', 'Agostino', 'Tassi', 'mentor', 'What', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'raped', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'can', 'Google', 'information', 'before/after', 'instead', 'watching', 'movie', 'film', 'borders', 'pornography', 'viewers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'pornography', 'Even', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'offensive', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'personally', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Read', 'book', 'check', 'out', 'biography', 'here', 'internet']",Artemisia VHS
496610,AUTBHG6070SL4,B00000F160,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[6, 10]","This beautiful movie is founded on historical fact. Artemisia was a real woman, immensely talented, and truly someone who blazed a womanly trail in a man's world. Much past that, it's not at all clear how much fiction mixed in to make a watchable story.Ignoring any documentary failings, this does make fair drama. Her father encouraged and trained her as an artist into her teens. At that point, he knew that she needed other teachers, even though the schools were open only to men. He apparently didn't know that she was developing into a woman as well as an artist, or blotted that fact from his fatherly mind. He called on a talented co-worker to continue her training.Therein lies the complexity. That working relationship was already difficult because of professional jealousies, financial power-tripping, and jockeying for the commissions that paid the bills. Throw in a beautiful young lady who's just opening the doors to womanhood, and add a French scriptwriter. The result is tempestuous, and a net loss to all concerned: father, daughter, and tutor/lover. Artemisia's eventual happy ending happens long after the last scene, and appears only as a brief note before the credits.One point ties the whole of the movie together: the Artemisia character's singleness of mind, her total passion for visual image, even ahead of her physical passions. The father is the character that has my sympathy. He truly wanted what he thought was a good future for his daughter. I think no one was more horrified than him, not even Artemisia herself, at physical interrogation his legal action imposed on her.//wiredweird",4,Beautiful and inspiring,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,1616,"['beautiful', 'movie', 'founded', 'historical', 'fact', 'Artemisia', 'was', 'real', 'woman', 'immensely', 'talented', 'truly', 'someone', 'who', 'blazed', 'womanly', 'trail', 'man', 'world', 'Much', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'fiction', 'mixed', 'make', 'watchable', 'story.Ignoring', 'documentary', 'failings', 'make', 'fair', 'drama', 'father', 'encouraged', 'trained', 'artist', 'teens', 'point', 'knew', 'needed', 'other', 'teachers', 'even', 'schools', 'were', 'open', 'only', 'men', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'developing', 'woman', 'as', 'well', 'artist', 'blotted', 'fact', 'fatherly', 'mind', 'called', 'talented', 'co-worker', 'continue', 'training.Therein', 'complexity', 'working', 'relationship', 'was', 'already', 'difficult', 'professional', 'jealousies', 'financial', 'power-tripping', 'jockeying', 'commissions', 'paid', 'bills', 'Throw', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'just', 'opening', 'doors', 'womanhood', 'add', 'French', 'scriptwriter', 'result', 'tempestuous', 'net', 'loss', 'concerned', 'father', 'daughter', 'tutor/lover', 'Artemisia', 'eventual', 'happy', 'ending', 'happens', 'long', 'last', 'scene', 'only', 'brief', 'note', 'credits.One', 'point', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'Artemisia', 'character', 'singleness', 'mind', 'total', 'passion', 'visual', 'image', 'even', 'ahead', 'physical', 'passions', 'father', 'character', 'sympathy', 'truly', 'wanted', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'future', 'daughter', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'horrified', 'not', 'even', 'Artemisia', 'physical', 'interrogation', 'legal', 'action', 'imposed', 'her.//wiredweird']",Artemisia VHS
