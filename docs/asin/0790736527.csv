105406,A2S166WSCFIFP5,0790736527,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[1, 4]","Devil's Advocate is a well-written and well made film. Director Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman) controls his cast and camera well. The performances from Al Pacino and Charlize Theron are so strong, that they even bring Keanu Reeves up--yes, Keanu's acting is bad, and that accent is one of the worst I've heard--but with Pacino and Theron (and Connie Nielsen) surrounding him, it's easy to overlook. And the Devil's Advocate is a morality play. This isn't some effects monster, it's a story about right and wrong and the choices we make. It's a great film.The dvd contains a commentary track from the director, and it is one that is informative and entertaining. And there are something like over 30 minutes of extended scenes, but most of what is there is in the film. You see where he has cut snippets from scenes, and in reality, there are only a few deleted scenes here. Unfortunately the only way you can watch them is with a director's commentary. You just want the director to shut up, so that we can hear what is cut (most of what is cut is dialog, and you can't see how effective or not it is without the volume). And since the director feels that some of these are very important scenes, you'd think we would have an option to watch them without commentary. In addition to trailers, there are also notes on: cast & crew, special effects, the devil, John Milton (the poet, not the character), sin, and location.",5,strong film,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,1433,"['Devil', 'Advocate', 'well-written', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'Director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'cast', 'camera', 'well', 'performances', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'even', 'bring', 'Keanu', 'up', 'yes', 'Keanu', 'acting', 'bad', 'accent', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Pacino', 'Theron', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'surrounding', 'easy', 'overlook', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'morality', 'play', ""n't"", 'effects', 'monster', 'story', 'right', 'wrong', 'choices', 'make', 'great', 'film.The', 'dvd', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'one', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'are', 'something', '30', 'minutes', 'extended', 'scenes', 'most', 'what', 'film', 'see', 'where', 'cut', 'snippets', 'scenes', 'reality', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'watch', 'director', 'commentary', 'just', 'want', 'director', 'shut', 'up', 'can', 'hear', 'what', 'cut', 'most', 'what', 'cut', 'dialog', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'effective', 'not', 'volume', 'director', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'option', 'watch', 'commentary', 'addition', 'trailers', 'are', 'also', 'notes', 'cast', 'crew', 'special', 'effects', 'devil', 'John', 'Milton', 'poet', 'not', 'character', 'sin', 'location']",The Devil's Advocate VHS
105407,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,0790736527,Adi Adler,"[0, 0]","The basic theme of this movie is interesting - it focuses on one man's vanity. A lawyer in Gainesville, FL, Kevin Lomax has not lost a case. At the beginnig of the film he is defending a math teacher who presumably sexually assaulted one of his students. Kevin begins this case with a clear conscience, but discoveres the teacher is guilty at a crucial point in the trial - during the testimony of the girl herself. Kevin decides to defend the teacher nevertheless, and unmercifully attacks the young girl on the witness stand. He manages to create a reasonable doubt, based on several lies the girl told.Following this case, he is invited to help a big firm in NYC choose a jury, and gloriously wins once again - against all odds. He is then invited to join this firm.At first, this looks like a dream job. He gets an amazing salary, an amazingly large and beautiful new apartment... Kevin has all he needs to fit in, since he is being judged by his talent. But his wife, Mary Anne, finds herself over her head. Even though in her Gainesville life she is a confident woman, NYC proves too sophisticated for her - her tastes, her clothes, her hair - falls short of what her new friends have.Mary Anne starts falling apart, while Kevin finds himself busy with his work and attracted to a female co worker. Slowly they drift apart from each other, until the dramatic finale...Even though the ending is a little too much for me to accept, but the beginning could have made a pretty good film. But Keanu Reeves' even - more - wooden - than - the - usual acting, and the fact that Mary Anne's deterioration is seen in leaps and bounds instead of a gradual process ruin even that.This DVD has a lot of other material, including commentaries, deleted scenes and a thorough explanation of who and what is the devil...

105411,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790736527,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 6]","I hate Keanu Reeves.I have no shame in saying this, since all sane people feel the same way.  That isn't to say that he hasn't starred in some good movies.  The original `Matrix' was a very good film that still holds up today, and `Dracula' is one of the finest horror films ever made.  Still, regardless of his filmography (which really isn't entirely impressive to be honest) he is a horrid actor who hasn't EVER delivered a `great' or even `good' performance.That really dampens the appeal that `The Devil's Advocate' could have had.  Add to the mix a hammed up Al Pacino and you have a film that could have used a different ensemble (well, you can keep Charlize Theron) in order to be truly inspired.  The storyline isn't anything remarkable, and the whole `Satan is a lawyer' is kind of obvious, but the spirited art direction and slick visuals could have made for an engaging thriller.  The screenplay doesn't try hard enough to do anything special, and that ending is a total copout (LAZY).  Sadly, Pacino relishes too much in the over the top, and while some seem to be lauding this choice I find it far too on the nose of who he has become as an actor.  It's like Jack Nicholson playing the Joker; too obvious.  Theron is a beauty, even in her early stardom, and Connie Nielson will make you drop your jaw; but at the end of the day this one gets drug down by its mismatched co-stars, one of which bores you to tears and the other who seems to think every word is a piece of steak he needs to gnaw to death.",2,The Devil and Mr. Insomniac...,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,1516,"['hate', 'Keanu', 'Reeves.I', 'have', 'shame', 'saying', 'sane', 'people', 'feel', 'same', 'way', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'starred', 'good', 'movies', 'original', 'Matrix', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'still', 'today', 'Dracula', 'one', 'finest', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Still', 'regardless', 'filmography', 'really', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'impressive', 'be', 'honest', 'horrid', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'EVER', 'delivered', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'really', 'appeal', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Add', 'mix', 'hammed', 'up', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'have', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'different', 'ensemble', 'well', 'can', 'keep', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'order', 'be', 'truly', 'inspired', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'anything', 'remarkable', 'whole', 'Satan', 'lawyer', 'kind', 'obvious', 'spirited', 'art', 'direction', 'slick', 'visuals', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'engaging', 'thriller', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'do', 'anything', 'special', 'ending', 'total', 'copout', 'LAZY', 'Sadly', 'Pacino', 'too', 'much', 'top', 'seem', 'be', 'lauding', 'choice', 'find', 'far', 'too', 'nose', 'who', 'become', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'playing', 'Joker', 'too', 'obvious', 'Theron', 'beauty', 'even', 'early', 'stardom', 'Connie', 'Nielson', 'will', 'make', 'drop', 'jaw', 'end', 'day', 'one', 'drug', 'down', 'mismatched', 'co-stars', 'one', 'tears', 'other', 'who', 'think', 'word', 'piece', 'steak', 'gnaw', 'death']",The Devil's Advocate VHS

105420,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0790736527,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[35, 41]","This movie is actually a shocking wake up call in the moral department. If you follow my reviews, you know that I dislike modern shoot em up movies. But setting this aside, it is interesting how many movies inspire the wrong values. (Shoot everybody up, take down who stands in your way, fall in love, and live happily ever after. I could go on and on, but so many movies fall into this category.) Well, ""The Devil's Advocate"" seems to be a reaction against the amoral filth that often comes out of the movie theatres. The basic theme of this movie according to its director is: ""Do I do the right thing, or do I survive?""The story starts at a  courtroom in Florida. Lawyer Kevin Lomax realizes that his client is really guilty, but after a bit of taunting, he gets his client off anyway, and it's not hard to see that satisfying his ego was the main reason he did so. Well, Kevin gets an offer from a law firm in New York City to pick a jury for a client who DID steal millions. Again, Kevin comes through. The leader of this city firm John Milton (Al Pacino) then offers Kevin a job with a tempting salary. So far, this all seems part of the 'American Dream.' (Play some moral games to get to the top if you need to.) Apparently Kevin has gotten there, but the story is FAR from over. Sadly, some vital scenes were deleted for the purpose of time. (One is where Al Pacino says: ""Leave morals to God. We have a job to do."" Another sadly deleted scene is where Kevin's wife Mary Anne is sent into a room where sexual amoral games are going on.)At the risk of over simplifying a bit, with Al Pacino's well timed appearances, it becomes clear that the more moral games Kevin is willing to play, the further he can go. It is interesting that about half way through the movie, Kevin starts to treat his moral and religious mother with disrespect, and that the marriage between Kevin and Mary Anne starts to have serious problems. An obvious example is when Mary Anne gets a beautiful cut and dye hair job,  but Kevin calls it: 'radical' and 'traumatic.' Why? He already has his eyes on other women. (Notably Christa Bella.) Another sadly deleted scene is where it was obvious that if Christa Bella had been present at the dance club, Kevin would have been willing to engage in adultery. The once happy marriage with Mary Anne has become a burden to him. (This is obvious when during a phone call, he lies to her about being at work and starts to get very short with her.)Well, Kevin continues to take the money as well as other things, at the expense of his morals. It is not until he realizes that his new client Alexander, IS guilty of several murders that his conscience starts to wake up. But even if our conscience has awakened, will we listen to it, or will we survive? Kevin realizes that after you have played too many moral games, backing out isn't so easy. And it isn't long before he realizes that Al Pacino is in fact the DEVIL. Perhaps the most frightening moment in this movie is when Kevin tries to blame the devil for everything that happened to him, and the devil can HONESTLY reply: ""Wait a minute. Who MADE those decisions?""Another frightening thing about this movie is that we probably all have played moral games in our lives, and this movie confronts us with things we are probably ALL guilty of. Forget the grotesque devils and demons in horror movies who can make you do things. Any priest or nun will say that evil is simply the absence of God. And if the devil did make an appearance, he could very well appear fatherly and likable. And he probably would say things that SOUND good.

105426,A2WI503YTC6S2C,0790736527,con kangas,"[0, 0]","I watched The Devil's Advocate on TV on the evening of Wednesday, the 25th February, 2014. It brought back memories as i loved the film in 1997.Watching it again, and on TV with the annoying advertisements, a simple truth dawned on me. The film works on many levels and its flaws, are not actual flaws, but clever devices to highlight the fact that society's declining morality is justified through the ""law."" The Pacino character clearly states, ""the law allows me to touch everything and everybody."" He cleverly stays away from Spiritual law.The Devil's Advocate main strength is that we""don't see him coming."" Remember, this is the Devil's main advertising tool - I don't exist. The producer cleverly uses our own apathy against us. Read the 1 and 2 Star reviews. I laugh when people write and say ""I worked out quickly that Al Pacino's character John Milton is the Devil.Dear 1 and 2 Star reviewers -  Uou're supposed to work out that Milton is the Devil. His very name tells you this. People being apathetically lazy forget that Paradise Lost was written by John Milton and Satan is the ""hero"".The film works on many levels, and, as a student of gnosis, I know that the ego, or their true pluralized form, ""the Ego's"" are the devils platform. Pacino brilliantly talks about this leading up to the death of the managing director - Eddie Barzoum. As the Pacino/Devil says ""you get human desire to the levels where it can split atoms .... and build ego's as big as Cathedrals .... And connect these ego's with Greed, Lust, Envy and in this case the Devil's favourite sin .... Vanity.The relationship with the main character Kevin Lomax (Keanu) and his beautiful wife (Charlize Thereon) deteriorated whilst in New York, his relationship with his mother - fragile at best - is also in a downward spiral, yet his relationship with his boss/mentor improves. Temptation through vanity is flowing through Kevin's veins. His ego is being massaged - 64 straight wins in Florida - by Milton and he successfully becomes the lead defence lawyer on a triple murder homicide. Kevin can taste the legal victory but cannot save his wife.Charlize's deterioration:  Charlize also ""sees'. She sees her new female friends in NY in the ""change rooms' whilst trying on new outfits. Naked in the change rooms and touching their bodies sensually she sees their true demonic nature. Charlize sees her new closest BFF's as the demons they truly are, freaks out and leaves.John Milton:  Charlize starts to see through Milton and she is brutally punished vai mental affliction. These are the scenes that leave us in no doubt, who Milton is. Like Keanu we are drawn in by his master of the universe smile and humanist approach.  Charlize goes from bad to worse mentally, and ends up in a psychiatric wing of a hospital with horrifying consequences.The relationship with Charlize was Keanu's only real shot at salvation. Love of course being the ""real"" factor within the relationship. Love offsets the selfishness Kevin has been drawn into, even when given an out. Pacino tells him that hhe wil relieve of the case but Keanu onjects. Furthermore, Kevin lusts after a very attractive female partner of whom we discover is his ""sister"". Even whilst making love to his wife he fanatsizes about this partner.. In fact he asks Milton as he is preparing to perform a depraved act, ""what about love?"".... Overrated yells out the Devil ... continue .... and adds quote  ""love is like eating too much chocolate as it affects the same part of the brain.The Anti-Christ - Kevin is fully wake when Milton tells him quietly that his ""son' will sit at the head of all he tables on earth. Kevin replies ""the anti-Christ"" which Pacino quickly glosses over ...""whatever"" he says. Keanu realizes that he loves his wife, does not want to father the anti-Christ.  Kevin/Keanu reminds ""dad"" that in the Bible, the Devil loses. Kevin doesn't like to lose and makes a bizzare choice. Chick, chick ..... boom.SPOILER ALERT - do NOT READ the next line if you have not seen the movie released 17 years ago. When Kevin/Keanu kills himself, which is an act of selfishness how can he justify this ? This is my main criticism of the film, as suicide is the ultimate act of selfishness, how can it have redeeming ""selfless"" qualities.Director's Cut perhaps.-  The ending is weak. I don't like it was all a dream and temptation. It should have borrowed ideas from the by then, ten year old masterpiece Angel Heart. Angel Heart  ends on a morally ambiguous point with horrific results for that films protagonist.  The Devil's Advocate is for the most part, excellent, as its message is morally ambiguity comes across well, yet it fails to deliver this in its ending.4 Stars - I am being over generous. It could however have been 5 stars if the ending had better been thought out. This is the genius of The Devil's Advocate. The movie comes across as part thriller, part court room drama, part morality tale and part - a fight for one's soul.",4,They Won't see Me Coming,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,4981,"['watched',

Keanu Reeves has as much range as a snail on an ice cube; here he plays a ""can't lose"" Southern barrister suddenly recruited to a big-time Manhattan law firm.  Charlize Theron plays the apprehensive wife--the insecure, clinging frump who quickly unravels once the couple moves to the Big Apple, and who starts to discover the devil's in the details.  Al Pacino plays Lucifer--more on that later.  And all of this utter nonsense whirls chaotically towards the Showdown:  the confrontation between Keanu's petulant character and Beezlebub--in an oversized office with moving sculptures on the walls.  The scheming Satan calls forth a sizzling Connie Nielsen (wolf howl) to seduce Keanu, which (of course) will produce the Grandson Antichrist bent to destroy the world; to cement the seduction Frank Sinatra music is piped in.No, I'm not making this up.  If I had, I would be even more messed up than the circumstances of DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.  Again, weak sauce, but. . .Al Pacino is absolutely delightful.  Playing uber lawyer John Milton (oh, you gotta love that irony), Pacino is rowdy, incorrigible, maniacal, malevolent, abhorrent, charming, and often witty to the max.  Sporting yellow teeth the length of a Madagascar rodent and an evil smirk that would peel plaster, the viewer can tell Pacino relished this role as the sulking and ornery Evil One.  Pacino dominates every scene he's in, which is darn good; otherwise there wouldn't be a film to salvage, making the DEVIL'S ADVOCATE CD a grand frisbee to throw about the living room.--D.

What DOES matter is the calibre of the lawyers that reside on both sides of the judiciary fence.  This movie takes that dictum and pushes it to the edge of the envelope.One of the most intriguing facets of the storyline is an implicit question that the film compels us to ask ourselves:  Who is worse off?  A prosecutor who is  so good that he gets an innocent man executed or put away for life?  Or a defense lawyer who is so good that he gets a guilty man off the hook, after which time he hurts or kills someone else?  It is a question that must enter the minds of all who exercise the art of legalistic oratory at some point or other.Al Pacino is without question the highlight of the flick.  It is obvious that he takes great delight in playing the devil himself, and it shows in his performance.  It is a role that is ideally suited to his demeanor.  A nice touch was making his name John Milton, which is an allusion to the English poet who authored PARADISE LOST.  This is the poem that detailed Satan's fall from heaven as well as Adam & Eve's fall from the Garden of Eden.  As a sidenote, I would HIGHLY recommend PARADISE LOST;  there are a couple of references to the work itself during the story.It was rather painful to see Keanu Reeves occasionally try to fake a southern accent, but this was not his worst performance.  There is a surprising amount of nudity in the film, and that's always a good thing.  This is ESPECIALLY true in any film which features Charlize Theron!All in all this is a fun film to pick up, especially if you're into the Faustian man-selling-his-soul-to-Satan genre.

He has everything going for him, including a gorgeous wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Things couldn't be better...that is, until Kevin is offered a dream job in a prestigious New York law firm. Not missing the opportunity, he and Mary Ann relocate to NY and start a new life there. He soon meets his boss, John Milton (Al Pacino), the head honcho of the law firm. But what Kevin doesn't know is that John is the Devil in disguise, and will sell his soul to him even before he knows he's done so. How does John do it? Simply, by offering Kevin the 3 most basic human desires (even if we might not always admit it to ourselves) - sex, power and money. Kevin soon realizes what he's done and how it has affected his and Mary Ann's life, but it's too late.I really don't understand the people who bash this movie. I think it's one of the best thrillers to come out in recent times, with solid performances from everyone, yes, including Keanu Reeves (gasp!). Ok, so he's not the greatest actor in the world. But we gotta cut him some slack here...can ANY actor take the spotlight when working with Al Pacino? I doubt it. Reeves manages to pull off his role quite well, and I would argue without hesitation that this movie is one of his best. Charlize Theron does a fantastic job as Mary Ann, and I won't complain about her nude scene one bit. She's simply beautiful, even when she becomes mentally ill and enters the hospital, having no makeup on and looking like she spent the last 4 hours crying her eyes out. They should have known that it's impossible to make her look unattractive. Just can't happen, you silly film-makers! And of course Al Pacino. He's just perfect as the Devil, even if somewhat over-the-top in a few scenes.Anyone looking for a cool, slick and enjoyable horror movie should check out ""The Devil's Advocate.""

For this film they obviously filled in the blanks with Rosemary's Baby and The Firm. Unfortunately, this was not a match made in heaven.To tell the truth, I liked the film. Al Pacino was perfect as the Devil, and for once I did not mind Keanu Reeves. The production values were wonderful, the sound track compelling, and the directing was tight. The problem, as I stated earlier, was that the match between lawyers and sheer Evil was not made in heaven. Why? Well, first of all, everyone knows what the difference between a catfish and a lawyer is. (One is a scum-sucking bottom-feeder - the other is a fish.) Spelling it out was really not necessary. And everyone also knows what the Devil is (Evil) , so spelling that out (in a very long monologue) was also not necessary.To have made this film really good, they should have dropped one half or the other of this star-crossed marriage. My choice would have been to drop the overdone legal aspects and concentrate more on the Evil. The special effects (women turning into demons) were excellent - the movie simply needed more along those lines. The plot, accordingly, needed to revolve less around various courtroom ethical dramas - all of which have been dealt with in other films at great length - and more on the personal drama. As it was, it was difficult to get too invested in the marital problems encountered by the Lomaxes.All in all, I'd say this movie was entertaining and worth watching if you have an evening to kill.

It was excellent! Well, I  already knew that because Al Pacino was in it. I mean, have you ever seen a movie with Al Pacino in it that was not  first rate? Well, I haven't.The ""Devil's Advocate"" was one of those court and lawyer dramas, and I've always sort of liked them. Well, this one started out that same way with Reeves playing a brilliant young attorney who had never lost a case, either as a prosecutor or as a defender. Well, he finally met his match in trying to defend a child molester and he went off totally distraught into the courthouse rest room. To add to his distress a colleague insulted him with a cheap vocal gesture. Then strange things began  to happen. The movie turned somewhat surrealistic, then gradually became ever more so. All of a  sudden he became a number one Florida attorney and was courted by one of the top law firms in New York City. He and his wife were invited to NYC and given the royal treatment. He was hired at the salary of his asking and accommodated with the finest available apartment furnished to his liking. The law firm fell all over themselves in giving him anything he might want. All he needed to do was ask. He began working on some of the biggest, thorniest cases and began to win them, all watched over carefully by Al Pacino, the president of the law  firm. Things just couldn't be any better, but it was bizarre and totally out of the range of the common experience, even for a highly-touted recruit. Then some really  really weird things started happening. Among the very weirdest, it became revealed that Pacino, his boss, was actually his father looking over him and in a  stunningly strange twist, a remarkably beautiful law office employee was a half-daughter of President Pacino. Hold on, it gets weirder. Then Pacino announced that his half-daughter was ovulating and he wanted Reeves, his half-son, to mate with her and for them to bear a child who might take over the law firm upon his retirement. Well, it gets weirder still. My head started spinning from the  whole experience of watching this bizarre story unfold. I began  wondering, ""What is this?"" This story has no credibility at all! I even  considered  shutting it off and going off to sleep. This whole elaborate scenario was just beyond the capabilities of my imagination.At just about when I was going to give it all up and go to bed, the movie took a final quick and strange twist and I burst out in a muffled laugh and realized I had gone through one of the best movies I had experienced in years.

No matter how repugnant the crime, no matter how guilty the defendant, Kevin Lomax has the power to mesmerize the jury into accepting his arguments, buying into his logic, being convinced by his charisma; and freeing his clients. Soon after he has successfully won the case, where he defended an obviously guilty child molester, Lomax is invited to New York, where a powerful law firm has become aware of the Florida hotshot's acquittal record. Here he meets John Milton (Al Pacino), the founder and head of &quot;Milton, Chadewick, Waters&quot;, a mysterious and powerful law firm with contacts and clients all over the world. It is this charismatic and charming man that opens the door to a completely different world; a world of luxury and pleasure, wealth and power; a world of endless possibilities. This is heaven on earth. But as Lomax tastes the power of being a wealthy New York attorney, something in him changes. Winning is no longer just a goal; it becomes an obsession. Soon he starts to realize that things are not what they seem to be; and all the things he once had and cared about -a happy marriage with Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), his relationship with his mother, all his happiness - everything disappear amidst the sparkling illusion of paradise. He suddenly realizes that Heaven and Hell can co-exist at the same place and at the same time.I do not intend to reveal anything else, since all of the interesting surprises will be presented in the intense and inspiring climax. This is probably Reeves' best performance. He manages to create a believable character - a kind of example, a role model for the American way of life. Kevin's wife, Mary Ann, is most likely the hardest character to play, since she goes through a complex and difficult emotional evolution. From being strong, devoted and ambitious (a female copy of her husband) to vulnerable, hurt and on the verge of madness. Charlize Theron gracefully floats into this character.

The acting is genius of course with Keanu Reeves pretty good, Charlize Theron great and Al Pacino DAZZLING. Al Pacino will leave you speechless in what I dare to say is his best performance ever. To tell you the truth, this movie is in my top 15 of all time right now. It is wonderfully made and is trully unforgettable.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hot shot lawyer in Florida living with his gorgeous wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). The opening scene is wonderfully though out and includes an event crucial to the movie (that you'll figure out later on). Lomax has spent his life putting criminals away and releasing them. He doesn't care what they've done but he does care about hi paycheck. When he gets a huge offer..he moves to New York with his wife where John Milton (Al Pacino) is his mentor. Lomax now trully has the perfect life..right?Milton turns out to be more than Lomax bargained for but Lomax stands blinded while his wife is made out as being insane by all that she claims to see.The ending has an ingenious twist and gives the movie a terrific finish. The movie ends out being extremely powerful and thought provoking and left me thinking one thing.Can you ever evade sin?The Devil's Advocate is a daring thriller with clever courtroom trials and so much more. Pacino obviously had a blast doing this movie and really made it even more worthwile.So, please watch this movie..let alone for Pacino..but it's not just the acting...it's a splendid movie that I consider to be one of the best out there.

A successful provincial lawyer is integrated in the New York lawfirm of the devil himself who wants to have the best lawyers in order to get as many guilty people acquitted to fill the world with criminals and other evil people. There are many twists in the story but altogether the young lawyer is going to discover that he cannot go on with his work there because he does not want to sacrifice, that's the price, all his private life and even his soul, to have power and money. He is thus insensitive to the argument of domination, his domination over the world. In other words he lacks ambition in a way, that passion that is so cannibalistic that you have to eat everything that is dear to you to satisfy it, even your own mother if necessary. It shows society is full of such people. It is a criticism of society at this level. So the young lawyer decides to drop out of a case he was sure to win when he realizes his client is guilty and that he cannot defend that kind of guilt since if he is acquitted he will move to a real murder and not only a sexual offense, on teenage girls. But, and here the film becomes the advocate of teh devil, if this young man refuses ambition, power, money, then he can be tempted another way and this time in his little provincial city : the devil uses vanity as the bait to his trap. And it works in no time. In other words the devil is nothing really. In society there will always be someone to tempt you with one passion or another, they used to call that sins, and you will give in. The devil is not an extraneous being but he is part and parcel of the human constitution in society. Human society is a constant array of temptations to any person to be different, to become more something and anything, powerful, famous, rich, even more virtuous and that will lead to more passion in society, it will emulate a lot of imitators and competition. The devil will thus triumph easily. The film does not say how we can stop him.

The story is simple enough; a young fireball of a lawyer, Kevin Lomax, played by Keanu Reeves, who has never lost a case, finds himself in the middle of every defense attorney's nightmare, representing a slimy sleazeball accused of molesting little girls. Halfway through the trial he realizes his client is guilty as hell, which presents him with a dilemma: he can extend his winning streak at the price of losing his soul; or he can do the right thing at the possible risk of torpedoing his career. What's a young, up and coming hotshot to do? In no time at all, he and his beautiful, fatally naive wife (excellently played by Charlize Theron) are off to New York, where he has been recruited to work for a high-powered law firm headed by a omnilingual, diabolically clever lawyer named John Milton (Al Pacino looks like he had the time of his life in this role) and staffed by a bunch of hell-bound associates. While Kevin's career takes off, his wife descends into a miasma of loneliness, despair and finally madness; and when Kevin berates Milton for driving his wife into her personal hell, Milton reminds Kevin that God, whom Milton fears as much as he hates, gave us all a left-handed gift called free will; we are free to make our own choices, and we have to live with the consequences. As the feller says, you can't win 'em all.  The film runs somewhat overlong but holds our interest throughout. There are many good performances in this movie and a few excellent ones, but when all is said and done, the film belongs to Al Pacino and his gleefully wicked portrayal of the devil incarnate.  Kevin is finally left to make his own choice, which I'm not going to give away here; suffice to say that the film's resolution is a shock.

It's a movie that has about everything a movie can fit;Good plot, solid twists, horror/gore, drama, comedy, great performances, and lots of sex and nudity. The movie stars Oscar winners Al Pacino (Best Actor, ""Scent of a Woman"") and Charlize Theron (Best Actress, ""Monster""), as well as Keanu Reeves ('Speed') in performances that could've easily garrnered them Oscar nominations. The movie begins with us meeting Kevin Lomax (Reeves), an ace lawyer who is defending a teacher who has apparently molested one of his students. Despite knowing that the man is guilty, Lomax wins the case and at an after party is approached for a job opportunity in New York. With his wife Mary Ann (Theron) in tow, Lomax heads to New York where he meets John Milton (Pacino), who (and pardon the reference) makes Lomax an offer he can't refuse. Pretty soon, Lomax is handling Milton's firms biggest cases and lives in a beautiful apartment; But things are falling apart. Mary Ann is slipping into insanity, have hallucinations and such; And Kevin can't stop thinking about a co-worker named Christabella (Connie Nielsen, who once again manages to disappear into the role). In case you hadn't figured this out by the title, Milton also happens to be the devil. And that's all I can really say about the plot. The movie runs 142 minutes, without the credits, and there are times where it feels overbloated; Like certain scenes could've been trimmed. But overall, especially with the perfectly over-the-top performance from Pacino, the movie is satisfying and entertaining enough. The final plot twist is a bit stupid, but it doesn't matter because it occurs three seconds before the film ends. The dialogue, especially the speeches that we hear mostly from Pacino, is spectacular. With the help of composer James Newton Howard ('Batman Begins'), this is one of director Taylor Hackford's best films.GRADE: A-NARROWLY ESCAPES: B+",5,One of Al Pacino's Best Performances,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1999,"['director', 'Ray', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'movie', 'almost', 'everyone', 'seen', 'movie', 'everything', 'movie', 'can', 'fit', 'Good', 'plot', 'solid', 'twists', 'horror/gore', 'drama', 'comedy', 'great', 'performances', 'lots', 'sex', 'nudity', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Monster', 'as', 'well', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', ""'Speed"", 'performances', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'garrnered', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'movie', 'meeting', 'Kevin', 'Lomax', 'Reeves', 'ace', 'lawyer', 'who', 'defending', 'teacher', 'who', 'apparently', 'molested', 'one', 'students', 'knowing', 'man', 'guilty', 'Lomax', 'case', 'party', 'approached', 'job', 'opportunity', 'New', 'York', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Theron', 'tow', 'Lomax', 'heads', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'John', 'Milton', 'Pacino', 'who', 'pardon', 'reference', 'Lomax', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Lomax', 'handling', 'Milton', 'firms', 'biggest', 'cases', 'beautiful', 'apartment', 'things', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'slipping', 'insanity', 'have', 'hallucinations', 'such', 'Kevin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Christabella', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'manages', 'disappear', 'role', 'case', 'had', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'title', 'Milton', 'also', 'be', 'devil', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'plot', 'movie', '142', 'minutes', 'credits', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'overbloated', 'certain', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trimmed', 'overall', 'especially', 'perfectly', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Pacino', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'final', 'plot', 'twist', 'bit', 'stupid', ""n't"", 'matter', 'three', 'seconds', 'film', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'speeches', 'hear', 'mostly', 'Pacino', 'spectacular', 'help', 'composer', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', 'one', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'best', 'films.GRADE', 'A-NARROWLY', 'ESCAPES', 'B+']",The Devil's Advocate VHS

He does a brilliant job of playing Satan, Lucifer, the Devil, John Milton, little old man, the Antichrist, the main man, whatever you wanna call him. It also stars a bumbling idiot (Jeffrey Jones), the lovely Keanu Reeves, the equally lovely Charlize Theron, and small but almost painful scenes featuring Heather Matarazzo. Keanu has a rather severe hair cut in this, whereas Charlize's hair looks so much better longer.Keanu & Charlize have great chemistry in this, they're newly weds and still in the first throes of love. You can just tell their characters are wanting to rip off each other's clothes and christen every room - twice! They both starred again in Sweet November.The film is roughly 2 hours long - unless you're like me and skip the scene where Eddie Barzoon gets killed, as it's pointless and unnecessary to the whole film, much like the character. This may be off-putting for some people, but the film absolutely flies by and you're wanting the story to continue.Charlize quickly descends in schizophrenia in this movie and to prepare for her disturbing role in the film, she spent an hour a day over the three-month shooting period in NYC with a psychotherapist to ""practice schizophrenia"". She plays it magnificently, although the ill fitting brown wig doesn't suit her, and you really feel for her throughout most of the film. She's in a strange town, with an empty apartment to fill, and her hubby hasn't been home long enough to ""knock her up"". She also starts thinking that John Milton slept with her when he didn't, and ends up her taking her own life. One of the best scenes in this movie, it proves to any doubters that Keanu Reeves really can act! (There's a lot of them out there, believe me)Al Pacino joins a long line of great actors in incarnating the Antichrist in the name of entertainment, including: Robert De Niro (in Angel Heart), Jack Nicholson (in The Witches Of Eastwick), Gabriel Byrne (in End Of Days) and even Sam Neill (in Omen III: The Final Conflict).This movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, that's how powerful and disturbing it is.

105504,A9JA0MI0GFQ39,0790736527,Mike Blaszczak,"[3, 6]","This is a brilliant movie. While most people point out that it decries the negative aspects of greed, they miss the fact that the plot is really about work ethic.Kianu's wooden performance as a small-town lawyer shows us a man who works hard but who's career hasn't taken off. A chance meeting with a recruiter takes him to New York City, where he strikes the fancy of the senior partner in a giant law firm.He loses himself in the overwhelming opportunities that await him. His wife initially relishes in the fruits of his labor--a beautiful apartment, nice clothing, a busy social life--but soon starts regretting the loss of time she could spend with her husband and the lack of intimacy in her relationship. She retreats into herself and wallows; she doesn't try to find any new outlets, and all of her problems smoulder within her.Charlize Theron, who plays that wife, is quite attractive. Her performance, mostly half the movie as a woman slipping into terror, dispair, and and dimentia, is very good. But Al Pacino, who plays the evil senior partner, steals the show. Each of his great movies features at least one long monologue of incredible power and control. This movie features three or four; he is a brilliant orator and an excellent actor. Because Kianu's character has little dynamic range, Kianu's weak acting doesn't sabotage the film.The movie's inside out ending will leave many wanting. But I found it interesting and throughful.Funny thing is, I didn't find this movie enjoyable. The plot line and the subject are troubling to me and that has me watching the movie with some amount of stress. It combines elements of drama and horror in very balanced portions. But as an experience, I found it quite disturbing--and I'm not normally that sensitive to such things. It's very entertaining, but it certainly isn't an escapist film.The audio quality is below average for a DVD; the dialogue is moderated well, but the sound effects and ambient sounds are almost completely lost. The video quality is average. There's lots of poorly managed editing, and some terribly executed lighting, which the DVD production doesn't use to convey any ambience or tone. It just comes off as a mistake.

105505,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,0790736527,Mike,"[2, 6]","""The Devils Advocate"" (1997)I used to like The Devil's Advocate. I used to think it was everything a movie needed. Then I saw it again, and I can safely say I wasn't really that impressed. This movie is necessarily bad, but its not great either, its on the so-so level of filmmaking. But with a great cast, a neat idea and promising adverts, The Devil's Advocate should've been much more.I'll start with the things that really got to me the second time round. One of those things was the acting in the film. Keanu Reeves is not my most favoured actor around today. Unfortunately with The Devil's Advocate, Keanu can just tick off another character he can't play - a lawyer. Reeves provided no suspense or fun with his performance, and he just really bugged me. Charlize Theron overacts horribly. At the start Theron is very good, but after she falls under the spell of the devil (Pacino), her character gets very mentally unstable and Theron goes over the top. Jeffrey Jones's character was just there to be another infamous cast member, but I thought his character was boring and I didn't find his performance as enjoyable or stylish as his other roles. Pacino is the only leading cast member who is able to find some juiciness to his character, and he is a greatly entertaining Satan. There is no comparison to his other performances, but he's pretty cool in this role.The lead character is another problem with the film. You might be able to put this under the ""Keanu-Reeves-can't-act-category"", but Reeve's Lomax is a dumb leading man who always puts himself first and is a selfish and senseless idiot. I feel this problem may be more with the silly and recycled script than Reeve's acting, but the film suffered because of it.The ending is probably the worst thing about the movie. Not only is it totally confusing and typical, but it takes the easy way out. The Devil's Advocate is not a movie that can challenge itself. It always has to finish sequences by taking the quick way instead of giving the audience something to think about.All that said, there is always the stylish directing, some good visuals and special effect sequences, nicely done law scenes (which are strangled by Reeve's over-acting) and a few excellent and very modern editing. The movie looks and feels great. All this is unfortunately mustered and busted by the horrid character development, lots and lots of plot holes and the fact that the film actually has no message. Maybe its good to see how people react to temptation in some scenes, but I came out of the film still really confused about what the movie was actually about and why the hell all the stuff that happened in the film was really happening. So, my conclusion of The Devil's Advocate is this: a poor excuse to see lots of nudity and sex scenes. Miss this over-long bore, even if Connie Neilsen naked is a bonus.MY GRADE: C",2,The devil made me do it...,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,2869,"['Devils', 'Advocate', '1997', 'used', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'everything', 'movie', 'needed', 'Then', 'saw', 'again', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'impressed', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'so-so', 'level', 'filmmaking', 'great', 'cast', 'neat', 'idea', 'promising', 'adverts', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'things', 'really', 'got', 'second', 'time', 'round', 'One', 'things', 'was', 'acting', 'film', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'not', 'most', 'favoured', 'actor', 'today', 'Unfortunately', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'Keanu', 'can', 'just', 'tick', 'off', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'lawyer', 'provided', 'suspense', 'fun', 'performance', 'just', 'really', 'bugged', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'horribly', 'start', 'Theron', 'very', 'good', 'spell', 'devil', 'Pacino', 'character', 'very', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'Theron', 'top', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'be', 'infamous', 'cast', 'member', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'performance', 'enjoyable', 'stylish', 'other', 'roles', 'Pacino', 'only', 'leading', 'cast', 'member', 'who', 'able', 'find', 'juiciness', 'character', 'greatly', 'entertaining', 'Satan', 'comparison', 'other', 'performances', 'pretty', 'cool', 'role.The', 'lead', 'character', 'problem', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'put', ""Keanu-Reeves-can't-act-category"", 'Reeve', 'Lomax', 'dumb', 'leading', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'first', 'selfish', 'senseless', 'idiot', 'feel', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'silly', 'recycled', 'script', 'Reeve', 'acting', 'film', 'suffered', 'it.The', 'ending', 'probably', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'totally', 'confusing', 'typical', 'easy', 'way', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'not', 'movie', 'can', 'challenge', 'always', 'finish', 'sequences', 'taking', 'quick', 'way', 'instead', 'giving', 'audience', 'something', 'think', 'said', 'always', 'stylish', 'directing', 'good', 'visuals', 'special', 'effect', 'sequences', 'nicely', 'done', 'law', 'scenes', 'are', 'strangled', 'Reeve', 'over-acting', 'few', 'excellent', 'very', 'modern', 'editing', 'movie', 'great', 'unfortunately', 'mustered', 'busted', 'horrid', 'character', 'development', 'lots', 'lots', 'plot', 'holes', 'fact', 'film', 'actually', 'message', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'temptation', 'scenes', 'came', 'out', 'film', 'still', 'really', 'confused', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'about', 'why', 'hell', 'stuff', 'happened', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'So', 'conclusion', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'poor', 'excuse', 'see', 'lots', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Miss', 'over-long', 'bore', 'even', 'Connie', 'Neilsen', 'naked', 'bonus.MY', 'GRADE', 'C']",The Devil's Advocate VHS

A braver film would have examined these issues on a more  intimate scale. The Devil's Advocate is an overought, occasionally riveting  and always entertaining film that has little time for subtlety.We are  introduced to Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a brilliant Flordia lawyer who is  summoned by huge New York firm to help them pick the jury for a particular  case. He meets the head of the firm John Milton (Al Pacino), and in a  spectacular scene, standing next to a waterfall ontop of a skyscraper  Milton offers Lomax a job. &quot;Are we negotiating?&quot; asks Lomax.  &quot;Always&quot; replies Milton. As the film goes on, the wicked ways of  the firm take their toll on Lomax and his wife. The religious imagery has  become the norm for thrillers these days, and by naming the prince of  darkness after the 17th Century Puritan poet John Milton who wrote  &quot;And out of good still to find means of evil&quot;, the film is given  that Exorcist like edge. The suggestion that evil hides behind an apparent  good, such as wealth for example.As Satan, Pacino has an obscenely  good time.

The film itself is great, with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Kevin Lomax, a hotshot lawyer who gets his chance to work in Pacino's lawfirm.  The beautiful Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen give good performances as well, especially Theron as Reeves' wife who senses something foul afoot, and eventually starts to lose her mind.

He's lured up to NYC by Al Pacino's evil law firm, which is staffed by a variety of demons who are also top lawyers.

105515,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0790736527,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","Before I start droning on let's make this clear first:I have an Al Pacino fetish. Scarface and Carlito's Way are some of the best movies in cinematic history. If anyone could actually believe Pacino was NOT a good actor I would probably drop dead from shock right there. This man DEMANDS the cameras attention full-force. Hell, I've even seen movies I probably wouldn't have usually liked if he wasn't in them. As if you couldn't tell Al Pacino is my favorite actor.Anyway, enough with the rambling about him and onto spewing random thoughts into the review.Al Pacino (ahem) is perfect for this role. Going in from the start (due to previews, the cover synopsis, word of mouth) we basically know who Pacino is supposed to be in this movie. What we don't know at first is how the hell Keanu Reeves as Kevin Lomax plays into the whole picture.The beginning shows that Reeves wins a difficult court case and grabs the attention of a private firm in New York. Soon he and his wife are whisked up and away, lavished with wealth and all the earthly temptations. Stress and tension rises, the cases remain controversial, and slowly sanity and morals deteriorate.Reeves is the main character as Kevin. A few people have expressed disappointment with his acting but he doesn't come off as bad to me. He does seem like a similar role in a lot of the films he's in, but I thought he handled all the dramatic scenes quite well and managed to come off as an convincing, determined lawyer who's not good at much else - including marriage. The part where he breaks down showed talent. His southern accent DOES needs work, and it can be pretty inconsistent. The character of Kevin himself isn't really likeable. He comes across as a man trying to climb to the top, morals be damned. The perfect devil's advocate.The stunning Charlize Theron portrayed the wife, Mary Anne. Her personality in the movie was fragile but believable; beauty that turns into tragedy. Her declining sanity and almost childlike uncertainty add much. Other actors in the film are Craig T. Nelson (Coach, Poltergiest)as a client, Jeffrey Jones as Eddie, Judith Ivey as the annoying as hell religious mother, and some other well known faces. All carry their own weight and enhance the film.This movie can be slightly slow at some points. I never grew bored but some people may if they go in expecting something similar to End of days with non-stop brute force and magical display. This has plenty of time to unravel and the wrapup makes it worth it.The movie is laden with trippy images and quick flashes that leave you thinking, WTF? Where's the rewind button? The ending is classic and makes any doubt about the movie worthwhile. This movie also has some steamy sex scenes and nudity.The plot itself is from the same name novel by Andrew Neiderman. I have read several of his books, although not this one, and he is a great writer. He went on to ghostwrite the VC Andrews series, but I don't care for his work in that area, too formulated.This movie does have its weaknesses. Sometimes you wish for the plot to hurry a bit and for more to happen at a faster pace. The southern accents get tiring after awhile, and the mother Alice is just irritating but thankfully isn't around too much.Pacino is the devil himself, the effects were impressive, the music haunting and the buildup (and then release) pleasing.",4,Great stuff,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3366,"['start', 'droning', 'let', 'make', 'clear', 'first', 'have', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'fetish', 'Scarface', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'are', 'best', 'movies', 'cinematic', 'history', 'anyone', 'could', 'actually', 'believe', 'Pacino', 'was', 'NOT', 'good', 'actor', 'would', 'probably', 'drop', 'dead', 'shock', 'right', 'there', 'man', 'cameras', 'attention', 'full-force', 'Hell', ""'ve"", 'even', 'seen', 'movies', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'usually', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'favorite', 'actor.Anyway', 'enough', 'rambling', 'spewing', 'random', 'thoughts', 'review.Al', 'Pacino', 'ahem', 'perfect', 'role', 'Going', 'start', 'due', 'previews', 'cover', 'synopsis', 'word', 'mouth', 'basically', 'know', 'who', 'Pacino', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'how', 'hell', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Kevin', 'Lomax', 'whole', 'picture.The', 'beginning', 'Reeves', 'difficult', 'court', 'case', 'grabs', 'attention', 'private', 'firm', 'New', 'York', 'wife', 'are', 'whisked', 'up', 'away', 'lavished', 'wealth', 'earthly', 'temptations', 'Stress', 'tension', 'rises', 'cases', 'remain', 'controversial', 'slowly', 'sanity', 'morals', 'deteriorate.Reeves', 'main', 'character', 'Kevin', 'A', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'acting', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'bad', 'seem', 'similar', 'role', 'lot', 'films', 'thought', 'handled', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'quite', 'well', 'managed', 'come', 'off', 'convincing', 'determined', 'lawyer', 'who', 'not', 'good', 'much', 'else', 'including', 'marriage', 'part', 'where', 'down', 'showed', 'talent', 'southern', 'accent', 'DOES', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'inconsistent', 'character', 'Kevin', ""n't"", 'really', 'likeable', 'across', 'man', 'trying', 'climb', 'top', 'morals', 'be', 'damned', 'perfect', 'devil', 'advocate.The', 'stunning', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'portrayed', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Anne', 'personality', 'movie', 'was', 'fragile', 'believable', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'declining', 'sanity', 'almost', 'childlike', 'uncertainty', 'add', 'much', 'Other', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Coach', 'Poltergiest', 'client', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'Eddie', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'annoying', 'hell', 'religious', 'mother', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'carry', 'own', 'weight', 'enhance', 'film.This', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'slow', 'points', 'never', 'grew', 'bored', 'people', 'may', 'go', 'expecting', 'something', 'similar', 'End', 'days', 'non-stop', 'brute', 'force', 'magical', 'display', 'plenty', 'time', 'unravel', 'wrapup', 'it.The', 'movie', 'laden', 'trippy', 'images', 'quick', 'flashes', 'leave', 'thinking', 'WTF', 'Where', 'rewind', 'button', 'ending', 'classic', 'doubt', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'also', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'nudity.The', 'plot', 'same', 'name', 'novel', 'Andrew', 'Neiderman', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'books', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'writer', 'went', 'ghostwrite', 'VC', 'Andrews', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'work', 'area', 'too', 'formulated.This', 'movie', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'Sometimes', 'wish', 'plot', 'hurry', 'bit', 'more', 'happen', 'faster', 'pace', 'southern', 'accents', 'get', 'tiring', 'awhile', 'mother', 'Alice', 'just', 'irritating', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'around', 'too', 'much.Pacino', 'devil', 'effects', 'were', 'impressive', 'music', 'haunting', 'buildup', 'then', 'release', 'pleasing']",The Devil's Advocate VHS

Whatever the case, I'm very glad to have seen it and it is one of those films that I'll want to watch again.The pacing is perfect, with no lulls in the action. The acting ranges from very good to outstanding.  It did take me a while to get used to Keanu Reeves' speaking with a Southern accent (which I think could have been avoided, since he was playing the role of a transplanted Floridian).  He does not seem to be nearly as involved in the character as he does in films such as ""The Matrix"", which one would think would have been a greater challenge to an actor.  His scenes with his wife became increasingly flat, but perhaps that was a deliberate decision in an effort to be consistent with the plot development.Charlize Theron as Reeves' wife also seems to suffer a loss of involvement as the film progresses, but again, that may have been a calculated decision for reasons similar to Reeves' apparent detachment.Al Pacino, on the other hand, gives a consistently excellent performance, and is one of the most convincing incarnations of Satan I've ever seen.  He clearly is having the time of his life, and that's exactly the element so often missing in such portrayals.The visuals in this movie are beautifully done, whether it's a rooftop scene with the entire city spread below, or a dingy tenement basement lair of a voodoo priest.  There are also some excellent special effects, but they are not overdone.Finally, a word about the ending (without giving it away).  I totally disagree with those who claim that it ruins the movie or makes it impossible to understand what really happened.

105523,A3UZJJ86N23JOZ,0790736527,P. T. J.,"[4, 5]","""The Devil's Advocate"" is one of those movies that you can't stop thinking about after it's finished.  Scenes keep replaying through your head.  It's a movie that makes you think, despite it's strange, fantasy-like plot-line.  Al Pacino, without a doubt, delivers one of the best and most potent performances of his career.  Keanu Reeves isn't up to his usual standard of acting, but he plays wooden characters very well.  Once again, in ""The Devil's Advocate"", Keanu is wooden.  That's alright though, it really doesn't take anything away from the story line.  It doesn't matter who the director intended to be the movies main character; Pacino steals the show, but don't get me wrong.  He has his competition.Charlize Theron delivers a performance the caliber of which I didn't think she was capable.  She portrays the stages of madness through which her character stumbles through very accurately, cryptically, and passionately.  Her character (Keanu Reeves' wife) is slowly isolated and cut off from her husband through the doing Pacino, who uses the seven deadly sins to manipulate Keanu and keep him as far away from his wife as possible while at the same time manipulating her with a various assortment of devilish tricks.The dialogue in this movie is incredible.  The conversations in this movie alone are worth watching.  Pacino generally has the most thought-provoking lines in the film, though Keanu's mother and Theron have their moments.  I can't think of a single flaw in the character chemistry and interactions within this movie.  It's perfect.  Half the movie you feel your stomach writhing and twisting as you find yourself thinking and re-evaluating issues and aspects of your life you'd either forgotten about or taken for granted.  These aren't the only time in which you'll feel your stomach doing helixes in your bowels, however.For the other half of the movie, your insides will squirm with discomfort.  This movie is one of the most R rated movies I've ever seen.  Chalked full with graphic images including nudity, horror, blood/guts, violence and dialogue that includes some seriously disturbing topics, this movie becomes increasingly difficult to sit through as you go on.  The director makes it very clear he's not sparing the viewer for anything.  The camera rarely ever cuts or zooms in during the appropriate moments.  Instead, he captures everything in startling detail.  For instance, a suicide scene in which a character slits their throat is very, very graphic and terrifyingly realistic.  Another scene of sequence of violence goes back and forth between Pacino talking about humans greed and a character in the movie being beaten to death by two demons (supposedly sent by Al Pacino).  Other examples of disturbing images would be a series of scenes that feature Charlize Theron, one in which you see her completely nude with large gashes and slashes across her body, and another scene which could easily be classified as horror and is too difficult to really describe.  It suffices to say that it involves Charlize Theron and a baby child within a conjured halucination of Pacino's; yet another way of driving Theron's character mad.When these two elements combine, it makes for a compelling and thought provoking film pot-holed with graphic imagery and disturbing themes.  Even the climax of the movie includes an impressive amount of nudity, sexual content and violence.  Despite all of this though, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a very worth-while and ultimately poweful film, if not completely comfortable to watch all the way through.  I don't recommend this movie for family viewing or young children.  It's a movie that you need to mentally prepare for, and perhaps have an ""antidote"" movie lined up, perhaps a good-hearted comedy.  There is one more good thing I can say for this movie; it has a satisfying ending.  It's a film where the ending could make or break the entire feel of the movie.

Director Taylor Hackford did a great job by keeping the film styish and sleek all the while injecting a faint sense of dread into each of the early scenes that grows and grows until it completely breaks loose by the film's climax.I'm not going to expound on this film any more, because the eloquent reviewer from Woodstock, GA already did an excellent job of that.  However, I do want to point out that this film plays even better in my DVD player than it did when I watched it in the theater.  I don't know why, but I guess the sharper DVD image works for it better. Plus, the commentary by Taylor Hackford is extremely insightful. The film itself may go on a bit too long, and the climax still has me shaking my head a bit, but this film is undeniably provocative, giving us a better-than-average Keanu Reeves performance, who obviously has no trouble with a Southern accent (ditto for his British accent in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, another stylish and excellent film).  It also contains a performance by Al Pacino that is his best in years, and one that he clearly had a lot of fun in doing! But the performance that stands out the most for me is by relative newcomer Charlize Theron (originally from South Africa) as Reeves' suffering young wife.  Her performance is psychologically complex, sympathetic, and harrowing: she draws you into her character's heart so well that you can't look away. Her performance should have earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress; it's too bad that the Academy didn't agree.Despite the way the plot of THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE may read to some viewers, it is not a horror film, per se. It is a very-well-realized, fantastical vision of the good and evil that underpins our money-driven, materialistic society. It contains some rather disturbing scenes, but what is truly disturbing is how real it all seems.

No summaries or opinions on acting here; just a review of the transfer to Blu Ray.Blu Ray Transfer Quality ReviewDespite Amazon's refusal to separate the Standard Def release reviews from the Blu Ray reviews, I did not think that the Standard Def version was a bad release.  That said, the transfer to Blu Ray is an improvement in terms of color resolution and contrast.  There was no perceptible grain and no artifacting, stair-stepping or aliasing in any part of the film.  The Blu Ray video is the star of this transfer with nice details in the shadows and a nicely saturated palate of color.  Skin tones were as they should be as well.The  lossless audio is DTSHD 5.1  It is the front stage where the audio lives and shines. and while the audio levels are excellent and dialogue is clear and precise, even when the music score comes on, your center channel speaker will get most of the work. There is some small amount of panning across the front stage and light use of your LFE channel.  The rear channels are used primarily for non discreet audio ambience with only one scene in the entire film where discreet channeling to the rears comes to play.  The audio surprised me then as there had been no use of discreet rears throughout.The Blu Ray version of The Devils Advocate is certainly worth the inexpensive prices it has been going for but, as I said, the standard def version wasn't too bad and the differences between the two are not night and day.  The extras included the typical commentary, some deleted scenes that did not add much to the film and that's about it.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Devil's Advocate (Unrated Director's Cut) [Blu-ray],1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,1977,"['Still', 'fine', 'intriguing', 'film', 'years', 'summaries', 'opinions', 'acting', 'here', 'just', 'review', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray.Blu', 'Ray', 'Transfer', 'Quality', 'ReviewDespite', 'Amazon', 'refusal', 'separate', 'Standard', 'Def', 'release', 'reviews', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'was', 'bad', 'release', 'said', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'improvement', 'terms', 'color', 'resolution', 'contrast', 'was', 'perceptible', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'stair-stepping', 'aliasing', 'part', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'star', 'transfer', 'nice', 'details', 'shadows', 'nicely', 'saturated', 'palate', 'color', 'Skin', 'tones', 'were', 'should', 'be', 'well.The', 'lossless', 'audio', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'front', 'stage', 'where', 'audio', 'lives', 'shines', 'audio', 'levels', 'are', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'precise', 'even', 'when', 'music', 'score', 'center', 'channel', 'speaker', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'work', 'small', 'amount', 'panning', 'front', 'stage', 'light', 'use', 'LFE', 'channel', 'rear', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'primarily', 'non', 'discreet', 'audio', 'ambience', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'where', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'rears', 'play', 'audio', 'surprised', 'then', 'had', 'been', 'no', 'use', 'discreet', 'rears', 'throughout.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'Devils', 'Advocate', 'certainly', 'worth', 'inexpensive', 'prices', 'been', 'going', 'said', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'differences', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'night', 'day', 'extras', 'included', 'typical', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'film', 'it.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",The Devil's Advocate VHS

Ted the lawyer, Ted the Christ-figure, Ted the Buddha-figure, Ted the son of Satan, Ted the guy with the wife turning into a vapire, Ted the serial killer. He's just the same dopy guy in every movie and yet that character is really beginning to grow on me and I'm starting to realize that there is a difference between his roles. Maybe a subtle one but it's a difference. And he must be a very nice guy because he keeps ending up in all the great movies and despite how much I might be starting to like him he's still not THAT talented.This is a movie of pure brilliant evil. Al Pacino would be great for the last 15 minutes alone when he's over the top, blaspheming against G-d, nature and the American Judicial System. But the fact that Pacino lets himself play it down for most of the movie is great. He's polite. He's suave and there's just something a little off about him. He also lets Keanu have most of the movie. Usually if you are on screen with Pacino, forget about being remembered unless you happened to be DeNiro, but in this movie the director and the actor know how to hang back and make Reeves look good.Basically this movie is a parable about a lawyer without a conscience or at least without one that is going to stand in the way of winning. Due to his success he gets hired by a high-profile law firm with sinister undertones and begins to get a whole new breed of killers off. Oh yeah, the President of the law firm is Satan.This movie has some beautiful scenes including the final denoument with Satan and Reeves as well as the empty street of New York City that Keanu Reeves walks over to get to his confrontation. Charlize Theron (sic?) is the unraveling moral fiber that undercuts Reeves' flirtation with the dark side. Where he makes choices and loses a little more of his soul, she goes insane and changes her Belinda Carlisle hairdo to the Belinda Carlisle-postcocaine hairdo.This is an amazing movie. Brilliant and psychotic. Religious enough to please religious folks and blasphemous enough to entertain everyone else. Rent it, buy it and watch it over and over again.One caveat: the lawyer as devil storyline has been done to death. It's great here but one wonders why the festering resentment against lawyers is so pervasive.

This fact is brilliantly exploited in Al Pacino's monologue when he tries to convert Keanu Reeves (and the viewers?) to Satanism. ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a movie about a hyper-successful defense attorney who is being seduced by the promise of an even more complete and total professional success (not to mention physical and emotional ecstasy) by--who else?--the Devil.Al Pacino is very convincing playing the Devil. I have to admit that even if one does not literally believe in either God or Devil, Pacino can make one think in this one. For example, the Devil made some persuasive points regarding the importance of vanity (his favorite sin)which, without giving away the ending, seems to be decisive and so damning in our lives; the nature of our (God-given) nature--our senses give us the ability to get physical satisfaction, but never completely (what we can experience through touch we often cannot taste, what we can smell we often cannot touch, etc; and the seeming futility of moral anguish and drama that we create in our lives.The movie only gets four stars from me, because Keanu Reeves failed to convince me that his character had much of a soul to lose. He seemed to be soul-less before the Devil recruited him into his law firm. Reeves moves like a life-size doll at Disneyland. There is this rigidity and mechanical-like feel about him, and I was fearful that his character's mechanism would wind down and stop functioning before the Devil finished talking to him, leaving the picture incomplete and the viewers in suspense. Perhaps that is the effect the director and producers were going for?This is a very good picture. I found it entertaining, disturbing, and thought-provoking. I am sure you will, too. For if you have gotten this far reading this review, you must be a bright, persevering, thoughtful person. You will find that this picture has a lot to offer: special effects, great acting, and an interesting story. (Vanity... definitely my favorite...)

But by whom? John Milton (Al Pacino) runs NY's greatest law firm and convinces Lomax of a bright future under his wing.....but a fire lies in wait.Al Pacino plays a great devil! Keanu Reeves plays the same character he always plays...does he know how to act?

The movie was a transparent morality play and fairly predictable but still enjoyable to watch--you knew what would happen, and how it would wind up, but you could still enjoy the show.  You weren't left counting down the minutes till it was over and it didn't drag much. The pacing was well done and until the end, although it was predictable it wasn't a groaner.

Al Pacino delivers as always, and Charlize Theron showcased some of her acting talent (and her body).  Keanu Reeves was horrible, horrible, horrible, but isn't he always?Overall, this is a good movie about good versus evil and points out certain mysteries/paradoxes of the Christian mythical tradition.  The story is a simple allegory, and there are some unexplained holes that will require some significant suspension of disbelief.  It is not incredibly deep - that is, it won't change your world view - and one of Pacino's monologues is sort of vapid and choppy, but overall it is a good movie.  The ending after Satan's last monologue is disappointing and contrived, so beware the final 5 minutes.  If you're like me, you may find yourself rooting for the bad guy.

105562,AP3B615GM191G,0790736527,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","""The Devil's Advocate"" is a strange motion picture.  In some ways, it is a complete and utter mess.  Yet, it touches on such interesting themes and contains such great acting that it is tough to rank it as anywhere near ""bad"".For a basic plot summary, ""Devil's Advocate"" sees hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) move from his small southern practice to the ""big time"" in New York with wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron).  Employed by the mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino), Kevin begins to realize that his ""dream job"" may be a bit more complicated (and ultimately cosmic) than he could have possibly imagined.In terms of acting, this film is top-notch through and through.  Al Pacino was born to play the nefarious Milton, Reeves gives a solid performance as the conflicted lawyer, and Theron is startling as the mentally-slipping (or is she?) wife.  For fans specifically of Pacino watching this film to see one of his ""rants"", you will not be disappointed, either.The conflicting part of the movie, however, lies in its multitude of themes.  Such topics as ""God vs. Devil"", ""Innocence vs. Guilt"", ""Small-Town vs. Big City"", ""Ethics vs. Greed"", and ""Husband vs. Wife"" are touched upon.  Each theme in and of itself is extremely interesting and could carry the film without the others, but the problem is that they all smooshed together for two and a half hours.  Just when you think the movie is about one thing...BAM, it switches to something else.  While that filmmaking is admirable in terms of keeping the viewers glued to the screen, director Taylor Hackford could have done a much better job of sorting things out to produce a clean, crisp narrative, instead of one that jumps so often from theme to theme.Overall, this was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.  The acting and plot elements are incredible, but it just tries to do too much and gets lost within itself at times.  It could have been epic, but instead (because of those flaws) settles for ""above average"".  If you are a Pacino or Reeves fan, or just like movies that will make you think, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is very much worth a viewing.
