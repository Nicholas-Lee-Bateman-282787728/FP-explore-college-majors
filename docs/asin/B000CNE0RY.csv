Even any person who doesnt enjoy the comedy type of movies will really love it. I now have all 3 and they all ROCK!I gave my friend this dvd to see it over the weekend and I was just now with her on the phone and she said:""Did u see how they handled the kids?!). I said:""What kids?"" and she was like :""you've seen it c'mon"", and I kept on saying no i didn't, she said its on the opposite side of the disc. I was really shocked that i didn't turn the disc over. She's going to give it to me tomorrow at school, I don't know how i am going to survive waiting for 12-hours!!!!! No wonder why it finished so quickly, I've been missing half of it!!!!

(SIL & GOLD)  LOLWhen I was in class, I laughed for several times and the teacher asked me: ""Why are you laughing?"". I answered :""Nothing, I just remembered something!"". She was like ""o.k..."". The thing I remembered was that when Paris and Nichole were working at a psychic place, their manager said ""foffesional"" instead of profesional. Paris was like ""what is foffesional?""

959026,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000CNE0RY,Richard Ross,"[3, 3]","'The Simple Life 3 - Interns' was made back when life was simple for Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. This was before all the coke and DUI busts the girls racked up individually and the eventual jail time they both served as a result of their numerous offenses. It was also the last season they appeared in together as best friends. Soon after 'Interns' aired,  Paris announced that she and Nicole were no longer friends nor were they even speaking to each other. So began a very public feud over very private reasons. Despite being contractually obligated to return for a fourth season, the two refused to appear onscreen together. They eventually worked things out and returned for a fifth season but by then they had already been dropped by Fox and viewership was down. Besides the increasingly annoying levels of diva like behavior and the girls' ridiculous sense of entitlement, I think another reason people stopped watching the show was because of how obviously fake it was. The first season you sort of went along with it and believed what you were watching, but after the show became a hit the producers obviously felt the need to go bigger for seasons 2 and 3. The episodes got to be so obviously scripted and acted that you began to wonder why the hell you were even watching it anymore. For me there's a simple explanation: these girls are super hot. Now a lot of people probably don't agree, but I think both of them are quite sexy and therefore found many of the situations they got themselves in in these 16 episodes highly entertaining.Since this was the longest season you know there are going to be more than a few ""filler"" episodes that aren't all that great. Examples of this include internships with a fortune teller with attitude, an advertising agency no one's ever heard of including the people that work there, zookeepers, auto mechanics, wedding planners, bakers and a couple other ones I've already forgot about. Highlights include internships at a plastic surgeon's office, a dentist's office, a funeral home, an old folks' home, firefighters, marketing designers for Burger King, newscasters and daycare supervisors to name just a few. These specific episodes were a lot of fun to watch. Even though the situations are so outrageous and staged, the girls and their ""unwitting"" victims provide a lot of laughs. As a previous reviewer pointed out, Paris comes off really well this season. Whereas in previous seasons she could get quite annoying when it came time to get her hands dirty, she's more than game to jump right into her various internships and try new things. Plus, she proves herself to be quite good with kids (a thought that probably terrifies a lot of people) in several of the episodes, even going so far as to design a room for a boy who doesn't have a bed and sleeps on the floor in his sister's room and (in a precursor to her eventual BFF show) interviewing potential playmates for the adopted daughter of one of their host families. And it's not like Nicole doesn't do anything in these episodes, she's lightning quick at coming up with hilarious comebacks for bosses that try to put her and Paris down. As limited as their individual merits may be, what can I say other than they make a good team.",3,Before The Friendship Ended,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,3246,"[""'The"", 'Simple', 'Life', '3', 'Interns', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'simple', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Nicole', 'Richie', 'was', 'coke', 'DUI', 'girls', 'racked', 'up', 'individually', 'eventual', 'jail', 'time', 'served', 'result', 'numerous', 'offenses', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'season', 'appeared', 'together', 'best', 'friends', 'Soon', ""'Interns"", 'aired', 'Paris', 'announced', 'Nicole', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'friends', 'were', 'even', 'speaking', 'other', 'So', 'began', 'very', 'public', 'feud', 'very', 'private', 'reasons', 'being', 'contractually', 'obligated', 'return', 'fourth', 'season', 'two', 'refused', 'appear', 'onscreen', 'together', 'eventually', 'worked', 'things', 'out', 'returned', 'fifth', 'season', 'then', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'dropped', 'Fox', 'viewership', 'was', 'down', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'levels', 'diva', 'behavior', 'girls', 'ridiculous', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'think', 'reason', 'people', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'how', 'obviously', 'fake', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'sort', 'went', 'believed', 'what', 'were', 'watching', 'show', 'became', 'hit', 'producers', 'obviously', 'felt', 'need', 'go', 'bigger', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'episodes', 'got', 'be', 'so', 'obviously', 'scripted', 'acted', 'began', 'wonder', 'why', 'hell', 'were', 'even', 'watching', 'anymore', 'simple', 'explanation', 'girls', 'are', 'super', 'hot', 'Now', 'lot', 'people', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'think', 'are', 'quite', 'sexy', 'therefore', 'found', 'many', 'situations', 'got', '16', 'episodes', 'highly', 'entertaining.Since', 'was', 'longest', 'season', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'few', 'filler', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'Examples', 'include', 'internships', 'fortune', 'teller', 'attitude', 'advertising', 'agency', 'one', 'ever', 'heard', 'including', 'people', 'work', 'there', 'zookeepers', 'auto', 'mechanics', 'wedding', 'planners', 'bakers', 'couple', 'other', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'already', 'forgot', 'about', 'Highlights', 'include', 'internships', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'office', 'dentist', 'office', 'funeral', 'home', 'old', 'folks', 'home', 'firefighters', 'marketing', 'designers', 'Burger', 'King', 'newscasters', 'daycare', 'supervisors', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'specific', 'episodes', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Even', 'situations', 'are', 'so', 'outrageous', 'staged', 'girls', 'unwitting', 'victims', 'provide', 'lot', 'laughs', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'Paris', 'off', 'really', 'well', 'season', 'Whereas', 'previous', 'seasons', 'could', 'get', 'quite', 'annoying', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'more', 'game', 'jump', 'right', 'various', 'internships', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'kids', 'thought', 'probably', 'lot', 'people', 'several', 'episodes', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'design', 'room', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'bed', 'sleeps', 'floor', 'sister', 'room', 'precursor', 'eventual', 'BFF', 'show', 'interviewing', 'potential', 'playmates', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'one', 'host', 'families', 'not', 'like', 'Nicole', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'episodes', 'lightning', 'quick', 'coming', 'up', 'hilarious', 'comebacks', 'bosses', 'try', 'put', 'Paris', 'down', 'As', 'limited', 'individual', 'merits', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'other', 'make', 'good', 'team']",The Simple Life: Season 3 - Interns
