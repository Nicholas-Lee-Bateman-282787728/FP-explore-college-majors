I am a fan of both and enjoyed watching this story unfold (even though it was pretty predictable).  Doris, of course, is her sweet self and Ronald's own personality (as seen the book ""I love you, Ronnie"") shines through in the man he portrays so well.  This is a very classic film biography.

This isn't one of the meatiest roles for Doris, but she does have some dramatic scenes and gets to sing a Christmas song.

308297,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302344891,David Baldwin,"[24, 26]","The subject of ""The Winning Team"" is Grover ""Old Pete"" Alexander, the winningest pitcher in National League history despite having to battle various setbacks most notably alcoholism.  As a fan of the Philadelphia Phillies I thought the film gave his tenure here short shrift so here goes:  Alexander won 30 games three years in a row(1915-1917), in 1916 he pitched 16 shutouts, in 1915 he won the first game of the World Series a feat not repeated by a Phillies pitcher until 1980(the championship year.  Yay!).  I digress, however.  As a baseball film it's superb.  The film has the facts right and the game footage, whether re-enactments or archival film, add to the authenticity of the production.  The film slightly falters in the more melodramatic moments but do not embellish far from the truth.  Alexander did suffer head injuries in World War I and did resort to alcoholism to combat the pain.  He also denigrated himself by appearing at flea circuses when it appeared that his major league career was over.  Ronald Reagan makes a genial Alexander and handles the film's melodramatic fluorishes superbly.  Doris Day adds fresh faced All-American girl wholesomeness as Alexander's supportive wife Aimee.  The film utilizes major league players in supporting roles including Gene Mauch, manager of the 1964 Phillies who blew a 6 1/2 game lead with 12 games to go(boo!).  As a footnote, Alexander attended the 1950 World Series between the Phillies and the Yankees.

308299,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302344891,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 3]","There is a certain irony in the fact that Doris Day receives star billing in a film about baseball player Grover Cleveland Alexander.  The simple fact is that by 1952 and after only four years on the screen, she was a major star--and that fellow player Ronald Reagan, after fifteen years on the screen, was still among Hollywood's lesser lights.  Doris Day would follow her trajectory to a massive stardom that made her the single biggest female box office draw in the world of her era.  Ronald Reagan, with his career fading into ho-hum projects, drifted into politics and took a series of brutal pro-conservative stances (he was against fair housing and Medicare); by 1964 he was out of the movie industry entirely, becoming Governor of California in 1967 and President of the United States in 1981.THE WINNING TEAM is, in a certain way, indicative of both.  Although Day would gradually become best known for a series of frothy sex comedies such as PILLOW TALK, she also had significant dramatic chops, and she made an impression in such dramas as YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN, STORM WARNING, YOUNG AT HEART, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME, and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  Even so, the role of long-suffering but devoted Amiee Alexander is not entirely within her reach at this point in her career, and she plays it (oddly) as if she were June Allyson on loan from an MGM musical. Reagan was a competent player who had scored in BROTHER RAT, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL AMERICAN, and KINGS ROW; he was not, however, so much famous, talented, or skilled as he was just likeable in an all-American sort of way, and he doesn't register as a major dramatic force.The movie is also typical of bio-pics of the day, which is to say there isn't a whole lot truth to it.  In real life, Alexander was headed for a law degree before his talent for baseball drew professional interest.  Always a hard drinker, by 1921 he was alcoholic, exhibited signs of epilepsy, and suffered ""shell shock"" from World War One.  Over the years he would spend time in several private hospitals trying to shake his demons, but his private behavior ranged from off-beat to completely bizarre, a circumstance that led his various teams to trade him again and again simply to get rid of him.  Even so, and although he was often accused of being drunk during games, he was a fan favorite and he copped a series of records and led his teams--most spectacularly the St. Louis Cardinals--to remarkable and frequently unexpected victories.  His major league career was over by 1930, but he was elected to Baseball's Hall Of Fame in 1938.  He died under somewhat vague circumstances, most likely of a heart attack, in 1950.  Not long afterward, his wife Aimee went public in defense of her husband, emphatically stating that his epilepsy was often mistaken for drunkness and that the illness, various physical injuries, his memories of the war, and professional pressures had driven him to drink.  He was in her opinion (and in the opinion of many of his peers) more sinned against than sinning.Aimee Alexander was particularly vocal in husband's defense during the filming of THE WINNING TEAM, and this maybe why the script is so non-descript when it deals with Alexander's extremes, downplaying his alcoholism and epilepsy and generally ascribing his issues to various physical injuries and his war experiences.  At the time, the film was sharply criticized by baseball professionals and fans for fiddling these facts, but in truth the times simply didn't favor a no-holds-barred telling of Alexander's story.  Although films like 1945's THE LOST WEEKEND and 1948's THE SNAKE PIT broke barries on the subjects of alcoholism and mental illness, these were still very touchy subjects.  Such illnesses as epilepsy were seldom mentioned in public because many still felt they had a ""sins of the father"" connotation, and even shell shock (which we now call post-traumatic stress disorder) wasn't considered entirely respectable.  The result is a screenplay that keeps the source of Alexander's problems as vague as possible.Whatever the case, the end result is a reasonably well crafted little movie that (in spite of numerous baseball celebrities) isn't in the least memorable.  Simply put, THE WINNING TEAM ain't no PRIDE OF THE YANKEES and Ronald Reagan sure as hell ain't no Gary Cooper.  Doris Day acquits herself reasonably well, but she hasn't really her stride as a dramatic actress, and overall everything about the film lacks depth.  The print is good, the sound quality isn't bad, and the DVD includes a trailer as a bonus, but on the whole this movie is really pretty ho-hum and best left to hardcore Day or Reagan fans--and maybe the handful of baseball fans who are curious to see how Hollywood dealt with Alexander's life.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Webster Armstrong",3,Shallow Glance at Baseball's Grover Cleveland

308300,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302344891,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","- Ty Cobb: ""Grover Cleveland Alexander wasn't drunk out there on the mound, the way people thought. He was an epileptic. Old Pete would fall down with a seizure between innings, then go back and pitch another shutout.""It's not the best baseball movie ever. That boast probably falls toThe Pride of the Yankees (Collector's Edition)orBull Durham (20th Anniversary Edition), or maybeField of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition). But THE WINNING TEAM, sanitized and dramatized though it was for 1950s consumption, makes for a heartwarming time in front of the screen. Doris Day gets top billing, but it's Ronald Reagan who, as that great Nebraskan hurler, Grover Cleveland Alexander, capably assumes the focus of this biopic. Word has it that Reagan, an avid sports enthusiast, desperately wanted to play another memorable pitcher, Monty Stratton, in an earlier film except that Jimmy Stewart trumped him and landed that role.The Stratton Storywas well regarded enough that the Grover Cleveland Alexander project was greenlit, and Reagan got to play a professional baseballer. He turns in a thoroughly sympathetic performance. Playing his understanding wife, Doris Day, pretty and wholesome enough to make Norman Rockwell pant, matches Reagan in sheer likability. They both get to test out their dramatic chops. They handle their business.3.5 out of 5 stars, which means I like this film, never mind that some facts were glossed over or tweaked. I guess there was a stigma regarding afflictions such as epilepsy back in the day (when, I guess, men were ridiculously rugged and smoked Marlboros with world-weary swagger), and the film reflects this macho outlook. Heck, Alexander himself reflected this. Rather than be viewed as someone with a debilitating condition, he'd rather that people believed him a drunkard (which he was, also). The film omitted mention of Alexander's true medical condition, opting instead to present Alexander's malady as a recurring series of fainting spells and double vision.Alex the Great may hail from Nebraska but he was never cut out to be a farm boy (or a telephone lineman, for that matter). Alex the Great (or ""Old Pete"") was a power pitcher, and he racked up heaps of milestones and records in his career. Inarguably, his signature moment surfaced during the 1926 World Series when his Cardinals went up against the juggernaut New York Yankees which at that time fielded immortals like Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Murderer's Row, they called them Yankees. Not only did Alexander pitch two complete (and winning) games (Games 2 and 6), but, in Game 7, with his team up a precarious 3 runs to 2 in the seventh inning, he was called out of the bullpen to hold off a crucial Yankees rally, with two outs and the bases loaded. He went on to keep the Yankees scoreless for two more innings, sealing the game and winning the Cardinals the World Series. That day, it was the Yankees fans who threw a fit (sorry).And, for you old school baseball buff, throughout the film, the camera treats you to cameo appearances by big leaguers like Gene Mauch, Bob Lemon, Peanuts Lowrey, and Hank Sauer.

He's somewhat forgotten in a time that is out of the memory of anyone alive today. Film footage is scant. The aftermath of  World War I wasn't kind. He continued to pitch well at times but undiagnosed injuries from the war left him with epilepsy & an alcohol problem. It was reported that Reagan voiced concern that the movie did not point out that it was epilepsy that led to the drinking that contributed to his decline. The producers of the movie could not even bring themselves about to utter the word epilepsy. Reagan was left to play Alexander as what appeared to be a drunk. No denying that this Hall of Famer was one of the best pitchers ever. The movie rolls through the baseball part of his life effortlessly. Doris Day was his wife, at first dubious of his desire to pitch but later is his most ardent fan. She was attempting to show producers that she could do serious roles. He is compared in the movie to the great New York favorite, Christie Matthewson, his only equal of the the time who was also injured in the war. He makes a final comeback appearance that is of course, heart-warming & ties up the movie. I'm always dubious about such a neat ending. But this is an average, good, Ronald Regan movie.

Doris Day, billed first, was the top moneymaking star at Warner Brothers and Ronald Reagan was nearing the end of his contract run at that studio.The pair had briefly dated some years before, and they clearly evidence an on-screen chemistry which propels this tale of the late, great pitcher, Grover Cleveland Alexander, to a near homer.While it may play lose with some of the facts surrounding &quot;Alex the Great's&quot; life, toning down his drinking problems and virtually ignoring his epilepsy, the resultant film is a well crafted, lovingly enacted story that will please a variety of audiences including those who enjoy baseball tales and those who prefer some homespun Hollywood biography.This smartly directed story pretty much limits its scope to the years during which Alex and his wife Aimee were courting and married. The popular standard, &quot;I'll String Along with You&quot; is utilized as part of the film's score during many scenes involving the pair. Although not actually written at the time the story takes place it is nevertheless poignant and sweet.Ronald Reagan clearly worked hard at his role in this film.  He delivers one of his most convincing performances and capably displays the many layers behind the great pitcher with heartfelt feeling and emotion. As noted earlier, his chemistry with Doris Day is never forced or artificial but seems to be completely real in every way.Few actresses could play wife and/or mother with the conviction of Doris Day.  In the 40's, 50's, 60's, or 70's, she consistently and with subtlety played such roles in a real and completely believable fashion. She never resorts to sacchrrine sweetness or cloying mannerisms.  Although only in her 20's when making this film, she displays a natural maturity and warmth as well as strength of character that gives the role of Aimee more complexity than it may appear to have on the surface. One shudders to imagine what the role would have been in the hands of someone like June Allyson or Debbie Reynolds.During their marriage and the ups and downs that occurred with frequency, Aimee becomes a force behind Alex's comebacks and renewed success.  While never diminishing Alex's own strengths and skills, Aimee is, nonetheless, a presence in his life that he can always turn to with certainty.The supporting cast is fine headed by the always reliable Frank Lovejoy, turning in another fine performance. Baseball scenes are interlaced with real footage, and staged with excitement and an obvious love for that most American of sports.&quot;The Winning Team&quot; is the perfect antidote to livening up anyone's day.

It's very cool to see Reagan teamed up with an A-list actress such as a young Doris Day.  Being around other great actors seems to bring out the best performances by Mr. Reagan.  The story is about Grover Cleveland Alexander, a Major League pitcher who was very successful in the early days of baseball.  Alexander has epilepsy which causes his pitching to suffer, which leads to other downfalls.  The movie makers didn't want to use the word epilepsy in the film, so it's never mentioned.  Reagan thought they should say it, to inform the audience what epilepsy is about, and to put a human face on it.  One must remember this was the early 1950's, and movie companies were probably afraid people would be turned off by a film that deals with a main character with epilepsy.  Maybe not too different than film companies today that are overly politically correct so as to not offend anyone, anywhere, anyhow.Nonetheless, the storyline is very well written, and the acting is really top notch!  This is certainly one of my favorite baseball movies, along with Pride of the Yankees, The Natural, Field of Dreams and a few others.

And that is what they got. The formula causes The Winning Team to be a bit predictable, but enjoyable. This is one of Doris Day's early films, but it is really Reagan's film.
