802902,A7A64GVO0CJ0A,B0001EQIGK,Aaron D. Mitchell,"[7, 10]","I'm a huge John Cena fan, but this DVD could be much better. The extra matches included are a nice bonus, but there's only 5 matches on this DVD period. When I buy a wrestling DVD it's for wrestling. The whole DVD is John Cena's freestyles. Really the whole DVD is JUST his freestyles, with Cena introductions. I like his freestyles just as much as the next Cena fan, but what about some content. Not a whole lot of replay value to hear him rap. The other extra features are a Before They Were Superstars, wich is a really cool look at his past. A funny outside the ropes segment from WWE Confidential. Behind the Scenes of the YJ Stinger ads. Smackdown Magazine cover shoot. John Cena &amp; Eddie Guerrero in Singapore (funny segment). And Battle rap in Baghdad were he battle raps a soilder.The matches are:vs. Chris Benoitvs. Brock Lesnarvs. Undertakervs. Eddie Guerrerovs. Kurt AngleSo if you are a huge Cena fan pick it up, if not this one should be passed on.",3,"Good for a Cena Fan, but could be better.",1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,965,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'John', 'Cena', 'fan', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'extra', 'matches', 'included', 'are', 'nice', 'bonus', 'only', '5', 'matches', 'DVD', 'period', 'When', 'buy', 'wrestling', 'DVD', 'wrestling', 'whole', 'DVD', 'John', 'Cena', 'freestyles', 'Really', 'whole', 'DVD', 'JUST', 'freestyles', 'Cena', 'introductions', 'freestyles', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'Cena', 'fan', 'what', 'content', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'replay', 'value', 'hear', 'rap', 'other', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'Were', 'Superstars', 'wich', 'really', 'cool', 'look', 'past', 'funny', 'ropes', 'segment', 'WWE', 'Confidential', 'Scenes', 'YJ', 'Stinger', 'ads', 'Smackdown', 'Magazine', 'cover', 'shoot', 'John', 'Cena', 'amp', 'Eddie', 'Guerrero', 'Singapore', 'funny', 'segment', 'Battle', 'rap', 'Baghdad', 'were', 'battle', 'soilder.The', 'matches', 'are', 'vs.', 'Chris', 'Benoitvs', 'Brock', 'Lesnarvs', 'Undertakervs', 'Eddie', 'Guerrerovs', 'Kurt', 'AngleSo', 'are', 'huge', 'Cena', 'fan', 'pick', 'up', 'not', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'passed']",WWE: John Cena - Word Life

802908,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B0001EQIGK,D.P.,"[3, 5]","NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2012.As John Cena has become the face of WWE, every success story has a start somewhere & this story started the day he decided to drop his generic babyface look in favor of sports jerseys, jeans, athletic shoes, a lock & chain around his neck, beginning to talk with more of an attitude & through rhymes while also adapting the four words of ""Word Life....Basic Thuganomics.""  Now this DVD set came out early in his career (under 2 years from his TV debut) to capitalize on his fast rising popularity so this wasn't your typical ""career"" documentary as it focused more on the best of his raps from the past year of his career which it being hosted by Cena himself with no other names adding to the set past his friends & cousin Trademarc in the background.The presentation starts with his first rap at the SmackDown Christmas part back in 2002 as Vanilla Ice. His promo raps on Brock Lesnar (Backlash 2003) & Undertaker (Vengeance 2003) are shown before going into his battle raps he did with people like Rikishi, Brian ""Spanky"" Kendrick, Kurt Angle, and the funniest one of them all with Big Show (""Your the white girl & I'm Kobe Bryant!""). His little ""masturbation"" rap on Stephanie McMahon & his promo on Vince & Sable are also shown followed by highlights of his various pre-match raps on people like Rhyno, Billy Gunn, Funaki, and A-Train before with his rap at the first ""SmackDown In Iraq"" show close out the documentary.Matches Include:vs. Chris Benoit - This was the tournament final to see who would get the title shot against Brock Lesnar at Backlash.  Benoit stayed in control early by out-wrestling Cena to the point where dirty tactics were used in order for Cena to get an advantage before grounding Benoit with holds like the chinlock only for him to fight back with hard chops & even a suicide dive onto the floor.  Cena targeted Benoit's previously injured neck including a top rope legdrop while his neck was hanging across the ropes along with other moves like his throwback & headlocks while Benoit was able to take advantage when Cena got frustrated with his trademark german suplexes & crossface.  This was a good TV match between the two with Cena still being green but Benoit bringing out a better performance than previously seen since the birth of his ""thuganomics"" character.""SmackDown"" Apr. '03vs. WWE Champion Brock Lesnar - Cena was out for revenge here for Brock injuring his leg months earlier & jumped Brock before the bell only for Brock to quickly regain control using his power like two backbreakers & suplexes, an elevated slam, and Cena being tossed into the announce table.  Cena was able to use Brock's momentum against him sending him into the steps to take control targeting the cut on his head using the steps & ringpost, legdrop on his head while it was on the ropes, and DDT to the point where Brock was bleeding.  They went back & forth with Brock using his strength & superior wrestling ability while Cena stuck to his brawling style & even some dirty tactics at times to the point where the winner wasn't dominate more than he was able to catch the other guy.Backlash '03[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain - Collectors Edition]vs. Undertaker - This was the rematch from the previous Vengeance PPV & Taker dominated right from the start working over Cena's shoulder with twisting armbars including an elevated one along with doing ""Old School"" & driving it into the turnbuckle.  However the internal injured that Cena gave him at Vengeance came into play after a superplex that hurt Taker as much as Cena which had Cena focus on midsection but Taker kept coming including one stiff clothesline but kept hurting himself with his own offense like the Last Ride attempt.  This match overall showcased Cena on the defense but was more about putting over Taker's upcoming storyline & didn't match up to their previous Vengeance encounter (which you can see on Taker's ""Tombstone"" DVD set)vs. United States Champion Eddie Guerrero - This was suppose to be Guerrero's homecoming as the U.S. Champion but Cena ruined it by stealing the rim & tire from his low-rider coming into this match.  Guerrero was so upset that he attacked Cena from behind during his entrance & threw Cena into the steps cutting his forehead which Eddie continued to target using the announce table & using his own ""lie, cheat, steal"" ways to use a chair.  Cena was able to gain control when Eddie missed one of his signature moves before working over his back with moves like the powerbomb, delayed suplex, and bearhug while also using the the steps at ringside.  Eddie brought out one of the best performances from Cena during this period of his career as they traded momentum throughout the match but the biggest story was what happened towards the end & after the match which setup the famous ""Parking Lot Brawl"" between the two the next week (which can be seen on Eddie Guerrero's ""Viva La Raza"" DVD set).""SmackDown"" Sept. '03vs. Kurt Angle - Angle out-wrestled Cena early but caught a break when Angle went shoulder first into the post & started bleeding from the mouth which led to Cena going on the offensive with a grounded front headlock & spinebuster.  Angle took control back when catching Cena with a dropkick to the shin & even attempted to to a german suplex off the apron to the outside only for Cena to counter into a DDT on the apron as Cena continued to work over Angle's previously injured neck with a top rope legdrop right on the neck straddled along the top rope, his throwback, and a powerbomb into the corner.  The intensity picked up with both men surviving the others signature moves to the point where Cena himself resorted to desperation & dirty tactics to try to gain an advantage at one point.  Angle gave Cena possibly the best wrestling match in his career here but the bigger story here was how this match shadowed the future of Cena as despite the fact he was the heel in this match, he started getting a big show of support from the crowd.No Mercy '03DVD extras include his ""Before They Were Superstars"" profile, behind the scenes of his Stacker 2 commercial, a battle rap against a soldier in Iraq, and various features from the ""Confidental"" show including answering questions on ""Outside The Ropes"", behind the scenes of his SmackDown magazine cover, and visiting Singapore with Eddie Guerrero.  Hidden extras include his Stacker 2 commercial, a rap about the new year, and a backstage segment from SmackDown featuring him & Funaki.If your a fan of his ""thugamonics"" period then I would recommend this as his raps were entertaining with some funny punchlines while he would go on to have better & more famous matches in his career but again were overall some the best from this period of his career.",3,Basic Thugamonics...The Beginning Of John Cena,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,6784,"['NOTE', 'UPDATED', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IN', '2012.As', 'John', 'Cena', 'become', 'face', 'WWE',

An ok match, but nothing to jump up and down over.7/105.vs Kurt AngleA fantastic matchup,kurt and John put all their effort into this match. 10/10In closing, this dvd was not that good because it was released too early in Cena's career.Cena hasnt had to many gimmick matches the only gimmick match I've seen in him was the lumber jack match. When he starts doing cage and hell in a cell matches then thats when you make a dvd about someone. An ok buy just dont expect too much .
