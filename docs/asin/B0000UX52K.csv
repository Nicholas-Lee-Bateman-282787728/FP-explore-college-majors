784284,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000UX52K,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 14]","All should know that I am a huge fan of surfing movies.  From ""Endless Summer"" to ""Riding Giants"" and even the small ""Billabong Odyssey"", I have been there to watch the greats catch some of the greatest waves in history - and be there with a camera.  It is phenomenal to watch these small men ride creations of nature.  It is these types of movies that make you want to grab a board, learn to surf, and fly to Hawaii just to experience the North Shore.  These films evoke a sense of excitement, the push you to the limits, and make your jaw drop to the floor.  Having seen most of the more recent surf films, I was on the hunt for a new palate of cinematography.  I wanted to explore the next level in the surfing genre, sadly, what I experienced was a little over-hyped surfing documentary called ""Thicker than Water"".  Helmed by the musically inclined Jack Johnson, I was prepared for some great surf, amazing music, and people that I would never forget as I continue my quest as a pho-surfer.  Alas, that wasn't the case with this movie.  I have no idea where the hype seems to be, if maybe only for the purist of surfers, but what I experienced was an amateurish feature, with no opportunity for involvement, and a sound that seemed like scraps off the dinner table.  Nothing was worth enjoying, and for me, this 45-minute feature took nearly three days to watch.I must admit, the concept for this film was good.  I liked the idea of friends out surfing these remote spots of the world, seeing through their eyes places I may never see in my existence, but what I didn't need was rush images of people with no introduction, sappy tunes, and upper-class individuals rubbing it in my face the wealth of their parents.  This wasn't a film about surfing, while there was plenty of it in the film, but instead an opportunity for these guys piggy-back on Mr. Johnson's career in hopes of making a cult surf film.  ""Thicker than Water"" eventually turned out to be nothing more than a couple of guys surfing the baby pool at each exotic location.  When I watch a movie like this, I hope to see tremendous waves  that show me how impressive these guys are with their trade.  I wanted to have my jaw drop on the floor with excitement over what maneuver I would see next, or how big Mother Nature would get for the next surfer, but it never happened.  For 45-minutes we went to remote locations with no name (could someone tell me where they went - please!), with surfers with no name (could someone give me some history on these athlete's - please!), and pathetic waves.  Am I being too negative on this film?  Nope, if 45-minutes of a sport that I loved bored me, than something definitely wasn't working.Arg.  As I read the mostly positive reviews of this film, I am puzzled.  What was it that drew most of the audience in?  As I read words like ""beautiful cinematography"" and ""unusual and exotic music"", I just get completely puzzled.  Did I miss something?  Am I not as big of a fan as I once thought I was?  Are there fans that could sit through this more than once?  While I think most will say ""yes"" after reading this critical review, I just don't think I can honestly say that I enjoyed any part of this film - outside of the audio commentary.  The commentary provided me with the missing puzzle pieces that this film horribly missed.  It provided a voice, a direction, and a focus that the original 45-minute feature lacked.  I needed this guidance.  I wanted to hear the story of these guys told through any means necessary.  The sporadic filming, the graininess of the view, and the overall ambiance of ""Thicker than Water"" was so diluted that watching kids on a raft in a wave pool would have been more entertaining.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except those needing a good night's sleep.  The music, while I am a fan of Jack Johnson's work, is not the caliber you would come to expect from him, the film itself is pointless and excessively random with horrid dubs and inconsistent A to B direction.  I love surfing films, but this one lacks the draw and power of the others mentioned.  Not that I need all the flash, I don't mind a pure film about surfing, but give me names, give me places, give me stories.  All of these features are what make up a true surfing documentary.  We need words (actually ANYTHING) to go with the waves.  In ""Thicker than Water"" the waves were just not enough.Grade: * out of *****",1,Cowbell?  Nope.

784285,A1EEMMDBA6ZSI4,B0000UX52K,Alexander,"[0, 0]","I have never surfed in my life. I used to live in Florida where the beach was a 60 second walk away. I would watch surfers, I would swim, boogie-board, skim-board, just lie on the beach, etc - but never did I surf. I now live a lifetime away from the southern-florida beaches. I bought this film because I am now a 6 hour drive from anything partially resembling a decent beach and I wanted to see a movie that would take me back there.I would describe the movie as a vibrant surf film following a group of surfers across the world set to a chill soundtrack. The cinematography is just plain awesome. The movie was shot on fullframe 16mm film - sometimes in black-and-white, mostly in color. The music is terrific. Others complained that the music was too chill for the imagery of surfing; I think it fits perfectly. Johnson has a few riffs placed throughout the movie but mostly heard are other artists. Also included is a commentary track by the Malloy brothers and Jack Johnson - if you are interested in the locations (vague references) or short anecdotes told by the filmmakers then I recommend listening in on this. Found on the extras page is 'Holes To Heaven': a great song written and played by Jack Johnson set to more great footage. Other extras include a handful of deleted scenes.I am glad I bought this film. It is a small price to pay for an excellent trip back to the beach.5/5",5,5 Stars!,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,1393,"['have', 'never', 'surfed', 'life', 'used', 'live', 'Florida', 'where', 'beach', 'was', '60', 'second', 'walk', 'away', 'would', 'watch', 'surfers', 'would', 'swim', 'boogie-board', 'skim-board', 'just', 'lie', 'beach', 'etc', 'never', 'did', 'surf', 'now', 'live', 'lifetime', 'away', 'southern-florida', 'beaches', 'bought', 'film', 'am', 'now', '6', 'hour', 'drive', 'anything', 'partially', 'resembling', 'decent', 'beach', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'back', 'there.I', 'would', 'describe', 'movie', 'vibrant', 'surf', 'film', 'following', 'group', 'surfers', 'world', 'set', 'chill', 'soundtrack', 'cinematography', 'just', 'plain', 'awesome', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'fullframe', '16mm', 'film', 'sometimes', 'black-and-white', 'mostly', 'color', 'music', 'terrific', 'Others', 'complained', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'chill', 'imagery', 'surfing', 'think', 'perfectly', 'Johnson', 'few', 'riffs', 'placed', 'movie', 'mostly', 'heard', 'are', 'other', 'artists', 'Also', 'included', 'commentary', 'track', 'Malloy', 'brothers', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'are', 'interested', 'locations', 'vague', 'references', 'short', 'anecdotes', 'told', 'filmmakers', 'then', 'recommend', 'listening', 'Found', 'extras', 'page', ""'Holes"", 'Heaven', 'great', 'song', 'written', 'played', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'set', 'more', 'great', 'footage', 'Other', 'extras', 'include', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes.I', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'film', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'excellent', 'trip', 'back', 'beach.5/5']",Thicker Than Water
784286,A2KSWHGL7NT5TW,B0000UX52K,Andrew D. Dixon Jr.,"[77, 87]","Compared to other surf films being flooded into the market these days, this is not bad. Music is good, footage is good (note: SHOT ON FILM, not video). It was somewhat hard to figure out where they were. We have clear scenery change, but no indicator to tell us where they really were except for the traditional Irish folk music that obviously indicated they were surfing Ireland. Director's commentary is witty and insightful and gives us perspective that few surf films give us and basically provides a good reason to watch it again -- and again. The version of this DVD I purchased in a local surf shop included a second disc; a CD with the soundtrack from the film. Very nice and a unique marketing and packaging idea. It actually convinced me to purchase the package. More importantly, the music is actually good (I was disappointed, though that the Irish folk music used in the film was not included on the soundtrack CD).  But as a film, come on, it's only about 45 minutes long (with special feature bonus material, about an hour). It can't possibly be that difficult to compile film to make it last longer than an hour. Anything less than an hour these days, let's face it, is somewhat of a disappointment. Jack Johnson's involvement added to the film, though. Nicely done, let's just have more of it. I'm glad to have it in my DVD collection, though.",3,Not bad,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,1360,"['Compared', 'other', 'surf', 'films', 'being', 'flooded', 'market', 'days', 'not', 'bad', 'Music', 'good', 'footage', 'good', 'note', 'SHOT', 'ON', 'FILM', 'not', 'video', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'were', 'have', 'clear', 'scenery', 'change', 'indicator', 'tell', 'where', 'really', 'were', 'traditional', 'Irish', 'folk', 'music', 'obviously', 'indicated', 'were', 'surfing', 'Ireland', 'Director', 'commentary', 'witty', 'insightful', 'perspective', 'few', 'surf', 'films', 'give', 'basically', 'good', 'reason', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'version', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'local', 'surf', 'shop', 'included', 'second', 'disc', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'Very', 'nice', 'unique', 'marketing', 'packaging', 'idea', 'actually', 'convinced', 'purchase', 'package', 'More', 'importantly', 'music', 'actually', 'good', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Irish', 'folk', 'music', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'film', 'come', 'only', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'special', 'feature', 'bonus', 'material', 'hour', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'difficult', 'compile', 'film', 'make', 'last', 'longer', 'hour', 'Anything', 'less', 'hour', 'days', 'let', 'face', 'somewhat', 'disappointment', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'involvement', 'added', 'film', 'though', 'Nicely', 'done', 'let', 'just', 'have', 'more', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'though']",Thicker Than Water
784287,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0000UX52K,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 2]","I had never heard of Jack Johnson before I came upon his DVD called Thicker Than Water, at a used DVD store, which, if the DVD package was accurate, seemed to be a documentary about sailing around the world. The back cover features robed Buddhists on the bow of a boat, in an exotic sunset. Could this be a Generation X riff on the whole Seven Years In Tibet theme? I did not know, but always one to enjoy offbeat documentaries, I decided to give it a whirl. Was I surprised, or what?Well, the disk is a documentary, but not of water-centered cultures about the world, nor of existentialism in a Thoreauvian vein admixed with rock music. No, instead it's a surfer film, although not of the sort brought to you by Hollywood airheads. It follows a group of young twentysomething surfers who spent a year and a half in the early part of this decade just bumming around beaches all about the world, and shooting their adventures with an old 16mm camera. It is part home movie, part guerilla filmmaking, part acid trip, part bad garage band, and all in all oddly interesting, if not riveting. There are, of course, some great shots of young studs riding through tubes of water- although very few bikini babes, and a good deal of lite pop music, spiced with a bluesy vein, by Johnson. His tunes are most akin to the music of The White Stripes, albeit a bit mellower, but nothing much really happens in the forty-five minutes of the main film. We see surfing in different locale, hear random voices come on and off and say things banal and observant, but, I guess, not much more can be expected from Johnson, who was a former pro surfer whose career ended after an accident, and has since become an alternative music icon, of sorts.Don't get me wrong, some of Johnson's music is evocative, and he does seem like a nice enough guy. I just wonder what sort of vanity is behind such an exercise? That said, the camerawork is much better than one might expect from mere amateurs, but what deeper point is there in the whole exercise, apart from a vanity video. There are scenes that a filmmaker with a real vision could have cut together with much more effective music. The documentary- if one can really call it that; it's more of an extended music video, travels from Tahiti to India to Ireland to Australia to Hawaii and to many unnamed ports of call, seems like the first rough cut of a filmmaker trying to find his way, not a finished product.All in all, this is the sort of DVD to watch if you're a teenager with a little bit too much weed and not enough pals to toke it with, but it is not a film for a serious cineaste, nor even a serious surfer, for the waves within the film are rather paltry. Not that any of that is necessarily a bad thing, but it's certainly not too good of a thing, either. The fact that it could have been more suggests that the boys' youth was to blame. Ah, youth! If you need me to fill in the rest of that observation you will know how I felt watching Thicker Than Water.

784289,AMI0C2C9QS8U3,B0000UX52K,j.,"[25, 26]","""Thicker Than Water,"" the soundtrack to a documentary surfing film by Jack Johnson, manages to capture the heart of the laid-back beach style, and also the exoticism of the world's beaches that Johnson explores in the documentary (in the same vein as ""The Endless Summer."")  A slew of artists have been collected to contribute their two cents, and for the most part, it comes across as a nice blend of styles, voices, tones, and rhythms.  The music provided seems to float gently over your ears like a breeze off the ocean and keep you captivated like a Hawai'ian sunset.Johnson's influence is very present throughout the album despite the fact that he only sings on two tracks.  Indeed, the album sounds something like a Jack Johnson tribute record, with many artists guesting to capture the same spirit of sunsents and surfboards that Johnson seems to always find so effortlessly.  The music is upbeat enough to keep one's interest peaked, although relaxed acoustic guitars definitely dominate the landscape.Johnson nay-sayers will enjoy the fact that the album shows a little more diversity than his albums are usually known for, and even Johnson's hardcore fans will find the new music different but non-threatening.The Johnson-G.Love duet ""Rainbow"" is especially poignant, picking right up where Johnson's ""Brushfire Fairytales"" album left off.",5,Good stuff...,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,1349,"['Thicker', 'Than', 'Water', 'soundtrack', 'documentary', 'surfing', 'film', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'capture', 'heart', 'laid-back', 'beach', 'style', 'also', 'exoticism', 'world', 'beaches', 'Johnson', 'documentary', 'same', 'vein', 'Endless', 'Summer', 'slew', 'artists', 'have', 'been', 'collected', 'contribute', 'two', 'cents', 'most', 'part', 'nice', 'blend', 'styles', 'voices', 'tones', 'rhythms', 'music', 'provided', 'float', 'gently', 'ears', 'breeze', 'ocean', 'keep', 'captivated', ""Hawai'ian"", 'sunset.Johnson', 'influence', 'very', 'present', 'album', 'fact', 'only', 'two', 'tracks', 'Indeed', 'album', 'something', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'tribute', 'record', 'many', 'artists', 'guesting', 'capture', 'same', 'spirit', 'sunsents', 'surfboards', 'Johnson', 'always', 'find', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'music', 'upbeat', 'enough', 'keep', 'one', 'interest', 'peaked', 'relaxed', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'definitely', 'dominate', 'landscape.Johnson', 'nay-sayers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'album', 'little', 'more', 'diversity', 'albums', 'are', 'usually', 'known', 'even', 'Johnson', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'new', 'music', 'different', 'non-threatening.The', 'Johnson-G.Love', 'duet', 'Rainbow', 'especially', 'poignant', 'picking', 'right', 'where', 'Johnson', 'Brushfire', 'Fairytales', 'album', 'left', 'off']",Thicker Than Water
