Who is he? Where did he come from? Why is he there? Why is the idiot son drooling all over one of the female guests? Why does he dress her in doll's clothes? Who is the mysterious evil girl ghost?

1232478,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B001R10BIW,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Why is it in almost every movie about a couple traveling the backwoods at night, when they inevitably wreck in the middle of nowhere and stumble upon the requisite creepy old farmhouse, it&#8217;s always the couple that are having marital problems, most often caused by the death of a child?  I&#8217;m not even going to bother trying to count the number of movies off the top of my head that fit this mold, but it would certainly take both hands to do so.  And it&#8217;s such a dumb clich&eacute;.  Like we don&#8217;t know by now that the estranged couple is going to wind up happy and at peace with each other in the end.  Blah blah blah.In this case, it&#8217;s 2008 and the movie is HOUSE, taken from a novel by Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti (which immediately lets us know there&#8217;s going to be some religious angle to what will follow).  Jack (Reynaldo Rosales, &#8220;The Mentalist&#8221;) and Stephanie (Heidi Dippold, &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221;) are on their way to Montgomery, AL to see a marriage counselor, one of many such appointments brought on by the death of their daughter.  Jack was writing, Stephanie (a singer) was on the phone with her agent when Melissa wanted to go ice skating.  She fell through the ice while Stephanie wasn&#8217;t watching and ever since the couple have been at each other&#8217;s throats.  Meanwhile, the audience doesn&#8217;t care.They get two flat tires while taking a short cut given to them by the local lawman, Michael Madsen, playing Michael Madsen, and instead of sitting tight, they decide to get out and go for help.  They have to get out because there&#8217;s no service on Stephanie&#8217;s cell phone.  Obviously.  Because if there was, this movie would have been about 15 minutes long.  On the other hand, that would have saved me from the torture of yet another halfway decent horror movie ruined by a stupid and badly executed ending.As I was saying.So they find The Wayside Inn, a cozy B&B; off the beaten path, and they go inside and find Randy (J.P. Davis, FIGHTING TOMMY RILEY) and Leslie (Julie Ann Emery, &#8220;Dexter&#8221;), another traveling couple looking for shelter from the storm raging outside.  They are then met by Betty, the inn&#8217;s owner, and her two sons, Pete and Stewart.  Pete is played by an unrecognizable Lew Temple (&#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221;) and gives a super creepy performance, while Stewart is played by Bill Moseley and gives a standard Bill Moseley performance.The owners are creepy and the guests are, understandably, creeped out, but they all sit down to dinner until Stephanie decides she can&#8217;t stay there and tries to leave.  But there&#8217;s a figure outside the door and Betty, the owner, is visibly frightened, locking the doors and closing a set of metal gates across them for double security.It&#8217;s the Tin Man, she says.  And his rules are as follows: 1) God came into my house and I killed him. 2) I&#8217;ll kill anyone who comes into my house like I killed God. 3) Give me one dead body by sunrise and I&#8217;ll forego Rule #2.Panic follows until the guests realize the owners might be just as dangerous as the Tin Man, and everyone splits up to look for safety or escape, while around them the house begins to unleash its powers, playing on their weaknesses and finding the sins in their hearts to make them turn on each other.For the next 40 minutes or so, we&#8217;re treated to what, in more capable hands than director Robby Henson, could have been a seriously weird psychedelic trip through the labyrinth beneath the house as the guests relive their worst memories.Unfortunately, it all felt too much like made-for-TV horror which, in more cases than not, is barely horror at all.  And then finally we get to the big climax, and that&#8217;s when what little tension and mystery that had built up was punched in the gut and left gasping in the dirt while this even weaker attempt at suspension of disbelief played out like a bad 7th grade play written by that annoying goth girl who, at 12 years old, thought she had it all figured out.This was the point at which Michael Madsen made it abundantly clear he was doing this movie for the paycheck.  I mean, I love me some Madsen, but you can tell when he really enjoys a movie he&#8217;s working on and when he&#8217;s got bills due.My biggest problem with this wasn&#8217;t the script, which was weak, or the acting, which was also pretty bad.  It was with the utter unoriginality of the whole thing.  You&#8217;ve seen this movie before.  It might have had a different name and different characters, but the end result and the moral of the story are so identical to countless other movies, it renders seeing this one moot.  That&#8217;s not a good thing to do in a movie.I enjoyed the crazy house and some of the beautiful set designs, but everything else here was pretty much a waste of a morning for me.  You can move along, there&#8217;s nothing to see here.",3,House.,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,4950,"['Why', 'almost', 'movie', 'couple', 'traveling', 'backwoods', 'night', 'when', 'inevitably',

I hid my eyes through all of Blair Witch Project, and I have yet to see the entire film The Exorcist without spending time under the blanket terrified. So when I tell you that this movie didn't even make me cringe, turn away, or be afraid of the dark, then it means IT WAS BAD. I gave it two stars because I am a person who can appreciate when a movie does a lot with a small budget. Now, that being said, it was still terrible. More campy fun than campfire horror, it just wasn't believable or frightening. Worse still is the fact that I couldn't give a damn by the end if the characters lived or died, so you find yourself just watching it all of the way through just to get it over with.

I was prepared to dislike this movie, but was surprised by the end;  parts of the ending are a tad too chirpy;  I would have made it darker.Theme:  bat-crazy Christian revenge complex for what you think you did wrong.  Trouble is, there are many Christians who are this bat crazy in real life.  So the theme is not that far-fetched.  Has nothing to do with the Bible, of course.Madsen was great in this;  casting was good, all-around.  There is an MTV quality to the film, which takes away some of the horror, but they were trying to capture the Stephen-King weirdness -- think of 'A Town Called Desperation' -- so I understand why the director ordered the scenes as he did.Directing, film editing, camera angles, script and acting are MEANT to be just above grade-B, because the idea is 'what if a grade-B drive-in horror story actually happened to you?'  So it's got a campy edge.  While watching, you're constantly unsure whether to deem the film as drive-in quality.. or surreal, prime-quality horror.When horror happens in real life, it has the same features: fun-house mirror moments, mundane stuff, and true terror -- all mixed together.

Whether we're talking about The Exorcist where good somehow manages to conquer evil or in cases where evil prevails like End of The Line and Frailty, religious horror films aren't going away anytime soon and we can expect to see them as long as movies are still being made.Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker are two well-know names in the common Christian fiction library. Although there stories are usually a bit dark or murky if you will, both writers have the tendency to spread the words of comfort and even hope in the most drastic situations. House is the only collaboration between the two gentlemen and it actually works quite well with it's sinister plot. As a film, it's quite good when you place it up against all the other copycat horror flicks or countless remakes.Although House could be construed as a moralistic or spiritual journey, do not make the mistake of assuming it's light-hearted fare nor is it overly preachy as Christian films have sometimes garnered the reputation of being a bit heavy-handed and self-righteous. Peretti and Dekker rather give us a suspenseful, if not immensely spooky film which also avoids all the typical cliches of modern horror cinema.The plot itself seems quite basic and even elements of the story will remind viewers of other typical horror fare meant for the enthusiast who endures mediocre entertainment. In fact, I personally avoided this one for the longest time and even scoffed at it a bit until just recently.Although other films in years gone by have been made with similar storylines, I can't really recall a recent entry being quite this good or working so well on many different levels. At the end of the film, I couldn't possibly see how any level-headed moviegoer could be severely disappointed. With it's modest flaws, House still manages to be an effective chiller which takes full advantage of great acting and the lighting alone is nothing less than a grand spectacle.House opens up with a tragic murder taking place in a beautiful horror somewhere in Montgomery, Alabama.(How ironic is that considering the film was supposedly shot completely in Poland?) Unfortunately, the viewer has no idea what's taking place or why the murder was committed leaving us to marinate in suspense as we are then introduced to two more couple traveling through town who somehow end up at the same bed and breakfast. No sooner than they arrive, things start to get a bit strange and it's pretty obvious the owners of this establishment know a bit more about these couples than our leads would care to acknowledge.No sooner than dinner has been served, a homicidal maniac begins to terrorize the Inn and he wants to play a game with the couples. The rules are pretty routine and the viewer can almost be sure that rules are going to be broken even before things really take off. Written on the side of a tin can, three rules will apply to the guests. First rule, God came into my house and I killed him, second rule, I will kill anyone who comes into my house like I killed God, third rule, Give me one dead body before sunrise and I'll let rule number two slide... The Tin Man only ""goes after the guilty."" Someone has to die - if the rest are to live. There has to be a sacrifice, or they all will die.Through the next half of the film, our characters find themselves trying to make sense of the insanity around them while battling their own internal demons or repressed ghosts. Although it may too late for some of the guests to get out alive, no life will leave unchanged by the series of events that take place before morning comes.Again, the acting is top-notch. Even though House benefits greatly from great performances given by virtually unknown actors or actresses, horror fanatics will immediately recognized a few faces from the past. Bill Moseley, Leslie Easterbrook, and underrated Michael Madsen give very good performances which aid the film quite a bit. Probability suggests House wouldn't have worked nearly as well in the hands of less capable actors and actresses.Final verdict: Go watch House even if you're not a Christian or have very little interest in religion. Although the Christian parallels are omni-present, House is clearly a horror film which rightfully earns it's R-rating and you shouldn't have to worry about having strong beliefs shoved down your throat for the most part. Instead, House is an entertaining yet psychological and supernatural film which becomes something more than it should have been given the subject matter.",4,Our House In The Middle Of The

My guess is that most of these reviews are from folks who aren't fans of the horror genre in general. The reason I think this, is that most horror fans have seen the elements in ""House"" used in literally hundreds of previous horror films and TV shows.If you are going into this film with expectations of another ""Amityville Horror"" you are going to be disappointed. ""House"" really isn't a haunted house movie, and though the prologue is definately a rip-off of the crimes central to the ""Amityville"" films, ""House"" isn't a typical ""ghost story"". Beyond ""Amityville"", ""House"" also ""borrows"" pretty liberally from ""The Skeleton Key"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""Venom"", ""American Gothic"", ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Beetlejuice"". Actually, there is very little that is original in ""House"" at all.If you are looking for another great Bill Moseley character along the lines of Chop Top or Otis Firefly, keep looking. Moseley appears here in what is basically an extended cameo. The rest of the cast does a decent job with what they are given, but it's the same old tired story we have seen hundreds of times before:1.Arguing couple gets lost out in the boonies.2.There is car trouble, and arguing couple walks to local creepy house.3.Arguing couple meets another couple of victims..er..I mena another couple.4.Proprieters of creepy house are weird.5.Strange things happen that threaten both couples.6.Secrets from the past begin to emerge and couples must face past sins.7.Strange child may offer some hope for doomed couples.I won't spoil the flick by getting into specifics, but rest assured, if you are a horror fan, you'll figure everything out by the half-hour mark.Now, there are some decent visuals in the film. The titular house is creepy looking, the music sets a decent tone, and Michael Madsen plays a good over-the-top role.

But the verse itself refers to Jesus, He is the light, who came into the darkness, which is our sinful world, and the darkness knoweth it not, which is that our world did not recognize Jesus as the Son of God when He came into our world as a human being.

Unfortunately, this movie has neither, which consequently causes it to be as one reviewer put it ""mildy entertaining.""I've received positive feedback from kids about the movies ""Invisible Enemies Among Us"" and ""Hangman's Curse"", but even those movies can't really be called scary.

There's not even much here that you can use to have a discussion about afterwards.  I mean let's be serious.  A guy standing outside the door with a gun in his hand is just not that scary to me.  Now if he was really ugly like Freddy, or indestructable like Jason, maybe it would be a different story.  But towards the end I was like why don't you just shoot the guy and get the movie over with?At least the movie starts making a little bit of sense towards the end, but unfortunately it still gives the wrong impression that there are second chances after death.  And although they did mention the light, the movie made no attempt to identify who that light is.  By doing these things, to me the movie becomes pointless as a Christian movie because it has no redemptive value.

I got online to see if I could find some reviews or analysis of this movie that discussed the symbolism and what it represented biblically.  Unfortunately I can't find anything anywhere about that.  I wish the author of the book had a clear explanantion somewhere as to what represented what in this book.  I am still confused about it.  From what I understand from reading the blurb on the back of the dvd, the guests in the house are haunted by their past ""sins"".  However, I found the people in the house were haunted not so much by the sins they committed....but by the sins other people had committed against them.  For example, one of the men killed his father as a boy...the father was physically abusive to him.  Of course it is wrong that he killed his father (of course) but that scenario was about a child being preyed upon by a physically abusive man.  The other scenario was a woman beingmolested by her Uncle who she also killed.  However, we are putting all the blame on the victims who were molested and abused.  I would have understood it more if they had their sins be more clearly their fault, rather than temporary insanity due to being victimized by abusers.  I didn't particularly care for blaming abused children for reacting violently to their abusers.  The other couple had a child drown after her parents were distracted and did not realize she had fallen through the ice.  Again, I wondered about this.  All the times tragic things happen to children when parents turn their back for one second.  A toddler wanders out of the house while mom has her back turned for a minute, and next thing you know she gets in the road and is hit by a car.  There are so many parents out there who have lost a child and NOT because they were intentionally negligent.  They did not mean to harm their child.  Any parent knows that it is always that 1 second you had your back turned, when the child will do something and get hurt.  We all live in fear of that . To me, it was more like these people were haunted by their past ISSUES...more than their ""sins""....However, the blurb on the dvd said it was their ""Sins"" and to me they picked ""sins"" that were mostly the result of victimization.  Also, I did not understand who the little girl represented.  Was she supposed to be the Holy Spirit?  When they said that one person had to be sacrificed by dawn were they trying to imply that their had to be a sacrifice for all their sins?? Was the little girl supposed to be representing Jesus as a sacrifice? So much of this movie left me going...huh??

A few particular scenes that filled me with dread and apprehension were pretty much absent (except for the smoke from a cut, that I did have relief they included). Furthermore, the main villain, Tin Man, is faithfully based on who he is in the book- completely apathetic about what people think of him and acts like a cultically religious moral thermometer (even though he claims to have killed God and expects survivors to kill one of their own off... then just maybe he'll reconsider). What most people who read the book, saw the movie, and still hated it likely missed was one unique symbolism in the storyline- that the four people within this house trying to escape are four living factors of the darkness of the human heart (more thoroughly explained in the book).And my favorite character in the book, the very mysterious girl who helps those willing to get out, is entirely faithful as she is in the book- full of gothic beauty, knowing things that are impossible for her to know, willing to face off against evil right in its face, reveal its lies, even at the cost of her life, and making sacrifices to help others. By the way, the same girl who played as Kevin Parrish's childhood friend in THR3E also plays this girl, and she does it very well.So... the R rating? Completely uncalled for. Ted Dekker had been making notices of it throughout the progress of the film that they tried to make it, at most, PG-13, but the people were too staunch that no Christian would want to see it, so they made it a mandatory R, even though there's obviously not enough content at all in the film to justify it. No bloody guts, explicit violence, sex, almost no language (and what there is more of mild slang).Now, for a confession, I didn't really enjoy the ending of the book, thought it was rather cheesy, so I was glad of the alternate twist ending (for the movie only) that Ted helped work out. This ending made much more sense to me.I just wish there were more scenes from the book in this film, other than that, I really liked it. And no, it's not your typical slasher-flick of a horror movie, more of a dark supernatural suspense/thriller.",4,"Decent adaptation of the book, better than THR3E movie",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,2614,"['When', 'heard', 'book', 'was', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'realyl', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Christian', 'horror', 'time', 'only', 'enjoy', 'book', 'thoroughly', 'one', 'particular', 'element', 'stereotypical', 'horror', 'couples', 'going', 'haunted', 'house', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'formula', 'entirely.The', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', 'independent', 'film', 'more', 'decent', 'job', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'flick', 'THR3E', 'pretty', 'much', 'failed', 'job', 'few', 'particular', 'scenes', 'filled', 'dread', 'apprehension', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'absent', 'smoke', 'cut', 'did', 'have', 'relief', 'included', 'Furthermore', 'main', 'villain', 'Tin', 'Man', 'faithfully', 'based', 'who', 'book-', 'completely', 'apathetic', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'acts', 'cultically', 'religious', 'moral', 'thermometer', 'even', 'have', 'killed', 'God', 'survivors', 'kill', 'one', 'own', 'off', 'then', 'just', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'reconsider', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'still', 'hated', 'likely', 'missed', 'was', 'one', 'unique', 'symbolism', 'storyline-', 'four', 'people', 'house', 'trying', 'escape', 'are', 'four', 'living', 'factors', 'darkness', 'human', 'heart', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'explained', 'book', '.And', 'favorite', 'character', 'book', 'very', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'who', 'willing', 'get', 'out', 'entirely', 'faithful', 'book-', 'full', 'gothic', 'beauty', 'knowing', 'things', 'are', 'impossible', 'know', 'willing', 'face', 'off', 'evil', 'right', 'face', 'reveal', 'lies', 'even', 'cost', 'life', 'making', 'sacrifices', 'help', 'others', 'way', 'same', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Parrish', 'childhood', 'friend', 'THR3E', 'also', 'girl', 'very', 'well.So', 'R', 'rating', 'Completely', 'uncalled', 'Ted', 'Dekker', 'had', 'been', 'making', 'notices', 'progress', 'film', 'tried', 'make', 'most', 'PG-13', 'people', 'were', 'too', 'staunch', 'Christian', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'made', 'mandatory', 'R', 'even', 'obviously', 'not', 'enough', 'content', 'film', 'justify', 'bloody', 'guts', 'explicit', 'violence', 'sex', 'almost', 'language', 'what', 'more', 'mild', 'slang', '.Now', 'confession', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'book', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'was', 'glad', 'alternate', 'twist', 'ending', 'movie', 'only', 'Ted', 'helped', 'work', 'out', 'ending', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'me.I', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'book', 'film', 'other', 'really', 'liked', 'not', 'typical', 'slasher-flick', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'dark', 'supernatural', 'suspense/thriller']",House

Tourists in a rural southeast state - Alabama this time - take a detour off the interstate and blow out multiple tires on a remote road.  Along with another stranded couple, they happen upon a large bed and breakfast estate (picture Amityville for the visual) run by Betty (Leslie Easterbrook) and her two no-doubt inbred sons, Pete and Stewart.  When the lights go out and rain begins to pour, a mysterious shotgun-wielding figure named Tin Man throws a bullet-riddled tin can through the door with the following notes:Rule 1: You don't talk about Fight Club (just kidding)...This is Tin Man's houseRule 2: Tin Man will kill all who enter the houseRule 3: If one guest kills another before sunrise, Rule 2 is disregardedClearly, the setup isn't the problem.  The aforementioned formula has worked before.  Unfortunately, after the first act things get messy.  There is a little bit of The House on Haunted Hill, the smoke monster from Lost, Michael Madsden in a watered down version of Billy Zane's role from Demon Knight, throw in your favorite hillbilly stereotype, a dash of Event Horizon, maybe even some of The Last Dragon, and just about every horror cliche ever used.  Seriously.  It's just too much to actually work.Led by horror stalwart Easterbrook, the cast does fairly well with minimal and predictable plot.  I mean, when the beginning of the movie can do no better than blatantly rip off a derivative like Wrong Turn, you know there wasn't a big budget for anything as trivial as storyline.  As mentioned, however, Easterbrook does a good job repeating her psychotic mother role from The Devil's Rejects, keeping the plot explanation minimal and the crazy ratcheted tight.  Reynaldo Rosales turns in a competent day's work, and Julie Ann Emery exudes terror and a troubled past.  The only outlier is J.P. Davis as Randy; he just doesn't have the emotional chops or range to be with even a cast like this.The script is midget-trying-to-dunk a basketball overachieving.  The minimal FX were decent but very hard to appreciate while contemplating the fact that not everyone should write or direct a movie.

House is an inconsistent, dull horror film.First, the story, as clich&eacute; as it may sound, had strong potential. The large isolated house setting is creepy, and it occasionally uses psychological horror (the house often uses their deepest fears to manipulate the guests); it's not very effective, but it's a bit redeeming and it's an effort I appreciate. However, you never really feel a connection with the characters, and one of them is actually very annoying (which I usually don't mind), so that negatively affects the impact of the psychological horror; Stephanie nags and nags throughout the movie, and it ends up being unjustifiable (you'd expect her rotten personality to stem from her husband/marriage, but it's not... it's just rotten from the beginning.) Now for the horror, since it is a horror film; everything in this film feels mashed up, basically inconsistent, it throws everything at you with little connection or explanation; here's one scene, BAM!, here's the next one; so the suspense is absent, the jump-scares are ineffective, and the horror-like atmosphere is nonexistent. The ending was unexpected, but not in a good way; I won't spoil it, but its ending is mediocre. The acting was okay, it does get bad at times.Overall, the film has a few decent moments, but not enough to redeem the inconsistencies, the mediocre acting, the unjustifiably annoying character(s), and the lack of terror. As of 4/2/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, avoid purchasing, rent with caution.House has violence and blood.",2,"An inconsistent, dull horror film...

1232524,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001R10BIW,Mark Turner,"[5, 6]","There is a new genre of horror film growing that I recently read about in the pages of Rue Morgue Magazine. The genre is Christian horror films. Though it may sound like an unlikely combination, it is here and on the rise as well.You could go back as far as THE OMEN of THE EXORCIST to find the beginnings of the genre, but even recently we have seen movies like THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE take off and become a blockbuster film. Now we have a new movie to add to the mix, a bit more subtle in some ways and not in others.HOUSE is based on the book of the same name by famed authors Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker. The story begins innocently enough (as they always do) with a couple on the road getting lost in the boonies. This particular couple, Jack and Stephanie Singleton (Reynaldo Rosales and Heidi Dippold), are on their way to Montgomery to visit and marriage counselor.Along the way they are re-routed by a helpful policeman (Michael Madsen) and take a short cut only to end with two flat tires and what looks like another possible couple in the same boat. Following the road they come to the Wayside Inn where they find no help but they do find the other couple, Randy (J, P, Davis) and Leslie (Julie Ann Emery). The power goes out, they find lanterns and then they find the caretakers as well, an oddball backwoods pair who seem to have come out of the past. They inform them that on a rainy night like this no tow truck will be able to help them and that they'll have to spend the night.Betty (Leslie Easterbrook) appears to be in charge and she's all about manners and trying to make things fine for the two couples. Pete (Lew Temple) is definitely a few fries short of a fun meal and more interested in Leslie than anything else. As dinner is about to be served, the last house member shows up. Stewart (Bill Moseley) is a roughneck with no holding for sinners.As odd things happen (like they haven't already) Stephanie panics and heads for the front door to get out only to find someone standing in the yard, flashlight in one hand, shotgun in the other. Betty blames them from bringing ""him"" back...the Tin Man.  The Tin Man tosses in a can with his rules. Rule 1, this is his house. Rule 2, anyone who enters his house he will kill. Rule 3, kill one person before sunrise and he'll forget rule 2.Angered at their supposed bringing the Tin Man back. Betty and her clan set about containing the four ""guests"". As they attempt to lock them in the freezer, the two couples escape and head out in different directions.While Stephanie disappears as does Leslie, Jack and Randy search for a way out. What they discover in the basement is more worrisome though, Satanic symbols on the walls, draped over images and tunnels that go every which way. And as they are separated and continue to search, they come across a ghost or two as well.The biggest twist to the house is not the people running it. The twist is that the house knows its guests. It knows what eats at them. It knows what they did in their pasts. It knows what haunts them. And it will use this information to manipulate them all.What we have is neither a simple ghost story nor a tale of satanic rites being enacted on innocents. There are no truly innocent members in this group. One killed a father, one an uncle and two are suffering from the accidental death of their child. What the house offers them is a chance at redemption. But in what form? Will it be delivered to them if they take the life of one or if they sacrifice their own lives willingly? Or is there another alternative?The movie offers some creepy moments but at the same time relies too heavily on the tried and true worn down appearance of the house and beaten down look of Betty and her group. Anyone who couldn't tell this bunch was off in 5 seconds deserves what comes to them.But it's not the actors or their roles that draw the attention. It's the story that brings about that sense of loss and search for hope in the midst of something so terrible that carries the film. No, this is not GONE WITH THE WIND. It is not the grandest horror film ever made. But it is well made and suitable for younger, though not too young, viewers with its lack of gore and blood.If you're looking for a solid horror film with more story and blood, give this one a try. If you're looking for something with a little hope to it, try it as well. Just know that the expected doesn't always happen in films like this, Christian horror or not.",4,HAUNTS INSIDE WORSE THAN THOSE OUT,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,4471,"['new', 'genre', 'horror', 'film', 'growing', 'recently', 'read', 'pages', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'Magazine', 'genre', 'Christian', 'horror', 'films', 'may', 'sound', 'unlikely', 'combination', 'here', 'rise', 'well.You', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'find', 'beginnings', 'genre', 'even', 'recently', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'EXORCISM', 'OF', 'EMILY', 'ROSE', 'take', 'off', 'become', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'Now', 'have', 'new', 'movie', 'add', 'mix', 'bit', 'more', 'subtle', 'ways', 'not', 'others.HOUSE', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'famed', 'authors', 'Frank', 'Peretti', 'Ted', 'Dekker', 'story', 'innocently', 'enough', 'always', 'do', 'couple', 'road', 'getting', 'lost', 'boonies', 'particular', 'couple', 'Jack', 'Stephanie', 'Singleton', 'Reynaldo', 'Rosales', 'Heidi', 'Dippold', 'are', 'way', 'Montgomery', 'visit', 'marriage', 'counselor.Along', 'way', 'are', 're-routed', 'helpful', 'policeman', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'take', 'short', 'cut', 'only', 'end', 'two', 'flat', 'tires', 'what', 'possible', 'couple', 'same', 'boat', 'Following', 'road', 'come', 'Wayside', 'Inn', 'where', 'find', 'help', 'do', 'find', 'other', 'couple', 'Randy', 'J', 'P', 'Davis', 'Leslie', 'Julie', 'Ann', 'Emery', 'power', 'out', 'find', 'lanterns', 'then', 'find', 'caretakers', 'as', 'well', 'oddball', 'backwoods', 'pair', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'come', 'past', 'inform', 'rainy', 'night', 'tow', 'truck', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'help', ""'ll"", 'have', 'spend', 'night.Betty', 'Leslie', 'Easterbrook', 'be', 'charge', 'manners', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'fine', 'two', 'couples', 'Pete', 'Lew', 'Temple', 'definitely', 'few', 'fries', 'short', 'fun', 'meal', 'more', 'interested', 'Leslie', 'anything', 'else', 'dinner', 'be', 'served', 'last', 'house', 'member', 'up', 'Stewart', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'roughneck', 'holding', 'sinners.As', 'odd', 'things', 'happen', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'Stephanie', 'panics', 'heads', 'front', 'door', 'get', 'out', 'only', 'find', 'someone', 'standing', 'yard', 'flashlight', 'one', 'hand', 'shotgun', 'other', 'Betty', 'bringing', 'back', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Tin', 'Man', 'can', 'rules', 'Rule', '1', 'house', 'Rule', '2', 'anyone', 'who', 'house', 'will', 'kill', 'Rule', '3', 'kill', 'one', 'person', 'sunrise', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'rule', '2.Angered', 'supposed', 'bringing', 'Tin', 'Man', 'back', 'Betty', 'clan', 'set', 'containing', 'four', 'guests', 'attempt', 'lock', 'freezer', 'two', 'couples', 'escape', 'head', 'out', 'different', 'directions.While', 'Stephanie', 'Leslie', 'Jack', 'Randy', 'search', 'way', 'out', 'What', 'discover', 'basement', 'more', 'worrisome', 'Satanic', 'walls', 'draped', 'images', 'tunnels', 'go', 'way', 'are', 'separated', 'continue', 'search', 'come', 'ghost', 'two', 'well.The', 'biggest', 'twist', 'house', 'not', 'people', 'running', 'twist', 'house', 'guests', 'what', 'what', 'did', 'pasts', 'what', 'will', 'use', 'information', 'manipulate', 'have', 'simple', 'ghost', 'story', 'tale', 'satanic', 'rites', 'being', 'enacted', 'innocents', 'are', 'truly', 'innocent', 'members', 'group', 'One', 'killed', 'father', 'one', 'uncle', 'two', 'are', 'suffering', 'accidental', 'death', 'child', 'What', 'house', 'chance', 'redemption', 'what', 'form', 'Will', 'be', 'delivered', 'take', 'life', 'one', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'lives', 'willingly', 'there', 'alternative', 'movie', 'creepy', 'moments', 'same', 'time', 'relies', 'too', 'heavily', 'tried', 'true', 'worn', 'down', 'appearance', 'house', 'beaten', 'down', 'look', 'Betty', 'group', 'Anyone', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'bunch', 'was', 'off', '5', 'seconds', 'what', 'them.But', 'not', 'actors', 'roles', 'draw', 'attention', 'story', 'sense', 'loss', 'search', 'hope', 'midst', 'something', 'so', 'terrible', 'film', 'No', 'not', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'not', 'grandest', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'well', 'made', 'suitable', 'younger', 'not', 'too', 'young', 'viewers', 'lack', 'gore', 'blood.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'story', 'blood', 'give', 'one', 'try', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'hope', 'try', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'know', 'expected', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'films', 'Christian', 'horror', 'not']",House

This is Dekker's second book-to-film experience. His first was Thr3e and I must say that House is a better film.You would expect that since they have a larger budget and updated equipment.There aren't any big name actors in this film. They are, however actors that you may remember from other films.We have Julie Ann Emery (from Hitch), Bill Moseley (from the Halloween remake), and Michael Madsen (from Free Willy) starring.Two couples find themselves in a creepy house. There are three tenents who offer them a place to stay (it's kinda like an Inn). Things go from creepy to worse when one of them tries to leave and there's a man blocking their escape. He's the Tin Man and he wants one person to die tonight. All they have to do is decide which one.But there's something deeper going on...and when they find a little girl who's been hiding in the basement, you'll never know who to trust.The acting is much better in this film. The people who live in the house are just as creepy on screen as they were in the book.With a run-time of just over 80 minutes, you don't get as much story as you did in the book. But that works just fine in a horror movie. The time spent down in the basement often got confusing in the book. Here, you follow each character and won't get lost.House is rated R but there is no nudity, no sexual content, and I don't think there's even blood - I could be wrong though. There are a couple moments where people cuss but it's very minor. (Get Short this movie is not). I think one of the big reasons this film got an R rating is because someone points and shoots a little girl with a shot gun. If you have a film where kids are in danger/harm, the ratings will become PG-13 or R very quickly.The ending was a little cheesy; this whole idea behind the ""light"" didn't quite work out as to be expected.

1232529,AYHN143TK8ZP2,B001R10BIW,Mishael Austin Witty,"[1, 1]","I almost quit watching this after the first few minutes. In fact, I did quit watching it after the first 15-20 minutes, but I went back to it a couple of days later just to see how it all turned out. I'm a curious soul, and I will stand and watch a metaphorical (not real) train wreck all the way to the end, just in the hopes it's really not all as bad as I think it is. I'm frequently disappointed.Here's what I didn't like about the movie from the get-go:1. The argument between Stephanie and Jack at the beginning is SO stilted and fake! There were really long beats (pauses) that just didn't make sense. In a real, intense argument, you don't take long pauses. You jump on what the other person is saying to try to get your point across. I mean, I know this was a movie and not real life, but it just didn't ring true at all and really grated on my nerves. Still, I kept watching...2. The screaming. Oh my goodness! There was WAY too much screaming (mostly from the actress who tried to effectively play the role of Stephanie). I turned the sound down during most of those ""scary"" action scenes, which weren't very scary.3. Not enough psychological horror. There was some, but it wasn't enough. I couldn't really get into the characters' heads enough to appreciate the fear they were feeling. Creepy guy chasing them with a gun through a creepy house, and that was it. I'm sure it was scary for the characters, but it just didn't really ""do it"" for me. Still, I kept watching...4. I didn't really get what was happening. I mean, I understood who the Tin Man was once he revealed himself, but I didn't understand why he had a fake Tin Man chained up. What was the fake Tin Man's purpose? Also, who was this dark-haired girl full of light (other than a Christ figure)? Where did she come from? And why was she hiding in the basement until this particular opportune moment when Jack found her? I just didn't get it.Here are the things I loved:1. I loved that, even though there were some violent things going on, you didn't see a lot of blood and gore. I'm not a fan of slasher movies, and for quite a while I was afraid that this was going to be one of those (another reason I almost quit watching). I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't like that at all.2. I loved the scenes where Julie Ann Emery's character is reliving her childhood trauma. They just struck me as being very artistically well done, and I loved the emotion she displayed (both as the hurt little child and the victorious little child/adult who just wasn't going to take it anymore). For me, these scenes almost made the rest of the movie worth watching. Almost.I haven't read the book. I own it. It's sitting on my shelf. I just haven't read it yet, and now I'm not sure that I want to, except for the fact that other reviewers have mentioned that this movie is nothing like the book. So...I might give it a try.Overall, do I recommend this movie? No, but it's not a bad way to spend a lazy, rainy Saturday afternoon or pass the time during an insomnia-ridden night, if you have absolutely nothing else to do.

The film follows two couples who get stranded in a creepy house in rural Alabama, and terrorized by a maniac called the Tin Man.  As the film goes on, we learn the dark secrets of the two couples, as the house conjures them up into fruition.  As said before, I never read the novel House is based upon (or am a fan of either author), but apparently from what I've read, the film leaves out a number of plot points that only fans of the novel will pick up in the film.  That being said, the film ends up being confusing, predictable, and hardly scary in the least.  What House has going for it however is the fact that the house itself is creepy and there's plenty of creepy atmosphere to be found as well.  Michael Madsen is here hamming it up, and horror stalwarts Bill Moseley and Leslie Easterbrook are here as well; both of whom ham it up pretty much as well.  All in all, judging by the other reviews here, if you're a fan of the novel by Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti, you'll probably enjoy House in some form, but if you're unfamiliar with the authors or the novel, you'll end up being pretty overly bored with the film.",2,Confusing and hardly scary in the least,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1311,"['Having', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'Ted', 'Dekker', 'Frank', 'Peretti', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'House', 'end', 'result', 'found', 'film', 'ending', 'up', 'being', 'confusing', 'flick', 'film', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'get', 'stranded', 'creepy', 'house', 'rural', 'Alabama', 'terrorized', 'maniac', 'called', 'Tin', 'Man', 'film', 'learn', 'dark', 'secrets', 'two', 'couples', 'house', 'up', 'fruition', 'said', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'House', 'based', 'am', 'fan', 'author', 'apparently', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'film', 'out', 'number', 'plot', 'points', 'only', 'fans', 'novel', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'confusing', 'predictable', 'hardly', 'scary', 'least', 'What', 'House', 'going', 'however', 'fact', 'house', 'creepy', 'plenty', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'be', 'found', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'here', 'hamming', 'up', 'horror', 'stalwarts', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Leslie', 'Easterbrook', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'whom', 'ham', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'well', 'judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', ""'re"", 'fan', 'novel', 'Ted', 'Dekker', 'Frank', 'Peretti', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'House', 'form', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'authors', 'novel', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'overly', 'bored', 'film']",House

In other words, it's a ""Christian movie."" With, I gotta say, a pretty durned weird cast for a ""Christian movie."" But, as is usually the case, I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll just finish off the opening paragraph with a great, great quote from another review, published on 9Nov2008 by a user with the nick m_walker_731: ""The acting was typical Christian-movie acting. There's an old saying in the Christian Film industry. 'We cannot take the able and make them faithful; we must take the faithful, and God will make them able.' This is no exception. "" Oh, that's what I call a quotable review. (I should, since I just quoted it...)Plot: Jack (She Hate Me's Reynaldo Rosales) and Stephanie (Mexican Werewolf in Texas' Heidi Dippold in, as of this writing, her final screen appearance) Singleton are lost on a back road, as is often the case in horror films, on their way to Birmingham, AL. Jack is driving too fast while arguing with Stephanie; we soon find out (this is not a spoiler, it's part of the jacket copy) that their child recently died, and each of them blames the other for her death, leading to a lot of this sort of festering argument. These distractions cause a near-miss accident, the side effects of which leave their car inoperable; they wander off and stumble upon a hotel in the middle of nowhere. When they go in, they find the lights out, but also find Randy Messarue (Curse of the Komodo's J. P. Taylor) and his fiancee Leslie Taylor (Hitch's Julie Ann Emery), the owners of the BMW Jack clipped. The four of them wander around, and finally discover the place's owners (who were down in the basement fixing the fusebox): Betty and Stewart (Leslie Easterbrook and Bill Moseley, both veterans of The Devil's Rejects) and their creepy, possibly mentally challenged son Pete (Lawless' Lou Temple). Everything starts out about as normal as it can be, but the guests soon realize the inhabitants of the house--and possibly the house itself--know more about them than is possible...And thus I find myself back at that quote. Now, if you know me in meatspace (or if you've been following my reviews long enough for the equivalent), this may shock you, but I did the born-again thing for a couple of years back in the mid-eighties, and as a part of that, I saw more than a handful of films from m_walker_731's Christian Film Industry. And I'll tell you what--things are WAY better twenty years and change later than they were back then. In 1985, the idea that someone who'd made a mark in the secular world, like Moseley or Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), would show up in something from the C.F.I. was patently ridiculous. And now, well, here we are. Madsen and Moseley have admittedly small roles, but they're here, and Easterbrook is just as crazy as she was in The Devil's Rejects. I wasn't quite as impressed with our four guests--of them, Rosales turns in the best performance by far, but there's no one terribly embarrassing here; the industry has come a long, long way from Dino DeFilippi's laughable performance in 1970's The Cross and the Switchblade.Speaking specifically as a non-Christian here (but one who, as I mentioned before, gets a kick out of Ted Dekker's novels), I found this to be watchable, if nothing special. Another thing to note about m_walker_731's review is the assertion that this movie will make a great deal more sense to those who've read the novel. There are bits where I did find myself wondering what in the world was going on, but they were brief enough; I usually had my feet pretty firmly enmeshed in the plot. Not something to avoid, but not necessarily something to go out of the way for unless you're a big fan of one of the principals here. ** ",3,The Devil's...

While this is a low-budget movie that doesn't entirely do justice to the book, it does maintain the main storyline and themes of the book (and in fact adds a twist at the end that is an improvement from the book).  ""House"" is different from many horror flicks in that it is not gory; there is violence (and people do die), but the terror in this film lies more on a psychological level.  It is also different from other horror movies in that the characters seem ""real"" and believable (although I may feel this way because I read the book first and felt that I already ""knew"" the characters--if you haven't read the book, you may feel differently).  I felt for the characters and for what was happening to them (and for what had happened to them in their pasts--one of the characters was haunted by memories of being raped by her uncle when she was a child).  Even if you are not interested in the deeper aspects of character development, you should still enjoy the ride that ""House"" takes you on.  Once the terror begins, it is relentless.

I think this is a better description than the current one.A married couple on a road trip take a shortcut onto an isolated dirt road. They run over some debris and wind up with two flat tires. There is another vehicle in a similar state but the riders are gone. It begins to rain so they set out to look for a phone and they come across a place called the Wayside Inn. They enter the inn and meet the couple from the abandoned car. Soon afterward, the owner and her two sons show up. The trio is very creepy and the two couples decide to leave. Just as they open the door a man with a gun (the Tin Man) runs them back into the house where they bolt the door and try to keep him out. They hear something falling down the chimney and find a  tin can with three rules on it. The first rule was more of a statement.1- God came into my house and I killed Him.2- I kill anyone who enters my house.3- If you give me one dead body before sunrise I will spare the rest of you.The couples are judged to be guilty because of a past transgression, giving the others good reason to choose them to kill. As they fight against one another, they are trapped in the maze of the house while the Creepy Threesome and the Tin Man stalk them. (In my opinion, there was no need to have people trying to kill them if the entire premise was built on them choosing someone to kill.) They find a young girl who says she can help but she is not exactly what she seems. From that point on they try to escape the house and their stalkers.1- The movie needs a much more detailed description for a person to even decide whether or not they want to buy/ view it. I had to go to another site to get more information. But I don't know if this is the fault of the movie or Amazon.2- There is a twist that I thought was really clever but apparently some viewers just didn't get it. But I believe if people understood the twist they would have enjoyed it instead of being left frustrated and confused.3- The acting was so- so but better than I expected for low budget. The plot had some unnecessary parts that served to add to the confusion. The one CGI scene was HORRIBLY unrealistic. What's worse is it was entirely unnecessary. Changing one line in the script would have worked just as well without needing the computer graphics. Better no CGI than bad CGI.I am judging this leniently because for a low budget film it was great. I can only imagine what would have been made if there had been a bigger budget and paring down of the script.",4,Surprisingly good for a low budget movie,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2576,"['hard', 'review', 'movie', 'revealing', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'try', 'think', 'better', 'description', 'current', 'one.A', 'married', 'couple', 'road', 'trip', 'take', 'shortcut', 'isolated', 'dirt', 'road', 'run', 'debris', 'wind', 'up', 'two', 'flat', 'tires', 'vehicle', 'similar', 'state', 'riders', 'are', 'gone', 'rain', 'so', 'set', 'out', 'look', 'phone', 'come', 'place', 'called', 'Wayside', 'Inn', 'enter', 'inn', 'meet', 'couple', 'abandoned', 'car', 'Soon', 'afterward', 'owner', 'two', 'sons', 'show', 'up', 'trio', 'very', 'creepy', 'two', 'couples', 'decide', 'leave', 'Just', 'open', 'door', 'man', 'gun', 'Tin', 'Man', 'back', 'house', 'where', 'bolt', 'door', 'try', 'keep', 'out', 'hear', 'something', 'falling', 'down', 'chimney', 'find', 'tin', 'can', 'three', 'rules', 'first', 'rule', 'was', 'more', 'statement.1-', 'God', 'came', 'house', 'killed', 'Him.2-', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'house.3-', 'give', 'one', 'dead', 'body', 'sunrise', 'will', 'spare', 'rest', 'you.The', 'couples', 'are', 'judged', 'be', 'guilty', 'past', 'transgression', 'giving', 'others', 'good', 'reason', 'choose', 'kill', 'fight', 'one', 'are', 'trapped', 'maze', 'house', 'Creepy', 'Threesome', 'Tin', 'Man', 'stalk', 'opinion', 'was', 'need', 'have', 'people', 'trying', 'kill', 'entire', 'premise', 'was', 'built', 'choosing', 'someone', 'kill', 'find', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'point', 'try', 'escape', 'house', 'stalkers.1-', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'description', 'person', 'even', 'decide', 'not', 'want', 'buy/', 'view', 'had', 'go', 'site', 'get', 'more', 'information', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fault', 'movie', 'Amazon.2-', 'twist', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'clever', 'apparently', 'viewers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'believe', 'people', 'understood', 'twist', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'instead', 'being', 'left', 'frustrated', 'confused.3-', 'acting', 'was', 'so-', 'so', 'better', 'expected', 'low', 'budget', 'plot', 'had', 'unnecessary', 'parts', 'served', 'add', 'confusion', 'one', 'CGI', 'scene', 'was', 'HORRIBLY', 'unrealistic', 'What', 'worse', 'was', 'entirely', 'unnecessary', 'Changing', 'one', 'line', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'needing', 'computer', 'graphics', 'Better', 'CGI', 'bad', 'CGI.I', 'am', 'judging', 'leniently', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'had', 'been', 'bigger', 'budget', 'paring', 'down', 'script']",House

The book is awesome. After I read it, I couldn't stop reading. It was that good. It made me go back to reading again. When I saw the movie, I was totally disappointed to see how they exclude some of the most crucial events. I've got to say, the beginning is ok, but the end is absolutely horrible. It does not follow the events in the book. The director forgets a lot about detail. For example, in the scene where White kills the little girl, there are supposed to be a lot of clones. Instead, we see White by himself in an attempt to recreate something in the lamest way possible. I mean, this is ridiculous. It is beyond me how they got the OK to release this movie in the first place. This movie is bad acting all the way. They did a really poor mediocre job in recreating the book itself.

It seems that people are divided over this thing - those who read the book, and those who like horror movies.  Those who read the book have positive things to say about the symbolism, and good versus evil, and other stuff.  If you don't feel like your time was wasted, then good for you.On the other hand, if you like horror movies, then this is an egregious waste of time.  Michael Madsen scarily glares in a few scenes, and there are some annoying characters who should have delivered their lines whilst holding chainsaws, but alas, they didn't, and you suffer for it.  There are things painted on the walls and the obligatory horror-movie dinner table scene, and an ending that made me point to the television and inform the Significant Other that the movie was at least attempting a meaningful moment (that has been done before in a dozen better movies), but I still cannot recommend this steaming pile to anyone I remotely care for, or even strangers, for that matter.On a slightly positive note, that house was freaking scary-looking.  There exists a common thread between you five-star raters and all of us ""House""-haters, and that is the Horror Movie as a Morality Play.  Horror movies are there to warn you of what will happen if you pick up that chainsaw-wielding maniac on the side of the road, have sex in the dark woods, or check into creepy-looking hotels run by drooling inbreds.  So, you've been warned.  Don't wander into scary-looking houses just because it's raining and you're an idiot.  There.  You've learned the lesson you need to know, so don't bother watching this movie.",1,Hey - It's Not a Remake!,1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,1714,"['anticipated', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'remake', 'William', 'Katt', 'movie', 'House', 'was', 'wrong', 'people', 'are', 'divided', 'thing', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'who', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'symbolism', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'other', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'time', 'was', 'wasted', 'then', 'good', 'you.On', 'other', 'hand', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'then', 'egregious', 'waste', 'time', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'scarily', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'annoying', 'characters', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'delivered', 'lines', 'holding', 'chainsaws', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'are', 'things', 'painted', 'walls', 'obligatory', 'horror-movie', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'ending', 'made', 'point', 'television', 'inform', 'Significant', 'Other', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'attempting', 'meaningful', 'moment', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'dozen', 'better', 'movies', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'steaming', 'pile', 'anyone', 'remotely', 'care', 'even', 'strangers', 'slightly', 'positive', 'note', 'house', 'was', 'freaking', 'scary-looking', 'common', 'thread', 'five-star', 'raters', 'House', '-haters', 'Horror', 'Movie', 'Morality', 'Play', 'Horror', 'movies', 'are', 'there', 'warn', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'pick', 'up', 'chainsaw-wielding', 'maniac', 'side', 'road', 'have', 'sex', 'dark', 'woods', 'check', 'creepy-looking', 'hotels', 'run', 'drooling', 'inbreds', 'So', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wander', 'scary-looking', 'houses', 'just', 'raining', ""'re"", 'idiot', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lesson', 'need', 'know', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'movie']",House
