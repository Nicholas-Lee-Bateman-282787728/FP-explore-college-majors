102758,A3UXQACZN77A7I,0790734524,"A. J Sereda ""Andy""","[4, 4]","This was one of those movies that I never intended to see as a kid.  I was 13 at the time, and had seen the preview at the theater before watching Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I thought, ""what a cheesy looking flick"" and went about watching Pee Wee (ha ha, that's painting the kettle purple, or whatever they say). But what 80's flick was 'top of the line' besides Fast Times at Ridgmont High or Ghandi?  Maybe ET, or Empire Strikes Back. OK, sorry about that, back to AF.Anyways, being an HBO family, I got the opportunity to watch this movie, a several hundred times.  What can I say.  It's still cheesy, but brings about a family bonding. And honestly, there are families out there like this dysfunctional one.  In fact, some are worse than the Sommers.The movie brought into play the Soviet Boycott, a vegan follower resorting back to McD's, things going on with our nation. David and Marcus Sommers, racing for the last time against each other.....well, for the first also. And I'll never view the National Anthem the same after seeing Alexandra Paul getting naked for the romp with David.  Totally unacceptable, yet so taboo and intriguing.The soundtrack, unfortunately, is next to impossible to find.  I have been looking for years, to no avail.  So, I have to keep watching (which I will) the movie over and over.",4,Brings back the memories,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1317,"['was', 'one', 'movies', 'never', 'intended', 'see', 'kid', 'was', '13', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'preview', 'theater', 'watching', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'thought', 'what', 'cheesy', 'looking', 'flick', 'went', 'watching', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'ha', 'ha', 'painting', 'kettle', 'purple', 'say', 'what', '80', 'flick', 'was', ""'top"", 'line', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgmont', 'High', 'Ghandi', 'Maybe', 'ET', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'OK', 'sorry', 'back', 'AF.Anyways', 'being', 'HBO', 'family', 'got', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'hundred', 'times', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'still', 'cheesy', 'family', 'bonding', 'honestly', 'are', 'families', 'there', 'dysfunctional', 'one', 'fact', 'are', 'worse', 'Sommers.The', 'movie', 'brought', 'play', 'Soviet', 'Boycott', 'vegan', 'follower', 'resorting', 'back', 'McD', 'things', 'going', 'nation', 'David', 'Marcus', 'Sommers', 'racing', 'last', 'time', 'other', '..well', 'first', 'also', ""'ll"", 'never', 'view', 'National', 'Anthem', 'same', 'seeing', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'getting', 'naked', 'romp', 'David', 'Totally', 'unacceptable', 'yet', 'so', 'taboo', 'intriguing.The', 'soundtrack', 'unfortunately', 'next', 'impossible', 'find', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'years', 'avail', 'So', 'have', 'keep', 'watching', 'will', 'movie']",N/A

Also some stereotypical characters but if you are a cyclist and in the mood there are not too many cycling movies to choose from.  So I would recommend it to those interested in that.  Of course it is a story of two brothers dealing with personal and relational issues with a bit of romance thrown in. The cycling footage in Colorado is good.  Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner everyone else performs admirably although the script is a bit wooden and contrived in places.

I think this time, I was able to grasp American Flyers in a better light and see the film a little bit differently. Yeah, it's true that American Flyers suffers from moments of extreme silliness and can be thought of as a bad Mentos commercial. What I liked about the movie is the story and the bike scenes. Actually, I am a sucker for bicycle films, and American Flyers is no exception. I liked the scenes during the Hell of the West race, and I thought they were dramatic in a good way (except for the unrealistic shouldering between Muzzin and Sommers in the final part of the third stage). I get enough adrenaline rush of them. Kevin Costner sported a rare but sexy mustache for his character and plays his part well. John Badham did a nice job in playing the card of the true identified victim of brain aneurysm during American Flyers, and that made the film compelling in some ways. I was impressed with Rae Dawn Chong the way she changed the flat tire during the race; that was professional. It was nice to see Eddy Merckx in the film as many people do not realize that he is the Michael Jordan of cycling. When I saw the bike crashes during the races, they looked extremely real and not staged. The idea of a couple of cyclists stopping at McDonald's is unrealistic as far as dietary requirements of a trained athlete go. Speaking of McDonald's, it was almost constantly popped up during American Flyers. The cinematography, especially of Colorado, is a nice touch, and the thought of the cyclists riding over the road in high altitude while there is a good altitude difference on the sides is mind-blowing. All in all, American Flyers has its share of ups and downs but remains a satisfying, enjoyable experience since the positives outweighed the negatives.",4,An Awesome Bicycling Picture.

Each an elite athlete in their spare time they take on the pros and some old ghosts as they grind their gears up and down America's Rocky mountains trying to break away from their past.Ahh, the training montages, the epic record breaking scene of the unknown talent. The competition, the trials, the pain, taking it to the limit! All the great ingredients of your favorite sport porn, only with bikes. Sport porn is all too common, but to see a sport porn about bikes is so unusual it deserves a little leeway, at least if you like bikes and want to see the sport taken seriously enough for someone to make a sport porn about it. (Yes, I know, steroids, etc. I hate it, too. But did America stop watching Baseball or Football even though we all know they are Roided up all over the place? See, you're actually OK with drug use and people lying about it, you just can't get into pro cycling yet, and that's OK.)This movie plays with plot and facts fast and loose, but it is just so darn 80's it's hard to stay mad at it. The frenemy, the old grudge, the love triangle. It's all there! It's the same story arc as the Karate Kid, but this time the Kid has a brother and one of them might be sick.
