(Odd marriages, I see.) Earlier, we see another couple on a hike, and after the husband is killed, the wife is chased around for a bit and killed off as well. (Evidently, someone's out there, killing--as if we didn't figure that out already). Anyhow, the couples plan to meet up that night after the hike starts. But, as figured, someone is out there. Sharon and Teddie, the wives, are plagued by specters of some sort, until Teddie is killed, and Sharon is sent running. Then the husbands (whose names I forgot) meet up with someone in a cave, hoping to escape the rain, and they are offered some meat cooking over the fire. (Take a wild guess at what--or rather, who--it is) The man tells them a story about himself and his wife, and their children (which pretty much explains the ghosts) and soon the men are plagued by terror. Things go on as expected from there, as Sharon fights to survive in the woods, and the evil surviving man searches for her and Teddie, until the it's-been-done-before climax.Not a terrible movie. The music is absolutely awful, and the acting is nothing to rave about, but it's still an okay film. A couple of good chase scenes, but the first one of the evil surviving man going after Sharon after he kills Teddie was just too dark. I couldn't see a thing. Now, maybe it was my TV but I don't know, it was still pretty dark. I preferred the day scenes. There were a couple of mild scares, but in the end, this is just another dull slasher with a few new twists. But, if you find it anywhere, check it out. It's barely entertaining, at best.Don't Go in the Woods (1981)As you may have read, a maniac is killing anonymous campers in the woods- hence the cautionary title of the movie. Most of the acting is horrid, usually providing chuckles. The music alters between generic upbeat country guitar and cheap early-eighties casio keyboard.If you like bad movies, I highly recommend this one.",3,Terror in the Forest,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,2039,"['Forest', '1982', 'Two', 'couples', 'are', 'planning', 'camping', 'trips', 'wives', 'planning', 'one', 'together', 'husbands', 'one', 'together', 'Odd', 'see', 'Earlier', 'see', 'couple', 'hike', 'husband', 'killed', 'wife', 'chased', 'bit', 'killed', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'Evidently', 'someone', 'there', 'killing', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'already', 'Anyhow', 'couples', 'plan', 'meet', 'up', 'night', 'hike', 'figured', 'someone', 'out', 'there', 'Sharon', 'Teddie', 'wives', 'are', 'plagued', 'specters', 'sort', 'Teddie', 'killed', 'Sharon', 'sent', 'running', 'Then', 'husbands', 'names', 'forgot', 'meet', 'up', 'someone', 'cave', 'hoping', 'escape', 'rain', 'are', 'offered', 'meat', 'cooking', 'fire', 'Take', 'wild', 'guess', 'what', 'rather', 'who', 'man', 'story', 'wife', 'children', 'pretty', 'much', 'ghosts', 'soon', 'men', 'are', 'plagued', 'terror', 'Things', 'go', 'expected', 'there', 'Sharon', 'fights', 'survive', 'woods', 'evil', 'surviving', 'man', 'Teddie', ""it's-been-done-before"", 'climax.Not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'music', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'acting', 'nothing', 'rave', 'about', 'still', 'okay', 'film', 'couple', 'good', 'chase', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'evil', 'surviving', 'man', 'going', 'Sharon', 'Teddie', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'dark', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'thing', 'Now', 'maybe', 'was', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'dark', 'preferred', 'day', 'scenes', 'were', 'couple', 'mild', 'scares', 'end', 'just', 'dull', 'slasher', 'few', 'new', 'twists', 'find', 'anywhere', 'check', 'out', 'barely', 'entertaining', 'best.Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', '1981', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'maniac', 'killing', 'anonymous', 'campers', 'woods-', 'hence', 'cautionary', 'title', 'movie', 'Most', 'acting', 'horrid', 'usually', 'providing', 'chuckles', 'music', 'alters', 'generic', 'upbeat', 'country', 'guitar', 'cheap', 'early-eighties', 'casio', 'keyboard.If', 'bad', 'movies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A

1242545,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B001UW59OO,Grindhouse and Horror,"[1, 2]","The 80s churned out plenty of slashers, and both of these flicks are among the lesser known entries.  DON'T GO IN THE WOODS is the gorier out of the two, but I thought THE FOREST was the better film.  DON'T GO IN THE WOODS is about some hairy savage that slaughters anyone who goes in the woods.  Who he is or where he came from is never explained.  The film has basically no plot, and some will either find it boring or they'll like it for the high body count and gore. The locations are nice, but the directing is mediocre and there's no nudity.  THE FOREST is better acted, directed, and it also has a better but very simple story; but unlike the other film, the gore and body count in this flick is low. This film uses its good locations to its advantage, but it has has no nudity. Just like DON""T GO IN THE WOODS, it's also a very 80s type of film and therefore won't appeal to many mainstream audiences. It's cheap and simply made but for some reason I watch it quite a bit. It also begins with some corny childish type music that makes it look like you're going to be watching a Walt Disney film. While it doesn't show any graphic cannibalism, this easy to follow flick about a forest with a couple of ghost children and their still alive cannibal father makes up for its shortcomings with its scenery. Low-budget with a small cast and nothing elaborate in the film, its audience will be limited. These films may not appeal to a lot of people because you may need an acquired taste to enjoy them, but I like them a lot because I've always been a fan of 80s horror. It might be a good idea to check out both of them on YOUTUBE, but THE FOREST is one of those films that I think plays a lot better when you're watching it at night in the best quality that's available on a big screen.The DVD quality on both is very good, but Code Red has released other films with better transfers.",4,For 80s slasher fans,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,1887,"['80s', 'churned', 'out', 'plenty', 'slashers', 'flicks', 'are', 'lesser', 'known', 'entries', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'GO', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'gorier', 'two', 'thought', 'THE', 'FOREST', 'was', 'better', 'film', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'GO', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'hairy', 'savage', 'slaughters', 'anyone', 'who', 'woods', 'Who', 'where', 'came', 'never', 'explained', 'film', 'basically', 'plot', 'will', 'find', 'boring', ""'ll"", 'like', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'gore', 'locations', 'are', 'nice', 'directing', 'mediocre', 'nudity', 'FOREST', 'better', 'acted', 'directed', 'also', 'better', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'other', 'film', 'gore', 'body', 'count', 'flick', 'low', 'film', 'good', 'locations', 'advantage', 'nudity', 'Just', 'DON', 'T', 'GO', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'also', 'very', '80s', 'type', 'film', 'therefore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'many', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'cheap', 'simply', 'made', 'reason', 'watch', 'quite', 'bit', 'also', 'corny', 'childish', 'type', 'music', 'look', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', ""n't"", 'show', 'graphic', 'cannibalism', 'easy', 'follow', 'flick', 'forest', 'couple', 'ghost', 'children', 'still', 'alive', 'cannibal', 'father', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'scenery', 'Low-budget', 'small', 'cast', 'nothing', 'elaborate', 'film', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'limited', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'need', 'acquired', 'taste', 'enjoy', 'like', 'lot', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', '80s', 'horror', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'check', 'out', 'YOUTUBE', 'THE', 'FOREST', 'one', 'films', 'think', 'lot', 'better', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'night', 'best', 'quality', 'available', 'big', 'screen.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'Code', 'Red', 'released', 'other', 'films', 'better', 'transfers']",N/A
