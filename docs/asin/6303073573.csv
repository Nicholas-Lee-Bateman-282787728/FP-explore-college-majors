354690,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303073573,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[16, 20]","A real-life story about the discovery and destructive nature of AIDS, And the Band Played On is a gripping drama that not only takes you to the front line and behind the scenes of the HIV virus. To the bath houses in San Francisco to the research labs at the Center for Disease Control, there is no area that is not shown in this film. An all-star cast also creates the ambiance to this film. Powerful actors giving the performances of a lifetime. Richard Gere, Angelica Houston, Ian McKellan, Steve Martin, Alan Alda, Phil Collins, and even Matthew Modine are just a few of the actors who deserved Academy Awards for their work. While most of their parts were small, they were not unforgettable segments. Each cameo actor had a crucial role in leading us to the next segment and life of the HIV virus.We are first introduced to Modine when he is trying to help a tribe with the destructible Ebola virus. Then, just as quickly, we are in mainstream San Francisco. The booming gay community and the political figureheads that were pushing for rights. It is the beginning of 1980, the Democrats are pushing for a more liberal stance, while Regan is being sworn into the White House for his first term. The world is happy, yet timid. The gay community is growing, and discovering that a dark fear is lurking behind them. While the United States is beating a dead horse about closing bath houses and stopping the gay community, the French are looking at it outside of a sexual disease. Possibly a blood disease. While they research their ideas, America begins to see the full effect of AIDS.  These scientists are predicting that in the next several years the fatality rate will be 100% if you contract AIDS.  Ronald Regan has just had his second term and has still not mentioned AIDS in public. While the French work day and night to stop their public from dying, we begin shunning the gay community. Creating a phobia due to lack of education. We even see a well respected doctor steal the discovery from the French just so that he can credit the monetary value of this disease. While the ending to this film is very sappy, it still was powerful enough to not only be enjoyable, but also educational.  A film that if you have not seen yet, you should...and if you have seen it, see it again.This powerful two and a half hour epic was the most entertaining informative film I have seen in ages. I rented it not knowing anything about it.  I first picked it up for the actors to see what they could do in such small roles. Little did I know I was about to see everyone in the performances of their lifetime. Richard Gere proved once and again why he is an actor. It befuddles me why Modine has stopped working, because after seeing him in this film I would have liked to see him move further in the Hollywood community.It is not everyday that you find a gem as this film. If I was a superintendent of schools and I just saw this film, I would push with every ounce of strength to get this film into my schools. I learned more about AIDS than I ever had in my education career. It not only brought out a text book style of education, but it also brought a very humanistic approach to the disease. It also brought out a very dark political side that perhaps the general public is not as familiar with.  Not only that, but it also brought out the dark side of human nature.  In times of plagues, we rely to heavily on science to be our savior.  While it will be the backbone to our cause, we do need to have a feeling for those that already have the disease.  We, as a nation, need to look past social standings, sexual preference, and color of our skin to realize that we are all humans.  If this is a ""human"" disease, then we need to research every venue, not just the most obvious ones.  If this film doesn't scare you, I don't think any horror film will.Like all great films, it did have some horrible sides to it. McKellan's story was too clich&eacute;.  The story of the homosexual politician who looses his lover because he is more involved with politics than his social life, who eventually reunite when it is discovered that McKellan has AIDS.  Modine's flashbacks were unnecessary.  I felt that we did not need to be reminded why he believed in human nature, and I don't think that we needed to be reminded by seeing a scene where he throws bodies into a fire.  Something more substantial would have been nice.  Finally, the ending was too much for me. I don't think it needed to have an Elton John (prominent homosexual figure in entertainment) singing one of his songs with flashing pictures of famous people, straight and gay, that we have lost to AIDS.  Perhaps a more poignant picture would have been less famous people (every day Joes) who have died from the disease.Overall, the good well out weigh the bad points that I just mentioned. I guarantee that you will be surprised, educated, and emotionally enthralled by this film.Grade:  **** out of *****",4,This is not a gay issue.

Wow is not enough. I am young enough that I do not remember any of the development of HIV and AIDS. I would have been a toddler when all of the controversy emerged. This film exposes many facets of the AIDS community and those who were advocates for understanding of the disease. What is showcased is the all out war that erupted between scientists, doctors, patients, media, and communities on how to handle the issue of an emerging and wildly misunderstood and infectious disease. This film spoke volumes to me. I have long been an advocate for equality and gay rights. This opened a window to a time when equality was unheard of. Much the same as watching something from the segregation era. Times have changed, and for that I am grateful. This illustrates exactly that. If you ever find yourself, or someone you know wondering about the emergence of HIV or AIDS, watch this. This will clearly demonstrate how things evolved into what they are today. It talks a great deal about the steps taken to find a suitable test for HIV and the steps towards immunosuppressive drugs.

354693,A13NM1PES9OXVN,6303073573,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[5, 5]","This is an unforgettable film, an intelligent and suspenseful story with fantastic ensemble acting, and that shows how a lot of little mistakes, and big egos, bigger ignorance, and lots of bureaucrats, can lead to massive loss of life. And did so here so tragically in the AIDS crisis, in which a small group of scientists and doctors struggled to contain a terrifying new virus in the 1980s.The fact that the disease was still 'trackable' when it was pinpointed -- as illustrated in this film -- it breaks my heart. I could not have imagined a movie of the book when I read it, but this film has a pulse-pounding and truly suspenseful story as one small team races to contain the spread of the disease, while (heartbreakingly) watching so many lives fall with staggering quickness before the disease. We meet many of these victims briefly, yet they are interesting and instantly memorable people, and it hurts to lose them.  We also see how these stunning losses inexorably begin to affect those on the team (there's an especially lovely scene between Glenn Headley and Richard Gere that goes from being charming and slightly flirtatious, to quietly devastating in just a minute or two). Gere is very good here (in a character inspired by ""A Chorus Line"" creator Michael Bennett).So many of the facts presented here are hard to believe just a few decades later -- the victims who continued to infect others simply because they could not face their own mortality -- the refusals to close the bathhouses -- the refusals of blood banks to start a screening process that would have protected hemophiliacs from receiving at least 75% of infected blood (because of the expense -- sigh) -- the fact that too few people in government cared (or would even mention the word AIDS) simply because it involved gay men.Matthew Modine is excellent as the passionate doctor intent on finding a cure, and the superb cast also includes such wonderful actors as Anjelica Huston, Steve Martin, Patrick Bauchau, Richard Masur, David Dukes, Glenn Headley, Alan Alda (a wonderful and chilling, stupidly egotistical villain), Swoosie Kurtz, Richard Gere, Donal Logue, and many more. I love all the performances here, and the final montage is stunning. I can't imagine anyone not being moved by all those vibrant images of people who are no longer with us.It's a movie that is surprisingly suspenseful and exciting, and which stays with you for a long time.  My favorite line in the film occurs in a quiet scene near the end of the story, in a coffee shop where Matthew Modine breaks down for the first time, in frustration, anger, and sadness, only to be consoled, with surprising kindness, by the boss he fought against for so long:  ""Sometimes I look at you, in awe and wonder, too.""",5,"A Surprising, Sensitive, and Engrossing Thriller About the AIDS Crisis",1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2762,"['unforgettable', 'film', 'intelligent', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'how', 'lot', 'little', 'mistakes', 'big', 'egos', 'bigger', 'ignorance', 'lots', 'bureaucrats', 'can', 'lead', 'massive', 'loss', 'life', 'did', 'so', 'here', 'so', 'tragically', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'small', 'group', 'scientists', 'doctors', 'struggled', 'contain', 'terrifying', 'new', 'virus', '1980s.The', 'fact', 'disease', 'was', 'still', ""'trackable"", 'when', 'was', 'pinpointed', 'illustrated', 'film', 'heart', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'movie', 'book', 'when', 'read', 'film', 'pulse-pounding', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'one', 'small', 'team', 'races', 'contain', 'spread', 'disease', 'heartbreakingly', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'fall', 'staggering', 'quickness', 'disease', 'meet', 'many', 'victims', 'briefly', 'yet', 'are', 'interesting', 'instantly', 'memorable', 'people', 'lose', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'stunning', 'losses', 'inexorably', 'begin', 'affect', 'team', 'especially', 'lovely', 'scene', 'Glenn', 'Headley', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'being', 'charming', 'slightly', 'flirtatious', 'quietly', 'devastating', 'just', 'minute', 'two', 'Gere', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'character', 'inspired', 'A', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'creator', 'Michael', 'Bennett', '.So', 'many', 'facts', 'presented', 'here', 'are', 'hard', 'believe', 'just', 'few', 'decades', 'later', 'victims', 'who', 'continued', 'infect', 'others', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'face', 'own', 'mortality', 'refusals', 'close', 'bathhouses', 'refusals', 'blood', 'banks', 'start', 'screening', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'protected', 'hemophiliacs', 'receiving', 'least', '75', '%', 'infected', 'blood', 'expense', 'sigh', 'fact', 'too', 'few', 'people', 'government', 'cared', 'would', 'even', 'mention', 'word', 'AIDS', 'simply', 'involved', 'gay', 'men.Matthew', 'Modine', 'excellent', 'passionate', 'doctor', 'intent', 'finding', 'cure', 'superb', 'cast', 'also', 'such', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Patrick', 'Bauchau', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'David', 'Dukes', 'Glenn', 'Headley', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'wonderful', 'chilling', 'stupidly', 'egotistical', 'villain', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'many', 'more', 'love', 'performances', 'here', 'final', 'montage', 'stunning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'being', 'moved', 'vibrant', 'images', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'us.It', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'long', 'time', 'favorite', 'line', 'film', 'quiet', 'scene', 'end', 'story', 'coffee', 'shop', 'where', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'down', 'first', 'time', 'frustration', 'anger', 'sadness', 'only', 'be', 'consoled', 'surprising', 'kindness', 'boss', 'fought', 'so', 'long', 'Sometimes', 'look', 'awe', 'wonder', 'too']",N/A

Simply put, this is great drama. The patronizing statements about made-for-tv movies don't apply here. The drama, sadly, comes from the real events that are depicted--the collective denial about the reality of AIDS as that disease first began appearing in the gay and Haitian communities, the government's (read ""Ronald Reagan's"") persistent indifference, the professional jealousy within the medical communities vying to be the first to identify the agent (the virus) that causes AIDS, and how human beings resist having their preconceived notions about life challenged (as when a group of gay activists insists on keeping gay bath houses open even as it became apparent that AIDS was spread through sexual contact). This movie really took me back twenty years to when I first read a short article buried somewhere in the middle of the New York Times about a gay-related cancer little realizing how much my life would change from that point onward.The performances across the board are great.

354707,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6303073573,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[6, 7]","In the midst of the growing crisis of the AIDS epidemic, one journalist who witnessed the development and destruction wrought by this disease firsthand put together a regular series of columns chronicling what he felt was important for history not to forget. Appearing locally in San Francisco (perhaps ground zero for the epidemic, or certainly one of the first major sites to suffer) and then nationally in the likes of `Rolling Stone', Randy Shilts' commentary grew into the text `And the Band Played On', which follows the history of the AIDS crisis from many perspectives.In reducing this massive tome to a reasonable-length feature, HBO pictures and Aaron Spelling (yes, Spelling, best known for Beverly Hills: 90210 and the like) had to devise a way of making it interesting and compelling for the small screen (this was a made-for-television film). They opted to follow the career of Dr. Don Francis, an epidemiologist with the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, and his team as they fought to uncover the mystery of the disease, and then had to fight to get public and official recognition of the problem.Played by Matthew Modine, Francis gives a real sense of the frustration and confusion that faced the medical establishment in the early days of the disease. Coming at the time of a great conservative political revival on both sides of the Atlantic, a disease that seemed to affect undesirables, moral degenerates particularly (or so the popular sentiment ran), was unlikely to get any public assistance. Ian McKellan (who had yet to come out publicly as a gay man) played the political activist Bill Krause, who realised that he was fighting a difficult uphill battle during the Reagan era, when even his own Democratic party didn't want to embrace the gay community.Perhaps the most interesting portrayal in the production is that of Alan Alda, who plays the enigmatic and controversial figure of Dr. Robert Gallo, discoverer of the first human retro-virus (which had, at that time, no disease to attach to it). Gallo's back-and-forth ego battles with the French researchers at the Pasteur Institute and with the CDC (and Dr. Francis in particular) may have caused delays and difficulties in finding adequate ways of identifying infections and virus-positive persons. The book goes into much more detail than the film about the 'which-virus-is-it?' controversy (HIV was not the first virus to which AIDS was attached). Gallo took exception to the way he was portrayed in the original film; in the updated video release there is addenda that addresses some of the issues.The chilling decisions of hospital boards and from the troubled gay community, making decisions unwise in retrospect (and perhaps known to be unwise if politically untenable at the time) lend an air of concern about the way in which disease in general is handled in modern society. The ideal of public health concern is shown to be largely at the mercy of business and political decisions. The equally-chilling realisation that this was a disease with a potentially 100% mortality rate is an important aspect.It almost falls into the realm of dark humour that, once there were laboratory allocations and some small budgetary allowance that it was thought that this disease would be identified, contained, and possibly cured within a matter of a few years, if not months. Now entering the third decade of the epidemic, one wonders at the misplaced optimism, and worries about what other, worse diseases are lurking around the world.This made-for-television film is remarkable because of the number of big names that turned out for relatively small parts - Lily Tomlin, Phil Collins, Richard Gere, Steve Martin - many actors and actresses lent their support to this project as a public service, accepting only minimum union fees if any payment at all. The premiere was in Washington, D.C. before an audience which included members of Congress and government and industry leaders.The film ends with a montage of video clips and stills of prominent people who had died of AIDS - the number of people is staggering, made apparent by the modern phenomenon of the AID quilt, a grass-roots project designed to keep the memories of each victim alive. This is the Butcher's Bill, a term coined by Nelson as he fought Napoleon, who asked what the daily death toll was. HBO films also produced an Academy Award winning documentary, `Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt', which I highly recommend as a supplement to this film.While AIDS is no longer the automatic, immediate death sentence it once was, it is still a serious disease that has a high mortality rate, and is enormously expensive to treat and combat. But, the medical community is beginning to learn something.  I hope you will take the time to listen to the story, which is an important one, put in compelling format.",5,A sorrowful tune,1055289600,"06 11, 2003",2003,4867,"['midst', 'growing', 'crisis',

The response from the government was to ignore it, the response from the primary community it attacked was denial, and the response from the doctors was puzzlement and wonder. This mix led to the deaths of thousands, and eventually millions of people, who were unwittingly victims in this plague that still sweeps the world. ""And the Band Played On"" marks the early struggles in this monumental epic, and the politics that all too effectively wiped out these victims.Matthew Modine plays Dr. Don Francis, a virologist who's passion is science and is one of the foremost researchers for AIDS.

Because the population it attacked was gay, the Reagan adminstration turned a blind eye to the disease, not wanting to offend it's conservative religious core. And the Band Played On, and more and more people began to die.Then toss into this mix a gay community recently empowered, afraid of the disease and yet afraid this was another attempt to subvert them. Led by Ian McKellan as Bill Kraus, who struggled against his own community to get them to stop spreading the disease. Yet they turned a blind eye, left the bathhouse open (which were a breeding ground for AIDS), And The Band Played On, and more and more people died.And then toss into this mix a doctor bent on restoring his shattered reputation and his shattered ego by arguing with the French about discovering this retrovirus. Dr. Gallo, brilliantly played by Alan Alda, put his own needs above those affected from this disease, looking for fame and glory, And the Band Played On.Taking Randy Shilts' groundbreaking and revolutionary book into a movie format was a challenging and daunting task. The book is thick with characters and politics, and the movie successfully touches on all major areas in the book. However, to get the most complete story, check out the originial source material. The book is still a compelling read so many years later, and if this book doesn't get you outraged, nothing will.The film ends with an incredible touching tribute to those we lost from AIDS, from the littlest babies to the greatest celebrities, over the haunting song of Elton John's ""The Last Song"". The end result  was our loss of Ryan White ... Rock Hudson ... Bill Kraus ... Amanda Blake ...  unspoken millions ...

No reasonable cause of death could be found.  By 1980, gay men in the United States started dying of pneumonia and skin cancer, and a trend started to emerge.  No one wanted to fund research to save a few gay bathhouse patrons, and the CDC was forced to investigate the disease with a skeleton crew, minimal funding, and quietly.  Their hard work uncovered the possibility that this was a sexually transmitted disease, but no one wanted to close the bathhouses.  They discovered it was transmitted through the blood supply as well, but no one wanted to spend the money to screen blood.  Ronald Reagan was still refusing to acknowledge the disease publicly, and no one wanted to believe that AIDS was a problem.  It wasn't until women and children started dying that the public finally started to take notice, and notice they did.  Less than 10 years after the first cases were isolated in the United States, over a million would be afflicted with the disease.This is the story of those first years, from the first stunning revelation that there was a common link to those early cases to the isolation of the virus and the development of a screening test for it.  It's about the politicians that didn't want to risk political suicide by getting involved with a ""gay"" disease, about the doctors and health professionals who worked night and day for years to find the cause, and most importantly it's about the people who's lives were cut short by this killer.What might sound dry and plotless in print is actually an engrossing, fascinating, emotional movie.  The entire story moves along well, and never seems to drag too long at any point.  What could have been a confusing film is made very easy for the layperson to understand.  It doesn't pull any punches, and few people will walk away without feeling some sense of rage at how many lives were needlessly taken away in their prime because of ignorance, red tape, prejudice and money.The cast in this movie is out of this world, and there's not a single weak performance in the bunch.  It's one of those movies where, each time a new character comes onscreen, you say ""Hey, that's so-and-so!"".  Matthew Modine plays a CDC doctor who wears his heart on his sleeve, part of the CDC team that searched inexhaustibly for the contagious factor in AIDS, or as it was called at the time, GRID (Gay Related Immune Deficiency).  Other members of the team include Richard Masur and Glenne Headley, who spend their own money to fly all over the country, interviewing victims and trying to trace the causes of the disease.  Sir Ian McKellan gives an expectedly stirring performance, as a gay man who spends years battling beaurocratic red tape to get politicians to fund AIDS research, only to find out that he himself has the disease.  B.D. Wong is great as his long-time companion and best friend.  Lily Tomlin is one of the highlights of the movie, as a back-breaking, shut-up-and-get-it-done-now type.  Steve Martin gives one of his stronger performances as the brother of a high-society closet homosexual.  Richard Gere, who is sort of hit-and-miss in his movie roles, is moving and believeable as a Broadway choreographer afflicted with AIDS.  Alan Alda is an absolute treat, playing the self-important Dr. Callo, the American doctor who tried to claim sole discovery of the virus that causes AIDS as well as the test to detect it.  Part of the movie revolves around his refusal to acknowledge or work with the French scientists who truly did discover the virus, and the urge to run up to the TV and slap Alan Alda is almost irresistable!  There are at least 20 more actors and actresses in this movie that you'll recognize instantly, it's that great of a cast.I can't say enough about this DVD!  I originally saw it back in the 90s, when it first aired on HBO, and it stuck with me through all of these years.  I finally found it here on Amazon on DVD, and just watched it:  I was afraid that I might have been remembering it as better than it was, but it didn't disappoint me in the least!

The story evokes a myriad of emotions in you in the way that the plot is developed and how the actors bring it to life.This is also a story of how our govenment and other high scale institutions decided to avoid what they believed to be &quot;a sensitive issue&quot; that did not deserve the importance it actually needed. The bureaucracy, by not acting in an intelligent and timely matter, delayed precious time and funds needed to research this disease and help those with AIDS that were literally crying out for support.Enter Matthew Modine as the CDC researcher Don Francis who dared to stand up to the system only to have that system censor him, hamper his research and continually quell the urgency of his mission. On the other hand, we have Alan Alda playing another doctor who, seemingly on a mission to also help fight AIDS, is only out for glory and does more to hurt the fight than help it. This is really sad when you consider such an esteemed doctor could have given so much but did not see the bigger picture....the plight of the many outweighs the need for this one doctor to glorify himself.The cast in this movie is absolutely stellar and provides for such a diverse aura of talent that shines throughout. How can you go wrong with Matthew Modine, Alan Alda, Richard Gere, Steve Martin, Angelica Huston and Lilly Tomlin to name just a few?To finish off, the movie closes with a very heart wrenching picture montage of famous celebrities who have died of AIDS over the years.

354720,AFOK05KDCHSHL,6303073573,Libretio,"[10, 11]","AND THE BAND PLAYED ON(USA - 1993)Aspect ratio: 1.78:1TV soundtrack: Dolby StereoWhilst Hollywood was busy congratulating itself for the critical and commercial success of PHILADELPHIA (1993) - an awkward, uncomfortable drama which undermined its own sincerity for the sake of mainstream acceptance - HBO debuted Roger Spottiswoode's AND THE BAND PLAYED ON, an adptation of the late Randy Shilts' hotly debated chronicle of the AIDS crisis in America. Itself the subject of considerable controversy, the film took several years to develop and was eventually taken out of Spottiswoode's hands during the editing process, to be completed by Bill Couturie (co-producer of the Oscar-winning documentary COMMON THREADS: STORIES FROM THE QUILT [1989]), who's credited as an editorial 'consultant' in the closing titles. Not merely a 'gay' drama, the film has broad-based appeal, both as a narrative and as an invaluable history lesson.From the first case diagnosed in Copenhagen in 1977 to the US death toll in July 1993, Arnold Schulman's script follows the heroic efforts of virologist Don Francis (Matthew Modine at his most earnest) to uncover the source of an unknown 'plague' which is killing gay men, hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users across America. Unfortunately, as the unfolding drama reminds us in no uncertain terms, the crisis coincided with Reagan's election to the presidency, establishing a right-wing administration which refused even to publicly acknowledge the problem until it began to spread beyond the gay community and affect 'ordinary' voters.Like the book on which it's based, the film vents its spleen on those who turned a blind eye to the escalating tragedy until it was too late, especially the blood bank industry which ignored repeated scientific warnings about possible contamination of the blood supply until lawsuits from people who became infected during transfusions forced them into action, and the gay community which railed against the proposed closure of bath houses in major cities as an infringement of their hard-earned sexual freedoms. Scientific divisions simply exacerbated the problem: Alan Alda portrays the eminent scientist Robert Gallo as an insensitive, vainglorious bully who was prepared to sacrifice lives whilst pursuing credit for discovering how the virus worked, an accolade which actually belonged to a number of extremely diligent French scientists! The film is careful to acknowledge Gallo's hard work in this field, but as depicted here, his arrogance leaves a rotten taste in the mouth.With Modine's eminently sympathetic scientist-figure acting as the primary focus, the fast-moving screenplay conveys a wealth of information with remarkable clarity, keeping the viewer fully informed throughout. Paradoxically, if it wasn't for the all-star cast (including Richard Gere, Lily Tomlin, Ian McKellen, Phil Collins, etc.), the film might not have been made at all, but their contributions - often fleeting - are sometimes distracting rather than illuminating (""Oh look, there's Anjelica Huston, Steve Martin!"", etc.), though the performances are uniformly strong, particularly since there's no time to sketch these characters in anything but the most basic terms. Evidence of production troubles is non-existent, and the film ends on an emotional highpoint with documentary footage of celebrities and individuals whose lives have been touched by AIDS, set to Elton John's 'The Last Song'.If nothing else, AIDS forced society to confront its two greatest taboos, sex and death, and it also exposed a raft of prejudices which had been festering for decades. Galvanized by its sense of loss, and appalled by the state-sanctioned bigotry which prevented adequate funding of research and treatment while the US government allowed its defence budget to spiral into the stratosphere, the gay community finally shook off its complacency and launched a prolonged militant campaign which eventually forced the issue into the public arena. The film provokes anger and sadness in equal measure as it outlines the circumstances which incited the virus to epidemic proportions, and the inevitable devastation which followed.But every so often, the story makes way for something more profound than mere anger, and reduces the viewer to heartbroken silence: A young man, once beautiful, waits alone for death in a room at the V.A. hosital in Los Angeles, slowly succumbing to the lesions which are beginning to destroy his brain. As the scene concludes, he turns toward a window overlooking an enormous cemetery featuring row upon row of gleaming-white gravestones which stretch to the horizon, an image that links the fallen victims of a bygone conflict to those of the present generation, dying in their thousands as a helpless world looks on.Incidentally, the film's R rating seems unusually harsh, unless the MPAA was

354721,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6303073573,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","I admit I'm quite surprised, though I shouldn't be, with the callous disregard and shameful arrogance born out of the passage of time.In 1993 this film was a powerful expos&eacute; and pointed indictment that finally gave a wide voice to the many whom this horrific disease attacked.The unbelievable hubris of those who didn't live through these times is quite amazing. Seriously - a weak story? Clich&eacute;d? How could it be clich&eacute;d having been one of the first mainstream productions to engage this plague?Wow.Just... wow.Read Shilts' novel before this became a movie and I remember thinking at the time: There is no way any filmmaker could tackle this project without failing to encompass the magnitude of the... event. Can still vividly remember the daily news reports during the early 80's - the implosion of social order was shocking and frightening. It's difficult to imagine today. Nurses and doctors refusing to go to their jobs, paramedics who quit and literally walked away from patients in the streets, cops who refused to arrest criminals, criminals who played on the fear, people hiding in their homes - we were so very close to mass hysteria. It's almost impossible to comprehend without sounding ridiculously melodramatic. But it really happened. The most recent event that has some relevance to modern audiences would be the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. However, even that only barely touches on the terror that swept, not just a single state, but the entirety of the country during those confusing early days.Personal, political, scientific, legal, local, national, global - so many threads and so many stories that crossed and tangled - it seemed a gordian task with no Macedonian at hand to cut. But Director Roger Spottiswoode somehow distilled the essence of the immense tragedy into a functional screenplay, deftly avoiding the easy steps onto some spiteful and angry soapbox.Undoubtedly upsetting those who believe screaming and perfect 20/20 hindsight is more effective than an honest look into the mirror.Everyone dropped the ball.Really confused how some reviewers can only see one aspect of the story. Shilts' himself pointed out the intransigence and apathy within all levels, from community self governance to national leadership, that could've helped stem the tide. Stunning that somehow Reagan was THE bad guy. And what about the bath house owners? The private clubs? The gay groups who vociferously defended privacy over public health? The various city and state bureaucracies which leisurely bungled every step, more focused on finding a name for the problem instead of tackling the horns of their constituencies; immediacy and speed, qualities that could be never be ascribed to incompetent government-run leviathans.Shilts' point was that everyone failed to see the scope of the disaster. A message that, to this day, still hasn't gotten through to the entrenched dogma of revisionists and apologists across the spectrum of sexuality.Very sad.So I'm grateful that Spottiswoode showcased that inadequate and irresponsible were found across the board, touching every so-called authority. Nearly every single person and entity, regardless of their position or politics, saw only their own personal and unsurprisingly, limited, view of the problem. Few saw the enormous magnitude of tragedy that was about to befall everyone. There were few ""heroes"". And that made Dr. Don Francis' role in the story so much more heroic. The modern incarnation of Paul Revere. He really tried.Also suspect there is more than a bit of jealousy in some of the negative comments - very similar to the immature hate I hear from fanboys whose comic book fails to get published, film students who never break into the business, and the common envy of those who never find ""success"". (Note: I'm commenting on some of the reviews of the period as well as those here on Amazon) As if they could ever do better. It's why Envy is number six on the list.This film is a stunning achievement, not just of the time, but as a message that still resonates some 30 years later. And will continue to do so - and not just as a homosexual touchstone. Spottiswoode decisively cleaved that aspect from the hardened knuckleheads who can only see things through the strident language of politics and personal glorification; delivering to all of us a story of humanity. We are all human. And that's the message. The same laudable attributes, the same terrible shortcomings - regardless of whom you desire in your bed.And though the film is incredible, yes, I will say that the book is understandably deeper - able to truly delve into the twisted morass of the AIDS Story. But the film remains, for many who do not read print in any form, a format that allows the message and the lessons of the tragedy to reach a wider audience.Note:- Wasn't planning on writing a review for this film. However, I stumbled upon a different movie website which cast this film in a light that, had I not already screened the movie, would have turned me away. I see from Amazon that those same reviews (in general) are not replicated here, but by that time I had already committed time and energy; didn't see the point of not adding my voice to the well deserved praise.",5,Humanity On Trial,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,5261,"['admit', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surprised', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'callous', 'disregard', 'shameful', 'arrogance', 'born',

354724,A2E9TRM8096BXU,6303073573,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[6, 7]","Many years ago in college I was forced to watch this film by a do-gooding professor. Naturally I resented it. I was a hard-drinking, irresponsible fraternity boy who did not want to think about the negative potential consequences of sex...especially since I was already possessing of the knowledge carnal of several girls in the class. However, having watched ""And The Band Played On"" I found myself quite unable to forget it - not because it frightened me, but because I'd never seen anything quite like it. Forget for a moment the enormity of acting talent assembled in the film; it was an arresting (and touching) scientific mystery with a lot of ugly sexual politics thrown in.  It sparked an interest in ""dialogue-driven"" movies which  is with me to this day, and is a pretty fine example of how to make a riveting movie that lacks bombs, bikinis or buckets o' blood.""And The Band Played On"" is quite simply the story of AIDS - how it was initially discovered, the huge mystery it presented to scientists,  and the disgusting behind-the-scenes political wrangle which occurred when those scientists tried to take steps to contain the disease before it became an epidemic.  Dr. Don Francis (Matthew Modine) is an epidemiologist for the CDC, hot on the trail of a mysterious ""gay plague"" which is killing large numbers of homosexual men. Without money, equipment or the support of the Reagan Administration, he and his colleagues (a fine array of great character actors such as Charles Martin Smith) somehow manage to identify it as a lethal new virus which, as it turns out, isn't unique to gay men at all. Discovering that a large number of hemophiliacs are dying from the disease, they realize that it has gotten into the blood supply and are astonished and horrified when they realize they have neither the power nor the influence to get the ""blood industry"" to stop giving out AIDS-tainted blood. At the same time, a sordid dispute breaks out between the brilliant but horribly egocentric and ethically challenged Dr. Robert Gallo (Alan Alda) of the NIH, who claims to have first identified the disease,  and the French scientists of the Pasteur Institute who - at least according to this movie - actually deserve the credit. This dispute further retards the already staggering effort to fight the fast-spreading epidemic  -- indeed, by the time the film wraps up, you have to wonder if the damned virus wasn't actually paying bureacrats, businessmen and politicians to ""look busy and do nothing.""Despite the bleak and unappetizing subject matter, there is a lot to admire and enjoy in this film. The medical mystery, which requires a lot of ""shoe-leather epidemiology"", will fascinate anyone who enjoys forensic  or ""medical detective"" shows. The writing is generally good, even when obvious and preachy. The muscial score is incredibly affecting. But what most stands out is the profusion of great actors.  Matthew Modine is fairly workmanlike, but has terrific chemistry with his two nemesis, the good-hearted but brutally realistic bureacrat-boss Saul Rubinek, and the delightfully villainous Dr. Gallo. Rubinek is especially effective because his character is neither ""bad"" nor wrong; he is simply practical, a kind of cold-water dispenser on Modine's nave fire-eater. As for Alda...here is a guy who spent most of his career playing the loveable Hawkeye Pierce; who knew he could handle the role of a vicious SOB with such aplomb?The kudos do not end there. Charles Martin Smith is great as the nerdy but resolute Dr. Harold Jaffee, Richard Gere manages to look suitably sick with fear as an HIV-infected choreographer,  and Patrick Bauchau is smoothly sympathetic as the kindhearted French doctor Montagnier. Ian McKellen, Swoozie Kurtz and Lilly Thomlin are also good, but really, the list of stars and veteran character actors is almost endless and includes everyone from Steve Martin to Angelica Huston. Hell, even Phil Collins is effective as a smarmy sociopath who runs a gay bath house in Frisco.I realize that a movie about AIDS is gonna go over like a lead duck for most people, but anyone who has the guts to watch this affecting, thoughtful dramatization is not going to be sorry.

It chronicles the outbreak of AIDS in the U.S. and elsewhere and the steps taken (or not taken) in reaction to it.Like any good movie, it keeps it human with the relationships of the people in it. Matthew Modine plays Dr. Don Francis, a sometimes misunderstood crusader that is looking to [i]save human lives.[/i] That's it - he doesn't care who finds the virus first or who gets credit for the patent or any of that - he just wants to save lives. One of the best quotes is when they are having a meeting with the blood industry before the virus has been isolated and they refuse to use a Hepatitis B test (which was shown 82% effective in identifying blood infected with AIDS) because of the cost and a &#34;handful of transfusion fatalities and 8 dead hemophiliacs,&#34; to which he responds: &#34;How many dead hemophiliacs do you need? How many people have to die to make it cost efficient for you people to do something about it? A hundred? A thousand? Give us a number so we won't annoy you again until the amount of money you begin spending on lawsuits make it more profitable for you to save people than to kill them.&#34;The movie points out, without subtlety, that the biggest obstacles to overcoming and finding a cure for AIDS, isn't AIDS itself. Dr. Curran, head of the CDC, who is trying to be a political animal in order to get *some* funding, is one of the obstacles because of his superiors. Another impediment is all of the red tape and the politics of the time where a disease that was initially thought to be killing only gay men, is ignored. Dr. Robert Gallo (played by Alan Alda), is an American doctor, whose specialty is the human retrovirus. He seems to think he is competing against the French instead of the virus. The movie (which isn't intended to be taken as the gospel) does state at the end that he was and still is a leading researcher in this field and that while he may not have always acted in the spirit of collaboration, he is still an amazing researcher who has championed research in this field. Again - this movie isn't intended as a documentary, but a person's point of view intermixed with factual dates and major events.This movie is well produced and has a stellar cast. The emotional impact is intense and by the ending epilogue sequence, there is a stark realization that we could have been so much further along with the fight against this disease if only...We still have so far to go to fight discrimination and fear, but this movie does show that compassion always trumps our baser instincts. 5 stars - HIGHLY recommended!",5,A must view!,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,2624,"['docu-movie', 'based', 'Randy', 'Shilts', 'novel', 'outbreak', 'AIDS', 'U.S.', 'elsewhere', 'steps', 'taken', 'not', 'taken', 'reaction', 'it.Like', 'good', 'movie', 'human', 'relationships', 'people', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Dr.', 'Don', 'Francis', 'sometimes', 'misunderstood', 'crusader', 'looking', '[', 'i', ']', 'save', 'human', 'lives', '[', '/i', ']', 'That', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'virus', 'first', 'who', 'credit', 'patent', 'just', 'save', 'lives', 'One', 'best', 'quotes', 'when', 'are', 'having', 'meeting', 'blood', 'industry', 'virus', 'been', 'isolated', 'refuse', 'use', 'Hepatitis', 'B', 'test', 'was', 'shown', '82', '%', 'effective', 'identifying', 'blood', 'infected', 'AIDS', 'cost', '34', 'handful', 'transfusion', 'fatalities', '8', 'dead', 'hemophiliacs', '34', '34', 'How', 'many', 'dead', 'hemophiliacs', 'do', 'need', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'die', 'make', 'cost', 'efficient', 'people', 'do', 'something', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'Give', 'number', 'wo', ""n't"", 'annoy', 'again', 'amount', 'money', 'begin', 'spending', 'lawsuits', 'make', 'more', 'profitable', 'save', 'people', 'kill', 'them.', '34', 'movie', 'out', 'subtlety', 'biggest', 'obstacles', 'overcoming', 'finding', 'cure', 'AIDS', ""n't"", 'AIDS', 'Dr.', 'Curran', 'head', 'CDC', 'who', 'trying', 'be', 'political', 'animal', 'order', 'get', '*some*', 'funding', 'one', 'obstacles', 'superiors', 'impediment', 'red', 'tape', 'politics', 'time', 'where', 'disease', 'was', 'initially', 'thought', 'be', 'killing', 'only', 'gay', 'men', 'ignored', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Gallo', 'played', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'American', 'doctor', 'specialty', 'human', 'retrovirus', 'think', 'competing', 'French', 'instead', 'virus', 'movie', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'taken', 'gospel', 'state', 'end', 'was', 'still', 'leading', 'researcher', 'field', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'always', 'acted', 'spirit', 'collaboration', 'still', 'amazing', 'researcher', 'who', 'championed', 'research', 'field', 'Again', 'movie', ""n't"", 'intended', 'documentary', 'person', 'point', 'view', 'intermixed', 'factual', 'dates', 'major', 'events.This', 'movie', 'well', 'produced', 'stellar', 'cast', 'emotional', 'impact', 'intense', 'ending', 'epilogue', 'sequence', 'stark', 'realization', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'further', 'along', 'fight', 'disease', 'only', 'still', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'go', 'fight', 'discrimination', 'fear', 'movie', 'show', 'compassion', 'always', 'trumps', 'baser', 'instincts', '5', 'stars', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended']",N/A

Hard as it was to watch for all the painful memories it brings flooding back into the forefront of the consciousness.  The callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness of the Reagan Administration as those it considered lesser Americans lay in hospitals suffering and dying.This DVD shows Dr Gallo as a shallow man with a vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin to human compassion unless of course the camera's were rolling.  The film shows the CDC being headed by political hacks who elevated the collected arts of administrative spin control, reckless indifference to suffering \ death of people it did not like and stonewalling to the stuff of mythic legend.While the DVD shows the ugliest demons of the human heart laid bare that the whole world might see it also shares the most humane and tender moments of the early days of before HIV / AIDS got those names.  The film showed how even in one of america's darkest hours when true presidental leadership was asleep at the switch, the little people those deep inside government did all they could to protect the public health living up to the highest standards for onr called to offer themselves in service to our nation.The DVD simply told the truth and it is left pretty much to the viewer to make up his or her own mind what they think of those times.  There were some moving facts at the end of the DVD all now quite dated.  I guess the thing that caught me so totally off guard was the running tally showing the numbers of sick and dying people from the earliest days of the epidemic.  It is so sad how the Reagan adminstration so viciously sat on its hands doing nothing while so many died in an epidemic that it might not have stopped but it might have slowed significantly had it only acted with the same fortitude at home that it mustered in Beruit or Libia.Yes I dwell too much on the sickening aspects of those times because just seeing it again after having lived through it makes me mad. Seeing this DVD just convinces me that had we a real leader in the white house when AIDS HIV GRID Gay Cancer first burst onto the scene things might have not been so grim.  But this DVD is so much more than the venom and pain of loss it also highlights human kind at its best.  There is much love in this DVD balanced with the grim realities of the day.

I was a newspaper editor in Oklahoma at the time, and I remember the early news stories which first hinted that something big and bad was brewing in the gay community. Although I am straight, I have friends of that sexual preference, and in fact, one of my sister's oldest and dearest friends was an early casualty of this killer disease. Even better than this movie, however, is the source book by the late Randy Shilts, who was a journalist in San Francisco (who happened to be gay, and who happened to contract and die of AIDS eventually.)
