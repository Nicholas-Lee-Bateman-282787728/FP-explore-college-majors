1640764,A3KZTEUNNB20OY,B00BXTDVEO,book lover,"[0, 0]","For those who don't know, How the West Was Won is about a family from the South that moves West at the start of the Civil War, after which they run into all sorts of trouble and adventures (well, some more than others!).  Luke is played by Bruce Boxleitner who was really perfect for the part.  Sort of the John Crichton (Farscape) of the American West.This DVD set contains 2 discs with four episodes (about 90 minutes each, except the pilot episode which runs about two hours).  How the West Was Won is similar to Centennial in terms of entertainment value.  It's not perfect (sometimes the parts with Native Americans are a little silly) but it's great fun and, overall, plenty good.  Be sure to watch the pilot episode first which is located on the second disc (please note that two of the characters in the pilot episode had different names from their characters when the series actually started one year later: Seth becomes Luke and Jed becomes Josh).Hopefully it won't be long until the remaining episodes are released on DVD.  I'm also hoping for some extras, such as interviews with the cast and/or some commentaries.  In closing, this was one of the more intelligent (even if not perfect) Western TV series.

I watched this series back in 1976-77 and have the entire series on bootleg DVDs.  How The West Was Won started as a movie pilot in 1976 (The Macahans), followed by a 3-part mini series in February 1977.  The first season started in the fall of 1977. (13 episodes).The only 2 things on this DVD are the movie pilot (inexplicably shown out of order on the 2nd disc as a bonus feature) and the 3-part mini series from 1977 shown first on disc 1 and completed on disc 2.  If someone had never seen this series, they'd be pretty confused watching the programs in the order they are presented.I've given this 3 stars simply because the series was magnificent as was James Arness as Zeb Macahan as well as the breathtaking scenery, musical score and story-lines.

1640785,AEI8BQNE8ZTKB,B00BXTDVEO,Walton P. Sellers III,"[23, 24]","Those of you who are old enough to remember when this series came out are already familiar with the quality with which ""How the West Was Won"" was crafted.  This DVD product is made along those lines.  I agree with two other reviewers when they say that the first ""season"" is complete, because the first installment of this series, as it aired on TV, consisted of the ""Macahans"" pilot (1976), and a three-part ""miniseries"" that began airing in 1977. This was followed by a final installment of episodes that continued the saga up to the series' conclusion in 1979.  This last portion is notable because Fionnaula Flanagan took over the main female lead from Eva Marie Saint; Kate Macahan's character was supplanted by that of her sister, Molly Culhane.The DVD's in this set are sharp and clear, a fitting tribute to Mr. Arness and the actors who worked with him.  This series has been called the last of the great ""made for TV"" Westerns and is superb family entertainment that parents can watch with their kids without concern.  In the late 1970's after ""Gunsmoke,"" Zeb Macahan became as iconic a character as Matt Dillon.  Strong and firm, yet gentle when he needed to be, the elder Macahan kept his family together in a realistic portrayal of many of the issues that arose in the early West.  Bruce Boxleitner also deserves a thumbs-up for his portrayal of the eldest nephew, Luke Macahan.  The main women characters of the series, (especially Eva Marie Saint and Fionnaula Flanagan,) gave, in my opinion, a realistic portrayal of how crucial the pioneer woman was to the development of the West.  There were excellent supporting characters aplenty, too, such as Jack Elam, Morgan Woodward,Brian Keith, and Ken Curtis (Festus in ""Gunsmoke."")  Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of the Sioux chief Satangkai was nothing short of genius!I had a very slight acquaintance with Mr. Arness in his later years, and I know Jim would be very proud to see this set finally out on DVD.  I believe that Zeb Macahan was more fun for him to play than Matt Dillon was.  Zeb did not have the restraints that come with a badge, but if you really watch the series, you will see definite similarities between the two characters.  I only hope that the other seasons receive appropriate treatment by the manufacturers and doesn't get ""cut off"" without having all of the seasons appear.  This series is every bit as good as ""Gunsmoke"" was and aptly deserves its niche in the long history of quality American TV Western series.",5,"Welcome Home, Zeb!",1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,2500,"['who', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'quality', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'was', 'crafted', 'DVD', 'product', 'made', 'lines', 'agree', 'two', 'other', 'reviewers', 'when', 'say', 'first', 'season', 'complete', 'first', 'installment', 'series', 'aired', 'TV', 'consisted', 'Macahans', 'pilot', '1976', 'three-part', 'miniseries', 'began', 'airing', '1977', 'was', 'followed', 'final', 'installment', 'episodes', 'continued', 'saga', 'up', 'series', 'conclusion', '1979', 'last', 'portion', 'notable', 'Fionnaula', 'Flanagan', 'took', 'over', 'main', 'female', 'lead', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Kate', 'Macahan', 'character', 'was', 'supplanted', 'sister', 'Molly', 'Culhane.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'sharp', 'clear', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Mr.', 'Arness', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'series', 'been', 'called', 'last', 'great', 'made', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'superb', 'family', 'entertainment', 'parents', 'can', 'watch', 'kids', 'concern', 'late', '1970', 'Gunsmoke', 'Zeb', 'Macahan', 'became', 'iconic', 'character', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Strong', 'firm', 'yet', 'gentle', 'when', 'needed', 'be', 'elder', 'Macahan', 'kept', 'family', 'together', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'many', 'issues', 'arose', 'early', 'West', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'also', 'thumbs-up', 'portrayal', 'eldest', 'nephew', 'Luke', 'Macahan', 'main', 'women', 'characters', 'series', 'especially', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Fionnaula', 'Flanagan', 'gave', 'opinion', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'how', 'crucial', 'pioneer', 'woman', 'was', 'development', 'West', 'were', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'characters', 'aplenty', 'too', 'such', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'Morgan', 'Woodward', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Festus', 'Gunsmoke', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'portrayal', 'Sioux', 'chief', 'Satangkai', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius', 'had', 'very', 'slight', 'acquaintance', 'Mr.', 'Arness', 'later', 'years', 'know', 'Jim', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'see', 'set', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'believe', 'Zeb', 'Macahan', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'play', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'Zeb', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'restraints', 'come', 'badge', 'really', 'watch', 'series', 'will', 'see', 'definite', 'similarities', 'two', 'characters', 'only', 'hope', 'other', 'seasons', 'receive', 'appropriate', 'treatment', 'manufacturers', ""n't"", 'get', 'cut', 'off', 'having', 'seasons', 'appear', 'series', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Gunsmoke', 'was', 'aptly', 'niche', 'long', 'history', 'quality', 'American', 'TV', 'Western', 'series']",How the West Was Won: Season 1
