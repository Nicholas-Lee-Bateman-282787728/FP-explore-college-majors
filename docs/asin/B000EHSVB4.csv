973139,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000EHSVB4,,"[3, 3]","Historical BackgroundThe TV series was based loosely on the Hill Ranch located at the western edge of Calaveras County, not far from Stockton (one episode places the Barkley Ranch a few hours ride from town while another has Jarrod riding past a Calaveras County sign on his way to the TV series' ranch). The Hill Ranch existed from 1855 until 1931, exceeded 1,000 acres, and had the Mokelumne River running through it. Lawson Hill ran the ranch until he was murdered in 1861. His wife Euphemia (aka ""Auntie Hill"") then became the matriarch. During their marriage they had four children, one daughter and three sons. Today, the location of the ranch is covered by the waters of Lake Camanche. A California State historical marker standing at Camanche South Shore Park mentions the historic ranch.Victoria Barkley, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, was the widowed matriarch of the wealthy, influential Barkley family living in 19th century Stockton in California's central valley. Victoria Barkley was the undisputed master of the Barkley ranch. In fact, Stanwyck's refusal to portray Barkley as fragile was controversial at the time. Barkley's husband, Thomas, had been killed several years prior in the universe of the series.Jarrod Thomas Barkley, the eldest son, was a respected attorney. Richard Long played the role as the more intelligent and calmer of the Barkley sons. While Jarrod preferred the law to settle disputes, he was known to resort to frontier justice and violence when necessary. Jarrod was briefly married in one episode only to see his new wife killed off almost immediately.Hot-tempered younger son Nick Barkley, who managed the family ranch, was portrayed by Peter Breck. Nick was well-known for his leather vests and large black hat. He was also notorious for getting into fist fights. At times, he would fight with his brothers as well.Linda Evans played Audra, Victoria's only daughter. Much like her mother, Audra was no wall flower and often was involved in daring stunts and did not ride side-saddled.Heath Barkley was the illegitimate son of Victoria's late husband. Lee Majors portrayed Heath, who gradually gained acceptance from the rest of the Barkley clan. Although Nick initially detested Heath, they eventually became close. In fact, Nick eventually became closer to Heath than Jarrod.The youngest Barkley son was Eugene, a medical student studying at Berkeley, played by Charles Briles. He was seen sporadically in only five first season episodes and then written out. Only once was his name ever mentioned again. Eugene Barkley is an example of the Chuck Cunningham Syndrome.The regular cast was rounded out by Napoleon Whiting, as Silas, the Barkleys' majordomo.A morbid running gag was that every time one of the Barkley children fell in love or was married, the wife or beau (for Audra) would suffer a horrible end or tragic death never to be mentioned again (with the exception of ""Miranda"" (BarBara Luna) who fell in love with Nick but who felt compelled to leave him to help her people in ""Miranda"".Dell Comics published a short-lived comic book for six issues in 1966-69. (the last issue reprinted the first, and came out two years after issue #5). All issues had photo covers.Both Long and Breck had been regulars for a short time on another classic Western series, Maverick, although in different seasons; Long played ""Gentleman Jack Darby"" to pick up the slack when Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. began 77 Sunset Strip and could no longer play ""Dandy Jim Buckley,"" while Breck assumed the role of ""Doc Holliday"" when Gerald Mohr was unavailable.Lee Majors later recounted on The Tonight Show how he was justly taken to task by Barbara Stanwyck after a star complex he had developed adversely affected the series.This show marks the debut of new actors Lee Majors and Linda Evans, who both went on to fame on other shows. Majors, went on to have a successful acting career: Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law, The Six Million Dollar Man and The Fall Guy. Evans went on to work on the popular 1980s prime-time soap opera, Dynasty.While The Big Valley is set primarily in and near the city of Stockton, the filming of the series took place in Southern California.Wilfred M. Cline, A.S.C., Technicolor Associate Cinematographer on Gone with the Wind (1939), was director of photography of several Big Valley episodes, together with Chas E. Burke, A.S.C.The Big Valley and Barbara Stanwyck is mentioned in the film Bug in a chat between the characters Peter and Agnes",4,A CLOSE COUSIN TO BONANZA!,1227484800,"11 24,

I literally sat transfixed while watching these episodes, and plan to enjoy them many times again.  I must admit, watching them in succession, the drama can seem a bit over the top at times, but the produces really knew how to pack a punch, obvious in light of the huge cult following the show has.

It was the first TV western where they talked about a progeny child (Health)  joining a land/cattle family, The Barclays. The show was similar to Bonanza in many ways, however I do not know why I liked this one better. It was also a western my father and I watched together without fighting, so ity holds an endearing place in my heartThe film legend Barbara Stanwyck created the role of the matriarch of the Barclay clan. Her Victoria Barclay is the glue that holds the family (and the show)  together. Richard Long (from the movie The Egg and I and TV's Nanny & The Professor) plays Jarrod, the lawyer and eldest son. Nick, who runs the ranch, is played by Peter Breck (who was in the 1958 TV western Black Saddles) . Before she was part of the TV show  Dynasty (see my DVD review-SHAMELESS PLUG), Linda Evans was the only daughter (Aundra)  in the Barclay Dynasty. Lee Majors, long before he was the Six Million Dollar Man and the Fall Guy (both NOT ON DVD-Would someone take the HINT!) , had his first acting role playing  Heath, the illegitimate son.In the beginning of the series, most of the early tele-plays involved Heath and his role in the Barclay family. After the first five episodes, it started to revolve through  the whole family having their own in divisional  showcases.To me, the Big Valley was better than Gunsmoke or Bonanza.. The characters seem more real to me. I watched VALLEY  in reruns after the original shows had aired, I even liked it on the Western Channel.

973151,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000EHSVB4,Chrijeff,"[6, 6]","In Stockton, California, and the surrounding ""Big Valley,"" the name to conjure with is Barkley.  Victoria (Barbara Stanwyck), six years widowed (her husband Tom was killed in a battle with railroad hired guns while laeding his neighbors in resistance against a land grab) is the matriarch of a family with interests ranging from cattle to mining to lumber and vineyards to river shipping, factories, mills, and a foundry.  Her oldest son Jarrod, about 30, generally easygoing but with a strong feel for ethics and justice, is a lawyer with offices in San Francisco and Stockton and takes care of the family's legal and financial affairs; four-years-younger second son Nick (Peter Breck)--proud, tough, hot-tempered, physically imposing (he can actually lift Jarrod right off his feet), sometimes loud and impulsive, but ferociously protective of his family, their interests, and their name--ramrods the various businesses, chiefly the ranch, and is a hard worker who is respected by every man on the payroll; youngest son Eugene (Charles Briles), 21, is attending college at Berkeley; and throaty-voiced, curvaceous daughter Audra (Linda Evans), 18, says of herself, ""Mother says I'm shameless, Jarrod says I'm spoiled--[but] Nick...he understands.""  Into their lives rides the young man (Lee Majors, later known as ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Fall Guy"") who gives only one name--Heath--and claims to be Tom Barkley's ""bastard son,"" who was raised in the dying mining town of Strawberry and has worked as everything from a crab- and salmon-fisher to a hired gun.  Much of the first season revolves around his efforts to prove himself a true Barkley and make a place for himself in both the family and the Valley itself.Like ""Bonanza,"" this is primarily a story about a family's conflicts, both within and without its own house, but Heath's illegitimate birth (a very mature element to introduce on series TV in the mid-'60's: I think this was the first time I ever heard the word ""bastard"" spoken on broadcast) adds a fresh angle.  Victoria accepts Heath almost immediately, and he is drawn strongly to her from a very early point; he can't settle right away on what (except ""ma'am"") to call her, but ""The last thing I'd ever want to do is hurt [her].""  He also bonds tightly with Nick and Audra, the two siblings most like himself and (presumably) their father (once when someone describes him as ""the old man's [woods] colt,"" Nick--who does menacing very well--says in a cold growl, ""Nobody says that about him to me"").  And occasionally things out of his past pop up to cause trouble for the family, as in ""The Guilt of Matt Bentell"" (when he recognizes the brutal C.O. of the Civil War POW camp where he spent seven months), ""The Death Merchant"" (the man who shot Tom Barkley's murderer returns for a visit and proves to be a merciless murderer who once came close to killing him), and ""Into the Widow's Web"" (his boyhood love, now a singer married to an exhibition sharpshooter, comes to Stockton and he is accused of murder when the man turns up dead).What makes this series especially enjoyable is that it doesn't always rely on violence to make its plots run: there may be a fistfight in almost every episode, but not every conflict ends with gunplay.  And the plots themselves are often unusual: a retired general (Andrew Duggan) whom Nick knew during the War turns out to be a charismatic clone of the filibuster William Walker; a mustang hunter in whom Audra becomes interested proves to be the leader of a band of murderous night-riders; Nick is bitten by a rabid wolf and goes off by himself to try to spare his family the ordeal of watching him die; an earthquake traps Victoria in the wine cellar of the local Catholic church along with a pregnant Indian girl and a hard-drinking, discontented ranchhand (Charles Bronson); a strike at the family's mine reunites Heath with an old friend; a band of Irish immigrants claims it has purchased title to a large chunk of Barkley land, and Nick makes an uneasy common cause with its leader to find out the truth; Nick's fiancee turns out to have a psychological flaw that may mean tragedy for the family; a middle-aged outlaw who has suddenly decided he wants to learn to read and write kidnaps Victoria to serve as his teacher; Jarrod learns that a man whose conviction he won as a prosecutor was in fact innocent, and sets out to make amends; Heath is trapped under an overturned wagon and his only hope is Victoria, who must find someone--in the uninhabited forestland high above the ranch--to help get him out; a boat from the family's line, which sank at the close of the Civil War with a large cargo of gold, is unexpectedly rediscovered.Like most of the Westerns of its period, BV has a tendency to play a bit fast and loose with history (there's mention of a Modoc reservation near Stockton, where none existed), but what I find most irritating is that the writers couldn't seem to decide on when the series was supposed to be happening: at various points during first season the year is given as (or implied to be) 1876, 1882, 1878, 1873, and 1880.  (Since Nick and Heath both fought in the War, an earlier date seems most consistent.)  Stanwyck is among the high points of the show: though she starts out as a rather low-key, almost inconsequential character, she soon reveals herself as an iron hand in a velvet glove (watch her dealing with the family's proud Californio-Spanish neighbor, Don Alfredo, in ""Winner Lose All""), and before too long she's shown to be the kind of ""tough broad"" Stanwyck always specialized in playing--and a genuine mother bear when one of her ""cubs"" is threatened.Notable names are plenty in the guest list, as was true of most of the ""adult"" Westerns of TV's Golden Age: among the faces you'll see are Martin Landau, Kevin Hagen, Buck Taylor, Arthur O'Connell, Jason Evers, Ford Rainey, Richard Hale, John McLiam, Virginia Gregg, Katharine Ross (in a role not unlike that she played in the ""Gunsmoke"" episode ""Crooked Mile""), Henry Wilcoxon, R. G. Armstrong, Richard Devon, Anne Helm, Warren Oates, Paul Fix, Nancy Olson, Ronny Howard, Eleanor Audley, Nicolas Surovy, John Dehner, William Shatner (as an old law-school buddy of Jarrod's), James Whitmore, Albert Salmi, George Kennedy, Harold J. Stone, Royal Dano, Richard Anderson, L. Q. Jones (who probably showed up on every Western on the tube at one time or another), Robert Walker Jr., Claude Akins, Anthony Zerbe, Morgan Woodward, Malachi Throne, Bruce Dern, John Anderson, Jeanne Cooper, and Karl Swenson (these five each appear twice, though not in the same role).  Also familiar are several of the sets, including the jail and Long Branch interiors from ""Gunsmoke.""  (The series also shares the tendency of Westerns of its period to use a number of sound-stage ""exteriors,"" often distractingly and inexplicably sandwiching them between actual outdoor shots--why it had to, when the actors were already out in the open air, is bewildering.)  It's also distracting to see the sheriff--who says he's been on the job for 10 years--played by at least four different actors, including Mort Mills and Ken Lynch.  But it's intriguing to see that several of the segments turn on, or at least address, the resentment that often lies close under the surface when people are seen as too rich, or too big, for their britches.  I had forgotten how much I really enjoyed this show, and seeing it again I know why it still has an active online fandom.",4,A family saga,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,7503,"['Stockton', 'California',

From its stellar cast featuring the incomparable Barbara Stanwyck as Victoria Barkley, (the matriarch of a close-knit, proud and prominent family in 1878 California,) well-written/action-packed scripts, to stirring music, The Big Valley remains a standout in the barren plains of TV mediocrity.The first TV drama to feature a powerful female lead (a woman the commercials proudly proclaimed had ""backbone and bite""), it also dealt realistically with situations formerly taboo for TV. It began by revealing that Victoria's husband, Tom Barkley, a prominent, wealthy cattle rancher now deceased, had been involved in a secret affair leading to the birth of an illegitimate son. In addition to the ranch, the family controlled gold and silver mines, citrus groves as well as logging camps.This five-disc (episodes on ""A"" and ""B"" sides) boxed set contains all 30 of the show's first season episodes, including its pilot. A few of these episodes were available years ago on poor quality VHS tapes, but this fantastic release represents the first time that the entire first season of the series has been available to the public in ANY format! As such, most of these episodes have not been seen uncut since the show aired more than 35 years ago.The pilot, which introduces the powerful and proud Barkley family, depicts the conflict when the illegitimate son, Heath, abruptly arrives at the huge Barkley Ranch in the San Joaquin Valley, near Stockton, Calif., in the midst of a range war and claims his birthright.After the recent death of his mother, Heath had learned his father's identify. None of the Barkleys had known of his existence, and it is later revealed that Victoria's husband had broken off the brief affair with Heath's mother and that she had never told him that she was pregnant. Victoria immediately accepts Heath and soon treats him as one of her own sons.In addition to Miss Stanwyck (who performed many of her own stunts despite her age), the cast included Richard Long as eldest son, attorney Jarrod, Peter Breck as son and ranch foreman Nick, Lee Majors as Heath, Linda Evans as daughter Audra, and during its first season, Charles Briles as youngest son Eugene, a character who was dropped without explanation. Napoleon Whiting portrayed the family's servant, Silas, throughout the series.First season episodes included in this set are: (Disc 1, Side A) Palms of Glory; Forty Rifles; Boots with My Father's Name; Young Marauders; (Disc 1, Side B) Odyssey of Jubal Tanner; Heritage; (Disc 2, Side A) Winner Lose All; My Son, My Son;  Earthquake!; The Murdered Party; (Disc 2, Side B) The Way to Kill a Killer; Night of the Wolf; (Disc 3, Side A) The Guilt of Matt Bentell; The Brawlers; Judgment in Heaven; The Invaders; (Disc 3, Side B) By Fires Unseen; A Time to Kill; (Disc 4, Side A) Teacher of Outlaws; Under a Dark Star; Barbary Red; The Death Merchant; (Disc 4, Side B) The Fallen Hawk; Hazard; (Disc 5, Side A) Into the Widow's Web; By Force and Violence; The River Monarch; The Midas Man; and (Disc 5, Side B) Tunnel of Gold; and Last Train to the Fair.As of this writing, the studio had not announced what, if any, special features would be included in the boxed set.Just a few of the guest stars in this first season were Andrew Duggan, John Anderson (Richard Dean Anderson's father), Jeanne Cooper (Young and the Restless), Katharine Ross (The Graduate), Charles Bronson, Warren Oates, Martin Landau (Mission: Impossible!), Ron Howard, Anthony Zerbe, Claude Akins, Yvonne Craig (Batgirl), William Shatner (Star Trek), Bruce Dern (Laura Dern's father), Jill St. John, George Kennedy, and James Whitmore.Here's hoping the remaining seasons of this award-wining series will be released ASAP! We can also only hope that this means other studios that own the rights to other worthy vintage westerns, like The High Chaparral, will get the message that there is an appreciative audience anxiously waiting and begin releasing these episodes on DVD complete season boxed sets.",5,"Boy Howdy, the Powerful Barkleys Ride Onto DVD!!",1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,4148,"['were', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'made', 'greater', 'impression', 'growing', 'up', 'did', 'classic', 'western', 'Big', 'Valley', 'ran', 'ABC', '1965-1969', 'stellar', 'cast', 'featuring', 'incomparable', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Victoria', 'Barkley', 'matriarch', 'close-knit', 'proud', 'prominent', 'family', '1878', 'California', 'well-written/action-packed', 'scripts', 'stirring', 'music', 'Big', 'Valley', 'standout', 'barren', 'plains', 'TV', 'mediocrity.The', 'first', 'TV', 'drama', 'feature', 'powerful', 'female', 'lead', 'woman', 'commercials', 'proudly', 'proclaimed', 'had', 'backbone', 'bite', 'also', 'dealt', 'realistically', 'situations', 'formerly', 'taboo', 'TV', 'began', 'revealing', 'Victoria', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Barkley', 'prominent', 'wealthy', 'cattle', 'rancher', 'now', 'deceased', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'secret', 'affair', 'leading', 'birth', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'addition', 'ranch', 'family', 'controlled', 'gold', 'silver', 'mines', 'citrus', 'groves', 'as', 'well', 'logging', 'camps.This', 'five-disc', 'A', 'B', 'sides', 'boxed', 'set', 'contains', '30', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'including', 'pilot', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'available', 'years', 'ago', 'poor', 'quality', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'fantastic', 'release', 'first', 'time', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'been', 'available', 'public', 'ANY', 'format', 'such', 'most', 'episodes', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'uncut', 'show', 'aired', 'more', '35', 'years', 'ago.The', 'pilot', 'powerful', 'proud', 'Barkley', 'family', 'conflict', 'when', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Heath', 'abruptly', 'huge', 'Barkley', 'Ranch', 'San', 'Joaquin', 'Valley', 'Stockton', 'Calif.', 'midst', 'range', 'war', 'birthright.After', 'recent', 'death', 'mother', 'Heath', 'had', 'learned', 'father', 'identify', 'None', 'Barkleys', 'had', 'known', 'existence', 'later', 'revealed', 'Victoria', 'husband', 'had', 'broken', 'off', 'brief', 'affair', 'Heath', 'mother', 'had', 'never', 'told', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Victoria', 'immediately', 'Heath', 'soon', 'treats', 'one', 'own', 'sons.In', 'addition', 'Miss', 'Stanwyck', 'who', 'performed', 'many', 'own', 'stunts', 'age', 'cast', 'included', 'Richard', 'Long', 'eldest', 'son', 'attorney', 'Jarrod', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'son', 'ranch', 'foreman', 'Nick', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Heath', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'daughter', 'Audra', 'first', 'season', 'Charles', 'Briles', 'youngest', 'son', 'Eugene', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'dropped', 'explanation', 'Napoleon', 'Whiting', 'portrayed', 'family', 'servant', 'Silas', 'series.First', 'season', 'episodes', 'included', 'set', 'are', 'Disc', '1', 'Side', 'A', 'Palms', 'Glory', 'Forty', 'Rifles', 'Boots', 'My', 'Father', 'Name', 'Young', 'Marauders', 'Disc', '1', 'Side', 'B', 'Odyssey', 'Jubal', 'Tanner', 'Heritage', 'Disc', '2', 'Side', 'A', 'Winner', 'Lose', 'All', 'My', 'Son', 'My', 'Son', 'Earthquake', 'Murdered', 'Party', 'Disc', '2', 'Side', 'B', 'Way', 'Kill', 'Killer', 'Night', 'Wolf', 'Disc', '3', 'Side', 'A', 'Guilt', 'Matt', 'Bentell', 'Brawlers', 'Judgment', 'Heaven', 'Invaders', 'Disc', '3', 'Side', 'B', 'Fires', 'Unseen', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Disc', '4', 'Side', 'A', 'Teacher', 'Outlaws', 'Dark', 'Star', 'Barbary', 'Red', 'Death', 'Merchant', 'Disc', '4', 'Side', 'B', 'Fallen', 'Hawk', 'Hazard', 'Disc', '5', 'Side', 'A', 'Widow', 'Web', 'Force', 'Violence', 'River', 'Monarch', 'Midas', 'Man', 'Disc', '5', 'Side', 'B', 'Tunnel', 'Gold', 'Last', 'Train', 'Fair.As', 'writing', 'studio', 'had', 'not', 'announced', 'what', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'be', 'included', 'boxed', 'few', 'guest', 'stars', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'Andrew', 'Duggan', 'John', 'Anderson', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'father', 'Jeanne', 'Cooper', 'Young', 'Restless', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'Graduate', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'Yvonne', 'Craig', 'Batgirl', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'father', 'Jill', 'St.', 'John', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'James', 'Whitmore.Here', 'hoping', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'award-wining', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'ASAP', 'can', 'also', 'only', 'hope', 'other', 'studios', 'own', 'rights', 'other', 'worthy', 'vintage', 'westerns', 'High', 'Chaparral', 'will', 'get', 'message', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'begin', 'releasing', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'complete', 'season', 'boxed', 'sets']",N/A

At an early age, I left Cuba alone and traveled through Mexico to the United States. While alone in Mexico, I missed my family and our way of life back in Punta de la Sierra, a farm located in Pinar del Rio, which is the westernmost province of Cuba.The show became my passion, a look into life on a ranch where a big family confronted daily challenges with such courage that it was riveting and filled with suspense. The Barkley family shared values of honor, loyalty, respect and decency and the show allowed for my continued growth, seeing through the Barkley's, the family I no longer had with me.As Victoria Barkley, Barbara Starwyck was the widowed matriarch figure, guiding this wealthy family as they evolved in Stockton, California during the latter part of the 19th Century. She has two sons and a daughter: Jarrod Thomas Barkley, played by Richard Long, Nick Barkley, played by Peter Breck and Audra, played by Linda Evans.The series starts by a third son, Heath, played by Lee Majors, joining the family, but he is not the son of Victoria Barkley. He struggles to belong and claim what is rightfully his, a place by the side of his brothers and sister, and it is remarkable to see how they incorporate him to the family and how Victoria embraces this young man, providing the love necessary to inspire a relationship as deep as that which she shares with her blood line.During a marathon played this weekend, we were delighted to see great stars such as Richard Dreyfuss, Bruce Dern, Charles Bronson, Diane Baker, Milton Berle, John Carradine, Johnny Crawford, Robert Goulet, Buddy Hackett, Dennis Hopper, Ron Howard, Jill St. John, Martin Landau, George Kennedy, Lou Rawls, William Shatner and others.We highly recommend owning this series and watching it with your family and as you see the different episodes, take the time to discuss the value system that shaped the west. The Big Valley offers the opportunity for growth required today, a world where we have little if anything showing on TV that adds to the development of character. Don't miss seeing...

In the end credits, they thank the Cal Hist Soc, and indeed there's some great context here with post-CW stories, mining trouble stories, etc.  The endings aren't always happy, either.  The Barkleys know best quite a bit, but all of the characters make plenty of mistakes, no one is perfect.  They think that money and power bring responsibilty.  The sound and picture quality are fine.  The stunt doubles bear no resemblence to the cast, and it's fun to watch for changing horses mid-scene.  It's a great looking show though--mighty fine California scenery and I've always liked the show's theme and soundtrack (though it's repetitive, of course).  The interplay between mother, 3 brothers, and sister is always interesting, and they disagree plenty.

Amazingly, this seems to be the only one of the great westerns of the sixties to be realeased on DVDs as seasonal sets.So, remembering that The Big Valley was one of the ""big westerns"" of that time period, and reading of the big name actors in the series, I went ahead and ordered the set.I'd never watched this show before, and I was surprised at just  how amazingly good this show looks.  It's downright beautiful.  We had to wait 40 years to see at home exactly what this show really looked like.  Back in 1965, color TV was a new thing, and they had very round picture tubes with whacky color (always a little green or purple) and general fuzziness.I was also amazed at how much I don't like the characters.  The Barclay family is a smug lawyer, two blustering blowhard cowboys who are quickly joined by a third (Lee Majors), a beautiful strong headed young woman, and their wise tough-as-nails mother.  How will these rich swaggering pompous big-heads survive the perils of owning a huge ranch with servants and lots of guns in 1870's California?Seriously, this is a good value for the money.

I began watching the show when it began its run in syndication in 1969, airing most weekday afternoons.  In my eyes, Linda Evans was simply the most beautiful female on TV back then.To see any season of ""The Big Valley"" finally reach DVD is an event to celebrate.  The reasons I give this release four stars instead of five is that in my humble opinion, the first season was weighed down a bit by overacting, with the cast getting more comfortable in their characters as the season went on, and the writers toning down the soap-opera angst, especially involving Heath.  In the first season, the main cast was given to rambling, almost Shakespearean speechifying, out of place in a western.  Fortunately, this defect was mostly gone by the far superior second season, where Heath is noticeably more laconic and the actors and writers are not trying so hard.Gone by the second season as well is the character of Eugene, the youngest Barkley and least interesting brother.  The actor who played him was drafted and had to leave the show, or so the story goes.  Either way, it only helped the series hit its stride.  Also, Linda Evans was even more beautiful in the second and third seasons.So if you love a great TV western, this is one of the best ever, and although I would recommend the first season to nearly anyone who loves westerns, the series only got better.",4,This has been a Four-Star Production - literally!!!,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,1583,"['never', 'watched', 'Big', 'Valley', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', 'just', '10', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'debuted', 'fall', '1965', 'back', 'then', 'Monday', 'nights', 'when', 'parents', 'said', 'be', 'bed', '10', 'pm', 'obeyed', 'began', 'watching', 'show', 'when', 'began', 'run', 'syndication', '1969', 'airing', 'most', 'weekday', 'afternoons', 'eyes', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'was', 'simply', 'most', 'beautiful', 'female', 'TV', 'back', 'then.To', 'see', 'season', 'Big', 'Valley', 'finally', 'reach', 'DVD', 'event', 'celebrate', 'reasons', 'give', 'release', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'humble', 'opinion', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'weighed', 'down', 'bit', 'overacting', 'cast', 'getting', 'more', 'comfortable', 'characters', 'season', 'went', 'writers', 'toning', 'down', 'soap-opera', 'angst', 'especially', 'involving', 'Heath', 'first', 'season', 'main', 'cast', 'was', 'given', 'rambling', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'speechifying', 'place', 'western', 'Fortunately', 'defect', 'was', 'mostly', 'gone', 'far', 'superior', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'Heath', 'noticeably', 'more', 'laconic', 'actors', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'so', 'hard.Gone', 'second', 'season', 'well', 'character', 'Eugene', 'youngest', 'Barkley', 'least', 'interesting', 'brother', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'was', 'drafted', 'had', 'leave', 'show', 'so', 'story', 'way', 'only', 'helped', 'series', 'hit', 'stride', 'Also', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'second', 'third', 'seasons.So', 'love', 'great', 'TV', 'western', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'would', 'recommend', 'first', 'season', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'who', 'westerns', 'series', 'only', 'got', 'better']",N/A

They have a beautiful sister, Audra and a wise, mother.

But by the third episode even matriarch Victoria Barkley accepts Heath.  It seemed symbolic & significant to them that Tom Barkley's boots fit Heath...leaving the audience to wonder what kind of odd-sized feet Heath and Tom had.  Oh well, if the boot fits, you must be a Barkley.And to be a Barkley is a good thing - beautiful, strong, intelligent and the wealthiest family in the valley.  They pretty much own everything.  Tom Barkley was clearly a busy man, in more ways than one, and made a lot of money.  But being wealthy doesn't mean you don't have to fight for your land, heal rabid wolf bites and deal with weird squatters squatting; if you live near Stockton, California in the late 1800's, that is.  To put it simply, you know where you are if you've got big troubles, big horses & big hair...you're in Big Valley.The family consists of Victoria - a take-charge woman, adored for her fairness & strength.  She has an unrivaled air of confidence and panache - played by Barbara Stanwyck...need I say more?  Eldest son Jarrod (Richard Long) is the dapper, attractive attorney who often plays the father figure to his siblings & the many hooligans apparently gallivanting all over Stockton.  Nick is the gruffest of the brothers; he works the land, and he's loud about it & everything else.  Played by the winning Peter Breck, he's easy on the eyes (especially when he takes his shirt off to work the ranch) and brings humor to the role.  Heath, played by Lee Majors with weird orangey-blonde hair that goes back to his sandy blonde mid-season, is the half-brother accepted and loved by all.  His liquid-blue eyes reveal his sensitivity as he falls in love easily and often.  Eugene (Charles Briles) is the youngest son who is at college most of the time, but makes the occasional appearance.  Audra is the horse-loving, charity-working little sister with gorgeous dresses and 1965 sex-kitten hair.  She's a stunner; she couldn't be anything but stunning, since she was played by the gorgeous Linda Evans.  Unfortunately, Audra is always falling for some loon. Apparently, the valley is rife with losers, and her horse gallops into them left and right.  Can't swing a lasso without hitting a nut in Stockton.The first season, 1965/66, offers a lot of drama with the draw being the closeness of the family and likeability of each character.  I really like this show and think all of the episodes are truly good.  Some of my favorites include:  ""The Invaders,"" where John Dehner hilariously plays an absolute nutball who invades the Barkley ranch; ""Judgment in Heaven"" has Jarrod representing a young woman he brings home so she won't spend Christmas in jail, not knowing her convict boyfriend is on the loose; ""The Midas Man"" has Audra falling for a shady character who is taking advantage of the valley's ranchers and foreclosing on their land in the middle of a drought.There are also some terrific guest stars:  Katharine Ross, Martin Landau-odd but true...he plays a Mexican character, Jeanne Cooper of ""Young and the Restless,""  Ron Howard, Claude Akins, Noreen Corcoran of ""Bachelor Father,"" Yvonne Craig - a.k.a. batgirl in T.V's ""Batman,"" William Shatner, George Kennedy, Jill St. John, Bruce Dern, King Donovan & Kathleen Nolan (Sugar Babe in ""The Real McCoys"")The DVD quality is great - the shows are clear and the sound is good.  There are no extras, but there are 30, hour-long episodes.If you like horses; good looking men; Linda Evans' dimples; Barbara Stanwyck's intense eyes or good, old-fashioned western fun, ""The Big Valley"" is for you.  In other words, if the boot fits...wear it.",5,If the Boot Fits...,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,3833,"['first', 'episodes', 'Big', 'Valley', 'Heath', 'establishing', 'Barkley', 'not', 'easy', 'cozying', 'up', 'family', 'who', 'finding', 'out', 'are', 'product', 'brief', 'affair', 'now-deceased', 'father/husband', 'had', 'third', 'episode', 'even', 'matriarch', 'Victoria', 'Barkley', 'Heath', 'seemed', 'symbolic', 'significant', 'Tom', 'Barkley', 'boots', 'fit', 'Heath', 'leaving', 'audience', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'odd-sized', 'feet', 'Heath', 'Tom', 'had', 'Oh', 'well', 'boot', 'must', 'be', 'Barkley.And', 'be', 'Barkley', 'good', 'thing', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'wealthiest', 'family', 'valley', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Tom', 'Barkley', 'was', 'clearly', 'busy', 'man', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'being', 'wealthy', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fight', 'land', 'heal', 'rabid', 'wolf', 'bites', 'deal', 'weird', 'squatters', 'squatting', 'live', 'Stockton', 'California', 'late', '1800', 'put', 'simply', 'know', 'where', 'are', ""'ve"", 'got', 'big', 'troubles', 'big', 'horses', 'big', 'hair', ""'re"", 'Big', 'Valley.The', 'family', 'Victoria', 'take-charge', 'woman', 'adored', 'fairness', 'strength', 'unrivaled', 'air', 'confidence', 'panache', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'Eldest', 'son', 'Jarrod', 'Richard', 'Long', 'dapper', 'attractive', 'attorney', 'who', 'often', 'father', 'figure', 'siblings', 'many', 'hooligans', 'apparently', 'gallivanting', 'Stockton', 'Nick', 'gruffest', 'brothers', 'land', 'loud', 'everything', 'else', 'Played', 'winning', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'easy', 'eyes', 'especially', 'when', 'shirt', 'work', 'ranch', 'humor', 'role', 'Heath', 'played', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'weird', 'orangey-blonde', 'hair', 'back', 'sandy', 'blonde', 'mid-season', 'half-brother', 'accepted', 'loved', 'liquid-blue', 'eyes', 'reveal', 'sensitivity', 'love', 'easily', 'often', 'Eugene', 'Charles', 'Briles', 'youngest', 'son', 'who', 'college', 'most', 'time', 'occasional', 'appearance', 'Audra', 'horse-loving', 'charity-working', 'little', 'sister', 'gorgeous', 'dresses', '1965', 'sex-kitten', 'hair', 'stunner', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'stunning', 'was', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'Unfortunately', 'Audra', 'always', 'falling', 'loon', 'Apparently', 'valley', 'rife', 'losers', 'horse', 'gallops', 'left', 'right', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'swing', 'lasso', 'hitting', 'nut', 'Stockton.The', 'first', 'season', '1965/66', 'lot', 'drama', 'draw', 'being', 'closeness', 'family', 'likeability', 'character', 'really', 'show', 'think', 'episodes', 'are', 'truly', 'good', 'favorites', 'include', 'Invaders', 'where', 'John', 'Dehner', 'hilariously', 'absolute', 'nutball', 'who', 'Barkley', 'ranch', 'Judgment', 'Heaven', 'Jarrod', 'representing', 'young', 'woman', 'home', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'Christmas', 'jail', 'not', 'knowing', 'convict', 'boyfriend', 'loose', 'Midas', 'Man', 'Audra', 'falling', 'shady', 'character', 'who', 'taking', 'advantage', 'valley', 'ranchers', 'foreclosing', 'land', 'middle', 'drought.There', 'are', 'also', 'terrific', 'guest', 'stars', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'Landau-odd', 'true', 'Mexican', 'character', 'Jeanne', 'Cooper', 'Young', 'Restless', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'Noreen', 'Corcoran', 'Bachelor', 'Father', 'Yvonne', 'Craig', 'a.k.a', 'batgirl', 'T.V', 'Batman', 'William', 'Shatner', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Jill', 'St.', 'John', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'King', 'Donovan', 'Kathleen', 'Nolan', 'Sugar', 'Babe', 'Real', 'McCoys', 'DVD', 'quality', 'great', 'shows', 'are', 'clear', 'sound', 'good', 'are', 'extras', 'are', '30', 'hour-long', 'episodes.If', 'horses', 'good', 'looking', 'men', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'dimples', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'intense', 'eyes', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'western', 'fun', 'Big', 'Valley', 'other', 'words', 'boot', 'fits', 'wear']",N/A

I remember watching in every summer during the 80's, and I had no idea the show was old by the time I watched it. I immediately feel in love with it, and I remember it had another one of my child hood heroes in it at the time Lee Majors from the Six Million Dollar Man and The Fall Guy. This is not to take away from the rest of the cast I grew to love them to, but Lee Majors is who drew me to the show. I am now a Father with a Wife, and two kids and I still love westerns, and I have been showing them every great western show I can find on DVD I grew up watching such as The Big Valley and they love it, but they were just as disappointed as I was that only Season 1 and part of Season 2 had been released! Come on Fox you have had long enough to release this, and if you wont do it for me at least do it for my kids so they can enjoy a little piece of entertainment history before their all grown up. I also want to ask one question even though I doubt anybody from the studios ever read these comments, but I will ask anyways. ""Why do shows like this get released in Region 2 before Region 1? I frankly don't understand it. The shows were made in America first and enjoyed here in America first by Americans so why don't they get released here first for Americans the original target group of these shows to enjoy?

973204,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B000EHSVB4,Robert Huggins,"[3, 7]","""The Big Valley"" joins a growing list of classic TV Westerns from the 1950s and 1960s that are finding their way to DVD.  Other Westerns that had longer runs, like ""Gunsmoke"" and ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp,"" have only been released in ""Best Of"" sets to date.  And the longer running (and similarly themed) ""Bonanza"" has merited just one official 8-episode release (excluding the various public domain releases).  So while this series, which was produced by Four Star Productions and ran from 1965-69, had a respectable run, it's a most welcome surprise that the entire first season has been released on DVD.The releasing company, Fox, delivers all 30 season one episodes spread across five DVDs.  However, I'm puzzled by the way that the episodes have been laid out on each disc, four episodes on side A and two episodes on side B.  Why not an even three episodes on each side?  Regardless, the episodes are pretty solid looking for an early color television series that began broadcasts in September of 1965.  In this respect, Fox deserves high marks.  However, unlike some other classic TV Westerns on DVD, there are absolutely no extra features on ""The Big Valley.""  Since several of the series' stars are happily alive and well, it would have been nice to have included some interviews and/or episode commentaries.  Perhaps, if season one sells well enough, these extra features could be considered for the second season.  All in all, this is a nicely rendered release from Fox that fans of classic TV Westerns are sure to appreciate.",4,This Four Star Production gets ****,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,1546,"['Big', 'Valley', 'growing', 'list', 'classic', 'TV', 'Westerns', '1950s', '1960s', 'are', 'finding', 'way', 'DVD', 'Other', 'Westerns', 'had', 'longer', 'runs', 'Gunsmoke', 'Life', 'Legend', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'released', 'Best', 'sets', 'date', 'longer', 'running', 'similarly', 'themed', 'Bonanza', 'merited', 'just', 'one', 'official', '8-episode', 'release', 'excluding', 'various', 'public', 'domain', 'releases', 'So', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'Four', 'Star', 'Productions', 'ran', '1965-69', 'had', 'respectable', 'run', 'most', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'been', 'released', 'DVD.The', 'releasing', 'company', 'Fox', '30', 'season', 'one', 'spread', 'five', 'DVDs', 'However', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'way', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'laid', 'out', 'disc', 'four', 'episodes', 'side', 'A', 'two', 'episodes', 'side', 'B', 'Why', 'not', 'even', 'three', 'episodes', 'side', 'Regardless', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'looking', 'early', 'color', 'television', 'series', 'began', 'broadcasts', 'September', '1965', 'respect', 'Fox', 'high', 'marks', 'However', 'other', 'classic', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'DVD', 'are', 'absolutely', 'extra', 'features', 'Big', 'Valley', 'several', 'series', 'stars', 'are', 'happily', 'alive', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'included', 'interviews', 'and/or', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'Perhaps', 'season', 'one', 'well', 'enough', 'extra', 'features', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'second', 'season', 'nicely', 'rendered', 'release', 'Fox', 'fans', 'classic', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'are', 'sure', 'appreciate']",N/A
973205,A3AD071UEP20WS,B000EHSVB4,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[0, 9]","I didn't watch this show when it was originally on TV, so my comments are based solely on the DVDs.The scenery is pretty enough, a cattle ranch somewhere in northern California.  The Barkley family lives in what amounts to a fully appointed Victorian mansion.  Somehow it feels just a wee bit too well appointed.  One must assume that the fancy art objects and heavy Victorian furniture came by sailing vessel around Cape Horn before the Panama Canal.The actors are also pretty enough, especially Linda Evans.  In fact the actors seem to have been chosen for their ability to fill out tight trousers or form-fitting dresses, rather than thespian talent.  They and the cowhand extras all have extremely white and newly capped teeth.There is lots of action, lots and lots--gunfights and brawls and chases.  I've seen only a few episodes, but there is a long fistfight scene in each one.  The requisite number of chairs are broken and bottles crashed over heads--but no one gets a black eye or more that a slight, manly abrasion on the cheek.  Remarkable--and not like any fistfight I've ever seen in reality.The plots are not very realistic either, e.g., a cattle drive from northern California to San Diego, where the U.S. military is willing to pay a premium for beef.  Why not butcher the steers and ship the meat out of San Francisco, which was much closer?  What was the navy going to do with thousands of steers in San Diego?  Other plots are also not logical or well developed.Unfortunately most westerns, especially TV westerns, painted an unrealistic view of the actual west in the late 19th century.  I maintain that a truer portrait of the west would have been more interesting, if not so decorative as, say, the curvaceous Linda Evans in a tight dress with her freshly coiffed hairdo and dazzling white teeth.

There are scenes here that I've not seen in years!I've had most of the Big Valley episodes on tape from television.  Most of them are obviously edited, due to the commercials.  This is my favorite western series.  I am so glad they are releasing this!While I didn't grow up when the Big Valley was originally aired, I still watched it most mornings during the 70s-80s.  I tried Bonanza a few times, but found the Big Valley more appealing.  Barbara Stanwyck had even said, ""Our show is grittier and more realistic than Bonanza.  Our stories have to do with hardships and dangers of living in the west.""  Plus, the Barkley ranch is a cattle ranch...for real cowboys!Okay, first I have to mention my favorite western character.  I know Lee Majors (Heath) and Linda Evans (Audra) received much attention, but to my mind the ""perfect"" cowboy will always be Nick Barkley (Peter Breck).  It took most of Season 1 for them to really get his outfit down.  He first wears a small hat and not too-colorful outfit before changing to the large hat, brown shirts and black leather vest and gloves which will mark him as the ever-tempermental tough cowboy of the west.The series is about a matriarchal family living in Stockton, California.  While the famous Ponderosa may boast more land, the Barkley ranch, overall, probably boasted more wealth in all its business ventures from cattle to peach groves to mines and land.  The Barkley's were also renowned not only by the California government, but even in Mexico and other states.There is first son Jarrod, who prefers his law practice to sweating out in the hot sun taking care of the ranch.  He is often cool-headed and logical, preferring diplomatic approaches to more violent ones.  He's a wizard in the courtroom and he proves that he won't back down on a principal, no matter the cost.  Richard Long played this character beautifully.  Ever suave, Jarrod could be a hit with the women who liked is handsome, intelligent ways of doing things.  He is often at odds with Nick, as Jarrod prefers more diplomatic approaches to solving problems than the fist-a-cuffs of Nick.Middle son is Nick Barkley.  Nick is in charge of the ranch.  He has some 100 or so men to look after who help to maintain the ranch from cattle to blacksmithing, to taking care of the trees and horses.  He is fiery and tempermental, a complete opposite to his older brother, Jarrod.  Nick is passionate and will speak his mind no matter what anyone says or does.  Nick also loves a good fight, and he'll take on two or three men in a bar-room brawl, if necessary.  Especially sensitive to criticism of himself or his family, he is extremely protective.  Victoria quoted him once, ""When Nick is pushed he pushes back with everything he has.""  Peter Breck also incorporated Nick as a fierce and deadly gunman.  He was clocked at six-hundredths of a second on the draw by a western magazine that has him down as the fastest in television history.Youngest son is Heath who is actually a half-brother to the family.  He shares the same father, Tom Barkley, but a different mother.  Heath, in the pilot, storms the Barkley ranch after his mother dies to take what is his.  At first he gets more than he bargains for when Nick confronts him, suspecting Heath to be a spy for the railroad.  Heath's character lies between Jarrod and Nick.  He will fight when pushed, but he will also be more diplomatic as well.  He's often quiet and brooding in his demeanor.  Ironically, the person he's closest to his Victoria.  He also enjoys being with Nick, and the two of them share some great adventures throughout the series.  He also has a special affection for Audra, probably because they are both the youngest, and Audra is the first Barkley he comes across.  There are also more episodes involving Heath than any other character.  Lee Majors was a new-comer to acting and Barbara Stanwyck actually took the then young actor under her wing.  During the course of four/five seasons, you will see him really shape his character.  You'll also notice that his southern accent becomes much less distinct than in the first season.The Ponderosa never had a regular beauty on their show, but the Big Valley did!  Linda Evans, while not going to win over anyone with her acting, did so as far as eye-candy is concerned.  Linda was even quoted as saying, ""Believe me, I know why I'm on the show.""  As the feisty Audra, she plays a character who loves helping children and the poor, but she can also be fiery and tempermental.  She even says, ""Nick is the only one who understands me.""Last and certainly not least is Barbara Stanwyck as Victoria.  Barbara had already had a more than successful film career.  Loving the outdoors and the old west, Stanwyck tried for years to have a western, but the networks never believed anyone wanted to watch a female cowboy.  Then, the Big Valley came along.  For the first few episodes, she's stuck in beautiful dresses and pretty much inside the mansion.  Barbara had quickly approached the producers to set the record straight.  ""I'm not here to sit on couches and answer the door.""  She demanded that Victoria have some adventures of her own, and she certainly got her wish.  What's more her stories prove very effective as she often uses her mind to get out of a situation.  She's also not bad with a gun, so watch out!You will see so many future film stars and even current film stars of the day grace the Big Valley.  Many of the stories deal in business ventures, greedy landlords, gangs of bullies, Heath's battle to find a place as a bastard son, and so forth.The show also has, to me, one of the best themes in television history.  The very music cries of something big and epic as we follow this family on their adventures.The only reason I give this 4 stars is because it did take them some time to really settle in.  Seasons 2 and 3 are fantastic!Yes, the series will probably show its age since the mid to late sixties when it ran, but to me, this western T.V. show is timeless!",4,Yes!

973215,A3DRCZFQNCC4LW,B000EHSVB4,The Big RG,"[8, 8]","I was never a fan of the TV Westerns that seemed to dominate prime time television back in the 1960s when I was growing up.  I opted to watch such shows as ""The Flying Nun,"" ""That Girl,"" ""Family Affair, ""Laugh-In"" and ""The Avengers,"" to name a few, instead.  And while the grown-ups in the family may have chosen to watch ""Gunsmoke,"" ""High Chapparel,"" and ""Bonanza,"" ""The Big Valley"" was, unfortunately, overlooked in our household.  Throughout the 1970s and into my teens now, I'd come across reruns of ""The Big Valley"" and although I never watched, I always said this was a show I could probably get into if I ever gave it chance.Well, that chance finally came thirty years later when I caught a particular episode of ""The Big Valley"" on th E-Western channel on satellite a few weeks ago.  The show was so good that I decided to catch another episode the next day and liked that one just as much.  By the third episode I found myself hooked.  The Barkleys were far more appealing than Hoss and company, and they certainly didn't have a lovely female character such as Linda Evans who plays daughter Audra. So, I just had to place an order with Amazon and buy this Season One DVD set.  My set came a week ago and I've been watching TBV every chance I get.I'm in my mid 40s and this is truly the first Western TV series I have ever enjoyed.  The stories are great, the guest stars are A+, and most episodes leave me feeling really good or teary-eyed.  This family really cares about each other and they will risk their lives to save one another.I rated this four stars, however, because of the design of the DVD set itself.  There are 30 episodes on 5 double-sided discs, but none of them are marked except in very tiny lettering on towards the center of the disc.  So tiny that you have to squint to see what side is ""A"" and which side is ""B.""  That's just plain ridiculous; there's no reason to skimp on slapping some ink on the disc in large lettering so each DVD can be identified. Even Victoria Barkley wouldn't stand for this.Also, I am disappointed in the quality of the prints.  While they are not of dollar DVD picture quality, new prints should have been made so there would be more color. In my opinion there just seems to be a lack of true, vivid color throughout the show.  Either that or I am getting tired of seeing Nick wearing the same old brown vested outfit or Heath's yellow pants.I hope they will release a Season Two set of TBV but if they do, they need to give us some extras.  No true Barkley would ever pass up the opportunity to talk about the ongoings of the Barkley Ranch.  So how 'bout it powers-that-be?

When you catch up with the show as an adult you discover how bad it really was (I'm thinking of a great episode of ""Frasier"" where he discovers that a ""great"" actor (delightfully played by Derek Jacobi) Frasier admired as a kid is a horrible ham but doesn't discover it until he agrees to present a play with the actor in it. I've discovered that with shows I loved as a kid that are cheesy fun now but horrible drama.Luckily ""The Big Valley"" doesn't fit in that category.The show is as big, bold and fun as I remembered it from the larger than life opening title music to the marvelous performances from the entire cast. In the premiere episode Heath Barkley (Lee Majors)the bastard son of the scion of the Barkley clan goes to see widow Victoria Barkley (Barbara Stanwyck)to reveal that he is the long lost son of her husband. The family which includes the eldest Jarrod a lawyer (the late Richard Long), Nick the tough boss of the ranch (Peter Breck), daughter Audra (Linda Evans) and the youngest Eugene(who soon disappeared--he was drafted and didn't return to the showplayed by Charles Briles)is at first resistant to Heath's claims (especially Nick)buteventually accept him as one of the family.In fact Heath's first meeting with at least two of the Barkley clan is extremely unpleasant. Borrowing the first meeting from ""Robin Hood"" of Robin and Little John, Heath and Nick meet on a bridge across a river with passage for just one. Both refuse to back up and both end up quite wet in the process. Later when Heath goes to the grave of his father his half sister Audra hits him with her riding stick assuming that he's there to trample on her father's grave and destroy the fresh flowers she has just left behind. Heath impresses Nick and he hires on at the Barkley ranch before revealing to the family who he is and why he's there. Fireworks fly after this big confrontation scene. It's a great sequence well acted and directed.The show looks extremely good in this DVD set from Fox and includes all 30 episodes (luckily Fox chose NOT to break this up like they did some other TV shows on DVD). I do wish that Fox had enlisted Lee Majors, Peter Breck and Linda Evans to do a commentary track or two in this set. Also, it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the creation of the series and its reception by critics (particularly since it was aired while ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke"" were still in their prime). ""The Big Valley"" had a very different vibe from the other westerns. While all were well written I always felt that ""The Big Valley"" was the more adult of the westerns on TV.The set features five dual sided discs housed in slimline cases with the first four discs facing each other in the set. I'm hoping that they don't get scratched and I would have been willing to settle for single holders for each disc. Aside from that the complaints are few about this marvelous set and series.",4,I had forgotten how good this show was..,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,3073,"['watched', 'Big', 'Valley', 'summer', 'and/or', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Usually', 'memories', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'was/is', 'can', 'be', 'colored', 'experiences', 'When', 'catch', 'up', 'show', 'adult', 'discover', 'how', 'bad', 'really', 'was', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'great', 'episode', 'Frasier', 'where', 'great', 'actor', 'delightfully', 'played', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Frasier', 'admired', 'kid', 'horrible', 'ham', ""n't"", 'discover', 'present', 'play', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'shows', 'loved', 'kid', 'are', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'now', 'horrible', 'drama.Luckily', 'Big', 'Valley', ""n't"", 'fit', 'category.The', 'show', 'as', 'big', 'bold', 'fun', 'remembered', 'larger', 'life', 'opening', 'title', 'music', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Heath', 'Barkley', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'bastard', 'son', 'scion', 'Barkley', 'clan', 'see', 'widow', 'Victoria', 'Barkley', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'reveal', 'long', 'lost', 'son', 'husband', 'family', 'eldest', 'Jarrod', 'lawyer', 'late', 'Richard', 'Long', 'Nick', 'tough', 'boss', 'ranch', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'daughter', 'Audra', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'youngest', 'Eugene', 'who', 'soon', 'disappeared', 'was', 'drafted', 'did', ""n't"", 'return', 'showplayed', 'Charles', 'Briles', 'first', 'resistant', 'Heath', 'claims', 'especially', 'Nick', 'buteventually', 'accept', 'one', 'family.In', 'fact', 'Heath', 'first', 'meeting', 'least', 'two', 'Barkley', 'clan', 'extremely', 'unpleasant', 'Borrowing', 'first', 'meeting', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Robin', 'Little', 'John', 'Heath', 'Nick', 'meet', 'bridge', 'river', 'passage', 'just', 'one', 'refuse', 'back', 'up', 'end', 'up', 'quite', 'wet', 'process', 'Later', 'when', 'Heath', 'grave', 'father', 'half', 'sister', 'Audra', 'riding', 'stick', 'assuming', 'there', 'trample', 'father', 'grave', 'destroy', 'fresh', 'flowers', 'just', 'left', 'behind', 'Heath', 'Nick', 'Barkley', 'ranch', 'revealing', 'family', 'who', 'why', 'there', 'Fireworks', 'fly', 'big', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'great', 'sequence', 'well', 'acted', 'directed.The', 'show', 'extremely', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'Fox', '30', 'episodes', 'luckily', 'Fox', 'chose', 'NOT', 'break', 'up', 'did', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'do', 'wish', 'Fox', 'had', 'enlisted', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', 'set', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'featurette', 'discussing', 'creation', 'series', 'reception', 'critics', 'particularly', 'was', 'aired', 'Bonanza', 'Gunsmoke', 'were', 'still', 'prime', 'Big', 'Valley', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'vibe', 'other', 'westerns', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'always', 'felt', 'Big', 'Valley', 'was', 'more', 'adult', 'westerns', 'TV.The', 'set', 'features', 'five', 'dual', 'sided', 'discs', 'housed', 'slimline', 'cases', 'first', 'four', 'discs', 'facing', 'other', 'set', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'scratched', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'willing', 'settle', 'single', 'holders', 'disc', 'Aside', 'complaints', 'are', 'few', 'marvelous', 'set', 'series']",N/A
973220,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B000EHSVB4,William Smith,"[12, 14]","The Show:Judging by the first disc, (having never seen this show before, it was dropped from syndication in my area many years ago), so far, I would say this show is equal to that of Bonanza and that's no easy feat. Surprisingly, the subject matter is a bit jarring considering the time frame ('65-'66) The cast is just as strong as that of Bonanza, sadly it didn't have the same viewer shelf life (only four seasons). My favorite character is probably ""Jarrod Barkley"". If for no other reason than Richard Long is one of the most underrated actors of the sixties. His performances in ""The Twilight Zone"" have forever cemented him in my mind as a memorable face/s (see: Number 12 Looks Just Like You). While I love the ""Heath"" character (played by Lee Majors) I am not as impressed with the ""Audra"" character played by Linda Evans (though she is GOOD). Of course Barbara Stanwyck is gold and Peter Breck nicely rounds out the brooding big brother role (""Nick""). So far the guest stars have been as equally impressive. Quality guest stars in my mind, make the ""good"" shows great and the ""fair"" shows... forgotten. When the quality of a Warren Oates is merely ""routine"" you have a guaranteed WINNER. To think I even hesitated at buying this set, then again, how could I have ever assumed this show would be THIS good?Technical:The color is pretty vibrant, sadly there are often grains and artifacts. Sometimes, major lines which run throughout a scene, I suppose we should be grateful to even have this, still, interviews and cleaner transfers shouldn't be too much to ask. The sound is about on par with this time period and I have given up asking why Star Trek is the only 60's show to go 5.1 DD, that horse remains beaten.Price:Do the makers of these DVD sets know how much we WOULD pay to have these priceless treasures of our past? I wonder how many here take pause from time to time and imagine the age we are in currently. Complete boxsets for a fraction of what they are worth!! Some quick math; how can a 90 minute ""hit or miss"" movie be $20 or so, and a 1,532 minute (25.5 hours!) set of a TRUE classic TV series be only a fraction more than that price?Loose ends:They really went the extra mile with the packaging, pics, and episode description and for that I give kudos. I just love the sweeping scores from bonafide orchestras, it truly makes one realize how far we've fallen from TRUE classic television. If you've been stuck in the past, The Big Valley is a good way to remain there... with me:)",5,It's A Draw,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,2508,"['Show', 'Judging', 'first', 'disc', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'was', 'dropped', 'syndication', 'area', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'say', 'show', 'equal', 'Bonanza', 'easy', 'feat', 'Surprisingly', 'subject', 'matter', 'bit', 'jarring', 'considering', 'time', 'frame', ""'65-'66"", 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'Bonanza', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'viewer', 'shelf', 'life', 'only', 'four', 'seasons', 'favorite', 'character', 'probably', 'Jarrod', 'Barkley', 'other', 'reason', 'Richard', 'Long', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'sixties', 'performances', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'have', 'forever', 'cemented', 'mind', 'memorable', 'face/s', 'see', 'Number', '12', 'Looks', 'Just', 'love', 'Heath', 'character', 'played', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'am', 'not', 'impressed', 'Audra', 'character', 'played', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'GOOD', 'course', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'gold', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'nicely', 'out', 'brooding', 'big', 'brother', 'role', 'Nick', 'So', 'far', 'guest', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Quality', 'guest', 'stars', 'mind', 'make', 'good', 'great', 'fair', 'shows', 'forgotten', 'When', 'quality', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'merely', 'routine', 'have', 'guaranteed', 'WINNER', 'think', 'even', 'hesitated', 'buying', 'set', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'assumed', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'THIS', 'good', 'Technical', 'color', 'pretty', 'vibrant', 'sadly', 'are', 'often', 'grains', 'artifacts', 'Sometimes', 'major', 'lines', 'run', 'scene', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'even', 'have', 'still', 'interviews', 'cleaner', 'transfers', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'sound', 'par', 'time', 'period', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'asking', 'why', 'Star', 'Trek', 'only', '60', 'show', 'go', '5.1', 'DD', 'horse', 'beaten.Price', 'Do', 'makers', 'DVD', 'sets', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'WOULD', 'pay', 'have', 'priceless', 'treasures', 'past', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'here', 'take', 'pause', 'time', 'time', 'imagine', 'age', 'are', 'currently', 'Complete', 'boxsets', 'fraction', 'what', 'are', 'worth', 'quick', 'math', 'how', 'can', '90', 'minute', 'hit', 'miss', 'movie', 'be', '20', 'so', '1,532', 'minute', '25.5', 'hours', 'set', 'TRUE', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'be', 'only', 'fraction', 'more', 'price', 'Loose', 'ends', 'really', 'went', 'extra', 'mile', 'packaging', 'pics', 'episode', 'description', 'give', 'kudos', 'just', 'love', 'sweeping', 'scores', 'bonafide', 'orchestras', 'truly', 'one', 'realize', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'TRUE', 'classic', 'television', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stuck', 'past', 'Big', 'Valley', 'good', 'way', 'remain', 'there']",N/A
