I don't llike the teenage actors either, because they're pretty damn annoying(And the fact that a lot people I know are betting Zac Efron is gay).

Other documentaries can be produced, including such based on the successes of translating the movie to musicals in actual high schools.Overall, the movie is great for kids, but adults may be bored with the unoriginal, mostly single-level story.  The musical sections can be appreciated by all ages; however, the movie does suffer a bit from the casting challenge of finding kids who can sing well, have a nice voice, look attractive, and can act.

981641,A2QA095LQPDBJD,B000F2BNW2,Ariel Escasa,"[23, 38]","And if that title doesn't serve as sufficient warning of what sort of silliness this piece of fluff has in store for you, then maybe the opening scene should. At a New Year's Eve party, two youngsters are picked at random from among the crowd to sing a karaoke duet. They don't know each other. The guy is a varsity basketball player, the girl is a science geek, who wastes no time establishing her character by sitting by herself and reading a book - at a party. And guess what? They both sing well. Not just that, they're both good-looking. Talk about contrived openings. After the impromptu showstopper, they talk, get to know each other, discover their common love for music, and exchange phone numbers. Of course, the mutual attraction has begun. Yawn.From that point on, you may want to continue watching this movie in the hopes that it will get better. Trust me, it doesn't. It starts out bad, and it stays bad.The girl's geek friends tell her, and the guy's basketball teammates tell him, not to waste their time trying out for the musical. And they do it in song and dance. Duh... don't join a musical, they say, but they're in one. Creative license? No, it's just plain dumb. (I was almost expecting some equivalent of that Pirates of the Caribbean character to enter the scene and tell these kids, ""You better start believing in musicals. You're in one!"")And what exactly is the point of that ""Stick to the Status Quo"" number? So what if an athlete bakes, a skater plays the cello, and a geek girl likes hip-hop? Would their friends really go ""no, no, no, no!""? If anything, I imagine they would find these revelations interesting.The characters are as flat as pancakes. Funny how a movie that purports to be all about breaking stereotypes, being true to what you want to be, and not limiting yourself to what others expect of you, fails so miserably at at least making the characters interesting.Earlier-mentioned geek and baller not only pass the audition, they get the lead parts, over the school's two most frequent lead players, based on one song they sing at the callback. Excuse me, but shouldn't you show your acting and dancing prowess as well as your musical skills before you get the lead parts in a musical?The songs are mediocre at best. Nothing really jumps out at you the way songs in a musical should. Sure, they mostly have nice, bouncy, danceable tunes, but nothing here is particularly memorable. You don't find yourself humming any of the songs after viewing the movie.The ending is even more contrived than the beginning. In fact, it's so bad, it's sickening. Hey, let's all be friends now, we're all in this together. Ugh.And please don't tell me, hey, lighten up, it's a movie for kids, etc., etc. That's no excuse for shoddy storytelling, scripting, characterization, songwriting and acting. Look at Disney's past theatrical releases: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and Tarzan are just a few of the made-for-kids Disney films that adults can enjoy. Why? Because they had good stories, good scripts, good songs, and good characters. You won't find any of these in HSM.My recommendation: skip this trash.

981652,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000F2BNW2,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[4, 7]","I feel a little cruel picking on something so pure of heart. They just want you to be yourself (especially if you can do so while singing and dancing) and have a great time while you're at it. But this is some pretty hokey stuff right here. The characters are nothing more than plastic rich kids who have no personality. One wears a pink beret (while simultaneously being male). Another carries a basketball with him wherever he goes like this is some kind of Bazooka Joe comic or something. Their idea of a problem is being too smart, or having to survive the dreaded 15 minute detention. The musical numbers feel taken straight off of Broadway only with a little high school flavoring added to them. One uses bouncing basketballs as music and another takes place in a cafeteria. The film itself can't be considered good even though it really tries, the cheese factor is just too overwhelming in this case.Their points are very noble. They start off by teaching kids that being smart is more valuable than being pretty, but who is really gonna listen to that one? Then in movies into another overarching theme which says that the status quo should be bunked in favor of your true desires. That's all fine and good but we all know that peer mockery trumps Disney Channel morality any day of the week. Our main characters are Troy and Gabriella, a jock and a nerd respectively, who both secretly pine for the glory of theater. But since kids these days have taken a real liking to passing judgment their classmates are constantly obstructing their way to this goal. And even though the movie is about high school theater it is in no way a love letter. The theater teacher is a crazy old bat who spends her days spouting nonsense and turning detention into her own little forced labor camp. Then there is Sharpay and Ryan, a brother sister duo, who take the idea of lame drama geeks to a whole new high. Of course they are so over the top in their love of theater only to make Troy and Gabriella, also theater geeks, look normal by comparison but it doesn't totally wash. The performances here are all good but my guess is that these poor actors will be embarrassed by this later in life.The singing itself was somewhat detrimental in my opinion.  Their voices were all so angelic and flawless that I kept hoping for a Tom Waits cameo. It was all just too much. The school spirit was so off the charts that it had me groaning. The ending was too perfect. The boys were a little too hairless. I would also like to state that the ""Punk'd"" joke they went for was a total miss and performed soooo much better in ""Just Friends."" I can't muster any anger towards the film because it was exactly what I expected. A morality play with song and dance and not much budget that hopes to overwhelm you with silliness to the point where you just get used to it and surrender. The sensation that it caused is why I saw it, but even after seeing it I still don't understand what all the fuss is about.

Yes, as some critics complain, it's nothing extremely original. But who really cares?? It may not be some great mind teaser of a story but it has all the qualities I love. Music, Fun, Wholesome and Romance.A lot of the interviews have made such comments as ""If you've got a kid in the house you've probably heard of High School Musical."" There are no kids in my house and I LOVE this movie. Funny thing was, I had no desire to see it when I saw a trailer for it back in November. In fact, I so did NOT want to see it. I thought it was just another way for Disney to feature some new singer I'd never heard of that they were supporting. Then the weeks went by and I didn't hear much more about it, as I don't watch Disney Channel much. Then one night (Jan. 20th to be exact) I was lounging at home and saw another preview. I thought, ""What the heck. I'll give it a whirl."" I've been addicted ever since. Pathetically so. I've seen it too many times to count (but it's way more than six). I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was available again (having previously sold out) and I listen to it all the time. And usually by this point the music would have gotten old for me but not with HSM. My family and friends know it as my latest obsession and probably know more stats (ratings, cd sales, etc.) than they ever cared for.I love the movie. I love the music. I'm counting the days until the DVD comes out AND the release of the second movie (which sadly isn't going to be until early next year). If you haven't seen it, DO! Turn on Disney Channel, borrow a copy from a friend. Anything! Show your support!

What I found was a very light-hearted and delightful FAMILY musical, yes musical, with very catchy tunes along with a slim but agreeable storyline.  Somewhat similar to Grease but not as greasy!  At least all the teenagers are played by actors ~18-20 years old (wasn't Rizzo around 35?:)!Who said musicals are dead?  It took Disney and a DCOM movie to prove the format CAN & SHOULD be done again.  And speaking of catchy tunes, I can't get the darn ""Breaking Free"" song out of my mind.From a technical standpoint, as Disney filmed this movie in  1.78:1 aspect ratio, I'm super sorry that Disney didn't release either DVD releases in an anamorphic widescreen format.  Think of all the extra money they could have extorted from the buying public by offering both FF (YUCK) & WS.

Hopefully, though, they'll realize that by the time they get to High School, their school teams will win very few games, they won't be guaranteed the lead in the school musiCAL, or a cute boyfriend.The songs are so obnoxious- imagine Grease. Now, part of Grease is that's practically about real life- mixed up relationships, drugs, sex, alcohol, and cliques. HSM has relationships and cliques, but it isn't anywhere close enough to buoy the movie.Take ""The Start of Something New."" What a horrid way to start a movie!! Take a cute guy and he can sing (this in itself is a rarity) and add a smart girl who is a total floozy (honestly, I swore I could see straight through her) and voila! What else!! They fall in love during a magical karoke song!!Plus, as a devout theatre participant, I must denounce the entire audition. Not only are Sharpay and Ryan obnoxious, exagerated, and unrealistic, two people would never push around the director or screenwriter that way because directors will always, always look for people they personally want to work with.Plus, it is absolutely inconceivable that there are 2 drama club participants who can sing well.

981671,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000F2BNW2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, Disney Channel's 2006 original made-for-tv film, took kidnation by storm and made overnight stars out of Zac Efron and Vannesa Anne Hudgens. It also spawned a humongously successful TV movie sequel (High School Musical 2 (Extended Edition)), and there's word that the third flick will be theatrically released. So what is it about HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL? It's sure cheesy enough and the plot couldn't be more on the beaten path. Well, for me, the movie's exuberance and the engaging leads are what sold it. Turns out I'm not so jaded that I can't be swayed and won over by youthful enthusiasm and energetic performances. And, yikes, this one's a musical.The plot? During vacation, on New Year's Eve, basketball jock Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and the brilliant, bookish Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) meet at a teen party, forced to sing a karaoke duet together, and end up exchanging phone numbers. Then, for Troy, it's back to school at Albuquerque, New Mexico's East High.But it turns out that Gabriella is East High School's newest student. So, a week after their duet, the two meet again and their interest in music and in each other is renewed. And there's a school winter musical looking for new blood. Do Troy and Gabriella sign up? Doing so would mean breaking out of their respective cliques and fracturing the school's status quo. Troy's with the jock crowd, with a big game in 2 weeks as the EHS Wildcats play for the championship. Gabriella is with the brainy set and expected to compete in the scholastic decathlon. As the song goes, as chorused overwhelmingly by the student body: ""No, no, no - stick to the stuff you know."" But, it turns out, what Troy and Gabriella know best is following their hearts. And singing.HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is kid stuff, sure, served up with a bland, run-of-the-mill storyline, and with the usual messages of individuality and following your dreams wholesomely spoonfed to the audience. But it's all executed with a certain vitality and is so darn winning that even creaky, old dogs like me surrender under its spell. HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is as family friendly as it gets, about as objectionable as a brown-eyed puppy. Efron and Hudgens are sweet together and are most assuredly the biggest reason for Disney's newest monster franchise. Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay) and Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) shouldn't be left out as their sister-brother act is darn sidesplitting.And most of the songs are pretty catchy. Certainly, tons of fans have propelled the film's soundtrack to the Billboard chart stratosphere.  I'll probably forget these tunes in a week or so, but for now, I've been at it nonstop, humming ""Breaking Free,"" ""Stick to the Status Quo,"" and ""I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You."" This last song, by the way, is busted out merrily by Efron, Hudgens, Tisdale, and Grabeel (who shows off his chops here) in the dvd's bonus music video.I also like this movie for the fact that it came out of nowhere to become a phenomenon. The Disney Channel certainly didn't expect all this hubbub at first. But in HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, we have star turning performances, unbridled, bubbly enthusiasm, and a certain generic charm - all combining to form this happy synergy. And, who knows, just maybe Walt Disney even gave his blessing from his cryogenic chamber. But there's simply no denying that this movie is a bonafide sensation and speedily becoming an unstoppable force. Me, well, color me a fan. And, to demonstrate solidarity, I'll echo the kids at East High: ""Wildcats, everywhere!""",4,"""What spell has this elevated I.Q. temptress girl cast that suddenly makes you want to be in a musical?""",1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,3538,"['HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'Disney', 'Channel', '2006', 'original', 'made-for-tv', 'film', 'took', 'kidnation', 'storm', 'made', 'overnight', 'stars', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Vannesa', 'Anne', 'Hudgens', 'also', 'spawned', 'humongously', 'successful', 'TV', 'movie', 'sequel', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '2', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'word', 'third', 'flick', 'will', 'be', 'theatrically', 'released', 'what', 'about', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'sure', 'cheesy', 'enough', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'beaten', 'path', 'Well', 'movie', 'exuberance', 'engaging', 'leads', 'are', 'what', 'sold', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'jaded', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'swayed', 'won', 'over', 'youthful', 'enthusiasm', 'energetic', 'performances', 'yikes', 'one', 'musical.The', 'plot', 'vacation', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'basketball', 'jock', 'Troy', 'Bolton', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'brilliant', 'bookish', 'Gabriella', 'Montez', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'Hudgens', 'meet', 'teen', 'party', 'forced', 'sing', 'karaoke', 'duet', 'together', 'end', 'up', 'exchanging', 'phone', 'numbers', 'Then', 'Troy', 'back', 'school', 'Albuquerque', 'New', 'Mexico', 'East', 'High.But', 'out', 'Gabriella', 'East', 'High', 'School', 'newest', 'student', 'So', 'week', 'duet', 'two', 'meet', 'again', 'interest', 'music', 'other', 'renewed', 'school', 'winter', 'musical', 'looking', 'new', 'blood', 'Do', 'Troy', 'Gabriella', 'sign', 'up', 'Doing', 'so', 'would', 'mean', 'breaking', 'respective', 'cliques', 'fracturing', 'school', 'status', 'quo', 'Troy', 'jock', 'crowd', 'big', 'game', '2', 'weeks', 'EHS', 'Wildcats', 'play', 'championship', 'Gabriella', 'brainy', 'set', 'expected', 'compete', 'scholastic', 'decathlon', 'song', 'chorused', 'overwhelmingly', 'student', 'body', 'No', 'stick', 'stuff', 'know', 'out', 'what', 'Troy', 'Gabriella', 'know', 'best', 'following', 'hearts', 'singing.HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'kid', 'stuff', 'sure', 'served', 'up', 'bland', 'run-of-the-mill', 'storyline', 'usual', 'messages', 'individuality', 'following', 'dreams', 'wholesomely', 'spoonfed', 'audience', 'executed', 'certain', 'vitality', 'so', 'darn', 'winning', 'even', 'creaky', 'old', 'dogs', 'surrender', 'spell', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'family', 'friendly', 'about', 'as', 'objectionable', 'brown-eyed', 'puppy', 'Efron', 'Hudgens', 'are', 'sweet', 'together', 'are', 'most', 'assuredly', 'biggest', 'reason', 'Disney', 'newest', 'monster', 'franchise', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'Sharpay', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', 'Ryan', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'out', 'sister-brother', 'act', 'darn', 'sidesplitting.And', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'Certainly', 'tons', 'fans', 'have', 'propelled', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Billboard', 'chart', 'stratosphere', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'forget', 'tunes', 'week', 'so', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nonstop', 'humming', 'Breaking', 'Free', 'Stick', 'Status', 'Quo', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Off', 'last', 'song', 'way', 'busted', 'out', 'merrily', 'Efron', 'Hudgens', 'Tisdale', 'Grabeel', 'who', 'chops', 'here', 'dvd', 'bonus', 'music', 'video.I', 'also', 'movie', 'fact', 'came', 'nowhere', 'become', 'phenomenon', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hubbub', 'first', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'have', 'star', 'turning', 'performances', 'unbridled', 'bubbly', 'enthusiasm', 'certain', 'generic', 'charm', 'combining', 'form', 'happy', 'synergy', 'who', 'just', 'maybe', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'even', 'gave', 'blessing', 'cryogenic', 'chamber', 'simply', 'denying', 'movie', 'bonafide', 'sensation', 'speedily', 'becoming', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'Me', 'well', 'color', 'fan', 'demonstrate', 'solidarity', ""'ll"", 'echo', 'kids', 'East', 'High', 'Wildcats', 'everywhere']",High School Musical

981684,A37YV9UH4XETA2,B000F2BNW2,John C. Kunich,"[9, 10]","This film should have been a major theatrical release. The music is that good, and the performances by the young but highly talented cast are uniformly superb, led by the amazing Ashley Tisdale. From Les Miserables to High School Musical by age 20, she is a Broadway prodigy in a class by herself.As a composer/librettist of Broadway musicals myself (""Marva!"", a musical play about famed inner-city educator Marva Collins), I can appreciate the extraordinary combination of effort it required to make High School Musical into the splendid production it is. All of the songs are first-rate, but ""We're All In This Together,"" ""Stick to the Status Quo,"" and ""Get 'Cha Head In The Game"" are particular standouts. You'll find yourself singing them endlessly.There are good reasons why the musical recording of this film is the first television soundtrack album to top the Albums Chart in twenty years. Those reasons are the songs. They are uniformly melodic, intelligent, and professional--rare qualities in today's music scene. I cannot recall any other album that actually made me wish that many of the tunes had been of longer duration! Several of the excellent numbers on High School Musical are only 2 minutes long or less, yet pack an enormous amount of heart and quality into every one of those few seconds. What a contrast to most recordings, where a bare minimum of musical and lyrical ideas are stretched, prolonged with preludes, repeated, and repeated again to make up for the almost total absence of substance!The ""Stick to the Status Quo"" song warrants special mention because it brilliantly captures the reality of high school peer pressure within the context of an engaging large-cast production dance number. Who has experienced high school without feeling the stifling impetus to remain within rigidly defined boundaries of behavior, dress, and attitude? This song illustrates the foolishness of such self-imposed censorship without preaching, and is all the more a triumph because of that subtlety. If an athlete can bake, and a scholar can be into hip-hop, maybe there's hope for all of us.It would be inaccurate to pigeon-hole this as a ""message movie,"" notwithstanding the worthy subtext of tolerance, individuality, and inclusion.  This film does not overemphasize or exaggerate its theme.  Rather, it is seamlessly woven into the overall fabric of the entertainment.  In the same way, racial and gender equality and diversity are not spotlighted as obvious morals, like they might have been in a lesser work.  Instead, these principles are taken for granted as givens in the lives of these young people, who never would think to question whether it is appropriate for people of different races to date, or whether females can be the most accomplished scientists and mathematicians around.  The film is much more effective in conveying these noble messages because of the subtlety with which it handles them as part of the unquestioned structure of modern life.The musical-within-a-musical approach works well, too, because it makes room for a wide range of song styles, including a parody of the old Donnie & Marie Osmond song and dance shtick and a hot salsa number, ""Bop to the Top,"" which is catchier than virtually any hit single within recent memory. These infectious yet funny numbers are nicely interspersed with the songs that are part of the main story as sung extemporaneously by the characters. And the wonderful high-energy choreography by the great Kenny Ortega is breathtaking, particularly in group-dance songs such as ""Get 'Cha Head in the Game"" and ""Stick to the Status Quo.""My daughter and I watched this movie without fail, every time it was broadcast on the Disney Channel.  As a result, I can testify from personal experience that it holds up well under repeated viewing, and I do mean repeated.  Because of the wonderful combination of song, dance, romance, humor, and inspiration this motion picture always seems fresh, even after many viewings.  I believe ""High School Musical"" will transform popular culture in a highly positive direction, moving a new generation of young people toward a much broader appetite for music, dance, and drama.  It will preserve the genre of melodic book musical for many years, at a point when its future appeared precarious at best.  No one could have predicted this impact in advance, but now it seems clear.

This is the movie that started it all. It you love upbeat music and fun movies then High School Musical is for you.Short Summary...Troy meets Gabriella while vacationing with his family over the holidays. They sing a duet together. When he gets back to East High he notices that Gabriella has been transferred to his school. They are both excited to see each other since they have a crush on each other. Troy being the basketball star can't let his friends know that he sung with Gabriella over Winter Break so he tries to keep it a secret. Gabriella talks Troy into doing the Spring Musical with her only to find himself in a predictament...basketball or theater. Troy's teammates find out that Troy is doing the musical and they are not happy especially Chad (his best friend and teammate). However the jealous Sharpay has other plans for the couple. She has a crush on Troy so she tries to eliminate Gabriella. She changes the date of the musical to the same day as the basketball championship game. What is Troy going to do now? Watch the movie to see if Troy chooses Gabriella or Sharpay and to see if Troy chooses theater or basketball.This is a great movie for any age. I am an adult and I absolutely LOVE the High School Musical trilogy. Go out and buy the movies today.

Too bad it wasn't in theatres as it is really good for all ages despite being tagged as for the tweens (teens & those in their 20's). It is reminiscent of Grease from the 70's but is completely clean in every way. The music is also very good and you'll find yourself singing along. I guess that's why they came out with the karaoke version! If you love music and romantic movies, this film is for you!Two teens come together through music even though they seem to be on opposite sides of the social spectrum. He's the captain of the basketball team & coach's son, and she's a shy Math & Science whiz. They are thrown together to sing at a New Year's Eve party, and then find they are at the same school in the new year. They come to have feelings for each other and together try out for the school musical. Zac Efron really does an outstanding acting and singing job in this movie, and I can understand why he is a top teen star right now. Vanessa Anne Hudgens is also very good in her role. The romance between the 2 characters is light and very sweet. There are so many romantic moments that you will want to play over and over again. I especially love the part when he sings for her. There are some good messages in this film such as following your dreams and not worrying about what other kids think of you. It deals with peer pressure and how the two teens need to pursue their dreams despite the interference from their friends.I see that a sequel to this movie will be made soon.

981696,A2HJPB009SGOCH,B000F2BNW2,"Kori A. Slater ""KORI SLATER""","[5, 9]","At first I was completely opposed to watching this. All of my friends loved it, and at my school you could hear all of my sixth grade classmates singing the songs. Maybe it was the fact that the songs were so chessy, or maybe it was the fact that my friends are terrible singers, but I really didn't want to watch this movie.However, on a trip to Eagle River to see my friend, I realized that maybe there was more to the movie than meets the eye. Because I trust my friend's judgement in movies, and she raved about HSM, I decided to give it a try.So, maybe it wasn't the most magical experience. However, I was glad that Disney was at least trying now. I liked the concept of it. I was glad that there was finally a fun-for-everyone movie that talked about peer pressure.But it wasn't all fun. I have a few complaints:1) Who the heck decided to cast Vanessa Hudgens? Can you say slut? Also, she's not a very good actor. Maybe she just doesn't know how to do geeky, but she really bombed in HSM. Where did the girl from Thirteen go?2) The wardrobe. I mean, the geeks dressed like the jocks and popular kids. That's not how it is. I'm not saying that you should stereotype them, I'm just saying that you should try to make each individual character have an individual wardrobe. And the popular kids wear Abercrombie and Fitch, not nerdy shirts with green stripes. Come on. Disney, at least put SOME imagination into it.3) The lack of realism. I understand that they were trying to do a remake of Grease. It it ain't broke, don't fix it. Grease is unremakable. Especially not by Disney, and especially not with Vanessa Hudgens. I mean, boy meets giirl at party, then must they fall in love without even talking for more than two seconds, and then they must part. Tragic, right? I'm not finished. Poof! Boy and girl end up in same school. Then they sing their problems away and everything falls into place perfectly. GAG! If this movie had been set in junior high, then it would have believable. In junior high, kids care a lot about these kinds of things. In junior high, differences are deadly. But by the time kids reach high school, they're matured and okay with differences.4) The songs. There were three of them that I hated: The Start of Something New, Getcha Head In The Game, and We're All In This Together. I didn't like The Start of Something New, because like the other reviewer, I also noticed that they didn't have to look at the screen as they sang. Blooper alert! Plus. I know that as you sing you get confidence, but going from shy and timid to, basically, stripping in a matter of seconds is rediculous. I didn't like Getcha Head in the Game because Zac Efron looks totally gay. Literally. I expected him to start singing I'm A Barbie Girl any second. I didn't like We're All in This Together period. Because we're not all in this together. We're all in this separately, with no help and no guidance.But even with that list of complaints, I do have some good things to say. Zac Efron did a wonderful job in his role as Troy. He's good with the dramatic parts, and he has great comedic timing. Also, whoever casted Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay is a genious! She was fantastic as the mean girl. And I liked Lucas Grabeel as Ryan. He was good at being in Sharpay's shadow, while secretly shining on his own. Plus, I loved the song Stick to the Status Quo. However, like I said before, this song would be better placed in junior high.

There will be the movie we saw on Disney and the Sing Along version as well.  I cannot believe all of the special features that are going to be on the DVD as well.Zac Efron is SUPERB as basketball supter-star Troy Bolton.  He is a great actor and has a great voice as well.  Vanessa Anne Hudgens, who portrays Gabriella Montez, the ""freaky math girl"" as she puts it in the movie has a gorgeous voice!  Ashley Tisdale (Maddie from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody) plays the villain Sharpay Evans so well.  In real life, Ashley is anything but evil, but it does not show in the movie.  Her voice is great as is her acting.  Lucas Grabeel portrays Sharpay's twin brother Ryan Evans, the guy who brings a lot of the comedy to the movie.  Corbin Bleu (Chad Danforth) and Monique Colman (Taylor McKessie) also co-star in this movie as the friends of the main characters.I will admit that I am much older than many of the people who watched the movie; I'm almost 25, but this movie connects to anyone!

Also, they once treated us to a little screening of the third sequel a few years later, and I found myself in a room of girls singing along with the musical numbers and also a bunch of boys just sitting along and watching it. I sang along, but basically only because I didn't really know why everyone else was singing. Looking back on it, I can only agree with myself for loathing it; ""High School Musical"" seems even cheesier when you realize the premise of high school students breaking into song over every miniscule moment of their lives.

Even if you did love Beyonce? Yes, its a good film, but you probably would NOT want to watch that movie again. To me, that is the true hallmark of a musical that transcends its material to become almost legendary, and I think this is why ""High School Musical"" has been so successful.I have friends who are children, and friends over 40 who all know the words to all the songs here. And with good reason! Granted, none of this is exactly earth shattering music - in fact, most of it is good old fashioned cheesy pop music of the ""Hannah Montana"" variety (a bit more polished though). But its simple lyrics and singalong choruses will win you over. I can't wait to see this at a Karaoke theater - this was one movie where I knew the words to most of the songs by the third viewing!The highlight of this film is the music. I am not a Zac Efron fan, and frankly I found him a bit bizarre looking (some of my friends thinks he looks like a 50 year old woman in drag, but thats a bit extreme), but once I got past that, I found lovable characters almost everywhere. Vanessa Hudgens is a real find. How wonderful that they cast a Hispanic actress to play Gabriella.To me, the real star of the show was the brother-sister duo of Ryan and Sharpay. Lucas Grabeel is absolutely breathtaking as the singing and dancing boy wonder with an atrocious fashion sense (is his character supposed to be this flamboyant? - it left me wondering), and Ashley Tisdale does an impression of Alicia Silverstone in ""Clueless"" that left me laughing for more. Her one-liners were the best.Heres the thing, this is not ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Benhur"".

To us, it is the modern day ""Grease"" - full of energetic songs and dances, and a lovely budding romance between the hero and heroine.  Teenagers love it because of it is a movie of their generation - high school ups and downs, friendship, and modern day angst (but in a very PG way).In short, see this movie.

And answered themselves with, ""Why bother?""The good stuff was, sort of, in the details. The Gabriella character has a single mother who is not an interfering harridan, they are hispanic without living in poverty, and the principal is Asian without making a huge deal about it.  There are some interracial romances that are nicely handled.  There's a cute little song about defying convention.  But we mustn't get TOO proactive, and the principals are all pretty bland conventions.  The black characters are only supporting cast.  The smart girl who likes hip hop and is plus size has about three lines--we couldn't have anyone but the beauty queen get the hunk, could we?The songs were catchy without being any good. I never, ever want to hear Vanessa Hudgens sing again (or whoever was singing). And her acting was awful--maybe it'll get better as she gets older, but from the very first scene where she is supposed to be shy--she looks as though she is taking direction, ""You're shy, put your head down!""  So she looks like a confident girl with her head down.And everything--and I do mean EVERYthing--resolves in the end. They win the championship, AND the academic bowl, AND the good guys get the leads in the musical (without ever actually reading for the parts, I might add)and the stuck up girl accepts a date with the guy that likes to cook.Oh, dear, was that a spoiler??It's a cute little movie that I'll let my 8 year old watch and she can feel she's a part of an older culture.

981705,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000F2BNW2,Mark Baker,"[37, 47]","It's New Year's Eve when Troy (Zac Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) meet.  They're picked at random from the crowd attending a teen party at a ski lodge to sign a karaoke song.  To their surprise, they actually sound great together and the sparks begin to fly.Returning from vacation, Gabriella is starting at a new school.  She's hoping to shed her geeky girl image.  On her first day, she runs into Troy, who is the captain of the basketball team at her new school.  He's busy getting ready for the upcoming playoffs against their rival school.In the back of their minds is the magic that happened when they sang together.  The sign ups for the school's winter musicale have been posted, and both of them are tempted to sign up.  Of course, that means Troy would have to face his friends, who think he should be focusing all of his time on basketball.  And Gabriella would have to deal with Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) who, along with her brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), is always the star of the school programs.  Is it worth the potential social upheaval to audition?This Disney Channel Original Movie has been getting lots of buzz, and for a very good reason.  It had been on for about five minutes before I got a smile on my face, and the smile didn't leave until the movie was over.  The story is fairly predictable, but the movie is lots of fun and the songs are great.Instead of doing traditional Broadway type songs, the music here is pop.  Of course, this works well with the intended audience of pre-teens and early teens.  They even work in a hip-hop song and a salsa song to spice things up a little.  About half the songs in this movie are auditions for the winter musicale, and they are very appropriate to the storyline.  This actually starts with the karaoke song that Troy and Gabriella sing at the beginning ""Start of Something New.""  For the climax, Sharpay and Ryan sing ""Bop to the Top"" which talks about getting to the top no matter what while our heroes sing ""Breaking Free,"" a song about their desire to break out of the molds they are in.The actors do a great job with their roles.  Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens are especially great as the leads.  There is a real chemistry between them that makes all their scenes so believable.  I was a little annoyed by the over the top acting of Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay and Alyson Reed as the drama teacher.  I know it was done on purpose, but I could have done with out it.  Over all, it was a minor complaint.The DVD features two versions of the movie.  One is the regular film, but the other is the sing along edition that features the words to the songs at the bottom of the screen.  The other features are ok.  There are two music videos, a very brief behind the scenes featurette, and a ""Learn the Moves"" featurette that sort of teaches you a part of the dancing from ""Bop to the Top.""While most of the bonus features aren't worth getting excited about, the movie itself is great fun.

It was originally a TV movie on the Disney channel, and proved so popular on its premiere broadcast that it attracted 7.7 million viewers. It was requested many times afterwards, and got released on DVD. I got it for my Christmas - thinking it might be good - only for it to appear on terrestrial TV a couple of days after. Dammit!I just don't think High School Musical will have the longevity of Grease or any of the older movies, but will thankfully beat that appalling Get Over It, from a few years ago. The movie is good, but there's nothing new. It's all been done before, and when you're an early 20something like me, you know you've seen it all before. There's no romance amongst the two leads, Zac Efron & Vanessa Anne Hudgens, a small peck on the cheek and that's it. Guess I'm expecting too much from a Disney movie!Vanessa Anne Hudgens already has an album out in America, it will probably be out in the UK soon if not already, to cash in on the film itself. However, I was disappointed to learn that it's not actually Zac Efron singing, although I knew something was up, cos he sounded totally different speaking to singing. The singing voice was actually Andrew Seeley, who was also considered for the role. He sang the entirety of ""Get'cha Head in the Game"" (the worst song of the movie) and the reprise of ""What I've Been Looking For"". Zac only truly sings the first four sentences of ""Start of Something New"", the first sentence of ""Breaking Free"", and during the scene on the balcony. The reason for this is because his natural voice is too low for that of a tenor and the producers preferred a tenor to match the role.My favourite character was Kelsie, the pianist. She was the comedic character throughout, and was just funny to watch, and her reveal at the end, was unexpected.As to be expected, the script wasn't that great, there wasn't much to work with, and everything was choreographed to within an inch of its life. Even when they weren't dancing.

There were bits and pieces from all kinds of other books and plays.  The balcony scene REEKED of Romeo & Juliet, but without the nice words and metaphors.The music wasn't bad, and the singing wasn't either.  Still, the dances were so awful that it took away from the effect.  I was surprised when I heard people at my school singing ""We're Flying"" in school because I thought that nobody would ever see that movie (I only watched it b/c I was bbsitting that night and she wanted to watch it).This movie isn't for anyone who isn't already in High School.  like most awful Disney productions, it is so stereotypical that I think many kids would be afraid of high school.  The nasty teacheris WAY too overdone.  If anyone can show me that kind of teacher in a public school I'll immediately write a letter to the principle.  The ""Status Quo"" song was the worst stereotype of all.  The fat, smart kids sitting at a lunch table doing homework together and not dancing is NOT TRUE!!! I wish young(er) people knew that this is a load of cr*p and that life isn't like this.I would never pay money for the movie.  For a CD, maybe, but never for an actual movie.

I'm personally just a bit confused as to why and feel that these people need an intervention involving ANY classic musical , a title that this will NEVER recieve. and i mean any musical, even the classic animated disney films would serve quite nicely since this is time for a diar help.this ""musical"" has many problems strting with, well the music. it is lacluster at best, and even modern pop acts would never perform this fluff. the songs hold no weight or meaning and fail to advance the story, the only character traits they reveal we already knew! the truely disturbing thing is that the music may be the best part! the story line is absurdity captured on film. anyone who thinks this represents high school should go back, or wait to get there. the drama kids, jocks and ""nerds"" are all nice, and no one cares about cliques and *gasp* singing in the musical. also, how is it high school musical if we only see the audition process, much more goes into a musical production. that could have been used to flesh out the film, but i guess that's what sequels are for, and i'm guessing we'll be tortured with one or eighteen knowing disney chanel. as for a side note, how did the two that were less talented get the parts? sharpay and ryan were far better, but troy and gabriella got the parts. WTF?!then there's the element of them bursting into song, hey i've got no problem with musicals. phantom of the opera is probably my favorite movie, but with HSM, we never learn why the singers are singing. at first it seems deliberate and conceous with early songs like ""start of something new"", but by ""get'cha head in the game"", it seems like they are just singing and that should be normal, which is also fine. the writters just needed to pick one method. (the really screwing thing is that that phantom uses both methods but actually makes it work.) the acting is also way over exagerated through most of the film, and the singing talents are far less than sub-par. the voices and songs all sound like useless pop songs from the late 1990's (not exactly the mark of a classic). i just don't understand why everyone is so enamored with this lovely little piece of trash which should have debuted, and dissapeared.PS i really don't get how this can get emmy nominations for everything from direction to choreography to outstanding music and lyrics, did the acadamy hear the lyrics!! but the truely scary part is phantom was more or less snubbed at the oscars, but at least phantom of the opera will remain a timelss clasic musical, while high school musical will just be forgotten, god willing.and for all the parents that think this is so great for their kids, stereotypes are NEVER good, and that's all the characters are. if you want good clean fun, just get them old disney moveies, it worked for the rest of us!!",1,i'm really confused,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,2874,"['everyone', 'who', 'been', 'raving', 'film', ""'m"", 'personally', 'just', 'bit', 'confused', 'why', 'feel', 'people', 'need', 'intervention', 'involving', 'ANY', 'classic', 'musical', 'title', 'will', 'NEVER', 'recieve', 'i', 'mean', 'musical', 'even', 'classic', 'animated', 'disney', 'films', 'would', 'serve', 'quite', 'nicely', 'time', 'diar', 'help.this', 'musical', 'many', 'problems', 'strting', 'well', 'music', 'lacluster', 'best', 'even', 'modern', 'pop', 'acts', 'would', 'never', 'perform', 'fluff', 'songs', 'hold', 'weight', 'meaning', 'fail', 'advance', 'story', 'only', 'character', 'traits', 'reveal', 'already', 'knew', 'truely', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'absurdity', 'captured', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'wait', 'get', 'there', 'drama', 'kids', 'jocks', 'nerds', 'are', 'nice', 'one', 'cliques', '*gasp*', 'singing', 'musical', 'also', 'how', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'only', 'see', 'audition', 'process', 'much', 'more', 'musical', 'production', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'flesh', 'out', 'film', 'i', 'guess', 'what', 'sequels', 'are', 'i', ""'m"", 'guessing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tortured', 'one', 'eighteen', 'knowing', 'disney', 'chanel', 'side', 'note', 'how', 'did', 'two', 'were', 'less', 'talented', 'get', 'parts', 'sharpay', 'ryan', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'troy', 'gabriella', 'got', 'parts', 'WTF', 'then', 'element', 'bursting', 'song', 'hey', 'i', ""'ve"", 'got', 'problem', 'musicals', 'phantom', 'opera', 'probably', 'favorite', 'movie', 'HSM', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'singers', 'are', 'singing', 'first', 'deliberate', 'conceous', 'early', 'songs', 'start', 'something', 'new', ""get'cha"", 'head', 'game', 'are', 'just', 'singing', 'should', 'be', 'normal', 'also', 'fine', 'writters', 'just', 'needed', 'pick', 'one', 'method', 'really', 'screwing', 'thing', 'phantom', 'methods', 'actually', 'work', 'acting', 'also', 'way', 'exagerated', 'most', 'film', 'singing', 'talents', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'sub-par', 'voices', 'songs', 'sound', 'useless', 'pop', 'songs', 'late', '1990', 'not', 'exactly', 'mark', 'classic', 'i', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'everyone', 'so', 'enamored', 'lovely', 'little', 'piece', 'trash', 'should', 'have', 'debuted', 'dissapeared.PS', 'i', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'emmy', 'nominations', 'everything', 'direction', 'choreography', 'outstanding', 'music', 'lyrics', 'did', 'acadamy', 'hear', 'lyrics', 'truely', 'scary', 'part', 'phantom', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'snubbed', 'oscars', 'least', 'phantom', 'opera', 'will', 'remain', 'timelss', 'clasic', 'musical', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'forgotten', 'god', 'willing.and', 'parents', 'think', 'so', 'great', 'kids', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'NEVER', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'want', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'just', 'get', 'old', 'disney', 'moveies', 'worked', 'rest']",High School Musical

Could one musical bring them, and their school, together?""High School Musical"" was good...for a Disney Channel Original Movie.  I give it four stars because it was fun and it held my interest, but looking back on it I'm sure it would mostly only appeal to pre-teen girls.First of all, there were a lot of unbelievable parts in the movie.  The school was too luxurious, Troy and Gabriella's first time singing together was way too comfortable, and it was obvious that they were lip-synching to the songs, the music sounded just as it would if you were listening to it on the soundtrack.  Not to mention that seeing atheltic boys in basketball jerseys dancing can be a bit odd to watch.  The songs were corny but catchy.  The characters could be random at times but were likeable.  They never showed the actual musical, which was a bit of a dissapointment...but really the cons should end here.  It's a Disney Channel Original Movie, not a high-quality musical that took years to film.  It's fun, funny, a bit typical and predictable, but enjoyable.  It's a hit with younger girls, and that's no surprise: Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hutchinson are most girls' dream main boy character and main girl character, and the dance steps are so (surprisingly until I figured out the reason) easy that girls can learn them and dance along to the music.  I recommend this movie to all girls; some teen girls may even enjoy it.

I finally decided to watch it simply because of the buzz it has received.  I was both pleasantly surprised and mildly disappointed in viewing it.  The mild disappointment is that it was clearly aimed at a much younger age group than I was hoping for.  I would guess that the optimal age group is 6-13, while I had hoped before seeing it that it might be 12 to 18 and thus more interesting to an adult.  Nonetheless, given its target age group and the fact that it originated on TV, it is of remarkably high quality.  This truly is a superior children's movie.The music was fine, the kind of tunes that you can enjoy instantly without too much of a desire to ever hear again.  The singing was consistently pleasant without be truly outstanding.  The acting and performing all excellent but nothing truly extraordinary.  The cast was solid.  I had some trouble with male lead Zac Efron.  I found him a tad too pretty and his voice was pitched so high that at first I thought he was lip-synching a female singer in the karaoke scene near the beginning.  But my real beef was having him play a basketball star.  If you've played a lot of basketball you develop a host of subtleties in the way you handle a ball, and Efron had none of these.  Still, he had a likable personality.  The real stand out of the cast was Vanessa Anne Hudgens, who reminded me very much of another Disney star of a different era, Annette Funicello.  The two at that age had very similar skin color and tone, similarly shaped faces, were both pretty short (I think Hudgens might be even shorter), and both exceptionally pretty and enormously likable.  The movie didn't ask for Hudgens to act much, but she sang very appealingly.  The large and varied support cast was more than adequate.  I have to add that this is the response of an adult.  For a kid who is 10, Zac Efron's prettiness might be for more a virtue than it is for me and his having more of a soprano than a tenor voice might not be such a negative.All in all, this is a remarkably well-done movie.  Most adults will probably find it too juvenile in tone to enjoy much, but I can't imagine very many non-animated movies that would be better for a parent to watch with their kid.  And it certainly has to go down as one of the best kid musicals ever produced.  If we exclude animated films with singing, there are amazingly few kids film filled with song.  Perhaps this movie will inspire some imitators in addition to the two sequels that are already in the works.",4,My daughter and I found it surprisingly enjoyable,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,2633,"['Disney', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'hits', 'decades', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'unexpected', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'simply', 'buzz', 'received', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'mildly', 'disappointed', 'viewing', 'mild', 'disappointment', 'was', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'much', 'younger', 'age', 'group', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'guess', 'optimal', 'age', 'group', '6-13', 'had', 'hoped', 'seeing', 'might', 'be', '12', '18', 'thus', 'more', 'interesting', 'adult', 'Nonetheless', 'given', 'target', 'age', 'group', 'fact', 'originated', 'TV', 'remarkably', 'high', 'quality', 'truly', 'superior', 'children', 'movie.The', 'music', 'was', 'fine', 'kind', 'tunes', 'can', 'enjoy', 'instantly', 'too', 'much', 'desire', 'ever', 'hear', 'again', 'singing', 'was', 'consistently', 'pleasant', 'be', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'performing', 'excellent', 'nothing', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'was', 'solid', 'had', 'trouble', 'male', 'lead', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'found', 'tad', 'too', 'pretty', 'voice', 'was', 'pitched', 'so', 'high', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'lip-synching', 'female', 'singer', 'karaoke', 'scene', 'beginning', 'real', 'beef', 'was', 'having', 'play', 'basketball', 'star', ""'ve"", 'played', 'lot', 'basketball', 'develop', 'host', 'subtleties', 'way', 'handle', 'ball', 'Efron', 'had', 'none', 'Still', 'had', 'likable', 'personality', 'real', 'stand', 'cast', 'was', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'Hudgens', 'who', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'Disney', 'star', 'different', 'era', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'two', 'age', 'had', 'very', 'similar', 'skin', 'color', 'tone', 'similarly', 'shaped', 'were', 'pretty', 'short', 'think', 'Hudgens', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'shorter', 'exceptionally', 'pretty', 'enormously', 'likable', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Hudgens', 'act', 'much', 'sang', 'very', 'appealingly', 'large', 'varied', 'support', 'cast', 'was', 'more', 'adequate', 'have', 'add', 'response', 'adult', 'kid', 'who', '10', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'prettiness', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'virtue', 'having', 'more', 'soprano', 'tenor', 'voice', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'negative.All', 'remarkably', 'well-done', 'movie', 'Most', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'too', 'juvenile', 'tone', 'enjoy', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'very', 'many', 'non-animated', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'parent', 'watch', 'kid', 'certainly', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'kid', 'musicals', 'ever', 'produced', 'exclude', 'animated', 'films', 'singing', 'are', 'amazingly', 'few', 'kids', 'film', 'filled', 'song', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'will', 'inspire', 'imitators', 'addition', 'two', 'sequels', 'are', 'already', 'works']",High School Musical

Are you as amazed as I am about all of the really bad films that Hollywood churns out every year?Disney comes up with a ""Bollywood"" type film that is G-rated.  I'm sure most producers and studio execs were scoffing that this project and thinking, ""There's no way this movie will take off.  Nobody watches G-rated films anymore, and certainly not a musical.""This smash hit film is fun for everyone.  I don't care what age you are, you can sit down with your family and friends and enjoy a fun, up-lifting, sensational film that will leave a smile on your face!  You will probably also ask the inevitable question: ""Why aren't more American films like this one?""The tradition of India's Bollywood films is to always have song and dance.  A famous Indian actor was quoted, ""A movie without music and dance for us is the same as a movie without special effects for Westerners."" Also, the music of many Bollywood films isn't just music.  The lyrics actually have something to say, usually with words of inspiration or encouragement.  I noticed that the songs in High School Musical followed the same tradition.Bollywood films are catching fire all around the world.  I know.  I lived in Kazakhstan for 2 years where Bollywood films are loved.  America seems to be the last place on Earth where Bollywood is still vying for a spot of interest.High School Musical is a great film about a young boy, Troy, (Zac Efron) who is a star basketball player at his local high school.  He is pulled on ""stage"" by his friends at a karaoke party to sing with the new girl, Gabriella (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), who spends most of her time studying.  These two characters quickly discover that they sing very well...especially together!  Efron plays the ""cool"" Troy without going overboard with the stereotype.  He's a good guy with a cool head who is not as egotistical as what you might think.  Hudgens plays Garbriella with a soft cuteness and gentleness which makes are very appealing.  She has a tender smile which helps the audience tap into the wholesomeness of her character.When these two characters contemplate trying out for the winter musical, they find themselves in a quandry between maintaining their ""reputations"" with their friends (since their friends don't know about their hidden talent!) and following their hearts and dreams.What really makes this film compelling, isn't just the music.  It's about unification.  American high schools are torn apart by prejudicial clicks.  This film tries to convey the message that we can look past the differences and support each other.The story really is a simple one, but they really make the most of it.  This movie should almost be required viewing in high school.  It may help our teenagers learn a lot about themselves.The song and dance routines in this movie are first-rate.  And you can tell that the actors and actresses had a blast doing it.  You'll find yourself clapping and cheering from beginning to end.And let's hope that Hollywood looks to make some films like this one, and that Disney makes more!

True, the plotline is fairly simplistic, most DCOM movies are that way.  However, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  Ashley Tisdale did a good job with her character, but because her character was written so over the top, she was not able to shine.  Vanessa Anne Hudgens seemed way too happy to land a part in the movie.  She's got a sweet face and looked the part of an All-American girl, but I didn't find her acting all that convincing.  The rest of the cast were okay, nothing impressive.  I loved the song ""Get Your Head in the Game.""  The dancing and the song were great.  I can't say the same thing with ""Stick to the Status Quo.""  Although the song and dance number was performed quite well, it was weak.  As another reviewer pointed out, ""no one"" does their homework in the caffeteria at lunch.  Since DCOM movies are geared toward 10-year-olds, I suppose this movie fits that target range (although some 10-year-olds may find it a bit lame), I find that many DCOM movies appeal to a much wider audience (especially the movie that Disney made about apartheid in South Africa.  Now, that's an awesome DCOM movie!).  I was surprised when I saw that Disney was offering the scripts for High Schools to use for their spring plays.  I don't think it'll appeal to high school audiences at all.  If you can forgive some of the wooden characters and over-the-top acting, then this movie could be quite fun.

981736,A24L13Q1GJAS6U,B000F2BNW2,"The Cruelly Mad Emperor Caligula ""Little Boots""","[5, 27]","HSM has been notoriously billed as the ""Grease"" of this generation to draw a connection between it and this movie's musical roots. That's an analogy that highlights the superficial, ""fun"" aspect of this movie, but HSM has other praiseworthy attributes. HSM is the type of entertainment that should be mass-marketed to teenagers today because that demographic is cataclysmically in peril of entering into high-risk behavior such as premature sex, gang-involvement, drug use, apathy, violence, idleness, etc.. HSM is a very laudable antidote to this predilection of risky, teen misbehavior because of the values it espouses: healthy activities, pride in oneself, determination, achievement, school involvement, rejecting peer pressure et al.Because of the way the values espoused are treated, HSM is in danger of being dismissed as a breezy, thoughtless piece of banality and triteness where its values are so rigidly clean-cut they come off as being insincere. In fact, this only scratches the surface of HSM's enormous faults, and aside from the facade of clean-cut values, everything else is in freefall.Despite Disney's focus on constructive values for teens, a deeper analysis unmasks really harmful influences throughout the movie, influences which are to blame for our society's decay in the form of over-sexualization, vanity, appearance-consciousness, obsession with wealth, and low self-esteem.All the young starlet-actors, whether its Efron or Hudgens or Tisdale, don't look like the average, normal teenager. Maybe that's because they're many years older than most teenagers, but mostly because they're unnaturally appearance-oriented. Efron's character Troy is someone the vast majority of teens WON'T relate to because he looks like a little Calvin Klein model with his perfect hair and his chiseled face (Efron is currently hyped as a sex symbol by debauched magazine Rolling Stone). The girls (Stripperella Hudgens/Tisdale) are even more loathsome: their faces are repositories for an explosion of makeup and their clothing puts an emphasis on the superficiality of wealth and vanity.The Sharpay character particularly is a destructive ""role model"" for young girls because her attire shows exorbitant amounts of skin (too short skirts) and misleads teens to think that one needs expensive clothing to fit in. Though the Sharpay character's supposed to be a lesson against this sort of misconduct by teens due to her being the villain, HSM fails to make this clear enough, and impressionable (read: stupid) teens and those younger will fail to get this connotation. Instead, many teens probably will come away with the misinformation that misbehaving like a selfish, vanity-obsessed Sharpay is praiseworthy--not just since our liberal-infected pop culture pushes those toxins--but because HSM glorifies the villain in Sharpay.Aside from these unpardonable breaches, HSM also should concern parents for its deadly messages of emasculation and effemination when teenage boys are watching; the themes of feminine dancing and singing are enough to potentially neuter the masculinity of teen boys watching this foulness, which is what liberalism wants anyway. Boys should participate in sports and community service in order to both keep them busy and build character, yet this film indoctrinates teen boys to squander their time with limp-wristed singing and dancing. This shouldn't be totally startling since Disney is culpable for clandestinely indoctrinating young boys to turn effeminate via the overwhelming skew towards female activities in their products--just look at other popular shows on the Disney Channel: Hannah Montana, Raven, etc..Since HSM has themes/values that are so much healthier and cleaner for teens who are in desperate need of guidance in their impressionable lives, it's with a somewhat heavy heart that I write this next paragraph. I have many friends who are young couples with young kids, so I intimately know what Disney should do to retain its patronage of their demographic, families with children. Many reading this review likely know by now the scandalously lewd expose that hit one of the debauched starlets in this film, Vanessa Hudgens due to her own misjudgments and lust for temptation!!!! Hudgens took stark-naked pictures of herself which where then plastered all over the internet.Only if one's a moral relativist who excuses hurtful, moral misbehavior could one still support this product after one of its most prominent faces betrayed all the little kids to whom she's supposed to be a role model with her salacious exhibitionism!!!! Speaking on behalf of all my many friends who are couples with young kids, they'll NOT be buying ANY MORE Disney products until Disney redeems their company from the taint left by Hudgens. That is to fire her and show the families with young children that Disney really protects and promotes traditional, conservative family virtues, or else, it appears like Disney only cares about making money. In fact, Disney has gone on record about Hudgens, that the reason they'll not discipline her is not to upset the attraction of youngsters to Hudgens and her popular character.All the young couples with young kids whom I know are boycotting Disney until they sanitize this uncleanliness left by Hudgens' misconduct.",1,HSM is so effeminate that it will continue modern-day America's unlucky trend of turning young men into NANCY BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,5299,"['HSM', 'been', 'notoriously', 'billed', 'Grease', 'generation', 'draw', 'connection', 'movie', 'musical',

Everything is very colourful and happy. You either like this true Disney feeling or not. One thing is for sure, this happiness and true Disney feeling makes younger children fall in love with it immediately.It's all a matter of taste. A classic story about two high school students who want to compete for the main roles in their High School Musical but are, if they do it, not excepted by their friends anymore. Now give it some nice Disney sweetness and make it a world where characters can break into a hit song any minute.High School Musical is definitely a very good film in it's genre and is perfect for it's goal audience. Still, it is made with so much fun and a true happy spirit that it also reaches outside this goal audience.The songs are very catchy and are in your head easily. This sure helps the movie's success. Just like with Grease, these songs are ones you can, after a few times of listening, happily sing along.Then there are a lot of colourful characters people can relate to. Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens are good charming leads and give the story a nice touch.But next to all that fun, there are of course some lessons in the film as well. Lessons about acceptance and friendship that are well placed in the storyline.All I can say is that I'm going to check out High School Musical 2 and see if that one is as entertainingly Disney fun as this one.Recommended for anyone who wants some light, colourful and mainly happy sing along entertainment.But then again, it's of course all a matter of taste if you will fall in love with it or not.3.5 stars out of 5",4,High School Musical Entertains the Way it Should,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1885,"['Hearing', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'media', 'internet', 'very', 'positive', 'very', 'negative', 'comments', 'just', 'had', 'check', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'understand', 'sides.High', 'School', 'Musical', 'first', 'true', 'Disney', 'production', 'Everything', 'very', 'colourful', 'happy', 'either', 'true', 'Disney', 'feeling', 'not', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'happiness', 'true', 'Disney', 'feeling', 'younger', 'children', 'fall', 'love', 'immediately.It', 'matter', 'taste', 'classic', 'story', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'want', 'compete', 'main', 'roles', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'excepted', 'friends', 'anymore', 'Now', 'give', 'nice', 'Disney', 'sweetness', 'make', 'world', 'where', 'characters', 'can', 'break', 'hit', 'song', 'minute.High', 'School', 'Musical', 'definitely', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'genre', 'perfect', 'goal', 'audience', 'Still', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'true', 'happy', 'spirit', 'also', 'goal', 'audience.The', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'catchy', 'are', 'head', 'easily', 'sure', 'movie', 'success', 'Just', 'Grease', 'songs', 'are', 'ones', 'can', 'few', 'times', 'listening', 'happily', 'sing', 'are', 'lot', 'colourful', 'characters', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'Hudgens', 'are', 'good', 'charming', 'leads', 'give', 'story', 'nice', 'touch.But', 'fun', 'are', 'course', 'lessons', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Lessons', 'acceptance', 'friendship', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'storyline.All', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'going', 'check', 'out', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '2', 'see', 'one', 'entertainingly', 'Disney', 'fun', 'one.Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'light', 'colourful', 'mainly', 'happy', 'sing', 'along', 'entertainment.But', 'then', 'again', 'course', 'matter', 'taste', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'not.3.5', 'stars', '5']",High School Musical

By the opening scene I knew I'd love it. I was a major fan of Grease and Dirty Dancing, the Brady Bunch and the Partridge Family. This was the clean version of all of those. The star of the movie looks like a young David Cassidy, from the lips, to the eyes to the voice. And that's not a bad thing. While I was having fun reliving my youth, my daughter was up and down dancing along with the actors every time they broke into song.

981744,A1QTOBWTX0LVYM,B000F2BNW2,"Woo Kim ""Woo K.""","[1, 3]","I must admit I had heard of high school musical long before I watched this DVD.  I was skeptical at first, one because I love musicals and there are several of them espically on TV networks that are just not good and two I just didn't want to see a movie that was just good because they good looking kids with ""okay"" singing ability.  I should mention that this is going to have several spoilers in it so if you haven't at least rented the DVD from your local Blockbuster or Netflix or where ever please stop reading this.  This movie for me has a lot of visual images from both West Side Story and from Grease.  The high school scenes and musical sequences like ""Stick to the Status Quo"" and ""We are all in this together"" look very Grease to me.  West Side Story is all over this movie to me, right down to the people they casted for Gabriela Montez and Troy Bolton.  Vanessa Anne Hudges and Zac Efron look like a young Richard Bemer (Tony) and Natalie Wood (Maria).  The party scene where Troy and Gabriella meet is very similar to where Tony and Maria meet in the gym in West Side Story.  Vanessa Anne Hudges is quite possibly the closest dead ringer to Natalie Wood I have ever seen.  Like Natalie she has the ability to make you care about what she is doing even if she is acting a little blank.  The song When There Was Me & You is a direct homage to Maria in West Side Story but this is being told from a heartbroken female point of view.  There is many intimate with Troy and Gabriella that harkin back to the bridal shop scenes and the fire escapes scenes from West Side Story.  The over arching story is really about labels how people see you in high school.  And how there is unwritten rule in high school that certain people in high school don't do certain things.  I.e. Troy the captain of the East High basketball team wants to be in the school musical.  However, he has a lot of pressure from his teammates and from his father who just also happens to be his coach as well.  Gabriella has similar struggles to Troy's she has always been viewed in whatever school she goes to as the ""freaky math girl"" and she just wants to be seen simply as a girl and singing with Troy makes her feel special and normal at the same time.  There is a love story between the two of them but it is more implied.  There is no passionate kissing scenes between the two of them and this probably because of it is a Disney Channel film and supposed to for younger children.  I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did but I do and I'm proud to say it.  If you love musicals and or love stories you'll like this movie it isn't too long and as far as the special features you might want to buy the 2 disc special edition of this DVD also found on Amazon.com because it has much more stuff on how the movie was made.  Lastly, the Director and chareographer of this film Kenny Ortega has quite a resume.  He did Dirty Dancing (as chareographer) Hocus Pocus (as director) Ferris Bueller's Day Off (as chareographer) and Cheetah Girls 2 (as chareographer and Director.)",5,High School Musical quite possibly the best TV movie disney channel has ever done.,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,3064,"['must', 'admit', 'had', 'heard', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'long', 'watched', 'DVD', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'one', 'love', 'musicals', 'are', 'several', 'espically', 'TV', 'networks', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'two', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'good', 'looking', 'kids', 'okay', 'singing', 'ability', 'should', 'mention', 'going', 'have', 'several', 'spoilers', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'least', 'rented', 'DVD', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'Netflix', 'where', 'ever', 'please', 'stop', 'reading', 'movie', 'lot', 'visual', 'images', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Grease', 'high', 'school', 'scenes', 'musical', 'sequences', 'Stick', 'Status', 'Quo', 'are', 'together', 'look', 'very', 'Grease', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'movie', 'right', 'down', 'people', 'casted', 'Gabriela', 'Montez', 'Troy', 'Bolton', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'Hudges', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'look', 'young', 'Richard', 'Bemer', 'Tony', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Maria', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'Troy', 'Gabriella', 'meet', 'very', 'similar', 'where', 'Tony', 'Maria', 'meet', 'gym', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'Hudges', 'quite', 'possibly', 'closest', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Natalie', 'ability', 'make', 'care', 'what', 'doing', 'even', 'acting', 'little', 'blank', 'song', 'When', 'Was', 'Me', 'direct', 'homage', 'Maria', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'being', 'told', 'heartbroken', 'female', 'point', 'view', 'many', 'intimate', 'Troy', 'Gabriella', 'harkin', 'back', 'bridal', 'shop', 'scenes', 'fire', 'scenes', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'arching', 'story', 'really', 'about', 'how', 'people', 'see', 'high', 'school', 'how', 'unwritten', 'rule', 'high', 'school', 'certain', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'certain', 'things', 'I.e', 'Troy', 'captain', 'East', 'High', 'basketball', 'team', 'be', 'school', 'musical', 'However', 'lot', 'pressure', 'teammates', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'also', 'be', 'coach', 'as', 'well', 'Gabriella', 'similar', 'struggles', 'Troy', 'always', 'been', 'viewed', 'school', 'freaky', 'math', 'girl', 'just', 'be', 'seen', 'simply', 'girl', 'singing', 'Troy', 'feel', 'special', 'normal', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'more', 'implied', 'passionate', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'two', 'probably', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'film', 'supposed', 'younger', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'do', ""'m"", 'proud', 'say', 'love', 'musicals', 'love', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'as', 'far', 'special', 'features', 'might', 'want', 'buy', '2', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'also', 'found', 'Amazon.com', 'much', 'more', 'stuff', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Lastly', 'Director', 'chareographer', 'film', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'quite', 'resume', 'did', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'chareographer', 'Hocus', 'Pocus', 'director', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'chareographer', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', '2', 'chareographer', 'Director']",High School Musical
981745,A2CYMGGXS5QPJT,B000F2BNW2,Yay for Music!,"[7, 34]","Okay, this should really be a zero, but this rating system won't allow it.First of all, this movie has nothing interesting that hasn't been seen already: the struggle to move from the social norm has been done so many times I wonder who the heck started it (Probably ""Pride and Prejudice""). Anyway, this is nothing new.This movie is no great shakes. It doesn't really say much to call it ""A hit"" because anyone can say that. And I don't really understand why people are so into it. It doesn't grab me. Maybe I've seen too many films already, but that proves my point, it does nothing for me. I like intelligent films. Films that have meanings under the words being said, new themes, new ways of introducing those themes. And new words in songs for it to be a musical. If you think that this movie is good when you're five, okay, fine. But not past seven. At age seven most kids who are my age had already started reading books like ""Holes"", not the best movie, but a good book. And Harry Potter isn't bad either. It's something a little different, I respect that.But again, High School Musical is nothing more than an opportunity for a bunch of high school age actors to get famous. Not everyone I know can sing like that, even me. So, I know that not everyone can sing in reality. Now, you want an accurate and funny school musical? I suggest ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"". Peanuts is a classic, funny, and realistic view of how kindergarten is, and it's fun to sing along to!Geniuses like Charles Shultz, Walt Disney, and JRR Tolkien, cannot be just attempted to copy and then labeled as great within a short three years or less of filming. In reality, most experts say it takes ten years minimum to be an expert. And the LOTR movies came close by taking seven years to create the movies, they were flawed, but Tolkien's world was captured.High School musical fails to capture anything but a gag and acid in my throat. I can't believe how loosely labeled this movie is.Next, the people who watch this need a reality check. Who actually thinks that high schools are like this? I go to an arts high school (And people sing, yes) but it is by far not like that at all. And the other thing is why, why, why can a science nerd sing? It makes no sense! If you focus on your studies, logically, you will have no after school time for music lessons. And same goes for basketball jocks. And this is really all too complimentary of jocks. I've been to many places and seen jocks. They are all one demensional as they are stereotyped. Not that some aren't different. But what needs to be said is that when you have something you concentrate on, say, hockey, you need another person who you can see who has a similar schedule. Anyway, that's how real high school works. I don't even know if the Disney staff wants people to be prepared for the real thing. All I know is that this is not it.The only thing that was somewhat appealing was the music, and even that was only because it was catchy, otherwise it sucked.I agree with the other reviewers, this movie tries to hit new (Excuse my bad pun) ""notes"" but it is so far off with its singing characters trying to overcome their conflict of being stuck under pressure. Yeah, sure, I get that it's a conflict, being under pressure in school, but the movie is so ludicrous about how the problem is solved. I'm not trying to be morbid, but singing doesn't solve diddily squat.Not to mention the songs are really annoying. Songs have to have more than one line. End of story. Even the Beatles (good band by the way) have more than just ""We all live in a yellow submarine"" and it's catchy, but there's a point.There's a story in those songs that requires thought. High School Musical made me feel brain dead. I couldn't think about anything that wasn't in the song already.I might want to add that to be a Disney movie, it has to be a movie with a good plot that is original. Which it's not. I've seen movies about overcoming social barriers at least fifty times before now and I've enjoyed better musicals. Good example (Cynical) but good: ""Avenue Q"", good show with music that says something about our society and is funny at the same time. That's entertaining.I was not really interested in High School Musical simply because after I saw the comercials, there was nothing left to see. I watched it to see if I was wrong, but I wasn't.Story:Girl meets guy at party, girl and guy leave. Girl and guy meet up at school. Girl and guy are on separated sides of social status. Girl and guy fight status and win and sing about it. There you have it.The reason for my statement about the ""Rip Off""? Oh, that, maybe some of you should take a look at the (I think even before 1999) film ""Grease"" and tell me if that looks familiar.Two high school kids meet and then meet again later to find out they go to the same school. The guy is popular... get the idea? I liked Grease and I think it deserves all the credit this High School Musical is getting.Second of all, Disney is dead. Not dying, dead. Great classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Fox and the Hound"" aren't produced any more. Kids of this generation have been cheated out of a good movie and TV experience.Shows like ""Kim Possible"" and ""Spongebob Squarepants"" barely make the cut for good shows.Good shows are more than just social problems, get creative! Anime has the same plot, but... the guy might turn into an animal or demon (something like Beauty and the Beast) and the girl has to deal with the guy being a demon and having to hide his identity. That is good drama. And heck, they can sing about it and make it seem funny because it's serious when your boyfriend might end up killing the school if you're not careful. Morbid humour, yes, but it's interesting to watch.For example: Grease is a good movie because it touched a new subject.High School Musical is a sad version that I was laughing at (Not because it was funny) but because it was a sorry excuse for an overated film).I have a suggestion for you disney goers: STOP WATCHING DISNEY CHANNEL BEFORE YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE WASTED!! Disney has not produced too many good movies since Disney himself died. Okay ones have been ""Smart House"" and ""The Thirteenth Year"" about a sinister house and a merman. Not bad, really. I haven't exactly seen too many Merman movies, mostly mermaid ones. And I have heard of horror movies with senile houses, but this one was bittersweet, but good. Might want to watch those instead.With few exceptions of some shows with good acting, the Disney Channel does not produce good shows.Suggestions: Go to your TV guide channel and watch these shows/channels: Comedy Central (most of the time it has hillarious comedians) I really like Dane Cook and Mind of Mencia isn't bad either), watch Adult swim on Saturday nights (for teens and older), Avatar is excellent (It's not American by the way), Don't watch the Cartoon Network versions of Anime shows, go to Youtube or rent them. Watch the subs not dubs! (Meaning, don't watch it in English, they're overedited, the voices stink, and they are censored like there's no tomorrow). Oh, if you do watch Nicktoons, watch Avatar, Danny Phantom, and (Buy or rent this) ""Invader Zim"".Good Shows (Anime Wise):Chrno (Chrono) CrusadeTrinity BloodKimba the White Lion (Sound similar to ""Simba"" from the Lion King? It should, Kimba was the basis for the Lion King and was produced in Japan)Fullmetal AlchemistTeen Titans (This is Japanese, not American)Mobile Suit Gundam WingMobile Suit Gundam SeedNaruto (Please save yourself the pain and don't watch it on Cartoon Network)One Piece (Cartoon Network really messed this up, watch it in Japanese)Rurouni KenshinSamurai ChamplooDN AngelBeet the Vandel Buster (For Fantasy Fans)Fruits Basket (Good for you romance people)Neon Genesis EvangelionAstro Boy.Hack//Sign (Good for Video game people)Good Movies (Anime and Other)Grave of the FirefliesSteamboyAkiraSpirited AwayCastle in the Sky (Laputa)My Neighbor TotoroPorco RossoJungle Emperor LeoKiki's Delivery ServiceTop GunOcean's Eleven (Not Twelve and Thirteen,the first is the best)Master and Commander (The far side of the World)Glory (Rated R)Dragon HeartSeabiscutThe Frisco KidStar Wars (All are good, especially the originals)Fight Club (Rated R)Close Encounters of the Third KindPrincess MononokeMillenium ActressCocoonHero (Same who did ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, also a good movie)The Dark Chrystal (This is good animation by Jim Henson, master of the puppets!)Labyrinth (Also by Jim Henson)Rashomon (Artistic film, made to be analyzed very carefully.

981747,AP3B615GM191G,B000F2BNW2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The other night, having nothing else to do, I popped in the DVD of High School Musical just to see what the ""fuss"" is all about (My younger sister owns the HSM dolls, clothes, towels, movies, CDs, video games, sheet music, etc).  Though not usually drawn to the musical genre or Disney Channel dramatic fare, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film held my interest and entertained me for its duration.Plot-wise, HSM doesn't deviate too far from standard Disney programming.  When new girl to school Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) begins to form a relationship with school beau Troy Bolton (Zac Efron), it draws the ire of popular girl Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) and facilitates an overhaul of East High's social cliques.What sets the storyline apart from, say, a typical episode of Hannah Montana, though, is the way the school stereotypes are portrayed.  Instead of getting too preachy, Disney instead wildly accentuates those stereotypes and lets the simple messages of diversity and acceptance speak for themselves.  Troy is the All-American boy every girl has a crush on, Gabriella is the stunningly beautiful girl next door, and Sharpay is the over-the-top princess who rules the school with her status.Of course, HSM needs to (as a musical) ultimately be judged on the quality of its musical numbers...the category in which it succeeds fantastically.  From the very beginning, when a karaoke DJ hands microphones to Troy and Gabriella and tells them ""you might thank me for this someday"", viewers will realize the quality of the musical numbers about to come.  Though Efron does not provide his own vocals, he IS able to adroitly portray the conflicted Troy (basketball vs. singing) through acting and dance.  Hudgens' tunes are usually softer, but very poignant (""When There Was Me And You"", in which Hudgens flies solo, is my favorite piece in the film), while Tisdale is probably the most talented actor/singer/dancer of the bunch in her fantastically choreographed and special effects-laden numbers.So, if you are a parent/older sibling who wants to know what make your child/younger sibling go crazy over HSM, I would encourage you to sit down and watch this film (preferably with them).  Even the most jaded critics will be humming (or outright belting) the catchy melodies long after the end credits roll.",4,What's Not To Like About This Charming Film?!,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2337,"['other', 'night', 'having', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'popped', 'DVD', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'My', 'younger', 'sister', 'HSM', 'dolls', 'clothes', 'towels', 'movies', 'CDs', 'video', 'games', 'sheet', 'music', 'etc', 'not', 'usually', 'drawn', 'musical', 'genre', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'dramatic', 'fare', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'film', 'held', 'interest', 'entertained', 'duration.Plot-wise', 'HSM', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'too', 'far', 'standard', 'Disney', 'programming', 'When', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'Gabriella', 'Montez', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'form', 'relationship', 'school', 'beau', 'Troy', 'Bolton', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'ire', 'popular', 'girl', 'Sharpay', 'Evans', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'overhaul', 'East', 'High', 'social', 'cliques.What', 'storyline', 'apart', 'say', 'typical', 'episode', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'though', 'way', 'school', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Instead', 'getting', 'too', 'preachy', 'Disney', 'instead', 'wildly', 'stereotypes', 'simple', 'messages', 'diversity', 'acceptance', 'speak', 'Troy', 'All-American', 'boy', 'girl', 'crush', 'Gabriella', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'door', 'Sharpay', 'over-the-top', 'princess', 'who', 'rules', 'school', 'status.Of', 'course', 'HSM', 'musical', 'ultimately', 'be', 'judged', 'quality', 'musical', 'numbers', 'category', 'fantastically', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'karaoke', 'DJ', 'microphones', 'Troy', 'Gabriella', 'might', 'thank', 'someday', 'viewers', 'will', 'realize', 'quality', 'musical', 'numbers', 'come', 'Efron', 'not', 'provide', 'own', 'vocals', 'able', 'adroitly', 'portray', 'conflicted', 'Troy', 'basketball', 'vs.', 'singing', 'acting', 'dance', 'Hudgens', 'tunes', 'are', 'usually', 'softer', 'very', 'poignant', 'When', 'Was', 'Me', 'Hudgens', 'solo', 'favorite', 'piece', 'film', 'Tisdale', 'probably', 'most', 'talented', 'actor/singer/dancer', 'bunch', 'fantastically', 'choreographed', 'special', 'effects-laden', 'numbers.So', 'are', 'parent/older', 'sibling', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'child/younger', 'sibling', 'go', 'crazy', 'HSM', 'would', 'encourage', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'preferably', 'Even', 'most', 'jaded', 'critics', 'will', 'be', 'humming', 'outright', 'belting', 'catchy', 'melodies', 'long', 'end', 'roll']",High School Musical
