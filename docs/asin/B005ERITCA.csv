1456982,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B005ERITCA,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Nothing Personal is normally the type of film I would like very much, independent, stark, deep character study, and mysterious about where the film is going. Unfortunately, the film became predictable and turned into just a very slow deliberate film that left me empty at the end.The film opens with incredible promise. A beautiful woman is standing at a window looking outside; a large group of people are rummaging through belongings on the street, a huge pile of things. People put things in their pockets. The film cuts back to the woman at the window to reveal that she is standing in an empty apartment and she takes off her wedding band. I was absolutely 100% completely hooked at that moment. The film continued to do wonderful things - the first chapter is titled ""Loneliness"". The film moves along deliberately while the woman walks with a backpack in incredibly beautiful areas. Turns out this is Ireland, and the film hooked me more. The director could have spent too much time developing loneliness, instead she moved along quickly to the next chapter.But then something happened about midway, all of a sudden what was going to happen became very predictable. I kept looking at how much time was left in the film. I could predict easily what would happen next. From the moment the woman takes her clothes off and rolls around in a beautiful bed with cloudlike white sheets, I knew exactly what was going to happen next.And yet at the end of the film, I was left with this sad empty feeling. None of the mystery was ever solved, or even hinted at. I was disappointed beyond imagination by the last 15 minutes of this film. I didn't expect full resolution, but I expected to at least understand a little more about the characters. That never happened. I love films that leave me a little confused, wanting for a bit more. This film just took all the wind out of the sails and ended. Frankly, I didn't much care what happened to anybody. I had no connection with the characters. There is the problem with this film. I was left emotionless at the end. And for me that is inexcusable for a film.Nothing Personal is a beautiful film. Lotte Verbeek is stunningly beautiful as ""You"". Stephen Rea plays another character in the film and is handsome and perfect in an unusual way. The landscapes are incredibly gorgeous. The director did a fabulous job with pacing - the film moved along at a predictable pace with exactly the right timing for what she was trying to accomplish. The problem I had with the film was simply the story. It just didn't engage me at all. At an hour and twenty five minutes, the film is about the right length.There are some unusual musical references worth researching. Rubber Room by Porter Wagoner could get you well on your way to understanding the references. The song was not chosen by happenstance.The film is not rated. It would easily get an R rating by the MPAA. There is female nudity and strong language is thrown around a bit (well enough that the MPAA would rate it R). The nudity and language are perfectly appropriate and oddly chaste in this film, they just happen. For a mature younger viewer, this film would probably be fine.This film had me hooked for the first half. I was intrigued and wanted to love the characters. At the end I was just left with an empty feeling and disappointment.",3,Empty,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3338,"['Nothing', 'Personal', 'normally', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'independent', 'stark', 'deep', 'character', 'study', 'mysterious', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'became', 'predictable', 'turned', 'just', 'very', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'film', 'left', 'empty', 'end.The', 'film', 'incredible', 'promise', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'standing', 'window', 'looking', 'outside', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'rummaging', 'belongings', 'street', 'huge', 'pile', 'things', 'People', 'put', 'things', 'pockets', 'film', 'cuts', 'back', 'woman', 'window', 'reveal', 'standing', 'empty', 'apartment', 'wedding', 'band', 'was', 'absolutely', '100', '%', 'completely', 'hooked', 'moment', 'film', 'continued', 'do', 'wonderful', 'things', 'first', 'chapter', 'titled', 'Loneliness', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'deliberately', 'woman', 'backpack', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'areas', 'out', 'Ireland', 'film', 'hooked', 'more', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'loneliness', 'instead', 'moved', 'along', 'quickly', 'next', 'chapter.But', 'then', 'something', 'happened', 'midway', 'sudden', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'became', 'very', 'predictable', 'kept', 'looking', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'film', 'could', 'predict', 'easily', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'moment', 'woman', 'clothes', 'rolls', 'beautiful', 'bed', 'cloudlike', 'white', 'sheets', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next.And', 'yet', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'sad', 'empty', 'feeling', 'None', 'mystery', 'was', 'ever', 'solved', 'even', 'hinted', 'was', 'disappointed', 'imagination', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'full', 'resolution', 'expected', 'least', 'understand', 'little', 'more', 'characters', 'never', 'happened', 'love', 'films', 'leave', 'little', 'confused', 'wanting', 'bit', 'more', 'film', 'just', 'took', 'wind', 'sails', 'ended', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'anybody', 'had', 'connection', 'characters', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'emotionless', 'end', 'inexcusable', 'film.Nothing', 'Personal', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Lotte', 'Verbeek', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'character', 'film', 'handsome', 'perfect', 'unusual', 'way', 'landscapes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'director', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'pacing', 'film', 'moved', 'along', 'predictable', 'pace', 'exactly', 'right', 'timing', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'engage', 'hour', 'twenty', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'right', 'are', 'unusual', 'musical', 'references', 'worth', 'researching', 'Rubber', 'Room', 'Porter', 'Wagoner', 'could', 'get', 'well', 'way', 'understanding', 'references', 'song', 'was', 'not', 'chosen', 'happenstance.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'easily', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'MPAA', 'female', 'nudity', 'strong', 'language', 'thrown', 'bit', 'well', 'enough', 'MPAA', 'would', 'rate', 'R', 'nudity', 'language', 'are', 'perfectly', 'appropriate', 'oddly', 'chaste', 'film', 'just', 'happen', 'mature', 'younger', 'viewer', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'fine.This', 'film', 'had', 'hooked', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'intrigued', 'wanted', 'love', 'characters', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'left', 'empty', 'feeling', 'disappointment']",Nothing Personal

Teslovich,"[10, 14]","First, the IMDB review offers a view that may be helpful to look at before watching the movie if you're the type who's not into abstract interpretative paintings. Thus said, the movie starts out with a young woman giving away all of the household and personal stuff in a garage style giveaway and then sadly taking off her wedding ring. Did she kill her husband; did he just die; did he leave? Who knows. Next she leaves her home in Amsterdam to hitchhike through Ireland. The movie shows the beauty of the country in counterpoint to her anger, sadness and loneliness as she walks, hitchhikes and camps as a solitary figure in that vast landscape. Midway through she finds an isolated widower farmer who tries to, in a patiently intelligent manner, bring her back to life.
