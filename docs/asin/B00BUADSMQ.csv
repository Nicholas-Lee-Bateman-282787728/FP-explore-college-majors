1638388,AXERV7J4PIYS,B00BUADSMQ,,"[1, 2]","A Good Day To Die Hard, despite it's flaws, is not only a good movie but a good die hard movie. I don't understand the hate it gets. What really perplexes me is when people compare it to Olympus Has Fallen. I see so many claiming that Olympus has fallen is more Die Hard than this film. That is so untrue. Die Hard films are nowhere near as melodramatic and patriotic as Olympus. Don't get me wrong, Olympus is a good movie, but for different reasons. I think people's memories of the original 3 are a little skewed to be honest. As for being the most unrealistic in the series, Live Free is still #1 when it comes to being unrealistic. All 5 are.John McClane is still John McClane. He isn't in his mid 30s anymore. He's over 55 and his whole outlook on life is different now. He's not going act as he did more than 20 years ago, though parts of his old personality still shine through. Jack McClane is very much like a young John. Not quite hardened by experience, yet. Years of fighting trained professional terrorists will change you; another unrealistic aspect of the series. A Good Day has enough in it to keep anyone with realistic expectations glued to their seats. Lots of twists you don't see coming. The plot is pretty straight forward like the other 4 Die Hards. This time John McClane has to stop some russians from obtaining some items that, in their hands, will likely start a third World War. Another complaint people make about the film was the way it was shot. The shaky cam and slow motion isn't new to the Die Hard series, but it is a bit excessive here. I did like the look of the film, though. Looks especially good on bluray. The picture is colorful, grainy, sharp and gives A Good Day a really gritty look. This wasn't filmed in the traditional anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the series. Those films had a lot of steady shots and stylized angles. Live Free was shot on Super 35 and cropped to 2.35:1.*SPOILERS* The ending could've been better; it was a little abrupt. They just killed the bad guys and walked away. I would've liked to see Holly greet John and Jack when they returned home. With the Extended Cut (101 minutes), they made some improvements. They completely cut out Lucy McClane and put in extra footage that helped expand on John and Jacks relationship. This is very much a father and son movie and this extended cut does strengthen the film.So going into this for the 1st time, I did expect it to be much better than it was, but it was still a good movie. It entertained me, the story intrigued me and I cared about the characters. Those are the elements that make a movie good.",4,Stop the comparisons to Olympus Has Fallen...,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,2620,"['Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'flaws', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'die', 'hard', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'hate', 'What', 'really', 'perplexes', 'when', 'people', 'compare', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'claiming', 'Olympus', 'fallen', 'more', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'so', 'untrue', 'Die', 'Hard', 'films', 'are', 'nowhere', 'melodramatic', 'patriotic', 'Olympus', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Olympus', 'good', 'movie', 'different', 'reasons', 'think', 'people', 'memories', 'original', '3', 'are', 'little', 'skewed', 'be', 'honest', 'being', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'series', 'Live', 'Free', 'still', '1', 'when', 'being', 'unrealistic', '5', 'are.John', 'McClane', 'still', 'John', 'McClane', ""n't"", 'mid', '30s', 'anymore', '55', 'whole', 'outlook', 'life', 'different', 'now', 'not', 'going', 'act', 'did', 'more', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'parts', 'old', 'personality', 'still', 'Jack', 'McClane', 'very', 'much', 'young', 'John', 'Not', 'quite', 'hardened', 'experience', 'yet', 'Years', 'fighting', 'trained', 'professional', 'terrorists', 'will', 'change', 'unrealistic', 'aspect', 'series', 'Good', 'Day', 'enough', 'keep', 'anyone', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'glued', 'seats', 'Lots', 'twists', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'other', '4', 'Die', 'Hards', 'time', 'John', 'McClane', 'stop', 'russians', 'obtaining', 'items', 'hands', 'will', 'likely', 'start', 'third', 'World', 'War', 'complaint', 'people', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'shaky', 'cam', 'slow', 'motion', ""n't"", 'new', 'Die', 'Hard', 'series', 'bit', 'excessive', 'here', 'did', 'look', 'film', 'though', 'Looks', 'especially', 'good', 'bluray', 'picture', 'colorful', 'grainy', 'sharp', 'Good', 'Day', 'really', 'gritty', 'look', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'traditional', 'anamorphic', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'series', 'films', 'had', 'lot', 'steady', 'shots', 'stylized', 'angles', 'Live', 'Free', 'was', 'shot', 'Super', '35', 'cropped', '2.35:1', '*SPOILERS*', 'ending', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'was', 'little', 'abrupt', 'just', 'killed', 'bad', 'guys', 'walked', 'away', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'Holly', 'greet', 'John', 'Jack', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'Extended', 'Cut', '101', 'minutes', 'made', 'improvements', 'completely', 'cut', 'out', 'Lucy', 'McClane', 'put', 'extra', 'footage', 'helped', 'expand', 'John', 'Jacks', 'relationship', 'very', 'much', 'father', 'son', 'movie', 'extended', 'cut', 'strengthen', 'film.So', 'going', '1st', 'time', 'did', 'expect', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'entertained', 'story', 'intrigued', 'cared', 'characters', 'are', 'elements', 'make', 'movie', 'good']",N/A

If one minor thing went wrong, his entire plan would have failed.  This doesn't seem like a plan that a vaguely intelligent man would devise.

Which unfortunately is exactly what this has become.The last one wasn't terrible and followed the ""recipe"" of the ""franchise"".This one smacks of them trying to set up the new kid John McLane (sp?) JR to take over the franchise and it was a lot like they had Bruce Willis around to provide a touch point / seasoning to help loft the kid into his shoes.  Willis was there, had a goodly amount of screen time and they tried to palm it off as a ""buddy film"" of sorts between him and his son.  Unfortunately I found myself rooting for the bad guy to finish the kid off.....Specifics;- Okay, grown son, never mentioned in ANY of the previous movies- Russia (who cares, really, and it didn't help that they used extrasmall fonts with serifs for the obnoxious sub-titling for everyonewho spoke Russian.  It's in Russia, I got it, I really don't wantto read sub-titles on a movie like this.  I'll save that for Truffaut,Fellini, that sort of thing.- Plot... Well, there were some things in it that would I guess surprisesomeone who hadn't seen contrived TV plots over the last 20 some odd years.What were supposed to be great plot twists were somewhat obvious asyou knew that if they didn't flip the plot, the movie would be over WAYtoo soon.- Chase scenes through Russia...  Well, at least one truck gets hijackedin short order and mayhem ensues, guess they couldn't afford to hireRussian police to really get into the chase.- Major demolition, same deal, in town and in other locations, explosionsjust this side of a mushroom cloud and it's treated like a normal dayin downtown Moscow.Lacking-  Good dialogue, ""The McLane family business is Killing bad guys...."",that sort of thing.  Meant to be inspiring I suppose, came across asmostly trite.-  All of the previous entries had Mclane interacting with at least onebad guy, verbal barbs, etc.  Really none of that.-  Okay, Sr and Jr should be able to pick up some of the slack?  Nope,not that I heard anyway.-  Action sequences, meh, actually boring except for some reallydecent explosions.-  I found myself rooting for the villain's helicopter, but I thinkthey even swapped it out for a different model later in the movie;My Heli had stub wings with missiles, last one, didn't see any of that.-  Willis did seem like he was on vacation, standing around lacklusterperformance. (but I think a lot of that is he wasn'tgiven all that much to work with.).Predictable-  Son won't call Dad, Dad, guess what happens towards the end(oops, hope I didn't spoil it.)-  Daughter from previous movie brought in for all of about a minute-  Family portrait against a sunset sort of thing towards the endof the movie.Good newsI only  rented it, and not in HD, so the loss wasn't all that much.RecommendationEven for completists (me, for example) You'll never get this time back, go read a good book, I canrecommend some.Hopefully, if there's a next one, it will be better, but I'm guessing that the ""kid"" will try and take thespotlight (Remember Bonnie Bedalia (sp?), Willis wife? They dumped her off the truck very quickly.Stick with the first few of the series, pretend like this one didn't happen.I suppose on some level, if I hadn't enjoyed the other episodes as much, I wouldn't be as down onthis one.

Hell, the original trilogy in its entirety blew me away. They consistently offered tactically brilliant villains, and they went to great lengths to ensure they wouldn't be re-treads of the original. Of course, film studios never let a financial opportunity go to waste... leaving tarnished legacies an inevitability. As a result, John McClane returned to the big screen 12 years after the fact in Live Free or Die Hard, but not without its share of controversy. In order to reach a broader audience, the film was edited to acquire a PG-13 rating. Was the outrage that followed justified? Somewhat, but to be fair, it was a decent action-packed effort that featured John McClane kicking ass once again, so I found very little to complain about. Ever since, all of our beloved action stars from the 80's have made a resurgence, so it was only natural for Fox to keep the ball rolling with A Good Day to Die Hard, a film which promised to introduce our favourite tough-guy to Mother Russia, and with an 18 certificate, which is only right.A political prisoner is about to blow the whistle on a corrupt Russian official, but the criminal mastermind acts with extreme force to ensure that never comes to pass. It's an intriguing setup that comes with lots of potential, but ultimately serves as a bunch of noise behind the film's far more transparent crux - John McClane's estranged son Jack [Jai Courtney] is seemingly at the centre of this mess, so he sucks up his pride and hops on the first plane to Moscow for an awkward heart-to-heart'. John may be in a foreign land, but he's made to feel right at home when an attack erupts outside of the courthouse where his son is being held. Barely escaping with their lives, the father and son at odds rip through Moscow in a high speed chase that takes half the city along with it, and, the rest of the film practically writes itself. Although the duo start things off on the wrong foot, numerous encounters with bad guys itching to 'die hard' force them to bond in the only way the McClane's know how - By kicking ass and blowing up whatever gets in their way.Sure, it's a great idea to have John team up with his son and all, but at this point it feels like the filmmakers were throwing ideas at the wall, just hoping one would stick. I can understand the Directors primary concern, was to deliver an action film first and foremost. Screenwriter Skip Woods and Director John Moore felt saddling John McClane with a sidekick was obligatory. Die Hard doesn't need a gimmicks, just put our antihero in the right place at the wrong time, and allow him to do what he does best and I felt he did his very best, despite what other reviewers gave it a big thumbs down, especially with their one dimensional views and they should get a life and leave out their negative views, as most reviewers have rubbish this film and they are out of order, as I thought it was totally brilliant and awesome at the same time.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; Good Day to Die Hard makes its Blu-ray debut with an impressive 1080p brilliant encoded transfer with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Attempting to provide a gritty visual aesthetic, this movie was shot using 35mm film, meaning there's a noticeable amount of grain without being intrusive enough make the grain haters cry 'foul'. Despite the film's many shortcomings, this does help to lend the latest Die Hard with a tone of intensity, and this encode replicates the intended filmic look flawlessly. There's no digital anomalies to speak of - No edge enhancement, banding, aliasing or digital artefacts. The colour palette is somewhat muted at times, but the film is dominantly shown through blue and orange filters, and this artistic choice is also replicated without issue. It's an attempt to keep the film somewhat dark and moody, but it sure does help to make the reds and oranges of countless explosions practically leap off the screen. Sharpness is immaculate, although there are some soft shots inherent to the photography, while black levels and contrast remain strong throughout.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Track packs so much punch, your house will probably join the rubble left behind in Moscow. Immersion might even be an understatement - It doesn't matter if we're listening to cars get crunched off the road, or if we're under an audible barrage of bullets flying in every which direction, because every sound effect has been mixed with pinpoint precision and depth. The film packs quite a punch when things really get rough, but impressive dynamics make every shot, crunch, punch and explosion that much more impressive. Dialogue is crystal clear, and environmental ambience is so real, you'll practically feel like you're standing right next to John McClane and son while they're kicking ass. If you want a new action flick to show off your home theatre equipment, you're going to want to give this disc a spin.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Commentary by Director John Moore and First Assistant Director Mark Cotone: Director John Moore has a decent enough chat with first-assistant director Mark Cotone about the production and making a movie to an already established franchise. There's nothing particularly noteworthy in their conversation, but the two provide a nice account of their experience with good technical details. The commentary track is only available on the extended cut of the movie.Making It Hard To Die [60:00] A 15-part making-of doc that exhaustively details the production, from conception to the final post-production touches. With several interviews of cast and crew, the doc shares a variety of worthwhile information about the stunts, special effects, shooting location and the camerawork.Anatomy of a Car Chase [26:00] A detailed look at the amazing car chase through the Moscow streets with interviews that explain the amount of work, planning and preparation done for this one action sequence while keeping CGI to a minimal.Two of a Kind [8:00] A few minutes on the plot's father and son relationship with a variety of comments.Back in Action [7:00] Spotlight moves to Bruce Willis and his reprisal of the John McClane character. It's interesting to give a brief look at how Willis is still able to step in the character's shoes, especially after all these years.The New Face of Evil [7:00] This third promotional documentary in a row, here we get to learn about the three villains.Pre-Vis [12:00] Some CG animatics for some of the film's more demanding sequences. The most interesting thing is watching what could have been, as some of the 'footage' is for a scene that never made it into the film.VFX Sequences [6:00] A collection of 16 action sequences demonstrating the CGI work done.Maximum McClane [3:00] An amusing montage showing the best moments from all of the 'Die Hard' movies.Still Gallery [HD] Two sections are devoted to an assortment of &#34;Storyboards&#34; and &#34;Concept Art Gallery.&#34;Deleted Scenes [HD] It's understandable why most of these scenes were cut. They really would have thrown the 'wham, bam, thank you mam' pace off kilter. The filmmakers were wise to make the choices they did, and there wasn't anything I found myself wishing was in the final product.Trailers [HD] [3:30]Finally, coming after the well-received Live Free or Die Hard, A Good Day to Die Hard is a brilliant action packed film from start to finish and will have you breathless by the time the film credits appear on the screen. There are some totally awesome cool car chases and especially the shoot-em-up sequences, as well as an abundance of high energy in delivering the action where it needs to be. A Good Day to Die Hard is totally entertaining; and it makes me so angry why most pompous critics have panned this film in such a horrible nasty way and they should keep their negative thoughts to themselves. On top of that, 20th Century Fox has put together a fantastic Blu-ray release  &#8212; with an hour-long making-of documentary, a great audio commentary, and several other documentaries &#8212; which I think is a total bonus and why you should purchase this amazing Blu-ray disc package and then it will complete your Die Hard Collection. I totally dispute all the negative reviews I have read and obviously these idiots have been watching a totally different film to me and obviously I must be a lone wolf when it comes to reviewing a film and knowing everyone else is totally wrong in their negative attitude and views. So as far as I am concerned this gets a 10 out 10 star rating and I am totally proud to add this to my Die Hard Blu-ray Collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Andrew C.

A lengthy vehicle chase sequence through the congested streets of Moscow is clearly a CGI cartoon. It and the various shootout scenes are BORING. Worst is the plot: John McLane (Bruce Willis), who throughout the movie says he's in Russia on vacation, falls into a lot of trouble when he helps out his son, a CIA spook. ""Jack"" John McLane Jr. (Jai Courtney) persistently calls his dad by his Christian name. You KNOW that'll change by the fadeout.The plot is confusing, subtitle translations of Russian are too small and disappear too fast. The story's a miasma of cross double-cross that's too tedious to sort out. Best thing about it is a new Rolling Stones song heard during the credit scroll. Amazing that Mick Jagger at nearly 70 can still rock hard.But that's just not enough.

1638433,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B00BUADSMQ,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[2, 6]","Oh, McClane, how far you have fallen.It can be difficult to judge the latest film in a series on its own merits, because it will inevitably be viewed in comparison to the legacy of the films before it.  In the case of A Good Day to Die Hard, what could have been a decent Bruce Willis-fronted action blockbuster on its own crumbles under the weight of the prior, superior films.  In a vacuum, the film is perfect for an hour or two of brainless fun, but when everything accomplished here has been done better in prior films, it leaves the diehard Die Hard fan cold.Where the first film was an excellent pastiche of the disaster movies popular in the 70's, and the then-contemporary 80's action hero, A Good Day to Die Hard plays out as more of an awkward blend of the recent James Bond films and the excesses of modern action video games.  The film still stars Bruce Willis's John McClane - the classic ""cop who's seen a lot"" - finding himself in way over his head, but that's where the similarities end.  This time around, our hero travels to Russia to reunite with his prison-bound estranged son (played almost begrudgingly by Jai Courtney).  Much to McClane Sr.'s surprise, though, his son is not a deadbeat criminal, but a CIA agent undercover working to smuggle a person of interest out of Russia.  McClane manages to quickly derail the entire mission, forcing Jr. and Sr. to team up and find another way out.There is more plot beyond that, but the film loses coherency so quickly that it isn't worth recounting.  Instead, A Good Day to Die Hard throws action scene and setpiece one after another at the viewer in an increasingly thickening flurry of action, like a budget-rate magician trying to disguise the fact that his bag of tricks has run dry.  Cars are driven recklessly.  Guns are shot.  Expendable henchmen are killed en masse.  Half-hearted jokes are made.  Callbacks to previous films are made and forgotten just as quickly.  The meat of the film is this unrelenting pace of frenzied action.  And when all is said and done, it's fairly satisfying.  Leaving aside some occasionally clumsy cinematography, the fights spare no extravagance and are generally entertaining to watch.Less than fun is the truly clumsy exposition and half-hearted acting by the main cast.  The shamelessly convoluted plot of the film serves only to hide the fact that it has more holes in it than McClane's assault rifle has bullets.  This only gets worse as the film goes on.  Courtney seems to only want to collect his paycheck and leave, and Willis appears simply incredulous that he's actually managed to end up in a fifth Die Hard movie at all.  The only halfway interesting character is the mysterious Yuri Komarov (played by Sebastian Koch), the person of interest the two McClane's are attempting to save.  Unfortunately, his character is given little to truly do, and rarely ever allowed to be more than a pawn.In the end, A Good Day to Die Hard is not disappointing because it's big, loud, and dumb.  It's quite good at that.  It's not even that it is inferior to the other films in the series.  What is bothersome about it is that it has no respect for its source material.  The John McClane of this film is not the same one as that of the earlier films.  Instead of the original Die Hard's subtle and mostly realistic world, A Good Day to Die Hard opts for a comic book universe where these men can shrug off a hailstorm of bullets and hundred-foot falls and walk away with a swagger.  The winking references to earlier films come off as cheap and unfunny, and almost ironic, as if the film is ashamed of its much better predecessors.In the context of the larger series it is a part of, A Good Day to Die Hard is a very weak film.  Taken on its own, it's a fun, brainless way to spend a little under two hours.  With that said, one viewing is really all this movie is ever going to be able to offer anyone before they box it away in the attic and watch Die Hard With a Vengeance again instead.  See it, enjoy it, forget it.",2,"McClane?

It was exhilarating and explosive, and McClane, as we would see in the next couple of sequels, was just a regular joe. Someone who was always at the wrong place at the wrong time. He was a blue collar guy who did what he could with what he had. He felt like he could possibly even be us. Sadly, that man is gone.So, what is it about? I'm still not even sure. But really, at this point, does it even matter? It's all about the fun of seeing Bruce and the action. And there is action. There's no plot. John travels to Russia to help his son Jack, who is in a Russian prison, and before you know it, the two are protecting and traveling with a political prisoner with the usual bad guys hot on their heels.Where to start? ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" was a much better movie, but it already started to show the signs that the franchise is not what it was. AGDTDH takes that and completely obliterates any sense of familiarity. If there hadn't been few mentions of ""McClane"", or Bruce uttering his famous line at the end, you wouldn't of known this was a 'Die Hard' movie. It was just a Bruce Willis shoot 'em up that could of been any other number of his movies. McClane has become an indestructible, supernatural creature who is no longer 'one of us'. Not only that, but he seems to care very little for human life, as you can see in the first big chase scene when he is driving over cars and smashing down the tops. He even said ""Sorry"" or something to one lady in a car, but is that good enough? There is a lot of action in the movie, and while some of it is good, most of it is way too over the top for a normal human being. Shoddy CGI in some scenes doesn't help either. In some movies, I may not care as much as this, but this just isn't 'Die Hard'.Now, we come to McClane, Jr. Why was he needed? Why must filmmakers add a partner, or a kid, who is always annoying and more unlikable than the villain? Bruce does it just fine on his own. He doesn't need a sidekick. We don't need daddy issues amongst the action. It may of been okay if it were handled in another, different kind of 'Die Hard' movie, but it felt like padding here. As for Bruce, he may be getting older, but he still has it as an action star. He seemed a little lost in some scenes, but he has enough juice for a few more of these.In the end, there were signs right from the beginning that this was going to be bad. The abbreviated running time was a sign. No big, important action film that is part of a big series is that short. John McClane has hair. Otherwise, it's just Bruce Willis. And, of course, there was the dumping of the movie in February. A month usually reserved for movies the studios just want to drop. ""Die Hard"" is a big summer movie. There were just things wrong from the start that you knew was going to spell bad things about the movie. This isn't John McClane. This isn't Die Hard. I don't know what this movie was. There is another one in the pipeline I hear. I hope they have learned from the mistakes of this movie and send the series out in style, as a valentine to the fans. But this movie?

1638470,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00BUADSMQ,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","The original Diehard was a shocking and imaginative action romp that virtually created the high tension never-say-die action hero role. Bruce Willis made a surprising transition from his light comedy fame in Moonlighting to everyone's favorite tough, wise-cracking off duty cop. It was a huge hit and is still popular today.Sadly no movie in the series has matched the ingenuity or the heart of the original, and each has seemed a step down from the last. The plots have deteriorated to the point where this latest one is almost unintelligible. What does make it through is trite and uninvolving. The bad guy isn't a bad guy long enough to really learn to hate him. The bad guy that we did sort of hate isn't dealt with by the hero. The possible fun of a buddy movie involving McClane and his son can never bear fruit since all they do for most of the movie is spit childish and antagonizing venom at each other.Worst of all, Willis simply looks old and tired in the role. For those of us introduced to him in Moonlighting, who thrilled to Die Hard, seeing the balding gray stubble and constantly pained expression only served to rip apart any effort at nostalgia and replace it with sadness for what has been lost ... both through years and translation.In this plot the bad guys have an evil enough plan ... they want to recover long hidden nuclear material and sell it for millions. But this evil plot is never really sold to the viewer. Instead we get seemingly endless whining by the son about how McClane has ruined a long planned operation. Sorry writers, there is just no viewer investment in that whining. We get one long chase and gun battle scene after another ... none of which have any plausibility whatsoever. People fall dozens of feet with no further injury than cuts and getting dirty. Mere gunshot wounds are quickly forgotten. What they thought were stunning plot reversals are presented weakly with no drama and less forethought.All I can say about this movie is that it was better than the ""Total Recall"" remake, and that isn't any recommendation whatsoever.

No matter how bad the quality of this picture is, something is better than nothing, right?Aside from over-the-top humor (which only comes and goes, sadly enough) and the best Die Hard soundtrack to surface (with the music of both Frank Sinatra and The Rolling Stones!), A Good Day to Die Hard is far from, well, ""a good day to die hard.""Instead, what you have here is a very bad day to die hard........John McClane Sr. may be a legend, but his father Bruce Willis has simply lost his freakin' mind!What I mean by that, I will discuss later in this review. Until then.....here's the basic information for ya.....A Good Day to Die Hard picks right up where Live Free or Die Hard left off: John McClane Sr. is still with the NYPD, still has a positive and restored relationship with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and (as dialogue reveals) personally struggles in the era of Barack Hussein Obama II (his job in the NYPD being mediocre).Coincidentally, the wayward son of A Good Day to Die Hard, meanwhile, has gotten himself in too deep with a Russian political terrorist, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch). He (the character of Jack McClane) is about to face trial and is wanted dead by Russian terrorists for his involvement with Komarov.And I think we'd all agree that Jack becomes a blessed man when his father flies all the way from New York City to Russia to rescue him (forget their problems; John Sr. loves his son and is going to risk his life for him). Well, sadly enough for John, he is risking his life for a brat (every bit of sympathy I felt for Jack going into the picture completely disappeared when he first came onscreen.) Forget the solid, Golden Globe and Academy Award-drama that carried the first four films so mightily. The drama we get here is mostly comprised of ""the F-bomb."" There is no equal sympathy or empathy for the characters this time: they are just obnoxious and lack the artistry that Bruce Willis shared with both Bonnie Bedelia and Samuel L. Jackson in the earlier films.The action, meanwhile, is an impeccable joke: completely unrealistic. Videogame-ish. Sure, I know that in film, there are times when you substitute entertainment for reality and reality for entertainment (I'll give both Willis and Courtney the benefit of the doubt here, as their onscreen relationship mirrors what a real John-Jack McClane relationship would be like). However, with the action, entertainment overshadows reality. With the drama, reality overshadows entertainment. I think we'd all get annoyed by the ""drama"" (okay; Jerry Springer drama), but the action is so unrealistic that a five-year-old could catch onto it.As for what I meant about Bruce Willis ""losing his freakin' mind,"" a few years ago, he gave an interview about the current Die Hard film (when he knew that it was going to be produced). He said in this interview that he wanted to ""take the p*** out of it (DH)."" That explains the absence of the legendary action and drama that held the original four films...Next, WTH? was Willis thinking in picking John Moore to succeed Len Wiseman as director?!??!? The guy's only respected film is Behind Enemy Lines!!!!! Doesn't Moore's several flops as a director wave a red flag to picking Moore as the new DH director!??!?!??Sadly, it didn't, and hopefully Willis learned his lesson from the negative reactions to A Good Day to Die Hard.Three starts ****only***** for the comedy and soundtrack.",3,"""Carry on my wayward son...""",1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,3610,"['only', 'wayward', 'son', 'Jai', 'Courtney', 'character', 'John', 'Jack', 'McClane', 'Jr.', 'had', 'carried', 'Wait', 'objection', 'young', 'Jack', 'had', 'carried', ""'d"", 'have', 'A', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'quality', 'picture', 'something', 'better', 'nothing', 'right', 'Aside', 'over-the-top', 'humor', 'only', 'sadly', 'enough', 'best', 'Die', 'Hard', 'soundtrack', 'surface', 'music', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'far', 'well', 'good', 'day', 'die', 'hard', 'Instead', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'die', 'hard', 'McClane', 'Sr.', 'may', 'be', 'legend', 'father', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'simply', 'lost', 'freakin', 'mind', 'What', 'mean', 'will', 'discuss', 'later', 'review', 'then', 'basic', 'information', 'ya', '..A', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'picks', 'right', 'up', 'where', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'left', 'off', 'John', 'McClane', 'Sr.', 'still', 'NYPD', 'still', 'positive', 'restored', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'dialogue', 'reveals', 'personally', 'era', 'Barack', 'Hussein', 'Obama', 'II', 'job', 'NYPD', 'being', 'mediocre', '.Coincidentally', 'wayward', 'son', 'A', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'meanwhile', 'gotten', 'too', 'deep', 'Russian', 'political', 'terrorist', 'Yuri', 'Komarov', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'character', 'Jack', 'McClane', 'face', 'trial', 'wanted', 'dead', 'Russian', 'terrorists', 'involvement', 'Komarov.And', 'think', ""'d"", 'agree', 'Jack', 'blessed', 'man', 'when', 'father', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Russia', 'rescue', 'forget', 'problems', 'John', 'Sr.', 'son', 'going', 'risk', 'life', 'Well', 'sadly', 'enough', 'John', 'risking', 'life', 'brat', 'bit', 'sympathy', 'felt', 'Jack', 'going', 'picture', 'completely', 'disappeared', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'onscreen', 'Forget', 'solid', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Academy', 'Award-drama', 'carried', 'first', 'four', 'films', 'so', 'mightily', 'drama', 'get', 'here', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'F-bomb', 'equal', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'characters', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'obnoxious', 'lack', 'artistry', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'shared', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'earlier', 'films.The', 'action', 'meanwhile', 'impeccable', 'joke', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'Videogame-ish', 'Sure', 'know', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'substitute', 'entertainment', 'reality', 'reality', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Willis', 'Courtney', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'here', 'onscreen', 'relationship', 'mirrors', 'what', 'real', 'John-Jack', 'McClane', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'However', 'action', 'entertainment', 'overshadows', 'reality', 'drama', 'reality', 'entertainment', 'think', ""'d"", 'get', 'annoyed', 'drama', 'okay', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'drama', 'action', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'five-year-old', 'could', 'catch', 'it.As', 'what', 'meant', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'losing', 'freakin', 'mind', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'gave', 'interview', 'current', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'when', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'produced', 'said', 'interview', 'wanted', 'take', 'p***', 'DH', 'absence', 'legendary', 'action', 'drama', 'held', 'original', 'four', 'films', 'Next', 'WTH', 'was', 'Willis', 'thinking', 'picking', 'John', 'Moore', 'succeed', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'director', 'guy', 'only', 'respected', 'film', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', ""n't"", 'Moore', 'several', 'flops', 'director', 'wave', 'red', 'flag', 'picking', 'Moore', 'new', 'DH', 'director', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hopefully', 'Willis', 'learned', 'lesson', 'negative', 'reactions', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard.Three', '****only*****', 'comedy', 'soundtrack']",N/A

This movie is one of those movies that you watch and wonder if they filmed it first, then tried to come up with a story!  The main plot to the film seems to have been use the usual action movie cliches such as take a prisoner and be on the run throughout the film, bad guys shoot everything and everyone up but chose to beat up the heroes in order to give them a chance to escape, and lots of shooting and destruction!This film's main goal reminded me of 'Bad Boys II' in that the story was thrown out of the window in favor of crashing, shooting or blowing up everything in site.  I HATE when film producers do this and think that we should love it because they are destroying luxury vehicles.  In one scene, the armored truck was clearly intentionally destroy every car in it's path for no reason at all except the producer or director thought that it would be exciting.  I swear, whoever made this must have been a rich dude who knows nothing about film-making but wanted to be hands-on to act like he knows.The dialog and the pace of the film along with it's sleep inducing formula reminded me of 'The Hangover II' and it's lines that the audience assumes to be jokes - but they were not funny one bit and the timing was off!  There was not real relationship between father and son although they superficially tried to establish one, mainly because they felt that they had to.  In this Die Hard film, we do not care about any of the characters and we do not care if John McClean survived or got killed, just as long as the film was done.There comes a time when artists should know when to end something and when to continue them.  With the Marvel films, they came from comic books with over decades of stories, so they can keep making those.  When it comes to Die Hard, you have to end it when the main character is looking elderly with only the energy of a 35 year old.  The first three Die Hard films were great and classic, but the forth one was fair, and this one deserve a negative one in score.  This is one of those films that should not have been made.  They need to stop it now as the one classic series has gone the way of ""Death Wish,"" ""Friday the 13th"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" with endless sequels, one more foolish than the last.  These are not James Bond films you know.Bruce Willis has had a string of flops that rank as some of the worst films ever made (""Cop Out"" anyone?), and this Die hard adds to that collection.  This film is a combination of ""I am Legend"" for boredom with no build up or climax, ""Bad Boys II"" for lots of destruction without a plot, and ""The Hangover II"" for it's horrible jokes and horrible sequel.  I just don't understand (besides money grabs) how someone could view this garbage and green light this as a movie maker except in name recognition.  I waited for almost 40 minutes waiting for that 'moment' where I would become interested in the film, but it never came.Bruce Willis, like Stallone, is too old for this kind of thing.  They should both take cues from Russell Crowe and play more dramatic parts, but still be seen as a tough guy, only without the action.  Willis has done it before, although I am not sure Stallone could pull it off, but these senior citizen action heroes are the joke of Hollywood!

1638500,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00BUADSMQ,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","The ""Die Hard"" series continues. It is safe to say, while all of the ""Die Hard"" movies have been good, none of them held a candle to the original. The series has lasted five films on the strength of what was probably the best or one of the best action movies of all time. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" won't be changing that. Not even close. ""Die Hard"" had too many elements that have been forgotten in its following films. The most important being that John McClane didn't defeat the large number of terrorists by acting like the Terminator. He did it by using his brain. He outsmarted them. He got into their heads and made them make mistakes. He did dangerous things, but they were all feasible, or at least somewhat humanly possible.""A Good Day to Die Hard"" brings back a little bit of that human element as McClane learns that his son, Jack (Jai Courtney) is in some sort of trouble in Russia. They are estranged, but John is determined to stand beside him in his time of need or try to patch things up. His son isn't so happy to see him and once they are together, John is hurdled into his son's life and situation like you would expect, with guns blazing and cars crashing.At the end of ""Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard"", John McClane faces off against a F-35 that basically annihilates a highway intersection and then somehow he ends up on the wing of the plane, balancing, surviving like Spiderman and in that moment, the series died to me. The series had lowered itself to the worst common denominator of action films in the 21st century. Thankfully, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" redeemed itself on that level; somewhat. There is at least nothing THAT silly. Sure, there were some crazy things, even a pretty unrealistic and poorly staged scene where McClane drives over cars in a traffic jam, but nothing as bad as the F-35.The action scenes are good in this movie. Yet, after watching something like ""Skyfall"" from earlier this year, ""Die Hard"" sort looks dated and like yesterday's action movie. The story is pretty simple; of course so were the stories in all the other movies. You don't want to confuse the audience when all they want is carnage. Unfortunately though, in my humble opinion, carnage is overrated if you don't feel invested.""A Good Day to Die Hard"" did a lot of things right or at least turned the corner in the right direction, but it still is just an average action movie in today's new standard. There will always be a box office for action movies and I don't blame people for going to see this or buy it. Although, the real test of a great action movie is whether or not it will be talked and reviewed about 5 or 10 years from now, like ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon 1 & 2"", ""Aliens"", ""Skyfall"", ""True Lies"", ""48 Hours"" or ""Terminator 1&2"". ""A Good Day to Die Hard""...  won't.There just wasn't enough in ""Good Day to Die Hard"" to make your heart race and feel invested as if your own life depended upon McClane succeeding like in ""Die Hard"". Unfortunately the makers of the ""Die Hard"" movies forgot that the success of the series was more attributed to the line, ""Tell her that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, she never heard me say I'm sorry.""

But for me as a fan of the ""Die Hard"" franchise, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" satified me in the two basic areas that have made this franchise successful 1. Bruce Willis and 2. The Action.  John McClane isn't any different here than he's been in the earlier installments.  Now Sure, having McClane Sr. go to Russia would've worked better as a possible set-up for a ""Bourne"" film and even the (supposely now cancelled ) ""24"" movie ( it's just been a little more than 3 years since the show went off, I'm not entirely bought that the movie is dead yet, that is until ""Touch"" gets canceled this season, I mean the show is in the friday fox time slot which everyone knows is death for any tv series and Kiefer Sutherland's schedule will be clear after he does Paul W.S. Anderson ""Pompli"" or whatever flick, but this can all be saved for another article). Back to ""Die Hard 5"", the Russia backdrop didn't really bother me ( but don't get me wrong the set-up to ""Olympus has Fallen"" or ""White House Down"" would've worked more effectively for ""Die Hard 5"" but are we not forgetting that John McClane battled terrorist in  D. C. in both ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" and "" Live Free or Die Hard"" so that's kinda been there done now.) Jai Counrtney didn't bother either as Jack aka John Jr., though personally I wanted someone like Joshua Jackson to play John's son.  The chemistery between Joshua Jackson and Bruce Willis could've been dynamite.  With five installments made, and just one more to go (possibly coming out in maybe 2017).  For fans of the franchise I see "" A Good Day to Die Hard"" being seen as the ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" of this franchise for our hero but even they still made "" Star Trek VI: The Unidiscovered Country"" after ""Frontier"" and all was forgiven.  I personally think that if ""Live Free"" had Lucy McClane and ""A Good Day"" has John Jr. then ""Die Hard 6"" should be about Bruce Willis' John McClane retiring, battling terrorists one more time, and having his whole family ( including his divorced wife, Holly) there when he goes out in a blaze of glory. Of course not having the whole family wiping ass with guns and all. (Laughs) And one more thing even though John Moore didn't bother too much (even though I'm not necessarily a fan of the guy's work, though I've enjoyed ""Behind Enemy Lines"" on repeated viewings), how about asking John Mcteiran to get back behind the camera (working out some kind of arrangement with his jail sentence) for Die Hard 6 and... (drumroll) Shane Black be approach to write the script for Die Hard 6 ( or direct it if Mcteiran is unavailable).  Black will have some fun with the seasoned John McClane.

Except, really, McClane Jr. is a secret agent, and he's trying to stop a bunch of political terrorists from gathering a whole lot of--you guessed it!--nuclear weaponry.  And of course, when Daddy finds out, he's gotta show his kid how they do it in Dixie.  Er, New York.Bruce Willis is back, of course.  He looks and feels tired, but he's still fun to watch; the guy's still got acting and action chops, even if both are rather lacking here.  Jai Courtney, who gave a great villainous turn in 2012's JACK REACHER, doesn't have much to do here; his character is by-the-numbers, and takes a back seat to daddy.Yet, the surprising thing here is that even Willis seems to be a supporting character in his own film.  The outlandish script and over-the-top (in a bad way) action stunts hog too much of the spotlight.  Even Rasha Buckvic, giving us a love-to-hate villain, finds his character undercut in the inevitable third-act twist (which you can see coming, and is not at all satisfying when it arrives, except for the solid performance of Sebastian Koch).  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD feels like an ordinary, direct-to-DVD action film that some producer got ahold of and said, ""Hey, I want to make a DIE HARD sequel, let's squeeze John McClane into this.""  If you're a true fan of the series, you probably owe it to yourself to give it a shot,  That being said, I absolutely love the first three films, and can tolerate the second, and the only reason I went to see this is because a friend wanted to, and I was bored.

The original was, and is, a classic; each succeeding Die Hard film merely ratchets up the suspension of disbelief with outrageous stories, unbelievable villains, and protagonist John McClane becoming a virtual cartoon character as he overcomes impossible, death-defying predicaments.Enter the latest burnt toast offering:  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.  Here we have Bruce Willis's McClane heading for Russia to supposedly go to the aid of his estranged son, Jack (a bored looking Jai Courtney), who is on Death Row.  But there's a twist:  Jack is actually an undercover CIA operative, and he's feverishly working to get a political prisoner (Sebastian Koch) out of the country--a prisoner who can finger the head of the Russian mob.  Predictably there are sudden twists and turns as to whom the actual villain is, and as this turkey limps to its Herculean over-the-top ending (here's a hint:  a bobtail truck taking down a military helicopter), John and Jack are put through the paces by director John Moore, who has them plunging out of windows and through scaffolding and into dumpsters and most-convenient pools of murky water.  We even have our heroes journey to Chernobyl and endure that stifling radioactive environment sans protective gear.  Obviously the McClanes are invincible to serious injury; but they are susceptible to making silly movies.Bruce Willis looks old and tired, and has nada chemistry with Courtney.  The plot, the pacing, are lame pizza supreme, with a contrived, sappy ending thrown in allegedly to make us feel good.

1638581,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00BUADSMQ,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[6, 15]","The first four ""Die Hard"" films have something in common. No, not the fact that things blow up, or that Bruce Willis is going to say funny things. Underneath all of the explosions, gunshots, and profanity lies a strong character, interesting plots, and memorable set pieces. This is why it is incredibly disheartening that I saw ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" less than 24 hours ago, yet can barely remember any of it. There were some explosions, a helicopter... maybe Willis said something funny once? Perhaps twice?I'm not quite sure, but what I am sure of is that this is one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Everybody involved should be embarrassed about this miserable abomination of a film, and request that it be removed from their resume. The plot is garbage, it's xenophobic and homophobic, and to top it all off, the action isn't even inspired. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a disgrace to a once great franchise.We kick things off with John McClane searching for his son in Russia, who was magically never mentioned for four films. In that span of time, John McClane Jr. (ooh, original!) has apparently become a degenerate and been thrown in prison. But as we quickly find out, he's actually a CIA Agent! And Bruce Willis has to help him, but is employing meatheaded tactics for espionage missions! It's a giant culture clash! Oh, the hilarious shenanigans! Mix it up with some classic ""American trying to speak a foreign language"" and ""like father, like son"" gags, add in some monosyllabic tough guy dialogue, and you've got a surefire recipe for cinematic gold.Except you don't. The story in this movie is the narrative equivalent of an overflowed gutter: you're seeing nothing but ugly mush of something that was maybe, at some point, kind of pretty. Dialogue is simplistic and unfunny, the narrative is derivative and moronic, and there's a disgusting gay stereotype of a character. Nothing even remotely original occurs in the span of this film, and I feel genuinely sorry for Willis and all others involved having to participate in a movie that was seemingly penned by a third-grader with access to the internet.However, something about the story is more infuriating than the rest of it, and it deserves note: the villains. Namely, the fact that their goal is never stated. All we know is that they are Russian, and that they might want uranium. No, really, that's it. That's all they give us. We're just supposed to assume that a Russian scientist wants uranium left in Chernobyl for nefarious purposes, for no reason other than the fact that he's a Russian scientist. Oh, and there's the little fact that the American father and son beat out the Russian father and daughter, therefore adding sexism onto the laundry list of this film's dubious achievements.But maybe you don't care about plot. Maybe you're in it for big-budget action. Well, get ready for disappointment, because the action sequences are some of the most dull and uninspired I've ever seen. Yawn with apathy as Bruce Willis defies physics in a car! Play ""Angry Birds"" as he jumps off a thirty story building and lives! And go to the bathroom as a villain falls into a vertically-rotating helicopter blade as it traverses a horizontal plane! Heck, while you're in there, you might as well stay out and go home, because this trash won't get any better.What really tops it off is that the budget feels nonexistent. The cinematography is a joke, some shots looking like they might as well be stock footage. The overused CGI is pretty hokey too, becoming downright cheesy and ludicrous about halfway throughout the movie. That is, if you haven't fallen asleep already, which the grating and jarring sound effects will try to prevent quite frequently. On a technical level, this movie is a joke, and makes me actually want to sit through a Michael Bay movie because of how terrible it is.Some may think this review indicates that I hate plotless action movies, and I'll have you know that I love the ""Expendables"" franchise, and pretty much anything with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Statham taking the top billing. This movie has not earned my ire because it is an action movie with no plot; it's earned it because it's an action movie with poor action and a plot that tries to be emotionally engaging but fails in a spectacular fashion. This is insipid cinematic garbage of the lower caliber, and should put a nail in the coffin of writer Skip Woods, whose past credits includes the awful ""Hitman"" film.Now, I laughed my way through this movie, so if you want to pay ten bucks to laugh at how terrible a film is, then by all means, go see this. But if you want to go see it because you have fond memories of the old films, then you deserve to know that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a failure on every possible level. It is a bottom-of-the-barrel carnival ride with an awful plot and lame action sequences, with no funny one-liners or interesting villains to speak of. When the year ends, I have a strong feeling that this will be a surefire candidate to take the Razzy for ""Worst Picture.""Perhaps John McClane needs to ""yippee ki-yay"" into the sunset... and a

1638595,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BUADSMQ,FNDNreview,"[4, 11]","Bruce Willis returns to the Die Hard franchise in the fifth installment, A Good Day to Die Hard.  This time around, John McClane is off to Russia to give his son, Jack (Jai Courtney), more support as he awaits trial for carrying out an assassination.  Undercover for the CIA, Jack is secretly trying to rescue a political prisoner, Yuri (Sebastian Koch) &#8211; who is supposedly in possession of a file (hold incriminating evidence) to put a corrupt Russian official, Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov), behind bars.  However, when Jack comes face to face with his father, he couldn&#8217;t be any less happier to see him.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead also returns to the series as McClane&#8217;s daughter, Lucy.Oh, where to begin with this mess of a film&#8230;  Unlike the previous sequels in the Die Hard franchise, this newest addition is a complete and utter disaster from beginning to end, serving no other purpose than to shoot guns, create explosions, and have a ridiculous car chase.  From pitiful, shaky camera work to forced dialogue with poor one-liners, this film is easily the worst in the franchise.  It&#8217;s not very often that poor editing is comparable to Michael Bay&#8217;s Armageddon, but this newest Die Hard certainly brings up those bad memories of too many cut scenes messed together, which easily creates the potential for a very bad headache.  And, if the constant cut scenes don&#8217;t do it, then there&#8217;s a good chance having to read a fair amount of subtitles will make it happen.As usual, there&#8217;s no need to focus too much on the acting in an action film of this nature.  In fact, if Bruce Willis had a stuntman even remotely resembling his face, there&#8217;d be no need for Bruce to be on set at all.  This film features so little dialogue from Willis that it will almost make you wonder how many millions he makes per word.  To be fair, it&#8217;s really difficult to add smart dialogue into a film that fills most of its gaps with bullets and grenade blasts.  However, in true Willis fashion, he does roll out a few humorous one-liners that will create a brief chuckle &#8211; most of which happen during those stressful, dire situations where your average person would no doubt be in the middle of a panic attack or searching for the nearest escape route.The absolute biggest problem with the film is the lack of a serious, credible villain.  Looking back at the rest of the Die Hard films, we are blessed with Alan Rickman, William Sadler, Jeremy Irons, and Timothy Olyphant &#8211; yet in this film we get some random Russian (without any real backstory) that, in the end, tries (poorly) to be Jack&#8217;s version of Hans Gruber.  Obviously, this shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a spoiler since it&#8217;s unrealistic to believe the villain doesn&#8217;t get what&#8217;s coming to him by the time the credits role.  Never the less, the need for a more melicious villain is at the top of the list on the long list of complaints regarding this fifth installment.  Perhaps more time should have been spent establishing a dramatic plot &#8211; as in the previous films &#8211; and this might have been a more enjoyable experience.Lastly, it should be noted that the ending of this film raises a great many questions about the franchise&#8217;s future.  Jai Courtney is a relatively unknown actor (as was Willis at one time), so it&#8217;s possible the reigns might be in the process of being handed over to him.  It&#8217;s a logical conclusion since Jack McClane&#8217;s real name is purposely stated in the film as being &#8220;John McClane Jr.&#8221;  Of course, it&#8217;s too early to say whether or not this will be the final film in the franchise, but in the event that it is &#8211; this is really not the way you&#8217;ll want to see John McClane go out.

1638614,A3GQXLVWTJLARH,B00BUADSMQ,Gordo the Gatling Gun,"[2, 2]","I must add a few criteria here:  First off, I am quite fond of the Die Hard films--I still consider the original to be the best and a genuinely great bit of fun from beginning to end.  And while Die Hard 2 is essentially more of the same thing, the further sequels always added something new and entertaining to the table.And then we get to A Good Day to Die Hard, and it doesn't please me to tell you guys this, but not only is this by far the worst entry in the Die Hard series, it's also one of the worst action movies I've ever seen.  I will not dare attempt to sum of what passes here for a plot here because frankly, the movie doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  No attempt to make any sense is ever made.  Ever.  It's a film filled with explosive setpieces and heavy expository dialogue trying desperately to explain to us what is going on, and doesn't give us any straight answers.  It's pretentiously vague, and at 98 minutes, feels closer to 2 hours (thankfully, it doesn't feel much longer than that).  And it comes off rather like the people who were putting the film together were just making it up as they went.The script was written by Skip Woods, who also wrote the scripts for Swordfish, Hitman, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and The A-Team, which more than explains why nothing about this film makes any sense and feels made up as it went on.  Director John Moore was also the director of Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix, Max Payne, and the remake of The Omen, which in turn explains why the film is humorless, witless, and pretentious to the enth degree.  Combining the talents of two such hacks, it's a miracle that Bruce Willis's John McClane is still left in tact and in respect to the character at large.  The only other actor worth mentioning is Jai Courtney as John ''Jack'' McClane Jr., who is a CIA secret agent stationed in Moscow, and is an arrogant little baffoon, who tries and fails miserably at giving out one-liners.  Everyone else is forgettable.One would be more than willing to throw suspension of disbelief out the window with these action set pieces if they were entertaining, but they are not.  The worst part about this film--and indeed, the worst trait of any real action film, especially a Die Hard film?  It's boring.  Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring!  One's ethusiasm for the franchise dampens somewhat after hearing from Bruce Willis himself that there is still one more movie to go before the franchise comes to a close.  With any luck, it will more than make up for the sins of this entry, so there still exists a small sliver of hope.There's very little of merit in this film.  But given that--while defanged and not as witty or engaging as in past installments--John McClane still remains faithful to who he was, and Bruce Willis still gives a good, but aged performance, this film is more than spared a rare 0 out of 10--John McClane here is an 8, and as such, one of the most important characteristics of this series remains in good condition.  Thus, A Good Day to Die Hard is a 2.",2,"A complete mess of a movie.

Thorp is still given credit in the titles of the characters despite the fact that he died in 1999. But Bruce Willis lives on and in the current version he encounters his son (played by the very talented and hunky Jai Courtney) and the action is doubled.John Mclane (Bruce Willis, aging well) has been a New York City and a Los Angeles cop who somehow always has explosions in the air and on the ground in every undertaking. But now, the take-no-prisoners cop, for the first time, finds himself on foreign soil after traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son Jack (Jai Courtney) - unaware that Jack is really a highly-trained CIA operative out to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McClanes discover that their opposing methods make them unstoppable heroes.The cast tosses in bit parts by Sebastian Koch and Yuliya Snigir as the father daughter Russians with a secret, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, Amaury Nolasco, Cole Hauser as the CIA good guys, Rasha Bukvic, Sergei Kolesnikov, Roman Lukn&aacute;r as the Russian bad guys, and particularly funny Pasha D. Lychnikoff as a singing Cabbie.As directed by John Moore with a minimal script by Skip Woods this is a very noisy, megalomaniacal destruction derby of cars absurd and annoying to the max!), fire explosion mess of a film, but then it IS a Die Hard genre piece and the interplay between Willis and Courtney make it fun to observe how close to the tree the apple falls!

Sure enough, I was right. The latest entry in the Die Hard series is reminiscent of the first three films in terms of content, only that the violence is more graphic, and the language is tempered down a bit. However, never fear. John McClane's signature phrase is uncensored this time around (unlike the fourth film, where it was inexplicably toned down for a PG-13 rating, though there was still some moderate-to-strong profanity that should have earned it an R-rating).The plot of the fifth film isn't as strong as ""Die Hard"" and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance,"" but it's definitely much better than ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" and the actor playing the main villain may not be as well-known as Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons, but he still did a good job. Shame that the great Michael Kamen (who scored the first three movies, plus all of the ""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""Licence To Kill,"" ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" and Disney's ""The Three Musketeers"") is no longer with us to provide another great score for another ""Die Hard"" movie.My only quibbles are with the profaning of God's Name (i.e., combining the Name of God with a mild profanity, thereby turning it into a strong religious profanity; God saith, ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord Thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain."") and for some reason, several scene extensions and at least one scene in the trailer were not in the movie. Why is that scenes in a trailer are cut from the movie before theatrical release? and the so-called ""Extended Cut"" is not really an extended cut, as Mary Elizabeth Winnstead is cut from the film in that version, and the additions are insignificant. The movie should have had a stronger script, ala Die Hard or Die Hard With A Vengeance.Yippee-ki-yay. My ranking of the ""Die Hard"" movies is as follows.I. ""Die Hard""II.

I love foreign languages, and I want to speak Russian someday, but when I'm relaxing, (1) I don't want to have to read subtitles. (2) The subtitles went too fast, and I consider myself both literate and a speed reader. (3) It was frustrating when the Russians were speaking English because whenever I let my guard down (laid down), I had to sit up and read more subtitles. Pick a language! Realistically most Europeans nowadays speak English so it wouldn't have been a stretch for the Russians to speak English throughout the movie.(4) Did the producers get a subsidy for filming in Russia? It's great to have most of the movie take place in Russia, but could we see more of Russia versus only the destruction of property? The director could have made his point without having a 30 minute (?) worth of scenes trampling over people and cars. Really, is that what you want us to take away from voyeuristically being in Russia? That Russian people are to be trampled all over without regard or consequence for their safety. I did NOT like the subliminal messages from this movie at all.(5) Did the producers get a kickback for using Mercedes? For a person who likes Mercedes to see Mercedes after Mercedes destroyed was sickening! How about donate a car or two to a charity? I didn't count the number of cars, including Mercedes, destroyed, but it had to be in the hundreds if not thousands. Ridiculous! The $100 million dollar budget went mostly to the destruction of property.(5) Jack was so disrespectful towards his father. What messages are we sending to others? That Americans don't know how to treat their elders with respect?(6) At least with &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; movies there's a believable plot and believable elements. You're surrounded by ******SPOILER ALERT******radiation and you don't get sick? PLA - LEASSSSE! So the producer(s) got a subsidy (guessing and speculation) for filming in Russia. Really? The script writer couldn't think of anything better than uranium coming out of Chernobyl and double cross upon double cross?(7) We, the viewing audience, purposefully selected the extended cut - it only contained two minutes at most (guessing). The total movie was 97 minutes. If I had seen this in theaters, I most likely would have demanded my money back. It was too short and when it ended, there wasn't closure. There were too many lose ends. So the CIA doesn't have anything to say about the discovery of uranium? There could have been more finesse.(8) I have to credit/blame the director for this movie being a flop despite bringing in $300 million. I hope the next movie isn't directed by whoever this director was (I can't remember), but you can tell that this is another movie entirely.

1638634,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00BUADSMQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 4]","""A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is a bad day at the theater,"" sneered my snobby pal, and I felt like disowning him. But, okay, the law of diminishing returns does apply here. Twenty-five years since the release of the best Christmas movie of all time (and, yes, cretin, I mean DIE HARD), A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD ranks fifth in the series, in chronology and in excellence. I am a shameless DIE HARD apologist, but even I don't hesitate to say that this one disappoints on key levels. It is, essentially, a generic Bruce Willis action movie masquerading as a DIE HARD movie.It's been more than five years since the last one (LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, 2007). Them powers-that-be must've thought that the franchise still had legs, and, of course, they're not wrong. The classic first film had built up such good cachet that as long as Willis is willing to make more sequels, folks will flock to the theaters. But there's real jeopardy that the franchise is getting run to the ground. If it hasn't happened already.Indestructible everyman - and that oxymoron is a problem right there - John McClane hears word that his estranged son, Jake, is in trouble in Russia and he immediately books a flight. In Moscow, John McClane reunites with Jake (Jai Courtney) and learns that his son is an undercover CIA operative currently safeguarding a government whistleblower from a corrupt Russian official. Cue the explosions and car chases and the close shaves and the half-hearted banter, with Willis and Courtney striving for - and mostly failing to achieve - a measure of chemistry. With my mindset forever locked on this view that Bruce Willis is irreproachable, I put the blame on the writers.There's a bit of a renaissance of the old school Rated R action thriller, what with this picture and also Schwarzenegger's recent THE LAST STAND and Stallone's BULLET TO THE HEAD. Of the three, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD exhibits the most impressive box office punch. Of course, there's this understanding that if this had been a non-DIE HARD Bruce Willis project, it's doubtful that it would've raked in as much profit. As a generic action film, it serves the nondiscriminating viewer. But if you'd been spoiled by how good the first DIE HARD was, then this is a dumbed down sequel, empty of nuances of character and devoid of the smarts and wicked humor that graced the original. The villains are so cardboard they should be propped up on the Santa Monica Pier for bystander photo ops. I pine for Hans Gruber.The most egregious offense is the treatment of John McClane who is now a pale imitation of his old self. Willis is a terrific actor. He's good enough that there are still traces of the humanity and the snark and the everyman appeal that won over critics and fans 25 years ago. Still, when he finally voices his trademark phrase, it doesn't feel like the film had earned it. There's enough popcorn fun in this one that I don't mind rating it 3 out of 5 stars. A present day sequel that is a shadow of its source material. But nostalgia is a powerful thing.As a continuity fiend I appreciate Mary Elizabeth Winstead's cameo as Lucy McClane.Also, I want whatever magical GPS device the McClanes used to navigate from Moscow to the Ukraine in the span of an evening.",3,"Yippie ki-yay, Mother Russia!",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,3239,"['GOOD', 'DAY', 'TO', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'bad', 'day', 'theater', 'sneered', 'snobby', 'pal', 'felt', 'disowning', 'okay', 'law', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'apply', 'here', 'Twenty-five', 'years', 'release', 'best', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'time', 'yes', 'cretin', 'mean', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'GOOD', 'DAY', 'TO', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'fifth', 'series', 'chronology', 'excellence', 'am', 'shameless', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'apologist', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'say', 'one', 'disappoints', 'key', 'levels', 'essentially', 'generic', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'action', 'movie', 'masquerading', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'movie.It', 'been', 'more', 'five', 'years', 'last', 'one', 'LIVE', 'FREE', 'OR', 'DIE', 'HARD', '2007', 'Them', 'powers-that-be', 'must', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'franchise', 'still', 'had', 'legs', 'course', ""'re"", 'not', 'wrong', 'classic', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'such', 'good', 'cachet', 'as', 'long', 'Willis', 'willing', 'make', 'more', 'sequels', 'folks', 'will', 'flock', 'theaters', 'real', 'jeopardy', 'franchise', 'getting', 'run', 'ground', ""n't"", 'happened', 'already.Indestructible', 'everyman', 'oxymoron', 'problem', 'right', 'there', 'John', 'McClane', 'word', 'estranged', 'son', 'Jake', 'trouble', 'Russia', 'immediately', 'books', 'flight', 'Moscow', 'John', 'McClane', 'Jake', 'Jai', 'Courtney', 'son', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'operative', 'currently', 'safeguarding', 'government', 'whistleblower', 'corrupt', 'Russian', 'official', 'Cue', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'close', 'shaves', 'half-hearted', 'banter', 'Willis', 'Courtney', 'striving', 'mostly', 'failing', 'achieve', 'measure', 'chemistry', 'mindset', 'forever', 'locked', 'view', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'irreproachable', 'put', 'blame', 'writers.There', 'bit', 'renaissance', 'old', 'school', 'Rated', 'R', 'action', 'thriller', 'what', 'picture', 'also', 'Schwarzenegger', 'recent', 'THE', 'LAST', 'STAND', 'Stallone', 'BULLET', 'TO', 'THE', 'HEAD', 'three', 'GOOD', 'DAY', 'TO', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'most', 'impressive', 'box', 'office', 'punch', 'course', 'understanding', 'had', 'been', 'non-DIE', 'HARD', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'project', 'doubtful', 'would', ""'ve"", 'raked', 'as', 'much', 'profit', 'generic', 'action', 'film', 'nondiscriminating', 'viewer', ""'d"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'how', 'good', 'first', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'was', 'then', 'dumbed', 'sequel', 'empty', 'nuances', 'character', 'devoid', 'smarts', 'wicked', 'humor', 'graced', 'original', 'villains', 'are', 'so', 'cardboard', 'should', 'be', 'propped', 'up', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'Pier', 'bystander', 'photo', 'pine', 'Hans', 'Gruber.The', 'most', 'egregious', 'offense', 'treatment', 'John', 'McClane', 'who', 'now', 'pale', 'imitation', 'old', 'self', 'Willis', 'terrific', 'actor', 'good', 'enough', 'are', 'still', 'traces', 'humanity', 'snark', 'everyman', 'appeal', 'won', 'critics', 'fans', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Still', 'when', 'finally', 'trademark', 'phrase', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'had', 'earned', 'enough', 'popcorn', 'fun', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'rating', '3', '5', 'stars', 'present', 'day', 'sequel', 'shadow', 'source', 'material', 'nostalgia', 'powerful', 'thing.As', 'continuity', 'fiend', 'appreciate', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'cameo', 'Lucy', 'McClane.Also', 'want', 'magical', 'GPS', 'device', 'McClanes', 'used', 'navigate', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', 'span', 'evening']",N/A

The younger generation has used Live Free or Die Hard as the standard for which these films are supposed to be living up to, and the older generation expects not only the world out of these films, but has forgotten what they are about. Why has this film gotten bad reviews? Is it because the film was truly bad and unwatchable? Is it because of Bruce Willis's pro-gun views? The latter seems to make the most sense. I mean, Live Free or Die Hard had a ridiculously positive critical reception, given how awful it was. How did this film get panned so badly? This was a great Die Hard movie. My brother agreed it was great too. I have no idea how someone could leave this film not entertained. McClane's humor and personality are back. The ridiculous, over-the-top action is back. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges, but it works.I don't know what more people expect from movies. Rotten Tomatoes wasn't around back in the 80's and early 90's. People generally relied on their local critics and a few magazines, who generally varied in terms of impressions. Now, people base their impressions of a movie on the websites and think that if they disagree, something is wrong with them. Nothing is wrong with questioning the Emperor, people.I go to movies to be entertained, not to find the next Oscar winner. The Academy is giving Ben Affleck awards for Best Picture, and awful actresses like Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry awards as well.

But because of Bruce Willis's portrayal of McClane's heart and soul, his wit and humor, and his never-say-die attitude, he has prevailed against these odds and these evil people, initially threatening a building, then an airport, then a whole city, and then a nation. But now it's time for John McClane to go on vacation. Unfortunately for him, it's to Russia to bail out his ""criminal"" son (Jai Courtney of SPARTACUS and JACK REACHER, and was quite good in both, but not so much here).And unfortunately for us, this little vacation abroad proves that the DIE HARD franchise has outlived its usefulness as both a successful franchise in both a monetary and artistic sense as director John Moore (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, the 2006 OMEN remake, MAX PAYNE) creates easily one of the worst films of the year and certainly the worst film (and stupidest title) of this once-revered franchise with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.The shark was somewhat jumped when John McClane and his slacker/hacker sidekick had to save the US of A from super-cyberterrorism in the Len Wiseman-helmed LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, but it's still an effective and entertaining film (with the exception of the McClane vs. Jet Fighter sequence). But with GOOD DAY, the film is a series of one ridiculous action sequence after another that effectively destroys EVERYTHING lovable and relatable about John McClane. Sure, McClane has a few decent quips and still is his weary self, but he is now elevated to a status of God-like proportions, plowing through cars and blowing away bad guys in a foreign country without consequences and falling from great heights through wooden catwalks with barely a scratch. This was once a man who, before jumping off the roof of a 40-story building with only a fire hose tied around him to support him, took a moment for a prayer (""Oh, God, please don't let me die!""). He knew he was human. He knew he was fallible. And these are faults and weaknesses that have stayed with him for most of the films, but now, he's willing to jump through windows, assured he will land and still live because he has become invincible. This is NOT John McClane.This is not just the fault of Willis, who is clearly just cashing a check here as he sleepwalks through this film, and it's not just the fault of the writer Skip Woods (whose previous credits include a slew of sub-par actioners like SWORDFISH, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, THE A-TEAM and HITMAN), and it's not just the fault of director Moore, who has shown throughout his career that he's very satisfied with creating films that more closely resemble open-air video games than films that have any hint of decent plotting or style or understanding of character. This is a failure on an institutional level. Fox Studios has a very proud history of taking once-great genre franchises and turning them to intolerable garbage (see ALIEN, PREDATOR, STAR WARS, etc.), and this is only the latest. And as long as we keep giving them money for these films, they will continue to release them.The rest is up to the audience now. Do yourself a favor and don't buy into the positive reviews here. I can certainly understand and appreciate seeing and loving a film that has almost as many negative reviews as positive, because certain films are meant to be polarizing.

It's been twenty-five years since the first ""Die Hard,"" but Bruce Willis is still up to playing John McClane in another nonstop action film. In my opinion, A Good Day to Die Hard is as entertaining as any of the first four in the series, if for no other reason than a chase scene that rivals the classic chase scenes in films like The French Connection, Bullitt, Terminator 3, and The Matrix: Reloaded. It's a humdinger, with more vehicles being destroyed than I could count.Even approaching sixty years old, Willis is still marvelous at playing the role of NYPD detective John McClane. This time, we meet his son John Jr., played by Jai Courtney. When Junior, a CIA agent, is arrested in Russia, John Sr. flies to Moscow to help him. As John Sr. approaches the courthouse where Junior is testifying as a witness in a criminal trial, all hell breaks loose, and soon both of the McClanes and a Russian, Yuri Komarov, are on the run, first to escape the bad guys, then on an unlikely and perilous trip to Chernobyl to foil the bad guys' plot. Yuliya Snigir adds some eye candy to the film, but it's basically a fast-paced good-guys-versus-the-bad-guys story with no romantic interludes to slow down the action. The climactic scene involving a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter is as spectacular as any scene in the Die Hard series.The bottom line: After five episodes, the Die Hard franchise is still in great shape. No, it may not be great drama or high cinematic art, but it's entertaining enough to fill up the movie theaters for a few weeks.

Its not a bad movie, but it didn't feel the same anymore. Some people might say its because of Bruce Willis age, but he did pretty well and I don't feel like that hurt the movie. I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that said the acting was off a bit. All the Die Hard's have a little bit of comedy and one liners from Bruce Willis, but it just didn't work in this one. I was seriously sick of hearing him say he was on vacation. I also don't feel like Bruce sharing equal screen time with his ""son"" really worked. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson in Die Hard 3 worked. This was just a pale shadow of what we saw there. Whats missing most to me though is the bad guy. The first three movies had memorable characters that you really wanted to see dead, while this movies bad guys were very bland and I didn't really care what happened to them.A Good Day to Die Hard has some great action sequences. Its also great to see Bruce Willis playing this character again. The movie is enjoyable to rent if you are looking for some fun, but there does seem to be a few holes in the acting, the jokes fall a bit flat, the story involving his son really leaves something to be desired, and the bad guys just really make you feel indifferent when you should want to see Bruce take them out by the end of the movie.",3,Least Favorite Die Hard,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,1470,"['believe', 'most', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'original', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'little', 'disappointed', 'latest', 'addition', 'Die', 'Hard', 'franchise', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'anymore', 'people', 'might', 'say', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'age', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'hurt', 'movie', 'would', 'agree', 'couple', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'bit', 'Die', 'Hard', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'comedy', 'one', 'liners', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'one', 'was', 'seriously', 'sick', 'hearing', 'say', 'was', 'vacation', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Bruce', 'sharing', 'equal', 'screen', 'time', 'son', 'really', 'worked', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Die', 'Hard', '3', 'worked', 'was', 'just', 'pale', 'shadow', 'what', 'saw', 'there', 'Whats', 'missing', 'most', 'bad', 'guy', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'had', 'memorable', 'characters', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'dead', 'movies', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'very', 'bland', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'them.A', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'playing', 'character', 'again', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'rent', 'are', 'looking', 'fun', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'few', 'holes', 'acting', 'jokes', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'story', 'involving', 'son', 'really', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'indifferent', 'when', 'should', 'want', 'see', 'Bruce', 'take', 'out', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

So, I got this.  When I saw it was 90 some minutes.  I told my mom is was going to suck.  I am just going to tell you the bad stuff.  There was nothing good in my opinion.Ok, while the movie was 90 some minutes, really, it was like 70.  The reason?  he beginning of the movie, there is what I can only guess is a twenty minute car chase.  It just goes on and on and on.  It may be kind of cool at first, but after like 10 minutes is just hits that dull phase.  We actually all started laughing.  You get to see cars flip and fly through the air.  Whatever, it was a waste of time.  This you will find is something that happens many times in the movie.  Your time gets wasted.Now, the story.  I mean, there was none.  Something about someone stealing nuclear stuff from, ready, Chernobyl.  When I heard them say that I was like OH, MY, GOD.  So I guess these people want to steal nuclear stuff to make a weapon.  Alright, the place they want to get it from is so full of nuclear waste and so dangerous that even if you had the most advanced suit with protection, I do not think you would be able to survive even an hour there.  Yet, these terrorist just walk around.  THEN, and this made us all laugh, the father and son go in, fight and walk around with no protection on.  Just la, la, la, walking around a highly filled nuclear zone with no protection.  It was freaking ridiculous.  That is another thing you will see a lot in the movie.  The freaking father and son CAN NOT die.  I mean, they fall from a building, hit some stuff on the side and just survive.  Once, they are in a building and a helicopter is firing in shots from one of those guns.  I am not sure how many rounds a gun like that shoots off.  But let's just say they would be ripped in half.  But, nope.  They survive.  They have a slow motion scene and you see like 5 bullets coming in the building.  Really?  Five bullets.  Some on.  That entire building would be no more.  One scene, the father jumps from a helicopter, fly's through the air and goes in the side of a building.  Guess what?  He is fine.  I mean, they just make is so damn stupid.  These guys can not die.Ok, the father and son have something going on.  The son does not like the father because the father worked to much when the kid was young.  Really?  They try to make their scenes funny and witty.  But I assure you, they are neither.  One scene the father is talking to someone about not being there for his son.  I mean, it is the WORST acting I have ever seen.  Like he is reading right from a piece of paper and putting nothing into it.  At the end, the freaking father and son are getting along great.  Again, really?  The father interrupts a mission the son is on.  I guess the father thinks it is fine to just get into a vehicle and start killing people.  Even though he is not even in the U.S. any more.  They kind of ruined the original movies making the son hate the father.  It just makes the originals feel sad.This movie had so many great actors.  But, the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen.  It was like a cheesy, 70s B movie.  One that you would see at a drive in while high. It really was one of the worst things I have ever seen.  The best part of the movie was the last 20 or 30 minutes.  I think it is because you start to see why some of the stuff is happening.  That or you know the freaking thing is about to end.I almost feel like this movie was made as a joke.  They said ""hey lets make this movie and make it as stupid and as far from Die Hard as we can.""  I have no clue why they even slapped the Die Hard name onto this movie.  This just I don't know.  Not Die Hard at all.  I actually didn't feel like I had even seen Bruce W. in the movie.  That is how bad the acting was.  Just 90 some minutes of pointless, meaningless dribble.  I can not sell the movie.  Again, I have the others and want this to add into my set.  Plus, I paid like $24 and something for it.  I would only loose money.

1638710,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BUADSMQ,J. Richardson,"[0, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.As a huge fan of the Die Hard franchise I made many attempts to see the fifth installment, A Good Day To Die Hard, when it was in theaters. However, the plans always fell through. As the credits began to roll at the end of the movie I started to think that maybe it was a sign. As I sat on my couch I couldn't help but wonder what went wrong. Surely I must have missed something during the past 90 minutes. It couldn't have been that bad, could it? As I laid in bed I told myself I had to re-watch it because I missed something. That was the only explanation. Sadly, nothing changed even after I sat through it a second time.It would be hard for me to summarize the plot because, truthfully, it's all over the place. One thing the Die Hard franchise has always done well is provide the viewer with an interesting antagonist. Not only that, but they always made it a point to say ""This man right here. Hey! He's the villain. He's why McClane is doing this."" That's not the case with this movie. Instead, we get ""He's the villain. Nope, psych it's this guy. Wait, nope we changed our mind again. It's this guy now. Oh, remember how we spent the first 70 minutes talking about this? Well, that's not really what this movie's about. Hope you don't mind."" There's no direction, there's no banter between John and a main villain, there's nothing. The entire thing feels sloppily put together and, at times, amateurish.Then comes the pacing. It doesn't take long before we get the first big explosion and the movie doesn't let up until the credits start rolling. There's one over-the-top scene after the next and that's not what the Die Hard series is about. Yes, there's always been those larger-than-life moments, but they were always spaced out and they looked somewhat realistic. Every big scene in here just feels so fake and fabricated that the would-be ""Wow"" moments turn into grunts of disgust. For example, within the first 20 minutes or so John gets shot at with an RPG while driving a would-be 18 wheeler if it was carrying a shipment. So in an effort to avoid the missile he somehow spins the truck in a full circle while the missile flies past. Less than three minutes later we have John in a Mercedes vehicle driving on top of a bunch of cars trying to get on the freeway. It was just so... corny.I haven't even mentioned the final scene yet. I kind of think their budget was running out because the further I got into the film the worse the presentation got. The guns looked like they weren't even shooting anymore and the big finale looked like a CGI sequence from a PS2 game. The cheesiness was so bad that it rivaled the cheesy moments from the first film. With that said, I think the director attempted to have a throwback moment to the film that started it all. There's a segment where you see Yuri Kamarov (Sebastian Koch) falling from a skyscraper and it greatly resembles the scene from the original where Hans was falling out of the window. Also, some of the compositions, provided by Marco Beltrami, resembled some of the compositions from the first film. Unfortunately, that's where the enjoyment stops with the score because the rest of the compositions are all generic pieces we've heard dozens of times before in other action films.As if all that wasn't bad enough, we're given Jack (Jai Courtney) and boy I haven't hated a character in a movie this much in a long time. All this man does is whine and complain. They tried to portray him as this strong male who (sort of) did good things for himself even though his father wasn't there in his life, but I couldn't help but think that he was just this huge brat with daddy issues. If your dad is John McClane you have no right to complain! That's just a law. He's out there saving lives and being a badass and you're mad because he wasn't home to have dinner with you? Come on. I mean even Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) didn't complain this much in Live Free or Die Hard and she at least had some personality. Jack is just awful.Finally, we all love John McClane. There's no question that he's become a household name amongst film enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it feels like his character got put on the back-burner in an effort to showcase Jack. Gone are the witty one-liners, gone are the crazy fistfights, gone is the near-constant connection with the villain. Hell, even his infamous ""Yippie-Kay-Yay"" line felt misplaced when he used it. They tried to throw in a joke or two, but none of it really made me laugh as I was only able to muster a pathetic chuckle at times. This was like the final nail in the coffin for me. This one missing element is what really makes this movie not feel like a Die Hard film. If you don't have the right portrayal of John McClane then all you have is Bruce Willis in another generic action flick.Standout Score: 5/10 - Coming from someone who was never fond of Die Harder, A Good Day To Die Hard is by far the worst entry in the series. Not only is the plot terribly boring, the movie itself lacks in the comedy department and it suffers from some extremely poor pacing. It feels like they're trying to do away with John to try and make room for Jack and I hope that's not the case. Jack lacks the spark that makes John so fun to watch and I can't see him carrying an entire film on his own. I'm not sure what John Moore was thinking with this, but if they plan on making a sixth movie I really hope he's not in charge again.",3,5/10 - Disappointing,1371168000,"06 14,

Protests in Russia are going on over political prisoner Yuri.  John McLain gets word that his estranged son John Jr. has been arrested for killing someone and is in a Russian prison.  Of course, John takes off for Russia just as his son and Yuri are  being taken into the courthouse for trial.  As you might suspect, they escape and John takes off after them.  It is an interesting movie and even takes them to what is supposed to be Chernobyl later in the movie.  Of special interest was the absolutely amazing car chase scene, probably the longest one I have ever seen.  They really went all out on the stunts.OK--Yeah--It was severe BS. I mean, going over to Russia and doing all the typical Die Hard type stuff seemed a bit unbelievable, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun.  Nobody wants to see something ordinary.

So, I was amongst some of the first movie goers to see 'A Good Day to Die Hard' on opening day.  Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed.  While the action sequences are good, the poorly developed plot and atrocious dialogue absolutely crippled the pace of the film.

This was not the best of the set, but it was satisfyingly similar enough, and true enough to the storyline to make it worthwhile. What was glaringly wrong? John would never have behaved like he did when first confronting his son. The cool thing about John, in every preceeding movie, is that he is saavy and aware -- even if he's hungover, or beaten down -- of what's really going down, before anyone else is. He wouldn't have blocked traffic and scolded his son, screaming in the street. That's not our John; it made him look ridiculous, and I fault the director for that -- this character is too well known and understood to make him act that stupid. The actor playing the son was believable as ""Jack"" in looks and manner. The story was plausible enough, and the setting was unique. As always, Willis delivered the rough-and-tumble, loveable tough guy we adore and love to root for, as only he can do.

1638744,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00BUADSMQ,K. Reynolds,"[0, 0]","""SO YOUR SON is a Psycho"" makes a better subtitle for this fifth outing in the ""Die Hard"" series. We met John McClane's (Bruce Willis) daughter in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007), an over the top production with as many laughs as action sequences. Can you forget McClane surfing into the city on the wing of a crashing plane? Featuring Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and Justin Long as a young hacker, it is the series' highest grossing film to date.We only see Lucy in the theater edition of ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" No. 5 is all about McClane's reunion with his homicidally intense son, Jack (Jai Courtney, ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Spartacus"") and, while the movie is full of complicated action and fight scenes, it is a much darker outing. In fact, it's hard to recognize as a ""Die Hard"" story. Director John Moore, of ""Max Payne"" (2008), and unnecessary remakes such as ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" (2004) and ""The Omen"" (2006), went on record before filming that he felt viewers were done with the humor.Seriously - who put this guy in charge?McClane has always been the good guy in the bad place, dropping one-liners as fast as he drops villains. Here he must be as wary with his son as he is with the bad guys. Son Jack is a member of the CIA; his mission to save a Russian politician finds him on the path to a Russian prison. Dad drops into Moscow to keep Jack out of jail. They haven't spoken in years, so he only learns of his son's career choice while guns are blazing and buildings are exploding. ""We only kill the bad guys,"" McClane says repeatedly. It could be an attempt to keep Jack on the straight and narrow.Whoo - we have stepped into an alt-world Die Hard under this director. Jack is bad, bad news, and we've got to wonder how he got this way. This can't be our hero's son. But there are no explanation except, like Lucy, Jack complains that Dad wasn't around enough.We don't see or hear anything from Willis in the high-def extras, which feature a highly technical, multi-part making-of and a special feature, ""The Anatomy of a Car Chase."" The movie opens with a long and complicated action sequence that, despite all the non-CG thrills, takes up too much time. I wish - along with critics and other ""Die Hard"" fans - they'd spent more time on story and character. We can see from the extras that director Moore and assistant director Mark Cotone's interests lie in pyrotechnics and stunts. Moore and Cotone also provide an enthusiastic and sadly enlightening commentary. We don't hear anything from writer Skip Woods.It's not easy to choose between the extended and theater version. There's little more than three minutes difference in length. The extended edition ends with McClane and son walking out of Chernobyl, while the theatrical shows an unbelievable family reunion that doesn't fit the bleak story.-- Kay Reynolds",3,Family issues keep John McClane on his toes!,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,2873,"['SO', 'YOUR', 'SON', 'Psycho', 'better', 'subtitle', 'fifth', 'outing', 'Die', 'Hard', 'series', 'met', 'John', 'McClane', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'daughter', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', '2007', 'top', 'production', 'many', 'laughs', 'action', 'sequences', 'Can', 'forget', 'McClane', 'surfing', 'city', 'wing', 'crashing', 'plane', 'Featuring', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'McClane', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Justin', 'Long', 'young', 'hacker', 'series', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'date.We', 'only', 'see', 'Lucy', 'theater', 'edition', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'No', '5', 'McClane', 'reunion', 'homicidally', 'intense', 'son', 'Jack', 'Jai', 'Courtney', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'Spartacus', 'movie', 'full', 'complicated', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'much', 'darker', 'outing', 'fact', 'hard', 'recognize', 'Die', 'Hard', 'story', 'Director', 'John', 'Moore', 'Max', 'Payne', '2008', 'unnecessary', 'remakes', 'such', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', '2004', 'Omen', '2006', 'went', 'record', 'filming', 'felt', 'viewers', 'were', 'done', 'humor.Seriously', 'who', 'put', 'guy', 'charge', 'McClane', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'place', 'dropping', 'one-liners', 'as', 'fast', 'villains', 'Here', 'must', 'be', 'wary', 'son', 'bad', 'guys', 'Son', 'Jack', 'member', 'CIA', 'mission', 'save', 'Russian', 'politician', 'path', 'Russian', 'prison', 'Dad', 'Moscow', 'keep', 'Jack', 'jail', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'years', 'only', 'son', 'career', 'choice', 'guns', 'are', 'blazing', 'buildings', 'are', 'exploding', 'only', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'McClane', 'repeatedly', 'could', 'be', 'attempt', 'keep', 'Jack', 'straight', 'narrow.Whoo', 'have', 'stepped', 'alt-world', 'Die', 'Hard', 'director', 'Jack', 'bad', 'bad', 'news', ""'ve"", 'got', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'hero', 'son', 'are', 'explanation', 'Lucy', 'Jack', 'Dad', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'enough.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'hear', 'anything', 'Willis', 'high-def', 'extras', 'feature', 'highly', 'technical', 'multi-part', 'making-of', 'special', 'feature', 'Anatomy', 'Car', 'Chase', 'movie', 'long', 'complicated', 'action', 'sequence', 'non-CG', 'thrills', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'wish', 'critics', 'other', 'Die', 'Hard', 'fans', ""'d"", 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'story', 'character', 'can', 'see', 'extras', 'director', 'Moore', 'assistant', 'director', 'Mark', 'Cotone', 'interests', 'lie', 'pyrotechnics', 'stunts', 'Moore', 'Cotone', 'also', 'provide', 'enthusiastic', 'sadly', 'enlightening', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'writer', 'Skip', 'Woods.It', 'not', 'easy', 'choose', 'extended', 'theater', 'version', 'little', 'more', 'three', 'minutes', 'difference', 'length', 'extended', 'edition', 'McClane', 'son', 'walking', 'Chernobyl', 'theatrical', 'shows', 'unbelievable', 'family', 'reunion', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bleak', 'story.', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

John `inadvertently' gets involved with an international spy mission. John survives some of the most amazing visual feats of action and stunts that Superman is the  only other person that would be able to make it through.What am I talking about? Director John Moore (Max Payne, Behind Enemy Lines) takes on the 5th adventure of the New York ex-cop, John McClain, in ""A Good day To Die Hard"". (Actually the title is a derivative of a famous Star Trek Klingon quote, but oh well I digress.) From a script written by Skip Woods (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The A-Team) and using characters originally created by Roderick Thorp four movies ago, the movie is a series of things that happen one after the other and like the previous films our star, Bruce Willis (The Fifth Element, Pulp Fiction) takes us on another rollercoaster ride of action and adventure set in Russia.Trying to catch up with his son because he doesn't know exactly what he is doing in Russia, it all becomes a foreign land to Bruce which makes it a little bit of the fish out of water story, but you can see the patterns of the old films roll out one by one. A convincing performance is done by Jai Courtney (Jack Reacher, Spartacus: War of the Damned) as Bruce's son with a hidden agenda.Sebastian Koch (Black Book, Unknown) does a great job as the Russian persona with a secret code that the entire cast of the film is trying to get a hold of, including Bruce's son. A little predictable in areas of where the characters were going, but one or two surprise were to be had. Russian actress Yuliya Snigir (Kokoko, Obitaemyy) is new to American audiences and does a fine job as the daughter of Sebastian. She too has a weird twist or two in the film.Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing, Scott Pilgrim vs The World) reprises her role as the daughter in this film, but isn't really seen much and doesn't have a to do.Now there is a little miss-direction too, when a `villain' played by Rasha Bikvic (Taken, The Heir Apparent: Largo Witch) leads the audience to think there is something going on when actually there isn't and the real `villain' is revealed. Sound confusing? It was to me too, a little. Then they unraveled everything fairly quickly.This movie is a little long and the best thing it has going for it are the amazing, yet unrealistic, John McClain Franchise style stunts and action sequences, especially a `chopping' helicopter finale. Other than that it was a little `ho-hum' for me - except again for the action sequences. I would wait for the blu ray or Netflix on this one.",2,"John McClain Is Back, Why Exactly?

1638789,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BUADSMQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","I've been a big fan of Bruce Willis since the days of MOONLIGHTING. When he headed for the big screen I remained a fan. That being the case each time I've heard that a new DIE HARD movie was coming out I found myself excited to see what would happen next. I even enjoyed LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD which many critics savaged. Unfortunately I'll have to join them this time around with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.This time around John McClane (Willis) heads for Russia when his son Jack (Jai Courtney) is on trial for murder there. The film opens with us learning about two political rivals, ex-business partners Komarov (Sebastian Koch) and Chagarin. Komarov is imprisoned by his former partner who will release him if he would only provide him with a file he hid years ago. Instead, Komarov intends to try and speak his peace before a court, if Chagarin will allow it to happen.As John heads to the courthouse to help his son, his son sits in an enclosed cell in the courtroom next to Komarov after telling the police that he will implicate Komarov if they will lighten his sentence. That all changes when a set of vehicles parked outside the courthouse explode and a team intent on extricating Komarov enters guns blazing. Jack rescues Komarov and they head to a waiting vehicle only to be stopped by John delaying Jack's rescue.It turns out that Jack is working for the CIA and was there to help Komarov all along. But John has no idea and instead screws things up. A chase through the highways of Moscow between Jack's van and the armored vehicle in pursuit follows with John trying to catch up in a vehicle he commandeers. This leads to a far too long chase sequence that involves more vehicles than one would think are even available in Moscow.In the end they escape through John's intervention, head for a safe house and John learns what his son's job is all about. Before the happy reunion can go any further, another team sweeps in to catch Komarov and both McClanes must do their best to rescue him and keep him out of harms way while trying to devise an escape plan.More twists and turns in the plot follow with an over abundant amount of destruction. Buildings are blown apart by high caliber ammunition sprayed by a helicopter as well as machine gun fire aplenty. This movie must have had a tie in with some window manufacturer as the deadly duo either shoots out or jumps through more windows by the end of the film than are seen in most films.It all ends up in a final shoot out that involves the same helicopter, hand grenades, machine guns, hand guns and more. And for some reason the police and Russian army have no idea what is going on or any way of even finding the criminals involved to capture them or the McClane boys. I'm not sure but the moment that much fire power is involved or a fireball lights up the sky you would think that would be a clue as to what is going on.The biggest problem with the film and after the rest I know this will sound strange, but it doesn't have enough plot. With the exception of John going to save his son we don't get anything else until nearly 50 minutes into the movie. And the plot line we do get feels forced and shoved together, the final twist not even something that comes as a surprise or takes up much story time. The movie is well made but hard to appreciate since most of it is spent either running, driving or flying somewhere in pursuit.I'm still a Willis fan. I'll still go back and watch the previous films in this series. I was glad that I watched this one as a rental because if I had paid for the DVD I would have been disappointed. As a rental this one can be a good night's entertainment but not one that I'd want to watch over again. If the idea was to spin off of the elder McClane to a new series of films involving his son then they've failed. As a stand alone action flick it's not bad but no better than a number of direct to DVD films that have come out this year. So in the end, worth watching = yes, worth owning = no.",2,DUD HARD,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,3996,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'days', 'MOONLIGHTING', 'When', 'headed', 'big', 'screen', 'remained', 'fan', 'being', 'case', 'time', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'new', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'found', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'LIVE', 'FREE', 'OR', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'many', 'critics', 'savaged', 'Unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'have', 'join', 'time', 'around', 'GOOD', 'DAY', 'TO', 'DIE', 'HARD.This', 'time', 'John', 'McClane', 'Willis', 'heads', 'Russia', 'when', 'son', 'Jack', 'Jai', 'Courtney', 'trial', 'murder', 'there', 'film', 'learning', 'two', 'political', 'rivals', 'ex-business', 'partners', 'Komarov', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'Chagarin', 'Komarov', 'imprisoned', 'former', 'partner', 'who', 'will', 'release', 'would', 'only', 'provide', 'file', 'years', 'ago', 'Instead', 'Komarov', 'try', 'speak', 'peace', 'court', 'Chagarin', 'will', 'allow', 'happen.As', 'John', 'heads', 'courthouse', 'help', 'son', 'son', 'sits', 'enclosed', 'cell', 'courtroom', 'Komarov', 'telling', 'police', 'will', 'implicate', 'Komarov', 'will', 'lighten', 'sentence', 'changes', 'when', 'set', 'vehicles', 'parked', 'courthouse', 'explode', 'team', 'intent', 'extricating', 'Komarov', 'enters', 'guns', 'blazing', 'Jack', 'Komarov', 'head', 'waiting', 'vehicle', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'John', 'delaying', 'Jack', 'rescue.It', 'out', 'Jack', 'working', 'CIA', 'was', 'there', 'help', 'Komarov', 'along', 'John', 'idea', 'instead', 'screws', 'things', 'up', 'chase', 'highways', 'Moscow', 'Jack', 'van', 'armored', 'vehicle', 'pursuit', 'John', 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'vehicle', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'chase', 'sequence', 'more', 'vehicles', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'are', 'even', 'available', 'Moscow.In', 'end', 'escape', 'John', 'intervention', 'head', 'safe', 'house', 'John', 'what', 'son', 'job', 'about', 'happy', 'reunion', 'can', 'go', 'further', 'team', 'sweeps', 'catch', 'Komarov', 'McClanes', 'must', 'do', 'best', 'rescue', 'keep', 'harms', 'way', 'trying', 'devise', 'escape', 'plan.More', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'follow', 'abundant', 'amount', 'destruction', 'Buildings', 'are', 'blown', 'apart', 'high', 'caliber', 'ammunition', 'sprayed', 'helicopter', 'as', 'well', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'aplenty', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'tie', 'window', 'manufacturer', 'deadly', 'duo', 'shoots', 'out', 'jumps', 'more', 'windows', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'seen', 'most', 'films.It', 'up', 'final', 'shoot', 'same', 'helicopter', 'hand', 'grenades', 'machine', 'guns', 'hand', 'guns', 'more', 'reason', 'police', 'Russian', 'army', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'way', 'even', 'finding', 'criminals', 'involved', 'capture', 'McClane', 'boys', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'moment', 'much', 'fire', 'power', 'involved', 'fireball', 'up', 'sky', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'rest', 'know', 'will', 'sound', 'strange', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'plot', 'exception', 'John', 'going', 'save', 'son', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'else', 'nearly', '50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'do', 'get', 'feels', 'forced', 'shoved', 'together', 'final', 'twist', 'not', 'even', 'something', 'surprise', 'up', 'much', 'story', 'time', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'most', 'spent', 'either', 'running', 'driving', 'flying', 'somewhere', 'pursuit.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'Willis', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'still', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'previous', 'films', 'series', 'was', 'glad', 'watched', 'one', 'rental', 'had', 'paid', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'rental', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'night', 'entertainment', 'not', 'one', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'idea', 'was', 'spin', 'elder', 'McClane', 'new', 'series', 'films', 'involving', 'son', 'then', ""'ve"", 'failed', 'stand', 'alone', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'bad', 'better', 'number', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'So', 'end', 'worth', 'watching', '=', 'yes', 'worth', 'owning', '=']",N/A

Brookes,"[0, 0]","I really wasn't expecting much, especially after the last film, although I was hoping that it would at least be an entertaining, if silly action film. While it doesn't exactly fail on that score it's far from great. It's a shame because it actually starts quite well. The initial set up had promise, there's some Russian political skullduggery followed by John McClane finding out that his son is in trouble with the law in Moscow.Things get going  pretty quickly and father and son encounter each other by chance at the start of a crazy chase across Moscow. They don't get on, which seems fair enough, the chase sequence is substantial, silly, but reasonably entertaining and it has an excellent truck.Unfortunately things go down hill from that point, father and son discover that they both have a knack for killing people and that provides an instant bond and off they go. The plot gets sillier with each twist and comes to a conclusion in Chernobyl - although it manages to fail at using the inherent creepiness of the location.As a Die Hard film it's pretty poor, it has Bruce WIllis against the bad guys, but it lacks a decent bad guy and more importantly it lacks the tension of him being alone against a superior force and the feeling that he's managing by the skin of his teeth to make an impact. Here he's just a gun wielding hero with no real sense of peril. On the bright side there's a few half decent wisecracks and of course the infamous line.As an over the top action film it's not terrible, but there's better films out there to get your action fix, like the original Die Hard perhaps.",2,A bad day for Die Hard,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,1602,"['really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'especially', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'entertaining', 'silly', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fail', 'score', 'far', 'great', 'shame', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'initial', 'set', 'up', 'had', 'promise', 'Russian', 'political', 'skullduggery', 'followed', 'John', 'McClane', 'finding', 'out', 'son', 'trouble', 'law', 'Moscow.Things', 'get', 'going', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'father', 'son', 'encounter', 'other', 'chance', 'start', 'crazy', 'chase', 'Moscow', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fair', 'enough', 'chase', 'sequence', 'substantial', 'silly', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'excellent', 'truck.Unfortunately', 'things', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'point', 'father', 'son', 'discover', 'have', 'knack', 'killing', 'people', 'instant', 'bond', 'go', 'plot', 'sillier', 'twist', 'conclusion', 'Chernobyl', 'fail', 'using', 'inherent', 'creepiness', 'location.As', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'pretty', 'poor', 'Bruce', 'WIllis', 'bad', 'guys', 'decent', 'bad', 'guy', 'more', 'importantly', 'tension', 'being', 'alone', 'superior', 'force', 'feeling', 'managing', 'skin', 'teeth', 'make', 'impact', 'Here', 'just', 'gun', 'wielding', 'hero', 'real', 'sense', 'peril', 'bright', 'side', 'few', 'half', 'decent', 'wisecracks', 'course', 'infamous', 'line.As', 'top', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'terrible', 'better', 'films', 'there', 'get', 'action', 'fix', 'original', 'Die', 'Hard', 'perhaps']",N/A

1638798,A205C7VCSDVARI,B00BUADSMQ,Meatwad,"[0, 1]","(Note: Amazon took down my earlier review, probably because of the language that was used. Here's a slightly tweaked version that meets their expectations.)Director: John Moore.Writer: Skip Woods.Staring: Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney, Sebastian Koch, Radivoje Bukvi&#263;, Yuliya Snigier and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.Running Time: 97 minutes.Rated: R for Violence and Language.Ugh.I'm not a person to get bored easily. I can be easily amused by even the pettiest of entertainment from time to time. But when a film has car crashes, helicopter fights, swear words, big firefights and other such things and I'm bored to feath, there's something horribly wrong in the world. Such is the case with A Good Day to Die Hard or Die Hard 5, which ever strikes your fancy.I've only seen two Die Hard movies in my life: The first one and the fourth one. The first film is often seen as a classic in action - and to an extent, Christmas - cinema, combining great action, suspense, performances, a charismatic villain, good plotting and its very likable and relatable protagonist by the name of John McClane, played by the always ready and willing Bruce Willis.The fourth one, Live Free Or Die Hard, has some contention with the fanbase. While it was a critical and commercial success, some viewed it as taking away the Die Hard spirit with a PG-13 rating and the fact John McClane was driving cars into helicopters. To me, it never really bothered me and while I only watched that film once, I do remember having fun with it, with it's interesting take on cyber terrorism and the fact that McClane was taking on a baddie who isn't like other folks he dealt with before.Now how could I summarize the plot of A Good Day to Die Hard? Well, I wish I could give you, the reader, some kind of way to provide a synopsis of this film, so I'll do so the best I can. So, McClane  goes to Russia to meet up with a son he never had never met before, Jack McClane (Jai Courtney). Jack is actually working on a case with the CIA protecting a witness in a trail, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), who is caught up in a Nuclear weapon heist. Right when the trial is about to begin, a bunch of baddies show up and attempt to kidnap Komarov. Soon, John and Jack must get over their family issues and team up to protect Komarov or something like that.Attempting to get invested in the film's plot is like trying to perform nuclear science. Every single character in the film is basically a cardboard cutout, without a nice tasty amount of cliche slapped on `em. We get almost no character development or we barely get to know them. Hell, the kid goes from hating his dad to loving him near the end and it comes off forced as hell. This one villain played by Radivoje Bukvic, lacks any kind of menace or charisma in the film. His most memorable scene is him kicking the guns away from our main heroes, tap dancing and eating a Carrot. And when its revealed of who the true bad guy is (yes, we're dealing with one of those again), even when I had it spoiled for myself, it still came off as a really pathetic twist.As I mentioned earlier, the film is just flat out boring. Right from the get go, there is no flair or joy from this film. All of it, from the editing to the pacing and looks, it all feels workman-like. Oh sure, characters crack wise and the McClanes spew playful insults at each other but it all ends up feeling so incredibly hollow. Hell, I'm one of those people that will defend a movie by saying ""It's just a movie! Deal with it!"" and even here, I had a really hard time buying things like McClanes jumping into an obviously radiated pool of water and surviving or John surviving an insane car chase with nary a scratch, And on the acting side of things, it just gets worse from there.Bruce Willis just looks bored here. Hell, everyone does. No one hams it up in any capacity or has fun with what they are doing. It's almost as if everyone here is phoning it in just to get themselves a tasty paycheck, which given the material, is pretty understandable. I'm also under the slight impression that everyone who was in the making of the film was taking some kind of amphetamine or something, just do get through the days of shooting.One has to wonder who the hell wrote and directed this. Previous Die Hard movies usually have either loads or some degree of talent behind the camera but they came up short with director John Moore, who's previous works include a shot-for-shot remake of The Omen and the film adaptation of Max Payne. Meanwhile, screenwriting duties were given to Skip Woods, who's resume includes such works like X-Men Origins Wolverine and Hitman. These men are not directors and screenwritiers; They are goddamn boot-licking leeches that got lucky. That is all.Surprisingly, I found the action to be pretty decently shot. While others jump on the gun and yell ""Shaky Cam"", I could always tell what was going on, even during it more crazier moments. The only problem it becomes a problem to see is near the end, thanks to the poor lighting during the night time scenes. Christ, it made feel like I was watching the opening of The Avengers all over again, but without the benefit of knowing I'd get something good out of it. Meanwhile, the CG used in the film is questionable at best. At times, it really shows that it is fake as hell in the most numbing of ways.If there are any good things to say about the film, I would say that the film does come off as gun-porn at times, which is nice I guess. There's also a semi-charming scene between McClane and a Russian cabbie as they talk about Frank Sinatra and how s***ty the traffic is. Unsurprisingly, that's one of the film's most publicized scenes.To summarize myself before I get the desire to claw out my eyeballs with a pair of trimming shears, don't even bother watching A Good Day To Die Hard. Dull action, a silly and incomprehensible plot, bland acting, and poor character development mar this film to hell and back. And to those that say ""I can't shut off my brain and just watch the movie"", I say this:Do you know what's a good action movie that I can turn my brain off to? The Crank films. Bad Boys II. The first Transformers flick. Armageddon. There's plenty of dumb as hell movies I can shut my brain off and sit back and watch, but AGTDH is not one of them.It's a real shame that something like this can get greenlit while a good R-Rated action flick like DREDD bombs at the box office. Hell, a goddamn trailer for Sharknado looks like it has more invention and charm than this entire movie. What kind of cinema-going world do we live today, anyway? I'm not going to go on a rant about the death of cinema, like some film snob-wannabe, but Jesus Christ, all I can do is just sight in disappointment.",1,Dull Hard,1374796800,"07 26,

The Soviet old guy after reveal himself, he simply have no more input just stand there get caught until his daughter come in rescue what's the thrill to beat a dumb ** like that. And most parts of the movie is simply just about the old guy being trace and while John is tagging along, he somehow missed the injure all, but then he's not pursuing to break the game the Russian is playing.The whole plot in this movie is just rescuing mission, that is it, while all the other movies were about John breaking at the enemies' game.Another thing is John McClain was always been a slang cop, this movie really downplay that side of his character.

Based primarily on the trailers and some critical reviews I was going to wait for the movie to hit HBO in a few months.While on a road trip with my 17 year old son, he convinced me to go, himself a fan of the franchise.  Even at only $4 a pop, it was time better served.  John McClane (Bruce Willis, not looking his age) heads to Moscow to find out why his estranged son (Jai Courtney) has been imprisoned.  It turns out son Jack did it on purpose to get close to a political prisoner who he hopes to rescue.  Oh yeah, Jack's with the CIA.Nothing in the film makes sense in reality and the script is horrible.  But at any time you can expect car chases, car crashes and plenty of flying bullets, rockets and fists.  I suspect this is one of those films that was storyboarded with action sequences long before someone said, ""well what's the movie about?"" They never did figure that one out.

Now, Live Free Or Die Hard (#4) was lacking in the sense that it was cropped content wise due to its PG-13 rating change. However I still enjoyed it alot. Now THIS DH movie (#5)was probably one of my favorites in the series. I usually don't like picking favorites (it's hard for me, lol, I like so much).This DH movie was an awesome action flick that is underrated. Worse movies get awards and praise. People must have walked into this movie, expecting Inception or some monumental brain puzzling experience. This is not that kind of a movie. It is merely an additional chance for us to see Bruce Willis takin out baddies in a new setting with a new ally. And it succeeds as an entertaining action movie!After 4 previous movies there's not much character building that needs to take place and to be honest if you've stuck with the series this long, it's because you like watching Willis kill. Admit it, this movie was very entertaining. When it was over, I was wishing it was longer! This is NOT a bad movie.I'd go so far as to say this movie is better than Avengers. Avengers got WAY too much praise for what it is. Superheroes fighting aliens. That's Avengers' plot in THREE words. Try describing THIS plot in only three words.

Or any other movie he's ever been in. The fourth film in the series was great (totally unrealistic, but an awesome action flick), whereas this one was really let down by all the nagging from the son. He's supposed to be some secret agent, yet he can't sense when something's wrong, he has no intuition, and he spends nearly the whole movie complaining about how much Bruce Willis sucked as a father. Of course by the end (as with the other films) the relationship has been repaired and they walk off into the distance as best friends.For me, this film was not worth making. It was barely worth watching. The action scenes were good, and it was interesting (I guess) to see McClain in Russia, but it was basically like watching any of the other Die Hard movies. My favourite scene was where McClain pushes the bad guy off the roof and they shoot it the same way as when Alan Rickman was pushed off the roof all those years back.

Well, actually, a 2 dimensional version of him is, somehow devoid of any of those appealing characteristics of humanity and ""guy-next-door-ness"".  This time, we are led to believe he has a son we have not yet heard about, whom he travels to Moscow to find and restore the family connection he lost some time ago.  His son has taken a career path that astonishingly his pop was unaware of, and McClane Senior and McClane Junior soon bond through killing umpteen anonymous bad guys, plus causing untold injuries and deaths in the populace around them.  To be fair, there are some breathtaking scenes in the car chase through Moscow, with an incredible amount of mayhem, smashing cars and explosions.. which is, let's be truthful, part of why we watch a movie with `Die Hard' in the title.  It's exciting, even though the camera tends to shake around so much you often have just a sense that something exciting is happening, while not being fully aware of what it actually is.  But the buzz isn't sustainable, and as the impressive stuntwork gives way to cgi McClanes flying through the air in the latter half of the movie, our brains are simply unable to hold that disbelief in suspension any more and the movie becomes at best a partial snoozefest.  The latter half of the movie suffers also from the absence of Moscow, which turns out to be quite an inspired choice for a movie like this, which gets replaced with somewhere suitably abandoned and lacking in energy (no pun intended, in case you know the story already).  This might have held together if there was a suitably charismatic villain.. but there isn't one.  The US taking sides with one half of a Moscow oligarch feud seems unlikely and  neither of the the two seem.. well, interesting.  Oh and did I forget to mention Jai Courtney plays McClane's son?  Mmmhh - probably because my brain is already forgetting about it.  Not so much because of the performance, just that the script never really lets him come into his own.Maybe I am being a bit harsh.. after all, this is quite a routine and acceptable action flick.  But the thing is, I loved Die Hard.  I maybe wasn't quite sure why at the time, but unfortunately I have movies such as this to clarify it to me. Die Hard allowed our action heroes to be more human and vulnerable while still delivering thrills and action.  The action was precise and thrilling not because it was unbelievable, but because we were amazed to find it happening to this guy we accepted as belonging in the real world.  With this movie, we are firmly back into the 80's territory we were rescued from in the first place, of supermen we can't believe in and abundant action that loses its thrill pretty quickly.

What a cop-out thing to say. There are lots of great action movies out there, many of which do not even require thought. Like, for instance, all the other Die Hards.""Die Hard 5"" is so utterly poor I have trouble believing it's rooted from one of the best action movie franchises of all time. In my books this series was batting a thousand up till now. I even thoroughly enjoyed ""Live Free,"" when many people thought enough was enough. But at least it combined the humor, action and character development reminiscent of the other Die Hards.In ""Die Hard the Fifth"", John McClane abandons most of his famous curmudgeonly whimsy by just muttering ""Jesus!"" a lot whenever he narrowly averts death. It's such a flat exclamation, and not even believably delivered. Seriously, count the number of times it's said (it'll give you something to do to avoid boredom). At many points in the movie I wasn't even sure who the bad guys were, which made me feel a little lost and took away from a lot of suspense.The slow-mo action sequences were crap. It's the director's way of signalling to us how cool his action sequences are, and to please, please savor every sweet frame of my way-cool action shot! Sometimes a good action movie can get away with the slow-mo BS, but by this point in ""Cinco de Die Hard"" I was too annoyed to have patience with the technique.As for those who yuck it up with, ""C'mon, it's DIE HARD...whaddya want, a thinking movie??"", you can sit there and feel pleased with yourself for defending something sub-par if you want.

1638843,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B00BUADSMQ,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[4, 9]","Just when you thought McClane had yippee-ki-yay'd his way out of police work, he manages to battle his way back from retirement, only this time his problems are a bit more international. After traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son, Jack (Jai Courtney), John winds up knee deep in a nuclear weapons heist. It's up to the two McClanes to put aside their differences and prevent a global outbreak of war. Add in Russian politicos, the underground crime scene and a dash of Chernobyl and you've got yourself quite the awesomely bad vacation.A Good Day To Die Hard is one of those awesomely bad action movies that's a mix of old school heroics and modern day technologies. But before I get into my review let me start by saying, this movie is really made for die hard fans of the Die Hard series. While it might be passable for something produced in the late 80's/early 90's, it would never fly past today's high standards. You really need to go into the movie with low/no expectations in order to come out satisfied because, in a word, it's ridiculous. I feel like each Die Hard movie is a little more over-the-top than its predecessor and now that we're on the 5th one, you can only imagine what that might entail. Exploding helicopters, massive car/tank chases through the busy streets of Moscow and expertly orchestrated prison breaks. You know, just a normal days work for the McClane family.Bruce Willis delivers all the iconic McClane lines and executes them with his trademarked squint and snarky attitude. And for a man of 57, you have to appreciate how he can still kick some serious ass. He embodies everything we come to expect from John McClane: the stubbornness, sarcasm and a take-charge now ask questions later method. What was lacking though was the father-son dynamic between him and Jack. Their relationship is anything but engaging and borders on frustratingly repetitive and hollow. I liked Jai Courtney well enough for an action guy but I just wasn't buying him as McClane Jr. Their relationship fluctuates between stony and warm fuzzies with little progression in between.As far as the cinematography goes, Moore had a more artistic vision in this film with slow-mo sequencing and well-framed shots, but I felt like for this type of movie, it didn't really work. Often it felt out of place, unnecessary and, at times, comical. I'm sorry but I'm there f or the action, not the art direction. What really worked in this movie, though, was the location. The change in scenery felt fresh and interesting. Sure, some of the old Russian communism &#34;us versus them&#34; mentality remains, but it works for all intensive purposes. I felt like they were able to get away with a lot of the outrageous action specifically because of the setting. It was in, no way, believable but I don't think it should be. All in all, A Good Day To Die Hard isn't the best action movie I've seen, but it's not the worst either. It hits all the marks of the traditional Die Hard film with all the cheesetastic, explosive, wry action that you could want. If you're looking for awesomely bad, then you've found it. Let's just hope that the franchise follows fast in McClane's footsteps and considers a long, hard retirement.Food for Thought: While nowhere as perfect as the original, A Good Day To Die Hard contains all the elements essential to make it a decent addition to the high-octane Die Hard saga. It's got a ridiculous plot, over-the-top action sequences, cheesy one-liners and a whole lot of yippee-ki-yaying which are essential to keep the 80's actiony feel. And while I did get a kick out of the movie, I can only hope that this was the end of an era and they let John McClane's adventures stop here.

Can you believe that 2013 marks the 25th anniversary of the original ""Die Hard"" movie? Where has the time gone! The plot in the latest Die Hard is wafer-thin, something about our hero McClane's son being in a Moscow jail, and our hero going on ""vacation"" to check it out. Need more be said? No!Several comments: first, if you've seen the trailer for this, as I had several times in past month or so, you knew exactly what to expect in this movie. And that is exactly what the movie delivers (unlike, say, another recent movie ""Broken City"", which promised action in the trailer and proved to be a 'talkie'). The plot of ""A Good Day"" matters not one bit, as far as I'm concerned. What I was hoping for, and got, were over-the-top action sequences. Check out for example early on in the movie the outstanding car chase in Moscow, which truly defies belief as we're seeing it happening on the big screen. Also the concluding action sequence of the movie (involving a huge Russian helicopter) is pretty darn good. I also very much enjoyed the scenery in Moscow, a visit I have visited once many years ago. Looks like a lot has changed there.If you are looking for art with a capital A, and then are disappointed with this movie, it's a bit like going to a Britney Spears show and being upset you didn't get Mozart music. If on the other hand you are looking for a good action movie, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is exactly what the doctor has ordered. I was surprised how quickly the movie rolled by, and thoroughly enjoyed myself, as long as you don't take any of this too seriously.

1638878,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B00BUADSMQ,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[47, 66]","I sure am glad about two things. Firstly that I read a lot of reviews saying this movie is terrible, and secondly knowing that most of the time public reviews are often extremely harsh and not always fair, I'm glad I didn't listen to these people. Here, netflix, IMDB 75-90% of the reviewers either didn't like or downright hated this movie. And I read dozens at each web site. I expected this movie based on all that to be a total bomb. Truth is it's not bad at all. Certainly better than the second installment. In my opinion it's not as good as 1,3 and 4. But better than 2, which I simply thought was not very good at all. People complained that Russia is not a good setting for a Die Hard movie. well I can say it's a lot better than an entire Die hard movie set at an Airport. And in this installment the action is much better than it was in 2.Many of the reviews were not only too harsh but they were also totally incorrect sometimes. For instance numerous reviews complained that Willi's McClane doesn't hardly say a thing through nearly the entire movie. Totally false. He talks through most of the film only a little less than would be expected. Another is people complaining that the chase scene was 20,30 minutes long. Well it was actually about 3 or 4 minutes longer than the usual classic chase scenes we like to reference. But that doesn't matter and shouldn't. The action and destruction that takes place during this scene is some of the best I have ever seen. More cars are destroyed in this segment than have probably ever been destroyed in any other chase scene in movie history, but they are also destroyed in unique ways and it's visually realistic and extremely impressive. What's the main thing people expect from a Die Hard movie? Lots of mind blowing action that doesn't let you down. This chase as well as all the action in the movie doesn't dissapoint, it's done superbly. Some action moments are pretty hair raising and very stylishly done.What doesn't work in the movie well is the chemistry between McClane and his son. It's just lazy chemistry with no real heart. They are not given much as far as a script goes to work with either. Comparing it to the script and Chemistry Wills had with Sam Jackson or Justin Long in 3 and 4, it's pretty lackluster, downright terrible in comparison. There is also a lot less humor than we've come to expect and that is a let down too. The bad guys in this outing do not standout like Hans or Peter Gruber did, and there's no hot ass kicking asian girl in this one either. The movie is also not as lengthy as the other Die Hard movies. It's about 15 minutes shorter, so I understand the various reviews where people felt it could have been longer. And Willis often becoming sort of a backup man for his son seems a bit unflattering too. One of the things that we love about John McClane is that he takes control of the situation even if most of the time he feels ""This a bad idea"".So if there is a lot that just doesn't work well about this movie, then why 4 stars? Well that was a tough choice, but considering how far downhill the movie industry has drifted in the last 10 or so years, I've seen so many movies as of late that are just plain terrible or such letdowns when they promised to be great that I expected this to be even worse than those. I mean based on all the bad reviews I expected an absolute total bomb. This film is far from that. Since Hair raising action is the main reason I go see a Die Hard movie, on that level this movie delivers the goods. Very happy Willis is still willing to play in another sequel, so that's a lot better than no Die Hard to go and see. Sure the plot, script and other various things about this film seem kind of dull and feel kind of flat, but it's still a very entertaining movie, and though it's nowhere as good as the last installment I still really enjoyed it, and much more than Die Hard II.Still there's a lot to like about this movie. The setting of Russia as a backdrop is really very nice. It's used well, particularly arial shots make the city interesting. Lots of great moments, the plot and story are still interesting, and the movie has a lot to like about it. I think too many people expect each Die Hard movie to outdo the one before it. That was true of 3 and 4 after all, but then not true of I and II. I recommend it as long as your expectations are not set too high, you should really enjoy it. Certainly better than the 'Taken' films. More intelligent and better action.

1638885,A2QS21S3J3BL52,B00BUADSMQ,rayJ,"[0, 1]","I love the DIE HARD series. It has been one of the most consistent as far as entertainment and quality goes. Perhaps in the action genre,only the Lethal Weapon films can also stake tat claim. But unfortunately, the 5th time around is not the charm for John McClane. The story concerns McClane going to Russia,to offer support for his son-in prison and wrapped up in a high profile trial of a Russian national.The father/son pair meet up and butt heads as they try to outrun the terrorists pursuing the trio,and get to safety.SO...the good?*It has all the action you'd want/expect from a DIE HARD film.*Marco Beltrami also seems to be more comfortable in doing an action score that fits this franchise,and while i would have liked more of Michael Kamens themes-i cant really complain.*A new location. They dont over-do it and slam a sign that says 'Were in Russio,heres a landmark!"" in your face so,while the film takes place outside the US,the subtle presentation lets you enjoy it or ignore it,depending which you prefer.Ah...the bad:*The runtime. The film is barely an hour and 40 minutes long-at least 20 minutes shorter than it should be. Why the rush? It feels as though there was a whole other part to the movie that got scrapped...*Where are the police? We hear a siren and see a cruiser fly by,and that is enough for the film-makers i guess.*No fights? A few fists get thrown,but come on-wheres the down and dirty battle? Take the fight with Karl in DIE HARD, or the fight with Maggie Q's character in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Even if John Sr is too old for karate-chopping,let the son pick up the slack...thats what he's there for right?*John Jr/Jack...yes,he's presented as the lead and John is the sidekick...maybe its just because that fits the story more. Blehh*Scenes in the trailer that didnt make the cut (ohh..more half-naked biker chick..sigh)How it could have been better: You could solve 2 problems in one fell swoop. If they had introduced a Russian detective,who was following the Terrorists and McClane duo..youd have*a longer runtime*an opportunity for a few quite moments,that weren't a sappy/macho blend,and could help give the audience a better look at the 'characters'*a simply more rounded,grounded filmIm not saying it would have been the best of the series,but it of been better received if it was at least the quality of DIE HARD 2so its not as awful as some reviewers claim,and as an action movie its just fine...a decent mindless extravaganza of violence. But as a film with the banner Die Hard...it misses a bit. If the film-makers had a checklist of what makes it a John McClane adventure,they checked off most of it.So is it the weakest of the series,yes. Is it the 'Leonard Part 6"" of action movies..no.

It was Saturday night, there wasn't much on in the cinema and it seemed like a good idea at the time. As it turns out this films stinks so much Vue should have provided the cinema goer with a complimentary nose peg. Let us set aside the cynically crass exploitation of the tragic Chernobyl disaster and the ethics of this. What we have here is a rotting carcass of a film that should be entitled ""A Good Day to Give The Die Hard Franchise a Decent Burial"". Trying to describe the plot is like trying to balance on mercury and whoever wrote the script really deserves a decent spell in a Siberian labour camp. Bruce Willis's first ""Die Hard"" film was all a bit special and of course it had Alan Rickman in it to make him look good and out act everyone in sight. To be fair to Willis he was then a endearing cheeky chappy who did a decent turn and who understood that acting wasn't all about how much blood covers your tight fitting dirty vest. Sadly this execrable mess about Bruce rescuing his son from a Russian mobster with a CIA twist thrown in for good measure is just a series of incredibly loud action scenes (the film comes with a compulsory migrane) and dialogue so jug headed they ought to make Willis the Emeritus Professor of Cliche at Harvard University. By the films conclusion you almost develop a soft spot for the Russian Mafia.Those of you who treasure the wonderful ""Team America World Police"" will recall the parody scene in Paris when in pursuit of ""terrorists"" our heroes destroy the Eiffel Tower and Louvre and kill just about every French citizen in sight. But that was done with puppets and was a brilliant p**s take. In this film we start with a huge first-act car chase through Russia where Willis kills more innocent bystanders than the bad guys could ever hope to and begs the question isn't it time that this level of brainless overkill in film was consigned to the dustbin of history? Willis now stands in the same league as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the acting stakes and as for poor old Jai Courtney this makes his performance in ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" look like Sir John Gielgud in comparison to lame brain on offer here.

They asked me my choice, and I told them I'd vote for Die Hard (The original).  They were not impressed.  Nevertheless, any fan of action films would have enjoyed my choice far more than the films they were discussing.The Die Hard series is the only film mentioned that day that is still around after all these years.  A Good Day to Die Hard is a first-rate action film because of the action, the humor, and the characters.The action is full throttle from beginning to end.  Plus, the scenes are fresh.  Willis and Courtney both did a great job.  The humor was subtle, which is what made it good.  Willis had many good lines related to his dysfunctional relationship with his son.  Good dialogue.  Finally, the characters were winners.  Willis' character was almost as good as the original.  Jai Courtney (who played the bitter son) did a great job.  Yuliya Snigir impressed me as well.  She had few lines, but turned out to be a competent villain.

If you're looking for action and another exciting addition to the Die Hard series than look no further however!  Bruce Willis brings back John McClane as a mature father and tough middle aged cop with great success and the depiction of modern Moscow is bustling, busy, and timely.  No doubt some cultural feel for the mighty city in the east was done to bring this feel home to the film and it was done with great success.  There is one scene that is a little far fetched as John drives a stolen Range Rover over the roofs of cars in traffic, but what the heck, this isn't the only stretched reality that you will be asked to believe during the film.  I streamed this movie from Amazon Prime for a couple of bucks and truly got my moneys worth and had a great time.  To quote Adam Carolla, &#34;Bruce looks like the kind of guy who drives cars fast and shoots guns and that's why we like to see him do it on film&#34;.  Absolutely.

The Extended Cut runs approximately 4 minutes longer and does NOT add any significantly new scenes.  Action scenes remain the same, gore remains the same, and the previously filmed fight scene in front of parked SUVs has not been re-inserted either.SPOILERS FOLLOW BELOW1) McClane shoots at the paper target at the police shooting range a little longer, while cursing his son.2) All scenes involving Lucy McClane have been excised.  So no more beginning scene of Lucy driving John to the airport or meeting her dad and brother at the end of the movie.3) A few extra scenes of John walking through the demonstration at Moscow.4) The highway chase scene is a little better cut.5) A few new quick shots of the assault on the CIA safehouse.6) A few new quick shots of Irina and the ballroom gunfight.  Slightly clearer how Jack is able to retrieve his gun-knife.7) There is now a dead body in the trunk of the car that Jack steals outside of the club.8) A couple extra sentences of conversation regarding Chernobyl between John & Jack.And there you have it, no major changes in the Extended Cut.  Despite ADGtDH's good performance at the box office, I was disappointed by what is clearly the weakest link of the Die Hard series.  From boring dialogue ""I'm on vacation"" to generic villains, there is nothing Die Hard about this latest edition.  I liked Jai Courtney as Varro in Spartacus, but the script gives him nothing to work with.  Characters are one-dimensional.

The wow came out of a disbelief that I had just seen what I had and the oh my god was a lament for witnessing a dear old friend senselessly slaughtered.The Die Hard series has long been the zeitgeist of action cinema with it's mix of sly, but knowing humor, well developed, likeable and believable characters, it's awesome visuals effects and it's well filmed action scenes, even the more outlandish sequels were always kept in check by following these simple guidelines. However, that is now all gone, A Good Day to Die Hard has none of those things, and it's not even mindless, but enthusiastic entertainment, it's just simply mind numbing.Once again starring as John McClane is Bruce Willis, this time finding himself racing all across mother Russia in pursuit of his estranged son who's a ""fugitive"" in the country. John, Jr. (newcomer Jai Courtney), wanted on a drug charge, I believe, is actually a CIA operative trying to get information from a gangster (Sebastian Koch) that leads to a high ranking Russian official, who himself will stop at nothing to silence his former comrade.The script barely has enough plot to get from A to Z. Littered with bad dialogue, repetitive catchphrases that don't work and endless gunfire. Never does the script by Skip Woods slow down to give us character development, in fact the McClanes may be estranged, but they honestly seem like strangers and their bonding scene is laughable, in an otherwise humorless movie.By now, Willis must now McClane inside out, but here he doesn't even seem to be playing the guy from those earlier adventures. Gone is his wisecracking smart alky everyman  reluctant hero, in his place is an angry, obnoxious superman.However, Willis is not the only one who gives a tedious performance, Australian actor Jai Courtney is a real lumbering stiff of a hero. In his defense, the role has nothing to offer any actor, good or bad. But, Courtney doesn't infuse it with any charisma.  He and Willis have zilch when it comes to on-screen chemistry.Directed by the terrible John Moore, the misguided director who once tried to turn Owen Wilson into an action hero in the ludicrous Behind Enemy Lines. He also helmed the great looking, but boring Max Payne and the dreadful remakes of the Omen and Flight of the Phoenix. What I just don't understand is why the studio, Twentieth Century Fox, would pawn off such a lucrative franchise to an obvious hackneyed director. Yes, he's a company man, but never has one of his films been a success finically or artistically. His direction is flat, lifeless and clearly ambitionless. Just look at how far the James Bond movies have come in recent years by using quality filmmakers.Employing a now all too typical unsteady camera, that just annoys, it doesn't put you into the action. A Good Day to Die Hard has one of the least interesting and poorly edited car chases in movie history right out front to get things started. It's followed by nonsensical shoot outs in a very shallow script full of unlikely plot developments. Then we have some overblown stunts, that do nothing to elevate the interest. All leading up to some very, very bad special effects at the end.I would call A Good Day to Die Hard, the worst movie in the franchise by a long shot, but it never even feels like a Die Hard movie. It's already been established that aside from his usual catchphrase they isn't anything that connects Willis' character to his previous films. But the tone is off, and aside from paying homage to Alan Rickman's death in the first film, although it could be parody it is hard to tell here, they is little linking of these films. Mary Elizabeth Weinstead reprise her role as Lucy McClane in a pointless cameo, and she too seems to be acting out another role.The funny thing is that Woods' script is said to be the first Die Hard script written as a Die Hard movie. But Woods is a fairly stale and unimaginative writer, having penned such gems as X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the big screen A-Team movie and the long forgotten John Travolta-Hugh Jackman cyber thriller Swordfish. Not an once of depth or consideration is given to these characters, not one word of clever dialogue is uttered, in fact I think there is a purpose minimum of words used.It turns out the much maligned PG-13 rating for infinitely better Live Free or Die Hard, was the least of it's problems. A Good Day to Die Hard is R-rated, but you really wouldn't know it. The violence isn't edgier and the language is hardly foul, that would require the actors using more words and the script just couldn't allow that.In the previous films, the villains have been of great interest, we can even remember the name of Hans Gruber, but these villains are just stock baddies. Actually, A Good Day to Die Hard doesn't even make it clear who is the main villain, as we keep changing our main antagonist like in a video game, when one dies another just assumes his role. I wouldn't remember any of these villains by name, except there all Russkies with names like Yuri, Ivan and Viktor,  even the names are clich&eacute;s.It's not unreasonable to expect at least a minimum of good escapist entertainment from a Bruce Willis movie, and if that is all you ask of A Good Day to Die Hard,  you still will be let down. Maybe it is that Die Hard has set such a high standard for action movies, but still there is no excuse for making such a sloppy mess.In years to come, A Good Day to Die Hard will be uttered in the same breath as the dismal Jaws: the Revenge. It should be studied as what not to not do it again, this is a textbook example of how to kill a finically successful franchise in a single blow.At ninety-seven minutes, it is the shortest Die Hard movie, but feels longer than watching all four previous movies in a single uninterrupted sitting. As it turns out, today just was not a good day to die hard instead of going out with a bang, it just goes out with a thud.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1,not such a good day,1362441600,"03

I usually only review the quality of the Blu Ray itself as transferred from Standard Def.  Today, I make an exception.  Yes, I heard all the negative remarks, but I am very capable of forming my own opinions without the influence of others.  So, IMHO, this is not a Die Hard film as we have come to know them, but an action film more in the vein of those horrid Transformers films.  Previous Die Hard movies had a great degree of personality in John McClain's character, and strong and visible antagonists who challenged him every step of the way.  This film has neither and has only the slightest hint of a storyline in that Bruce comes to Russia to save his son, who is now a secret CIA operative in battle with a Russian big wig.  That's it.  The entirety of the film is one huge cacophony of stunt work and CGI.  I was very disappointed and think they should have stolen Sly Stallone's movie title and called it 'Die Hard, Over the Top'.  Never the less, my take on the Video and Audio Quality.VIDEO...Surprised that such a new film on Blu Ray would have this much grain in its image.  Especially against gray backgrounds, the grain crawls to annoyance.  There is a slight bleach bypass to the color grading and a definite crushing of the blacks to maximize the dreariness of the American view of Russia.  With the blacks being crushed as they are, there is also a loss of fine detail.  A smoothing out of skin features also removes the details there, and in some scenes, the characters almost appeared cartoonish.  With a Mbps rate that is relatively high in the low thirties, I was surprised at the comparatively poor video reproduction.  Yes, you can get used to it, and I did.  But why should you have to in the first place?  2.5-3 stars.AUDIO...We should be thrilled that not only is the audio codec a lossless DTS HD but that you can have it in a 7.1 configuration as well as a 5.1.  I wish more films offered a 7.1 mix but understand that most viewers have a 5.1 surround system at best.The problem with the audio however is that the mix makes for a cacophony of noise.  Yes, there is a great deal of discreet panning and directionality from all the home theater surrounds, but the overload of noise takes away from the directionality by so immersing the listener that the audio is hard to follow.  As one who would take pristine audio over video any day and loves a great directional mix, I am amazed that I am even saying this.  On a positive note, the LFE channel will earn all the money you spent on it and, I can say, that some scenes actually offer DEMO worthy audio to show off your system with. 4 stars.EXTRAS...You do get the disc on Standard Def as well as a digital copy and you also have the choice between the theatrical release and extended cut.  I based this review upon the extended cut.  Other extras are deleted scenes, trailers, commentaries and other short docs I have not yet viewed.I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in determining your possible future purchase.  All my Blu Ray reviews focus solely upon the quality of the video and audio.  All except this one that is.Thanks for reading.",3,A Good Day to Die Hard on Blu Ray,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3345,"['very', 'rare', 'actually', 'give', 'opinions', 'films', 'never', 'summarize', 'plots', 'give', 'opinions', 'acting', 'almost', 'never', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'first', 'one', 'form', 'usually', 'only', 'review', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'as', 'transferred', 'Standard', 'Def', 'Today', 'make', 'exception', 'Yes', 'heard', 'negative', 'remarks', 'am', 'very', 'capable', 'forming', 'own', 'opinions', 'influence', 'others', 'So', 'IMHO', 'not', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'action', 'film', 'more', 'vein', 'horrid', 'Transformers', 'films', 'Previous', 'Die', 'Hard', 'movies', 'had', 'great', 'degree', 'personality', 'John', 'McClain', 'character', 'strong', 'visible', 'antagonists', 'who', 'challenged', 'step', 'way', 'film', 'only', 'slightest', 'hint', 'storyline', 'Bruce', 'Russia', 'save', 'son', 'who', 'now', 'secret', 'CIA', 'operative', 'battle', 'Russian', 'big', 'wig', 'entirety', 'film', 'one', 'huge', 'cacophony', 'stunt', 'work', 'CGI', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'stolen', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'title', 'called', ""'Die"", 'Hard', 'Top', 'less', 'take', 'Video', 'Audio', 'Quality.VIDEO', 'Surprised', 'new', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'grain', 'image', 'Especially', 'gray', 'backgrounds', 'grain', 'crawls', 'annoyance', 'slight', 'bleach', 'bypass', 'color', 'grading', 'definite', 'crushing', 'blacks', 'maximize', 'dreariness', 'American', 'view', 'Russia', 'blacks', 'being', 'crushed', 'are', 'also', 'loss', 'fine', 'detail', 'smoothing', 'skin', 'features', 'also', 'details', 'there', 'scenes', 'characters', 'almost', 'appeared', 'cartoonish', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'relatively', 'high', 'low', 'thirties', 'was', 'surprised', 'comparatively', 'poor', 'video', 'reproduction', 'Yes', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'did', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'first', 'place', '2.5-3', 'stars.AUDIO', 'should', 'be', 'thrilled', 'not', 'only', 'audio', 'codec', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', 'can', 'have', '7.1', 'configuration', 'as', 'well', '5.1', 'wish', 'more', 'films', 'offered', '7.1', 'mix', 'understand', 'most', 'viewers', 'have', '5.1', 'surround', 'system', 'best.The', 'problem', 'audio', 'however', 'mix', 'cacophony', 'noise', 'Yes', 'great', 'deal', 'discreet', 'panning', 'directionality', 'home', 'theater', 'surrounds', 'overload', 'noise', 'away', 'directionality', 'immersing', 'listener', 'audio', 'hard', 'follow', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'pristine', 'audio', 'video', 'day', 'great', 'directional', 'mix', 'am', 'amazed', 'am', 'even', 'saying', 'positive', 'note', 'LFE', 'channel', 'will', 'earn', 'money', 'spent', 'can', 'say', 'scenes', 'actually', 'offer', 'DEMO', 'worthy', 'audio', 'show', 'off', 'system', '4', 'stars.EXTRAS', 'do', 'get', 'disc', 'Standard', 'Def', 'as', 'well', 'digital', 'copy', 'also', 'have', 'choice', 'theatrical', 'release', 'extended', 'cut', 'based', 'review', 'extended', 'cut', 'Other', 'extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'commentaries', 'other', 'short', 'docs', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'viewed.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'possible', 'future', 'purchase', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'one', 'reading']",N/A

1638979,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00BUADSMQ,StrangePegs,"[2, 4]","Despite the bad reviews, I figured I should probably see A Good Day to Die Hard since I've seen all of the other Die Hard movies and liked at least one of them. Okay, maybe two of them. However, I went in with low expectations. This is the series in which the protagonist survives the explosion of a boat by jumping into the water next to the boat. Because, you know, being in the water totally protects you from explosions in the water. So, not only do we have that, but this one, the 5th (and I'd totally lost track, at this point, that this was the 5th one), was actually getting pretty horrible reviews.It seems I did not lower my expectations far enough. Good Day fails at pretty much every level of story telling and movie making. Well, except for the explosions. It has plenty of those, which, in the Michael Bay theory of movie making, is all you need to make a good movie. I have to suppose John Moore and Skip Woods (the director and writer, respectively) are Bay disciples.The first real mistake the movie makes is having the movie open with McClane's son instead of with McClane himself. It's Die Hard; we're here to see John McClane, not junior. To make it worse, they just throw the audience into the middle of a situation for which there is no context. This is one of the reasons I hate that whole ""start in the middle of the action"" ""rule."" They definitely did that with this movie. However, not knowing anything about the characters or the situation, there is no way real way to know whom we should be caring about, so we don't really care about anyone. Of course, this all ends, as we come to find out, with John Jr. (Jack) in a Russian prison. And, as my wife said, ""What? I didn't even know he had a son.""The issue here is that there is an expectation that we will care about Jack because John cares about Jack. Except we don't have any context, really, for John caring about Jack since he's barely mentioned or seen in the other movies. Conveniently enough, John has suddenly chosen this moment to care about Jack, whom he has not spoken to in years, and has had one of his old cop buddies track Jack down for him just at the time that Jack is arrested and thrown into a Russian prison. Of course, there is no good reason why McClane's cop friend should be able to find out that undercover CIA agent Jack McClane has been thrown into a top Russian prison. Especially within what seems to be hours of it happening. Not that McClane even knows that his son is CIA.Being John McClane, he just jumps on a plane to Russia with some vague expectation that he will be able to connect with his son when he gets there. His son that is in a top, possibly top secret, Russian prison. And, of course, without planning it, he happens to arrive on the day that his son is going to appear in Russian court as a witness against the guy that Jack is supposed to be saving. And, also of course, he stumbles into the middle of a prison break/abduction of the guy that Jack is supposed to be saving (and also testifying against).This is where we expect, I guess, John McClane to become ""yippee-ki-yay"" John instead of old, tired John that we find at the beginning of the movie. But we don't get that. No, what we get is John chasing his son around during the middle of a fire fight trying to talk to him about how sorry he is that he wasn't there for him when he was a kid. I think it was supposed to be funny. I think. But it didn't even rise to the level of ludicrous as John meanders through the bullets and explosions and, eventually, when his son takes off in a vehicle without him, steals a truck to follow his son while yelling, ""I'm not through talking to you!""And through all of this we have been given no real reason as to why this guy Jack needs to save is so important other than that the CIA want him and that some muckety-muck Russian wants him dead. Or abducted. And the guy's daughter is involved, except we're not supposed to know that, but as soon as the dude tells McClane that he has a daughter, I knew it was his daughter that was the woman in the group trying to capture and/or kill the dude. And also of course no one turns out to be on the sides they're presented to be on except McClane, the sadist bad guy, and the dead people.Possibly the worst bit, which is saying a lot considering how terribly the movie began, is when Jack overhears John telling the Russian dude about how bad a parent he was and how bad he feels about it and how all he wants to do is make everything right with Jack. But, since, Jack hears John saying this, we are spared any action or work on the part of John to repair his relationship with his son, because his son, now, understands that his dad worked all the time because of how much he loved Jack. And, then, of course, they bond over killing the bad guys and everything is okay.I'm not making it out to be as bad as it really is. It was bad enough that, before the hour mark, my wife decided that she was through with the movie. I'm not actually sure why I finished watching it other than the fact that I have a hard time stopping something once I've started it no matter how bad it is. That this movie was bad wasn't even the worst part about it. It just felt completely inauthentic. McClane's actions didn't feel authentic (Who, really, just jumps in a plane and flies to Russia with the vague plan of getting in to see someone in a Russian prison? John was a cop; he, theoretically, knows how this stuff works and it's beyond far-fetched that he, even being John McClane, would just hop in a plane without contacting the State Department or something). The fact that Jack refers to his father as ""McClane"" didn't feel authentic (Seriously? ""Damn you, McClane"" is the best they could come up with for Jack to say? I buy him calling his father ""John"" but the whole ""McClane was a stretch the rubber band couldn't take). The whole conflict of the movie involving Russia and nukes didn't feel authentic. It's not the 80s anymore.So, yeah, give me more of escaping explosions by jumping into the water next to the boat that's exploding. At least that was just a brief moment of stupidity unlike the stupidity that was this movie from beginning to end. And that doesn't even cover how dumb the title is, because, if you're going to use the phrase ""a good day to die,"" you need to actually have it be relevant to the movie, but no... no relation at all. Just a cool title. But, then, a cool title doesn't make a cool movie.",1,A Good Day For This Movie To Die Hard,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,6477,"['bad', 'reviews', 'figured', 'should', 'probably', 'see', 'Good', 'Day',

It is kind of cute and quaint; when every studio is remaking classic films or trying to rejuvenate a once successful franchise with a 'prequel', Fox steadfastly decides to keep plugging away and we have the fifth ""Die Hard"" film, quite possibly the worst, and hopefully the last.Fox does introduce us to a younger character who could take over the franchise, if necessary and if this film makes enough money. This has been done before, but it doesn't work. The reason we want to see an ""Indiana Jones"" film is to see Harrison Ford play the role he made famous. The reason we want to see a ""Die Hard"" film is to see the role that made Bruce Willis' film career. But let's face it, while Willis has held up better than his ""Expendables"" co-stars, he won't last forever and Fox will probably try to make at least one more ""Die Hard"", which is why he now has an adult son, played by Jai Courtney (the unstoppable hit man in ""Jack Reacher""). Conceivably, Courtney will take over the series and play Die Hard in the next film.John McClane learns his son, John (Courtney) has been arrested for murder in Russia. The elder John decides to travel there; what he hopes to accomplish, he doesn't seem to know and we never learn. But he arrives in Moscow just in time for his son's sentencing, which happens to take place at the exact same time as the sentencing of a Russian businessman, Kamarov (Sebastian Koch), the main rival of Chagarin, both of whom are the top candidates for the Minister of Defense position. Chagarin has jailed his rival, in the hopes he will talk and reveal the whereabouts of a damaging file. But he won't so an attempt is made on the heavily fortified courthouse on the day of the trial, causing a lot of confusion and destruction. This only allows John the Younger to help Kamarov to escape. Just as they are leaving the courthouse, John literally drives right into his father before speeding off. But John the Elder senses something is wrong (all of the explosions are a giveaway) and chases after them. But the bad guys are also in hot pursuit and the three groups began a destructive, improbable, yet exciting chase through the crowded Moscow city center. Eventually, we learn that Junior is an undercover CIA agent sent to help Kamarov. But there are more secrets leading to a showdown at Chernobyl. Yes, Chernobyl.Directed by John Moore (""Max Payne"", ""The Omen (2006)"", ""Flight of the Phoenix (2004)"") and written by Skip Woods (""The A-Team""), ""Good Day"" has one good action sequence (the chase through the Moscow streets) but little or no character development, the most inane dialogue I have ever heard in an action film (that's saying a lot) and a story that is tasteless. Mix all of this together and this IS the worst ""Die Hard"" film.Generally, sequels tend to get bigger in scope because the filmmakers hope this will increase the odds of you purchasing a ticket for the new film. The ""Die Hard"" films are no exception; the first film is set in a Los Angeles office building, the second in an airport, the third in New York City, the fourth concerns a threat to the entire country and this new film features an international adventure. Yet, oddly with each new film the storytelling seems to shrink and the smaller scope has an adverse effect on the quality and substance of the films. A lot of the reason for this is that as each film expands the threat, the writing seems to become more rote and much less interesting. The first film is still the best because the threat to John is very personal. He just happens to arrive at his wife's office building as a group of terrorists takes it over to hold everyone hostage. The original is a terrific film, giving us a lot of detail and back-story for the hero and the villain, making both of them very human and believable. And it never hurts to have Alan Rickman in your film playing the villain. In ""II"", the threat is increased, but however improbable, McClane and his wife are still under threat, so there is still some immediacy to the action. With each new film, McClane has evolved further and further into a cartoon character getting into improbable situations with no character development. In ""Good Day"", the action seems small and confined, despite the international locale. What does John McClane expect to do in Russia? How does he see this plan unfolding? Part of the delight of the first film is that McClane is thrust into a situation and has to figure out how to control it. In this new film, he enters this world and begins to insinuate himself into it. Yes, he is trying to help his son, but he isn't under threat until he steps into this situation and begins messing around.One of the keys to making this film work is to make us feel some empathy towards the characters. Willis seems to smirk his way through the entire film. There are brief moments between McClane and his partner and between McClane and his daughter (who was taken hostage in the fourth film), but these don't do anything except establish the fact that John is estranged from his son. And when Courtney enters the picture, it is clear the family dynamic is strained, John Jr. holds a gun on his father which is an interesting way to illustrate the family dynamic for us. It also does nothing to make us like J.J. Later, after they barely escape a barrage of bullets, John Sr. begins chastising his son as he contemplates removing a piece of rebar sticking out of his chest. ""Are you going to cry? You're not going to cry on me are you?"" Maybe John Jr. has a reason to feel estranged from his father. John Sr. seems like a pretty big jerk. And this moment does nothing to build any sense of family between them. Also, because we don't really like either of them who are we supposed to root for? Later, it seems as though someone flips a switch because suddenly the father and son are working together in harmony, smiling and joking with one another.The film eventually ends up at Chernobyl as the McClanes attempt to stop the villains from removing enriched uranium. Chernobyl? Really? This just seems incredibly tasteless. As the film casually states, 50,000 people were immediately moved and uprooted when the meltdown happened. The film doesn't seem to dwell upon the deaths or resulting health problems experienced by so many people in the area. This isn't surprising because it would no doubt turn off a lot of the viewers and cut into the popcorn sales.I keep going to the ""Die Hard"" films because I am an optimist. I keep hoping that one of these films will be able to at least approximate a small portion of what made the first film so good. Great action, edge-of-your-seat suspense, a brilliant villain, and a personal threat to the hero making us feel for his character and really care about what happens to him. In ""Good Day"", the villain is forgettable and after one of his henchmen dies, almost nothing of interest happens with this group. It is not a good thing when the villain's henchman is more interesting than the actual villain. Quick, what was the name of each villain who employed Jaws in the two James Bond films? But if you say ""Blofeld"" to any James Bond fan, they immediately know who you are talking about. There is no suspense. McClane walks into a situation and then starts shooting, so we really don't feel anything for him or his son.And Courtney is really never given anything to do with his portrayal of John Jr. He is an undercover CIA agent who has to deal with an increasingly difficult situation, but the development of his relationship with his father is laughable and does nothing to make him likable. And because he isn't likable, we don't care about what happens to him.Maybe this is the studio's way of setting up the sequel, ""Die Hard with Charm"". Die Hard Jr. (Courtney) attends charm school to make him a more likable character. While there, the strict German headmistress, Fraulein Gruber (Alan Rickman in drag) decides to extract her revenge. The story almost writes itself.",2,A Pretty Dismal Day To Feel Dead...

None of the three sequels made so far is as good as the original (which was Oscar-nominated in four categories, including Best Film Editing), but they all are still decent action movies &#8211; probably much better than &#8220;A Good Day to Die Hard,&#8221; the fifth installment which is easily the least effective of the popular series.Once again, Bruce Willis&#8217;s John McClane finds himself at the wrong time in the wrong place. This time the story begins in Moscow, where John is reunited with his estranged son Jack, in the middle of the attack by heavily armed men trying to capture a certain Russian witness. This is a pretty contrived set-up, but we can ignore it as long as the action set-pieces that follow are good.Action sequences are fast and loud, with so many cars sliding, flipping and crashing into each other, or so many bullets flying and finally everything in sight exploding, but the film fails to build up tension because of the poor editing and redundancy. The film&#8217;s action scenes just drag on, not knowing where to go or when to stop.But perhaps the most disappointing part of the movie is the lack of charisma, if not on the part of the star. Bruce Willis&#8217;s character needs a supporting character, be it a villain or ally, who can hold his/her own, someone like Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s Zeus Carver or, of course, Alan Rickman&#8217;s Hans Gruber. Jai Courtney as Jack McClane is not bad; he is just passable. As to the Russian &#8220;terrorists,&#8221; they are mere cyphers, absolutely no menace to John McClane from the beginning.With the weak storyline and unmemorable characters, &#8220;A Good Day to Die Hard&#8221; is at best another routine blockbuster. It is not terrible, but a routine action movie is not what we want from the &#8220;Die Hard&#8221; series.",2,"Least Effective ""Die Hard&#8221; Entry",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1953,"['been', '25', 'years', 'first', '8220', 'Die', 'Hard', '8221', 'featuring', 'world', '8217', 'unluckiest', 'cop', 'John', 'McClane', 'hit', 'screen', '1988', 'None', 'three', 'sequels', 'made', 'so', 'far', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'was', 'Oscar-nominated', 'four', 'categories', 'including', 'Best', 'Film', 'Editing', 'are', 'still', 'decent', 'action', 'movies', '8211', 'probably', 'much', 'better', '8220', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', '8221', 'fifth', 'installment', 'easily', 'least', 'effective', 'popular', 'series.Once', 'again', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '8217', 'John', 'McClane', 'wrong', 'time', 'wrong', 'place', 'time', 'story', 'Moscow', 'where', 'John', 'reunited', 'estranged', 'son', 'Jack', 'middle', 'attack', 'heavily', 'armed', 'men', 'trying', 'capture', 'certain', 'Russian', 'witness', 'pretty', 'contrived', 'set-up', 'can', 'ignore', 'as', 'long', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'follow', 'are', 'good.Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'fast', 'loud', 'so', 'many', 'cars', 'sliding', 'flipping', 'crashing', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'bullets', 'flying', 'finally', 'everything', 'sight', 'exploding', 'film', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'poor', 'editing', 'redundancy', 'film', '8217', 'action', 'scenes', 'just', 'drag', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'go', 'when', 'stop.But', 'perhaps', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'movie', 'lack', 'charisma', 'not', 'part', 'star', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '8217', 's', 'character', 'supporting', 'character', 'be', 'villain', 'ally', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'his/her', 'own', 'someone', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', '8217', 'Zeus', 'Carver', 'course', 'Alan', 'Rickman', '8217', 'Hans', 'Gruber', 'Jai', 'Courtney', 'Jack', 'McClane', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'passable', 'Russian', '8220', 'terrorists', '8221', 'are', 'mere', 'cyphers', 'absolutely', 'menace', 'John', 'McClane', 'beginning.With', 'weak', 'storyline', 'unmemorable', 'characters', '8220', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', '8221', 'best', 'routine', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'terrible', 'routine', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'want', '8220', 'Die', 'Hard', '8221', 'series']",N/A

This turkey, ""A Good Day To Die Hard"", was a complete waste of time and money.  It is so bad that it is just one more of those movies that I have to ask myself:  ""Why did they even bother making it""?  It was an easily answered question: ""It's the money, stupid"".  This movie is nothing more than a con, a means of getting you to spend your hard-earned bucks and using it's past successes to lure you into believing that you're going to be entertained by another over-the-top action movie.  ""A Good Day..."" is loud and obnoxious and so ridiculous in virtually every aspect of it's production that I was barely able to sit through the whole mess. Among the more annoying aspects of this movie is the fact that there is not even the merest hint of character development.  McClane's son, played by Jai Courtney, is just there, a totally unlikeable character from the get go.  There is absolutely no believable chemistry between Willis and Courtney.  I never believed for a second that there was any kind of father-son bond.  There was, of course, the obligatory and woefully unconvincing reconciliation scene where father and son have to fess up that they actually love one another, etc.  Because of the animosity displayed by the son throughout the movie towards his father up to that point, it was an obvious set-up for this scene--and a wasted one.  I just had absolutely no feelings about ANY of the characters in this film, let alone this totally unbelievable father-son relationship.Even the bad guys stunk in this film.  Rasha Bukvic tried to play one the main badass heavies and seemed to be trying--and completely failing--to channel Christoph Waltz from ""Inglorious Basterds"".  He was so unconvincing that I was just sorry that he was not terminated earlier than he was just to be done with his horrible acting. I won't even bother to get into the pathetic script, dialogue and plot holes.  Suffice it to say that this wannabe buddy movie was a complete disaster from beginning to end.  I would strongly recommend that you not waste your money on watching it as I did.  If you're going to watch it, wait until it shows up as a free offering sometime in the near future.

1639054,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B00BUADSMQ,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[55, 65]","This is a difficult film to review.Die Hard 5 is not going to please you if you are hoping for a film like the first Die Hard: underdog good cop in a situation over his head struggling to make things turn out right while the government/cops etc. try to to handle the situation.The GOOD:This film is an excellent action movie with a couple of ridiculous scenes--like the transition from bridge to road below, or from chopper to roof, etc. You'll understand. The action is incredible and beautifully shot. The car chase alone is a new experience, the way the bystanders and cars get tossed about. It's unlike any chase scene I can remember. The only disturbing part is how many innocents John must have killed! lol. His son has a few cool CIA gadgets. There are a few nice plot twists. On it's own, the film is a fun ride, fun to watch, thrills unfolding in a novel way.But . . . it is not Die Hard. It is a weak reflection of the series we adore. Here's why:1) The beginning is slow, with John literally standing around while his son does his thing. I don't EVER want to see my beloved John McClane loafing around like a lost puppy! What a lame moment. He keeps calling his son's name and truly resembles a lost old man.2) John actually whines throughout the movie. What is that about?During the chase he is talking to himself and most of the lines are lame.Throughout the movie he complains that he is ""on vacation."" When did this turn into an intended vacation? It was NEVER a vacation! He went there to help his son!He says ""Jesus Christ!"" more than a crazed Baptist minister on Sunday. I was actually guessing when he would say it again and laughing.3) John's son sucks. Why am I watching his son? Why is my hero following his son around? It would have been a million times better if John had seen his son get killed and went out for revenge. But, no. Instead, I have to hear his son whine and see his son fight bad guys with cool CIA gadgets. While the American legend and super cop John McClane . . . helps out.4) No cops in Russia!?! No special forces Spetsnaz or something? The terrorists and John crash through the cities and no one shows up to stop them. No one. That is a big no no. How silly.5) The villain's plot goal is one we've seen too many times before. I won't spoil it, but come on. They could not have cooked up an original threat? The last Die Hard did that well, putting John out of his element. This is simply old hat. When you discover what it is, you'll groan.6) The ending scene is literally a mushy musical Wonder Years, Hallmark, Lifetime moment!!!! I know what they are trying to say about John's family, but come on! Come to the point in a more creative way. Or don't at all. Let us assume it has happened. I would rather John had just yelled, ""Yippy KiYay!"" into the camera until the credits rolled.I hate giving negative remarks about this film. There are quite a few fun John McClane moments as well as a few touching moments done well. But the film either tries too hard or tries too little when developing the relationship between father and son.I cannot shake the feeling that his son Jack is intended to do a spin-off movie. They set it up that way, with Jack overshadowing his father a little. I hate that idea.Rent it.
