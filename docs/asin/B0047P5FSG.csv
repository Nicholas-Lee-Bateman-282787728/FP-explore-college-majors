Yes, but it's much less expensive to rely on gore via special effects and go right to the heart of visual terror rather than to think about the story line and pay for a good script and a good production crew.  They're paid to produce as quickly as possible - kind of like buying off the rack vs. custom made.  The masses are accustomed to being spoon fed their horror and they often don't distinguish between quality and the lack thereof.  There's a reason all slasher movies look alike - they are.  They're cookie cutter without much in the way of imagination or talent, and this movie just follows suit.  A truly successful horror movie will scare the bejeevers out of you and keep you creeped out throughout the whole movie without even showing any blood. Those are the movies you think about long after you've watched them. They are few and far between but it is possible to make one.  I'm waiting patiently for that to happen again as soon as Hollywood gets its head out of its tush, ponies up and pays for quality writing.",3,Nothing different,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,1112,"['Someone', 'previously', 'commented', 'asking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'horror', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Yes', 'much', 'less', 'expensive', 'rely', 'gore', 'special', 'effects', 'go', 'right', 'heart', 'visual', 'terror', 'rather', 'think', 'story', 'line', 'pay', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'production', 'crew', ""'re"", 'paid', 'produce', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'kind', 'buying', 'off', 'rack', 'vs.', 'custom', 'made', 'masses', 'are', 'accustomed', 'being', 'spoon', 'fed', 'horror', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'quality', 'lack', 'thereof', 'reason', 'slasher', 'movies', 'look', 'are', ""'re"", 'cookie', 'cutter', 'much', 'way', 'imagination', 'talent', 'movie', 'just', 'suit', 'truly', 'successful', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'scare', 'bejeevers', 'keep', 'creeped', 'out', 'whole', 'movie', 'even', 'showing', 'blood', 'are', 'movies', 'think', 'long', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'possible', 'make', 'one', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'patiently', 'happen', 'again', 'as', 'soon', 'Hollywood', 'head', 'tush', 'up', 'pays', 'quality', 'writing']",N/A
1388683,AT94ICL01YHU0,B0047P5FSG,"Automated Message ""estrus jones""","[1, 10]","Props to director Deon Taylor for putting his reputation on the line with ""Chain Letter,"" (about a chain letter) to expose J-horror darling ""Ringu"" for the unimaginative sham it is and always has been.Because a chain letter on videocasette is still a chain letter. What is a VCR tape anyway? Is that like an 8-track, but significantly larger?Speaking of phones, Taylor co-directed ""Dead Tone,"" about a prank call dialed to the wrong dude. The movie poster for that groundbreaking 2007 film featured a corded phone dripping blood against what looks like a really rusty fridge. I don't know why a phone would have a cord attached to it. Is that supposed to symbolize a phone in a noose? Would that scare me?Such a simple thing, really, chain letters. They probe us at our deepest, basest core -- our beastly underpinnings that yank your head by the temples every time some idiot thinks that turning on his left blinker means he can just COME ON OVER into my lane!Chain letters are the most rudimentary form of terrorism. They're totally random, uncertain, conducted by simple means, spread like a virus.""Chain Letter"" is an allegory of America's obsession with ""the latest thing,"" perhaps as some passive-aggressive form of trying to win friends. Either that, or it is a love letter to the nigh-viral libido pulsating within our sheep mentality. (After all, bestiality IS the new taboo.)But above all, ""Chain Letter,"" is a horrible film. It is, at heart, an artistic rebellion against good ideas. It's called making a statement. It's what artists do.

We watched a were-wolf movie and decided to look at this picture.  When it was on cable, I didn't really pay attention to much of it.  Since I like some gore, and saw a little bit, I bought the movie.  If you are a gore hound, then this movie is for you.  People died horrible deaths.  I did not realize this was a slasher film, which is not one of my favorite horror genres.  My daughter became upset on some of the parts.  She watches too much, ""Criminal Minds"".  She felt that the way some of the casts died, could have happened that way in real life.  My sister really was having way too much fun watching this picture.  I on the other hand, was hiding my face and screaming on some of the parts.The acting from some was okay, except the annoying brother that was jealous of his sister.  Some of the death scenes were over the top and almost funny.  Not to sound heartless, but the brother getting it was sad, but a little cartoonist. A person couldn't really escape their faith after responding to the chain letter.  The killer was scary looking and really enjoyed his work.  He was brutal and the director enjoyed placing the camera right up close to see the tortures.  One scene, I had to turn the TV down and turn my face away.  It was too painful to listen to the young man's suffering.  This is the part that got my daughter upset, which was a point well taken.After all that, my sister and I enjoyed the movie for its shock value and okay story line.  My daughter did not.  I'am not sure if I will watch it again.

Only it's not as good as those, because it doesn't seem to realize that it's a teen slasher movie and takes itself way too seriously. There are a few fun death sequences in this thing, but most of them are more torture porn than teen slasher. Also, Chain Letter can be too preachy with its ""technology is evil"" message. And the ending is pretty disappointing. Still, I was never too bored while watching Chain Letter. The acting is very good, I will say.

1388693,A3TWCND9PMIOG5,B0047P5FSG,"Marty Kingsley ""That Geek With The Clip-Ons""","[0, 0]","How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulSPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!You'd think that by now Hollywood would know how computers and the internet works. For those that don't know, the internet doesn't produce static nor does it flash barcodes. I guess Hollywood folk assume that because computers have a screen like TVs have a screen then that must mean they produce static. That would be incorrect because TVs (old ones anyway) have different internal working compared to computers. Not that this can make a movie bad, so let's get to the actual review.This movie is awful! Someone decides to kill people because they don't spread spam, wow, that's just wow. Also, like most modern horror films, we barely get to know the main characters, and if we do they aren't that interesting or they're sucky characters so we don't care what happens to them. I hate seeing Keith David and Brad Dourif slumming it in movies like this because both are so much better. I gotta say, 5 years really does affect how some people look, because Noah Segan looked more like a high school student in the 2005 film Brick (course he was around 22 then) than he does in this movie. That's another actor who's way better than this crap. I'll give it this, the movie looks good and the gore effects are decent and it's nice to see practical effects, but there are way better movies than this that have good gore (example: John Carpenter's The Thing, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, pretty much any of the original Nightmare on Elm Street films, and so many more). Even the Saw films, for the most part, at least attempt to make you care about the victims. And the motivations of the killer are never made clear, and they hint at some stupid anti tech cult but they never confirm if it's them.Starting the movie off as a flashback is rarely a good idea, unless it gives you a chance to get to know the main character and actually cares what happens to them. This is not one of those movies. It's amazing how two people don't notice chains hooked up to their cars, or that they're garage door is slightly open. Then there's the fact that the girl chained up decides to lift her head up as she's being dragged, so of course she hits her head on the door. And finally there's the fact that he dad doesn't notice she's chained to the car and continues to drive and it splits her in half and one of her friends is running after the car shouting her name. Hate to break it to you dude, but you don't usually survive getting split in half so yelling her name won't make her less dead.
