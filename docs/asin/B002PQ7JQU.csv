1283222,A2CP4N7R587T3C,B002PQ7JQU,D. A. Nicastro,"[11, 11]","TAXI is one of the classic ensemble comedies ever to surface on the small screen. The writing, directing and acting were always superb! The great cast introduced us to Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Andy Kaufman, Carol Kane and brought us another great series with Judd Hirsch. Season five has always been special to me because of its poignancy. Who can forget episodes like: ""Louie and the Blind Girl"", ""Alex's Old Buddy""' and ""Jim's Inheritance""? The only reason that I am not giving this five stars is because it is slightly edited. Seems CBS/Paramount does not like to pay for music rights. We really saw this in season 4 where ""Vienna Waits"" had a completely different score. Season 5 is not as bad: I only noticed one cut: The Piano bar scene in episode ""JIM'S MARIO'S"". Believe it or not, all of the other original music (including ""You Are The Sunshine Of My Life"" from JIM'S INHERITANCE and ""Cheek to Cheek"" from ELAINE AND THE MONK) is still intact. All in all, Season Five is a triumph!

1283225,A1JVSIWDF0WT22,B002PQ7JQU,GeValero,"[3, 8]","Twenty six years might be a little late to claim dissappointment, problem is that although I saw most Taxi's first 4 season in some form through the years, Season 5 never made it in any shape of form down here in Mexico so I hadn't seen a single episode until this very week. Never before did I understand how such a great show could pummel so badly in the ratings. Today I finally do. Sure, Season 4 had a clunker here and there but it had plenty of great episodes. Season 5 doesn't have a single one that fits this category.I am aware the Charles/Charles/Burrows team left around this time to do the equally magnificent CHEERS. At least it's good to know where exactly TAXI's laughs went.You know how a show looks when it's about to be cancelled? TAXI is exhibit A in this category. The cast doesn't seem to be trying much anymore. The jokes are telegraphed way before they occur, specially for Reverend Jim. Latka has thankfully left his ""personalities"" crap behind but his material seems to be getting old in a hurry. Simka's voice might have sounded funny in the beggining, but try enduring it for a whole season! The Alex character who breaks down crying about the death of a 19 year old dog doesn't even ressemble the sharp guy we remmember from past seasons, as recently as the last episode of #4. Suddenly nobody seems to hate Louie anymore and he's become quiet popular for invitations to all types of family events, whatever edge he gave the show is all but gone. The lack of material is so evident the writers even give the bland ""Jeff"" guy more lines than ever before, talk about desperation. Even the shows techinicians don't seem to be giving a damn anymore, notice how when Tony sails out to sea, his shadow from the set's lights moves repeatedly all around the suppossed ""sea skyline"" while nobody seeems to care. Heck, the cabbies don't even seem to be driving taxis anymore, the only reason they show up at the garage is to talk about their problems and the cabs are just there to take them to personal events.Another Amazon reviewer who wrote about Season 4 claimed Andy Kauffman antics killed TAXI, I beg to differ. What truly killed TAXI was the abrupt end to the show's brilliant writing. Think about the awful episode where Elaine's son takes up boxing and ends up with a broken nose. What kind of earth-shattering or even entertaining dilemma is that for a show like TAXI? (never mind that the kid actor sucks). I won't even get into detail about the one where Alex's dog dies since I don't want MARLEY & ME lovers to follow me to this other section of reviews but, when Alex breaks down crying at the end of the episode it felt like such a desperate plea to extract any emotion from the audience, I truly felt simpathy for Judd Hirsch, no wonder he never got a decent job after TAXI was cancelled. Still, the most ridiculous episode that comes to mind is the one where Elaine dates Simka's monk cousin who has one of those unbelievable sitcom plots in which he has precisely one week to enjoy the world's delights; every previous actor who had protrayed a character from Latka's country has been brilliant enought to speak his hilarious made up language,  until this guy came along that is; he doesn't even try, and his dance routines with Elaine and by himself are beyond pathetic.Enough, I don't even want to think about Season 5 anymore, luckily there's the first 4 season to watch over and over again and let's not forget it's not like other great shows didn't end up tanking eventually, still, by its fifth season CHEERS was just beggining to pick up steam.

It would be fun to see these in hd someday as well. In reruns or blu ray. But at least we get them on dvd. Of course Andy Kaufman died very young just a few years after this show ended from cancer and his loss to comedy was immense. Much like ernie kovacs back in the 1960's. But that doesn't make this show any less enjoyable, nor does the fact that jeff conaway destroyed his career with drugs and eventually died from them 25 years later or so.

Factory [In reality: CBS/Paramount...as another reader has corrected me] for making it possible for us to have the complete series of Taxi- and I own the entire series....but, I now see why such a once-great show was cancelled. This final season is not like the first four seasons. In this final season, the laughs are fewer and further between; Each episode seems to focus on just one character, and their private life- so the great cast interaction that made the first four seasons so great is less in evidence in this season, as the show takes on more of the feeling of a drama or soap opera, rather than a brilliant sit-com. Many of the episodes are just plain boring: Tony goes to sea with his Merchant Marine father- yawn! (we are deprived of the rest of the Taxi cast for 80% of the episode); Alex deals with his elderly dog (If you love dogs, as do I, this is a real tear-jerker- which is NOT what I watch comedy for!); Jim's father croaks (oh, what a laugh-riot, watching someone deal with the death of a parent alone in their apartment- NOT!); Elaine dates a short, bald insecure dweeb (uh...it could happen...) and the series culminates in an episode about Simka's menstrual problems!(Nothing remotely funny about that).I don't understand why they chose to tamper with such a once-great show, thus ruining it and sealing it's demise- but they did. If you're a die-hard Taxi fan, you'll want this season anyway; If you're just looking to buy a season or two, or have never seen this show and want to try it, buy season 2, 3, or 4....but not this 5th and final season.Having said that, there a few eps here which are real gems, and which no Taxi fan would be without- such as A Grand Gesture(It would be worth purchasing this season just for Scatman Crothers's performance in that ep!- and it is also one of the only eps to feature Jeff [J. Alan Thomas] quite prominently in the story (IMO, he was a great character and should have been included in more eps).Another problem with this season is that Carol Kane, as Latka's wife, Simka, became a regular, and her screeching, grating voice is sheer torture! If nothing else, I'm sure her voice would have caused this show's cancellation- why any producer would inflict such agony on the fans of their show is beyond me, but it was definitely a major factor in the ruination of this show.Just like the last season of All In The Family, us die-hard fans buy even the seasons which we know are crap (even though I'll likely only atch two eps from this season again)- but for ""normal"" people, stick with seasons 1-4, which are great. This final season is more like an illustration of how to ruin a great show by isolating the characters who worked great as an ensemble, but who just aren't funny alone, without the contrasts and interactions of the others.",2,A Great Comedy...Devolves Into A Soap Opera,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,2826,"['applaud', 'Shout', 'Factory', '[', 'reality', 'CBS/Paramount', 'reader', 'corrected', ']', 'making', 'possible', 'have', 'complete', 'series', 'Taxi-', 'own', 'entire', 'series', '.but', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'such', 'once-great', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'final', 'season', 'not', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'final', 'season', 'laughs', 'are', 'fewer', 'further', 'episode', 'focus', 'just', 'one', 'character', 'private', 'life-', 'great', 'cast', 'interaction', 'made', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'so', 'great', 'less', 'evidence', 'season', 'show', 'more', 'feeling', 'drama', 'soap', 'opera', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'sit-com', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'Tony', 'sea', 'Merchant', 'Marine', 'father-', 'yawn', 'are', 'deprived', 'rest', 'Taxi', 'cast', '80', '%', 'episode', 'Alex', 'deals', 'elderly', 'dog', 'love', 'dogs', 'do', 'real', 'tear-jerker-', 'NOT', 'what', 'watch', 'comedy', 'Jim', 'father', 'croaks', 'oh', 'what', 'laugh-riot', 'watching', 'someone', 'deal', 'death', 'parent', 'alone', 'apartment-', 'NOT', 'Elaine', 'short', 'bald', 'insecure', 'dweeb', 'uh', 'could', 'happen', 'series', 'episode', 'Simka', 'menstrual', 'problems', 'Nothing', 'remotely', 'funny', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'chose', 'tamper', 'such', 'once-great', 'show', 'thus', 'ruining', 'sealing', 'demise-', 'did', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Taxi', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'want', 'season', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'buy', 'season', 'two', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'want', 'try', 'buy', 'season', '2', '3', '4', '.but', 'not', '5th', 'final', 'season.Having', 'said', 'few', 'eps', 'here', 'are', 'real', 'gems', 'Taxi', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'without-', 'such', 'Grand', 'Gesture', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'season', 'just', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'performance', 'ep', 'also', 'one', 'only', 'feature', 'Jeff', '[', 'J.', 'Alan', 'Thomas', ']', 'quite', 'prominently', 'story', 'IMO', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'more', 'eps', 'problem', 'season', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Latka', 'wife', 'Simka', 'became', 'regular', 'screeching', 'grating', 'voice', 'sheer', 'torture', 'nothing', 'else', ""'m"", 'sure', 'voice', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'show', 'cancellation-', 'why', 'producer', 'would', 'inflict', 'such', 'agony', 'fans', 'show', 'was', 'definitely', 'major', 'factor', 'ruination', 'show.Just', 'last', 'season', 'All', 'Family', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'buy', 'even', 'seasons', 'know', 'are', 'crap', 'even', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'only', 'atch', 'two', 'eps', 'season', 'again', 'normal', 'people', 'stick', 'seasons', '1-4', 'are', 'great', 'final', 'season', 'more', 'illustration', 'how', 'ruin', 'great', 'show', 'isolating', 'characters', 'who', 'worked', 'great', 'ensemble', 'who', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'alone', 'contrasts', 'interactions', 'others']",Taxi: The Final Season

1283235,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B002PQ7JQU,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[3, 5]","This final season has some great episodes, but it nearly ends with a major atrocity for us ""Taxi"" fans.  Remember the episode where Iggy buys Mario's and all the cabbies help him bring in customers, and he and Alex sits at the piano and everyone sings and has a great time?  Well, the entire piano playing and singing was edited out.  Absolutely no music or singing was viewed or heard.  I was looking forward to seeing this complete episode again and they ruined it by that catastrophic editing.That's just one disappointment.  Another is the two part episode of ""A Taxi Celebration"".  The picture quality and sound quality is very bad compared to the rest of the episodes.  Luckily, they look fine on the original episodes but what a disappointment, nonetheless.And, another strange thing that happened while I was watching all three of the DVD's, after the sixth episode, the DVD seems to want to play the second episode over again.  Maybe this only happens because I stopped the DVD, and later went back to just hit ""play"" again, but it happened to me on all three DVD's.  Peculiar, huh?To me, the least appealing episodes were ""Travel's with my Dad"" Which is about Tony and his dad, ""Sugar Ray Nardo"" with Elaine's son wanting to try boxing and Elaine being way too overprotective.  And ""Love Un-American Style"" was about Latka and Simka arranging for all the cabbies to meet someone who may be a good match for them.  ""Arnie Meets the Kids"" is rather pathetic because Arnie is pathetic because Elaine is much too beautiful to be with such a balding doofus like him.  It's kinda funny, but Arnie and Elaine? No way.Now, the best episodes which is really like opening a great can of worms because all the other episodes are fabulous classic episodes.  But, if I still have to pick some absolute favorites for this final season, it is definately ""Sceneskies From a Marriage"" where Latka has sex with another cabbie to stay warm and Simka knows just by looking at him that he ""did it with another woman""  so their minister tells Simka that she is suppose to be unfaithful to Latka to save their marriage.  What an excellent interpretation of an extremely warped religion.  Man, then there's  ""Crime and Punishment"", ""Alex Gets Burned by an Old Flame"", ""Louie and the Blind Girl"", ""A Grand Gesture"", and well, all the others.Any ""Taxi"" fan knows what I'm talking about.  This was a fabulous season for ""Taxi"".  It ended as a strong show.  I can't believe that it got canceled when it did.  But, it's great to finally have all five seasons.  But again, why did they do that blasphemous scene cut from ""Jim's Mario's"".  That's so sad.",4,"I'm really disappointed about the scene cut from the ""Jim's Mario's"" episode",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,2633,"['final', 'season', 'great', 'episodes', 'nearly', 'major', 'atrocity', 'Taxi', 'fans', 'Remember', 'episode', 'where', 'Iggy', 'Mario', 'cabbies', 'help', 'bring', 'customers', 'Alex', 'sits', 'piano', 'everyone', 'sings', 'great', 'time', 'Well', 'entire', 'piano', 'playing', 'singing', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'Absolutely', 'music', 'singing', 'was', 'viewed', 'heard', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'complete', 'episode', 'again', 'ruined', 'catastrophic', 'just', 'one', 'disappointment', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'A', 'Taxi', 'Celebration', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'bad', 'compared', 'rest', 'episodes', 'Luckily', 'look', 'fine', 'original', 'episodes', 'what', 'disappointment', 'nonetheless.And', 'strange', 'thing', 'happened', 'was', 'watching', 'three', 'DVD', 'sixth', 'episode', 'DVD', 'want', 'play', 'second', 'episode', 'again', 'Maybe', 'only', 'stopped', 'DVD', 'later', 'went', 'back', 'just', 'hit', 'play', 'again', 'happened', 'three', 'DVD', 'Peculiar', 'huh', 'least', 'appealing', 'episodes', 'were', 'Travel', 'Dad', 'Which', 'Tony', 'dad', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Nardo', 'Elaine', 'son', 'wanting', 'try', 'boxing', 'Elaine', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'overprotective', 'Love', 'Un-American', 'Style', 'was', 'Latka', 'Simka', 'arranging', 'cabbies', 'meet', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'match', 'Arnie', 'Meets', 'Kids', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'Arnie', 'pathetic', 'Elaine', 'much', 'too', 'beautiful', 'be', 'such', 'balding', 'doofus', 'kinda', 'funny', 'Arnie', 'Elaine', 'way.Now', 'best', 'episodes', 'really', 'like', 'opening', 'great', 'can', 'worms', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'fabulous', 'classic', 'episodes', 'still', 'have', 'pick', 'absolute', 'final', 'season', 'definately', 'Sceneskies', 'Marriage', 'where', 'Latka', 'sex', 'cabbie', 'stay', 'warm', 'Simka', 'just', 'looking', 'did', 'woman', 'minister', 'tells', 'Simka', 'suppose', 'be', 'unfaithful', 'Latka', 'save', 'marriage', 'What', 'excellent', 'interpretation', 'extremely', 'warped', 'religion', 'Man', 'then', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Alex', 'Gets', 'Burned', 'Old', 'Flame', 'Louie', 'Blind', 'Girl', 'Grand', 'Gesture', 'well', 'others.Any', 'Taxi', 'fan', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'was', 'fabulous', 'season', 'Taxi', 'ended', 'strong', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'got', 'canceled', 'when', 'did', 'great', 'finally', 'have', 'five', 'seasons', 'again', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'blasphemous', 'scene', 'cut', 'Jim', 'Mario', 'so', 'sad']",Taxi: The Final Season
