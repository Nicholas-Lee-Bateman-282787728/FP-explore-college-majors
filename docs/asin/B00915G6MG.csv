Mark Harmon returns as crusty Senior Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, head of a high profile investigation team and father figure of an improvised family.""NCIS"" begins its tenth season dealing with the aftermath of an horrific terrorist attack on the NCIS headquarters.  The attack injures several team members and leaves pathologist ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum) clinging to life after a heart attack.  The early episodes are devoted to a ruthless hunt for the man responsible for the attack, and to dealing with the trauma of the attack, which affects the entire organization.  A thoughtful two part episode later in the first half of the season deals specifically with post-traumatic stress disorder as a key factor in a murder.  The investigation will cause the team, especially Gibbs, to confront its effects.  Another story arc beginning after the holiday break will place the careers and lives of several characters at risk; some will not survive.  A spring episode may reveal the origins of forensic technician Abby Sciuto's (Pauley Parrette) relationship with Gibbs.""NCIS"" is pretty good about taking care of its recurring characters, and this season is no exception.  Special Agent Tony DiNozzo's father (Robert Wagner) makes a poigant return visit in the Christmas episode, to stay with Tony in his heretofore unseen bachelor apartment.

FBI Agent Fornell (Joe Spano) will reluctantly assist Gibbs in a case involving their mutual ex-wife.

NCIS - has succeeded in lasting 10 years, same as it's predecessor JAG and I'm looking forward to season 11 starting this fall. Just when I thought they couldn't top the season 9 cliff hanger with the explosion of a car bomb outside the NCIS offices in the Washington DC Navy Yard and leaving us thinking that Duckie had been killed suffering a massive heart attack at the shock of learning the team and many other occupants of NCIS might have been killed by a car bombing, they have a 2 part episode in the middle of the season killing off ZIva's father, the Israel Musaud leader Eli David and and the wife of the NCIS director which leads up to the hunt of the assassin by Ziva who in her heart wants revenge for the death of her father. She finds and kills the person responsible which leads up to an outside investigation which has us believing they are after Ziva when in the end it turns out to be a cover up and the person they are after is team leader Leo Jethro Gibbs. This also leads up to the surprise visit of former JAG commanding officer Admiral AJ Chegwedden who is no longer working at JAG but is now a high price high power attorney and who would be best to help with the defense of GIbbs. This is a top notch series and the cast is top notch with Mark Harmon as Gibbs who not only is the lead character but also a co producer of the show, and a top notch supporting cast Michael Weatherly as ever wize cracking and movie efficianado Anthony DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as former Israeli Mossad Assassin  Ziva David brought in to replace agent Caitlin Todd who was killed by Ziva's half brother at the end of season 2, Sean Murray as the MIT computer geek Timothy Mcgee, Pauley Perette as the goth, tattoo bearing and very savvy Forensic Specialist Abby Sciuto, Rocky Carrol as NCIS Director Leon Vance who came in after season 5 to replace the former director Jenny Shepard after her death, David McCallum as the chief medical examiner Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, and Brian Dietzen who plays Ducky's medical assistant Jimmy, both in the field and in the morgue. This show came along at a time when CSI was running strong in the ratings and I have a gut fealing that NCIS will out last CIS because of the great stories and the raport between team members, and believing and following Gibbs rules, the drama and the humor with the wake up head slaps. This is not only a top notch investigative team but also a family that I have grown to love in the 10 years this show has been on. I don't know what I will do when this show finally comes to an end. I fully believe it will be when the cast and producers decide it's time to end it and not failing ratings that will kill this show as it is consistently in the 10 ten ratings week after week and reruns of the show are run almost daily on cable USA network.

It seemed as though there were too many new writers or that the writers from past seasons were becoming a bit tired. The acting was as good as it usually is. The cast is excellent. Yet some of the story-lines this season were poorly handled, the character development became much more stagnated, and there was less time given to focusing on the different characters in individual episodes focused primarily upon them. The season is enjoyable from beginning to end, but what happened, exactly? Tony is barely being 'funny' this season, even when making jokes. Yet one of the best episodes was one Michael Weatherly directed and I don't think it's an acting problem. The writing feels as if it's less inspired this year. It goes through the motions too much, and when episodes focus on character development and a larger story arc they become jarringly interjected with episodes that seem to be written as if prior episodes were not made so as to add 'filler' to the time, expanding the series by episode count but not in quality.I love this series. I love these characters. Yet I found this season to be a bit of a minor disappointment. I hope the writers have improved upon this season with the next (which I still haven't seen), but I'm not looking forward to the loss of a central character (I will avoid saying who in case anyone is 'unspoiled') and I am not quite sure about the current direction. There were a lot of missed opportunities this year - Ducky's health at the beginning of the season was glossed over, Jimmy Palmer was barely in the season, and Abby was reduced to only working on the various crime issues at hand with less development - there is only one episode this season where Abby gets a chance to really shine, and then she seems to be a background character more than before.Not to mention that the finale and the last few episodes were more over-the-top and less effective than past season wrap-ups.Surely there are more NCIS fans who found this season fun without being anywhere near the quality of the past few seasons?

1582881,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B00915G6MG,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[0, 0]","The big story of the summer for this series, as many of us know, was Cote De Pablo's planned departure from the series after the first two episodes of Season 11.  This left me watching Season 10 suspecting that Shane Brennan and Gary Glassberg worked the season at least suspecting Cote was leaving, and writing the second half of the season working to set up closure with Ziva.Having said that, I found Season 10 to be up to the usual high standards this series continually gives.  At this point, dealing with ""The Body Of The Week"" part of the story has become secondary to the doings in the MTAC and between the team.  The interaction between the team and those around it has always been the hallmark of the series, and continued to be in this season.  The cast, as always, were great; and the ""visits""--Diane Neal's Abagail Borin, Joe Spano's Tobias Fornell--were at their usual high standards.This season began wrapping up the ""Harper Deering"" story, followed by Navy Yard bombing's aftermath--Abby being unable to sleep, Ducky fighting to get back to work following his heart attack...in the first half of the season, the episodes that stick out are ""Lost At Sea""--where Neal's CGIS Special Agent Borin and the team investigate a downed helicopter and the murdered pilot of the chopper; the two-parter ""Shell-Shock"", where a Marine suffering from PTSD witnesses the kidnapping/murder of a fellow Marine (Or does he??!?) and Gibbs has to help him sort out what he saw and what he didn't;""Devil's Trifecta"", in which Melinda McGraw returns as the ex-wife of both Fornell and Jethro.  McGraw is magnificent as Diane Gibbs Fornell Sterling--she isn't in the best of moods when she pops up, and the aftermath of Tim McGee having to be her bodyguard one night...and the looks on the faces of Gibbs and Fornell (To say NOTHING of Tobias' reaction) may be one of the funniest moments this series has EVER had.  Robert Wagner comes back as Anthony DiNozzo Sr. for ""You Better Watch Out"", and for the first time, the series goes inside of Tony the Younger's apartment.  The episode that most sticks out in the first half of the season is ""The Namesake"".  This is a brilliant and touching episode, bringing back Ralph Waite as Jackson Gibbs and introducing Billy Dee Williams as Leroy Jethro Moore, the man Gibbs was named for.  It's an episode that deals with the estrangement between Gibbs's father and Jethro the Elder...and Gibbs' mother, who both men loved.  A strong episode, dealing with two old men's pride and stubborness.The season flipped with it's SECOND two-parter--""Shalom Shabbat"" and ""Shiva"".  Michael Nouri makes his final appearance as Ziva's father, the Mossad spymaster Eli David; Paula Newsome makes her final appearance as Jackie Vance, Leon Vance's wife.  Obviously, this is where I began to suspect--upon a second viewing of the season--that Brennan and Glassberg were writing an exit strategy for Ziva; but as the second half of the season progressed, Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance had to adjust to being a widower...but also came to understand Gibbs more, especially when it came to Jethro's avenging of Shannon and Kelly.  For Carroll, the second half of the season was an evolving performance that was done well.  Cote was very, VERY good in the back half--Ziva NEVER lost her focus at work, but was working off the books to pursue (And yes, KILL) Ilan Bodnar.  That second half of the season seemed a stark contrast to Season 1 after ""Bete Noire""--remember Gibbs' workstation running facial recognition on the photo of Ari until the end of the season??!?  Notable in the second half are ""Detour"", where Mallard and Palmer are kidnapped with a body they were taking back to MTAC and have to work to plan an escape, and ""Squall"", in which we meet McGee's father--an Admiral in the Navy--and see the strain in their relationship (Note: Sean Murray has had a lot of fun in dealing with Tim's various family issues--in my review of Season 9, I forgot to talk about ""The Penelope Papers"", and how great Lily Tomlin was as Tim's grandmother).The season's last two episodes actually come after Ziva has avenged both her father's murder and Jackie Vance's murder (The episode--major surprise--is named ""Revenge""), and again, really seem to have been plotted out with the option of Ziva leaving the MTAC.  Colin Hanks' Richard Parsons, the Inspector General investigator, seems to question whether Gibbs is leading a team that ""has a lot of red on their ledger"" (Avengers' line, I know...), and focuses on Gibbs--again, going back to this series go-to story, Jethro sniping Pablo Hernandez all those years ago.  The season finale is unique--Muse Watson returns, so we get Mike Franks as spirit guide again.  But the shock here is John M. Jackson dusting off A.J. Chegwidden from ""JAG"".  It's a great return, somewhat surprising--of course, some probably were thinking ""Chegwidden??!?  They couldn't have gotten Harm or Mac??!?""  Then again, Jackson's return could be just a start of Brennan going full circle...This was a season that got angry after the deaths of Eli and Jackie.  The usual lightness that sometimes is part and parcel of this series was shadowed by knowing that Ziva was on the hunt for Ilan, and KNOWING what she was going to do to Bodnar when she caught up to him.
