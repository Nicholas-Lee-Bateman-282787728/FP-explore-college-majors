But, I don't think it was written as a anthropological study.It's a love story, so lighten up.Sabah is a 40 year old woman, that takes care of her Mom and is supported by her brother while doing so.  Her brother; now the head of the family since his father died, calls the shots for the family.  He overlooks not only her finances, but also how she lives her life.  She is somewhat headstrong and has avoided being paired off in the past.  Chaffing against the strict Muslim rules she has decided to pursued her love of swimming.  This leads to a chance meeting of a single Christian man, who she forms a first a friendship with. Over time, it blossoms to much more. In the mean time, her young niece is being paired off by her brother in lieu of being sent to a university. This is very much not to Sabah or her niece's liking. Things come to a crucial point for the niece.  Other issues are revealed and Sabah's budding relationship needs to end or be made known.  All of these factors force the family to reconsider how they have been living.Besides the peculiar mix of Muslim inconsistencies:Sabah nearly has a unibrow, but her mother's, are painted on.Sabah's brother's wife, does not wear a hijab, but the older sister is expected to.  Muslim's I knew it was stricter for married women than single ones. But then the brother's wife is not from the old country.Sabah's mother to me except for the grey hair looks younger than Sabah.Sabah's mother seems ditzy (maybe Alzheimers is implied) not infirm in any way, so caring for her makes no sense.This is a movie to be taken lightly and not examined too closely.I find the love interest character Steve, to be fairly shallowly handled. He is defensive about his divorce and felt his wife traded up (his exact words).  Though he is clearly interested in learning more about Sabah's culture, his character in only lightly handled.  He does come across as a sweet gentle man.  Being quite attractive doesn't hurt either.This is a nice light ""Cinderella"" story and pleasant to watch.",4,"Inconsistent, but a nice chic flick",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,2170,"['Having', 'known', 'Muslims', 'know', 'faith', 'rules', 'adhere', 'are', 'map.This', 'movie', 'inconsistent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'written', 'anthropological', 'study.It', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'lighten', 'up.Sabah', '40', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'care', 'Mom', 'supported', 'brother', 'doing', 'so', 'brother', 'now', 'head', 'family', 'father', 'died', 'shots', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'finances', 'also', 'how', 'life', 'somewhat', 'headstrong', 'avoided', 'being', 'paired', 'off', 'past', 'Chaffing', 'strict', 'Muslim', 'rules', 'decided', 'pursued', 'love', 'swimming', 'chance', 'meeting', 'single', 'Christian', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'friendship', 'time', 'much', 'more', 'mean', 'time', 'young', 'niece', 'being', 'paired', 'off', 'brother', 'lieu', 'being', 'sent', 'university', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'Sabah', 'niece', 'liking', 'Things', 'come', 'crucial', 'point', 'niece', 'Other', 'issues', 'are', 'revealed', 'Sabah', 'budding', 'relationship', 'end', 'be', 'made', 'known', 'factors', 'force', 'family', 'reconsider', 'how', 'have', 'been', 'peculiar', 'mix', 'Muslim', 'inconsistencies', 'Sabah', 'nearly', 'unibrow', 'mother', 'are', 'painted', 'on.Sabah', 'brother', 'wife', 'not', 'wear', 'hijab', 'older', 'sister', 'expected', 'Muslim', 'knew', 'was', 'stricter', 'married', 'women', 'single', 'ones', 'then', 'brother', 'wife', 'not', 'old', 'country.Sabah', 'mother', 'grey', 'hair', 'younger', 'Sabah.Sabah', 'mother', 'ditzy', 'maybe', 'Alzheimers', 'implied', 'not', 'infirm', 'way', 'caring', 'sense.This', 'movie', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'not', 'examined', 'too', 'closely.I', 'find', 'love', 'interest', 'character', 'Steve', 'be', 'fairly', 'shallowly', 'handled', 'defensive', 'divorce', 'felt', 'wife', 'traded', 'up', 'exact', 'words', 'clearly', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'Sabah', 'culture', 'character', 'only', 'lightly', 'handled', 'come', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'man', 'Being', 'quite', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either.This', 'nice', 'light', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'pleasant', 'watch']",Sabah: A Love Story

Sabah lives with her mother and is her designated guardian.  There is also an older brother, his wife, another sister and her daughter.  All of the women are under the thumb of the eldest who is doing the late father's bidding by looking after all of them.  The niece absolutely dismisses the customs of Muslim dress, behavior and absolutely refuses to succumb to the tradition of having a husband picked out for her.  Sabah is continually sneaking around, making up stories, and trying desperately to be with Steven, her new friend.  Watching all these antics take place is funny as well as being frustrating not only to Sabah but Steven who wants very badly to make this relationship work.  Can you be faithful to your family's faith and culture and still try to blend in to the Canadian ways?  Is it also important to be with the one you love?

One thing leads to another and soon she finds herself in love with the man, which goes against the teachings of her family.  It's a pretty predictable set up and we just get to sit and watch the drama play out.The cast is good.  I didn't find the lead actress very compelling which is probably why I didn't really care if the romance worked out or not.  It's not just that she wasn't beautiful by traditional standards; she just seemed lack luster all around.  Even when she learned the traditional dances, she seemed stiff and wooden.  The Canadian fellow was quite charming and good looking so I had a hard time seeing what kept him going after her in spite of the obvious cultural problems.The rest of the cast was fine.  The mother, who was supposed to be at death's door was  attractive and looked more vital and interesting than Sabah.  The rebellious niece who taught Sabah to dance was very cute; the scenes of her dancing were the best parts of the film.Mostly I think the film suffers from lack of character complexity.

Ironically, Majid's own wife does not don the hijab, or head covering, unlike the other women in the family.There are some inconsistencies in the portrayal of the Muslim culture here. I say this because I spent my childhood in Malaysia, a Muslim nation and was able to observe how Muslim women dressed and behaved. In this movie, Sabah walks about outside with a headscarf, but then she wears revealing dresses with the scarf! This is not how an observant Muslim woman would dress. That being said, Sabah's character is not credible in some aspects - she is strict about wearing the scarf, yet she wears a bathing suit in a public swimming pool which is where she first meets Steven, the potential love interest.These inconsistencies affected the credibility of the story, yet I enjoyed the movie because the two main actors, i.e. Sabah and Steven portrayed their roles very well. Sabah's struggles to come to terms with her burgeoning and long suppressed sexuality and independence are credibly portrayed by the actress. Steven's role as the unsuspecting Canadian 'infidel' who grows to love Sabah despite the culture clash is also well acted. It is a sweet and poignant love story which makes for a fun and interesting watch, but it does oversimplify certain aspects such as the sudden acceptance of Steven by Sabah's family, etc. Overall, a fun watch.",3,"Despite some inconsistencies, this is a lovely romantic drama",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,2107,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'popped', 'up', 'instant', 'play', 'movie', 'rental', 'website', 'subscribe', 'story', 'Syrian', 'Muslim', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'extended', 'family', 'Canada', 'many', 'years', 'Sabah', 'central', 'character', '40-year-old', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'who', 'unemployed', 'cares', 'mother', 'unfortunately', 'Sabah', 'supposed', 'be', 'caring', 'ailing', 'older', 'woman', 'actress', 'Sabah', 'mother', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'ill', 'very', 'old', 'Sabah', 'family', 'headed', 'older', 'brother', 'Majid', 'who', 'taken', 'role', 'family', 'patriarch', 'death', 'Sabah', 'beloved', 'dad', 'Majid', 'very', 'strict', 'women', 'family', 'include', 'sister', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ironically', 'Majid', 'own', 'wife', 'not', 'don', 'hijab', 'head', 'covering', 'other', 'women', 'family.There', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'portrayal', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'here', 'say', 'spent', 'childhood', 'Malaysia', 'Muslim', 'nation', 'was', 'able', 'observe', 'how', 'Muslim', 'women', 'dressed', 'behaved', 'movie', 'Sabah', 'outside', 'headscarf', 'then', 'revealing', 'dresses', 'scarf', 'not', 'how', 'observant', 'Muslim', 'woman', 'would', 'dress', 'being', 'said', 'Sabah', 'character', 'not', 'credible', 'aspects', 'strict', 'wearing', 'scarf', 'bathing', 'suit', 'public', 'swimming', 'pool', 'where', 'first', 'Steven', 'potential', 'love', 'interest.These', 'inconsistencies', 'affected', 'credibility', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'i.e', 'Sabah', 'Steven', 'portrayed', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'Sabah', 'struggles', 'come', 'terms', 'burgeoning', 'long', 'suppressed', 'sexuality', 'independence', 'are', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'actress', 'Steven', 'role', 'unsuspecting', 'Canadian', ""'infidel"", 'who', 'love', 'Sabah', 'culture', 'clash', 'also', 'well', 'acted', 'sweet', 'poignant', 'love', 'story', 'fun', 'interesting', 'watch', 'oversimplify', 'certain', 'aspects', 'such', 'sudden', 'acceptance', 'Steven', 'Sabah', 'family', 'etc', 'Overall', 'fun', 'watch']",Sabah: A Love Story
