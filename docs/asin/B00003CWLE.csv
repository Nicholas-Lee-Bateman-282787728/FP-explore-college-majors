Andersen,"[3, 13]",This is the fifth incarnation of this story (three have been produced within the last few years - the first two being truly dreadful animated films) and for the life of me I can't understand why film makers think this  story so fascinating they have to cram endless versions into our gullets.  Of the three live action versions this is the least satisfying.  There is  no tension between our protagonists - they get along famously from the  start.  We are subjected to two and a half hours of boredom amid lush  photography and deservedly Academy Award nominated Art Direction and  Costume Design.  This is one where you go out humming the sets.

This is much more than a costume drama, and is actually a better film than that upon which it is based. Jodie Foster delivers a versatile and stunning performance, and is more than ably supported by Chow Yun Fat (who up until now has been seen mainly in John Woo type thrillers). This film is epic in quality with sweeping landscapes, excellent period detail, and acclomplished cinematography rarely seen this year.

Jodi Foster and Chow Yun-Fat had suprisingly wonderful chemistry and were perfectly cast in their parts.  This version IS the best because it went beyond the romance and showed the  cultural differences and why it couldn't be.  It showed the passion of both  Anna and King Mongkut, but it showed that the King had to lead his nation  and not think of his heart.  The film also showed who important the  children were to the both of them. The film is a lavish, gorgous, and  amazing because of awe-inspiring sets, costumes, and acting above all.

517471,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00003CWLE,casualsuede,"[5, 5]","People have told me that nothing happens in the first 3/4 of Anna and the King.  However, they are missing the point.  A whole lot happens, however,  it is not about guns, wars or sex.  What happens is that you are whisked  away into another world, another era and you are given an opportunity to  see the Regal Siam before it became Seedy Thailand.The point of view  of this movie is taken from the main female lead, Anna Leonowens, whose  novel the movie is based upon.  She is a typically portrayed Englishwoman  in the 1800's (read: repressed, stiff upper lipped etc) who has left India  with her son, Louis and her two Indian servants.  She accepts a job offer  from the King of Siam to teach his future heir the ways of the western  world, as well as his 57 other children and a few of his wives and  concubines as well.  Along the way, not only does she teach the children,  but also teaches the king about civilized life (which does not include 26  wives or slavery).  This conflict leads to the start of a underlying  romance.That is one of the two main plots.  The other main plot revolves  around skirmishes between Siam and mysterious Burmese forces who are backed  by the British.  The kingdom is in potential peril and things start getting  more intense as the movie draws to it's conclusion.There is also a  subplot.  Tuptin, the Kings newest concubine (he has like 58 of them), has  been purchased from her father, who is a Tea Merchant.  However, Tuptin has  already been in love with another man who is her soulmate.  She is torn  between service to her King and being with the man whom she really cares  for.The first major plotline works well.  While teaching the children,  we see through Anna's eye's the majesty and tranquility of the Siamese  landscape and their rich customs.  I was intrigued and felt like I was  whisked away to another place and time.The Subplot also works very  well in its tragedy.  We begin feeling for the hopelessness that Tuptin  (played beautifully by Bai Ling of Wild Wild West fame) feels when she  realizes that the king will never let her go and the desperate move she  makes to resolve her inner turmoil.The war plot does not work well.  The  outcome of the nature of the conflict is disappointing to say the least and  becomes burdonsome to the plot of the movie.  Andy Tennant, who is a  Romantic Director at heart (his other 2 movies Ever After and Fools Rush In  are wildly romantic GenX affairs) is poor at handling complex war  plotlines.Jodie Foster does a good job (she is a completely reliable  actress) as the repressed teacher and she has this underlying sexual  tension (never realized) with the King who, under his maschoistic society  culturalism, secretly admires Anna.  And it is Chow-Yun Fat who steals the  show (with Bai Ling).  He is so very regal and I wouldn't be suprised if he  ever becomes King of a small South Asian Monarchy.  He has that much  charisma.So, I recommend renting Anna and the King before you purchase  it.  You will like the first 3/4 (where nothing supposidly happens), but  will probably be disappointing at the end, when this war thing is thrown  into the plot to liven things up....Rating: B-",3,National Geographic would be proud.,967507200,"08 29, 2000",2000,3194,"['People', 'have', 'told', 'nothing', 'first', '3/4', 'Anna', 'King', 'However', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'whole', 'lot', 'happens', 'however', 'not', 'guns', 'wars', 'sex', 'What', 'are', 'whisked', 'away', 'world', 'era', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Regal', 'Siam', 'became', 'Seedy', 'Thailand.The', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'taken', 'main', 'female', 'lead', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'movie', 'based', 'typically', 'portrayed', 'Englishwoman', '1800', 'read', 'repressed', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lipped', 'etc', 'who', 'left', 'India', 'son', 'Louis', 'two', 'Indian', 'servants', 'job', 'offer', 'King', 'Siam', 'teach', 'future', 'heir', 'ways', 'western', 'world', 'as', 'well', '57', 'other', 'children', 'few', 'wives', 'concubines', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'teach', 'children', 'also', 'king', 'civilized', 'life', 'not', 'include', '26', 'wives', 'slavery', 'conflict', 'start', 'underlying', 'romance.That', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'plots', 'other', 'main', 'plot', 'revolves', 'skirmishes', 'Siam', 'mysterious', 'Burmese', 'forces', 'who', 'are', 'backed', 'British', 'kingdom', 'potential', 'peril', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'more', 'intense', 'movie', 'conclusion.There', 'also', 'subplot', 'Tuptin', 'Kings', 'newest', 'concubine', '58', 'been', 'purchased', 'father', 'who', 'Tea', 'Merchant', 'However', 'Tuptin', 'already', 'been', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'soulmate', 'torn', 'service', 'King', 'being', 'man', 'whom', 'really', 'for.The', 'first', 'major', 'plotline', 'well', 'teaching', 'children', 'see', 'Anna', 'eye', 'majesty', 'tranquility', 'Siamese', 'landscape', 'rich', 'customs', 'was', 'intrigued', 'felt', 'was', 'whisked', 'away', 'place', 'time.The', 'Subplot', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'tragedy', 'begin', 'feeling', 'hopelessness', 'Tuptin', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'fame', 'feels', 'when', 'king', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'desperate', 'move', 'resolve', 'inner', 'turmoil.The', 'war', 'plot', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'outcome', 'nature', 'conflict', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'burdonsome', 'plot', 'movie', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'who', 'Romantic', 'Director', 'heart', 'other', '2', 'movies', 'Ever', 'Fools', 'Rush', 'are', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'GenX', 'affairs', 'poor', 'handling', 'complex', 'war', 'plotlines.Jodie', 'Foster', 'good', 'job', 'completely', 'reliable', 'actress', 'repressed', 'teacher', 'underlying', 'sexual', 'tension', 'never', 'realized', 'King', 'who', 'maschoistic', 'society', 'culturalism', 'secretly', 'Anna', 'Chow-Yun', 'Fat', 'who', 'show', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'so', 'very', 'regal', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'suprised', 'ever', 'King', 'small', 'South', 'Asian', 'Monarchy', 'much', 'charisma.So', 'recommend', 'renting', 'Anna', 'King', 'purchase', 'will', 'like', 'first', '3/4', 'where', 'nothing', 'supposidly', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointing', 'end', 'when', 'war', 'thing', 'thrown', 'plot', 'liven', 'things', 'up', '.Rating', 'B-']",N/A

Aren't most movies fictions? This is a movie, not a documentary for crying out loud. As a fictious story, based on an historical event, it was great. But if you want to watch a movie that is over 90% accurate to the historical facts, this one is not for you. Also, although there is no violent war scenes, there are violent/brutal scenes like blowing a guy's head and chopping off a female's head, which would bother some people.

Hollywood, or rather, the public has never embraced a film with a cohesive plot, and it doesn't surprise me that Anna &amp; the King, a film version of the popular musical, was a box office failure. Despite  the fact that it was overlooked in the big screen, Anna &amp; the King is  one of the best films I have seen in a while.Jodie Foster's portrayal of  Anna is admirable -- I couldn't have chosen a better leading actress for  the role. Also, I enjoyed Chow Yon-Fat's performance as the king; he is  very gifted and charming. Foster and Yon-Fat have very strong chemistry,  although some people have said that they don't.

Most of the film was shot in Malaysia, especially in Penang.  The locations are stunning.The story is well-known and as such lost much of its power.  It fails to be an epic (perhaps Thailand is never a big country and as such is not suitable background for an epic).  It is more serious film that its forerunner - The King and I.  But by pretending to be more realistic, it only turns out again as another westerner's look of an Asian country and its people to satisfy his ego.I gave it half a star on top of three, mainly because the film is a product of many people's hard work and it is a big-budget film which serves as an entertaining Hollywood product with adequate excitement and romance for both sexes.I hope Hollywood can give a less stereotype role for Chow.  For Judie, her acting as an English lady is hardly believable.  But I must admit that she did put a lot of work and sincerity in the role.  This gives her lots of credit.  But I prefer she acting as American FBI agent like Silence of the Lamb or a streetgirl in Martin Scorceses's Taxi Driver.

517481,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CWLE,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","It is a shame that gorgeous, poignant, sweeping epics such as Anna and the King rarely succeed commercially, as they have so much more to offer on so many different levels than your typical box office smash hits.  I, of course, will watch anything starring Jodie Foster, and I thought she was brilliant in her portrayal of the controversial nineteenth-century tutor to the children of the king of Siam.  I should say that I am judging this movie solely on its own merits as a motion picture; I know nothing about Siamese history and culture, and I have never seen this story as portrayed in The King and I.  I do not know if the Siam we see here, most of which was actually filmed on a massive seven-acre lot far from Southeast Asia, provides a true picture of the land in question, but what we see here is undeniably beautiful.  The filmmakers obviously went to great lengths, preparing everything down to the last detail, to provide a setting for this powerful drama that impacts the viewer quite forcefully and takes him/her to a place he/she has almost surely never gone before.  Not only is the landscape captivating, but the palace, monuments, buildings, and religious icons depicted here are exotically stunning, offering even the most Westernized moviegoer the opportunity of seeing and experiencing an entrancing part of Far Eastern culture.  Traditions and actions that seem immoral and unacceptable are at least made understandable, and that is the fulcrum upon which east and west can meet and work together.This is a special love story, one that is enfolded within a complex vista of much larger, sweeping human dramas.  Some might say the romance falls short, but I believe that the type of romance explored in this movie represents perhaps the toughest form of true love, and what it lacks in demonstrable passion, it more than makes up for in depth of feeling.  English schoolteacher Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster) has come to Siam (via India) to instruct the king's oldest son in English, but quite clearly she is not the type of schoolteacher the king expected, as she refuses to fully embrace the protocols of Siam.  She is committed to showing King Mongkut (Yun-Fat Chow) the respect he deserves, but she stands in his presence, seeks him out rather than waiting to be summoned, and expresses her feelings and beliefs in a manner that would never be tolerated by a Siamese subject of the king.  The king obviously admires her spirit, asking her to teach not only his eldest son but all fifty-eight of his children, one of his wives, and one of his concubines.  The children do not respond to her very well at first, a fact which is not helped in the short run by her own son's spirit of independence, but her compassionate disciplinary ways soon make of her the kind of teacher Mongkut wants for his children.  In time, she and King Mongkut develop a fairly close yet perfectly innocent relationship of their own, sharing a mutual bond of love for the children.  Anna is never afraid to tell Mongkut what she thinks or to get involved in situations her conscience will not allow her to ignore, and a mutual understanding and respect is forged among these paragons of culturally different virtues.  All the while, revolution is stirring in the land, and the king's throne and life itself are placed in great danger, yet Anna's presence and fierce spirit of goodness emerge as a secret weapon that stands to change the very fabric of Siam itself.As wonderful and Oscar-worthy as Jodie Foster's performance is here, Chow-Yun Fat's is even better.  King Mongkut is a complicated man, one who cares deeply about his family and his country, seeking to connect with the western world in order to promote the betterment of both.  He does a magical job of balancing the burdens of a difficult kingship with those of a loving father and a very human man.  Tom Felton is also very good as Anna's son Louis, although it took me a few minutes to see him in this new light once I realized I was watching Harry Potter's nemesis Draco Malfoy playing this role, and the children of King Mongkut are all portrayed masterfully by the whole cast of child actors and actresses.  How this movie did not sweep the Academy Awards for 1999 is a mystery to me.Anna and the King is a movie you can easily and happily immerse yourself in, journeying to a very different world and fully investing yourself emotionally in the drama focused on Anna and King Mongkut.  The behind the scenes features afford a way of appreciating even more fully the job everyone associated with this motion picture did, and the deleted scenes offer a most interesting extended opening and ending to a wondrous picture stretched across two and a half hours in its finished form.  If you have a heart, Anna and the King will speak to it, and you will feel touched in a very special way after watching it.",5,A gorgeous modern epic of human drama and love,1058659200,"07 20,

Both, on  the surface, seem headed for disappointment--and, indeed, they do go  through their own crucibles of faith--but their inner resolve and growing  attraction to eachother spur them forward, spur them to eventual  realization of their dreams, in part.Chow Yun-Fat blew me away with his  soft-handed portrayal of a king trying to make the turn into a new era.  He  continually struggles with his duties, his expectations, and his genuine  desire to bring peace and change.  He portrays the necessary strength of a  king while drawing us in with his heartwarming character.  A subtly superb  job of acting.Jodie Foster, a favorite of mine from childhood, also  pulls off her role as British school marm and widow.  At times, I found  myself so aware of her intense acting ability that I was momentarily  reminded that this was all an act.  She's that good--and for that reason, I  felt she stylized a shade too much at points.  But what can I say?  She's  amazing.The photography alone could make this film worth seeing, but it  beats with a human heart and it speaks of values and lessons that are as  timeless as...well, as ancient Siam.

517489,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CWLE,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 4]","This is a masterful piece of filmmaking that over romanticizesa true story to improve its entertainment value.  However, thegenerous use of artistic license can be almost completely forgiven because the final product is so pleasing.  Director Andy Tennant weaves together resplendent visual images, wonderfully warm lighting, magnificent set design, breathtaking locations and beautiful costumes to produce a banquet of sensory delight.  I'm surprised this film didn't get more technical awards, since it was one of the most exhilarating filmmaking experiences I had all year.The story was engaging, though admittedly the characters were overly idealized. This is especially true of King Mongkut, who was far more educated, dashing and genteel than it would have been reasonable to expect. Also, the romantic overtones between him and Anna were a bit much. But the way they were presented enhanced the overall effect so I have difficulty being too critical.The story also had some constructive subtleties.  In addition to the obvious storylines about the education of the children, the effect Anna was having on the King and the impending war, there was a deeper message.  It illustrated the truism that exposure to different peoples and cultures can help us to grow in understanding not only of them, but of ourselves as well.  For it was clear that Anna was as much changed by Siam and the King as he and the children were by her.I was highly impressed with the performance turned in by Yun-Fat Chow.  His English is much improved since my last viewing of him in `Replacement Killers' and `The Corruptor'.  He imbued King Mongkut with dignity and strength without forsaking the human side.  The camera just eats him up.  It is easy to see why he has been the dominating force in eastern films for years.Jodie Foster, on the other hand, was off her game.  She was good as Anna, but frankly, we've come to expect more from her.  Foster is a powerful actor who didn't seem quite sure what to do with this character.  In some scenes she rose to the occasion and gave us the Anna we hoped for; resolute, defiant, opinionated and principled.  At other times she seemed tentative and totally intimidated by the role, just limping through her lines.

The raw talent of Jodie Foster carries through every moment and the charisma and acting of Chow Yun-Fat are outstanding as well. The script is well written and played with many other characters who distinctly add to the story theme and overall quality. While, in reality, Mrs. Leonowens wrote her original memoirs with a bit of exaggeration in terms of her importance to the Siamese Court, this adaptation is pure pleasure to watch. The unspoken romance and human interest elements are realities of that time. Given the predominance of English rule over so much of the world during that period, it is interesting to see how that is dealt with in the movie. The recognition that English feeling their superiority over other cultures and having that recognition seen as well as colonialism for profit addressed added depth to the film. Very enjoyable film. I've watched it several times and I'm glad because I see an added depth or detail with each subsequent viewing.

Based on Mrs. Leonowens' diaries, the movie is accurate in its depiction of events (just how accurate, I do not know). Ms. Foster's English accent was spot-on. Not many actors these days can do an accent and remain consistent throughout (as was Harrison Ford's problem in ""K-19: The Widowmaker"").The movie should have been rated PG, as the violence is minimal and there are only two brief scenes which might be disturbing to younger audiences, and there is absolutely no profanity or sexual content. I have not yet viewed all of the special features on the DVD, but I saw the deleted/extended scenes, all of which total less than 7 minutes in length. Though all of them were really good, the director made the right decision to excise them from the movie. My only disappointment is that there's one scene that was not included as a deleted/extended scene that appears in a trailer available online.

Gross Georg ""imgeorg""","[4, 6]","Writing coach Jerry Cleaver writes that a good story is one that gets to you, one where you identify with the main character, feel what they feel. Well, this story sure got to me. Anna's character was written so that while I couldn't identify with her at the beginning, I certainly could at the end. Unfortunately, I understand the frustrations of a forbidden love only too well.In spite of the unbearable tension, I personally am glad they never kissed. But even after replaying it several times, it's hard to figure out, though, when the turning point was in their relationship. The King indirectly referred to Anna as ""friend"" during the banquet, so I knew Anna had his respect by then, but when did it become more? Hm.This is a movie with incredible sets and an incredible setting, with wonderful costuming, and the CGI work is jawdropping! In the director's commentary, Andy Tennant describes a scene with Chow Yun Fat (""Fattie"") and Jodie Foster, noting they weren't even in the same room together because each cutaway shot was done on different days! What a shock, too, to learn that the rocket scene was totally computerized! I love learning about the filmmaking process!Former child actor Jodie Foster has earned my respect. Tenant said they wanted Kate Winslet to play Anna at first, but there's obviously nothing a voice coach and professionalism can't accomplish with a lot of hard work. That goes for all the actors, none of whom spoke their native languages.Chow Yun-Fat, being Chinese, spoke neither Thai nor much English, but had to learn both for this movie. To my mind, that's genius. I understand this was his first and thusfar only dramatic role (he's known in his country for comedies and martial arts films). If more non-comedic and non-martial arts roles for Asians ever become available, this should open big doors for him. He's a fantastic leading man -- I thought he was gorgeous, and I'll take him over ANY European-American actor any day.Bai Ling, who plays the doomed concubine Tuptim, gives just a powerful, powerful performance, and has to perform throughout the movie without any hair.I have to give director Andy Tennant his props, too. This beautiful film has me interested in his other films. I want to see if he does this kind of work on a regular basis or is this just a wonderful fluke.The children were just adorable, especially the little one who was the King's favorite. Difficult to watch her die, but such was life back then. There are things even a king can't control.I couldn't stand The King and I; I found it terribly racist, like a lot of what came out of Hollywood back then. I was hoping for a more intelligently done movie that more realistically depicted what Thailand was like back then, and I personally am grateful to see a king that doesn't look like Mr. Clean, and doesn't kill himself just because he lost a white woman.I highly recommend watching the outtakes and watching the movie with the director's commentary.

This film does not attempt to stick slavishly to the truth  which is not necessarily a bad thing as this is supposed to be  entertainment and not documentary.The film is set in late 19th century  Thailand and tells the tale of Anna (Foster) and King Mongkut (Chow). The  King employs Anna to act as a tutor to the younger members of his vast  family. The films centres around people coming to terms with new things.  Anna is confronted by Thailand and the King's court and family. The members  of those two groups have to find a way to deal with Anna and finally of  course Anna and the King must come to terms with each other.All of this  coming to terms takes place amidst the gorgeous setting of 19th century  Thailand and is intertwined with many palace intrigues.The setting makes  the film great to watch and the majority of the movie is well paced and  slickly put together.

I read the biography of Anna when I was a young woman and was very impressed with her courage. Though of course I enjoyed the musical when I had more hearing, this video is closer to the reality of the story, the times and politics which were involved in the colonization of the Far East by France, England, and eventually the US. It may not be the happy story everyone prefers to think of, but it is a story of courage and learning on both sides of the equation. To an extent this movie may have blown up the story between Anna and the King of Siam...we don't know what they felt for each other besides great respect, and it is ridiculous to speculate on it. However, the cholera rampant in that area during monsoon season is still a reality in many places, and the sympathy between the characters is probably real. I thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of Malaysia where this was filmed, and though it was a different part for Jodie Foster to play, I felt she handled it well. Reality in life I guess, isn't what the masses want. I would suggest those who were disappointed in this realistic version of the story in comparison to the musical with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner go find the original book written about her in the library and read it.

517509,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003CWLE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","Whatever creative links truly exist we think of the 1999 film ""Anna the King"" as a dramatic version of ""The King and I,"" which was a musical version of the 1946 film ""Anna and the King of Siam,"" which was inspired by the diaries of Anna Leonowens.  Now, it turns out that Anna Leonowens, who was hired to tutor the children of the king of Siam in 1862, greatly embellished her adventures in her celebrated book.  She was neither a governess nor an advisor to the king, her late husband was a desk clerk and not a military officer, and she made up the lurid stories about the king throwing wives into dugeons and the public torture and burning of a consort and the monk she loved.  Of course, history rarely matters to Hollywood and in this case the idea of a romance between Anna and the King overwhelms everything else.The real King Mongkut of Siam was about 60 years old when Anna arrived to teach English to the king's children (you can easily find photographs of him on the web), which would be the final blow to thoughts of romance if all those wives, concubines, public executions, and pagan believes did not turn off any widowed Englishwoman employed in his palace.  But despite its flaws ""The King and I"" is a pretty good romance; the scene where Yul Brynner dances with Deborah Kerr is one the sexiest scenes in Hollywood history (watch how they look at each other after the dance finishes) and there is no profit to be made in trying to convince a modern audience that this story is not a romance.  We might have a more accurate view of George Custer at the Little Bighorn, but we cling to our romanticized vision of ""Anna and the King.""This is a gorgeous film.  The story may well distort the cultural history of what is now Thailand, but the film can certainly inspire you to want to visit.  Yun-Fat Chow plays the King as a figure refined enough to tempt Anna, who is played by Jodie Foster.  Ironically enough, in this version of the tale, which seeks to present King Mongkut as more cultured and civilized than ever, Anna's prejudicial views stand out more than ever.  Every time she stands up to the king, ask yourself if she would really do the same thing to Queen Victoria.  She might be a woman but she is an Englishwoman, not to mention a Christian, and that pretty much settles everything.Ultimately, two things distinguish this version of the story.  The first is that Anna undergoes much more of a transformation that the King this time around.  The person who benefits most from her presence is Prince Chulalongkorn (Keith Chin), heir to the thrown, and most of that education is implied rather than shown.  In fact, there are several scenes that make it clear the King is smarter than Anna; his problem is more than of pride than anything else.  In the major subplot involving Tuptim (Ling Bai), Anna only makes things worse from start to finish.  The second is that the political problems of Mongkut and his kingdom are considerably more serious.  Troops from Burma are crossing the border and killing Siamese.  This raises the possibility of war, but since Burma is under the protection of the British, the stakes are pretty high.  The end result is that more than ever before, Anna gets to be the salvation of the King and the nation of Siam (i.e., Thailand banned ""The King and I"" and they will ban this film too).""Anna and the King"" is a beautiful film, but does not touch the heart the way a true romance should.  In fact, the heart of the film is in the affection of the king for his youngest daughter, Princess Fa-Ying (Melissa Campbell), who truly touches him in a way no other person does.  Director Andy Tennant captured magic with ""Ever After,"" but this film ends up missing the mark.

That's why I can't understand why she agreed to star in this vapid remake of The King and  I.The producers tried hard to give it a modern twist.  They even cast  Hong Kong star Chow Yun-Fat as the King in an effort to be politically  correct and give this role to an Asian.Alas, though, the ghosts of Yul  Brenner and Deborah Kerr haunt this production.  The King and I is just too  ingrained in the public consciousness. Most of all, I missed the songs, and  found their melodies playing in my mind throughout.We all know the  story.  Anna, a proper Englishwoman, comes to Siam to tutor the King's  children in 1862. Supposedly this is based on fact, but I understand that  the Thai government has never permitted any of the versions of this story  to be shown in Thailand and, especially in this version, the history seems  too far-fetched to be true.As all movies tend to reflect the times in  which they are made, this version introduces the concept of colonial  oppression, and in several scenes portray the British as pompous  colonialists.  There are also atrocities by the Burmese and a war that is  generated by a traitor general who wants to depose the King.  However,  although there are some spectacular scenes of the palace, we never really  gain  any real insights into the culture of the Siamese people from their  own point of view.Basically, though, the story is a romance. And it  fails here too.  Jodie Foster plays Anna a bit too prim, and her British  accent seems forced.  Chow Yun-Fat is handsome, but lacks the energy of Yul  Brenner, and the sexual tension between Anna and the King just doesn't  sizzle.Some of the conversations between the characters are much too  long and I found myself either looking at the clock or actually dozing off.

The operative point of this little history is that I know the story of Anna Leonowens and her adventures as the British governess to the many children of the King of Siam story quite well. Apparently, they who made this Jodie Foster movie did not.Both the Rex Harrison version and the Yul Brynner version hinge on the clash between two very strong personality types, the governess and the monarch. But the Jodie Foster movie doesn't treat it, at all. There is only mutual understanding at all times for these two: they NEVER are at odds and the The King is NEVER shown to be a despot--which he was! So, it seemed to me a sort of cinematic wish fulfillment: what if Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner's love were allowed to flourish, and he never did the cruel things that mader her upset? Well, I guess you'd have a movie with no conflict, like &quot;Anna and the King&quot;.  The King is not supposed to be a warm and fuzzy person--he's an absolute monarch acting in a manner unacceptable to the mores of the British governess. Now, a different treatment would have been pershaps to show the situation from HIS point of view: how he went out on a limb to have a personage like this, a woman of independent movement, going around his court, which had to  scandalize his courtiers. Anna had a lot more freedom than any Siamese woman, and enjoyed priveleges denied to many Siamese me--why was this so?So, I spent my time in the movie house waiting for the (what I thought would be) inevitable culture clash between East and West which never came. Literature without conflict is boring, and so is cinema. To be sure, my friend to the left of me in the theatre was crying her eyes out at different junctures, but I sat unsatisfactorily unmoved and quite disappointed.If you're looking for a better love story treatment of the subject, see &quot;The King and I&quot; featuring that dizzying polka which demonstrates the power of the repressed sexual tensions between the King and Anna--all the more interesting because it really looks like she will capitulate to his mastery of her until they are interrupted.If you're looking for a better treatment of culture clash, by all means catch &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; to see how Irene Dunne's Anna can't make sense of her surroundings and the people who populate the court and country, most of all her employer, Rex Harrison's King.If you're looking for something else that looks nice and has modern sensibilities which totally miss the point of the story, then watch this Jodie Foster movie.",3,Major Plot Element Missing Here,1002931200,"10 13, 2001",2001,3057,"['long', 'search', 'finally', 'turned', 'up', 'battered', 'paperback', 'copy', 'Margaret', 'Leighton', 'quot', 'Anna', 'King', 'Siam', 'quot', 'read', 'great', 'voracity', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'story', 'quot', 'King', 'quot', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'was', 'not', 'infrequently', 'shown', 'entry', 'quot', '4:30', 'Movie', 'quot', 'here', 'NYC', 'sometimes', 'stayed', 'up', 'very', 'late', 'Saturday', 'night', 'was', 'even', 'possible', 'catch', 'quot', 'Anna', 'King', 'Siam', 'quot', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'operative', 'point', 'little', 'history', 'know', 'story', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'adventures', 'British', 'governess', 'many', 'children', 'King', 'Siam', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'Apparently', 'who', 'made', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'movie', 'did', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'version', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'version', 'hinge', 'clash', 'two', 'very', 'strong', 'personality', 'types', 'governess', 'monarch', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'movie', ""n't"", 'treat', 'only', 'mutual', 'understanding', 'times', 'two', 'NEVER', 'are', 'odds', 'King', 'NEVER', 'shown', 'be', 'despot', 'was', 'So', 'seemed', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'what', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'love', 'were', 'allowed', 'flourish', 'never', 'did', 'cruel', 'things', 'mader', 'upset', 'Well', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'movie', 'conflict', 'quot', 'Anna', 'King', 'quot', 'King', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'person', 'absolute', 'monarch', 'acting', 'manner', 'unacceptable', 'mores', 'British', 'governess', 'Now', 'different', 'treatment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pershaps', 'show', 'situation', 'HIS', 'point', 'view', 'how', 'went', 'out', 'limb', 'have', 'personage', 'woman', 'independent', 'movement', 'going', 'court', 'had', 'scandalize', 'courtiers', 'Anna', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'freedom', 'Siamese', 'woman', 'enjoyed', 'priveleges', 'denied', 'many', 'Siamese', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'So', 'spent', 'time', 'movie', 'house', 'waiting', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'inevitable', 'culture', 'clash', 'East', 'West', 'never', 'came', 'Literature', 'conflict', 'boring', 'so', 'cinema', 'be', 'sure', 'friend', 'left', 'theatre', 'was', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'different', 'junctures', 'sat', 'unsatisfactorily', 'unmoved', 'quite', 'disappointed.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'better', 'love', 'story', 'treatment', 'subject', 'see', 'quot', 'King', 'quot', 'featuring', 'dizzying', 'polka', 'power', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'tensions', 'King', 'Anna', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'will', 'capitulate', 'mastery', 'are', 'interrupted.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'better', 'treatment', 'culture', 'clash', 'means', 'catch', 'quot', 'Anna', 'King', 'Siam', 'quot', 'see', 'how', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Anna', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'surroundings', 'people', 'who', 'populate', 'court', 'country', 'most', 'employer', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'King.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'else', 'nice', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'totally', 'miss', 'point', 'story', 'then', 'watch', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'movie']",N/A

That was the location  which the filming went on for 2 months in the world largest single movie  set.  It was great to see that actual set with so much effort put into the  set. Even with some of the thing is falling apart but the set gave you  breath-taking impression, it was so great, just like the movie itself.I  went to the set 3 times with my students, friends and relatives and they  all love it, luckily the set now is on the process of restoration. Yet the  palace temple set was gone due to technical problem, so we could only see  it from the movie.I had bought the original VCD of this movie, it was  so excellent!  You get to see the detail to the sets and gestures of all  the actors and actresses.  From the VCD collection, you can clearly see the  chemistry between Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat, you have to watch  carefully because they acted so naturally that you might missed the small  gestures they made. They and all the supporting actors and actresses from  Malaysia looked great together.Last Dec., the current Thai Queen had  officially made statesment that she had no objection to this movie only two  parts needed minor editing, a contrast to the Thai government officers. The  King newphew was surprised that this movie even bowed down to made the King  Mongkut as a hero, he knew that no Thai officers dare to step forward to  clarigy this.  I had the original production script which shown that after  the 5th editing in Thailand, they further edited at least 3 times of this  script which clearly giving more depth to this movie.

I almost didn't see it myself, but once I did see it, I just kept coming back. It's a glorious film.The film itself is done with tremendous diligence -- the costumes, the scenery are fabulous. More importantly, the script is good -- the story itself is a good story. Some films have a really deepening story so that the characters and events are well understood and interconnected, and this is one of those. But the language is also beautiful. It's full of good lines. I think above all, it is Chow Yun-Fat's acting which makes the film -- his humanity, his depth and his nobility. I'm also astounded by the acting of the woman who plays Tuptim... And Jodie Foster fully holds up her end as well.However, I can see many reasons why people would avoid it. The most important of these is that it's banned in Thailand. The Thai people regard it as an very Westernized take on the story. King Mongkut was in fact an old man at the time this happened, and not the charming young Chow Yun-Fat. There's apparently no evidence from King Mongkut's private diaries that he had anything like the feelings expressed in this film. I can easily believe this is true. The film is fiction. At the very least, I doubt very much that Mongkut's heroic stand on the bridge happened like it's portrayed in the film.But I also can't buy that the film comes across as putting down Eastern culture. Unlike in ""The King and I"" (of which it is by no means a simple remake) where Anna clearly has the upper hand, this is an even match. She has as much to learn from him as he from her. England has as much to learn from Thailand as the other way around.My mother didn't like it, because although she's the sort of person which appreciates a good story, she can't stand graphic beheadings. And others of my friends don't like it, because although the like a good battle scene, they can't stand little girls dying in their father's arms -- way too gushy.

517519,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CWLE,Matthew Horner,"[5, 5]","The movies have a way of returning to the tried and true, and that includes the many reincarnations of the story of Anna Leonowens, an English school teacher who set off in 1862 to teach the children - 58 of them! - sired by King Mongkut of Siam. The basis of the story is fact. There was an Anna, and there was a King Mongkut. The movies are all more fact than fiction. First there was Anna and the King of Siam, a 1946 version starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunn. 1955 saw the spectacular, though now dated, The King and I, based on the Rogers and Hammerstein musical. Early 1999 brought an animated version of The King and I, which deservedly flopped. Six months later Anna and the King was released. It, too, failed, though for altogether different reasons, and I doubt we will be seeing much more of Anna or Mongkut at the local multiplex. I do, however, hope many people will buy this 'final' version, for it presents something not often seen these days - true spectacle.When Anna Leonowens arrives in Siam with her young son, Louis, things are not as she expected them to be. It isn't the place, which she knows from having lived in India is a world apart from her native England. After she has been kept waiting for three weeks with nothing to do, she finally meets the king. She demands that she be given something to do. This action stuns both the king and the court, for he is an absolute ruler and considered to be a god. She then reminds him of his promise to provide her with a house outside the palace walls. He angrily refuses to do this, yet, like many people who are used to everyone's doing their biding, he is intrigued and amused by this small woman who dares to stand up to him. He is well educated and thoughtful. He knows a good thing when he sees it.Anna greatly enjoys teaching his children, as well as several of his many wives and concubines. Later, despite being warned, she meddles in some royal affairs, and one of her intrusions leads to tragic consequences. Still, the bond between Anna and the king becomes increasingly stronger and leads to a romance which, under the circumstances, can never be fulfilled. Amid all this, there is the constant threat of English backed Burmese troops, who threaten to topple Mongkat's kingdom.Jodie Foster and Yun-Fat Chow make a striking couple as Anna and Mongkut, and they are a great pleasure to watch. But it is the spectacle which dominates the movie. The sets, especially the royal palace, are monumental. The costumes are lavish and colorful. The photography is as good as any we are likely to see, and the music is first-rate.This version of the story is no more factual than its predecessors, but the makers do at least make the king into an intelligent ruler and depict the British as being rather ruthless, which they must have been in order to have dominated so much of the world at that time. Despite this, the movie failed to make money, and I think this may be because its pluses - the spectacle and the majesty of it - also served to make it seem too old-fashioned to today's young audiences. This makes it a rare treat for older viewers, something to simply enjoy on a quiet summer night.",4,"Retro, spectacular historical romance",1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3175,"['movies', 'have', 'way', 'returning', 'tried', 'true', 'many', 'reincarnations', 'story', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'English', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'set', 'off', '1862', 'teach', 'children', '58', 'sired', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'Siam', 'basis', 'story', 'fact', 'was', 'Anna', 'there', 'was', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'fact', 'fiction', 'First', 'was', 'Anna', 'King', 'Siam', '1946', 'version', 'starring', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Irene', 'Dunn', '1955', 'saw', 'spectacular', 'though', 'now', 'dated', 'King', 'based', 'Rogers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'Early', '1999', 'brought', 'animated', 'version', 'King', 'deservedly', 'flopped', 'Six', 'months', 'later', 'Anna', 'King', 'was', 'released', 'too', 'failed', 'altogether', 'different', 'reasons', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'Anna', 'Mongkut', 'local', 'multiplex', 'do', 'however', 'hope', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'buy', ""'final"", 'version', 'something', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'days', 'true', 'spectacle.When', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'Siam', 'young', 'son', 'Louis', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'expected', 'be', ""n't"", 'place', 'having', 'lived', 'India', 'world', 'apart', 'native', 'England', 'been', 'kept', 'waiting', 'three', 'weeks', 'nothing', 'do', 'finally', 'king', 'be', 'given', 'something', 'do', 'action', 'king', 'court', 'absolute', 'ruler', 'considered', 'be', 'god', 'then', 'promise', 'provide', 'house', 'palace', 'walls', 'angrily', 'do', 'yet', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'everyone', 'doing', 'biding', 'intrigued', 'amused', 'small', 'woman', 'who', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'educated', 'thoughtful', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'it.Anna', 'greatly', 'teaching', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'many', 'wives', 'concubines', 'Later', 'being', 'warned', 'royal', 'affairs', 'one', 'intrusions', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'Still', 'bond', 'Anna', 'king', 'increasingly', 'stronger', 'romance', 'circumstances', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'Amid', 'constant', 'threat', 'English', 'backed', 'Burmese', 'troops', 'who', 'threaten', 'topple', 'Mongkat', 'kingdom.Jodie', 'Foster', 'Yun-Fat', 'Chow', 'make', 'striking', 'couple', 'Anna', 'Mongkut', 'are', 'great', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'spectacle', 'movie', 'sets', 'especially', 'royal', 'palace', 'are', 'monumental', 'costumes', 'are', 'lavish', 'colorful', 'photography', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'music', 'first-rate.This', 'version', 'story', 'more', 'factual', 'predecessors', 'makers', 'do', 'least', 'make', 'king', 'intelligent', 'ruler', 'depict', 'British', 'being', 'rather', 'ruthless', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'order', 'have', 'dominated', 'so', 'much', 'world', 'time', 'movie', 'failed', 'make', 'money', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'pluses', 'spectacle', 'majesty', 'also', 'served', 'make', 'seem', 'too', 'old-fashioned', 'today', 'young', 'audiences', 'rare', 'treat', 'older', 'viewers', 'something', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'quiet', 'summer', 'night']",N/A

Accent is on differences and how humans are able to empathize in spite of them.The specific story of Mrs. Anna Leonowens at Siam's Court has always fascinated filmmakers. There is a first version starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne (1946), the well remembered (at least by my age class... that is to say, ahem! 60 years old) musical with Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr (1956) and finally the present one with remarkable actress Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat in the leading roles.The story is quite well known: an English widower is hired as schoolteacher to give British education to Siam's Crown Princes and Princesses. She arrives to Siam (the present Thailand) from India with her son and servants.As soon as she arrives to Bangkok cultural clashes starts: no one is waiting for her, then women are not expected to talk standing to men, the promised independent accommodations are no available and so on and so on.Quite a good piece of differences to sort out!On this backdrop Mrs. Leonowens met the King and the story is on the move.The whole film is not very original in its proposals; nevertheless the Oscar Nominations for Best Costume to Jenny Beavan (veteran nominee and winner) and Best Set Deco & Art Director to Ian Whittaker and Luciana Arrighi (both nominee and winner too) are more than well deserved as these two areas of expertise are outstandingly fulfilled.Not nominated but very good, IMHO, is cinematography in charge of Caleb Deschanel.Jodie Foster as Mrs. Leonowens is at par with her usual performances yet the character does not demand the best from her.Chow Yun-Fat as King Mongkut is a real surprise: very good and restrained characterization.A fair spectacle to see, I recommend this film to general audiences.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,The English Matron Conquers the Palace.,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2006,"[""'m"", 'always', 'fascinated', 'books', 'movies', 'deal', 'interaction', 'subjects', 'different', 'cultures', 'such', 'Shogun', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Broken', 'Arrow', '.The', 'film', 'Anna', 'King', '1999', 'one', 'such', 'films', 'Accent', 'differences', 'how', 'humans', 'are', 'able', 'empathize', 'spite', 'them.The', 'specific', 'story', 'Mrs.', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'Siam', 'Court', 'always', 'fascinated', 'filmmakers', 'first', 'version', 'starring', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Irene', 'Dunne', '1946', 'well', 'remembered', 'least', 'age', 'class', 'say', 'ahem', '60', 'years', 'old', 'musical', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', '1956', 'finally', 'present', 'one', 'remarkable', 'actress', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'leading', 'roles.The', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'known', 'English', 'widower', 'hired', 'schoolteacher', 'give', 'British', 'education', 'Siam', 'Crown', 'Princes', 'Princesses', 'Siam', 'present', 'Thailand', 'India', 'son', 'servants.As', 'soon', 'Bangkok', 'cultural', 'clashes', 'starts', 'one', 'waiting', 'then', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'expected', 'talk', 'standing', 'men', 'promised', 'independent', 'accommodations', 'are', 'available', 'so', 'so', 'on.Quite', 'good', 'piece', 'differences', 'sort', 'out', 'backdrop', 'Mrs.', 'Leonowens', 'met', 'King', 'story', 'move.The', 'whole', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'proposals', 'nevertheless', 'Oscar', 'Nominations', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Jenny', 'Beavan', 'veteran', 'nominee', 'winner', 'Best', 'Set', 'Deco', 'Art', 'Director', 'Ian', 'Whittaker', 'Luciana', 'Arrighi', 'nominee', 'winner', 'too', 'are', 'more', 'well', 'deserved', 'two', 'areas', 'expertise', 'are', 'outstandingly', 'fulfilled.Not', 'nominated', 'very', 'good', 'IMHO', 'cinematography', 'charge', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel.Jodie', 'Foster', 'Mrs.', 'Leonowens', 'par', 'usual', 'performances', 'yet', 'character', 'not', 'demand', 'best', 'her.Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'real', 'surprise', 'very', 'good', 'restrained', 'characterization.A', 'fair', 'spectacle', 'see', 'recommend', 'film', 'general', 'audiences.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

I should like to point out that such comparisons are foolish.  Though all three movies deal with the subject of an English school teacher coming to Siam to educate the King's children, each has dealt with the topic on it own terms and merit.In this version Jodie Foster is Anna Leonowens, the head strong British colonialist who sees into the heart of a king and grows perhaps too fond of him for her own stalwart romantic sensibilities.FOX STUDIOS has done a beautiful job of capturing all the color, glamor and spectacle of Andy Tennant's beautiful film.  Colors on this DVD are robust, rich and vibrant.  Clarity is remarkable.  Though some pixelization and edge enhancement are present they never really intrude on the overall visual experience.  The 5.1 sound mix is incredibly lively and well balanced with a natural sounding fidelity that is most complimentary to the film.

517535,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CWLE,Reviewer,"[6, 9]","Based on the true story of Anna Leonowens, a British schoolteacher who traveled from her home in India to Siam in 1862 (nearly two years after the death of her husband) to instruct King Mongkut's children, ""Anna and the King,"" directed by Andy Tennant, is a lavish production that is visually striking but somewhat tedious in execution.  The story is interesting, and the cinematography is stunning, but it simply becomes too much of not enough; Tennant's method of storytelling is pretty straightforward, and there is artistic merit to this endeavor, but ultimately-- despite the colorful canvass-- the result is less than satisfying.  The redeeming factor of the film is the performance of the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat (King Mongkut), the star of many of John Woo's action films, who is afforded the opportunity here to demonstrate his versatility as a dramatic actor.  He successfully lends a depth and intelligence to his portrayal of Mongkut that is reinforced with a genuine regal countenance devoid of any pretentiousness.  Yun-Fat's King is a complex and secure individual who-- most importantly-- conveys a true sense of reality; he is, without question, the King of Siam.  Jodie Foster (Anna) on the other hand, though arguably one of the most talented, gifted actresses in the business, is woefully miscast as Anna.  Her British accent is credible, but becomes the focal point of her performance, which seems forced at best.  Granted, she succeeds in capturing the stoic quality of the character, but fails to attain that necessary emotional level that would have allowed the audience to identify with her.  There just doesn't seem to be anything about this ""Anna"" that would attract the King, either intellectually or emotionally, which, of course, mitigates the plot to a great extent.  While taking nothing away from Foster's myriad positive qualities, it makes you appreciate the facility with which Meryl Streep is able to so seamlessly embody the various characters she has created in her career.  Hindsight may be the forte of the unenlightened, still, in retrospect, Tennant (""Ever After,"" ""Fools Rush In"") may not have been the wisest choice to direct a film more suited to the talents of Ang Lee or Jane Campion, or to one with the sensibilities of a Bergman or Kurosawa.  Though he managed to create a pretty picture, he was unable to elicit the emotional depth required to sustain the audience's involvement with the story.  All of which goes to prove that one who whittles beautifully cannot necessarily handle a lathe.

Her son, Louis, and two Hindu servants accompany her in this new endeavor. As soon as Anna sets foot in Bangkok, the difference between cultures surges as a predominant element that will remain present throughout the story. Even though the start is rocky, with Anna being called ""Sir"" for misogynist reasons and not being given the house she was promised but accommodation in the palace instead, the king discovers quickly the value of this woman that acts very different from what he is used to. That is why he decides that instead of tutoring his oldest son, she will be in charge of teaching all of his children...all 58 of them!The movie evolves around three clear themes. First, the clash of cultures, which is enlightening and entertaining and as the movie evolves so does the acceptance and admiration each of the characters show for the positive points of the other's culture. Second, the relationship between Anna and the king, which starts as annoyance, moves to respect and continues developing from there. Third, the political atmosphere, which is characterized by attacks to Siamese people by Burmese armies, suspected to be supported by no other than the British Empire (the events unfold in 1862).Although the movie is rather long, the events unfold at a pace that keeps the viewer interested at all times. The music fits the mood of the action perfectly well, and in the proper scenes it is so uplifting that it steals the attention of the viewer. Jodie Foster delivers a well-rounded role, but in my opinion the performance of Chow Yun-Fat is at a higher level. Finally, the scenery and the palaces where the movie develops are absolutely amazing.Overall this is a highly enjoyable movie that will leave you thinking for a while about how every culture has its positive aspects and how, with a little patience, everyone can learn to appreciate this.",5,Simply a delightful story,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2032,"['losing', 'husband', 'jungle', 'India', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'journey', 'will', 'take', 'Siam', 'where', 'will', 'tutor', 'oldest', 'son', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'son', 'Louis', 'two', 'Hindu', 'servants', 'accompany', 'new', 'endeavor', 'As', 'soon', 'Anna', 'foot', 'Bangkok', 'difference', 'cultures', 'surges', 'predominant', 'element', 'will', 'remain', 'present', 'story', 'Even', 'start', 'rocky', 'Anna', 'being', 'called', 'Sir', 'misogynist', 'reasons', 'not', 'being', 'given', 'house', 'was', 'promised', 'accommodation', 'palace', 'instead', 'king', 'discovers', 'quickly', 'value', 'woman', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'used', 'why', 'instead', 'tutoring', 'oldest', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'charge', 'teaching', 'children', '58', 'movie', 'around', 'three', 'clear', 'themes', 'First', 'clash', 'cultures', 'enlightening', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'so', 'acceptance', 'admiration', 'characters', 'show', 'positive', 'points', 'other', 'culture', 'Second', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'king', 'annoyance', 'moves', 'respect', 'developing', 'there', 'Third', 'political', 'atmosphere', 'characterized', 'attacks', 'Siamese', 'people', 'Burmese', 'armies', 'suspected', 'be', 'supported', 'other', 'British', 'Empire', 'events', 'unfold', '1862', 'movie', 'rather', 'long', 'events', 'unfold', 'pace', 'viewer', 'interested', 'times', 'music', 'mood', 'action', 'perfectly', 'well', 'proper', 'scenes', 'so', 'uplifting', 'attention', 'viewer', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'well-rounded', 'role', 'opinion', 'performance', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'higher', 'level', 'Finally', 'scenery', 'palaces', 'where', 'movie', 'are', 'absolutely', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking', 'while', 'how', 'culture', 'positive', 'aspects', 'how', 'little', 'patience', 'everyone', 'can', 'learn', 'appreciate']",N/A
517541,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00003CWLE,Shashank Tripathi,"[12, 12]","This modern rendition of the 'The King and I' is not without its cinematic lacunae, but it's so captivating you'll gloss over most of them.It's 1862 and King Mongkut of Siam (Thailand) has hired a certain Mrs Anna Leonowens to be an English teacher to his 58 children. She stays there for five years and in 1870 publishes a book about her experiences, which predictably scandalizes British high society, and is considered a great betrayal by the Thai government and people.The film may be based on these diaries but sure it'd have been blasphemy to rely merely on barebone facts, so it liberally splices action, drama, romance, suspense, even fullfledged battles into the fray.We follow two broad arcs -- the platonic emotional connection that develops between the king and Anna, and the political backdrop against which this bond is set -- but the leitmotiv is one of change. Both our principals find themselves transformed beyond their own contexts by virtue of their acquaintance.Jodie Foster is clearly uncomfortable with her British accent as she mumbles her way through three-quarters of the movie, but it is probably her customary detachment in expressing emotion that befits Anna's charm in this film (if one could describe it thus) -- a certain air of arrogance, a misplaced conviction in her own superiority, the 'uncommon richness' of the British way of life, so on and so forth. The film doesn't patronize her character and the few crevices in her personality do come across as cultural idiosynchrasies that can now be looked upon as such, with the benefit of distance.Chow Yun Fat (a popular Hong Kong actor, you may know him from Crouching Tiger) is majestically imperious in his portrayal of the King caught between the throes of attraction and the cross he must bear as a conscientious ruler.Their romance is zestful but dignified, their chemistry palpable. His rueful admission of her as an equal and his tender submission to his own feelings of love towards her is masterful. There's even a waltz.One does wonder about his 26 concubines and 58 children though; they come across chiefly as garden props, we see them and they're there and that's all they do, part of the landscape. An unrelated sequence where a young daughter succumbs to ill health is quite plainly a tear-jerker thrown in for that sole purpose.Things then get dodgier on the political front. Anna's heroic rescue of Siam seems heavily contrived. No king with a couple brain cells or more would find himself mired in the sort of military faux pas that occurs here. Let's not spoil the suspense but there's a goofball insurrection that culminates in a positively cartoonish battle. Little surprise to me that Thai government chose to ban the film, not for groveling love of their monarchy but out of basic self-respect.These quibbles aside, the film is stunningly produced and well-worth seeing for the rest of us if only for the luxurious mantle in which it comes cloaked. The scenery is spectacular, with lush green mountain fields, grand palatial foyers draped in red silk, pillars etched in gold, even a long sweeping view of the royal steamboat on the river between the banks of a dense rain forest. The set and costume design are so sumptuous they'd have won Bertolucci's grudging admiration.Without doubt a heartily made epic and recommended with equal intensity if you're willing to go easy on the rigours of historical or cultural accuracy.",4,"DESPITE ITS QUIXOTIC VENEER, AN EXQUISITE ODE TO SIAM",1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,3432,"['modern', 'rendition', ""'The"", 'King', 'not', 'cinematic', 'lacunae', 'so', 'captivating', ""'ll"", 'gloss', 'most', 'them.It', '1862', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'Siam', 'Thailand', 'hired', 'certain', 'Mrs', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'be', 'English', 'teacher', '58', 'children', 'there', 'five', 'years', '1870', 'publishes', 'book', 'experiences', 'predictably', 'British', 'high', 'society', 'considered', 'great', 'betrayal', 'Thai', 'government', 'people.The', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'based', 'diaries', 'sure', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'blasphemy', 'rely', 'merely', 'barebone', 'facts', 'liberally', 'action', 'drama', 'romance', 'suspense', 'even', 'fullfledged', 'battles', 'fray.We', 'follow', 'two', 'broad', 'arcs', 'platonic', 'emotional', 'connection', 'king', 'Anna', 'political', 'backdrop', 'bond', 'set', 'leitmotiv', 'one', 'change', 'principals', 'find', 'transformed', 'own', 'contexts', 'virtue', 'acquaintance.Jodie', 'Foster', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'British', 'accent', 'way', 'three-quarters', 'movie', 'probably', 'customary', 'detachment', 'expressing', 'emotion', 'Anna', 'charm', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'describe', 'thus', 'certain', 'air', 'arrogance', 'misplaced', 'conviction', 'own', 'superiority', ""'uncommon"", 'richness', 'British', 'way', 'life', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'film', ""n't"", 'patronize', 'character', 'few', 'crevices', 'personality', 'do', 'come', 'cultural', 'idiosynchrasies', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'looked', 'such', 'benefit', 'distance.Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'popular', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'actor', 'may', 'know', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'majestically', 'imperious', 'portrayal', 'King', 'caught', 'throes', 'attraction', 'cross', 'must', 'bear', 'conscientious', 'ruler.Their', 'romance', 'zestful', 'dignified', 'chemistry', 'palpable', 'rueful', 'admission', 'equal', 'tender', 'submission', 'own', 'feelings', 'love', 'masterful', 'even', 'waltz.One', 'wonder', '26', 'concubines', '58', 'children', 'come', 'across', 'chiefly', 'garden', 'props', 'see', ""'re"", 'do', 'part', 'landscape', 'unrelated', 'sequence', 'where', 'young', 'daughter', 'succumbs', 'ill', 'health', 'quite', 'plainly', 'tear-jerker', 'thrown', 'sole', 'purpose.Things', 'then', 'get', 'dodgier', 'political', 'front', 'Anna', 'heroic', 'rescue', 'Siam', 'heavily', 'contrived', 'king', 'couple', 'brain', 'cells', 'more', 'would', 'find', 'mired', 'sort', 'military', 'faux', 'pas', 'here', 'Let', 'not', 'spoil', 'suspense', 'goofball', 'insurrection', 'positively', 'cartoonish', 'battle', 'Little', 'surprise', 'Thai', 'government', 'chose', 'ban', 'film', 'not', 'groveling', 'love', 'monarchy', 'basic', 'self-respect.These', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'film', 'stunningly', 'produced', 'well-worth', 'seeing', 'rest', 'only', 'luxurious', 'mantle', 'cloaked', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'lush', 'green', 'mountain', 'fields', 'grand', 'palatial', 'foyers', 'draped', 'red', 'silk', 'pillars', 'etched', 'gold', 'even', 'long', 'sweeping', 'view', 'royal', 'steamboat', 'river', 'banks', 'dense', 'rain', 'forest', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'are', 'so', 'sumptuous', ""'d"", 'have', 'won', 'Bertolucci', 'grudging', 'admiration.Without', 'doubt', 'heartily', 'made', 'epic', 'recommended', 'equal', 'intensity', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'easy', 'rigours', 'historical', 'cultural', 'accuracy']",N/A

Other than Anna's (Jodie Foster) Victorian dress, it's easy to  forget that this film takes place in the 1860's... it looks almost timeless  as they are in this robust, diverse and ancient culture. Chow Yun-Fat is  absolutely perfect in his role... proof that he doesn't need to weild a gun  or perform martial arts to be taken seriously.There are moments that are  tragic, tender and bittersweet as the Thai kingdom of King Mongkut faces an  evolution of sorts as it becomes clear that they can no longer shut out the  world.In a world where women are servants and accessories and the King  has many wives, Anna challenges the King's ideas of the strength of a  woman's mind and her resolve. While he has many wives, it is evident that  it is Anna that has stolen his heart. Standing up for principals she  believes in is first met with further demands and decrees from the King,  but is soon followed with concession and kindness. To see the British and  Thai cultures intertwine and react to one another is very interesting and  the contrast of how the King and Anna interact versus the snobbish  aristocracy.The Western world sees the King as just a figure-head of a  primitive culture, but Anna yields respect for him as she would to her own  Queen Victoria, yet does not sacrifice her ideals, beliefs or dignity in  the process.The backdrops, scenery, costumes, etc. are all  breath-takingly beautiful and performances by those in lesser roles are  also believable and stunning.

True, Andy Tennant &quot;exploited&quot; history as much as Anna Leonowens;  yet as Tennant pierces the mist of Bangkok to reveal a revolutionary  monarch, the plot matters little.  It's all about characters in this lavish  drama, rich with colors and detailed characterization.  Despite critics's  doubts of Foster's accent and occasional chafe in the role, the new mother  is radiant in the role of Anna.  Foster's techniques truly add a shade of  credibility to the story--however ficticious it may be. Chow Yun-Fat, on  the other hand, is hailed as the only thing brilliant about this movie by  cynics and zealots alike. This god of actors, summons forth such compassion  and power behind his subtlety: a smile, a wink, a hand motion--even w/ out  his trademark gun and cigar, Chow still dominates the screen with his  towering presence.  This presence is so tender and touching that the entire  cast rallies around his performance: from passionate Bai Ling (as Tuptim)to  mischevious Melissa Campbell (as young princess). When I titled this review  &quot;a visual regale&quot;, I meant to emphasize that the real recognition  this movie received during the awards season was indeed its dazzling  wardrobe.  Against the backdrop of the magnificent replica palace of King  Mongkut built in Malaysia, the elaborate courtesian silk, victorian satin  depicts a glamorous view of Asia struggling to progress.

517554,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00003CWLE,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[26, 32]",This is a re-working of the Hollywood film the King and I without  musical numbers. The King and I is banned in Thailand and is bitterly hated. The reason is that the portrayal by Yul Brunner of the king showed him to be an excitable twit. In reality the king in question was a former Monk who was asked to take over the royal throne in difficult circumstances. Rather than being a twit the King was a man of deep learning. This was illustrated by the fact that he originated the Thai alphabet. The memoirs on which the King and I are based are probably fictitious and have little relation to the truth. They were taken somewhat literally at the time of their publication because of the prejudice in Britain against foreign non Caucasian cultures. No one checked to see there accuracy and it would seem that Anna had only a passing commitment to the truth.This film version has tried to be fairer to Thailand and has made the King a more attractive and dignified figure. Jodie Foster is a great actress and she is impressive in the role. Although the script was made fairer to the Thai characters permission was refused for filming on location. The filming has been done on recreations of the Royal Palace and are impressive.The main problem with the film is the rather artificial ending where the Foster character is able to save Thailand from invasion by quick thinking and the use of modern technology. The end looks contrived and is unconvincing.Despite that it is a pleasant if unsubstantial film. The enjoyment of it probably increases if one doesn't know about Thai history as the contrast with the reality can jar.,2,Jodie Foster is always good,975801600,"12 3, 2000",2000,1622,"['re-working', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'King', 'musical', 'numbers', 'King', 'banned', 'Thailand', 'bitterly', 'hated', 'reason', 'portrayal', 'Yul', 'Brunner', 'king', 'showed', 'be', 'excitable', 'twit', 'reality', 'king', 'question', 'was', 'former', 'Monk', 'who', 'was', 'asked', 'take', 'over', 'royal', 'throne', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'Rather', 'being', 'twit', 'King', 'was', 'man', 'deep', 'learning', 'was', 'illustrated', 'fact', 'originated', 'Thai', 'alphabet', 'memoirs', 'King', 'are', 'based', 'are', 'probably', 'fictitious', 'have', 'little', 'relation', 'truth', 'were', 'taken', 'somewhat', 'literally', 'time', 'publication', 'prejudice', 'Britain', 'foreign', 'non', 'Caucasian', 'cultures', 'one', 'checked', 'see', 'there', 'accuracy', 'would', 'seem', 'Anna', 'had', 'only', 'passing', 'commitment', 'truth.This', 'film', 'version', 'tried', 'be', 'fairer', 'Thailand', 'made', 'King', 'more', 'attractive', 'dignified', 'figure', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'great', 'actress', 'impressive', 'role', 'script', 'was', 'made', 'fairer', 'Thai', 'characters', 'permission', 'was', 'refused', 'filming', 'location', 'filming', 'been', 'done', 'recreations', 'Royal', 'Palace', 'are', 'impressive.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'rather', 'artificial', 'ending', 'where', 'Foster', 'character', 'able', 'save', 'Thailand', 'invasion', 'quick', 'thinking', 'use', 'modern', 'technology', 'end', 'contrived', 'unconvincing.Despite', 'pleasant', 'unsubstantial', 'film', 'enjoyment', 'probably', 'one', ""n't"", 'know', 'Thai', 'history', 'contrast', 'reality', 'can', 'jar']",N/A

517556,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B00003CWLE,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 3]","The surplus of pomp in ""Anna and the King"" cannot hide its scarcity of passion. The fourth account of forbidden love between a widowed English governess and Asian royalty boasts impressive authenticity, but ""Ever After"" director Andy Tennant and co-scripters Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes neglect the heart of the story. When the climactic showdown between the hero and villain tops the best scene between the heroine and the hero, the filmmakers should have known they had emphasized the wrong elements. Credibly cast as they are, Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat come up short on chemistry because their roles allow them little intimacy. Ostensibly, ""Anna and the King"" emerges as an above-average historical costumer undercut by its dearth of romance.""Anna and the King"" takes place in Siam during the 1860s. Anna arrives by ship in Bangkok with her son, Louis (Tom Felton) and two Indian servants to tutor the King's son in the 'scientific' ways of the West. Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster of ""Contact"") finds herself immediately at odds with the monarch and the savage customs of Siam. She demands that he honors his word and allows her to live outside the walls of his palace, but he insists that she live within them. Eventually, in a contest of wills and wits, they grow to tolerate each other and he bestows on her an elegant house in the country. Later, instead of tutoring only his son, King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat of ""The Killer"") orders her to teach all 58 of his children! The relationship between King Mongkut and the British schoolmarm Anna Leonowens lacks theatrics. Tennant and his scenarists must take the blame for the shortage of emotional sparks. The leads are left alone together only twice in this two-hour plus epic. First, they quarrel over a tragic court verdict about two illicit lovers not entirely unlike themselves. Second, they hover on the threshold of intimacy during a night encounter on the beach, but propriety compels them to withdraw to their respective corners. Of course, miscegenation and politics create an impasse between them, but these characters seem doomed from the start in spite of their mutual admiration.Tennant excels at showing what keeps the King and Anna apart from each other. She worships the memory of her dead war hero husband, while he reigns over a volatile frontier kingdom troubled from within and without, sharing his passion and energy with his 23 wives and 42 concubines. Anna never exasperates the King as she did in the first two versions. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat quarrel, but they never tear each other's clothes off for hot, sweaty sex.Finally, in the name of political correctness, an Asian actor portrays an Asian ruler. Chow Yun-Fat refuses to imitate his prestigious predecessors in his interpretation of the King. He wears the part well and delivers a performance that may be too subtle for his own good. Moreover, he shuns Yul Brynner's bombastic strut in director Walter Lang's 1956 musical and seems too restrained. Nevertheless, Yun-Fat's King is a sagacious sire. Although he is the absolute monarch, he knows that he can only bend traditions, not break them.The straight-forward, Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes screenplay resembles an anthology of Hollywood classics, among them: ""King Solomon's Mines,"" ""The Robe,"" ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,"" ""Doctor Zhivago,"" and ""Out of Africa."" Asian action star Chow Yun-Fat maintains an authoritative presence throughout the action. Smoking a Clint Eastwood cheroot, the King stages an audacious stand-off against an enemy army, but Anna backs up his bluff and saves his neck.The filmmakers err in putting the background in the foreground and vice-versa. Too many peripheral issues displace the love story. ""Anna and the King"" concerns what you cannot have in life. Tennant fails to milk the plot for its melodrama.""Anna and the King"" won't erase the indelible impression that the 1956 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner made on the minds of many moviegoers. Tennant's spin on this popular yarn about love lost looks spectacular and evokes a moment or two of passion, but he has emphasized politics over passion.Altogether, despite its sturdy cast, its breathtaking widescreen photography and its scenic Malaysian grandeur, ""Anna and the King"" amounts to an occasionally touching but tight-lipped tearjerker.",2,"A Scarcity of Passion Plagues ""Anna and the King"" . . .",1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,4368,"['surplus', 'pomp', 'Anna', 'King', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'scarcity', 'passion', 'fourth', 'account', 'forbidden', 'love', 'widowed', 'English', 'governess', 'Asian', 'royalty', 'boasts', 'impressive', 'authenticity', 'Ever', 'director', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'co-scripters', 'Steve', 'Meerson', 'Peter', 'Krikes', 'neglect', 'heart', 'story', 'When', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'hero', 'villain', 'tops', 'best', 'scene', 'heroine', 'hero', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'had', 'emphasized', 'wrong', 'elements', 'Credibly', 'cast', 'are', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'chemistry', 'roles', 'allow', 'little', 'intimacy', 'Ostensibly', 'Anna', 'King', 'above-average', 'historical', 'costumer', 'undercut', 'dearth', 'romance', 'Anna', 'King', 'place', 'Siam', '1860s', 'Anna', 'ship', 'Bangkok', 'son', 'Louis', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'two', 'Indian', 'servants', 'tutor', 'King', 'son', ""'scientific"", 'ways', 'West', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Contact', 'immediately', 'odds', 'monarch', 'savage', 'customs', 'Siam', 'word', 'live', 'walls', 'palace', 'live', 'Eventually', 'contest', 'wills', 'wits', 'grow', 'tolerate', 'other', 'elegant', 'house', 'country', 'Later', 'instead', 'tutoring', 'only', 'son', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'Killer', 'orders', 'teach', '58', 'children', 'relationship', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'British', 'schoolmarm', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'theatrics', 'Tennant', 'scenarists', 'must', 'take', 'blame', 'shortage', 'emotional', 'sparks', 'leads', 'are', 'left', 'alone', 'together', 'only', 'twice', 'two-hour', 'epic', 'First', 'quarrel', 'tragic', 'court', 'verdict', 'two', 'illicit', 'lovers', 'not', 'entirely', 'Second', 'hover', 'threshold', 'intimacy', 'night', 'encounter', 'beach', 'propriety', 'compels', 'withdraw', 'respective', 'corners', 'course', 'miscegenation', 'politics', 'create', 'impasse', 'characters', 'seem', 'doomed', 'start', 'spite', 'mutual', 'admiration.Tennant', 'excels', 'showing', 'what', 'King', 'Anna', 'apart', 'other', 'memory', 'dead', 'war', 'hero', 'husband', 'volatile', 'frontier', 'kingdom', 'troubled', 'sharing', 'passion', 'energy', '23', 'wives', '42', 'concubines', 'Anna', 'never', 'King', 'did', 'first', 'two', 'versions', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'quarrel', 'never', 'tear', 'other', 'clothes', 'hot', 'sweaty', 'sex.Finally', 'name', 'political', 'correctness', 'Asian', 'actor', 'Asian', 'ruler', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'refuses', 'imitate', 'prestigious', 'predecessors', 'interpretation', 'King', 'part', 'well', 'delivers', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'subtle', 'own', 'good', 'Moreover', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'bombastic', 'strut', 'director', 'Walter', 'Lang', '1956', 'musical', 'too', 'restrained', 'Nevertheless', 'Yun-Fat', 'King', 'sagacious', 'sire', 'absolute', 'monarch', 'can', 'only', 'bend', 'traditions', 'not', 'break', 'them.The', 'straight-forward', 'Steve', 'Meerson', 'Peter', 'Krikes', 'screenplay', 'anthology', 'Hollywood', 'classics', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'Robe', 'Inn', 'Sixth', 'Happiness', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Out', 'Africa', 'Asian', 'action', 'star', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'authoritative', 'presence', 'action', 'Smoking', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'cheroot', 'King', 'audacious', 'stand-off', 'enemy', 'army', 'Anna', 'up', 'bluff', 'neck.The', 'filmmakers', 'err', 'putting', 'background', 'foreground', 'vice-versa', 'Too', 'many', 'peripheral', 'issues', 'displace', 'love', 'story', 'Anna', 'King', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'life', 'Tennant', 'milk', 'plot', 'melodrama', 'Anna', 'King', 'wo', ""n't"", 'erase', 'indelible', 'impression', '1956', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'made', 'minds', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'Tennant', 'spin', 'popular', 'yarn', 'love', 'lost', 'looks', 'spectacular', 'moment', 'two', 'passion', 'emphasized', 'politics', 'passion.Altogether', 'sturdy', 'cast', 'breathtaking', 'widescreen', 'photography', 'scenic', 'Malaysian', 'grandeur', 'Anna', 'King', 'amounts', 'occasionally', 'touching', 'tight-lipped', 'tearjerker']",N/A
