273804,AWA88F5TOX8VL,6301945298,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[2, 3]","As a fan of Robert Vaughan and Edgar Allen Poe since childhood, when I saw this new release and being unfamiliar with it (and not being able to find any info on IMDB at that time), I jumped on this one immediately. While not exactly experiencing 'buyers remorse', I have to admit I wasn't enthralled, though most fans of 80's slasher and horror will definitely see merits in this film lost on this reviewer, so take these statements with that in mind. I myself am not a big fan of 80's horror (possibly a flaw of mine).Robert Vaughn is excellent and creepy as the headmaster and professor of this all girls school for delinquents, and keeps things moving along single-handedly. The odd thing here is that this film is almost a women-in-prison flick in nature, with all the accompanying clich&eacute;s of the genre, (you know - lots of showers and a catfight or two) but with only a modicum of the required nudity inherent in that style of flick. Which is too bad, really, as it would have raised the bar considerably, especially when you consider that Ginger Lynn Allen (yes, that Ginger Lynn, the princess of early-mid 80's porno fame) is one of the bad girls in attendance. Though you will see some of the other lasses in various states of undress, you won't see her undraped anywhere... bummer.The kill scenes are decent yet routine for 80's horror films, the girls disappear when they are unusually disobedient, but aren't buried alive, per se; they're walled in within the dark past secrets of the building's basement. No real scares here; we can see who the perpetrator of the crimes is half-way through the film, but the finale is decent nonetheless. Donald Pleasance is fine as the oddball teacher of dubious qualifications who's been at the facility longer than anyone. Like I said, these films are not hits with me, but are for a vast majority of horror fans, so use your own discretion after reading my review, and don't fault me if you don't agree - I prefaced my review accordingly.A 3 star effort for my tastes, but probably 4 stars for most viewers. You decide. For Vaughan fans, it's a no-brainer.",3,'Buried Alive' in clich&eacute;s...,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,2113,"['fan', 'Robert', 'Vaughan', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'childhood', 'when', 'saw', 'new', 'release', 'being', 'unfamiliar', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'info', 'IMDB', 'time', 'jumped', 'one', 'immediately', 'not', 'exactly', 'experiencing', ""'buyers"", 'remorse', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'enthralled', 'most', 'fans', '80', 'slasher', 'horror', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'merits', 'film', 'lost', 'reviewer', 'so', 'take', 'statements', 'mind', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', '80', 'horror', 'possibly', 'flaw', 'mine', '.Robert', 'Vaughn', 'excellent', 'creepy', 'headmaster', 'professor', 'girls', 'school', 'delinquents', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'single-handedly', 'odd', 'thing', 'here', 'film', 'almost', 'women-in-prison', 'flick', 'nature', 'accompanying', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'genre', 'know', 'lots', 'showers', 'catfight', 'two', 'only', 'modicum', 'required', 'nudity', 'inherent', 'style', 'flick', 'Which', 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'raised', 'bar', 'considerably', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'Ginger', 'Lynn', 'Allen', 'yes', 'Ginger', 'Lynn', 'princess', 'early-mid', '80', 'porno', 'fame', 'one', 'bad', 'girls', 'attendance', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'lasses', 'various', 'states', 'undress', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'undraped', 'anywhere', 'bummer.The', 'kill', 'scenes', 'are', 'decent', 'yet', 'routine', '80', 'horror', 'films', 'girls', 'disappear', 'when', 'are', 'unusually', 'disobedient', 'are', ""n't"", 'buried', 'alive', 'se', ""'re"", 'walled', 'dark', 'past', 'secrets', 'building', 'basement', 'real', 'scares', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'who', 'perpetrator', 'crimes', 'half-way', 'film', 'finale', 'decent', 'nonetheless', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'fine', 'oddball', 'teacher', 'dubious', 'qualifications', 'who', 'been', 'facility', 'longer', 'anyone', 'said', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'hits', 'are', 'vast', 'majority', 'horror', 'fans', 'so', 'use', 'own', 'discretion', 'reading', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'prefaced', 'review', 'accordingly.A', '3', 'star', 'effort', 'tastes', 'probably', '4', 'stars', 'most', 'viewers', 'decide', 'Vaughan', 'fans', 'no-brainer']",Buried Alive VHS

The teleplay by Mark Patrick Carducci based on a story by David A. Davies is thin, reading more like an anthology episode, with Jennifer Jason Leigh and her lover William Atherton planning the murder of Leigh's husband Tim Matheson. Darabont establishes the gothic terror of the title predicament, even if the act of revenge fails to duplicate the same level of dread.The narrative has convenient plot contrivances - the haste of the burial bypassing the  embalming procedure and cheap choise of coffin, rain allowing for a &quot;resurrection&quot; from a shallow grave, and especially the climactic house reconstruction - though Matheson's dog disliking JJL is an acceptable touch. The idea of JJL and Atherton fighting amongst themselves is meant to present them as disloyal characters though thankfully they have the sense to see it also weakens their position against a common foe.JJL's femme fatale may have no subtlety - she has a bad dye job and is a chain smoker - but at least she has some honest moments. Matheson's earnestness cannot bring him tube empathy, and his Frankenstein-like coffin-wear scores a titter. And although Atherton is hardly the romantic type, he at least can deliver funny lines in &quot;It never woulda worked darlin'.
