1669917,AJ8CBMFSPRKQU,B00F031WB8,&#60;/&#62;&#60;,"[19, 33]","This new documentary was made by Experience Hendrix, LLC because the 1973 film is horrible! It was nice to see some of the people in that 1973 film in this new one like Jimi's old squeeze Fayne Piedgeon (or however you spell her name).It also showed some classic interviews with Al Hendrix, I wish it showed more and more of the new interview with Billy Cox! The Billy Cox interview would have made a great DVD extra.Just for the Extra's alone makes this a purchase. Why has it taken all these years to finally see the July 1970 Randalls Island gig?One thing you'll notice if you're any kind of Jimi fan is that Leon is absent from this DVD completely! What an insult and the continued bitterness by Jamie goes on! Leon has a lot to say and would made an excellent edition to the DVD, thanks janie for nothing!Leo prob wasn't allowed to be in the Doc! anything that comes from Janie wont have anything to do with Leon! Sad!Also....the ""extras"", I can see it now, next year the full DVD for NY Randalls Island will be out and more newly discovered Miami Pop film will make a new DVD. Thats how Experience Hendrix does things, string you along and sucker you out of every dollar they can!One example is on the DVD extra of Randall's Island ""Foxy Lady"" is absent, yet it is shown in the 1970 film ""Free"" also known as ""The day the music died"". So there is footage of that, plus all the multiple camera angels of the footage, there is no way that was all that was available.2014 look for the new DVD on it to make another buck.",5,Best Jimi documentary and great EXTRA's in DVD,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1523,"['new', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'Experience', 'Hendrix', 'LLC', '1973', 'film', 'horrible', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'people', '1973', 'film', 'new', 'one', 'Jimi', 'old', 'squeeze', 'Fayne', 'Piedgeon', 'however', 'spell', 'name', '.It', 'also', 'showed', 'classic', 'interviews', 'Al', 'Hendrix', 'wish', 'showed', 'more', 'more', 'new', 'interview', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'interview', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'DVD', 'extra.Just', 'Extra', 'alone', 'purchase', 'Why', 'taken', 'years', 'finally', 'see', 'July', '1970', 'Randalls', 'Island', 'gig', 'One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', ""'re"", 'kind', 'Jimi', 'fan', 'Leon', 'absent', 'DVD', 'completely', 'What', 'insult', 'continued', 'bitterness', 'Jamie', 'Leon', 'lot', 'say', 'would', 'made', 'excellent', 'edition', 'DVD', 'thanks', 'janie', 'nothing', 'Leo', 'prob', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'be', 'Doc', 'anything', 'Janie', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Leon', 'Sad', 'Also', 'extras', 'can', 'see', 'now', 'next', 'year', 'full', 'DVD', 'NY', 'Randalls', 'Island', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'more', 'newly', 'discovered', 'Miami', 'Pop', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'new', 'DVD', 'Thats', 'how', 'Experience', 'Hendrix', 'things', 'string', 'sucker', 'dollar', 'can', 'One', 'example', 'DVD', 'extra', 'Randall', 'Island', 'Foxy', 'Lady', 'absent', 'shown', '1970', 'film', 'Free', 'also', 'known', 'day', 'music', 'died', 'footage', 'multiple', 'camera', 'angels', 'footage', 'way', 'was', 'was', 'available.2014', 'look', 'new', 'DVD', 'make', 'buck']",N/A

1669920,A13C072YCYHT62,B00F031WB8,B. Gordon,"[79, 88]","My review of Hear My Train A CominFirst off, the showing I went to happened to also be attended by the director Bob Smeaton! Kind of cool! We got to ask him questions about the doc after it was over. Nice guy and very frank about the challenges of editing a doc like this one with so many voices and pieces of footage to choose from and showcase.Overall, this is a fine job. Keep in mind that for us ""Jimi heads"" we've seen the vast majority of the footage that's out there in one form or another. The two or three biggest ""new Jimi visuals"" included in the doc are Miami (obviously) and we get nearly a complete performance of Foxy Lady. We also get snippets of Tax Free and plenty of footage of the Miami crowd. But given this is a documentary, you're going to have to wait for the ""Extras"" in order to really enjoy all of the new footage, including Isle of Fehrman, which is briefly shown in the doc when Jimi performs Spanish Castle Magic (with the audience tape the family released as the audio for the cut). We also get, for what was for me anyways, some previously unseen footage of Jimi performing in a full blue velvet get-up. I forget which concert this was taken from.The majority of the people interviewed in the doc have since passed on. Noel, Mitch, Chas, Paul Caruso, Buddy Miles, and a few more. Surprise, Faye Pridgeon is still around, so is Billy Cox (thank goodness), Linda Keith, but we still don't get any updated interview with Eric Barrett, unfortunately. Bob Smeaton mentioned that Eric didn't like how he was quoted in the original Jimi Hendrix biopic back in '73 and hence has never allowed himself to be interviewed on camera about Jimi since. Also, Leon chose not to be interviewed for this doc.Linda Keith summed up Jimi's two passions in his life: music and women! Won't debate it.I will mention, however, that towards the conclusion of the doc there is some beautiful guitar playing. And guess what it is? It's from One Rainy Wish and I guess Eddie Kramer or whomever it was made available Jimi's guitar from this gorgeous composition without the drums or any other instruments. When you hear it, it's like heaven! Just exquisite. I'd love to hear One Rainy Wish in its entirety without drums or bass. Just Jimi's soulful strumming. Maybe one day the family will release some additional outtakes of Axis and include Jimi's guitar parts from this tune without the added bass and drums.The doc runs close to two hours. The rest of the footage we've seen before. Bob relies heavily on the Dick Cavett interview. A good dose of Berkeley, Monterey, but barely any Newport! Some of the most gorgeous, exquisite blues playing EVER caught of Jimi performing live and Bob doesn't use ANY OF IT! (there's a second or two from the stage but it doesn't count in my book) Sacrilegious! Maybe the family is still waiting to release this stuff on something else. Or maybe it's on the Extras. I don't know. But it's footage that captures what for me is what makes Jimi the greatest R&B; electric guitarist of all time. Whenever someone asks me, I just say, go watch Newport!It would have been super if Bob had bothered to get permission to include more footage from Maui. We get In From The Storm at the conclusion of the doc but man, we know there's much more, including Dolly Dagger and the instrumental that follows it. This is footage crying to be seen by the public at large, in particular, to show the more intricate and softer side of Jimi's playing.Also, the doc fibs when it's mentioned why Jimi got out of the Army. We know now that it wasn't a ""broken ankle"" that got Jimi his discharge. But that's minor. Also, there's zero mention of LSD, pot, drugs, etc....Bob told us that because there was no recorded interviews with Jimi about his taking any drugs he decided not to include any footage with other people who knew Jimi that mentioned his drug use. Fair enough. But I think LSD is an important drug (PERIOD) and LSD was an influence on Jimi when it came to some of his greatest compositions, including 1983. I seem to recall that there is a recorded interview with Jimi where he does discuss LSD (I could be mistaken).All in all, this is a very good production and we have to keep in mind that there are always new Jimi fans to initiate and many should find this doc a real delight.I can't WAIT to see the extras!!! This is what all Jimi heads are salivating the most about. More Miami, more Isle of Fehrman, more New York '70, yeah!",4,"Overall, a good production",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,4464,"['review', 'Hear', 'My', 'Train', 'A', 'CominFirst', 'showing', 'went', 'happened', 'also', 'be', 'attended', 'director', 'Bob', 'Smeaton', 'Kind', 'cool', 'got', 'ask', 'questions', 'doc', 'was', 'over', 'Nice', 'guy', 'very', 'frank', 'challenges', 'editing', 'doc', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'voices', 'pieces', 'footage', 'choose', 'showcase.Overall', 'fine', 'job', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Jimi', 'heads', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'vast', 'majority', 'footage', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'form', 'two', 'three', 'biggest', 'new', 'Jimi', 'visuals', 'included', 'doc', 'are', 'Miami', 'obviously', 'get', 'nearly', 'complete', 'performance', 'Foxy', 'Lady', 'also', 'get', 'snippets', 'Tax', 'Free', 'plenty', 'footage', 'Miami', 'crowd', 'given', 'documentary', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'wait', 'Extras', 'order', 'really', 'enjoy', 'new', 'footage', 'including', 'Isle', 'Fehrman', 'briefly', 'shown', 'doc', 'when', 'Jimi', 'Spanish', 'Castle', 'Magic', 'audience', 'tape', 'family', 'released', 'audio', 'cut', 'also', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'previously', 'unseen', 'footage', 'Jimi', 'performing', 'full', 'blue', 'velvet', 'get-up', 'forget', 'concert', 'was', 'taken', 'from.The', 'majority', 'people', 'interviewed', 'doc', 'have', 'passed', 'Noel', 'Mitch', 'Chas', 'Paul', 'Caruso', 'Buddy', 'Miles', 'few', 'more', 'Surprise', 'Faye', 'Pridgeon', 'still', 'around', 'so', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Linda', 'Keith', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'updated', 'interview', 'Eric', 'Barrett', 'unfortunately', 'Bob', 'Smeaton', 'mentioned', 'Eric', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'was', 'quoted', 'original', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'biopic', 'back', ""'73"", 'hence', 'never', 'allowed', 'be', 'interviewed', 'camera', 'Jimi', 'Also', 'Leon', 'chose', 'not', 'be', 'interviewed', 'doc.Linda', 'Keith', 'summed', 'up', 'Jimi', 'two', 'passions', 'life', 'music', 'women', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'debate', 'it.I', 'will', 'mention', 'however', 'conclusion', 'doc', 'beautiful', 'guitar', 'playing', 'guess', 'what', 'One', 'Rainy', 'Wish', 'guess', 'Eddie', 'Kramer', 'whomever', 'was', 'made', 'available', 'Jimi', 'guitar', 'gorgeous', 'composition', 'drums', 'other', 'instruments', 'When', 'hear', 'heaven', 'Just', 'exquisite', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'One', 'Rainy', 'Wish', 'entirety', 'drums', 'bass', 'Just', 'Jimi', 'soulful', 'strumming', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'family', 'will', 'release', 'additional', 'outtakes', 'Axis', 'include', 'Jimi', 'guitar', 'parts', 'tune', 'added', 'bass', 'drums.The', 'doc', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'rest', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Bob', 'heavily', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'interview', 'good', 'dose', 'Berkeley', 'Monterey', 'barely', 'Newport', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'exquisite', 'blues', 'playing', 'EVER', 'caught', 'Jimi', 'performing', 'live', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'use', 'ANY', 'IT', 'second', 'two', 'stage', ""n't"", 'count', 'book', 'Sacrilegious', 'Maybe', 'family', 'still', 'waiting', 'release', 'stuff', 'something', 'else', 'Extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'footage', 'what', 'what', 'Jimi', 'greatest', 'R', 'B', 'electric', 'guitarist', 'time', 'Whenever', 'someone', 'just', 'say', 'go', 'watch', 'Newport', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'super', 'Bob', 'had', 'bothered', 'get', 'permission', 'include', 'more', 'footage', 'Maui', 'get', 'From', 'Storm', 'conclusion', 'doc', 'man', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'including', 'Dolly', 'Dagger', 'instrumental', 'footage', 'crying', 'be', 'seen', 'public', 'large', 'particular', 'show', 'more', 'intricate', 'softer', 'side', 'Jimi', 'playing.Also', 'doc', 'fibs', 'when', 'mentioned', 'why', 'Jimi', 'got', 'Army', 'know', 'now', 'was', ""n't"", 'broken', 'ankle', 'got', 'Jimi', 'discharge', 'minor', 'Also', 'zero', 'mention', 'LSD', 'pot', 'drugs', 'etc', '.Bob', 'told', 'was', 'recorded', 'interviews', 'Jimi', 'taking', 'drugs', 'decided', 'not', 'include', 'footage', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Jimi', 'mentioned', 'drug', 'use', 'Fair', 'enough', 'think', 'LSD', 'important', 'drug', 'PERIOD', 'LSD', 'was', 'influence', 'Jimi', 'when', 'came', 'greatest', 'compositions', 'including', '1983', 'seem', 'recall', 'recorded', 'interview', 'Jimi', 'where', 'discuss', 'LSD', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken', '.All', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'always', 'new', 'Jimi', 'fans', 'initiate', 'many', 'should', 'find', 'doc', 'real', 'delight.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'WAIT', 'see', 'extras', 'what', 'Jimi', 'heads', 'are', 'salivating', 'most', 'about', 'More', 'Miami', 'more', 'Isle', 'Fehrman', 'more', 'New', 'York', ""'70"", 'yeah']",N/A
1669921,AFHEGYXMK6HCL,B00F031WB8,"Bring_back_the_60s ""If you can remember the 6...","[1, 2]","Hear My Train A Comin' is another documentary about Jimi Hendrix. Since 1973 there has been numerous documentaries produced about Jimi.The first produced in the early 1970s was made shortly after Jimi's passing. It had interviews with Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and other people close to Jimi. It is still a great document of the life of Jimi Hendrix and is also available on DVD.The last decade has seen more documentaries of Jimi produced including one that was issued with the West Coast Seattle Boy Box Set.This new documentary includes some footage from all the previous films plus some new concert footage such as Miami Pop and some snippets that fans have identified as the concert Jimi played at Madison Square Garden from 1969 and some snippets of Jimi's concert at the Hollywood Bowl.The film itself has a lot of interview footage of an ageing Fayne Pridgeon and the woman who discovered Jimi Linda Keith.I feel this is a very well produced story about Jimi but it does not include several important people who were heavily involved in Jimi's life such as Kathy Ethingham and even his brother Leon who is never mentioned.Chas Chandler is mentioned but does not get the recognition he deserved as the major producer for Jimi's 3 studio albums.Although there are some flaws this is an entertaining film and well worth getting.The extras are what most Hendrix fans want this DVD for. The 4 songs from Miami 1968 have been highly anticipated and are well worth the wait. The NewYork Pop 1970 footage is poor visually but a great performance.Jimi's final concert from Germany is a bit of a let down despite being very historic and the final testament of Jimi's legacy on film. The picture is poor as is the sound and I find it not easy to watch due to the poor sound. However this is the last chance we have of seeing Jimi Live therefore it is essential to view at least once.Overall this is a good document of Jimi Hendrix that hopefully will enable the bonus Miami footage issued in full in the near future.",4,Hear My Train A Comin' (DVD),1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,2016,"['Hear', 'My', 'Train', 'A', 'Comin', 'documentary', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', '1973', 'been', 'numerous', 'documentaries', 'produced', 'Jimi.The', 'first', 'produced', 'early', '1970s', 'was', 'made', 'shortly', 'Jimi', 'passing', 'had', 'interviews', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'other', 'people', 'close', 'Jimi', 'still', 'great', 'document', 'life', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'also', 'available', 'DVD.The', 'last', 'decade', 'seen', 'more', 'documentaries', 'Jimi', 'produced', 'including', 'one', 'was', 'issued', 'West', 'Coast', 'Seattle', 'Boy', 'Box', 'Set.This', 'new', 'documentary', 'footage', 'previous', 'films', 'new', 'concert', 'footage', 'such', 'Miami', 'Pop', 'snippets', 'fans', 'have', 'identified', 'concert', 'Jimi', 'played', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', '1969', 'snippets', 'Jimi', 'concert', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl.The', 'film', 'lot', 'interview', 'footage', 'ageing', 'Fayne', 'Pridgeon', 'woman', 'who', 'discovered', 'Jimi', 'Linda', 'Keith.I', 'feel', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'story', 'Jimi', 'not', 'include', 'several', 'important', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'heavily', 'involved', 'Jimi', 'life', 'such', 'Kathy', 'Ethingham', 'even', 'brother', 'Leon', 'who', 'never', 'mentioned.Chas', 'Chandler', 'mentioned', 'not', 'get', 'recognition', 'deserved', 'major', 'producer', 'Jimi', '3', 'studio', 'are', 'flaws', 'entertaining', 'film', 'well', 'getting.The', 'extras', 'are', 'what', 'most', 'Hendrix', 'fans', 'want', 'DVD', '4', 'songs', 'Miami', '1968', 'have', 'been', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'are', 'well', 'wait', 'NewYork', 'Pop', '1970', 'footage', 'poor', 'visually', 'great', 'performance.Jimi', 'final', 'concert', 'Germany', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'being', 'very', 'historic', 'final', 'testament', 'Jimi', 'legacy', 'film', 'picture', 'poor', 'sound', 'find', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'due', 'poor', 'sound', 'However', 'last', 'chance', 'have', 'seeing', 'Jimi', 'Live', 'essential', 'view', 'least', 'once.Overall', 'good', 'document', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'hopefully', 'will', 'enable', 'bonus', 'Miami', 'footage', 'issued', 'full', 'near', 'future']",N/A
1669922,A2FUZI0M05GUPZ,B00F031WB8,Charles Platt,"[2, 3]","This is probably as good as it will ever get, as a documentary on Hendrix. Some especially valuable moments include Eddie Kramer playing a master tape of Little Wing and demonstrating just how good the vocal is when he fades down all the other tracks, and pretty much all the comments by Chas Chandler and Linda Keith. They alone are worth the price of admission. Her commentary, and the clips from a couple other female friends, provide some perspective that was sadly missing from the otherwise comprehensive book, &#34;setting the record straight.&#34;But, like any documentary intended for a mass audience, unfortunately it assumes we are idiots. For instance, we have to sit through a little lecture on the flexibility provided by multi-track recording.And, the selection of interviewees spreads the net much more widely than was necessary or desirable. What the hell is Dweezil Zappa doing here, pontificating in a way that underlines the obvious while looking as if he is on the edge of a psycho meltdown? As for Rolling Stone magazine journalist David Fricke, he has no business being here at all, yet is allowed more time than anyone else, in which to &#34;sum it all up&#34; in the half-baked, patronizing, pseudo-intellectual style so characteristic of that magazine. If he had been omitted, there would have been more time for the people who really matter, such as Mitch Mitchell, who is allowed far less than he deserved. Presumably Fricke was considered necessary to explain Hendrix--another problem of aiming this documentary at a mass audience.The short segments of Paul McCartney are valuable. I especially liked his comment about shy musicians who blossom on stage: &#34;It's like they're let out of jail.&#34;But there are some glaring omissions. No mention whatsoever, for instance, of contractual problems, financial problems, and the use of band members as hired hands. Almost no mention of management issues. No explanation of cause of death. In short, nothing remotely controversial.The clips and photos of early street scenes (including a photo of the Cafe Wha? sign, and stills of Jimi in early bands) are wonderful. Some serious photo research was done here.Five stars because the positive elements matter so much. Maybe one star for the producer who allowed unimportant characters to chat ad-nauseam while editing down people who were actually involved in Hendrix's life and music.",5,Indispensable,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2409,"['probably', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'documentary', 'Hendrix', 'especially', 'valuable', 'moments', 'include', 'Eddie', 'Kramer', 'playing', 'master', 'tape', 'Little', 'Wing', 'demonstrating', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'vocal', 'when', 'down', 'other', 'tracks', 'pretty', 'much', 'comments', 'Chas', 'Chandler', 'Linda', 'Keith', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'commentary', 'clips', 'couple', 'other', 'female', 'friends', 'provide', 'perspective', 'was', 'sadly', 'missing', 'otherwise', 'comprehensive', 'book', '34', 'setting', 'record', 'straight.', '34', 'documentary', 'intended', 'mass', 'audience', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'idiots', 'instance', 'have', 'sit', 'little', 'lecture', 'flexibility', 'provided', 'multi-track', 'recording.And', 'selection', 'interviewees', 'spreads', 'net', 'much', 'more', 'widely', 'was', 'necessary', 'desirable', 'What', 'hell', 'Dweezil', 'Zappa', 'doing', 'here', 'pontificating', 'way', 'obvious', 'while', 'looking', 'edge', 'psycho', 'meltdown', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'journalist', 'David', 'Fricke', 'business', 'being', 'here', 'allowed', 'more', 'time', 'anyone', 'else', '34', 'sum', 'up', '34', 'half-baked', 'patronizing', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'style', 'so', 'characteristic', 'magazine', 'had', 'been', 'omitted', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'time', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'matter', 'such', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'allowed', 'far', 'less', 'deserved', 'Presumably', 'Fricke', 'was', 'considered', 'necessary', 'explain', 'Hendrix', 'problem', 'aiming', 'documentary', 'mass', 'audience.The', 'short', 'segments', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'are', 'valuable', 'especially', 'liked', 'comment', 'shy', 'musicians', 'who', 'blossom', 'stage', '34', ""'re"", 'let', 'jail.', '34', 'are', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'mention', 'whatsoever', 'instance', 'contractual', 'problems', 'financial', 'problems', 'use', 'band', 'members', 'hired', 'hands', 'Almost', 'mention', 'management', 'issues', 'explanation', 'cause', 'death', 'short', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'controversial.The', 'clips', 'photos', 'early', 'street', 'scenes', 'including', 'photo', 'Cafe', 'Wha', 'sign', 'stills', 'Jimi', 'early', 'bands', 'are', 'wonderful', 'serious', 'photo', 'research', 'was', 'done', 'here.Five', 'stars', 'positive', 'elements', 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'Maybe', 'one', 'star', 'producer', 'who', 'allowed', 'unimportant', 'characters', 'chat', 'ad-nauseam', 'editing', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'involved', 'Hendrix', 'life', 'music']",N/A
1669923,A2A2YGCSWWAF13,B00F031WB8,Classics Collector,"[13, 14]","For a brand new 2 hour documentary the low price is on the mark. This film does Hendrix' career justice by including a wealth of studio material, photographs, and many sight and sound examples of live performances.As Jimi's first manager (ex-Animal Chas Chandler, one of its better interviewees) states convincingly, Hendrix was not a tragic figure and his warm and fun loving but shy personality is evident throughout the film.  His early death is tragic to be certain, but his short life's work is infinitely brilliant.  The film is heavy on the 4 compressed years of his recording career and manages to include interviews with those who knew him best during this period. Kudos to the film's compilers for drawing on the important recollections of the now deceased Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, and Chas Chandler.  Wouldn't be complete without the views from his bandmates and they are in ample supply here.Not only is his virtuoso playing in evidence, it is also emphasized that Hendrix was not only a brilliant guitar stylist but a composer and sound shaper of the highest order.  His collaborations with sympathetic engineer Eddie Kramer were magnificent sonic statements and a strong argument is made, in spite of false notions that Hendrix was spent, that if not for his manic touring schedule and money woes and, finally, his death there would not have been many more amazing efforts by the two of them.I remembered thinking that when he died that he had ""probably peaked anyway"", which was a callous way for a 19 year old to rationalize his loss, the end of such an immense talent who had contributed so much to the musical landscape of my youth.

Jimi and his brother Leon grew up together.  You might also believe that Jimi's dad supported him in his musical pursuits.  He did not.  Jimi's dad Al considered a career in music to be impractical and did not buy Jimi any guitars as he said he did.  Jimi's aunt bought him a guitar.  Jimi's grandmother (his mother's mother) spent time with him when he was little while his dad was at work.  She was half Cherokee and told him old legends of the Cherokees and this had an influence on his songwriting.  Another influence on his songwriting were the science fiction novels he liked to read.  For example, the phrase ""Purple Haze"" came from one of those novels.  He liked Bob Dylan's lyrics and these also influenced him.  Another important issue is that Michael Jeffrey, his business manager, hid away most of the money Jimi earned from his concert performances, money that has never been found.  Let's hear more about his playing style, too, his technique.  Just what is he doing with his guitar?
