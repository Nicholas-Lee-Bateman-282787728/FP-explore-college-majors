1009945,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B000H5U5VM,Andrew Furst,"[34, 37]","While I can understand the frustration over the DVD - yes it could have been somewhat better, this is still a ""must have"" item for fans of The Cars music.  First off, while this is being sold as a DVD + CD, it might be better judged as the reverse, a CD + DVD.  It should be noted that the CD is not an audio version of the DVD performances, but in fact contains entirely different live performances than are found on the DVD (at least from what I can tell; if there's any overlap it's likely no more than 3 performances, but probably no overlap at all).  And I have no problem with the quality here; the audio quality (which is the most important part) is consistently good-to-great, while the concert video varies from ""perfect"" to at least highly watchable.  (Oddly enough, most of the lowest image quality video parts are the non-concert ""backstage"" scenes, which is no big loss since that's not the main attraction of the DVD).My best guess is that the CD is from a combination of 1984 and 1987 live-for-radio concerts (based on the sound and the setlist, along with the inclusion of both ""Double Trouble"" [1987 tour] and ""Heartbeat City"" [1984 tour]), fourteen songs, it's terrific.  The Cars were always great musicians with interesting songs, but sometimes their studio albums were so polished that they could sound a bit sterile.  This I feel was especially the case with the ""Candy-O"" album, which has many great songs, but after a while begins to sound almost as if a computer is performing rather than human beings.  And while this live CD doesn't depart much from the studio versions, it's different enough, and being live - it's ""raw"" enough - to be very interesting and enjoyable.  Again, the musicianship of the band is quite impressive, especially so given the circumstances of a live performance.The DVD likewise has some great live performances, and of course it's fun to actually see the band performing, rather than just hearing it (as on the CD).  But there is some frustration with the DVD, which is not the case with the CD.  The frustration comes from the fact that the live performances are sometimes interrupted visually by non-concert footage (or too many ""fan"" shots) even as the live concert is still fully heard, also interrupted by some behind-the-scenes video between the songs themselves. The ""behind the scenes"" stuff is occasionally interesting but more often just annoying, as a lot of what was selected for the DVD is mugging for the camera, throwing food, some sophomoric giving-the-finger, and generally acting weird for the heck of it.  As if the guys were auditioning for ""The Monkees"" tv show.  Probably the person who selected these scenes is more to blame than the band itself, since I doubt they acted like this all the time.  At any rate, you'll want to watch these scenes once, but then will likely choose to skip over them and just watch the concert footage.  And this is mostly easy to do via the chapter menu, but could have been made even easier (sometimes you are forced to watch a bit of the non-concert footage).  And finally, a few of the songs start and play for a few seconds, but then fade out and are not fully performed.  This happens with the song ""Getting Through"" which starts out for about 10 seconds and then they cut off the song completely.  Frustrating.  Yet it's better to have even those 10 seconds than none of it at all, and I'd guess that about 20-21 songs are performed in their entirety on the DVD, so that's a good thing.  I also would have just made the 5 ""bonus"" DVD songs part of the ""regular"" show, so that's another minor frustration, but it's great to have those songs here at all.  And while some people would prefer a ""pure concert"" video, compare this to the Who's ""Kids are alright"" or U2's ""Rattle and Hum"" and this leans much more to ""pure concert"" and less to ""other"", so a little ""other"" is fine and at times enjoyable (I particularly liked the snippet of Ben grimacing during an out-of-tune beginning to ""Just what I needed"", apparently in rehearsal).The book is slickly printed, has some decent pictures of the band, but is otherwise somewhat worthless.  There's no biography of the band in the book, no listing of the concert venues and dates from which the DVD and CD performances are drawn (a major omission, IMO).  And the printed lyrics are only snippets from various songs, some of which aren't even found on either the DVD or CD.Bottom line, you get about 35 full (or nearly full) live performances of The Cars, in mostly very good/great sound quality.  I'm counting about 21 full/nearly full songs on the DVD, and 14 full songs on the CD.  You get some backstage video.  You get a book with a few pictures.  I'm rating this for what it is, not what it could have been; in fact I give this 4.5 stars, could have easily made it ""5 stars"" for the Amazon rating due to the over 30 great, full live song performances for this reasonable price, despite a few frustrations. Now what this could have been, might have been even better. For example, some of the best songs from the live DVD are from Houston 1984, but its only part of that concert (three songs).  Ditto for the Philadelphia 1987 and US Festival 1982, these are major highlights, but would have been even better to get the entire Philadelphia 1987 show (here they give us five songs, three of which are in the ""bonus"" section), the entire US Festival set (rather than just two songs), and the entire Houston show (a 60 minute VHS tape was released from the filmed Houston concerts, but is out of print and was never on DVD).  So I say get this item, get the ""Musikladen"" DVD (the ""Cars Live"" one), even see if you can get the out of print 1984-85 (Houston) VHS.  Maybe even get the Live Aid DVD, for a couple Cars songs.  And hope that there may be even more complete Cars concert DVD videos and CDs in the future.  But clearly it's better to have this as it is, than not at all. Thanks Ric and the rest for making this available, and come on fans - just get it and enjoy it.",4,Awesome live CD + sometimes great/sometimes frustrating DVD,1164499200,"11 26,

Their ability to split the difference between what was ""new wave"" and ""rock & roll"" at that time remains unmatched. What's more, you can hear their influence live on 25 years later in bands like Franz Ferdinand and The Strokes.However, they were one of the worst live acts ever to step on a stage. Cardboard cut-outs of the band members would have more life than they ever did. In fact, the only Cars concert that had any life to it was the now-infamous ""New Cars"" tour when Todd Rundgren was behind the steering wheel. That rendition of the band actually talked. They actually moved. They actually smiled. Above all, they performed with the sense of FUN that their music always had.Colbert and others can poke fun at the New Cars all they want; until this band can display as much humanity as musicianship, they will remain a band that is best enjoyed in the car or at a party. It will be interesting to see if Slick Ric has developed any stage presence in all these years.Eager for the new release.In the meantime, this is the Cars live, which means it's pretty lifeless.",2,The Cars were/are a great studio band.

This summer there was a tour and CD release by ""The New Cars,"" but ""The Cars Unlocked"" features live performances from the most well known line up of The Cars-Ric Ocasek, Benjamin Orr, David Robinson, Greg Hawkes and Elliot Easton.The Cars-Unlocked is a totally sweet awesome release that a fan of The Cars won't want to miss. The set features not only a live performance DVD, but a live performance CD as well. The Cars-Unlocked was released by Docurama.The DVD portion of the disc is comprised of various concert performances--all of which occurred at least twenty years ago. There is a small text at the beginning of the DVD which explains that the footage is old and has been restored to the best it can be. Despite the warning, the DVD looks pretty good, it's just in certain places like various interviews it has that VHS tape look to it. The candid interviews and the rare pictures are awesome.The Cars-Unlocked gives fans a true behind the scenes and back seat look at the group from their early days to the peak of their success in the mid 1980s. The DVD includes performances of some of their most well known hits including ""You Might Think,"" ""Drive,"" ""Shake It Up,"" ""Magic,"" and ""Let's Go."" There is also some great footage of late band member Benjamin Orr.The Cars-Unlocked is a must have for fans. Great effort was put into the production of the DVD. Long time Cars front man Ric Ocasek served as the producers for The Cars-Unlocked.The DVD features 20 songs and 5 bonus performances. Mixed in the DVD are photos and interviews. Inside is a 28 page lyric book which includes partial lyrics to the songs and photos. The DVD is presented in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The CD includes 14 digitally re-mastered songs from The Cars.The Cars Unlocked is an excellent release.

If you were alive in the era of Super 8 film, you get the idea what this looks like.  Very grainy, flat colors, lots of jerky camera work.  Even the audio is only adequate, comparable to that from my 1968 JC Penney cassette player.Is it a total loss?  No, thank goodness we have at least this bit of nostalgia.  However, you will find ""The Cars Live - Musikladen 1979"" to be a better investment if you need to choose one or the other.  It's an entire concert rather than bits and pieces, and the film or tape was preserved fairly well.  The audio is good enough to turn the volume way up.More about this bus wreck....one of the songs is from a performance in San Bernardino at the US Festival in 1982.  Just as I noted above, it appears that Ric or Ben kept the video tape next to a box of magnets for 20 years.  In contrast, the ""Ramones It's Alive 1974-1996"" DVD has a performance (of the Ramones) from the same 1982 festival, nine songs in brilliant color, sharp focus, and thundering audio, as if they played it yesterday.  Why then didn't the Cars preserve the same quality of video?I wonder if this DVD could have had the video cleaned up, or maybe cleaner versions of the segments could be found.  And, why not include an entire concert rather than bits and pieces?  Better than dress this up with a nice book, the investment should have been in the video and audio.  More suitably, the cover should have resembled a tattered LP jacket.The Cars was one of my favorite skinny-tie bands.  They made a lot of good music that is poorly captured here.

If you're ok with a song starting and playing for a minute or two and then seeing the group randomly wander around backstage or on the sets of some of their videos WHILE the song continues to play in the background, then this collection is for you. If you want to see a full Cars concert, buy the 1979 Musikladen DVD as that is much better than this in terms of delivering a live show. A couple of reviewers have mentioned the quality of the footage---it is hit or miss. I realize some of this footage was taken from the 70's and there are lines of static that roll through certain songs, BUT I happen to have seen a show from '78 and another from '84 (both of which this DVD draws footage from) and they look and sound better than what has been released here. Now why would the label and/or Ric Ocasek not have access to better footage to use in this release? It does exist somewhere (both shows I mentioned were shot for TV). All in all, for nostalgic purposes, it's decent, but for sheer live performance, look elsewhere. Oh, the CD sounds fine but is sort of an afterthought compared to the video, which was the primary selling point of the whole package.",1,"Car crash, a total wreck",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1519,"['reviews', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'singing', 'praises', 'yes', 'nice', 'have', 'footage', 'Cars', 'playing', 'live', ""'re"", 'ok', 'songs', 'being', 'talked', 'seeing', 'random', 'backstage', 'footage', 'other', 'wastes', 'time', 'Note', 'how', 'labeled', 'Live', 'Performances', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'Well', 'do', '-in', 'limited', 'amounts', ""'re"", 'ok', 'song', 'starting', 'playing', 'minute', 'two', 'then', 'seeing', 'group', 'wander', 'around', 'backstage', 'sets', 'videos', 'song', 'play', 'background', 'then', 'collection', 'want', 'see', 'full', 'Cars', 'concert', 'buy', '1979', 'Musikladen', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'terms', 'delivering', 'live', 'show', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'quality', 'footage', '-it', 'hit', 'miss', 'realize', 'footage', 'was', 'taken', '70', 'are', 'lines', 'static', 'roll', 'certain', 'songs', 'BUT', 'happen', 'have', 'seen', 'show', ""'78"", ""'84"", 'DVD', 'footage', 'look', 'sound', 'better', 'what', 'been', 'released', 'here', 'Now', 'why', 'would', 'label', 'and/or', 'Ric', 'Ocasek', 'not', 'have', 'access', 'better', 'footage', 'use', 'release', 'exist', 'somewhere', 'shows', 'mentioned', 'were', 'shot', 'TV', 'nostalgic', 'purposes', 'decent', 'sheer', 'live', 'performance', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Oh', 'CD', 'fine', 'sort', 'afterthought', 'compared', 'video', 'was', 'primary', 'selling', 'point', 'whole', 'package']",N/A

1009955,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B000H5U5VM,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[11, 14]","One look at the packaging of this latest ""Cars Unlocked"" release and fans will think it contains outstanding quality. Well if you're a ""Cars"" fan like me, you'll be completely disappointed with this DVD/CD release once you open it. The outside packaging looks fantastic but it's the absolute worst idea I have ever seen. The DVD and CD sit inside a 28 page photo booklet and each disc slides into a paper sleeve built into the front & back booklet cover.The packaging for this release is so cheap,that the disc's were already scratched before I even had a chance to play them. The twenty so called never-before seen live performances are just a collection from various US tours from 1978-1987 and the quality of the sound & video range from average to poor. The Dolby 5.1 sound is inconsistent throughout the DVD and the video transfer isn't much better than a bootleg video. The video transfer is grainy and riddled with all sorts of imperfections and the poor editing and camera work make this DVD even more frustrating to watch.As for the audio CD included in this set, the sound quality isn't anything to really get excited about. The studio has also included a disclaimer regarding the sound and video quality for this release. Unfortunately you don't see it until you put the disc into your player and by then it's too late. Let's be honest if they put the disclaimer on the outside of the package, nobody would buy it. This review is strictly my opinion of what I've seen and heard in this ""Cars"" release and it's definitely not worthy of a five star rating. Fortunately for me I was able to return it due to the severe scratches from the poor package design and I didn't bother with a replacement copy. My advice to ""Cars"" fans is to steer clear of this release.DVD Features:20 songs plus 5 bonus performances28 page photo lyric bookDolby 5.1 Surround SoundTrailerIncludes a brand-new full length CD: The Cars Unlocked - The Live PerformancesSongs:1.

1009957,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B000H5U5VM,T.M. Reader,"[3, 4]","This 2006 production includes a music CD and a DVD, both of live concert recordings.  They come nicely packaged in a book/sleeve.  There is a lot a range in previous Amazon reviews of this work, critical of restoration quality, editing, etc.  All I know, is that the entertainment value was there 100% for me.Sure, some of the hotel room stuff was dumb (throwing a sandwich on the wall), but in one segment the guys were commenting on how they didn't know how to use this handheld videocam (brand new technology then) that was running and actually provided this piece.  Duh, no wonder it wasn't perfect.  This videotape footage was NEVER meant to be seen by the public.  On the upside, I never really had any clue to the off-stage personalities of the band members and this behind-the-scenes footage reveals a lot.  Very interesting.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY by the couple of film segments covering pre-concert soundchecks that transitioned the same tune into the live concert footage (that had to be  a Ric Ocasek production idea).  Wow!  That footage alone was worth the price.  The concerts range in date from 1978 thru 1987.  I enjoyed studying the change in the band's style over that period (and the color of Benjamin Orr's hair).The DVD provides 20 live concert tunes plus 6 live ""bonus songs"".  I think the bonus songs were segregated out because the film quality was generally inferior.  The music CD contains 14 live concert performances, remastered nicely.  These live performances were a fresh new listening experience for me, of songs that I've listened to scores of times.  Extremely entertaining.  The CD alone is worth the price.  This all comes in a very attractive 28 page book (in a sleeve to boot) containing a montage of photos and partial song lyrics. The book alone is worth the price.If you love The Cars, ignore the music snobs and get this.  You must! Do not let a critic talk you out of buying this because in their opinion, "". . . it's not perfect"".  There is nothing else out there like this.  Don't miss it.  Put either in (DVD or CD) and turn up the volume.
