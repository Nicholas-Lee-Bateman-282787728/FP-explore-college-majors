I like how there is equal focus on both the drawbacks and the positives of being a call girl.  Billie Piper is a gem.  I disliked the actor that played the best friend; what a bore!I also hated the lighting in most of the episodes.  Is it supposed to look like a soft porn set?

1193866,A28520G802EENS,B001GCUBS2,Christina Ovalle,"[33, 37]","The smart films and tv shows about sex workers realize and narratively utilize that there is a vast difference between a high class escort and say, someone you would pick up in the seedy part of town.  It's like comparing a wealthy corporate lawyer to a struggling independent--similar enough, yet drastically different lifestyle/daily life.  This show acknowledges that aspect from the start--quite literally in a voice over--and is about a high class escort who goes by ""Belle.""  (It's based, though I'm not sure how closely, on the memoirs/blog of an actual London escort.)Like most media about ""courtesans"" it tends to over-glamourize its material and is to an extent the traditional ""happy hooker story,"" but it counter-balances that and partially justifies itself by developing an interesting, fairly well-developed protagonist--one who enjoys the money and the sex, but finds some inner conflict in leading a double life, dealing with various issues, etc.  The most interesting parts of the show to me were the exploration of this duality/lifestyle, though for those of you also interested in its sexual content--there is plenty of that as well.  I find the show quite addicting and very fast paced.  i also am not usually a fan of british humor (i just usually don't ""get it"") but i find the show funny and the drama is balanced well (strong enough to be interesting, but not overwhelming in balance with the show's comedy--it's ""drama-lite."")I did want to say one last thing, about the DVD picture quality which someone said was a very poor treatment/transfer.  I can only speak from my own experience, but in my case I found almost NO difference between the DVD played upscaled on my blu-ray player (PS3), and watching the show in HD on Showtime (using the same television for both viewings.) The picture quality in my experience, was quite fine, though not everyone has HD or upscaling and people's picture calibrations may differ.",4,A more balanced than usual look at escorting...,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,1942,"['smart', 'films', 'tv', 'shows', 'sex', 'workers', 'realize', 'narratively', 'utilize', 'vast', 'difference', 'high', 'class', 'escort', 'say', 'someone', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'seedy', 'part', 'town', 'comparing', 'wealthy', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'struggling', 'independent', 'similar', 'enough', 'yet', 'drastically', 'different', 'lifestyle/daily', 'life', 'show', 'aspect', 'start', 'quite', 'literally', 'voice', 'high', 'class', 'escort', 'who', 'Belle', 'based', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'closely', 'memoirs/blog', 'actual', 'London', 'escort', 'most', 'media', 'courtesans', 'over-glamourize', 'material', 'extent', 'traditional', 'happy', 'hooker', 'story', 'partially', 'justifies', 'developing', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'well-developed', 'protagonist', 'one', 'who', 'money', 'sex', 'inner', 'conflict', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'dealing', 'various', 'issues', 'etc', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'show', 'were', 'exploration', 'duality/lifestyle', 'also', 'interested', 'sexual', 'content', 'plenty', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'show', 'quite', 'addicting', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'i', 'also', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'british', 'humor', 'i', 'just', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'i', 'find', 'show', 'funny', 'drama', 'balanced', 'well', 'strong', 'enough', 'be', 'interesting', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'balance', 'show', 'comedy', 'drama-lite', 'did', 'want', 'say', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'someone', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'treatment/transfer', 'can', 'only', 'speak', 'own', 'experience', 'case', 'found', 'almost', 'NO', 'difference', 'DVD', 'played', 'upscaled', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'PS3', 'watching', 'show', 'HD', 'Showtime', 'using', 'same', 'television', 'viewings', 'picture', 'quality', 'experience', 'was', 'quite', 'fine', 'not', 'everyone', 'HD', 'upscaling', 'people', 'picture', 'calibrations', 'may', 'differ']",Secret Diary of a Call Girl: Season 1

IF you have enough $$, you can rent it from a High Society call girl like Belle.  Some clients just rent her time once, while other clients use her services as routinely as they would a cashier @ a Supermarket.What is interesting about this DVD is that the episodes are based on real-life adventures of a British call girl.  The DVD explores different facets of what a call girl must be fluent in, such as the Girlfriend Experience (known as GFE in Escort circles), group sex, threesomes, S & M and dominatrix stuff.  There's more to being a courtesan than many may realize!Billie Piper is perfect as the lead role.  She is exquisite, sophisticated enough to pass for a high society harlot and sultry enough to take things to the bedroom.  The one complaint I have is that I was expecting more nudity.  While there is occasionally nudity here & there, the series is not saturated with it (as I thought it would be).For those who are fascinated by the prostitution underworld, this series is a must-have (at least the 1st season, anyway).

The first season is sharper overall and quite good. If you like the story of Hannah/Belle in season 1, you will want to watch season 2. Billie Piper presents an interesting complex character that is confident when playing as ""Belle"" but is confused, rudderless, and lacking maturity when just ""herself"". The season starts out slow but builds to the drama of the second half of season 2.The tawdry action is not as inventive, active, or funny the second season, and Billie Piper does not look as sexy as apparently Piper was pregnant at the time of filming. The production tries to hide her puffier pregnant body and uses body doubles for some scenes, so the second series does not quite have the same edge and raunchiness. Belle is given an apprentice of sorts this season, called Bambi, and that character tries to take up the slack in humour and sex appeal, and has some good moments.

She makes it clear she's never been sexually abused and is not a drug addict. She just likes the two things that make being an escort appealing-sex and money. She has emotional problems with keeping her work and personal life separate. While Belle doesn't mind having emotionally unattached sex with strangers, she does mind being emotionally detached from her friends and family. Season One delves into Belle's sexual adventures and slowly reveals her career to her best friend.The Secret Diary of a Call Girl is all that you might expect. There is a bit ofPretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition)fantasy in here with Belle meeting and mating with lots of rich eligible bachelors, Belle shopping for fabulous clothes and sex toys, and Belle looking great in expensive corsets. There is also a lot of behind the scenes information about what it takes to be a call girl-like constant exercise and waxing and the occasional creep. It's a fun fantasy story told against the back drop of glamorous London. Billie Piper is nice to watch and a definite asset to the series.If you like this show, you'll probably find the BBC seriesCoupling - The Complete Seasons 1-4equally entertaining.",4,A Titallating Romp In the World Of Escorts,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,1322,"['Belle', 'named', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'character', 'inBelle', 'Jour', 'high', 'class', 'London', 'escort', 'who', 'job', 'good', 'clear', 'never', 'been', 'sexually', 'abused', 'not', 'drug', 'addict', 'just', 'two', 'things', 'make', 'being', 'escort', 'appealing-sex', 'money', 'emotional', 'problems', 'keeping', 'work', 'personal', 'life', 'separate', 'Belle', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'emotionally', 'unattached', 'sex', 'strangers', 'mind', 'being', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'friends', 'family', 'Season', 'One', 'Belle', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'career', 'best', 'friend.The', 'Secret', 'Diary', 'Call', 'Girl', 'might', 'expect', 'bit', 'ofPretty', 'Woman', '15th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Edition', 'fantasy', 'here', 'Belle', 'meeting', 'mating', 'lots', 'rich', 'eligible', 'bachelors', 'Belle', 'shopping', 'fabulous', 'clothes', 'sex', 'toys', 'Belle', 'looking', 'great', 'expensive', 'corsets', 'also', 'lot', 'scenes', 'information', 'what', 'be', 'call', 'girl-like', 'constant', 'exercise', 'waxing', 'occasional', 'creep', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'story', 'told', 'back', 'drop', 'glamorous', 'London', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'nice', 'watch', 'definite', 'asset', 'series.If', 'show', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'BBC', 'seriesCoupling', 'Complete', 'Seasons', '1-4equally', 'entertaining']",Secret Diary of a Call Girl: Season 1
1193884,A2UEYABFGK4IVZ,B001GCUBS2,"Wicked Ways ""Karina""","[0, 0]","The second season of the high class escort ""Belle de Jour"" or Hannah Baxter by daytime is sooo much more better than the first. Billie Piper plays Belle/Hannah with much more comfort and the show starts exploring with much more depth the quite realistic world of being a prostitute. Belle is back with her sexual adventures for money, and this time around the writers give her 3 problems, a boyfriend, who she desperatley tries to hold onto, a new friend, a dow eyed new to the business Bambi, and the increasinlgy problematic nature of Belle's job. What I admire about the second season, is that the writers never let the viewers loose sight or get caught up in the glamour of having a whole bunch of money, and being your own boss. Yes, Belle can buy the expensive bags, and works a couple of hours a day, but when one of Belle's clients at a party turns out to be a lot more than she bargained for, the viewer really sees, that YES! it is dangerous to be paid by strange men to sleep with them, because not everyone has good intentions. The dangerous  physical reality of Belle's job is shown twice this season, but the show is full of lighthearted moments, such as Belle's first client of the second season, who has quite a humourous request. I would highly reccomend this show, its witty, charming, and it gives you a little inside into a high class escorts life.",3,"Second season better than first, Belle shines!",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,1368,"['second', 'season', 'high', 'class', 'escort', 'Belle', 'de', 'Jour', 'Hannah', 'Baxter', 'daytime', 'sooo', 'much', 'more', 'better', 'first', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Belle/Hannah', 'much', 'more', 'comfort', 'show', 'exploring', 'much', 'more', 'quite', 'realistic', 'world', 'being', 'prostitute', 'Belle', 'back', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'money', 'time', 'writers', 'give', '3', 'problems', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'desperatley', 'tries', 'hold', 'onto', 'new', 'friend', 'dow', 'eyed', 'new', 'business', 'Bambi', 'increasinlgy', 'problematic', 'nature', 'Belle', 'job', 'What', 'admire', 'second', 'season', 'writers', 'never', 'let', 'viewers', 'loose', 'sight', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'glamour', 'having', 'whole', 'bunch', 'money', 'being', 'own', 'boss', 'Yes', 'Belle', 'can', 'buy', 'expensive', 'bags', 'couple', 'hours', 'day', 'when', 'one', 'Belle', 'clients', 'party', 'out', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'bargained', 'viewer', 'really', 'YES', 'dangerous', 'be', 'paid', 'strange', 'men', 'sleep', 'not', 'everyone', 'good', 'intentions', 'dangerous', 'physical', 'reality', 'Belle', 'job', 'shown', 'twice', 'season', 'show', 'full', 'lighthearted', 'moments', 'such', 'Belle', 'first', 'client', 'second', 'season', 'who', 'quite', 'humourous', 'request', 'would', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'show', 'witty', 'charming', 'little', 'inside', 'high', 'class', 'escorts', 'life']",Secret Diary of a Call Girl: Season 1
