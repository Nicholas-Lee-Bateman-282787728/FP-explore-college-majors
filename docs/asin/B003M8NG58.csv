A way to bolster the at-home teaching she's receiving that inward beauty is what pleases God.  I very much wanted to -- and expected to -- like this video, but just didn't.  There were several shorts including the Sweetpea Beauty and Snoodlerella.  The messages were just a little off to my way of thinking.Snoodlerella really was an awkward, homely girl with glasses and braces and an abominable hair-do and of course her step-mom and sisters deride her. She gets a magical makeover and is the belle of the ball until midnight when once again the braces, glasses and hair reappear and everyone loses interest in her.... except for the king, of course, the God-figure who made her and loves her, who comes to dance with her. Disdain is shown by all other characters in the video for the plain, awkward child!  Not the lesson you want to teach a child.Sweetpea Beauty is a lovely girl, but the messages that surround her story were again a little off and distracting.  Again physical beauty was glorified, even as they were teaching that inward beauty mattered most! There's got to be a better way to teach your little miss about inward beauty and take the emphasis off the outward looks. On the positive side, Sweatpea does have a beautiful voice and the songs were very pretty.",2,"Great idea, but fell short",1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,1399,"['am', 'Christian', 'grandmother', 'was', 'search', 'DVD', 'would', 'teach', 'Godly', 'principles', 'beautiful', 'granddaughter', 'way', 'bolster', 'at-home', 'teaching', 'receiving', 'inward', 'beauty', 'what', 'God', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'expected', 'video', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'were', 'several', 'shorts', 'including', 'Sweetpea', 'Beauty', 'Snoodlerella', 'messages', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'off', 'way', 'thinking.Snoodlerella', 'really', 'was', 'awkward', 'homely', 'girl', 'glasses', 'braces', 'abominable', 'hair-do', 'course', 'step-mom', 'sisters', 'deride', 'magical', 'makeover', 'belle', 'ball', 'midnight', 'when', 'once', 'again', 'braces', 'glasses', 'hair', 'reappear', 'everyone', 'interest', 'king', 'course', 'God-figure', 'who', 'made', 'who', 'dance', 'Disdain', 'shown', 'other', 'characters', 'video', 'plain', 'awkward', 'child', 'Not', 'lesson', 'want', 'teach', 'child.Sweetpea', 'Beauty', 'lovely', 'girl', 'messages', 'surround', 'story', 'were', 'again', 'little', 'off', 'distracting', 'Again', 'physical', 'beauty', 'was', 'glorified', 'even', 'were', 'teaching', 'inward', 'beauty', 'mattered', 'most', 'got', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'teach', 'little', 'miss', 'inward', 'beauty', 'take', 'emphasis', 'outward', 'positive', 'side', 'Sweatpea', 'have', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'pretty']",VeggieTales: Sweetpea Beauty

Most of the feedback was really positive, so I bought it for my little girl.  She likes it.  Yes, I enjoy watching this with her, but there are a few things I didn't like.  One was the silly song.  The silly song is hilarious, its Larry trying to sell pants, like certain channels on TV.  The end made it very unpleasant.  Papa Grape pulls off pants from the two guys helping Larry.  For a movie that is suppose to be for young children, I find that very inappropriate.  Second, Sweetpea Beauty, as pictured on the front, has a very preachy, not very good acting voice.

Neither me or my wife liked it.We own almost every Veggie Tales DVD they've released and our son watches the shows daily.  We love Veggie Tales and enjoy watching the shows with family.  Except for Sweetpea Beauty...First of all, it looks terrible!  The graphics look worse than the original shows.  I don't mind ugly graphics but in this show there are no textures, things just looked terrible, there were bugs in the rendering, I felt like I was watching one of the first shows released.  (it's funny too, because it's a show about inner beauty)If it just looked terrible I wouldn't mind but the story was bland too.  They felt empty.  Generally veggie tales is entertaining for adults and kids and has enough doctrine to give me things to think about but this show didn't work for me.  I felt like they just threw things out there without thinking through what they were trying to say.  Furthermore there was only one spot I even cracked a smile at.  I found the silly song just plain annoying too.I agree with people that the shows have gotten shallow lately but I don't think this one was any better.

I'm still an avid fan to this day; still collecting the videos and enjoying them with my family. This one caught my eye when I saw the cover, it was certainty much more pink than any other VeggieTales movies I've seen. Yeah, it seems Big idea is trying to branch out to the little girls for this one. That's a welcome idea, I do appreciate how Big Idea is trying to make VeggieTales more inclusive to all genders for this one.The stories for this DVD focus on the importance of self respect. Another welcome idea, I think that's a wonderful message for children and adults alike and I kind of wish more children's shows would tackle it. It's a shame because, while I like the values being portrayed here, this VeggieTales kind of edges towards mediocrity.This movie feels, for a lack of a better word, unfinished. Like I said, I like the message, and there are some decent songs in this one. But there's a lot of unfinished textures and rushed animation, and it gets pretty distracting. There aren't that many good jokes in here, and that's a bit of a let down because the humor of VeggieTales is always what made it's stories entertaining. I can't think of much for me to actually recommend it.But if you have a son or daughter who really loves VeggieTales, and you want them to get good values out of their programming, then I guess this is harmless.

Don't make it complicated, like some weird early '90s love croon.Then there's the editing. Seriously, guys, how can you put out a product this disorganized?
