I bought each of the individual seasons put out by this company, and was very upset when they announced they were not putting out a stand alone set for the last season, but instead would have to purchase the entire series (thereby repurchasing the 3 seasons I'd already bought from them..) This annoyed a LOT of muppet fans.Anyway, I now have this as well.  A lot of people had problems with disks being scratched to the point where they needed to get replacement disks.  I got lucky and do not seem to have had that problem, though nearly half my disks were loose on arrival.  The packaging looks great, but is really impractical. It does not fit well on most shelves intended for dvd collections, it is a complicated, multi-step process to get in and out, and the disks do not stay well inside the cardboard sleeves. This leads to lots of sliding in and out, causing the disks to be scratched and damaged.Like most people I've talked to who have this, I've taken the disks out and placed them in a different case and this big piece of art they call packaging, is sitting elsewhere off by itself.It is a shame that this company made some of the decisions they did.  They alienated a lot of their customers and most of us will think several times before buying any sort of series from them.The show itself is, of course, as wonderful now as it was originally, and it is a testament to that fact that so many of us have put up with this mess and basically bought the series twice in order to get the final season. I wish I could give this 5 stars.. for the show.. definately rates that, but the packaging and HIT's decisions have to knock a few stars off..",3,"great show, bad packaging, naughty company",1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1676,"['love', 'fraggle', 'rock', 'bought', 'individual', 'seasons', 'put', 'out', 'company', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'when', 'announced', 'were', 'not', 'putting', 'out', 'stand', 'alone', 'set', 'last', 'season', 'instead', 'would', 'have', 'purchase', 'entire', 'series', 'repurchasing', '3', 'seasons', ""'d"", 'already', 'bought', 'them..', 'LOT', 'muppet', 'fans.Anyway', 'now', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'people', 'had', 'problems', 'disks', 'being', 'scratched', 'point', 'where', 'needed', 'get', 'replacement', 'disks', 'got', 'lucky', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'though', 'nearly', 'half', 'disks', 'were', 'loose', 'arrival', 'packaging', 'great', 'really', 'impractical', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'most', 'shelves', 'intended', 'dvd', 'collections', 'complicated', 'multi-step', 'process', 'get', 'disks', 'do', 'not', 'stay', 'well', 'cardboard', 'lots', 'sliding', 'causing', 'disks', 'be', 'scratched', 'damaged.Like', 'most', 'people', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'who', 'have', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'disks', 'out', 'placed', 'different', 'case', 'big', 'piece', 'art', 'call', 'packaging', 'sitting', 'elsewhere', 'itself.It', 'shame', 'company', 'made', 'decisions', 'did', 'alienated', 'lot', 'customers', 'most', 'will', 'think', 'several', 'times', 'buying', 'sort', 'series', 'them.The', 'show', 'course', 'wonderful', 'now', 'was', 'originally', 'testament', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'mess', 'basically', 'bought', 'series', 'twice', 'order', 'get', 'final', 'season', 'wish', 'could', 'give', '5', 'stars..', 'show..', 'definately', 'rates', 'packaging', 'HIT', 'decisions', 'have', 'knock', 'few', 'stars', 'off..']",Fraggle Rock: The Complete Series Collection

As you can see from all these reviews it was possibly not the best marketing venture for Hit to take.I do believe however that a stand alone edition will be on sale eventually ... I mean, they would be foolish not to do this. I do believe that this box-set is worth every penny and if you did buy this item for your family then it will be worth the cost and no doubt it will be something of a collectors item one day ... however these things are to be enjoyed, life is too short!So, yes I agree with everyone here but I like to believe that Hit wanted to create something wonderful for the fans and I imagine this is something of a Swans song, for as much as I would love Fraggle Rock to return it may not hit all the right notes again. It will be interesting to see what they can do with the Fraggle world since season four wrapped up many ideas which had been running through out the series ... the Gorgs were at peace with the Fraggles ... the Doozers and the Fraggles understood each other more fully and Doc came to see the wonder of another world and grew, spiritually I would say, as a result of this encounter.Fraggle Rock has not been released in England in the same fashion, in series box sets, since someone lost all the master tapes and only 12 episodes remain. For me I will always love the idea of Fraggle Rock existing under a light house, just off the coast of Scotland; as this reinforced the idea Fraggle Rock offered, that it was a beacon for a better world and like a light house, guided it's audience to better shores. Falton Mackay was the Captain of Fraggle Rock Light House and Sprocket (puppeteered by David Barclay and Louise Gold over here) still retained his proud, stubborn and playful manner. I also loved the juxtaposition between the real world and the Fraggle World; the light house scenes were airy, with the sounds of seagulls out side and the waves against rocks and this contrasted the subterranean world of Fraggle Rock beautifully. I would still like to think that the British version will one day appear but till then, this is a wonderful reminder and we have at least 12 episodes. So, yes, I have bought this item....",5,We are the Children of Tomorrow ... each one is different and the same ...,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,2517,"['item', 'ideal', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'other', 'editions', 'now', 'indeed', 'lovely', 'gift', 'nephew', 'niece', 'who', 'still', 'discover', 'Fraggle', 'Rock.I', 'do', 'think', 'Hit', 'should', 'have', 'issued', 'stand', 'alone', 'edition', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'afford', 're-buy', 'what', 'already', 'own', 'should', 'have', 'too', 'order', 'access', 'last', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'was', 'possibly', 'not', 'best', 'marketing', 'venture', 'Hit', 'take.I', 'do', 'believe', 'however', 'stand', 'alone', 'edition', 'will', 'be', 'sale', 'eventually', 'mean', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'not', 'do', 'do', 'believe', 'box-set', 'worth', 'penny', 'did', 'buy', 'item', 'family', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'cost', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'collectors', 'item', 'one', 'day', 'however', 'things', 'are', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'too', 'short', 'So', 'yes', 'agree', 'everyone', 'here', 'like', 'believe', 'Hit', 'wanted', 'create', 'something', 'wonderful', 'fans', 'imagine', 'something', 'Swans', 'song', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'love', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'return', 'may', 'not', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Fraggle', 'world', 'season', 'four', 'wrapped', 'up', 'many', 'ideas', 'had', 'been', 'running', 'series', 'Gorgs', 'were', 'peace', 'Fraggles', 'Doozers', 'Fraggles', 'understood', 'other', 'more', 'fully', 'Doc', 'came', 'see', 'wonder', 'world', 'grew', 'spiritually', 'would', 'say', 'result', 'encounter.Fraggle', 'Rock', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'England', 'same', 'fashion', 'series', 'box', 'sets', 'someone', 'lost', 'master', 'tapes', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'remain', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'idea', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'existing', 'light', 'house', 'just', 'coast', 'Scotland', 'reinforced', 'idea', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'offered', 'was', 'beacon', 'better', 'world', 'light', 'house', 'guided', 'audience', 'better', 'shores', 'Falton', 'Mackay', 'was', 'Captain', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'Light', 'House', 'Sprocket', 'puppeteered', 'David', 'Barclay', 'Louise', 'Gold', 'here', 'still', 'retained', 'proud', 'stubborn', 'playful', 'manner', 'also', 'loved', 'juxtaposition', 'real', 'world', 'Fraggle', 'World', 'light', 'house', 'scenes', 'were', 'airy', 'sounds', 'seagulls', 'side', 'waves', 'rocks', 'contrasted', 'subterranean', 'world', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'beautifully', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'think', 'British', 'version', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'appear', 'till', 'then', 'wonderful', 'reminder', 'have', 'least', '12', 'episodes', 'So', 'yes', 'have', 'bought', 'item']",Fraggle Rock: The Complete Series Collection

Too bad the same thought was put into the holding of the discs, I lucked out and found one that didn't have scratched discs, but most of them where not in there slots and I had to put them back in.  I can't imagine being that lucky by mail since there's basically a binder inside of it that could easily break discs.  Also if you hold the box the wrong way they just come flying out of the slots again, a pain if you have friends/kids that just like to pick things up.So overall, I have to say this, I mainly bought this because I love the show and was able to get it at [...] at the time, thus better then getting two seasons solo and I love it at that price.

There is an unspoken and unofficial understanding between consumers and DVD companies that if they release these season-by-season packs, then they will do it completely, and usually also release a full boxed set once the run is complete for those who didn't buy the individuals. HIT chose not to go that way, and that sucks big time. However, that said, the discs in this set are great. There is ample bonus material, and they didn't leave anything out. However, I also echo some consumer complaints here about the packaging. These kinds of packaging schemes are very annoying, and this one is near the top in annoyance factor. The way it is, you can't really set it in a library in any good way. The front is just a plastic inset that fits inside the box, so if you stand it up to face out, that plastic feels really loose. So, ditch the box you say? Well, not really, since the binder that the DVDs are actually in has an odd moulded shape to it, and wouldn't ""feel"" right just laying around naked and alone. Another case of the art/marketing department run amok, with no real sense for practicality. It actually kind of makes you not want to get them out and watch them, because it's such a hassle. Bad form HIT. That and the cardboard sleeves (as others have said) have a bad habit of letting the DVDs just slip out and rattle around.

I was looking to purchase this when I heard it was coming out,well it's not going to happen! I will forgo this until the people who have already bought seasons 1-3 are taken care of! I was in a sort of similar situation when M*A*S*H was being released individually. then in their full box set(all we were missing was the bonus material that they released in the box set but not in the season sets,no where as bad as this is I know) & I joined the many fans who wrote,e-mailed & called FOX repeatedly till eventually they released the bonus stuff! Had to repurchase the final episode but was worth it to get the missing material without having to buy the whole box set. Anyway I stand with you all that were in essense given the royal kick in the butt after supporting them by buying the first 3 season sets & then told to go jump in a lake.......I will not buy this till HIT pulls thier heads out of their butt!

1185999,AWUV9GX0Q6WPJ,B001EL6EBS,"Uncle Joe ""uncle_joe_25""","[2, 2]","I purchased the Fraggle Rock box set in June 2010.  At that time my daughter was 4 and my son was about to be born.  I figured this would be an excellent set to have in our library and the price was right, so I made the purchase.  In the meantime, before we opened the product, my daughter ended up seeing an episode that had a giant talking pile of garbage, which frightened her, so we kept the unopened product on the shelf for a year until she wasn't freaked out by the idea of watching it again.People who have reviewed this product mention that the packaging is ""terrible.""  Personally I didn't have a problem with the packaging.  The DVDs were all seated in the set correctly; there were no loose discs, no scratches, no problems whatsoever.  We sat down to watch the first disc, and the first episode was flawless.  During episode two, there was a point where the episode froze.  The only way to get past it was to restart the episode and skip scenes until we were past the part that froze up, so we ended up missing about 3-4 minutes of the show in order to skip past it.  Other than that, episode 2 went fine.Episodes 3, 4, and 5 were all very problematic, freezing up many times throughout each episode, and seeming very jittery.  These episodes were completely unwatchable.  As you would expect, I was hoping that the problem was isolated to just the first disc, so we attempted to watch disc two.  We had the very same problem with the first two episodes on disc two also.  Looking at the physical discs themselves, there were NO SIGNS of any damage.  No scratches, no warping, nothing.In the absence of any physical evidence, this narrows things down to 2 key theories:1.  Maybe I have DVD player issues.  We have one player on the 2nd floor, one player on the main floor, and three players in the basement (a standard player, a Sony PS3, and an xbox).  These discs had identical problems on EVERY player in our home, and these players do not have similar issues with other discs.  I tested the discs on the DVD players of friends and family, and everyone had the same problem.  Clearly the problem was with the discs themselves and not with the DVD players involved.2.  Perhaps the set was damaged while in my home.  The set was sitting high on a shelf, in the packaging and untouched, for an entire year.  The family room in my basement is kept at about 66 degrees year round.  It is not humid and the temperature never really changes.  The discs remained correctly seated in the cases.  The shelf is full of other DVDs and blu ray discs, and all of those work fine.  Nothing pointed to any post-purchase damage, but a year had passed so I couldn't really rule it out.Another year and a half passed.  In February 2013, I finally bit the bullet and ordered another NEW set from Amazon.com.  This time I opened it immediately, and yes... you guessed it...  The discs were seated in their cases perfectly (no loose discs, no scratches).  Still, two and a half years after my original purchase, discs 1 and 2 of this set were once again plagued with the same issues.  This time I tested the discs throughout my home and I also brought them to work, and they froze up there too.  I immediately returned the set to Amazon.com and got a full refund.But I still have the original set that I purchased in 2010.  Yes, I can test the remaining discs in the set, and maybe I will find that the problems are isolated to discs 1 and 2.  But the testing process is highly frustrating.  When these discs lock up, they are completely locked.  You cannot just fast-forward past the issue.  You either have to stop the episode and restart from the main menu, or you have to power down the player completely and start over, every single time, and it happens over and over again throughout the episode.  And if the kids are there with you, hoping to watch an episode, forget about it... they're completely miserable throughout the entire process.  Endlessly frustrating for everyone involved.If you do take a chance on making this purchase, open the set immediately and test AT LEAST the first two discs right away.
