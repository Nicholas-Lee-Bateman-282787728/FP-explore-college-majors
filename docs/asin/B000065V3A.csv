700402,A8MZA6YR9UAN9,B000065V3A,,"[8, 8]","This is a little-known Disney movie that is probably one of the studio's best live-action films. This was one of my childhood favorites, and, when I saw it again recently, it became one of my adulthood favorites.The story takes place in the midst of the Great Depression and starts out in Chicago. Natty and her father are struggling to make ends meet, but still manage to love each other and survive. Trouble comes when Natty's father finally gets a job - in Washington. Unable to find Natty to tell her, he leaves her a note and leaves her in the charge of an overbearing boardinghouse owner. Fed up with bad treatment and not wanting to believe that her father abandoned her, Natty sets out to meet up with her father, hopping on trains and hitching rides west. Along the way, she helps free a wolf who is being used in dog fights. She and the wolf meet up later and become companions. Natty also joins up with John Cusack, another drifter looking for work.The movie includes beautiful scenery and an interesting portrayal of Depression-era America. The relationships are also fascinating. For instance, Natty only calls the wolf &quot;wolf,&quot; and still recognizes that he is a wild animal. In other words, she doesn't attempt to make him into a pet. Additionally, her relationship with John Cusack's character is not silly, self-conscious, or filled with expectation.Another reviewer noted that the DVD version of this movie is disappointing. I found the quality of my DVD to be absolutely fine. There are no special features, but the film itself is of decent quality.This is a sweet, fascinating movie that is appropriate for children and adults and should immediately be considered a classic.",5,Endearing story of the Depression,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,1702,"['little-known', 'Disney', 'movie', 'probably', 'one', 'studio', 'best', 'live-action', 'films', 'was', 'one', 'childhood', 'favorites', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'recently', 'became', 'one', 'adulthood', 'favorites.The', 'story', 'place', 'midst', 'Great', 'Depression', 'out', 'Chicago', 'Natty', 'father', 'are', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'still', 'manage', 'love', 'other', 'survive', 'Trouble', 'when', 'Natty', 'father', 'finally', 'job', 'Washington', 'Unable', 'find', 'Natty', 'tell', 'note', 'charge', 'overbearing', 'boardinghouse', 'owner', 'Fed', 'up', 'bad', 'treatment', 'not', 'wanting', 'believe', 'father', 'abandoned', 'Natty', 'out', 'meet', 'up', 'father', 'hopping', 'trains', 'hitching', 'rides', 'west', 'way', 'free', 'wolf', 'who', 'being', 'used', 'dog', 'fights', 'wolf', 'up', 'later', 'become', 'companions', 'Natty', 'also', 'up', 'John', 'Cusack', 'drifter', 'looking', 'work.The', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'Depression-era', 'America', 'relationships', 'are', 'also', 'fascinating', 'instance', 'Natty', 'only', 'wolf', 'quot', 'wolf', 'quot', 'still', 'wild', 'animal', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'make', 'pet', 'Additionally', 'relationship', 'John', 'Cusack', 'character', 'not', 'silly', 'self-conscious', 'filled', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'found', 'quality', 'DVD', 'be', 'absolutely', 'fine', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'decent', 'quality.This', 'sweet', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'children', 'adults', 'should', 'immediately', 'be', 'considered', 'classic']",N/A

Scribbled on them were words such as &quot;Never Ending Story&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Nimh&quot;, &quot;Muppets take Manhatten&quot;, &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Karate Kid&quot;, and &quot;Pinnocchio&quot;. Now, on the same tape, written beneath pinnocchio, and that soap we accidentally recorded once, was this movie, Nattie Gann.When I pulled it from the others, I knew that I was going to cry. I was a soft hearted little bugger back then. (That one Benji with the couger cubs nearly put me in the hospital. Heck, even &quot;hug-a-bunch&quot; made me cry.) But, even as a child I knew what a good movie was. Those were the days when Marty was racing through time, trying to hook up his parents; when your best pals were a couple of Goonies. Nattie, was just another one of the guys, so to speak.Nattie is a tough bird, fighting any boy that crosses her, and puffing cigs in the guy's bathroom. Her dad gets a job when work was hard to come by. The only catch is that its far away. When he leaves her with the sinister &quot;Connie&quot;, Nattie ventures out into the world of the great depression. On her way she befriends the wolf, survives a train crash, and falls in love with a young John Cusack.Even though this release is poor, it may hold you over until Disney wakes up from whatever sleep they are in. I'm not going to totally bash the big D, because they have done some spectacular dvd's, but that doesn't change the matter. If you fervently remember taking the journey along side Nattie Gann when you were younger as I did, or are in search of a great story, begin here.

I saw it in theatres when I was a kid, I bought the VHS when 1st available; I was overjoyed to the point of near misty-eyed-ness when I recieved the DVD from my wife.  TjoNG is one of the reasons I fell in love with wolves & learned to overcome my American cultural ignorance of them.  The movie is the reason I listened more closely to my grandparents tales of the depression; why I stopped thinking depression meant an emotional state & recognized it as an economic problem.  You & your kids can *LEARN* something from this movie, you can enjoy watching it, again & again; there's a marvelous emotional hurrah! throughout the entire story, Disney at it's finest without the clubbed-over-the-head forced-spoon-fed social & morality message & commentary.  The scenery is breathtaking, you kinda think I wish I could go back to then & live in that incredible world.  The music is perfect, nudging & reinforcing without interrupting or annoying.  This is also one of Scatman Caruthers' last roles, doing what he does best; adding a touch of autheniticty that makes our suspension of disbelief effortless.The DVD is a horiffic slap in the face to the theatrical release, the cast, crew & it's *SO* bad it makes the movie look shoddy.  I won't reiterate what the other people so ably & eloquently illustrated of the flaws, I'll just say BUY THE VHS!  if you can't, well, this DVD is better than nothing.Barely.The only reason there're 3 stars is because I was in the theatre on a magical night near to 2 decades ago & I *KNOW* what should have been on this disc.

700408,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000065V3A,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","This is a quietly touching adult film made by Disney long before they had their Touchstone division. Meredith Salanger gives a star-making performance as a teenage girl growing up with her father during the depression. A young John Cusack has a nice turn as well, already showing the kind of quiet and surprising talent he would become known for in coming years.Natty's father (Ray Wise) finds the only work he can during the depression and reluctantly leaves Natty with someone who turns out to have no love or compassion in her heart for anyone but herself. He has gone to Washington to cut trees and leaves a letter promising to send for her, along with a locket containing a picture of her dead mother. But when no word arrives she runs away to find him, riding the rails. Ray Wise gives a fine performance as a loving father forced by the depression to leave the daughter he adores in order to support them both and survive.The great beauty of the Pacific Nortwest is the backdrop for a beautifully filmed and realistic journey of a time and place long gone. It is not the rose-colored journey one might expect from a Disney film, however. The people and places are real and she is met with both kindness and cruelty, including a brief scene when she hitches a ride with a pervert who tries to molest her.She meets Cusak early on in this film and later when their paths cross again they tramp together, feelings for each other beginning to form. Meanwhile, due to a chain of events which causes her father to believe Natty dead, he is devastated and takes a very dangerous job. A wolf becomes Natty's friend and they travel together, looking out for one another. Though this may sound corny, it is handled in a realistic and believable way.When Cusak finds work in California she must continue on to find her father. But there are sweet moments when she writes to him and we hope that somewhere down the line they will be together. There are some truly touching scenes which make this memorable, and an excellent film for parents to enjoy with young adults.

The film could have been so much better because it had so much promise in the story line but the poor acting mixed with bad quality (the picture is grainy and the sound is poor) made for a forgettable experience.  ALSO, I agree with some that this isn't the best choice for family film.  I agree with the age difference between Natty and Harry being kinda creepy..I mean, she's 12 and he was at least 17-18...And the fact that Natty utters cuss words throughout the film is another dissapointment.  The film is a PG Walt Disney film...that should stand for something.

Thus, Touchstone Pictures was born- their first film being Splash!THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN was produced under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, but it quite easily could have been produced by Touchstone Pictures since it goes slightly beyond the regular Disney family fare. Set during the Depression, it tells the story of a teenage girl called Natty Gann (played by Meredith Salenger who would go on to guest star in the second season of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and the fifth season of ""Dawson's Creek""), who travels across America to be reunited with her father, who due to necessary circumstances has had to take a job on the other side of the country. Along the way, Natty is befriended by a Wolf and a fellow traveller (John Cusack of ""Serendipity"".)This movie is what it is. It's not particularly action-oriented, or overly-romantic (a fake kiss between John Cusack and a much younger Meredith Salenger - probably due to various child laws - is towards the end of the picture). The cinematography is excellent and looks natural and beautiful, and the film travels at a nice pace. Being that this movie is what it is, it does a beautiful job at being just that.The DVD has no special features at all, and the film is only broadcast in Dolby (2.0) Surround, but there probably wasn't much extra material made at the time.

700429,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000065V3A,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","This movie is the tale of a young girl separated from her father by need, and how she tries to find him again.  The story will take young Natty Gann into the clutches of the worst of people and the best of people.Natty Gann (Meredith Salenger, in her first movie role) lives with her father in Chicago.  Unfortunately, her father does not have steady employment.  Natty tends to run with a group of kids, and is on the verge of getting into trouble.  One day Natty's father Sol (nicely played by Ray Wise) gets an opportunity for employment in Washington.  Sol tries to find Natty before he leaves, but she is out with her friends.  Sol asks Connie (Lainie Kazan) to watch out for Natty until he can send money for a ticket to Washington.  Connie soon decides that Natty is too much trouble, and she calls the authorities.  Before the authorities can show up, Natty is off to find her father.The rest of the movie is devoted primarily to Natty's travels.  She soon encounters Harry, played by John Cusack.  I am usually lukewarm about John Cusack, but I liked him in this movie.  Cusack convinced me that he was worldly in spite of being very young.  He managed to care without seeming to, which is a difficult trick for any actor.  Natty encounters Harry a couple of times on her journey, and the pair begins a budding romance.Natty also encounters a dog that looks a lot like a wolf.  Natty calls him Wolf.  Jed, the dog that played Wolf, also played the title role in the movie ""White Fang.""  Wolf is Natty's companion almost to the end of the movie.  Wolf manages to get Natty out of trouble several times, and Natty does her best to return the favor.Natty and Wolf make their way from Chicago to Washington, though Natty is not sure where her father is.  Along the way, Natty is placed in a girls' home, a pervert molests her, she rides the rails, gets burned out of a shanty town, resorts to eating garbage, and much more.  Natty's journey is a realistic trip through the depression-era United States.  Of course the journey is scary, but this movie is a Disney movie so the movie is held to a PG level.I missed this movie when it was in the theaters in 1985.  It seems like I was one of many who missed the movie, because it did poorly.  However, this movie has done well on video and DVD because it is a good family movie.  While Natty seems plagued by poor judgment and the ability to encounter shady characters, her goal of reuniting with her father is a perfect central theme for a Disney movie.  It helps that Meredith Salenger, who was about 15-years-old when she portrayed 12-year-old Natty, had the face and character to fill the role of Natty.Though this movie has a PG rating, I think it is suitable family fare for all but the littlest of children, who would likely be bored by the movie, unless beautiful Wolf excites them.  I have seen this movie several times, and consider it one of my favorites when I am looking for an interesting, uplifting story.  I hope you will find it to be a movie that you like too.Enjoy!",4,A Tale of the Being Lost During the Depression,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,3036,"['movie', 'tale', 'young', 'girl', 'separated', 'father', 'need', 'how', 'find', 'again', 'story', 'will', 'take', 'young', 'Natty', 'Gann', 'clutches', 'worst', 'people', 'best', 'people.Natty', 'Gann', 'Meredith', 'Salenger', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'father', 'Chicago', 'Unfortunately', 'father', 'not', 'have', 'steady', 'employment', 'Natty', 'run', 'group', 'kids', 'verge', 'getting', 'trouble', 'One', 'day', 'Natty', 'father', 'Sol', 'nicely', 'played', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'opportunity', 'employment', 'Washington', 'Sol', 'find', 'Natty', 'out', 'friends', 'Sol', 'Connie', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'watch', 'out', 'Natty', 'can', 'send', 'money', 'ticket', 'Washington', 'Connie', 'soon', 'Natty', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'authorities', 'authorities', 'can', 'show', 'up', 'Natty', 'find', 'father.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'devoted', 'primarily', 'Natty', 'travels', 'soon', 'encounters', 'Harry', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'am', 'usually', 'lukewarm', 'John', 'Cusack', 'liked', 'movie', 'Cusack', 'convinced', 'was', 'worldly', 'spite', 'being', 'very', 'young', 'managed', 'care', 'seeming', 'difficult', 'trick', 'actor', 'Natty', 'Harry', 'couple', 'times', 'journey', 'pair', 'budding', 'romance.Natty', 'also', 'dog', 'lot', 'wolf', 'Natty', 'Wolf', 'Jed', 'dog', 'played', 'Wolf', 'also', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'movie', 'White', 'Fang', 'Wolf', 'Natty', 'companion', 'almost', 'end', 'movie', 'Wolf', 'get', 'Natty', 'trouble', 'several', 'times', 'Natty', 'best', 'return', 'favor.Natty', 'Wolf', 'make', 'way', 'Chicago', 'Washington', 'Natty', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'father', 'way', 'Natty', 'placed', 'girls', 'home', 'pervert', 'rails', 'burned', 'shanty', 'town', 'eating', 'garbage', 'much', 'more', 'Natty', 'journey', 'realistic', 'trip', 'depression-era', 'United', 'States', 'course', 'journey', 'scary', 'movie', 'Disney', 'movie', 'movie', 'held', 'PG', 'level.I', 'missed', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', '1985', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'missed', 'movie', 'did', 'poorly', 'However', 'movie', 'done', 'well', 'video', 'DVD', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'Natty', 'plagued', 'poor', 'judgment', 'ability', 'encounter', 'shady', 'characters', 'goal', 'reuniting', 'father', 'perfect', 'central', 'theme', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Meredith', 'Salenger', 'who', 'was', '15-years-old', 'when', 'portrayed', '12-year-old', 'Natty', 'had', 'face', 'character', 'fill', 'role', 'Natty.Though', 'movie', 'PG', 'rating', 'think', 'suitable', 'family', 'fare', 'littlest', 'children', 'who', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'Wolf', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'consider', 'one', 'favorites', 'when', 'am', 'looking', 'interesting', 'uplifting', 'story', 'hope', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'movie', 'like', 'too.Enjoy']",N/A

Meanwhile, when Natty's father is informed of her wallet being found at the scene of a train wreck, he sinks into despair believing she has been killed and takes on the most dangerous jobs at the logging camp. If Natty doesn't find him in time, he's sure to be the next accidental death.""The Journey of Natty Gann"" is a gem of a film coming from the Disney Studios at a time when their live-action features were thoughtful and low on glitter and plastic. Released in 1985, this was the era of Disney films like ""One Magic Christmas,"" ""Never Cry Wolf,"" and ""Flight of the Navigator."" Introducing 80's cutie Meredith Salenger in the title role and John Cusack as the fellow drifter she befriends, ""The Journey of Natty Gann"" does a marvelous job of recreating the world of the Great Depression and truly makes its presence felt throughout the film. The story is touching, beautifully shot, and frequently unpredictable, and the performances are wonderful. You may not like Natty much at the very beginning, but by the end you'll adore her.The DVD release is another matter. Unfortunately, there's nothing really positive I can say about the release, and forget what I said about this film being beautifully shot when you sit down to watch it. It's got bad picture quality, horrible pan and scan, bad audio, zero extras... For something like that to happen to a movie like this is nothing short of a crime! All I can say is, this is a film everyone should have in their video library, but don't pay too much for this edition of it. It really is just like watching a VHS tape. Let's hope a better edition comes along someday, but I picked this one up just in case. Poor quality is better than not having this charming Disney classic at all.Oh, and if you like this Disney film, please seek out other Disney live-action classics.

This is a riveting film that never ceases to entertain. The outstanding and auspicious debut of Meredith Salenger belies her later career, most recently seen in the campy horror flick ""Lake Placid"" in a small role. This is also one of John Cusack's first roles, and he's perfect, as is Ray Wise as Natty's father. The Oscar nominated costumes are period-perfect, as are the sets, convincingly portraying Depression era America. A Widescreen version is sorely missing from the recently released DVD; a lot of period detail was lost. Let's hope someone comes along to correct this gross over-sight. The magnificent vistas of the Pacific northwest, captured by photographer Dick Bush, would also be enhanced by a Widescreen format. The music of James Horner is symphonic at times (reminiscent of the best of Aaron Copland), as it also incoporates folk music and grand,sweeping passages to compliment the adventure that is taking place. The director, Jeremy Kagan, brilliantly kept a flow and consistant feeling of excitement (he won the Golden Prize at the Moscow Film Festival). Episodic as some might think, each episode is woven into the next with care and a fine feel for the narrative at large...a fine example of great editing. This is, quite simply, and all-around excellent film. Tears are bound to flow, but they won't be manipulated; there's genuine pathos in the final development of events, and not sappy, either. As I said, except for the Pan & Scan treatment, the DVD is well presented, though there are no extras. It's OK, though, because the price is more than reasonable. SEE THIS FILM!

It is an unusually forward-looking release from Disney at a time when they were trying to find new audiences.  The approach to storytelling and character is strong, the performances are understated.

One they should be proud of.So, for the life of me, I can't understand why this film only exists in North America as a pan & scan copy.  It's a poor transfer, and the screen ratio HURTS the film, which is full of many wide shots.Do like I did, use the 'contact us' link at Disneystudioshelp dot com page and send them an email telling them you want a widescreen release, a blu-ray, a full restoration!If enough like-minded people email them, maybe it'll start an avalanche.

I saw this film with my parents when I was quite young and remembered it as a powerful and entertaining film about a young teenage girl. I was curious to know if it ""held up"" over the years and was still relevant, so I watched it again in its entirety. I was completely engaged by the story, found Meredeth Salenger to be a very convincing actress in her role of runaway teen girl in the depression searching for her father, and was again moved by her courage and determination. Although it is a family movie and was made with young children in mind, it is not at all boring or trite,and is completely appropriate and relevant for all ages.Movies made for children these days are either cartoons or, I find, overly sappy. Some made-for-kids movies are actually quite violent and I believe inappropriate for young children. Natty Gann is none of these things, and tells a universal story of a gutsy girl on a dangerous journey to be reunited with her father. She forms a very important bond with a wolf while on her journey, and this relationship is a key component of this original screenplay.I totally recommend this film for anyone who wants to be entertained, moved, and reminded of what good quality non-manipulative film making can be.",5,A Timeless story of adventure,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,1338,"['Many', 'reviews', 'Journey', 'Natty', 'Gann', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'wanted', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'saw', 'film', 'parents', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'remembered', 'powerful', 'entertaining', 'film', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'was', 'curious', 'know', 'held', 'up', 'years', 'was', 'still', 'relevant', 'watched', 'again', 'entirety', 'was', 'completely', 'engaged', 'story', 'found', 'Meredeth', 'Salenger', 'be', 'very', 'convincing', 'actress', 'role', 'runaway', 'teen', 'girl', 'depression', 'searching', 'father', 'was', 'again', 'moved', 'courage', 'determination', 'family', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'young', 'children', 'mind', 'not', 'boring', 'trite', 'completely', 'appropriate', 'relevant', 'ages.Movies', 'made', 'children', 'days', 'are', 'either', 'cartoons', 'find', 'overly', 'sappy', 'made-for-kids', 'movies', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'violent', 'believe', 'inappropriate', 'young', 'children', 'Natty', 'Gann', 'none', 'things', 'universal', 'story', 'gutsy', 'girl', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'be', 'reunited', 'father', 'very', 'important', 'bond', 'wolf', 'journey', 'relationship', 'key', 'component', 'original', 'screenplay.I', 'totally', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'entertained', 'moved', 'reminded', 'what', 'good', 'quality', 'non-manipulative', 'film', 'making', 'can', 'be']",N/A
