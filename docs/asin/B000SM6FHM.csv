The FIRM is the only system I use to work out and have been very happy with the results thus far. The only problem I have with this one is that some of the power moves were a little too fast for me to have good form, so I will have to work on that. And the other thing was that some of the cueing was a little too late. But it was an excellent workout and Emily really gets your blood pumping and your sweat pouring while having a good time.

1086656,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000SM6FHM,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[1, 1]","I recently purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and this workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD.  Emily Welsh leads this workout with 4 background exercisers (surprisingly, although Sue-Mi is in the cast, it's Allison who shows modifications) in the Firm's newer set with wood floors and fake windows.  This is a cardio sculpting routine, and Emily cues use of light, medium, and heavy dumbbells (I used 3s, 5s, and 10s).The workout begins with a fairly long (almost 7 minutes) warm-up.  Although the moves themselves are relatively simple--e.g., double side steps, v-steps, low jacks, double taps with squats and rear dips--the choreography is a bit tricky, especially for a warm-up, and I found Emily a little hard to follow at times.  On the other hand, it did get my heart up quickly, so that was good.  Following the warm-up, Emily cues medium weights to move right into squats with shoulder press.  Next is a short front lunge with glute lift/row and then a biceps curl.  Moving onto light weights for shoulder work, Emily starts with a unique move, a plie which adds a twisting delt raise, and then she does a traditional rear delt raise with a bit of a twist (I liked both these exercises!).The first cardio segment comes next (about 4 minutes total).  Again, the moves themselves are pretty simple:  a front-back-front step, a hamstring/knee combo that adds repeaters, and a lunge front with small hops to switch.  This is followed by rear dips with triceps overhead extensions, push-ups, lat rows, wide squats with wide bicep curls, and a second set of push-ups.  For the second cardio segment, Emily starts with a side step, circling the arms and adding a knee up on the end.  She then moves into a squat-front kick-dip combo on each leg and does some plyos; this entire sequence is repeated several times.Emily has you pick up your heavy weights for side lunges with sweeps, but then it's back to the light weights for deadlifts with triceps kickbacks.  This is followed by a walking lunge with a clean and press (forward)/biceps curl (backward) and the final standing move is a ""seesaw"" to work the abs.  Coming to the floor, Emily does a held plank and then goes right into triceps push-ups and chest flies, which concludes the dumbbell work.  She next performs about 2 1/2 minutes of crunch variations for the abdominals.  The final stretch is short (about 2 minutes):  Emily begins on the hands and knees for cat/cow, a calf stretch, a triceps stretch, and a hip flexor lunge, and she moves to standing for hamstring and neck stretches.Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  There were a couple of places where I felt the choreography was a bit unnecessarily complicated and/or where Emily could have cued better, but I liked the fact that my heart rate stayed up the entire time, even through the weight sections, and I found the mostly low-impact cardio segments to be fun.  I would rate this workout as low intermediate, but it would be appropriate for experienced beginners (or even new exercisers following Allison for modifications), and it could be modified up for high intermediates using heavier weights.",4,Overall decent cardio/weights interval workout at a low intermediate level,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,3160,"['recently', 'purchased', 'Firm', 'Ultimate', 'Fat-Burning', 'Collection', 'workout', 'was', 'one', 'four', 'selections', 'included', 'DVD', 'Emily', 'Welsh', 'workout', '4', 'background', 'exercisers', 'surprisingly', 'Sue-Mi', 'cast', 'Allison', 'who', 'modifications', 'Firm', 'newer', 'set', 'wood', 'floors', 'fake', 'windows', 'cardio', 'sculpting', 'routine', 'Emily', 'cues', 'use', 'light', 'medium', 'heavy', 'dumbbells', 'used', '3s', '5s', '10s', '.The', 'workout', 'fairly', 'long', 'almost', '7', 'minutes', 'warm-up', 'moves', 'are', 'relatively', 'simple', 'e.g.', 'double', 'side', 'steps', 'v-steps', 'low', 'jacks', 'double', 'taps', 'squats', 'rear', 'dips', 'choreography', 'bit', 'tricky', 'especially', 'warm-up', 'found', 'Emily', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'get', 'heart', 'up', 'quickly', 'was', 'good', 'Following', 'warm-up', 'Emily', 'medium', 'weights', 'move', 'right', 'squats', 'shoulder', 'press', 'Next', 'short', 'front', 'lunge', 'glute', 'lift/row', 'then', 'biceps', 'curl', 'Moving', 'light', 'weights', 'shoulder', 'work', 'Emily', 'unique', 'move', 'plie', 'twisting', 'delt', 'raise', 'then', 'traditional', 'rear', 'delt', 'raise', 'bit', 'twist', 'liked', 'exercises', '.The', 'first', 'cardio', 'segment', 'next', '4', 'minutes', 'total', 'Again', 'moves', 'are', 'pretty', 'simple', 'front-back-front', 'step', 'hamstring/knee', 'combo', 'repeaters', 'lunge', 'front', 'small', 'hops', 'switch', 'followed', 'rear', 'dips', 'triceps', 'overhead', 'extensions', 'push-ups', 'lat', 'rows', 'wide', 'squats', 'wide', 'bicep', 'curls', 'second', 'set', 'push-ups', 'second', 'cardio', 'segment', 'Emily', 'side', 'step', 'circling', 'arms', 'adding', 'knee', 'up', 'end', 'then', 'squat-front', 'kick-dip', 'combo', 'leg', 'plyos', 'entire', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'several', 'times.Emily', 'pick', 'up', 'heavy', 'weights', 'side', 'lunges', 'sweeps', 'then', 'back', 'light', 'weights', 'deadlifts', 'triceps', 'kickbacks', 'followed', 'walking', 'lunge', 'clean', 'press', 'forward', 'curl', 'backward', 'final', 'standing', 'move', 'seesaw', 'work', 'abs', 'Coming', 'floor', 'Emily', 'held', 'plank', 'then', 'right', 'triceps', 'push-ups', 'chest', 'flies', 'dumbbell', 'work', 'next', 'performs', '2', '1/2', 'minutes', 'crunch', 'variations', 'abdominals', 'final', 'stretch', 'short', '2', 'minutes', 'Emily', 'hands', 'knees', 'cat/cow', 'calf', 'stretch', 'triceps', 'stretch', 'hip', 'flexor', 'lunge', 'standing', 'hamstring', 'neck', 'stretches.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'were', 'couple', 'places', 'where', 'felt', 'choreography', 'was', 'bit', 'unnecessarily', 'complicated', 'and/or', 'where', 'Emily', 'could', 'have', 'cued', 'better', 'liked', 'fact', 'heart', 'rate', 'stayed', 'up', 'entire', 'time', 'even', 'weight', 'sections', 'found', 'mostly', 'low-impact', 'cardio', 'segments', 'be', 'fun', 'would', 'rate', 'workout', 'low', 'intermediate', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'experienced', 'beginners', 'even', 'new', 'exercisers', 'following', 'Allison', 'modifications', 'could', 'be', 'modified', 'up', 'high', 'intermediates', 'using', 'heavier', 'weights']",The Firm: Burn and Shape

Emily's cuing isn't quite as good as someone like Kari Anderson or Amy Dixon, but it's not too hard to follow along with.You get alternating intervals of weights and cardio and you can always do some movement variations to make it a little tougher if you want to.  When it comes to the cardio, it's not overly dancy so that portion is easy to follow (cuing could again be a bit better).  I like how with the toning, you begin with basic moves and add on different muscles to maximise the effect and your heart rate stays up which is good for the burning fat and calories.This is a pretty good workout that I've only done twice so far, but I enjoy it and think many people can gain benefits from this.

1086666,A13700AF4X40YG,B000SM6FHM,Loves Books in MD,"[10, 10]","This had all the makings of a Firm routine that I expected to like - approx. 44 minutes and my knees were delighted there was no use of the ever present Fanny Lifter - so I was a little surprised when I found I didn't.I found the warm-up and initial warm-up to be complicated, especially given their apparent fixation with moving to the side. That would have provided a little more of a learning curve and may have even prevented boredom if the cueing hadn't been so dreadful. Unfortunately, Emily wouldn't tell you what steps were going to be done until you were supposed to be doing them.Examples of the poor cueing would be that if you're doing lunges, you'd have no idea whether to alternate legs or which leg would lead. You would be told to do an arm lift, but you'd have to watch to see that they were doing it in two parts - lift halfway up and then the rest of the way up. Many times you'd be told how to angle an arm lift, that you should do two quick movements instead of one or that you were going to do a move in two parts after the first one was done. As you can imagine, this made it very difficult to follow and felt very herky-jerky.I don't expect to be able to anticipate every move or follow along flawlessly with a new routine, but this workout is a prime example of why people often dislike trying a new DVD. I use a wide variety of workouts and anything overly complicated or difficult to nail down doesn't make the cut because it's impossible to learn and retain a complex routine that I may only use every few weeks. I will often feature 3 or 4 workouts for a period of time and alternate a wide variety of others on the remaining 2-3 days of the week, but I found this one so annoying that I am glad I borrowed it from Netflix and didn't buy it. I may try it one more time before returning it, but I don't recommend this for anyone looking for a simple, straightforward, easy to learn routine. Definitely not recommended for beginners, lest they think all exercise is this difficult to learn.I recommend The Firm's Total Body Toner with Allie Del Rio Pointer as the instructor if you're looking for a well cued workout that doesn't use the fanny lifter in this era of The Firm's DVD distribution.",2,Marred by Poor Cueing,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2221,"['had', 'makings', 'Firm', 'routine', 'expected', 'like', 'approx', '44', 'minutes', 'knees', 'were', 'delighted', 'was', 'use', 'ever', 'present', 'Fanny', 'Lifter', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'when', 'found', ""didn't.I"", 'found', 'warm-up', 'initial', 'warm-up', 'be', 'complicated', 'especially', 'given', 'apparent', 'fixation', 'moving', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'little', 'more', 'learning', 'curve', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'prevented', 'boredom', 'cueing', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'dreadful', 'Unfortunately', 'Emily', 'would', ""n't"", 'tell', 'steps', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'done', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'them.Examples', 'poor', 'cueing', 'would', 'be', ""'re"", 'doing', 'lunges', ""'d"", 'have', 'idea', 'alternate', 'legs', 'leg', 'would', 'lead', 'would', 'be', 'told', 'do', 'arm', 'lift', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'were', 'doing', 'two', 'parts', 'lift', 'up', 'then', 'rest', 'way', 'up', 'Many', 'times', ""'d"", 'be', 'told', 'how', 'angle', 'arm', 'lift', 'should', 'do', 'two', 'quick', 'movements', 'instead', 'one', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'move', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'done', 'can', 'imagine', 'made', 'very', 'difficult', 'follow', 'felt', 'very', 'herky-jerky.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'able', 'anticipate', 'move', 'follow', 'along', 'flawlessly', 'new', 'routine', 'workout', 'prime', 'example', 'why', 'people', 'often', 'dislike', 'trying', 'new', 'DVD', 'use', 'wide', 'variety', 'workouts', 'anything', 'overly', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'nail', 'down', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'impossible', 'learn', 'retain', 'complex', 'routine', 'may', 'only', 'use', 'few', 'weeks', 'will', 'often', 'feature', '3', '4', 'workouts', 'period', 'time', 'alternate', 'wide', 'variety', 'others', 'remaining', '2-3', 'days', 'week', 'found', 'one', 'so', 'annoying', 'am', 'glad', 'borrowed', 'Netflix', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'may', 'try', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'returning', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'easy', 'learn', 'routine', 'Definitely', 'not', 'recommended', 'beginners', 'lest', 'think', 'exercise', 'difficult', 'learn.I', 'recommend', 'Firm', 'Total', 'Body', 'Toner', 'Allie', 'Del', 'Rio', 'Pointer', 'instructor', ""'re"", 'looking', 'well', 'cued', ""n't"", 'use', 'fanny', 'lifter', 'era', 'Firm', 'DVD', 'distribution']",The Firm: Burn and Shape

While Emily seems to be a good instructor (Cardio Sculpt Fusion aka Total Body Lite), this DVD outright is terrible. Her cueing is subpar, especially in the warmup. There were a lot of step touches, pivots, punch punches, etc. She only goes slow a couple of times, then ramps up the speed like a guinea pig on acid. The strength training is okay, but doing the lunge/row/overhead press combo was tough on my back, plus she was never specific on what leg to be using. So I just alternated legs.  Her cardio was okay, nothing exciting. I had to modify some of the bouncing around. The ab work was probably my favorite- a variety of moves in different positions. I enjoyed the standing ab work as well.  Overall this video was sub par, especially if you have two left feet and have trouble keeping up with all the step changes.

Emily is so cute. Her upbeat personality keeps me focused.The outfits are cool, too. Alison's reminded me of early Britney Spears.If you want a fast, fun and efficient workout, I say grab a copy.

1086671,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B000SM6FHM,T. Carr,"[1, 1]","First off, this was my first FIRM workout. I know many people are die-hard FIRM fans and many reviews here come from these said fans. I thought I'd give a ""newbie"" opinion.I am very coordinated. I used to be a serious dancer, and I've taken aerobic and step classes, so I am familiar with terminology. Having said that, I don't think ANYONE could follow the cardio choreography the first time through this dvd. I eventually caught on and was able to complete the workout, but many times I found myself stumbling over my feet, unsure where to go next or missing a move. The cuing is very poor and the instructor's method of repeating moves before going back to the beginning or moving on is erratic and changes throughout. For example, she might show a new move, do it twice and then go back to an earlier move (but you're not sure which one she's going back to). Then on the next new move she may repeat it four times then add on another new step, which she'll do once before going back to yet another different spot. The warmup was the hardest part to follow, and should have been the easiest. Having said all of that, I was able to get through the workout without stopping. It was just far from perfect. I assume it will get much easier each time I do the dvd.I did like that it went back and forth between cardio segments and toning segments. However, it all was (physically, if not mentally) quite simple and I didn't work up much of a sweat. I found myself modifying a lot of the toning work or using much heavier weights to get a bigger benefit out of it. And I didn't find it to be very enjoyable. I typically do hour long workouts so this was even shorter than most I do, but I found myself continuously looking at the clock. I think this was mostly due to the instructor more so than the actual work being done. I didn't care for her personality and she seemed very amateur to me. Not that she seemed incompetent, it just felt more like a workout some random girl decided to film at home rather than a true professional with lots of experience teaching and in front of the camera. I know many others like her personality; it just didn't jive with me. And I like lots of different types of personalities with workout instructors (e.g. Jillian Michaels, Sara Ivanhoe, Kari Anderson... all very different)My review sounds harsh but I still give it 3 stars. If I can get past my less than enthusiastic reaction to the instructor, learn the choreography and add more weight/intense modifications, it's a worthwhile workout. Still better than a lot of what's out there... just not the best there is.UPDATE: The second time I did this workout I didn't struggle NEARLY as much with following along. I may have just had an off-day that first time. Her cuing could definitely be better and her # of repetitions is sporadic but it's not as difficult to follow as I made it seem. I enjoyed it more the second time around too. I still wouldn't purchase this on its own but it makes the purchase ofThe Firm: Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, which includes this plus 3 other FIRM workouts, much more worth-while.",3,"Somewhat challenging to follow, not too intense",1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,3106,"['First', 'off', 'was', 'first', 'FIRM', 'workout', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'die-hard', 'FIRM', 'fans', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'come', 'said', 'fans', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'newbie', 'opinion.I', 'am', 'very', 'coordinated', 'used', 'be', 'serious', 'dancer', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'aerobic', 'step', 'classes', 'am', 'familiar', 'terminology', 'Having', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ANYONE', 'could', 'follow', 'cardio', 'choreography', 'first', 'time', 'dvd', 'eventually', 'caught', 'was', 'able', 'complete', 'workout', 'many', 'times', 'found', 'stumbling', 'feet', 'unsure', 'where', 'go', 'next', 'missing', 'move', 'cuing', 'very', 'poor', 'instructor', 'method', 'repeating', 'moves', 'going', 'back', 'beginning', 'moving', 'erratic', 'changes', 'example', 'might', 'show', 'new', 'move', 'do', 'twice', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'earlier', 'move', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'going', 'back', 'Then', 'next', 'new', 'move', 'may', 'repeat', 'four', 'times', 'then', 'add', 'new', 'step', ""'ll"", 'do', 'once', 'going', 'back', 'yet', 'different', 'spot', 'warmup', 'was', 'hardest', 'part', 'follow', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easiest', 'Having', 'said', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'workout', 'stopping', 'was', 'just', 'far', 'perfect', 'assume', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'do', 'dvd.I', 'did', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'cardio', 'segments', 'toning', 'segments', 'However', 'was', 'physically', 'not', 'mentally', 'quite', 'simple', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'up', 'much', 'sweat', 'found', 'modifying', 'lot', 'toning', 'work', 'using', 'much', 'heavier', 'weights', 'get', 'bigger', 'benefit', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'typically', 'do', 'hour', 'long', 'so', 'was', 'even', 'shorter', 'most', 'do', 'found', 'continuously', 'looking', 'clock', 'think', 'was', 'mostly', 'due', 'instructor', 'more', 'so', 'actual', 'work', 'being', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'personality', 'seemed', 'very', 'amateur', 'Not', 'seemed', 'incompetent', 'just', 'felt', 'more', 'workout', 'random', 'girl', 'decided', 'film', 'home', 'rather', 'true', 'professional', 'lots', 'experience', 'teaching', 'front', 'camera', 'know', 'many', 'others', 'personality', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'jive', 'like', 'lots', 'different', 'types', 'personalities', 'workout', 'instructors', 'e.g', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'very', 'different', 'review', 'harsh', 'still', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'reaction', 'instructor', 'learn', 'choreography', 'add', 'more', 'weight/intense', 'modifications', 'worthwhile', 'workout', 'Still', 'better', 'lot', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'is.UPDATE', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'struggle', 'NEARLY', 'as', 'much', 'following', 'along', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'off-day', 'first', 'time', 'cuing', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'better', 'repetitions', 'sporadic', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'made', 'seem', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'too', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'own', 'purchase', 'ofThe', 'Firm', 'Ultimate', 'Fat-Burning', 'Collection', '3', 'other', 'FIRM', 'much', 'more', 'worth-while']",The Firm: Burn and Shape
