1184106,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B001DZOC64,A. Estes,"[0, 1]","While the original ""Joy Ride"" was a classy, suspenseful and stylish film, its direct-to-DVD sequel, ""Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead,"" goes more for the gore and cheap thrills, playing as sort of a cross between the first film and films like ""Hostel"" which derive much of their horror from placing their characters in excruciatingly uncomfortable situations.In the original film, we had characters we cared about, who found themselves at odds with an unstable trucker known only by the handle Rusty Nail after a seemingly innocent prank. Here, the characters -- as cardboard as you would expect from a cash-in sequel -- seem to be making as many poor decisions as they can at every turn and are just begging to be a part of Rusty's game. Rusty himself, who has been re-cast from Ted Levine to Mark Gibbon, comes across less-human than before and seems to have an even meaner streak. Here, the attempt is made to cast Rusty Nail as some sort of franchise villain, worthy of carrying future films on his back, but unfortunately, the film adds nothing new to the character's mythology or motivations. He's just a mean guy who can't be reasoned with.In spite of its flaws and the fact that it can't hold a candle to the original, ""Dead Ahead"" gets a pass for delivering some decent thrills and for attempting to milk some tension in its final act. Also, the actors seem to be trying to deliver more than just the stereotypes they were written as, and for that, they should be commended. For the most part, it works, and to be honest, there have been much, much worse direct-to-DVD sequels in recent memory. It's also a bit tough to follow-up such a strong act as the first, so with that in mind, you'll be able to turn off your brain and enjoy a ride with ""Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead.""",3,There's Some Joy in This Ride (2.5 stars),1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1768,"['original', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'was', 'classy', 'suspenseful', 'stylish', 'film', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequel', 'Joy', 'Ride', '2', 'Dead', 'Ahead', 'more', 'gore', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'playing', 'sort', 'cross', 'first', 'film', 'films', 'Hostel', 'derive', 'much', 'horror', 'placing', 'characters', 'excruciatingly', 'uncomfortable', 'situations.In', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'characters', 'cared', 'about', 'who', 'found', 'odds', 'unstable', 'trucker', 'known', 'only', 'handle', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'prank', 'Here', 'characters', 'as', 'cardboard', 'would', 'expect', 'cash-in', 'sequel', 'seem', 'be', 'making', 'many', 'poor', 'decisions', 'can', 'turn', 'are', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'part', 'Rusty', 'game', 'Rusty', 'who', 'been', 're-cast', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Mark', 'Gibbon', 'less-human', 'before', 'have', 'even', 'meaner', 'streak', 'Here', 'attempt', 'made', 'cast', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'sort', 'franchise', 'villain', 'worthy', 'carrying', 'future', 'films', 'back', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'character', 'mythology', 'motivations', 'just', 'mean', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'reasoned', 'with.In', 'spite', 'flaws', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'Dead', 'Ahead', 'pass', 'delivering', 'decent', 'thrills', 'attempting', 'milk', 'tension', 'final', 'act', 'Also', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'deliver', 'more', 'just', 'stereotypes', 'were', 'written', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'most', 'part', 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequels', 'recent', 'memory', 'also', 'bit', 'tough', 'follow-up', 'such', 'strong', 'act', 'first', 'so', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'Joy', 'Ride', '2', 'Dead', 'Ahead']",Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead

They leave a note explaining their problem and that they are borrowing the car so they can get help after which they will return the car and pay for the damages on the house.The problem is the house is owned by a long haul trucker who just happens to like killing people and has no sense of humor. He just happens to get home just an hour or so after the kids leave. He hunts them down, kidnapping one from a truck stop rest room, and forces the others to perform humiliating and increasingly harmful acts to try and get their friend back.These sort of `coincidence' are common for this genre but the fact the kids go along with this is the breaking point for me.  Usually they are in the middle of nowhere and don't know where the bad guy comes from. In this they are at a truck stop surrounded by other people, telephones etc and no matter how bad a light you cast on what they did, grand theft auto, the trucker in kidnapping has gone right to a capital crime and they know where his house is! That's when you go back into the diner and call the police asap! But do they? Nope. Do you point out these facts and let him know that if your friend isn't back there in 5 minutes the police will be at his house in 10? Nope. They increasingly go along with his demands. After a while you start to feel it's an argument for Darwinism because people this dumb shouldn't survive.Cast, direction, blocking, sound, light, cinematography are all top marks.

And when they took it, they of course had to fish tail it down the road to see what it could do.  For the four young people in this movie that 'borrowed' the car I could sum up no sympathy what so ever.  Maybe they did not deserve what they got but they sure weren't some group of innocents.  On the other hand, how much did ole Rusty Nail care for his car?  After all, he does destroy it later in the film.  By the way after he destroys his car, you can clearly see that the left side of his truck is smashed in with the headlight busted out and then a few seconds later the truck is without a scratch and the headlight is working perfectly.  Hmmm.  Continuity problem?  Speaking of continuity, Bobby gets his kneecap busted in one scene and a moment later, he's all over the pain, rolling the dice again and then a few minutes later, he's limping across the desert.  What???  Anyway, despite unlikable characters who are dumber than dirt, this movie is okay for an hour and a half of mindless torture.  My real problem with this film is the way the four young people just did what they were told.  The finger?  Shoot, I would have seen through that one.  Melissa's little striptease in front of the truck?  Okay, at least the explanation for that made some kind of sense, I guess, but would anyone actually do that?  Sending Nik into the trucker's playground in drag?  Why not just cut his throat and throw him out of the car and get it over with?  What were they thinking?  Finally, my last problem with 'JOY RIDE 2' is the way Melissa handled that truck in the end.  She jumped in that rig and drove it like she'd been a trucker for 20 years.  Shoot, I would have had a hard time figuring out how to start a rig like that let alone drive it like a pro.  At least she has career potential ahead of her as a driver.  As far as the acting goes:  Well, you really don't pick up these type of movies for the great performances, but over all the cast actually did pretty well, especially Nicki Aycox as Melissa.  The bottom line is, this:  You could do worse.  This movie is not great and does not pretend to be great.  There are some scenes that will make you a little uneasy and make you squirm, but all in all, not a total waste of an hour and a half.  By the way, as other reviewers have already pointed out, there obviously is a sequel coming down the highway.

1184128,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B001DZOC64,Negative Comments,"[5, 8]","It's been almost a year since I wrote my last movie review. I just sort of lost the motivation. It would take a movie so bad that I would have no choice but to castigate all involved in said film, and it's Joy Ride 2 that has this dubious honor.Story: Four idiots break down on the road, they break into a house, steal a car, after which the psychotic owner kidnaps one of them, and the rest of the movie is based on them trying to recover their friend.Although I've seen plenty of bad movies in the past year, I'm not sure if any one of those had the combination of being this flagrantly bad in terms of BOTH acting and writing. Usually it's a combination of both, where one aspect might be pretty bad, while the other only makes you want to kill yourself just a little bit. This pile of trash is literally at the lowest end of the scale for both acting and writing, and here are some reasons:**As a bad writing example, the fact that the main girl left her number for the owner after they stole the car. If anything, she should've left a note saying they'd return the car as soon as they could, and apologize. Since this is basically the catalyst to jumpstart the movie, I'll let this pass.**Bad acting by the main girl after she runs into the parking lot after learning her boyfriend is kidnapped. In general, her dialogue and emotion didn't fit- at times where she should've been panicked and desperate, she comes across sounding angry, wrong choice. By the way, when her cell phone rang in this scene, why did she answer ""Bobby are you OK?"" as if there were any chance that it would even BE Bobby on the other line? She just got done talking to the kidnapper, why is she assuming it's her boyfriend that would be calling?**I don't see how that emo dude should've so confidently talked trash about truckers in a diner FULL OF THEM. Also, I thought it was unrealistic how the two girlfriends were sort of going along with the emo dude's insults about the truckers, just smiling. It came across like they genuinely thought it was funny, most girls would've told him to shut up and get his act together.**In that strip tease scene, when she approached the truck assuming that Rusty Nails was behind the wheel, when the decoy shows his face, her reaction is just..all wrong. Yes, WE as the audience are taken by surprise that it's not the actual kidnapper and instead it's some hillbilly retard, but HOW DOES SHE KNOW?? Why did she immediately come to the conclusion that they'd been tricked and he wasn't the actual kidnapper? And the way she screamed ""Bobby"" was worse than Darth Vader's ""noooooo.""**The scene I hated most was when the emo dude was chosen to dress up in a wig and dress, and the way the main girl went into movie clich&eacute; 'badass' mode to convince him to do so. After he refuses, she puts a scalpel to his neck and calmly tells him what he needs to do. Any other emotion would've been fine, she could've acted hysterical by screaming at him to please do what the kidnapper says, cry, panic, act desperate, but for her to calmly and confidently tell him in the stereotypical low voice that he's GOING to do this, made me want to kill her myself.**When the emo dude gets captured, and the two girls are watching, who's holding who back? WTF were they doing? Girl #1 acts like she wants to go run to him, only to be held back by Girl #2, but then Girl #2 is now trying to run towards him, only to be held back by the Girl #1. Who's holding who back? WTF was this?? I can only imagine what the director must've told them to do in this scene (""yeah, just act panicked and stuff, that's all I've got."")**After the main girl's sister got killed in the collision, she had NO EMOTION. Ridiculous.**When they had the two captured guys in Rusty's shed, how coincidental was it for the emo's favorite game to be craps, since Rusty's wall was covered with the consequences for each dice roll outcome. So what if he would've said his favorite game was Monopoly or something?**Again, not something I can criticize too much since every movie is guilty of it, but when the main girl knocks out Rusty with the shovel, of course she doesn't make sure he's out cold or dead, she just throws her shovel away.**Along with death and taxes, here's something else that's guaranteed; I can guarantee that during the scene where Rusty was on top of the truck, anyone watching that scene was thinking the same thing: ""Hit the brakes!""**In this same scene, it was nighttime when he was on top of the truck, then early daytime when he was inside. OK, so she must've drove throughout the night right? Well how the HELL did her boyfriend show up seconds later after she jumped out of the careening vehicle? That's gotta be miles that he would've hobbled on one leg, OVERNIGHT. Nevermind the fact that he appeared seemingly within seconds.**I'm gonna give this movie the benefit of the doubt and assume that the ridiculous ending line where the boyfriend asked ""is it over,"" as she looks heroically over the cliff and kicks the wallet and says ""it is now,"" was tongue in cheek. I really, REALLY hope this was meant to be campy and not a serious scene.**It's ridiculous that they made this trucker into an omnipotent supernatural demigod, being able to see your every move, come in and out of cars without being seen, and able to survive crashing in an exploding semi going over a cliff.My god, that main girl is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and that's saying a

The main character is asked to cut off her sister's finger [because she flipped Rusty ""the bird""] and offer it to Rusty to get reunited with her boyfriend.  The plot gets worse as Rusty asks the characters to perform ding-a-ling tasks [the main character has to strip to her underwear in the headlight beams of Rusty's truck; male character has to dress as a prostitute and parade in front of truckers].  Although these tasks are based on plot points, I lost empathy for the characters [and whether or not they survived] as they continued to perform brainlessly for Rusty in hopes of being reunited with the main character's boyfriend.Chopping off your sister's finger, stripping off your clothes in the glow of a Mack truck's headlights, and parading yourself in drag before a seemingly hostile group of truckers [intent on partying and drag racing]..well...it's just silly.The first Joy Ride was very well done and this sequel is as banal as it is insipid.View at your own risk!",2,So-so.,1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,1440,"['acting', 'good', 'cinematography', 'good', 'plot', 'however', 'unbelievable', 'stranded', 'twenty-somethings', 'break', 'Rusty', 'Nails', 'home', 'borrow', 'car', 'leave', 'note', 'phone', 'number', 'advise', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'will', 'return', 'car', 'pay', 'damage', 'Rusty', 'home.Rusty', 'home', 'finding', 'car', 'missing', 'home', 'broken', 'stalks', 'teenagers', 'one', 'males', 'main', 'character', 'boyfriend', 'main', 'character', 'asked', 'cut', 'off', 'sister', 'finger', '[', 'flipped', 'Rusty', 'bird', ']', 'offer', 'Rusty', 'get', 'reunited', 'boyfriend', 'plot', 'worse', 'Rusty', 'characters', 'perform', 'ding-a-ling', 'tasks', '[', 'main', 'character', 'strip', 'underwear', 'headlight', 'beams', 'Rusty', 'truck', 'male', 'character', 'dress', 'prostitute', 'parade', 'front', 'truckers', ']', 'tasks', 'are', 'based', 'plot', 'points', 'lost', 'empathy', 'characters', '[', 'not', 'survived', ']', 'continued', 'perform', 'brainlessly', 'Rusty', 'hopes', 'being', 'reunited', 'main', 'character', 'boyfriend.Chopping', 'off', 'sister', 'finger', 'stripping', 'off', 'clothes', 'glow', 'Mack', 'truck', 'headlights', 'parading', 'drag', 'seemingly', 'hostile', 'group', 'truckers', '[', 'intent', 'partying', 'drag', 'racing', ']', '..well', 'just', 'silly.The', 'first', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'sequel', 'as', 'banal', 'insipid.View', 'own', 'risk']",Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead

1184132,AQRODCIYD7PYX,B001DZOC64,"Robert F. Powers ""show maniac""","[7, 9]","The thrills and adrenaline-pumping excitement in the original Joy Ride begins when two brothers play a cruel prank on a seemingly love-lorn trucker named Rusty Nail. The rest of the movie is a roller coaster ride with a slam bang finale and a twisty ending.The new movie Joy Ride 2 centers on two couples heading for Las Vegas.  One of the guys suggest they use a back road because it's shorter(damn  the old ""let's use the back road"" cliche)  Naturally their car breaks down and they start walking and remember- they are on a deserted back road.  They eventually come across a seemingly deserted house and shed.  They break into the house find nothing useful then inspect the shed where they find a wall loaded with nasty looking implements and do find a lovingly restored sports car which they reason they will ""borrow"" until they find a rental in the next town and return the sports car.  One of the girls leaves contact information for the owners if they return(stupid, stupid girl) Of course this is a horror movie and the owner turns out to be--yes you guessed right--it's Rusty Nail.The balance of the movie is sadism, mutilation and some rather gruesome death scenes.  One poor soul has his entire jawbone ripped from his face(not shown) but you do get to see the jawbone -teeth and all. The metal rod through the top of the head through the chin is gross(but i saw a similar scene in a 1980's horror flick-The Prowler)  The movie has a lot of tense moments but unlike the first movie the tense scenes are sadistic and bloody while the first movie the thrills and tense moments were more from chase scenes with the maniacal Rusty and his truck.  The movie is worth a watch but it will make you squirm.One piece of advice...Never give Rusty Nail the finger unless you are not fond of five digits on each hand.",3,HANGING BY A RUSTY NAIL,1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,1816,"['thrills', 'adrenaline-pumping', 'excitement', 'original', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'when', 'two', 'brothers', 'play', 'cruel', 'prank', 'seemingly', 'love-lorn', 'trucker', 'named', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'rest', 'movie', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'slam', 'bang', 'finale', 'twisty', 'ending.The', 'new', 'movie', 'Joy', 'Ride', '2', 'centers', 'two', 'couples', 'heading', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'One', 'guys', 'suggest', 'use', 'back', 'road', 'shorter', 'damn', 'old', 'let', 'use', 'back', 'road', 'cliche', 'Naturally', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'start', 'walking', 'remember-', 'are', 'deserted', 'back', 'road', 'eventually', 'come', 'seemingly', 'deserted', 'house', 'shed', 'break', 'house', 'find', 'nothing', 'useful', 'then', 'inspect', 'shed', 'where', 'find', 'wall', 'loaded', 'nasty', 'looking', 'implements', 'do', 'find', 'lovingly', 'restored', 'sports', 'car', 'reason', 'will', 'borrow', 'find', 'rental', 'next', 'town', 'return', 'sports', 'car', 'One', 'girls', 'contact', 'information', 'owners', 'return', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'girl', 'course', 'horror', 'movie', 'owner', 'out', 'be', 'yes', 'guessed', 'right', 'Rusty', 'Nail.The', 'balance', 'movie', 'sadism', 'mutilation', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'death', 'scenes', 'One', 'poor', 'soul', 'entire', 'jawbone', 'ripped', 'face', 'not', 'shown', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'jawbone', '-teeth', 'metal', 'rod', 'top', 'head', 'chin', 'gross', 'saw', 'similar', 'scene', '1980', 'horror', 'flick-The', 'Prowler', 'movie', 'lot', 'tense', 'moments', 'first', 'movie', 'tense', 'scenes', 'are', 'sadistic', 'bloody', 'first', 'movie', 'thrills', 'tense', 'moments', 'were', 'more', 'chase', 'scenes', 'maniacal', 'Rusty', 'truck', 'movie', 'watch', 'will', 'make', 'squirm.One', 'piece', 'advice', 'Never', 'give', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'finger', 'are', 'not', 'fond', 'five', 'digits', 'hand']",Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead

Once again, someone has committed an affront, and ticked him off, and now there will be hell to pay.On their way to Vegas to get hitched, Melissa (Nicki Aycox) and her fianc&eacute; Bobby (Nick Zano), are joined by Melissa's sister Kayla (Laura Jordan), and her new boyfriend Nik (Kyle Schmid), when their car dies in the middle of nowhere.  The group break into an empty house, and ""borrow"" a car.  Unfortunately the vehicle belongs to Rusty Nail, and he strikes quickly, abducting Bobby at truck stop and holding him a captive on the floor of his truck.  The group is then forced to do whatever Rusty says, to get him back.  The trucker has an uncanny ability to anticipate what his prey may do.  Guided by a macabre sense of humor, he enjoys tormenting and humiliating his victims, until he decides it is time for them to die.Joy Ride 2 lacks the charm, warmth and innocence, of the original Joy RIde, which developed a special relationship among the victims, before Rusty Nail began his quest for revenge.  You still don't get a clear look at Rusty, and a different actor is doing his voice, but he still has a thing for CB radio, and his CB handle is the only way he is identified.  In the first film, Rusty was the victim of a cruel prank, who in the heat of the moment, might have been pushed too far.  In the sequel, it is clear that the man is a sadistic psycho, with a history of deranged, violent behavior.  Darker and more mean spirited, matters escalate to a wild unrealistic finish in the desert, that leaves the door open to Rusty Nail's return.",3,Joy Ride 2: don't mess with Rusty's wheels . . .,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,1776,"['Joy', 'Ride', '2', 'Dead', 'Ahead', '2008', 'sequel', 'Joy', 'Ride', '2001', 'further', 'adventures', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'Mark', 'Gibbon', 'homicidal', 'trucker', 'who', 'administering', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'sadistic', 'justice', 'Once', 'again', 'someone', 'committed', 'affront', 'ticked', 'off', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'hell', 'pay.On', 'way', 'Vegas', 'get', 'hitched', 'Melissa', 'Nicki', 'Aycox', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Bobby', 'Nick', 'Zano', 'are', 'joined', 'Melissa', 'sister', 'Kayla', 'Laura', 'Jordan', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Nik', 'Kyle', 'Schmid', 'when', 'car', 'dies', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'group', 'break', 'empty', 'house', 'borrow', 'car', 'Unfortunately', 'vehicle', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'quickly', 'abducting', 'Bobby', 'truck', 'stop', 'holding', 'captive', 'floor', 'truck', 'group', 'then', 'forced', 'do', 'Rusty', 'get', 'back', 'trucker', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'anticipate', 'what', 'prey', 'may', 'do', 'Guided', 'macabre', 'sense', 'humor', 'tormenting', 'humiliating', 'victims', 'time', 'die.Joy', 'Ride', '2', 'charm', 'warmth', 'innocence', 'original', 'Joy', 'RIde', 'developed', 'special', 'relationship', 'victims', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'began', 'quest', 'revenge', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'clear', 'look', 'Rusty', 'different', 'actor', 'doing', 'voice', 'still', 'thing', 'CB', 'radio', 'CB', 'handle', 'only', 'way', 'identified', 'first', 'film', 'Rusty', 'was', 'victim', 'cruel', 'prank', 'who', 'heat', 'moment', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'sequel', 'clear', 'man', 'sadistic', 'psycho', 'history', 'deranged', 'violent', 'behavior', 'Darker', 'more', 'mean', 'spirited', 'matters', 'escalate', 'wild', 'unrealistic', 'finish', 'desert', 'door', 'open', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'return']",Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead
