Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed.""Jeff (Jake Johnson from ""New Girl""), an assistant editor for a magazine  convinces his editor to let him and his two interns Arnau and Darius (Aubrey Plaza from ""Parks and Recreation"") try and find the person who placed the ad as there might be something there about which an article can be written.  She agrees.It turns out he has an ulterior motive, his old girl friend lives there and he wants to see if you can go home again.  One of many subplots, this adds depth but is not the main focus of the film.  They find the author of the ad, but he spots the assistant editor as a ringer right away.  They then send in the incredibly withdrawn intern Darius and in an unconventional way, they bond.Although the question of whether or not he can build a time machine is answered, I'm not going to reveal that here.  That's OK; you see, It Doesn't Matter.  This is not a movie about time travel.  It's about what happens to all these people in the process of finding out.I can't say enough good about this film.  Well acted, well directed, good story, the whole thing.  I can say that almost everyone will be thoroughly delighted.  Sometimes hilarious, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes joyful, sometimes philosophical, always charmingly offbeat, this movie is a unique treasure.I also can't say enough about what a pleasant surprise this movie is.  It grossed less than $4 million so far, it's not the ""Dark Knight"" after all, so there is a whole world out there that hasn't yet experienced this gem.  Become one of them.  This is HIGHLY recommended.A recommendation:  Get the DVD vs. the Blu-Ray.  This is a small indie film, and neither the video nor the audio are going to benefit that much from Blu-Ray.  So, as long as they do a decent DVD transfer (and if they don't it's unlikely they'd be able to afford to do so on the Blu-Ray), I wouldn't endorse the 25% surcharge for Blu, especially given how well players upscale DVDs.",5,A Joy of a Movie,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2143,"['ad', 'paper', 'Wanted', 'Somebody', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'not', 'joke', ""'ll"", 'get', 'paid', 'get', 'back', 'Must', 'bring', 'own', 'weapons', 'have', 'only', 'done', 'once', 'before', 'Safety', 'not', 'guaranteed', 'Jeff', 'Jake', 'Johnson', 'New', 'Girl', 'assistant', 'editor', 'magazine', 'editor', 'let', 'two', 'interns', 'Arnau', 'Darius', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'try', 'find', 'person', 'who', 'placed', 'ad', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'there', 'article', 'can', 'be', 'written', 'agrees.It', 'out', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'old', 'girl', 'friend', 'there', 'see', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'One', 'many', 'subplots', 'depth', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'find', 'author', 'ad', 'assistant', 'editor', 'ringer', 'right', 'away', 'then', 'send', 'incredibly', 'withdrawn', 'intern', 'Darius', 'unconventional', 'way', 'bond.Although', 'question', 'not', 'can', 'build', 'time', 'machine', 'answered', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'here', 'OK', 'see', ""n't"", 'Matter', 'not', 'movie', 'time', 'travel', 'what', 'all', 'people', 'process', 'finding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'film', 'Well', 'acted', 'well', 'directed', 'good', 'story', 'whole', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'almost', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'delighted', 'Sometimes', 'hilarious', 'sometimes', 'bittersweet', 'sometimes', 'joyful', 'sometimes', 'philosophical', 'always', 'charmingly', 'offbeat', 'movie', 'unique', 'treasure.I', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'what', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'movie', 'grossed', 'less', '4', 'million', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'whole', 'world', 'there', ""n't"", 'yet', 'experienced', 'gem', 'Become', 'one', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended.A', 'recommendation', 'Get', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'small', 'indie', 'film', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'going', 'benefit', 'much', 'Blu-Ray', 'So', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'decent', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'do', ""n't"", 'unlikely', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'do', 'so', 'Blu-Ray', 'would', ""n't"", 'endorse', '25', '%', 'surcharge', 'Blu', 'especially', 'given', 'how', 'well', 'players', 'upscale', 'DVDs']",N/A

1547708,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0087ITAHG,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","For a film that was hyped and buzzed as incredibly unique and special, `Safety Not Guaranteed' didn't win me over like I wanted it to.  Outside of the fantastic cast, I really didn't find this to be all that engaging, unique or special.  At the end of the day, it was marginally funny and only occasionally insightful, and if it weren't for Aubrey Plaza's exceptional blend of dead pan comedic chops and tender reserved emotional temperance the film probably would have fallen apart completely.  I'm all for the quirky indie, but this just didn't seem to pair well with what it was promising.It felt cheap.Plaza, Johnson, Duplass and Soni make the most of their roles and try really hard to make this film draw you in, but Derek Connolly's script just isn't up to par.  It isn't that he doesn't carve out a moving finale and `reveal', but the way he actually goes about etching out that development is just not quite `there'.  Basically, this follows a team of journalists who are investigating an ad placed in the paper looking for something to go back in time with a disturbed man named Kenneth.  Jeff takes the story because he wants to hook up with an ex-girlfriend, and he takes Darius (who wants to go for more personal reasons) and Arnau with him as assistants.  Darius becomes the guinea pig as she's sent to persuade Kenneth to take her on his journey with him.  Of course, all isn't as black and white as it seems and Darius begins to fall for Kenneth and put faith in his claims and, well, if you decide to watch this then I'll leave the ending a surprise.My issue is that it just doesn't always connect tonally.  It feels like a poorly constructed television show most of the time, with the gags landing slowly and the action awkwardly slapstick in a way that feels off kilter with the direction of the film.  Still, Plaza is really, really good here and so I hate to say `skip it' when her performance is that special.  She's got a major career ahead of her.If you like quirky indie comedies with heart then I'm sure you've already seen this or at least contemplated it.  I love them too, but this one didn't do it for me.",3,Satisfaction not guaranteed...,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,2135,"['film', 'was', 'hyped', 'buzzed', 'incredibly', 'unique', 'special', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'wanted', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'engaging', 'unique', 'special', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'marginally', 'funny', 'only', 'occasionally', 'insightful', 'were', ""n't"", 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'exceptional', 'blend', 'dead', 'pan', 'comedic', 'chops', 'tender', 'reserved', 'emotional', 'temperance', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'completely', ""'m"", 'quirky', 'indie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pair', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'promising.It', 'felt', 'cheap.Plaza', 'Johnson', 'Duplass', 'Soni', 'make', 'most', 'roles', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'film', 'draw', 'Derek', 'Connolly', 'script', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'carve', 'out', 'moving', 'finale', 'reveal', 'way', 'actually', 'etching', 'out', 'development', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'Basically', 'team', 'journalists', 'who', 'are', 'investigating', 'ad', 'placed', 'paper', 'looking', 'something', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'disturbed', 'man', 'named', 'Kenneth', 'Jeff', 'story', 'hook', 'up', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Darius', 'who', 'go', 'more', 'personal', 'reasons', 'Arnau', 'assistants', 'Darius', 'guinea', 'pig', 'sent', 'persuade', 'Kenneth', 'take', 'journey', 'course', ""n't"", 'black', 'white', 'Darius', 'fall', 'Kenneth', 'put', 'faith', 'claims', 'well', 'decide', 'watch', 'then', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'ending', 'surprise.My', 'issue', 'just', ""n't"", 'always', 'connect', 'tonally', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'television', 'show', 'most', 'time', 'gags', 'landing', 'slowly', 'action', 'awkwardly', 'slapstick', 'way', 'kilter', 'direction', 'film', 'Still', 'Plaza', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'here', 'so', 'hate', 'say', 'skip', 'when', 'performance', 'special', 'got', 'major', 'career', 'ahead', 'her.If', 'quirky', 'indie', 'comedies', 'heart', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'least', 'contemplated', 'love', 'too', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'do']",N/A

It's just awesome when you go into a theater for a film with no expectations for it to be as good as it ends up being. Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) is one of those rare theatrical treats. It just blew my mind at how fun and heartfelt it was considering its humble roots. It's a real testament to the power and potential of indie filmmaking in this day and age when the democratization of filmmaking is better than its ever been. Jus as the poster promises, if you liked Little Miss Sunshine (2006), then you'll probably dig this one. Not because the stories are similar, but because they're both filled with quirky and interesting characters that are on personal journeys.Written by Derek Connolly and directed by Colin Trevorrow, Safety Not Guaranteed is the first feature film for both. And they really hit a home run (or at least a triple) with this one. The writing is superb with realistic dramatic dialog paired with great comedic punches. I laughed, I cried and really connected with the story on an emotional level. And of course that's in large part due to the phenomenal acting from Mark Duplass, Aubrey Plaza, Jake Johnson, and Karan Soni. The chemistry and camaraderie is just spectacular among these actors. They pulled off a story that in the hands of lesser actors, could go wrong really quickly.With beautiful cinematography, good production design, solid editing and music that helps emphasize the story without overpowering it, Safety Not Guaranteed is guaranteed to take you away into a story that's both believable and unbelievable. I really don't want to say anymore because most of the fun of this film is knowing nothing going in.

When I saw that the NY Times had given it a star as being a notable film, I decided to give it a try.  It turned out to be much better than I expected.  There is some very funny snappy dialogue, especially in the first half.  Then there is the underlying suspense of whether the central character will turn out to be for real, or a possibly-dangerous mental case.  But in addition, there are half a dozen characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs.

1547713,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0087ITAHG,C. Sawin,"[3, 3]","There are times that even as a film critic with the endless amount of films that you see, hear about, and look into by word of mouth; some are bound to fly under the radar. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was one of those films. The little independent comedy had quite the reputation after being shown at SXSW a few months ago, so it was obviously a film that was worth looking out for. But you get caught up in the mainstream releases, especially this time of year. ""Prometheus,"" ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" ""Brave,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" all within seven weeks of each other among many others in between. This is definitely a year where smaller releases can slip through the cracks incredibly easily, but make it a point not to miss such a great little gem like ""Safety Not Guaranteed.""Darius (Aubrey Plaza, ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"") is slightly cynical and pessimistic, but also incredibly realistic. She's trying to turn her life around by finding a new job to make it on her own. So far she's coming up short. Interning for a magazine company isn't exactly working out for her until the day Kenneth's (Mark Duplass) peculiar wanted ad is brought up by one of the writers named Jeff (Jake M. Johnson) in a meeting as an idea for an article. Oddly enough, Kenneth is looking for someone to accompany him as he travels through time. As Jeff, Darius, and Arnau (Karan Soni), the other intern assigned to the project, prepare to write an article on a delusional madman, they fail to foresee that this assignment will change each one of them by the time it's all over.The film feels very indie as soon as it begins. The soundtrack is written and performed by Ryan Miller, but has this Arcade Fire type of feel to it. What actually came to mind was ""Wake Up"" from the ""Where the Wild Things Are"" soundtrack. It's mostly just this really solid indie rock that puts you in a better mood just listening to it. The humor is very dry, but also very smart and usually capitalizes on awkward situations; think ""Little Miss Sunshine."" There are some really memorable and funny one-liners in the film, as well. ""You're dangling my vagina out there like bait,"" is a personal favorite, but, ""There's no sense in nonsense, especially when the heat is hot,"" packs more of a punch.Beneath the thick layer of comedy is a lot of really personal stuff for every main character. What's fantastic about ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is that not only does it touch base on what makes these characters flawed, what drives them, or what the reason for their quirks is, but the film also gives each of their story arcs the appropriate amount of time. It does seem like there could have been a bit more to both Jeff's and Arnau's side stories, but overall it's very fulfilling.""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is charming, laugh-out-loud funny, and unpredictable; basically all the things a unique indie comedy like this should be.

1547715,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0087ITAHG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Back in 1997, John Silveira would write a joke classified ad for Backwoods Home Magazine asking for people to accompany him to time travel.  Who knew that over a decade later, that joke would inspire a film titled ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", directed by Colin Trevorrow (""Reality Show"", ""Home Base"") and written by Derek Connolly.Executive produced by the Duplass brothers, actor Mark (""The Puffy Chair"", ""Humpday"", ""Cyrus"") and writer Jay (""Baghead"", ""Cyrus"", ""They Puffy Chair""), the film was created with a budget of $750,000 dollars and the independent film would earn over $3 million in the box office.""Safety Not Guaranteed"" would star Aubrey Plaza (""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"", ""Parks and Recreation"" ""Funny People""), Jake Johnson (""21 Jump Street"", ""New Girl"", ""No Strings Attached""), Karan Soni (""Worst.Prom.Ever"", ""1600 Penn""), Mary Lynn Rajskub (""24&#8243;, ""Julie and Julia"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"") and Kristen Bell (""Veronica Mars"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""When in Rome"").VIDEO:""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  While the majority of the outdoor scenes are outdoors, colors are well-saturated for those scenes, showcasing good detail.  But there are some scenes that were shot in low-light in which we see a lot of noise start to creep up.  But for the most part, picture quality for ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" looks good on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is primarily a dialogued-driven track, so much of the HD audio is front and center-channel driven.  There are not many scenes with crowds either, so the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for the film.  There is probably one scene in the film that involves Kenneth's creation that utilizes the surround channels but for the most part, it's a film that is primarily dialogue-driven with some scenes with music which are crystal clear!Subtitles are in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES""Safety Not Guaranteed"" comes with the following special features:A Movie Making Mission - (15:16) Interviews with the cast and crew about the film and how the film became a reality.The Real Ad Behind the Movie - (2:19) A short featurette of how the joke classified ad would inspire an actual film being created.EXTRAS:""Safety Not Guaranteed"" comes with a UltraViolet code that allows you to stream or download the film for your iOS or Android smart phone or tablet.JUDGMENT CALL:I have learned from watching low-budget films that have some connection to the Duplass brothers, that sometimes they are able to create entertaining films with a low budget.  And with ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", working with director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly, they were able to craft a time travel film, but not so much about the time travel but focused on character relationships.And for a film to be based on relationships, it all comes down to the audience believing the characters.  And for ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", this is where casting really makes a big difference in the film.Aubrey Plaza is the right person to play the disillusioned character, Darius.  And in some way, she kind of reminds me of the popular animated character ""DARIA"" (a popular animated cartoon from the '90s that was shown on MTV) in behavior and mentality, and made me wonder if Darius was inspired by the character.But the film required for Darius to be this person that is silent and you really can't figure out because she seems like the quiet type.  So, whenever she does speak, sometimes the words that come out of her mouth is just fun and so sarcastic.  I really enjoyed watching her character.And Mark Duplass as Kenneth.  Another character just as unpredictable as Darius.  Part of you feels that this guy is totally delusional and possibly crazy.  But there is that little part of you that hopes that maybe he has created an actual time machine.And while the film does focus primarily on Darius and Kenneth, the writers give the audience some breathing room and introduce other relationships.  For the character of Jeff, he's a man who wants to hook up with his high school girlfriend and then you have computer nerd Arnau.  Arnau is a very nice guy, but there is no way he is ever going to get close to Darius and because of his meek character, Jeff feels so bad that he wants to get Arnau to loosen up and maybe hook him up with a woman.So, these four characters are pretty fun to watch throughout the film.  You also get a few scenes with Mary Lynn Rajskub (from ""24&#8243;) as Jeff's editor and also a brief scene with actress Kristen Bell.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality for this low-budget film is good, as with the lossless audio.  And there are two special features included.Overall, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is an entertaining film because the unpredictable nature of its storyline and characters.  As the film revolves around one man wanting people to travel in time with him, the concept is so ridiculous that you feel that maybe that Kenneth is crazy.  Or is he?""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is definitely a rare treat!  It may not be a perfect film but it's a comedy that will surely entertain you thanks to the performances by Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass and its far-out storyline.",4,"""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","It isn't every day that you stumble across a film that convincing straddles two genres (and, no, I'm not talking about how a `thriller' can also be a `drama,' people!).  In fact, I'd say that it's very rare for there to be a motion picture that, successfully, combines traditional elements of the romantic comedy and science fiction.  However, SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED posits a small corner of a much larger world where time travel may indeed be possible, and the man who has the smarts to make it happen is little more than a grocery store clerk with the ability to think and dream big.  That, and the guy knows how to write a great classified ad!(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to my last paragraph for the final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Darius (played with lovingly droll conviction by Aubrey Plaza) is an intern struggling to make ends meet financially in her job at a Seattle-based magazine.  One of the writers, Jeff (Jake Johnson), stumbles across a curious personals ad - one that promises a trip through time - that his boss believes might have the makings of a great feature article, so Darius and Arnau (Karan Soni) agree to accompany him on the business trip to investigate Kenneth (Mark Duplass), the ad's author.  As it turns out, Darius slowly becomes smitten with her once-elusive subject, and, when it appears that Ken is actually being tailed by government agents, she's forced to consider the unthinkable: could his ability to travel through time be real?SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is one of those films that probably played somewhere theatrically, but I never saw it.  I don't think I even saw it advertised!  And that's a shame when pure dreck along the lines of TRANSFORMERS 3 played simultaneously on something like a jillion screens.  The fact that no one really invested in substantial dollars in marketing it is another tragedy in itself, especially given the fact that it's been nominated for several independent spirit awards and won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at 2012's Sundance Festival.  (Yes, I know award nominations and wins aren't always indicative of audience appreciation, but multiple nominations is usually a good thing, no?)Director Colin Trevorrow keeps screenwriter Derek Connolly's script moving in all the right directions as he put his players to their marks.  There are several stories at work beneath the main plot - are Kenneth and Darius star-crossed lovers who don't know it yet? - and I'd be remiss in not mentioning how well they all gel together in the mix:(A) Initially, Jeff took the writing assignment because he learned a really hot girl from his high school days might be available for a new hook-up; little did he know what was in store for him.(B) Arnau is making his way peacefully through life, never doing anything the remotely resembles recklessness; little did he know what was in store for him.(C) Kenneth seeks to go back in time in order to correct something grievous from his past, a fix that might lead him to newfound love; little did he know what was in store for him.It's this charming intersection of all these players on their respective journeys that kinda/sorta taps into enough comic but emotional energy.  The talent is perfectly cast in roles that, while they may not be perfect, require only finding and hitting the right notes.  Still, there are plenty of surprises and just enough twists and turns to make SAFETY into something special in all the right ways.  Under director Trevorrow's watchful eye, this talented ensemble makes the best of some quirky moments, ultimately proving that - with even the help of science - true love prevails.SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is produced by Big Beach Films and Duplass Brothers Productions.  As for the technical specifications, the image and sound quality are exceptional.  Sadly, the disc has no special features - shame on you, filmmakers!  Shame on you!!!  This smaller sci-fi romance is exactly the kind of film that deserves a few glances behind-the-scenes.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I don't normally like romantic comedies (so sue me!), but nearly all of SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED worked just fine.  (Of course, the picture has a wonderful undercurrent of contemporary quirkiness and science fiction which didn't hurt it at all.)  Aubrey Plaza is nothing short of a delight as a romantic lead; Jake Johnson is winning as the journalist/yuppie who self-destructs the nearer he gets toward authentic emotional connections; Karan Soni squeezes some wonderfully sublime moments out of his minimal screen time as a lovestruck intern; and Mark Duplass as the would-be/could-be time traveler manages to create just enough manic intensity for an audience to believe he just might know what he's talking about ... or not.",4,SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED Is A Rare Gem Of Rom-Com Genius,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,4994,"[""n't"", 'day',

Thankfully director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly decided to skip much of the pretense of indie cinema and go straight for the heart, mind and funnybone with SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED. Also thankfully, they got the right people for the right parts. Aubrey Plaza (who I honestly have only ever seen in SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, but left a wonderful impression), Mark Duplass and Jake Johnson are all superb in this very brisk indie rom-com which will restore your faith in film's power to inspire.I can't say too much about this film that hasn't already been said, particularly in the Amazon Editorial Review, which hits every point on why this film is so special with unfailing accuracy. The relationship between Plaza and Duplass's characters is never something that feels telegraphed. You never know from one moment to the next what's going to happen between the two of them. Also nice is not bogging the film down at all in over-reaching for the ""science"" of the time-travel device that Kenneth (Duplass) is creating. In fact, we never really hear a word about it, other than Kenneth's need for lasers (which leads to one of the funniest sequences of the whole film) and how his calculations are ""frickin' spot-on"".SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is not necessarily just a catchy title based on a potentially-unsettling part of the want-ad that Kenneth leaves, but it's how we go through life and love and how nothing is either safe or guaranteed, but sometimes, you just have to take someone's hand on faith, and it might lead you to heartache caused by the person you've always dreamed of, but it also might lead you to the person you never expected.4.5/5 stars.

You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.""Who would think this joke an editor of Backwoods Home Magazine put in his magazine would spread to popular culture and end up as the plot of an extremely low budget and independent film called Safety Not Guaranteed. I doubt John Silveira the editor who posted the joke ever did. To be honest I had never heard of the magazine add before until I learned about this film, and I had never heard of this film until I saw the article at IGN called 20 Great Movies You Might Have Missed in 2012. I saw the film title, the synopses and the trailer and something about all of that drew me to this great film and I watched it over the weekend. Who knew a film based on a joke article and a nonexistent budget would turn in to such a great film, and Safety Not Guaranteed is a great film.The film is really short at only around one hour and twenty five minutes long, so I shouldn't have to give to many details about the plot. Of course you know the basic plot line of the film with copy of the add I posted above. Jeff Schwensen (Jake M. Johnson) a journalist a Seattle, WA heads to an sea side town called Ocean View along with two interns Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) to investigate and interview the man who posted the add. The story concentrates on disillusioned pessimist Darius who doesn't expect anything good out of life. When we first meet her she's interviewing for a job at a restaurant, but is too honest and doesn't get the job. She ends up at a magazine and heads to Ocean View with Jeff and Arnau. There she finds Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass) the man behind the add, and she follows him where Kenneth works at a local grocery store. These three don't expect anything from this trip as Jeff really came to look up his old girlfriend from his teenage years and don't really take Ken seriously, but as Darius goes undercover with Ken they form a bond and she begins to realize Ken is serious and what he says might be true. Wow a film with an actual original plot. This is the first film I've seen with a premise or plot like this and it works. Is the plot perfect? No it's not. I thought the character Arnau was out of place and wasn't developed well, and some might find the film boring. There are no great special effects you'd expect from a time travel film, and really the time travel elements aren't really important in the scheme of things it's about the characters and growth and experience throughout the film. The only real scene is the climax where Darius and Ken escape on their time machine boat.The small cast is led by Aubrey Plaza who has mainly found a career doing independent films and guest appearances on TV shows. Aubrey brings Darius to life perfectly displaying her hopelessness with life in her eyes and face and how they slowly come to life throughout the film and her dealing with Ken. Jake Johnson I think is probably best known for his role on the Fox comedy New Girl. Jake plays the slacker Jeff perfectly as he finds he wants more in life after he meets his ex-Liz. Mark Duplass along with Aubrey steal the film. From what I've learned about Mark he's an actor, writer, director and producer who's done mainly independent and low budget films. Along with acting in this film he also produced it. As an actor Mark gives real depth to Ken and gives a really engaging performance. Probably the best known actor or actress in the film is Kristen Bell in a minor role. I remember when there was such praise for the actress with role Veronica Mars that was supposed to lunch the actress to major stardom, and has seemed to have fallen off the radar.Is this film for everyone no I don't think so. The film has a really low budget that might be only around half a million. Also the time travel elements aren't important and only really make an appearance with the great and moving ending. I can understand some might find this gem of a film boring and uninteresting, but it's not. Safety Not Guaranteed is a heartwarming comedy of trying to find meaning and purpose along with an actually original plot, some minor sci-fi elements, great acting and good characters. I highly recommend everyone at least give this overlooked low budget film a try.",5,A jouney of discovery and growth that becomes a hidden Sci-fi gem.,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,4419,"['Wanted', 'Somebody', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'not', 'joke', 'P.O', 'Box', '91', 'Ocean', 'View', 'WA', '99393', ""'ll"", 'get', 'paid', 'get', 'back', 'Must', 'bring', 'own', 'weapons', 'Safety', 'not', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'only', 'done', 'once', 'before', 'Who', 'would', 'think', 'joke', 'editor', 'Backwoods', 'Home', 'Magazine', 'put', 'magazine', 'would', 'spread', 'popular', 'culture', 'end', 'up', 'plot', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'film', 'called', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'doubt', 'John', 'Silveira', 'editor', 'who', 'posted', 'joke', 'ever', 'did', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'magazine', 'add', 'learned', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'saw', 'article', 'IGN', 'called', '20', 'Great', 'Movies', 'Might', 'Have', 'Missed', '2012', 'saw', 'film', 'title', 'synopses', 'trailer', 'something', 'drew', 'great', 'film', 'watched', 'weekend', 'Who', 'knew', 'film', 'based', 'joke', 'article', 'nonexistent', 'budget', 'would', 'turn', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'great', 'film.The', 'film', 'really', 'short', 'only', 'one', 'hour', 'twenty', 'five', 'minutes', 'long', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'many', 'details', 'plot', 'course', 'know', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', 'film', 'copy', 'add', 'posted', 'Jeff', 'Schwensen', 'Jake', 'M.', 'Johnson', 'journalist', 'Seattle', 'WA', 'sea', 'side', 'town', 'called', 'Ocean', 'View', 'two', 'interns', 'Darius', 'Britt', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'Arnau', 'Karan', 'Soni', 'investigate', 'interview', 'man', 'who', 'posted', 'add', 'story', 'disillusioned', 'pessimist', 'Darius', 'who', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'good', 'life', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'interviewing', 'job', 'restaurant', 'too', 'honest', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'up', 'magazine', 'heads', 'Ocean', 'View', 'Jeff', 'Arnau', 'Kenneth', 'Calloway', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'man', 'add', 'where', 'Kenneth', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'three', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'trip', 'Jeff', 'really', 'came', 'look', 'up', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'teenage', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'Ken', 'seriously', 'Darius', 'undercover', 'Ken', 'form', 'bond', 'realize', 'Ken', 'serious', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'Wow', 'film', 'actual', 'original', 'plot', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'premise', 'plot', 'plot', 'perfect', 'No', 'not', 'thought', 'character', 'Arnau', 'was', 'place', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed', 'well', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'boring', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'effects', ""'d"", 'expect', 'time', 'travel', 'film', 'really', 'time', 'travel', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'important', 'scheme', 'things', 'characters', 'growth', 'experience', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'scene', 'climax', 'where', 'Darius', 'Ken', 'escape', 'time', 'machine', 'small', 'cast', 'led', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'who', 'mainly', 'found', 'career', 'doing', 'independent', 'films', 'guest', 'appearances', 'TV', 'shows', 'Aubrey', 'Darius', 'life', 'perfectly', 'displaying', 'hopelessness', 'life', 'eyes', 'face', 'how', 'slowly', 'come', 'life', 'film', 'dealing', 'Ken', 'Jake', 'Johnson', 'think', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Fox', 'comedy', 'New', 'Girl', 'Jake', 'slacker', 'Jeff', 'perfectly', 'more', 'life', 'ex-Liz', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Aubrey', 'steal', 'film', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'Mark', 'actor', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'who', 'done', 'mainly', 'independent', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'acting', 'film', 'also', 'produced', 'actor', 'Mark', 'real', 'depth', 'Ken', 'really', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Probably', 'best', 'known', 'actor', 'actress', 'film', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'minor', 'role', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'such', 'praise', 'actress', 'role', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'was', 'supposed', 'lunch', 'actress', 'major', 'stardom', 'seemed', 'have', 'fallen', 'off', 'radar.Is', 'film', 'everyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'film', 'really', 'low', 'budget', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'million', 'Also', 'time', 'travel', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'important', 'only', 'really', 'make', 'appearance', 'great', 'moving', 'ending', 'can', 'understand', 'might', 'find', 'gem', 'film', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'heartwarming', 'comedy', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'actually', 'original', 'plot', 'minor', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'great', 'acting', 'good', 'characters', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'least', 'give', 'overlooked', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'try']",N/A

1547729,A1RPJHUVVSI98A,B0087ITAHG,Justin Opinion,"[7, 10]","This film played only in select cities and theatres, but this little indie film is almost sure to make bigger stars of the cast. Everyone in the film played their roles very well, creating fun and interesting (and sometimes dis-likeable) characters. The script was very well written, and the plot takes a new twist on the often used concept of time travel.Jeff, a lazy and immature magazine writer (Jake Johnson) finds a personal add in a newspaper that he thinks would make the basis for an investigative story. The ad is someone seeking a partner for time travel, with the catchphrase ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". In truth, Jeff really just wants to visit the area of the ad writer for personal reasons and to shirk his job - so he takes two young interns with him, Darius (Aubrey Plaza of NBC's Parks and Recreation) and Arnau (Karan Soni), who wind up doing all the work and investigating the story.Turns out, the writer of the newspaper ad, Kenneth (Mark Duplass) is working in a local grocery store and lives in a cabin in the woods. He's an oddball character, and you'll wonder whether he is a quiet genius or simply a nut case. Because Darius (Plaza) is assigned to 'get close to him', we see some really nice interaction between the characters and what could be a budding romance. Soni and Johnson provide most of the comedy, with Johnson slowly maturing a bit and becoming less than a one dimensional character.I won't divulge anything about the ending or key plot points, because it's better to enjoy them in the film. I had the privilege of seeing a special screening of Safety Not Guaranteed that was attended by Aubrey Plaza, and was able to meet her. Had it not been for that opportunity, I probably would not have seen the film, since it played in such limited release.I highly recommend this brilliant little indie film that combines good writing, good directing, captivating plot, and great casting and acting.

1547731,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B0087ITAHG,King of Controversy,"[0, 0]","Spoilers below. . .The film seemed slightly off to me but since it's 'low budget' we'll call it offbeat and quirky, which it is. In the extra footage the director mentions that the characters start off as stereotypes and then we learn more about them as the movie goes along.The male romantic lead, Kenneth Calloway (played by Mark Duplas), claims he can time travel and is looking for a partner to go along with him. A local female reporter posing as a social outcast, Darius Britt (played by Aubrey Plaza), promises to go along with him. What she wants to do is write a story for 'Seattle Magazine'. The two are both misfits of a sort and they bond as the movie progresses. The film focuses on the backgrounds of Darius and her boss at the magazine, Jeff Schwensen (played by Jake Johnson) so they feel like real people. The time traveler however, and what he is really up to, is something of a mystery for us to wonder about. Where is the film headed?Kenneth 'trains' for his next time travel journey by running, doing calisthenics, and practicing shooting in the woods. He mentions that he wants to go back in time because his ex-girlfriend was killed by a stalker who runs his car into her house. When the reporter tracks down the woman in question it turns out she's still alive but that it is Kenneth who had a crush on her and drove his car into her house (no deaths or anything). When confronted about this he says, 'great it (the time travel) must have worked'. Kenneth is the picture book of the kind of guy women's magazines advise readers to avoid. Everything in his life is a red flag, not the least of which is his belief that he can travel in time. When she tells her boss, 'the guy could kill me or something'. He replies, 'good then it will be a better story'. One reviewer called Kenneth 'a wanna be unibomber', another 'part of the tin-foil hat and black helicopter crowd'. This is just a guy that no one should like, and perhaps the kind of guy we've been trained to dislike, yet the film makes him likable and in fact the reporter falls in love with him. In this sense the movie is fantasy or a kind of escapism. Perhaps most films are. Another review notes that Kenneth falls in love with her too, but like a typical guy, doesn't know it himself until the very end of the play.In the extra footage, the actor who plays her boss at the magazine, Jake Johnson, says, 'I play a guy who's kind of a douche bag but we can see he does have some good qualities'. At least Aubrey's boss at the magazine is honest in the film. Poet Maya Angelou claimed that the most important virtue is courage because without courage one cannot practice any other virtue consistently. Perhaps it's courage which allows his character to be so honest. The characters honestly does help with the exposition of the movie. How much are these characters like real reporters for a magazine? How 'lazy' is this movie. I don't know. There's a funny scene where Aubrey and Kenneth rob a tech company of some laser equipment. After the movie, for some reason, I thought of Patty Hearst. If you're a reporter working on a story you can get away with anything and generally with good conscience. Almost anything.There's nothing really about time travel in the movie. There are three romances portrayed in the movie: Aubrey's relationship with Kenneth. Her boss trying to reconnect with an old flame (and in fact at one point in the film 'time travel' is meant to be a metaphor for revisiting this relationship, but just at one point, the film doesn't continue in this direction). A third romance is between a male intern reporter, who is portrayed as likely a virgin, and a young girl they meet. Both love affairs take, or appear to take, time to develop. In the final love affair their boss just sits the two youngsters beside each other, and leaves. The young couple begin kissing before, presumably, doing it. I've noticed, in these romances, it always seems that whoever is together in the movie, they'll have an affair. In real terms this would mean you should have an affair with the boy who sits beside you in school. Perhaps this (what seems like is happening) is done because of film length concerns. Maybe I'm old fashion, or a supporter of patriarchy, or a chauvinist, but personally, I would like to one day marry a woman who is a virgin. To be honest, I'd also like to have sex, marriage or not, or even if I never marry. . .There's very little about time travel in the movie. When Kenneth's ear starts to fall off (he has a false ear) at the restaurant, it did make me wonder, a little bit, where the movie was going. Perhaps this wonder makes the time travel part seem more believable? It turns out the film doesn't really contain any science fiction, at least until the end of the movie when, surprise, we see his time travel machine and learn it works. Aubrey and Kenneth just vanish and that's the end of this good natured and feel good movie. If there was something more in the film that did credibly suggest the time machine was real, and would work, I missed it.",4,going to call this a fantasy.,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,5069,"['Spoilers', '.The', 'film', 'seemed', 'slightly', ""'low"", 'budget', ""'ll"", 'call', 'offbeat', 'quirky', 'extra', 'footage', 'director', 'mentions', 'characters', 'start', 'off', 'stereotypes', 'then', 'learn', 'more', 'about', 'movie', 'along.The', 'male', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Kenneth', 'Calloway', 'played', 'Mark', 'Duplas', 'can', 'time', 'travel', 'looking', 'partner', 'go', 'along', 'local', 'female', 'reporter', 'posing', 'social', 'outcast', 'Darius', 'Britt', 'played', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'go', 'along', 'What', 'do', 'write', 'story', ""'Seattle"", 'Magazine', 'two', 'are', 'misfits', 'sort', 'bond', 'movie', 'film', 'backgrounds', 'Darius', 'boss', 'magazine', 'Jeff', 'Schwensen', 'played', 'Jake', 'Johnson', 'feel', 'real', 'people', 'time', 'traveler', 'however', 'what', 'really', 'up', 'something', 'mystery', 'wonder', 'Where', 'film', 'headed', 'Kenneth', 'next', 'time', 'travel', 'journey', 'running', 'doing', 'calisthenics', 'practicing', 'shooting', 'woods', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'ex-girlfriend', 'was', 'killed', 'stalker', 'who', 'car', 'house', 'When', 'reporter', 'down', 'woman', 'question', 'out', 'still', 'alive', 'Kenneth', 'who', 'had', 'crush', 'drove', 'car', 'house', 'deaths', 'anything', 'When', 'confronted', ""'great"", 'time', 'travel', 'must', 'have', 'worked', 'Kenneth', 'picture', 'book', 'kind', 'guy', 'women', 'magazines', 'advise', 'readers', 'avoid', 'Everything', 'life', 'red', 'flag', 'not', 'least', 'belief', 'can', 'travel', 'time', 'When', 'boss', 'guy', 'could', 'kill', 'something', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'story', 'One', 'reviewer', 'called', 'Kenneth', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'unibomber', ""'part"", 'tin-foil', 'hat', 'black', 'helicopter', 'crowd', 'just', 'guy', 'one', 'should', 'like', 'perhaps', 'kind', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trained', 'dislike', 'yet', 'film', 'likable', 'fact', 'reporter', 'love', 'sense', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'kind', 'escapism', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'review', 'Kenneth', 'love', 'too', 'typical', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'end', 'play.In', 'extra', 'footage', 'actor', 'who', 'boss', 'magazine', 'Jake', 'Johnson', 'play', 'guy', 'who', 'kind', 'douche', 'bag', 'can', 'see', 'have', 'good', 'qualities', 'least', 'Aubrey', 'boss', 'magazine', 'honest', 'film', 'Poet', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'claimed', 'most', 'important', 'virtue', 'courage', 'courage', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'practice', 'other', 'virtue', 'consistently', 'Perhaps', 'courage', 'character', 'be', 'so', 'honest', 'characters', 'honestly', 'help', 'exposition', 'movie', 'How', 'much', 'are', 'characters', 'real', 'reporters', 'magazine', 'How', ""'lazy"", 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Aubrey', 'Kenneth', 'rob', 'tech', 'company', 'laser', 'equipment', 'movie', 'reason', 'thought', 'Patty', 'Hearst', ""'re"", 'reporter', 'working', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'generally', 'good', 'conscience', 'Almost', 'nothing', 'really', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'are', 'three', 'romances', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Aubrey', 'relationship', 'Kenneth', 'boss', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'old', 'flame', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'travel', 'meant', 'be', 'metaphor', 'revisiting', 'relationship', 'just', 'one', 'point', 'film', ""n't"", 'continue', 'direction', 'third', 'romance', 'male', 'intern', 'reporter', 'who', 'portrayed', 'likely', 'virgin', 'young', 'girl', 'meet', 'love', 'affairs', 'take', 'appear', 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'final', 'love', 'affair', 'boss', 'just', 'two', 'youngsters', 'other', 'young', 'couple', 'begin', 'kissing', 'presumably', 'doing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'romances', 'always', 'whoever', 'together', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'affair', 'real', 'terms', 'would', 'mean', 'should', 'have', 'affair', 'boy', 'who', 'beside', 'school', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'like', 'happening', 'done', 'film', 'length', 'concerns', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'old', 'fashion', 'supporter', 'patriarchy', 'chauvinist', 'personally', 'would', 'like', 'one', 'day', 'marry', 'woman', 'who', 'virgin', 'be', 'honest', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'have', 'sex', 'marriage', 'not', 'even', 'never', 'marry', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'When', 'Kenneth', 'ear', 'fall', 'off', 'false', 'ear', 'restaurant', 'did', 'make', 'wonder', 'little', 'bit', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'Perhaps', 'wonder', 'time', 'travel', 'part', 'seem', 'more', 'believable', 'out', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'contain', 'science', 'fiction', 'least', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'surprise', 'see', 'time', 'travel', 'machine', 'learn', 'Aubrey', 'Kenneth', 'just', 'vanish', 'end', 'good', 'natured', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'film', 'did', 'credibly', 'suggest', 'time', 'machine', 'was', 'real', 'would', 'work', 'missed']",N/A

I have only done this once before.""The plot picks up by treating the classified as a real ad, which piques the interest of a Seattle magazine. Mistreated interns Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) are roped into the assignment by disaffected journalist Jeff Schwensen (Jake Johnson).  The impromptu road trip leads them to Ocean View to profile the author of the ad: Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), a stock clerk at a local grocery store.Jeff's real plan for visiting Ocean View is to visit ex-girlfriend Liz (Jenica Bergere), a fling from his teenage years. Jeff seems to be chasing not just memories of his time with Liz but his own lost youth, a youth he projects onto Arnau.  Meanwhile, Darius - who has been moping through life since the murder of her mother - connects with Kenneth in unexpected ways.  It's a lot like ""Ghost World,"" only with college students.At the heart of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is a question of authenticity.  Kenneth believes he can time travel when everyone else thinks he's a loon.  Conversely, Kenneth can immediately sense that nothing about Jeff is genuine, which is why he connects with Darius instead.  Jeff doesn't know what's genuine anymore - he's an unlikeable sleaze ball who has interns do all of his work - and desperately seeks to recapture his own lost youth.

Now comes this, which is co-produced by the Duplass brothers and others, and which stars Mark Duplass.""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (86 min.) is based on a real ad which appeared in a magazine, looking for a time travel mate, ""please bring your own weapons, safety not guaranteed"". From that writer Derek Connolly made up this story. In its very essence, a journalist and 2 interns from Seattle Magazine go out to Ocean View, WA, to find out who placed the ad (which turns out to be Kenneth, played by Mark Duplass), and why. One of the interns, Darius (played by Aubrey Plaza) poses as the time traveler-wanna be. Apart from this main story line, there are several parallel lines, one involving the magazine reporter looking up a HS girlfriend, now 20 years later. Duplass plays Kenneth straight up and you cannot tell whether the guy really believes that he can time travel, or whether he's just putting us on. That is one of the movie's biggest strenghts as it keeps the interest in the plot. That said, I was a bit let down by the ending, which came with a number of things unexplained, or worse, simply not believable.This is a quirky little movie that is mostly entertaining. The acting performances are great, in particular from Mark Duplass and Aubrey Plaza. Kudos also for the excellent soundtrack from Ryan Miller. Make sure to stick around to the very end, as ""Big Machine"", a song that Duplass briefly plays solo in the movie, plays in full band mode as the end credits roll, and it's a fantastic tune (performed by/credited to Ryan Miller and Mark Duplass).

It features characters with lots of annoying characteristics....people we might not like much if we met them in real life.  But it also features a very original basic idea and some moments of genuinely earned laughs and other moments of truly deserved...well, not tears exactly, but at least warm feelings.The story begins in the newsroom of a Northwestern City newspaper.  The editor is looking for story ideas, and one reporter suggests that he go interview the guy who ran odd wanted ad.  The ad says, essentially, that he's looking for a partner to travel in time with him, must bring own weapon, safety not guaranteed.  And he mentions that he's only traveled in time once before.  The story is quirky enough for the reporter (NEW GIRL's Jake Johnson) to get the gig.  He heads off with two interns, including moody, shy Aubry Plaza (from PARKS AND RECREATION).  They stalk the time traveler (the seemingly ubiquitous Mark Duplass...at least, in movies like this), and while he rejects working with Johnson...he does take a tentative liking to Plaza.Johnson plays a truly annoying jerk who has other reasons for coming to this small town...and he doesn't care much about the story he's chasing.  But Plaza and Duplass, the stars of the film, develop a very interesting friendship.  It reminded me of a low key version of the Bradley Cooper/Jennifer Lawrence pairing in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.  Two damaged people finding a connection, but not being miraculously ""fixed"" or ""cured"" by the new relationship.  Their scenes are talky, but quite witty and frequently touching.  Turns out that Duplass has a very specific time-travelling task in mind, and Plaza has a very specific goal in mind herself.  Naturally, Plaza doesn't actually believe they'll be travelling in time, but she seems to enjoy going along with the fantasy.  Duplass appears to be DEAD serious, though.The time travel aspect is certainly important to the film, particularly as the end approaches.  But most of the movie is an exploration of troubled relationships, loss and regret.  This sounds depressing, but the film never gets lower than melancholy.  This is not a wallow.  You won't need any Kleenexes to get you through.  But (much like the thoroughly enjoyable ROBOT AND FRANK), the sci-fi trappings are fun to experience and prevent this indie movie from dipping too hard into clich&eacute;s and actually give some familiar themes a feeling of freshness.SAFETY...  rambles a bit too aimlessly at times.  The Jake Johnson character fails to win sympathy where clearly it is being sought.  But the delightful Plaza and the less-annoying-than-usual Duplass are great fun to watch, and the movie is never less than interesting.

What the trio uncover is more than just a disturbed individual who can't separate fantasy from reality and it, ultimately, changes all their lives in different ways.END OF SPOILERS:If you come to ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" expecting a big budget visual effects driven movie, you'll be disappointed; the scale of the film is small and focuses on the character interactions.The Blu-ray presentation of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is quite nice although it isn't a perfect presentation (possibly due to the source); the outdoor scenes look positively stunning. Skin tones look natural and the colors are natural looking. The earlier, indoor scenes, however, aren't quite as detailed looking and aren't quite as strong.The DTS-HD 5.1 sounds quite nice with the dialogue sounding clear and the ambient sound effects are often quite subtle but they are there.The special features, unfortunately, aren't quite as strong probably due to the low budget assigned to the home video release. We get ""A Movie Making Mission"" which is a typical ""making of"" featurette with very little insight garnered or any great behind-the-scenes stories.Likewise ""The Ad Behind the Movie"" is all too brief. I would have loved to hear more about what those who first read the ad not knowing it was a goof might have thought of it including those at the magazine. Still, as brief as it is, it does give us a bit of insight into the origin of the film. We also get previews for other films.Ultimately people decide if they like a film as much based on the beginning and ending of the film (at least in my experience) more than the rest of the content of the film. The director manages to pull off a number of difficult tasks with ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" and does so quite well on a very limited budget. It's an impressive movie that reminds us that for every film that is about the spectacle, there needs to be just as many about the people with well drawn and defined characters.Recommended",5,Character driven comedy-drama with elements of science fiction--a winning combination.,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2970,"['Most', 'films', 'science', 'fiction', 'element', 'go', 'big', 'spectacle', 'visual', 'effects', 'missing', 'out', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'storytelling', 'people', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'reconnecting', 'emotions', 'humanity', 'opportunties', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'out', 'want', 'fix', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'ad', 'appeared', 'Backwoods', 'Magazine', 'filler', 'joke', 'character', 'driven', 'quirky', 'mixtured', 'comedy', 'drama.SPOILERS', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'oddball', 'where', 'Ken', 'Calloway', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'lost', 'soul', 'claims', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'fix', 'something', 'past', 'had', 'massive', 'impact', 'also', 'looking', 'partner', 'share', 'journey', 'journalist', 'Jake', 'Johnson', 'assignment', 'will', 'allow', 'reconnect', 'old', 'flame', 'Darius', 'Britt', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'Arnau', 'Karan', 'Soni', 'along', 'will', 'provide', 'bit', 'adventure', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'life', 'What', 'trio', 'uncover', 'more', 'just', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'separate', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'ultimately', 'changes', 'lives', 'different', 'ways.END', 'SPOILERS', 'come', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'expecting', 'big', 'budget', 'visual', 'effects', 'driven', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'scale', 'film', 'small', 'character', 'interactions.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'quite', 'nice', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'presentation', 'possibly', 'due', 'source', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'look', 'positively', 'stunning', 'Skin', 'tones', 'look', 'natural', 'colors', 'are', 'natural', 'looking', 'earlier', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'however', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'detailed', 'looking', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'strong.The', 'DTS-HD', '5.1', 'quite', 'nice', 'dialogue', 'sounding', 'clear', 'ambient', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'often', 'quite', 'subtle', 'are', 'there.The', 'special', 'features', 'unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'strong', 'probably', 'due', 'low', 'budget', 'assigned', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'get', 'A', 'Movie', 'Making', 'Mission', 'typical', 'making', 'featurette', 'very', 'little', 'insight', 'garnered', 'great', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stories.Likewise', 'Ad', 'Movie', 'too', 'brief', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'more', 'what', 'who', 'first', 'read', 'ad', 'not', 'knowing', 'was', 'goof', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'including', 'magazine', 'Still', 'as', 'brief', 'give', 'bit', 'insight', 'origin', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'previews', 'other', 'films.Ultimately', 'people', 'decide', 'like', 'film', 'much', 'based', 'beginning', 'ending', 'film', 'least', 'experience', 'more', 'rest', 'content', 'film', 'director', 'pull', 'off', 'number', 'difficult', 'tasks', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'so', 'quite', 'well', 'very', 'limited', 'budget', 'impressive', 'movie', 'film', 'spectacle', 'be', 'just', 'many', 'people', 'well', 'drawn', 'defined', 'characters.Recommended']",N/A

Her big eyes are both sarcastic and vulnerable. She is not as jaded as she seems at first blush. This is the kind of movie that I could watch any day, anytime. It is genuinely funny and yet has a big heart without feeling predictable or cliche'. It could conceivably be classified as science fiction but I think that would be misleading.
