1692503,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00HVFA33G,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[6, 7]","I'm always fascinated by a movie that starts off with the use of a Bible verse. Sometimes it's just a dramatic way to kick things off and means nothing more than that. Other times, the filmmaker is alluding to a message we'll be exploring for the next couple of hours or so. As a Christian, I like when that happens. Lionsgate's newest indie horror film &#34;The Appearing&#34; really surprised and impressed me using this approach.After the death of their daughter, Rachel (Emily Brooks)and Michael (Will Wallace) move to a small town to forget the past and start over. Shortly after they arrive, Rachel begins seeing disturbing visions that seem linked to an old abandoned house. It's the very same location of several disappearances over the years. As Michael digs deeper into the vanishings, he discovers there might be a more sinister power at work.&#34;The Appearing&#34; works because it isn't just a possession film. We get plenty of those every year already. It's successful at holding your attention because it blends the aspects of movies like &#34;The Exorcist&#34; with ingredients from supernatural thrillers and mysteries with surprise twists in the end.Lead actor Emily Brooks does an adequate job of portraying the schizophrenic and seemingly bi-polar Rachel. What she lacks in one area she more than makes up for when she lets her hair down and gets demented for the camera. &#34;The Appearing&#34; also stars Patrick Swayze's brother, Don. He puts in a heartfelt effort as the God-fearing Sheriff Hendricks. Dean Cain plays a doctor who believes everything can be explained away by science.Extra points are awarded to &#34;The Appearing&#34; because of the religious and Biblical angle it comes to the table with. The people that are possessed in the movie aren't just innocent bystanders. Each one harbored some sort of deep-seeded anger or other negative emotion that acted as a doorway for the demonic force to let itself in. The film serves as a reminder to everyone that we're all capable of committing heinous acts. It's only through faith and self-control that we can overcome temptation and wrong-doing.&#34;The Appearing&#34; is rated R for bloody horror violence. However, it includes language and adult situations as well. It's not a movie you'll probably want to use as a study tool for your youth group. Just because it promotes Christian themes doesn't mean it's appropriate for all ages.The DVD version of &#34;The Appearing&#34; has a couple of special features. &#34;Making 'The Appearing'&#34; goes behind the scenes of the movie and includes interviews with the cast and crew. They all comment on how great it was to shoot at the actual &#34;Psycho&#34; house from the classic Alfred Hitchcock film. There's also a trailer gallery included.For those looking for a movie that reaches out past the boundaries of most demonic possession films, &#34;The Appearing&#34; adds the spices you can find in supernatural outings and crime thrillers. While it's not perfect, enough effort was put into creating the movie to warrant a viewing by any fan of multiple horror sub-genres. It also provides some food for thought in a spiritual sense, which is never a bad thing.",4,Lionsgate delivers supernatural thrills and demonic chills with 'The Appearing',1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,3198,"[""'m"", 'always', 'fascinated', 'movie', 'use', 'Bible', 'verse', 'just', 'dramatic', 'way', 'kick', 'things', 'nothing', 'more', 'Other', 'times', 'filmmaker', 'alluding', 'message', ""'ll"", 'be', 'exploring', 'next', 'couple', 'hours', 'so', 'Christian', 'like', 'when', 'Lionsgate', 'newest', 'indie', 'horror', 'film', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'really', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'using', 'approach.After', 'death', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'Emily', 'Brooks', 'Michael', 'Will', 'Wallace', 'move', 'small', 'town', 'forget', 'past', 'start', 'Shortly', 'arrive', 'Rachel', 'seeing', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'seem', 'linked', 'old', 'abandoned', 'house', 'very', 'same', 'location', 'several', 'disappearances', 'years', 'Michael', 'digs', 'deeper', 'vanishings', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'sinister', 'power', 'work.', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'works', ""n't"", 'just', 'possession', 'film', 'get', 'plenty', 'year', 'already', 'successful', 'holding', 'attention', 'aspects', 'movies', '34', 'Exorcist', '34', 'ingredients', 'supernatural', 'thrillers', 'mysteries', 'surprise', 'twists', 'end.Lead', 'actor', 'Emily', 'Brooks', 'adequate', 'job', 'portraying', 'schizophrenic', 'seemingly', 'bi-polar', 'Rachel', 'What', 'one', 'area', 'more', 'up', 'when', 'hair', 'down', 'demented', 'camera', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'also', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'brother', 'Don', 'heartfelt', 'effort', 'God-fearing', 'Sheriff', 'Hendricks', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'doctor', 'who', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'science.Extra', 'points', 'are', 'awarded', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'religious', 'Biblical', 'angle', 'table', 'people', 'are', 'possessed', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'one', 'harbored', 'sort', 'deep-seeded', 'anger', 'other', 'negative', 'emotion', 'acted', 'doorway', 'demonic', 'force', 'let', 'film', 'reminder', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'capable', 'committing', 'heinous', 'acts', 'only', 'faith', 'self-control', 'can', 'overcome', 'temptation', 'wrong-doing.', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'rated', 'R', 'bloody', 'horror', 'violence', 'However', 'language', 'adult', 'situations', 'well', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'use', 'study', 'tool', 'youth', 'group', 'Just', 'Christian', 'themes', ""n't"", 'mean', 'appropriate', 'ages.The', 'DVD', 'version', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'couple', 'special', 'features', '34', 'Making', ""'The"", 'Appearing', '34', 'scenes', 'movie', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'comment', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'shoot', 'actual', '34', 'Psycho', '34', 'house', 'classic', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'also', 'trailer', 'gallery', 'included.For', 'looking', 'movie', 'out', 'boundaries', 'most', 'demonic', 'possession', 'films', '34', 'Appearing', '34', 'spices', 'can', 'find', 'supernatural', 'outings', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'not', 'perfect', 'enough', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'creating', 'movie', 'warrant', 'viewing', 'fan', 'multiple', 'horror', 'sub-genres', 'also', 'food', 'thought', 'spiritual', 'sense', 'never', 'bad', 'thing']",The Appearing Digital

I lost interest and googled Don Swazye who appears as the Sheriff in this movie.  Yes, it's Patrick's younger brother & you recognize the family resemblance as soon as he first makes his appearance.  He even sounds like his brother (RIP).  He was the most natural looking actor, comfortable in front of the camera and his skills brought range to his character.  Unfortunately, he wasn't in the story enough to keep this film flowing & captivating, so it crawled on.HINT:  Playing suspenseful musical tidbits loudly isn't really enough to actually create suspense.  That comes from words on the page.  The story was non-eventful, the rest of crew (lead actor/actress) were stoic and not believable as a married couple - there was no chemistry and not enough talent to pretend there was.I think you may be as disappointed as I if you choose to view anyway.

1692507,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00HVFA33G,Matthew Scott Baker,"[2, 5]","Is it just me or is every horror movie released nowadays based on a true story or true events?  It seems like every other tagline I run across states that very thing.  As such, it&#8217;s getting difficult to differentiate between actual legends and/or myths and those created specifically for films.  THE APPEARING is a movie that falls into this category.  But what makes this one so interesting is that neither the film nor the supposed story it is based on make much sense at all.  As a result, this lackluster horror flick contains few scares and even fewer enjoyable moments.Normally, I&#8217;m foaming at the mouth after watching a demon or possession flick.  After all, who doesn&#8217;t enjoy that subject matter?  Earlier this week, I mentioned this very thing in a book review of David Bernstein&#8217;s DAMAGED SOULS over Shattered Ravings.  I said, &#8220;I love stories about demons because there seem to be no boundaries. With zombies, you have specific guidelines to stay within: they have to be dead, they are usually rotting, they don&#8217;t have cognizance, etc. Similarly, vampires usually cannot be out in daylight, they drink blood, etc. You see where I&#8217;m going. But with demons, all bets are off. Authors can pretty much do what they want and make them as sadistic as they want to be.&#8221;  This certainly fits for the most part&#8230;but unfortunately not here with THE APPEARING.The cinematography and production value of this film look ok, although the budget looks lean and the quality of film is about that of a Syfy Channel film.  The acting is so-so, and the characters themselves are decent.  So everything up to this point should provide a decent movie experience.But the story is where THE APPEARING fails.  There&#8217;s no cohesion to much of anything, just a random assortment of story lines that never quite mesh together.  Now that it is over, I think I see where the filmmaker was trying to go&#8230;but the film never gets there.  I am left with a bunch of questions and nothing that ties them up.I cannot recommend THE APPEARING, unless you really want to see Patrick Swayze&#8217;s brother, Don, onscreen.  Although he does a decent job with his role, the movie itself flops too greatly to appreciate him.  I would simply give this one a pass.",2,Give this one a pass,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2294,"['just', 'horror', 'movie', 'released', 'nowadays', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'true', 'events', 'other', 'tagline', 'run', 'states', 'very', 'thing', 'such', '8217', 'getting', 'difficult', 'differentiate', 'actual', 'legends', 'and/or', 'myths', 'created', 'specifically', 'films', 'APPEARING', 'movie', 'category', 'what', 'one', 'so', 'interesting', 'film', 'supposed', 'story', 'based', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'result', 'lackluster', 'horror', 'flick', 'few', 'scares', 'even', 'fewer', 'enjoyable', 'moments.Normally', '8217', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'watching', 'demon', 'possession', 'flick', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 'enjoy', 'subject', 'matter', 'Earlier', 'week', 'mentioned', 'very', 'thing', 'book', 'review', 'David', 'Bernstein', '8217', 'DAMAGED', 'SOULS', 'Shattered', 'Ravings', 'said', '8220', 'love', 'stories', 'demons', 'seem', 'be', 'boundaries', 'zombies', 'have', 'specific', 'guidelines', 'stay', 'have', 'be', 'dead', 'are', 'usually', 'rotting', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'cognizance', 'etc', 'Similarly', 'vampires', 'usually', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'out', 'daylight', 'drink', 'blood', 'etc', 'see', 'where', '8217', 'going', 'demons', 'bets', 'are', 'off', 'Authors', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'make', 'as', 'sadistic', 'want', 'be.', '8221', 'certainly', 'most', 'part', '8230', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'here', 'THE', 'APPEARING.The', 'cinematography', 'production', 'value', 'film', 'look', 'ok', 'budget', 'lean', 'quality', 'film', 'Syfy', 'Channel', 'film', 'acting', 'so-so', 'characters', 'are', 'decent', 'So', 'everything', 'up', 'point', 'should', 'provide', 'decent', 'movie', 'story', 'where', 'THE', 'APPEARING', '8217', 'cohesion', 'much', 'anything', 'just', 'random', 'assortment', 'story', 'lines', 'never', 'quite', 'mesh', 'together', 'Now', 'think', 'see', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'trying', 'go', '8230', 'film', 'never', 'there', 'am', 'left', 'bunch', 'questions', 'nothing', 'up.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'THE', 'APPEARING', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', '8217', 'brother', 'Don', 'onscreen', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'movie', 'too', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'would', 'simply', 'give', 'one', 'pass']",The Appearing Digital
