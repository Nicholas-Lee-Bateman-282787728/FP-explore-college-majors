724464,AS558SNWF1DXG,B0000766F7,Clare Quilty,"[41, 45]","Short, sharp, and crispy imagined and photographed, ""The Hours and Times"" presents a casual-to-the-point-of-verite look at John Lennon, and the Beatles manager and worshiper, Brian Epstein as they spend a weekend in Spain after the detonation of Beatlemania, but before the explosion.It's pretty common knowledge that Epstein was in love with Lennon; common knowledge also that Lennon had issues with his own sexuality and curiousity, that he was equally in awe of and disgusted by Epstein.  This movie offers a hypothetical treatment of two days in their relationship.Many people will complain that this movie moves slowly, that not a lot happens.  I found that to be one of its virtues, because the performances seem (to me, anyway) to be so dead-on, and the script is so careful not to show off, that at times it does feel like we're watching documentary footage of the two famous, troubled geniuses.  Unlike most movies, this film says exactly what it has to say in just about an hour... and then ends.  I both admired the movie's restraint and was sorry to see it end.So many details seem right, too: hotel lobbies and suites in Barcelona; the interior of a 727 (of which we only really see two seats); Lennon sketching in pajamas, being casually cruel to his wife, Cynthia; Epstein listening to the radio and gently crying.One particular scene, in which John squares off against a shrewd stewardess and they resolve the drama by twisting to a new Little Richard single, contains enough truth and beauty and sadness to fill an entire, full-length movie.If you've ever poured over a book of Beatle photographs and marveled as much at the famous faces as at the little details in the background -- Coke bottles, packs of Marlboros, rings and board games, transistor radios, suits and shirts and ties -- you really should see this movie.",4,eavesdropping,1044489600,"02 6, 2003",2003,1839,"['Short', 'sharp', 'crispy', 'imagined', 'photographed', 'Hours', 'Times', 'casual-to-the-point-of-verite', 'look', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Beatles', 'manager', 'worshiper', 'Brian', 'Epstein', 'spend', 'weekend', 'Spain', 'detonation', 'Beatlemania', 'explosion.It', 'pretty', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Epstein', 'was', 'love', 'Lennon', 'common', 'knowledge', 'also', 'Lennon', 'had', 'issues', 'own', 'sexuality', 'curiousity', 'was', 'equally', 'awe', 'disgusted', 'Epstein', 'movie', 'hypothetical', 'treatment', 'two', 'days', 'relationship.Many', 'people', 'will', 'complain', 'movie', 'slowly', 'not', 'lot', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'virtues', 'performances', 'seem', 'anyway', 'be', 'so', 'dead-on', 'script', 'so', 'careful', 'not', 'show', 'off', 'times', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'documentary', 'footage', 'two', 'famous', 'troubled', 'geniuses', 'most', 'movies', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'say', 'just', 'hour', 'then', 'admired', 'movie', 'restraint', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'end.So', 'many', 'details', 'seem', 'right', 'too', 'hotel', 'lobbies', 'suites', 'Barcelona', 'interior', '727', 'only', 'really', 'see', 'two', 'seats', 'Lennon', 'sketching', 'pajamas', 'being', 'casually', 'cruel', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'Epstein', 'listening', 'radio', 'gently', 'crying.One', 'particular', 'scene', 'John', 'off', 'shrewd', 'stewardess', 'resolve', 'drama', 'twisting', 'new', 'Little', 'Richard', 'single', 'enough', 'truth', 'beauty', 'sadness', 'fill', 'entire', 'full-length', 'movie.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'poured', 'over', 'book', 'Beatle', 'photographs', 'marveled', 'as', 'much', 'famous', 'as', 'little', 'details', 'background', 'Coke', 'bottles', 'packs', 'Marlboros', 'rings', 'board', 'games', 'transistor', 'radios', 'suits', 'shirts', 'ties', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'movie']",N/A
724465,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B0000766F7,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[4, 5]","First off, for those who don't know...this film is based purely on conjecturearound a real-life event. In the spring of 1963, before The Beatles really blew up worldwideand were mostly known in England, John Lennon, then age 22 going on 23, did in factgo off on a vacation/excursion with The Beatles' manager and friend Brian Epstein,who was 6 yrs John's senior, educated & refined, and a businessman who had adefinite vision for where this charming band of boys could go!It's no secret that Brian ""fancied"" young John, who was the daring renegade of the bandand had more of a gruffness and edge to him than the others did.John spoke his mind always!---Kill or Cure.John was highly intelligent, thoughtful, witty, and had a way with words whichcould inspire or assassinate, depending on his mood....and those often swung in all directions.John's life hadn't been an easy one, he was working class, full of angst & sarcasm,and he was handy with his fists too if he had to be.He was curious about all things in life....high and low...and wasn't afraid to explore them.It was known among ""the lads"" that Brian was a ""puff"", a british slang for a gay man,though they really didn't have problem with it because for the most part theirrelationship remained a professional one, save he and John's strangecuriosity / flirtation / antagonization thing! (-:It was said that John could be crass and cruel to Brian one minute,calling him names and making off-color remarks regarding his sexuality behind his backand also in his face too, but then in the next minute he'd be hanging out with Brianand hovering on his every word and gesture.Now those are the things we know....the rest of this film from therein, is pure speculation & fantasy.I do personally feel that at that point in his life, John Lennon was whatis known today as ""bi-curious"". (Just has always been a hunch, the more I read about him.)This isn't an uncommon thing among young men from their mid teens up until around 25 or 26,some later on in their lives and some never, but youthful curiosity and experimentationis nothing to be ashamed of and doesn't really define what your sexuality will be.It's just poking around (so to speak) and finding out what appeals to you and what doesn't.Having said that, there are very frank sexual discussions between the two in the film,there are moments of levity, there are moments of frustration, moments where John seemsto want to plunge headlong into being sexually intimate with Brian, who in my opinion,makes himself seem all too willing and desperate for John, and opens himself up tomanipulation and John's hot & cold advances/rejections, which always leave poor Brianon the losing side of the game emotionally.You get the feeling that John may have loved this mental S&M; dynamic to their relationship.Waving the juicy steak (himself) in the tiger's face, only to snatch it back at thelast minute, just when the tiger's interest & hunger is piqued!There seems to be in Brian a characteristic fantasy which has been the downfallof many an otherwise intelligent and productive gay man!The desire to attain something they can never truly have....the hot masculine mostly straight or bi-curious man who doesn't frequent the gay sceneand has maybe only acted on his hidden desires once or twice in a very limited capacity.To this day, lots of gay men drive themselves to distraction and/or ruin trying toreach for this fantasy! It usually always ends in heartache for them.There's a scene where John leaves the room while Brian is napping and runs a bath,strips naked, jumps in the tub and begins to play his harmonica, knowing full wellthat Brian would hear it, wake up, and venture into the bathroom to catch John inall his naked early 20's masculine splendor, with a flirtatious come hitherman-boyish grin on his face. John says, ""I was waiting on you to come and scrub my back!""and slowly turns his back to Brian.Brian wastes no time washing John's back....rubbing him, massaging him,dipping the wash rag into the warm water, rubbing against John's submerged backsideon the way back out of the water. It's very sensual,  and he and John gaze into eachothers' eyes and begin to kiss passionately!Brian then strips naked himself and joins John in the bath....they entwine bodies and kiss and embrace passionately for awhile....Brian's flood gates of desire are about to explode open past the point of no return!Just then, as quickly as it started, John turns ice cold and abruptly leaves Brianin the tub alone. You feel Brian's anguish, frustration, loneliness & alienationall in that instant! John of course, is impervious, and acts very aloof as Brian finallycomes out of the bath, clad in his boxers and a bathrobe and stands behind him.""What are you thinking about?"" he quizzes.John just looks off blankly, very distantly, and says""Nothing that I can put into words.""You then understand John's inner turmoil and conflict as a young man, who's marriedand has just recently become a father for the first time, who clearly enjoys his relationswith women and being one of the guys amongst his band mates, and yet he has thesedeep longings for male-to-male intimacy which scares him as much as it titilates himand stirs his insatiable curiosity! (HEY!!--You've got to hide your love away!)Well, I won't give the rest of the film away, but it's very interesting to watch.It was basically an arthouse kind of film and only lasts for 56 or 57 minutes.But the director, the writers and the actors really were able to work it.In the end, only John Lennon, Brian Epstein, and the almighty eyes of the universeknow what truly went on between them on that lost weekend excursion inBarcelona 47 springs ago, in a fleeting moment in time before destiny intervened!And to tell you the truth, I could really care less!It wouldn't dim John Lennon's musical & lyrical genius not one bit to me,nor take away from what he and the rest of the Fab Four (and Brian as their manager)accomplished in the 60's and has meant to the pop culture of the world ever since!",4,"Young John's Curiosity, Poor Brian's Unfulfilled Frustration & Longing!!",1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,6043,"['First', 'off', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'based', 'purely',

724468,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B0000766F7,Phil S.,"[2, 2]","This package includes a ""Featurette"" which should be viewed before the feature. It explains why it looks like a successful film student project and why its' minimalist values take some getting used to. That will put the movie at an unoffical [approx.] 70 minutes.A part of Beatles' lore is that the same-sex leanings of their genius Manager, Brian Epstein, became fully known to his group's leader, John Lennon, at a vacation spot, just before the world consumed both parties.In 1988, when this film was started, such a relationship had more resonance, culturally. Today...so what? A couple of guys take off for a week or so, and something happens that one of the guys is not sure he wanted to happen. Anyway, it still holds alot of interest because...it's ""The Beatles"".A good scene is near the end: at the Hotel Suite in Barcelona, ""Lennon"" draws a bath, soon to be joined by ""Epstein"". An embrace follows, initiated by John. Is it true romantic passion, or is it a complicated man's expression of *brotherly* love?We are inclined to believe an aspect of the artists' personality was impulsive and honest, because suddenly he appears repulsed by his move, and he is ""saved"" psychologically/socially by a female fan who shows up at the Hotel, in an alluring outfit, ready to rumble, ready to dance? She is carrying a copy of Little Richard's new recording of ""I'm In Love Again"". Lennon grabs it, mentions that his group opened for Richard the year before, places it on the turntable and dances freely about with the lady - a groovy little twister, I might add.This scene seems to snap JL back into that brave new (inherited from Richard and co.) world, where ""straight"" is the way for a young, rockin' stud.Intentionally or unintentionally, there are black and white qualities of Richard Lester's classic ""A Hard Day's Night"", featuring John and co.Ian Hart, playing the 23 year old Lennon, seems a bit too young, but his understated performance is excellent. David Angus as Epstein, has alot less resemblance, but his brooding, tormented portrayal is notable.""The Hours And Times"" is anyone's ""Life"" and times really *hours* and times?",4,Interesting muse,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,2138,"['package', 'Featurette', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'feature', 'why', 'successful', 'film', 'student', 'project', 'why', 'minimalist', 'values', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'will', 'put', 'movie', 'unoffical', '[', 'approx', '70', 'minutes.A', 'part', 'Beatles', 'lore', 'same-sex', 'leanings', 'genius', 'Manager', 'Brian', 'Epstein', 'became', 'fully', 'known', 'group', 'leader', 'John', 'Lennon', 'vacation', 'spot', 'just', 'world', 'consumed', 'parties.In', '1988', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'started', 'relationship', 'had', 'more', 'resonance', 'culturally', 'Today', 'so', 'what', 'couple', 'guys', 'take', 'off', 'week', 'so', 'something', 'one', 'guys', 'not', 'sure', 'wanted', 'happen', 'Anyway', 'still', 'alot', 'interest', 'Beatles', '.A', 'good', 'scene', 'end', 'Hotel', 'Suite', 'Barcelona', 'Lennon', 'bath', 'soon', 'be', 'joined', 'Epstein', 'embrace', 'initiated', 'John', 'true', 'romantic', 'passion', 'complicated', 'man', 'expression', '*brotherly*', 'love', 'are', 'inclined', 'believe', 'aspect', 'artists', 'personality', 'was', 'impulsive', 'honest', 'suddenly', 'repulsed', 'move', 'saved', 'psychologically/socially', 'female', 'fan', 'who', 'up', 'Hotel', 'alluring', 'outfit', 'ready', 'rumble', 'ready', 'dance', 'carrying', 'copy', 'Little', 'Richard', 'new', 'recording', ""'m"", 'Love', 'Again', 'Lennon', 'grabs', 'mentions', 'group', 'opened', 'Richard', 'year', 'places', 'turntable', 'dances', 'freely', 'lady', 'groovy', 'little', 'twister', 'might', 'add.This', 'scene', 'snap', 'JL', 'back', 'brave', 'new', 'inherited', 'Richard', 'co.', 'world', 'where', 'straight', 'way', 'young', 'rockin', 'stud.Intentionally', 'unintentionally', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'qualities', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'classic', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'featuring', 'John', 'co.Ian', 'Hart', 'playing', '23', 'year', 'old', 'Lennon', 'bit', 'too', 'young', 'understated', 'performance', 'excellent', 'David', 'Angus', 'Epstein', 'alot', 'less', 'resemblance', 'brooding', 'tormented', 'portrayal', 'notable', 'Hours', 'Times', 'anyone', 'Life', 'times', 'really', '*hours*', 'times']",N/A
