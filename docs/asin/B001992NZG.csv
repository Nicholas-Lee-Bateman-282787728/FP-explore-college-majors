1162169,A27ZCU9LK0CMQ5,B001992NZG,"Obiturized ""Metal fan""","[3, 4]","Well well, what do we have here, another great season set of an iconic 1950's/1960's television show? Why yes, yes we do, I shouldn't have to speak about the greatness of this show, most people already know how great this show was/is, especially in a time where sitcoms are boring and stale (my opinion of course), it's great to see all these great old sitcoms getting their due on DVD, such as 'I Love Lucy' a few years ago, 'Mister Ed' 'The Lucy Show' 'Here's Lucy' and 'Leave it to Beaver', and in my estimation, Shout Factory! has done a great job with releasing season sets before (like All In The Family), and the 'Leave it to Beaver' seasons are no different.Right of you'll notice a great packaging, with the clear hard plastic case, and inside you get 6 DVD's housed in sturdy holders, and a booklet telling you which episodes are on which discs, original airdates, explaining what the episodes are about, guest stars and more, now let me get on to the content of this set which is of course the episodes themselves, now I noticed Universal released the first 2 seasons of this show, but didn't release anymore, so Shout Factory! got the rights to it I'm guessing, so that they could finish releasing it, but I think they have released the first 2 seasons in their name as well with 'The Complete Series' box set, now I don't have that, all I have is seasons 3 and 4, so with that being said, the content, you get all 39 episodes of the third season, and they are all completely restored and remastered, and boy you can tell, most of the cuts and tears have been removed, as well as the grain, a few spots you can notice a few rips and a little grain, but with a show that's over 50 years of age, they did a fine job remastering these, the rips and grain that you do see at times is pretty minimal, you only see it in certain shots, no gripes with me when you see how great most of it looks, crystal clear, and the picture literally jumps right off the screen, even though this show was of course shot in black and white, it makes no difference, the picture still jumps off the screen, so remastering job? 5 stars all the way, I cannot complain, and the audio is crystal clear as well, gone of course are the original mono tracks, and it sounds superb, so audio? 5 stars as well.So yeah, I guess you could say I'm very pleased with this, and will be purchasing the rest of the seasons eventually, this is a great old show, and it's gotten the recognition it's deserved on DVD finally, so if you're looking to get 'Leave it to Beaver' on DVD, you cannot go wrong with these Shout Factory! season sets, they are well worth the price at about $25.00-$30.00 depending on where you get it, Amazon here has this season at $25.00, which is a very reasonable price considering I paid $30.00 at Walmart.",5,A very nice season set!,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2803,"['Well', 'well', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'here', 'great', 'season', 'set', 'iconic', ""1950's/1960"", 'television', 'show', 'Why', 'yes', 'yes', 'do', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'speak', 'greatness', 'show', 'most', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'especially', 'time', 'where', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'boring', 'stale', 'opinion', 'course', 'great', 'see', 'great', 'old', 'sitcoms', 'getting', 'due', 'DVD', 'such', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'few', 'years', 'ago', ""'Mister"", 'Ed', 'Lucy', 'Show', 'Lucy', ""'Leave"", 'Beaver', 'estimation', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'releasing', 'season', 'sets', 'Family', ""'Leave"", 'Beaver', 'seasons', 'are', 'different.Right', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'great', 'packaging', 'clear', 'hard', 'plastic', 'case', 'get', '6', 'DVD', 'housed', 'sturdy', 'holders', 'booklet', 'telling', 'episodes', 'are', 'discs', 'original', 'airdates', 'explaining', 'what', 'episodes', 'are', 'guest', 'stars', 'more', 'now', 'let', 'get', 'content', 'set', 'course', 'episodes', 'now', 'noticed', 'Universal', 'released', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'anymore', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'got', 'rights', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'could', 'finish', 'releasing', 'think', 'have', 'released', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'name', 'as', 'well', ""'The"", 'Complete', 'Series', 'box', 'set', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'content', 'get', '39', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'are', 'completely', 'restored', 'remastered', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'cuts', 'tears', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'as', 'well', 'grain', 'few', 'spots', 'can', 'notice', 'few', 'rips', 'little', 'grain', 'show', '50', 'years', 'age', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'remastering', 'rips', 'grain', 'do', 'see', 'times', 'pretty', 'minimal', 'only', 'see', 'certain', 'shots', 'gripes', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'most', 'crystal', 'clear', 'picture', 'literally', 'jumps', 'right', 'screen', 'even', 'show', 'was', 'course', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'difference', 'picture', 'still', 'screen', 'remastering', 'job', '5', 'stars', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'complain', 'audio', 'crystal', 'clear', 'well', 'gone', 'course', 'are', 'original', 'mono', 'tracks', 'superb', 'audio', '5', 'stars', 'well.So', 'yeah', 'guess', 'could', 'say', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'rest', 'seasons', 'eventually', 'great', 'old', 'show', 'gotten', 'recognition', 'deserved', 'DVD', 'finally', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'get', ""'Leave"", 'Beaver', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'well', 'price', '25.00-', '30.00', 'depending', 'where', 'get', 'Amazon', 'here', 'season', '25.00', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'considering', 'paid', '30.00', 'Walmart']",Leave it to Beaver: Season 3
