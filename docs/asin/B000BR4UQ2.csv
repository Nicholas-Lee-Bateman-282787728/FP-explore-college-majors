The AM set is appropriately vigorous for a morning routine, but not so much so that you don't want to do it.  The PM set is more meditative, and you will be very relaxed afterward.  I would say, roughly, that the AM set works your 1st through 4th chakras, and the PM set works your 3rd through 7th chakras.I got this because I was interested in a vigorous practice, but the PM set blew me away.  I won't be so grand as to say I could feel my kundalini rising, but I will say that I felt my 6th and 7th chakras activated- and buzzing!  It was very cool- both energizing and calming.  I didn't sleep like a rock, but I did feel centered and focused afterward.The premixes and matrix options are so useful- I'm not sure why everyone doesn't use these.",5,Unique take on AM/PM,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,801,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'broken', 'release', 'down', 'well', 'AM', 'set', 'appropriately', 'vigorous', 'morning', 'routine', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'PM', 'set', 'more', 'meditative', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'relaxed', 'afterward', 'would', 'say', 'roughly', 'AM', 'set', '1st', '4th', 'chakras', 'PM', 'set', 'works', '3rd', '7th', 'chakras.I', 'got', 'was', 'interested', 'vigorous', 'practice', 'PM', 'set', 'blew', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'grand', 'say', 'could', 'feel', 'kundalini', 'rising', 'will', 'say', 'felt', '6th', '7th', 'chakras', 'activated-', 'buzzing', 'was', 'very', 'cool-', 'energizing', 'calming', 'did', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'rock', 'did', 'feel', 'centered', 'focused', 'afterward.The', 'premixes', 'matrix', 'options', 'are', 'so', 'useful-', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'use']",N/A
948468,A55LS2HWPQB0Q,B000BR4UQ2,"Jill Florio ""Green RVer""","[21, 21]","This was an interesting DVD. I started doing yoga a few months back but hadn't experienced Kundalini at all.Apparently, if this DVD is indicative of typical Kundalini practice, the form is all about breathing fast and repeating small movements for long periods of time.The workout is physically exhausting, even though there are no actual 'yoga'-type poses. The routine is, you mostly sit there moving your arms, breathing in and out very fast. Or moving your legs while  breathing really fast. Or sitting still and breathing really fast. I was dripping sweat, but barely moving.The whole routine was rather like tightly controlled aerobics class. With really involved chanting.There were many meditations interspersed between the moves, which I found different than I was used to - I am used to the savasana being at the end. This is a completely different kind of yoga.It's possible that this kind of yoga is extremely satisfying to some people, but I don't think this is the kind I would do again. At least not at this time - maybe my tastes will move into that direction later in my practice.I think the chanting parts would be better if the words were left on the screen more than a moment. It was very hard to remember what I was supposed to be saying.The AM and PM sections were pretty similar in my estimation. I really have no idea what made either one a morning or night-time set. Each part is about a half hour, but one can do the whole disc in 90 minutes (including the intro, breathing instruction, warm-up and meditations).The menu offers a choice of playing the entire DVD or pieces at a time. There is a brief intro to the various breathing techniques (slow breathing and Breath of Fire) and an short warm-up to the AM or PM parts.Instructor Ana Brett sits on a small round white rug in a white room. It's kind of neat that you can't see the walls - it looks like she is on a magic carpet floating in an ethereal plane. She has her eyes closed during most of the routine and we only hear her voice during the introduction to breathing and during the chanting/singing.We don't see the other instructor, Ravi Singh, at all but hear his voice during the routines. His voice is low and soothing. During each set, he talks about how the poses are helping different organs and bodily systems.Although this style of yoga is not to my preference, I did get a fantastic workout and know my core will be sore tomorrow.Overall, the DVD is probably not for people seeking a typical yoga experience. It might be very well-done as far as Kundalini goes, but it's so not what I was expecting during my beginner's yogic learning curve.A good, alternative yoga program with lots of chanting for Kundalini yogis or fitness fans open to experimenting.",4,"Not typical yoga but a great workout, with a constant breath of fire and tightly controlled movements",1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,2748,"['was', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'started', 'doing', 'yoga', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'had', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'Kundalini', 'all.Apparently', 'DVD', 'indicative', 'typical', 'Kundalini', 'practice', 'form', 'breathing', 'fast', 'repeating', 'small', 'movements', 'long', 'periods', 'time.The', 'workout', 'physically', 'exhausting', 'even', 'are', 'actual', ""'yoga'-type"", 'poses', 'routine', 'mostly', 'sit', 'there', 'moving', 'arms', 'breathing', 'very', 'fast', 'moving', 'legs', 'breathing', 'really', 'fast', 'sitting', 'still', 'breathing', 'really', 'fast', 'was', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'barely', 'moving.The', 'whole', 'routine', 'was', 'rather', 'like', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'aerobics', 'class', 'really', 'involved', 'chanting.There', 'were', 'many', 'meditations', 'interspersed', 'moves', 'found', 'different', 'was', 'used', 'am', 'used', 'savasana', 'being', 'end', 'completely', 'different', 'kind', 'yoga.It', 'possible', 'kind', 'yoga', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kind', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'least', 'not', 'time', 'maybe', 'tastes', 'will', 'move', 'direction', 'later', 'practice.I', 'think', 'chanting', 'parts', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'words', 'were', 'left', 'screen', 'more', 'moment', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'saying.The', 'AM', 'PM', 'sections', 'were', 'pretty', 'similar', 'estimation', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'made', 'one', 'morning', 'night-time', 'set', 'part', 'half', 'hour', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'whole', 'disc', '90', 'minutes', 'including', 'intro', 'breathing', 'instruction', 'warm-up', 'meditations', '.The', 'menu', 'choice', 'playing', 'entire', 'DVD', 'pieces', 'time', 'brief', 'intro', 'various', 'breathing', 'techniques', 'slow', 'breathing', 'Breath', 'Fire', 'short', 'warm-up', 'AM', 'PM', 'parts.Instructor', 'Ana', 'Brett', 'small', 'round', 'white', 'rug', 'white', 'room', 'kind', 'neat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'walls', 'magic', 'carpet', 'floating', 'ethereal', 'plane', 'eyes', 'closed', 'most', 'routine', 'only', 'hear', 'voice', 'introduction', 'breathing', 'chanting/singing.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'instructor', 'Ravi', 'Singh', 'hear', 'voice', 'routines', 'voice', 'low', 'soothing', 'set', 'how', 'poses', 'are', 'helping', 'different', 'organs', 'bodily', 'style', 'yoga', 'not', 'preference', 'did', 'get', 'fantastic', 'workout', 'know', 'core', 'will', 'be', 'sore', 'tomorrow.Overall', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'people', 'seeking', 'typical', 'yoga', 'experience', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'well-done', 'as', 'far', 'Kundalini', 'so', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'beginner', 'yogic', 'learning', 'curve.A', 'good', 'alternative', 'yoga', 'program', 'lots', 'chanting', 'Kundalini', 'yogis', 'fitness', 'fans', 'open', 'experimenting']",N/A

Somehow this ""craving"", which I had fought for years, left me after the first time doing their exercise DVD.

Since then I recognised that especially the chakra exercises which seem to be simple are extremely effective.With regards to the AM & PM I highly recommend it.

In the AM set, there is a breathing meditation (with mudra)that pumps the stomach.  Then there are warm-ups and a wonderful breathe of fire sequence to get your engines going.  But the best part is the morning meditation of Ek Ong Kar Sat Nam Siri Wahae Guru, (One Creator, Truth-Identity, Great beyond description is Divine Wisdom) which is the Morning Call.  It is done about 7-8 minutes.  I will add this to my daily morning practice.  The PM set works your legs by doing a walking on the ceiling exercise, lying on your back and move your arms and legs.  It really works.  The set also ends with a meditation.  I think it was about 11 minutes.  It is the Shabd Kriya.  Loved it.
