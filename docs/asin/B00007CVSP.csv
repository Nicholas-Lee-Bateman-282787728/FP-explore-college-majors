Those who are familiar with the basic story behind this may learn of some new things, such as the fact that LBJ himself watched and disliked the show (you' figure he had other things to worry about like Vietnam and Civil Rights) and of the Smothers successful lawsuit against CBS.There are a few clips of the skits and on-air sermonizing that got the show in hot water, but very few. Joan Baez's speaking on her imprisoned husband, the hippy commentator's drug references, Harry Belafonte singing &quot;Carnival&quot; to footage of the 1968 Chicago riots (it's never clear if that footage actually aired), and Pete Seeger singing &quot;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy and the Big Fool Says to Push On&quot; and a snippet of David Steinberg's biblical parodies are about it.

726789,A3NKSSHDJBE6T,B00007CVSP,Eric Marshall,"[0, 1]","Although I wasn't born in the 60's I can tell you from what I've learned that the years 1963 to 1974 (from Kennedy's murder in Dallas to Watergate and Gerald Ford's bogus ""the long national nightmare is over"" statement) was ""The Greatest Generation"" (sorry Tom Brokaw, you're not even close) and if pop culture was taken as artifacts ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" would be Exhibit A. Which is where ""Smothered"" comes in. As you know the story Tommy Smothers and brother Dick were a comedy team and used music for their routine. The turning point would come in 1966 when they appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and CBS was impressed by their performance they gave them their own variety show. T.S.B.C.H. first aired in January 1967 on CBS. No one gave them a chance considering that the network put them in the 9/8 PM Sunday timeslot against NBC's ""Bonzana"" and after the eye network's Sunday night powerhouse: ""The Ed Sullivan Show"". But four months later The Smothers' overtook ""Bonzana"" as the number one show in that slot and the Ponderosa crew had to go to another time spot. With this Tom and Dick upted the ante for the second season. And that's where the fireworks began: For much of 1967 and into 1968 the show made a mockery of politics and put on music artists that Ed's ""Really Big Shoe"" weren't going to touch (Buffalo Springfield, Janis Ian, Jefferson Airplane) and then came the show in which the brothers let Pete Seeger perform and when CBS executives heard this, they freaked out because they were aware that Seeger was still blacklisted for being a Communist. That of course, lead to the notorious clause they put on Tom and Dick in which every show was to be watched by the network for questionable content. The two sides agreed and it seemed to work. That all changed in April 1969 when CBS honchos were expecting the tape to come and it didn't. When the tape did come they called up Tom and Dick and told them the show was canceled. But it didn't stop there: NBC picked up the show the next year and promised the brothers they would be ""hands off"" and not ruin the show. Not surprisingly, the show failed and the peacock network dropped it. The magic (or was it black magic?) that The Smothers created was gone.I do remember watching some of the shows when it was on E! in 1993 and I was just astonished by what they were doing (where else could find Robert Kennedy talking about Pat Paulson?). I really want this DVD because me and my mother were talking on the phone the other night about the troubled state television is in right now (violence on ""CSI"", graphic sex scenes on ""Nip/Tuck"", and especially the writer's strike) and in the midst of this I brought up this subject. I just hope that Fred Silverman and all the others that were working at CBS in the late-60's have long since apologized to Tom and Dick for what they did and not knowing that TV would get worse in the next century. It's a worthy buy and if it's not a pop culture tragedy, then ""Smothered"" is a cautionary tale of the saying ""Don't kill the messenger, because you might learn something"".",4,A Real 60's Pop Culture Tragedy,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,3092,"['was', ""n't"", 'born', '60', 'can', 'tell', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'years', '1963', '1974', 'Kennedy', 'murder', 'Dallas', 'Watergate', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'bogus', 'long', 'national', 'nightmare', 'statement', 'was', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'sorry', 'Tom', 'Brokaw', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'close', 'pop', 'culture', 'was', 'taken', 'artifacts', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Comedy', 'Hour', 'would', 'be', 'Exhibit', 'A', 'Which', 'where', 'Smothered', 'know', 'story', 'Tommy', 'Smothers', 'brother', 'Dick', 'were', 'comedy', 'team', 'used', 'music', 'routine', 'turning', 'point', 'would', 'come', '1966', 'when', 'appeared', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'CBS', 'was', 'impressed', 'performance', 'gave', 'own', 'variety', 'show', 'T.S.B.C.H', 'first', 'aired', 'January', '1967', 'CBS', 'one', 'gave', 'chance', 'considering', 'network', 'put', '9/8', 'PM', 'Sunday', 'timeslot', 'NBC', 'Bonzana', 'eye', 'network', 'Sunday', 'night', 'powerhouse', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'four', 'months', 'later', 'Smothers', 'overtook', 'Bonzana', 'number', 'one', 'show', 'slot', 'Ponderosa', 'crew', 'had', 'go', 'time', 'spot', 'Tom', 'Dick', 'upted', 'ante', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'fireworks', 'began', 'much', '1967', '1968', 'show', 'made', 'mockery', 'politics', 'put', 'music', 'artists', 'Ed', 'Really', 'Big', 'Shoe', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'touch', 'Buffalo', 'Springfield', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'then', 'came', 'show', 'brothers', 'let', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'perform', 'when', 'CBS', 'executives', 'heard', 'freaked', 'out', 'were', 'aware', 'Seeger', 'was', 'still', 'blacklisted', 'being', 'Communist', 'course', 'lead', 'notorious', 'clause', 'put', 'Tom', 'Dick', 'show', 'was', 'be', 'watched', 'network', 'questionable', 'content', 'two', 'sides', 'agreed', 'seemed', 'work', 'changed', 'April', '1969', 'when', 'CBS', 'honchos', 'were', 'expecting', 'tape', 'come', 'did', ""n't"", 'When', 'tape', 'did', 'come', 'called', 'up', 'Tom', 'Dick', 'told', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'NBC', 'picked', 'up', 'show', 'next', 'year', 'promised', 'brothers', 'would', 'be', 'hands', 'not', 'ruin', 'show', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'show', 'failed', 'peacock', 'network', 'dropped', 'magic', 'was', 'black', 'magic', 'Smothers', 'created', 'was', 'gone.I', 'do', 'remember', 'watching', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'E', '1993', 'was', 'just', 'astonished', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'where', 'else', 'could', 'find', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'talking', 'Pat', 'Paulson', 'really', 'want', 'DVD', 'mother', 'were', 'talking', 'phone', 'other', 'night', 'troubled', 'state', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'violence', 'CSI', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Nip/Tuck', 'especially', 'writer', 'strike', 'midst', 'brought', 'up', 'subject', 'just', 'hope', 'Fred', 'Silverman', 'others', 'were', 'working', 'CBS', 'late-60', 'have', 'long', 'apologized', 'Tom', 'Dick', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'knowing', 'TV', 'would', 'get', 'worse', 'next', 'century', 'worthy', 'buy', 'not', 'pop', 'culture', 'tragedy', 'then', 'Smothered', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'messenger', 'might', 'learn', 'something']",N/A

When the SmoBro came to TV in 1967 I'd been a Naval officer for 10 years. When they were cancelled, I'd already resigned and was with the VVAW to ""protest U.S. foreign policy, specifically the war in Vietnam,"" in the words of my March 1968 resignation letter. Along with everyone else in the service, I got locked into active duty till the end of 1968--as officer in charge of all non-Nurse Corps women's recruiting for one of the largest Naval Districts. Tommy Smothers could have made a hilarious skit out of my moral dilemma.The Brothers had nothing to do with my change in attitude, which was already firm  by 1967, caused by analysis of history and current events, and shared by many military people.  The mass military resignations and refusals to fight in the field, from the air or from seagoing gun turrets were what brought the war to a close. (See ""SIR! NO SIR!"") But I surely did admire the SmoBros' kind of comedy--America's closest approach to Britain's brilliant non-commercial BBC comedy like ""Monty Python""--and sat on the edge of the chair waiting for the next puncture of hypocrisy and all other oppressions of genuine American ideals.  What a show it was.  Hip! hip! hurrah! for Tommy and Dickie. And booooos and hisses for all Bottom Line censors.After the intelligently satirical ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."", ""Laugh-In"", ""The Prisoner"" and, best of all, ""The Smothers Brothers"" I turned off commercial TV until ""Star Trek--The Next Generation"", ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""Max Headroom,"" which were all thought-provoking. After TNG ended I've stopped watching again. There've been a few rare exceptions, but since the 70s nearly everything on the commercial channels hasn't been worth wasting time on.  Some channels are unspeakable for the lies and slanders of their paid talking heads, and I refuse to watch so-called ""documentaries"" on cable.

726794,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00007CVSP,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[76, 80]","The 2002 documentary &quot;The Great Smothers Brothers Censorship Wars&quot; tells the story of how one of the most popular comedy variety shows on television in the Sixties went to far and was axed by the network.  Tom and Dick Smothers were a popular comedy and folk singing team: Tommy played both the guitar and the role of dullard while Dick played bass, sang the tenor parts in the arrangement, and tried unsuccessfully to keep his brother in line.  &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; first aired on February 5, 1967 going up against the #1 show on television, &quot;Bonanza.&quot;  The show finished 16th in the Nielsens and helped knock the Cartwrights out of the top spot the following season.  The show was a hit with younger viewers, who liked the irreverence of the show, which poked fun at every sacred cow they could find, aided and abetted by Pat Paulsen's &quot;editorials.&quot;As this documentary shows, the Smothers Brothers were having trouble getting things past the CBS censors almost from the start.  When Paulsen ran a joke campaign for the presidency, CBS kept him off the air fearing the real candidates would demand equal time, but the two key blows were an appearance by folk singing legend Pete Seger, who sang the Vietnam protest song &quot;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy&quot; and a pair of comedy &quot;sermons&quot; by comedian David Bernstein.  The technical reason for canceling the show was the failure to provide a tape on time to be cleared by the censors, but the motivation was clearly the anti-war, left-wing, and outspoken guest stars.  Tommy Smothers could yell about the First Amendment all he wanted, but in the end CBS replaced the show with &quot;Hee Haw,&quot; a lesson that was lost on no one at the time, which was, you should remember, Richard Nixon's first term in the White House.The documentary is fairly balanced, with talking heads from both sides, some of which will be recognizable to young viewers (e.g., Steve Martin, a Smo Bro writer).  For those of us who fondly remember Leigh French, Bob Einstein, and Mason Williams, this is a nice walk down memory lane, albeit through some bad times.  &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; was my favorite television show and when we left for Japan where my father was stationed it was the last television show I watched the night before the flight over.  The documentary does assume that you know about the comedy of the Smothers Brothers, because that takes a back seat to the behind the camera conflicts between CBS and Tommy Smothers.  Of course, in the television climate of today with what is available on cable the problems of the Smothers Brothers seems rather nostalgic, but there is still a chilling aspect to the tale when you recall the protests against the war, the assassinations of Kennedy and King, and the movement against dissent by the establishment at the end of that decade.The great irony of course was that it was CBS that would be the network that would decide to air &quot;All in the Family,&quot; which both ushered in an age of &quot;relevant&quot; prime time programming and constituted a de facto absolution for Tommy Smothers.  Unfortunately, when the Smothers Brothers were let back on the air (on NBC) they were produced by Joe Hamilton, Carol Burnett's husband, who tried to force them into the mold of his wife's successful comedy variety show.  By the time Tommy took over the producer's role the show was doomed by the half dozen shows he put on at the end were as fine as anything the format had seen and I am glad that when I met him several years ago I was able to tell him exactly that.",4,CBS vs. The Smothers Brothers in the court of public opinion,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,3642,"['2002', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Great', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Censorship', 'Wars', 'quot', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'comedy', 'variety', 'shows', 'television', 'Sixties', 'went', 'far', 'was', 'axed', 'network', 'Tom', 'Dick', 'Smothers', 'were', 'popular', 'comedy', 'folk', 'singing', 'team', 'Tommy', 'played', 'guitar', 'role', 'dullard', 'Dick', 'played', 'bass', 'sang', 'tenor', 'parts', 'arrangement', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'keep', 'brother', 'line', 'quot', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Comedy', 'Hour', 'quot', 'first', 'aired', 'February', '5', '1967', 'going', 'up', '1', 'show', 'television', 'quot', 'Bonanza.', 'quot', 'show', 'finished', '16th', 'Nielsens', 'helped', 'knock', 'Cartwrights', 'top', 'spot', 'following', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'hit', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'liked', 'irreverence', 'show', 'poked', 'fun', 'sacred', 'cow', 'could', 'find', 'aided', 'abetted', 'Pat', 'Paulsen', 'quot', 'quot', 'documentary', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'things', 'CBS', 'censors', 'almost', 'start', 'When', 'Paulsen', 'ran', 'joke', 'campaign', 'presidency', 'CBS', 'kept', 'off', 'air', 'fearing', 'real', 'candidates', 'would', 'demand', 'equal', 'time', 'two', 'key', 'blows', 'were', 'appearance', 'folk', 'singing', 'legend', 'Pete', 'Seger', 'who', 'sang', 'Vietnam', 'protest', 'song', 'quot', 'Waist', 'Deep', 'Big', 'Muddy', 'quot', 'pair', 'comedy', 'quot', 'sermons', 'quot', 'comedian', 'David', 'Bernstein', 'technical', 'reason', 'canceling', 'show', 'was', 'failure', 'provide', 'tape', 'time', 'be', 'cleared', 'censors', 'motivation', 'was', 'clearly', 'anti-war', 'left-wing', 'outspoken', 'guest', 'stars', 'Tommy', 'Smothers', 'could', 'yell', 'First', 'Amendment', 'all', 'wanted', 'end', 'CBS', 'replaced', 'show', 'quot', 'Hee', 'Haw', 'quot', 'lesson', 'was', 'lost', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'should', 'remember', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'first', 'term', 'White', 'House.The', 'documentary', 'fairly', 'balanced', 'talking', 'heads', 'sides', 'will', 'be', 'recognizable', 'young', 'viewers', 'e.g.', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Smo', 'Bro', 'writer', 'who', 'fondly', 'remember', 'Leigh', 'French', 'Bob', 'Einstein', 'Mason', 'Williams', 'nice', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane', 'bad', 'times', 'quot', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Comedy', 'Hour', 'quot', 'was', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'when', 'left', 'Japan', 'where', 'father', 'was', 'stationed', 'was', 'last', 'television', 'show', 'watched', 'night', 'flight', 'documentary', 'assume', 'know', 'comedy', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'back', 'seat', 'camera', 'CBS', 'Tommy', 'Smothers', 'course', 'television', 'climate', 'today', 'what', 'available', 'cable', 'problems', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'rather', 'nostalgic', 'still', 'chilling', 'aspect', 'tale', 'when', 'recall', 'protests', 'war', 'assassinations', 'Kennedy', 'King', 'movement', 'dissent', 'establishment', 'end', 'great', 'irony', 'course', 'was', 'was', 'CBS', 'would', 'be', 'network', 'would', 'decide', 'air', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'ushered', 'age', 'quot', 'relevant', 'quot', 'prime', 'time', 'programming', 'constituted', 'de', 'facto', 'absolution', 'Tommy', 'Smothers', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'were', 'let', 'back', 'air', 'NBC', 'were', 'produced', 'Joe', 'Hamilton', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'husband', 'who', 'tried', 'force', 'mold', 'wife', 'successful', 'comedy', 'variety', 'show', 'time', 'Tommy', 'took', 'over', 'producer', 'role', 'show', 'was', 'doomed', 'half', 'dozen', 'put', 'end', 'were', 'as', 'fine', 'anything', 'format', 'had', 'seen', 'am', 'glad', 'when', 'met', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'able', 'tell', 'exactly']",N/A

Look for dvds of the show itself.What this dvd gives you is an interesting and honest picture of how the mainstream and the counter-culture collided in the late sixties. Made over thirty years later, this documentary benefits from the distance; the parties involved are past fighting these battles and even Tommy Smothers can look back and see how he contributed to the troubles.Modern audiences may be struck by how wide a gap separated youth and mainstream culture at the time. I show this to students in a Pop Culture class and they have a hard time seeing how some of this could have been controversial (but they also laugh at the funny clips). If you were alive at the time and remember the controversy, this is a good, detailed look at exactly how the train came off the tracks and which steps put the Smothers and CBS on a collision course.All the major players are here-- Smothers, Bellafonte, Seeger, Mason Williams, Rob Reiner, as well as some of the suits (and watch for a young, dark-haired Steve Martin).

It was also necessary for Tom Smothers as an artist to pursue his personal (and his writers') vision. For that reason alone, this is a fascinating study of the times as well as personalities. Perhaps Dick Smothers said it correctly in a short scene (near the beginning) that if they had tried to say less in an episode they would've stayed on longer and been able to say just as much.My only wish is that there would've been more actual skits and songs from the show.

Even in the swinging sixties, a more 'conservative' generation was still in charge of running the networks.It also makes me ache that my generation and today has grown up without an equivalent act on television.

I learned so many things about the show that I never would have expected. I had no idea that Steve Martin was affiliated with it, that Tommy was such a huge force behind the show, or that it was anywhere near as political as it was.Filled with interviews from the Smothers Brothers and their affiliates, this documentary explores the power of the show and its demise. Aired during a very politically explosive time in US history, the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour reflected the times in a clever way. The brothers were clean cut products of the 1940s and 50s; their appearance was non-threatening. This allowed them to reach large audiences and attack controversial issues. Finally, their candidness and distaste for censorship did them in, but the show was ahead of its time.The clips included in this video are only teasers for what I'm sure the show really could be. It is unfortunate that it has never been formally released to the public.

And I remember one of the things that a commentator said during this show, that they had some out-of-the-ordinary guests, &quot;Not just Steve Lawrence and Edie Gormet, or Wayne Newton,&quot; as the guy said. The Who. Arlo Guthrie. Pete Seeger. These were guests they had.But, as Rob Reiner, one of the writers, and others commented, they were so...ordinary! The blazers, the short hair (earlier, anyway). They were so American that people couldn't resist. It was also &quot;wholesome&quot; humor, not, say, George Carlin, or Lenny Bruce. That's how they got on, to compete with the select hour which &quot;Bonanza&quot; had dominated for years.Then they did a bit--Tommy and Elaine Maye did--spoofing censors.  That's where the censorship began. The whole bit was removed from the show!In fact, the documentary shows that they were politicized by the censorship. The more they tried to say, the more they were challenged by CBS.For what it's worth, I think their comedy hour was the last variety show I could even stomach. Most weren't very good anyway. They either weren't funny or were pathetically predictable. This opened new doors. In fact, contemporary critics said if it weren't for the Smother Bros.' show, Saturday Night Live would probably have never been on the air.The timing of the show is just about right. Any shorter and I might have felt short changed. Too long and it may have gotten a little dry.
