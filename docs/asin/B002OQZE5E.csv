1281807,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B002OQZE5E,Anthony Pittore,"[1, 1]","After the death of his aunt, level-headed lawyer Bryan Becket (Timothy Daly of `Wings') moves into her old house to get things in order with her estate. After learning  the house was signed over to a paranormal research lab instead of to him, the unbelieving Bryan begins to delve into the mysteries of the house which his seemingly senile aunt believed to be haunted by malevolent forces. As the days pass and his experiences begin to mirror those of his aunt's, Bryan begins to question his own lack of beliefs and fights to find answers to what is happening in the house.When this film was first being released, the cast list certainly confused quite a few people. Tim Daly & Tom Arnold have both been fairly out of the limelight since the '90s, which was where the vast majority of their fame came & went. Therefore, it wasn't a huge surprise to see them working in the low-budget, straight-to-video horror sector which is many careers come to die (though Daly is a talented actor, I must say). However, added to those two was an up-and-coming A-list star: the beautiful Zo Salda&ntilde;a, who has been featured in such recent blockbusters as `Star Trek' and `Avatar.' She was really the selling point to many, and it really was a blessing to this film to have her because I'm sure it would've been seen by a great lot less than it even was.The film itself does, in fact, warrant a viewing though, with or without the inclusion of Zo. While haunted-house flicks are not rare to come by in any sector of horror, quality ones or even ones worthy of a watch are very hard to come by. Many horror fans would be hard-pressed to name more than a few solid haunt flicks from the past few years. The main reason for this, perhaps, is because the lack of focus on suspense & tension, which is a shame because those are the elements of good horror that don't require a big budget, just talented filmmakers. For this reason, it's always a real pleasure to find one that slips under the radar and can rise above the rest as a ""hidden gem."" It seems that `The Skeptic' can fill that role pretty well.From a technical standpoint, it is a cut above most straight-to-video horror films, which often have a very cheap & unappealing look to them. Newcomer writer/director Tennyson Bardwell (could there be a better name for a writer?) shows some real talent behind the camera, especially with the help of his editing team led by Ann Marie Lizzi. The script, though lacking in anything spectacularly fresh or original, keeps a pace that never races too fast or slows too much. It did not seem, at any point, to be boring, which can be a disastrous problem for many haunted-house horrors. The acting from Daly & Salda&ntilde;a was solid, as expected, even with Daly's character being painfully frustrating for much of the film. Then there was Tom Arnold who was his usual annoyingly over-the-top self. Even more annoying than his acting was the fact that he now sounds like he has a perpetually stuffed nose &agrave; la Chuckie Finster from `Rugrats.' Other than that, though, there isn't much to complain about. It does have quite a few chilling scenes and a couple of seriously creepy moments, helped along by both the visual teams and the script.Overall, the film is not perfect as anyone will see, but what it does right makes it worth the time. It is a solidly creepy & very effective haunted-house thriller with enough mystery, suspense, and scares to keep fans of the subgenre pleased for its 90 minute runtime.Final Verdict: 6.5/10-AP3-",3,A solidly creepy & effective haunt flick,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,3528,"['death', 'aunt', 'level-headed', 'lawyer', 'Bryan', 'Becket', 'Timothy', 'Daly', 'Wings', 'old', 'house', 'get', 'things', 'order', 'estate', 'learning', 'house', 'was', 'signed', 'paranormal', 'research', 'lab', 'instead', 'unbelieving', 'Bryan', 'delve', 'mysteries', 'house', 'seemingly', 'senile', 'aunt', 'believed', 'be', 'haunted', 'malevolent', 'forces', 'days', 'pass', 'experiences', 'begin', 'mirror', 'aunt', 'Bryan', 'question', 'own', 'lack', 'beliefs', 'fights', 'find', 'answers', 'what', 'happening', 'house.When', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'released', 'cast', 'list', 'certainly', 'confused', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'limelight', ""'90s"", 'was', 'where', 'vast', 'majority', 'fame', 'came', 'went', 'Therefore', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'surprise', 'see', 'working', 'low-budget', 'straight-to-video', 'horror', 'sector', 'many', 'careers', 'come', 'die', 'Daly', 'talented', 'actor', 'must', 'say', 'However', 'added', 'two', 'was', 'up-and-coming', 'A-list', 'star', 'beautiful', 'Zo', 'Salda', 'ntilde', 'who', 'been', 'featured', 'such', 'recent', 'blockbusters', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Avatar', 'was', 'really', 'selling', 'point', 'many', 'really', 'was', 'blessing', 'film', 'have', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seen', 'great', 'lot', 'less', 'even', 'was.The', 'film', 'fact', 'warrant', 'viewing', 'inclusion', 'Zo', 'haunted-house', 'flicks', 'are', 'not', 'rare', 'come', 'sector', 'horror', 'quality', 'ones', 'even', 'ones', 'worthy', 'watch', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'come', 'Many', 'horror', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'name', 'more', 'few', 'solid', 'haunt', 'flicks', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'main', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'lack', 'focus', 'suspense', 'tension', 'shame', 'are', 'elements', 'good', 'horror', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'big', 'budget', 'just', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'reason', 'always', 'real', 'pleasure', 'find', 'one', 'radar', 'can', 'rise', 'rest', 'hidden', 'gem', 'Skeptic', 'can', 'fill', 'role', 'pretty', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'cut', 'most', 'straight-to-video', 'horror', 'films', 'often', 'have', 'very', 'cheap', 'unappealing', 'look', 'Newcomer', 'writer/director', 'Tennyson', 'Bardwell', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'better', 'name', 'writer', 'real', 'talent', 'camera', 'especially', 'help', 'editing', 'team', 'led', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Lizzi', 'script', 'lacking', 'anything', 'spectacularly', 'fresh', 'original', 'pace', 'never', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'point', 'be', 'boring', 'can', 'be', 'disastrous', 'problem', 'many', 'haunted-house', 'horrors', 'acting', 'Daly', 'Salda', 'ntilde', 'was', 'solid', 'expected', 'even', 'Daly', 'character', 'being', 'painfully', 'frustrating', 'much', 'film', 'Then', 'was', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'who', 'was', 'usual', 'annoyingly', 'over-the-top', 'self', 'Even', 'more', 'annoying', 'acting', 'was', 'fact', 'now', 'perpetually', 'stuffed', 'nose', 'agrave', 'Chuckie', 'Finster', 'Rugrats', 'Other', 'though', ""n't"", 'much', 'complain', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'couple', 'seriously', 'creepy', 'moments', 'helped', 'along', 'visual', 'teams', 'script.Overall', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'anyone', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'right', 'time', 'solidly', 'creepy', 'very', 'effective', 'haunted-house', 'thriller', 'enough', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'scares', 'keep', 'fans', 'subgenre', 'pleased', '90', 'minute', 'runtime.Final', 'Verdict', '6.5/10-AP3-']",N/A

1281809,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002OQZE5E,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","This isn't exactly a quality horror film because there really wasn't any suspense so to speak.  At least the film *tried* having suspense, which is more than we can say for so many other impatient horror films and movie writers.As a result, any comparison to other, older suspense-builder horror films such as the Exorcist seems fair to me.Tom Arnold kind of stinks though.  He's not someone who normally impresses me a whole lot to be honest, but his performance here is just... really out of place.  Luckily he's not the main character in the film, and doesn't play any major role in the actual suspense portions of the story.I can't imagine what would have happened had Tom Arnold been the guy to play the main character!  It would have been enough to ruin the script, I believe.Anyway, let's not talk about what COULD have been and focus on what really happens.  A guy moves into his aunts old house after she dies, and it's a big, scary home indeed.  The point of interest is the upstairs closet in one of the bedrooms, where some very bad things took place at one point in time, and where much of the storyline takes place.For all the attempts at building up the suspense, the trade off is that there's hardly any actual terrifying things, like, EVER.  This means the atmosphere itself is kind of bland, and since quite a bit of the movie takes place in the daytime (for some reason) this makes the atmosphere even less suspenseful.Also the movie shouldn't have put ""haunted house"" in the description because it might mislead someone into thinking a ton of ghostly figures will appear constantly.  For the most part, it's just the main character walking around whenever he thinks he hears a noise, and then nothing really memorable comes of it.  Kind of disappointing.But again, at least the movies tries to include suspense, so for that, I didn't mind watching the film tonight.  The only part that's seriously scary is the ending where the guy sees a woman lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at him.  You'll see why this part is really frightening and effectively well done.Not a bad horror film at all.

They get paid specifically NOT to criticize big-budget films. Okay, now that my little rant is done, here goes:Tim Daly stars as Bryan Beckett, a sarcastic attorney who inherits an old house after his aunt dies. He immediately senses something is not right with the house, but refuses to acknowledge the presence of any ghost or paranormal event whatsoever. At first, he is easily able to logically explain away the strange events, but as the voices become more intense and ghosts actually begin to appear, Beckett runs out of ways to explain what is happening. He gets some help from the lovely and talented Zoe Saldana, who plays a psychic, and eventually learns the truth about the old house, his family secrets, and his hidden past.There are some refreshing elements here. Tom Arnold is excellent as Beckett's friend and law partner. Robert Prosky is typically fantastic as a jovial preacher, in his final film role. Daly does well in his expanded starring role, despite over-acting at times. Please note: this film is NOT for you if you like to see guts and gore and naked college girls running around getting their heads cut off. This film is more subtle. It makes you think a little, but in no way is it complicated like ""Memento."" It's just a good old-fashioned ghost story that relies more on mood than on cheap thrills.

""The Skeptic"" was just one of those experiences that excited our senses as we found ourselves engrossed in its eerie suspense, spine-tingling script, and good acting.Timothy Daly played by Bryan Becket is a successful lawyer and a realist, skeptical of supernatural explanations. He inherits a house from an aunt, and it is said to be haunted. He decides to stay there until the estate is settled. That and his estrangement from his wife provide the foundation of the plot. Even as he drives to the house, you want to tell Beckett's character to not go in there.  Daly starts to hear strange sounds and experience strange phenomena from his arrival. Not being able to explain it, he seeks the guidance of a priest who tells him there are supernatural as well as rational explanations. He also seeks the help of a psychiatrist who doesn't believe in the supernatural, but both leave Daly unsatisfied with rational explanations from what he is experiencing. If it isn't supernatural, is he going crazy? Are the strange sounds and experiences hallucinations or an extension of a fugue? When he meets Cassie, she tells him that the things he hears and sees doesn't mean the house is talking to him. She senses the house is haunted and advises Daly to leave.Edward Hermann plays Dr. Shepard, Daly's psychiatrist who fits one of the final pieces of the puzzle to what went on in the lawyer's childhood. Father Wymond played by the able actor Robert Prosky also knows something about his childhood that he won't accept. Cassie's character is played by Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is excellent and adds to the chilling experience yet to come.The haunting part is one of the last lines in the movie: ""Very good, mother.

1281816,A3JXBZ8F65100O,B002OQZE5E,Ferdy,"[0, 1]","This movie has a classic horror movie plot which begins when the main character played by Tim Daly inherits an old house left to him by his elderly aunt.  He decides to move into the house because he and his wife are having problems.  Several people give him cryptic warnings about there being ""something"" in that house.  Being a skeptic, he, of course, ignores the warnings. Soon, however, he is hearing noises and seeing things.  Is the house really haunted and if so, who is the ghost?  Some stand out actors in this movie include Zoe Saldana (who is outstanding as an eccentric young psychic) and Ed Herman.

Bryan is unemotional and analytical, an excellent lawyer; however, as a father and husband, these traits do not bode well with his wife or son, and Bryan decides to separate from them for a while and live in his aunt's now empty home.  While Bryan is already tallying up the money to be made on his aunt's expensive antiques, to his surprise, his law partner finds a hand written will made my Bryan's aunt, and she has left the house to an institute which researches the paranormal, among other things.  He visits the institute and confronts the head researcher, who doesn't seem the least bit interested in the house, but explains to Bryan why his aunt did mention the institute in her will.  It seems Bryan's aunt thought the house was haunted, an idea that Bryan cannot wrap his head around and deems utter nonsense.  The researcher agrees, he also does not believe in the supernatural and does his utmost to debunk the phenomenon through his research.  As Bryan takes up residence in the old home and begins to experience unexplained noises, voices, and sightings, the skeptic suddenly finds himself trying to convince others  that there is indeed something going on at his aunt's home.  Who really is the skeptic now?  It takes Bryan on a journey of rediscovering memories and events that could threaten to destroy his self-satisfied and successful life and career that he has built for himself, like a wall around him.  There are revelations upon revelations.  Bryan now knows what vulnerability is, and he also knows that his life can never be the same again.Tim Daly gives an amazing performance as Bryan, very credible and moving.  Tom Arnold was wonderful as his law partner, and his wife, played by Andrea Roth, was very convincing in portraying her frustration and deep love for her husband.  I did not like the role of the psychic played by Zoe Saldana.  She played it way too over the top and I half expected her to whip out some snakes and do a voodoo ritual, rather than just portray a concerned psychic who was there to help Bryan.  Her scenes were distracting and unnecessarily over dramatized, as when she bites the researcher's face and bears her claws at Bryan.  I didn't buy it for one minute.  And I didn't like her overt sexuality toward Bryan, it wasn't necessary to the story line at all.  However, I did enjoy the movie for the other performances and for the concept, although, in my opinion, the ending was misjudged and totally unsatisfying.  I will say no more on that.

A horror film written and directed by a guy who had previously only made a comedy, with a stable of has-been eighties and nineties stars as the principal cast--the outlook wasn't too great. But as the movie went on, I found myself getting involved enough to forget my initial misgivings. It's not a great film, but it's at least a good enough one to give a watch.Plot: Bryan Becket (&lt;em>Wings&lt;/em>' Tim Daly) is an arrogant, cocky lawyer who discovers that he's inherited the big old house he was raised in. He drives out to check on it with his pal Sully (&lt;em>Roseanne&lt;/em>'s Tom Arnold), and after inspecting it a bit, decides to move out and live in it instead of simply selling it. This doesn't sit too well with his wife (&lt;em>The Collector&lt;/em>'s Andrea Roth), especially when a delicious young parapsychology student, Cassie (&lt;em>Colombiana&lt;/em>'s Zoe Saldana), comes around claiming the house is haunted and offering to hang around until they figure out what's going on...Gets off to a pretty slow start. That the movie picks up when a couple of extra subplots are trimmed off abruptly is not a coincidence, and tells us the script could have done with another rewrite (Bryan's attitude would have made more sense had he been a bachelor in the first place...). It's one of those movies that reminds us why its older principals made it, however briefly, to the A list, and makes Saldana's star shine when she proves capable of holding her own in this cast. This is my favorite Tom Arnold performance in ages....Ironically, once the script gets stripped down to its component parts (roughly the last half of the film), which involves Saldana's character, a psychiatrist (the wonderful Ed Herrmann), and a priest (the late character actor Robert Prosky; this was his final film) all trying to impose their various beliefs upon Bryan as to what's happening to him, the movie really gets good. Unfortunately, by then, it's already left something of a sour aftertaste, but if you can get past that, and you don't necessarily mind an ambiguous ending (a lot of commenters on IMDB seem to really, really hate intentionally ambiguous endings...), you might enjoy this one as much as I came to. ***",3,Good performances highlight otherwise average little flick.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2359,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Skeptic', 'lt', '>', 'Tennyson', 'Bardwell', '2009', 'When', 'started', 'watching', 'lt', '>', 'Skeptic', 'lt', '>', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'horror', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'only', 'made', 'comedy', 'stable', 'has-been', 'eighties', 'nineties', 'stars', 'principal', 'cast', 'outlook', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'movie', 'went', 'found', 'getting', 'involved', 'enough', 'forget', 'initial', 'misgivings', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'least', 'good', 'enough', 'one', 'give', 'watch.Plot', 'Bryan', 'Becket', 'lt', '>', 'Wings', 'lt', '>', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'arrogant', 'cocky', 'lawyer', 'who', 'inherited', 'big', 'old', 'house', 'was', 'raised', 'out', 'check', 'pal', 'Sully', 'lt', '>', 'Roseanne', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'inspecting', 'bit', 'move', 'out', 'live', 'instead', 'simply', 'selling', ""n't"", 'sit', 'too', 'well', 'wife', 'lt', '>', 'Collector', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'especially', 'when', 'delicious', 'young', 'parapsychology', 'student', 'Cassie', 'lt', '>', 'Colombiana', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'around', 'claiming', 'house', 'haunted', 'offering', 'hang', 'around', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'pretty', 'slow', 'start', 'movie', 'up', 'when', 'couple', 'extra', 'subplots', 'are', 'trimmed', 'off', 'abruptly', 'not', 'coincidence', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'rewrite', 'Bryan', 'attitude', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'had', 'been', 'bachelor', 'first', 'place', 'one', 'movies', 'why', 'older', 'principals', 'made', 'however', 'briefly', 'A', 'list', 'Saldana', 'star', 'shine', 'when', 'capable', 'holding', 'own', 'cast', 'favorite', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'performance', 'ages', '.Ironically', 'once', 'script', 'stripped', 'down', 'component', 'parts', 'roughly', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'Saldana', 'character', 'psychiatrist', 'wonderful', 'Ed', 'Herrmann', 'priest', 'late', 'character', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'was', 'final', 'film', 'trying', 'impose', 'various', 'beliefs', 'upon', 'Bryan', 'what', 'happening', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'then', 'already', 'left', 'something', 'sour', 'aftertaste', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mind', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'lot', 'commenters', 'IMDB', 'seem', 'really', 'really', 'hate', 'intentionally', 'ambiguous', 'endings', 'might', 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'came', '***']",N/A

The film is about a house and its place in the life of an unemotional lawyer played by Tim Daly.  The house holds keys to his past and his present.  His life-long friends know secrets about him, his mother, and his present state which are revealed with much suspence as this lawyer faces his fears and past.",5,Very good movie -- must see,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,430,"['Skeptic', 'great', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'story', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'film', 'house', 'place', 'life', 'unemotional', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'house', 'keys', 'past', 'present', 'life-long', 'friends', 'know', 'secrets', 'mother', 'present', 'state', 'are', 'revealed', 'much', 'suspence', 'lawyer', 'fears', 'past']",N/A
1281833,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B002OQZE5E,William Amazzini,"[1, 1]","I read the synopsis of this movie and approached it as another man alone in a spooky old house experiencing strange occurrences type of film.  What emerged is an engrossing tale of past child abuse revolving around the life of an attorney who receives the news of his eccentric aunt's death and, wanting to claim her house for a money making venture, gets involved in unexplainable events within the house. The events chip away at his psyche to reveal a tragic past history involving his mother which he seriously suppressed since childhood.  You can approach this film either as a ghost story or psychological thriller but Writer, Producer, Director Tennyson Bardwell disavows any type of genre by presenting it straightforward allowing the skeptics and believers in the audience to make up their own minds.  The performances are excellent: Tim Daly as the attorney along with his partner played by Tom Arnold play their roles brilliantly especially Daly underplaying the tragedy until the crushing finale but the real scene stealer is an early performance from actress Zoe Saldana as Cassie the psychic.  She absolutely shatters the screen every time she appears and shows what a wonderful actress she would quickly become.  The beautiful photography by Claudio Rocha plays up the Saratoga Springs NY locales and the Victorian tableaus in and around the house making the film a truly remarkable 90 minute ride.  IFC who has given fans many interesting genre titles this past year releases it in a nice 1.85 transfer with crystal sound to make you jump at the appropriate times.  'THE SKEPTIC' is a true gem and whether you embrace it as a ghost story or psychological thriller, it never disappoints.",4,The Sins Of The Mothers,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,1701,"['read', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'approached', 'man', 'alone', 'spooky', 'old', 'house', 'experiencing', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'type', 'film', 'What', 'emerged', 'engrossing', 'tale', 'past', 'child', 'abuse', 'revolving', 'life', 'attorney', 'who', 'news', 'eccentric', 'aunt', 'death', 'wanting', 'claim', 'house', 'money', 'making', 'venture', 'involved', 'unexplainable', 'events', 'house', 'events', 'chip', 'away', 'psyche', 'reveal', 'tragic', 'past', 'history', 'involving', 'mother', 'seriously', 'suppressed', 'childhood', 'can', 'approach', 'film', 'ghost', 'story', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Writer', 'Producer', 'Director', 'Tennyson', 'Bardwell', 'type', 'genre', 'presenting', 'straightforward', 'allowing', 'skeptics', 'believers', 'audience', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'attorney', 'partner', 'played', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'play', 'roles', 'brilliantly', 'especially', 'Daly', 'underplaying', 'tragedy', 'crushing', 'finale', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'early', 'performance', 'actress', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Cassie', 'psychic', 'absolutely', 'screen', 'time', 'what', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'would', 'quickly', 'become', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'Claudio', 'Rocha', 'up', 'Saratoga', 'Springs', 'NY', 'locales', 'Victorian', 'tableaus', 'house', 'making', 'film', 'truly', 'remarkable', '90', 'minute', 'ride', 'IFC', 'who', 'given', 'fans', 'many', 'interesting', 'genre', 'titles', 'past', 'year', 'nice', '1.85', 'transfer', 'crystal', 'sound', 'make', 'jump', 'appropriate', 'times', 'SKEPTIC', 'true', 'gem', 'embrace', 'ghost', 'story', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'never', 'disappoints']",N/A
