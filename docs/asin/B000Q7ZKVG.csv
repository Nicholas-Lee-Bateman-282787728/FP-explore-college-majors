1074493,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,B000Q7ZKVG,David M. Goldberg,"[1, 1]","The symphonic music of Mahler is not easy to bring off successfully. Unexpected climaxes, quirky changes of tempo, and sudden lulls in the midst of accoustic storms abound in his works. The 6th Symphony is no exception; indeed its structure is less cohesive than most and it requires an exceptionally firm hand at the helm to steer the ship to a secure ending. Some conductors emphasize the drama at the expense of the poetry; others, speed and excitement at the cost of clarity; while it is tough to give the long adagio passages their requisite langour while preserving the onward flow of the melody. All of these pitfall Claudio Abbado skilfully avoids by choosing a sensible middle course throughout this 86 minute-long masterpiece. It is darker than most of the composer's other symphonies, lacking the contrasting presence of chorus or soloists that illuminate several of its companions, and it was apparently written just before a series of setbacks in his personal and professional life, including the death of his daughter and the onset of a severe cardiac illness that affected the rest of his career, events that are prophetically and ominously presaged by the thunderous hammer-blows of the last movement. The savage rythmns that open the first movement sound ominously like Fate on the march, followed by some ravishing passages from strings and harps vainly attempting to slow its progress. It may seem that such a consensual interpretation would be dull, bland, and lacking in contrasts, but this is never the case here. Abbado compels his players to seize every passage with full respect for its intrinsic character -- fear, pain, joy, beauty, exhileration -- while shaping the whole into a much greater entity than the sum of its parts, and all without reference to any score that I could detect on his podium. His contact with the members of the orchestra as a whole, and with the individual instrumentalists, was awesome and inspiring. A smile, a scowl, a wave of the hand, a strumming of the fingers, were all as important as the movements of the baton in eliciting the sounds he sought.Indeed, the rapport between players and conductor was unusually cordial, climaxing in the warmth with which he singled out the various instruments for rapturous applause at the termination of the performance. And what players they were! I have made only one visit to the Lucerne Festival in my youth (early 1960s) and the Festival Orchestra of the period was well-considered, but with nothing like the quality and reputation of the forces that Abbado has now mustered for the event: The Mahler Chamber Orchestra supplemented by members of two distinguished string quartets ( Alban Berg and Hagen ), and a panoply of instrumentalists from some of Europe's fines orchestras, including the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonics. The camera showed off their skills to great visual effect with ravishing photography that I have never seen surpassed in a DVD. The sound quality was consistently superb. The handsome auditorium received due recognition, and the presenced of a live audience added an electrifying atmosphere to a moving and satisfying musical experience. The accompanying booklet is minimalistic, and there are no extras beyond a series of trailers for other Abbado DVDs, but these I found highly intriguing in contrast to most such advertising in this medium. The 6th Symphony is my first Mahler DVD;I cannot wait to get my hands on others in the series.",5,A Mahler for all Seasons,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,3465,"['symphonic', 'music', 'Mahler', 'not', 'easy', 'bring', 'off', 'successfully', 'Unexpected', 'climaxes', 'quirky', 'changes', 'tempo', 'sudden', 'lulls', 'midst', 'accoustic', 'storms', 'abound', 'works', '6th', 'Symphony', 'exception', 'indeed', 'structure', 'less', 'cohesive', 'most', 'exceptionally', 'firm', 'hand', 'helm', 'steer', 'ship', 'secure', 'ending', 'conductors', 'emphasize', 'drama', 'expense', 'poetry', 'others', 'speed', 'excitement', 'cost', 'clarity', 'tough', 'give', 'long', 'adagio', 'passages', 'requisite', 'langour', 'preserving', 'onward', 'flow', 'melody', 'pitfall', 'Claudio', 'Abbado', 'skilfully', 'avoids', 'choosing', 'sensible', 'middle', 'course', '86', 'minute-long', 'masterpiece', 'darker', 'most', 'composer', 'other', 'symphonies', 'lacking', 'contrasting', 'presence', 'chorus', 'soloists', 'illuminate', 'several', 'companions', 'was', 'apparently', 'written', 'just', 'series', 'setbacks', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'including', 'death', 'daughter', 'onset', 'severe', 'cardiac', 'illness', 'affected', 'rest', 'career', 'events', 'are', 'prophetically', 'ominously', 'presaged', 'thunderous', 'hammer-blows', 'last', 'movement', 'savage', 'rythmns', 'first', 'movement', 'sound', 'ominously', 'Fate', 'march', 'followed', 'ravishing', 'passages', 'strings', 'harps', 'vainly', 'attempting', 'slow', 'progress', 'may', 'seem', 'consensual', 'interpretation', 'would', 'be', 'dull', 'bland', 'lacking', 'contrasts', 'never', 'case', 'here', 'Abbado', 'players', 'seize', 'passage', 'full', 'respect', 'intrinsic', 'character', 'fear', 'pain', 'joy', 'beauty', 'exhileration', 'shaping', 'whole', 'much', 'greater', 'entity', 'sum', 'parts', 'reference', 'score', 'could', 'detect', 'podium', 'contact', 'members', 'orchestra', 'whole', 'individual', 'instrumentalists', 'was', 'awesome', 'inspiring', 'smile', 'scowl', 'wave', 'hand', 'strumming', 'fingers', 'were', 'as', 'important', 'movements', 'baton', 'eliciting', 'sounds', 'sought.Indeed', 'rapport', 'players', 'conductor', 'was', 'unusually', 'cordial', 'climaxing', 'warmth', 'singled', 'out', 'various', 'instruments', 'rapturous', 'applause', 'termination', 'performance', 'what', 'players', 'were', 'have', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'visit', 'Lucerne', 'Festival', 'youth', 'early', '1960s', 'Festival', 'Orchestra', 'period', 'was', 'well-considered', 'nothing', 'quality', 'reputation', 'forces', 'Abbado', 'now', 'mustered', 'event', 'Mahler', 'Chamber', 'Orchestra', 'supplemented', 'members', 'two', 'distinguished', 'string', 'quartets', 'Alban', 'Berg', 'Hagen', 'panoply', 'instrumentalists', 'Europe', 'fines', 'orchestras', 'including', 'Berlin', 'Vienna', 'Philharmonics', 'camera', 'showed', 'skills', 'great', 'visual', 'effect', 'ravishing', 'photography', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'surpassed', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'consistently', 'superb', 'handsome', 'auditorium', 'received', 'due', 'recognition', 'presenced', 'live', 'audience', 'added', 'electrifying', 'atmosphere', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'musical', 'experience', 'accompanying', 'booklet', 'minimalistic', 'are', 'extras', 'series', 'trailers', 'other', 'Abbado', 'DVDs', 'found', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'contrast', 'most', 'such', 'advertising', 'medium', '6th', 'Symphony', 'first', 'Mahler', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'others', 'series']",N/A

However, in the extremely complex finale, I got the feeling the players were somewhat tired.  So I returned to the opening movement and I was shocked to hear the difference in sound.  In the first movement, the playing has this incredibly rich sound.  In the finale, the sound is strained and not very beautiful.  What sounds like a labor of love at first, sounds like just labor in the great finale.  And the solo horn (always of vital importance in Mahler) has some bad moments.

1074496,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B000Q7ZKVG,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This has been further reinforced by his set of performances held at Lucerne with his hand-picked orchestra constituting the Lucerne Festival orchestra. This very large orchestra, apart from containing musicians of outstanding individual abilities, also lays great stress upon their empathy and experience with the world of chamber music. Thus is achieved the unusual combination of orchestral size allied to individual and corporate sensitivity. This suits Abbado's particular vision of Mahler and this is apparent throughout this very fine performance which some would describe as close to definitive.Abbado has made two previous and successful recordings of this symphony for CD in 1979 with the Chicago Symphony and then in 2005. This latter recording with the Berlin Philharmonic was voted record of the year by the jury at the influential `Gramophone' magazine. The current recording was made in 2006 and differs little from the 2005 audio-only CD. Of course there is the undoubted huge advantage of actually seeing the interpretation unfold before our very eyes.This symphony is often considered to be Mahler's most tragic symphony and much has been made of the significance of the hammer blows incorporated in the music - the blows of fate. Tragic events of Mahler's life are associated with this and these are regularly referred to as the death of his young daughter, the diagnosis of his own fatal illness plus the loss of his job. Another possibility is the effect of unrest preceding the 1914 war. However all of these events came after the composition of the symphony which was first performed in 2006 and which had been written at a particularly happy time in Mahler's life. So how does Abbado see these conflicting situations?The first movement march comes over here as fairly jaunty rather than tragic. The cowbells take their place as depicting mountain scenery. Observation of Abbado's face shows delight, pleasure and encouragement. No sign of a tragic interpretation here. The second movement is essentially a peaceful and serenely melodic invention and yet again this is the impression we get from Abbado's body language. The scherzo follows and still the jaunty mood prevails. Abbado, in line with other conductor's reverses the order of these two central movements in order to balance the musical content more evenly within the context of the whole work. Mahler himself pondered over this balance before the final publication.The last movement brings a considerable change however. In this very long 30 minute movement the mood clearly darkens and Abbado's body language is altogether more sober. At this point it is reasonable to read tragedy into the work without really understanding the motive for its inclusion and the conclusion is certainly bleak. In this performance Abbado holds the audience in total silence for a remarkably extended period before turning to acknowledge applause. There can be no doubt that he sees this symphony as ending in tragedy. This is projected as a considerable contrast with the mood of the first 3 movements and is thus all the more powerful as a concluding statement.The generously spacious layout of the orchestra allows the camera work to succeed in providing both sensitive detail as well as panoramic views. This visual element makes a telling contribution as we are able to see the changing body language of the conductor and this adds to our understanding of the sounds he brings to our attention. The sound is presented in wide-ranging DTS 5.1 and stereo formats and captures all of this with admirable lucidity.In my opinion this is a clear contender for the full 5 stars and should give much pleasure and satisfaction to all purchasers of the recording.",5,A fine follow up to Abbado's '2005 CD Record of the Year' award for this symphony,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,3812,"['Abbado', 'enviable', 'reputation', 'being', 'one', 'world', 'finest', 'Mahler', 'conductors', 'been', 'further', 'reinforced', 'set', 'performances', 'held', 'Lucerne', 'hand-picked', 'orchestra', 'constituting', 'Lucerne', 'Festival', 'orchestra', 'very', 'large', 'orchestra', 'apart', 'containing', 'musicians', 'outstanding', 'individual', 'abilities', 'also', 'great', 'stress', 'empathy', 'experience', 'world', 'chamber', 'music', 'Thus', 'achieved', 'unusual', 'combination', 'orchestral', 'size', 'allied', 'individual', 'corporate', 'sensitivity', 'suits', 'Abbado', 'particular', 'vision', 'Mahler', 'apparent', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'would', 'describe', 'close', 'definitive.Abbado', 'made', 'two', 'previous', 'successful', 'recordings', 'symphony', 'CD', '1979', 'Chicago', 'Symphony', 'then', '2005', 'latter', 'recording', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'was', 'voted', 'record', 'year', 'jury', 'influential', 'Gramophone', 'magazine', 'current', 'recording', 'was', 'made', '2006', 'differs', 'little', '2005', 'audio-only', 'CD', 'course', 'undoubted', 'huge', 'advantage', 'actually', 'seeing', 'interpretation', 'unfold', 'very', 'eyes.This', 'symphony', 'often', 'considered', 'be', 'Mahler', 'most', 'tragic', 'symphony', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'significance', 'hammer', 'blows', 'incorporated', 'music', 'blows', 'fate', 'Tragic', 'events', 'Mahler', 'life', 'are', 'associated', 'are', 'regularly', 'referred', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'diagnosis', 'own', 'fatal', 'illness', 'loss', 'job', 'possibility', 'effect', 'unrest', 'preceding', '1914', 'war', 'However', 'events', 'came', 'composition', 'symphony', 'was', 'first', 'performed', '2006', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'particularly', 'happy', 'time', 'Mahler', 'life', 'how', 'Abbado', 'see', 'conflicting', 'situations', 'first', 'movement', 'march', 'over', 'here', 'fairly', 'jaunty', 'rather', 'tragic', 'cowbells', 'take', 'place', 'depicting', 'mountain', 'scenery', 'Observation', 'Abbado', 'face', 'shows', 'delight', 'pleasure', 'encouragement', 'sign', 'tragic', 'interpretation', 'here', 'second', 'movement', 'essentially', 'peaceful', 'serenely', 'melodic', 'invention', 'yet', 'again', 'impression', 'get', 'Abbado', 'body', 'language', 'scherzo', 'still', 'jaunty', 'mood', 'prevails', 'Abbado', 'line', 'other', 'conductor', 'order', 'two', 'central', 'movements', 'order', 'balance', 'musical', 'content', 'more', 'evenly', 'context', 'whole', 'work', 'Mahler', 'pondered', 'balance', 'final', 'publication.The', 'last', 'movement', 'considerable', 'change', 'however', 'very', 'long', '30', 'minute', 'movement', 'mood', 'clearly', 'darkens', 'Abbado', 'body', 'language', 'altogether', 'more', 'sober', 'point', 'reasonable', 'read', 'tragedy', 'work', 'really', 'understanding', 'motive', 'inclusion', 'conclusion', 'certainly', 'bleak', 'performance', 'Abbado', 'audience', 'total', 'silence', 'remarkably', 'extended', 'period', 'turning', 'acknowledge', 'applause', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'symphony', 'ending', 'tragedy', 'projected', 'considerable', 'contrast', 'mood', 'first', '3', 'movements', 'thus', 'more', 'powerful', 'concluding', 'statement.The', 'generously', 'spacious', 'layout', 'orchestra', 'camera', 'work', 'succeed', 'providing', 'sensitive', 'detail', 'as', 'well', 'panoramic', 'views', 'visual', 'element', 'telling', 'contribution', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'changing', 'body', 'language', 'conductor', 'understanding', 'sounds', 'attention', 'sound', 'presented', 'wide-ranging', 'DTS', '5.1', 'stereo', 'formats', 'admirable', 'lucidity.In', 'opinion', 'clear', 'contender', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'should', 'give', 'much', 'pleasure', 'satisfaction', 'purchasers', 'recording']",N/A

1074498,A289P7HMNTVBTX,B000Q7ZKVG,Mahlerinmyblood,"[1, 5]","I have never quite understood what led people to believe that Claudio Abbado was some sort of great Mahler guru. Don't get me wrong- he is a great conductor and I admire and respect him greatly. But his Mahler never really seems to rise to the level of ""soul touching"" that Lenny and very few others achieved. I purchased this DVD on the basis of the two reviews listed above even though the ""looks on the players faces"" ranks right up there with what kind of car they drove to the performance as far as judging any musical performance. But let's face it, as great as Lenny's performance, the video and audio quality lack everything that one would expect to find in a Blu-ray disc. So I bit. I normally do not review things, but I felt that, in this instance anyway, the other two reviews needed some balanced perspective.First of all, yes the video quality is superb. I would hope so for $35. And the audio quality is fine too, although hardly what I would call spine tingling. The hammerblows are sufficient but on the anemic side. Over all though, Abbado is clearly a fish out of water with the 6th (as he was in the 4th and 5th that I also have seen). His tempi for the most part are all wrong, especially in the gorgeous Adagio which he practically ruins beyond recognition. Abbados sense of balance is mystifying as well. Details that should be brought out are missing entirely, and other meaningless details are highlighted.So, it is an adequate performance, but that is about all. If you want to hear what I have always felt the definitive performance, see if you can find the Erich Leinsdorf/ Boston recording. It won't be easy to find. Leinsdorf was not only NOT considered a great Mahlerian, he hated his recording of the 6th. But it sails high above any of the others. Firmly in 2nd place would have to be Lennys performance with the NY Phil. Video wise, we have to settle for Lenny and Vienna. The video quality stinks, the audio quality is little better than that, but it is a soul searing performance. Don't waste your money on this Abbado 6th. But hey- it's your money (until the government takes it away I suppose) so if you want to find out for yourself, go for it. But don't say I didn't tell you so.",3,Great?

Mahler, in his mid forties, was in good health.Perhaps, at times, musical work of tragic character is not directly related to the mood of the writer. Here a tragic symphony is no more identifiable with the life of the composer than the first person actor of a novel or narrator of a poem is related with its author.The interpretation shown in this DVD is great.

1074500,AXLN36UV9KGXD,B000Q7ZKVG,Mr John Haueisen,"[10, 11]","Mahler's Sixth Symphony is a great way to see the benefits of Blu-ray technology.  The crystal-clear picture and enhanced sound are best shown off by a work like this.  You'll hear sounds you never heard, coming from each speaker.  I started to point out how well you can hear individual instruments that Mahler's 6th allows ""cameo solos,"" like the xylophone, tuba, timpani, harps, cymbals, French horn, and of course the cowbells and giant wooden block and hammer.  But then I noticed that all the horns and strings and woodwinds seemed to be getting cameos too.  This is such an unusual work that each instrument seems to get a chance to shine, and the Blu-ray technology enabled this beautifully.Be sure your neighbors are away if you turn up the volume.  Not only will you hear the distant cowbells, but the drums will threaten to shake the walls and floors.  My two little fox terriers left the room with their tails down--and they usually like Mahler!Don't let the subtitle ""Tragic"" make you think less of this Mahler symphony. Many Mahler enthusiasts agree that it is ""tragic"" only in the sense that, despite all our successes, sufferings and trials in life, mortality will claim us in the end.Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra do it again, turning in the best performance of Mahler's Sixth since Leonard Bernstein did it decades ago. For those familiar with Mahler's Sixth, yes, this includes two devastating hammerblows with a large wooden mallet and a resonating wooden box--finally these are hammerblows approaching the huge mallet used by Leonard Bernstein. I could rave on about how clearly you can see and hear each instrument as it plays its part in this giant symphony, but you can see it for yourself. The editors and photographers have done their work well in directing us to each performer as his instrument carries the theme.You don't need my word for it. Watch it, and you'll see the delight in the faces of the timpanist, Raymond Curfs or flautist, Jacques Zoon. Their joy at participating in such a magnificent work is not something they can hide.Again, the Blu-ray Mahler's sixth seems to help each instrument have its moment in the spotlight.  It's like having dozens of brilliant solo instruments telling a story in their own words, in concert.

I had all of the Mahler symphonies on CD, but must admit I appreciate Mahler much more now that I get to see the orchestra. The sound, video quality and direction are perfect. They call this the tragic symphony but for me it was pure joy. I have watched some Berstein performances on DVD and to date I will take Abbaddo or Thielmann anytime....Those old video recordings do detract from my enjoyment of the pieces....and my musical training simply is not able to tell if one performance exceeds another. I did get the Chailly Mahler symphonies 2,8 and 9 based on reviews....the rest by Abbaddo.",5,Must be seen to be heard,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,684,"['continue', 'be', 'awe', 'fine', 'performances', 'Mahler', 'symphonies', 'Abbaddo', 'had', 'Mahler', 'symphonies', 'CD', 'must', 'admit', 'appreciate', 'Mahler', 'much', 'more', 'now', 'get', 'see', 'orchestra', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', 'direction', 'are', 'perfect', 'call', 'tragic', 'symphony', 'was', 'pure', 'joy', 'have', 'watched', 'Berstein', 'performances', 'DVD', 'date', 'will', 'take', 'Abbaddo', 'Thielmann', 'anytime', '.Those', 'old', 'video', 'recordings', 'do', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'pieces', '.and', 'musical', 'training', 'simply', 'not', 'able', 'tell', 'one', 'performance', 'did', 'get', 'Chailly', 'Mahler', '2,8', '9', 'based', 'reviews', '.the', 'rest', 'Abbaddo']",N/A
