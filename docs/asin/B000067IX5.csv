702733,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000067IX5,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 5]","I remember my first bike.  It was a Huffy.  It didn't have a name and I believe my excitement for it only lasted one summer, but it did get me from point A to point B, and I will always remember it for those solid memories.  What would be my actions if during that one summer of joy my illustrious bike were to be stolen?  Would I bring about wrath and vengeance upon anyone that dared cross my path?  Probably not, but it would have been fun to have an adventure like the two boys in this film.To make it simple.  Boy is trained to be a courier.  Bike is given, but needs to be paid off.  Bike is nearly paid for when it is stolen.  Boy goes bonkers.  Change story.  New boy finds love with new (stolen) bike.  He makes more friends.  He is the rooster of the farm.  Then, these two boys meet.  Violence begets violence.  Boy looses girl.  Boy continues to loose job.  Violence ensues.  Cut to visionary ending about the life of a bike.Was this a documentary?""Beijing Bicycle"" kept my attention, but left me utterly confused as to who to root for.  For the first hour of the film, I found myself on the original boy's side, but somehow changed midstream, but then changed back, only to find myself apathetic towards the end.  This is not the consistency that I like my oatmeal.  A lumpy camera gave us a sympathetic eye towards both of our characters, leaving us with nobody to love or to hate.  I needed a definition with this film.  I wanted to root for one character and only one character.  By giving me passion for both I didn't really have any emotion towards the ending, which could have been quite dramatic.I loved the music.I loved the cinematography.I loved that it promoted smoking.I loved the characters - individually, but I needed a defined bad guy and a defined good guy.  Don't get me wrong, when Vader picks up the Emperor at the end of ""Jedi"", I felt sympathy for the bad guy - but think of what the film would have been like if the Emperor kissed Vader right before he fell.  That is the emotion happening with ""Beijing Bicycle"".Could I watch this film again? Absolutely, but I could not sit still.  I would know what was going to happen with our characters, I would know what feelings I would have for both of them by the end, and I would still find myself apathetic to any of their causes.  One is strong, while the other is weak.  It was like black vs. gray instead of black vs. white.  I would call this film a ""Study of Cinema's Gray Zone"".I will suggest this film to friends and family as a one time viewing.  It was a decent outing for a film about a bicycle, and would have no problems buying this DVD for my old Huffy that is still rotting away in the garage.  I think he would like it.What are my thoughts?I give this film an ""Ehhhhhhhhhggggggggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaa"", as I feel weight on my shoulders as I thumb the edge of this DVD's box.",3,Let me introduce you to my little friend ... my Huffy!,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,2868,"['remember', 'first', 'bike', 'was', 'Huffy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'name', 'believe', 'excitement', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'summer', 'did', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'solid', 'memories', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'actions', 'one', 'summer', 'joy', 'illustrious', 'bike', 'were', 'be', 'stolen', 'Would', 'bring', 'wrath', 'vengeance', 'anyone', 'dared', 'cross', 'path', 'Probably', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'have', 'adventure', 'two', 'boys', 'film.To', 'make', 'simple', 'Boy', 'trained', 'be', 'courier', 'Bike', 'given', 'be', 'paid', 'off', 'Bike', 'nearly', 'paid', 'when', 'stolen', 'Boy', 'bonkers', 'Change', 'story', 'New', 'boy', 'finds', 'love', 'new', 'stolen', 'bike', 'more', 'friends', 'rooster', 'farm', 'Then', 'two', 'boys', 'meet', 'Violence', 'begets', 'violence', 'Boy', 'girl', 'Boy', 'loose', 'job', 'Violence', 'ensues', 'Cut', 'visionary', 'ending', 'life', 'bike.Was', 'documentary', 'Beijing', 'Bicycle', 'kept', 'attention', 'left', 'utterly', 'confused', 'who', 'root', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'found', 'original', 'boy', 'side', 'somehow', 'changed', 'midstream', 'then', 'changed', 'back', 'only', 'find', 'apathetic', 'end', 'not', 'consistency', 'like', 'oatmeal', 'lumpy', 'camera', 'gave', 'sympathetic', 'eye', 'characters', 'leaving', 'nobody', 'love', 'hate', 'needed', 'definition', 'film', 'wanted', 'root', 'one', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'giving', 'passion', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'emotion', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'dramatic.I', 'loved', 'music.I', 'loved', 'cinematography.I', 'loved', 'promoted', 'smoking.I', 'loved', 'characters', 'individually', 'needed', 'defined', 'bad', 'guy', 'defined', 'good', 'guy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'when', 'Vader', 'up', 'Emperor', 'end', 'Jedi', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'bad', 'guy', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Emperor', 'kissed', 'Vader', 'right', 'fell', 'emotion', 'happening', 'Beijing', 'Bicycle', '.Could', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'Absolutely', 'could', 'not', 'sit', 'still', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'characters', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'feelings', 'would', 'have', 'end', 'would', 'still', 'find', 'apathetic', 'causes', 'One', 'strong', 'other', 'weak', 'was', 'like', 'black', 'vs.', 'gray', 'instead', 'black', 'vs.', 'white', 'would', 'call', 'film', 'Study', 'Cinema', 'Gray', 'Zone', '.I', 'will', 'suggest', 'film', 'friends', 'family', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'was', 'decent', 'outing', 'film', 'bicycle', 'would', 'have', 'problems', 'buying', 'DVD', 'old', 'Huffy', 'still', 'rotting', 'away', 'garage', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'are', 'thoughts', 'give', 'film', 'Ehhhhhhhhhggggggggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'feel', 'weight', 'shoulders', 'thumb', 'edge', 'DVD', 'box']",Beijing Bicycle

In the back of my mind, I said to myself you wanted to bulid upon your Asian cinema collection here is a movie to do so. I was not disappointed at all. It reminds me how close yet so far. The determination of this guy to recover his bicycle was funny and truly amazing. The student was a selfish guy who purchased the bike from the black market. He stole money from his parents because of a promise, sometimes parents can not always follow up on good intentions. The scene where the student and his(school boy thugs) er I mean classmates. These young boys had the moxies to try and negotiate someone else's property cracked me up. Neither one was willing for the other to have the bike. An agreement to share the bike was made.

702735,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B000067IX5,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[2, 4]","""This is city folk. Not happy with a big house,"" says a character in Beijing Bicycle, spying an attractive female in an afar window.  ""Look, she's wearing another dress,"" he then says, 30 seconds later.  ""You know her?"" his friend incredulously asks.  ""She comes for soy sauce all the time.""  ""A city girl"" (who sports 3 different outfits in under a minute and a half). "" A big pile of clothes. So wasteful!  Stop looking,"" say the shop-owner after his friend has taken his 3rd look).  ""It's not good for your health.""  Some days later, off camera we hear heels on the pavement as these two guys sit on the stoop of this guy's little shop.  We see only her shoes (and skirt of her dress) until she reaches the shop, not seeing her head to toe until she is almost out of camera shot returning from whence she came, bottle of soy sauce in hand.  It's just over an minute-long scene, but it's refreshingly free of any dialogue, and is marvelously effective; not to say intriguing.  Hollywood's book of filmmaking presupposes that a director must hook his/her viewers by no later than 10-12 minutes into a film if it is to resonate with viewers---something this film does with the above mentioned scene at just under the aforementioned 12 minute mark.  Then we follow this friend who can't imagine how some live so well, as he struggles in his job as a bicycle messenger...until he loses said bicycle, and thus his livelihood, which panics him.  Here is where the film works especially well, too.  Unlike in ""The Bicycle Thief"" (the famous Italian made film of some decades ago), we really feel for this hapless fellow & can understand how important a seemingly inconsequential bike really is to him.  Life's struggle really is apparent in Beijing Bicycle, but the film pushes its luck so that by the end of the film we are glad we don't have to concern ourselves with thoughts of this guy's bicycle anymore.  But the film is worthy of watching, nevertheless (especially to get a feel for the life led by many Chinese even now---I viewed this film and wrote this while in China myself, incidentially).  Interestingly too, the attractive woman from above makes two more appearances in this film in proximity to these two guys, but says not a word to either; nor they to her.  These scenes really bespeak the longing for a better life that the Chinese folks in this film struggle to make for themselves.  If you want to learn something about present-day China, and watch a better than average film, to boot, than give Beijing Bicycle a try.

702739,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000067IX5,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[4, 4]","This is one movie where you just want to jump in and do something. My story is like some others I know; I kept seeing this movie on the shelf at the video store. I thought it looked ok but not interesting enough to spend money on. Thank god it finally came on TV and I think it was worth the wait. The movie is about a young man named Guei who is looking for work in Beijing. He's lucky and finds a delivery company and is happy about his new job. Guei is given a bike to complete his deliveries, after working for a while he will earn enough to buy the bike. After running into some trouble with a delivery and being extremely late picking up a package he returns to get his bike only to find out it was stolen. Guei then gets fired because the package was received late and now he has no bike. Guei is so determined that he asks his boss if he finds the bike could he have his job back. His boss is so impressed by this that he says yes.Ok so maybe so far the story may not appeal that much but then another main character is bought in. Jian is a not so spoiled but very bratty school kid and somehow he ends up with a new bike that looks exactly like Guei's. In the movie everyone has a bike and they're very important. Jing's father is not bringing in enough money to get him a bike. His father believes in his son but just can't afford the bike so this kid is planning on doing anything to get a bike. Guei finally catches up with Jing and the two start a little war over the bike. The big problem is that Jing has a bunch of friends and Guei has none so you can imagine what happens every time Jing catches him.Maybe some people will find this movie a bit funny I just couldn't. Guei played by Cui Lin has a presence and face that really makes you feel his pain. To some the movie may sound crazy but this guy did nothing wrong and ends up in a series of truly unfortunate events. He needs the bike to get money to live and the punk kid wants a bike to impress girls and ride around with his friends. Honestly the real genius lies in these characters, what some people may hate I believe are great performances by Cui Lin. He is a powerful character and looks and acts very realistic, trust me you'll feel him.I did find the movie very frustrating at times cause the repetitive beatings got on my nerves. Also I think the director messed up by focusing a greater majority of time on Jing's life when Guei's could've developed and become and really become the sole of the story and not the bike itself. Guei is the more powerful actor and character. Overall this was a decent film that could've been better. The dialogue was not so good, when you expect or really want someone to speak nothing happens and your left with too many minutes of silence. There are a few unexpected things that come and a little bit of comedy. Once again that acting made this movie what it is and Cui Lin one great actor. Would I watch this movie again? Maybe not for a while but it is definitely worth at least one watch.",4,I Hate It & Love It,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,3006,"['one', 'movie', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'jump', 'do', 'something', 'story', 'others', 'know', 'kept', 'seeing', 'movie', 'shelf', 'video', 'store', 'thought', 'looked', 'ok', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'spend', 'money', 'Thank', 'god', 'finally', 'came', 'TV', 'think', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Guei', 'who', 'looking', 'work', 'Beijing', 'lucky', 'delivery', 'company', 'happy', 'new', 'job', 'Guei', 'given', 'bike', 'complete', 'deliveries', 'working', 'while', 'will', 'earn', 'enough', 'buy', 'bike', 'running', 'trouble', 'delivery', 'being', 'extremely', 'late', 'picking', 'up', 'package', 'get', 'bike', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'stolen', 'Guei', 'then', 'fired', 'package', 'was', 'received', 'late', 'now', 'bike', 'Guei', 'so', 'determined', 'boss', 'bike', 'could', 'have', 'job', 'back', 'boss', 'so', 'impressed', 'so', 'maybe', 'so', 'far', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'much', 'then', 'main', 'character', 'bought', 'Jian', 'not', 'so', 'spoiled', 'very', 'bratty', 'school', 'kid', 'somehow', 'up', 'new', 'bike', 'exactly', 'Guei', 'movie', 'everyone', 'bike', ""'re"", 'very', 'important', 'Jing', 'father', 'not', 'bringing', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'bike', 'father', 'son', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'bike', 'so', 'kid', 'planning', 'doing', 'anything', 'get', 'bike', 'Guei', 'finally', 'up', 'Jing', 'two', 'start', 'little', 'war', 'bike', 'big', 'problem', 'Jing', 'bunch', 'friends', 'Guei', 'none', 'so', 'can', 'imagine', 'what', 'time', 'Jing', 'catches', 'him.Maybe', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'bit', 'funny', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'Guei', 'played', 'Cui', 'Lin', 'presence', 'face', 'really', 'feel', 'pain', 'movie', 'may', 'sound', 'crazy', 'guy', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'up', 'series', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'bike', 'get', 'money', 'live', 'punk', 'kid', 'bike', 'impress', 'girls', 'ride', 'friends', 'Honestly', 'real', 'genius', 'characters', 'what', 'people', 'may', 'hate', 'believe', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'Cui', 'Lin', 'powerful', 'character', 'very', 'realistic', 'trust', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'him.I', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'very', 'frustrating', 'times', 'cause', 'repetitive', 'beatings', 'got', 'nerves', 'Also', 'think', 'director', 'messed', 'up', 'focusing', 'greater', 'majority', 'time', 'Jing', 'life', 'when', 'Guei', 'could', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'become', 'really', 'become', 'sole', 'story', 'not', 'bike', 'Guei', 'more', 'powerful', 'actor', 'character', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'dialogue', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'when', 'expect', 'really', 'want', 'someone', 'speak', 'nothing', 'happens', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'minutes', 'silence', 'are', 'few', 'unexpected', 'things', 'come', 'little', 'bit', 'comedy', 'Once', 'again', 'acting', 'made', 'movie', 'what', 'Cui', 'Lin', 'one', 'great', 'actor', 'Would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'Maybe', 'not', 'while', 'definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'watch']",Beijing Bicycle

702742,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B000067IX5,L. J Nary,"[5, 6]","This film was about a boy from the country coming to the city and landing a really good job as a bicycle messenger. He gets a really cool bike to use and finds out they will take money out of his earnings to pay the bike off and make it his. This bike symbolizes so much to this youth, it is his ticket out, his chance to make something of himself. The bike is a status symbol, not just to him, but to all kids his age, therefore making it valuable and worth taking. Thats exactly what happens, the bike gets stolen. Because the owner marked it with a personalized scratch, he feels he can find it somehow in this large city of bikes. His boss doubts him and fires him with the promise that he will hire him back if he finds it, this is done in a real sarcastic way without any compassion. The story continues on with his search, retrieval, combative takeover and negotiation, all in that order. It sounds somewhat boring but the emotional scenes add a punch to this movie. There is not alot of needless dialog and we experience the film more with the visual images and the good acting of the two main characters, both boys. I really liked this film. I would like to go to this city and experience it fully. The rhythm of the film moves along just like a bike moving down a meandering road.

702743,A7P7ZBSC10APW,B000067IX5,Michael J. Covino,"[1, 1]","Yet another masterful drama from China, this is a story of poetic irony.Guei, the son of a poor street merchant, moved with his father from the country to the city of Beijing, China's capital. Guei is hired by a delivery service that seems to make a habit of hiring uneducated country boys and is immediately assigned the task of studying the streets of Beijing to make deliveries. He is offered a bike to tackle the task and is promised to hold ownership over his wheels once he has earned 600 yuan.For the first quarter of the movie you see this boy undergo the task of earning 600 yuan with much difficulty. It seems every delivery has its obstacles and challenges. Guei is estranged, far from what he is familiar with, and it is mostly his unworldly and nave disposition that gets him into trouble, with no fault of his own. And yet circumstance demands he gets punished for his mistakes. The director demonstrates again and again how everyone in the city is unsympathetic and indifferent toward Guei's ignorance.But in the end, he finally makes his 600 yuan and is about to claim ownership over a possession other than his clothes: a Silver Mountain Bike. Unfortunately, it gets stolen during a final delivery and this is when the story really begins. The unknown thief pawns the bike and another boy, Jian, buys it with stolen money.Meanwhile, Guei gets fired from his job and out of desperation, he makes a deal with his boss that if he were to somehow locate and reclaim the bike, he'd get his job back. So now Guei undertakes a mission of locating a bike in a city where bikes on the streets are as numerous as there are cars in New York City. And countless quarrels and violent encounters become inevitable between the two teenage boys once Guei discovers who has his well earned bike.When Jian comes into the picture, you see the life of another boy who is so ashamed of his poor livings in the city that he delivers a sad display of denial whenever he leaves his home, by dressing in a coat and tie whenever he associates with his friends, forgetting for a few hours that his housing is no more than a tight, miserable hovel. And his new mountain bike only reinforces this fantasy of wealth he plays every time he is with his friends. He starts dating an upscale girl and his dream evolves.But much like the story of Guei, everything slowly but surely falls apart for poor Jian. Guei takes his bike back from Jian. Jian's girl leaves him for a much better looking man. Jian's little fantasy world is shattered when his father shamefully reveals that he is a thief and the bike was bought with stolen money. And the loss of such small sentimental possessions brings each teenager to a breaking point and it is interesting to see how the two very different, yet similar boys handle the situation.A story of irony. I am not sure exactly what it is trying to imply, if anything at all, but if I were to guess, I would guess that this story is about a city that is inhabited by people who dream of better lives which they can never have. Even a side character, a pretty young girl which always buys soy sauce from Guei's father has everyone convinced that she is rich and the owner of a big house she is always seen in, but with a sad expression. Later in the movie it is revealed that she was just the house keeper and she got fired for wearing her employer's expensive dresses, playing out a fantasy much like the social fantasy Jian played before his whole world came crashing down.Either that, or the story is about a bike that has a curse on it because whoever touches the damn thing is overrun by the worse luck imaginable. Even the pretty girl that always bought soy sauce from Guei's father got touched by the bike when Guei was racing it home.For China travelers and vacationers, this movie would really stimulate old nostalgia. You get great scenes and stills of the ancient city, both the modern and the old segments, like the Hutongs where the two boys dwell.",4,Masterful Drama,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,3978,"['Yet', 'masterful', 'drama', 'China', 'story', 'poetic', 'irony.Guei', 'son', 'poor', 'street', 'merchant', 'moved', 'father', 'country', 'city', 'Beijing', 'China', 'capital', 'Guei', 'hired', 'delivery', 'service', 'make', 'habit', 'hiring', 'uneducated', 'country', 'boys', 'immediately', 'assigned', 'task', 'studying', 'streets', 'Beijing', 'make', 'deliveries', 'offered', 'bike', 'tackle', 'task', 'promised', 'hold', 'ownership', 'wheels', 'once', 'earned', '600', 'first', 'quarter', 'movie', 'see', 'boy', 'task', 'earning', '600', 'yuan', 'much', 'difficulty', 'delivery', 'obstacles', 'challenges', 'Guei', 'estranged', 'far', 'what', 'familiar', 'mostly', 'unworldly', 'nave', 'disposition', 'trouble', 'fault', 'own', 'yet', 'circumstance', 'demands', 'punished', 'mistakes', 'director', 'again', 'again', 'how', 'everyone', 'city', 'unsympathetic', 'indifferent', 'Guei', 'ignorance.But', 'end', 'finally', '600', 'yuan', 'about', 'claim', 'ownership', 'possession', 'other', 'clothes', 'Silver', 'Mountain', 'Bike', 'Unfortunately', 'stolen', 'final', 'delivery', 'when', 'story', 'really', 'unknown', 'thief', 'bike', 'boy', 'Jian', 'stolen', 'money.Meanwhile', 'Guei', 'fired', 'job', 'desperation', 'deal', 'boss', 'were', 'somehow', 'locate', 'reclaim', 'bike', ""'d"", 'get', 'job', 'back', 'So', 'now', 'Guei', 'mission', 'locating', 'bike', 'city', 'where', 'bikes', 'streets', 'are', 'as', 'numerous', 'are', 'cars', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'countless', 'quarrels', 'violent', 'encounters', 'become', 'inevitable', 'two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'once', 'Guei', 'discovers', 'who', 'well', 'earned', 'bike.When', 'Jian', 'picture', 'see', 'life', 'boy', 'who', 'so', 'ashamed', 'poor', 'livings', 'city', 'sad', 'display', 'denial', 'whenever', 'home', 'dressing', 'coat', 'tie', 'whenever', 'friends', 'forgetting', 'few', 'hours', 'housing', 'more', 'tight', 'miserable', 'hovel', 'new', 'mountain', 'only', 'fantasy', 'wealth', 'time', 'friends', 'dating', 'upscale', 'girl', 'dream', 'evolves.But', 'much', 'story', 'Guei', 'everything', 'slowly', 'surely', 'apart', 'poor', 'Jian', 'Guei', 'bike', 'back', 'Jian', 'Jian', 'girl', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'man', 'Jian', 'little', 'fantasy', 'world', 'shattered', 'when', 'father', 'shamefully', 'thief', 'bike', 'was', 'bought', 'stolen', 'money', 'loss', 'such', 'small', 'sentimental', 'possessions', 'teenager', 'breaking', 'point', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'yet', 'similar', 'boys', 'handle', 'situation.A', 'story', 'irony', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'trying', 'imply', 'anything', 'were', 'guess', 'would', 'guess', 'story', 'city', 'inhabited', 'people', 'who', 'dream', 'better', 'lives', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'Even', 'side', 'character', 'pretty', 'young', 'girl', 'always', 'soy', 'sauce', 'Guei', 'father', 'everyone', 'convinced', 'rich', 'owner', 'big', 'house', 'always', 'seen', 'sad', 'expression', 'Later', 'movie', 'revealed', 'was', 'just', 'house', 'keeper', 'got', 'fired', 'wearing', 'employer', 'expensive', 'dresses', 'playing', 'out', 'fantasy', 'much', 'social', 'fantasy', 'Jian', 'played', 'whole', 'world', 'came', 'crashing', 'down.Either', 'story', 'bike', 'curse', 'whoever', 'damn', 'thing', 'overrun', 'worse', 'luck', 'imaginable', 'Even', 'pretty', 'girl', 'always', 'bought', 'soy', 'sauce', 'Guei', 'father', 'got', 'touched', 'bike', 'when', 'Guei', 'was', 'racing', 'home.For', 'China', 'travelers', 'vacationers', 'movie', 'would', 'really', 'stimulate', 'old', 'nostalgia', 'get', 'great', 'scenes', 'stills', 'ancient', 'city', 'modern', 'old', 'segments', 'Hutongs', 'where', 'two', 'boys', 'dwell']",Beijing Bicycle

This movie was made in Beijing and it explored the uneasy relationships between the city people and out-of-towners who are going there for better job prospects and thus, better life.  The story revolved around this country boy who secured a job as a courier boy and he was presented with a state-of-the-art bicycle which meant to facilitate him in his job and to portray the image of his company.  He meant to work to a certain level to pay off his bike and when he was on the verge of doing so, his bike got stolen and naturally, he lost his job.  Due to his determination and stubborness, the boss agreed that should he manage to find the bike back, he would get his job in return.  Then, we were introduced to yet another character, the person who was using his bike.  Did he actually steal his bike or did he buy the bike from vendor who stole it?  Along the way, we got to catch a glimpse of the alleyway lifestyle called ""hutong"" and how the downtrodden lived their lifestyle.  Both of them loved the same bike wholeheartedly.  One needed it because it's his livelihood & the other person wanted it for his lifestyle.  Can you imagine what would happen when both of their lives collided?  Sparks and fireworks ensued, and the ending was a spectacular climax with quite an explosive ending.  Furthermore, there were other subplots which displayed of us the mentality of people from different social stratas, and attitudes of mainland Chinese when push comes to shove.

While Jian's claim seems phony--since he purchased stolen goods--he and his bully friends want to invalidate Guei's claim, by force if necessary.

702752,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000067IX5,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 0]","I saw bits and parts of this film last night on TV and decided to check it out again on dvd.  It is quite surprising that a movie about a boy losing his bicycle can be compelling. It is a harrowing account of innocence lost and honestly, it is a bit brutal. It is a tale of a young man and his lost bike.Plot synopsis partially derived from back cover:Set in modern-day Beijing, this powerful and evocative drama depicts, in brilliant detail, the daily struggle that the millions of citizens of Beijing face day in and day out. When a young man, Guei, arrives in Beijing from a rural village he finds a job as a delivery boy. Discovering that must make 60 deliveries before he can pay for the loaned silver mountain bike which he needs for his work, he sets about to become the most efficient and diligent worker in his team. However, when he has almost finished paying his debt, his world is smashed by the discovery that the bike has been stolen. After a night spent running all over the city, he eventually spots a young man riding the bike. But when Jian, the new owner, claims to have bought the bicycle at a market, Guei enters into an often power struggle that will lead to violence and humiliation. In order to resolve his plight he must find the determination to fight for what is rightfully his.The film is directed by Wang Xiaoshuai, he makes a realistic vision of what goes on in his native land. There are metaphors aplenty in this little film and some use of potent symbolisms here. The movie begins with a sweet ""coming of age"" drama that is symbolized by Guei's joy in riding a bike. After his bike gets stolen, the gloom and dark side of adulthood shows its face.  Innocence is doomed; it becomes lost, while brutality, envy, and arrogance become more of a necessity or figurehead. This is all symbolized when Guei first takes his bike back. The bicycle I believe symbolizes Guei and Jian's soul (more of Guei's) or rather their transformation from optimistic innocence into their realization of the (sometimes) disappointing reality of life.The film's main premise is actually a bit darker than one might expect. It has the potential to totally depress its viewers. If you didn't get the symbols, one might think that the film is too simple because the film does focus  on two young men do going back and forth stealing the bicycle back from each other. It may get a bit repetitive. However, the film's message is actually not that simple. It also portrays Guei a gutsy, resourceful young man and totally committed to his cause while Jian is more of a whining, overbearing brat who depends on others. Two human characteristics are represented.Thankfully, even with its very significant shift in tone, the director manages to pull off some lighter moments with pretty girls Zhao Xun and Gao Yuanyuan. They give us a break in the testosterone laden violence that makes up most of the film by brightening up the proceedings.VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Clean and bright video transfer with good colors. The transfer isn't perfect, it has minor edge enhancements. 2.0 surround track in Mandarin is sufficient for this type of film.Parting thoughts:Although a lot of people may think Jian's actions in the final act is illogical, but I think his irrationality is why it hits more at home. Who says teenagers are rational or logical? BEIJING BICYCLE'S unflinching and realistic climax is dead on. In reality, even nice guys like Guei end up taking the fall for the arrogant Jians of the world. Sadly, this is cold fact.Recommended!
