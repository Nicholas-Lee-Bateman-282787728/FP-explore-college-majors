Sandra Bullock and Chris O'Donnell have wonderful and natural chemistry but the story seems inaccurate and forced.

424042,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304458932,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","I half expected to loathe this movie before I sat down to watch it, so I can't really complain that I was let down or that it proved an utter disappointment.  Just by looking at the front of the DVD I knew this was going to be a very substandard film.  Don't get me wrong entirely; I like Sandra Bullock, I won't lie.  For some reason I find myself drawn to her despite the fact that she's not really the greatest actress out there and time and time again she chooses the worst role for her career, but I still love her and will watch anything she's in just to watch it (watch something like `Two Weeks Notice' or `While you were Sleeping' and you'll instantly understand why I love her).  Chris O'Donnell on the other hand is not someone I'm even remotely drawn to nor do I care to watch anything he attaches himself to.  All that said, I sat down to watch `In Love and War' because my wife remembered liking it years ago and I can safely say when it was all over she had changed her opinion of this waste of a film.Biopic's are actually one of my favorite genre's of film.  I love to see real life displayed in an interesting and entertaining way.  The life of Earnest Hemingway could have been very interesting and entertaining had the cast and script been nailed down a little tighter.  I actually have much hope to see Hemingway's story done right next year when James Gandolfini takes on the lead role in the upcoming biopic.  Here though O'Donnell really adds no light or layers to his character and thus does Hemingway a huge disservice, painting him as immature and unlikable.  I had so much trouble understanding why these two people were so drawn to each other.  Bullock may be miles ahead of O'Donnell but that only goes to further prove how terrible O'Donnell is here, for Sandra herself is mediocre at best.The film follows Hemingway as he embarks on an affair with a Red Cross nurse right years his elder.  Even with its focus on this part of his life it could have broadened better and became more than just a poorly constructed love story.  It had plenty of potential and judging by the director Attenborough's other work it's almost embarrassing to place this in the list.  In fact `Shadowlands' is one of my favorite biopic's for it truly fleshes out the people we're supposed to be caring about.  `In Love and War' does nothing of the sort.  It plays out like a made for TV movie, one that you would never waste your time actually watching.  There are a few scenes that are touching, all of which deal with other characters, but they are far from enough to rescue this film from mediocrity.  In the end, `In Love and War' does nothing for me besides help me to realize that sometimes you can judge a book, or in this case a film, by its cover.",1,With everything so substandard there's really no reason to give this a chance...,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,2763,"['half', 'expected', 'loathe', 'movie', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'proved', 'utter', 'disappointment', 'Just', 'looking', 'front', 'DVD', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'substandard', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'entirely', 'like', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'reason', 'find', 'drawn', 'fact', 'not', 'really', 'greatest', 'actress', 'there', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'worst', 'role', 'career', 'still', 'love', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', 'just', 'watch', 'watch', 'something', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'were', 'Sleeping', ""'ll"", 'instantly', 'understand', 'why', 'love', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'someone', ""'m"", 'even', 'remotely', 'drawn', 'do', 'care', 'watch', 'anything', 'said', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Love', 'War', 'wife', 'remembered', 'liking', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'when', 'was', 'had', 'changed', 'opinion', 'waste', 'film.Biopic', 'are', 'actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'genre', 'film', 'love', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'displayed', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'way', 'life', 'Earnest', 'Hemingway', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'had', 'cast', 'script', 'been', 'nailed', 'down', 'little', 'tighter', 'actually', 'have', 'much', 'hope', 'see', 'Hemingway', 'story', 'done', 'right', 'next', 'year', 'when', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'lead', 'role', 'upcoming', 'biopic', 'Here', ""O'Donnell"", 'really', 'light', 'layers', 'character', 'thus', 'Hemingway', 'huge', 'disservice', 'painting', 'immature', 'unlikable', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'why', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'so', 'drawn', 'other', 'Bullock', 'may', 'be', 'miles', 'ahead', ""O'Donnell"", 'only', 'further', 'prove', 'how', 'terrible', ""O'Donnell"", 'here', 'Sandra', 'mediocre', 'best.The', 'film', 'Hemingway', 'affair', 'Red', 'Cross', 'nurse', 'right', 'years', 'elder', 'Even', 'focus', 'part', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'broadened', 'better', 'became', 'more', 'just', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'love', 'story', 'had', 'plenty', 'potential', 'judging', 'director', 'Attenborough', 'other', 'work', 'almost', 'embarrassing', 'place', 'list', 'fact', 'Shadowlands', 'one', 'favorite', 'biopic', 'truly', 'out', 'people', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'caring', 'Love', 'War', 'nothing', 'sort', 'out', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'waste', 'time', 'actually', 'watching', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'touching', 'deal', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'enough', 'rescue', 'film', 'mediocrity', 'end', 'Love', 'War', 'nothing', 'help', 'realize', 'sometimes', 'can', 'judge', 'book', 'case', 'film', 'cover']",In Love and War 1996  VHS

A no-no by many accounts, the attempt by Richard Attenborough to recount the  story of Ernest Hemingway and his love affair with a WWI nurse starts as  something promising. Yet, the promise is broken in the first four minutes,  and the viewer is left to dwindle among the every-so-long plot, which seems  to have no sense of balance. While the movie may be accurate as far as the  real story goes, it is certainly not entertaining enough.

424047,A3M3FG82ZE1J8I,6304458932,"Ed N ""Ed""","[29, 31]","Richard Attenborough's story of the relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Anges von Kurowsky (the inspiration behind the novel A Farewell to Arms) is recounted in this film.  It is truly an epic film, covering the last year of the First World War, during which time Hemingway was injured while a member of the Red Cross, to his meeting and blossoming love for Kurowsky, to the pensive, melancholy conclusion to their relationship after the war.The film has a rich, sweeping feel to it.  Attenborough does a wonderful job at direction, blending the gorgeous cinematography (from Italian battlefields to Venician waterways) with the loving, at-times heart-wrenching musical score.  However, the film is not manipulative, as most recent romance films are.  Instead, it is allowed to unfold slowly and naturally, and it has a more honest feel to the characterizations than you find in most mainstream Hollywood films.On its initial release, one of the main complaints about the film was the unusual casting of Chris O'Donnell as Hemingway and Sandra Bollock as Kurowsky.  In actuality, Bollock gives a very commendable performance, and I believe this film shows her best acting to date.  In most of her other films, she just plays Sandra Bollock with a different name, but here, she suppresses her usual idiosyncrasies and creates a true character.  While I enjoyed a lot of her other films (Speed, While You Were Sleeping), this is really her best and most underrated performance.  O'Donnell is somewhat less successful - it is hard to imagine him as a young Hemingway, and he seems like an anachronistic Boy Wonder.  His mannerisms don't seem to fit with a 1910s mentality.  However, he is not terrible, as some reviewers might have you believe.  He delivers a decent performance; in fact, if you drop any pre-conceived notions of the real Ernest Hemingway and try to view O'Donnell's character as just another spunky youth caught in the excitement of wartime, his performance works well in the context of the film.Personally, I like this film a lot.  It's gorgeous, it's romantic, and it feels like a sweeping epic.  If you enjoy films like The English Patient or A Room with a View, you'll enjoy this film.Just a few words about the DVD, which I bought....this is an essentially bare-bones DVD.  There are the usual small extras (subtitles, trailer, cast notes) but nothing else.  You can choose to view it as widescreen or full-screen.  But there is no commentary or documentary...So, if you like romantic films, give this film a chance....you may be surprised at how it slipped by your notice.

I got a very good price on it and sat down to watch it one evening when I was sick with the flu. I never like anything when I have the flu.  But, I fell under the spell of it right away. Keeping in mind that WWI was the bloodiest war in history with the most suffering in the trenches and the most horrendous loss of life, I thought all that was well represented without it being too gory.  Knowing as much as I do about Hemingway, I could well imagine that this is a true portrayal of how he was at the age of l8. Smartass, egotistical, clueless, handsome, charming. Chris O'Donnell fit the role perfectly. Those who think he did not are thinking of Hemingway as he was when he was older, not this ""kid"". All of the cast were wonderful. I was particularly impressed by Mackenzie Astin. I wondered if he was the son of Patty Duke Astin as I seemed to see a resemblance and when I googled him I saw that indeed he is. While I'm sure the movie is not absolutely factually true, I think it comes close and it is the way I prefer to believe that it happened.  It is a very believable telling of the story with everything you could ask for in a romantic tragedy.  I wonder if this experience and the way it ended did, indeed, haunt Hemingway the rest of his life. Certainly something haunted him. After all, he never wrote a story about a happy man. All of his heroes are tragic jaded figures. I've often wondered why Sandra Bullock has not been cast in more dramatic roles. She has been wasted on light romantic comedies.  I was amazed at her performance in ""Infamous"" as Harper Lee. Could hardly believe what I was seeing.  And, she is wonderful in this movie. Absolutely believable all the way. And looks lovely.

It is a sad love story based upon the first love of Ernest Hemmingway.Chris O'Donnell plays the young Hemmingway as a young American adventurer seeking excitement in northern Italy during the end of the first world war as a corpsman. He would rather be a soldier but he is too young and did not make it through the physical so he signs up for the Red Cross. While seeking excitement up on the battle line when he is supposed to be serving coffee behind the lines, he distinguishes himself by heroism as the trench is overrun and is wounded in the process. That brings him to a hospital where he meets the nurse who enraptures him.Sandra Bullock plays the nurse. She is competent, caring and considers herself too old for the young Hemmingway. Still, she is attracted to him and fights a losing battle against his ""charm"". Meanwhile, just about everyone else wants her attentions as well. She finds herself being torn in differing directions by her heart on the one hand and her intellect on the other.What makes this film difficult is that Sandra's character of the nurse is a very likeable person. O'Donnell's Hemmingway manages to be likeable as well except when his arrogance and vanity get in the way; I'm talking about Hemmingway's, not O'Donnell's. You get through this film thinking that she is just too good for him and that he doesn't deserve her. You also get a bit angry at her treatment of him at some points.Love stories have to have a bit of conflict to make them interesting. This one has more than it's share.

The lady brings a  &quot;real people&quot; effect to her roles. We'll see her accepting that  little gold statue one of these years. The film isn't any blockbuster; as a  war movie, it's fair. As a romance flick, it's OK. As a commentary on  Hemingway, O'Donnell isn't the one to bring life to the crusty, alcoholic,  arrogant, would-be patriarch (if he could stay family-oriented long enough)  that was &quot;Papa&quot; Ernest.

They make me go all warm & gooey inside. And when you're not feeling too great, you can curl up and enjoy. There's hardly any violence - it's set at the end of WWI, there has to be a little violence, but that's all confined to the start - it has two great actors playing the parts, and it's set in beautiful countryside. What more could you want?I've read a few of the reviews about this, and I have to disagree with nearly every person (sorry). You're not getting the movie really, are you? It's a love story. There are no complicated plots to follow. No twists and turns in the story. Hell, you don't even need to be that smart to watch this movie. And I'm certainly nothing of the sort in that department! Which is probably why I like these movies. You don't need to think much about them, and they're perfectly easy to follow.There are some great love scenes in this, although there are is no graphic, mind-blowing sex. It's simple of how Agnes & Ernie eventually become a proper couple in the most romantic of places - a brothel. And then they have a ""waltz"" together, which is so romantic.But the build up to their relationship can bring a little tear to the eye. (I told you I was a soppy cow) Whether it's Ernie telling Agnes that he loves her the first time he sees her, in a voice that will make me anyway go weak at the knees, or when he tries to comfort her after Jimmy dies. All are totally romantic. And other reviews say that there's no build up to their relationship, it's all over very quickly, but what they're forgetting - this was during a war, no one had time for quickness. Life's too short.The finale is really sad. If you haven't seen it, then I'm not going to be the one to spoil it for you, but it's a real heart-breaker. Things could have been so different only if ... I'll stop there!After watching this movie, it's got me interested in Ernest Hermingway's work, so that'll be something for me to keep my eye out for. I wouldn't say his work exactly, but probably the story of his life, and why losing Agnes made him so bitter. Plus, the fact he killed himself in 1961, and really, never got over losing Agnes. It would be quite interesting to read.

Why do I say this? After seeing the film in 8/97 (just after visiting the War Museum in the Isonzo Valley in Kobarid, Slovenia) I went to the library and checked several out books on Hemingway's life. The film is false, except that Hemingway was a Red Cross volunteer in the Piave Valley and was accidentally wounded there. A product of Teddy Roosevelt's era, he went home to Illinois and walked around his neighborhood wearing an Italian officer's cape that he'd bought. One was supposed to be brave, and survive as a winner. One nice thing about the film: shots of Vittorio Veneto (more accurately, the old city known as Seravalle before the end of WWI) which is beautiful and is not recommended in tourist guide books. My wife and I spent 2 of the best days of our month-long Wanderung over the Alps in this region in '89. Finally, Hemingway himself was not Hollywood-style-sloppy: according to the books I consulted, he wrote so accurately historically and geographically that some Italian historians believed he'd been in the Isonzo Valley in the Slovenian Alps where the worst fighting of WWI between Italians and Austrians took place. He never visited the region. Frankly, it's a crime to let Hollywood teach 'history' under the guise of reckless, careless, entertainment. Also, for those who believe that war os glorious, I strongly recommend the War Museum (photos of men with half-shot-away faces, and worse).",2,"5 stars, were it at all true..",1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1522,"['Very', 'charming', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'concoction', 'history', 'totally', 'invented', 'concoction', 'Why', 'do', 'say', 'seeing', 'film', '8/97', 'just', 'visiting', 'War', 'Museum', 'Isonzo', 'Valley', 'Kobarid', 'Slovenia', 'went', 'library', 'checked', 'several', 'out', 'books', 'Hemingway', 'life', 'film', 'false', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'Red', 'Cross', 'volunteer', 'Piave', 'Valley', 'was', 'accidentally', 'wounded', 'there', 'product', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'era', 'went', 'home', 'Illinois', 'walked', 'neighborhood', 'wearing', 'Italian', 'officer', 'cape', ""'d"", 'bought', 'One', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'brave', 'survive', 'winner', 'One', 'nice', 'thing', 'film', 'shots', 'Vittorio', 'Veneto', 'more', 'accurately', 'old', 'city', 'known', 'Seravalle', 'end', 'WWI', 'beautiful', 'not', 'recommended', 'tourist', 'guide', 'books', 'wife', 'spent', '2', 'best', 'days', 'month-long', 'Wanderung', 'Alps', 'region', ""'89"", 'Finally', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'not', 'Hollywood-style-sloppy', 'according', 'books', 'consulted', 'wrote', 'so', 'accurately', 'historically', 'geographically', 'Italian', 'historians', 'believed', ""'d"", 'been', 'Isonzo', 'Valley', 'Slovenian', 'Alps', 'where', 'worst', 'fighting', 'WWI', 'Italians', 'Austrians', 'took', 'place', 'never', 'visited', 'region', 'Frankly', 'crime', 'let', 'Hollywood', 'teach', ""'history"", 'guise', 'reckless', 'careless', 'entertainment', 'Also', 'who', 'believe', 'war', 'os', 'glorious', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'War', 'Museum', 'photos', 'men', 'half-shot-away', 'worse']",In Love and War 1996  VHS
