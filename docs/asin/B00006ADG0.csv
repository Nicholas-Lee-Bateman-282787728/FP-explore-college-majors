709067,A3Q2V5V8PGRYIB,B00006ADG0,"Amazon Customer ""Dave Lake""","[0, 0]","This is another amazingly beautiful film from the contemporary (Persian) Truffaut. Although the Rahmat character does not utter a single word throughout the film, the viewer is drawn into her struggle and captivated by Lateef's love. In the end, Lateef, a boy who has very little by western standards, sees how much more he has than the Afghan refugee workers at this Iranian construction site. He sees in an instant the hardship faced by this voiceless, powerless young girl and eventually gives up everything to protect and express love for her. Without ever speaking to her he ensures that she will somehow survive and reach her homeland. The interactions between Lateef and Rahmat tend to become less direct and more voyeuristic as the story unfolds and even this cynical western viewer was left believing that Lateef could sacrifice his identity (literally) to save a young woman who would never do anything for him. This is a love story so powerfully told that we needed none of the gimmicks of western filmmaking, nor even dialogue to believe an incredible story. Majidi has found some great actors, and there are some well crafted situations, but primarily he tells his stories through visual depictions of astounding pain and desperation superimposed on amazing cinematography. Viewers eventually learn that the girl's real name is ""Baran"" which also means rain in Farsi, and scenes filled with the sight and sound of coming rain highlight the bleak situation for the Afghan workers at the construction site. Majidi plays with images and symbols like this throughout his films and they are a joy to uncover. This is visual poetry.

709069,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B00006ADG0,Cecily Champagne,"[2, 2]","Baran is a beautiful film that, oddly enough, primarily takes place at a construction site in Iran.  The plot is simple and sweet; the characters are well-developed; the cinematography is often stunning ... Baran has all the makings of a great film, and it is, indeed, very enjoyable.There were 2 things that I especially liked about this movie.  First of all, Baran is the first Iranian film I've seen, and I was grateful for a glimpse into a culture that I know very little about.  I thought Majid Majidi - the director's - portrait of Iranian and Afghan-refugee workers was at once lovely and painful.  Specifically, it is somewhat difficult to view the conditions that the characters live and work in - and yet - the film in no way asks for sympathy.  It is simply telling a story, and the characters happen to work low-paying, back-breaking jobs.  That is their reality.  Also worth noting, the entire movie does not take place at a dirty, grimy job-site.  The main character, a teenager named Latif, leaves on several excursions.  These scenes are especially beautiful.  Even if this film lacked plot and characters (which it, thankfully, does not), I would have to give it some credit for the aesthetic quality of these scenes.The second thing that I especially liked about this movie was the way it was able to make a very innocent and restrained gesture seem provocative.  There is a footprint in the mud toward the end of the movie that is - somehow - an evocation of sexual and emotional longing.  There is another scene, during which a male and a female pick up a basket of food that has spilled, and though their hands never touch, it is one of the most erotic cinematic moments I think I've ever witnessed.Worth noting - Baran moves rather slowly.  I wouldn't say it's boring, but it's certainly languid.  There also seem to be a few problems with the flow of scenes.  I could be wrong, but occasionally, I found myself disoriented when it would cut abruptly from one moment to the next.  But this is really a trivial observation.  Overall, Baran is a very nice film.  If not profound, it's at least quietly beautiful.",4,"a quiet film that deals with suffering, love and sacrifice",1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,2132,"['Baran', 'beautiful', 'film', 'oddly', 'enough', 'primarily', 'place', 'construction', 'site', 'Iran', 'plot', 'simple', 'sweet', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'cinematography', 'often', 'stunning', 'Baran', 'makings', 'great', 'film', 'indeed', 'very', 'enjoyable.There', 'were', '2', 'things', 'especially', 'liked', 'movie', 'First', 'Baran', 'first', 'Iranian', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'grateful', 'glimpse', 'culture', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'thought', 'Majid', 'Majidi', 'director', 'portrait', 'Iranian', 'Afghan-refugee', 'workers', 'was', 'once', 'lovely', 'painful', 'Specifically', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'view', 'conditions', 'characters', 'live', 'work', 'yet', 'film', 'way', 'sympathy', 'simply', 'telling', 'story', 'characters', 'happen', 'work', 'low-paying', 'back-breaking', 'jobs', 'reality', 'Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'dirty', 'grimy', 'job-site', 'main', 'character', 'teenager', 'named', 'Latif', 'several', 'excursions', 'scenes', 'are', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'Even', 'film', 'lacked', 'plot', 'characters', 'thankfully', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'aesthetic', 'quality', 'scenes.The', 'second', 'thing', 'especially', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'very', 'innocent', 'restrained', 'gesture', 'seem', 'provocative', 'footprint', 'mud', 'end', 'movie', 'somehow', 'evocation', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'longing', 'scene', 'male', 'female', 'pick', 'up', 'basket', 'food', 'spilled', 'hands', 'never', 'touch', 'one', 'most', 'erotic', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'noting', 'Baran', 'rather', 'slowly', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'boring', 'certainly', 'languid', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'few', 'problems', 'flow', 'scenes', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'occasionally', 'found', 'disoriented', 'when', 'would', 'cut', 'abruptly', 'one', 'moment', 'next', 'really', 'trivial', 'observation', 'Overall', 'Baran', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'not', 'profound', 'least', 'quietly', 'beautiful']",Baran
709070,A3I6DTU1MS2W1Y,B00006ADG0,"Corn Soup ""sick of irony""","[7, 7]","This is my favorite of Majidi's movies.  It combines the sweetness and gentleness of his Children of Heaven (1987)with an objective look at lower and lower middle class Iranian society, and the impact of the infusion of immigrant Afghani workers into that mix.  It also shows, and this is probably going to be lost on the most Western viewers (it certainly was for me until I visited Majidi's website), some of the underlying tensions between Iranians of different backgrounds.  Among the groups represented are Kurds, Azeris, and Lurs.One of the things that makes this film so touching is how the main character, Lateef, is transformed from a shirking, irresponsible and selfish young boy into a man through his love and sympathy for a young Afghani refugee, Baran.  Although it may sound unusual that this love affair develops with perhaps no more than five or six words spoken between Baran and Lateef, what happens on screen seems completely understandable and convincing.There is one extremely powerful and startling image that Majidi uses towards the end of the movie that represents the untranscendable social division between the two.  That is the snapping of Baran's burkha over her head as she and Lateef part for the last time.  Never has that particular symbol seemed so intrusive and unfair in a film to me before.  This time it was not for any political or religious reasons.  Rather it was especially cruel because it divided Baran from Lateef permanently.",5,Majidi's Best,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1471,"['favorite', 'Majidi', 'movies', 'sweetness', 'gentleness', 'Children', 'Heaven', '1987', 'objective', 'look', 'lower', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'Iranian', 'society', 'impact', 'infusion', 'immigrant', 'Afghani', 'workers', 'mix', 'also', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'lost', 'most', 'Western', 'viewers', 'certainly', 'was', 'visited', 'Majidi', 'website', 'underlying', 'tensions', 'Iranians', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'groups', 'represented', 'are', 'Kurds', 'Azeris', 'Lurs.One', 'things', 'film', 'so', 'touching', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'Lateef', 'transformed', 'shirking', 'irresponsible', 'selfish', 'young', 'boy', 'man', 'love', 'sympathy', 'young', 'Afghani', 'refugee', 'Baran', 'may', 'sound', 'unusual', 'love', 'affair', 'perhaps', 'more', 'five', 'six', 'words', 'spoken', 'Baran', 'Lateef', 'what', 'screen', 'completely', 'understandable', 'one', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'startling', 'image', 'Majidi', 'end', 'movie', 'untranscendable', 'social', 'division', 'two', 'snapping', 'Baran', 'burkha', 'head', 'Lateef', 'part', 'last', 'time', 'Never', 'particular', 'symbol', 'seemed', 'so', 'intrusive', 'unfair', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'religious', 'reasons', 'was', 'especially', 'cruel', 'divided', 'Baran', 'Lateef', 'permanently']",Baran

It is fairly realistic ; well enough to engage empathy for the characters.The Turk is, in fact, such a love-sick buffoon.

709072,A2A0U27BHHWOES,B00006ADG0,G. Bestick,"[7, 7]","This is a low-key but affecting story about a young man learning to love.Seventeen-year-old Latif works at a construction site for a friend of his father.  He's all hormones and bumptiousness, quick to laugh, and quick to pick fights with the older workers who toss jibes at him.  Many of his co-workers are Afghani immigrants who have left their war-torn country looking for a better life.  Latif is in charge of the kitchen, preparing meals and serving tea to the workers.  When one of the Afghani workers falls out a window and breaks his ankle, he sends his son Rahmat to take his place, since the family desperately needs the money.  This boy isn't strong enough for heavy labor, so the foreman puts him in the kitchen in place of Latif.Enraged, Latif loses no opportunity to torment Rahmat, until the day he sees the lad furtively combing out his long, black hair and realizes Rahmat is a girl, a beautiful one at that.  Latif goes from bitter to smitten, and takes to protecting Rahmat from the other workers.  He even risks jail to keep her from being picked up by the Immigration officers.  When the foreman is forced to lay off the Afghani workers, Latif's new love disappears back into her country neighborhood.  Latif uses all his spare time to find her, and all his money to help her dirt-poor family. Through all of this, he never actually talks to Rahmat, or spends any time with her.  Loving her though, transforms him from a callow youth into a compassionate, even noble, young man.Baran presents a type of love we in western societies don't usually experience.  Latif's behavior towards Rahmat is fervent, self-sacrificing, and abstract.  The idea of his love for her seems to drive him more than the prospect of actually interacting with her.  Part of this is surely cultural.  At the movie's end, just when it seems that they're about to talk, she throws a buhrka over her head and turns away to her father's truck.  Latif is left with a hair pin she dropped and the image of her footprint in the mud, soon washed away by heavy rains.  You can imagine how this intense, abstract emotion could be transformed in young men into a willingness to die for the abstract idea of a perpetual afterlife.Hossein Abedini gives an energetic but emotionally shaded performance as Latif.  Actress Zahra Bahrami doesn't speak one word for the entire movie, but conveys all of Rahmat's feelings and yearnings through her lustrous black eyes.  Director Magid Majidi does a great job conveying the dust and sweat of hard labor - there's a particularly wrenching scene where Rahmat and other women find work lifting heavy boulders out of a cold stream.  Without romanticizing, he also shows us the bonds that form among poor working men.I've also seen Majidi's film Children of Heaven, about a brother and sister in a poor neighborhood in Tehran, and would recommend it highly.",4,Iranian Love Story,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2878,"['low-key', 'affecting', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'learning', 'love.Seventeen-year-old', 'Latif', 'construction', 'site', 'friend', 'father', 'hormones', 'bumptiousness', 'quick', 'laugh', 'quick', 'pick', 'fights', 'older', 'workers', 'who', 'toss', 'jibes', 'Many', 'co-workers', 'are', 'Afghani', 'immigrants', 'who', 'have', 'left', 'war-torn', 'country', 'looking', 'better', 'life', 'Latif', 'charge', 'kitchen', 'preparing', 'meals', 'serving', 'tea', 'workers', 'When', 'one', 'Afghani', 'workers', 'out', 'window', 'breaks', 'ankle', 'son', 'Rahmat', 'take', 'place', 'family', 'desperately', 'money', 'boy', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'heavy', 'labor', 'foreman', 'kitchen', 'place', 'Latif.Enraged', 'Latif', 'opportunity', 'torment', 'Rahmat', 'day', 'lad', 'furtively', 'combing', 'out', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'realizes', 'Rahmat', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'one', 'Latif', 'bitter', 'smitten', 'protecting', 'Rahmat', 'other', 'workers', 'even', 'jail', 'keep', 'being', 'picked', 'up', 'Immigration', 'officers', 'When', 'foreman', 'forced', 'lay', 'off', 'Afghani', 'workers', 'Latif', 'new', 'love', 'back', 'country', 'neighborhood', 'Latif', 'spare', 'time', 'find', 'money', 'help', 'dirt-poor', 'family', 'never', 'actually', 'talks', 'Rahmat', 'time', 'Loving', 'though', 'callow', 'youth', 'compassionate', 'even', 'noble', 'young', 'man.Baran', 'type', 'love', 'western', 'societies', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'experience', 'Latif', 'behavior', 'towards', 'Rahmat', 'fervent', 'self-sacrificing', 'abstract', 'idea', 'love', 'drive', 'more', 'prospect', 'actually', 'interacting', 'Part', 'surely', 'cultural', 'movie', 'end', 'just', 'when', ""'re"", 'talk', 'buhrka', 'head', 'away', 'father', 'truck', 'Latif', 'left', 'hair', 'dropped', 'image', 'footprint', 'mud', 'soon', 'washed', 'away', 'heavy', 'rains', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'intense', 'abstract', 'emotion', 'could', 'be', 'transformed', 'young', 'men', 'willingness', 'die', 'abstract', 'idea', 'perpetual', 'afterlife.Hossein', 'Abedini', 'energetic', 'emotionally', 'shaded', 'performance', 'Latif', 'Actress', 'Zahra', 'Bahrami', ""n't"", 'speak', 'one', 'word', 'entire', 'movie', 'conveys', 'Rahmat', 'feelings', 'yearnings', 'lustrous', 'black', 'eyes', 'Director', 'Magid', 'Majidi', 'great', 'job', 'conveying', 'dust', 'sweat', 'hard', 'labor', 'particularly', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'where', 'Rahmat', 'other', 'women', 'find', 'work', 'lifting', 'heavy', 'boulders', 'cold', 'stream', 'romanticizing', 'also', 'bonds', 'form', 'poor', 'working', 'men.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'Majidi', 'film', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'brother', 'sister', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'Tehran', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly']",Baran

It is a unique love story dealing with Iran and Afgani refugees fleeing the Taliban and the civil war in their country.  It shows the complexity of the situation in this region without resorting to boring political talk.  A young teenage Iranian, who is really kind of a cock up, ends up falling in love with an Afgani refugee who is pretending to be a boy.  She is working on a construction site so she can earn money for her family.  The young man cannot (for religious reasons and also because he's the only one who knows the girl's real identity) show his love for this girl, and it leads to a very sad conclusion.  This is a really remarkable film, told with grace and subtlety.  Most, if not all, Iranian films I've seen have this other worldly, poetic quality to them.  They are immensely poetic and humanistically told, without any violence, sex, or profane language.

One is that I grew up shy, andLateef's advances towards his new found love -- while stretchingcredulity with some reviewers -- perfectly captures the fits and startsof attending to one's heart's desire, looking into another human's eyes,and sensing a vast gulf that first must be crossed.It strikes me that nations are sometimes in this position, too,separated by historical events, but unlike improbable lovers, a mutualrespect seems even less likely. While art can't usher in utopia here onearth, it can start to chip away at the impediments we as societies findourselves constrained by. Baran is a film of great beauty, a smallmasterpiece not unlike a series of paintings, displaying a richness ofimages and ideas.Baran is rewarding on many levels, and based on the numerous positivereviews, you, too, may find it compelling and memorable.

It had to be from the start..An Afghan refugee working on a building site to support her family after her father has an accident,concealing her identity as a result, and a working class and poor Iranian boy, who at the beginning of the film was the irresponsible joker, and whose life is totally transformed by his 'discovery' and love.The genuis of Majidi, is that he films this story without  sentimentality yet with great compassion and love for his characters,and with a camera work that is pure poetry.There are many unforgettable scenes in Baran, but the one that haunted me the most was when Baran's secret is discovered by Hossein.

709083,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B00006ADG0,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","I've seen two previous films from director Majid Majidi - ""The Father"", which seemed more than a little overwrought in it's portrait of a perpetually angry boy dealing with his hated stepfather, and ""Children of Heaven"", a well-done and quite beautiful but somewhat sappy entry into the popular Iranian true-life kids adventure genre. They're both worth seeing, but they seemed to confirm to me what I've read from some critics - he's a rather shallow crowd-pleaser with characters drawn in thick brushstrokes and lots of manipulative emotional melodrama.I'm pleased to say that though ""Baran"" doesn't totally avoid the problems I've seen in the other two films, it has a story and a concentration of purpose that allows it to get away with them, or perhaps to minimize the flaws. I will try as others have done not to ""spoil"" the central revelation in the film, though it does make discussing the film rather difficult. As the film (the title means ""rain"" in Kurdish) opens, the teenaged Iranian Lateef is going about his job as errand-boy and tea-server for a construction crew that employs a lot of illegal Afghan workers on a grungy, several story building in Tehran. Lateef is lazy and has a quick temper, but somehow manages to keep his job - I assumed that he had a personal relationship with the foreman, Memar, and this turned out to be correct - and he's infuriated when a young Afghan refugee, Rahmat, is given his job and he has to start doing the regular manual labor. Rahmat is the son of an injured worker and needs to work to help the family, but he's too small and weak to carry cement bags around. Lateef plots to undermine Rahmat - who quickly proves better at the errands, tea-serving and cooking than Lateef was - until he discovers the secret...And it probably isn't going to be hard for anybody to guess what the secret is; I will just tell you that ""Baran"" is Rahmat's real name and leave it at that.  This is the point where the film naturally turns into something different - a strange kind of love story, as Lateef instantly finds himself attracted to Baran, and tries to become a protector (as well as, it must be said, something of a stalker). Here also is where some familiarity with Iranian cinema and censorship might be helpful; if you've seen a number of films from the post-1980 period, you may find, as I did, the scene in which Rahmat/Baran is ""revealed"" absolutely breathtaking. So much in this film is utterly simple - and maybe even silly to our eyes - but through the eyes of a sexually/romantically frustrated Iranian youth, it's dead serious, and very powerful.The second and third acts of the movie, then, are about Lateef's efforts to get to know and to help Baran and family. The lengths he goes to - and the sacrifices he makes - may seem pretty bizarre given how little he knows about the situation, but within the culture and social strata that the characters live in, they seem fairly believable. What I loved about Lateef's ""journey"" is how we really get to experience the antiquity and decrepitude of this ancient city - and culture - buildings falling down and being rebuilt, families living in ramshackle huts next to rivers that run right through the city; people who live as they might have in Biblical times. The film subtly points out that Lateef does live in the modern world of automobiles and shops selling cigarettes and magazines, bosses with cell phones - and yet he cannot even touch or talk to somebody who has come to mean so much to him.""Baran"" is goregously shot, with some virtuso camerawork that includes a wonderful long crane shot throught he bowels of the construction site and some of the better uses of slow-mo that I've seen recently; in the end, the film really worked on me, and it's another fine example of how Iranian filmmakers have continued to call attention to their society's injustices and the impossibilities of really living under it's strictures.  Released in 2001 in the middle of the relatively open and less censorious Khatami regime, this film probably could not have been made 10 years later.  But regardless of all the political and religious messages under and on the surface, at heart this is an impossible love story, and a beautiful and very sad one.",5,Rain in the ashes of the heart,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,4250,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'director', 'Majid', 'Majidi', 'Father', 'seemed', 'more', 'little', 'overwrought', 'portrait', 'perpetually', 'angry', 'boy', 'dealing', 'hated', 'stepfather', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'well-done', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'somewhat', 'sappy', 'entry', 'popular', 'Iranian', 'true-life', 'kids', 'adventure', 'genre', ""'re"", 'worth', 'seeing', 'seemed', 'confirm', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'critics', 'rather', 'shallow', 'crowd-pleaser', 'characters', 'drawn', 'thick', 'brushstrokes', 'lots', 'manipulative', 'emotional', 'melodrama.I', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'Baran', ""n't"", 'totally', 'avoid', 'problems', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'story', 'concentration', 'purpose', 'get', 'away', 'perhaps', 'minimize', 'flaws', 'will', 'try', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'not', 'spoil', 'central', 'revelation', 'film', 'make', 'discussing', 'film', 'rather', 'difficult', 'film', 'title', 'rain', 'Kurdish', 'teenaged', 'Iranian', 'Lateef', 'going', 'job', 'errand-boy', 'tea-server', 'construction', 'crew', 'lot', 'illegal', 'Afghan', 'workers', 'grungy', 'several', 'story', 'building', 'Tehran', 'Lateef', 'lazy', 'quick', 'temper', 'somehow', 'keep', 'job', 'assumed', 'had', 'personal', 'relationship', 'foreman', 'Memar', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'correct', 'infuriated', 'when', 'young', 'Afghan', 'refugee', 'Rahmat', 'given', 'job', 'start', 'doing', 'regular', 'manual', 'labor', 'Rahmat', 'son', 'injured', 'worker', 'needs', 'work', 'help', 'family', 'too', 'small', 'weak', 'carry', 'cement', 'bags', 'Lateef', 'plots', 'undermine', 'Rahmat', 'who', 'quickly', 'better', 'errands', 'tea-serving', 'cooking', 'Lateef', 'was', 'secret', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'anybody', 'guess', 'what', 'secret', 'will', 'just', 'tell', 'Baran', 'Rahmat', 'real', 'name', 'leave', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'naturally', 'something', 'different', 'strange', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'Lateef', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'Baran', 'tries', 'become', 'protector', 'as', 'well', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'something', 'stalker', 'Here', 'also', 'where', 'familiarity', 'Iranian', 'cinema', 'censorship', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'films', 'post-1980', 'period', 'may', 'find', 'did', 'scene', 'Rahmat/Baran', 'revealed', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'utterly', 'simple', 'maybe', 'even', 'silly', 'eyes', 'eyes', 'sexually/romantically', 'frustrated', 'Iranian', 'youth', 'dead', 'serious', 'very', 'powerful.The', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'movie', 'then', 'are', 'Lateef', 'efforts', 'get', 'know', 'help', 'Baran', 'family', 'lengths', 'sacrifices', 'may', 'seem', 'pretty', 'bizarre', 'given', 'how', 'little', 'situation', 'culture', 'social', 'strata', 'characters', 'live', 'seem', 'fairly', 'believable', 'What', 'loved', 'Lateef', 'journey', 'how', 'really', 'get', 'experience', 'antiquity', 'decrepitude', 'ancient', 'city', 'culture', 'buildings', 'falling', 'down', 'being', 'rebuilt', 'families', 'living', 'ramshackle', 'huts', 'rivers', 'run', 'right', 'city', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'might', 'have', 'Biblical', 'times', 'film', 'subtly', 'out', 'Lateef', 'live', 'modern', 'world', 'automobiles', 'shops', 'selling', 'cigarettes', 'magazines', 'bosses', 'cell', 'phones', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'touch', 'talk', 'somebody', 'who', 'come', 'mean', 'so', 'much', 'Baran', 'goregously', 'shot', 'virtuso', 'camerawork', 'wonderful', 'long', 'crane', 'shot', 'throught', 'construction', 'site', 'better', 'uses', 'slow-mo', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'worked', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'Iranian', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'continued', 'call', 'attention', 'society', 'injustices', 'impossibilities', 'really', 'living', 'strictures', 'Released', '2001', 'middle', 'relatively', 'open', 'less', 'censorious', 'Khatami', 'regime', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', '10', 'years', 'later', 'regardless', 'political', 'religious', 'messages', 'surface', 'heart', 'impossible', 'love', 'story', 'beautiful', 'very', 'sad', 'one']",Baran

It touches on several themes, including the plight of the refugees, and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry. Much of the story takes place at a construction site, where the central character, a young Iranian, a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen, gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father, injured at the work site.The young man's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl, and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family. Though they never exchange a word in the film, she leaves a deep impression on him, and he is utterly changed by his experience. A story that is about the transformation of character, the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process, often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines, wordlessly ponders his situation, or goes in search of the girl and her family. Director Magid Magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men, the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them, and the unforgiving weather (snow, rain, cold) in which they all labor.

I mean, this fellow is just awful. He's so obnoxious, you keep waiting for him to do something appealing so you can stop wishing he'd fall off of the building.And then he does. He finds out, by accident, that the ""son"" is really a young woman. And he is immediately drawn to her. Suddenly, instead of being the tormentor he is the protector, of her physically and of her secret.When events transpire that lead him to search for her(well, I can't give EVERYTHING away, now can I?), we get to see the maturation process in action. Caring for someone other than himself gives him a strength and a resolve that even he did not know he had and brings him to an incredible sacrifice to help out her family.Iranian films rarely have what we would traditionally call ""happy endings"". Those are rare and not sought after. But there are endings that aren't horrid, just sort of sad, in a good way. It's hard to explain, but this film supplies an excellent example. In Iran, princes don't rescue the princesses, they usually get mangled by the dragon, but it's never a dull ride(and in this case he doesn't actually get mangled...).",5,a true love brings maturity,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1437,"['Beautiful', 'When', 'movie', 'young', 'lead', 'character', 'selfish', 'self-absorbed', 'lazy', 'young', 'man', 'looking', 'quickest', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'least', 'effort', 'many', 'peers', 'intense', 'dislike', 'refugee', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'come', 'work', 'company', 'employed', 'mean', 'fellow', 'just', 'awful', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'keep', 'waiting', 'do', 'something', 'appealing', 'can', 'stop', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'fall', 'off', 'building.And', 'then', 'out', 'accident', 'son', 'really', 'young', 'woman', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'Suddenly', 'instead', 'being', 'tormentor', 'protector', 'physically', 'secret.When', 'events', 'transpire', 'lead', 'search', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'EVERYTHING', 'away', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'see', 'maturation', 'process', 'action', 'Caring', 'someone', 'other', 'strength', 'resolve', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'incredible', 'sacrifice', 'help', 'out', 'family.Iranian', 'films', 'rarely', 'have', 'what', 'would', 'traditionally', 'call', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'rare', 'not', 'sought', 'are', 'endings', 'are', ""n't"", 'horrid', 'just', 'sort', 'sad', 'good', 'way', 'hard', 'explain', 'film', 'excellent', 'example', 'Iran', 'princes', 'do', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'princesses', 'usually', 'get', 'mangled', 'dragon', 'never', 'dull', 'ride', 'case', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'mangled']",Baran

The situation is complicated by her masquerading as a boy to earn some desperately needed money for her family.Although it deals with youong love, this movie is by no means a fairy tale, which is the fate of almost all Hollywood movies telling similar stories. The characters may dream and yearn, but reality is always pressing and uncompromising.  But the movie also offer hope.

The film has a romantic taste in a subdued narrative, and perhaps a very immediate and political message.  But like a lovable brother and sister in &quot;Heaven,&quot; &quot;Baran&quot; is about the two people in Iran tenderly depicted by Majidi.The story starts with a young man Lateef working at a construction site somewhere in Iran.  The work is hard, and many workers are actually not Iranian, but illegal immigirants from Afghanistan.  The boss Memar (excellent Mohammad Amir Naji, father of the children in &quot;Heaven&quot;) is in fact a good fellow, but doesn't (or cannot) give much wage to them.  There, Lateef has been assigned a rather easy job, serving tea and bread because of his father.But one day Lateef must start to work, this time a real one.  For one of the workers of the place broke his leg, and a son of the injured, very small boy named Rahmat, replaces this guy who could be lazy until then.  Sulky, discontent, Rahmat acts very nastily before this small boy ... until he finds a surprising secret about &quot;Rahmat&quot; who in fact is named &quot;Baran.&quot;The rest of the story should remain untold.  The man begins to  change his attitudes to this newcomer, silently protecting Baran and keeping the secret from the people around them.  But what can he do?  And how far can he go when he knows someday Baran and the family must go back to the country where the society is still very unstable?  All those emotional changes happening in this man's heart are tactly dealt with Majidi's lyrical narrative, without being too sugary and sentimental.I understand some people's complaint that this film (and Iranian films in general) is too slow-moving.  And I think the latter half, which should have shown more of Baran, seems a bit overlong.  The 90 minutes surely feel long even for me (though I have watched many films from that country).  Still, the charms of the simple tale with rich details of the everyday life in Iran which the Western media rarely cover are irresitible.Certainly it moves slow, but &quot;Baran&quot; presents us what a good cinema can do with its good visuals and sincere attitudes towards filmmaking and the people it pictures.Those who are interested in Iran-Afghanistan relations should see &quot;Kandahar&quot; and &quot;The Cyclist.&quot;  The former in a sense follows the possible life of Baran, and the latter is a big hit in Iran about a most desperate bet done by an aged illegal immigrant from Afghanistan, who has to ride a bicycle through one whole week.",5,&quot;Baran&quot; Means &quot;Rain&quot;; Story of Tender Feeling Deftly Told,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,2737,"['Majid', 'Majidi', 'director', 'quot', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'first', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'Iran', 'heart-warming', 'slightly', 'poignant', 'film', 'quot', 'Baran', 'quot', 'meaning', 'quot', 'Rain', 'quot', 'film', 'romantic', 'taste', 'subdued', 'narrative', 'perhaps', 'very', 'immediate', 'political', 'message', 'lovable', 'brother', 'sister', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'quot', 'Baran', 'quot', 'two', 'people', 'Iran', 'tenderly', 'depicted', 'Majidi.The', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'Lateef', 'working', 'construction', 'site', 'somewhere', 'Iran', 'work', 'hard', 'many', 'workers', 'are', 'actually', 'not', 'Iranian', 'illegal', 'immigirants', 'Afghanistan', 'boss', 'Memar', 'excellent', 'Mohammad', 'Amir', 'Naji', 'father', 'children', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'fact', 'good', 'fellow', ""n't"", 'can', 'not', 'give', 'much', 'wage', 'Lateef', 'been', 'assigned', 'rather', 'easy', 'job', 'serving', 'tea', 'bread', 'father.But', 'one', 'day', 'Lateef', 'must', 'start', 'work', 'time', 'real', 'one', 'one', 'workers', 'place', 'broke', 'leg', 'son', 'injured', 'very', 'small', 'boy', 'named', 'Rahmat', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'lazy', 'then', 'Sulky', 'discontent', 'Rahmat', 'very', 'nastily', 'small', 'boy', 'surprising', 'secret', 'quot', 'Rahmat', 'quot', 'who', 'fact', 'named', 'quot', 'Baran.', 'quot', 'rest', 'story', 'should', 'remain', 'untold', 'man', 'change', 'attitudes', 'newcomer', 'silently', 'protecting', 'Baran', 'keeping', 'secret', 'people', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'when', 'someday', 'Baran', 'family', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'country', 'where', 'society', 'still', 'very', 'unstable', 'emotional', 'changes', 'happening', 'man', 'heart', 'are', 'tactly', 'dealt', 'Majidi', 'lyrical', 'narrative', 'being', 'too', 'sugary', 'sentimental.I', 'understand', 'people', 'complaint', 'film', 'Iranian', 'films', 'general', 'too', 'slow-moving', 'think', 'latter', 'half', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'more', 'Baran', 'bit', 'overlong', '90', 'minutes', 'surely', 'feel', 'long', 'even', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'country', 'Still', 'charms', 'simple', 'tale', 'rich', 'details', 'everyday', 'life', 'Iran', 'Western', 'media', 'rarely', 'cover', 'are', 'irresitible.Certainly', 'slow', 'quot', 'Baran', 'quot', 'what', 'good', 'cinema', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'visuals', 'sincere', 'attitudes', 'filmmaking', 'people', 'pictures.Those', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Iran-Afghanistan', 'relations', 'should', 'see', 'quot', 'Kandahar', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cyclist.', 'quot', 'former', 'sense', 'possible', 'life', 'Baran', 'latter', 'big', 'hit', 'Iran', 'most', 'desperate', 'bet', 'done', 'aged', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'Afghanistan', 'who', 'ride', 'bicycle', 'one', 'whole', 'week']",Baran
