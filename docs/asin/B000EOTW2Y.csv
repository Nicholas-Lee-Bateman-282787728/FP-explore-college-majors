975843,A15PVKTO6JXT26,B000EOTW2Y,Chris,"[5, 11]","This movie looks like it was shot on a handycam and the actors seem raw and unpolished enough to be real teenagers.  The mexican settings are very atmospheric and set an uneasy tone to the movie.  The cinematography is claustraphobic and dark for much of the film and so you actually feel like you are there.  Not unlike the Blair Witch Project - polished cinematography has been sacraficed here for raw enagement - for me it works - but others may find it hard to get past the scratchy production values.  This is one of the most surprisingly good horror/zombie movies I've seen in a while.The storyline follows a band of five young surfers as they head to a remote piece of Mexican beach to hook up with central character's brother.  When they finally arrive their day starts off well with some hot surfing from the guys and a bit of topless nudity from the girls.  But when they start wandering among the sand dunes around them - what they discover is very disturbing.  Abandonned SUV's, fleash picked human skeletons and by now the party has already been split up.  Things don't get any better for anyone.  Raw gritty and real - this is a hardcore mexican surfer zombie movie without a scrap of humour in it.  I'm sure we will hear more about this among zombie fans as more people discover it.",5,Less is More - Brilliant,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,1297,"['movie', 'was', 'shot', 'handycam', 'actors', 'seem', 'raw', 'unpolished', 'enough', 'be', 'real', 'teenagers', 'mexican', 'settings', 'are', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'set', 'uneasy', 'tone', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'claustraphobic', 'dark', 'much', 'film', 'so', 'actually', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'Not', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'polished', 'cinematography', 'been', 'sacraficed', 'here', 'raw', 'enagement', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'hard', 'get', 'scratchy', 'production', 'values', 'one', 'most', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'horror/zombie', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while.The', 'storyline', 'band', 'five', 'young', 'surfers', 'head', 'remote', 'piece', 'Mexican', 'beach', 'hook', 'up', 'central', 'character', 'brother', 'When', 'finally', 'arrive', 'day', 'off', 'well', 'hot', 'surfing', 'guys', 'bit', 'topless', 'nudity', 'girls', 'when', 'start', 'wandering', 'sand', 'dunes', 'what', 'discover', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Abandonned', 'SUV', 'fleash', 'picked', 'human', 'skeletons', 'now', 'party', 'already', 'been', 'split', 'up', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'anyone', 'Raw', 'gritty', 'real', 'hardcore', 'mexican', 'surfer', 'zombie', 'movie', 'scrap', 'humour', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'hear', 'more', 'zombie', 'fans', 'more', 'people']",Trespassers

This time the group is off for a trip to Baja Mexico for some surfing, sex, and alcohol and wind up on a deserted beach.  One of the group disappears, leaving his video camera and they seem him grabbed by something on the tape.  This has been used too many times in recent films.  In town they group learns about the history of the beach.  It was evidently home to some religious nuts at one time.  Their leader did an unspeakable act and was killed.  Now he's back for revenge on anyone who dares to trespass on his beach.It's not terribly original which I can live with.  What I can't live with his absolutely some of the worst camera work ever scene in a film.  Was the camera man drunk or did he just have a nervous tick which caused the shaky, jumpy camera work in many spots.  It really made it difficult to watch.  The acting was nothing to write home about either as this was strictly amateur hour and it certainly showed.  Although look for Clayton Rohner in a bit role.  Rohner has a ton of acting credits including the 80's teen comedy, ""Just one of the Guys"" and 80's slasher flick ""April Fools Day"".
