909077,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0009NZ2W4,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 7]","Season 4 has definitely lost something, unlike the mysterious and moody best seasons so far, Season 1 and 2.  What I am seeing and feeling is directors and writers are just throwing anything bizarre at the viewers.  Here, let's throw some crap at viewers and see if it sticks, especially when ""excrement"" is delivered to Ruth and her new hubby George, plus this storyline with George's son didn't go anywhere.  And Nate's continuous struggle with his dead wife and clearly, goes a little over the top too.Also, Rico's problems at home seem unreal.  I seriously doubt that Vanessa would reject him after a one night stand and paying attention and little money to a dancer.  Culturally, it doesn't seem right.  It's cheesy and Vanessa's character is not one to ignore her children and party every night.  Not so.  And if you need to use children, can you make them more believable, instead of robot kids.Although so much is thrown into each episode, scenes are shorter, except with the lengthy drawn out bizarre scene with David and the hitchhiker who threatens his life.Where is the mood?What is lacking is the mood and mysteriousness of previous seasons.  You could watch those with anticipation, anxiety, fear, and most of all with a sense of morbidity.  But Season Four is trying to move to quick, too much, go over the edge as quick and bizarre as one can get.Directors/Writers are lacking quality script writingIn previous seasons, Keith was a strong, proud, gay man, now he is turned into a wimpy boring, security guard and scriptwriting is cheesy, lacking depth, cliche, etc.  What happened?  Even the commentaries are boring.  What's the use?Calling All PervertsSeems that there was a casting call for All Perverts.  Do we really need more perverts this season?  Brenda and Billy were enough, now you have thrown in bondage.  And get rid of Brenda's mom, nothing but slutty comes from the character. What purpose is she serving?Toward the end of season 4 is just TOO MUCH SEX GOIN' ON!I hope Season 5 is better.  .....Rizzo.",3,Grabbing at straws here!!,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,2031,"['Season', '4', 'definitely', 'lost', 'something', 'mysterious', 'moody', 'best', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'Season', '1', '2', 'What', 'am', 'seeing', 'feeling', 'directors', 'writers', 'are', 'just', 'throwing', 'anything', 'bizarre', 'viewers', 'Here', 'let', 'throw', 'crap', 'viewers', 'see', 'especially', 'when', 'excrement', 'delivered', 'Ruth', 'new', 'hubby', 'George', 'storyline', 'George', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'Nate', 'continuous', 'struggle', 'dead', 'wife', 'clearly', 'little', 'top', 'too.Also', 'Rico', 'problems', 'home', 'seem', 'unreal', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'Vanessa', 'would', 'reject', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'paying', 'attention', 'little', 'money', 'dancer', 'Culturally', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'cheesy', 'Vanessa', 'character', 'not', 'one', 'ignore', 'children', 'party', 'night', 'Not', 'so', 'need', 'use', 'children', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'believable', 'instead', 'robot', 'kids.Although', 'so', 'much', 'thrown', 'episode', 'scenes', 'are', 'shorter', 'lengthy', 'drawn', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'David', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'life.Where', 'mood', 'What', 'lacking', 'mood', 'mysteriousness', 'previous', 'seasons', 'could', 'watch', 'anticipation', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'most', 'sense', 'morbidity', 'Season', 'Four', 'trying', 'move', 'quick', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'edge', 'quick', 'bizarre', 'one', 'can', 'get.Directors/Writers', 'are', 'lacking', 'quality', 'script', 'writingIn', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Keith', 'was', 'strong', 'proud', 'gay', 'man', 'now', 'turned', 'wimpy', 'boring', 'security', 'guard', 'scriptwriting', 'cheesy', 'lacking', 'depth', 'cliche', 'etc', 'What', 'happened', 'Even', 'commentaries', 'are', 'boring', 'What', 'use', 'Calling', 'PervertsSeems', 'was', 'casting', 'call', 'Perverts', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'more', 'perverts', 'season', 'Brenda', 'Billy', 'were', 'enough', 'now', 'have', 'thrown', 'bondage', 'get', 'rid', 'Brenda', 'mom', 'nothing', 'slutty', 'character', 'What', 'purpose', 'serving', 'end', 'season', '4', 'just', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'SEX', 'GOIN', 'ON', 'hope', 'Season', '5', 'better', '..Rizzo']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fourth Season

I dont have cable so I had to wait a long time to see this show all the way from season one. Everything form the amazingly beautiful and quirky opening credits, to the richness and sophistication of the DVD menus themselves, everything about this show is top notch.This season is a little muddy. I found it frustrating that sex was the one hard (no pun meant) foundation of all of the crises in the show from EVERY character, except Ruth. I also find it a cop out that if some of the characters (main and supporting) are in a pinch relationship wise, they switch to gay lovin' (which seems to be a common thread with all the seasons). There's no problem with that, if it were believable, but Claire's relationship seemed forced to me.I also for the life of me cannot for one second believe David and Keith's relationship. That is the most contrived relationship in the show. These characters have nothing in common, they don't even seem to be on the same page, and this season thus far seems to highlight that loophole more and more. They bounce off of what one wants to hear, and then when they hear it, they don't want it anymore. The actors are doing their best to make it feel genuine, but it is not, nor has it ever worked. Why are they together?All in all this show is so well crafted, that this ""darker"" season is just a low period for the characters in the whole of the timeline of the show.

But unfortunately, somewhere along the way (and I think this started in season 3) this show became just another television soap albeit a classy, much more sophisticated one.  But that is still not enough to justify this putrid season.  The 3rd season is really when SFU started to deteriorate, but at least that season had some quality moments and ended with a knockout punch in 3 quality episodes.  But the 4th season is when the show really took a nose dive.  I don't care what any of these other ""sheep"" say, but the 4th was definitely the worst.  The ""That's My Dog"" debacle confirmed it, but the show was actually headed in that tired direction for a while.  I suspect many of the people who LOVED the 4th season don't get much quality entertainment outside of HBO or Showtime if they liked this season so much.  If you really LOVED SFU, I cannot recommend this season although HBO has conveniently front-loaded the set with all the extras the other seasons should have had.  Which leads me to believe they feel the same way and want to make sure the set sells well enough.  I bought the 1st 2 seasons with few extras at all and may buy the 3rd one of these days but that's where it ends for me.  My romance with this show died completely with season 4, but I will always cherish my memories of when this show was at its peak.  And few shows could match it in quality when it was.",1,Oh well.

The first season pretty clearly intended to ""explode"" this business, what with the pilot's usage of hearse commercials, casket promotion, and the like.

909108,A1J9GTON38IMDE,B0009NZ2W4,marvista2004,"[8, 13]","Season 4 of ""Six Feet Under"" retains its stranglehold on viewers' attention, pulling its audience into watching episode after episode.  Even if the material is profoundly disturbing and markedly uncomfortable to watch at times, this show remains unafraid and unapologetic in the way it tackles some of life's big questions.Particularly well-handled this season is how Claire experiences a creative epiphany as an artist and ""breaks open"" her eye to see anew.  The tricky nature of images - where truths lie half-hidden beneath seemingly ordinary surfaces - also plays a pivotal role in the season finale in the reveal about what happened to Lisa.However, a certain something seems to be missing from Season 4 when compared to Seasons 1-3: the large institutional backdrops that served as such terrific foils in earlier years are gone.Seasons 1 and 2, for example, had fun exploring the ins and outs of the funeral home industry, which provided ample grist for season-long tension and humor that complemented (and in some ways balanced out) the turmoil occurring in the personal relationships of the main characters.  Other institutional backdrops that provided lots of ""play"" in the first three seasons included high school, the LAPD, local Protestant churches, art college, and a gay men's chorus.  These highly organized social environments helped to reveal different aspects of characters' personalities and identities by exerting pressure on them and exploring how they responded.Another notable difference in Season 4 is that the ""opening death"" at the beginning of each episode no longer resonates  throughout that episode's storyline in any meaningful way.Without the balancing effects of institutional backdrops or ""opening death"" storylines, Season 4 focuses intently (even relentlessly) on the issues of personal identity, relationships, and family.  Some may feel this crosses over into soap opera territory, but Season 4 remains compelling viewing.NOTE:  Season 4 may offend some viewers with scenes of graphic violence and fairly explicit sex.",4,Compelling Viewing Yet Still Missing A Certain Something,1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,2056,"['Season', '4', 'Six', 'Feet', 'stranglehold', 'viewers', 'attention', 'pulling', 'audience', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'Even', 'material', 'profoundly', 'disturbing', 'markedly', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'times', 'show', 'unafraid', 'unapologetic', 'way', 'life', 'big', 'questions.Particularly', 'well-handled', 'season', 'how', 'Claire', 'creative', 'epiphany', 'artist', 'breaks', 'open', 'eye', 'see', 'anew', 'tricky', 'nature', 'images', 'where', 'truths', 'lie', 'half-hidden', 'beneath', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'surfaces', 'also', 'pivotal', 'role', 'season', 'finale', 'reveal', 'what', 'happened', 'Lisa.However', 'certain', 'something', 'be', 'missing', 'Season', '4', 'when', 'compared', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'large', 'institutional', 'backdrops', 'served', 'such', 'terrific', 'foils', 'earlier', 'years', 'are', 'gone.Seasons', '1', '2', 'example', 'had', 'fun', 'exploring', 'ins', 'outs', 'funeral', 'home', 'industry', 'provided', 'ample', 'grist', 'season-long', 'tension', 'humor', 'complemented', 'ways', 'balanced', 'out', 'turmoil', 'occurring', 'personal', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'Other', 'institutional', 'backdrops', 'provided', 'lots', 'play', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'included', 'high', 'school', 'LAPD', 'local', 'Protestant', 'churches', 'art', 'college', 'gay', 'men', 'chorus', 'highly', 'organized', 'social', 'environments', 'helped', 'reveal', 'different', 'aspects', 'characters', 'personalities', 'identities', 'exerting', 'pressure', 'exploring', 'how', 'responded.Another', 'notable', 'difference', 'Season', '4', 'opening', 'death', 'beginning', 'episode', 'no', 'longer', 'episode', 'storyline', 'meaningful', 'balancing', 'effects', 'institutional', 'backdrops', 'opening', 'death', 'storylines', 'Season', '4', 'focuses', 'intently', 'even', 'relentlessly', 'issues', 'personal', 'identity', 'relationships', 'family', 'may', 'feel', 'over', 'soap', 'opera', 'territory', 'Season', '4', 'remains', 'compelling', 'viewing.NOTE', 'Season', '4', 'may', 'offend', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'violence', 'fairly', 'explicit', 'sex']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fourth Season

909113,AYYODBGYFL5SY,B0009NZ2W4,N. Wong,"[18, 33]","It has come to my disappointment that the season 4 of SFD has been the least interesting, dramatic but most disappointing so far. When I was watching, I had a feeling that the plot was hauled deliberately in order to save up enough dynamites for a huge dramatic explosion in the coming final season.Nothing much happens in season 4. Or I should say everything that should happen has happened already. In this season, following Lisa's death, Nate has been struggling for settlement among different women, including, of course, Brenda Chenowith. Yet, the plot is not clear in explaining why he needs settlement. There are times that Nate may seem to want independence for a refreshing life. In the next minute, he will hit on another woman. I believe the audience are already tired of seeing Brenda as a third-person when Nate is married with Lisa; and even more bored seeing Nate miss Lisa when he has decided to get back with Brenda. Why does he, or should I say the plot, keep coming back and forth? It just seems to me that the characters, Nate, Lisa and Brenda have reached their limits. The space for further expansion seems remote. Indeed, the mystery of Lisa's death is revealed in episode 12.  I don't find it convincing or suggestive at all.As for Claire Fisher, she is always my favorite character in SFD because of her cynicism and rebellious attitude. I am glad that she has comes to a successful level by being an artist. Yet, she is also another character whose space for expansion is very limited. She finally goes back to Billy Chenowith, all the way back to season 2. The point of making her a lesbian for 2 minutes and befriend with a bunch drug-addicts is unrevealing to her growth. That Russel still drags a long is another irritating part in the whole season.Every troubled character goes back to normal in season 4: Brenda's mother, Ruth Fisher's sister, Sarah, Brend and Billy. Ruth Fisher remains as the outfast of the family whose kitchen becomes the only place she can situate herself and has a little more dominance over the family routines or abnormalities. Her marriage with George is interrupted in season 4 as George turns out to be a bit indifferent of the womanly needs, yet Ruth becomes more and more anxious and knowing the background of the mysterious geologist. George is hinted with a sense of sickness in the end of the whole season. He has retreated to a bomb shelter and claims that it is where he will start living. Ruth has caught him talking into the air when there's no one nearby. Kyle and Maggie, George's children, also appeared, but nothing much happen on them. I believe if George's 'sickness' has been put much earlier in the season, the drama will become more successful in grabbing the hearts of the audience.What I don't like in season 4 is that David Fisher is portrayed as a drama queen since the carjack. He has been excessively attention-seeking and over-demanding to Keith. This falls into the stereotype of homosexual representation in TV dramas that gays are dramatic. The reappearance of Sarge is absurd and bringing back Jennifer to season 4 is also pointless. The most ridiculous point is that Keith sleeps with the female boss (who is a super star). At the end of season 4, Keith is also hired as a bodyguard of a gay film maker in order to settle down a lawsuit for David. This may be interesting, but don't you see? All the potential plots are now outside the original Fisher family: Is George sick? Keith will become a slut and become a money boy? What can the 4 Fishers still do in season 5? Are we still interested in seeing Nate and Brenda break up again? Or Claire is hurt again by Billy? David and Keith talking about their openness of their open relationship? These questions seem a bit vexing to the screenwriters indeed.Still, I think Kathy Bates and Patricia Clarkson are being under-used in the whole drama. Bettina and Ruth Fisher could have become a pair of female good friends, or even lovers. Sarah could have had more interaction with the Fisher family. Yet, the two interesting characters are just strictly staying in the domain of Ruth Fisher.",2,The worst among all the seasons so far with a hauling plot,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,4127,"['come', 'disappointment', 'season', '4', 'SFD', 'been', 'least', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'most', 'disappointing', 'so', 'far', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'had', 'feeling', 'plot', 'was', 'hauled', 'deliberately', 'order', 'save', 'up', 'enough', 'dynamites', 'huge', 'dramatic', 'explosion', 'coming', 'final', 'season.Nothing', 'much', 'season', '4', 'should', 'say', 'everything', 'should', 'happen', 'happened', 'already', 'season', 'following', 'Lisa', 'death', 'Nate', 'been', 'struggling', 'settlement', 'different', 'women', 'including', 'course', 'Brenda', 'Chenowith', 'plot', 'not', 'clear', 'explaining', 'why', 'settlement', 'are', 'times', 'Nate', 'may', 'seem', 'want', 'independence', 'refreshing', 'life', 'next', 'minute', 'will', 'hit', 'woman', 'believe', 'audience', 'are', 'already', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Brenda', 'third-person', 'when', 'Nate', 'married', 'Lisa', 'even', 'more', 'bored', 'seeing', 'Nate', 'miss', 'Lisa', 'when', 'decided', 'get', 'back', 'Brenda', 'Why', 'should', 'say', 'plot', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'forth', 'just', 'characters', 'Nate', 'Lisa', 'Brenda', 'have', 'reached', 'limits', 'space', 'further', 'expansion', 'remote', 'Indeed', 'mystery', 'Lisa', 'death', 'revealed', 'episode', '12', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'convincing', 'suggestive', 'all.As', 'Claire', 'Fisher', 'always', 'favorite', 'character', 'SFD', 'cynicism', 'rebellious', 'attitude', 'am', 'glad', 'successful', 'level', 'being', 'artist', 'also', 'character', 'space', 'expansion', 'very', 'limited', 'finally', 'back', 'Billy', 'Chenowith', 'way', 'back', 'season', '2', 'point', 'making', 'lesbian', '2', 'minutes', 'befriend', 'bunch', 'drug-addicts', 'unrevealing', 'growth', 'Russel', 'still', 'long', 'irritating', 'part', 'whole', 'season.Every', 'troubled', 'character', 'back', 'normal', 'season', '4', 'Brenda', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Fisher', 'sister', 'Sarah', 'Brend', 'Billy', 'Ruth', 'Fisher', 'outfast', 'family', 'kitchen', 'only', 'place', 'can', 'situate', 'little', 'more', 'dominance', 'family', 'abnormalities', 'marriage', 'George', 'interrupted', 'season', '4', 'George', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'indifferent', 'womanly', 'needs', 'yet', 'Ruth', 'more', 'more', 'anxious', 'knowing', 'background', 'mysterious', 'geologist', 'George', 'hinted', 'sense', 'sickness', 'end', 'whole', 'season', 'retreated', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'claims', 'where', 'will', 'start', 'living', 'Ruth', 'caught', 'talking', 'air', 'when', 'one', 'nearby', 'Kyle', 'Maggie', 'George', 'children', 'also', 'appeared', 'nothing', 'much', 'happen', 'believe', 'George', ""'sickness"", 'been', 'put', 'much', 'earlier', 'season', 'drama', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'successful', 'grabbing', 'hearts', 'audience.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', '4', 'David', 'Fisher', 'portrayed', 'drama', 'queen', 'carjack', 'been', 'excessively', 'attention-seeking', 'over-demanding', 'Keith', 'stereotype', 'homosexual', 'representation', 'TV', 'dramas', 'gays', 'are', 'dramatic', 'reappearance', 'Sarge', 'absurd', 'bringing', 'back', 'Jennifer', 'season', '4', 'also', 'pointless', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'point', 'Keith', 'sleeps', 'female', 'boss', 'who', 'super', 'star', 'end', 'season', '4', 'Keith', 'also', 'hired', 'bodyguard', 'gay', 'film', 'maker', 'order', 'settle', 'down', 'lawsuit', 'David', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'potential', 'plots', 'are', 'now', 'original', 'Fisher', 'family', 'George', 'sick', 'Keith', 'will', 'become', 'slut', 'become', 'money', 'boy', 'What', 'can', '4', 'Fishers', 'still', 'do', 'season', '5', 'Are', 'still', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Nate', 'Brenda', 'break', 'up', 'again', 'Claire', 'hurt', 'again', 'Billy', 'David', 'Keith', 'talking', 'openness', 'open', 'relationship', 'questions', 'seem', 'bit', 'vexing', 'screenwriters', 'indeed.Still', 'think', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'are', 'being', 'under-used', 'whole', 'drama', 'Bettina', 'Ruth', 'Fisher', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'pair', 'female', 'good', 'friends', 'even', 'lovers', 'Sarah', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'interaction', 'Fisher', 'family', 'two', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'strictly', 'staying', 'domain', 'Ruth', 'Fisher']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fourth Season

909115,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B0009NZ2W4,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[2, 2]","If there is a bad episode ofSix Feet Under, I haven't seen it yet.  From the first season to the last episode I've seen (""Untitled,"" the finale of the fourth season) each episode kept me entertained, many of them making me weep and even more of them making me laugh.  The simple fact is that Alan Ball and the staff of this show simply know how to make brilliant television that explores the nature of death and what it means to be in a relationship.That being said, I think this season was certainly the weakest of the bunch.  Don't get me wrong, as I said before, each of the episodes worked well and the overall season was great.  There were even some brilliant standouts that would rival the best of Ball's work, such as ""That's My Dog"" (an evocative, shocking hour of television that I'd compare to Joss Whedon's masterpieceThe Body) and ""Untitled.""  I also feel that fans of the first three seasons of 6FU will like this quite a lot.  What the season doesn't do, however, is step it up a notch like previous seasons did.""Six Feet Under"" has always been a show that defied my expectations, always carrying through with new, crazy, and poignant plots and keeping the drama at a consistently increasing level.  While there are moments here and there in the plot that wowed me, but the rest of it seemed to be static and slightly predictable.  The times when the narrative did ""go there,"" especially in the instances of the George/Ruth relationship, it seemed a bit too out there to grasp.  There were a few plots that fell off or were never developed enough--the character of George's son is the clearest example.  In the beginning of the season, he only existed as a plot device to rationalize the hilarious scenes of excrement being found in the Fisher's mailbox, and later in the season, when they had the chance to re-introduce him as an actual character, all he does is act as a trigger to George's growing paranoia concerning conspiracy theories.Overall, while this doesn't take the drama to the next level the way previous ""Six Feet Under"" seasons have in the past, it's still some of the best television out there.  While a lot of it feels like set-up for the next season, it's still twelve episodes of television well worth watching.8/10",4,"Not As Intense, But Still Very Watchable",1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2249,"['bad', 'episode', 'Feet', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'first', 'season', 'last', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Untitled', 'finale', 'fourth', 'season', 'episode', 'kept', 'entertained', 'many', 'making', 'weep', 'even', 'more', 'making', 'simple', 'fact', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'staff', 'show', 'simply', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'brilliant', 'television', 'nature', 'death', 'what', 'be', 'relationship.That', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'season', 'was', 'certainly', 'weakest', 'bunch', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'said', 'episodes', 'worked', 'well', 'overall', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'were', 'even', 'brilliant', 'standouts', 'would', 'rival', 'best', 'Ball', 'work', 'such', 'My', 'Dog', 'evocative', 'shocking', 'hour', 'television', ""'d"", 'compare', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'masterpieceThe', 'Body', 'Untitled', 'also', 'feel', 'fans', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', '6FU', 'will', 'like', 'lot', 'What', 'season', ""n't"", 'do', 'however', 'step', 'up', 'notch', 'previous', 'seasons', 'did', 'Six', 'Feet', 'always', 'been', 'show', 'defied', 'expectations', 'always', 'carrying', 'new', 'crazy', 'poignant', 'plots', 'keeping', 'drama', 'consistently', 'increasing', 'level', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'plot', 'wowed', 'rest', 'seemed', 'be', 'static', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'times', 'when', 'narrative', 'did', 'go', 'there', 'especially', 'instances', 'George/Ruth', 'relationship', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'out', 'there', 'grasp', 'were', 'few', 'plots', 'fell', 'off', 'were', 'never', 'developed', 'enough', 'character', 'George', 'son', 'clearest', 'example', 'beginning', 'season', 'only', 'existed', 'plot', 'device', 'rationalize', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'excrement', 'being', 'found', 'Fisher', 'mailbox', 'later', 'season', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 're-introduce', 'actual', 'character', 'act', 'trigger', 'George', 'growing', 'paranoia', 'concerning', 'conspiracy', 'theories.Overall', ""n't"", 'take', 'drama', 'next', 'level', 'way', 'previous', 'Six', 'Feet', 'seasons', 'have', 'past', 'still', 'best', 'television', 'there', 'lot', 'set-up', 'next', 'season', 'still', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'television', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.8/10']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fourth Season

Especially the August 25 review by Nicholas Y. B. Wong.*  *  *In four seasons, I've come to love these characters like they're my dear friends.  When a season ends, it's as if I've finished a really long, really fantastic novel that I wish never ended, and hate that I have to wait untold months until the next season.  I subscribed to HBO in time to watch Season 5, and I'm very sad now that 6FU is now gone forever.I'm very pleased to tell you that Season 4 is quite a bit happier than Season 3.  Oh, bad stuff happens, people hurt, people suffer, just like in life.  But you don't have to worry about Nate going through another downward spiral like in Season 3.  Season 4 brings more of the dark, quirky, off-beat humor that seemed almost absent from Season 3 (look for the helium-inflated life-sized bimbo dolls!!).Season 4 picks up immediately where Season 3 left off, with Nate, all beat up and bloody, at Brenda's door.  Over the next 4-5 episodes, Nate is working through the grieving process, dealing with his pain, his loss, and his complicated feelings about Lisa and their relationship.  His path to healing is uneven and rough, and he never quite gets over the loss (no one would).  But Nate does get it together, and once again becomes the old Nate that we all knew and loved so much before the tragic events of Season 3.Brenda is working through her own issues; her regret of mistakes she made in Season 2 influences her behavior in a new relationship; she wants desperately to have a simple, ""normal"" relationship.  But she finds that leaving the past is not so easy.David and Keith are still together.  Unusual for 6FU, there's an episode that focuses almost completely on David and something rather intense that happens to him, that will have implications for the rest of Season 4 (and even Season 5).  This episode is visceral - it really gets under your skin, and not completely in a good way.The newlyweds Ruth and George eventually discover each other's warts, which the initial infatuation hid so well (as it often does in real life).  Kathy Bates shows up again for a few episodes, providing a pleasant distraction for Ruth at a time when she really needs it.Claire, on the other hand, is still suffering from the betrayals she endured in Season 3.  One of my favorite characters in Seasons 1-3, Claire becomes much less likable by the end of Season 4.Season 4 has a few notable guest stars.  Kathy Bates returns for a few episodes.  Mena Suarve (from American Beauty and American Pie - a very patriotic actress judging by the titles of movies she's in) appears for about 5 episodes as Claire's friend, influence, and maybe something more....  Nicole Richie even does a self-deprecating cameo as herself.Most 6FU fans are not squeamish.  Yet, I feel compelled to warn you:  Season 4 contains images and scenes that are more explicit than anything I've ever seen on TV.  Some of the bodies on Rico's table make CSI look like Sesame Street.  There's also a scene where someone puts a gun in their mouth, pulls the trigger, and we see EVERYTHING.  There's a scene where someone picks up a freshly used condom off the floor, holds it up for himself - and us - to see.  And the most explicit man-on-man sex scenes 6FU has ever shown.If you can stomach these kinds of things, and if you're even a casual fan of Six Feet Under, I highly recommend Season 4.",5,"Another winning season of SFU, and much less depressing than Season 3",1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,3484,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'Season', '4', 'yet', 'please', 'be', 'warned', 'many', 'user', 'reviews', 'are', 'FILLED', 'WITH', 'SPOILERS', 'Especially', 'August', '25', 'review', 'Nicholas', 'Y', 'B', 'Wong', '*', '*', '*In', 'four', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'characters', ""'re"", 'dear', 'friends', 'When', 'season', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'really', 'long', 'really', 'fantastic', 'novel', 'wish', 'never', 'ended', 'hate', 'have', 'wait', 'untold', 'months', 'next', 'season', 'subscribed', 'HBO', 'time', 'watch', 'Season', '5', ""'m"", 'very', 'sad', 'now', '6FU', 'now', 'gone', 'forever.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'tell', 'Season', '4', 'quite', 'bit', 'happier', 'Season', '3', 'Oh', 'bad', 'stuff', 'people', 'hurt', 'people', 'suffer', 'just', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'Nate', 'going', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Season', '3', 'Season', '4', 'more', 'dark', 'quirky', 'off-beat', 'humor', 'seemed', 'almost', 'absent', 'Season', '3', 'look', 'helium-inflated', 'life-sized', 'bimbo', 'dolls', '.Season', '4', 'picks', 'up', 'immediately', 'where', 'Season', '3', 'left', 'off', 'Nate', 'beat', 'up', 'bloody', 'Brenda', 'door', 'next', '4-5', 'episodes', 'Nate', 'working', 'grieving', 'process', 'dealing', 'pain', 'loss', 'complicated', 'feelings', 'Lisa', 'relationship', 'path', 'healing', 'uneven', 'rough', 'never', 'quite', 'loss', 'one', 'would', 'Nate', 'get', 'together', 'once', 'again', 'old', 'Nate', 'knew', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'tragic', 'events', 'Season', '3.Brenda', 'working', 'own', 'issues', 'regret', 'mistakes', 'made', 'Season', '2', 'influences', 'behavior', 'new', 'relationship', 'desperately', 'have', 'simple', 'normal', 'relationship', 'leaving', 'past', 'not', 'so', 'easy.David', 'Keith', 'are', 'still', 'together', 'Unusual', '6FU', 'episode', 'almost', 'completely', 'David', 'something', 'rather', 'intense', 'will', 'have', 'implications', 'rest', 'Season', '4', 'even', 'Season', '5', 'episode', 'visceral', 'really', 'skin', 'not', 'completely', 'good', 'way.The', 'newlyweds', 'Ruth', 'George', 'eventually', 'discover', 'other', 'warts', 'initial', 'infatuation', 'hid', 'so', 'well', 'often', 'real', 'life', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'up', 'again', 'few', 'episodes', 'providing', 'pleasant', 'distraction', 'Ruth', 'time', 'when', 'really', 'it.Claire', 'other', 'hand', 'still', 'suffering', 'betrayals', 'endured', 'Season', '3', 'One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'Claire', 'much', 'less', 'likable', 'end', 'Season', '4.Season', '4', 'few', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'returns', 'few', 'episodes', 'Mena', 'Suarve', 'American', 'Beauty', 'American', 'Pie', 'very', 'patriotic', 'actress', 'judging', 'titles', 'movies', '5', 'episodes', 'Claire', 'friend', 'influence', 'maybe', 'something', 'more', 'Nicole', 'Richie', 'even', 'self-deprecating', 'cameo', 'herself.Most', '6FU', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'squeamish', 'feel', 'compelled', 'warn', 'Season', '4', 'contains', 'images', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'explicit', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'bodies', 'Rico', 'table', 'make', 'CSI', 'look', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'gun', 'mouth', 'trigger', 'see', 'EVERYTHING', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'up', 'freshly', 'used', 'condom', 'floor', 'up', 'see', 'most', 'explicit', 'man-on-man', 'sex', 'scenes', '6FU', 'ever', 'shown.If', 'can', 'stomach', 'kinds', 'things', ""'re"", 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'Six', 'Feet', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Season', '4']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fourth Season
909121,A36Y2UJIH0L3E2,B0009NZ2W4,"S. Lee ""Art Not in Heaven""","[8, 11]","Marathon-watching the fourth season again in several months, what strikes me most is that it's not as dark as I remembered it was. It has many moments of a subtle humor, not exactly a ""dark humor,"" more of a ""joco-serious"" kind readers of Joyce find in his works. For instance, in ""Terror Starts at Home"" episode. Claire and two other friends from the art school make graffiti/art on a wall, when Claire says ""How many evil-doers do you have to kill before you become one yourself?"" and Edie (Mena Suvari) replies, ""Totally."" I remembered this scene to be darker. A giggle at the absurdity perhaps, but essentially a painful glimpse into Claire's growing pains, her wondering why she has to hate everyone and everything so. Watching it this time, it felt much more light-hearted. And I had more than a giggle, especially at the way Edie says ""Totally.""Another such ""joco-serious"" moment comes during David's birthday party in the same episode. Claire is completely stoned at the table, making everyone uncomfortable. Finally Ruth asks her to help her ""clear the table,"" to which Vanessa stands up to help, and Claire sarcastic-in-a-stoned way says, ""Only women are clearing."" Hearing this, Rico and Keith stand up to help, and Claire goes: ""Only women and people of color are clearing."" SFU fans would see why these moments are so funny and funny in a--I don't know, American culture's self-reflective, self-deprecating way? I don't know how to put this, but one reason I just love SFU is that, in it, even really small moments in the mundane life of the Fisher family can be taken as wider, American, cultural moments. Maybe this is an over-reaction on my part, as a student of American literature and culture.If the viewer has been ruminating why Brenda keeps being self-destructive, one definite answer is to be found in this season, which is in the triangle she forms with Joe and Nate. While in a relationship with Joe, she repeats what she did when she was with Nate and sleeps with him. To Brenda who insists that her behavior is partly Joe's fault, Nate retorts: ""No, it's you. I of all people should know that. I used be Joe."" When Joe finally walks in and see the two about to have sex, he memorably sums up what makes Brenda so essentially an insecure person: ""What do you call a person without integrity, without honesty, without loyalty? I call it a f**king waste of my time."" To Brenda's excuse that it is all about sex, his answer: ""It's not sex, it's betrayal. That is your f**king addiction.""Watching it again, I enjoy and cherish all these moments. Overall, the fourth season was even better than I remembered it to be.",5,"it's not sex, it's betrayal, that's your addiction...",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,2637,"['Marathon-watching', 'fourth', 'season', 'again', 'several', 'months', 'what', 'most', 'not', 'as', 'dark', 'remembered', 'was', 'many', 'moments', 'subtle', 'humor', 'not', 'exactly', 'dark', 'humor', 'more', 'joco-serious', 'kind', 'readers', 'Joyce', 'find', 'works', 'instance', 'Terror', 'Home', 'episode', 'Claire', 'two', 'other', 'friends', 'art', 'school', 'make', 'graffiti/art', 'wall', 'when', 'Claire', 'How', 'many', 'evil-doers', 'do', 'have', 'kill', 'become', 'one', 'Edie', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Totally', 'remembered', 'scene', 'be', 'darker', 'giggle', 'absurdity', 'perhaps', 'essentially', 'painful', 'glimpse', 'Claire', 'growing', 'pains', 'wondering', 'why', 'hate', 'everyone', 'everything', 'so', 'Watching', 'time', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'had', 'more', 'giggle', 'especially', 'way', 'Edie', 'Totally', 'such', 'joco-serious', 'moment', 'David', 'birthday', 'party', 'same', 'episode', 'Claire', 'completely', 'stoned', 'table', 'making', 'everyone', 'uncomfortable', 'Finally', 'Ruth', 'help', 'clear', 'table', 'Vanessa', 'up', 'help', 'Claire', 'sarcastic-in-a-stoned', 'way', 'Only', 'women', 'are', 'clearing', 'Hearing', 'Rico', 'Keith', 'stand', 'up', 'help', 'Claire', 'Only', 'women', 'people', 'color', 'are', 'clearing', 'SFU', 'fans', 'would', 'see', 'why', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'American', 'culture', 'self-reflective', 'self-deprecating', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'put', 'one', 'reason', 'just', 'love', 'SFU', 'even', 'really', 'small', 'moments', 'mundane', 'life', 'Fisher', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'wider', 'American', 'cultural', 'moments', 'Maybe', 'over-reaction', 'part', 'student', 'American', 'literature', 'culture.If', 'viewer', 'been', 'ruminating', 'why', 'Brenda', 'being', 'self-destructive', 'one', 'definite', 'answer', 'be', 'found', 'season', 'triangle', 'Joe', 'Nate', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'what', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'Nate', 'sleeps', 'Brenda', 'who', 'behavior', 'partly', 'Joe', 'fault', 'Nate', 'No', 'people', 'should', 'know', 'used', 'be', 'Joe', 'When', 'Joe', 'finally', 'see', 'two', 'have', 'sex', 'memorably', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'Brenda', 'so', 'essentially', 'insecure', 'person', 'What', 'do', 'call', 'person', 'integrity', 'honesty', 'loyalty', 'call', 'f**king', 'waste', 'time', 'Brenda', 'excuse', 'sex', 'answer', 'not', 'sex', 'betrayal', 'f**king', 'addiction', 'Watching', 'again', 'enjoy', 'cherish', 'moments', 'Overall', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'remembered', 'be']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fourth Season
