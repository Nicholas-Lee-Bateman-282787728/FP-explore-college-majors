This is one of my all time favorite movies, so I was so HAPPY when I read the comments of everyone liking it so much. Not many have heard of this movie, so I am always recommending it to people. Great screenplay, great casting, great love, great courage, great faith, great life lessons to be learned, and great acting. Djimon Hounsou, Wes Bentley, and Michael Sheen all shine with their performances in this movie! I have always been a HUGE Heath Ledger fan, and after The Patriot, I feel this film really shows Heath's caliber for serious acting early on in his career! I DEARLY miss Heath Ledger's presence on screen; his death was truly a tragedy! He had so many more Oscars to win. It always amazes me how many Heath Ledger fans have never seen The Four Feathers. I have owned The Four Feathers since it was released on DVD years ago. I've watched it probably 100 times, I even fall asleep to it... &#34;God put you in my way&#34; - GREAT line from the movie!

He's given them because he quits the regiment when he hears that they're being sent to the Sudan.  Each feather is from a single person, and each feather carries with it a story throughout the entire movie-not unlike the feather motif found in Forrest Gump.  I found this to be an extemely good movie.  I was not dissatisfied in anyway, and my only thought after seeing it was ""WOW!  I hope I can write a story like that someday!""  In the end, this story isn't so much about courage as it is the common honor associated with real acts of selfless courage.

602512,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLO2,A Customer,"[5, 6]","Summary:Harry Faversham (Heath Ledger) is the son of a famous military officer and is a star cadet in an upscale military training school in England.  He is surrounded by friends that adore him and is in love with a woman that everyone seems to think is beautiful, Ethne (Kate Hudson).  But when it comes time to go to war, Harry ops out and disgraces both himself and his family.  As a result, three of his closest friends and his now fianc&eacute;e, Ethne, give him white feathers, symbolic of cowardice.The gesture gets to Harry and he ends up deciding to prove everyone wrong by going to the war zone anyway and doing his best to protect his friends.  While there he meets an African native who becomes the best example of friendship in the entire movie, Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou), and is probably the coolest character.  The movie kind of ends ambiguously and you are left wondering about a lot of things.My Comments:Combining this movie with Changing Lanes for a night of entertainment, which my wife and I did, was a major mistake.  Both of the movies just drag on and on.This one actually has one major scene that is pretty exciting (when the British regiment is tricked and ambushed), but the rest of the movie is very slow - especially the beginning.  I can understand that the intent is to delve into the relationships of the characters and the mind of Harry, but there are still a lot of completely unnecessary scenes that don't advance the story at all.As for the acting, it wasn't too bad.  My wife was convinced by it and I especially liked Djimon Hounsou and Wes Bentley (who played Jack Durrance).  Heath Ledger wasn't too bad, but I think he actually had a pretty bad story to work with, which isn't really his fault.As for the story, it was very much piecemeal.  It jumped from here to there and, though it wasn't hard to follow, it wasn't always clear why they were leaving some things out and including some things that seemed completely irrelevant.  I think the story was just lacking a clear and linear plot, despite not having anachronistic scenes.Overall, except for the ambush scene and the scenes involving Djimon Hounsou, the movie was kind of boring.  It doesn't move very fast and doesn't really suck you into the relationships and characters and get you to relate.

602514,AM18CU72YEWH5,B00005JLO2,A. J Terry,"[6, 10]","Visually ""The Four Feathers"" is a gorgeous film; but nonstop action is so heavily emphasized at the expense of plot and character development, that the film makes almost no sense.I could almost take it on faith that the focal character, Harry what's-his-name, might impulsively flee to the Sudan in an attempt to redeem his honor and help his former fellow officers and friends. However, it was never at any point clear what his overall plan was for helping them, or even if he ever had any. In one scene an Arab go-between tells Harry he needs to learn Arabic; and Harry apparently instantly and effortlessly learns enough Arabic, as well as enough about local culture, to pass as a Bedouin among both native peoples and the British. Worst of all, Harry and other characters are repeatedly abandoned in the most barren desert; and except for one instance (where they also get help from a native), with no transportation except their feet, no food or water, no guide, and no map, and usually when they're in bad physical shape to start with--yet somehow they always survive. Added to many other improbabilities, all this strains credibility too far, even for an action film.It's a shame, because with a slower pace and more character development, this could have been an intriguing and much more subtle film. The theme is very much male love and comradeship--Harry's fiancee Ethne doesn't matter to him nearly as much as his male friends. So, when Harry's friend Jack announces to that same group of friends that he (Jack) is also getting engaged, and one of those friends congratulates Jack with pain and great reluctance--well, a modern viewer can't help but wonder exactly _how_ intimate these man-to-man relationships are.Then there's Harry's cultural identity. There is a period when he is impressed into almost-slavery by a British regiment (to whom, for unexplained reasons, he has not revealed his true identity). The soldiers crack whips, and Harry and natives of various races spend days laboriously struggling to move the British baggage vehicles, etc. through the desert as fast as possible. Seeing the worst side of colonization, does Harry ever gain sympathy for the natives and lose sympathy for the British cause? Then there's Harry's incredibly faithful native sidekick, whose name I've forgotten. The native's deep devotion to Harry is owing to his even deeper devotion to Mohammedism; Allah has told him to protect Harry. Does Mohammedism ever look more appealing to Jack than the Church of England?In other words, why doesn't Harry just chuck the whole British cause and go native? After all, there's ""nothing left for him at home."" His relationships with his father and his fiancee seem destroyed, his army career is over, he has no money and no prospects.Logical as all these questions seem, ""The Four Feathers"" not only does not answer them, it doesn't even acknowledge that they exist.",3,"High production values, but doesn't make sense",1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,2909,"['Visually', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'nonstop', 'action', 'so', 'heavily', 'emphasized', 'expense', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'almost', 'sense.I', 'could', 'almost', 'take', 'faith', 'focal', 'character', 'Harry', ""what's-his-name"", 'might', 'impulsively', 'flee', 'Sudan', 'attempt', 'redeem', 'honor', 'help', 'former', 'fellow', 'officers', 'friends', 'However', 'was', 'never', 'point', 'clear', 'what', 'overall', 'plan', 'was', 'helping', 'even', 'ever', 'had', 'one', 'scene', 'Arab', 'go-between', 'tells', 'Harry', 'learn', 'Arabic', 'Harry', 'apparently', 'instantly', 'effortlessly', 'enough', 'Arabic', 'as', 'well', 'enough', 'local', 'culture', 'pass', 'Bedouin', 'native', 'peoples', 'British', 'Worst', 'Harry', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'abandoned', 'most', 'barren', 'desert', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'also', 'get', 'help', 'native', 'transportation', 'feet', 'food', 'water', 'guide', 'map', 'usually', 'when', ""'re"", 'bad', 'physical', 'shape', 'start', 'yet', 'somehow', 'always', 'survive', 'Added', 'many', 'other', 'improbabilities', 'credibility', 'too', 'far', 'even', 'action', 'film.It', 'shame', 'slower', 'pace', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'intriguing', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'film', 'theme', 'very', 'much', 'male', 'love', 'comradeship', 'Harry', 'fiancee', 'Ethne', ""n't"", 'matter', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'male', 'friends', 'So', 'when', 'Harry', 'friend', 'Jack', 'same', 'group', 'friends', 'Jack', 'also', 'getting', 'engaged', 'one', 'friends', 'Jack', 'pain', 'great', 'reluctance', 'well', 'modern', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'exactly', '_how_', 'intimate', 'man-to-man', 'relationships', 'Harry', 'cultural', 'identity', 'period', 'when', 'impressed', 'almost-slavery', 'British', 'regiment', 'whom', 'unexplained', 'reasons', 'not', 'revealed', 'true', 'identity', 'soldiers', 'crack', 'whips', 'Harry', 'natives', 'various', 'races', 'spend', 'days', 'laboriously', 'struggling', 'move', 'British', 'baggage', 'vehicles', 'etc', 'desert', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'Seeing', 'worst', 'side', 'colonization', 'Harry', 'ever', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'natives', 'lose', 'sympathy', 'British', 'cause', 'Then', 'Harry', 'incredibly', 'faithful', 'native', 'sidekick', 'name', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'native', 'deep', 'devotion', 'Harry', 'owing', 'even', 'deeper', 'devotion', 'Mohammedism', 'Allah', 'told', 'protect', 'Harry', 'Does', 'Mohammedism', 'ever', 'look', 'more', 'appealing', 'Jack', 'Church', 'England', 'other', 'words', 'why', ""n't"", 'Harry', 'just', 'chuck', 'whole', 'British', 'cause', 'go', 'native', 'nothing', 'left', 'home', 'relationships', 'father', 'fiancee', 'seem', 'destroyed', 'army', 'career', 'over', 'money', 'prospects.Logical', 'questions', 'seem', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'answer', ""n't"", 'even', 'acknowledge', 'exist']",N/A

The main story is Heath Ledger quitting the army on the eve of being sent off to fight a war in Sudan for Britain.  This brings disgrace to his family, friends and fiancee.  They each give him a white feather as a symbol of cowardice.  This forces Ledger to think hard of a way to redeem himself in the eyes of his friends and Ethne.  He decides to go off into the dessert disquised as a Muslim warrior to help the British army.  It was a losing battle, and Ledger tries his best to save his friends with the help of Djimon Hounsou (who rescues him from near death in the desert).  Hounsou plays a Christian who believes that Ledger was sent to him by God to protect and help.  He does just that, saving him on more than one occasion from certain death.The real appeal to me of watching this film was my expectation of a great action movie along the lines of Braveheart.  Although I wasn't disappointed with what they managed to piece together (especially that climactic battle sequence with the British army in a Square formation surrounded and outnumbered on all sides), I wasn't entirely impressed with it either.  For one, the fight scenes weren't gory enough.  Soldiers hack at their enemies with their bayonets, but we only see their backs.  The cavalry has perfect aim and can take down a charging mob of Muslim soldiers on horses (without hitting a single horse).  No limbs flew off, people even managed to escape.  About the only thing I found impressive was Ledger mounting a horse while in motion.As for the romance that goes on with Ledger and Hudson's character.  There was too little of it in terms of screentime and affection shown.  I thought their engagement announcement was a joke.  There were no real commanding performances rendered.  Ok, maybe Hounsou breathed some life into the story (but I read that his character is not even part of the original story this film is based on).  Hounsou's cameraderie with Ledger in the desert is noteworthy.  (But again, he must have superman's back because despite getting lashed repeatedly on the back we do not a single scar or welt mark.)So, see this film if you like a) Heath Ledger, b) Djimon Hounsou, c) unbelievable battle scenes, d) invincible horses or e) all of the above.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3.5 (I enjoyed the dialogue between the characters.

The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever.

I know that this isn't popular opinion (by like anyone really), but I actually really liked this 2002 remake and consider it a superior production on nearly all levels (outside of that particular performance).At the very beginning of Heath Ledger's career (and by career I mean stardom, which is anything post-A Knights Tale) he tackled this remake of the 1939 classic (I use that term because of the general consensus of the film) and it was pretty much panned by critics.  It didn't matter, considering his talent and his good looks, and so his career continued to soar (something that can't really be said for either Wes Bentley or Kate Hudson), but it doesn't negate the fact that many consider this a stinker of a film and a missed opportunity.  I honestly had no idea that this was the FIFTH film adaptation of Mason's novel, but outside of the 1939 film I have yet to see any of the others.The story is an interesting one that encapsulates loyalty, cowardice and political responsibility as well as redemption of character.  It's a beautifully shot film and draws you in from scene to scene, and it is quite well acted, especially from Ledger and Sir-Screamsalot (yes, Djimon Hounsou is in this).

602520,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,B00005JLO2,Angela,"[2, 2]","Foreshadowing happens early in Shekhar Kapur's bomb, The Four Feathers. Over the wailing ""Oriental"" vocals, reminiscent of India, Arabia or Persia, or even just the dystopias of near-future Los Angeles (Blade Runner), anyway, reminiscent of the Other, we watch a good ol' boy rugby match at a military training college in late 19th century England. With each tackle and toss, the characters (and their destinies) are swiftly established: the cautious Harry Feversham (Heath Ledger), his reliable and loyal BFF, Jack (Wes Bentley, spectacularly beautiful), the child-like Castleton (Kris Marshall), and his protector, Trench (MICHAEL SHEEN!), and the guy who never listens to his mates to just pass the bloody ball, Willoughby (Rupert Penry-Jones). This juxtaposition of Eastern music set to the most stiff-upper-lip of British rituals, at the edge of Western imperialism's height, is indeed a nice moment. You can sense the blurring of boundaries, and how increasingly irrelevant Kipling's pronouncement becomes as colonies rebel and twains do, sometimes painfully, meet. It's an interesting comment on how much of British identity during the colonial period was defined elsewhere, away from the actual island.But for a film with such a broad, epic palette, the story is much less concerned with the geopolitics of Orientalism. It barely touches these themes in any meaningful way (such a shame! Mr. Kapur, why!?), but instead it remains insular, telling its narrow story dutifully and telling it with very pretty aesthetics indeed. Mr. Kapur films some of those soul-trembling vistas with the same love and awe that dominated David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.The story, based on a colonial-era novel by A.E.W. Mason (The Four Feathers (Classic Reprint)), explores the rocky road to redemption one scion of British imperialism must endure after he gets cold feet before his first orders to war. When Harry Feversham, one of the bright young stars in officer training, is given orders to ship from his cozy British Elysium to the harsh bloodletting in the Sudan (to replace, his superiors tell him, a British regiment which was slaughtered ""to the man""), he waffles for a day or two and then resigns. No, thank you, old chap. This earns him the shock and scorn of his once-admiring loved ones. He receives four feathers, symbolizing cowardice, his fiancee breaks off the engagement and his old military father disowns him. After waffling a bit more, Harry decides it's worse to live like a social zombie and so he packs up his things and heads to Sudan anyway to see if he can earn back his manly pride.In the meanwhile, his army buddies are having a helluva time beating off the repeated guerilla attacks of a local rebel leader, Muhammad Ahmad, the self-proclaimed Mahdi. In a beautifully filmed sequence, the British forces are ambushed - just as Harry comes barelling in to warn them. He spends the rest of the film collecting his friends and shipping them home - one has been blinded, one killed, another imprisoned. Eventually, his dedication, courage and strength earn everyone's admiration again. At one point, his friend, Abou (Djimon Hounsou), laughs at him for waaay overcompensating. After Harry confesses that he is a coward, Abou starts to laugh: ""When I found you, you were half-dead in the desert! Traveling alone!""There are some clever visual parallels which run throughout the film. When Harry and his fiancee, Ethne (Kate Hudson, so cute), announce their engagement, the British soldiers form a square around them, boxing in their celebratory dance. Later, this same square is used - to disastrous effect - as a military strategy in Sudan. The destruction of the square signals the end of our fancy British character's colonial confidence. (""You British walk too proudly upon the Earth,"" Abou chides Harry in one scene.)We could probably wax theoretical about how squares and sharp edges - Harry and his buddies are all crisp uniforms and clacking heels, and the most disastrous strategist turns out to be the one who was fussiest about keeping every hair in place - are placed in contrast to the rolling, softening dunes of the desert and the curve of Djimon Hounsou's biceps (which are glorious). No right angles here, old chaps! Similarly, Harry and Trench, in the lengthy sequence which accompanies their escape from prison, undergo radical physical changes, the sharp edges of their haircuts and jawlines are replaced by unruly beards and haphazard curls. This reminded us of a brilliant bit in Michael Ondaatje'sThe English Patient, when the narrator marvels at the changes undergone by the Canadian thief, Caravaggio, during his time in wartorn Italy: the exact description is that he's been ""softened"".Djimon Hounsou seems perpetually stuck in the stereotypical and limited role of the noble savage. As usual, he is dignified and physically magnificent, and our (white) heroes rely on his sympathy and aid to get them through this Foreign Adventure. Okay. Sure. Fine. When will he stop being the Other? Mr. Hounsou, please fight against this type-casting! You can be Anakin Skywalker in our Star Wars-as-neo-dystopia remake!Heath Ledger's performance is charming and authentic, his inherent likability making even the earlier scenes, when Harry chickens out, entirely sympathetic. Wes Bentley, who disappeared from films after his smash debut in American Beauty and has now reemerged after rehab from drug addiction is almost mind-blowingly beautiful. His role is likewise built to maintain an aura of modest heroism. That said, he could have invested an interesting character with a lot more depth, but he keeps things just skin-deep. We have a soft spot for Kate Hudson, since we love Goldie Hawn, but she has absolutely nothing to do - this is a very male-only film.We saw this in theatres back in 2002, and remembered it only for being vaguely insubstantial and unsatisfying. Now, with the sharpening of our movie feelings thanks to this blog (yay PPCC!), we can identify that airiness as coming from a lack of follow-through: Kapur had such an opportunity to inject this movie with passion - about politics, about colonialism, about machismo or about forgiveness - but he never really goes for it. Anyway, the reason we came back to it now was because of our Michael Sheen binge, and his role, as the clownish officer Trench, who later becomes a prisoner of war, is (we were surprised to realize!) one of the only things which we did remember well from 2002. Harry's discovery of Trench in the thronging mob of Omdurman prison is a moment of almost magical elation - and Trench's recognition of Harry is even better.Indeed, while the film frittered away a nice opportunity to say something more, it did do just service to a neat story - there are some brilliant, evocative moments centered around Harry's deception and recognition, and some moments were nice enough to yoke a tear or two. All in all, the narrative drive was fabulous, and we reckon we could use this story as an example on how to build a good plot structure when we write the book that will make us millions: Movies: A

602524,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B00005JLO2,"B-MAN ""B""","[7, 9]","6th version of ""Four Feathers"" (the first was in 1915) stars Heath Ledger as a British soldier who decides he wants to resign his commission right after he and the troops are ordered to go to the Sudan desert for battle.  The cinematography and battle scenes are exciting.  However, there are many problems with this film and the ending pretty much screws it (don't worry I won't reveal it, but I intend to complain about it in a nonrevealing fashion!).  First, none of the stars are British and this is a movie concerning British people.  Some actors have the capability of pulling this off, but not the two American leads (Kate Hudson, Wes Bentley) and definitely not Ledger, who is really Australian.  It reminds me of that story about how Sean Connery had to be coached in his mannerisms, voice, etc., before he could play James Bond because initially he was just too ""rough"" or whatever.  It helps to realize that films are sold most times on the basis of the stars in them and everything else next.  I mean how many times have you recommended a movie to someone and the first thing they ask is ""Who's in it?"", as if that will make the film worthwhile.)I'll move on because there are bigger weaknesses that hurt this film more than having non-British actors portray the lead British characters somewhat ineffectively.  There are many ""whys"" in the story. There is not enough time spent on the relationship between Ledger and Hudson so I never really understood the attraction, especially on the part of Ledger's character because Hudson's Ethne has no depth and once she participates in shunning him, its like who cares? drop her.  I'm sorry but if you call your soon to be spouse a coward and deeply wound and turn your back on them when they needed one person to support them, you don't love that person.  Then there is Ledger's best friend Jack (Bentley), who of course is jealous of Ledger and Hudson's relationship but not enough to do any harm to them or prevent them from being together. Yes, Jack wants Ethne too, but why?  I never figured it out. He even wants to be with her more after she gives Harry a feather.  What?  Jack's his best friend, right?  (With friends like these...) The other main character is Abou, played by Djimon Hounsou, who, I'm sorry, but can play this role in his sleep by now (see Amistad, Gladiator, etc.).  He is drawn to help Harry (Ledger) and puts himself in danger several times to save his life, but why? Even Harry wonders that until Abou explains ""because God put you in my way.""  I guess after going through all the extreme danger and torture to save Harry, Abou's path was clear and Harry was taken ""out of his way"" because Abou just walks off casually with one of those facing away waves.  Huh?  Seriously, we're supposed to believe that such a significant bond between two men who have faced death together several times ends as if all Abou did was help Harry change a tire?The biggest problem I have with ""Four Feathers"" is the ending.  I won't tell what happens, but I will tell you that saying it had a tacked on happy ending would be putting it very lightly.  This ending was so out of place it didnt belong in the same film!  It's as if the filmmakers (who I think thought the audience wasnt paying attention through some of the film) wanted the viewer to walk away with this mindless smile on their face.  It is amazing the impact the ending of a movie, that last shot, can make on your opinion and experience of the entire film.

602529,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JLO2,C. B Collins Jr.,"[7, 10]","This beautiful film is very complex, with a few flaws, but overall a good exploration of the concept of commitment.Whereas the plot requires that the script be spun around the concept of cowardice, the four feather insult, and the lengthy redemption - there is an underlying and subtle theme of commitment that rings very true.Commitment itself is a complex emotion since commitment to one person or idea may compete with commitment to other folks or ideas. This is the dilema that faces handsome Harry Haversham, played well by the ever changing chameleon Heath Ledger.Harry has made a decision to join the army due to family commitments, specifically his father who is a general. He has made commitments to his buddies, his fellow soldiers. Thi is especially true for his commitment to his best friend, Jack Durrance (played beautifully by Wes Bentley). He has made commitments to his young fiance, Ethne Eustace, played by Kate Hudson. And he has commitments to himself, for he never wished to become a soldier and go to war. A British offensive in the Sudan is the catalyst for Harry to resign his commission as an officer in the army and leave the armed services.Harry decides to honor the commitment to himself, imagining that his relationship with Ethne will not change. Yet she is deeply impacted and can not imagine their life together if they are social outcasts.And so, by honoring his commitment to himself, Harry does not honor his commitment to Queen and country, to his father, to his fiance, and to his buddies. After the fellows become fully sunk in the wasp nest of the Sudan, Harry becomes greatly concerned at the report of the high number of deaths of British soldiers. He makes his way to the Sudan to save and protect his buddies and redeem himself in the eyes of others.During this dramatic struggle Harry undergoes some of the trials and tribulations of the hero, many of which are explained in the writings of Joseph Campbell. For example, in many myths regarding heroes, the hero shows kindness to a lesser being and in turn is rewarded. Harry shows kindness to an African tribal princess who spares his life when her tribesman kills the camel train leader.The struggles intensify as Harry becomes an observant pawn in a strategic struggle between Sudanese Islamic insurgents and British imperial troops.At this point he meets Abu Fatma, played exceptionally well by Djimon Hounsou. Djimon is an absolute mountain of muscle, a giant imposing character. Here the film becomes Jungian for in many ways Abu is Harry's shadow, the confrontation with the dark side of the self which brings about a stronger integrated personality. In classic Jungian theory, the Shadow is at first feared,and then becomes a guide into deeper feelings, and finally is integrated into the personality resulting in a stronger character with greater insight and compassion. This is exactly what happens in this partnership between Harry and Abu.In the end, Harry undertakes feats of incredible bravery and daring. He redeems himself in the eyes of those who saw him as a coward. He does this not only through brave acts but by integration of competing forces within his personality. Harry emerges a far more centered man after his encounter in the desert with his shadow.There are other well developed sub-themes such as Jack Durrance's heroism and sacrifice first of his eyes and then of his relationship with Ethne.The film ends with a fine speech by Jack Durrance about commitment to an abstract Queen and country as compared to commitment to the flesh and blood concrete reality of those comrades with whom we have bonded. And thus this parable tells us that our first commitment is to self, and then to those we love, but there is sometimes a steep price to pay for our commitments.The grand sweeping palaces of England and the desolate prisons hidden in  African deserts offer vastly different views of the world of the British Empire. The film takes us on a grand journey of the eyes and of the character.",4,What is the price of commitment?,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,4013,"['beautiful', 'film', 'very', 'complex', 'few', 'flaws', 'good', 'exploration', 'concept', 'commitment.Whereas', 'plot', 'script', 'be', 'spun', 'concept', 'cowardice', 'four', 'feather', 'insult', 'lengthy', 'redemption', 'underlying', 'subtle', 'theme', 'commitment', 'very', 'true.Commitment', 'complex', 'emotion', 'commitment', 'one', 'person', 'idea', 'may', 'compete', 'commitment', 'other', 'folks', 'ideas', 'dilema', 'handsome', 'Harry', 'Haversham', 'played', 'well', 'ever', 'changing', 'chameleon', 'Heath', 'Ledger.Harry', 'made', 'decision', 'join', 'army', 'due', 'family', 'commitments', 'specifically', 'father', 'who', 'general', 'made', 'commitments', 'buddies', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'Thi', 'especially', 'true', 'commitment', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Durrance', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'made', 'commitments', 'young', 'fiance', 'Ethne', 'Eustace', 'played', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'commitments', 'never', 'wished', 'become', 'soldier', 'go', 'war', 'British', 'offensive', 'Sudan', 'catalyst', 'Harry', 'resign', 'commission', 'officer', 'army', 'leave', 'armed', 'services.Harry', 'honor', 'commitment', 'imagining', 'relationship', 'Ethne', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'deeply', 'impacted', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'life', 'together', 'are', 'social', 'outcasts.And', 'so', 'honoring', 'commitment', 'Harry', 'not', 'honor', 'commitment', 'Queen', 'country', 'father', 'fiance', 'buddies', 'fellows', 'become', 'fully', 'sunk', 'wasp', 'nest', 'Sudan', 'Harry', 'greatly', 'concerned', 'report', 'high', 'number', 'deaths', 'British', 'soldiers', 'way', 'Sudan', 'save', 'protect', 'buddies', 'redeem', 'eyes', 'others.During', 'dramatic', 'struggle', 'Harry', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'hero', 'many', 'are', 'explained', 'writings', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'example', 'many', 'myths', 'regarding', 'heroes', 'hero', 'kindness', 'lesser', 'being', 'turn', 'rewarded', 'Harry', 'kindness', 'African', 'tribal', 'princess', 'who', 'life', 'when', 'tribesman', 'camel', 'train', 'leader.The', 'struggles', 'intensify', 'Harry', 'observant', 'pawn', 'strategic', 'struggle', 'Sudanese', 'Islamic', 'insurgents', 'British', 'imperial', 'troops.At', 'point', 'Abu', 'Fatma', 'played', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Djimon', 'absolute', 'mountain', 'muscle', 'giant', 'imposing', 'character', 'Here', 'film', 'Jungian', 'many', 'ways', 'Abu', 'Harry', 'shadow', 'confrontation', 'dark', 'side', 'self', 'stronger', 'integrated', 'personality', 'classic', 'Jungian', 'theory', 'Shadow', 'first', 'feared', 'then', 'guide', 'deeper', 'feelings', 'finally', 'integrated', 'personality', 'resulting', 'stronger', 'character', 'greater', 'insight', 'compassion', 'exactly', 'what', 'partnership', 'Harry', 'Abu.In', 'end', 'Harry', 'feats', 'incredible', 'bravery', 'daring', 'eyes', 'who', 'saw', 'coward', 'not', 'only', 'brave', 'acts', 'integration', 'competing', 'forces', 'personality', 'Harry', 'far', 'more', 'centered', 'man', 'encounter', 'desert', 'shadow.There', 'are', 'other', 'well', 'developed', 'sub-themes', 'such', 'Jack', 'Durrance', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'first', 'eyes', 'then', 'relationship', 'Ethne.The', 'film', 'fine', 'speech', 'Jack', 'Durrance', 'commitment', 'abstract', 'Queen', 'country', 'as', 'compared', 'commitment', 'flesh', 'blood', 'concrete', 'reality', 'comrades', 'whom', 'have', 'bonded', 'thus', 'parable', 'tells', 'first', 'commitment', 'self', 'then', 'love', 'sometimes', 'steep', 'price', 'pay', 'commitments.The', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'palaces', 'England', 'desolate', 'prisons', 'hidden', 'African', 'deserts', 'offer', 'vastly', 'different', 'views', 'world', 'British', 'Empire', 'film', 'grand', 'journey', 'eyes', 'character']",N/A

Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 6]","Having no expectations when watching Shekhar Kapur's &quot;Four Feathers,&quot; I found this earnest film to be a genuine surprise. Costume epics of this type have not been en vogue since the &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; days of David Lean. That's too bad, because during the far-too-brief 130-minute running time, I was captivated, enthralled and eventually frustrated.This majestic story, based on the 1902 A.E.W. Mason novel, deserves at least a three-hour running time. My guess is that much of the footage was left on the cutting room floor so that our ever inpatient youth wouldn't squirm too much. The pace of this film is jumpy, and the story difficult to follow at times. The transition from England to the Sudan happens far too quickly, with the early character-establishing scenes feeling rushed.Heath Ledger is excellent in the lead role of a 19th century British soldier who resigns on the eve of war. His fiancee (Kate Hudson) and three of his best friends give him four white feathers, a symbolic gesture of cowardice, and he's even disowned by his father. Needless-to-say, Heath is having a very bad day. Rather than accept his fate, he travels to the Sudan on the heels of his soldier friends to prove his mettle, posing at different times as a slave, a spy and a native.Djimon Hounsou eventually enters the film as a philosophical native who befriends Ledger, serving as his Sudan guardian angel. I have always appreciated Hounsou's unique presence in films (&quot;Gladiator&quot;), and he continues his string of excellent character work with &quot;Four Feathers.&quot;Of course, there's a great battle, and Heath finds himself on the opposite side of the British Army. Amdist the smoke, fire and bullets, he's eventually trying to save his friends while furiously fighting off the Sudan natives. Throw into this potent mix his interesting relationship with his best friend, wonderfully played by Wes Bentley, who's in love with his fiancee.The stuff of misty romance and glorious British sensibility, &quot;Four Feathers&quot; plays like a sweeping novel. For the most part, the intricate storylines play out with great satisfaction. But the jump to the Sudan happens far too quickly, and we are left asking why Mr. Ledger resigned from the British army in the first place. It's telling that as a viewer, when this film ended, I wanted more. The performances are uniformly superb, the period detail exceptional and the attitude earnest. But this deserving tale needed to be fleshed out. A 19th-century epic cannot be told with 21st-century pace.&quot;Four Feathers&quot; deserves at least three hours.

Of course, his buddies brand him a coward, delivering three feathers to him (The feathers are a symbol of cowardice); The fourth feather is from his fiancee (Played by Kate Hudson). Gee, thanks Honey! After learning the hard way that nobody loves a coward, he sets off to The Sudan to try to redeem himself to his former comrades, causing more harm than good, in my opinion.

602533,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JLO2,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[0, 1]","Over the past ten years or so I have seen a number of my favorite classic novels translated into movies headlined by whichever star seems to be particularly hot at the time. In 1998 Leonardo DiCaprio appeared into a lumbering and top heavy version of ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and earlier this year Alexandre Dumas' adventure novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" was brought to the screen with mived results.So, it was with a weary heart that I handed over my hard earned cash and resolved myself to spending a couple of hours watching one of my favorite novels brought to the screen once more. The movie ""The Four Feathers"" has been given the big screen treatment several times previously, most recently in a 1978 TV movie starring Beau Bridges and in a pre-Dr. Quinn role the ever popular Jane Seymour.The newest incarnation has current flavor of the month Heath (""Knights Tale"") Ledger in the Beau Bridges role and Kate (""Almost Famous"") Hudson as his faithful fianc&eacute;e Ethne.With a supporting cast that includes Wes (""American Beauty"") Bentley and Djimon (""Amistad"") Hounsou, the cast is guided by the steady hand of the acclaimed director of ""Elizabeth"" Shekhar Kapur.The story behind ""The Four Feathers"" is a well known one of betrayal, honor, passion and ultimate redemption that to briefly summarize it seems almost an injustice.Inspired by the classic novel by A.E.W. Mason the movie begins in 1875, ten year's before the fall of Khartoum. A young British officer, Harry Feversham, admired by his colleagues and devoted to his bride-to-be Ethne, Harry has a promising future in the military, but when the Sudanese rebels attack the colonial British fortress Harry becomes overwhelmed by self-doubt and uncertainty and resigns his commission.Shocked by his actions, Harry's father disowns him and his friends, and fianc&eacute;e, assuming the move is motivated by fear, each send him a white feather as a sign of cowardice.Left isolated and alone in London, Harry learns that his friends have fallen under brutal attack. Instantly, the bond he has with his friends inspires him to overcome his uncertainty and race to their rescue.The director, Kapur, states in the press packet for the movie that the movie has ""at its core"" the story of ""boys going to war and becoming men."" I think this is at the core of why this movie is not as effective as the earlier more literal versions of the epic tale.Kapur dresses up the screen with incredible shots of the vastness of the African desert and places his main characters in a number of seemingly insurmountable situations, but the movie lacks the sense of the search for redemption that drove the previous movies.Most telling of this is the omission of two key scenes from both the book and its subsequent adaptations. Firstly, the pivotal moment when Harry receives the feather from Ethne, and then excised completely is the whole subplot revolving around the betrayal felt by the delivery of a feather from Harry's best friend Jack. In its place Jack is seen in the conflicting role of initially standing beside his friend and then ultimately romancing Ethne in the latter part of the picture.I'm not sure why co-screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini felt the need to make such a dramatic departure from the original text but it's disorientating and the tight structure that made the previous movies so interesting and fast paced is noticeably lacking here.Worth of metion though is the awe inspiring photography by the noted Director of Photography Robert Richardson and the beautiful period costume design by Ruth Myers. Ledger, Bentley and Hudson also provide strong performances in the roles provided to them, but a seriously flawed script hampers their efforts to imbue any true sense of sympathy for their characters.The movie therefore comes across as looking particularly great, but as is the case with many recent Hollywood versions of classic novels its mostly style over substance. That is a shame, because it's once again a great work of literature has been transformed into at best a mediocre movie.",3,Great desert vistas fail to help an ailing epic,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,4082,"['past', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'have', 'seen', 'number', 'favorite', 'classic', 'novels', 'translated', 'movies', 'headlined', 'whichever', 'star', 'be', 'particularly', 'hot', 'time', '1998', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'appeared', 'lumbering', 'top', 'heavy', 'version', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Mask', 'earlier', 'year', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'adventure', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'mived', 'results.So', 'was', 'weary', 'heart', 'handed', 'over', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash', 'resolved', 'spending', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels', 'brought', 'screen', 'once', 'more', 'movie', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'been', 'given', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment', 'several', 'times', 'previously', 'most', 'recently', '1978', 'TV', 'movie', 'starring', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'pre-Dr.', 'Quinn', 'role', 'ever', 'popular', 'Jane', 'Seymour.The', 'newest', 'incarnation', 'current', 'flavor', 'month', 'Heath', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'Ledger', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'role', 'Kate', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Hudson', 'faithful', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ethne.With', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Wes', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Bentley', 'Djimon', 'Amistad', 'Hounsou', 'cast', 'guided', 'steady', 'hand', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Elizabeth', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur.The', 'story', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'well', 'known', 'one', 'betrayal', 'honor', 'passion', 'ultimate', 'redemption', 'briefly', 'summarize', 'almost', 'injustice.Inspired', 'classic', 'novel', 'A.E.W', 'Mason', 'movie', '1875', 'ten', 'year', 'fall', 'Khartoum', 'A', 'young', 'British', 'officer', 'Harry', 'Feversham', 'admired', 'colleagues', 'devoted', 'bride-to-be', 'Ethne', 'Harry', 'promising', 'future', 'military', 'when', 'Sudanese', 'rebels', 'attack', 'colonial', 'British', 'fortress', 'Harry', 'overwhelmed', 'self-doubt', 'uncertainty', 'resigns', 'commission.Shocked', 'actions', 'Harry', 'father', 'disowns', 'friends', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'assuming', 'move', 'motivated', 'fear', 'send', 'white', 'feather', 'sign', 'cowardice.Left', 'isolated', 'alone', 'London', 'Harry', 'friends', 'have', 'fallen', 'brutal', 'attack', 'Instantly', 'bond', 'friends', 'overcome', 'uncertainty', 'race', 'rescue.The', 'director', 'Kapur', 'press', 'packet', 'movie', 'movie', 'core', 'story', 'boys', 'going', 'war', 'becoming', 'men', 'think', 'core', 'why', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'earlier', 'more', 'literal', 'versions', 'epic', 'tale.Kapur', 'up', 'screen', 'incredible', 'shots', 'vastness', 'African', 'desert', 'main', 'characters', 'number', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'situations', 'movie', 'sense', 'search', 'redemption', 'drove', 'previous', 'movies.Most', 'telling', 'omission', 'two', 'key', 'scenes', 'book', 'subsequent', 'adaptations', 'Firstly', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'when', 'Harry', 'feather', 'Ethne', 'then', 'excised', 'completely', 'whole', 'subplot', 'revolving', 'betrayal', 'felt', 'delivery', 'feather', 'Harry', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'place', 'Jack', 'seen', 'conflicting', 'role', 'initially', 'standing', 'friend', 'then', 'ultimately', 'romancing', 'Ethne', 'latter', 'part', 'picture.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'co-screenwriters', 'Michael', 'Schiffer', 'Hossein', 'Amini', 'felt', 'need', 'make', 'such', 'dramatic', 'departure', 'original', 'text', 'disorientating', 'tight', 'structure', 'made', 'previous', 'movies', 'interesting', 'fast', 'paced', 'noticeably', 'lacking', 'here.Worth', 'metion', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'photography', 'noted', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'beautiful', 'period', 'costume', 'design', 'Ruth', 'Myers', 'Ledger', 'Bentley', 'Hudson', 'also', 'provide', 'strong', 'performances', 'roles', 'provided', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'script', 'hampers', 'efforts', 'imbue', 'true', 'sense', 'sympathy', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'therefore', 'looking', 'particularly', 'great', 'case', 'many', 'recent', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'classic', 'novels', 'mostly', 'style', 'substance', 'shame', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'work', 'literature', 'been', 'transformed', 'best', 'mediocre', 'movie']",N/A

The characters are British.  Heath Ledger is Australian; Kate Hudson & Wes Bentley are American.  I admit to being fond of Wes Bentley since American Beauty but Kate Hudson was better suited to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, in which she shone.  I can't see Heath Ledger's appeal at all.  But were there no young British actors to take the parts?  Colin Farrell, for example (and, yes, I know he's Welsh).2. The brilliant battle scenes left me wondering why the British were in the Sudan at all.  There were so many unnecessary deaths to keep control over a desert land that the natives were fighting to win back.  Perhaps these desert wars were the precursors of the present day troubles in the Middle East.  And the British did not adapt well to desert fighting.  One battle scene, however, reminded me of a similar scene in the movie Willow, as buried fighters rose up to ambush the oncoming British.3. This is the third movie I've seen recently in which I believe that the heroine chose the wrong man at the end.  Jack (Bentley) was true to his friend Harry and did not send him a feather.  He went to the Sudan, did his duty, was blinded, and, at the end, did not get Ethne, whom he loved dearly.  He was basically left with nothing but his honor. I call this the Prodigal Son's Brother effect, and I have always sympathized with the older brother, who deserved the fatted calf.  In Sweet Home Alabama and Just Married, the heroine also chooses the wrong man.

However, this is a version of the story that deserved to be made.  An epic of this magnitude is always aided by the stunning visuals of modern film-making techniques- and the cinematograpny here is amazing.The film is not perfect.  It suffers from some technical flaws, including some occassional, but rather jarring, editing holes.  However, the acting is largely superb, though I agree that it was difficult to see Kate Hudson as British, let alone upper-class.  Heath Ledger is a fine young actor and, though his accent falters a bit at times, he is more than up to the task of playing Harry Feversham.  Wes Bentley's performance was absolutely outstanding.  I never doubted the authenticity of his character (or his accent) for a second.  (Indeed, I had no idea that he was the same actor from &quot;American Beauty&quot; until I read the other reviews on this site and consequently looked it up.  Even now, I find it difficult to believe).The script is solid, if nothing terribly original, but it is based on (and tightly follows) a rather old novel.  One can find many of the cliches of the &quot;epic&quot; genre in the story and dialogue, but I entered the theater expecting them.I am a fan of epics.

602540,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JLO2,Eric,"[6, 9]","Period pieces and desert adventures have long always appealed to me. Watching intrepid explorers brave the vast, dry, and arid landscape is an exhilarating experience. So I think it says a lot that The Four Feathers did little for me, save for much yawning and a sudden desire to take a long nap. I'd actually been looking forward to seeing this film for several months so, bar none, this was probably the biggest disappointment of 2002, for me, at least.Ledger stars as Harry Faversham, a British soldier in his majesty's army in the 19th century. Jack (Wes Bentley) is his best friend, a brave soldier who envies Harry because of his lovely fiancee, Ethne (Kate Hudson). All seems well for the happy couple, until war is declared in the Sudan against the zealous Mahdi. Harry, after a long night of deep thought, elects to resign his commission and unsurprisingly, is deemed a complete coward by his own friends, who send him four feathers as a symbol of his disgrace (the fourth is sent by Ethne, Jack chooses not to believe he's a coward).Distraught over the feathers, Harry decides to tag along and help his comrades in any way he can. Naturally, he's a bit in over his head and has to be saved time and again by a desert warrior named About Fatma (Djimon Honsou), who has taken it upon himself to protect Faversham, for reasons that are never made explicitly clear. Does Harry get a chance to prove his mettle in combat? Do I even have to ask?The fundamental premise at work sounds great, but a quick glance informs us of a barrage of head-spinning plot holes. We're never really told what to think of Harry, except that he might not be the brightest guy in England. Put it this way, he actually spends an entire night chewing over his decision to resign and not for a moment did he actually seem to consider the fact that resigning right after war has been declared might, oh, deem him a coward. Should he really have been surprised by those feathers he was sent?Then there's his decision to sneak into the Sudan. In one of the movie's more jarring edits, we're never shown how he got there; he's just there in one scene. In a period piece adventure, it's my firm belief as much detail as possible should be given. Anyway, his plan makes no sense; he decides he'll try and help, but what exactly can he do that a heavily-armed and well-trained army couldn't do without him? When all is said and done, I'm not even sure what point the film's trying to make, that personal honor and reputation is more important than holding firm to your beliefs (not that the movie ever established Harry as a pacifist, otherwise I doubt he'd ever have joined the army, even with his father as an officer)?Ambiguity is evident in the Kate Hudson character, and not in an intriguing manner, either. Are we supposed to assume that she cares more about her &quot;image&quot; than Harry? Then when she displays regret over sending the feather, are we supposed to gather that she's truly changed or just in need of a suitor? On the other end of the spectrum, there's Jack, whose dedication to both Harry and Ethne is actually rather touching.And thus leads to the love triangle, which I could have done without. Actually, I'll give a spoiler warning here because I mean to reveal the ending. Ethne obviously will return to Harry, leaving poor Jack blinded and only with his honor to comfort him. If you ask me, she chose the wrong guy.The action/adventure aspects of the movie are pulled off just as poorly. What should have been a rip-roaring epic is instead very badly edited, scenes cutting from one to another without a sense of timing or pacing, almost as if though whole chunks were lifted from the film entirely. The film's big battle sequence is a clunker, with a few well-staged and well-shot moments (loved Ledger's leap onto the horse), but is mostly unexciting and frustratingly dull. The director fails to capture the odds the army was up against, gives us little of the much needed hand-to-hand combat and overdoses on the slow motion.The Four Feathers was directed by Shekhar Kapur, who has shown talent with Elizabeth, but you'd think the man who crafted this had no discernable skills. True, the movie boasts the occasional bit of lovely cinematography, but come on, we know that's due more to the stunning locations than the camerawork.

602544,A1GX4R797QZZP8,B00005JLO2,ixta_coyotl,"[2, 3]","For starters, full disclosure: I feel that Shekhar Kapur is one of the great living film directors, with a star that is still rising.  After watching Bandit Queen, for a moment I was almost led to believe that Richard Attenborough's Gandhi was trivial.  Elizabeth, despite great liberties taken with history, is the most riveting tale of the great Queen ever put to film.Regarding this story, it is based on the novel of the same name by A. E. W. Mason written in 1902.  It has been done some five times before on film, most famously in 1939.  The 1929 version, a sound-tracked silent film starring Fay Wray from King Kong, exists somewhere but unfortunately has not yet been released on VHS or DVD.The strength of Kapur's version is really the early scenes of British haute culture.  No one, except perhaps the Irish, knows the British as well as the East Indians do, and it truly shows thru the prism of Kapur's Dravidian camera as it focuses on the brutal nature of British ""civilization"".  The British are portrayed in a light of sympathy somewhere between what we would expect to feel for Roman centurions and the Nazi elite.The problem with this is precisely that Kapur does it so well, leaving you almost without sympathy for anyone involved, including Harry (Heath Ledger).  And it's hard to sit thru a film where you don't like anyone in it.  Not helping matters is the acting of the young Hollywood cast, which, although routinely adequate, is never exceptional.  Djimon Hounsou provides the standout performance here, and Ledger starts to grow on you once he loosens up in Africa.  But by this time the story has already begun to suffer from a slight case of Hollywood hokum.  There are some challenging situations and themes presented, but somehow it just doesn't feel satisfying.  And the ending was too long and too happy.My recommendation: Definitely worth checking out.  It's entertaining enough and covers some important topics which currently face us today.  You might also look up the '39 British version and the '29 Hollywood version (if you can find it!).

However, when the regiment receives word that it is to be sent to the Sudan to battle rebels, he abruptly resigns his commisson and is branded as a coward by his friends and fiance, who send him four white feathers as a sign of cowardice.Eventually Harry goes down to the Sudan to avenge these feathers or something, and the movie rapidly goes downhill.

Towards the end of the movie things get very reminiscent of Midnight Express, which isn't necceasrily a bad thing except for the fact that Turkish prison sequences seem rather out of place in a 19th Century War movie.Djimon Hounsou, who you may remember as Maximus's ally in Gladiator, has a role as a guardian angel for Harry.

Cramer ""wazuppie765""","[8, 10]","To call THE FOUR FEATHERS in line with such epics as BRAVEHEART and THE ENGLISH PATIENT (as the back cover says it is) is quite far-fetched. To call THE FOUR FEATHERS a good runner-up is much more appropriate.Let's start off with the good things first:-THE PACING is incredible. This movie sweeps you from formal England to the beautiful and deadly Sudan within a half-hour. The transition is extremely well done and really gets the story moving.-THE CINEMETOGRAPHY is marvelous. It's obviously Lawrence of Arabia inspired, but then again, what ISN'T inspired from Lawrence of Arabia?-THE ACTION is great. There are a few little gunfights, but there's a massive 13 minute battle sequence that is very well choreographed and executed. In one word: AMAZING.-THE MUSIC is wonderful. Although it starts off a bit bland, it really kicks in to the sweeping main theme once the film trasnports you to the Sudan. James Horner really did a great job.-THE ACTING is pretty good. Wes Bentley delivers a great performance, as does Heath Ledger. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Heath Ledger and Djimon Hounsou is great.-THE RATING. While not quite strong enough to be an R, it does teeter on the edge and shows you everything within the limits of PG-13. There is swordplay/stabbings, massive gun battles, whippings, beatings, killings, and more. (They are all muted, though.) To me, this helps the movie a lot by having a sense of realism but not being TOO realistic. (Like BRAVEHEART)And now, the not-so-good things:-IT SLOWS DOWN too much in the last act and the edning is very choppy. This is where the film really suffers. After escaping from prison, all of a sudden (one second later in screen time) Heath's character is back in England. Then, there is a long and tedious scene between Heath Ledger and Kate Hudson. Also, the movie ends not really telling you who gets Kate Hudson's character.-THE SCRIPT is mostly good, but bland in some spots. For example, in the scene I mentioned earlier with Kate Hudson and Heath Ledger talking at the end of the movie, the dialouge is really bland. There are other scenes, too.-IT ENDS TOO SOON. By the end, this movie has tried so hard to be an epic with its rousing score, great action, well-done drama, etc., and it leaves you at the credits after 130 minutes. Now usually, 130 minutes is fairly long, but not for a movie of this sort of scope and historical arc. It doesn't play out long enough to leave a real impression in most people.Anyway, don't get me wrong. This is a great movie.

It's not love of country or blind devotion to duty. In the end, as eloquently stated by a character who has lost his sight in battle, &quot;You fight for the man on your right. You fight for the man on your left.&quot; Above all, this film defines personal honor and the meaning of friendship in the crucible of war and survival. As a movie, it's not perfect. It drags in spots. The Director has some ambivalence about embracing British Colonialism. At times it parallels our incursion into Iraq.

Mason's classic novel of the cowardice and redemption of a British soldier in the Sudan in the 1880s has been filmed several times, the best of which is Zoltan Korda's magnificent 1939 production starring John Clements, Ralph Richardson, C. Aubrey Smith and June Duprez.  This latest version directed by Shekar Kapur (""Elizabeth"") is certainly lavish and spectacular:  Robert Richardson's awesome cinematography captures the sweeping vistas of the sandy desert of the Sahara and the green meadows of England, the dazzling interiors of the Victorian age and the claustraphobic horrors of the Omdurman prison, with Ruth Meyers' magnificent costumes as icing.But the script (by Hossein Amini and Michael Schiffer) fails to capture the spirit and verve of the Mason or Korda works.  It doesn't want to fully embrace the imperialism of the source, but can't fully condemn it either because the story hinges so strongly on this element.  As a result, there's a thread of ambiguity throughout.  The leads are unable to draw the audience fully in, though Kate Hudson looks ravishing and Wes Bentley tries hard.  The supporting players come off better:  Djimon Hounsou is magnetic as a slave that assists the hero, Michael Sheen provides much-needed comic relief, and Kris Marshall is quietly moving as a devout Christian.Kapur's direction is a bit too lethargic, with a final coda that goes on too long.  He reaches his peak midway through with a battle that is genuinely spellbinding, realizing the spectacle but in no way de-emphasizing the heartbreak and folly of the situation.For the widescreen vistas alone, it's worth seeing on the big screen, but for the whole impact of the great story, read Mason's book or watch Korda's great film.",3,"Lavish and spectacular, but not as good as the book.",1032566400,"09 21, 2002",2002,1741,"['A.E.W', 'Mason', 'classic', 'novel', 'cowardice', 'redemption', 'British', 'soldier', 'Sudan', '1880s', 'been', 'filmed', 'several', 'times', 'best', 'Zoltan', 'Korda', 'magnificent', '1939', 'production', 'starring', 'John', 'Clements', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'C.', 'Aubrey', 'Smith', 'June', 'Duprez', 'latest', 'version', 'directed', 'Shekar', 'Kapur', 'Elizabeth', 'certainly', 'lavish', 'spectacular', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'awesome', 'cinematography', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'sandy', 'desert', 'Sahara', 'green', 'meadows', 'England', 'dazzling', 'interiors', 'Victorian', 'age', 'claustraphobic', 'horrors', 'Omdurman', 'prison', 'Ruth', 'Meyers', 'magnificent', 'costumes', 'icing.But', 'script', 'Hossein', 'Amini', 'Michael', 'Schiffer', 'capture', 'spirit', 'verve', 'Mason', 'Korda', ""n't"", 'want', 'fully', 'embrace', 'imperialism', 'source', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'condemn', 'either', 'story', 'hinges', 'so', 'strongly', 'element', 'result', 'thread', 'ambiguity', 'leads', 'are', 'unable', 'draw', 'audience', 'fully', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'ravishing', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'hard', 'supporting', 'players', 'come', 'off', 'better', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'magnetic', 'slave', 'hero', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'much-needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'Kris', 'Marshall', 'quietly', 'moving', 'devout', 'Christian.Kapur', 'direction', 'bit', 'too', 'lethargic', 'final', 'coda', 'too', 'long', 'peak', 'midway', 'battle', 'genuinely', 'spellbinding', 'realizing', 'spectacle', 'way', 'de-emphasizing', 'heartbreak', 'folly', 'situation.For', 'widescreen', 'vistas', 'alone', 'worth', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'whole', 'impact', 'great', 'story', 'read', 'Mason', 'book', 'watch', 'Korda', 'great', 'film']",N/A

It's certainly not too long (it's just over 2 hours long, which is about standard for a historical drama). The acting is fine; although, the British accents of Ledger and Hudson were not that great (but, at least, they weren't annoyingly fake). The editing is fine; if you can't follow the film, then you must not be too smart. Most other criticisms, like Ebert complaining that it was too anglo-centric, are false as well.The one criticism I have is that we are supposed to sympathize with Harry (Ledger's character) when he receives the white feathers for his cowardice. Afterall, he was a coward for abandoning his fellow officers and friends on the eve of going to war, and he knew the consequences. However, the struggles that he encounters on his mission to redeem his honor will certainly illicit sympathy, so that you will too forgive him for his cowardice.All in all, this was a good film. If you enjoy historical dramas like Elizabeth and Amadeus, then I think you should purchase this DVD. The story is often compelling and the cinematography is often brilliant.

Mason published the Four Feathers, a book about a young man's disgracing himself by resigning just before his regiment is sent off to the Sudan, and then redeeming his manhood by journeying there and rescuing his three former-friends who had each given him a white feather (signifying that they thought that he was a coward). The book is a work of muscular fiction with a great deal of danger, adventure, and overcoming.In 2002, Indian director and producer Shekhar Kapur remade the story into this film. Differing is certain critical ways from the original book, and indeed from history, Mr. Kapur's movie is intended to be an anti-war movie that exposes the fallacies of imperialism and militarism.Overall, I found the movie to be visually stunning, and quite a moving piece. If you are willing to stop there, you will probably find it to be a very good movie indeed. As for me, however, I did not like the liberties that the director took with the story, subtly turning the very basics of Mr. Mason's story entirely on its head. Also, I did not like the liberties that he took with history - for example, remaking the Battle of Abu Klea into a debacle for the British Army, whereas it was in fact a victory.So, there it is.

Harry is a coward; and against his nature, he recreates himself as a hero. How does he get there? Is it rational? Or baloney? This picture makes it on it's own terms. I loved the multi-ethnic emphasis. I spent a career that depended on the help and support of people who came from different backgrounds than I did. That is how life works today. As much as I loved the Zoltan Korda version, the hero was a cipher; the culture and point of view were defined by a dominant white culture that may have been well meaning but was, in retrospect, imperialist and exploitive. I don't think I ever saw him again in a lifetime of moviegoing. Heath Ledger is a protagonist of today; insecure,inarticulate of his own personal needs, uncertain of his own motivations; believing sincerely that he has lied to himself. Terrific performance and really sorry he's gone.  The denouement that distresses some of your critics is real. The people who help us through, whatever race or background, do so because it is the right thing to do.  This aspect of the film really knocked me out. As a lifetime urban person, I cannot tell you how many times people of different races or cultural backgrounds helped me through crises, both small and big.Why do I only provide four stars for a movie I enjoyed so much?  Two reasons. First, the blindness scene: Ralph Richardson, one of the great theatre to film actors (minus Dr. Zhivago) provides the most poignant and unsettling moment in Korda's film (I've only seen this version and something bland called ""Storm Over the Nile"").  The scene where he realizes that Harry has saved him is, to me, the highlight and climax of the film. The other piece is that we do not see occurs when Harry allows himself to be branded on his forehead as a member of an outlaw tribe. The Richardson moment is one of the best in movie history when it comes to this genre of cinema. The brand is something that no one in Manhattan would endure voluntarily.  I can live without the brand, but in a movie that arouses genuine feeling and support for the hero, the absence of the blindness revelation is a gross error. I'm sorry that the Richardson (one of the best screen actors from the stage) moment could not be included. Just for the moment when he realizes he was wrong. Otherwise, this is a better, more realistic and honest version of the way the world really works.

602557,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B00005JLO2,Larry Scantlebury,"[7, 10]","Well. I don't really know where to begin. I guess it is to say that I thought this a very fine movie. Wes Bently (Durrance) is no Ralph Richardson and Heath Ledger is no Jon Clements. That seems to be the central criticism of this movie. Here's what I found to be quite enjoyable.Like Marvin Gaye's ""Heard it on the Grapevine,"" possibly the most recorded or 'covered' R&B; tune, A.E.W. Mason's book over a 100 years ago has been made into movies seven times. I can't think of another book that has had that success. Why is that?Well. Because it's a wonderful story that asks questions that remain to this day unanswerable. Without sounding sexist, as long as women dress for the hunt and struggle to maintain what both genders safely call ""allure,"" men will question each other's courage. Whether you're in the third grade or in the Third Reich or in the Army Rangers or in the United States Marine Corps, the issue is going to come up.What makes the Four Feathers a great canvas for that issue is that the British are such easy targets. Nevertheless, it could have been written in Greek History with the 300 Spartans, Roman History with Horatio at the Bridge, and on and on. It's a fascinating issue. Can we be afraid? Are we all afraid and just some of us will it away? Are there those who are unafraid?So forget the statement that poor Harry ought not feel that way. We love this story and ALL the movies made about it because, like the reference to alluring dress above, the question is timeless.The other reason I like the movie is because it clearly allows Harry (Heath Ledger) to remove himself from the Commissioning scrolls in the absence of fraud or wilful bad behavior. In the past (and I believe in the Mason work itself) the script created an environment where Faversham receives the orders for himself and his three friends (Durrance, Willoughby, Burrows) and then hides them giving him time to resign. That's a different cup of tea, if you will. Here, Ledger just resigns, and makes no secret of the reason.Additionally, I liked Kate Hudson. She always reminded me of why they should prohibit nepotism in every profession, having gotten her job seemingly only because of her parentage and step-parentage. But she does a credible job as Ethene, and actually takes the role a step further by showing remorse and an acknowledgement of her hideous mistake, no doubt being the straw that breaks the camel's back so to speak, pushing Harry into the Sudan he so wanted to escape. Good acting job, Kate.Djimon Hounsou did a wonderful job as Harry's protector once he actually makes it to the Sudan. An excellent actor who looks like the brick wall it's a good thing he wasn't around years earlier when they were casting for ""Conan,"" or there would be a different Governor of California.The tedious comparisons with the 1939 version are just that, tedious. The story in THIS version is still great. Ledger, Hudson, Bently and Hounsou do an above average job, the dialogue is excellent, and the photography is brilliant. The battle sequence of the British Square being filmed from above is the best I have ever seen. 1939 was 75 years ago. Yes, it was a brilliant film. It was still 75 years ago. Move on. 5 stars.

It is a shot from atop a mountain, looking down on a British square in the desert of the Sudan in 1898 at the Battle of Abou Clea being attacked on all four sides by an overwhelming number of Mahdi soldiers.  However, as spectacular as the shot happens to be, it puts us at great distance from the action, which is worst thing that can be said about the entire film.""The Four Feathers"" is clearly one of the classic love triangle stories of literature, with Harry Faversham (Heath Ledger), his best friend Lt. Jack Durrance (Wes Bentley), and the woman they both love, Ethne Eustace (Kate Hudson).  Harry and Jack are the major parts of a quintet of young army officers who are friends and spend their time playing solider and playing rugby.  But the Mahdi and his Mohammedean fanatics have risen in the Sudan and General Gordon is set to meet his fate at Khartoum, which means the call to duty has been sounded and, as the their commanding officer proudly tells the boys, their government has finally seen fit to send them to war.However, Harry has more than second thoughts about going off to fight for Queen and country.  His engagement to Ethne seems the obvious excuse for his decision, but he makes noises about have objections to the British colonial presence in the Sudan that seem like out of time modern motive of political correctness.  Whatever the rationale behind the decision, Harry resigns his commission.  Of his four friends three of them send white weathers as a token of their condemnation of his cowardice; the fourth feather is added by Ethne, who breaks off the engagement.  Harry's father, a British serving general, literally turns his back on the young man as well (apparently to Harry's surprise).  The quest for redemption has begun.On the one hand you have to give the film credit for not giving Harry a series of unbelievable heroic episodes in which he earns the right for his friends to reclaim their feathers.  So I find myself in the strange position of arguing that this realistic approach ironically mutes the heroism of Harry's quest too much.  The greater irony is that the most heroic figure in this film is Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou), a desert prince becomes Harry's protector because he has no choice: God put the dying Englishman in his path in the desert.  Yet even his pivotal role is kept at a distance in this film and he remains a supporting player to Harry's quest for redemption.Kapur has done British period pieces before in ""Elizabeth,"" so there are no real complaints about the look of the film (the inevitable comparisons to David Lean's classic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" are somewhat misplaced; the film is more in the tradition of ""Gunga Din"").  But the story and the performances keep the audience at a distance.  Perhaps this is because by now the story of such love triangle has been played out so much that its utter predictability has stripped away all of the emotional value.  I just know that I was stunned to discover that when we finished watching this Heath Ledger film that they wished we had watched something else instead.  But seeing as how the Harry who completes the quest for redemption does not seem that much different from the one that began the film, I have to agree they are right.",3,A quest for redemption that keeps us at a distance,1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,3428,"['most', 'memorable', 'shot', 'director', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'apt', 'metaphor', '2002', 'version', 'seventh', 'be', 'filmed', 'A.E.W', 'Mason', 'novel', 'shot', 'atop', 'mountain', 'looking', 'down', 'British', 'square', 'desert', 'Sudan', '1898', 'Battle', 'Abou', 'Clea', 'being', 'attacked', 'four', 'sides', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'Mahdi', 'soldiers', 'However', 'as', 'spectacular', 'shot', 'be', 'great', 'distance', 'action', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'entire', 'film', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'clearly', 'one', 'classic', 'love', 'triangle', 'stories', 'literature', 'Harry', 'Faversham', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'best', 'friend', 'Lt.', 'Jack', 'Durrance', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'woman', 'love', 'Ethne', 'Eustace', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Harry', 'Jack', 'are', 'major', 'parts', 'quintet', 'young', 'army', 'officers', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'spend', 'time', 'playing', 'solider', 'playing', 'rugby', 'Mahdi', 'Mohammedean', 'fanatics', 'have', 'risen', 'Sudan', 'General', 'Gordon', 'set', 'meet', 'fate', 'Khartoum', 'call', 'duty', 'been', 'sounded', 'commanding', 'officer', 'proudly', 'boys', 'government', 'finally', 'seen', 'fit', 'send', 'war.However', 'Harry', 'more', 'second', 'thoughts', 'going', 'off', 'fight', 'Queen', 'country', 'engagement', 'Ethne', 'obvious', 'excuse', 'decision', 'noises', 'have', 'objections', 'British', 'colonial', 'presence', 'Sudan', 'seem', 'time', 'modern', 'motive', 'political', 'correctness', 'rationale', 'decision', 'Harry', 'commission', 'four', 'friends', 'three', 'send', 'white', 'weathers', 'token', 'condemnation', 'cowardice', 'fourth', 'feather', 'added', 'Ethne', 'who', 'engagement', 'Harry', 'father', 'British', 'serving', 'general', 'literally', 'back', 'young', 'man', 'well', 'apparently', 'Harry', 'surprise', 'quest', 'redemption', 'begun.On', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'not', 'giving', 'Harry', 'series', 'unbelievable', 'heroic', 'episodes', 'right', 'friends', 'reclaim', 'feathers', 'find', 'strange', 'position', 'arguing', 'realistic', 'approach', 'ironically', 'heroism', 'Harry', 'quest', 'too', 'much', 'greater', 'irony', 'most', 'heroic', 'figure', 'film', 'Abou', 'Fatma', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'desert', 'prince', 'Harry', 'protector', 'choice', 'God', 'put', 'dying', 'Englishman', 'path', 'desert', 'even', 'pivotal', 'role', 'kept', 'distance', 'film', 'supporting', 'player', 'Harry', 'quest', 'redemption.Kapur', 'done', 'British', 'period', 'pieces', 'Elizabeth', 'are', 'real', 'complaints', 'look', 'film', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'David', 'Lean', 'classic', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'are', 'somewhat', 'misplaced', 'film', 'more', 'tradition', 'Gunga', 'Din', 'story', 'performances', 'keep', 'audience', 'distance', 'Perhaps', 'now', 'story', 'such', 'love', 'triangle', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'utter', 'predictability', 'stripped', 'away', 'emotional', 'value', 'just', 'know', 'was', 'stunned', 'discover', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'film', 'wished', 'had', 'watched', 'something', 'else', 'instead', 'seeing', 'how', 'Harry', 'who', 'quest', 'redemption', 'not', 'seem', 'that', 'much', 'different', 'one', 'began', 'film', 'have', 'agree', 'are', 'right']",N/A

It's set in British Empire in the late 19th century and is so full of clich&eacute;s that I sometimes wondered if this was supposed to be a comedy instead of a drama.It's never exactly explained why there is a war going on in the Sudan, but the exotic setting, as well as the ballroom scenes in Great Britain call for of huge cast of extras as backdrop for the story of a young officer, played by Heath Ledger, who resigns from his military commission right before shipping off to war.  It might be because of his love for his fianc&eacute;, played by Kate Hudson, but he certainly looks like a coward to his friends.  At this time in history, white feathers were supposed to mean ""cowardice"" and it was a grave insult to be presented with one.  In this officer's case, however, he is presented with four - one from each of his three best friends, and another one from the woman he loves.Now he has to prove himself.He somehow manages to go to the Sudan as a civilian, disguise himself as an Arab, save each of his friend's lives, and come home a hero.  Of course, he doesn't do it alone.  He makes a pal out of Djimon Housou, of Amistad fame, a strong black Muslim English-speaking native who saves the white man's life as he is dying on the desert.  The lieutenant then grows a beard and wraps his head in a turban, but even though he doesn't speak a word of Arabic, somehow manages to fit in.  Give me a break!The best part of the film is the battle sequences in which the director, Shekhar Kapur, uses the best modern technology.  The British troops are easy targets in their bright red uniforms and the audience sees great camera angles as well as many gruesome wounds.  There's also a prison scene with inhumane conditions.  The story moves fast and held my attention.  But so what?As this film was just released, its easy to think of what's going on in the world today and even though there is a bit of revisionism in that one Muslim character is a good guy, the stereotype of savage Arabs rings loud and clear.  The British take for granted that they have to wage a war for the ""glory of the empire"".  And all the characters seem out of touch with reality.

The story line itself is simple.  Heath Ledger plays Harry, a soldier who resigns his commission to avoid going to war.  Wes Bentley is Jack, his loyal best friend, secretly in love with his fiance', Ethne, played by Kate Hudson.  When his friends and fiance' question his courage, he travels alone to the battlefield to regain his honor and save his friends.But while the story is simple, the execution is monumental.  Wes Bentley captures the angst and inner turmoil of doing everything right and still having his friend have the one thing he wants: Ethne's love.  Djimon Hounsou also shines as the Sudanese nomad who finds Harry in the desert and befriends him.  Kate Hudson and Heath Ledger's acting is good but their full ranges are not utilized here.This is a really good film that is a visual jewel.  This film has been judged harshly by many, and unjustly compared to the 1939 version, in my opinion.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00079ZACMOf the 1939 version of this film, Richard T. Jameson has said ""A.E.W. Mason's novel of stiff-upper-lip honor and valor had already been filmed three times (and at least that many remakes have followed, superfluously). This is the only version that matters.""  Mr. Jameson, I beg to differ.The Shekhar Kapur version of this movie matters for several reasons.  Robert Richardson's cinematography is indeed masterful, with all the hughs and highlights of the desert shining.  He has elicited comparisons to Lawrence of Arabia for obvious reasons.  But don't forget Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Sheltering Sky.""  This camera work is really that good that it deserves to be compared to that class of film.At times the story may seem to lack flow. I believe this was intentionally directed into the film by Shekhar Kapur.  The slow uncertainty of the story acts to highlight Harry's indecision.  Kate Hudson slowly realizes she is wrong, then slowly accepts her blessings upon his return.  Harry slowly realizes his mistake and eventually goes to Sudan.  Even Harry's movement across the desert is slow.  While he quickly makes up his mind, the pace of the movie outlines the slow arduous task Harry faces in rebuilding the pieces of his life.

602567,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JLO2,Martin Asiner,"[1, 1]","Usually, whenever Hollywood shoots a remake of a previous film, the producers hope that the newer version will not be simply an update with some technological advances thrown in. They are likely to suggest that their remake emphasizes certain themes that were lacking in the original. The enduring success of the 1939 version of THE FOUR FEATHERS was clearly to be seen as an ideal melding of character and spectacle. Some forty years later, a new generation of producers updated the A. E. W. Mason story into a mess that was neither character nor spectacle. Then twenty five years after that, the newest generation of producers believed that they learned enough about the second version's debacle to enhance the lasting appeal of the original. Sadly, what director Shekhar Kapur has managed to accomplish is to emphasize the spectacle at the cost of the characterization.What made the first version resonate in the minds of the audience was the credible metamorphosis of Harry Faversham from a mindset of self-inflicted cowardice to a continent spanning set of acts of self-sacrifice that nearly everyone--except oddly enough for Harry himself--saw as incredible heroic. Heath Ledger, as Harry, sleepwalks through a role that demands that he show far more inner turmoil than he does. One minute he is quite sure that as a newly minted lieutenant in the British Army he has no desire to serve. To Harry's credit, he justifies his refusal on the grounds that as the son of a former officer, he was expected to serve even if he had serious reservations. But if his moral qualms were strong enough to risk the censure of family, peers, and fiance, then he ought not have been so quick to shift gears and head for the Sudan where his regiment was beseiged by armies of the Mahdi, a radical Muslim fundamentalist who has sworn to rid his country of what he sees as the morally debilitating influence of Western ideology. It is not unlikely that with the recent ratchiting up of tension between a more modern version of radical Muslim ideology and a Western culture that rings as debilitating to extremists now as then that the producers would emphasize that aspect of the film. The problem with that is that in so doing, the film leaves the realm of entertainment to that of the filmed polemic. There is a scene midway through that updates the role of the suicide bomber. Just before Harry's regiment is attacked by the main body of the Mahdi's forces, a small detachment of Sudanese attack the British on horseback, even though they know that to do so is suicide. They are shot out of their saddles by accurate British rifle fire, much to the consternation of the ones shooting. It is impossible to view this scene as anything other than as a thinly veiled reference to the current crop of suicide bombers willing to die merely to kill the enemy. As Harry is watching this battle, he sets a tone for himself that he follows for the remainder of the film. He watches far more than he participates. In the first film with John Clements as Harry, Clements played Harry as one who does far more than he watches. That Harry took charge. Ledger's Harry had only a few scenes of face to face confrontation with the Mahdi's soldiers, and even then his actions are invariably accompanied by excessive histrionics. Of far more interest is his friend Jack, who defends Harry from the accusations of cowardice by their peers, but then has the great bad luck to fall in love with Ethne (Kate Hudson), who promptly dumps Harry as soon as she learns of his decision to resign his commission.The major problem of this latest version of a man who is given four feathers as a symbol of his cowardice is that he does not really do enough to warrant being the focus of interest. One gets the feeling that Jack and the survivors of the British Army could have been served equally well by a local Sudanese (Dijmon Hounsou) who is one of the few characters whose credibility is established early on and runs true to form until the closing credits. The ending is no surprise to those who have seen the earlier version. What may be of surprise is that those same viewers can rightfully conclude that as a film that was supposed to combine action with strong character, THE FOUR FEATHERS is as morally deficient as those white feathers that floated so symbolically and obtrusively throughout.",3,The Four Feathers: Why This Remake?,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,4362,"['Usually', 'whenever', 'Hollywood', 'shoots', 'remake', 'previous', 'film', 'producers', 'hope', 'newer', 'version', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'simply', 'update', 'technological', 'advances', 'thrown', 'are', 'likely', 'suggest', 'remake', 'certain', 'themes', 'were', 'lacking', 'original', 'enduring', 'success', '1939', 'version', 'THE', 'FOUR', 'FEATHERS', 'was', 'clearly', 'be', 'seen', 'ideal', 'melding', 'character', 'spectacle', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'new', 'generation', 'producers', 'updated', 'A.', 'E.', 'W.', 'Mason', 'story', 'mess', 'was', 'character', 'spectacle', 'Then', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'newest', 'generation', 'producers', 'believed', 'learned', 'enough', 'second', 'version', 'debacle', 'enhance', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'original', 'Sadly', 'what', 'director', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'managed', 'accomplish', 'emphasize', 'spectacle', 'cost', 'characterization.What', 'made', 'first', 'version', 'resonate', 'minds', 'audience', 'was', 'credible', 'metamorphosis', 'Harry', 'Faversham', 'mindset', 'self-inflicted', 'cowardice', 'continent', 'spanning', 'set', 'acts', 'self-sacrifice', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Harry', 'saw', 'incredible', 'heroic', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Harry', 'role', 'show', 'far', 'more', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'One', 'minute', 'quite', 'sure', 'newly', 'minted', 'lieutenant', 'British', 'Army', 'desire', 'serve', 'Harry', 'credit', 'refusal', 'grounds', 'son', 'former', 'officer', 'was', 'expected', 'serve', 'even', 'had', 'serious', 'reservations', 'moral', 'qualms', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'risk', 'censure', 'family', 'peers', 'fiance', 'then', 'ought', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'quick', 'shift', 'gears', 'head', 'Sudan', 'where', 'regiment', 'was', 'beseiged', 'armies', 'Mahdi', 'radical', 'Muslim', 'fundamentalist', 'who', 'sworn', 'rid', 'country', 'what', 'morally', 'debilitating', 'influence', 'Western', 'ideology', 'not', 'unlikely', 'recent', 'ratchiting', 'tension', 'more', 'modern', 'version', 'radical', 'Muslim', 'ideology', 'Western', 'culture', 'debilitating', 'extremists', 'now', 'then', 'producers', 'would', 'emphasize', 'aspect', 'film', 'problem', 'so', 'doing', 'film', 'realm', 'entertainment', 'filmed', 'polemic', 'scene', 'midway', 'role', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'Just', 'Harry', 'regiment', 'attacked', 'main', 'body', 'Mahdi', 'forces', 'small', 'detachment', 'Sudanese', 'attack', 'British', 'horseback', 'even', 'know', 'do', 'so', 'suicide', 'are', 'shot', 'saddles', 'accurate', 'British', 'rifle', 'fire', 'much', 'consternation', 'ones', 'shooting', 'impossible', 'view', 'scene', 'anything', 'other', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'reference', 'current', 'crop', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'willing', 'die', 'merely', 'kill', 'enemy', 'Harry', 'watching', 'battle', 'tone', 'remainder', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'first', 'film', 'John', 'Clements', 'Harry', 'Clements', 'played', 'Harry', 'one', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'Harry', 'took', 'charge', 'Ledger', 'Harry', 'had', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'face', 'face', 'confrontation', 'Mahdi', 'soldiers', 'even', 'then', 'actions', 'are', 'invariably', 'accompanied', 'excessive', 'histrionics', 'far', 'more', 'interest', 'friend', 'Jack', 'who', 'Harry', 'accusations', 'cowardice', 'peers', 'then', 'great', 'bad', 'luck', 'fall', 'love', 'Ethne', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'promptly', 'Harry', 'as', 'soon', 'decision', 'resign', 'commission.The', 'major', 'problem', 'latest', 'version', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'four', 'feathers', 'symbol', 'cowardice', 'not', 'really', 'do', 'enough', 'warrant', 'being', 'focus', 'interest', 'One', 'feeling', 'Jack', 'survivors', 'British', 'Army', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'equally', 'well', 'local', 'Sudanese', 'Dijmon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'credibility', 'established', 'early', 'true', 'form', 'closing', 'credits', 'ending', 'surprise', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'version', 'What', 'may', 'be', 'surprise', 'same', 'viewers', 'can', 'rightfully', 'conclude', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'combine', 'action', 'strong', 'character', 'FOUR', 'FEATHERS', 'morally', 'deficient', 'white', 'feathers', 'floated', 'so', 'symbolically', 'obtrusively']",N/A

Any excitement is neutered by needless sentimentality. The pomp and circumstance of the British Empire is wasted. Even the glorious battle scenes attempt to demonstrate, not bravery, but stupidity.The means by which the coward achieves his redemption are fairy-tale like in their absurdity. And whereas he appears manly and rugged as a desert drifter, he looks positively preppy and effeminate in his layered sweaters back in England. Kate Hudson, the object of two men's affection, is useless window dressing. Her character's fate attempts to show that remaining faithful to a wimp is always the better choice.The second part of the movie, honestly, is much better than the first. The coward ends up in a prison which is more grotesque than your worst nightmare.

602570,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLO2,Matthew Horner,"[2, 7]","""The Four Feathers"" is a gloriously photographed, well-acted historical epic. What nearly undoes it is the source material - a 1902 novel by A.E.W. Mason, which has been filmed at least four times before. There were silent versions made in 1915, 1922 and 1929, as well as a highly regarded talking version in 1939. Its story of a pacifist who is cast out of British society because he refuses to go to war is still compelling, but the idea that British colonialism and the warfare it produced was somehow noble and glorious is not.Harry Faversham [Heath Ledger] is a young member of an elite branch of the British Army. His good friends are the best and the brightest in the regiment. He is engaged to the smart, beautiful Ethne [Kate Hudson]. His life seems perfect until he and his friends learn that their regiment is to be sent to the Sudan to help quell a native rebellion. Harry suddenly realizes he doesn't want to go to war. His whole life has been dictated by his military family. He impulsively quits the army. Ethne and three of his friends send him white feathers, which are symbols of what they perceive to be his cowardice. He is filled with guilt, not because he left the army, but because he abandoned his friends. A few weeks later, he secretly journeys to the Sudan to find them. It's a dangerous trip, and by the time he reaches them, he can not bring himself to reveal himself. Instead, he disguises himself as an Arab and aids them in secret.This is obviously an expensive movie. It contains massive battles scenes and lavish sets. For the visuals alone, it is worth seeing. Ledger gives a first rate performance as Faversham, as does Wes Bentley as his best friend, Lt. Jack Durrance. The script, however, can't help but show us people in places they shouldn't be doing things they shouldn't do. [Westerners prior to WW II didn't view it this way.] We still have great empathy for Faversham as regards his feelings of loyalty to his friends, but it's hard to feel much sympathy for the friends themselves, due to their blind obedience to the dubious ideals of the British Empire.

So when this remake was announced I was eager to see it.Notwithstanding all the negative reviews, I really enjoy this movie.Why? Well here are my points:First there stands the story. Young Harry entering the military under family tradition pressure. He enjoys comradeship but he is not willing to go to war and shed blood (his or others).When his regiment goes to war he resigned his commission. He is stigmatized by his friends and fianc&eacute;e as coward and four white feathers sent to him.His engagement is broken, his father despises him. In other words his world explodes. When he most needed a kind word or a loving caress he founds rejection.It comes to my mind the scene from ""Band of Brothers"" when a private is suffering form hysterical blindness and a well meaning word from his Lieutenant works the miracle: he regain sight and courage.Harry overcomes his fears and rushes to Sudan to help his friends. From this point onwards, adventures flow unceasingly.Second the very good photography in charge of the experienced and always effective Robert Richardson, who has authored amongst other: ""Platoon"" (1986), ""The Horse Whisperer"" (1998) and after the present movie ""Kid Bill"" 1 & 2 (2003-4). All his skill is shown in the battle scenes.Third, actors & actress perform solidly: Heath Ledger as Harry Feversham, Djimon Hounsou outstanding as Abou Fatma, Kate Hudson as the fianc&eacute; and the rest of the cast in supporting roles.Lastly, director Shekar Kapur has done a correct job. Unfortunately general public was expecting more from him due to his very successful previous film ""Elizabeth"", but honestly he can't be blamed of incompetence, just of not being outstanding always.It is a very good film for action, adventure or past wars fan.

In 1880 England this is an extreme act of Cowardice and a white feather is the physical manifestation of this cowardice. He is sent four: three from his fellow soldiers and one from Ethne Eustace (Kate Hudson), his fianc&eacute;.The very weak link in this film is Harry's reason for resigning: ""I am scared,"" he says. But not too scared to take it upon himself to go to the Sudan and pose as a Muslim warrior to protect his friends; one in particular, his best friend Jack (Wes Bentley).

Being such a classic story, of love, colonialism and redemption, I found it surprising to be the first adaptation since 1939!, so with Shekar Kapur as a director, with films like Bandit Queen and Elizabeth to his credit, it must turn out to be a classic.Moreoever, epic historical films are few and far between these days, and cinema lovers can do with a bit of that once in a while.Yet I am sorely disappointed with the film.Although the direction acting and photography are good, the battle scenes in particular,there is still something missing,a major element in any genre which I personally found lacking here,connection and sympathy with the characters! There was none.I really did not care what happened to the characters,and midway through I found the troubles and suffering of the lead character played by Heath Ledger a bit annoying, instead of the supposed sympathy that I should have felt for him.While Kate Hudson is a talented actress, I think she was miscat for the role. While she did a good job and managed her role well,and did an excellent accent, there is something too 'Californian' sunny and fresh about her appearance,and definitely non Victorian.The British colonial past has been filmed many times, (my favorites still are the classic The Man Who Would Be King and Zulu) but the treatement of the subject varied greatly,from sympathetic to the objective to the politically correct,but it is up to the viewer to deduce his/her own conclusions, while it is up to the filmmakers to ensure that they will grab the viewer's attention  and entertain him/her as well (The age of the Bergmans and Tarkovskys is over, while they were excused for not aiming at entertaining the viewer, but rather challenge him/her intellectually, it is the expection and not the norm).This what I found lacking in Four Feathers.Having said that, the DVD is of very good quality and it has many extras that unfortunately I found more interesting than the film itself.",3,Not as Good As I Expected,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,2083,"['really', 'anticipated', 'watching', 'newest', 'adaptation', 'A.E.W', 'Mason', 'classic', 'story', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'several', 'reasons', 'Being', 'such', 'classic', 'story', 'love', 'colonialism', 'redemption', 'found', 'surprising', 'be', 'first', 'adaptation', '1939', 'Shekar', 'Kapur', 'director', 'films', 'Bandit', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'credit', 'must', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'classic.Moreoever', 'epic', 'historical', 'films', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'days', 'cinema', 'lovers', 'can', 'do', 'bit', 'once', 'while.Yet', 'am', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'film.Although', 'direction', 'acting', 'photography', 'are', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'particular', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'major', 'element', 'genre', 'personally', 'found', 'lacking', 'here', 'connection', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'was', 'none.I', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'midway', 'found', 'troubles', 'suffering', 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'bit', 'annoying', 'instead', 'supposed', 'sympathy', 'should', 'have', 'felt', 'him.While', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'talented', 'actress', 'think', 'was', 'miscat', 'role', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'managed', 'role', 'well', 'did', 'excellent', 'accent', 'something', 'too', ""'Californian"", 'sunny', 'fresh', 'appearance', 'definitely', 'non', 'Victorian.The', 'British', 'colonial', 'past', 'been', 'filmed', 'many', 'times', 'favorites', 'still', 'are', 'classic', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'Zulu', 'treatement', 'subject', 'varied', 'greatly', 'sympathetic', 'objective', 'politically', 'correct', 'viewer', 'deduce', 'own', 'conclusions', 'filmmakers', 'ensure', 'will', 'grab', 'viewer', 'attention', 'entertain', 'him/her', 'as', 'well', 'age', 'Bergmans', 'Tarkovskys', 'were', 'excused', 'not', 'aiming', 'entertaining', 'viewer', 'rather', 'challenge', 'him/her', 'intellectually', 'expection', 'not', 'norm', 'what', 'found', 'lacking', 'Four', 'Feathers.Having', 'said', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'many', 'extras', 'unfortunately', 'found', 'more', 'interesting', 'film']",N/A

This is a shame in one respect as Kapur dos a spectauclar job  with the battle scene.

The central character is not a coward as the reviews here imply but a self-examining person who sees the fear within himself , primarily the fear of letting down his comrades, and deserting his girlfriend. He misinterprets this as cowardice in the face of battle yet follows them into battle, not as a soldier but as an enforced laborer pulling canons up the sand.The brillant character of the huge, very black, very thoughtful Moslem 'messenger-angel' is the person who guides the main character through a series of trials to get to the point where he recognizes and conquerors the demons he is struggling with.In the end he redeems himself on all points and becomes very much like the 'messenger-angel' character in his perceptive.

What else can explain so many versions of this oft-made story.  The original A.E.W. Mason novel is a slow Victorian read, and no film has yet to do it true honor scene for scene.  This current version, while impressive visually, is spoiled by the politically correct overtones of its producer.  Should we be surprised that an East Indian director would become mired in his own confused feelings about the British empire.  The result is history re-written to make this individual feel better about himself.The numerous historical inaccuracies of this film start right off with the Royal Cumbrians.  No such regiment existed in the British army!  This is not so bad because the older 1939 version also depicted a make-believe regiment - The Royal North Surreys.  They do have a better sounding title though! If this were the only problem with the film it would be fine.  But the producer proceeds to invent a fortress of Abu Klea which the British never had and thus was never taken.  Then he further distorts matters by totally corrupting the major battle scene of the film - the battle of Abu Klea.  This battle was fought in 1885 when the British were trying to relieve General Gordon at Khartoum.  The British Camel Corps was involved, not an Anglo-Egyptian infantry force that is shown here.  Again, we could survive these  minor details.  The major fallacy here is that it is shown as a British defeat.  Which it was not.  True, the Mahdists did break the defending British square briefly, and Kipling even wrote a poem to salute that event, but the film does not show that the square was reformed and all the Dervish that managed to break inside were either killed or driven out. The Mahdist cavalry charging with red jackets is also pure fiction. The British in fact defeated the Mahdist hordes, inflicting over a thousand casualties for less than a hundred lost themselves. The British were also no longer wearing red jackets by this time as well, but we have to see those red coats in order to vilify the evil British!The battle depicted here is well done, but factually wrong and a distortion of history.  What do you expect from an Indian director who is trying to get revenge on the British empire!  The shame of movies like this is that they seduce the viewer into thinking this is all factual content.  Many films today have become not-so-subtle vehicles for revisionist history.

602584,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLO2,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","Though designed to be a sweeping romantic period piece, ""The Four Feathers"" actually has a great deal of relevance to today's world.  At a time in which tensions between the Muslim East and the Christian West are again on the rise, it is fascinating to learn that things have not changed much since 1884, the year in which this film's story is set.This is actually the sixth filming of A.E.W. Mason's novel about a young man's search for courage in the Sudanese Desert.  Harry Faversham appears to have everything going for him:  a promising military career, a beautiful fianc&eacute; and a close friendship with three fellow officers in the British Raj.  Yet, when his unit is sent word that they will soon be fighting against the Muslim forces in the Sudan, Harry undergoes a crisis of courage, resigns his post, and finds himself ostracized by the men and the woman he has come to love most.  As a symbol of his cowardice, Harry receives four feathers, three from his buddies and one from his fianc&eacute;.  Crushed by the humiliation, Harry determines to rectify the situation by heading to the Sudan on his own, disguising himself as an Arab and making his way to his regiment to fight and die alongside his companions.""The Four Feathers"" provides just about everything one could ask for from a film of this type:  glorious vistas, epic battle scenes, heightened passions, unrequited romance, heroic self-sacrifice and personal redemption.  The film doesn't try to oversimplify either the characters or the sociopolitical background of the time.  Indeed, the writers, Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini, are to be commended for making the film neither excessively xenophobic nor excessively politically correct in tone.  Though the story is viewed through the eyes of the British, they are not portrayed as unalloyed heroes.  There is a great deal of self-doubt expressed about the propriety of the English involvement in a conflict so far from home, in the entire imperialistic mentality in fact.  On the other hand, the Muslims often come across like the savage redskins in those old westerns, hostile, alien and frightening.  The filmmakers walk a fine line between parochialism and multiculturalism - and do so quite effectively most of the time.One scene in particular underlines the film's surprising contemporary significance.  The British forces have invaded a Muslim village after several of their own men have been shot.  They track down the shooter to a crowded street where he is told to surrender his weapon.  When he doesn't, Jack, one of the British officers, is forced to shoot him before his fellow villagers, whereupon the latter pick up stones and start pelting the English forces.  If the Westerners in the scene were not wearing red uniforms and carrying rifles instead of machine guns, one would almost swear that this event were taking place in today's world rather than 118 years ago.  It is to the filmmakers' credit that they are able to draw these parallels to our contemporary world in such a bold and forthright way.Technically, the film is very accomplished.  Though director Shekhar Kapur (""Elizabeth"") has staged many impressive action sequences, the best parts of the film are those that concentrate on the intimate drama occurring within the lives of the film's main characters.  For once we have a love triangle that is actually moving and convincing, and the final scenes of relinquishment and self-sacrifice are particularly well executed and touching.  As an added bonus, cinematographer Robert Richardson captures with equal skill both the majestic beauty of an arid, windswept desert and the melancholic elegance of the sodden English countryside.The performances are excellent throughout, but a few deserve special recognition:  Heath Ledger as Harry; Wes Bentley as his pal and romantic rival, Jack; Kate Hudson as Ethne, his devoted fianc&eacute;; and Djimon Hounsou as Abou Fatma, a man who feels God has assigned him the task of protecting Harry through all his many travails in this unfamiliar world.""The Four Feathers"" provides epic adventure on a scale rarely seen in movies these days.

602587,A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1,B00005JLO2,"Savant11 ""Savant11""","[1, 2]","This movie is not as bad as I was told it would be. It was certainly not as bad or as cheesy as Pearl Harbor. The romance was not as unbelievable as the Titanic. It was certainly not as boring and trite as ""The English Patient"". And it definetly is nowhere as atrocious as ""The Patriot""But the movie is not mind blowing either. It is not Braveheart,  Gladiator or Saving Private Ryan. And no the director does not recapture the same magic as he did in ""Elizabeth"".The film is about a young man by the name of Harry in 1880's England. He's an officer in the British army who gets drafted to serve in the Sudan. Realising what this entails Harry resigns his commission and leaves the army. (It turns out that Harry never wanted to be in the army in the first place. He was just there to please his father.) As a result three of Harry's friends -and his fiance Ethne each send him a white feather. Signifying cowardice.  Harry gets a change of heart, sneaks off to the Sudan and ends up assiting his friends behind the scenes.What essentially this film is about is personal redemption, the ability to right personal wrongs and the ability to overcome internal fear and do the right thing. This would have been a very good movie if the script had been re-tooled and made tighter. There are several places where the movie drags on without a point.I found that the opening scene where the young officers are playing rugby very similar to the battle which is to take place later on.  It was very interesting to see how the British army was structured and the patrician mien that sorrounded it. It gives great credence to the line used by Djimon Honsou who says ""You British walk too proudly on the earth"". Sometimes I was gritting my teeth in anger at watching the arrogance and posturing of some of the British soldiers. But then I saw it was all a set up for something down the road. It is quite interesting to watch what the British empire was like then as compared to now.From rulers of the world to...? We have definetly come a long way. I also liked the main battle scene it was very well done and a fine display of military tactics. The costumes and cinematography as well.I saw this film primarily because of Heath Ledger. I think that he is an actor with great potential (like his fellow countrymen Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe). He does a passable job in this movie and his performance in this film is far better than The Patriot or a Knights Tale. But is not the film where where he will leave his mark. Better luck next time. Everyone else is also okay. Wes Bentley was fine, I haven't seen him in anything else but I do know he is an American and played the English gentlmen very well. However I expected a bit more from Kate Hudson than just the pinning girlfriend. Djimon Honsou while lovely to look at essentially plays the noble savage. However for once it is nice to see Africans not totally treated like a bunch of sambos.This film is for people who enjoy costume dramas, the hey day of the British empire and military movies.

Heath Ledger gives a good performance as Harry while Djimon Hounsou(Gladiator) as Harry's desert guide steals the show in almost ever scene he is in.  Also giving a good performance is Wes Bentley as Harry's loyal friend, Jack.  Overall the movie is very good in portraying the time.  Mostly good performances with the background setting of the 1880's, both in England and the Sudan.  DVD is worthwhile with several featurettes, a making of documentary and widescreen presentation.

There are some spectacular scenes (the climactic battle is one of the best filmed battles ever -- perhaps not ""Zulu"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" level, but actually interesting, with some fresh vision applied to the standard old boring British square vs. the fuzzy-wuzzies.  The plot is as ridiculous as ever, and is now layered with political correctness (the recent Iraq war has influenced some of the Arab-British confrontations), but everything is much more lively than the Korda version (which lots of people think is great, and I think is dull cardboard, except for Ralph Richardson chewing up the scenery).The interesting issue in the film is Heath Ledger, now considered to be some kind of actor god. He's not very good here,  and drags the film down. He has an interesting vulnerability -- which is essential to the character -- but somehow it doesn't do much for us in this film, as opposed to elsewhere.The part of the Korda film which was always intriguing was the attack on C. Aubrey Smith and the military mind (deftly turned into comedy by Korda, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to get away with it in 1939!).

602595,A1DMC0SPWJSF7B,B00005JLO2,Travis Godbold,"[0, 1]","I was quite upset over this film, after seeing the 1939 Classic.  The newer film strays much away from the novel, unlike the previous 1939 classic, which follows closer to the plot line of the 1902 publication.  The acting in the previous was actually a lot better too. Also the movie in general, although Heath Ledger plays Haversham quite well, seemed quite bland and too Hollywood for my interests.  Heath Ledger doesn't even look like a Sudanese native, when he tries to blend in with the populace with his disguise. I thought it laughable when the Mahdi warrior allowed him entrance into their warrior clan.  I liked that in this film, unlike the previous, Haversham has a sidekick Sudanese warrior loyal to the British who helps him out in the sticky situations, but even with this additive, the movie still was too mainstream Hollywood for my interests.If you're looking for a superb film documenting the Sudanese conflict of the 1880s, you should check out the 1939 film of the same name, which even today, fills me with awe over its superb cinematic qualities.All in all, I felt this film was too mainstream for my interests.",2,"Not as good as the 1939 Classic, caters to the newer viewing crowd.",1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,1134,"['was', 'quite', 'upset', 'over', 'film', 'seeing', '1939', 'Classic', 'newer', 'film', 'strays', 'much', 'away', 'novel', 'previous', '1939', 'classic', 'closer', 'plot', 'line', '1902', 'publication', 'acting', 'previous', 'was', 'actually', 'lot', 'better', 'too', 'Also', 'movie', 'general', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Haversham', 'quite', 'well', 'seemed', 'quite', 'bland', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'interests', 'Heath', 'Ledger', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'Sudanese', 'native', 'when', 'blend', 'populace', 'disguise', 'thought', 'laughable', 'when', 'Mahdi', 'warrior', 'allowed', 'entrance', 'warrior', 'clan', 'liked', 'film', 'previous', 'Haversham', 'sidekick', 'Sudanese', 'warrior', 'loyal', 'British', 'who', 'out', 'sticky', 'situations', 'even', 'additive', 'movie', 'still', 'was', 'too', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'interests.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'superb', 'film', 'documenting', 'Sudanese', 'conflict', '1880s', 'should', 'check', 'out', '1939', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'even', 'today', 'awe', 'superb', 'cinematic', 'qualities.All', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'mainstream', 'interests']",N/A

The result is not bad, but still disappointing partly because of its comparison with Zoltan Korda's classic version.  The newer one sufferes from modern politically correct climate of film-making, giving the whole film quite unnecessary aspects.  Still, the actions are good, and its sweeping story with romance is not to be missed.The story is based on AEW Mason's 1902 book, but as you expect, changes are made.  Heath Ledger's character Harry resigns his commission just before his army is sent to the Sudan, and his friends sent him three feathers as a symbol of cowardice.  To make things more humiliating, his finacee Ethne also gives another, refusing him in the face.  So to disprove the four feathers, Harry goes to Africa alone, where the native warriors rise up against the British army there.The main plot is left intact, but here and there you see some modernized parts that attempt to side-step any pro-British empire nuance.  So, Harry should doubt his own mission because he doesn't care Her Majesty's land in Africa.  This is meddling business, for though director Kapur might resent some patriotic tones of the previous films, the original book is free from any jingolistic tone, so all he had to do was to stick to that source, and then to give us the good story about courage, friendship and romance.  I simply don't know why he has to apologize for the empire's deed now when what we need is not that apologia which only slows down the film.Another mistake is the casting of the main characters.  It is impossible for me to imagine Kate Hudson as middle-class Victorian lady no matter how she is taught by dialogue coach.  The same goes to Wes Bentley who got famous in his portrayal of youth in &quot;American Beauty.&quot;Having said that, the film's actions and photography are astonishing.  The grand scale of the Sahara is beautifully realized, and the battle scenes are as rousing as that of &quot;The Gladiator.&quot;  And Heath Ledger even shows one great stunt, jumping upon the rushing horse, which is simple breath-taking.  I hope insurance company doens't see that.The film is not a total failure, and always good to look at.  But somehow in the middle of the film we imagine something better, something wonderful is hiding and crying to be rought to the forefront.

602597,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00005JLO2,V. Marshall,"[5, 9]","Once again a really good, almost epic, film is overlooked by a great majority. This movie is well worth its weight!The story begins in 1880 England with a handful of British soldiers preparing for war in Sudan. One soldier falls in love and makes the unheard of decision to leave the army rather than face death. But the very reason the soldier quits blames him for being a coward and the relationship ends. The soldier, played respectfully well by Heath Ledger, becomes an outcast but finds his way to the Sudan in order to help his friends. Watch the movie for the complete story because it is complicated, deep and troubling. The question that comes to mind is what would you do for your friends? Just how much should a brave man sacrifice in order to be courageous and accepted in society? This movie will bring about all sorts of deep rooted questions about the rights and wrongs of war and friendships.In my opinion the best actor in this film is Djimon Hounsou who plays a desert wanderer who rescues Heath Ledger in the Sudanese desert. Hounsou believes that God has placed Ledger in his path and that he is responsible for protecting him during the rest of the film. Again the question of what qualifies as a friendship enters the mind. Is a true lasting friendship worthy of death? I believe we would all be so lucky to fall into the path of such a man as Hounsou portrays....they are few and far between.The main focus of this film is the war between the British and the Sudanese. The scenes are well directed and powerful. The fancy professional soldiers don't stay pretty for long in the brutality of the desert. It becomes apparent that as usual a big powerfully choreographed army does not have all that it takes to fight native warriors protecting their land from invasion. The British expect the nomads to fight a war exactly as they do without taking into consideration the history and behaviors ingrained within such people who fight with swords and brutality rather than pumped up ammunition. It all sounds somehow familiar! Needless to say you may begin to look at the rights and wrongs of war after watching this movie. Is it really right to take over another country without permission from the occupants?As I said many questions will arise during the viewing of this film, it is deep and moving with reflection. Interestingly enough the message contained in this film appears to be timeless as it appears humanity still insists on creating war instead of peaceful negotiations. White feathers are distributed to cowards, at least in 1880 England, but this movie might convince you who really should receive the feather, for bravery comes in many forms.",5,Heavier Than A Feather!,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,2676,"['Once', 'again', 'really', 'good', 'almost', 'epic', 'film', 'overlooked', 'great', 'majority', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'weight', 'story', '1880', 'England', 'handful', 'British', 'soldiers', 'preparing', 'war', 'Sudan', 'One', 'soldier', 'love', 'unheard', 'decision', 'leave', 'army', 'rather', 'face', 'death', 'very', 'reason', 'soldier', 'quits', 'being', 'coward', 'relationship', 'soldier', 'played', 'respectfully', 'well', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'outcast', 'way', 'Sudan', 'order', 'help', 'friends', 'Watch', 'movie', 'complete', 'story', 'complicated', 'deep', 'troubling', 'question', 'mind', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'friends', 'Just', 'how', 'much', 'should', 'brave', 'man', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'be', 'courageous', 'accepted', 'society', 'movie', 'will', 'bring', 'sorts', 'deep', 'rooted', 'questions', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'war', 'friendships.In', 'opinion', 'best', 'actor', 'film', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'desert', 'wanderer', 'who', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Sudanese', 'desert', 'Hounsou', 'God', 'placed', 'Ledger', 'path', 'responsible', 'protecting', 'rest', 'film', 'Again', 'question', 'what', 'friendship', 'mind', 'true', 'lasting', 'friendship', 'worthy', 'death', 'believe', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'so', 'lucky', 'fall', 'path', 'such', 'man', 'Hounsou', 'portrays', '.they', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'between.The', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'war', 'British', 'Sudanese', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'directed', 'powerful', 'fancy', 'professional', 'soldiers', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'pretty', 'long', 'brutality', 'desert', 'apparent', 'as', 'usual', 'big', 'powerfully', 'choreographed', 'army', 'not', 'have', 'fight', 'native', 'warriors', 'protecting', 'land', 'invasion', 'British', 'expect', 'nomads', 'fight', 'war', 'exactly', 'do', 'taking', 'consideration', 'history', 'behaviors', 'ingrained', 'such', 'people', 'who', 'fight', 'swords', 'brutality', 'rather', 'pumped', 'up', 'ammunition', 'somehow', 'familiar', 'Needless', 'say', 'may', 'begin', 'look', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'war', 'watching', 'movie', 'really', 'right', 'take', 'over', 'country', 'permission', 'occupants', 'said', 'many', 'questions', 'will', 'arise', 'viewing', 'film', 'deep', 'moving', 'reflection', 'Interestingly', 'message', 'contained', 'film', 'be', 'timeless', 'humanity', 'still', 'creating', 'war', 'instead', 'peaceful', 'negotiations', 'White', 'feathers', 'are', 'distributed', 'cowards', 'least', '1880', 'England', 'movie', 'might', 'convince', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'receive', 'feather', 'bravery', 'many', 'forms']",N/A
