She kicks a lot of butt in this movie.",5,Cyclone,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,139,"['like', 'way', 'Heather', 'Thomas', 'motorcycle', 'tough', 'woman', 'not', 'afraid', 'nothing', 'lot', 'butt', 'movie']",Cyclone

If you're looking to have the sexy Heather Thomas in full screen beautiful color and a sharp well defined picture then you will be grossly disappointed with this joke for a DVD. The movie itself is a very entertaining little flick. With plenty of great shots of Heather in the typical 80's outfits. But the overall quality of the transfer to DVD was made from and old VHS tape that someone had laying around. Complete with your typical distorted waving pattern throughout the entire movie. Usually caused by not have the proper cables connected right. The colors are muddy and the picture is soft also typical of VHS movies. Very sad since I had hoped on having Heather at her physical peak in pristine DVD form. Unfortuantely, this studio needs the money badly and is only hoping that other Heather fans will purchase this sad representation of a mastered DVD. The movie was well worth better treatment.",4,Like NightRider?

I used to watch The Fall Guy and I was surprised when I saw Heather Thomas was in this.  She plays both tough and sweet in this movie.  She also has a funny side.
