It reminds me of their Wiggly Waffle Show on Sprout.Kathleen Warren, writer for the Wiggles played Aunt Nellie who owns a very unusual farm, and Mic Conway sings about digesting your food... and of course, Tom Miglynn  and Captain Feathersword take turns singing a song about fishing for squid.My new favorite song from Let's Eat is ""Sound Your Funky Horn"".",5,IT'S A GROOVY FUNKY MOVIE,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,429,"['adore', 'songs', 'movie', 'including', 'Seven', 'Days', 'Week', 'Wiggly', 'Waffle', 'Show', 'Sprout.Kathleen', 'Warren', 'writer', 'Wiggles', 'played', 'Aunt', 'Nellie', 'who', 'very', 'unusual', 'farm', 'Mic', 'Conway', 'sings', 'digesting', 'food', 'course', 'Tom', 'Miglynn', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'take', 'turns', 'singing', 'song', 'fishing', 'squid.My', 'new', 'favorite', 'song', 'Let', 'Eat', 'Sound', 'Your', 'Funky', 'Horn']",The Wiggles: Let's Eat

The boys like it quite well!  I do agree that the tunes are catchy; Grandpa said many of them are old songs from the 40s, 50s, or 60s -- such as ""Alabama Jubilee"" and ""England Swings"". The days-of-the-week songs are cute, and there's a song about hand-washing, which I think is a good encouragement for kids.  I guess if there's one thing that bothers me a bit, it's that Anthony seems particularly ""wiggly"" on this DVD, girating his hips and shimmy-ing frequently.",3,"""Let's Eat"" is... interesting...",1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,595,"['watching', 'Let', 'Eat', 'boys', 'ages', '3', '5', 'few', 'times', 'am', 'still', 'undecided', 'like', 'dislike', 'boys', 'quite', 'well', 'do', 'agree', 'tunes', 'are', 'catchy', 'Grandpa', 'said', 'many', 'are', 'old', 'songs', '40s', '50s', '60s', 'such', 'Alabama', 'Jubilee', 'England', 'Swings', 'days-of-the-week', 'songs', 'are', 'cute', 'song', 'hand-washing', 'think', 'good', 'encouragement', 'kids', 'guess', 'one', 'thing', 'bit', 'Anthony', 'particularly', 'wiggly', 'DVD', 'girating', 'hips', 'shimmy-ing', 'frequently']",The Wiggles: Let's Eat
