662575,A3L3ZJJK5O77G4,B00005LC17,"A. Gaston ""Gadget Monkey""","[3, 3]","This set brings back the great comic genius of Benny Hill to America. Though many feminists found offense at his use of scantilly clad women, the comedy of Benny Hill has much more to it than that. Hill was a throwback to a more slapstick style of comedy made famous in the 20's and 30's cinema. His shows contained a great mix of visual comedy, verbal jokes, and lots of charming song and dance routinues. Watching the Benny Hill show is almost like a vaudeville show from the turn of the century. His comedy was definitely more than just women in their underwear.This DVD set presents six one hour episodes of his show. While there is a good mix of famous skits, this set barely scratches the surface of his 50 year comedy career. The set also seems to focus on the 80's shows and I would have liked to have also had something from the 70's in the set.However, the episodes look picture perfect and the mono sound is good and true to the original broadcasts. There is also a nice documentary about Hill that shows him in the early 90's and tells about his history. Stars like Burt Reynolds and Mickey Rooney also share their thoughts of Hill. The discs also contain a pretty nice verbal bio of Benny Hill and a still gallery from the shows.Not the ultimate set, but well worth the price. I just hope for more releases in the future.

There doesn't seem to be anybody who is neutral about the lad and his show.  Well, I'm one of his fans and this 2-disc DVD is my idea of fun.Benny's TV show is represented here in 6 programs, 3 on each of the discs, each nearly an hour long.  These programs are packed full of all the things that made The Benny Hill Show the classic comedy series: silly songs, quick joke sketches and cheeky gags, gorgeous gals in swimsuits and lingerie (aka Hills Angels), long wordless comedy routines with Benny and company, madcap chases to that geat saxophone, and the wonderfully uninhibited Benny Hill.Benny is joined here by all his usual gang: Henry McGee, Jackie Clayton, Bob Todd and the beautiful and talented Hills Angels, particualarly Sue Upton, Erica Lynley and the delightful Louise English.  Several of the programs also contain sketches featuring Benny teamed up with some adorable children.  I think Benny does some of his best work with the kids.  Look for the great sketch with Benny taking the kids along as he tries to do some fishing.If you like Benny Hill and his TV show then I know you'll like this DVD.",5,Great DVD for Benny Hill fans,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,1214,"['guess', 'could', 'divide', 'world', 'who', 'love', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'anybody', 'who', 'neutral', 'lad', 'show', 'Well', ""'m"", 'one', 'fans', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'idea', 'fun.Benny', 'TV', 'show', 'represented', 'here', '6', 'programs', '3', 'discs', 'nearly', 'hour', 'long', 'programs', 'are', 'packed', 'full', 'things', 'made', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'Show', 'classic', 'comedy', 'series', 'silly', 'songs', 'quick', 'joke', 'sketches', 'cheeky', 'gags', 'gorgeous', 'gals', 'swimsuits', 'lingerie', 'aka', 'Hills', 'Angels', 'long', 'wordless', 'comedy', 'routines', 'Benny', 'company', 'madcap', 'chases', 'geat', 'saxophone', 'wonderfully', 'uninhibited', 'Benny', 'Hill.Benny', 'joined', 'here', 'usual', 'gang', 'Henry', 'McGee', 'Jackie', 'Clayton', 'Bob', 'Todd', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Hills', 'Angels', 'particualarly', 'Sue', 'Upton', 'Erica', 'Lynley', 'delightful', 'Louise', 'English', 'Several', 'programs', 'also', 'contain', 'sketches', 'featuring', 'Benny', 'teamed', 'up', 'adorable', 'children', 'think', 'Benny', 'best', 'work', 'kids', 'Look', 'great', 'sketch', 'Benny', 'taking', 'kids', 'along', 'do', 'fishing.If', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'TV', 'show', 'then', 'know', ""'ll"", 'like', 'DVD']",N/A
