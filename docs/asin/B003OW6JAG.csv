1356303,A3J3NGEIHCAT4E,B003OW6JAG,Joseph Arnold,"[5, 6]","I'm finally getting around to doing the review for this item. This was a season I watched on TV while it was in syndication and I did enjoy it back then. I was happy when this series came out on DVD and I plan on getting each season. I am now finished with Season 3. I did enjoy this season. I'm certain it is widely known about the bad packaging which is why I'm giving four stars. The episodes do rate five stars and I enjoyed watching them again.All the episodes are good but space will not allow me to describe each episode. Here are some that stand out:* Streams of Consciousness: The human race is connected to an entity called The Stream-the Internet on steroids. This is done by a neural implant that allows a direct connection to all human knowledge. This has made all reading material obsolete. One young man cannot access The Stream due to a brain injury and is looked down by others. But as with all machines things go wrong. The Stream attempts to obtain all bits of information no matter how useless.This could destroy the human race. It is this young man who not connected to The Stream that saves mankind.* Dark Rain: A chemical war leaves humanity unable to produce children. Only rare couples can have normal, healthy children. One such couple does conceive and this gets intense attention from the government. The couple is taken to a government hospital to see the pregnancy through. The woman gives birth to a healthy baby. In typical government fashion the couple is lied to by the government official in charge. The couple is assisted by a group working against the government (I love it when common people pull one on over the government) and the couple is taken to an isolated area where it is revealed healthy children are being born.* Feasibility Study: A group of humans are abducted by aliens to determine if the human race is suitable to serve as slaves. One in the group contracts a disease from another alien race and the disease is spread by contact with the infected individual. When the abducted group catches on to whats happening and why, they sacrifice themselves to keep mankind from being enslaved. They do this by allowing the disease that infected the one to infect themselves.* A Special Edition: Best episode of Season 3. A reporter finds that the government and defense contractors have been secretly cloning humans. Anyone can be cloned. The reporter attempts to report this but in the end is overcome by government forces. This episode flashbacks to previous episodes and to one episode not yet broadcasted.Those are the good ones. Again I want to say that Amazon did its usual good job in getting the item to me in a timely manner. In spite of the bad packaging the discs did play with no problems and the picture was of good quality. I used the fee free Super Saver shipping and it arrive in a little over a week. again good job and thanks.",4,"Great Series, Good Episodes, Lousy Packaging",1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,2889,"[""'m"", 'finally', 'getting', 'around', 'doing', 'review', 'item', 'was', 'season', 'watched', 'TV', 'was', 'syndication', 'did', 'enjoy', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'happy', 'when', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'plan', 'getting', 'season', 'am', 'now', 'finished', 'Season', '3', 'did', 'enjoy', 'season', ""'m"", 'certain', 'widely', 'known', 'bad', 'packaging', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'episodes', 'do', 'rate', 'five', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'space', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'describe', 'episode', 'Here', 'are', 'stand', 'out', '*', 'Streams', 'Consciousness', 'human', 'race', 'connected', 'entity', 'called', 'Stream-the', 'Internet', 'steroids', 'done', 'neural', 'implant', 'direct', 'connection', 'human', 'knowledge', 'made', 'reading', 'material', 'obsolete', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'access', 'Stream', 'due', 'brain', 'injury', 'looked', 'down', 'others', 'machines', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Stream', 'attempts', 'obtain', 'bits', 'information', 'matter', 'how', 'useless.This', 'could', 'destroy', 'human', 'race', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'connected', 'Stream', 'mankind', '*', 'Dark', 'Rain', 'chemical', 'war', 'humanity', 'unable', 'produce', 'children', 'Only', 'rare', 'couples', 'can', 'have', 'normal', 'healthy', 'children', 'One', 'such', 'couple', 'conceive', 'intense', 'attention', 'government', 'couple', 'taken', 'government', 'hospital', 'see', 'pregnancy', 'woman', 'birth', 'healthy', 'baby', 'typical', 'government', 'fashion', 'couple', 'lied', 'government', 'official', 'charge', 'couple', 'assisted', 'group', 'working', 'government', 'love', 'when', 'common', 'people', 'pull', 'one', 'government', 'couple', 'taken', 'isolated', 'area', 'where', 'revealed', 'healthy', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'born', '*', 'Feasibility', 'Study', 'group', 'humans', 'are', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'determine', 'human', 'race', 'suitable', 'serve', 'slaves', 'One', 'group', 'contracts', 'disease', 'alien', 'race', 'disease', 'spread', 'contact', 'infected', 'individual', 'When', 'abducted', 'group', 'catches', 'whats', 'happening', 'why', 'sacrifice', 'keep', 'mankind', 'being', 'enslaved', 'do', 'allowing', 'disease', 'infected', 'one', 'infect', '*', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Best', 'episode', 'Season', '3', 'reporter', 'government', 'defense', 'contractors', 'have', 'been', 'secretly', 'cloning', 'humans', 'Anyone', 'can', 'be', 'cloned', 'reporter', 'attempts', 'report', 'end', 'overcome', 'government', 'forces', 'episode', 'previous', 'episodes', 'one', 'episode', 'not', 'yet', 'broadcasted.Those', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'Again', 'want', 'say', 'Amazon', 'did', 'usual', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'item', 'timely', 'manner', 'spite', 'bad', 'packaging', 'discs', 'did', 'play', 'problems', 'picture', 'was', 'good', 'quality', 'used', 'fee', 'free', 'Super', 'Saver', 'shipping', 'arrive', 'little', 'week', 'again', 'good', 'job', 'thanks']",N/A

Personally I do not care of the editing of the profanity or nudity. To me it's a plus. I guess I am more conservative than most. In my opinion they should have removed more. There is still nudity. I still cannot watch it with my kids because I do not like fast forwarding there the questionable material.Again what is with the boxes? What rocket scientist developed impact plastic? It's brittle and breaks at the slightest touch. I guess that's why it's called ""Impact Plastic"" can't take a impact. I have gone through this so many times I have a eBay dealer who sells slim 6 pack DVD cases. I scan the art, put it into a label program and there you go. Fits right into the slip case. I print the episode description off the net and it ends up being a better product. Still we buyer should not have to do this. I paid for these once then I have to buy the boxes and repackage them I have never seen a worse presentation. Are black plastic case that expensive? I pay $1.00 each. Naturally you then have to buy the packing program, and the paper. Sometimes memorex includes a link to down the software for free. So it get 3 stars. I have seen worse packaging but that's on a China website. When you pay $75.00 for all 7 seasons that what I expect. But the discs are complete, as in the missing program sections some are looking for.

The DVDs are packed on 2 sides of a DVD sleeve and each DVD is supposed to fit into these 2 tiny little bottom clasps that are supposed to hold them in place - each side holding 2 - 3 DVDs.  Well, yeah, they don't hold crap.  I got Season 2 and couldn't understand the complaints because it came just like every other TV series packaging.  Now I see.I still hold to my review of Season 2 and am grateful to have these seasons available, even with horrific packaging.  I don't understand why the U.S. continues to undervalue this show, and others, and forces us to spend our hard earned dollars in other Countries just to get the shows we love and enjoyed on our TV stations.The show = 5 stars; the packaging = 1 star; the fact it is not available in the U.S. unless purchased through Canada = 0 stars.",3,Finally agree on the horrible packaging - the series remains 5 stars,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,918,"['could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'complaints', 'Canadian', 'packaging', 'loose', 'DVDs', 'etc', 'got', 'season', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packed', '2', 'sides', 'DVD', 'sleeve', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'fit', '2', 'tiny', 'little', 'bottom', 'clasps', 'are', 'supposed', 'hold', 'place', 'side', 'holding', '2', '3', 'DVDs', 'Well', 'yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'crap', 'got', 'Season', '2', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'complaints', 'came', 'just', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'packaging', 'Now', 'see.I', 'still', 'hold', 'review', 'Season', '2', 'am', 'grateful', 'have', 'seasons', 'available', 'even', 'horrific', 'packaging', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'U.S.', 'undervalue', 'show', 'others', 'forces', 'spend', 'hard', 'earned', 'dollars', 'other', 'Countries', 'just', 'get', 'shows', 'love', 'enjoyed', 'TV', 'stations.The', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'packaging', '1', 'star', 'fact', 'not', 'available', 'U.S.', 'purchased', 'Canada', '=', '0', 'stars']",N/A
1356306,A1AALI18Z1WW0F,B003OW6JAG,"Retired ""dmk42""","[16, 18]","I agree with other reviewers of these Complete Season Outer Limits box sets that this has to be the worst designed packaging I have ever seen for holding DVDs. I rate the episodes 4-stars. I would have rated the episodes 5-stars - except Canadian Home Video censored them to remove the occasional female bare breast that was shown in the MGM releases. Actually, the boxes all these Canadian Home Video DVDs came in rates 0-stars, so I am giving this product an overall rating of 3-stars.The Complete 2nd Season of Outer Limits put out by Canadian Home Video is uncensored, but seasons 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 put out by Canadian Home Video were all censored to remove rough language & every brief trace of nudity. Anyone who wants to see at least some of the uncensored episodes in these seasons must buy the various ""theme"" collections put out by MGM. All of the MGM ""theme"" releases are uncensored. I purchased the MGM Complete 1st Season, & it is also uncensored.Now more on the awful Canadian boxes. To keep from scratching the Outer Limits DVDs trying to remove them from their boxes, or while putting them back in, I found the best way is to put all the DVDs into an empty ""spindle"" box that had originally held blank CDs or DVDs.I bought all 6 of the Canadian Home Video sets (Seasons two thru seven), dumped the boxes, & put all the Outer Limits DVDs (in order) into an empty spindle box that I had originally bought from Staples & that had held 40 blank DVD+RW discs. Now I can easily lift out any year & episode I want to watch, without having to fight the stupid little plastic clips holding each DVD in its Canadian box. The season number, disk number, & episode name are clearly shown on top of each DVD, so it is easy to find the one I want.
