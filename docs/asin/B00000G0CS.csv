Other stupid side stuff: the  inclusion of Clint's ex partner, their daughter, and his current wife in  cameo roles and some haggling-for-money-sexual harrassment scenes by a  homeless man intended to be humorous but which were just annoying and  dragged the movie out still further.

""Daniel""","[20, 22]","At least two scenes of TRUE CRIME should stay in my memory for a very long time : the visit at the zoo with Clint Eastwood shouting &quot;Speed Zoo&quot; and &quot;We're going fast&quot; while pushing his daughter on  wheels and the scene involving Clint and James Woods for a conversation  about women, ethics and capital punishment : two great actors for a moment  of pure pleasure.At first, TRUE CRIME could be considered as another  movie about capital punishment. Well filmed, with a good rythm and  convincing actors, this movie is the perfect movie to rent. But take a  second look at TRUE CRIME and you won't be disappointed. This movie can be  seen one, two or three times, it will still unveil a lot of goodies. One  can admire how Clint Eastwood compares with subtlety the destiny of Steve  Everett and Frank Beechum by using descriptions of similar situations : for  example, the two little girls harassing their fathers with multiple demands  at a crucial moment. Let's also observe how Clint uses a clever editing to  pass from Beechum's cell to Clint's scenes : cigarettes, paintings (the  green pastures) for instance are themes that bind the two destinies.I  strongly recommend this film which is another masterpiece in the  exceptional directorial career of Clint Eastwood.

This time he has entered a new one, films about the death penalty. Eastwood plays a barely-sober hack  newspaper reporter. His character is very enigmatic, although I think that  was much more to do with Clint than with the story. He is walking a fine  line between being a brilliant asset to the paper and being fired. You see,  he has a tendancy to go on crusades, and he is about to embark on a fresh  one with his current writing assignment. His job is to write a &quot;human  interest sidebar&quot; about the execution of an accused murderer. The  problem is, Clint thinks he's innocent. Is Clint stupid for going off half  cocked? Is he just being reckless with his career, or is he brave in  standing up for what he beleives is right? These are the questions the film  asks us to contemplate as Eastwood gets clues and revelations about the  case. I like to see Eastwood in this type of role, which is quite similar  to that burgler one a few years ago. A low key guy struggling with his role  in life. Quiet and subdued, he constantly wonders about what is the right  thing to do. I was never a fan of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, or those Sergio  Leone films. We see a rare raw side of Clint Eastwood the man here, instead  of Clint Eastwood the cardboard cutout.

Primarily a showcase for Clint Eastwood, the film has a hypnotic power that sees us through some rocky shoals.  Mostly, the director has a problem with his star actor--he's too old to play the part, and at first it's disconcerting to see him canoodling in a quiet Oakland bar with a fellow reporter Mary McCormick.  The film says she's 23 (though I must say she looks older), but he must be 70 and we start doing all kinds of subtraction in our head.  At heart the movie is a study of a man falling apart, losing everything the good old fashioned Richard Yates way, and the conceit of the movie is that it all takes place within that Aristotelian framework of 24 hours (plus a little epilogue that must take place several months after the main course of the plot, for it's Christmastime, and Clint is Santa).Oakland never looked so good or so bad, and I doubt that Eastwood ever assembled a better cast of actors all the way around.  Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton are both magical in parts that fall outside their usual acting range--here they're Christians struggling through his final hours on Death Row, with Michael McKean as an officious chaplain.  In the outside world Clint is cheating, smoking up a storm, cuckolding his boss, fooling women who see through him.  Chief among them is Diane Venora as his long -suffering wife.  Once again Venora proves that she has the dark acting chops that should have landed her starring parts in every Cassavetes movie ever made: she actually looks as if her suffering is not going to be wiped off when the camera's aren't rolling. I think she must still be crying somewhere, helplessly, over Clint's roving eye.

501006,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00000G0CS,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 5]","I like Clint Eastwood, and wanted to see this video even though the reviews had been lukewarm at best.  However, I found myself relaxing and getting into the story although the suspense was non-existent, the story full of cliches, and the casting weak.  Eastwood plays a reporter who saves a black inmate (Isiah Washington) from death row.  From the beginning the inmate is portrayed in a sympathetic fashion, as is his wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and young daughter visit him on the day of the execution.  There are a lot of interesting details about how an execution is carried out and the warden as well as the prison guards are portrayed as real human beings with internal conflicts of their own.Eastwood was born in 1930, but this role as a womanizing reporter who beds young women should have been played by a younger man.  James Woods is the newspaper editor and the two of them exchange bawdy one-liners that seem more suited to adolescents than to grown men.  There are a few scenes where Eastwood takes his young daughter to the zoo.  She's about 5 years old, and I remember thinking that he is much to old to play the father.  However, I later found out that the little girl cast in the role actually is his real-life daughter.  But real life does not equal a good movie.In spite of these many faults I liked the movie.  Why?  Maybe because I always yearned to be a journalist myself.  Maybe because I like Eastwood's strong presence, although I do not now nor did I ever find him sexy.  Maybe, because in spite of the lack of suspense, I found the tempo and cadence of the film relaxing.  There are a lot of reasons to watch a video.

501008,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00000G0CS,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","Clint Eastwood has been a star for thirty-five years. He is also a good composer and a respected director. In 1993, he won the Oscar for Best Director for Unforgiven, which also won Best Picture. Now nearly seventy, his movies since then have reflected a more reflective, but still sure, pacing and tone. True Crime, then, is not the action-adventure picture it was merchandised as.Eastwood plays Steve Everett, a hard-living, womanizing reporter. He used to have a great career in New York City, but he blew it. Now he works for The Oakland Tribune in California, where his job, like the rest of his life, is perilously close to coming apart. Steve is a brilliant and complex character, and Eastwood gives a fine performance. Steve is a sort of Everyman of modern American society. He has lived his life without much continuity, and his relationships have been the shallow sort typical of our times. Now his one gift, which he calls following his hunches, is beginning to fail him. His lifestyle leaves him with no one to save him.One day another reporter is in an auto accident, and Steve is assigned to take over the story of an execution, which is to take place that night. The editor wants an interview with the condemned man for a human interest story. Steve, though, is of the old school and is always looking for a news story. After some research, his hunch is that his subject is probably innocent of the crime. Of course, there is little time for Steve to prove his theory, and this is what gives True Crimes its tension.The condemned is Frank Beecham [Isiah Washington], who has always claimed he did not kill a college coed over a $96 debt six years before. Almost half the movie takes place inside the prison, where we see Frank's grim last hours, which include a heart-wrenching visit from his wife and young daughter. There is a parallel here because Steve is estranged -- or nearly so -- from his wife. They also have a young daughter. We see that both characters are basically good, but got into their present predicaments through past behavior. Just as no one believes Frank is innocent, Steve's wife and coworkers do not believe him when he says he can change.There are elements in True Crime which do not ring true, although they do not ruin the movie. They make it good rather than great. Eastwood's career has been primarily built on characters who are manly loners. Handsome though he is, he's rarely been believable as a romantic lead. Age has not been as kind to him as it has to Sean Connery and Harrison Ford, and the easy with which many women fall for him in the film is hard to swallow. Also, there is a wild chase scene at the end of the picture, which is at odds with the tempo of the overall effort. It's almost as if Eastwood felt obligated to revert to his former image for the sake of his fans.On the whole, True Crime is interesting and thought-provoking. With its sultry jazz score and its emphasis on characters, it makes for decent, but not riviting, entertainment.",3,Decent Clint Eastwood drama,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,3005,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'been', 'star', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'also', 'good', 'composer', 'respected', 'director', '1993', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Director', 'Unforgiven', 'also', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Now', 'nearly', 'seventy', 'movies', 'then', 'have', 'reflected', 'more', 'reflective', 'still', 'sure', 'pacing', 'tone', 'True', 'Crime', 'then', 'not', 'action-adventure', 'picture', 'was', 'merchandised', 'as.Eastwood', 'plays', 'Steve', 'Everett', 'hard-living', 'womanizing', 'reporter', 'used', 'have', 'great', 'career', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'blew', 'Now', 'Oakland', 'Tribune', 'California', 'where', 'job', 'rest', 'life', 'perilously', 'close', 'coming', 'apart', 'Steve', 'brilliant', 'complex', 'character', 'Eastwood', 'fine', 'performance', 'Steve', 'sort', 'Everyman', 'modern', 'American', 'society', 'lived', 'life', 'much', 'continuity', 'relationships', 'have', 'been', 'shallow', 'sort', 'typical', 'times', 'Now', 'one', 'gift', 'following', 'hunches', 'beginning', 'fail', 'lifestyle', 'one', 'save', 'him.One', 'day', 'reporter', 'auto', 'accident', 'Steve', 'assigned', 'take', 'over', 'story', 'execution', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'editor', 'interview', 'condemned', 'man', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'Steve', 'though', 'old', 'school', 'always', 'looking', 'news', 'story', 'research', 'hunch', 'subject', 'probably', 'innocent', 'crime', 'course', 'little', 'time', 'Steve', 'prove', 'theory', 'True', 'Crimes', 'tension.The', 'condemned', 'Frank', 'Beecham', '[', 'Isiah', 'Washington', ']', 'who', 'always', 'claimed', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'college', 'coed', '96', 'debt', 'six', 'years', 'Almost', 'movie', 'place', 'prison', 'where', 'see', 'Frank', 'grim', 'last', 'hours', 'include', 'heart-wrenching', 'visit', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'parallel', 'here', 'Steve', 'estranged', 'nearly', 'so', 'wife', 'also', 'have', 'young', 'daughter', 'see', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'good', 'got', 'present', 'predicaments', 'past', 'behavior', 'Just', 'one', 'Frank', 'innocent', 'Steve', 'wife', 'coworkers', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'when', 'can', 'change.There', 'are', 'elements', 'True', 'Crime', 'do', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'do', 'not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'make', 'good', 'rather', 'great', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'been', 'primarily', 'built', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'manly', 'loners', 'Handsome', 'rarely', 'been', 'believable', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Age', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'easy', 'many', 'women', 'fall', 'film', 'hard', 'swallow', 'Also', 'wild', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'picture', 'odds', 'tempo', 'overall', 'effort', 'almost', 'Eastwood', 'felt', 'obligated', 'revert', 'former', 'image', 'sake', 'fans.On', 'whole', 'True', 'Crime', 'interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'sultry', 'jazz', 'score', 'emphasis', 'characters', 'decent', 'not', 'riviting', 'entertainment']",True Crime VHS

But, aside from that TRUE CRIME is an astounding work for the director Eastwood.  The real stars of the picture, however, are Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton.  As the doomed but innocent Frank Beecham, Washington controls his performance, making him both heartbreakingly real.  No overacting here.  He uses his face, his body, his voice to convey the hopelessness and fear of his impending execution for a crime he did commit.  Hamilton as his wife, Bonnie, has a very demanding role, and her grip on this character is unbelievably subtle and intense.  Some real tear-jerking scenes in this one.  Hard to believe Washington and Hamilton were overlooked at Oscar time.  Denis Leary is exceptionally good as Eastwood's boss who finds out his wife is sleeping with Eastwood.  Leary could have taken this over the top, but he again controls the anguish, jealousy (both professionally and personally), and doesn't resort to familiar tactics.  Bernard Hill as the warden, Michael Jeter as a key witness, and Michael McKean as a really scuzzy minister also do well.Also, the lovely song voiced by Diana Krall, should have made it to the Oscar nominations too!

Clint Eastwood goes above and beyond when his journalist character is assigned to simply interview a Death Row inmate, played by Isaiah Washington.  Initially driven by simple curiosity, he goes to the scene of the crime to get some background information.  It is then that he finds genuine inconsistencies in what happened a few years back.  With less than a day to prove that an innocent man is about to be executed, he gives it his all to find what he needs to save the man's life.  Some might say that it's rather far-fetched as to how the reporter determined the condemned man might be innocent...really, no one previously considered things like the store's layout being different then described?  I would agree were it not for the 140+ real-life individuals who were sent to Death Row and later exonerated.  Unfortunately, I buy the circumstances in this film and they were pretty interesting circumstances.  While this film may not be able to hold up in comparison to films like Dead Man Walking or The Green Mile, it's still a film worth watching.  Clint Eastwood is lively throughout as the alcoholic reporter trying to do the right thing.  I did think that Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton, who played the condemned man's wife, were a bit bland.  It's possible that the weight of the situation overcame them, but shouldn't there be some emotion throughout this grim process?  And did they have to kill Mary McCormack's character off so quickly?  Yes, it's what happened in the book, but its Mary McCormack...give her just a few more lines.  This is a fine film to watch, especially if you liked the book it was based on.

501019,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00000G0CS,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","When a jaded reporter gets an eleventh hour assignment to witness an  execution at San Quentin, it turns into a personal quest for justice as he  spends the last hours of the convicted man's life in a last-ditch effort to  get to the truth of the case.  ""True Crime,"" directed by and starring Clint  Eastwood, is a taut thriller that goes to the wire as Steve Everett  (Eastwood), a journalist and recovering alcoholic, tries to find out what  really happened that fateful day when Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington)  entered a convenience store to buy a bottle of steak sauce and wound up  being convicted of murdering the store clerk.  It's not a campaign born  entirely of compassion, however; Everett has had a checkered career that  has taken him to the top of his profession, only to have his own errors of  judgment (attributed to the bottle) precipitate a swift decline that has  ensconced him in a job at a large paper in the Bay area of Northern  California writing personality pieces and sidebar profiles.  He's not a man  of tremendously high ideals or great conviction, and his moral character is  somewhat ambiguous, but he demands one thing from himself and everyone else  when it comes to reporting a story:  The truth.  In that he is adamant, and  he pursues it without compromise using the one tool in his personal arsenal  that has never (when he is sober) failed him, his ""nose"" for news, that  innate sense that unfailingly leads him to that which he is seeking.  In  the case of Frank Beachum, Everett's nose tells him he is innocent; but  he's only got a few hours to prove it.  And it's been awhile since his  ""nose"" has been put to the test; the last time turned into a debacle that  cost him his reputation.  This time, not only his job,  but a man's life is  on the line.  And the clock is ticking.  Behind the camera, Eastwood is  a master storyteller; he exacts winning performances from his actors,  delivers his movies with a deliberate pace and cadence, and knows how to  keep the tension on the edge right up to the very end.  And this film is no  exception.  As an actor, he's reached a maturity that lends itself  perfectly to characters like Everett, imbuing him with a  been-there-done-that countenance, from the expressive lines in his face to  the way he carries himself physically, that not only makes him an  interesting (if not entirely sympathetic ) character, but adds nuance and  credibility to his overall performance.  Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton  (Bonnie Beachum) also give excellent, emotionally stirring performances  that anchor this story of a desperate family that finds an unlikely  champion in Everett, in whom their only hope for justice and survival lies.  In a terrific supporting role, James Woods plays Alan Mann, the editor for  whom Everett works; it's a dynamic performance that produces some great and  memorable scenes between his character and Eastwood.  Denis Leary is also  outstanding as Bob Findley, Everett's boss, and he turns in a subtle,  understated performance that works as a perfect counterpoint to the  characters of Everett and Mann.  Things really ignite when the three of  them are in a scene together.  Also memorable in supporting roles are  Diane Venora (Barbara Everett), Bernard Hill (Warden Plunkitt), Michael  McKean (Reverend Shillerman), Michael Jeter (Dale Porterhouse) and Mary  McCormack (Michelle).  Be advised, ""True Crime"" is a movie that will put  you through your paces.  From the beginning, you realize that it's highly  unlikely that Everett will succeed; there just isn't enough time.

501021,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00000G0CS,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","True Crime(released March/99)is a film crafted by a master.Eastwood populates/bases his world(s)with characters we can identify with,true to life folks with the everyday hassles and the worries that life throws at the general masses.The central character played here by a 68 year old Eastwood,is just such a man.Eastwood is ably backed by a great supporting cast;Eastwood has had the good fortune and wherewithal to surround himself with talented folks throughout his long and distinguished career.Isaiah Washington is on hand as the criminal wrongfully convicted and on death row,James Wood is the head of the newspaper where he works and Denis Leary is Eastwood's immediate boss.The plot finds Eastwood as a womanizing,drinking newspaperman who has been shipped from New York to Oakland,California.Some claim he hounded the NYC mayor who got him ousted.We later learn it was his womanizing that actually did the trick,so to speak.As the film opens he sits beside a 23 year fellow reporter and makes a few propositions towards her which she nicely rejects and leaves.On the way home she is killed in a car accident at,like the Jan and Dean song,Dead Man's Curve.Eastwood however arrives to work late the next morning,after having slept with the wife of his immediate boss Leary.He is given the bad news and is told to take  her place in finishing up a story she had been given regarding a death row inmate sentenced to die that very night.Right off the bat Eastwood starts asking questions about the murder the man on death row committed,but his editors don't want a holy crusade,just an interest piece.Off he goes,but he has to take his young daughter to the zoo first.It's a whirlwind tour,literally,and Eastwood's running while his daughter is in a stroller,ends up with a spill onto the pavement.Eastwood and daughter arrive back home,but find the wife in a terrible mood after she sees what has happened.The door is slammed and Eastwood is off to interview a prime witness in the original case.The interview doesn't go as the interviewee quite expects,as Eastwood just can't get around his story.They part but things are bugging him about this case and the clock is ticking.He goes to the deceased reporters home to get info there,but little is gleaned.However he does discover there was someone else at the scene who fled,just before the one who was accused entered the scene.He tracks down that person through his grandmother,only to find he has been deceased three years.Eastwood cannot get his editors,nor the authorities to run with his suspicions.Later in the evening Eastwood sits at home with his wife,who gives him back their wedding ring,sobbing all the while.Eastwood returns to his local watering hole and while sitting there spins his wife's ring.At that moment he gets a flash that a locket the deceased person wore,a gift from her father,was not there at the crime scene.He recalls the grandmother clutching what appears to be the same locket when Eastwood last talked with her.Eastwood dashes to grandmothers house and before long both are on the road to the Governors mansion to get a stay of execution.Will they make it in time,as the first vile of solution has already entered the prisoners body and the second is starting? The scene switches to Christmas time and Eastwood is in a gift store buying some presents and chatting up the sales rep(a cameo by Lucy Liu!).Outside he stops and when he looks up there is a family of three walking away from another store.The film ends as Diana Krall's haunting song""Should I Care"" kicks in.Mr Eastwood has always been savvy when it comes to jazz,and Krall's career was just starting to break at this time when he included this video in his film.It was a great boost for her,to be sure.What a wonderfully crafted piece of film making this was.Everything from the editing to the camera work,to the writing to the acting,all falls seamlessly into focus,bit by bit.Eastwood I find can be like a chef,throwing in ingredients,pieces at a time,stirring for awhile,then throwing in some more and stirring again.This film,like many of his other top end ones,are layered;each character,with their own back story,adding to the over all texture of what we see on screen.Until in the end everything falls neatly into place,and you have partaken of something rich and full of taste.True Crime is that kind of movie and more.It is serious,has pathos,drama,then at a moments notice he throws in a bit of humour to lighten the visual load,then it is back to the core again.This hasn't anything to do with True Crime but I have followed Mr Eastwood's career since the late 60s.I had seen his work on TV and his spaghetti westerns,but Hang em High and Coogan's Bluff really caught my attention back then,as if to say""here's someone special,keep an eye on this guy"".After that I've been in his corner ever since and watching him grow as an actor and film maker year by year.I think there isn't an Eastwood film I have not seen;some I like more than others,but the ones I was never too fond of,I still could respect for the thinking behind them.He put out stuff the public loved and the critics,for the most part,reviled.He has finally gotten the respect of critics,he so deserves,but it took him years to get it.However,I don't know Mr Eastwood personally,but if he and I were sitting here yakking on about Hollywood and his career,I suspect that he might say the only respect he ever wanted was that of the publics.And That,he never lost.Thank you Mr Eastwood for your long lasting contribution to MY world of entertainment,and may there be many more!Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,the trailer and the musical video for Krall's ""Why Should I Care?"".A classy touch to a classy film.All in all a highly recommended Eastwood jaunt into the realm of the executing of inmates.Eastwood takes neither position,if there indeed is one,but instead let's you be the judge.",5,A master of his craft at
