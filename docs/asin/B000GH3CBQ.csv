It's actually a lot more than walking. It uses hand weights almost constantly and is pretty much like a standing abs workout throughout and not at all boring. The scenery is western and really not relevant. The atmosphere is friendly and Kathy is pleasant. I also added ankle weights and felt very worked out (I felt my obliques the next day and I usually work out with Cathe Friedrich or Amy Bento).

I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and felt that I had gotten a great workout when finished, without feeling exhausted.Though I agree that the way the workout is filmed (with Kathy and the other exercisers superimposed over different backgrounds and a few instances of strange flashing lights) was a little disconcerting at first, I didn't find that the style distracted from the workout, and was completely used to it by the end of the DVD.As for unusual arm movements, such as ""swatting flies,"" Kathy makes it clear that users can choose any arm movements they feel comfortable with during this part of the workout, but the point is to keep it lighthearted and fun!The ""Matrix Method"" Kathy refers to during the workout was a great way for me to visualize and understand what we were supposed to be doing.Overall, the workout is fun and invigorating, with ample opportunities to  make it harder or easier, depending on the extent to which you choose to exert yourself, by walking, ""prancing,"" or jogging though the exercises. I actually liked this workout much more than I do Kathy's ""Ultimate Sculpt"" workout, the other in her ""Matrix"" series, as it was much easier on my knees, although I will continue to do both workouts, on alternate days.",5,I LOVE this workout!,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,1494,"['almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'chose', 'do', 'so', 'anyway', 'was', 'desperately', 'trying', 'find', 'weight', 'loss', 'could', 'alternate', 'strength', 'training', 'DVDs', 'dislike', 'most', 'traditional', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'felt', 'had', 'gotten', 'great', 'workout', 'when', 'finished', 'feeling', 'exhausted.Though', 'agree', 'way', 'workout', 'filmed', 'Kathy', 'other', 'exercisers', 'superimposed', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'few', 'instances', 'strange', 'flashing', 'lights', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'style', 'distracted', 'workout', 'was', 'completely', 'used', 'end', 'DVD.As', 'unusual', 'arm', 'movements', 'such', 'swatting', 'flies', 'Kathy', 'clear', 'users', 'can', 'choose', 'arm', 'movements', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'part', 'workout', 'point', 'keep', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'Matrix', 'Method', 'Kathy', 'refers', 'workout', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'visualize', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing.Overall', 'workout', 'fun', 'invigorating', 'ample', 'opportunities', 'make', 'harder', 'easier', 'depending', 'extent', 'choose', 'exert', 'walking', 'prancing', 'jogging', 'exercises', 'actually', 'liked', 'workout', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'Kathy', 'Ultimate', 'Sculpt', 'workout', 'other', 'Matrix', 'series', 'was', 'much', 'easier', 'knees', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'workouts', 'alternate', 'days']",Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Power Walk for Weight Loss

1004065,A2U2ZPHR54XLSS,B000GH3CBQ,DJ,"[57, 57]","I really enjoyed the ""matrix"" moves in this workout - you walk moving your right leg to 12:00 and back, then 2:00 and back, then 3:00 and back, then 4:00 and back - then the same with the left leg.  This reminded me of Latin dance, especially the merengue.  She also uses weights and different arm movement to sculpt the upper body while walking.  I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone, and this was a much more energetic and fun take on the walking craze.  On the other hand, Kathy seems to be trying to capture the younger crowd as she has dumped her usual exercise partners for two guys and two gals who can't be more then 23, and has opted for some weird pulsing camera cuts.  Thankfully, this does not distract from getting an excellent walking workout.  Kathy looks GREAT for her age (she looks great, period), but gets a little befuddled during the workout, like she doesn't remember what ""time"" we are placing the foot, or if we are on the right or left - but these are just verbal errors, nothing to interfere with the workout - in fact, it's sorta nice to see her showing her age a little! :-)  She even says that if we are finished, we can ""fast forward"" - then she says, ""not fast forward, those were the old days!""  All in all, I am VERY HAPPY with this DVD, which is broken down into one 30-minute walk, one 10-minute walk, one 10-minute core area, and on stretch.

Plus, I feel like i'm ready to move on a bit. I don't like dancy-workouts. I don't want to think that hard! :) I was tired of just marching in place.The reason I bought this was the other reviews. I don't think anyone said how fun it was! Not complicated. I was sweating profusely by minute 10 but I felt energized not tired. It was a really fun workout. The stretching part at the end is wonderful! So relaxing.I really felt this workout the next morning. I've never been sore in my ribs, sides and abs from just doing my Walk at Home workouts. It's a good sore, feels like I worked out for real!I used 3lb weights for the strength training part. I'm of two minds of this - we did a lot of 'pick up your weights', 'put your weights down', 'ok, pick up your weights again'. I kind of wish we'd just do the weight section and go on but I guess it's interval training and I won't complain since I am feeling good results.The next thing that I was nervous about is my knees. I didn't want to do a bunch of squats and lunges. I just can't take it. None of that here except that moving in the clock rotations works every part of your legs, hips and buns. I felt the burn without feeling my ligaments crack and strain. So low to moderate impact. I would recommend this is you're ready to move on from Leslie but not wanting to do something like Boot Camp or The Firm.I thought at first the crew behind her was going to annoy me but they did not. They were quite fun to watch and I felt myself getting a little 'attitude' along with them. Lots of smiles and serious sweating.

And I love working on my abs while standing up rather than laying down & doing crunches. And that core training really works; you can feel your abs working as you pull & twist etc. Sometimes the arm movements they do with some of the leg movements throw me off a bit, but like Kathy says, if it doesn't feel right, then make up your own movements to do with them. Also, it's great that it breaks the workout into sections, so depending on how much time you have, you can do one of the two ten minute segments (or both), or you can just do the 30 minute segment, or you can do them altogether + the cool down (for a total of 60 minutes). Plus, there's a cute Asian guy doing the program for me to look at while I'm exercising. :)",5,Feeling Good...,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,898,"['really', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'matrix', 'aspect', 'lot', 'really', 'legs', 'directions', 'addition', 'providing', 'great', 'all-over', 'cardio', 'workout', 'love', 'working', 'abs', 'standing', 'up', 'rather', 'laying', 'down', 'doing', 'crunches', 'core', 'training', 'really', 'can', 'feel', 'abs', 'working', 'pull', 'twist', 'etc', 'arm', 'movements', 'do', 'leg', 'movements', 'throw', 'off', 'bit', 'Kathy', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'movements', 'do', 'Also', 'great', 'workout', 'sections', 'so', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'ten', 'minute', 'segments', 'can', 'just', 'do', '30', 'minute', 'segment', 'can', 'do', 'altogether', '+', 'cool', 'down', 'total', '60', 'minutes', 'cute', 'Asian', 'guy', 'doing', 'program', 'look', ""'m"", 'exercising']",Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Power Walk for Weight Loss

I just don't like the whole set up - the superimposing back and forth is a little much.  I hate the fact that you can't always see all the background walkers due to the phoney set pieces.  Kathy is also a bit annoying in this one - when she makes that yelling sound like a crazed banshee - it makes me cringe.  Kathy you look great, you're a fitness diva - why on earth did you have to make this video with these corny background changes?  And don't even get me started on the background walkers - how old are they anyway??? Do you really expect me to believe these guys actually do your workout dvd's? P.S. their form is also AWFUL.  I give this three stars because of the 10 minute fast walk and ab section at the end. Otherwise,not my favorite.",3,So So,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,882,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'Kathy', 'Project', 'DVD', 'when', 'saw', 'had', 'new', 'Matrix', 'series', 'including', 'Walking', 'DVD', 'was', 'psyched', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'whole', 'set', 'up', 'superimposing', 'back', 'forth', 'little', 'much', 'hate', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'see', 'background', 'walkers', 'due', 'phoney', 'set', 'pieces', 'Kathy', 'also', 'bit', 'annoying', 'one', 'when', 'yelling', 'sound', 'crazed', 'banshee', 'cringe', 'Kathy', 'look', 'great', ""'re"", 'fitness', 'diva', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'have', 'make', 'video', 'corny', 'background', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'background', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'anyway', 'Do', 'really', 'expect', 'believe', 'guys', 'actually', 'do', 'workout', 'dvd', 'P.S', 'form', 'also', 'AWFUL', 'give', 'three', 'stars', '10', 'minute', 'fast', 'walk', 'ab', 'section', 'end', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'favorite']",Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Power Walk for Weight Loss
