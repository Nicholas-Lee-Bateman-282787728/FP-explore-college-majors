It had one basic message: committing suicide is not the answer.Strange characters abound in this dark comedy-drama as Christian Slater passes through a small town of curious inhabitants. I liked his narration and many of the characters in here, except for a minister who tells his congregation he doesn't believe in God.  The atheists in Hollywood just never cease in their anti-God propaganda!Other than that, the rest of the film is very likable and I enjoyed the cinematography, too.

I look forward to JULIAN PO being reissued on dvd because this is a great movie and CHRISTIAN gives an outstanding lead performance.

30185,A17TPT3FWAE5T1,0780620879,"Matthew Spady ""800rsd""","[3, 4]","&quot;Interesting material for a short story, but a bit thin for a film,&quot; was my impression after first viewing. A young man stumbles into a small town, invents a story that makes him a hero, changes the course of several lives and ultimately suffers the consequences of his fabrication. Told in a series of vignettes, each focusing on one or two of the people who live in town, the story builds in layers to illustrate the complexity of the town's people's lives, all the while leaving the central character, Julian, an enigma. Even so, as the vignettes eventually make clear, no one in town will be the same having known Julian, nor will anyone forget him. It is not hard to imagine that in future, there will be an annual Julian Po Day to commemorate the time he spent there. Visually, the film is lovely although initially, it may seem down right drab. Once the viewer has the story in mind, he can begin to absorb the many details such as the remarkable harmony between the wallpaper and the young woman's dress in the &quot;dance scene&quot; and the Spartan simplicity of Julian's hotel room and bath. The delightful, upbeat music, reminiscent of a county fair band, and the carnival atmosphere that develop in town during the duration of Julian's sojourn contrast starkly with the underlying morbidity of the story. View this one at least twice before passing judgement.N.b.: Unlike the young carpenter who wandered from town to town telling parables, changing the lives of many, and suffering similar consequences, Julian does not make the mute girl speak.",4,View this one at least twice before passing judgement,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,1569,"['quot', 'Interesting', 'material', 'short', 'story', 'bit', 'thin', 'film', 'quot', 'was', 'impression', 'first', 'viewing', 'young', 'man', 'small', 'town', 'story', 'hero', 'course', 'several', 'lives', 'ultimately', 'consequences', 'fabrication', 'Told', 'series', 'vignettes', 'focusing', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'town', 'story', 'builds', 'layers', 'illustrate', 'complexity', 'town', 'people', 'lives', 'while', 'leaving', 'central', 'character', 'Julian', 'enigma', 'Even', 'so', 'vignettes', 'eventually', 'make', 'clear', 'one', 'town', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'having', 'known', 'Julian', 'will', 'anyone', 'forget', 'not', 'hard', 'imagine', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'annual', 'Julian', 'Po', 'Day', 'commemorate', 'time', 'spent', 'there', 'Visually', 'film', 'lovely', 'initially', 'may', 'seem', 'down', 'right', 'drab', 'viewer', 'story', 'mind', 'can', 'begin', 'absorb', 'many', 'details', 'such', 'remarkable', 'harmony', 'wallpaper', 'young', 'woman', 'dress', 'quot', 'dance', 'scene', 'quot', 'Spartan', 'simplicity', 'Julian', 'hotel', 'room', 'bath', 'delightful', 'upbeat', 'music', 'reminiscent', 'county', 'fair', 'band', 'carnival', 'atmosphere', 'town', 'duration', 'Julian', 'sojourn', 'contrast', 'starkly', 'underlying', 'morbidity', 'story', 'View', 'one', 'least', 'twice', 'before', 'passing', 'judgement.N.b', 'young', 'carpenter', 'who', 'wandered', 'town', 'town', 'telling', 'parables', 'changing', 'lives', 'many', 'suffering', 'similar', 'consequences', 'Julian', 'not', 'make', 'mute', 'girl', 'speak']",N/A
