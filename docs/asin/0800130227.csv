162817,A1G3TE56DN52ME,0800130227,Adam Lenhardt,"[1, 2]","The best thing I can say about this film, is that it brought back all the wonderful emotions the book stirred in me when I read it as a child. While DeVito's vision of Dahl's children's novel is more comical and colorful than the book, the central character is very much the same. Our heart goes out to Matilda. By normal standards, her homelife isn't terrible, but Matilda is far from normal... she is extrodinary. Denied proper educational guidance from her parents, Matilda sets out for the public library at age 4 and has read Moby Dick and a wide assortment of Dickens by the time she enters school. School is both more terrible and more inspiring for Matilda... her school is positively horrid but her teacher is the most kind, patient, and selfless person one could find. For the first time, Matilda is introduced to someone who fosters her brillance rather than denies her it. All the performances; particularly those by DeVito, Pearlman, and Mara Wilson as Matilda; are brilliant. Depsite the fact that this DVD has been cropped by over 43%, I highly reccomend that you give this a rental and then buy a copy of the book.

162818,A1PCQA29APBXFM,0800130227,Adorem,"[14, 17]","Mathilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is an extremely curious and intelligent young girl who is very different from her low-brow, mainstream parents (Danny DeVito and real-life wife Rhea Perlman), who quite cruelly ignore her. As she grows older, she begins to discover that she has telekinetic powers. Not until a teacher shows her kindness for the first time does she realize that she can use those powers to do something about her sufferings and help her friends as well. Villains from the awful Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), headmistress of her miserable school Crunchem Hall, to her parents and older brother begin to feel her ire. Look for Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) in a small part as an FBI agent investigating Mathilda's shady father.The mordant vision of author Roald Dahl's world probably appealed to the director of War of the Roses and Hoffa, for it permeates this witty, eccentric, dark-toned children's film for adults. Matilda (Mara Wilson), an unusually bright 8-year-old whose reading fare runs to Moby Dick and For Whom the Bell Tolls, is saddled with a pair of comically selfish and obtuse parents (Danny De Vito and Rhea Perlman) whom she has to persuade to allow her to go to school. But her principil, the child-hating Miss Trunchbull Pam Ferris, proves no more enlightened than her parents. This hilariously exaggerated, Lewis Carroll-like version of the world is probably not too far from what many children may feel on a bad day. De Vito and Perlman camp it up outrageously and Ferris gives a terrific performance as a cartoonish villain. Cinematographer Stefan Czapsky shoots from a number of strange angles, making this perhaps the first expressionist film for children.This DVD  of course has just  the  awful  fullscreen version  and, there is so much  picture information missing from  the sides. This was shot in the ratio  of 2:35 so,  we are not seeing all that  we should be.Thankfully I have the laserdisc widescreen version which I just  recently  put to DVD-R and so now I can enjoy MATILDA'S beautiful  picture quality and in its widescreen  beautiful glory!!By  the way,  the extras on  this special  edition  DVD is great, especially the  piece that Mara shot on the set of the movie. She uses a vidcam and,its just  so adorable. This is the best  part of all the extras in my  opinion.So, even tho  the DVD is in fullscreen, which  really  stinks,  the extras  are a treat  and, oh yes, on some of the extras they show the widescreen version  and, this is nuts because if they used the widescreen  to show samples of how they did the special  effects and other things, then  WHY did they  not use the widescreen  version for the DVD??",4,FANTASTIC FUN MOVIE.!

They cared only about money and pleasure. Her father was a proudly-dishonest used-car dealer, about to be busted by the FBI. She basically raised herself. When entering school, Matilda met her 2nd-grade teacher, Miss Honey, and soon showed that she was years ahead of all the other students in terms of academic skills. This teacher appreciated her talents and her increasingly-obvious magical skills, took her under her wing, and became her closest friend. Miss Honey exhibited a decidedly different vision of school teaching, and childrens' needs, than did the principal.

She is very intelligent, self-sufficient, and inquisitive.When Matilda's parents (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman) realize that she is old enough for school (sort of late) they send her to a private school run by a horribly mean woman who hates children.  This environment, coupled with her life at home with a family that barely knows she is there, causes Matilda to discover and develop telekinetic powers.  These she uses to help a friendly teacher and the rest of the students.Once again a Roald Dahl book has been made into a very good movie.  DeVito is excellent as a crooked used car salesman and Perlman is great as his wife.  Matilda is played by the same actress who was in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street.

However, let's get the reservations over before all the good stuff.Miss Trunchbull, played by Pam Ferris, is a sadist.  She is definitely mean.  At two places in the movie she throws a child out a school window (she is really, really mean).  Matilda's parents are self-absorbed and at best ignore Matilda, which occasionally borders on abuse.  The images of Matilda's school can be disturbing, especially the ""Chokie"", a small cramped dark closet with spikes in the door.  These images could be disturbing for younger children, particularly those under the age of 7 or 8.  However, you have to judge the ability of your child to understand that these images are not real.  These are the dark parts of the movie.Matilda is clearly a genius, as evidenced by her actions from a very early age.  Matilda overcomes her not very bright parents and learns how to fend for herself in the world.  In fact, after a while she treats her parents as something to be concerned about, because they clearly do not know how to take care of themselves in the world.Matilda is a positive role model throughout the movie.  She learns to read on her own, and finds the value in the library and books.  She learns that there are people who understand her (Miss Jennifer Honey, played by Embeth Davidtz) and love her for who she is.  She also learns that people who seem scary to her (Miss Trunchbull) can be scary to others.  Her desire to protect others and do what is right helps her overcome her fear of Miss Trunchbull and do what is right.Mara Wilson plays Matilda very well.  She has a lot of talent, and makes Matilda come alive.  Danny De Vito plays Matilda's father and Rhea Perlman plays Matilda's mother, and every time I see them I cringe because these two are very unlikable characters, and I like Danny particularly.  Danny also does a very good job narrating this movie, which somewhat ameliorates his turn as a semi-villain.This movie celebrates, as it does in most Roald Dahl books, the triumph of right over wrong, and perhaps good over evil.  The characters verge on being cartoonish, which is fitting for a children's movie.  Having Matilda be telekinetic adds a wonderful element of fantasy with which children will identify.  It is often a childhood fantasy to have powers or abilities to make things right, and Matilda obtains such a power and uses it for good.This movie has a darker side, but the humorous moments and the Matilda's triumph over all the odds against her make this a fun movie.  Worth watching again and again, I think this movie is well targeted to 8 to 12 year olds, but those of us adults that want to still believe that good will always triumph over bad and that good things eventually come to good people will find the message uplifting.",5,"Very good children's movie, and fun for adults too",1039824000,"12 14, 2002",2002,2818,"['Matilda', 'worth', 'watching', 'think', 'worth', 'owning', 'too', 'However', 'let', 'get', 'reservations', 'good', 'stuff.Miss', 'Trunchbull', 'played', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'sadist', 'definitely', 'mean', 'two', 'places', 'movie', 'child', 'out', 'school', 'window', 'really', 'really', 'mean', 'Matilda', 'parents', 'are', 'self-absorbed', 'best', 'ignore', 'Matilda', 'occasionally', 'borders', 'abuse', 'images', 'Matilda', 'school', 'can', 'be', 'disturbing', 'especially', 'Chokie', 'small', 'cramped', 'dark', 'closet', 'spikes', 'door', 'images', 'could', 'be', 'disturbing', 'younger', 'children', 'particularly', 'age', '7', '8', 'However', 'have', 'judge', 'ability', 'child', 'understand', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'are', 'dark', 'parts', 'movie.Matilda', 'clearly', 'genius', 'evidenced', 'actions', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'Matilda', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'parents', 'how', 'fend', 'world', 'fact', 'while', 'parents', 'something', 'be', 'concerned', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'world.Matilda', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'movie', 'read', 'own', 'value', 'library', 'books', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'understand', 'Miss', 'Jennifer', 'Honey', 'played', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'love', 'who', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'scary', 'Miss', 'Trunchbull', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'others', 'desire', 'protect', 'others', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'overcome', 'fear', 'Miss', 'Trunchbull', 'do', 'what', 'right.Mara', 'Wilson', 'Matilda', 'very', 'well', 'lot', 'talent', 'Matilda', 'come', 'alive', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'Matilda', 'father', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'Matilda', 'mother', 'time', 'see', 'cringe', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'like', 'Danny', 'particularly', 'Danny', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'narrating', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'turn', 'semi-villain.This', 'movie', 'celebrates', 'most', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'books', 'triumph', 'right', 'wrong', 'perhaps', 'good', 'evil', 'characters', 'verge', 'being', 'cartoonish', 'fitting', 'children', 'movie', 'Having', 'Matilda', 'be', 'telekinetic', 'wonderful', 'element', 'fantasy', 'children', 'will', 'identify', 'often', 'childhood', 'fantasy', 'have', 'powers', 'abilities', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'Matilda', 'obtains', 'such', 'power', 'good.This', 'movie', 'darker', 'side', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Matilda', 'triumph', 'odds', 'make', 'fun', 'movie', 'Worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'targeted', '8', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'adults', 'want', 'still', 'believe', 'good', 'will', 'always', 'triumph', 'bad', 'good', 'things', 'eventually', 'come', 'good', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'message', 'uplifting']",N/A

I grabbed it in my local supermarket for only five bucks, and have seen it since at full price! I'm so happy what a bargain.Back to the film, Danny DeVito really manages to bring Roald Dahl's brilliantly described characters to life. I was so shocked that the characters are brought to life and it's all thanks to the brilliant actors.

While I agree that the full-screen format is a little disappointing, the special features are fun and the film is the same fun and slightly dark humor that we've all come to love.Mara Wilson was a child actress who always seemed to have a special quality about her. Precocious, adorable, and wise beyond her years, she gave an ideal portrayal of the classic children's book heroine. Child stars didn't get as much long-term recognition back then, and many of them (like Wilson) ended up being able to have a normal teen and adult life thereafter, but you can bet that if Wilson was a young child in the current 2007, she'd be as much of a hot ticket as Abigail Breslin and maybe even Dakota Fanning. These days, those cute, smart, and talented little dynamos are being stretched further than ever before.Getting back to the movie, I was always a bit wary when I heard how it was being sold as ""a great story with a great message."" What's the message--that this little girl was a despised, ""disgusting little brute"" to her family and a little monster to be squashed by her school headmistress? That she was loved so little by her own parents that they signed her away to her teacher without barely a second thought? Granted, the ending was sweet in its own particular right, but it hardly sends the kind of message that parents would want to send to their child.Just the same, so long as this film is seen as a fantasy story more than a depiction of reality, I don't see any problem in showing it to younger audiences. Heck, I saw it when I was 11 years old and absolutely loved it (although some of the Trunchbull scenes were a bit over-the-top and disturbing). As I said before, Mara Wilson is a terrific little Matilda, Danny DeVito and Rhea Pearlman are hilarious as the self-absorbed parents, Embeth Davidtz delivers perfectly as the sweet and gentle Miss Honey, and Pam Ferris outdoes herself as the unforgettable ""Miss Trunchbull,"" a character that will surely go down in infamy.

Matilda is a little girl and a bonafide genius who is cursed with living with obnoxious, unloving parents who are too dense to notice her gifts, and a bratty older brother. Then the day comes when Matilda must start school. She goes to Crunchum Hall, where she makes friends and meets a nice teacher with a well-fitting name, Ms. Honey, and the evil, child-hating principal, the afore-mentioned Trunchbull. Ms. Honey soon recignizes Matilda's exceptional talents and wants her to be moved up several grades, but the Trunchbull will have none of it. (Ms. Honey tells the Trunchbull Matilda's memorized several multiplication tables, and the Trunchbull replies,""So can a parrot!"") A new hope appears, however, when Matilda finds she also has the gift of telekinesis, and hatches a plan to get the Trunchbull to leave Crunchum Hall for good...The best thing about this film is Maria Wilson's preformance as Matilda. The girl always manages to be cute and endearing without ever once becoming annoying. This is especially important as she's playing the title character and thus is always at the center of things, so that we actually enjoy watching the film because we enjoy watching her and it never once feels like a chore to sit through. (Sadly, her carrer seems to have been killed off thanks to being cast in pieces of crap like ""Thomas And The Magic Railroad"".)Also there's Danny Devito as Matilda's father. (Devito also narrates throughout the film, but not as his character, but in the third person.) Although as it's been mentioned before Devito doesn't much resemble the physical description of the father in the book, (who was described as a thin, wirey man,) Devito captures the spirit of the mean, crooked, thick-headed, unloving dad.

162942,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,0800130227,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","""Matilda"" is a cute and loving classic film. Matilda (Mara Wilson) is born into a horrible family who neglects her and refuses to give her the love and affection she deserves. Matilda is a very bright and smart little girl with a special power. At age of four, she knows how to multiply big numbers. At the age of six, she walks to the library all by herself and teaches herself how to read. Matilda learns how to do everything by herself.Unfortunately she is stuck with her horrible family.  Her father is a cheat, lowlife man that buys illegal car parts and her mom is a big diva who plays bingo all day. On the other hand, if it wasn't for Matilda's dreadful family, she would not have discovered that her mind is so strong that she's able to move objects just by thinking about it.I love the special affects in the movie. Matilda has the power to lift things with her mind and the way the camera angle is set up makes it look so realistic. I also like the narration throughout the movie because the movie skips parts of Matilda's life. Having the narration makes it easier to follow along with the storyline. I love how every role in the movie is such a despicable or unique character. There is a horrible, dreadful principal at the school, a sweet innocent teacher, a cheap dad and the awkward looking kids at school. What I didn't like in the film is how the horrible principal, Ms. Trunchbull, is very harsh and picks kids up from the hair and throws them or abuses them in other ways.I really love the relationship between Ms. Honey and Matilda. Ms. Honey (Embeth Davidtz) is by far my favorite character because she is just so sweet. She takes Matilda as her own child because she knows how mistreated and neglected Matilda is. Ms. Honey has a genuine heart that makes her very lovable.My favorite scene is when Matilda is four and is left all alone in the house and decides to start making pancakes from scratch. It is an adorable scene because normally a typical four-year-old wouldn't be doing that. So, it was very cute.I recommend ""Matilda"" for ages 7-11 because it is a great movie for kids. It will make your entire family laugh. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars so go check it out. It is playing on HDnet Kids Scenes the entire month of July.Reviewed by Jailene A, KIDS FIRST!

162955,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,0800130227,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[16, 38]","Matilda is an unwanted, mostly neglected child. Her father is a disreputible used car salesman and her mother is a self-absorbed Bingo player. Her parents obviously have taught her how to read, and they feed her - but they are otherwise pretty indifferent to her and refuse to acknowledge her intellegence.Children who grow up without any affirmation, love or physical contact do not grow up to be well-mannered, well-rounded functional people - yet Matilda apparently rises above those statistics by having an idiot-savant like  ability with math and an insatiable hunger for reading.Her parents refuse to let her go to school because she must stay at home to sign for packages of stolen car parts her father gets for his business. Defiant, she slips away to the library to escape into the world of literature.Her father finally sends her to school when one of his customers, Principal Trunchbull, brags about her school in which children are treated like the garbage that they are.  That's a nice message to send to children, isn't it?Trunchbull (Pam Ferris) is a chunky, javelin throwing, sadistic nut. She  has a faint mustache and is the obvious major antagonist of the story.The principal has a tiny closet with protruding nails she calls &quot;The Chokie&quot; which she gleefully places children as she sees fit. For this element alone, nobody should expose their children to a film like this.Beyond this horrific torture chamber, there is a strong suggestion that Trunchbull, who is the aunt of Matilda's beloved teacher, Miss Honey, likely murdered her own brother (Miss Honey's father) so she could have his money and his home. She is so evil, she even keeps photos of Honey's father and her childhood toys and dolls in a locker in the house and won't let her have them.She is not a sympathetic character in any way - she truly displays pleasure in throwing darts at photos of children, throwing children out of the school windows and picking up a child by her braided pigtails and swinging her around like a shotput.  She doesn't even like animals. She is truly loathesome and feels threatened by Matilda's obvious super-intelligence.For an unexplained reason, Matilda has a telekinetic ability and learns to concentrate her &quot;powers&quot; to retrieve Miss Honey's beloved objects and to terrorize the Trunchbull.This film scares children - it tells children that they can be abused by teachers or other authority figures and shouldn't bother to tell their parents or the police, because no one will believe them. Their only hope is to hope that they can develop some sort of pscyho-kinetic power or cast a spell to make their conditions less wretched.Is this the message we want to send to children?

Even though Matilda and the children finally triumph over the Trunchbull, the damage to a child's psyche has already been done.  The underlying message is - if someone perpetrates evil upon you, don't tell your parents or the police, but instead use resources at your disposal to seek revenge.Mara Wilson does a good job at the unusually confident, extroverted Matilda, but all the good acting in the world would not make this a film worth watching - especially for children.",1,a wretched tale,1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,3345,"['Matilda', 'unwanted', 'mostly', 'neglected', 'child', 'father', 'disreputible', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'mother', 'self-absorbed', 'Bingo', 'player', 'parents', 'obviously', 'have', 'taught', 'how', 'read', 'feed', 'are', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'indifferent', 'refuse', 'acknowledge', 'intellegence.Children', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'affirmation', 'love', 'physical', 'contact', 'do', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'well-mannered', 'well-rounded', 'functional', 'people', 'yet', 'Matilda', 'apparently', 'statistics', 'having', 'idiot-savant', 'ability', 'math', 'insatiable', 'hunger', 'reading.Her', 'parents', 'refuse', 'let', 'go', 'school', 'must', 'stay', 'home', 'sign', 'packages', 'stolen', 'car', 'parts', 'father', 'business', 'Defiant', 'away', 'library', 'escape', 'world', 'literature.Her', 'father', 'finally', 'school', 'when', 'one', 'customers', 'Principal', 'Trunchbull', 'school', 'children', 'are', 'treated', 'garbage', 'are', 'nice', 'message', 'send', 'children', ""n't"", 'Trunchbull', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'chunky', 'javelin', 'throwing', 'sadistic', 'nut', 'faint', 'mustache', 'obvious', 'major', 'antagonist', 'story.The', 'principal', 'tiny', 'closet', 'protruding', 'nails', 'quot', 'Chokie', 'quot', 'gleefully', 'children', 'fit', 'element', 'alone', 'nobody', 'should', 'expose', 'children', 'film', 'this.Beyond', 'horrific', 'torture', 'chamber', 'strong', 'suggestion', 'Trunchbull', 'who', 'aunt', 'Matilda', 'beloved', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Honey', 'likely', 'murdered', 'own', 'brother', 'Miss', 'Honey', 'father', 'could', 'have', 'money', 'home', 'so', 'evil', 'even', 'photos', 'Honey', 'father', 'childhood', 'toys', 'dolls', 'locker', 'house', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'them.She', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'way', 'truly', 'displays', 'pleasure', 'throwing', 'darts', 'photos', 'children', 'throwing', 'children', 'school', 'windows', 'picking', 'up', 'child', 'braided', 'pigtails', 'swinging', 'shotput', ""n't"", 'even', 'like', 'animals', 'truly', 'loathesome', 'feels', 'threatened', 'Matilda', 'obvious', 'super-intelligence.For', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'Matilda', 'telekinetic', 'ability', 'concentrate', 'quot', 'powers', 'quot', 'retrieve', 'Miss', 'Honey', 'beloved', 'objects', 'terrorize', 'Trunchbull.This', 'film', 'scares', 'children', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'abused', 'teachers', 'other', 'authority', 'figures', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'tell', 'parents', 'police', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'only', 'hope', 'hope', 'can', 'develop', 'sort', 'pscyho-kinetic', 'power', 'cast', 'spell', 'make', 'conditions', 'less', 'wretched.Is', 'message', 'want', 'send', 'children', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'book', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'wretched', 'not', 'entertaining', 'slightest', 'Even', 'Matilda', 'children', 'finally', 'triumph', 'Trunchbull', 'damage', 'child', 'psyche', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'underlying', 'message', 'someone', 'evil', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'parents', 'police', 'instead', 'use', 'resources', 'disposal', 'seek', 'revenge.Mara', 'Wilson', 'good', 'job', 'unusually', 'confident', 'extroverted', 'Matilda', 'good', 'acting', 'world', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'children']",N/A

The film, now seen to this point on, is much more intriguing than I would have thought and imagined mostly in context of the film, and possibly the novel's, criticism toward parenting, negligence, mistreatment, and authoritarian figures. While fantasy does overlay the story's rather believable nature toward the second half, it is nonetheless a rather frightening, violent (let us not forget the chokey), and upsetting indictment of how children become dissatisfied or tormented with what they see and be around. The PG rating is justified but parents are advised of potentially nightmarish material and occasional mixed messages the film conveys. Danny DeVito, the director of Matilda, conveys in a strange way this vision of two opposites, his narrative side focusing on Matilda's strengths and the rude, shady qualities that exist with the rest of the Wormwood family. Much of the characters can be construed as stereotypical but many of them are also believable and reassuring for younger audiences to see into how they are not alone. In many ways, Matilda is a modern and Americanised update of Alice in Wonderland and a sister work to Coraline in which they portray rather daring and independent women amidst chaos, crisis, and family breakdown. As a whole, it is a surprisingly genius film all these years since first seeing it and the positive messages within its female lead make for great mother-daughter discussion.""",5,"Poignant, mature, and frightening yet vivid, humourous, and intelligent all at once",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,1521,"['Matilda', 'now', 'was', 'finally', 'revisited', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'not', 'seeing', 'entirety', 'film', 'now', 'seen', 'point', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'imagined', 'mostly', 'context', 'film', 'possibly', 'novel', 'criticism', 'parenting', 'negligence', 'mistreatment', 'authoritarian', 'figures', 'fantasy', 'overlay', 'story', 'rather', 'believable', 'nature', 'second', 'half', 'nonetheless', 'rather', 'frightening', 'violent', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'chokey', 'upsetting', 'indictment', 'how', 'children', 'become', 'dissatisfied', 'tormented', 'what', 'see', 'be', 'around', 'PG', 'rating', 'justified', 'parents', 'are', 'advised', 'potentially', 'nightmarish', 'material', 'occasional', 'mixed', 'film', 'conveys', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'director', 'Matilda', 'conveys', 'strange', 'way', 'vision', 'two', 'opposites', 'narrative', 'side', 'focusing', 'Matilda', 'strengths', 'rude', 'shady', 'qualities', 'exist', 'rest', 'Wormwood', 'family', 'Much', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'stereotypical', 'many', 'are', 'also', 'believable', 'reassuring', 'younger', 'audiences', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'many', 'ways', 'Matilda', 'modern', 'Americanised', 'update', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'sister', 'work', 'Coraline', 'portray', 'rather', 'daring', 'independent', 'women', 'amidst', 'chaos', 'crisis', 'family', 'breakdown', 'whole', 'surprisingly', 'genius', 'film', 'years', 'first', 'seeing', 'positive', 'messages', 'female', 'lead', 'make', 'great', 'mother-daughter', 'discussion']",N/A

I now have a first grader who loves books and reading, and she just finished the book by Roald Dahl, so we decided to check the movie out. We watched it together tonight and though I preferred the book, my first grader loved the movie. It is quite a good adaptation, though there are some wince-inducing scenes, especially those involving the cruel and sadistic principal of Matilda's school.The story centers on Matilda (played to perfection by the charming Mara Wilson). Matilda is a misfit in her own family. Her parents and older brother are insensitive, self-absorbed individuals who prefer watching idiotic shows on television rather than improving their brains with books. They treat Matilda with contempt and derision, but Matilda takes it in her stride, choosing to broaden her mind with books, walking ten blocks to the library, and being a pleasant, polite little girl. Her great ally is her gentle teacher Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz) who sees Matilda's potential and identifies her as a kindred spirit.The movie does contain some very disturbing sequences which might terrify younger children. Having read the book and watching the movie with my daughter helped her understand some of the abusive language used against Matilda. Her father frequently calls her ""dumb"" and even a ""twit"". The principal, Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris) likens her to a ""villainous sack of gobslime"". There are also violent scenes such as the principal forcing a young boy to gorge on a huge chocolate cake, and many more.Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman portray Matilda's selfish, irresponsible parents to the hilt. Mara Wilson credibly and charmingly plays the brilliant child who learns to not only overcome adversity, but remains humbled by her intelligence, and helps others stand up for what is right. Matilda is a positive role model for children everywhere, and the story inspires a love of knowledge and helps children understand how good ultimately triumphs over evil.",5,Mara Wilson is perfect as Matilda,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,2051,"['read', 'Matilda', 'young', 'child', 'loved', 'title', 'character', 'being', 'bookworm', 'now', 'have', 'first', 'grader', 'who', 'books', 'reading', 'just', 'finished', 'book', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'decided', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'watched', 'together', 'tonight', 'preferred', 'book', 'first', 'grader', 'loved', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'adaptation', 'are', 'wince-inducing', 'scenes', 'especially', 'involving', 'cruel', 'sadistic', 'principal', 'Matilda', 'school.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Matilda', 'played', 'perfection', 'charming', 'Mara', 'Wilson', 'Matilda', 'misfit', 'own', 'family', 'parents', 'older', 'brother', 'are', 'insensitive', 'self-absorbed', 'individuals', 'who', 'prefer', 'watching', 'idiotic', 'shows', 'television', 'rather', 'improving', 'brains', 'books', 'treat', 'Matilda', 'contempt', 'derision', 'Matilda', 'stride', 'choosing', 'broaden', 'mind', 'books', 'walking', 'ten', 'blocks', 'library', 'being', 'pleasant', 'polite', 'little', 'girl', 'great', 'ally', 'gentle', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Honey', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'who', 'Matilda', 'potential', 'kindred', 'spirit.The', 'movie', 'contain', 'very', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'might', 'terrify', 'younger', 'children', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'daughter', 'helped', 'understand', 'abusive', 'language', 'used', 'Matilda', 'father', 'frequently', 'dumb', 'even', 'twit', 'principal', 'Miss', 'Trunchbull', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'villainous', 'sack', 'gobslime', 'are', 'also', 'violent', 'scenes', 'such', 'principal', 'forcing', 'young', 'boy', 'gorge', 'huge', 'chocolate', 'cake', 'many', 'more.Danny', 'DeVito', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'Matilda', 'selfish', 'irresponsible', 'parents', 'hilt', 'Mara', 'Wilson', 'credibly', 'charmingly', 'brilliant', 'child', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'humbled', 'intelligence', 'others', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'Matilda', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'children', 'everywhere', 'story', 'love', 'knowledge', 'children', 'understand', 'how', 'good', 'ultimately', 'triumphs', 'evil']",N/A
