1655539,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DGCIYZC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 14]","The HBO Original movie ""Mary and Martha"" is one of those inspiring true life tales which showcases that individuals really can make a difference in the world.  Unfortunately, in this case, the realization comes at a huge expense for those involved.  Hilary Swank and Brenda Blethyn play two mothers, one American and one English, who lose their sons due to malaria while in Africa.  From this heartbreak, a crusade begins.  In this day and age, when deaths like these can be prevented, why are so many Africans succumbing to conditions that could be made so much better?  Certainly it's a valid and necessary question.  In some jaded ways, you could argue (and some undoubtedly will) that ""Mary and Martha"" is just one more movie where privileged white people are needed to save the day in Africa.  It certainly is a recurrent theme in American films!  Here, though, that didn't bother me.  These women were looking for a way out of their grief, a way to assuage their feelings of guilt, anger, and powerlessness.  They didn't set out to be do-gooders, they were thrust into activity by circumstances.As the movie begins, we get a bit of background on the families involved.  Blethyn's adult son (rising star Sam Claflin) is getting set to go abroad and teach in an African school.  Meanwhile, Swank's boy is facing some bullying and difficulty in his classes.  Instead of dealing with these issues in a normal way, she whisks them both off for a six month sabbatical.  Oh, the privileges of wealth!  I wish I could just go away to escape my problems!  But I digress.  Tragedy strikes and both women are left to make sense of what happened.  Quite by chance, they meet and strike up a friendship.  And it dawns on Swank, as she investigates the situation, just how prevalent the problem is within the local communities.  United by what has happened, the bond that forms between Mary and Martha becomes the centerpiece for the movie.  But Swank is not content to let sleeping dogs lie, even at the personal cost of derailing her marriage.  When she realizes how little funding is going into worldwide malaria treatment, she attempts to do something about it.  With the assistance of her estranged, but politically connected, father (James Wood), they seek to bring the issue to national attention.""Mary and Martha"" is earnest, heartfelt and incredibly emotional.  It's hard not to be connected with this fascinating story which is simultaneously tragic and uplifting.  Nobody does dogged determination like Hilary Swank, it's become her trademark.  With her stern jaw and unwavering stare, her crusade becomes an obsession.  But I believed it wholeheartedly.  Blethyn may have the less showy role, but it is also a bit trickier.  She truly starts to find a sense of self within this process.  Claflin scores in his small role, and Frank Grillo is strong as Swank's incredibly patient husband.  The screenplay was written by Richard Curtis, known for frothier films such as ""Love Actually"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" and was directed by Philip Noyce.  In many ways, ""Mary and Martha"" is a straightforward and simple story.  But it packs an emotional punch.  The climatic scenes will both break your heart (especially Blethyn's testimony) and inspire you beyond all measure.  The movie is a testament to friendship and perseverance and the talented cast will truly draw you in.

1655541,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00DGCIYZC,Sheryl Fechter,"[3, 4]","For me, this was surprisingly written by Richard Curtis, who pens some of the most engaging comedies and romantic comedies to date; Love Actually, Pirate Radio, About Time, and Bridget Jones' Diary.  Do I even need to keep going?  Here Curtis writes an Original HBO Movie about grieving and the emotional turmoil of two completely different women. One, a married American interior designer and the other a married English homemaker, caught in the same circumstance far beyond their control, or belief.  Director Phillip Noyce brings a heart wrenching story with a point while developing Hilary Swank into a steadfast woman (Mary) behind a cause that must be near and dear to her own heart to have rendered such a superb performance.  Brenda Blethyn (Martha) is equally shattered, feeling helpless and hopeless as she returns to the continent of Africa only to meet an inconsolable Mary.These two mothers have lost their only children to Malaria, a preventable disease with the proper prior considerations.  Mary lost her young child, George (Lux Haney-Jardine), during a six month homeschooling type sabbatical.  Martha's son, Ben (Sam Claflin), decided to take a teaching position there arriving at the same end as young George.  These two mothers cannot get their former lives back to anywhere near normalcy as the plight in Africa is ever looming.  With some aid from Mary's emotionally distant father (James Woods), although, being somewhat politically connected, these brave and tenacious women advance the cause of stopping malaria from sweeping Africa in epidemic proportions.In this film, the mothers were not cast into or headed straight in with all of the knowledge of malaria and being bent on changing it.  These two are struggling so deeply to find their way back from the grief that is gripping them.  The world horribly stretched out and struck them, now they are left to find a reason to give their particular situation a purpose - and a reason for changing it.  The script is delicately written in this direction and I could definitely appreciate its point of view.Because the theme of the movie is so dark and difficult to watch, I went through Kleenex like anyone else. The African views (Roberto De Angelis) were superlative.  The continent seems to show-off for the camera quite easy.  The terrific, and vastly different than what I would have expected, music (Philip Miller) was a joy to hear.  Give a close listen to their take on Country/Western music.  The blending of the former along with the staunchly African beats was an enormous treat, mainly in the first half of the story.  Then be ready if you are at all like me to have tears falling from the terrific writing, direction, and acting while showing what could possibly be done about this growing crisis.",5,Two Mothers Connected By Loss But Inspired By Hope ...,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,2786,"['was', 'surprisingly', 'written', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'who', 'most', 'engaging', 'comedies', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'date', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Pirate', 'Radio', 'About', 'Time', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Do', 'even', 'need', 'keep', 'going', 'Here', 'Curtis', 'Original', 'HBO', 'Movie', 'grieving', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'women', 'One', 'married', 'American', 'interior', 'designer', 'other', 'married', 'English', 'homemaker', 'caught', 'same', 'circumstance', 'far', 'control', 'belief', 'Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'story', 'point', 'developing', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'steadfast', 'woman', 'Mary', 'cause', 'must', 'be', 'dear', 'own', 'heart', 'have', 'rendered', 'superb', 'performance', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Martha', 'equally', 'shattered', 'feeling', 'helpless', 'hopeless', 'continent', 'Africa', 'only', 'meet', 'inconsolable', 'Mary.These', 'two', 'mothers', 'have', 'lost', 'only', 'children', 'Malaria', 'preventable', 'disease', 'proper', 'prior', 'considerations', 'Mary', 'lost', 'young', 'child', 'George', 'Lux', 'Haney-Jardine', 'six', 'month', 'homeschooling', 'type', 'sabbatical', 'Martha', 'son', 'Ben', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'decided', 'take', 'teaching', 'position', 'there', 'arriving', 'same', 'end', 'young', 'George', 'two', 'mothers', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'former', 'lives', 'back', 'anywhere', 'near', 'normalcy', 'plight', 'Africa', 'ever', 'looming', 'aid', 'Mary', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'father', 'James', 'Woods', 'being', 'somewhat', 'politically', 'connected', 'brave', 'tenacious', 'women', 'cause', 'stopping', 'malaria', 'sweeping', 'Africa', 'epidemic', 'proportions.In', 'film', 'mothers', 'were', 'not', 'cast', 'headed', 'straight', 'knowledge', 'malaria', 'being', 'bent', 'changing', 'two', 'are', 'struggling', 'so', 'deeply', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'grief', 'gripping', 'world', 'horribly', 'stretched', 'out', 'struck', 'now', 'are', 'left', 'find', 'reason', 'give', 'particular', 'situation', 'purpose', 'reason', 'changing', 'script', 'delicately', 'written', 'direction', 'could', 'definitely', 'appreciate', 'point', 'theme', 'movie', 'so', 'dark', 'difficult', 'watch', 'went', 'Kleenex', 'anyone', 'else', 'African', 'views', 'Roberto', 'De', 'Angelis', 'were', 'superlative', 'continent', 'show-off', 'camera', 'quite', 'easy', 'terrific', 'vastly', 'different', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'music', 'Philip', 'Miller', 'was', 'joy', 'hear', 'Give', 'close', 'listen', 'take', 'Country/Western', 'music', 'blending', 'former', 'staunchly', 'African', 'beats', 'was', 'enormous', 'treat', 'mainly', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'Then', 'be', 'ready', 'are', 'have', 'tears', 'falling', 'terrific', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'showing', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'done', 'growing', 'crisis']",Mary and Martha
