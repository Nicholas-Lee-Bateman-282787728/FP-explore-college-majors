I thought the story was moving and that a lot of handicapped kids can find love in horses by relating to the story of Wind Dancer.,4,Wind Dancer,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,249,"['am', '13', 'girl', 'who', 'riding', 'horses', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'story', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'horses', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'moving', 'lot', 'handicapped', 'kids', 'can', 'find', 'love', 'horses', 'relating', 'story', 'Wind', 'Dancer']",Wind Dancer

The music is sad and annoying and the main character isn't likeable.It's simply about a girl who falls off a horse and injures herself because she didn't listen to her dad who told her not to ride if she was sick.So she has to learn trust and hard work....things like that from a therapist who lives with her at the family ranch. There's a lot of predictable elements and the movie leaves a slightly bad after taste.",2,Not Too Great,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,467,"['did', ""n't"", 'abhor', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'music', 'sad', 'annoying', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'likeable.It', 'simply', 'girl', 'who', 'horse', 'injures', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'dad', 'who', 'told', 'not', 'ride', 'was', 'sick.So', 'learn', 'trust', 'hard', 'work', '.things', 'therapist', 'who', 'family', 'ranch', 'lot', 'predictable', 'elements', 'movie', 'slightly', 'bad', 'taste']",Wind Dancer

But as soon as I started watching I was hooked from beginning to end and would watch it whenever I caught it in the TV guide. I was super excited to find it finally on DVD.It's a movie that'll give you inspiration, and make you shed tears of joy throughout. It sets a good message to anyone who's been through a hard time and thought that there was no light at the end of the tunnel.",5,Heartwarming Movie for All!,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,518,"['remember', 'first', 'catching', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'movie', 'channel', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'anything', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'watching', 'was', 'hooked', 'beginning', 'end', 'would', 'watch', 'whenever', 'caught', 'TV', 'guide', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'find', 'finally', 'DVD.It', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'give', 'inspiration', 'make', 'shed', 'tears', 'joy', 'good', 'message', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'hard', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel']",Wind Dancer
663328,A2T8L3RQCW3ESR,B00005LE3W,"Mike Patrick, professor of media","[0, 0]","This message movie that plays like a ""Very Special `Blossom'"" is suitable kiddie fare for parents who want to inspire some spunk in their Nintendo DS-obsessed kids, but grownups will really only appreciate it for the performance of Brian Keith, who plays the good-hearted curmudgeon role he built his career on.To sum up, a remarkably Blossom-looking teen ends up in a wheelchair after taking a bad spill off her horse, so her dad brings her and a kid shrink to Keith's ranch, where she predictably becomes attached to a palomino named Wind Dancer.While faux-Blossom's relationship with Wind Dancer helps her heal, some conniving horse thieves - played more broadly and terribly than Jason Alexander and Renee Russo did ""Boris and Natasha"" - have their own plans for the horse.Faux-Blossom is a good little actress, and it's sad what happened to her later in life (Google it). It's also sad what happened to Brian Keith a couple years later (Google that, too), but his fans know that and are happy he left understated little performances like this in his legacy.Regardless, ""Wind Dancer"" is cut from the same cloth as a ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" flick, and those are always good for a Family Movie Night, for those of you who use DVDs to spark poignant family discussion instead of as a tool to leave the kids drooling in front of SpongeBob while you do whatever it is you consider more important than spending time with your kids.""Wind Dancer"" is part of a 15-movie set from Echo Bridge that costs a fin at K-Mart, and it's a standout on a DVD that's not worth much more than that. I recommend buying it, especially because that set also includes the sweet Africa-set movie ""Askari,"" which harkens back to Disney's early 1970s live-action films, and is worth all five bucks on its own.Don't go Netflixing ""Wind Dancer"" otherwise, unless you have kids for whom you're looking to teach a Very Valuable Lesson that you don't have the parenting skills to teach without a movie nobody's ever heard of.But if you do decide to talk to your kids about ""Wind Dancer,"" I recommend including the life story of the lead actress as a cautionary tale.",3,Suitable kiddie fare; grownups will like Brian Keith,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,2136,"['message', 'movie', 'Very', 'Special', 'Blossom', 'suitable', 'kiddie', 'fare', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'inspire', 'spunk', 'Nintendo', 'DS-obsessed', 'kids', 'grownups', 'will', 'really', 'only', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'who', 'good-hearted', 'curmudgeon', 'role', 'built', 'career', 'on.To', 'sum', 'up', 'remarkably', 'Blossom-looking', 'teen', 'up', 'wheelchair', 'taking', 'bad', 'spill', 'horse', 'dad', 'kid', 'shrink', 'Keith', 'ranch', 'where', 'predictably', 'attached', 'palomino', 'named', 'Wind', 'Dancer.While', 'faux-Blossom', 'relationship', 'Wind', 'Dancer', 'heal', 'conniving', 'horse', 'thieves', 'played', 'more', 'broadly', 'terribly', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'did', 'Boris', 'Natasha', 'have', 'own', 'plans', 'horse.Faux-Blossom', 'good', 'little', 'actress', 'sad', 'what', 'happened', 'later', 'life', 'Google', 'also', 'sad', 'what', 'happened', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Google', 'too', 'fans', 'know', 'are', 'happy', 'left', 'understated', 'little', 'performances', 'legacy.Regardless', 'Wind', 'Dancer', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'flick', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'Family', 'Movie', 'Night', 'who', 'use', 'DVDs', 'spark', 'poignant', 'family', 'discussion', 'instead', 'tool', 'leave', 'kids', 'drooling', 'front', 'SpongeBob', 'do', 'whatever', 'consider', 'more', 'important', 'spending', 'time', 'kids', 'Wind', 'Dancer', 'part', '15-movie', 'set', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'fin', 'K-Mart', 'standout', 'DVD', 'not', 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'recommend', 'buying', 'especially', 'set', 'also', 'sweet', 'Africa-set', 'movie', 'Askari', 'back', 'Disney', 'early', '1970s', 'live-action', 'films', 'worth', 'five', 'bucks', 'own.Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Netflixing', 'Wind', 'Dancer', 'otherwise', 'have', 'kids', 'whom', ""'re"", 'looking', 'teach', 'Very', 'Valuable', 'Lesson', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'parenting', 'skills', 'teach', 'movie', 'nobody', 'ever', 'heard', 'of.But', 'do', 'decide', 'talk', 'kids', 'Wind', 'Dancer', 'recommend', 'including', 'life', 'story', 'lead', 'actress', 'cautionary', 'tale']",Wind Dancer
