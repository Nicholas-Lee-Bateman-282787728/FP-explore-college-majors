""The Great Kat"" is shocking to behold regardless, wantonly discarding all cultural preconceptions of female behavior to dress in bloody leather wear and crucifix tattoos. Her guitar performance is beyond energetic, transcending to the level of mania, as she shreds a ferocious medley of Beethoven, Bach, and raw fervor. The seven shred videos share a raucous blend of classical music, heavy metal, and stinging social commentary. Bonus features include a cartoon and hot photos of Kat at her finest (or wildest)!
