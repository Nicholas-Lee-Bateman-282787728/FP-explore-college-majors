It's just a fun, more adult themed Doctor Who-ish show. I decided to just get the whole series, instead of buying them seperately. It's actually a well made series, with decent characters and decent effects. Worth watching, if you like your Sci-Fi on the side of different.",5,I love this show,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,346,"['Yes', 'had', 'bad/cheesy', 'acting', 'American', 'less', 'just', 'fun', 'more', 'adult', 'themed', 'Doctor', 'Who-ish', 'show', 'decided', 'just', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'instead', 'buying', 'seperately', 'actually', 'well', 'made', 'series', 'decent', 'characters', 'decent', 'effects', 'Worth', 'watching', 'Sci-Fi', 'side', 'different']",Torchwood: Series 1-4

ABIGT ""Avatar42""","[0, 0]",I love this series and I'm kind of torn about giving this set just 4 stars but as many have noted you will probably have a problem playing the Miracle Day disks. While I like the idea that you can author a disk region free and any player will play it. Unfortunately this is not the case. But there are players that will play both these 50i disks AND the US disks you are used to! You can find a list of players here [...] Note only some actually convert 50 to 60 and that is what you want. The good news is most appear to be less than $100 if you can find them. If like me you watch a lot of BBC it is worth the investment. I bought the LG Electronics BP530 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi as it was the only one on the list I could find locally. (Was worried about maybe having to try multiple models.) It works great! You CAN also get them to play on your PC IF you have a Bluray drive AND VLC with the aacs decoder added (google VLC Bluray) but you will still have to load them via the file menu with no menus and play the titles like files. The other PC players I tried did not like them at all but maybe one will.,4,Miracle Day disks are 50i NOT bad,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,1117,"['love', 'series', ""'m"", 'kind', 'torn', 'giving', 'set', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'problem', 'playing', 'Miracle', 'Day', 'disks', 'like', 'idea', 'can', 'author', 'disk', 'region', 'free', 'player', 'will', 'play', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'are', 'players', 'will', 'play', '50i', 'disks', 'US', 'disks', 'are', 'used', 'can', 'find', 'list', 'players', 'here', '[', ']', 'Note', 'only', 'actually', 'convert', '50', '60', 'what', 'want', 'good', 'news', 'most', 'appear', 'be', 'less', '100', 'can', 'find', 'watch', 'lot', 'BBC', 'investment', 'bought', 'LG', 'Electronics', 'BP530', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', 'Player', 'Wi-Fi', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'list', 'could', 'find', 'locally', 'Was', 'worried', 'maybe', 'having', 'try', 'multiple', 'models', 'great', 'CAN', 'also', 'get', 'play', 'PC', 'IF', 'have', 'Bluray', 'drive', 'AND', 'VLC', 'aacs', 'decoder', 'added', 'google', 'VLC', 'Bluray', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'load', 'file', 'menu', 'menus', 'play', 'titles', 'files', 'other', 'PC', 'players', 'tried', 'did', 'not', 'maybe', 'one', 'will']",Torchwood: Series 1-4

1461850,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B005IF7HNA,Rick L. Parrish,"[0, 0]",I had no problem with the last series that others have complained isn't region free.  I have an LG combo H-D/Blu-Ray machine that is a behemoth (and cost $700 way back when) that has no problem playing the series on my Panasonic Plasma TV 2010 model.  The transfer is great in picture and sound and the show was much better than I expected.  This is definitely the way to watch it!  I'd recommend it.,5,It's Region Free For Me At Least & It's A Great Sci-Fi Series!!,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,400,"['had', 'problem', 'last', 'series', 'others', 'have', 'complained', ""n't"", 'region', 'free', 'have', 'LG', 'combo', 'H-D/Blu-Ray', 'machine', 'behemoth', 'cost', '700', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'problem', 'playing', 'series', 'Panasonic', 'Plasma', 'TV', '2010', 'model', 'transfer', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'definitely', 'way', 'watch', ""'d"", 'recommend']",Torchwood: Series 1-4
