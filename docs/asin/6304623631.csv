Olsen,"[3, 4]","Remakes of classic movies are not often on par with the original, but my family finds this as enjoyable as the original version starring Janet Leigh and Robert Mitchum. In this take on the story Cynthia Gibb plays a young widowed Mom who can't let go of her past and seems to be trying to groom her son, Timmy, to become the ""man of the house"".*Spoilers*After playing a part in the firing of a store clerk she feels bad and offers to buy him lunch. They spend the rest of the day together with him following her around carrying all of the packages she is buying. They get separated on the subway and he tracks her down and shows up at her apartment that evening to deliver the packages, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend. A series of events (the mysterious arrival of an expensive toy train for Timmy on Christmas morning, the arrest of the store clerk on Christmas Day, and the returning of the cost of the train after Timmy takes it back to the store) keeps bringing them together. The attraction between them is obvious, but after the trial of losing her husband she now wants security and stability in her life and he is a much more free and easy type. So she becomes engaged to her boyfriend who is the steady, predictable type. Her son is not thrilled and in his frustration, makes things difficult.Things really come to a head on Christmas Day when her in-laws from her first marriage come for the holiday celebration. An awkward moment in front of them with her two suitors forces her to make a quick decision, but later, as she celebrates New Year's Eve alone with her son, she considers what she has done and whether or not it will get her what she really wants. Maybe she has missed her chance.Heartwarming, fun, clean, and filled with holiday cheer, this is worth adding to your holiday movie collection.",4,A Reasonably Good Remake,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,1819,"['Remakes', 'classic', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'often', 'par', 'original', 'family', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'original', 'version', 'starring', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'take', 'story', 'Cynthia', 'Gibb', 'young', 'widowed', 'Mom', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'past', 'be', 'trying', 'groom', 'son', 'Timmy', 'become', 'man', 'house', '*Spoilers*After', 'playing', 'part', 'firing', 'store', 'clerk', 'bad', 'buy', 'lunch', 'spend', 'rest', 'day', 'together', 'following', 'carrying', 'packages', 'buying', 'get', 'separated', 'subway', 'down', 'up', 'apartment', 'evening', 'deliver', 'packages', 'much', 'chagrin', 'boyfriend', 'series', 'events', 'mysterious', 'arrival', 'expensive', 'toy', 'train', 'Timmy', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'arrest', 'store', 'clerk', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'returning', 'cost', 'train', 'Timmy', 'back', 'store', 'bringing', 'together', 'attraction', 'obvious', 'trial', 'losing', 'husband', 'now', 'security', 'stability', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'free', 'easy', 'type', 'engaged', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'steady', 'predictable', 'type', 'son', 'not', 'thrilled', 'frustration', 'things', 'difficult.Things', 'really', 'come', 'head', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'when', 'in-laws', 'first', 'marriage', 'come', 'holiday', 'celebration', 'awkward', 'moment', 'front', 'two', 'suitors', 'make', 'quick', 'decision', 'later', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'alone', 'son', 'what', 'done', 'not', 'will', 'get', 'what', 'really', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'chance.Heartwarming', 'fun', 'clean', 'filled', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'worth', 'adding', 'holiday', 'movie', 'collection']",Holiday Affair VHS
