934264,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000AXWHP8,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","The third of these PBS American Mystery specials produced by Robert Redford. They're all good, but this one is some easier to follow than the other two.Young Navajo police officer Jim Chee (Adam Beach) and senior officer Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) have two mysteries to solve, and they become locked together. One is a stolen backhoe that Jim is sent to investigate, and the other is a ""pot picker"" (person who steals ancient clay pots from Navajo land and sells them on the collector's market) that is Joe's responsibility. But when two people, a white man and an Indian, are found dead with the backhoe, it becomes clear that the archeologists working in the Anasazi ruins are involved.A brief appearance by Peter Fonda, as Harrison Hauk, a Mormon farmer in the area who has an interesting history with Joe Leaphorn, is just one of the complications. And once again, I did not guess the ultimate outcome of the mystery. To me, that's the sign of a story well told, especially when I say ""I should have seen that"" after the truth is revealed.",4,Tony Hillerman Wrote It; Robert Redford Directed It,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1041,"['third', 'PBS', 'American', 'Mystery', 'specials', 'produced', 'Robert', 'Redford', ""'re"", 'good', 'one', 'easier', 'follow', 'other', 'two.Young', 'Navajo', 'police', 'officer', 'Jim', 'Chee', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'senior', 'officer', 'Joe', 'Leaphorn', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'have', 'two', 'mysteries', 'solve', 'become', 'locked', 'together', 'One', 'stolen', 'backhoe', 'Jim', 'sent', 'investigate', 'other', 'pot', 'picker', 'person', 'who', 'ancient', 'clay', 'pots', 'Navajo', 'land', 'collector', 'market', 'Joe', 'responsibility', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'white', 'man', 'Indian', 'are', 'found', 'dead', 'backhoe', 'clear', 'archeologists', 'working', 'Anasazi', 'ruins', 'are', 'involved.A', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Harrison', 'Hauk', 'Mormon', 'farmer', 'area', 'who', 'interesting', 'history', 'Joe', 'Leaphorn', 'just', 'one', 'complications', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'guess', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'mystery', 'sign', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'especially', 'when', 'say', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'truth', 'revealed']",N/A

However is suggest you read the book first or at the least are familiar with the characters first. There is only so much film time and this really needed to be a mini-series. Each character's background and personality was alluded to.  The visuals are par-exultant. You feel that you are in Four-corners territory.The picked a perfect cast of actors. Most have played in other Hillerman book films, so you recognize the characters. I know you can look up the list but I still am amazed at how I immediately associate the characters with the characters. To name a few Wes Studi (Cherokee) as Joe Leaphorn, Sheila Tousey (Menominee and Stockbridge-Munsee Indian) as Emma Leaphorn, and Graham Greene (He is an Oneida Indian)as Slick Nakai.This presentation follows the Hillerman formula for two intertwined mysteries that start for different purposes and sometimes end differently and not combined. On occasion Hillerman stories really do not end.  Jim Chee must track down a missing back-hoe that he let get pilfered from a secure compound. Joe Leaphorn must track down a suspected pot thief or a thief of time. One of their paths crossings is through a preacher appropriately named Slick. When the back-hoe user turns up dispatched and the pot thief is missing, they may find that the two stories are one.We are quite lucky that the story did not get twisted by Robert Redford as he has his own agenda and quit often bends stories for his own purpose. In the movie ""Skinwalkers"" the Skinwalkers have been for all practical purposes removed. Robert Redford did the same thing is several other productions ruining the whole purpose of the story.

934271,A3VY0Y0J93ZO59,B000AXWHP8,"Jonathan Hansen ""Random Scribe""","[1, 1]","Thief of Time is the 3rd of these PBS American Mystery dramas, produced by Robert Redford and based on the novels by Tony Hillerman.  The release dates of each drama are as follows:2002American Mystery! Special: Skinwalkers2003Mystery! Coyote Waits2005A Thief of TimeHaving recently purchased each of these through Amazon Marketplace I'm now inspired to explore the books for myself.  This title ""Thief of Time"" works well as a metaphor to reflect on interpersonal associations between the characters in all three dramas.I love Adam Beach as Deputy Jim Chee, having also enjoyed his appearance  in the movieWindtalkerswith Nicholas Cage.  Oh, and did I mention his gregarious nature, a smile with halogen luminescence, and athletic build.  When we see his interactions with his girl friend Janet, a feisty Public Defender, it's clear his obligations are severely demanding.Deputy Chee's living accommodations are Spartan from first appearances.  But this college educated (University of New Mexico) Medicine man(trained by Navajo Elders), follows a path of public service which means making himself available to all sorts of demands on his time.  No one can get close to him without literally bursting in on his other obligations, which makes for some great situational irony.Regarding Detective Joe Leaphorn, he's a crusty, hard-nosed, non-talkative, no-nonsense investigator.  Joe is easier to respect than he is to like.  The relationship dynamic between Joe and his Navajo wife Emma is a delight to watch.  She's a more than patient, more than strong enough woman who puts up with his grouchiness and more.As the various plots unfold, we're introduced to her ongoing battle as a cancer survivor.  When the first episode (Skinwalkers) has her passing through a room where Joe is researching the term ""Skinwalker,"" she jibes him,  ""Surfing for porn? Joe.""  (When she's joking.)When he grunts, ""yeah, right,""  her total indifference to whatever he's looking at belies the depths of her trust and tolerance.  The fact he isn't porn surfing, and the fact that their efforts at intimacy collide with his erectile dysfunction during the third episode makes for extremely awkward conversation, after the fact, (comparing her totally different demeanor, when she's not joking.)  Even though it's not a joke, and necessarily sanitized for PBS, there's something strangely touching about a couple of adults struggling to discuss something so personal without actually naming it.  Without the trade names of big pharma (i.e. Viagra or Ciallis, etc.) it's just a bit pathological.Altogether, the mysteries themselves are resolved.  The quirks of reservation gossip and the cinematography of stunningly beautiful Arizona desert landscapes are punctuated by crises shrouded in superstitious wonder.",5,The Virtue of Silence Can Be an Obstacle,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,2787,"['Thief', 'Time', '3rd', 'PBS', 'American', 'Mystery', 'dramas', 'produced', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'based', 'novels', 'Tony', 'Hillerman', 'release', 'dates', 'drama', 'are', 'follows:2002American', 'Mystery', 'Special', 'Skinwalkers2003Mystery', 'Coyote', 'Waits2005A', 'Thief', 'TimeHaving', 'recently', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'Marketplace', ""'m"", 'now', 'inspired', 'explore', 'books', 'myself', 'title', 'Thief', 'Time', 'well', 'metaphor', 'reflect', 'interpersonal', 'associations', 'characters', 'three', 'dramas.I', 'love', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'Deputy', 'Jim', 'Chee', 'having', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'appearance', 'movieWindtalkerswith', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'gregarious', 'nature', 'smile', 'halogen', 'luminescence', 'athletic', 'build', 'When', 'see', 'interactions', 'girl', 'friend', 'Janet', 'feisty', 'Public', 'Defender', 'clear', 'obligations', 'are', 'severely', 'demanding.Deputy', 'Chee', 'living', 'accommodations', 'are', 'Spartan', 'first', 'appearances', 'college', 'educated', 'University', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Medicine', 'man', 'trained', 'Navajo', 'Elders', 'path', 'public', 'service', 'making', 'available', 'sorts', 'demands', 'time', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'close', 'literally', 'bursting', 'other', 'obligations', 'great', 'situational', 'irony.Regarding', 'Detective', 'Joe', 'Leaphorn', 'crusty', 'hard-nosed', 'non-talkative', 'no-nonsense', 'investigator', 'Joe', 'easier', 'respect', 'like', 'relationship', 'dynamic', 'Joe', 'Navajo', 'wife', 'Emma', 'delight', 'watch', 'more', 'patient', 'more', 'strong', 'enough', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'grouchiness', 'more.As', 'various', 'plots', 'unfold', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'When', 'first', 'episode', 'Skinwalkers', 'passing', 'room', 'where', 'Joe', 'researching', 'term', 'Skinwalker', 'Surfing', 'porn', 'Joe', 'When', 'joking', 'When', 'yeah', 'right', 'total', 'indifference', 'whatever', 'looking', 'belies', 'depths', 'trust', 'tolerance', 'fact', ""n't"", 'porn', 'surfing', 'fact', 'efforts', 'intimacy', 'collide', 'erectile', 'dysfunction', 'third', 'episode', 'extremely', 'awkward', 'conversation', 'fact', 'comparing', 'totally', 'different', 'demeanor', 'when', 'not', 'joking', 'Even', 'not', 'joke', 'necessarily', 'sanitized', 'PBS', 'something', 'strangely', 'touching', 'couple', 'adults', 'struggling', 'discuss', 'something', 'so', 'personal', 'actually', 'naming', 'trade', 'names', 'big', 'pharma', 'i.e', 'Viagra', 'Ciallis', 'etc', 'just', 'bit', 'pathological.Altogether', 'mysteries', 'are', 'resolved', 'quirks', 'reservation', 'gossip', 'cinematography', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'landscapes', 'are', 'punctuated', 'crises', 'shrouded', 'superstitious', 'wonder']",N/A
