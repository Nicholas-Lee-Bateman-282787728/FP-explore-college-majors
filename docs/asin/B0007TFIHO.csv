889152,A2OF0Z2L9STEQF,B0007TFIHO,Kevin Caffrey,"[26, 26]","This DVD is basically an hour's worth of lesser-known rock critics and musicians talking about Genesis' albums from _Trespass_ through _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_.  In between the nearly universal praise, is live footage from these years, with the band performing songs including ""Stagnation,"" ""The Musical Box,"" and ""Dancing with the Moonlight Knight.""  These are not complete perfomances, mind you, just a few minutes worth of each.The difference between this Classic Rock ""Inside"" issue and the one done on Yes (68-73) is that the critics/musicians here really have nothing negative to say about this period in the career of Genesis.  What was actually refreshing about the Yes issue was that it had positive *and* negative viewpoints.  So after a while of watching this DVD, the viewer might get a little bored with the same accolades (""excellent arrangements""...""holds the listener's attention for the duration of the song""...etc.).  Another head-scratcher is the fact that _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_ only gets about four minutes worth of discussion, as opposed to the 10 minutes on every other album.All in all, diehard Genesis fans might not learn anything new or interesting from this unless one simply enjoy hearing music journalists talk about the albums, songs, and performances from the Gabriel years of Genesis.",2,Talking Heads on Genesis,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,1335,"['DVD', 'basically', 'hour', 'worth', 'lesser-known', 'rock', 'critics', 'musicians', 'talking', 'Genesis', 'albums', '_Trespass_', '_The', 'Lamb', 'Lies', 'Down', 'Broadway_', 'nearly', 'universal', 'praise', 'live', 'footage', 'years', 'band', 'performing', 'songs', 'including', 'Stagnation', 'Musical', 'Box', 'Dancing', 'Moonlight', 'Knight', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'perfomances', 'mind', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'each.The', 'difference', 'Classic', 'Rock', 'Inside', 'issue', 'one', 'done', 'Yes', '68-73', 'critics/musicians', 'here', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'negative', 'say', 'period', 'career', 'Genesis', 'What', 'was', 'actually', 'refreshing', 'Yes', 'issue', 'was', 'had', 'positive', '*and*', 'negative', 'viewpoints', 'So', 'while', 'watching', 'DVD', 'viewer', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'bored', 'same', 'accolades', 'excellent', 'arrangements', 'listener', 'attention', 'duration', 'song', 'etc.', 'head-scratcher', 'fact', '_The', 'Lamb', 'Lies', 'Down', 'Broadway_', 'only', 'four', 'minutes', 'discussion', 'opposed', '10', 'minutes', 'other', 'album.All', 'diehard', 'Genesis', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'interesting', 'one', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'music', 'journalists', 'talk', 'albums', 'songs', 'performances', 'Gabriel', 'years', 'Genesis']",N/A
889153,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B0007TFIHO,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[0, 0]","This DVD as well as ""Genesis - The Gabriel Years DVD"" you may find in other sites can result disappointing to some. Granted that the information on it is accurate and the interviews with diverse music critics is useful, those looking for full-length rare live performances should look elsewhere. There are a handful of portions of live performances peppered with commentaries to enhance their value. However, this may result more valuable to modern rock and prog rock scholars and music students. Fans: this is not the DVD you are looking for. I give it three stars for its educational value, but the two lost stars are gone due to the slightly deceiving presentation.",3,Slightly deceiving: better for music students than for fans of the band,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,668,"['DVD', 'as', 'well', 'Genesis', 'Gabriel', 'Years', 'DVD', 'may', 'find', 'other', 'sites', 'can', 'result', 'disappointing', 'Granted', 'information', 'accurate', 'interviews', 'diverse', 'music', 'critics', 'useful', 'looking', 'full-length', 'rare', 'live', 'performances', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'handful', 'portions', 'live', 'performances', 'peppered', 'commentaries', 'enhance', 'value', 'However', 'may', 'result', 'more', 'valuable', 'modern', 'rock', 'prog', 'rock', 'scholars', 'music', 'students', 'Fans', 'not', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'educational', 'value', 'two', 'lost', 'stars', 'are', 'gone', 'due', 'slightly', 'deceiving', 'presentation']",N/A

There is a lot of good footage of Genesis in their early prime that makes the DVD worth owning only because (so far as I know) the shows used aren't available yet. The commentary is interesting to a point, but I would rather hear Iain Jennings talk about the music itself rather than listen to journalists and record producers give heartfelt, but vague appreciations of the songs and albums.Trespass, Nursery Crime, and Foxtrot get the main attention here, and for there part, done well, but two best Genesis works of the Gabriel era Selling England and surprisingly Lamb Lies Down are glossed over hurredly. I sensed that the filmmakers had used too much time at the beginning and discoved the had too little time at the end for the thorough appraisal both albums deserved.The Genesis Songbook, as noted by other reviewers, is the place to start.  Would that these filmmakers had lavished the attention on Genesis that they did on Uriah Heep.
