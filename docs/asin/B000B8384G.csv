On top of that, Reba learns that her married daughter isn't going to be moving out of the house with her new husband and baby daughter as planned. Now, with no breadwinner in the house, Reba realizes she'd rather accept a job working for her ex-husband than apply for food stamps.

As if the divorce was not enough to handle, Reba must also endure the issues that come with her eldest daughter who is pregnant and still in high school. While the situation would have most fall to their knees, Reba seems to be able to manage and make things work better than most. Barbara Jean, however, can make life very difficult and I am amazed at Reba's composure when dealing with this very absurd character. Season 1 is full of laughs along with Season 2.

937678,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B000B8384G,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","I admit it; not a fan of country music to a large degree, and blowing off Reba MacIntyre's show when it first aired, I caught up with it in syndication during it's last official season on the air.  I thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen upon a few viewings.  Then I began watching it for reasons I'm still not sure of and became a fan.Reba is not only funny with her smart mouth and take-no-crap attitude, but she has such a delightful roster of dysfunctional family victims to exercise target practice on.  She and Scarlet Pomers, who plays her equally mouthy daughter Kyra, have great writers constructing their clever lines.  The show is great in that it takes very real situations in life, and makes what most people don't laugh at in their own situations as great satire.  Brock, her ex-husband played by the handsome Christopher rich is a conceited, self-absorbed womanizer who is obsessed with golf and often times more idiotic than his son-in-law Van.Van the goofy and Reba's goofette daughter Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia) are parodies of the typical jocks and cheerleaders a lot of us used to hate and make fun of for picking on us.  The great thing about these two, however, is that once they get past their immaturity--which happens OCCASIONALLY--they are actually very loving, caring, and goodhearted.  Amazing what having a baby as teenagers can do to you...Kyra is wise-mouthed, rebellious, and resentful because of Brock and Reba's divorce, jealous of all the attention Cheyenne gets, and yet she takes stepmom Barbara Jean under her wing, becoming her friend.The youngest member of the family, Jake (Mitch Holliman) seems to be floating around and never really develops in any of the six seasons,so he might have been omitted as a character.What stands out most is Reba's twisted relationship with the whacky, Reba-obsessed Barbara Jean, played to perfection by Melissa Peterman.  The chemistry between the two of them is so tight and engrossing that you just know there wouldn't be a show without her.  You love Barbara Jean and she annoys you at the same time, making any scene she is in addictive as a train wreck.  Gotta love it!My favorite episodes are on season two, but my two favorites have to be when the family fights over a tape they make for baby Elizabeth and the one where Reba and Brock go to face her old boyfriend Terry, who Brock stole her from, only to find out he's died.  Very touching.Reba:  Season two is great fun and, though some things get a bit outragiously out of hand, the show strikes at the heart of its intended audience with a healthy combination of warmth, spunk, hilarity, and honesty about current situations.  I loved Reba as Annie Oakley in Buffalo Girls, and I love her cute, sassy personality on this show.  A great sitcom for laughs, it makes you wonder what you'd do in similar situations, and I recommend it highly.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[33, 34]","Reba's mad family returns in the second season of ""Reba,"" with the overstressed redhead overcoming the crises of the first season. Think things are going to get calmer? No way. Reba McIntyre continues to be funny, wonky and extraordinarily tolerant as the family madcappery continues.Last season ended with the birth of Reba's first grandchild. But she doesn't have time to relax, with Cheyenne and Van going off to college, only to have Van injure his knee and postpone school. So the new parents will be living with Grandma Reba awhile longer -- whether she likes it or not.Things get even more complex when Reba finds that she must get a job, for the first time in several years -- especially when she ends up working for her ex-husband's hated rival. And her old pal Lori Ann convinces her to try ""speed dating,"" which leads to a rather deceptive date with a nice guy. Problem is, she can't manage to say ""I love you.""And those are only a few of her problems: attractions to her daughter's boyfriend's dad, lonely Christmas Eves, private videotapes, Barbara Jean's maternal yearnings, an ex-boyfriend's death, self-defense courses, jealousy over the expensive gifts Van's parents are lavishing on baby Elizabeth... and whether Kyra will leave home to live with Brock.Perhaps no sitcom on TV embodies the fragmented extended family better than ""Reba"" -- ex-husband, new wife and her baby, ex-wife and her kids, ex-wife's daughter and her new husband and baby. And in the second season, ""Reba"" settles into a comfortable niche that builds on what we already have seen. High school is over, babies are born, couples are married. Let the chaos begin.There are some unrealistic twists. After treating Reba and Cheyenne like dirt, the cold-hearted, hard-drinking Montgomery Sr. suddenly goes all goopy over his grandchild and turns up at Reba's house to fawn over her? Nuh-uh. And the whole subplot about Reba's boyfriend never really goes anywhere, and fortunately ends quickly.Fortunately, most of them are all too real, such as Reba's anguish over her kids seeming to prefer Brock and Barbara Jean's more stable household. It's fun to see them all beating each other up at a self-defense course, insulting each other on a ""time capsule"" video, and dealing with weepy boyfriends. And the twisted family situations reach a peak with the rivalry between Brock and Barbara Jean's ex-boyfriend.Reba McIntyre continues the ""manic wise woman"" role that she had in the first season, but polishes the edges this time.  Melissa Peterman also gets even better, with a less pushy but still crazy Barbara Jean (who no longer talks about Jesus in every sentence). And fans of ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" will want to keep an eye out for James  Avery, playing (what else?) a sarcastic judge. ""Uncle Phil"" is the icing on the cake for one of the season's best episodes.Post-divorce dating, new parenthood, teen romance and workplace rivalry rule in the second season of ""Reba.""

Meanwhile, another blow struck as Reba discovered her 17-year-old daughter Cheyanne was also expecting.Now, the second year focuses upon teenage parents Cheyanne (Joanna Garcia) and Van (Steve Howey), who live in Reba's house with their baby daughter Elizabeth. The two are truly unequipped for the real world, and constantly come up against blows from the workforce and college.There's also little Henry, the son of Brock and Barbra Jean. While Reba would love to forget the very existence of the baby -- as well as his clueless, ditzy mother -- for some inane reason Barbra Jean is determined to become her new best friend.Meanwhile, Reba's youngest, Jake, is only eight; and smart, sarcastic middle child Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) acts out from the pressures of being the only sane person around.What's a woman to do? Most in Reba's situation would fall apart, but not her. Even when things are at their darkest, Reba's wit allows her to laugh and see the good -- though in no way is her character, or the show, sappy or sentimental. Rather, the imperfect Hart family strives to live each day to the fullest, making the best of each day however they can.Particularly memorable Season 2 episodes include ""A Moment in Time,"" where various family members end up quarreling over the things they reveal in a video they're making for baby Elizabeth; as well as Reba's first forays into dating; a more introspective look at Van's upbringing; and Kyra's increasing unhappiness with living in her mother's house.Give this show a try -- I guarantee you'll be hooked instantly!",5,Hilarious sitcom about an unlikely family...,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1714,"['Reba', 'McEntire', 'Reba', 'Hart', 'mother', 'three', 'husband', 'Brock', 'Christopher', 'Rich', 'recently', 'left', 'pregnant', 'dental', 'assistant', 'Meanwhile', 'blow', 'struck', 'Reba', 'discovered', '17-year-old', 'daughter', 'Cheyanne', 'was', 'also', 'expecting.Now', 'second', 'year', 'teenage', 'parents', 'Cheyanne', 'Joanna', 'Garcia', 'Van', 'Steve', 'Howey', 'who', 'live', 'Reba', 'house', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'two', 'are', 'truly', 'unequipped', 'real', 'world', 'constantly', 'come', 'up', 'blows', 'workforce', 'college.There', 'also', 'little', 'Henry', 'son', 'Brock', 'Barbra', 'Jean', 'Reba', 'would', 'love', 'forget', 'very', 'existence', 'baby', 'as', 'well', 'clueless', 'ditzy', 'mother', 'inane', 'reason', 'Barbra', 'Jean', 'determined', 'become', 'new', 'best', 'friend.Meanwhile', 'Reba', 'youngest', 'Jake', 'only', 'eight', 'smart', 'sarcastic', 'middle', 'child', 'Kyra', 'Scarlett', 'Pomers', 'out', 'pressures', 'being', 'only', 'sane', 'person', 'around.What', 'woman', 'do', 'Most', 'Reba', 'situation', 'would', 'fall', 'apart', 'not', 'Even', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'darkest', 'Reba', 'wit', 'laugh', 'see', 'good', 'way', 'character', 'show', 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'Rather', 'imperfect', 'Hart', 'family', 'strives', 'live', 'day', 'fullest', 'making', 'best', 'day', 'however', 'can.Particularly', 'memorable', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'include', 'Moment', 'Time', 'where', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'end', 'up', 'quarreling', 'things', 'reveal', 'video', ""'re"", 'making', 'baby', 'Elizabeth', 'as', 'well', 'Reba', 'first', 'forays', 'dating', 'more', 'introspective', 'look', 'Van', 'upbringing', 'Kyra', 'increasing', 'unhappiness', 'living', 'mother', 'house.Give', 'show', 'try', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'instantly']",Reba - Season 2

There's the question of whether Brock (Christopher Rich) and his new wife Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman) are giving youngest son Jake (Mitch Holleman) junk food.  Middle daughter Kyra (Scarletta Pomers) is entering those awkward teenage years, and becomes upset when Reba tries to date her new boyfriend's father.  And new teenage parents Cheyenne and Van (Joanna Garcia and Steve Howey) are dealing with college life and a new born.Reba finally has to face reality that she needs to get a job.  She even tries working for Brock before going to work for his arch rival (across the hall).  Van decides to buy Cheyenne a real ring.  And he gives up football for a year.  And Reba just tries to balance everyone in her life, including Barbra Jean who keeps attempting to worm her way into the new family dynamic.I must admit, this season has two episodes back to back I really don't love.  We get a little too much information on Reba's potential new love life in ""Ring-a-Ding.""  And ""Cookies for Santa"" has to be the saddest Christmas episode ever.On the other hand, it has some of the funniest moments in the series.  ""A Moment in Time"" features a video for Cheyenne and Van's daughter that doesn't go at all like anyone expected it to.  And ""Seeing Red"" provides wonderful laughs when Barbra Jean comes back from a makeover looking just like Reba.This season also really allowed the characters to grow into their own.  While there are plenty of laughs, the writers worked hard to flesh things out and make them into real people.While some serious stuff comes up, this show is still very funny.
