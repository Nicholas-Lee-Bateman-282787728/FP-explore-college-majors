It's a kick-butt horror-action-comedy that is fast-paced and fun with great characters and some humorous dialogue. It was almost as good as Zombie Strippers. The only thing it was missing was Robert England and Jenna Jameson. Also, there is a good bit of nudity in this movie. Three women appear topless. Zombies vs. Strippers is just a great zombie movie, possibly the best since Zombieland. And no I did not work on this movie, which I'm sure some people will accuse me of since I gave a 5 star review to a movie called Zombies vs. Strippers.

It is not a bad film, fairly average Full Moon styling.  The characters are decent and so is the acting.  The effects are also good.  Typical day at the office offering, but the movie didn't know if it wanted to be serious, scary, high action OR funny.  There are comical elements, as well as some pretty serious tone.  Mild action, mild dialogue - nothing bad, just you never got a feeling like it was trying to be scary or funny, just somewhere in between.  I think if they found the courage to pick a certain route, the movie could have been more than it is.  They played it safe.  You have blood, gore, nudity, zombies and action; it is all there in fairly equal amounts.This is a pretty good movie, worthy to watch or even buy.

1568807,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B008JZRFBK,S. Der,"[0, 1]","This movie has a lot of the old style gore with basic body props and no CGI effects. Not to say, I like CGI, no I don't care either way. And, I do admire the old use of props instead. So, if you like that style of filming than you should watch it.The zombies yell out brains a lot. There's the basic idea of being bite by a zombie will make you turn in this movie. There are a lot of slap stick humor in this one. I didn't really like the fact that every character seemed too stupid for their own good. It felt like they were all going to die because of their stupidity, and not really because of the horde of zombies. They really could had lived if they were smarter, but, I guess, that's a B movies for you. lolI also thought the strippers would be much prettier and sexier too, but they aren't.

There is just a little too much serious here and while they do try for funny and stupid the serious kind of ruins it.Not a bad movie, but not really a good movie either.I don't regret buying it.UPDATE!I wrote the part above while I was still watching the movie.
