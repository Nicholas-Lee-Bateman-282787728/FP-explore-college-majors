529821,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CXNF,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 7]","Are you familiar with concept of children's artwork?  While it is not the greatest Picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more.  If painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child.  Typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style.  You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles.  Well, this concept of children's artwork is how I felt about Fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait.  While on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see Fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments.  If you have seen either Training Day or King Arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait.  While Foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define Fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera.  Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why Fuqua's name appears on so many ""Best Of..."" film lists.I will never disagree with someone that Fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique.  His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking.  I am surprised that more of Hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon.  Even in the silly feature Bait, you are witness to Fuqua's greatness.  Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end.  In both of these scenes I saw the director Fuqua at work.  Alas, in the rest of this film, all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created.  The likeable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in Hollywood.  We have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are Charlie Kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel.  It is just impossible with this genre, and it is proven with Bait.  I was annoyed with Fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film.  I was just tired of the structure, and while I hoped that Fuqua would redefine it, he did not.Then, there was the acting.  While Jamie Foxx has never impressed me as an actor, I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try.  I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral.  I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that Foxx could handle the role in Collateral.  Again, I was disappointed.  Foxx was annoying.  Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither Fuqua nor Foxx took the time to fully train Foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot.  Instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of Foxx just trying to make the audience laugh.  Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second.  Fuqua should have stopped this immediately.  Foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of.  Instead of character development, he would crack a joke.  Neither style worked, no joke was funny.  The rest of the cast was average.  By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles.  They were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film.  They were pawns filling in dead air space.  Fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.Overall, this was a sad film.  With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand.  Foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese.  In each scene I saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues.  Are my words harsh?  I don't think so.  When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home.  Bait contained none of these.  While I will give Fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous.  Apparently, I took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble.Grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch)",2,"Listen guys, do I have to be around for this?",1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,4816,"['Are', 'familiar', 'concept', 'children', 'artwork', 'not', 'greatest', 'Picasso', 'three-year-old',

529836,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00003CXNF,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","When Jamie Foxx is on his game there's nobody better at the action/comedy/thriller. Admittedly, he's been more appreciated for his serious work - but I've always been a fan of the comedian, not the dramatist. It's a very select and small handful of actors that can switch gears on the fly. So many try - so few succeed.Without question Foxx is a standing member.This very enjoyable production has Foxx playing Alvin Sanders, an unsuccessful petty criminal who happens to share a prison cell with a guy who has a very big secret: Where $40 million  dollars in stolen federal gold is hidden. The twist here is that his cellmate stole all that precious metal from his former partner in crime. Unfortunately for Alvin, said former partner is a genuinely scary freak; a computer genius who also happens to be a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer. And said freak will stop at nothing until he gets his gold back. Absolutely nothing.Compounding Alvin's problems - a fierce federal officer, who has spent years tracking down the psycho, decides the best way to catch him is a trap. And that ""Mr. Jumbo Prawn"" is going to be the bait for the big bad wolf.Kudos to the many supporting actors who are top-notch in their respective roles: David Paymer, Nestor Serrano, and the always enjoyable goofy friend in Mike Epps.

The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie was suspect. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I dont see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story: Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasnt checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent....

But ""Bait"" has no tension that is generated from Denzel Washington's powerhouse acting.  Rather, this film is given more deadpan humors thanks to the star Jamie Foxx.Lots of gold kept in the federal reserve are stolen one day, and the burglar (and killer) leaves two dead bodies behind.  The criminal is a master of electronics, getting whatever information with his skills by himeself.  Government agent David Morse (Meg's hubby in ""Proof of Life"") is called in, and arrests the partner, who alone knows where the gold is concealed.Meanwhile, a small-time crook is arrested for stealing shrimps (or prawns ... whatever), and is kept in the same cell with another guy, who happens to be the one with the key information about the gold robbery.  And you know, they seem to be talking about something, something about the clues of the place where gold can be found.  The agent team now think of a great plan: to use this fall guy Foxx as a bait, with which they can lure the master of the crime, and get the gold back again.With high-tech devices secretly set in the jaw, the agents follows Foxx, who, ignorant of the fact, walks and talks.  This is the best moment of the film, when Foxx tries to woo his former love again, not knowing  all the conversations of him are monitored and listened, and even being discussed among the agents.However, as to its actions, there is little to be recommended.  Though shot with stylish images, the film offers nothing new or original as far as thrills are concerned.  And to make matters worse, the most original device used to raise the tension of the film, which comes at the end of the film, just looks contrived (and some might call nasty).Neither funny enough, nor thriling enough, ""Bait"" is memorable only with Jamie Foxx's knacks for portraying likable fellow.
