This is to the consternation of her husband Hugh (Michael Pennington). Her father Haverford Downs (John Gielgud) catches Hugh in a compromising position and forces his way into their summer vacation in exchange for being discrete.Molly liked to read Sherlock Holmes as a child and immediately sees mystery and intrigue. She must solve problems such as missing water and a missing landlord.Everyone looks creepy including Molly's family. Old friends turn up. New friends are made. They all seem creepy too.I suggest that this is one program that you don't want to be spending your time anticipating what the problem is or you will miss what the problem is. I spent too much time trying to figure out why they all felt like puppets being manipulated and tried to figure out who the bad guys are to the expense of not realizing that everything was straightforward in this miniseries of only four episodes.John Gielgud received an Emmy award for being the lecherous old fart. You may well suspect that he plays a part in the mysteries.The character of Molly can be really irksome at times as she goes where no woman would go and asks questions that no one would ask; worst of all she puts herself in positions where she should've been dispatched long ago.The music is much louder than the background dialog and does not really match the theme of the story.I have to confess that I have not read the book at the time of this review.I am told that the book does a better job of wrapping up loose ends.The beautiful countryside is almost worth the series just to see it.,4,I'm not sure what to think,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1685,"['Molly', 'Praetor', 'Susan', 'Fleetwood', 'mother', 'three', 'girls', 'located', 'Italian', 'Villa', 'Tuscany', 'lease', 'summer', 'consternation', 'husband', 'Hugh', 'Michael', 'Pennington', 'father', 'Haverford', 'Downs', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Hugh', 'compromising', 'position', 'forces', 'way', 'summer', 'vacation', 'exchange', 'being', 'discrete.Molly', 'liked', 'read', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'child', 'immediately', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'must', 'solve', 'problems', 'such', 'missing', 'water', 'missing', 'landlord.Everyone', 'creepy', 'including', 'Molly', 'family', 'Old', 'turn', 'up', 'New', 'friends', 'are', 'made', 'seem', 'creepy', 'too.I', 'suggest', 'one', 'program', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spending', 'time', 'anticipating', 'what', 'problem', 'will', 'miss', 'what', 'problem', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'felt', 'puppets', 'being', 'manipulated', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'expense', 'not', 'realizing', 'everything', 'was', 'straightforward', 'miniseries', 'only', 'four', 'episodes.John', 'Gielgud', 'received', 'Emmy', 'award', 'being', 'lecherous', 'old', 'fart', 'may', 'well', 'suspect', 'part', 'mysteries.The', 'character', 'Molly', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'irksome', 'times', 'where', 'woman', 'would', 'go', 'asks', 'questions', 'one', 'would', 'ask', 'worst', 'positions', 'where', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dispatched', 'long', 'ago.The', 'music', 'much', 'louder', 'background', 'dialog', 'not', 'really', 'match', 'theme', 'story.I', 'have', 'confess', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'time', 'review.I', 'am', 'told', 'book', 'better', 'job', 'wrapping', 'up', 'loose', 'ends.The', 'beautiful', 'countryside', 'almost', 'series', 'just', 'see']",N/A

L'hoir,"[13, 13]","Although I am still not certain who did what to whom and why, I nevertheless enjoyed a second watching of John Mortimer's mystery, ""Summer's Lease,"" which I saw when it was first broadcast on PBS. ""Summer's Lease"" is John Gielgud's show. It does not matter how old he is; he still steals every scene as the outrageously libidinous old pirate of a father to Molly(coddle) Pargeter, a repressed 40-something wife and mother, who cannot help being embarrassed by his unrepentant tales of jolly ""rogering"", which he will tell to anyone, anywhere, and at any time, no matter how inappropriate the occasion. Mortimer has given Gielgud some of his best lines; one of my favorites is his apology for being a poor excuse for a socialist in a capitalist world: ""Until we've got the red flag flying, we've got to live with the rat race!""Among the delights of this series are the magnificent locations of Umbria and Tuscany, renamed Chiantishire by the British expatriate characters, since so many of them live there. As a former resident of Italy, I reveled at the sight of the cypress-dotted hills and at the sound  of so many birds chirping (now a rarity in my part of California). Watching this series is equivalent to going on a vicarious vacation to some of the most stunning parts of Italy; and to put the panna on top of the gelato, as it were, we are treated to the magnificent frescoes of Piero della Francesca.As for the mystery, it is suspenseful, as all of Mortimer's mysteries are. If it leaves us rather unsatisfied because it does not tie up all the loose ends, it nevertheless makes us think about what actually might have happened. The body in the swimming pool is a reality, but are the contessa and the British residents as sinister as they seem? Or are we, the viewers, merely seeing them through the eyes of Molly, not only a stranger in a strange land, but also a woman whose emotions are raw due to the strains put on her marriage by her philandering husband? Are we perhaps influenced by Molly's misinterpretation of her surroundings? Such a scenario renders Molly's blunderings and their catastrophic results the more convincing.My only complaint is with Acorn Media, who, as usual, provides no subtitles that would aid those unused to British accents, or extras, other than a filmography of the actors that is difficult to read on a thirteen-inch screen (but perhaps it is more intelligible to those with a larger screen). Nevertheless, if you love Italy and enjoy John Mortimer, buy this DVD (but you might want to check out the ""used and new"" category on Amazon, because, as I discovered by accident, there are many new copies, straight from the manufacturer, at a much lower price, even with the $2.98 shipping and handling fees).",5,Hoist the Jolly Roger!,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,2748,"['am', 'still', 'not', 'certain', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'whom', 'why', 'nevertheless', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'watching', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'mystery', 'Summer', 'Lease', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'PBS', 'Summer', 'Lease', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'show', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'still', 'scene', 'outrageously', 'libidinous', 'old', 'pirate', 'father', 'Molly', 'coddle', 'Pargeter', 'repressed', '40-something', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'unrepentant', 'tales', 'jolly', 'rogering', 'will', 'tell', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'time', 'matter', 'how', 'inappropriate', 'occasion', 'Mortimer', 'given', 'Gielgud', 'best', 'lines', 'one', 'favorites', 'apology', 'being', 'poor', 'excuse', 'socialist', 'capitalist', 'world', ""'ve"", 'got', 'red', 'flag', 'flying', ""'ve"", 'got', 'live', 'rat', 'race', 'delights', 'series', 'are', 'magnificent', 'locations', 'Umbria', 'Tuscany', 'renamed', 'Chiantishire', 'British', 'expatriate', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'live', 'there', 'former', 'resident', 'Italy', 'reveled', 'sight', 'cypress-dotted', 'hills', 'sound', 'so', 'many', 'birds', 'chirping', 'now', 'rarity', 'part', 'California', 'Watching', 'series', 'equivalent', 'going', 'vicarious', 'vacation', 'most', 'stunning', 'parts', 'Italy', 'put', 'panna', 'top', 'gelato', 'were', 'are', 'treated', 'magnificent', 'frescoes', 'Piero', 'della', 'Francesca.As', 'mystery', 'suspenseful', 'Mortimer', 'mysteries', 'are', 'rather', 'unsatisfied', 'not', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'nevertheless', 'think', 'what', 'actually', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'body', 'swimming', 'pool', 'reality', 'are', 'contessa', 'British', 'residents', 'as', 'sinister', 'seem', 'are', 'viewers', 'merely', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'Molly', 'not', 'only', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'also', 'woman', 'emotions', 'are', 'raw', 'due', 'strains', 'put', 'marriage', 'philandering', 'husband', 'Are', 'perhaps', 'influenced', 'Molly', 'misinterpretation', 'surroundings', 'scenario', 'Molly', 'blunderings', 'catastrophic', 'results', 'more', 'convincing.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'who', 'usual', 'subtitles', 'would', 'aid', 'unused', 'British', 'accents', 'extras', 'other', 'filmography', 'actors', 'difficult', 'read', 'thirteen-inch', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'more', 'intelligible', 'larger', 'screen', 'Nevertheless', 'love', 'Italy', 'enjoy', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'buy', 'DVD', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'used', 'new', 'category', 'Amazon', 'because', 'discovered', 'accident', 'are', 'many', 'new', 'copies', 'straight', 'manufacturer', 'much', 'lower', 'price', 'even', '2.98', 'shipping', 'handling', 'fees']",N/A

I bought a ""Summer's Lease"" thinking that I was getting yet another great English Murder/Mystery-after all Sir.  John Gielgud had a leading role!  WHAT could be better than that?  I'm sorry to report that I was very disappointed in this entire presentation.  The whole thing seemed very dated and unappealing to me.  I think mainly because there wasn't one character I ended up caring one iota for; I didn't like one character NOT  even  the one portrayed by Sir John Gielgud.Everyone on this board found Sir John's character enduring.  I just found his character to be an annoying old feeble fart.  My true feeling is that, at the time this was filmed, I'm afraid that (even as great of an actor as he was) Sir John was far too old to be playing this lecherous old man.  He flubs many lines and is very hard to understand in many of the scenes.  I've always found Sir John to be a marvelous actor; however NOT in this enterprise!  Nevertheless, I found Molly as played by Susan Fleetwood to be the most irritating of all the characters.For the entire film, Susan Fleetwood walks around, as Molly, with the stupidest grin on her face-at one point all I wanted to do was to  slap her and to ask her if she was that stupid or just pretending to be that stupid? To me, she made the character of Molly just an annoying ""harpy"".All of the reviews have talked of the gorgeous Italian scenery in the film. I'm afraid that the picture is so fuzzy that the scenery was hard to appreciate reflective, I'm sure of the technology of the day-it really look dated!

Cofield,"[25, 25]","Summer's Lease is a nicely done mystery series produced in the 1980s by the writer/playwright John Mortimer based on his novel of the same name.  Mollie Pargeter is a forty-something London housewife who rents an Italian villa for the summer holidays. Neither her barrister husband (who is conducting a semi-respectable flirtation with a former client) nor her three daughters are very enthusiastic, but Mollie insists and they all wind up in Tuscany at the Villa ""La Felicita,"" along with Mollie's father Haverford Downs, an ancient roue who writes a column for a magazine.Immediately mysteries crop up.  A host of eccentric characters appear, all of them cagey about the whereabouts of the owners of the villa, who are nowhere in evidence beyond some odd instructions,  pictures, and lists.  The water supply is shut off and the swimming pool become a murder site. And what is the significance of all the references to Piero della Francesca, especially his painting of ""The Flagellation?"" Mollie is fascinated by it all, and stoked by her rereading of Sherlock Holmes' ""The Copper Beeches,"" begins to investigate. Eventually she discovers the truth, not just about ""La Felicita"" but about herself and her marriage as well.The mystery is complex and takes some time to unwind, and in typical British fashion much is left for one to ponder and work out on one's own.  The scenery is gorgeous (especially the scenes of the Palio in Siena) and most of the characters appealing, and the outcome, while sad and somewhat equivocal, is satisfying and leaves one happy for Mollie.",5,A Fine Mystery For Anglophiles And Italophiles,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,1573,"['Summer', 'Lease', 'nicely', 'done', 'mystery', 'series', 'produced', '1980s', 'writer/playwright', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Mollie', 'Pargeter', 'forty-something', 'London', 'housewife', 'who', 'Italian', 'villa', 'summer', 'holidays', 'barrister', 'husband', 'who', 'conducting', 'semi-respectable', 'flirtation', 'former', 'client', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'Mollie', 'insists', 'wind', 'up', 'Tuscany', 'Villa', 'La', 'Felicita', 'Mollie', 'father', 'Haverford', 'Downs', 'ancient', 'roue', 'who', 'column', 'magazine.Immediately', 'mysteries', 'crop', 'up', 'host', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'appear', 'cagey', 'whereabouts', 'owners', 'villa', 'who', 'are', 'nowhere', 'evidence', 'odd', 'instructions', 'pictures', 'lists', 'water', 'supply', 'shut', 'off', 'swimming', 'pool', 'become', 'murder', 'site', 'what', 'significance', 'references', 'Piero', 'della', 'Francesca', 'especially', 'painting', 'Flagellation', 'Mollie', 'fascinated', 'stoked', 'rereading', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Copper', 'Beeches', 'investigate', 'Eventually', 'truth', 'not', 'just', 'La', 'Felicita', 'marriage', 'well.The', 'mystery', 'complex', 'time', 'unwind', 'typical', 'British', 'fashion', 'much', 'left', 'one', 'ponder', 'work', 'out', 'one', 'own', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Palio', 'Siena', 'most', 'characters', 'appealing', 'outcome', 'sad', 'somewhat', 'equivocal', 'satisfying', 'one', 'happy', 'Mollie']",N/A

(Another example of a remarkable performance by an aged actor is that of Sir Lawrence Olivier in ""The Ebony Tower,"" adapted from the novel by John Fowles.)In other reviews, Susan Fleetwood's characterization of Molly Pargeter comes in for some harsh criticism.

She is a good-hearted woman whose dreamy demeanor is a defense against her charming but bullying father, her silly, ineffectual husband and her intelligent, somewhat boisterous children.  Molly's  interior life interests her more than her real life; thus her determination to ferret out the myterious owner of the family's rented villa by following clues along the Piero della Francesca ""trail.""Summer's Lease is good fun for those who do not expect a high-powered, predictable mystery with a neatly wrapped ending but are happy to settle for quirky British characters in a lovely Tuscan setting.

903915,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B0009E27EE,Richard B. Schwartz,"[2, 4]","I'm not quite sure what this is--fish or fowl?  At moments it seems like a chick flick; at other moments it seems like an English mystery; at others there are even tones of horror.  There is a long tradition of Brits-in-Italy stories in which the stuffy/repressed Brit comes to life in the presence of Italian passion/chaos.  There is a touch of that here, but it is colored by the protagonist's suspicion of her husband's adultery and her suspicions about the strange figures she encounters, one of whom summarily dies, with his brains leaking onto the floor of an emptied swimming pool.  One of the protagonist's daughters is asked to clear a drain in a stopped up, claustrophobic well.  We expect to find something horrible there, but there's nothing.  Along with murder there's a preposterous scam to force the British renters to pay high fees to the water commission when their water is unexpectedly shut off.  Finally, there's the protagonist's father--played by Gielgud--a sex-obsessed, duplicitous charmer who, e.g., talks the family into a dentist's apartment above the square in which the Palio is held.  There's a lot of Italy here, and some mystery and some good performances but it doesn't congeal, even though the writer is John Mortimer (of Rumpole fame).  I have clear expectations with regard to genre and here they were not met.  I'm prepared to be surprised and tricked, but this was more of a muddle than a daring experiment.  Note that the protagonist, the late Susan Fleetwood, is Mick's younger sister--she played Lady Russell in the Amanda Root Persuasion, a fine actress.

Summer's Lease shows only minor variations from the text and is an outstanding example for Americans of the British ""holiday"" in southern Europe with some mystery and comedy thrown in.

So now you have a big clue that this video will be clever, interesting, worldly. John Geilgud's character is a reporter who writes rude articles and cons his way into various situations he can't afford by guile. There are a number of compelling other players too. There are beautiful Italian panoramas, city scenes, villa scenes. Interesting Italians too. Various British types. Not typical. An interesting story which unfolds and develops in a pleasant manner. It is also a time capsule of the 1990s. This is before the world went mad with paranoia. I had borrowed this video from the library, and it is so charming I had to have my own copy. If you like Rumpole, you will love this story. It is actually a sort of mystery. But the entertainment is in the characters interplay. Not a single gunshot in the whole story!
