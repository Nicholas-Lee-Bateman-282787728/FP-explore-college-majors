261897,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,6301674677,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[4, 18]","Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda, Jimmy Smits, are politically left of center.  Their involvement in the filming of leftist novelist Carlos Fuentes' ""Old Gringo"" almost certainly expresses their own infatuation with radical politics.  How tragic.  This film is nothing more than a romanticization of a failure.  Do you want to know why Mexico is today a poverty stricken nation?  Why so many of its citizens desperately desire to escape to the United States?  Much of this has to do with the murderous activities of Pancho Villa and other so-called revolutionaries in the early part of the twentieth Century.  They left the Mexicans unable to form a viable government.  The rule of law was rejected in favor of revolutionary dictators claiming to represent the wishes of the common folk.  Gregory Peck portrays Ambrose Bierce who naively considered Villa to be another George Washington.  What can I add concerning the infamous Ms. Fonda?  She has, in real life, even praised Communism.  In this particular role as Harriet Winslow, Fonda is far too old.  Another reviewer correctly pointed out that she looks every bit of her fifty one years---and the part calls for a woman who is much younger.  Fonda could literally be Jimmy Smits' (Gen. Tomas Arroyo) mother.  I was unable to take seriously their romance.Ambrose Bierce is trying to make sense of his long life before passing onto the great unknown.  The spinster Harriet Winslow is an existential mess.  She is a true believer type easily seduced by the utopian fantasies of a better world---which usually end up causing substantially more misery in the real one.  Bierce is trying to get the trigger happy Arroyo to kill him.  Will he succeed?  Should we care?  The answer: we should not.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness.",3,The Romanticization of Failure,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1770,"['Gregory', 'Peck', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'are', 'politically', 'left', 'center', 'involvement', 'filming', 'leftist', 'novelist', 'Carlos', 'Fuentes', 'Old', 'Gringo', 'almost', 'certainly', 'own', 'infatuation', 'radical', 'politics', 'How', 'tragic', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'romanticization', 'failure', 'Do', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'Mexico', 'today', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'nation', 'Why', 'so', 'many', 'citizens', 'desperately', 'desire', 'escape', 'United', 'States', 'Much', 'do', 'murderous', 'activities', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'other', 'so-called', 'revolutionaries', 'early', 'part', 'twentieth', 'Century', 'left', 'Mexicans', 'unable', 'form', 'viable', 'government', 'rule', 'law', 'was', 'rejected', 'favor', 'revolutionary', 'dictators', 'claiming', 'represent', 'wishes', 'common', 'folk', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'who', 'naively', 'considered', 'Villa', 'be', 'George', 'Washington', 'What', 'can', 'add', 'concerning', 'infamous', 'Ms.', 'Fonda', 'real', 'life', 'even', 'praised', 'Communism', 'particular', 'role', 'Harriet', 'Winslow', 'Fonda', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'reviewer', 'correctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'bit', 'fifty', 'one', 'years', '-and', 'part', 'woman', 'who', 'much', 'younger', 'Fonda', 'could', 'literally', 'be', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Gen.', 'Tomas', 'Arroyo', 'mother', 'was', 'unable', 'take', 'seriously', 'romance.Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'long', 'life', 'passing', 'great', 'unknown', 'spinster', 'Harriet', 'Winslow', 'existential', 'mess', 'true', 'believer', 'type', 'easily', 'seduced', 'utopian', 'fantasies', 'better', 'world', '-which', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'causing', 'substantially', 'more', 'misery', 'real', 'one', 'Bierce', 'trying', 'get', 'trigger', 'happy', 'Arroyo', 'kill', 'Will', 'succeed', 'Should', 'care', 'answer', 'should', 'not.David', 'ThomsonFlares', 'Darkness']",N/A
261898,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,6301674677,Donegal Dan,"[29, 30]","This movie was a surprise to me and a pleasant one and I would actually rate it four and a half stars.  While I have never read the book on which it is based, I found it a haunting and memorable work of art in itself.  The figure of Ambrose Bierce, as played by Gregory Peck, is quite fascinating but unless you are familiar with the writer (and even if you are)you may find the characterization rather hard to comprehend.  However, Peck's performance is strong enough to carry you along despite this and his interaction with the other two characters--the frustrated spinster, played beautifully by Fonda, and the volatile and sexy rebel general played equally well by Smits--is totally engrossing.  The love triangle, which seemed more of a father-daughter-lover relationship, could have been fleshed out more but was still pretty riveting.  However, the real pull of the film is the beauty of the cinematography in battle scenes, love scenes and interiors, equally; the passion and brutality of the revolutionaries and at the same time their humanity, and the connection between the rather wildly different three central characters based on that humanity and despite the brutality, all during an epic era in the history of Mexico. I have watched this film several times now and each time I find new reasons to admire it, not the least of which is that it is just a wonderful story about characters who are electric, vibrant and mesmerizing in their search for meaning in their lives.

261899,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301674677,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 9]","Argentinean director Luis Puenzo seems like a smart choice to helm this epic drama since his specialty seems to be offering probing character studies in the face of larger sociopolitical issues. But this 1989 movie falls short of expectations, especially if you've read Carlos Fuentes' 1985 novel upon which this movie is based. All the elements for success seem present - a fascinating historical setting (the Mexican Revolution); rather flamboyant characters (both fictitious and fictionalized); explosive battle scenes; dramatic executions; and a romantic triangle with gauzy love scenes. Indeed, the problem is that the elements don't quite add up to a cohesive whole that induces any heartfelt passion. Set in 1913, the story focuses on an American spinster named Harriet Winslow, who has been hired to be a governess for a wealthy Mexican family on their grand hacienda. The beginning of the story shows great promise as the period detail is vivid, and the set-up of the characters promises some intriguing interactions. However, when the three primary characters come together on the hacienda, the plot seems to narrow in scope, and the story's initial gallop slows to a cant until the conclusion.I was afraid that at 51, Jane Fonda would be at least a decade too old to play Harriet, but she actually looks right most of the time, slightly worn but constantly engaged with the swirl of activities around her. However, with a stellar career spanning three decades, she just doesn't surprise with this performance (unlike, say, her alcoholic has-been actress in 1986's ""The Morning After""), and after one more film, she retired from the big screen for the next fifteen years. Granted she is playing an uptight woman on the verge of a political and sexual awakening, she just comes across as too mannered and frankly too wizened to draw the carnal attentions of two completely different men. On the other hand, it's a joy to see the relish with which Gregory Peck plays Ambrose Bierce, the real American journalist who disappeared into Mexico at this time. His charisma intact, he makes palatable his romantic overtures to Harriet and brings a realistic blend of gusto and frailty to his constant philosophizing and his slow march toward death. As the virulent General Arroyo, one of Pancho Villa's men, Jimmy Smits has to maintain a delicate balancing act between quick-tempered, violent revolutionary and smitten romantic hero. He succeeds up to a point, especially in expressing his obsession with past injustices through firepower, but there is little chemistry between him and Fonda, which leaves the ending scenes oddly hollow. The one exception is the firing squad scene, which is sufficiently shocking. The film is not a complete misfire, but given its interesting mix of historical fact and fiction, I wish it was much more than it is, even though in Peck's case, it is.",3,Unlikely Romantic Triangle Set in Pancho Villa's Mexico,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,2884,"['Argentinean', 'director', 'Luis', 'Puenzo', 'smart', 'choice', 'helm', 'epic', 'drama', 'specialty', 'be', 'offering', 'probing', 'character', 'studies', 'face', 'larger', 'sociopolitical', 'issues', '1989', 'movie', 'short', 'expectations', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Carlos', 'Fuentes', '1985', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'elements', 'success', 'seem', 'present', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'setting', 'Mexican', 'Revolution', 'rather', 'flamboyant', 'characters', 'fictitious', 'fictionalized', 'explosive', 'battle', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'executions', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'gauzy', 'love', 'scenes', 'Indeed', 'problem', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'heartfelt', 'passion', 'Set', '1913', 'story', 'American', 'spinster', 'named', 'Harriet', 'Winslow', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'be', 'governess', 'wealthy', 'Mexican', 'family', 'grand', 'hacienda', 'beginning', 'story', 'great', 'promise', 'period', 'detail', 'vivid', 'set-up', 'characters', 'intriguing', 'interactions', 'However', 'when', 'three', 'primary', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'hacienda', 'plot', 'narrow', 'scope', 'story', 'initial', 'gallop', 'cant', 'conclusion.I', 'was', 'afraid', '51', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'decade', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Harriet', 'actually', 'right', 'most', 'time', 'slightly', 'worn', 'constantly', 'engaged', 'swirl', 'activities', 'However', 'stellar', 'career', 'spanning', 'three', 'decades', 'just', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'performance', 'say', 'alcoholic', 'has-been', 'actress', '1986', 'Morning', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'retired', 'big', 'screen', 'next', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Granted', 'playing', 'uptight', 'woman', 'verge', 'political', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'just', 'across', 'too', 'mannered', 'frankly', 'too', 'wizened', 'draw', 'carnal', 'attentions', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'men', 'other', 'hand', 'joy', 'see', 'relish', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'real', 'American', 'journalist', 'who', 'disappeared', 'Mexico', 'time', 'charisma', 'intact', 'palatable', 'romantic', 'overtures', 'Harriet', 'realistic', 'blend', 'gusto', 'frailty', 'constant', 'philosophizing', 'slow', 'march', 'death', 'virulent', 'General', 'Arroyo', 'one', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'men', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'maintain', 'delicate', 'balancing', 'act', 'quick-tempered', 'violent', 'revolutionary', 'smitten', 'romantic', 'hero', 'up', 'point', 'especially', 'expressing', 'obsession', 'past', 'injustices', 'firepower', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Fonda', 'ending', 'scenes', 'oddly', 'hollow', 'one', 'exception', 'firing', 'squad', 'scene', 'sufficiently', 'shocking', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'misfire', 'given', 'interesting', 'mix', 'historical', 'fact', 'fiction', 'wish', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'even', 'Peck', 'case']",N/A

Although portrayed as cantakerous and feisty and even mean-spirited in the movie, Bierce apparently had a soft spot for the idea of a grass-roots Mexican revolution, and left the U.S. to throw his lot as well as his not inconsiderable reputation behind it.After that, nothing is known about what became of Bierce, although the movie presents one theory about how he may have died, by getting involved with a tragic love triangle between a beautiful but estranged American woman (played by Jane Fonda), and a young Mexican general fighting for the revolution, played by Jimmy Smits.

261908,A1DZSBTVCJ883,6301674677,W. Walker,"[1, 1]","At one level, this film focuses on the much delayed coming of age adventure for Jane Fonda's character, Harriet Winslow, who suddenly decides she has had enough of her mother-dominated spinster school marm life. Yes, we would expect her to be maybe 10-20 years younger than Fonda's 50 years. However, her relatively advanced age makes her crush on Peck's 70 year old character, Ambrose Bierce, more believable. Peck's characterization of Bierce is somewhat at odds with what I have read of this man. We get the impression that, like Harriet,  he has forsaken his bookish life, as a sick old man, for a final hands-on adventure, as an aid to the rebels of the Mexican revolution. However, the real Bierce fought in the Civil War and later crossed the continent on another mission. He was not a one-dimensional bookish writer, by experience.Fonda simultaneously develops crushes on both Bierce and General Arroyo(Jimmy Smits). They are both seen as romantic rebels, though of very different sorts and for different reasons. Harriet reminds Bierce of his daughter, whom he hasn't seen for many years, while Bierce reminds Harriet of her father, who abandoned his domineering wife for a new love, and who fought in the Spanish American War to free Cuba. But after partially destroying the Miranda mansion, where he was conceived, Arroyo delays taking his troops to join Villa's, as ordered. Arroyo's bedding of Harriet on the very bed where he was conceived symbolically reverses the power relationship in which his european father raped his native american mother. He finds the original spanish land grant papers giving the land of this hacienda to the peasants. Since Spain no longer governed Mexico, these papers were not necessarily valid, as Bierce points out, but Arroyo refuses to heed. Arroyo's shootings of his favorite horse and of Bierceemphasize his determination to stay at the hacienda instead of joining Villa.There are several references accusing Arroyo of having become the new Miranda, and thus betraying the revolution. I don't understand why Arroyo had one of his soldiers shot for doing exactly what he was doing. He must have known he would receive the same sentence if he did not soon join Villa. Perhaps this symbolizes the near universal tendency of revolutionary leaders to gradually become tyrants as bad or worse than those they topple. So it had been with Porfirio Diaz, the once revolutionary general the revolutionists now fought against. So it would be with various successors to Diaz during these turbulent times.This is an entertaining film, for the most part. There are enough action scenes to complement the philosophizing and other tamer scenes. You will have to pay close attention or see it several times to catch all the symbolism. I can see why this film was important to Jane Fonda. It is, in a sense, autobiographical, symbolizing her mid-life transformation from an apolitical sex kitten into an anti-establishment political spokeswoman for the powerless of the world.",5,"The Old Maid, the Old Gringo and the Young Revolutionary",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3008,"['one', 'level', 'film', 'much', 'delayed', 'coming', 'age', 'adventure', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'character', 'Harriet', 'Winslow', 'who', 'suddenly', 'had', 'enough', 'mother-dominated', 'spinster', 'school', 'marm', 'life', 'Yes', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'maybe', '10-20', 'years', 'younger', 'Fonda', '50', 'years', 'However', 'relatively', 'advanced', 'age', 'crush', 'Peck', '70', 'year', 'old', 'character', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'more', 'believable', 'Peck', 'characterization', 'Bierce', 'somewhat', 'odds', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'man', 'get', 'impression', 'Harriet', 'forsaken', 'bookish', 'life', 'sick', 'old', 'man', 'final', 'hands-on', 'adventure', 'aid', 'rebels', 'Mexican', 'revolution', 'However', 'real', 'Bierce', 'fought', 'Civil', 'War', 'later', 'crossed', 'continent', 'mission', 'was', 'not', 'one-dimensional', 'bookish', 'writer', 'experience.Fonda', 'simultaneously', 'crushes', 'Bierce', 'General', 'Arroyo', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'are', 'seen', 'romantic', 'rebels', 'very', 'different', 'sorts', 'different', 'reasons', 'Harriet', 'Bierce', 'daughter', 'whom', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'Bierce', 'Harriet', 'father', 'who', 'abandoned', 'domineering', 'wife', 'new', 'love', 'who', 'fought', 'Spanish', 'American', 'War', 'free', 'Cuba', 'partially', 'destroying', 'Miranda', 'mansion', 'where', 'was', 'conceived', 'Arroyo', 'taking', 'troops', 'join', 'Villa', 'ordered', 'Arroyo', 'bedding', 'Harriet', 'very', 'bed', 'where', 'was', 'conceived', 'symbolically', 'power', 'relationship', 'european', 'father', 'raped', 'native', 'american', 'mother', 'original', 'spanish', 'land', 'grant', 'papers', 'giving', 'land', 'hacienda', 'peasants', 'Spain', 'no', 'longer', 'governed', 'Mexico', 'papers', 'were', 'not', 'necessarily', 'valid', 'Bierce', 'out', 'Arroyo', 'heed', 'Arroyo', 'shootings', 'favorite', 'horse', 'Bierceemphasize', 'determination', 'stay', 'hacienda', 'instead', 'joining', 'Villa.There', 'are', 'several', 'references', 'accusing', 'Arroyo', 'having', 'become', 'new', 'Miranda', 'thus', 'betraying', 'revolution', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Arroyo', 'had', 'one', 'soldiers', 'shot', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'receive', 'same', 'sentence', 'did', 'not', 'soon', 'join', 'Villa', 'Perhaps', 'near', 'universal', 'tendency', 'revolutionary', 'leaders', 'gradually', 'become', 'tyrants', 'bad', 'worse', 'topple', 'had', 'been', 'Porfirio', 'Diaz', 'once', 'revolutionary', 'general', 'revolutionists', 'now', 'fought', 'would', 'be', 'various', 'successors', 'Diaz', 'turbulent', 'times.This', 'entertaining', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'enough', 'action', 'scenes', 'complement', 'philosophizing', 'other', 'tamer', 'scenes', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'see', 'several', 'times', 'catch', 'symbolism', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'important', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'sense', 'autobiographical', 'symbolizing', 'mid-life', 'transformation', 'apolitical', 'sex', 'kitten', 'anti-establishment', 'political', 'spokeswoman', 'powerless', 'world']",N/A
