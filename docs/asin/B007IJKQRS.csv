It is an effective time-passer movie, but something you won't watch again and here is why. To me, the movie appeared quickly made without much story/character developments and details, yet it was quite haunting and tense (something similar you note in Born Identity). What made it look really shallow - is unconvincing police behavior and the culmination when Jill faces the serial killer. For latter, one hour of tense wait time just to end up with this 5-second culmination scene? Excuse me, I know everyone is busy running, but making this the most important part of the movie like literally 5 seconds long - must be a joke! I agree it is interesting to demonstrate how bits by bits, clue by clue, Jill has been discovering the identity of the killer, but, to me that was supposed to precede the grand finale, which I didn't really see in Gone.

As introduced to us, her accomplishments include easily beating up a fit-and-trim man in her self-defense class, and outsmarting every single person she encounters throughout this film (usually by lying cleverly), including a bevy of mostly male Portand police detectives.
