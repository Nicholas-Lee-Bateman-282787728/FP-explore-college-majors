Every once in a while he breaks out into some horrible catterwailing that is I suppose singing by someone's standard. It's so bad it hurts. He has a horrible voice.

It's like they didn't even try to make their characters look decent. I really hate that everyone who does kids' movies thinks they need to throw in songs, especially when the music is as shoddy as the animation. The story and dialogue itself isn't bad. The cover art is deceptive, making it look a whole lot better than it is; they took more time with their contours, coloring and shading. You'd think that it would be a better quality with Charleton Heston presenting it.",2,Cheap animation,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,541,"['agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'animation', 'horrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'make', 'characters', 'look', 'decent', 'really', 'hate', 'everyone', 'who', 'kids', 'movies', 'need', 'throw', 'songs', 'especially', 'when', 'music', 'as', 'shoddy', 'animation', 'story', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'bad', 'cover', 'art', 'deceptive', 'making', 'look', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'took', 'more', 'time', 'contours', 'coloring', 'shading', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'quality', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'presenting']",Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible: The  Nativity
