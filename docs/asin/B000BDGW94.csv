Anyway, being a fan of only 1 ""reality"" show (this one), and having originally caught race 7 in the middle during GSN's rerun while I was buying race 1 on disc, I didn't understand all the hype about Rob and Amber except that they previously appeared on CBS' other popular show of this type; Survivor.  But after watching all of episode 1 uncut on disc 1 and adding the opening segment after the credits of episode 2, I can definitely sympathize with all the other fans and the other contestants as well. So yes, a good race, but Rob and Amber should gotten the shaft sooner.  What really gets me about them, besides their revamped John McGraw attitude (winning at all cost) is that CBS actually allowed them to sign up and get on the show after winning their other ""popular"" series only what a year or 2 ago?  Hey, I admit, I've seen game show contestants appear on 2 shows in their lifetime, and even 1 guy appeared on 2 shows hosted by the same emcee (he didn't remember the contestant or at least he didn't say so on camera), but 1 show aired on CBS and the other in first run Syndication 5 years later.  I thought networks were stricter than that.  And while we're at it, Race 1 hits dvd just as Race 8 starts on CBS and Race 7 hits dvd as Race 8 ends and only a few months after its only rerun to date on GSN.  Why is CBS Video in their inifinite wisdom let alone their deal with Paramount (a usual reputable company for home video) stalling on the releases of 2 through 6?  Now that I've seen most of them on GSN, I'm looking forward to getting them on disc, let alone seeing Race 9 on CBS, so let's put them out in order huh?  By the way CBS is taking applications (at least as I type this) for race 10, anyone want a partner?",5,Almost heaven for Race 7,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,1856,"['Ok', 'only', 'thing', 'close', 'heaven', 'was', 'starting', 'line', 'was', 'just', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'hey', 'did', 'get', 'attention', 'Anyway', 'being', 'fan', 'only', '1', 'reality', 'show', 'one', 'having', 'originally', 'caught', 'race', '7', 'middle', 'GSN', 'rerun', 'was', 'buying', 'race', '1', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'hype', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'previously', 'appeared', 'CBS', 'other', 'popular', 'show', 'type', 'Survivor', 'watching', 'episode', '1', 'uncut', 'disc', '1', 'adding', 'opening', 'segment', 'credits', 'episode', '2', 'can', 'definitely', 'sympathize', 'other', 'fans', 'other', 'contestants', 'well', 'So', 'yes', 'good', 'race', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'should', 'gotten', 'shaft', 'sooner', 'What', 'really', 'revamped', 'John', 'McGraw', 'attitude', 'winning', 'cost', 'CBS', 'actually', 'allowed', 'sign', 'up', 'get', 'show', 'winning', 'other', 'popular', 'series', 'only', 'what', 'year', '2', 'ago', 'Hey', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'game', 'show', 'contestants', 'appear', '2', 'shows', 'lifetime', 'even', '1', 'guy', 'appeared', '2', 'shows', 'hosted', 'same', 'emcee', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'contestant', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'so', 'camera', '1', 'show', 'aired', 'CBS', 'other', 'first', 'run', 'Syndication', '5', 'years', 'later', 'thought', 'networks', 'were', 'stricter', ""'re"", 'Race', '1', 'hits', 'dvd', 'just', 'Race', '8', 'starts', 'CBS', 'Race', '7', 'hits', 'dvd', 'Race', '8', 'ends', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'only', 'rerun', 'date', 'GSN', 'Why', 'CBS', 'Video', 'inifinite', 'wisdom', 'let', 'alone', 'deal', 'Paramount', 'usual', 'reputable', 'company', 'home', 'video', 'stalling', 'releases', '2', '6', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'GSN', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'disc', 'let', 'alone', 'seeing', 'Race', '9', 'CBS', 'let', 'put', 'out', 'order', 'huh', 'way', 'CBS', 'taking', 'applications', 'least', 'type', 'race', '10', 'anyone', 'want', 'partner']",The Amazing Race - The Seventh Season
941038,A27YUZ4HZHPWUU,B000BDGW94,GamerGirl,"[11, 24]","Amazing Race is really a great show, but I'm kind of disappointed in CBS for releasing this season out of order when there were some much better seasons before it. I'm assuming this is to cash in on Rob and Amber's celebrity while they still have one or two of their fifteen minutes left. Rob and Amber are a couple that you have to either love or hate, and unfortunately for me, I hate them so this season ranks pretty low on my list. I find Rob to be simply disgusting as a human being and, with him getting so much camera time during this season, I found myself wishing there was a toilet in my living room.Other than this major drawback (for my fellow haters and me), there were some teams that were fun to watch. If you've never seen this season, the last leg is an absolute nailbiter no matter who you're rooting for.

941040,A2QHVPF8KMBX3G,B000BDGW94,"Helene ""Borneo Girl""","[0, 2]","For many years now, I have been a great fan of The Amazing Race (TAR) TV reality series. That's why I can say that Season 7 is not one of its best season.This is mainly due to the casting of members from the Survivor reality show. I thought that TAR is all about having regular common 2-team people racing around the world.  By putting contestants from another reality show, like Survivor, really sucks because these teams have the experience of being on a reality show.Anyway, the 11 teams in Season 7 were Rob and Amber, Lynn and Alex, Patrick and Susan, Ron and Kelly, Meredith and Gretchen, Brian and Greg, Ryan and Chuck, Ucheanna and Joyce, Debbie and Bianca, Megan and Heidi, and lastly, Ryan and Deana.I liked teams Meredith and Gretchen, Ucheanna and Joyce, and Brian and Greg; really nice people and were the life of the show; they made the show fun to watch.  Nasty teams like Rob and Amber, Ray and Deana, Patrick and Susan, and Lynn and Alex were the people you want to hate and lose the race.A few incidents badly marked the show; For one, Rob and Amber were irritating, cocky and mean. I was very happy that they didn't win in the end. I didn't like them when they said Meredith may have pushed Gretchen (the elderly couple team) on purpose - Gretchen fell in the dark while doing their cave detour, and her face was bleeding. Rob and Amber didn't symphatize or leave money to help the elderly couple when they were stripped of their money after check-in last at the pitstop.  Anyway, Rob and Amber's selfishness and self-centredness finally defeated them in the end.  They didn't win the $1 million; they came 2nd.  So close yet so far! That's karma!I have a big question. Why must TAR select contestants from other reality show to be in their show? There must have been hundreds of applications from other people, and the TAR just had to pick Rob and Amber! I can't put into words my deep disappointment when Rob and Amber were selected to be in Season 11 AllStars Edition! What the hell?? What is wrong with everyone over in TAR? There are many other ex-contestants from previous TAR seasons to chose from. Why didn't they pick the Derek and Drew (Twins/Models) or Gina and Sylvia (the moms) from Season 3? or Linda and Karen (Bowling moms) of Season 5? What about Blake and Paige (brother and sister) or Cyndi and Russel (Pastors) from Season 2? If TAR wanted some interesting/memorable teams, then they could have chosen boston buddies Chris and Alex (season 2), Ken and Gerard (season 3), Jonathan and Victoria (the screaming couple) or Lori and Bolo (professional wrestlers) from Season 6, or gay couple Lynn and Alex (season 7), and hippies BJ and Tyler (season 9).Anyway, as for me, I will not buy DVDs of Season 7 and Season 11  of The Amazing Race. :(",4,Not the best season of The Amazing Race series,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2777,"['many', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'fan', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'TAR', 'TV', 'reality', 'series', 'why', 'can', 'say', 'Season', '7', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'season.This', 'mainly', 'due', 'casting', 'members', 'Survivor', 'reality', 'show', 'thought', 'TAR', 'having', 'regular', 'common', '2-team', 'people', 'racing', 'world', 'putting', 'contestants', 'reality', 'show', 'Survivor', 'really', 'teams', 'have', 'experience', 'being', 'reality', 'show.Anyway', '11', 'teams', 'Season', '7', 'were', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'Lynn', 'Alex', 'Patrick', 'Susan', 'Ron', 'Kelly', 'Meredith', 'Gretchen', 'Brian', 'Greg', 'Ryan', 'Chuck', 'Ucheanna', 'Joyce', 'Debbie', 'Bianca', 'Megan', 'Heidi', 'lastly', 'Ryan', 'Deana.I', 'liked', 'teams', 'Meredith', 'Gretchen', 'Ucheanna', 'Joyce', 'Brian', 'Greg', 'really', 'nice', 'people', 'were', 'life', 'show', 'made', 'show', 'fun', 'watch', 'Nasty', 'teams', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'Ray', 'Deana', 'Patrick', 'Susan', 'Lynn', 'Alex', 'were', 'people', 'want', 'hate', 'lose', 'race.A', 'few', 'incidents', 'badly', 'marked', 'show', 'one', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'were', 'irritating', 'cocky', 'mean', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'said', 'Meredith', 'may', 'have', 'pushed', 'Gretchen', 'elderly', 'couple', 'team', 'purpose', 'Gretchen', 'fell', 'dark', 'doing', 'cave', 'detour', 'face', 'was', 'bleeding', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'did', ""n't"", 'symphatize', 'leave', 'money', 'help', 'elderly', 'couple', 'when', 'were', 'stripped', 'money', 'check-in', 'last', 'pitstop', 'Anyway', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'selfishness', 'self-centredness', 'finally', 'defeated', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', '1', 'million', 'came', '2nd', 'So', 'close', 'yet', 'so', 'far', 'karma', 'have', 'big', 'question', 'Why', 'must', 'TAR', 'select', 'contestants', 'other', 'reality', 'show', 'be', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hundreds', 'applications', 'other', 'people', 'TAR', 'just', 'had', 'pick', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'words', 'deep', 'disappointment', 'when', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'were', 'selected', 'be', 'Season', '11', 'AllStars', 'Edition', 'What', 'hell', 'What', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'TAR', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'ex-contestants', 'previous', 'TAR', 'seasons', 'chose', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'Derek', 'Drew', 'Twins/Models', 'Gina', 'Sylvia', 'moms', 'Season', '3', 'Linda', 'Karen', 'Bowling', 'moms', 'Season', '5', 'What', 'Blake', 'Paige', 'brother', 'sister', 'Cyndi', 'Russel', 'Pastors', 'Season', '2', 'TAR', 'wanted', 'interesting/memorable', 'teams', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'boston', 'buddies', 'Chris', 'Alex', 'season', '2', 'Ken', 'Gerard', 'season', '3', 'Jonathan', 'Victoria', 'screaming', 'couple', 'Lori', 'Bolo', 'professional', 'wrestlers', 'Season', '6', 'gay', 'couple', 'Lynn', 'Alex', 'season', '7', 'hippies', 'BJ', 'Tyler', 'season', '9', '.Anyway', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'Season', '7', 'Season', '11', 'Amazing', 'Race']",The Amazing Race - The Seventh Season

Add to that the fact that CBS decided, in their infinite wisdom, that they'd sell more DVD's if they skipped right to the 7th season (for obvious reasons) and so we don't get seasons 2, 3, 4, etc. which are far more worthy races.

The winners of this season were Uchenna and Joyce. People thought that Rob and Amber would win. Ron and Kelly argued a lot and if they did not argue as much as they did, they probaly would of come in 2nd (after Rob and Amber). Rob and Amber wer less than 1 minute away from winning but they had no cash to pay the taxi driver. Uchenna and Joyce passed them when they were begging for money.

Gretchen was gong in a cave, but then she lost her grip and fell, she had blood all over her face, but she got medical attention. People were shocked they came in 4th place because Meridith and Gretchen were seniors Meridith: 69 years old Gretchen: 66 years old! 5th place racers Lynn and Alex: AHHHHH! These people annoy me. They are boyfriends and.... boy they annoy me. 6th place racers: Brian and Gregg. They had a car flip in Africa, they were in 2nd place in the race, then, Brian was going way too fast on a small road and then the car flipped over. Brian and Gregg were fine, but their camere man was hurt badly. 7th place racers: Ray and Deana. These 2 were dating on and off, you can tell why they werent dating all the time, they argued more thea Ron and Kelly! 8th place racers: Susan and Patrick. This was a mother son team. I think they should of made it farther but, they were too slow. 9th place racers: Debbie and Bianca. On the 1st leg they came in 1st. Then on the 2nd leg they were in the middle of the pack. On the 3rd leg Susan and Patrick beat Debbie and Bianca narrowly. Debbie and Bianca were elimanated. 10th place racers: Megan and Heidi: These 2 roomates were hotties!! They were flirthing with Brian and Gregg. I really, really, really wish they made it farther! Last place racers: Ryan and Chuck.

Eleven teams of two with some kind of relationship follow clues in a race around the world.  Along the way, there are also tasks they must perform to get their next clue.  These tasks provide looks at the culture of the area they are visiting.  Those of us watching at home get a nice geography and culture lesson without ever leaving out living room.  As each leg of the race ends, the last team is usually eliminated, narrowing the field each weak until the final three teams race for the finish.The teams this season fall into the normal parameters.  There's a gay couple, several couples who are dating or married, a pair of brothers, an older couple, and a mother/son team.  Frankly, it feels a bit like they have a template these days and are looking to fill certain pre set rolls. Still, this season had the standouts.  Brothers Brian and Greg were nice guys everyone was rooting for.  Ray and Deena were this season's fight from day one couple.  Meredith and Gretchen, despite their age, proved to be tough competitors.  While they often irritated me, I couldn't help but root for them.  Kelly and Ron were the all American beauty queen/Iraq war vet couple.  I started out liking them, but by the end they made me cringe.  Uchenna and Joyce where such a nice couple, you couldn't help but root for them.  And then there was Rob and Amber.Whether it was supposed to be or not, this season of The Amazing Race became all about Rob and Amber, still riding high off Amber's win in Survivor All-Star.  Unlike the last time TAR tried a reality show crossover, Rob and Amber proved to have real staying power, using their fame to find help along the way.  And, of course, Rob was able to use his power of persuasion to get several teams to support his plan when it came to skipping the nasty food challenge.  I hated Rob in both seasons of Survivor he was on, but I will admit I found myself rooting for them this go around.  I think I found Rob's antics to be a breath of fresh air on the show.Of course, the locations where excellent as well.  The fact that they haven't repeated anything yet amazes me.  Personally, I loved their trip through Botswana since my parents have been there twice.  It gave me a chance to see the country in something other then still shots.  Other highlights included Peru, Argentina, Istanbul, and London.This season also featured some amazingly close finishes.  Several times the team eliminated was only eliminated by a few minutes.  The ending was a real nail bitter as well.  Of course, this is partially editing, but even without that, we seemed to have lots of close calls this season.The show is not as fresh as it used to be, with the casting falling into predictable patterns.  But the show is still entertaining and slightly educational.  This is the best reality program out there.",5,Will Rob and Amber Survive the Amazing Race?,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,2880,"['seventh', 'season', 'show', 'becoming', 'familiar', 'Eleven', 'teams', 'two', 'kind', 'relationship', 'follow', 'clues', 'race', 'world', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'tasks', 'must', 'perform', 'get', 'next', 'clue', 'tasks', 'provide', 'culture', 'area', 'are', 'visiting', 'watching', 'home', 'get', 'nice', 'geography', 'culture', 'lesson', 'ever', 'leaving', 'out', 'living', 'room', 'leg', 'race', 'last', 'team', 'usually', 'eliminated', 'narrowing', 'field', 'weak', 'final', 'three', 'teams', 'race', 'finish.The', 'teams', 'season', 'fall', 'normal', 'parameters', 'gay', 'couple', 'several', 'couples', 'who', 'are', 'dating', 'married', 'pair', 'brothers', 'older', 'couple', 'mother/son', 'team', 'Frankly', 'bit', 'have', 'template', 'days', 'are', 'looking', 'fill', 'certain', 'pre', 'set', 'rolls', 'Still', 'season', 'had', 'standouts', 'Brothers', 'Brian', 'Greg', 'were', 'nice', 'guys', 'everyone', 'was', 'rooting', 'Ray', 'Deena', 'were', 'season', 'fight', 'day', 'one', 'couple', 'Meredith', 'Gretchen', 'age', 'proved', 'be', 'tough', 'competitors', 'often', 'irritated', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Kelly', 'Ron', 'were', 'all', 'American', 'beauty', 'queen/Iraq', 'war', 'vet', 'couple', 'started', 'out', 'liking', 'end', 'made', 'cringe', 'Uchenna', 'Joyce', 'where', 'nice', 'couple', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'then', 'was', 'Rob', 'Amber.Whether', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'not', 'season', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'became', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'still', 'riding', 'high', 'Amber', 'win', 'Survivor', 'All-Star', 'last', 'time', 'TAR', 'tried', 'reality', 'show', 'crossover', 'Rob', 'Amber', 'proved', 'have', 'real', 'staying', 'power', 'using', 'fame', 'find', 'help', 'way', 'course', 'Rob', 'was', 'able', 'use', 'power', 'persuasion', 'get', 'several', 'teams', 'support', 'plan', 'when', 'came', 'skipping', 'nasty', 'food', 'challenge', 'hated', 'Rob', 'seasons', 'Survivor', 'was', 'will', 'admit', 'found', 'rooting', 'go', 'think', 'found', 'Rob', 'antics', 'be', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'show.Of', 'course', 'locations', 'where', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'repeated', 'anything', 'yet', 'Personally', 'loved', 'trip', 'Botswana', 'parents', 'have', 'been', 'twice', 'gave', 'chance', 'see', 'country', 'something', 'other', 'then', 'still', 'shots', 'Other', 'highlights', 'included', 'Peru', 'Argentina', 'Istanbul', 'London.This', 'season', 'also', 'featured', 'amazingly', 'close', 'finishes', 'Several', 'times', 'team', 'eliminated', 'was', 'only', 'eliminated', 'few', 'minutes', 'ending', 'was', 'real', 'nail', 'bitter', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'partially', 'editing', 'even', 'seemed', 'have', 'lots', 'close', 'season.The', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'fresh', 'used', 'be', 'casting', 'falling', 'predictable', 'patterns', 'show', 'still', 'entertaining', 'slightly', 'educational', 'best', 'reality', 'program', 'there']",The Amazing Race - The Seventh Season
941048,A2CVOAWC4OAKL2,B000BDGW94,Matthew B. Cravens,"[6, 7]","After thoroughly enjoying Season 1 of the Amazing Race, I was excited to hear about Season 7 being released on DVD.  I didn't get to see Seasons 1 or 7 when they were actually broadcast so that made it even more exciting to watch and experience.  That's the thing about TAR; it isn't just a show it is truly an EXPERIENCE for the viewer.  The 11 teams: Rob and Amber, Lynn and Alex, Patrick and Susan, Ron and Kelly, Meredith and Gretchen, Brian and Greg, Ryan and Chuck, Ucheanna and Joyce, Debbie and Bianca, Megan and Heidi and Ryan and Deana race around the world for a cool $1 million prize for the team that finishes first.  Ucheanna and Joyce, the winners of the race, weren't very visible in the show until about 3/4 of the way through in the infamous hair cutting episode, but were really the obvious safe bet from the start.  It is shows like this where you really find the best people in the world and also the worst people in the world.  Teams like Rob and Amber, Patrick and Susan and Lynn and Alex are the only real bad mark on this fantastic ""reality"" show.  Teams like Meredith and Gretchen and Ucheanna and Joyce and Brian and Greg are the inspiration and life of the show and really make it fun.  I think that winners Ucheanna and Joyce proved once and for all that in a competition, you don't have to play dirty to win.  Rob and Amber Mariano would have done well for themselves and may have won if they would have taken that to heart from the very beginning of the season, instead of blaming their losing on Ucheanna and Joyce getting on the same flight as them.  I think even more so than Season 1, Season 7 kept your heart pumping and provided edge-of-your-seat entertainment the whole time.  From the creators of this show down to most of the contestants, TAR continues to be one of the best shows on television period.

Meredith and Gretchen were my favorite team ever until Bopper and Mark in Season 20.  I didn't like all the snipping at the old couple from the younger racers - most of whom were eliminated (deservedly so) long before the senior team.  This season was definitely worth watching.  The ending was very exciting as well with a race to the finish.

I have never done this before, and will try and control myself as I watch season one on DVD. I looked on the box and the total viewing was 10 hours, but it seemed three or four!
