Boxbangieleroerrwwerevrwrer III ""inre-""","[0, 0]","The biggest problem I have with this movie, as with most Hollywierd films today, isn't the acting but that the actions of the characters make no sense. If you are a billionaire CEO who needs his priceless invention back (lost in a downed plane in a remote region), why wouldn't you send in a team of specialists to retrieve it for you? Why risk the mission by going yourself, with TWO useless women, a tech nerd and a drunken big game hunter? Yes, a big game hunter! WTF.This films biggest failure is it's ridiculous plot. I won't speak of the ending except to say that unless your only experience of the world is watching soap operas and Oprah you will probably feel cheated by such a lame and completely unrealistic ending. The whole thing would have been improved tremendously if the director had shown just a little guts and originality. Instead the writer/director chose to have the characters act in the most implausible manner and against their own best interests.If you want to see this film I suggest you rent it first and then decide if it's worth more of your money to buy it.",2,Pretty Bad.

But I did learn a few things about Sasquatch in watching this film.I learned that Sasquatch not only starred in this film, but he edited it as well. Oh, the credits don't come out and SAY that the film was edited by Sasquatch. But from the best I can tell, Sasquatch edited the film, using a blunt instrument. Maybe a tree trunk or smooth rock.I also learned that Sasquatch has X-ray vision and can dodge bullets. This leads me to believe that Sasquatch is the love child of Superman and Chewbacca. It's somthing I'd rather not think about, but the proof is right in the film.All in all, this film should be avoided at all costs.

I had previously read up on all the pre-release information regarding this intriguing little production, months before it hit DVD, while I was employed with a high-end rental chain.I wish my opinion could therefore be more forgiving.Henriksen's portrayal, while certainly respectful, is not enough to save what unfortunately becomes a tediously boring exercise in wasted potential. Any film detailing the presence of a rampaging bigfoot should, by every stretch of the imagination, contain at least some notable measure of excitement. There remains, however, not one solitary shred of that sensation to be found anywhere within this release. The script is overwhelmed by far too much pointless dialouge and walking around. And the actual sasquatch of the film's title spends the vast majority of time concealed in shadow, observing rather than attacking.Now, in complete and total contrast, I recently found Ryan Schifrin's ""Abominable"" a far more satisfying experience. That specific film debuted only this past May on the Sci-Fi Channel and is actually set for a DVD release later this year. Those, like me, who were disappointed with ""Sasquatch"" will conversely find much to enjoy with ""Abominable.""

I have always stopped on a channel like Sci-Fi or Discovery or Unsolved Mysteries when this kind of stuff came on. Something about these legends has always interested me and so I thought this would be a good purchase, come on Lance Henriksen is in this. It turns out that this is not one of the best movies on the subject ever all though it is not entirely bad, it is a Sci-Fi channel movie though I believe. So that will either make you not watch this ever or you will be some what and strangely intrigued.The story is all about a group of people headed up Lance that are on a rescue mission to save his daughter and any other would be survivors of a plane crash. Along they way they learn that they are there for more then just that and there just so happens to be something lurking in the dark following them. So the hunt is on to find the people and the crash site to find a little something extra, sounds interesting right? Well add in a really mad Sasquatch and you should have a really good film to watch on a rainy day or night whatever. But things don't work out so well and the angry Sasquatch is out and about trying to kill them off one by one.As much as that sounds like a great film it is actually not all that great and to be honest it kinda gets boring at times and I hate to say that. I can tell from watching this that the potential was there, and could have been a great movie. Unfortunately it seems like everybody wasn't into this production, both in front of and behind the camera. Which is really a shame because the material and story was right there waiting for some caring hands. I wish that there would have been more put into this production because it seems so lame but at the same time it feels good, I know I `am confused to. All the performances seem uninspired and really under acted, and that includes Lance Henriksen. When you watch this I am sure you will feel the same way, Lance just seems up set and uninspired.Even director/co writer Jonas Quastel seems like he just doesn't care about this film, or maybe he felt that way at times because at times this seems pretty good. Along with co writer Chris Lanning these two were at one time on the right track, the script at one point seemed good enough to get Lance involved. But with uninspired performances and direction this seems like a lackluster effort. I would say this is worth a rental for any one interested in this kind of film, but other then that one may not like this. There is a sequel [Sasquatch Hunters] to this, which while not as good in story is at least interesting through out. If done right this film could have been great, you can tell what they were trying for with barley showing the Sasquatch.

There's no arguing that, but ""Sasquatch"" has got to be the worst of the bunch.  Starring Lance Henriksen and Andrea Roth, this story follows the crusade of a rescue team in search of Henriksen's daughter and a device that can prove the existence of Bigfoot.  The plane went down in the Pacific Northwest and along the way happens to really tick off a Sasquatch.  I'm not going to tell you why, but you can read other reviews for the spoilers.  Henriksen heads up the ragtag bunch of typical horror movie fodder.  There's the hotshot who knows everything, the geek, the girl who gets naked at the most unlikely time, and the deceptive villain out for personal gain.  One by one they are picked off by the Sasquatch and they don't know why.  Just rest assured that 'Squatch's reasons are soon revealed and everything comes to a head when ol' Bigfoot and Henriksen faceoff in a battle to the death!Honestly, this flick is just flat out boring.  Henriksen, who seems to relish in doing bad flicks like this, doesn't even seem to have a spark in this movie.  His character is just as dull and unimportant as the rest of the gang in the flick.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","Back when The Blair Witch Project launched, it became fashionable to proclaim every horror movie was inspired by real events, no matter how tenuous.  This tradition goes all the way back to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was based on the horrors of Ed Gein, which pretty much has nothing to do with the events in the movie.  Before the Internet became such a ubiquitous part of our lives, directors had a lot more credibility.  If a movie said it was real, we believed it - at least until we got home and checked the web.  Nowadays audience members can check facts in real time from their mobile phones and discover if they've been duped.The Untold is a supposedly real account. SASQUATCH ALERT: A plane carrying a supersecret genetic-sequencing computer called the Huxley Project crash landed into a Sasquatch. Then the Sasquatch's mate took revenge on the crew because it knew the Huxley would reveal its secret existence to the world. Then billionaire Harlan Knowles who was president of Bio-Comp, the company that created the Huxley Project and just happened to look like a lot like Lance Henriksen, went after the Sasquatch in a sort of cryptozoological revenge mission for it killing his daughter, who was on the plane.True story.It's a shame though. A search of the web reveals that Bio-Comp creates financial products, the Huxley Project involves a monkey trapped in a lab trying to type Shakespeare, and Harry Knowles runs some movie review web site.

The recovery of this technology is critical to Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) for the survival of his company depends on it.Going in with a group of associates led by an experinced tracker, Knowles seeks out his box as well as finding his daughter who was also on board when the plane went down.Trudging through an uncharted part of the Canadian wilderness, they feel the presence of something stalking them. Will they find what they're looking for and make it out alive?Henriksen gives a bitter performance as a CEO who's own personnal interest in saving his company outweighs his desire to find his daughter.The movie does have a few cliche characters. The hot blonde with a hidden agenda who tries to seduce Knowles with a brief nude flash. The one time military expert turned total jerk who clashes with Knowles' tracker who can see Knowles eye to eye as a self made man. He is the only other character you can care about.But the beast itself is the most important part of this movie.

Depending on exactly what bacteria make up the film, it can have several different characteristics.  Whatever characteristics they may be, they are doubtlessly more entertaining than this film.  It opens with a jerky, dull montage, an effect to be deployed at every possible convenience.  The shots are often blurred.  The slow motion, shamelessly used throughout, is jerky and inappropriate.The camera work is not the only technical aspect of this film to be done poorly.  The only word to describe the effects is awe-inspiring.  I never would have believed that something could be done so poorly with all the technology available to create a monster.  When one finally sees the creature in full, one realizes that it no wonder why no one has seen a bigfoot, it's because those poor creatures are ashamed of the way they look.  The end result appears to be something like a gorilla/shorn poodle mix.  Hair is randomly allotted to body parts.  The shots from the POV of the yeti are absurd.  It seems to have some type of infrared vision but without consistent distinction between temperatures.  It's hard to believe that an upper primate created these effects.  Maybe there is bigfoot after all...The script is awful.  There is not an unpredictable moment throughout.  There comes a moment when one of the crew finds part of the downed plane.  Everyone sees scratches in the bark of trees but they cannot figure out what happened to the plane.  Even talented actors would not be able to make palatable this bile.  It just so happens that there is no evidence of acting talent shown here.  The lone actor of note here, Lance Henriksen, just seems tired and apathetic, understandably.This film is exactly 86 minutes too long.  Everything about it is terrible.

734148,A157XTSMJH9XA4,B000085EFN,One of many,"[1, 2]","Two things must be known by the viewer before they see this movie in order for them not to be disappointed. One, this doesn't take a very realistic approach to the cryptozoological creature known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch (for those who believe in it, anyway). And two, this is a typical low-end monster flick that was never meant to be any kind of masterpiece, but rather an accomplice to popcorn and a lonely weekday's night.The story isn't a very complex one. Lance Henriksen and his little expedition group have traveled up in the snowy mountains in an attempt to find his daughter, whose plane crashed there and no one knows what had happened (or even if they survived). Also there (for the greedy part of the gang), lost in the mountains, is a nifty little device that, once they recover it, may hold the proof of Sasquatch's existence. As it turns out, it does. (Since the movie is nothing of a genius plot, I'm about to spoil the story a little bit) A family member of Sasquatch was killed by the plane as it crashed to the ground. If that didn't piss him off enough, there's that stinkin' box-like device that can prove his existence. So, he chases and tries to slaughter Henriksen's team, wanting to make sure that box doesn't leave his woods (yeah, it's getting a bit silly, isn't it?). By the end of the movie, Henriksen faces off with the beast (the others have left, but he insisted on staying behind and killing the monster). I won't spoil the very end for you, but trust me, it's just as silly and full of plot-holes as the rest of the film.Sasquatch certainly fails to present an interesting or scary monster flick. On the other hand, there are plenty of nights when boredom is your only company that it could very possibly entertain you. One highlight of the film is the fact that there is little to no CGI used for the creature. The suit isn't all that pathetic, either. They did make a wise choice by showing as little of the monster as they could, since it wasn't a very believeable costume if given a closer and clearer inspection. In short, the only reason to see Sasquatch is if you're bored and have that craving for a hairy monster stalking people in the woods.

734152,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000085EFN,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""Sasquatch"" (also known as ""The Untold"") is just another in a long line of bad bigfoot movies where people get chased by a shadowy skunk-ape in some scary woods at night. This film has a particularly convoluted plot that doesn't always make a great deal of sense, but teaches the important life lesson that if you crash your plane into a sasquatch, don't further the emotional trauma to the bigfoot clan by shooting a grieving yeti family member with a flare gun.The film opens with a small plane flying a new DNA analyzer and the daughter of the biotech company's CEO over some mountains. Of course the plane crashes and the company CEO, Harlen Knowles (Lance Henriksen,) mounts a search party both for his daughter and the DNA machine, whose inventor was also on the plane, and who left no records of the design of the machine. (Yeah, right.) All the people in the search party hate each other; one's a cryptozooligist with a yeti fixation, and the guide Winston Burg (Phil Granger,) is an unreliable drunken lout.Off they go on their trek, and no sooner are they in the woods than we find that bigfoot is watching with some of the hokiest vision effects I have ever seen. Not to fear, the bigfoot as a blur in the underbrush and especially the bigfoot as a guy (Taras Kostyuk) in a rubber suit more than live up to the low quality of the vision effects. The crew camps in the woods and the yeti quickly kidnaps a girl, then releases her for no comprehensible reason. When they get back to the campsite their biggest concern is testing her for tetanus. The next day they find cave paintings they initially believe to be millions of years old, but wait! That's incorrect, they are a couple of weeks old and painted in fresh blood. An easy mistake to make.The rescue party finds the plane crash, the DNA machine, and a video camera that documents the ordeal of the plane crash survivors in a manner not entirely unlike ""The Blair Witch Project"" (to say the least.) They also discover that the crash survivors tested sasquatch blood in the DNA analyzer from a spot of blood on the plane from when the plane squashed the yeti flat during the accident. (Now that is profoundly bad luck if you're a sasquatch!) Knowles' daughter apologizes in a way overlong videotape message, while Burg and levelheaded Clayton Tyne (Russell Ferrier) quarrel repeatedly, the fortunate outcome of which is Burg's removal from the cast by the sasquatch.After Tyne takes operational command of the expedition they discover the cave where the plane crash victims are kept, and the remaining cast members flee the woods with sasquatch in hot pursuit. Bigfoot enthusiast Plazz (Jeremy Radick) explains that he is chasing them because he wants the DNA machine because he knows it contains incontrovertible proof of his existence. (Ponder.) The party splits up, with Knowles on his own, and he has a one on one showdown with bigfoot, which is ultimately resolved by Knowles shooting the DNA machine with his pistol, after which he and the bigfoot reach a mutual understanding of the grief the other has caused their respective families. (As best I could tell.)The film is just abominable (if you will pardon the pun,) the script is half baked, and the characters are all two-dimensional cutouts behaving in wholly unnatural ways. The best performances in the film without doubt were from Henriksen and Ferrier, but that wasn't enough to keep the putrescent stench of the skunk-ape off of this piece of Canadian cheese.",1,"A Plane Crash, A DNA Processor, A Drunk Guide, And A Yeti...Now That's A Movie!",1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,3490,"['Sasquatch', 'also', 'known', 'Untold', 'just', 'long', 'line', 'bad', 'bigfoot', 'movies', 'where', 'people', 'get', 'chased', 'shadowy', 'skunk-ape', 'scary', 'woods', 'night', 'film', 'particularly', 'convoluted', 'plot', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'great', 'deal', 'sense', 'important', 'life', 'lesson', 'crash', 'plane', 'sasquatch', 'do', ""n't"", 'further', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'bigfoot', 'clan', 'shooting', 'grieving', 'yeti', 'family', 'member', 'flare', 'gun.The', 'film', 'small', 'plane', 'flying', 'new', 'DNA', 'analyzer', 'daughter', 'biotech', 'company', 'CEO', 'mountains', 'course', 'plane', 'crashes', 'company', 'CEO', 'Harlen', 'Knowles', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'search', 'party', 'daughter', 'DNA', 'machine', 'inventor', 'was', 'also', 'plane', 'who', 'left', 'records', 'design', 'machine', 'Yeah', 'right', 'people', 'search', 'party', 'hate', 'other', 'one', 'cryptozooligist', 'yeti', 'fixation', 'guide', 'Winston', 'Burg', 'Phil', 'Granger', 'unreliable', 'drunken', 'lout.Off', 'go', 'trek', 'sooner', 'are', 'woods', 'find', 'bigfoot', 'watching', 'hokiest', 'vision', 'effects', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Not', 'fear', 'bigfoot', 'blur', 'underbrush', 'especially', 'bigfoot', 'guy', 'Taras', 'Kostyuk', 'rubber', 'suit', 'more', 'live', 'up', 'low', 'quality', 'vision', 'effects', 'crew', 'camps', 'woods', 'yeti', 'quickly', 'girl', 'then', 'comprehensible', 'reason', 'When', 'get', 'back', 'campsite', 'biggest', 'concern', 'testing', 'tetanus', 'next', 'day', 'find', 'cave', 'paintings', 'initially', 'believe', 'be', 'millions', 'years', 'old', 'wait', 'incorrect', 'are', 'couple', 'weeks', 'old', 'painted', 'fresh', 'blood', 'easy', 'mistake', 'make.The', 'rescue', 'party', 'plane', 'crash', 'DNA', 'machine', 'video', 'camera', 'documents', 'ordeal', 'plane', 'crash', 'survivors', 'manner', 'not', 'entirely', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'say', 'least', 'also', 'discover', 'crash', 'survivors', 'tested', 'sasquatch', 'blood', 'DNA', 'analyzer', 'spot', 'blood', 'plane', 'when', 'plane', 'squashed', 'yeti', 'flat', 'accident', 'Now', 'profoundly', 'bad', 'luck', ""'re"", 'sasquatch', 'Knowles', 'daughter', 'apologizes', 'way', 'overlong', 'videotape', 'message', 'Burg', 'levelheaded', 'Clayton', 'Tyne', 'Russell', 'Ferrier', 'quarrel', 'repeatedly', 'fortunate', 'outcome', 'Burg', 'removal', 'cast', 'sasquatch.After', 'Tyne', 'operational', 'command', 'expedition', 'discover', 'cave', 'where', 'plane', 'crash', 'victims', 'are', 'kept', 'remaining', 'cast', 'members', 'flee', 'woods', 'sasquatch', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Bigfoot', 'enthusiast', 'Plazz', 'Jeremy', 'Radick', 'chasing', 'DNA', 'machine', 'incontrovertible', 'proof', 'existence', 'Ponder', 'party', 'up', 'Knowles', 'own', 'one', 'one', 'showdown', 'bigfoot', 'ultimately', 'resolved', 'Knowles', 'shooting', 'DNA', 'machine', 'pistol', 'bigfoot', 'reach', 'mutual', 'understanding', 'grief', 'other', 'caused', 'respective', 'families', 'best', 'could', 'tell', 'film', 'just', 'abominable', 'will', 'pardon', 'pun', 'script', 'half', 'baked', 'characters', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'cutouts', 'behaving', 'wholly', 'unnatural', 'ways', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'doubt', 'were', 'Henriksen', 'Ferrier', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'putrescent', 'stench', 'skunk-ape', 'piece', 'Canadian', 'cheese']",N/A

I always thought it would be easier to believe in aliens, or nessy because we have not fully explored the oceans, or space, but I don't know if I've ever bought into the bigfoot thing, however I'm not a skeptic either, lets just say I've seen and heard some weird stuff in the woods too that I couldn't explain, but doesn't mean it was bigfoot",2,"not bad, but far from great",1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,1054,"['DVD', 'Picture', 'quality', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'had', 'good', 'sound', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'line', 'why', 'low', 'rating', 'one', 'typical', 'horror', 'movies', 'annoying', 'view', 'point', 'creature', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'distorted', 'vision', 'cam', 'predator', 'far', 'worse', 'annoying', 'awhile', 'next', 'complaint', 'call', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'killings', 'see', 'distorted', 'vision', 'then', 'scream', 'also', 'annoying', 'Not', 'only', 'needed', 'more', 'blood', 'action', 'was', 'slow', 'spots', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'movie', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'true', 'believe', 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'believe', 'aliens', 'nessy', 'have', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'oceans', 'space', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bought', 'bigfoot', 'thing', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'skeptic', 'either', 'just', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'weird', 'stuff', 'woods', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'explain', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'bigfoot']",N/A

An independent film, for sure, that obviously had consultants to understand the aspects, magnitude, and characteristics of the aforementioned `Bigfoot' or `Sasquatch,' the film never really lets you go, your attention firmly fixed at all times in case you miss something! Entertaining for teenagers right up to seniors, the acting is okay to good most times with average to good directing to pull off something that is obviously filmed remotely on location. Nice scenery, action, some minor nudity, and yet again some great acting scenes from Lance Henriksen bring the audience `actual' accounts as if it were a documentary of sorts.

734156,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000085EFN,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","Hmm, How could I best describe 2003's ""Sasquatch"" (originally titled ""The Untold"")? If you can imagine a low budget version of both ""The Edge"" and ""Predator,"" substituting a Bigfoot for the bear and alien, with some elements of ""The Blair Witch Project"" thrown in, you'd pretty much have ""Sasquatch."" The story involves a plane crash in Bigfoot territory and the group of people who search for the wreckage. As a matter of fact, the ENTIRE FILM takes place in the forest (filmed in British Columbia near Vancouver).I'm kind of a sucker for these types of crisis-in-the-woods stories, so I have to admit that I marginally liked ""Sasquatch."" The film is marred a bit by some strange directorial techniques; particularly the irritating and inexplicable overuse of the 'fade-to-black' technique. Plus, some of the characters and dialogue come off unbelievable and goofy.On the plus side, the filmmakers throw in a literal 'babe in the woods'; and, yes, she does have a nude hotspring scene (not that you see much, so don't get too excited). Lance Henriksen is always good, of course. And I also liked the ending; it was more profound and moving than anticipated.But, you ask, what about the appearance of the creature? In other words, is the 'payoff' any good? I kinda liked what they came up with, although it appears as if one of the beast's ancestors mated with Ben Franklin. Just joking; it's not the conventional appearance of the creature but it works pretty good here.This is not a great bigfoot flick; it's not even very good. In fact, it's the least of the recent SyFy films on Sassy (discounting the abysmal ""Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon""). But if you're a fan of the creature or a sucker for these types of stories, ""Sasquatch"" is mandatory.Here's how I rate the various bigfoot flicks of the new millennium (see my reviews of each for details):""Sasquatch Mountain"" (2006): A-""Sasquatch Hunters"" (2005): B+""Abominable"" (2006): B""Clawed"" (2005): C+ or B-""Sasquatch"" (2003): C""Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon"" (2008): F",3,One of the weaker new millennium bigfoot flicks,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,2023,"['Hmm', 'How', 'could', 'best', 'describe', '2003', 'Sasquatch', 'originally', 'titled', 'Untold', 'can', 'imagine', 'low', 'budget', 'version', 'Edge', 'Predator', 'substituting', 'Bigfoot', 'bear', 'alien', 'elements', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'thrown', ""'d"", 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'Sasquatch', 'story', 'plane', 'crash', 'Bigfoot', 'territory', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'search', 'wreckage', 'matter', 'fact', 'ENTIRE', 'FILM', 'place', 'forest', 'filmed', 'British', 'Columbia', 'Vancouver', '.I', ""'m"", 'kind', 'sucker', 'types', 'crisis-in-the-woods', 'stories', 'have', 'admit', 'marginally', 'liked', 'Sasquatch', 'film', 'marred', 'bit', 'strange', 'directorial', 'techniques', 'particularly', 'irritating', 'inexplicable', 'overuse', ""'fade-to-black"", 'technique', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'come', 'unbelievable', 'plus', 'side', 'filmmakers', 'throw', 'literal', ""'babe"", 'woods', 'yes', 'have', 'nude', 'hotspring', 'scene', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'always', 'good', 'course', 'also', 'liked', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'profound', 'moving', 'anticipated.But', 'ask', 'what', 'appearance', 'creature', 'other', 'words', ""'payoff"", 'good', 'kinda', 'liked', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'beast', 'ancestors', 'mated', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Just', 'joking', 'not', 'conventional', 'appearance', 'creature', 'pretty', 'good', 'here.This', 'not', 'great', 'bigfoot', 'flick', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'least', 'recent', 'SyFy', 'films', 'Sassy', 'discounting', 'abysmal', 'Yeti', 'Curse', 'Snow', 'Demon', ""'re"", 'fan', 'creature', 'sucker', 'types', 'stories', 'Sasquatch', 'how', 'rate', 'various', 'bigfoot', 'flicks', 'new', 'millennium', 'see', 'reviews', 'details', 'Sasquatch', 'Mountain', '2006', 'A-', 'Sasquatch', 'Hunters', '2005', 'B+', 'Abominable', '2006', 'B', 'Clawed', '2005', 'C+', 'B-', 'Sasquatch', '2003', 'C', 'Yeti', 'Curse', 'Snow', 'Demon', '2008', 'F']",N/A
