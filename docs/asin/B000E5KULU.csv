968544,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B000E5KULU,Claire,"[5, 9]","This episode is like a pathetic attempt to imitate some cheesy 80's teen horror flick combined with an after school special on peer pressure. For some reason these students are all trapped inside school due to bad weather and the teachers won't let them go home so the students rebel. They run around the halls chanting something stupid while the Jump St gang (minus Ioki) attempt to solve a rape case. I only watched this episode b/c I wanted to see Johnny Depp's last performance as Tom Hanson. This ep was really the last one of season 4 but they put it on the season 5 box set obviously to sell copies since it has Johnny Depp. His performance was weak and the whole episode was lame. Then towards the end, it was like the writers had nowhere to go with this ridiculous plot so Hanson and Hoffs suddenly announce to the mob that they are cops. This doesn't go over well so the mob chases them and starts beating them up. Penhall was posing as a teacher so the students had already locked him up. Finally one girl yells at everyone to chill out with this bullying and the weather lets up so everyone can go home. Only bother watching this episode if you are a Johnny Depp fan and you've just marathon watched seasons 1-4 and now need to see Johnny Depp's final episode of this show so you can have some closure! Warning though: you may not get closure so go back and watch the first 2 or 3 seasons so you can remember the show and Tom Hanson in a positive way...",1,Final ep with Johnny Depp...,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,1465,"['episode', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'imitate', 'cheesy', '80', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'combined', 'school', 'special', 'peer', 'pressure', 'reason', 'students', 'are', 'trapped', 'school', 'due', 'bad', 'weather', 'teachers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'home', 'so', 'students', 'rebel', 'run', 'halls', 'chanting', 'something', 'stupid', 'Jump', 'St', 'gang', 'Ioki', 'attempt', 'solve', 'rape', 'case', 'only', 'watched', 'episode', 'b/c', 'wanted', 'see', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'last', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanson', 'ep', 'was', 'really', 'last', 'one', 'season', '4', 'put', 'season', '5', 'box', 'set', 'obviously', 'sell', 'copies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'was', 'weak', 'whole', 'episode', 'was', 'lame', 'Then', 'end', 'was', 'writers', 'had', 'nowhere', 'go', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'Hanson', 'Hoffs', 'suddenly', 'announce', 'mob', 'are', 'cops', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'well', 'so', 'mob', 'beating', 'up', 'Penhall', 'was', 'posing', 'teacher', 'students', 'had', 'already', 'locked', 'up', 'Finally', 'one', 'girl', 'yells', 'everyone', 'chill', 'out', 'bullying', 'weather', 'up', 'so', 'everyone', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'Only', 'bother', 'watching', 'episode', 'are', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'just', 'marathon', 'watched', 'seasons', '1-4', 'now', 'need', 'see', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'final', 'episode', 'show', 'can', 'have', 'closure', 'Warning', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'closure', 'so', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'first', '2', '3', 'seasons', 'can', 'remember', 'show', 'Tom', 'Hanson', 'positive', 'way']",21 Jump Street Season 5
