Yet old-school Jackie Chan films can really be tough to take.  Even some of his ""classics"".  This movie is definitely a notch above ""Drunken Master"" in both fights and humor.  It's just wildly inconsistent.  Though it does have the Korean born Hapkido Grandmaster Ing-Sik Whang.  He rocks.  Everything else is a little off.  Some of the humor is actually quite funny and there are some cool scenes.  The lion dance, for example.  It's not bad, and it is  enjoyable to watch, but not on the level I was expecting for a kung fu movie.  Though expectations will often turn a potentially good movie sour.The film is digitally remastered and in widescreen, so the presentation is nothing to complain about, but... having Wei Pai and Yuen Biao in your movie and hardly having them do anything IS.  What a waste.  Usually in Jackie's films of this period the final fight helps make up for the lack of substance that preceded it, but here it doesn't work.  The choreography is very good, and ahead of its time, but the premise of the fight is too absurd for them to be able to pull it off.  This does have an option for English dubbing.

455347,ASFTYWTX1WWFE,6305234965,Shawn McKenna,"[2, 2]","Jackie Chan had already established himself in Hong Kong as a box office champion with 1978's Drunken Master and 1979's Fearless Hyena, but he was not getting his fiscal due from Lo Wei Productions. So he opted out of his contract with Lo Wei and was hired by Golden Harvest. The Young Master was his first picture under that studio. The film was interrupted several times because of the contract dispute with Lo and a Triad that wanted a stake in Jackie's fortune. This was eventually settled with help by Jimmy Wang Yu whom Jackie would owe (along many other actors) several favors. Even with all this chaos, Jackie was still able to create a memorable and must-have film, though the movie is marked by continuity problems.Jackie stars as Ah Lung a mediocre student (funny he doesn't seem so in the film and that point is soon forgotten) who loses in a beautifully choreographed lion dance competition because his fellow adopted brother Jing Keung (Wei Pei), faked an injury and competed incognito for the Wei Yee school. Lung and Keung's sifu Master Tien soon finds out of this deception and this betrayal leads to Keung leaving the school. After an impassioned plea from Lung, Tien gives Lung his blessing to find his brother. Jackie takes his big white fan (important plot point.) Jing looks for work at the Wei Yee school, but is turned down when he is found to have helped the Wei Yee school win the Lion Dance competition. He is then recruited with two others, including Fung Hark-On (aka Fung Ke-An who was the martial arts consultant with Jackie) who has a large mole on his face - reminiscent of Jackie's mole in Police Woman, to free Master Kim (Hapkido expert Whang In Shik.) Jing uses his big white fan to help Kim escape. So Ah would later be mistaken for his brother and sought after by the local police inspector and his son (played by Hong Kong regulars Shih Kien and Yuen Biao.) This would lead up to an awesome fight scene between two of the Seven Little Fortunes, Yuen and Jackie. Yuen would expertly use a bench and you get to see Jackie use a pole again.Even with the continuity problems (even admitted by Jackie, including one scene where Jackie is fettered and the next he is not) and the overuse of sped-up footage and zoom shots (including one that is parodied in Kung Pow), this is a fun film to watch.. The high points of this movie are the Cantonese comedy and the sublime martial art scenes. In those fight scenes you get to see him use many props such as sword, pole, bench and even a skirt, a skill he learns from his encounter with the Police Chief's daughter played by Lily Li. The high point of the film is a showdown that involves an 18-minute plus scene between Jackie and Whang (Jackie in his autobiography ""I Am Jackie Chan"" considers this his ninth best fight scene.) I do not want to describe this sagacious scene too much, because it has to be seen. I will say that I have never seen Jackie get beat up so much in any other movie and most of it is shot with wide-angle lenses with few cuts. Even his solution to winning is unique.This movie is a must buy for Jackie Chan or Hong Kong film fans. The most important decision in buying this film on DVD is what label/version you purchase. There are many shorter versions out there, even several that are widescreen, but the scenes that are taken out are mostly from the action scenes! But, Fortune Star puts out a 106 minute version that is digitally remastered and has the Cantonese (along with dubbed version) audio. Though there is one caveat, many of the cheaper versions have a huge benefit that the Fortune Star DVD does not - Jackie Chan singing in English at the end of the film. Even without that benefit the Fortune Star release is by far the best version of an excellent Jackie Chan film.",4,A must have for Jackie Chan fans!,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,3789,"['Jackie', 'Chan', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'box', 'office', 'champion', '1978', 'Drunken', 'Master', '1979', 'Fearless', 'Hyena', 'was', 'not', 'getting', 'fiscal', 'due', 'Lo', 'Wei', 'Productions', 'opted', 'contract', 'Lo', 'Wei', 'was', 'hired', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'Young', 'Master', 'was', 'first', 'picture', 'studio', 'film', 'was', 'interrupted', 'several', 'times', 'contract', 'dispute', 'Lo', 'Triad', 'wanted', 'stake', 'Jackie', 'fortune', 'was', 'eventually', 'settled', 'help', 'Jimmy', 'Wang', 'Yu', 'whom', 'Jackie', 'would', 'owe', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'several', 'favors', 'Even', 'chaos', 'Jackie', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'create', 'memorable', 'must-have', 'film', 'movie', 'marked', 'continuity', 'problems.Jackie', 'stars', 'Ah', 'Lung', 'mediocre', 'student', 'funny', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'film', 'point', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'who', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'lion', 'dance', 'competition', 'fellow', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Jing', 'Keung', 'Wei', 'Pei', 'faked', 'injury', 'competed', 'incognito', 'Wei', 'Yee', 'school', 'Lung', 'Keung', 'sifu', 'Master', 'Tien', 'soon', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'Keung', 'leaving', 'school', 'impassioned', 'plea', 'Lung', 'Tien', 'Lung', 'blessing', 'find', 'brother', 'Jackie', 'big', 'white', 'fan', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'Jing', 'looks', 'work', 'Wei', 'Yee', 'school', 'turned', 'down', 'when', 'found', 'have', 'helped', 'Wei', 'Yee', 'school', 'win', 'Lion', 'Dance', 'competition', 'then', 'recruited', 'two', 'others', 'including', 'Fung', 'Hark-On', 'aka', 'Fung', 'Ke-An', 'who', 'was', 'martial', 'arts', 'consultant', 'Jackie', 'who', 'large', 'mole', 'face', 'reminiscent', 'Jackie', 'mole', 'Police', 'Woman', 'free', 'Master', 'Kim', 'Hapkido', 'expert', 'Whang', 'Shik', 'Jing', 'big', 'white', 'fan', 'help', 'Kim', 'escape', 'Ah', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'mistaken', 'brother', 'sought', 'local', 'police', 'inspector', 'son', 'played', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Shih', 'Kien', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'would', 'lead', 'up', 'awesome', 'fight', 'scene', 'two', 'Seven', 'Little', 'Fortunes', 'Yuen', 'Jackie', 'Yuen', 'would', 'expertly', 'use', 'bench', 'get', 'see', 'Jackie', 'use', 'pole', 'again.Even', 'continuity', 'problems', 'even', 'admitted', 'Jackie', 'including', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Jackie', 'fettered', 'next', 'not', 'overuse', 'sped-up', 'footage', 'zoom', 'shots', 'including', 'one', 'parodied', 'Kung', 'Pow', 'fun', 'film', 'watch..', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'Cantonese', 'comedy', 'sublime', 'martial', 'art', 'scenes', 'fight', 'scenes', 'get', 'see', 'use', 'many', 'props', 'such', 'sword', 'pole', 'bench', 'even', 'skirt', 'skill', 'encounter', 'Police', 'Chief', 'daughter', 'played', 'Lily', 'Li', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'showdown', '18-minute', 'scene', 'Jackie', 'Whang', 'Jackie', 'autobiography', 'Am', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'ninth', 'best', 'fight', 'scene', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'describe', 'sagacious', 'scene', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'seen', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Jackie', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'movie', 'most', 'shot', 'wide-angle', 'lenses', 'few', 'cuts', 'Even', 'solution', 'winning', 'unique.This', 'movie', 'must', 'buy', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'fans', 'most', 'important', 'decision', 'buying', 'film', 'DVD', 'what', 'label/version', 'purchase', 'are', 'many', 'shorter', 'versions', 'there', 'even', 'several', 'are', 'widescreen', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'are', 'mostly', 'action', 'Fortune', 'Star', 'out', '106', 'minute', 'version', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'Cantonese', 'dubbed', 'version', 'audio', 'one', 'caveat', 'many', 'cheaper', 'versions', 'have', 'huge', 'benefit', 'Fortune', 'Star', 'DVD', 'not', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'singing', 'English', 'end', 'film', 'Even', 'benefit', 'Fortune', 'Star', 'release', 'far', 'best', 'version', 'excellent', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film']",Young Master

This is a must-have for any Jackie Chan fan.",5,excellent Jackie Chan flick,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,358,"['one', 'Jackie', 'best', 'movies', 'opinion', 'got', 'great', 'kung', 'fu', 'plot', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'action', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'minute', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'next', 'great', 'see', 'Jackie', ""'little"", 'brother', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'performing', 'flawlessly', 'together', 'must-have', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fan']",Young Master
455349,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6305234965,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","The Young Master was Jackie Chan's directorial debut, and a quarter of a century on it looks a lot less groundbreaking than it once did. In fact, much of the first hour is terrible, feeling like one of those old Shaw Brothers films filled with crash zooms and elaborately choreographed ""a-one-and-a-two"" fight scenes where the stunt men are more interested in striking stances and hitting their marks than looking like they're actually trying to hit each other. In many ways, it's almost a transitional picture between the old formal, theatrical and wildly unconvincing style and the more believable let's-try-to-make-it-look-like-we're-actually-trying-to-hurt-each-other style of more modern Hong Kong action movies. What that means is that a lot of it is unfortunately both unconvincing and dull. Just when you're ready to throw in the towel and are desperately trying to think of who you can fob the DVD onto as a Christmas present, it suddenly comes alive in the last half hour with two great fight sequences - one in which Chan takes on group of crooks, the other a 17-minute dust-up with Whong In Sik that really works incredibly well despite offering no more than the two fighters on Tiger Mountain with a comic relief sidekick acting as referee/second. There's also some fun to be had working out where the film's score comes from. As with most Hong Kong movies of the period, it's mostly a `name that tune' pick-and-mix lifted from the studio's record collection, with Bernard Herrmann's Obsession and Holst's The Planets topping the most played list at Golden Harvest that month. Heavy going, but definitely worth it for that last half hour.",3,"Often heavy going, but worth it for the finale",1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,1651,"['Young', 'Master', 'was', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'directorial', 'debut', 'quarter', 'century', 'lot', 'less', 'groundbreaking', 'once', 'did', 'fact', 'much', 'first', 'hour', 'terrible', 'feeling', 'one', 'old', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'films', 'filled', 'crash', 'zooms', 'elaborately', 'choreographed', 'a-one-and-a-two', 'fight', 'scenes', 'where', 'stunt', 'men', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'striking', 'stances', 'hitting', 'marks', 'looking', ""'re"", 'actually', 'trying', 'hit', 'other', 'many', 'ways', 'almost', 'transitional', 'picture', 'old', 'formal', 'theatrical', 'wildly', 'unconvincing', 'style', 'more', 'believable', ""let's-try-to-make-it-look-like-we're-actually-trying-to-hurt-each-other"", 'style', 'more', 'modern', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'movies', 'What', 'lot', 'unfortunately', 'unconvincing', 'dull', 'Just', 'when', ""'re"", 'ready', 'throw', 'towel', 'are', 'desperately', 'trying', 'think', 'who', 'can', 'fob', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'present', 'suddenly', 'alive', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'two', 'great', 'fight', 'sequences', 'one', 'Chan', 'group', 'crooks', 'other', '17-minute', 'dust-up', 'Whong', 'Sik', 'really', 'incredibly', 'well', 'offering', 'more', 'two', 'fighters', 'Tiger', 'Mountain', 'comic', 'relief', 'sidekick', 'acting', 'referee/second', 'also', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'working', 'out', 'where', 'film', 'score', 'most', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'movies', 'period', 'mostly', 'name', 'tune', 'pick-and-mix', 'lifted', 'studio', 'record', 'collection', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'Obsession', 'Holst', 'Planets', 'topping', 'most', 'played', 'list', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'month', 'Heavy', 'going', 'definitely', 'worth', 'last', 'half', 'hour']",Young Master
