Alternating between the witness stand and the reenactment of the recall of the plaintiff, the film focuses on the life of Josie Aimes, (Charlize Theron) with her groundbreaking story of sexual harassment. Living on the iron range of Minnesota, the lifestyle of everyone bears all the elements with true grit. Josie, who finds her ex- unbearable and living under her parents' roof with her two children slightly less so, is prompted by a friend at her hair salon to join her in a (near) precedent setting employment as a female miner. Under unbearable competition from overseas, the men have enough that they can handle, but truly lose all sense of humanity as they humiliate their female members with lewd comments, childish pranks, and unwanted advances. With a fellow female staff that is calloused enough to take it, Josie, faultlessly more thin-skinned, decides she's had enough. Trying to turn the tide from the ""he-said/she said"" debacle paralleled in the Anita Hill/ Clarence Thomas hearings, she gets her turn. Can she set the precedent? Will anyone join her? Will anyone represent her?'North Country' keeps a sense of growing tension by telling its story well. Punctuated by excellent performances, tense and laidback in perfect measure, Charlize Theron, Woody Harrelson, Sissy Spacek, et al, really ring true. Frances McDormand, whose acting abilities seldom strike twice, returns to her perfect Minnesotan accent albeit in a different personality. Timing and screenplay truly shine. Gustavo Santaolalla's score and the soundtrack (featuring) Bob Dylan's songs contribute lovably rugged terrain to all the proceedings.",4,The Compass Points North Toward Compassion,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1779,"['Thinking', ""'North"", 'Country', 'would', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'so', 'involved', 'thick', 'gripping', 'gender', 'drama', 'Alternating', 'witness', 'stand', 'reenactment', 'recall', 'plaintiff', 'film', 'life', 'Josie', 'Aimes', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'groundbreaking', 'story', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'Living', 'iron', 'range', 'Minnesota', 'lifestyle', 'everyone', 'bears', 'elements', 'true', 'grit', 'Josie', 'who', 'ex-', 'unbearable', 'living', 'parents', 'roof', 'two', 'children', 'slightly', 'less', 'so', 'prompted', 'friend', 'hair', 'salon', 'join', 'precedent', 'setting', 'employment', 'female', 'miner', 'unbearable', 'competition', 'overseas', 'men', 'have', 'enough', 'can', 'handle', 'truly', 'lose', 'sense', 'humanity', 'humiliate', 'female', 'members', 'lewd', 'comments', 'childish', 'pranks', 'unwanted', 'advances', 'fellow', 'female', 'staff', 'calloused', 'enough', 'take', 'Josie', 'faultlessly', 'more', 'thin-skinned', 'had', 'enough', 'Trying', 'turn', 'tide', 'he-said/she', 'said', 'debacle', 'paralleled', 'Anita', 'Hill/', 'Clarence', 'Thomas', 'hearings', 'turn', 'Can', 'set', 'precedent', 'Will', 'anyone', 'join', 'Will', 'anyone', 'represent', ""'North"", 'Country', 'sense', 'growing', 'tension', 'telling', 'story', 'well', 'Punctuated', 'excellent', 'performances', 'tense', 'laidback', 'perfect', 'measure', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'et', 'al', 'really', 'ring', 'true', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'acting', 'abilities', 'seldom', 'strike', 'twice', 'returns', 'perfect', 'Minnesotan', 'accent', 'albeit', 'different', 'personality', 'Timing', 'screenplay', 'truly', 'shine', 'Gustavo', 'Santaolalla', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'contribute', 'lovably', 'rugged', 'terrain', 'proceedings']",N/A
960484,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000CQLZ8S,A Customer,"[3, 4]","Fleeing an abusive relationship, Minnesota mother of two, Josey Aimes packs her bags and in desperation goes to stay with her parents. Her father Hank (Richard Jenkins) - a mineworker - is angry and resentful at Josey for getting herself pregnant at sixteen, meanwhile, Alice (Sissy Spacek), her mother, is far more accepting of her daughters shortcomings, welcoming her back into the household.Looking for ways to support herself and her children and eager to earn some ""real"" money, Josie is talked into getting a job at the local mine by her friend Glory (Frances McDormand). The owners have only reluctantly begun hiring women and Josie is warned that the work will be hard, and that the men will most likely resent her, the majority of them firmly believing that women don't belong on the job.Josie is appalled by the horrors and sexual harassment that her and her fellow coworkers must endure. Strong willed and defiant, Josie does all she can to stand up to the men, but she soon discovers that no one is willing to join her in any sort of organized protest. And when she goes to the head of the company to make her complaints known, she finds out that this misogynistic mentality comes straight from the top.Feeling she has no other options, Josie eventually begins considering legal action against the company, and enlists the help of lawyer Bill White (Woody Harrelson), as she attempts to stand up for her right to work and make a living on equal terms with the men.North Country is a rousing, earnest film; and is most notable, not just for Ms. Theron's gritty and nuanced performance, but also for the victorious and contentious subject matter. It's impossible not to get caught up in Josie's plight and really feel for her as she and the other women are forced to keep quiet as the men demean, mock and intimidate them by painting sexual slogans on walls and ""feeling them up"" any chance they can get.Niki Caro's direction is strong and candid and Michael Seitzman's screenplay is naturalistic, bringing to life the world of blue collar mine workers. The first half of the film certainly does a good job of setting up the environment as Josie enters the mines and showing how daunting it all feels and how strong she must be from the get go.It's just a pity that the film begins to fall apart in the second act. Several subplots are introduced which do nothing to advance the movie's main agenda; consequently as Josie begins her lawsuit, the movie begins to feel increasingly strained, obvious and heavy-handed. North Country also suffers from being a little too long, and the film would probably have benefited from some sharper editing. Lets face it; we get enough overview shots of the mines to get the idea that they're pretty dirty and dismal places to work.Still, this is a good film about the efforts of a common and working class woman who must go to extraordinary lengths to fight back in a male dominated system. This is also one of Charlize Theron's best films, and while the supporting players are all outstanding, it is her resolute performance, which really holds this film together. She's utterly convincing as Josie, a woman who just wants to make an honest living.Theron manages to convey a quiet resolve, even in the courtroom scenes in which her character doesn't speak that much. Josie is a woman who's been blindsided by certain events in her life; she never wanted to go too such lengths to stand up for herself, but when the crunch comes, she is not willing not hold anything back. And her victory is indeed an ultimate victory for all women.

960487,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000CQLZ8S,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 3]","Despite being preachy and slow, North Country still manages to tell its essentially true story in a moving and compelling manner.  This is another standout performance from Charlize Theron, the South African beauty who took the world by storm in Monster.  Theron stunned the public by gaining a considerable amount of weight and looking as unattractive as possible (for her) to give the role harsh authenticity.  In North Country we see her in overalls, safety glasses, and hardhat, covered with grime, however, her celebrated good looks are intact.  This detail is important.  Having spent a considerable amount of time in the Appalachian coal-mining region of Eastern Kentucky I can tell you that the women who choose this line of work are invariably indistinguishable from New York runway models.  At times the sound of pneumatic drills ceases altogether, giving way to gasps of admiration and enthusiastic applause as these goddess-like sylphs stride grandly past the pit cars, occasionally blinded by the flashing of helmet lights.  Not.Director Niki Caro gave us Whale Rider, which is close to film perfection and should not be missed.  It too celebrates female independence and determination but succeeds more unequivocally because it places the story first and the lesson second.  That said, North Country works on many levels.  First, it takes you somewhere you will never go, the sense of place is simply overwhelming and the horror of strip mining provides a larger than life, visually compelling context.  Next, there is an inherent and disturbing truth about the male/female interaction in this film.  Men either will, or should, notice a distinct whiff of eau-de-locker-room.  Confronting one's own bigotry and prejudice, especially when directed at a majority group (rather than a minority group for a change), is never pleasant, and the fight for equal rights is the driving wheel of North Country.  Viewers will be very surprised to learn how recently this case was settled.Perhaps the best thing about how the story develops is that Josey (Theron) is an accidental rabble-rouser, pushed into advocacy by circumstance.  She only wants what everyone wants, the opportunity to work, to live, to make an honorable home for her children.  When the abominable behavior of her co-workers, and the community at large, makes this impossible, she chooses to stand rather than flee.  At times her innocence is heartbreaking, as when she goes to see the company President.  The ""overnight conversion"" of her father, pivotal to the story, seemed a bit facile, but this is a movie, not a documentary.  Seeing Sissy Spacek is a pleasure, and Frances McDormand gives yet another stellar performance.  Woody Harrelson is well on his way to convincing me that he's not just ""that idiot from Cheers,"" half-a-dozen more good performances should do it.  Theron, of course, is the linchpin, and she does a wonderful job from beginning to end.  There is a scene late in the film where she is talking to her son that, in addition to moving you, provides ample evidence supporting her status as one of the finest actresses working today.  Ultimately an uplifting movie predicated on the idea that fear, not intrinsic evil, is the force usually preventing people from doing the right thing.",4,Boys Will Be Swine,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,3282,"['being', 'preachy', 'slow', 'North', 'Country', 'still', 'tell', 'essentially', 'true', 'story', 'moving', 'compelling', 'manner', 'standout', 'performance', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'South', 'African', 'beauty', 'who', 'took', 'world', 'storm', 'Monster', 'Theron', 'stunned', 'public', 'gaining', 'considerable', 'amount', 'weight', 'looking', 'as', 'unattractive', 'possible', 'give', 'role', 'harsh', 'authenticity', 'North', 'Country', 'see', 'overalls', 'safety', 'glasses', 'hardhat', 'covered', 'grime', 'however', 'celebrated', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'intact', 'detail', 'important', 'Having', 'spent', 'considerable', 'amount', 'time', 'Appalachian', 'coal-mining', 'region', 'Eastern', 'Kentucky', 'can', 'tell', 'women', 'who', 'choose', 'line', 'work', 'are', 'invariably', 'indistinguishable', 'New', 'York', 'runway', 'models', 'times', 'sound', 'pneumatic', 'drills', 'altogether', 'giving', 'way', 'gasps', 'admiration', 'enthusiastic', 'applause', 'goddess-like', 'sylphs', 'stride', 'grandly', 'pit', 'cars', 'occasionally', 'blinded', 'flashing', 'helmet', 'lights', 'Not.Director', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'gave', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'close', 'film', 'perfection', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'too', 'female', 'independence', 'determination', 'more', 'unequivocally', 'story', 'first', 'lesson', 'second', 'said', 'North', 'Country', 'many', 'levels', 'First', 'somewhere', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'sense', 'place', 'simply', 'overwhelming', 'horror', 'strip', 'mining', 'larger', 'life', 'visually', 'compelling', 'context', 'Next', 'inherent', 'disturbing', 'truth', 'male/female', 'interaction', 'film', 'Men', 'will', 'should', 'notice', 'distinct', 'whiff', 'eau-de-locker-room', 'Confronting', 'one', 'own', 'bigotry', 'prejudice', 'especially', 'when', 'directed', 'majority', 'group', 'rather', 'minority', 'group', 'change', 'never', 'pleasant', 'fight', 'equal', 'rights', 'driving', 'wheel', 'North', 'Country', 'Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'surprised', 'learn', 'how', 'recently', 'case', 'was', 'settled.Perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'how', 'story', 'Josey', 'Theron', 'accidental', 'rabble-rouser', 'pushed', 'advocacy', 'circumstance', 'only', 'what', 'everyone', 'opportunity', 'work', 'live', 'make', 'honorable', 'home', 'children', 'When', 'abominable', 'behavior', 'co-workers', 'community', 'large', 'impossible', 'stand', 'rather', 'flee', 'times', 'innocence', 'heartbreaking', 'when', 'see', 'company', 'President', 'overnight', 'conversion', 'father', 'pivotal', 'story', 'seemed', 'bit', 'facile', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'Seeing', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'pleasure', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'yet', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'well', 'way', 'convincing', 'not', 'just', 'idiot', 'Cheers', 'half-a-dozen', 'more', 'good', 'performances', 'should', 'do', 'Theron', 'course', 'linchpin', 'wonderful', 'job', 'beginning', 'end', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'talking', 'son', 'addition', 'moving', 'ample', 'evidence', 'supporting', 'status', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'working', 'today', 'Ultimately', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'predicated', 'idea', 'fear', 'not', 'intrinsic', 'evil', 'force', 'usually', 'preventing', 'people', 'doing', 'right', 'thing']",N/A

960489,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000CQLZ8S,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","It's true that `North Country' sports a weighty message; but it is also true, very true, that for the most part that heavy message manages to feel light.  A lot of directors struggle with finding a balance between sentiment and saccharine; between weighty importance and muddy self-importance.  Some directors have made a career out of defining this genre or brand of drama (take Ron Howard and Penny Marshall for instance) and yet still others have attempted and failed at the very same feat.  In this regard, director Niki Caro succeeds; to an extent.`North Country' never feels too thick.The film tells the true story (or at least the parts they want to tell) of a young woman pushed the brink of her tolerance who is eventually forced to take action against those persecuting her.  Josey Aimes has had a bad life.  She got pregnant while still in high school, has pretty much been disowned by her father and has just left her abusive husband, toting her two young children back to mom and dads house.  In an attempt to get her life in order she takes a job up at the mine, doing man's work, and quickly finds that the abuse she faces at the workplace is just as severe and almost more degrading than anything she faced with her ex-husband.  As she struggles through each and every day of work she comes home to a family that shuns her, a son that hates her, a father that blames her for everything and a town that is growing tired of her complaints.  She has no where to turn, but when things get too extreme on the workfront she decides to take the matter to the courts.The true story that inspired this film is truly groundbreaking for it managed to pave the way for better work environments for women and men alike.  This is a very important story to tell, and for the most part the story is told well.My only issue with `North Country' is that at times it felt overly simple.  It was just this feeling I got while watching the majority of the film; this feeling that there had to be more to this story.  It kind of felt a little like a television movie, like a lifetime movie even.  It was weighty yet felt airy in many scenes and that feeling tended to drag on for some time.  The film picked up major pace as the inevitable conclusion came peering around the corner, and the courtroom scenes and flashbacks that fill in a few gaps are startling and heartbreaking, but they feel almost like too little too late.  The film tries to serve up sentiment with the side story of Glory, Josey's friend, and her illness but it feels like just that, a side story.The acting is generally very good and at times even great.  A lot of people claim that Charlize Theron's Oscar nomination was ridiculous and undeserved, but I actually found her performance to be utterly unforgettable.  My only wish is that she had held on to her accent throughout the entire film.  There are some scenes (particularly with McDormand, who we know has perfected the accent from `Fargo') where her accent is spot on perfection, and if she had held it in every scene then her performance may even rival her Oscar winning `Monster' perf.  The rest of the acting is good; Richard Jenkins, Sean Bean and Woody Harrelson serving up the best performances in the bunch.  Jeremy Renner is convincing as the sleaze-ball town slacker and Sissy Spacek is touching as Josey's concerned mother.  I have to say that I love Frances McDormand, but her performance is nothing special.  She has an illness and the Academy obviously went crazy for that, but her nomination seemed kind of lazy to me, especially when you consider all of the actresses who delivered brilliant performances that same year (Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scarlett Johansson).

Morris ""BeansMommy""","[1, 1]","As always, Charlize Theron gives a spectacular performance.She is one of a handful of women in a Iron/steel mine in Minnesota, where the majority of the workers are men.She and the other women have to tolerate the sexual abuse, which starts out to be verbal, then turns to defacing property  and finally turns to physical assult.After finally being able to take no more abuse, she finally walks out and quits her job, and this is where the drama really gets ugly.The story shows all this womans struggles, to fight for her rights as a human being , but she needs more than her word alone. She needs her ex-coworkers to stand up with her against the company , and this is where the whole town turns it's back on her.She is forced to fight this fight alone, and it is so very sad.Of course the other women are afraid of losing thier jobs, but the way she is shunned is painful to watch.We see her demonized by the company's attorney (a woman) and her reputation drug through the mud.This movie probably is not for everyone, because of the serious issues it covers (the discrimination, a rape, and other touchy subjects) It just is a movie I think that more mature audiences would appreciate. A younger person probably would think it drawn out or boring. It is just serious subject matter , and not fun to watch, but the performances are fantastic.It especially got to me when Charlize's Father spoke up for her in the union meeting.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I really want to believe North Country is an exaggeration concerning a group of women trying to make a living and support their family in the northern snow-filled Minnesota mining industry, and that having to deal with men who are incredibly disrespectful towards them is not the least bit true.  I don't want to believe men are capable of such heartless aggression and hostility towards the women we associate with.  Apparently however, the story being told here is all too real and significant for women having the right to do the same things as men, and what a hard movie it is to watch as a result.As a man I'm not comfortable seeing anybody being ganged up on by others, especially when women are the ones who are the victims.  But that's exactly what North Country does- it reveals the ignorance and pushiness of men that women are forced to persevere when they step into an environment usually considered a place for men to make a living.  The movie doesn't hold anything back either.Charlize Theron plays a magnificent role as a woman who struggles to deal with the brutal environment of having men control and run a mining establishment.  It's unfortunate that apparently the men are so hateful and worried that this group of women might take their jobs away from them, that they feel the need to treat the ladies like total garbage.  Some of the humiliation they put the women through is hard to stomach.  The attitude just screams immaturity and selfishness to the fullest extent and the women are the ones who have to suffer.Let me mention a few things you will see in case you think I'm exaggerating the severity of the situation- the male workers smear their own feces on bathroom walls and expect the women to clean it up, one man grabs the beautiful Charlize by the neck and throws her down to the ground (this is because she threatens to take serious legal action against them when she's finally had enough of the abuse), and the worst one of all- they wait until Charlize steps inside a porta potty and pushes it over.  Don't forget the situation where's she up high and concered one of her male employees is going to push her over the edge of a metal railing making her fear for her life.  All the while she gets called disrespectful names by several people around town and her female employees fear the worst so they remain quiet.But nothing NOTHING can prepare viewers for the one moment that seriously brought me to tears.  She was raped when she was younger by her teacher, and they actually show this segment is really graphic detail.  It's unbearable to watch.  This scene is just about enough to consider switching the movie off, seriously.In the beginning of the movie I felt Charlize's character was unusually out of line and angry towards her family, but now that we've seen the events she has to live with on a daily basis and the sexual abuse she had to deal with when she was younger, her attitude towards life is totally understandable.  She has a right to be bitter.  Her courageous efforts to continue working with those horrible men is respectable and VERY brave.  She tries to make a stand and not be effected by anything standing in her way despite all the tears.  Gotta respect someone who's got the guts to do what she did.You can pretty much guess what this film is about- Charlize Theron takes legal action against the mining company to allow women and men to work together without any problems.  That's her goal here.  What a moving story.

Then, in 1984, Lois Jenson (on whom the main character of Josie Aimes is based) filed the first sexual harassment class action suit ever against her mine employers, beginning an extremely long and difficult court case.  Fourteen years later, the judges' rulings eventually resulted in landmark changes in sexual harassment laws in Minnesota. I love this film because the writers, director and actors capture the absolute truth of the characters and the events they lived. They also render a fairly long book into an amazingly well-crafted, moving and inspiring 2-hour film. Both McDormand and Theron deserved the Oscar and didn't win - and I haven't watched the Academy Awards since. It's difficult to watch at times, but WELL worth it.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 3]","NORTH COUNTRY is a story we've heard many times before: small-town person is persecuted by big-time company, fights, loses ground, but in the end succeeds. This is ERIN BROKOVICH and SILKWOOD all over again, but put in a sort of COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER setting (we even get to see Sissy Spacek!) Although this film focuses on the case that ultimately set the stage for the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace, the movie's message dwarfed the actors.One thing I love about films - if done right - is they get us up-close and intimate with a character or characters. CAPOTE did it. RAY did too. And WALK THE LINE was also excellently done. They focused on one character and so had that advantage, but NORTH COUNTRY is about one woman, too, named Josey Aimes played by the uglied-down (again!) Charlize Theron (AEON FLUX). Mrs. Theron has proven her metal thanks to her stunning portrayal (and Oscar win) in MONSTER. We've all heard the accolades thrown down at her feet, so I won't bother you with a recap. Suffice to say she did an excellent job. Here in NORTH COUNTRY she also did some fine acting, but the script dashed any chances of reclaiming an Oscar. Frances McDormand (also in AEON FLUX) is notable as the hard-bitten friend who gets Josey Aimes the job at the local mine. McDormand's tough love appearance on screen was well-played, and her eventual fall into Lou Gehrig's Disease pitiable.The filming of NORTH COUNTRY is pulled off well, too. The muted grays, dark browns, and dull colors of the mine give us the feel of a black and white film. As one actress pointed out in the DVD's extra features, ""There weren't any pinks in the mine.""Where the film fell apart, again, was in the script. Jumping to flashbacks and trying to capture the family dynamic, the townsfolk sentiments, and dozens of other side stories all pulled the viewer away from the main character and tried to force-feed us the no-no's of sexual harassment. I'm not trying to downplay harassment in the workplace. It's an important message, but one that doesn't necessarily translate to an enjoyable film experience. For example, with the exception of Woody Harrelson, all the other minor characters are easily forgettable (and I suspect the only reason I remember Woody that well is because I was a CHEERS fan).You'll note below that Charlize Theron and Frances McDormand both got quite a few nominations but won none of them.

There's so much drama and supense to this film that it captures you're interest the moment it starts.Notice: This film is not Dukes of Hazzard. Therefore: it will be entertaining, it will be realistic and it will be dramatic, it will make you think, it won't be stupid, it won't have any cheesy moments or idiotic characters and it will get nominated for Oscars.Charlize Theron plays Josey Aimes, a woman who doesn't have alot of respect from anyone, who's been raped before and the worst of it is, no one believes her because there was no one around... apparently. There's alot of tense scenes, alot of the guys in this film are pretty one-dimensional but they are supposed to be. These guys don't actually know any better and they think she's just a slut. Kind of like her son. He has all the hate in the world for her even though he doesn't realize what a terrific person she is if someone was just nice to her for five minutes. It just seems so hard for Josey to find a nice guy or girl to be at least friends with. I've never seen anyone struggle so hard. Maybe cause it's a movie but the reality is, it's very possible. There are lots of negative people in the world and the fact that this was based on a true story means that it did happen and it's possible that there's more people out there who feel the same as her. Rape is a serious issue and this movie is not a joke like Dukes of Hazzard. Anyone who doesn't like this film probably likes stupid movies like that and would probably be bored.

960501,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000CQLZ8S,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","This is a very good movie with a brilliant and powerful performance (yet again) by Charlize Theron.  Here she plays a complicated woman named Josie Aimes.  While the movie was inspired by the real life lawsuit filed by Lois Jenson, the character and story are fictionalized.  Likely to make the story more inspiring.  However, I think the basic reality behind such suits is plenty inspiring.  In any case, this is a terrific movie.The movie opens with Josie on the stand being grilled by a female attorney for the company.  Since Josie was an unwed teenage mother, the company's attorney uses that to undermine her credibility.  Then the movie shows us Josie on the kitchen floor and as she gets up, from the blood we can see she has been horribly assaulted.  She takes her two children and moves home with her parents.  Her father shows his lack of faith and support for his daughter by asking if her husband hat laid hands on her because he found her with another man.I don't want to expose the plot of the movie because it is powerful and you should see it.  My mother worked in factories as I was growing up when most women did not work outside the home.  There was some of the notion that women were taking men's jobs.  However, a lot of that was weakened during WWII.  The idea that women belonged in certain jobs and not others was indeed very strong.  Even within factories.The forceful point this movie makes is that a job is a job and people, men or women and of any color or ethnic group, should not have to face the kinds of abuse depicted in this film (and in real life it can be much worse).  Yes, there are requirements for jobs, but one should not have to go through a fight to the death to land or hold a job.I am glad that Josie (and especially the real life women) had the courage to stand up to the pressure and social ostracism she had to face to take care of her two kids.  In the movie she had NO support; except from her mother (touchingly played by Sissy Spacek) and the friend who got her in the mine, Glory (strongly played by Frances McDormand).  Eventually, she meets an old local hockey star who is also a semi-burnt out lawyer named Bill White (Woody Harrelson's most enjoyable performance in a long time) who helps her bring her suit.  He brings it not so much because he believes in her cause, but because a class-action sexual harassment suit has never been brought successfully.The women who suffer with Josie actually resent her standing up to the vile abuse.  And it isn't just a bit of catcalling.  No, it is also many other kinds of abuse.  One particularly vile act is done to Sherry (very well portrayed by Michelle Monaghan).  The men resent that the women have gotten porta-johns put on the worksite.  When Sherry goes into one that has already been well used, the men start banging on the side and rocking it and finally tip it over with her in it.  Yet the women take it because they are told to, because they have to provide for their families, and they realize that standing up will provoke greater attacks.  What they don't believe is that they can stand up enough to stop it.  The difference is that Josie, alone, believes that she can get it to stop.Another performance, that holds the key to the movie, I think, is Josie's father, Hank (with a solid performance by Richard Jenkins).  He is man caught up in the nightmarish ""brotherhood"" at the mine, but doesn't agree with it.  Josie's apparent waywardness has made his life harder from the social disdain it draws and the disappointment he feels.  He has withdrawn emotionally from Josie and even closed off from his wife.  He feels incredibly weak and just wants to get through life.  Then Josie comes to the mine and makes his life even more miserable even while she is living under his roof.  He has choices to make, and what he chooses to do helps the story unfold.The movie is touching and makes its point well.  I particularly like the way the movie has a way of letting you know exactly what happened without having to show the violence and the ugliest events too explicitly.  The movie is R-rated and I know many of my friends eschew R-rated movies for good reason.  However, I will argue that there are two broad categories of R-rated movies.The first group that should be ignored is the group of films that depict sex and violence to excite and indulge.  The other kind is R-rated the way seeing a friend with cancer is R-rated, the way real life can be R-rated.  This is that kind of movie.  The language, while rough, is not nearly as vile as it can be in a factory, at a mine, or any industrial operation.  And there is a depiction of some particularly sad and horrible events that are there because they are real, and they help us understand Josie and what she really faced and why what happened to her was all wrong.  I think this movie is very much worth seeing and recommend it despite its R-rating.The one thing about the movie I found a bit confusing and bit irritating is its vague time reference.  In real life, the suit brought by these women was settled in 1991.  However, the movie seems to depict the movie in the 1970s when women first went into the mines in Minnesota.  However, several times in the movie, Anita Hill is shown on TV in a completely unnecessary and ham-fisted bit of politicizing.  But this is a small irritation compared to the very fine things this movie says about fairness and justice in the workplace.",5,Going to work should NOT be a death cage fight.,1141257600,"03 2,

We are told this movie is based on a true story--a landmark sexual harassment case that revolutionized corporate policy pertaining to gender equality nationwide.  Disgusted and put out with the relentless, abusive, even violent treatment by her male coworkers (and superiors) in the male-dominated ore mining industry, single mom Josey Aimes (played wonderfully by Charlize Theron) dares to rock the boat by filing a lawsuit against her employer.  It's a story that's been told a million times before--of one individual fighting fearlessly, even futilely, against the insurmountable odds of the corrupt status quo--yet NORTH COUNTRY succeeds admirably by virtue of its stellar cast and compelling plot.Returning to her hometown after her marriage goes on the fritz, Josey dares to seek employment at the local strip mine, where the work is brutal, but the working conditions even more so.  Her best friend, Glory (Frances McDormand), is a coworker--even the sole female union rep; Glory advises Josey to go with the flow, let the crude comments and sick jokes roll off one's back, but in due time, the ""jokes"" become malevolent, the pranks vicious, the work environment dangerous, intolerable.  Josey files a grievance with the president of the company; his response is to pressure her to tender her resignation.  Convinced she is ""in the right,"" that she must fight, Josey enlists the aid of local attorney Bill White (Woody Harrelson, who in middle age has become magnificently bulldog ugly), and the first-ever class action sexual harassment suit is filed.  The subsequent courtroom drama is uneven, often off topic (having to deal with an alleged rape in Josey's past), yet still riveting.Sean Bean, Sissy Spacek, and Jeremy Renner are three jewels that head an outstanding supporting cast, but special kudos go to Richard Jenkins as Josey's brooding father.  Hank Aimes, a longtime employee of the mine, has been estranged from his daughter since she gave birth out of wedlock as a teenager.  He is opposed to her taking a job at his company, and as the pranks and sick jokes escalate, he remains silent.  Yet once his daughter addresses his union brethren--alone and very much afraid--he comes to Josey's defense in fine fashion.  Made me proud to be a papa.Told from the perspective of the early 1990s, NORTH COUNTRY tells its story, and as good as its story is, it still left me scratching my head.  Back in those days, I, too, was in a male-dominated industry (executive of a trucking company).  Following the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas culture storm, followed by passage of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), we certainly saw the writing on the wall, and instantly adopted sexual harassment policies and walked on eggshells to make sure harassment or wrongful termination claims were never brought to bear against us. So I find it intriguing, to say the least, that in such a climate this particular mining employer was so callous and insensitive.  As the old adage goes, this company was cruisin' for a bruisin', and in the Great White North, you get ice cubes with that.--D.

960506,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000CQLZ8S,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","A subject as vitally important as the landmark class-action sexual harassment case, Lois Jenson v. Eveleth Mines, deserves a better film treatment than the one it gets here. It has the look of a serious drama, but director Niki Caro and screenwriter Michael Seitzman disappoint by throwing in every familiar soap opera cliche possible, especially some extremely sketchy plot developments in the damaging final half-hour. Were it not for the stellar cast, this would surely be a Lifetime TV-movie for all the cardboard dialogue and faux-confrontations that occur between the characters.The plot focuses on Josey Aimes, who escapes her abusive marriage with two kids in tow to her parents' home in northern Minnesota. Barely surviving as a hair washer, she, by chance, runs into her old friend Glory, who works at the local iron mine and convinces Josey to get a job there since she can make six times the money. As one of a handful of women working there, Josey is constantly harassed and humiliated by her male coworkers and demeaned by management to the point of quitting. Inspired by the Anita Hill case going on at the same time, Josey, with the help of settlement-oriented lawyer Bill White, decides to file a lawsuit against the mine and promptly becomes vilified by the town, especially for her purportedly loose sexual behavior.The film's structure is familiar to anyone who has witnessed the central struggles in ""Norma Rae"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and in particular, ""Silkwood"", so the schematic underdog story works to a certain level that in the early going, is highly effective. The harassment scenes have a palpable realism about them. On the plus side, Charlize Theron has become one of the most vibrant, urgent actors onscreen today, and she distills dimensions of candor and heartbreak that transcend the formulaic set-up. Her stunning beauty is not as camouflaged here as in ""Monster"", but she manages to look convincingly worn and beaten by Josey's plight even if her Minnesotan accent drifts in and out. As Glory, Frances McDormand is as exceptional as usual, delivering the emotional grounding and gutsy sense of humor which has become her trademark. Her decline from a debilitating disease is gut-wrenching, but it happens in so choppy and cursory a fashion that it's hard to see why this particular plot point is even introduced.Woody Harrelson has an even more elliptical role as Bill, and while he manages the balance between cynical and sincere with aplomb, he still has that wild-eyed look during the courtroom scenes that I find distracting. Given her impressive caliber, Sissy Spacek is given precious little to do as Josey's put-upon mother, but Richard Jenkins excels as the taciturn father who moves warily toward self-revelation. Sean Bean, in a surprising about-face from his usual villainous roles, empathetically plays Glory's husband Kyle, while James Cada is perfectly venal as the head of the mine.However, for all the wonderful acting, the climax of the film is botched with scenes contrived toward actions that make no sense other than to provide the film an emotionally resonant finish, which ironically wrings hollow as a result. The sparse DVD package has one invaluable extra, a short making-of featurette, ""Stories from the North Country"", which lets us hear from not only the filmmakers but also the real women of the mines who inspired the film, including Jenson. There are deleted scenes, which only provide value in providing a greater sense of context for Glory's physical decent, and there is unfortunately no audio commentary track.",3,Stellar Cast and a Landmark Ruling Almost Redeem Soap Opera Theatrics and Botched Last Quarter,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,3579,"['subject', 'vitally', 'important', 'landmark', 'class-action', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'case', 'Lois', 'Jenson', 'v.', 'Eveleth', 'Mines', 'better', 'film', 'treatment', 'one', 'here', 'look', 'serious', 'drama', 'director', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Seitzman', 'disappoint', 'throwing', 'familiar', 'soap', 'opera', 'cliche', 'possible', 'especially', 'extremely', 'sketchy', 'plot', 'developments', 'damaging', 'final', 'half-hour', 'Were', 'not', 'stellar', 'cast', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'Lifetime', 'TV-movie', 'cardboard', 'dialogue', 'faux-confrontations', 'occur', 'characters.The', 'plot', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'who', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'two', 'kids', 'tow', 'parents', 'home', 'northern', 'Minnesota', 'Barely', 'surviving', 'hair', 'washer', 'chance', 'old', 'friend', 'Glory', 'who', 'local', 'iron', 'mine', 'convinces', 'Josey', 'get', 'job', 'there', 'can', 'make', 'six', 'times', 'money', 'one', 'handful', 'women', 'working', 'there', 'Josey', 'constantly', 'harassed', 'humiliated', 'male', 'coworkers', 'demeaned', 'management', 'point', 'quitting', 'Inspired', 'Anita', 'Hill', 'case', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'Josey', 'help', 'settlement-oriented', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'White', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'mine', 'promptly', 'becomes', 'vilified', 'town', 'especially', 'purportedly', 'loose', 'sexual', 'behavior.The', 'film', 'structure', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'witnessed', 'central', 'struggles', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'particular', 'Silkwood', 'schematic', 'underdog', 'story', 'certain', 'level', 'early', 'going', 'highly', 'effective', 'harassment', 'scenes', 'have', 'palpable', 'realism', 'plus', 'side', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'vibrant', 'urgent', 'actors', 'onscreen', 'today', 'dimensions', 'candor', 'heartbreak', 'transcend', 'formulaic', 'set-up', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'not', 'camouflaged', 'here', 'Monster', 'look', 'convincingly', 'worn', 'beaten', 'Josey', 'plight', 'even', 'Minnesotan', 'accent', 'drifts', 'out', 'Glory', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'as', 'exceptional', 'usual', 'delivering', 'emotional', 'grounding', 'gutsy', 'sense', 'humor', 'become', 'trademark', 'decline', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'gut-wrenching', 'so', 'choppy', 'cursory', 'fashion', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'particular', 'plot', 'point', 'even', 'introduced.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'even', 'more', 'elliptical', 'role', 'Bill', 'balance', 'cynical', 'sincere', 'aplomb', 'still', 'wild-eyed', 'look', 'courtroom', 'find', 'distracting', 'Given', 'impressive', 'caliber', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'given', 'precious', 'little', 'do', 'Josey', 'put-upon', 'mother', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'excels', 'taciturn', 'father', 'who', 'warily', 'self-revelation', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'surprising', 'about-face', 'usual', 'villainous', 'roles', 'empathetically', 'Glory', 'husband', 'Kyle', 'James', 'Cada', 'perfectly', 'venal', 'head', 'mine.However', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'climax', 'film', 'botched', 'scenes', 'contrived', 'actions', 'make', 'sense', 'other', 'provide', 'film', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'finish', 'ironically', 'hollow', 'result', 'sparse', 'DVD', 'package', 'one', 'invaluable', 'extra', 'short', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Stories', 'North', 'Country', 'hear', 'not', 'only', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'real', 'women', 'mines', 'who', 'inspired', 'film', 'including', 'Jenson', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'only', 'provide', 'value', 'providing', 'greater', 'sense', 'context', 'Glory', 'physical', 'decent', 'unfortunately', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track']",N/A

960509,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B000CQLZ8S,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[0, 0]","""North Country"" hit me hard - not least because it wasn't until 1998 that the class-action lawsuit that came from its inspiration was settled. No movie in recent years - all the way back to ""Norma Rae"" - had such an impact, because in 1976, I went through the selfsame treatment as the women at the Pearson Mines, only to a lesser extent and at a textile mill. I considered the same sort of legislation as Josey does in ""North Country"" - but in 1976, things hadn't quite reached the can-do point.Josey Aimes, a mother of two children, leaves her abusive husband and comes home to Minnesota's Iron Range to live with her parents. It's a telling moment of the pervading local mindset - at least the male mindset - when, on observing Josie's latest battle scars from her husband, her father asks condemningly, ""Did he catch you with another guy?"" It is this attitude Josey must face against the entire town, for the fault of having had a baby while still a high-school student. Her mother, played by Sissy Spacek, struggles to keep peace in the family by trying to short-circuit Josey's father's bitter disappointment in his only daughter, but she faces a losing battle.Despairing of gaining her father's approval, and wanting only to feed and house her kids herself, Josey takes a job at the same iron mine where her father works, because the pay is so much higher than she could otherwise make. Forewarned by her friend Glory, an old hand at the mine, she walks into instant verbal and some physical abuse; intimidation by suggestion, both in objects and grafitti in the women's locker room; groping and being put in unsafe situations by the male workers. Not all of the men are to blame, but under the we-are-brothers code, no one comes to the womens' defense.Josey is finally driven to the edge and quits, but decides to sue. The lawyer she picks is a just-returned local boy, a former hockey star, who has given up litigation in New York to come back home. He has serious reservations about winning such a case as a sexual-harassment lawsuit has never been done before; but Josey's absolute belief in her rightness here carries enough weight with him to bring him on board.It takes a lot for old attitudes to be beaten down, and here it is clear that the women involved had to surmount an enormous obstacle to go forward, battling not only old-boyism amongst the men but amongst the old-fashioned female populace as well, who don't want things stirred up. The actual lawsuit was brought in 1984 - not completely settled for 14 years - but these women made it possible for those after them to work without worrying about being intimidated or violated in any way in these work environs.For me, the most vivid and crucial scene was at a Union meeting where Josey's father finally faces the fact that his little girl is more courageous than an entire hall full of crusty miners, and stands up for his daughter at last.I'm disappointed that this movie got such little support. For me, it said everything that needed saying about a period of our working background that is shameful at best.

960511,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CQLZ8S,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","NORTH COUNTRY is a tough movie to watch - and that is why it is so fine and important.  The story exudes out of the characters surrounding the first class action suit for sexual harassment in the workplace and it would be difficult to imagine a more dour and gritty depiction of what women iron miners faced in Northern Minnesota than that director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) has molded out of Clara Bingham's book and Michael Seitzman's screenplay.  Though overly long (in excess of two hours) the film does successfully drive home its points and its issues.Josey (Charlize Theron) is an abused wife who after yet another beating form her husband takes her two children back to her hometown in Northern Minnesota where her mother (Sissy Spacek) and disturbing defiant father (Richard Jenkins) still view her as an embarrassment to the family: Josey became pregnant at age 16 and states she 'doesn't know the child's father'.  Josey's only concern is to make a living for her children and not be reliant on her parents.  She works as a hair washer in a beauty salon until her old friend Glory (Frances McDormand) recognizes her and urges her to apply for work in the iron mines were wages are good despite a disturbing atmosphere.  Reluctantly Josey agrees to apply, much to her father's disdain, and she moves her children away from her parents to live with Glory and her adoring husband Kyle (Sean Bean).  Once at work Josey encounters the disgusting macho miners who constantly sexually harass the female minors.  The situation deteriorates until finally Josey cannot tolerate it and she hires the sweet ex hockey athlete turned lawyer Bill (Woody Harrelson) to take on her case. What proceeds in the trial for the class action suit and a tough trial it is.  The fact that the bravery and courage of Josey and her colleagues results in a 'win' is almost a given as the film is based on historical fact.Charlize Theron once again delivers a fine performance and in part due to the brilliant support of the supporting cast gives us a character to remember.  Frances McDormand, Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins deliver superb portrayals and the large supporting cast is first rate.  For much of the film the viewer gets the feeling that we've been here before (many other films about the mines and the traumas here played are familiar), but the narrative is powerful and in the end sweeps all others aside as a statement that needed desperately to be made.

960512,A1X28NWPDMTDG7,B000CQLZ8S,Gregg Hillier,"[3, 4]","North Country has a few things going for it and plenty against it. The magnificent photography and gritty settings give a rare view to the forboding Iron Range in Northern Minnesota and the script and performaces by major-league talent have the best of intentions. Unfortunately, the sum of this film is less than its parts. The storyline is simply too familiar and cliched - even the run-down town and factory settings smack of ""Silkwood."" The backstories of spousal abuse, family dysfunction, and (gasp) Lou Gehrig's disease are right out of a ""Lifetime"" movie.So are the ""dramatized"" scenes of a labor meeting and the tepid courtroom confrontations.  The perfomances are mixed: while Harrelson walks thru his role with one eye on his paycheck, Theron - ""uglied up"" yet again - has her eye on Oscar. She scored an undeserved nomination for this role(compare her strained, synthetic work here to her glorious Oscar-winning turn in ""Monster"") as she fails to convince on all fronts.

In this sense the movie is powerfully ambitious, because not only it limits to tell this dense drama but besides gets inside into the painful, destroyed affective and emotional universe of a very enterpriser woman, rejected by her father, and with two sons of her shoulders.The formidable script handles with absolute solvency both universes: the exterior, abusive and depressing, and the interior much more exigent. the gradual growing up process of her son and the bitter attitude of her father who has never been able to assimilate her early pregnancy, since her early youth.It' s not an easy going film; narrated through prodigious narrative ellipsis, explores systematic and zealously the double moral and legal ambiguities that seriously compromise the whole village, because this is the main employment ` s source.If Jodie Foster won seventeen years ago her First Academy Award with Accused, in a role much more linear and without so much dense psychological profiles, Charlize should win her second Prize. She attains to make us forget her sidereal beauty and engages us through her fabulous performance. But the honors go so far: Frances Mac Dormand shines like a one thousand carats diamond with her towering and awful role, Woody Harrelson as the Defense Attorney is terrific too. The role of the female Attorney is too flat; I would like to see in this role to Jessica Lange for instance, who would have personified the evilness with a major frequency range.

960514,A3W3HNZG7BK9O9,B000CQLZ8S,"Ignacio Litardo ""inquisitive book worm""","[8, 10]","I loved this film, which made me empathize for the characters.Maybe the strongest scene was when Josey reads her defense in the miner's union, I guess that was her tougher ordeal. Some details are just great, like the decoration. For instance, the naked woman calendar on the wall of her HR superior's desk, the one that should take her complaints... Or the boss' attitude, chivalrous at first, but aggressively patronizing later, when $ was at stake. Her coworker ""Sherry""/ Michelle Monaghan is the image of vulnerability, I just can't believe some of her scenes were cut out!! Remember her at the trailer, with her mum.It's interesting how women were indifferent if not outright hostile to her, instead of acting in their own best interest. As the scene when they shift conversation to cosmetics, ironically, to take away the mine's dust. In contrast to the camaraderie and welcome jokes, and their singing at the bar. Frances McDormand is great, a perfect actress. Nobody escapes from machismo and conventionality, definitely nor her father and son. But neither her mum, nor Sherry (ex: ""Are you gay?"" scene with Harrelson at the bar). No male defends her, not even the ""friendly/ humane"" good guy (and balding :) ). Anybody who has lived in the countryside (""interior"" in Spanish) knows how it is like: the daytime parties with too much food, replaced by strong drinks at night. Even the kind of music, obliged social gathering (Hockey, in this case), gossip is everybody's business, a way of life. ""Tradition"" = Conservatism.Bill White/ Harrelson's cynical lawyer was fine (fun how Americans obsess with alcohol as a sign of ""Decadence"" :) ). Like when he took the case for: ""it was never done before"" = Not for her or ""the cause"": ""Can you live with that?"". But, although pragmatically, he turned the case by provoking ""Bobby Sharp"" (Dickensian name!)/ Jeremy Renner, the most disgusting character of the whole film to my taste. You only have to see him to know he's ""up to no good"". Sean Bean's ""hard man-to-man"" talk to his son was brilliant, a low-key masterpiece. Probably that was a turning point in the film, when Josey's family life really starts to get straight. The ""first decent meal"" and ""first dingy house"" are, again, only understandable by someone who has lived through it. The tagline, for once, isn't misleading. She's not ""a heroine"", instead she's an ordinary woman forced to take extraordinary measures. The essence of epic, I guess. Why associate ""epic genre"" with men!?!Men like Sharp seem to be blind to the ""signs"" that people give to say ""no"", the signature of sociopaths according to Daniel Goleman in EI. That's the whole point of the movie: ""what do you do when you're surrounded by people who are so accustomed to mistreating each other"". So much that they'll blame the victim, to the point of distorting the facts, all for the sake of the ""herd"". The dialogue between Bobby and Kyle at the bar was just great, ""philosophical"". As the mumbled joke What is this, a ""pet cemetery?"" :)! (Related to his role in ""Natural born killers""?). I also learn in that scene that the saying ""you don't ... where you eat"" is not Spanish but, I'm afraid, ""Universal""...Her mum Alice/ Spacek does act correctly at the right moments: giving her some $ x the kids while her daughter was unemployed: ""I'm still your mum"" and ""leaving"" her husband when he was a real ass. But, in general, she's not very SYMPATHETIC, when she justifies Josey's beating husband, reminding her of their legal status, or turning off the TV when showing the timely ""Anita Hill"" trial.Images are great, specially the aerial shots of the mine, not far away from Dickens's Coketown (Hard Times). Music is good too, not only the one composed by the Argentinean Gustavo Santaolalla.As the Amazon reviewer ""Joe Sherry"" says: ""it doesn't matter if it's manipulative, as long as the film works"". I just couldn't agree more! I agree that things must have been way worse down there, and that one may enjoy a film even if it doesn't provide a conventional ""good time"". Also great: ""She believes, but she doesn't know"".But, unlike him, I still don't really get why her coworkers were so narrow minded...On the other hand, the other ""spotlight review"" (D. Mikels's) contains two SPOILERS... luckily by now I skip reviewer's stuff until AFTER I have seen a movie... Can't you do something about it? Look at how Sherry ""says without saying"" when he writes: ""what happened to Glory"". Was it THAT hard, review's editor?In contrast, NYT's helpful reader reviewer is from Eveleth (where the film took place), so I think his/her words should close this review: ""It's a tough place to grow up in but a beautiful place to visit. For now I will always be a tourist (...)"".I can think of no better film to celebrate the international women's day, when so much has changed, but so much remains the same.

Munson,"[1, 2]","Charlize Theron stars in this powerful drama about sexual harassment, women's rights, and big business turning a blind eye.Theron stars as Josey Aimes, a young, abused wife who leaves her husband and, along with her two children, set off to make a life for themselves.  They move in with Josey's parents Hank Aimes (Richard Jenkins) and Alice Aimes (Sissy Spacek).  Josey finds a job as a hairdresser, but finds it doesn't pay enough money, so she decides to apply for a job at the local iron mine.  Her friend Glory (Frances McDormand) helped her get in.  Her father also works there.  The mine is unionized and full of wackos and weirdos who like threatening, ogling, fondling, belittling, and insulting the few women who work there.  None of the women have ever stood up to the men before.  They see the job as their livlihood and don't want to jeopardize it, so they turn a blind eye to the abuse.  But not Josey.Bobby Sharp (Jeremy Renner), one of the men who works at the mine, is a former teenage boyfriend of Josey's.  He witnessed one of their teachers brutally rape Josey, but he did nothing to stop it.  Josey now works in the same area of the mine as Bobby, and now he has begun to harass her.After enduring the harassment for a long time, Josey decides to go to talk to the management about the problem.  Instead of being heard out, she is offered the option to resign or clean up her act. Defeated, she returns to her daily job at the mine.  In the meantime, her son has lost much of his respect for his mother, because she's been accused of sleeping with some of the miners and of being a whore and a slut.  He even quits his beloved hockey team.  Instead, he's started experimenting with alcohol.However, at one of the hockey games, Josey meets Bill White (Woody Harrelson), a lawyer from New York who used to live and play hockey in Minnesota.  Josey tells him about the abuse that is going on at the mine and wants to sue. Bill aks if Josey knows what ""class action"" means.  She says no.  Bill tells her it will be very hard to convince a judge and jury, since no class-action sexual harassment suit has ever been attempted.At the initial hearing, the judge says he will consider the class-action if Josey can come up with two other plaintiffs.  Unfortunately for her, none of the women wish to come forward and risk losing their jobs.  Will Josey find two more plaintiffs, or will the abuse continue unchecked at the mine?This is one of the most powerful dramas I've ever seen.  I watched it on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did.  I had no idea that conditions like those at the mine existed anywhere.  Charleze Theron is magnificent as the determined Josey, and Woody Harrelson is equally impressive as the believing lawyer who decided to take a chance.  Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins do fine jobs as Josey's parents.I highly recommend this great movie.  No woman should have to endure any kind of sexual harassment on the job.

But being good for cast reasons doesn't make a film good; ""North Country"" is a regular piece. The only problem with films taken from real life events is that they need to be true to the time and space where those events occurred. Director, Nikki Caro, seems to be more worried about getting tears out of our eyes than about showing us she's directing something that actually happened.The conclusion she achieves, or the result, is something more or less like the movie ""Whale Rider"", a moving picture which has a lot of predictable speeches and cheesy moments. Again, I couldn't buy them, and I'm beginning to believe Nikki Caro gives too little credit to the viewers; she underestimates them. I always accept the usual scenes if I feel them and I can go with them; I couldn't here. Where she didn't fail was in acting direction. She got an Oscar nomination out of a thirteen-year old and she could probably get it out of a first born.Charlize Theron's emotional ability has grown over the years, but you have to watch her to understand. In ""Trapped"" she'd showed her emotion in an inspired way, ""Head in the Clouds""; she was quite amazing but in ""North Country"" her emotion power took to the highest level. She easily achieves the correct amount of emotion in every scene she is and shines in. Charlize gives a finely-wrought, gripping performance; she shows her guts, fear, and bravery, but I'm not sure how convincing she is as mother to an older teenage boy (it seems a little soon for Charlize, and the same can be said for Sissy Spacek as the proverbial salt-of-the-earth grandmother).Woody Harrelson was passable as Charlize's lawyer because he wasn't convincing to me in the court room but only outside the court. The surprise performance comes from Richard Jenkins, making a scene we are used to a little more convincing and strong. The man's look is confident. Supporting characters--like Frances McDormand's dump truck driver--do not get enough quality screen-time to completely validate the time which they do have.The over-emotional finale is also questionable (You would think that they haven't been in a courtroom before), but it does provide the audience with the release it needs. Technically, the movie leaves nothing to hope for (Nikki Caro makes the mines look beautiful after she did it with the whales), but I'm hoping for something different from Nikki Caro and her next project other than that it's a good film.Does the film show all sides and give both the men and the women a fair shake? Probably not, but it's not a man-hater movie either, and since it's told from the female protagonist's point of view, Charlize endurance against certain men is the focal point here. Ultimately, ""North Country"" is about Josie Aimes courage and strength dealing with the mine. Charlize Theron was able to express this extremely well and ended up being recognize by the Oscar's once again.",4,"Charlize Theron dresses down again, somewhat, as Josie Aimes.",1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,3014,"['could', 'say', 'movie', 'good', 'cast', 'reasons', 'things', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'being', 'good', 'cast', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'good', 'North', 'Country', 'regular', 'piece', 'only', 'problem', 'films', 'taken', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'need', 'be', 'true', 'time', 'space', 'where', 'events', 'occurred', 'Director', 'Nikki', 'Caro', 'be', 'more', 'worried', 'getting', 'tears', 'eyes', 'showing', 'directing', 'something', 'actually', 'conclusion', 'result', 'something', 'more', 'less', 'movie', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'moving', 'picture', 'lot', 'predictable', 'speeches', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'Again', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'believe', 'Nikki', 'Caro', 'too', 'little', 'credit', 'viewers', 'always', 'accept', 'usual', 'scenes', 'feel', 'can', 'go', 'could', ""n't"", 'here', 'Where', 'did', ""n't"", 'fail', 'was', 'acting', 'direction', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'thirteen-year', 'old', 'could', 'probably', 'get', 'first', 'born.Charlize', 'Theron', 'emotional', 'ability', 'grown', 'years', 'have', 'watch', 'understand', 'Trapped', ""'d"", 'showed', 'emotion', 'inspired', 'way', 'Head', 'Clouds', 'was', 'quite', 'amazing', 'North', 'Country', 'emotion', 'power', 'took', 'highest', 'level', 'easily', 'correct', 'amount', 'emotion', 'scene', 'shines', 'Charlize', 'finely-wrought', 'gripping', 'performance', 'guts', 'fear', 'bravery', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'convincing', 'mother', 'older', 'teenage', 'boy', 'little', 'soon', 'Charlize', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'proverbial', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'grandmother', '.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'passable', 'Charlize', 'lawyer', 'was', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'court', 'room', 'only', 'court', 'surprise', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'making', 'scene', 'are', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'convincing', 'strong', 'man', 'look', 'confident', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'dump', 'truck', 'driver', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'quality', 'screen-time', 'completely', 'validate', 'time', 'do', 'have.The', 'over-emotional', 'finale', 'also', 'questionable', 'would', 'think', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'courtroom', 'provide', 'audience', 'release', 'Technically', 'movie', 'nothing', 'hope', 'Nikki', 'Caro', 'mines', 'look', 'beautiful', 'did', 'whales', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'something', 'different', 'Nikki', 'Caro', 'next', 'project', 'other', 'good', 'film.Does', 'film', 'show', 'sides', 'give', 'men', 'women', 'fair', 'shake', 'Probably', 'not', 'not', 'man-hater', 'movie', 'told', 'female', 'protagonist', 'point', 'view', 'Charlize', 'endurance', 'certain', 'men', 'focal', 'point', 'here', 'Ultimately', 'North', 'Country', 'Josie', 'Aimes', 'courage', 'strength', 'dealing', 'mine', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'able', 'express', 'extremely', 'well', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'recognize', 'Oscar', 'once', 'again']",N/A

960526,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000CQLZ8S,Joe Sherry,"[77, 85]","I really hate the tagline of North Country. ""All she wanted to do was make a living. Instead she made history."" It's terrible and doesn't at all capture what North Country is. Well, I suppose on one hand it does because that ultimately is the storyline of the movie but it's a tagline that makes me want to run away rather than buy a ticket. But enough about that.North Country is based on actual events at the Eveleth Mines in Minnesota's Iron Range. Women were first allowed into the mines in the late 1970's and the stories that North Country deals with occurred all throughout the 80's and into the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit in the early 1990's. Director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) spoke with some of the women miners and had one, Lynn Sterle as an advisor for the film.Charlize Theron plays Josey Aimes, a fictionalized character who comes to work at the Pearson Taconite mine where her father works and where her friend Glory (Frances McDormand) works driving truck. Josey is trying to raise her two children after leaving her husband and the mine will pay six times what she was making elsewhere. Glory tells her that Josey is going to have to deal with taunts and crude behavior and that the men do not want them at the mine. She believes, but she doesn't know. From the first moment she steps foot into the mine it becomes clear just how little they are wanted. The HR representative tells the new women that he doesn't want them there and if it wasn't for the Supreme Court, he wouldn't have hired them. But he'll give them a tour anyway and show them what the work is. The other workers call them crude names and Glory warns Josey that she may find degrading things in their lunch pails. Names are written on walls and lewd drawings are made. In general, the women are not made to feel welcome even though they are also members of the same union with the same rights as the men. But this is a boy's club and women are not welcome.Josey complains to HR and he tells her that nothing will happen. She continues to complain about the behavior and things get worse. Much worse. They are threatened, attacked, degraded and I can only believe that what is shown in the movie is only scratching the surface as to what really went on in the mine. Finally Josey has had enough and finds a lawyer (Woody Harrelson) and decides to sue. But even the women are not supportive.North Country mixes Josey's experience at the mine with footage from the lawsuit (preliminary hearings is my guess as it wasn't yet class action) and also makes the connection with Josey's story with the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings that were going on at the same time.This is a moving film that deals with an incredibly ugly subject matter. One would think that by the 1990's such behavior would not occur and that it wouldn't be put up with, but it did. The movie itself is well acted by Theron and the supporting cast. In particular the other women miners do a great job in showing toughness in the face of such degradation and why they would not want to speak up and how they can deal with the harassment.Well made, well acted. I don't feel that North Country was especially manipulative. All film is manipulative and has a viewpoint and an agenda. The questions are: does the movie work? Is it any good? Does it feel true? Yes, to all. North Country is not a feel good movie by any measure and it isn't one that I can really say I enjoyed, but I enjoy any good movie and in that sense I did.Some may feel that this is nothing more than Oscar bait with the poor woman overcoming degradation and rising to accomplish something big, and that it is touching the buttons that need to be touched to get awards...but that does not lessen the fact that the movie is rather good and that Theron will deserve whatever nominations she receives or awards she wins. She does an excellent job as does Niki Caro, Frances McDormand and the other actors. The movie only hits one note that felt like too much (what happened to Glory), but even that isn't a major point against it. Just something that felt off.

Director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) does a wonderful job handling this material. It would have been easy to go over the top, or to dwell too long on some of the instances of sexual harassment, but she wisely chose to show them without added dramatic effect, knowing that we would get it. And we did.This was based on a true story, and is an acknowledged fictional account, so it's difficult to know what was real and what wasn't, but I'm going to guess that the instances were fairly close to the truth. Men used their own feces to write derogatory words in the women's dressing room, used any excuse to feel up one of their female co-workers, and in one extremely disturbing instance, knocked over a ""Porta-Jane"" while a female co-worker was using it. Of course, not all men engaged in this activity, but any who remained silent were complicit. How were women supposed to put up with nonsense? Just be a man, they were told. Well, if they did that, they would have been slinging feces on their male co-workers wall. Not a sensible answer for them to have been given, was it?That this occurred in 1989 is even more disturbing. How long will it be before the idea of a woman's place being in the kitchen is completely routed from every man's thoughts? Not soon enough, I'm afraid.Charlize Theron was excellent (if perhaps not Oscar worthy, but that's subjective) as was Francis McDormand.

960530,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000CQLZ8S,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","Easily one of the best films of 2005, 'North Country' also features some great performances by Academy Award Winners Charlize Theron (Best Actress 'Monster') and Frances McDormand (Best Actress 'Fargo'). Both of them also earned Oscar nominations for this film. I really can't figure out why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture (I thought it was better than 'Good Night, And Good Luck') and I have no doubt that Charlize Theron would have won Best Actress (again) if not for Reese Witherspoon's great performance in 'Walk the Line'. But, anyway Theron plays Josey Aimes, a woman who moves into her parents (Richard Jenkins & Sissy Spacek) house with her two children, Sammy and Karen, after a particularly nasty spat with her abusive husband. Josey gets a job as a shampoo girl and an old friend of hers named Glory (McDormand, fantastic as always) suggests she get a job at the mine (where Josey's father works). Josey is hesistant but agrees, knowing the job will help her take care of her family better. As soon as she arrives there and starts working, things go awry. First, there's a man there named Bobby Sharp (Jeremy Renner, who played Jeffrey Dahmer in the straight-to-video 'Dahmer') who may or may not be the father of her son Sammy. Also, all the men sexually harrass and taunt the women who work there. Name calling, groping, fondling, and mean pranks all happen there and after a few incidents Josey gets sick of it and sues the mine; Much to the dismay of her father, male co-workers, and even her female co-workers. Woody Harrelson turns in some Oscar worthy supporting work as Josey's lawyer/ex-hockey star. Theron's performance is great and despite the lack of makeup is almost better than she was in 'Monster'. This film also happens to be better than that movie. McDormand is playing the exact character you've all seen McDormand playing. The movie is not only informative, but entertaining and at times disturbing. I don't like people who jump the gun with sexual harassment, which the synopsis on the back of the DVD makes it look like Josey did...But the things the women endure in this movie are what I think of when I hear the word 'sexual harassment'. Also, keep in mind moviewatchers. This film is 'Inspired by a True Story' but it's not based on one. The lawsuit thing happened, but Josey Aimes (or the things that happen to her) don't necessarily exist. But, it doesn't matter. This is a powerful film, a fantastic film that you shouldn't miss.GRADE: A",5,North Country,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2490,"['Easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2005', 'Country', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winners', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Best', 'Actress', ""'Monster"", 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Best', 'Actress', ""'Fargo"", 'also', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'thought', 'was', 'better', ""'Good"", 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'have', 'doubt', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'again', 'not', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'great', 'performance', 'Line', 'anyway', 'Theron', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'woman', 'who', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'house', 'two', 'children', 'Sammy', 'Karen', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'spat', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Josey', 'job', 'shampoo', 'girl', 'old', 'friend', 'hers', 'named', 'Glory', 'McDormand', 'fantastic', 'always', 'get', 'job', 'mine', 'where', 'Josey', 'father', 'works', 'Josey', 'hesistant', 'knowing', 'job', 'will', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'better', 'As', 'soon', 'there', 'working', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'First', 'man', 'there', 'named', 'Bobby', 'Sharp', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'straight-to-video', ""'Dahmer"", 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'father', 'son', 'Sammy', 'Also', 'men', 'sexually', 'harrass', 'taunt', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'there', 'Name', 'calling', 'groping', 'fondling', 'mean', 'pranks', 'happen', 'few', 'incidents', 'Josey', 'sick', 'mine', 'Much', 'dismay', 'father', 'male', 'co-workers', 'even', 'female', 'co-workers', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'supporting', 'work', 'Josey', 'lawyer/ex-hockey', 'star', 'Theron', 'performance', 'great', 'lack', 'makeup', 'almost', 'better', 'was', ""'Monster"", 'film', 'also', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'McDormand', 'playing', 'exact', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'McDormand', 'playing', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'times', 'disturbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', 'jump', 'gun', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'synopsis', 'back', 'DVD', 'look', 'Josey', 'did', 'things', 'women', 'endure', 'movie', 'are', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'hear', 'word', ""'sexual"", 'harassment', 'Also', 'keep', 'mind', 'moviewatchers', 'film', ""'Inspired"", 'True', 'Story', 'not', 'based', 'one', 'lawsuit', 'thing', 'happened', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'things', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'exist', ""n't"", 'matter', 'powerful', 'film', 'fantastic', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss.GRADE']",N/A

Throw in a friend slowly dying of a terminal illness, and some sappy courtroom drama.But actually, as the film went on, I got kind of interested in it.It was cheesy and over the top at points (I'm thinking specifically of a courtroom scene in which a witness suddenly reverses his testimony just because of being asked the same question over and over by the lawyer). But it was absolutely amazing what these women had to put up with at the mine. I found myself almost disbelieving it at points. Not necessarily disbelieving that we men could be such pigs, but that these women would wait so long before they finally filled for a class action suit after all that happened to them. 50 years go maybe, but this story was shown as being concurrent with the Anita Hill hearings. However the movie did try and give lots of reasons why these women were scared of loosing their jobs.The DVD extra feature has interviews with the real women behind the story, which is very interesting, although it does sometimes indicate a slight disconnect between the kind of harassment these women faced in real life, and the full out assault they undergo in the film. Also in the movie it was one lone woman fighting both her male colleagues and her fellow women, but in the interviews it sounded like a lot of women were in on this class action suit together.

960537,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000CQLZ8S,Kaya Savas,"[3, 6]","MOVIE: North Country is a film that digs deep and reaches the audience, but just barely.  We have Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) who has just left her abusive husband, has taken her two children, and has gone to live with her parents. One evening at dinner the topic of jobs comes up, and Josey wants to work so that she can support herself and her kids. She ends up working at the mines up there in Minnesota, which is also where her father works. The moment she starts her orientation the sexist comments from the male workers start flying. This is where the film spends most of its time, the treatment of the women in the workplace. This is also where the film makes its impact on the audience, however this is a cheap attempt by the filmmakers. We have this formulaic story that needs to connect with the audience and it does on a few levels. A mother, who is homeless, with two kids, and is trying to get back on her feet. I think the film should have spent more time on the lawsuit that Josey files on the mine company for sexual harassment instead of the poor treatment of the female workers. I feel like that this film was originally set out to be made in order to put emphasis on the first sexual harassment case to start the equal treatment of women in the workplace. Instead it became a film about ""all men are pigs and are evil"". Well, that's the message I got from it.  The majority of the film we see the men writing obscene words in feces all over the women's locker room.  They put dildos in their lunchboxes, tip them over while they are in the portable bathrooms, call out names, and in an extreme case ejaculate all over their belongings in their lockers. This is some nasty stuff, I mean, just really bad stuff.  All these things sort of distract the viewer from the real cause of the movie, which is one woman's personal journey. We all know what happens in the end, she wins the case, and there is a cliched scene in the courtroom where the judge calls for more people to be on Josey's side for this to be a class action lawsuit, and then one person at a time stands up in defense for Josey. It starts off on the right track, loses it in the middle, and seems to find its way back at the end.ACTING: All the acting is respectable in this film.  Charlize Theron gives a stellar performance and she carries the film well.  Frances McDormand does an amazing job as well and I wouldn't be surprised to see her name in the supporting actress category, but that would be a longshot. The rest of the cast does a commendable job, and the acting is the real highlight of the film.BOTTOM LINE: Niki Caro, who directed Whale Rider, sets the right tone for the film. The color tones and cinematography are beautiful.  However, the script spends too much time in the wrong place. Great acting moves the film along, but in the end it feels like it was a lecture.  Also, as a male viewer, I just got the message that all men are sexist pigs, which isn't gonna sit well for a wide audience.",3,"A Good Film, But At Times It Relies Too Much On Shock Value Instead Of Characters",1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,2995,"['MOVIE', 'North', 'Country', 'film', 'deep', 'audience', 'just', 'barely', 'have', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'abusive', 'husband', 'taken', 'two', 'children', 'gone', 'live', 'parents', 'One', 'evening', 'dinner', 'topic', 'jobs', 'up', 'Josey', 'work', 'so', 'can', 'support', 'kids', 'up', 'working', 'mines', 'there', 'Minnesota', 'also', 'where', 'father', 'works', 'moment', 'orientation', 'sexist', 'comments', 'male', 'workers', 'start', 'flying', 'where', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'treatment', 'women', 'workplace', 'also', 'where', 'film', 'impact', 'audience', 'however', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'formulaic', 'story', 'connect', 'audience', 'few', 'levels', 'mother', 'who', 'homeless', 'two', 'kids', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'lawsuit', 'Josey', 'mine', 'company', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'instead', 'poor', 'treatment', 'female', 'workers', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'made', 'order', 'put', 'emphasis', 'first', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'case', 'start', 'equal', 'treatment', 'women', 'workplace', 'Instead', 'became', 'film', 'men', 'are', 'pigs', 'are', 'evil', 'Well', 'message', 'got', 'majority', 'film', 'see', 'men', 'writing', 'obscene', 'words', 'feces', 'women', 'locker', 'room', 'put', 'dildos', 'lunchboxes', 'tip', 'over', 'are', 'portable', 'bathrooms', 'call', 'out', 'names', 'extreme', 'case', 'ejaculate', 'belongings', 'lockers', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'mean', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'stuff', 'things', 'sort', 'distract', 'viewer', 'real', 'cause', 'movie', 'one', 'woman', 'personal', 'journey', 'know', 'what', 'end', 'case', 'cliched', 'scene', 'courtroom', 'where', 'judge', 'more', 'people', 'be', 'Josey', 'side', 'be', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'then', 'one', 'person', 'time', 'up', 'defense', 'Josey', 'right', 'track', 'middle', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'end.ACTING', 'acting', 'respectable', 'film', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'stellar', 'performance', 'film', 'well', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'amazing', 'job', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'name', 'supporting', 'actress', 'category', 'would', 'be', 'longshot', 'rest', 'cast', 'commendable', 'job', 'acting', 'real', 'highlight', 'film.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'who', 'directed', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'right', 'tone', 'film', 'color', 'tones', 'cinematography', 'are', 'beautiful', 'However', 'script', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'wrong', 'place', 'Great', 'acting', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'lecture', 'Also', 'male', 'viewer', 'just', 'got', 'message', 'men', 'are', 'sexist', 'pigs', ""n't"", 'gon', 'sit', 'well', 'wide', 'audience']",N/A

Surprise supportive acting came from Frances McDormand and Sean Bean, by this I don't mean that it's a surprise they can act but rather I thought their character's side story (their love and her illness) was a nice addition to the movie.  As for the subject matter I doubt it would surprise anyone that I was sickened by the way women were treated in the work place.  What I don't understand is how much time do the men at the mine have on their hands that they spend all their time harassing the women?

Gelwasser,"[4, 4]","I think one of the marks of a really good film is it's ability to move the viewer, make them think about the subject matter and create a lasting emotional impact. In that respect, the movie drama, ""North Country"" is one of those films that comes through with flying colors. It is a fictionalized version of a true (and historic) story, that occured in the not to distant past. ""North Country"" takes place in 1980's Minnesota, where the smalltown, local economy is based on the dirty, dangerous work of iron mining. The first half of the film introduces us to Josie Aimes (a semi-deglamorized, Charlize Theron), a mother of two children, who comes back home to live with her parents, after being physically abused by her boyfriend. Looking to be able to financially support her kids on her own, she applies and gets a job in the local iron mines. It is made clear from the start, that the female miners are not wanted and have only been hired, because of court orders. As far as the male employees are concerned, these women are trying to do ""men's work"" and are taking away their jobs. The film shows how on a daily basis these women were subjected to the most vile imaginable treatment, that ranged from cruel, practical jokes to vicious name calling to assualt & near rape. Josie's complaints to her supervisers and the companies' owners fall on deaf ears. They would rather she just quit. In the second half of the film we watch as Josie and her lawyer (Woody Harrelson) take the company on in court. In a judicial hearing, they must prove there is merit to their case to launch the first ever 'class action lawsuit of sexual harrassment' in U.S. history. The company does everything possible in court to personally tear Josie down and humiliate her in an effort to stop the case. Director, Niki Caro (""Whale Rider"") has created an emotionally involving film of a women, who has lead a hard life and is just trying to just make things better for herself and her family. She is not willing to shut-up,""know her place"" or just take the 'treatment' at the hands of her company or the community she lives in. This is a film that stays with you long after it's over and really makes you think about human behavior. It's really hard to believe that people could act so inhumanely to each other. The entire cast is uniformly excellent. Charlize Theron once again proves that she is a truely gifted actress. This Oscar nominated performance is on the same level as her Academy Award winning role in the film drama, ""Monster"". Frances McDormand also gives a good supporting performance (also nominated) as Glory, a  folksy, take-no-s**t, female union rep. Also, very fine acting turns from Richard Jenkins & Sissy Spacek as Josie's parents and juvenile actor, Thomas Curtis as her teenage son. This film is really an emotionally, moving drama, that will stay with you long after the credits role by.

For the reviewers who didn't like it, and their reasons... a movie cannot possibly go to the depths of which a book or true life can. Movies are time limited in order to make them appealing. Therefore, they tend to cut out things and try to make the whole greater than the sum of it's parts.In this case I felt they did a good job. The story developed Chalize's character richly in this movie. It also focused on her relationships with her children, parents and coworkers and included bits and pieces of her past to show you the whole person.Charlize is rapidly winning my approval as an actress. Sissy Spacek is excellent here too, although just a second string character. The real suprise is Woody Harrelson. He is superb in his role as the lawyer... something I don't think I could say about him in any other of his movies.The point in this movie is to display what led to the case... not just the sexual harrassment on the job, but the backgroud of the originator of the case. She faced the enemies, both current and past, and quelled those fires and declared herself.This movie also displays group behavior and how the greater group may reign due to numbers.... but if it's not a nice reign, they soon will fall.

960541,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000CQLZ8S,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 1]","Before seeing North Country the audience should have the understanding that this phenomenon that the film portrays is a multi-millennia issue.  Over centuries, society has carefully cut out a niche for women, as civilizations for most of the last 5000 years have been in the power of men. In the process, the creation of rules, traditions, and ideological concepts has favored men.  There are instances that reach far back in history, literature, and art where exceptions have been in regards to women; however, these are few and far between to have made any lasting impression on the patriarchal societies around the world.  Thus, when women have begun to try to break free of the patriarchal chains of ancient times, centuries of traditions and social norms begin to mount against them.  Yet, many women remain strong in their attitudes and pursuit for equal freedom.  In these changing times, the society faces the change with suspicion and fear, as some men territorially begin to protect what they perceive to belong to them.  In the process, the first place that the oppressor begins to assault is the obvious difference between men and women - their sex.Based on a true story North Country tells about Josey Aimes'(Charlize Theron) struggle to gain her piece of the American Dream where all have equal rights to safety and liberty.  It is a long road of unhappiness cornered by physical, emotional, and economical abuse until the Josey decides to break away from it by leaving her husband.  It is also at this point that the film opens.  Yet, she cannot get away from the stigma of being a woman with what seems to be a dubious past.  For example, despite the obvious bruises on her face, Josey's father Hank (Richard Jenkins) blames her for the physical abuse by asking, ""So he catch you with another man?""  The audience probably shakes their heads to the comment in similar disbelief, as Josey responds, ""You're really asking me that?""  The scene is poignantly potent, as it describes the emotional solitude in which Josey exists, as she also refuses to return to the norm of continued abuse from her husband.  In addition, Josey's mother Alice (Sissy Spacek) takes a strong submissive role, as she supports her husband while also bringing the unforgiving morals of the church on Josey.  It only augments the solitude that Josey must feel, as she seems to stand-alone against the world.Besides worrying about herself, Josey must see to that she can support her two children, Karen (Elle Peterson) and Sammy (Thomas Curtis), which means that she must find a job.  The vocational perspective allows the viewer to see into the preferential income levels between men and women, as women are more likely to make far less than their male counterparts.  It also makes it harder for Josey to begin a life on her own without the danger of abuse, however, she seeks work in the local mine where her father has worked his whole life.  Most men oppose that women should work in the mine for several shortsighted reasons, and they vent their frustrations through crude and offensively sexual jokes.  Eventually, the jokes move towards overt demands for sexual favors to direct physical touch and odious pranks of the lowest sort.  The working life of Josey immediately has an affect on her, but she tries to cope with it to the best of her ability.  However, the mentality of women's weakness runs thick throughout the entire company, as it helps breed a cruel sexual atmosphere.  In the end, she has no other choice than to make the decision of finding help from outside the company to prevent her life from falling into ruin through these oppressive behaviors.The narration of the story emerges through several flashbacks, as Josey's story becomes public in a courtroom.  It is clear that she will go to court, but what is not clear is if she will find help that is willing to help ease her and other women's agony at the mine.  Much of the suspension in regards to Josey possible success in the court rests in the film's genuine portrayal of the chauvinistic atmosphere of the town and its deep-rooted patriarchal traditions.  North Country also displays in detail how many of these women find themselves helpless, as they have acquired the notion that some things can never change.  The film essentially provides an exceptional illustration of the socioeconomic oppression of women of modern time, but also what steps the society has taken to make it that way.  Lastly, it tells an important part of contemporary history about an ancient issue, which now been brought out from the shadows of several millennia.North Country presents a gripping cinematic experience through its important subject, as women fight for what many take for granted - equal rights.  The fabulous cast includes names such as Charlize Theron, Frances McDormand, Sean Bean, Woody Harrelson, Jeremy Renner, Richard Jenkins, Sissy Spacek, and many more that helped bring this sad, yet intriguing story alive.  Another aspect that helps boost the cinematic experience is the cast of all the extras in the film, which allows the film to capture the authentic feeling of a northern Minnesota small town.  The mise-en-scene also helps accentuate the genuine atmosphere.  All of these pieces leave the audience with an upsetting experience that evokes sadness, anger, love, and much more, as these women fall victim to severe sexual harassment.",5,A Gripping Cinematic

960543,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,B000CQLZ8S,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[0, 0]","After seeing North Country in the bargain bins at nearly every video store, I took the $4 plunge. I caught part of the 2005 film on television, and hey, Sean Bean is in it, so why not?After leaving her abusive husband, Josey (Charlize Theron, Monster) takes a job at the Pearson Mines to support her two children, Sammy (Thomas Curtis) and Karen (Elle Peterson). Her father Hank (Richard Jenkins), also a miner, disapproves of Josey's job, as do most of the male miners. Union representative Glory (Frances McDormand, Fargo) tries to keeps the hazing of the new female minors to a minimum. Unfortunately, Glory can't keep her tough exterior while her health is failing. Her husband Kyle (Sean Bean)-previously injured at the mine-must care for Glory. Josey's Mom Alice (Sissy Spacek) offers support where she can, but after one too many incidents at the mine, Josey turns to ex hockey star turned lawyer Bill (Woody Harrelson) and takes the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit to court.Clearly meant as a vehicle for Charlize Theron, the Oscar winner gives a fine performance here along with other such female Oscar heavy weights as Spacek and McDormand. The faults with North Country are not with the cast. In their brief scenes, Woody Harrelson and Sean Bean support the ladies very well, but it is as if they don't have enough to do. The leading women also don't seem to be as moving as they could be. The talent was definitely there for North Country, but director Niki Caro and writer Michael Seitzman seem to have missed the emotional mark.Based upon the book by Clara Bingham, this true story about women fighting back against sexual harassment should be more moving then it turned out onscreen. After years of courtroom reruns on television, the legal scenes in North Country seem stilted and on the cheap. Woody Harrelson is capable of the courtroom charisma needed, as seen in The People vs Larry Flint, but it seems as if the history making legal precedence is set aside for chick flick moments.The North Country DVD does have a brief deleted scene reel, and for once, these pieces should have been left in the film. Several key conversations between each main cast member were left on the cutting room floor. Some have dialogue, and some are just lengthy moments between the leads, but these scenes add some of the depth needed. At exactly two hours, North Country seems a bit short nowadays. All the pieces to the puzzle are there, but North Country doesn't quite deliver.Men probably won't like this attempted gun-ho women's picture, but younger folks may not either, largely due to the eighties look of the film. North Country's setting is cold Minnesota, 1989-and the hair, costumes, and production look it. I must, however, say the ice hockey presented actually looks authentic-not an easy thing to find! Unfortunately, the DVD contains only the deleted scenes, the standard subtitles, and a brief behind the scenes with the real women of the class action lawsuit.Instead of directing audiences to `stand up' for themselves and other against abuse by going to a website, here was another missed chance to get seriously exhaustive about the issue of filming what is still a touchy subject. How did Theron prepare? Was it rewarding or difficult for the real victims to see their tale onscreen? What does the real mining company have to say about all this? Sadly we just don't know.Although North Country didn't quite hit the nail on the head, the film is just right for a certain audience niche.

Everyone has the right to earn a living. Hard to find something wrong with that.Where not talking about the '40's or the '50's. This stuff has been going on since then of course. Rosie the Riveter working on the assembly lines of Ford, Boeing, Chance-Vought and Grumman, was tough as nails. She was also abused by her male coworkers.This is the burden faced by Director Niki Caro and the result is admirable and in parts even magnetic. This is not the vanilla ""Norma Rae."" This is the abusive, dangerous, hostile, rejection by male union members of a female worker. The result of not being able to make a living has a large impact on more than just the paycheck. The lonliness, the children, the abuse by other men's wives . . . it must be terribly stressful and Theron plays the part exceedingly well as we have come to expect from her. McDormand, Spacek and Bean are just outstanding as the support cast who remain (sometimes irritated with but) loyal to Theron.I had a problem with Bill White (Woody Harrelson) as the lawyer who befriends Theron. Ex-Hockey player; ex-New York lawyer, turns up in the Siberia of the US, 'Iron Country' Minnesota. Why? Have you heard of ESPN, man. Sports agency. The extraordinary client pool in New York, exceeded only by California for people who will sue eachother at the drop of a hat. (""You don't like my hair? See you in court, witch!"")The other problem I had was Ms. Theron. There are wonderful, gifted actors in Hollywood who are women who can do an extraordinary job. Two of them are the above mentioned McDormand and Spacek. But I have to tell you that Charlize Theron is the most drop-dead-gorgeous woman acting today. OK. I could be wrong. Would you give me in the top three?I would have put someone less strikingly beautiful in the lead role. Equally skilled. Not to say Ms. Theron wasn't brilliant. It just seemed unnecessary.The Unions are a haven for this type of abuse and I thought Caro's depiction of it to be kind of pale compared to my own experience here in Michigan. I'm 6' 2"" and 225#s and I wanted to run to my nearest EEO office after teaching classes in the late 90's. 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.'

960546,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CQLZ8S,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","We are excited about ""North Country"" up here in the Zenith City, the gateway to the Iron Range.  Most of us have been up to Eveleth and Virginia, where we have driven by the taconite mines.  Most of those pellets are shipped down to the Twin Ports and loaded on the big ore ships that leave this end of the Great Lakes for steel plants here and abroad.  We went to the first showing in town, which was even covered by the local press.""North Country"" is inspired by a true story, namely the case of Lois Jenson vs. Eveleth Mines, which was the first major successful sexual harassment case in the United States.  Michael Seitzman's screenplay tells the story of Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron), who gets up off the floor after having been punched out by her husband, loads her two kids in the pickup and goes home to her parents.  Her mom (Sissy Spacek) accepts her return, but Josey's dad (Richard Jenkins) wants to know if she was caught sleeping with another man.  Josey and the kids move in with her friend, Glory (Frances McDormand), who arranges for Josey to get a job at the mine.  Josey sees this as an opportunity to support herself, take care of her kids, and buy them a house.  But on the Iron Range women are not supposed to be working in the mines and there is a price to be paid for crossing that line.  The only thing is that nobody should have to pay this price.This is one of those inspirational films where a person takes more than they should until they get to the point where they decide to fight back.  Adding insult to injury is the fact that her son Sammy (Thomas Curtis), believes everything they are saying in town about his mom, who has been hiding the truth from the boy since before he was born.  Meanwhile, Glory has been trying to set up Josey with Bill White (Woody Harrelson), a local hockey hero back from New York City.  But Josey does not need a new boyfriend, she needs a lawyer, and Bill happens to be one (bonus points to the film for focusing on the legal case and not any potential romance between the two).  The problem then becomes that the only way to win is not simply to sue the mine, but to bring a class action suit, and that means convincing other women to join with Josey.This really is an excellent movie until the big crisis moment in the courtroom, and while I know that movies are often about manipulation I really do not want to believe that justice in this country comes down to hockey metaphors rather than truth and honor.  When you are dealing with a courtroom film inspired by a true story the reference point should not be ""A Few Good Men,"" and there will be plenty of people who will roll their eyes and feel less than satisfied by the dramatic resolution.  The film did not need to take that path because it already had a tipping point where the women are commended for sticking with the Union line and then one of them decides with the threat of a lawsuit hanging off them to be a real jerk off in the dry room.  That director Nikki Caro could go from making ""Te kaieke tohora"" (""Whale Rider"") and then ""North Country"" is certainly admirable given how different New Zealand and the Iron Range are, but Michael Seitzman's script takes the easy way out on the payoff at the end and as good as it might make you feel it just does not feel right.I almost rounded up on this 2005 film because of the initial position that it develops towards Josey.  Throughout the film as the story of what happened to Josey unfolds we see scenes from the courtroom where Josey and others are being cross-examined by Leslie Conlin (Linda Emond), who is clearly trying to prove the plaintiff is both a nut and a slut.  In time we find out that Josey is neither, but before we get to that point this film convinces us that it does not matter because we are not willing to grant the premise that if a woman sleeps with more than one man, has a child out of wedlock, or takes a job as a miner that she then deserves to have her body fondled, find a dildo in her lunchbox, or have offensive names smeared in feces on the walls of her locker room (and there is much worse to come than those things).  The second part of the film, where we learn the truth, reinforces what has already been established, so it is only in the final act that we move from the drama to melodrama.The other reason to grant this film dispensation for going over the top at the end is that until them the acting is first rate.  It is safe to assume that Therzon is going to get another Best Actress nomination and then it is a question of whether the other former Oscar winners, McDormand and Spacek, are going to cancel each other out in the Best Supporting Actress category or if they can both score nominations and then knock each other out in the actual voting.  If I had to place a bet on Oscar wins in late October it would be for Richard Jenkins as Hank Aimes.  I am so used to seeing him with a twinkle in his eye in things like ""Six Feet Under,"" but the light is totally gone and his performance is the most impressive in this excellent ensemble that offers strong performances by Sean Bean, Rusty Schwimmer, and Jillan Armenante as well.  I have no doubt they all made up their minds halfway through reading the script, well before they got to the big finish that falls short of delivering the desired punch.",4,Excellent performances but

960547,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000CQLZ8S,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","This 2005 film is based on a real class-action suit brought about by women miners in the State of Minnesota.  It was in the courts for 15 years and finally got settled in 1991.  North Country is based on that landmark decision and tells the story of Josey Aimes, played by Charlize Theron, a single mother who wanted to work in the mine in order to support her children.  Frances McDormand is cast as her friend and inspiration.  Together these two women, and a handful of others, have a lot to put up with.The men are awful.  The harassment is terrible.  The women are groped and ridiculed and almost raped.  And there is one scene that made me grimace where the men topple over a port-a-san when Josey is in it and she is covered in filth.  The courage it must have taken for these women to work with these men is inspiring.  The story moves fast and it is easy to identify with the victims.However, this is not really a true story.  Although the class action suit is real, the story is fiction.  And the screenplay went a little too far.  Somewhere among these men who acted like animals, there must have been some men who were nicer to the women.  After all, they all have wives and daughters and would never want their own families treated this way.  In the film, Josey's father, played by Richard Jenkins, finally does stand up for his daughter.  But it is strange to me how he could have accepted her being abused for so long.Also, the writer threw in a back story about Josey and the man who was the worst abuser in the mine.  Seems like they dated in High School and a big secret comes out later.  A different secret about who fathered Josey's first child is also revealed.  This all happens in a courtroom scene.  Woody Harrelson is cast as the lawyer.  He makes a brilliant case, but the strength of this case seems to be based on these  irrelevant prior relationships.Acting was superb though and won academy award nominations for Charlize Theron and Francis McDormand.  Another small but important part was played by Sissy Spacek, cast as Josey's traditional mother who can't understand why her daughter would want to work in the mine at all.The DVD has some interesting extras.  Here we meet some of the actual women who worked in the mine although we never do meet the main character, Josey Aimes.  I understand she is rather shy and not at all like the high-spirited woman that was portrayed in the film.All in all, this was a good movie.

I can only assume certain elements were added to the true story to make it more interesting, in someone's opinion.  In my opinion, it ruined the film.  Why in the world would a woman's sexual history be allowed to be discussed as part of a sexual harassment trial?!  Why wouldn't a teenage girl tell her family that her child was conceived out of rape?!  Why would the rapist come to testify against her at the sexual harassment trial?!  And why would a witness to the rape use that as some kind of reason to be mean to the victim?!  Some parts of the movie were very good.  I'm guessing those are the parts that were most true to the real story.  For me, this move was less about women having equal rights in the workplace, and more about being a cautionary tale that if people think you were a [...] teenager people may treat you horribly as an adult.

It is always those who can not bear injustice who speak up for those who are either too afraid, or just don't care that are the people who make the positive changes, in this world happen.  We have watched stories like this many times, over and over. In my opinion they need to be watched by more men than women.  It is in this mans world that these injustices are allowed and it is MEN that can make their own personal choices to step in and help women make the changes we fight for every day all over the world.

Charlize Theron, proving she was no fluke with MONSTER, garnered her second Best Actress nomination for her role as Josey Ames, a determined young woman who gets a job in the Minnesota mines where her father also works, but not without a price.  Josie is appalled by the way the male workers resent female employees, subjecting them to humiliating verbal and even physical abuse.  When Josie decides to file a class action suit, she is horrified when the other women won't join her for fear of reprisal.  Even her own father (a wonderful performance from the always reliable Richard Jenkins) disowns her and her son is angered because of the rebukes he receives from the townspeople's children too.While the courtroom scenes are a little credibility challenged, the movie succeeds in bringing the cause to light and offering a powerful insight into the dynamics of political incorrectness.Theron is supported by Frances McDormand (also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) as her friend who is dying from Lou Gehrig's disease; Sean Bean, McDormand's husband, who delivers a quietly restrained performance far from his usual villainous roles; Sissy Spacek, forcefully effective, as Charlize's quiet but supportive mother; and Woody Harrelson as the subdued lawyer who takes on Josey's case.Highly effective and even though Theron and McDormand are dark horses for their Oscars, their performances (as well as Jenkins) are Oscar worthy.",5,CHARLIZE VS.

960553,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000CQLZ8S,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","""North Country"" is a fictionalization of the events surrounding the United States' first class action sexual harassment law suit, which was filed in 1984  and not resolved until 1998. The real case was Jenson vs. Eveleth Taconite Mines. Lois Jenson was one of the first women hired by Eveleth mines, in the Mesabi Iron Range of Northern Minnesota, in 1975 after the company was forced by judicial mandate to hire women. Ms. Jenson and other female employees endured years of threats, assault, and humiliation at the hands of some of their co-workers, a situation exacerbated by layoffs that allowed women with seniority to keep jobs while men with less seniority lost them. When Lois Jenson et al took their employer to court in an attempt to force Eveleth to create a sexual harassment policy, they were further abused by the judicial system that allowed the defense to subpoena their medical records and full sexual histories, as if that were relevant to workplace grievances. After 3 trials and more than a decade, the women prevailed, and Eveleth adopted a sexual harassment policy.The characters in ""North Country"" are composites and fictionalized versions of real characters. We see Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron), a character loosely based on Lois Jenson, recall her experiences at the mine as she takes the stand during a sexual harassment trial. The narrative shifts back and forth from a courtroom to the mines, from the characters' present to their past. Josey is a single mother of 2 children who recently left her abusive husband and moved in with her parents. She runs into an old friend, Glory (Frances McDormand), who is a worker and union rep at Pearson Taconite & Steel. Glory encourages Josey to apply for a job there, where she'll be able to make enough money to get on her feet. Josey is elated to be financially independent for the first time in her life but doesn't know how long she can take the verbal and physical abuse by some of her male co-workers.""North Country"" tries to tell the story of Josey Aimes, a mildly sympathetic woman with a suspiciously extensive history of sexual victimhood, when it should be telling the story of women miners, union politics, and what the plaintiffs endured to bring their sexual harrassment suit to trial. The examples of harassment that we see don't make much of an impression. They are bad treatment, to be sure, but they lack context that would give them political or emotional impact. Instead of delving into that, ""North Country"" plunges into Josey's family: her disapproving father, coldly sympathetic mother, and practically estranged son. It's all conspicuously contrived, not the slightest bit credible, and it directs our focus 180 degrees from where it should be. This is a bad script, reminiscent of a television ""movie of the week"". And that's unfortunate, because there is a more interesting story to be gleaned from the experiences of the women who took on Eveleth Mines' callous disregard for their treatment. If you're really interested, the book written about the Jenson vs. Eveleth case is ""Class Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case that Changed Sexual Harassment Law"" (2002) by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Ganster.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): Bonus features include 9 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2  min), and ""Stories from North Country"", which features interviews with director Niki Caro, the film's cast and 3 of the women from the Eveleth case: Lois Jenson, Diane Hodge, and Joan Hunholz.

All I knew was that Charlise Theron was in it, who I have always admired both as a great beauty and as a fine actress.  The tagline was a little misleading: ""All she wanted was to make a living. Instead she made history.""Charlise Theron plays Jossie, a single mom who has left her abusive marriage, retreating to her hometown in northern Minnesota to start over.  In need of a job, she starts working at a local strip mine, where she is subjected to sexual harrassment and her problems falling on deaf ears.  She and her fellow female coworkers are in a predicament.  Give up their jobs or quit?  These days (as the movie takes place in the mid 80s to early 90s) it's easy.  If someone is bothering you on the job, take it to your boss and they will interfere.  They will interfere because they are afraid of lawsuits and anger on the job.  It was because of people like Jossie, who said that they could not, would not stand for work conditions like this.I admire people like Jossie for taking a stand and doing what's right, but I wish it was that easy for all of us.  We are under the impression that sexual harassment or ""creating a hostile work enviornment"" is something that only goes on among jobs such as the ones in this movie: blue collar, labor oriented jobs typically involving the uneducated classes.  This is certainly not the case.  People from all walks of life will be subjected to harrassment and unfair treatment.  And it's turned back onto itself.  Go to your boss with a problem, they will give the other party a slap on the wrist, maybe a scolding, and that will be the end of it.  For now.  Wait until they spread it to their friends and aquaintence, and you will have an army of people against you.  Are you willing to take it?The answer, of course, is that you don't have to.  On a previous job, I was being harrassed.  Oddly enough, it was by a woman (and I am a woman).  Nothing gave this woman more pleasure than to scream at me in front of a large group of people, insult and humiliate me.  I ignored it, thinking it was going to go away.  I was bigger than her, I was going to be the adult.  But you can't always be the adult, you can't always take it like a man.

960558,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000CQLZ8S,RMurray847,"[6, 7]","NORTH COUNTRY is a stirring film, but on a very obvious level.  It generates outrage, but at the same time, it doesn't generate discussion or reflection.  It is SO one-sided as to be close to a propaganda film.  It is redeemed by some outstanding performances and some good location cinematography.  Niko Caro, the director, has considerable ability (see WHALE RIDGE...a far subtler film) but should have insisted on a richer script.It tells the story of a poor and poorly educated mother who flees her abusive husband with her two kids in tow, heading back to her northern Minnesota hometown.  Her teenage son is the offspring of a high-school tryst...but the father is unknown.  Her young daughter is from her marriage.  In other words, this mother (Charlize Theron) has a bit of a reputation for ""looseness"" around her little town, and the embarrassment and exasperation her parents feel in her lingers quite palpably still.  Sissy Spacek is the mother, who has chosen to mostly ignore the ugliness for a sort of surface-level acceptance of her troubled child.  Richard Jenkins (not a well-known name, but you'll recognize the actor) is Charlize's father.  His performance is the best in the film...his character is the only one that grows in a relatively believable manner.  There's been a lot of Oscar buzz for Theron...I say Richard Jenkins deserves more.  He starts hard-nosed and can obviously barely stomach having his daughter around...but very gradually he is stripped of this veneer.  The film itself goes too far with his transformation in the final couple of scenes, but he does get an absolutely wonderful few minutes during a Miner's Union meeting.Charlize eventually lands a well-paying job at the local mine...one of the few women to work there.  This is arranged by her old friend (Frances MacDormand...an actress who can do no wrong in my book), the lone female union rep.  Naturally, these men, in 1989, who aren't used to working with women and who are a bit crude and uneducated themselves, begin to lay on the abuse.  And on.  And on.  And ON!!  Apparently, not one single decent male works in a coal mine.  Not only does not one come to the aide of these ladies...but most of the men actively seek to cause them humiliation, disgrace and physical harm.  When one man attempts to sexually assault Theron, and Theron makes the mistake of complaining...well, Theron is suddenly confronted at a very public setting by the wife of the accused man, who calls Theron all sorts of names and basically turns Theron into the town slut...right in front of everyone in town.  We feel great sympathy for Theron, and outrage...but its also very heavy-handed.Eventually, Theron can take it no more, and she convinces an attorney (Woody Harrelson) to file a suit on her behalf.  Intrigued at the possibility of the first ever sexual harassment class-action suit, he accepts her case.  The courtroom scenes are not your typical scenes (a la LAW AND ORDER), but are punctuated by one unbelievable outburst after another.  Harrelson bullies a miner into giving up the truth...but his tactics would have been halted almost immediately...yet the judge just sits there and the opposing council gives up her objections FAR too easily.  There are outbursts from the onlookers.  It's very silly.This film is so unsubtle in its presentation of the issues that I felt as though the viewer was being encouraged to actively hiss at all the men in the film.  Yes, there are some scenes when the other women show how scared they are to speak out, because they need the money so much.  That's certainly believable, and is a convincing dilemma.  But when the men start writing on the ladies lockerroom walls in excrement...it's a bit much.So the film ultimately had very little emotional payoff.  For all the praised heaped on Theron, I never really warmed to her.  She did three things:  1) party, 2) look angry, 3) cry.  No doubt what her character was going through would mean a lot of tears, but I felt at an emotional distance from her character because she felt so generic.  So her tears, whether of anger, sadness, relief or joy, never moved me.  She had a couple of good scenes with her 13 year old son, but towards the end of the film, she launches into a long speech designed to make him feel better about who is father might be...and all I could think of was wondering where this articulate woman had come from all of a sudden.For me, high points included enjoying MacDormand, and her relationship with her loving husband (played by Sean Bean, a real favorite...even though he had a hard time holding on to his accent).  But eventually, their relationship devolved into movie-of-the-week clich&eacute;.  Spacek was hardly used at all.  Harrelson was perfectly adequate.The movie nicely evokes the grayness of the geography and the bleakness of the mine.  But it also feels like a throwback...a NORMA RAE for this generation...as though its audience would be filled with people who had never heard of sexual harassment before.  It does stir some outrage...how could it not.  But it doesn't shed any new light on its subject.  A more interesting film might be to see how sexual harassment takes place in today's politically-correct world.  The film would have you believe that once some harassment policies were put in place, all the men learned how to behave themselves.  I doubt that the men shown in this film could do that...but we'll never know.  That would be too subtle.",3,Good acting mixed with surface-level script,1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,5478,"['NORTH', 'COUNTRY', 'stirring', 'film', 'very', 'obvious', 'level', 'outrage', 'same',

960559,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000CQLZ8S,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[8, 8]","In the tradition of 'Norma Rae', 'Silkwood', and 'Erin Brockovich' comes a movie which is entertaining, action-packed, and muckraking all in one.  Michael Seitzman tells the real-life story of Lois Jenson (Charlize Theron). Jenson encouraged her female co-workers to collectively protest their workplace harassment.The newly divorced single mother had returned to her Minnesota hometown looking for a way to support her family (Sammy and Karen). Upon the recommendation of an old friend Glory (Frances McDormand) she becomes a miner. The hardest challenges at the new job did not come from the physical labor however.  Instead they were from some of the male miners because those individuals became threatened by their new colleagues.Incidentally, these men are led by Bobby Sharp (played by Jeremy Renner) who used to date Josey in high school.After being sexually harassed on the job, Josey Aimes (a composite sketch of Lois Jenson) files a lawsuit against the Eveleth Mines and rallies some other female co-workers to her cause. These women face every conceivable odd against them in a modern ""David vs. Goliath"" epic. As the 'ringleader' of the protesting women, Aimes inevitably takes the brunt of it.Her crusade draws disapproval from many people in the town and many of her own colleagues at the mine. Her own parents Alice and Hank Aimes (Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins) just want Josey to accept things as they have been. Adding insult to injury, her own personal life is put under intensive scrutiny; what 'kind' of woman charges sexual harassment? Even Glory encourages her to let their mistreatment go.Yet, she perseveres and the women are victorious. In Jenson vs. Eveleth a 1997 court ruling said that the abuse which was received in those mines was a concerted campaign to completely destroy the women.Niki Caro's excellent directing prevented North Country from being a downer and/or a soapfest.  Theron and her co-actors also understood that this was a serious film, and thus did not attempt to ham things up for the camera. North Country even won the praises of the real-life Jenson who said it was close to her real-life experiences. She liked that this screenplay emphasized she and the other protesting women received support from some of the men in that same community.Glory's husband Kyle (Sean Ben) was a miner up until a dehabilitating accident laid him off. More ambiguous is Bill White (Woody Harelson) a high school hockey star who returns to his hometown after working in New York as a lawyer. Bill initially turns her request for a class action lawsuit down, but then accepts because it is `something different'. Josey pointedly says she draws her own inspiration from the then-current Anita Hill hearings's dramatization of workplace sexual harassment before national audiences.It's ironic that the film is being promoted as 'inspired' from the book Class Action, because Jenson remains critical of that account's accuracy. People wanting an accurate account of her journey only need this movie---which she has personally praised. It's always a good sign when the real-life people praise the works which are supposed to tell about them.With awesome music by Bob Dylan and Kim Carnes (among others) this film will definitely have you wanting to instigate some 'trouble' of your own.",5,Stand up for your right to see a good movie,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,3314,"['tradition', ""'Norma"", 'Rae', ""'Silkwood"", 'Brockovich', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'action-packed', 'muckraking', 'one', 'Michael', 'Seitzman', 'real-life', 'story', 'Lois', 'Jenson', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Jenson', 'encouraged', 'female', 'co-workers', 'collectively', 'protest', 'workplace', 'harassment.The', 'newly', 'divorced', 'single', 'mother', 'had', 'returned', 'Minnesota', 'hometown', 'looking', 'way', 'support', 'family', 'Sammy', 'Karen', 'recommendation', 'old', 'friend', 'Glory', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'miner', 'hardest', 'challenges', 'new', 'job', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'physical', 'labor', 'however', 'Instead', 'were', 'male', 'miners', 'individuals', 'became', 'threatened', 'new', 'colleagues.Incidentally', 'men', 'are', 'led', 'Bobby', 'Sharp', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'used', 'date', 'Josey', 'high', 'school.After', 'being', 'sexually', 'harassed', 'job', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'composite', 'sketch', 'Lois', 'Jenson', 'lawsuit', 'Eveleth', 'Mines', 'other', 'female', 'co-workers', 'cause', 'women', 'face', 'conceivable', 'odd', 'modern', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'epic', ""'ringleader"", 'protesting', 'women', 'Aimes', 'inevitably', 'brunt', 'it.Her', 'crusade', 'draws', 'disapproval', 'many', 'people', 'town', 'many', 'own', 'colleagues', 'mine', 'own', 'parents', 'Alice', 'Hank', 'Aimes', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'just', 'want', 'Josey', 'accept', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'own', 'personal', 'life', 'put', 'intensive', 'scrutiny', 'what', 'woman', 'charges', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'Even', 'Glory', 'let', 'mistreatment', 'go.Yet', 'women', 'are', 'victorious', 'Jenson', 'vs.', 'Eveleth', '1997', 'court', 'ruling', 'said', 'abuse', 'was', 'received', 'mines', 'was', 'concerted', 'campaign', 'completely', 'destroy', 'women.Niki', 'Caro', 'excellent', 'directing', 'prevented', 'North', 'Country', 'being', 'downer', 'soapfest', 'Theron', 'co-actors', 'also', 'understood', 'was', 'serious', 'film', 'thus', 'did', 'not', 'attempt', 'ham', 'things', 'up', 'camera', 'North', 'Country', 'even', 'won', 'praises', 'real-life', 'Jenson', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'close', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'liked', 'screenplay', 'emphasized', 'other', 'protesting', 'women', 'received', 'support', 'men', 'same', 'community.Glory', 'husband', 'Kyle', 'Sean', 'Ben', 'was', 'miner', 'up', 'dehabilitating', 'accident', 'laid', 'off', 'More', 'ambiguous', 'Bill', 'White', 'Woody', 'Harelson', 'high', 'school', 'hockey', 'star', 'who', 'hometown', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'initially', 'request', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'down', 'then', 'something', 'different', 'Josey', 'pointedly', 'own', 'inspiration', 'then-current', 'Anita', 'Hill', 'hearings', 'dramatization', 'workplace', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'national', 'audiences.It', 'ironic', 'film', 'being', 'promoted', ""'inspired"", 'book', 'Class', 'Action', 'Jenson', 'critical', 'account', 'accuracy', 'People', 'wanting', 'accurate', 'account', 'journey', 'only', 'need', 'movie', '-which', 'personally', 'praised', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'real-life', 'people', 'praise', 'works', 'are', 'supposed', 'tell', 'them.With', 'awesome', 'music', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Kim', 'Carnes', 'others', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'have', 'wanting', 'instigate', ""'trouble"", ""'"", 'own']",N/A

Zwick,"[6, 6]","**1/2If ""North Country"" didn't say that it was set in 1989, you'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters, which can only be classified as ""Neanderthal"" (though that might be an insult to Neanderthals).  And, indeed, you would be right NOT to believe it, for the events on which the film is based actually began in 1975, a full decade and a half before the time of the movie.  The drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the Clarence Thomas Senate hearings of 1991 - images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie.  It's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that doesn't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie.With Charlize Theron once again ugly-ing herself up for great drama, ""North Country"" tells the true but highly fictionalized story of Lois Jensen (here referred to as Josie Aimes), a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern Minnesota steel mine, only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment.  Here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make Henry Higgins look like Alan Alda in comparison.  When she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there, Aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant, the unenlightened townsfolk, or even her own female co-workers who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs.  Eventually, she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine (in 1988, actually, a full three years before the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill spectacle), resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country.There is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one, but ""North Country"" feels strangely out-of-date and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world (yes, I realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be, but that still doesn`t make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie).  Moreover, ""North Country"" can't quite shake that air of stultifying self-importance that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues.  As a result, the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme, with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero, villain and victim molds with very little shading in between.  Despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story, the film is riddled with push button feel-good moments and implausible instant conversions - and damned if the whole thing doesn't have the look and feel of a Lifetime original movie, just with higher priced stars in its cast (Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sissy Spacek, and Richard Jenkins, the dead father from ""Six Feet Under"").  And while the acting is decent, the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters.Perhaps it's just that after movies like  ""Norma Rae,"" ""Silkwood,"" and ""Erin Brockovich,"" which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised, ""North Country"" comes up a day late and a dollar short in the I-am-woman-hear-me-roar department.",2,"good intentions, plodding drama",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3398,"['North', 'Country', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'set', '1989', ""'d"", 'never', 'believe', 'based', 'attitudes', 'behavior', 'male', 'characters', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'classified', 'Neanderthal', 'might', 'be', 'insult', 'Neanderthals', 'indeed', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'NOT', 'believe', 'events', 'film', 'based', 'actually', 'began', '1975', 'full', 'decade', 'half', 'time', 'movie', 'drama', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'forward', 'time', 'accommodate', 'footage', 'Clarence', 'Thomas', 'Senate', 'hearings', '1991', 'images', 'play', 'continually', 'background', 'sort', 'running', 'commentary', 'foreground', 'action', 'movie', 'sleight-of-hand', 'maneuver', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'enhance', 'verisimilitude', 'movie.With', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'once', 'again', 'ugly-ing', 'up', 'great', 'drama', 'North', 'Country', 'true', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'Lois', 'Jensen', 'here', 'referred', 'Josie', 'Aimes', 'battered', 'welfare', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'job', 'northern', 'Minnesota', 'steel', 'mine', 'only', 'find', 'be', 'veritable', 'hell', 'hole', 'unbridled', 'misogyny', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'Here', 'are', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'chauvinistic', 'view', 'treatment', 'women', 'make', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'look', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'comparison', 'When', 'take', 'stand', 'outrages', 'perpetrated', 'other', 'women', 'there', 'Aimes', 'little', 'support', 'bigwigs', 'plant', 'unenlightened', 'townsfolk', 'even', 'own', 'female', 'co-workers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'terrorized', 'silence', 'order', 'keep', 'jobs', 'Eventually', 'file', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'mine', '1988', 'actually', 'full', 'three', 'years', 'Clarence', 'Thomas/Anita', 'Hill', 'spectacle', 'resulting', 'landmark', 'decision', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'laws', 'country.There', 'doubt', 'issue', 'gender', 'equity', 'workplace', 'serious', 'important', 'one', 'North', 'Country', 'feels', 'strangely', 'out-of-date', 'lacking', 'vitality', 'age', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'laws', 'have', 'become', 'common', 'place', 'business', 'world', 'yes', 'realize', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'such', 'laws', 'eventually', 'came', 'be', 'still', 'doesn', 't', 'make', 'fresh', 'topic', 'contemporary', 'movie', 'Moreover', 'North', 'Country', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'shake', 'air', 'stultifying', 'self-importance', 'too', 'often', 'dramas', 'dealing', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'result', 'film', 'often', 'plodding', 'pacing', 'obvious', 'theme', 'characters', 'falling', 'bit', 'too', 'neatly', 'hero', 'villain', 'victim', 'molds', 'very', 'little', 'shading', 'good', 'intentions', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'riddled', 'push', 'button', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'implausible', 'instant', 'conversions', 'damned', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'feel', 'Lifetime', 'original', 'movie', 'just', 'higher', 'priced', 'stars', 'cast', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'dead', 'father', 'Six', 'Feet', 'acting', 'decent', 'suffocating', 'nature', 'drama', 'most', 'performers', 'breaking', 'out', 'really', 'having', 'go', 'characters.Perhaps', 'just', 'movies', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'Silkwood', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'one', 'care', 'people', 'issues', 'raised', 'North', 'Country', 'up', 'day', 'late', 'dollar', 'short', 'I-am-woman-hear-me-roar', 'department']",N/A
960562,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000CQLZ8S,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 5]","For two-thirds of its running time, Niki Caro's ""North Country"" is a nuanced, impressive addition to blue collar cinema. The movie is about sexual harrassment, but director Caro and star Charlize Theron intimately understand the local flavor - the iron ore strip mines of northern Minnesota - and the lead Josie Ames, a ""good-lookin"" but wounded woman - smart, but rough around the edges. The abuse that she and her fellow female mine workers suffer at times seems akin to those ludicrous beatings Rocky use to take in his movies. Then again, we're talking about hardened stock.Then ""North Country"" nosedives into such sappy, ridiculous territory over its last half hour that it does serious injustice to its opening movements and the woman upon which the movie is based. And yet the movie keeps enough of that under its lid to work at first.Caro is a skilled visual director - she proved that to some extent in ""Whale Rider - mixing overhead shots of the mine with more claustrophobic moments of filth and unpleasant intimacy. She mostly holds off on a musical score. A scene with Josie and Bobby in the mine is overplayed, but visually stunning for a shot of Bobby ascending a wet, sun-drenched ramp.Theron is no monster in ""North Country"" but she plays blue collar notes pretty well. She suffers with glassy eyes and crustiness until she can't suffer anymore. She employs, as she did in ""Monster,"" a lower class humor. Critics are probably too surprised by these transformations - Theron has not played that many pinups in her career - but she hangs in there with McDormand, an organic talent if there was one, who plays Josie's union rep Glory. Theron is best in tense moments with Josie's parents, played by Richard Jenkins and Sissy Spacek.But the end calls into question Caro and Theron's motives, frankly, serving up Josie as a lifelong victim instead of just a recent one, and providing a bizarre, unlikely motivation for the worst of Josie's tormentors, Bobby Sharp (Jeremy Renner) to harrass her. Oh it's based on his inadequacies all right, but not the ones you'd think. When Josie's lawyer (an average Woody Harrelson) breaks Bobby down in a absurd replay of ""A Few Good Men,"" the courtroom morphs into the last scene of ""Dead Poets Society."" I half expected Theron to nod, smugly grin, and say ""Thank you girls."" Let's not even get started on Frances McDormand in a wheelchair and a spoon in her hand.It's a kind of easy, pat way of looking at the issue of harrassment that, in the more female-centered (and sue happy) 21st Century, ignores the complexity. The men are almost unanimously cowards and villains. And dumb to boot, so open are they with their cruelty. Bobby devises schemes to humiliate and hurt Josie. A few more months and he may have killed her. When his wife berates Josie before she has said a word to anybody about her abuse - indeed, the public scene seems to motivate Josie more than anything - we sense martydom, not an outcast.",3,Goes south in its final courtroom scenes,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,2964,"['two-thirds', 'running', 'time', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'North', 'Country', 'nuanced', 'impressive', 'addition', 'blue', 'collar', 'cinema', 'movie', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'director', 'Caro', 'star', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'intimately', 'understand', 'local', 'flavor', 'iron', 'ore', 'strip', 'mines', 'northern', 'Minnesota', 'lead', 'Josie', 'Ames', 'good-lookin', 'wounded', 'woman', 'smart', 'rough', 'edges', 'abuse', 'fellow', 'female', 'mine', 'workers', 'suffer', 'times', 'akin', 'ludicrous', 'beatings', 'Rocky', 'use', 'take', 'movies', 'Then', 'again', ""'re"", 'talking', 'hardened', 'stock.Then', 'North', 'Country', 'nosedives', 'such', 'sappy', 'ridiculous', 'territory', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'serious', 'injustice', 'opening', 'movements', 'woman', 'movie', 'based', 'yet', 'movie', 'enough', 'lid', 'work', 'first.Caro', 'skilled', 'visual', 'director', 'proved', 'extent', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'mixing', 'overhead', 'shots', 'mine', 'more', 'claustrophobic', 'moments', 'filth', 'unpleasant', 'intimacy', 'mostly', 'off', 'musical', 'score', 'scene', 'Josie', 'Bobby', 'mine', 'overplayed', 'visually', 'stunning', 'shot', 'Bobby', 'ascending', 'wet', 'sun-drenched', 'ramp.Theron', 'monster', 'North', 'Country', 'blue', 'collar', 'notes', 'pretty', 'well', 'glassy', 'eyes', 'crustiness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'anymore', 'did', 'Monster', 'lower', 'class', 'humor', 'Critics', 'are', 'probably', 'too', 'surprised', 'transformations', 'Theron', 'not', 'played', 'many', 'pinups', 'career', 'McDormand', 'organic', 'talent', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'Josie', 'union', 'rep', 'Glory', 'Theron', 'best', 'tense', 'moments', 'Josie', 'parents', 'played', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Sissy', 'Spacek.But', 'end', 'question', 'Caro', 'Theron', 'motives', 'frankly', 'serving', 'up', 'Josie', 'lifelong', 'victim', 'instead', 'just', 'recent', 'one', 'providing', 'bizarre', 'unlikely', 'motivation', 'worst', 'Josie', 'tormentors', 'Bobby', 'Sharp', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'harrass', 'based', 'inadequacies', 'right', 'not', 'ones', ""'d"", 'think', 'When', 'Josie', 'lawyer', 'average', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Bobby', 'down', 'absurd', 'replay', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'courtroom', 'morphs', 'last', 'scene', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'half', 'expected', 'Theron', 'nod', 'smugly', 'grin', 'say', 'Thank', 'girls', 'Let', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'started', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'wheelchair', 'spoon', 'hand.It', 'kind', 'easy', 'pat', 'way', 'looking', 'issue', 'harrassment', 'more', 'female-centered', 'sue', 'happy', '21st', 'Century', 'complexity', 'men', 'are', 'almost', 'unanimously', 'cowards', 'villains', 'dumb', 'boot', 'open', 'are', 'cruelty', 'Bobby', 'schemes', 'humiliate', 'hurt', 'Josie', 'A', 'few', 'more', 'months', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'When', 'wife', 'berates', 'Josie', 'said', 'word', 'anybody', 'abuse', 'indeed', 'public', 'scene', 'motivate', 'Josie', 'more', 'anything', 'sense', 'martydom', 'not', 'outcast']",N/A

It's interesting to note that it was not too long ago, actually only in the last decade of the previous century that women obtained legal protection in this area. It's so weird to think back to the constant harrasment women had to endure before these laws were established.Well, the movie is certainly excellent ... a tear jerker at times, but it's a great story ... and it's certainly not the cozy popcorn-crunching flick for a Saturday afternoon, although I watched it on a Saturday afternoon at the theatre. The acting is superb and aside from Charlize Theron who always delivers the best performances, Woody Harrelson is very likeable in this role, and Richard Jenkins also did an excellent job. The photography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is pretty cool and appropriate for the atmosphere with several Bob Dylan tunes.Surprisingly there isn't much courtroom drama as the focus seems to be more on relationships and also on the portrayal of blue-collar America as well as on the topical content. It's a harsh reality and it ain't pretty at times, and if you're driving your BMW and are living in a warmer climate state with nice homes, clean yards, and good restaurants, etc. then you'll appreciate your lifestyle a lot more after watching this movie.

960567,A1HFGK0HX39XYK,B000CQLZ8S,Simon Mounsey,"[3, 3]","After finally viewing Niki Caro's well-praised North Country for the first time on DVD I realized something historic had happened- for the first time since The Green Mile in 1999, I was feeling the uncontrollable, intense sensation of wallowing in my own tears.North Country, the story of Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron in her Oscar nominated role) and her revolutionary fight against her workplace for sexual harassment has to be one of the most powerful films I've seen in years.Josey, a young single mother of two comes to Northern Minnesota as the film commences in hopes to find work. Luckily, she runs into Glory (Frances McDormand) who so happens to be the first woman ever to work in the Iron Mines and so she persuades Josey to work at the mine. However, once she arrives at the mine Josey quickly finds that the mine isn't that great. The men in the mine, feeling threatened by the women taking their jobs, are verbally abusive, not to mention physically.Despite her fight to stay with the company, Josey eventually quits and files a lawsuit with lawyer Bill White (Woody Harrelson), but with most of the other women refusing to lose their jobs Josey has a long fight ahead of her.Charlize Theron yet again shows that she is one of the top actresses with her riveting performance as Josey while Frances McDormand, back with her Fargo accent, has never been better as the tough, aged truck driver of the mine who becomes stricken with Lou Gherig's disease.The men in the film also put on good performances. Woody Harrelson is great as Josey's lawyer/ love interest and Richard Jenkins from HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" couldn't be better as Josey's father who goes from despising his own daughter to standing by her side.Niki Caro did a superb job directing the film, choosing to show the story chronologically juxtaposed with scenes of the court battle. However, no scene in my humble opinion is better pulled off than that of when Josey must walk to the top of the conveyor of the mine. In this scene Caro pieces together a collage of quick cuts of her walking up, sweating and frightened for what lies ahead, giving it a claustrophobic-like feel to it.Unlike most movies based on real events, Caro was smart in not trying to emulate the exact events, but rather to create a story circulating around the same scenario. Much depth was added to the film by incorporating a family drama between Josey and her disapproving teenaged son that doesn't seem tacked on but instead brings a raw sensibility to her character and to their respective relationship.On the disc itself, there are several deleted scenes that unlike most DVD's are actually worth watching. The making-of documentary ""Stories from North Country"" on the other hand, while it is an okay documentary that included the real women in which the film is based, didn't really add anything that I didn't already know after seeing the movie.While it may not be a film garnering the big bucks at the box office, North Country is an important film people must see. It captures the emotions and sticks the topic of sexual harassment in your face, but it refuses to make all men at the mine look evil, which is exactly how it should've been done.",5,Wow!,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,3200,"['finally', 'viewing', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'well-praised', 'North', 'Country', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'realized', 'something', 'historic', 'had', 'happened-', 'first', 'time', 'Green', 'Mile', '1999', 'was', 'feeling', 'uncontrollable', 'intense', 'sensation', 'wallowing', 'own', 'tears.North', 'Country', 'story', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'revolutionary', 'fight', 'workplace', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.Josey', 'young', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'Northern', 'Minnesota', 'film', 'commences', 'hopes', 'find', 'work', 'Luckily', 'Glory', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'who', 'so', 'be', 'first', 'woman', 'ever', 'work', 'Iron', 'Mines', 'so', 'Josey', 'work', 'mine', 'However', 'once', 'mine', 'Josey', 'quickly', 'mine', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'men', 'mine', 'feeling', 'threatened', 'women', 'taking', 'jobs', 'are', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'not', 'mention', 'physically.Despite', 'fight', 'stay', 'company', 'Josey', 'eventually', 'lawsuit', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'White', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'most', 'other', 'women', 'refusing', 'lose', 'jobs', 'Josey', 'long', 'fight', 'ahead', 'her.Charlize', 'Theron', 'yet', 'again', 'one', 'top', 'actresses', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Josey', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'back', 'Fargo', 'accent', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'tough', 'aged', 'truck', 'driver', 'mine', 'who', 'stricken', 'Lou', 'Gherig', 'disease.The', 'men', 'film', 'also', 'put', 'good', 'performances', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'great', 'Josey', 'lawyer/', 'love', 'interest', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'HBO', 'Six', 'Feet', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'Josey', 'father', 'who', 'despising', 'own', 'daughter', 'standing', 'side.Niki', 'Caro', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'choosing', 'show', 'story', 'chronologically', 'juxtaposed', 'scenes', 'court', 'battle', 'However', 'scene', 'humble', 'opinion', 'better', 'pulled', 'off', 'when', 'Josey', 'must', 'walk', 'top', 'conveyor', 'mine', 'scene', 'Caro', 'together', 'collage', 'quick', 'cuts', 'walking', 'up', 'sweating', 'frightened', 'what', 'ahead', 'giving', 'claustrophobic-like', 'feel', 'it.Unlike', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Caro', 'was', 'smart', 'not', 'trying', 'emulate', 'exact', 'events', 'rather', 'create', 'story', 'circulating', 'same', 'scenario', 'Much', 'depth', 'was', 'added', 'film', 'incorporating', 'family', 'drama', 'Josey', 'disapproving', 'teenaged', 'son', ""n't"", 'seem', 'tacked', 'instead', 'raw', 'sensibility', 'character', 'respective', 'relationship.On', 'disc', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'DVD', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Stories', 'North', 'Country', 'other', 'hand', 'okay', 'documentary', 'included', 'real', 'women', 'film', 'based', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'seeing', 'movie.While', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'garnering', 'big', 'bucks', 'box', 'office', 'North', 'Country', 'important', 'film', 'people', 'must', 'see', 'emotions', 'topic', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'face', 'make', 'men', 'mine', 'look', 'evil', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done']",N/A

Josie is finally pushed too far and turns to Bill White (Woody Harrelson), a former Hockey Player turned lawyer, to help her sue the mine.""North Country"", directed by Niki Caro (""Whale Rider""), is `inspired by true events'. This means that there was an actual sexual harassment case brought to court by a woman working at a mine in Minnesota, but all of the names have been changed, allowing the filmmakers some dramatic license. That case would change the landscape of the workplace throughout the country.Thank goodness. If even half of what is portrayed in this film actually happened, the men in this mine were pigs. They don't look kindly on the women for `taking jobs that aren't there to take', meaning they think that the women are taking jobs away from other men. This is always such a bad argument that it is a wonder it always resurfaces in some form or another.Any film with Frances McDormand (""Fargo"") and Sissy Spacek (""In the Bedroom"") joining the recently minted Theron is going to be at least interesting. ""North County"" is a lot better because of these three actresses.Theron (""Monster"") is very good as Josey, a fairly typical character in this type of film, but there is an underlying force, brought by the actress, making her a little electrifying, a little more interesting. Her domestic life hasn't been wonderful.  Josey had Sammy when she was 16. Karen's father is the guy who beats up on her. When she finds she needs to return home to her parents, her Dad asks her ""Where you cheating on him?"" looking for a reason for him beating his daughter. Life at the mine is no cakewalk either. She realizes that she shouldn't have to put up with the harassment, but she does because she doesn't want to create waves for her father or the other women who work there. When she finally does decide to sue the mine, their lawyer brings up her past, which ultimately works against them. She also has a difficult time with Sammy, a typical pre-teen and subject to the peer pressure that most kids his age have to put up with. When Josey begins to make waves, many people, men and women, begin to fear what a possible lawsuit could do to their livelihood. They call her names, won't let their sons pass to Sammy during a hockey game and the like. Naturally, he takes it out on her and their already rocky relationship hits a new low. But Josey, like a lot of women, will do anything for her kids. Basically, Josey just wants to be able to work. When she finds this impossible due to all of the sexual harassment, and her job is on the line, she decides to take them to court. Theron's performance is the centerpiece of the film and it is always believable. We get a sense that this woman actually lived; perhaps Theron is basing the character on someone she knows, because it is very good.Frances McDormand is, as always, good. Her character, Glory, seems tailor made for an Academy Award nomination. Glory ultimately proves to be the lynchpin to Josey's case and she has a physical problem that develops fairly quickly. Both of these elements are like sugar to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. To the group who picks the Oscars, the only thing better than someone standing up against a large institution is someone who gets sick while standing up against a large institution. But throughout, McDormand doesn't seem to realize that her character is like candy to the Academy's baby. She works very hard to make her character credible and real. And she succeeds. The best part of her character is her relationship with Kyle (Sean Bean). Kyle used to work at the mine until he hurt his back. Now he stays at home and repairs watches while his partner, Glory, works at the mine driving trucks and participating in the union. Their relationship is very interesting, very modern and completely believable.Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins are very believable as Josey's parents. Very old school, Hank immediately assumes it's the wife's fault every time his daughter has a problem. He doesn't want her to work at the mine, because she is a woman. Hank initially serves as our personal filter to the male persona so pervasive throughout his workplace. Spacek's Alice has always been a stay at home mom. In her world, the husband goes off to work and earns the money; the woman stays at home and tends to the house. She seems to support some of the awkward views her husband expresses, making them all the more horrific. Later, as the story develops, as she realizes what Josey has gone through, she begins to adopt more modern views, forcing her husband to do the same. Again, we have seen this type of situation in many films and television shows, but the actor and director work in a reserved manner to make the performances believable.Niki Caro's second film, ""North Country"" explores many of the same issues of her critically acclaimed debut ""Whale Rider"". Both films tell the story of a strained relationship between father and daughter; both films depict a community uneasy with the protagonist's actions. The community depicted in ""North Country"" is even fairly insular, as the New Zealand village is in ""Whale"". Niki Caro seems to bring a lot of heart and emotion to the characters in her films, whether it is a small fishing village in New Zealand or a small town in Northern Minnesota. Really, the biggest difference between the two films is the climate.""North Country"" is a very good film depicting another sad moment in our country's history.",4,Powerful Acting Lifts

She is prepared for the back-breaking and often dangerous work, but coping with the harassment she and the other female miners encounter from their male coworkers proves far more challenging.

960573,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CQLZ8S,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","`North Country' is not the first socially conscious film that features an inspirational story about a woman who stands up for her right. We know `Norma Rae' and more recently `Erin Brockovich' (both of which brought deserved Oscar to the leading ladies). I don't know `North Country' can do the same for Charlize Theron. But her acting proves that without special make-up (as she did in `Monster'), she can really act and move our heart.Not that the film is flawless. The story is inspired by true events (especially one 1984 lawsuit), but the approach of director Niki Caro (`Whale Rider') is often too melodramatic to take the story as it is. But the main story about Josey Aimes is as strong as the Maori girl we all loved.The story is about Josey Aimes (Theron) working for a local taconite mine company in Minnesota, who, together with other female workers, had been constantly harassed sexually by some of the male workers. The acting of Theron (and anyone in the film) is convincing enough to make us feel the pains of the humiliated females. And to experience them is often nerve-shattering.Theron leads the ensemble cast that includes Frances McDormand, Sean Bean, Woody Harrelson, Jeremy Renner, Richard Jenkins, and Sissy Spacek. We must give due credit to Niki Caro who extracted the best performances from them. We have been accustomed to seeing the superb acting from Frances McDormand who is always excellent, but if you see usually typecast Sean Bean showing the depth of the character, it is really surprising.So far, the film is great. But there are two more stories in the film-one about the high schooldays of Josey, and the other is about the courtroom drama about her lawsuit. Sorry if I sound too harsh, but none of them works. I cannot write the details of these stories, but I can say this. The judge of this film allows Josey's lawyer to employ highly irregular method of proving one important fact, very theatrical method last time seen in `A Few Good Men.'More regrettable thing is this. Everything that the defense attorney (who is supposed to be good enough to be hired by a big company) does is incredibly stupid. She summons a witness while she doesn't need it; she storms into a hospital room while all she has to do is to wait. And don't forget her expensive suit, clich&eacute;d image of icy female lawyer, which totally undermines the impact of the real events.As far as the acting and the important story about Josey who fights for justice, `North Country' deserves genuine admiration. But the film tells not much about anything else, such as the background about the male workers' hostility, or other female workers' views on the job. Instead, the film spends more time telling melodramatic accounts of the lawsuit which are, I believe, not what really happened. The film is strong and persuasive, but could be more so with a better script.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Inspirational Story, Strong Performances from the Cast, But the Courtroom Scenes Are Ineffective",1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,2878,"['North', 'Country', 'not', 'first', 'socially', 'conscious', 'film', 'inspirational', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'right', 'know', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'more', 'recently', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'brought', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'leading', 'ladies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'North', 'Country', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'acting', 'proves', 'special', 'make-up', 'did', 'Monster', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'move', 'heart.Not', 'film', 'flawless', 'story', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'especially', 'one', '1984', 'lawsuit', 'approach', 'director', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'often', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'take', 'story', 'main', 'story', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'as', 'strong', 'Maori', 'girl', 'loved.The', 'story', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'Theron', 'working', 'local', 'taconite', 'mine', 'company', 'Minnesota', 'who', 'together', 'other', 'female', 'workers', 'had', 'been', 'constantly', 'harassed', 'sexually', 'male', 'workers', 'acting', 'Theron', 'anyone', 'film', 'convincing', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'pains', 'humiliated', 'females', 'experience', 'often', 'nerve-shattering.Theron', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'must', 'give', 'due', 'credit', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'who', 'extracted', 'best', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'superb', 'acting', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'who', 'always', 'excellent', 'see', 'usually', 'typecast', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'showing', 'depth', 'character', 'really', 'surprising.So', 'far', 'film', 'great', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'stories', 'film-one', 'high', 'schooldays', 'Josey', 'other', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'lawsuit', 'Sorry', 'sound', 'too', 'harsh', 'none', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'details', 'stories', 'can', 'say', 'judge', 'film', 'Josey', 'lawyer', 'employ', 'highly', 'irregular', 'method', 'proving', 'one', 'important', 'fact', 'very', 'theatrical', 'method', 'last', 'time', 'seen', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', ""'More"", 'regrettable', 'thing', 'Everything', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'hired', 'big', 'company', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'witness', ""n't"", 'need', 'hospital', 'room', 'do', 'wait', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'expensive', 'suit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'image', 'icy', 'female', 'lawyer', 'totally', 'impact', 'real', 'events.As', 'far', 'acting', 'important', 'story', 'Josey', 'who', 'fights', 'justice', 'North', 'Country', 'deserves', 'genuine', 'admiration', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'such', 'background', 'male', 'workers', 'hostility', 'other', 'female', 'workers', 'views', 'job', 'Instead', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'telling', 'melodramatic', 'accounts', 'lawsuit', 'are', 'believe', 'not', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'film', 'strong', 'persuasive', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'better', 'script']",N/A

I think her role in this film is not as challenging as Monster's, but she's so convincing and powerful that she's very likely going to get another best actress nomination. Got to give her extra credit for getting all deglamorized and dirty for her role.The movie starts with the Josey Aimes in the courtroom scene in trial against her mining company for sexual harrassment. The story of her life's most influential experiences and her days working at the mines are unfolded in flashbacks. Josey is a single mother with two kids, her son is the offspring of a rape incident that took place when she was 16, but was never revealed until much later, and her younger daughter is fathered by her abusive husband whom she had to run away from. Josey is clearly a much condemned and traumatized character since she had to endure all kinds of negative treatments from her husband, the townsfolks, and even her father who had stopped loving her when she became pregnant as a teenager. She struggles financially with low income from her hair-washing job. She was then encouraged by her friend Glory(Frances McDormand) who was the first woman to work in the mines to take a job at the mining company. Her life is about to take a drastic turn when she starts to work at a job where no women were welcome by men, even her father(Hank/Richard Jenkins) who works at the mines disapproved her decision.As a woman, it's a nasty for Josey to be working at the mines, because most of the men treated her without respect and gradually there would be verbal and physical harrassments towards her. Even the several fellow female co-workers get to routinely go through similar treatments from those dirty and horny men in the company. To give an example, the men would write nasty griffiti in the women's locker room, they would put a sex toy in one of the women's lunch box, they even ejaculate semens into the women's clothes in the lockers. How can any woman go to work and endure this kind of treatments? Certainly not Josey Aimes who had enough of it and she was the only one to file a lawsuit aginst the company operated by a man that ignored her complaint.Bill White(Woody Harrelson) is the lawyer Josey persuaded to help her fight for her justice. At first, nobody else would join her to make a class action that was neccessary to win the the lawsuit. At this point, her life has reached a very volatile state. Even her son is misled to believe that she's a whore and liar. Her mother Alice(Sissy Spacek) loves her unconditionally, but ends up fighting with her husband about the daughter. How can Josey convince the people to support her and win the lawsuit?Frances McDormand plays her fierce and tough talking strong woman character convincingly. She stole scenes even when her character became terminally ill, and her relationship with her boyfriend Kyle(Sean Bean) was quite wonderful and touching. Sissy Spacek's scenes were kind of uneven in the early parts of the film, and she had merely a few tender moments to work with later on. Linda Edmund(Leslie Conlin) is very striking as a the rival attorney in court. Amber Heard(young Josey) not only does she look like a young version of Charliz Theron, she was very good with her minimal screentime, especially the rape scene.Overall, this film has some intense and gripping moments, and some funny and tearjerking moments as well. The cinematograpy truly captures the grim look of the mining community of Northern Minisota. On the surface, this might look like a chick flick and somewhat male bashing, but it's just trying to stay true to what really happened to the heroine of this film, and the result is a compelling drama.",4,"""The Truth Will Set Her Free.""",1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,3964,"['North', 'Country', 'great', 'vehicle', 'showcase', 'talented', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Monster', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'took', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'killing', 'victimizers', 'now', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'character', 'tries', 'win', 'justice', 'law', 'Again', 'victim', 'volatile', 'state', 'perfection', 'think', 'role', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'challenging', 'Monster', 'so', 'convincing', 'powerful', 'very', 'likely', 'going', 'get', 'best', 'actress', 'nomination', 'Got', 'give', 'extra', 'credit', 'getting', 'deglamorized', 'dirty', 'role.The', 'movie', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'trial', 'mining', 'company', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'story', 'life', 'most', 'influential', 'experiences', 'days', 'working', 'mines', 'are', 'unfolded', 'flashbacks', 'Josey', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'kids', 'son', 'offspring', 'rape', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'when', 'was', '16', 'was', 'never', 'revealed', 'much', 'later', 'younger', 'daughter', 'fathered', 'abusive', 'husband', 'whom', 'had', 'run', 'away', 'Josey', 'clearly', 'much', 'condemned', 'traumatized', 'character', 'had', 'endure', 'kinds', 'negative', 'treatments', 'husband', 'townsfolks', 'even', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'stopped', 'loving', 'when', 'became', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'financially', 'low', 'income', 'hair-washing', 'job', 'was', 'then', 'encouraged', 'friend', 'Glory', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'work', 'mines', 'take', 'job', 'mining', 'company', 'life', 'take', 'drastic', 'turn', 'when', 'work', 'job', 'where', 'women', 'were', 'welcome', 'men', 'even', 'father', 'Hank/Richard', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'mines', 'disapproved', 'decision.As', 'woman', 'nasty', 'Josey', 'be', 'working', 'mines', 'most', 'men', 'treated', 'respect', 'gradually', 'would', 'be', 'verbal', 'physical', 'harrassments', 'Even', 'several', 'fellow', 'female', 'co-workers', 'get', 'routinely', 'go', 'similar', 'treatments', 'dirty', 'horny', 'men', 'company', 'give', 'example', 'men', 'would', 'write', 'nasty', 'griffiti', 'women', 'locker', 'room', 'would', 'put', 'sex', 'toy', 'one', 'women', 'lunch', 'box', 'even', 'ejaculate', 'semens', 'women', 'clothes', 'lockers', 'How', 'can', 'woman', 'go', 'work', 'endure', 'kind', 'treatments', 'Certainly', 'not', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'company', 'operated', 'man', 'ignored', 'complaint.Bill', 'White', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'lawyer', 'Josey', 'persuaded', 'help', 'fight', 'justice', 'first', 'nobody', 'else', 'would', 'join', 'make', 'class', 'action', 'was', 'neccessary', 'win', 'lawsuit', 'point', 'life', 'reached', 'very', 'volatile', 'state', 'Even', 'son', 'misled', 'believe', 'whore', 'liar', 'mother', 'Alice', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'unconditionally', 'up', 'fighting', 'husband', 'daughter', 'How', 'can', 'Josey', 'convince', 'people', 'support', 'win', 'lawsuit', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'fierce', 'tough', 'talking', 'strong', 'woman', 'character', 'convincingly', 'stole', 'scenes', 'even', 'when', 'character', 'became', 'terminally', 'ill', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'Kyle', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'was', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'scenes', 'were', 'kind', 'uneven', 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'had', 'merely', 'few', 'tender', 'moments', 'work', 'later', 'Linda', 'Edmund', 'Leslie', 'Conlin', 'very', 'striking', 'rival', 'attorney', 'court', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'young', 'Josey', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'young', 'version', 'Charliz', 'Theron', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'minimal', 'screentime', 'especially', 'rape', 'scene.Overall', 'film', 'intense', 'gripping', 'moments', 'funny', 'tearjerking', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'cinematograpy', 'truly', 'grim', 'look', 'mining', 'community', 'Northern', 'Minisota', 'surface', 'might', 'look', 'chick', 'flick', 'somewhat', 'male', 'bashing', 'just', 'trying', 'stay', 'true', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'heroine', 'film', 'result', 'compelling', 'drama']",N/A
960578,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,B000CQLZ8S,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[1, 2]","What a curious beast is the homo sapien -- of either gender. And yet at some point in our lives, if we are to be honest, haven't we all ducked behind some wall of safety, even when it means an increase to our own suffering? It is one of the more shadowy sides of human nature. We are hurt, and yet when our peers, equally hurt alongside us, we still side with an enemy rather than confront the unspeakable. History is filled to bursting with such cases.""North Country,"" directed by Niki Caro and starring Charlize Theron in the lead role of Josey Aimes (with a strong performance by Frances McDormand as her friend and coworker, later suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease) is based on a true story about a landmark sexual harrassment class action suit filed by a female mine worker in northern Minnesota in the late 1980s/early 90s. As the movie opens, Josey is the victim of repeated domestic violence, and at last she breaks free of a bad marriage and returns to her hometown in Minnesota with her two children to start a new life. As we put together bits and pieces of her past, we, the audience, realize this is a woman born into a mining family (her father, Hank Aimes as played by Richard Jenkins, still works in the mines and is angry when his daughter invades his territory, so to speak, and takes on work in ""his"" mine) and with a troubled youth. Her children have different fathers, and the community in which she grew up is not forgiving of what that implies about a young woman's choices. But she has spunk, we see that early on, because it takes courage to leave an abusive marriage, and it takes courage to stand up to a father whose approval she can't help craving, as all daughters surely do. And it takes a great deal of courage to take a job in a male-dominated field like mining.Yet Josey doesn't necessarily strike us as being a ""hero."" She's not looking for a fight. She's not looking to make waves. She's a single mother trying to support her kids, buy a modest house, put food on the table. In this town, few jobs are available, but the most lucrative is mining. Why not. She's willing to work hard for a buck.But Josey's coworkers are not so willing. The worst of human nature soon surfaces. Men at the mine resent women, citing few jobs as the cause, but it is apparent that is but an excuse for male posturing and sexual assault. One wonders how the male would behave without legal constraints to rein in his testosterone. Certainly this is a nightmare to watch. The few female miners are constantly tormented. Obscene gestures and drawings on walls are the least of their troubles. They must endure being groped and grabbed, they can't open their lockers or lunchboxes without finding, shall we say, reminders of male anatomy and its functions. At worst, they are threatened with rape. But the women endure it all, keeping brave faces to their tormentors, staying strong.There's a different kind of strength, though, and perhaps it is the hardest to achieve. The strength required to stand up against such tormentors and say enough is enough, draw firm boundaries for acceptable behavior, and to stand alone against screaming masses -- few of us can reach that kind of heroism. ""North Country"" shows how a community works overtime to keep its ugliest secrets secret, how individuals sink into deep denial, how even friends will betray friends rather than risk sticking their necks out. Josey herself submits and submits and submits, until she can submit no more. To watch the progressing of the abuse these women must endure is painful, as it should be. To watch how the abused women themselves conspire to keep their torment hidden is most painful of all, yet that too appears in society today in various guises.A court drama, thankfully not drawn out too long, with Woody Harrelson playing Josey's somewhat reluctant lawyer, brings the situation to a head. As another voice at long last joins Josey's in addressing the harrassment, one by one, more rise to join the chorus.If this is not perhaps the most excellent movie I've seen in terms of script or scene or story, it is an important statement, an enlightening look at the shame of both genders when committing or enabling sexual harrassment, of a community quick to judge in order to protect one's sheltered little worlds. As the saying, paraphrased, goes, if one person anywhere must endure such abuse, we are all guilty. There are opportunities every day to speak up and speak out against the objectification of human beings, about the cruelties of one group against another. ""North Country"" is a reminder to do so. Every voice matters, if only because it gives courage to the next voice.",5,"Northern Chill, Broken Ice",1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,4673,"['What', 'curious', 'beast', 'homo', 'sapien', 'gender', 'yet', 'point', 'lives', 'are', 'be', 'honest', 'have', ""n't"", 'ducked', 'wall', 'safety', 'even', 'when', 'increase', 'own', 'suffering', 'one', 'more', 'shadowy', 'sides', 'human', 'nature', 'are', 'hurt', 'yet', 'when', 'peers', 'equally', 'hurt', 'still', 'side', 'enemy', 'rather', 'confront', 'unspeakable', 'History', 'filled', 'bursting', 'such', 'cases', 'North', 'Country', 'directed', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'starring', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'lead', 'role', 'Josey', 'Aimes', 'strong', 'performance', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'friend', 'coworker', 'later', 'suffering', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'disease', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'landmark', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'class', 'action', 'suit', 'filed', 'female', 'mine', 'worker', 'northern', 'Minnesota', 'late', '1980s/early', '90s', 'movie', 'Josey', 'victim', 'repeated', 'domestic', 'violence', 'last', 'breaks', 'free', 'bad', 'marriage', 'returns', 'hometown', 'Minnesota', 'two', 'children', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'put', 'together', 'bits', 'pieces', 'past', 'audience', 'realize', 'woman', 'born', 'mining', 'family', 'father', 'Hank', 'Aimes', 'played', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'still', 'mines', 'angry', 'when', 'daughter', 'territory', 'so', 'speak', 'work', 'mine', 'troubled', 'youth', 'children', 'have', 'different', 'fathers', 'community', 'grew', 'up', 'not', 'forgiving', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'choices', 'spunk', 'see', 'early', 'courage', 'leave', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'father', 'approval', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'craving', 'daughters', 'surely', 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'take', 'job', 'male-dominated', 'field', 'mining.Yet', 'Josey', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'strike', 'being', 'hero', 'not', 'looking', 'fight', 'not', 'looking', 'make', 'waves', 'single', 'mother', 'trying', 'support', 'kids', 'buy', 'modest', 'house', 'put', 'food', 'table', 'town', 'few', 'jobs', 'are', 'available', 'most', 'lucrative', 'mining', 'Why', 'not', 'willing', 'work', 'hard', 'buck.But', 'Josey', 'coworkers', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'willing', 'worst', 'human', 'nature', 'soon', 'surfaces', 'Men', 'mine', 'resent', 'women', 'citing', 'few', 'jobs', 'cause', 'apparent', 'excuse', 'male', 'posturing', 'sexual', 'assault', 'One', 'how', 'male', 'would', 'behave', 'legal', 'constraints', 'rein', 'testosterone', 'Certainly', 'nightmare', 'watch', 'few', 'female', 'miners', 'are', 'constantly', 'tormented', 'Obscene', 'gestures', 'drawings', 'walls', 'are', 'least', 'troubles', 'must', 'endure', 'being', 'groped', 'grabbed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'open', 'lockers', 'lunchboxes', 'finding', 'shall', 'say', 'reminders', 'male', 'anatomy', 'functions', 'worst', 'are', 'threatened', 'rape', 'women', 'endure', 'keeping', 'brave', 'tormentors', 'staying', 'strong.There', 'different', 'kind', 'strength', 'perhaps', 'hardest', 'achieve', 'strength', 'required', 'stand', 'up', 'such', 'tormentors', 'say', 'enough', 'enough', 'draw', 'firm', 'boundaries', 'acceptable', 'behavior', 'stand', 'alone', 'screaming', 'masses', 'few', 'can', 'reach', 'kind', 'heroism', 'North', 'Country', 'how', 'community', 'overtime', 'keep', 'ugliest', 'secrets', 'secret', 'how', 'individuals', 'sink', 'deep', 'denial', 'how', 'even', 'friends', 'will', 'betray', 'friends', 'rather', 'risk', 'sticking', 'necks', 'out', 'Josey', 'submits', 'submits', 'submits', 'can', 'submit', 'more', 'watch', 'progressing', 'abuse', 'women', 'must', 'endure', 'painful', 'should', 'be', 'watch', 'how', 'abused', 'women', 'conspire', 'keep', 'torment', 'hidden', 'most', 'painful', 'too', 'society', 'today', 'various', 'guises.A', 'court', 'drama', 'thankfully', 'not', 'drawn', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'playing', 'Josey', 'somewhat', 'reluctant', 'lawyer', 'situation', 'head', 'voice', 'long', 'last', 'joins', 'Josey', 'addressing', 'harrassment', 'one', 'one', 'more', 'rise', 'join', 'chorus.If', 'not', 'perhaps', 'most', 'excellent', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'terms', 'script', 'scene', 'story', 'important', 'statement', 'enlightening', 'look', 'shame', 'genders', 'when', 'committing', 'enabling', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'community', 'quick', 'judge', 'order', 'protect', 'one', 'sheltered', 'little', 'worlds', 'saying', 'paraphrased', 'one', 'person', 'anywhere', 'must', 'endure', 'such', 'abuse', 'are', 'guilty', 'are', 'opportunities', 'day', 'speak', 'up', 'speak', 'out', 'objectification', 'human', 'beings', 'cruelties', 'one', 'group', 'North', 'Country', 'reminder', 'do', 'so', 'Every', 'voice', 'matters', 'only', 'courage', 'next', 'voice']",N/A
