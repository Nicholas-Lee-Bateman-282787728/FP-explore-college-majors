824398,A26R4PDCZX5SOK,B00024I3GC,"Amazon Customer ""The World According to JimG944""","[0, 0]","4 of 5 stars for this Hong Kong action movie. To start with, let me say that this is a dubbed into English movie. It appears to have been filmed mostly in Hong Kong with a chunk done in South Korea. When you talk about Hong Kong action movies, you first think of kung fu ""wire-work"" movies. Wrong! This movie has zero kung fu and zero wire scenes. On the other hand, Let the Bullets Fly! The photographic style of this movie is much different than Hollywood; much more ah ah Artistic and may scenes to develop the characters--often without words. You really have to watch this movie carefully to get the full value.The story is about a woman who is a paid assassin. She is extremely good at her work and is hired often to hit powerful people. Her un-doing is one hit that is successful, but, leaves people who want revenge. There is the start of a romance, but, that is really a way to more fully develop her character and history.Yes, this is a good movie and is worth watching. Be warned, and be prepared, this ain't no Hollywood movie--it is different and it is good.",4,Let the bullets fly!,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1070,"['4', '5', 'stars', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'movie', 'start', 'let', 'say', 'dubbed', 'English', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'chunk', 'done', 'South', 'Korea', 'When', 'talk', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'movies', 'first', 'think', 'kung', 'fu', 'wire-work', 'movies', 'Wrong', 'movie', 'zero', 'kung', 'fu', 'zero', 'wire', 'scenes', 'other', 'hand', 'Let', 'Bullets', 'Fly', 'photographic', 'style', 'movie', 'much', 'different', 'Hollywood', 'much', 'more', 'ah', 'ah', 'Artistic', 'may', 'scenes', 'develop', 'characters', 'often', 'words', 'really', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'carefully', 'get', 'full', 'value.The', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'paid', 'assassin', 'extremely', 'good', 'work', 'hired', 'often', 'hit', 'powerful', 'people', 'un-doing', 'one', 'hit', 'successful', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'revenge', 'start', 'romance', 'really', 'way', 'more', 'fully', 'develop', 'character', 'history.Yes', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Be', 'warned', 'be', 'prepared', 'ai', ""n't"", 'no', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'different', 'good']",Beyond Hypothermia
824399,A35K942UUIR9BY,B00024I3GC,"Bee ""Dreamer""","[0, 2]","I believe this is a Hong Kong/Korean movie but I could be wrong as I didn't properly pay attention to credits.It's a story about a female assasin who fell in love with a guy who cooked noodles for a living... sort of like La Femme Nikita with an Asian actress and without all the sheen and polish.Anyhow, what I like about this movie is that it's an okay foreign movie [we don't have to limit ourselves to crappy Hollywood, do we?] Also, the acting in the movie is good enough. The film has a dark and gloomy tone, which I like. Warning: just like many actions, this one has leaky plots and you might want to suspend your sense of disbelief while watching it.To sum it up, if you need a break from cheap Hollywood actions, go for it. It's not that great but it's not exactly a pain to watch either.",3,Only if you dare to explore,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,798,"['believe', 'Hong', 'Kong/Korean', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'properly', 'pay', 'attention', 'credits.It', 'story', 'female', 'assasin', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'guy', 'who', 'cooked', 'noodles', 'living', 'sort', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Asian', 'actress', 'sheen', 'polish.Anyhow', 'what', 'like', 'movie', 'okay', 'foreign', 'movie', '[', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'limit', 'crappy', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'Also', 'acting', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'film', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'tone', 'like', 'Warning', 'just', 'many', 'actions', 'one', 'leaky', 'plots', 'might', 'want', 'suspend', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'watching', 'it.To', 'sum', 'up', 'need', 'break', 'cheap', 'Hollywood', 'actions', 'go', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'exactly', 'pain', 'watch']",Beyond Hypothermia

The film makers took great time and dedication with the action scenes, the cut shots and the still shots.  The action scenes are fast paced and Chien-Lien does a wonderful job as a female assassin.  She is in love with a man, he is in love with her, but she is a killer.  He is naive and tells her he doesn't care about her job.  American fans will consider this similar to the Brigette Fonda movie ""Point of No Return.""  There are a lot of very violent and exciting shooting scenes in this movie and it's a very exciting Korean movie.  The film really heats up as Chien-Lien does everything she can to protect her own life from the people out to kill her.",5,Great Cinematography,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,706,"['First', 'all', 'cinematography', 'spectacular', 'film', 'makers', 'took', 'great', 'time', 'dedication', 'action', 'scenes', 'cut', 'shots', 'still', 'shots', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fast', 'paced', 'Chien-Lien', 'wonderful', 'job', 'female', 'assassin', 'love', 'man', 'love', 'killer', 'naive', ""n't"", 'care', 'job', 'American', 'fans', 'will', 'consider', 'similar', 'Brigette', 'Fonda', 'movie', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'are', 'lot', 'very', 'violent', 'exciting', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'movie', 'very', 'exciting', 'Korean', 'movie', 'film', 'really', 'up', 'Chien-Lien', 'everything', 'can', 'protect', 'own', 'life', 'people', 'out', 'kill']",Beyond Hypothermia

She's never led a normal life and is characterized by both her ice cold nerves and a perfect assassin's body that is colder than normal.And then one day she meets a guy. A regular guy who's not handsome or rich or powerful but is sweet and funny and good. And he owns a noodle shop. He loves her, wants to get her out of her deadly life and is willing to leave his home and business to be with her. He's a regular guy but when his beloved is in trouble he rises to heroism. The audience really comes to like him. This is her one big chance to live happily ever after and she decides to take it.But of course there's a problem. A bodygaurd who was hired to protect her last hit is after her. He's so implacable about doing his job that he doesn't even spare his father-in-law when it turns out the old man was the one who ordered the hit. Even the death of his wife doesn't slow this dude down. He won't stop tyring to get our heroine and he has the resources of an entire gang to back him up.The ending of this movie is extremely bloody, violent and surprisingly touching in the way that only a movie made in Korea, Japan or Hong Kong can be.

Sean Wright,"[7, 7]","Although the plot of this movie is very familiar(a lone female assassin finally starts to feeltrue emotions when she meets a ""normal"" guyand then decides that she wants to leave the business)""Beyond Hypothermia"" sets a high standard forrun-of-the-mill assassin films.  There is asuperb balance between drama and action inthis movie. The dramatic portions never comeacross as forced, poorly written melodrama.The action scenes appear to be even,fluid extensionsof the drama. The cinematography is Oscar quality,in my opinion. At every turn, there are unique littleelements that grab the eye and hold your attention like something you may seen amillion times but all of a sudden it strikes you as brand new.This movie was smartly designed and written.The ending is a pain parade, and that's puttingit lightly.

Yes, hurray for cool action sequences that are actually Solidly Realistic!!Beyond Hypothermia has a good story and an interesting main character. The character features an attractive female assassin, naturally this is appealing but the movie goes deeper than that. It is a drama as well as an action thriller.It's a very good movie and has allot of what I look for in films.It does have a very, very brief innappropriate scene(not involving the main character of the movie) which I could have done without but other than that this is a superb, touching and compelling action movie with realistic and violent action that's graphically portrayed.I won't give the movie away but this movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending. This movie, is of course, exponentially better than most of what Hollywood churns out and makes the big bucks on via dumb, tasteless people easily impressed by fancy explosions and big slamb bang action. Down with the mainsteam!Anyway, this is a superb, excellent good movie.Highly recommended!!",5,Excellent movie!!,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1101,"['superb', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'violent', 'graphic', 'REALISTIC', 'Yes', 'hurray', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'actually', 'Solidly', 'Realistic', 'Beyond', 'Hypothermia', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'main', 'character', 'character', 'attractive', 'female', 'assassin', 'naturally', 'appealing', 'movie', 'deeper', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'thriller.It', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'allot', 'what', 'look', 'films.It', 'have', 'very', 'very', 'brief', 'innappropriate', 'scene', 'not', 'involving', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'superb', 'touching', 'compelling', 'action', 'movie', 'realistic', 'violent', 'action', 'graphically', 'portrayed.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'away', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'movie', 'course', 'exponentially', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'big', 'bucks', 'dumb', 'tasteless', 'people', 'easily', 'impressed', 'fancy', 'explosions', 'big', 'slamb', 'bang', 'action', 'mainsteam', 'Anyway', 'superb', 'excellent', 'good', 'movie.Highly', 'recommended']",Beyond Hypothermia
