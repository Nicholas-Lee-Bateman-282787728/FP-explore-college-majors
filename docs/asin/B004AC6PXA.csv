1393240,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B004AC6PXA,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[29, 30]","Along withLeapFrog: Numbers Ahoy, ""The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park"" is the newest release in the LeapFrog DVD series. It features the new design first seen inLeapFrog: Let's Go to Schooland also introduces a new character, Scout, who LeapFrog fans might be familiar with if they own, or know ofLeapFrog My Pal Scout.Like most LeapFrog releases, this is done well. Scout is a fun addition to the series, though if you were expecting him to talk, forget it. He is Lily and Tad's pet dog through and through and he communicates through barking, yipping and body language. But he is a curious and also mischievous little scamp and adds a lot of entertainment value. The animation is fun to watch, the educational content is strong and the songs are generally fun and catchy.In this adventure, Tad and Lily find themselves in a bit of a jam when Scout snatches letters from around town and buries them in their yard. They want to return the letters to their owners, but they don't know which is which. Edison, the firefly, offers to take them on the Learning Path to the Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park. But a cotton candy mishap causes Edison to get stuck to a ferris wheel. The rides at the park are all powered down and Lily & Tad must learn to recognize letter shapes, both uppercase and lowercase, in order to power them back up. They also learn about rhyming.If some of this feels familiar, it is. There was already an extensive alphabet song back in ""Let's Go to School,"" so those that are watching here might rightly wonder why Tad & Lily still can't recognize letters. And while the alphabet song works well in short bits throughout the film, it really drags when they present the entire thing together at the end. Also, Tad & Lily refer to the letters throughout as ""big and small,"" but there is no reference to the proper terminology of ""uppercase and lowercase."" I know that that may be a bit much for younger children, but I think they should have used those terms at least once, just so that if the kids hear parents or educators using them, they won't be completely unfamiliar with them.Despite these somewhat minor faults, this is an excellent release and it also comes with some great bonus features. There is a preview for ""Numbers Ahoy!"" at the end of the film, though if you bought that along with this DVD, then you won't need it. Another really fun bonus feature is ""Being a Puppy (The Scout Song)."" Not just yipping or barking - this song is both about Scout and performed by him! One really welcome bonus feature (one that would have been great on past DVD releases) is a series of commentaries by Dr. Carolyn Jaynes, the educational consultant for these releases. She explains for parents and educators exactly what concepts are reinforced by the DVD, and how to best use it. Other bonus features include sing-alongs, vowel shorts and trailers. Also, the DVD is fully closed-captioned, something that is very pleasing, since the DVDs before the redesign never had captioning.",4,"Done Well, But Feels Familiar",1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,2999,"['withLeapFrog', 'Numbers', 'Ahoy', 'Amazing', 'Alphabet', 'Amusement', 'Park', 'newest', 'release', 'LeapFrog', 'DVD', 'series', 'new', 'design', 'first', 'seen', 'inLeapFrog', 'Let', 'Go', 'Schooland', 'also', 'new', 'character', 'Scout', 'who', 'LeapFrog', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'familiar', 'own', 'know', 'My', 'Pal', 'Scout.Like', 'most', 'LeapFrog', 'done', 'well', 'Scout', 'fun', 'addition', 'series', 'were', 'expecting', 'talk', 'forget', 'Lily', 'Tad', 'pet', 'dog', 'barking', 'yipping', 'body', 'language', 'curious', 'also', 'mischievous', 'little', 'scamp', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'value', 'animation', 'fun', 'watch', 'educational', 'content', 'strong', 'songs', 'are', 'generally', 'fun', 'catchy.In', 'adventure', 'Tad', 'Lily', 'find', 'bit', 'jam', 'when', 'Scout', 'letters', 'town', 'buries', 'yard', 'want', 'return', 'letters', 'owners', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Edison', 'firefly', 'take', 'Learning', 'Path', 'Amazing', 'Alphabet', 'Amusement', 'Park', 'cotton', 'candy', 'mishap', 'Edison', 'get', 'stuck', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'rides', 'park', 'are', 'powered', 'down', 'Lily', 'Tad', 'must', 'learn', 'recognize', 'letter', 'shapes', 'uppercase', 'lowercase', 'order', 'power', 'back', 'up', 'also', 'learn', 'rhyming.If', 'feels', 'familiar', 'was', 'already', 'extensive', 'alphabet', 'song', 'back', 'Let', 'Go', 'School', 'so', 'are', 'watching', 'here', 'might', 'rightly', 'wonder', 'why', 'Tad', 'Lily', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'letters', 'alphabet', 'song', 'well', 'short', 'bits', 'film', 'really', 'when', 'present', 'entire', 'thing', 'together', 'end', 'Also', 'Tad', 'Lily', 'refer', 'letters', 'big', 'small', 'reference', 'proper', 'terminology', 'uppercase', 'lowercase', 'know', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'younger', 'children', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'terms', 'least', 'once', 'just', 'so', 'kids', 'hear', 'parents', 'educators', 'using', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'them.Despite', 'somewhat', 'minor', 'faults', 'excellent', 'release', 'also', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'preview', 'Numbers', 'Ahoy', 'end', 'film', 'bought', 'DVD', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'really', 'fun', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Being', 'Puppy', 'Scout', 'Song', 'Not', 'just', 'yipping', 'barking', 'song', 'Scout', 'performed', 'One', 'really', 'welcome', 'bonus', 'feature', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'past', 'DVD', 'releases', 'series', 'commentaries', 'Dr.', 'Carolyn', 'Jaynes', 'educational', 'consultant', 'releases', 'parents', 'educators', 'exactly', 'what', 'concepts', 'are', 'reinforced', 'DVD', 'how', 'best', 'use', 'Other', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'sing-alongs', 'vowel', 'shorts', 'trailers', 'Also', 'DVD', 'fully', 'closed-captioned', 'something', 'very', 'pleasing', 'DVDs', 'redesign', 'never', 'had', 'captioning']",LeapFrog: The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park

Those were excellent, 5-star videos. With their help, all my children learned their letter names and sound before they were 2 years old. My complaints about this one and the other newer ones are as follows:1. Suddenly Tad's older sister Lilly is now his twin. Huh?2. This tad's voice is terrible.3. The previews go on and on and on and on and on. They didn't have any previews in the first Leapfrog videos I bought and these previews make it really hard to get to the main movie in the car where my daughter watches these. It is sooo annoying to me that I'm tempted to give it only one star. Really.The plus. My daughter doesn't care that Tad's voice is annoying or that Lilly's age suddenly changed. She enjoys the songs.
