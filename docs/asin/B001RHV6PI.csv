But Fr Miguel Pro continued his priestly work under various disguises until he was caught and shot by firing squad.

The fact that he did this in spite of the socialist Mexican government prohibiting any public worship, laity dressing in their attire and persecuting people of faith.  He pays the ultimate price and does it with humility and devotion.The film is decent but the production values are grade B/C.  The emotional feeling carries this movie about a humble but devoted Jesuit priest who wanted to serve God and fellow believers.",4,Miguel Pro: A soft-spoken martyr,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,502,"['knew', 'Father', 'Miguel', 'Pro', 'who', 'was', 'martyred', 'devotion', 'Catholics', 'fact', 'did', 'spite', 'socialist', 'Mexican', 'government', 'prohibiting', 'public', 'worship', 'laity', 'dressing', 'attire', 'persecuting', 'people', 'faith', 'ultimate', 'price', 'humility', 'devotion.The', 'film', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'grade', 'B/C', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'movie', 'humble', 'devoted', 'Jesuit', 'priest', 'who', 'wanted', 'serve', 'God', 'fellow', 'believers']",Padre Pro
1233333,AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B001RHV6PI,Mark Anderson,"[0, 1]","This is a very interesting true story of Padre Pro, a Jesuit priest who was executed - for celebrating Mass and conducting other religious duties required of a Catholic priest - by the Mexican government during the 1926-29 Christero period. During that period the Mexican government outlawed the Catholic Church and the Church went underground, conducting its mission in secret. Padre Pro was later beatified by Pope John Paul II.The drawback in this particular production is that the production is not great quality. It's in Spanish with English subtitles that are poorly translated in places. The script/screenplay is not particularly well written, the actors appear to be amateurs, props and sets are low budget and the camera work and editing are acceptable but not particularly high quality.I really want to rate this higher than three stars since Padre Pro's story is one that really deserves to be told. But it deserves to be told in a higher quality production than this is. I hate to say it, but this production is only worth three stars.If you want a very good, well produced movie about the Christero uprising in Mexico, check out &#34;For Greater Glory&#34; with Andy Garcia.",3,"A Very Worthwhile True Story, But This Production Is Very Low Budget - And It Shows",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1187,"['very', 'interesting', 'true', 'story', 'Padre', 'Pro', 'Jesuit', 'priest', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'celebrating', 'Mass', 'conducting', 'other', 'religious', 'duties', 'required', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Mexican', 'government', '1926-29', 'Christero', 'period', 'period', 'Mexican', 'government', 'outlawed', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Church', 'went', 'underground', 'conducting', 'mission', 'secret', 'Padre', 'Pro', 'was', 'later', 'beatified', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II.The', 'drawback', 'particular', 'production', 'production', 'not', 'great', 'quality', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'poorly', 'translated', 'places', 'script/screenplay', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'written', 'actors', 'appear', 'be', 'amateurs', 'props', 'sets', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'are', 'acceptable', 'not', 'particularly', 'high', 'quality.I', 'really', 'want', 'rate', 'higher', 'three', 'stars', 'Padre', 'Pro', 'story', 'one', 'really', 'be', 'told', 'be', 'told', 'higher', 'quality', 'production', 'hate', 'say', 'production', 'only', 'worth', 'three', 'stars.If', 'want', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'produced', 'movie', 'Christero', 'uprising', 'Mexico', 'check', 'out', '34', 'Greater', 'Glory', '34', 'Andy', 'Garcia']",Padre Pro

1233335,A3DU4UO1O84LW8,B001RHV6PI,Ricardo,"[4, 5]","This production about Padre Miguel Pro was fascinating and very colorfull. It kept my interest until the very end even though the final scene is shown at both the beginning and the ending of the film. The movie concentrated on the life of  Padre Pro from when he begins his religous training until his death in Mexico City. In between we are treated to beautiful scenes of both Mexico and Europe where he must go to continue his religous training after the socialist government of Mexico begins its suppression of the Catholic Church.  Anyone who mistakenly believes that socialism is kind and benovelent is unaware of the attempts by the Mexican government to destroy the Catholic Church in Mexico. This sad part of history is not taught in the US, even though it is of great interest to a growing hispanic population and of course to the very large Catholic community. While the movie does not get into the reasons for the government crackdown, other than the conflict over Church decrees; it does show the extreme violence that was carried out against the church. This is a good family film, that is to say it is not overly violent and as I said before it concentrates on the good works of Padre Pro.",4,A Historical Movie About A Modern Martyr,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,1203,"['production', 'Padre', 'Miguel', 'Pro', 'was', 'fascinating', 'very', 'colorfull', 'kept', 'interest', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'final', 'scene', 'shown', 'beginning', 'ending', 'film', 'movie', 'concentrated', 'life', 'Padre', 'Pro', 'when', 'religous', 'training', 'death', 'Mexico', 'City', 'are', 'treated', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Mexico', 'Europe', 'where', 'must', 'go', 'continue', 'religous', 'training', 'socialist', 'government', 'Mexico', 'suppression', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Anyone', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'socialism', 'kind', 'benovelent', 'unaware', 'attempts', 'Mexican', 'government', 'destroy', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Mexico', 'sad', 'part', 'history', 'not', 'taught', 'US', 'even', 'great', 'interest', 'growing', 'hispanic', 'population', 'course', 'very', 'large', 'Catholic', 'community', 'movie', 'not', 'get', 'reasons', 'government', 'crackdown', 'other', 'conflict', 'Church', 'decrees', 'show', 'extreme', 'violence', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'church', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'say', 'not', 'overly', 'violent', 'said', 'good', 'works', 'Padre', 'Pro']",Padre Pro
