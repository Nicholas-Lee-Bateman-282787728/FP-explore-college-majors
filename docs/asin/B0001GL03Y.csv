804417,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0001GL03Y,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","PETER, PAUL & MARY - CARRY IT ON is a documentary often seen during PBS fundraisers that has a dual agenda. For the several participants, it's an opportunity to reaffirm the social activism of the 1960s (and beyond) that motivated them then and still does today. For PBS, this career overview of the musical trio includes in great part video highlights of their long association with that network. Thus the show's main flaw for older fans like me.Glimpses of the group's first era (1962-70) are few, all too brief and are finished within 20 minutes. These moments include for example clips from the 1963 March on Washington, PPM at two different Newport Folk Festivals, and perfomances on the Jonathan Winters and Andy Williams shows.Mary Travers offers an insight into this trio of very different personalities. Peter Yarrow, she says, is highly disciplined, Noel Paul Stookey disciplined but with a soft edge and she, Mary, was: ""Don't bother me,"" the original rebel. With this perspective, we notice in a mid-60s TV appearance that in doing a song Mary was prone to turning the back of her shoulder to Peter and singing directly to Paul. This may subcosciously indicate that both of them felt Yarrow was too much the taskmaster.Peter reveals that Noel was often declaring he wanted to leave the group, which is explained by Stookey as making a right-hand turn in order to be with family after a seven year grind of 200 show dates and recording sessions. You certainly can't blame him. It was ""time off for good behavior.""In 1978, Yarrow got them all back together again for an anti-nukes concert he was organizing. This reteaming ""stuck"" and they remained a trio until Miss Travers died in 2009.The lion's share of ""Carry It On"" is segments from several PPM TV specials, but we also see their activities in El Salvador during some of the darkest days of that Central American country's history.Other participants in this 2004 program (produced in part by Peter) are Ronnie Gilbert and Pete Seeger (of the Weavers), Tom Paxton, Richie Havens, manager Albert Grossman and recording producer Phil Ramone. There's archive footage of several more folk artists as they appeared on PPM's PBS shows.This program is recommended, particularly if you are interested in the later public TV years of Peter, Paul & Mary. There's lots of good music here (if fragmented) and an occasional insight.",4,"Yarrow, Stookey & Travers",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2384,"['PETER', 'PAUL', 'MARY', 'CARRY', 'IT', 'ON', 'documentary', 'often', 'seen', 'PBS', 'fundraisers', 'dual', 'agenda', 'several', 'participants', 'opportunity', 'reaffirm', 'social', 'activism', '1960s', 'motivated', 'then', 'still', 'today', 'PBS', 'career', 'overview', 'musical', 'trio', 'great', 'part', 'video', 'highlights', 'long', 'association', 'network', 'Thus', 'show', 'main', 'flaw', 'older', 'fans', 'me.Glimpses', 'group', 'first', 'era', '1962-70', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'brief', 'are', 'finished', '20', 'minutes', 'moments', 'include', 'example', 'clips', '1963', 'March', 'Washington', 'PPM', 'two', 'different', 'Newport', 'Folk', 'Festivals', 'perfomances', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'shows.Mary', 'Travers', 'insight', 'trio', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'Peter', 'Yarrow', 'highly', 'disciplined', 'Noel', 'Paul', 'Stookey', 'disciplined', 'soft', 'edge', 'Mary', 'was', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'original', 'rebel', 'perspective', 'notice', 'mid-60s', 'TV', 'appearance', 'doing', 'song', 'Mary', 'was', 'prone', 'turning', 'back', 'shoulder', 'Peter', 'singing', 'directly', 'Paul', 'may', 'subcosciously', 'indicate', 'felt', 'Yarrow', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'taskmaster.Peter', 'reveals', 'Noel', 'was', 'often', 'declaring', 'wanted', 'leave', 'group', 'explained', 'Stookey', 'making', 'right-hand', 'turn', 'order', 'be', 'family', 'seven', 'year', 'grind', '200', 'show', 'dates', 'recording', 'sessions', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'was', 'time', 'good', 'behavior', '1978', 'Yarrow', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'anti-nukes', 'concert', 'was', 'organizing', 'reteaming', 'stuck', 'remained', 'trio', 'Miss', 'Travers', 'died', '2009.The', 'lion', 'share', 'Carry', 'segments', 'several', 'PPM', 'TV', 'specials', 'also', 'see', 'activities', 'El', 'Salvador', 'darkest', 'days', 'Central', 'American', 'country', 'history.Other', 'participants', '2004', 'program', 'produced', 'part', 'Peter', 'are', 'Ronnie', 'Gilbert', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Weavers', 'Tom', 'Paxton', 'Richie', 'Havens', 'manager', 'Albert', 'Grossman', 'recording', 'producer', 'Phil', 'Ramone', 'archive', 'footage', 'several', 'more', 'folk', 'artists', 'appeared', 'PPM', 'PBS', 'shows.This', 'program', 'recommended', 'particularly', 'are', 'interested', 'later', 'public', 'TV', 'years', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'lots', 'good', 'music', 'here', 'fragmented', 'occasional', 'insight']","Peter, Paul and Mary - Carry It On - A Musical Legacy"
804418,A374N81UOW0ARP,B0001GL03Y,Barb Bordner,"[9, 9]","for ANY PETER,PAUL& MARY fan!!! There are lots of clips from their earlier years 1961-1970, and clips from 1978-2004.....keep in mind..I'm sure you know by now that Mary Travers left this world in 2009,and so there are no clips that go all the way upto now, if you want that you will have to wait until Noel, and Peter come out with something.They are still singing together afterall. Um....THIS documentary here includes a 2003/4 rendition of their very first song ever sung together as a trio....Mary had A Little Lamb in 1961. I wish however, that there was actual footage of them singing that song  THEN, and lots more clips from their early years as that is when they were such a smash success. When I see clips from their shows, like at the March On Washoington 1963, and 1969,and on Jonathan Winters in 1969 and I see the floweredress Mary's wearing, I'm reminded of the flower children, I wasn't born until 1967, so that was a generation or two before my time!!But if you take an interest in the Sixties, and politics, social, political activism, oh yeah and folk music too, this is a great beginners start. It's also good if you're older and want to take a stroll down memory lane.But PP&M; were always a current folk group, who didn't want to be labeled as a ""nostalgia act,"" in the early 2000's  they came out with a tear-jerker called ""Jesus Is On The Wire,""  which I'm surmising is not only about homosexuals and the need to respect their rights to live their lives the same as do straight people,I also think the title is suggestive of the horrendous murder of Mathew Shepherd was beaten to a bloody pulp, hung on a barbed wire fence, and left to die...when asked why they did that to him , they said it was because he was gay. I think it's  wonderful that PP&M;, straight as they are, rose to the occasion in this very sad but important song.Last but not least, I enjoy clip from Peter Paul& Mommy Too, a heart warming footage of Mary with her grand daughter, Wyllie on her lap looking up at her, in the rocking chair quietly, and proud as ever listening while proud Grandma Mary Travers sang  For Baby For Bobby. Just for her. The light just sparkles in Wyllie's brown eyes...you can tell she is in absolute heaven!! She adores her grandma!!And Noel is his wacky old self on The Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly.He gets all the kids excited, and laughing histerically as always.Anyhow, I hope you consider this product,I've been a serious PP&M; fan since 1984 and so I ought to know a good PP&M; documentary when I see one.....THIS HAS OODLES AND OODLES OF COMMENTARY BY MANY PEOPLE including  Pete Seeger, Phil Ramone,Tom Paxton, Ronnie Gilbert (of The Weavers.) Bob DeCormier (their director), as well as by PP&M; THEMSELVES.And that makes this very good indeed.

This DVD will bring back a lot of memories for a lot of people. I was born in the 1980's generation but have learned a lot about them from watching this DVD so many times.I am hoping that now Warner Brothers and Rhino records will release the 4 original PBS specials onto DVD. The 25th Aniversery concert in 1986 covers all of there greatest hits Puff The Magic Dragon, Blowin In The Wind, If I Had A Hammer, Where Have All The FLowers Gone, This Land Is Your Land Like The First Time, Greenwood, Light One Candle and other songs. The music will always be remembered now that PP&M are DONE!! Marys life is celebrated through watching this DVD. A bid farwell to PP&M performing and to Mary as well. MARY ALLEN TRAVERS 1936-2009 .

More focus is given to their treasonous acts against the United States, than to the music that they did so well together.  For me, this DVD is way too wordy.

Ever since the start of human civilization, from India, China  or Greece to the Plain Chant of the Middle Ages, popular music has stood up as a transparent reflection of our most sacred longings and aspirations as human beings. Our hopes, our despair, the way we love, our desire for true human understandig, the transcendent living within us...all that has been expressed through the poetical and the musical aspects of folk art.  Well...this is it! The peace movement of the 60's, Luther King, the strong criticism to US atrocities in El Salvador during the Reagan administration, the voice of freedom, the call to respect, and not to hate, the &quot;different&quot;, the honest carrer of three talented folk singers who still captivate millions for a clear and simple reason: they still have something to say; they're still willing to say it aloud and they choose beautiful vocal harmonies and a magnificent musical climate to say it!  Anyone wondering why these times are not producing honesty ant talent like this? THE ANSWER, MY FRIEND....Please watch this DVD carefully.
