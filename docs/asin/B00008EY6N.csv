740976,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B00008EY6N,"B-MAN ""B""","[169, 171]","Who can forget that classic bass line intro! Barney Miller is finally on DVD in a two DVD set featuring the first 13 episodes of season 1 totally uncut and commercial free for the first time!  Barney Miller ran from Jan. 1975 to May 1982 (8 seasons, 170 episodes).  The sitcom was a new concept, concerning a group of Police Detectives and their Captain and the goings-on in a NY precinct squadroom.  The cast, which would make slight changes over the years, had to be one of the most diverse in TV history.  In season one, the cast includes Barney (Hal Linden), Wojciehowicz (Max Gail), Harris (Ron Glass), Fish (Abe Vigoda), Yemana (Jack Soo) and Chano (Gregory Sierra).  Season 1 is also the only time Barney's whole family were shown.  In Season 2, only his wife Elizabeth (Barbara Barrie) had appearances and by Season 3, even she was written out of the show.  Barney Miller is a rare sitcom from the 70s that is essential and makes a welcome addition to other classics like All in the family, Sanford &amp; Son, and the Jeffersons.  Season one includes these episodes:Disc One:01. Ramon02. The experience03. Snow job04. Graft05. Courtesans06. Stakeout07. The Bureaucrat08. Ms. Cop09. The vigilanteDisc Two:10. The guest11. Escape artist12. Hair13. HeroTrivia:*The characters of Barney, Wojo, &amp; Harris would be the only detectives to remain throughout the entire series as regular cast members.  Fish left after 3 seasons, Chano after 2, and Yemana after 4 (Jack Soo passed away in January 1979).  In season 3, Detrich (Steve Landesberg) &amp; Levitt (Ron Carey) would join the cast as regulars until the series ended.*Look for Linda Lavin (TV's Alice) in episode 8 debuting as Det. Janice Wentworth.  She would make appearances in the second season as well.*Before Barney Miller, Gregory Sierra (Chano) was popular for his role as Fred and Lamont's neighbor, Julio, who had a pet goat named Chico, on Sanford &amp; Son.  He made appearances on everything from All in the Family (where he had no accent) to Miami Vice.  After Barney Miller, Sierra joined the cast of Soap.*One of the main series writers, Reinhold Weege, previously wrote on M*A*S*H* and went on to create one of the funniest sitcoms ever, Night Court!

740981,AQSNJ8HQ3WHMS,B00008EY6N,cyclista,"[28, 28]","Wow!  Barney Miller had a lot of talented actors.  Abe Vigoda as &quot;Fish&quot; is one of our favorites.  We thought that Gregory Sierra was great as Julio on &quot;Sanford &amp; Son&quot;, and we enjoyed him just as much on &quot;Barney Miller&quot;.  The multicultural crew was a tremendous mix of people and personalities. We thought &quot;Barney Miller&quot; was one of the funniest shows on TV.  This wasn't one of the seasons that won an Emmy, but a good season anyway.  As others have noted, the video quality is not the best.  The audio is acceptable with the dialogue being understandable in most places.  I don't mind the lack of extras.  I'd rather have no extras than something thrown  together at the last minute.  It would have been great to have the pilot, &quot;The Life and Times of Barney Miller&quot;.  The price seems a bit high for only 13 episodes.  (&quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; has 36 episodes and the pilot episode for only a few dollars more!)  We loved the comedy on this show.Here is an episode guide, with a tiny description:1. Ramon:  A junkie holds the precinct hostage.2. Experience:  Detective Fish thinks about retiring.  A bomb is left at the precinct.3. Snow  Job:  Wojo has been entrusted with cash from a department store during a blizzard.4. Graft:  An inspector arrives to investigate possible corruption at the precinct.5. The Courtesans:  When Wojo tries to reform a hooker, she threatens to file harrassment charges.6. Stakeout:  A stakeout operation is threatened by some nosy neighbors.7. Bureaucrat: A drunken bureaucrat is jailed.8. Ms. Cop:  Linda Lavin's first episode as a &quot;by-the-book&quot; cop.9. Vigilante:  An elderly man defends his neighborhood.  An inspector insists that the 12th precinct should be hated by the citizenry.10. The Guest:  Wojo eats a poisoned sandwiched intended for a mob prisoner.  Chano sets up a drug buy with his coworkers' money.11. Escape Artist :  The 12th precinct holds an escaped prisoner.  Harris starts writing a police novel.12. Hair:  A long-haired scruffy type from Narcotics is transferred to the precinct.  Fish's afternoon at a massage parlor upsets his wife, Bernice.13.

740984,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B00008EY6N,David Girod,"[8, 8]","""Barney Miller"" is one of the best written shows of all time. The characters all mesh, and their reactions to the various criminals that pass through the cell door are priceless. Though this first season is hampered with a bit of Barney's home life, and the awful scenes of Barney's wife played by the perpetually unfunny Barbara Barrie, it's still a great dvd set. Abe Vigoda's facial expressions and dry one-liners are a riot, and you will find yourself rewinding scenes to catch what you missed while laughing. Jack Soo is terrific. He gets some of the biggest laughs on the show with just simple lines or looks, not since Jack Benny has someone been able to do so much while doing so little. Another great thing about ""Barney Miller"" is that you really develop an emotional attachment to these characters, so when something happens to them, Wojo getting poisoned, or Chano having to deal with shooting two bank robbers, you genuinely care for them. Nothing was ever forced on this show, and if you aren't familiar with it, pick up this set, give it one or two shows until you really get familiar with the characters and you will find yourself going back and re-watching favorite episodes, or thinking about something that happens on a show and chuckling throughout the day.

740987,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00008EY6N,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[10, 11]","For anyone who isn't familiar with Barney Miller, I reccomend you purchase your very own copy of the first season of this brilliant show, and acquainte yourself with its wit, intelligence and authenticity.  My only qualm is that this is the only season that has been released on DVD (they really need to transfer the rest of the seasons).  What sets Barney Miller apart from other sit coms/dramas I have seen on television, is its distinctive and intelligent approach to humor.  The characters are not only believeable and very down to earth, but really potentially loaded topics are handled in a very sensitive and insightful way.  You walk away feeling not only entertained, but more intelligent.  This is a timeless quality to the series that makes it just funny, now, as it was thirty years ago.Captain Barney Miller (Hal Linden), head of the 12th Precinct in New York City, works and interacts with a range of characters (in and outside his office).  These characters include the hilarious and swarthy Sargaent Amenguale, crusty Det. Phil Fish (Abe Vigoda), child-like Det. Stanley ""Wojo"" Wojciehowicz (Max Gail), insightful Det. Nick Yemana (Jack Soo), poetic and outspoken Det. Ron Harris (Ron Glass) and lone female Det. Janice Wentworth (Lina Lavin).  Together, they make quite a team, abundant with classic one liners and insightful observations about the world.Episodes run the gamet of just about every scenario you can imagine (everything from prostitution to mental illness to drug addiction).

That said, this is still one of the best sitcoms ever. It's also one of the most underrated. In all its years on the air I doubt it ever recieved an Emmy, a few nominations here and there but never the big prizes in writing, acting or series categories. All of the members of ""the 'ol 1-2"" were certainly worthy of consideration. This first season introduces the primary characters of Capt. Miller, Dets. Fish, Yemana & Wojohowicz. Steve Landesberg's character of Detective Detrich came into the series later. It's hard to believe the same actor who complained about his ailments to his wife Bernice here would also be part of film immortality with the phrase ""Luca Abrazi sleeps with the fishes"". The writers here were probably still finding their way around the characters so we get the scenes between Barney and his wife Liz (which I think were a distraction and were phased out around the end of season 1). So what remains are the elements of a future classic. I really wish Sony would get the remaining seasons out, can't wait to see the famous ""brownie episode"" again as well as the case of Angelo Molinari a.k.a ""The Mole.

Starting as a mid-season replacement in January 1975 (hence the 13 episode first season), the show slowly built from a less subtle comedy with a heavy dose of domestic sitcom  and some rather crudely drawn characters into a subtle, intelligent program with ongoing story arcs (Wojo's struggle to pass the Sergeant's exam, Barney's marital and promotion woes, Harris's rise and fall as an author) that were only completed at show's end.Of course, most great shows have a great cast who truly seem to enjoy working together.  Barney M is no exception.  Hal Linden was great as the moral and logistical center of the show, a true father figure and solid straight man.  Mas Gail as Wojo was sort of the naive conscience of the show, thinking nothing of bringing the Pentagon in to the 12th Precinct to face a battery of questions on Agent Orange.  Ron Glass, as the supremely ambitious, tremendously literate Harris was a rare representation of an African-American male that didn't focus exclusively on his race (but didn't ignore it completely either, as witnessed by the Emmy-winning episode &quot;The Harris Incident&quot;).  Jack Soo as the bizarrely deadpan Yemana, Ron Carey as the resentful/insecure/yet surprisingly resourceful Leavitt was a revelation as the show wore on.  Steve Landesberg's Dietrich was a good counterpoint to some of the flashiness of Harris or emotionality of Wojo, with his drier than dry wit.This may be a controversial observation, but I felt the show improved with the departure of Abe Vigoda's Detective Fish, whose emphasis on schtick took away from the show's more subtle comedy.  I've read that Vigoda even requested that the show be renamed &quot;Fish and Barney Miller.&quot;  Can you imagine?The one criticism I might have of the show is that the show was not as generous with its female characters as it came to be with its male characters.  My wife loves Barney Miller, but often finds the show's tendencies toward &quot;ladies of the night with hearts of gold&quot; a little grating.Still this show's portrayal of the dynamics of the workplace and how several diverse men work things out together with respect, care and openness while being constantly funny is a great accomplishment.  Throw in that the show is sort of a record of key issues and trends of the seventies (mindless bureaucracy, bankrupt cities and their budget cuts, sperm banks, environmental issues, Native Americans, Viet Nam vets, oddball cults, etc., etc.), and this is a show that shouldn't be missed.  It's a show that can make  you laugh and once in a while make you cry.  And it always made me think.  Can't ask for more than this.The first season was a good start.  There are 170 episodes total.  Can't wait for the next 157!",5,Can't ask for more than this.

Not to mention the fact that the picture quality is better than on TV.As you may know, Barney Miller is a great sitcom. The actors are so natural in their roles, right from the start. The writing is clever, very human and thoroughly funny. It's testament to the great writing that a show that takes place essentailly in one room can be engaging week after week. The ethnically diverse cast was also pretty radical for the time. No wonder this show is considered a classic. My sugggestion is shell out the $25 or so and buy it. There is so much great humor (and humanity) in the first season alone that it's worth the price, and the later seasons just kept getting better.My one compaint about the DVD is that I noticed the first episode is only about 23 minutes. I'm assuming this episode is edited, because the other episodes I've watched so far run 25 minutes. Or maybe it originally ran this way?I am really enjoying the DVD, and I'm Glad Columbia/TriStar did the right thing by releasing a well-produced season set of this landmark show.

Set in the 12th precinct of the New York City police department,the episodes find the precinct's officers(Hal Linden's character of Captain Barney Miller,Abe Vigoda's character of Detective Phil Fish,Gregory Sierra's character of Detective Chano Amenguale,Max Gail's character of Detective Stan 'Wojo' Wojchiehowitz,and even though they weren't ""official cast members"" at the time,Ron Glass' and Jack Soo's characters of Detective Ron Harris and Detective Sergeant Nick Yemana)caught up in their own work and the chaos of their own personal lives(most notably Miller and Fish--that's when the humor really hits hard!). The remarkable thing about ""Barney Miller"" is how it never runs low on humor and how the show's actors execute the humor to the fullest--with a good serious edge also. The ""drama"" in some of the episodes of ""Barney Miller"" take on an appropriate amount of dominance with richly executed talent. It makes the episodes of ""Barney Miller"" that are to be found here very remarkable and worthwhile--keeping the entertainment coming.As for the packaging of the first season of ""Barney Miller"",things here are in good hand. As already mentioned,all thirteen episodes are digitally remastered. On top of that,you get TV-ographies of the cast of the first season of ""Barney Miller""(with the exceptions of Barbara Barrie and Gregory Sierra),the theatrical trailer for ""Anger Management""(yes,the 2003 Adam Sandler/Jack Nicholson flick,even if this DVD was released a year after the release of ""Anger Management""),television trailers(one trailer for most old television shows from the era that ""Barney Miller"" was on that are now on DVD,the other trailer for both shows from that era and ""recent"" shows such as ""Mad About You"" and ""King of Queens"",both the shows and the DVDS of them getting equal representation),as well as two booklets(one with info on the episodes that are to be found on this DVD,and one that advertises the DVDS that the first disc of this set advertise). I find it dissapointing that the special feautures give no representation of ""Barney Miller"" and no recognition to either Barbara Barrie or Gregory Sierra(the same actor who played Julio Fuentes on ""Sanford and Son"" and Lt. Lou Rodriguez on ""Miami Vice"",I might add). However,with the special feautures having a memorable gem(who could ever forget ""Anger Management""??!!)and offering a good look at television(70's plus)in a nutshell,I can't complain too bad.Overall,a good way for ""Barney Miller"" fans to enjoy the first season.

Count yourself lucky if you don't.) but it does seem that the 70s were the golden age of the TV sitcom, with such ground-breakers as ""All In The Family,"" ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Mary Tyler Moore"" leading the way.  Those fine shows always got their due in terms of critical applause, but nestled among them was a quiet little gem of wit and insight that to my mind was never fully appreciated, then or now.That show is ""Barney Miller,"" and finally, at long last, it comes to DVD.  That alone is reason to rejoice.  The show has been pretty much gone from syndication for years, for some odd reason.  The Internet Movie Data Base has almost nothing on it.  Virtually the only evidence it ever existed is Barney's badge, which is on display in the Smithsonian Institution.The first season is a bit different than the rest of the series, however.  The writers and producers were still finding their voices, or rather the show's voice.  Things are a bit more ""hysterical,"" and the droll wit that later became the show's signature is present here only in small amounts.  (Tellingly, those jokes get the biggest laughs.)  The first season sought to balance Barney's home life with his work, but gradually the home, including the wife and kids, were phased out.  (""Just Shoot Me"" followed the same trajectory, albeit much more quickly.  With ""JSM,"" however, I liked it the original way.)  Even in the pilot episode, the home sequences are stagy, slow and a one-joke affair.  (Wife wants hubby to quit the force; hubby loves his job too much.)  The show only displays its true potential when we're in the stationhouse.  And Ron Glass, not a permanent member in the first year, is not present in all the episodes.  In the second show there is another black detective, named Wilson, who is frankly not very good or funny.  They were right to go with Glass permanently, though his Harris is not yet quite the flashy, irreverent wiseguy he later became.Much as I'd like to give this set five stars, the truth is the packaging is somewhat shoddy.  Picture and sound are decent (image is a little flat), but they could have given us some extras (real extras).  A brief interview with the cast members today, most of whom are still alive, would have been nice, or maybe some commentaries from cast members about their favorite episodes.  Even commentary in a booklet would have been welcome.  As it is, I get the impression Sony just slammed this together as quickly as possible.I hope it makes money for them, however, so that they release the rest of the seasons.

741037,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00008EY6N,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[12, 12]","It's disheartening to realize that what is arguably the greatest sitcom ever (there has surely never been a _better_ one) -- would almost certainly not have made it in today's market.The first four episodes aren't very good. The Flicker/Arnold wit is present, but the overall tone is loud and raucous (as is the laugh track). Hal Linden - a broad and unsubtle actor - is given too many comic lines, which are not only inappropriate for a police captain, but which he handles poorly. The ""goofy criminal"" format is in place, but the plotting too often falls back on sitcom clich&eacute;s. Wojo is stupid, obnoxious, and mean-spirited. And the impeccable comic timing the series was justly famous for is missing.There's a good chance that, if these episodes were aired today, &quot;Barney Miller&quot; would not have time to &quot;find itself&quot; or build an audience, and ABC would kill it after a half-dozen episodes. We would never have had &quot;Mooshi-mooshi!&quot; or &quot;Too many carbohydrates?&quot; or &quot;Oh, my God! I ate my eraser!&quot; (Not really. On a 36&quot; screen, you can see it's still there.)Episode 5 marks the turning point. The arch, over-the-top tone is gone. There is no ""plot"" leading up to any sort of ""payoff."" Barney is more of a straight man reacting to the craziness going on around him, and his wife is on her way out. The laugh track is subdued; it sounds as if it's coming from a live audience watching the performance. Wojo is morphing into a complex, sympathetic character -- and we start to see what an exceptionally fine actor Max Gail is. (God, what cute little ears!) Most significantly, the show is not afraid to have a serious moment - in this episode, Wojo's fixation on reforming prostitutes, which would become a running story element. ""Barney Miller"" is _finally_ ""Barney Miller"" -- one of the finest examples of impossibly clever writing and inspired ensemble acting ever to grace American TV.The improvement is so substantial that the last episode of the first season is one of the greatest sitcom episodes of all time. It handles a serious subject -- how does a policeman react to having to kill a criminal? -- and reduces the audience to tears.One of the high-water marks in the history of television. Unhesitatingly and unreservedly recommended.A note about picture quality... The image is slightly soft and occasionally smeary. ABC's cameras are badly adjusted, with severe misconvergence and poor inter-camera matching. There is noticeable improvement at episode 8, but the image is still (no surprise) not up current standards. My gut feeling is that ""Barney Miller"" always suffered from a lack of sharpness and detail, and whatever problems exist with this transfer were present in the original tapes. But my memory isn't perfect -- and 30 years ago I was watching on a Sony KV-1920, which, though one of the best color TVs of its day, was not appropriate for critical monitoring.PS: My local Best Buy ordered exactly _one_ copy of Season 1, and it sat there for over a week until I bought it.
