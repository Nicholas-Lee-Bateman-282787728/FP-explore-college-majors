1264522,A3DPLCA4J87O55,B002DYKPGK,bigmacdlux,"[1, 1]","I've always rather enjoyed Wes Craven's movies, and the Scream Trilogy is no exception.The first Scream is just a good-natured stab at the entire horror genre and those who are fans of it. It's something new, fresh, and greatly entertaining. There are enough twists to make you not know what's going on, but not enough to completely convolute the story. All in all, definitely a classic horror satire.Number Two follows the first one nicely. The characters are dealing with the experience's in their own ways, and the movie expands upon the story well. It doesn't break much new ground, but it does enough to keep you entertained and involved right up to the end. I'd say that, in some ways, this movie surpasses the first even.The Third and, until recently, Final, film is where the series starts to lose itself. Whereas the first two were clever satires of horror films and the culture based around them, this just seems to be a simple slasher. All of the characters we loved are back, although strangely little has changed for them since there second encounter with death. As a straight horror, it stands well. However, if you watch it expecting the same level of humor and suspense as the first two, you will be somewhat disappointed. While the movie is in no way bad, it does hold this Trilogy back from a 5 star product, for me at least.Overall, enjoyable films and definitely a product worth getting.",4,Let me hear you Scream!,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1407,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'movies', 'Scream', 'Trilogy', 'exception.The', 'first', 'Scream', 'just', 'good-natured', 'stab', 'entire', 'horror', 'genre', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'greatly', 'entertaining', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'make', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'enough', 'completely', 'convolute', 'story', 'definitely', 'classic', 'horror', 'satire.Number', 'Two', 'first', 'one', 'nicely', 'characters', 'are', 'dealing', 'experience', 'own', 'ways', 'movie', 'story', 'well', ""n't"", 'break', 'much', 'new', 'ground', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained', 'involved', 'right', 'end', ""'d"", 'say', 'ways', 'movie', 'first', 'even.The', 'Third', 'recently', 'Final', 'film', 'where', 'series', 'lose', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'clever', 'satires', 'horror', 'films', 'culture', 'based', 'just', 'be', 'simple', 'slasher', 'characters', 'loved', 'are', 'back', 'strangely', 'little', 'changed', 'second', 'encounter', 'death', 'straight', 'horror', 'well', 'However', 'watch', 'expecting', 'same', 'level', 'humor', 'suspense', 'first', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'way', 'bad', 'hold', 'Trilogy', 'back', '5', 'star', 'product', 'least.Overall', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'definitely', 'product', 'worth', 'getting']",Scream Triple Pack: (Scream / Scream 2 / Scream 3)

It discussed the rules and conventions of a horror movie which fans are familiar with and that's a reason why I think it's so successfull. This is one of my all time favourite horror flicks.

1264545,A376GITYM7MQ6J,B002DYKPGK,Thiago Sardenberg,"[1, 1]","It's a well known fact that Scream was single-handedly responsible for a major revival of the horror genre in the 90's, inspiring countless inferior productions and entering pop culture. Nearly 15 years after its release, and with a third sequel scheduled to start production in the next couple of months, I feel inclined to renew my vows as a ultimate Scream fan, even if I feel a bit scared of this new sequel.Truth is, Scream might just be one of my favorite movies ever. I remember being totally shocked when I first saw it, and I could barely sleep that night. That ghostface mask both haunted and fascinated me. I was barely a teenager, and I was amazed that a movie could get to you like that.It was a scary movie - simple as that - and it had memorable characters who you cared for. The story was interesting, original, and yet, simple. Straight to the point. Soundtrack was great. Acting was fabulous. I think I really started paying attention to technical aspects of filmmaking as I watched Scream and Scream 2 over and over, and listened to the filmmakers talking about it. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that my love for movies in general exploded with the Scream films.And to this day, it holds up well. From the classic opening scene with Barrymore to the (then-)surprising end, we hold our breaths.I'm glad I can still say ""Scream is great"" and not be ashamed to have a horror movie positioned amongst many dramas in my TOP-10 favorite movies list!!P.S. I AM Looking forward to Scream 4.... hoping for the best! It will be, at the very least, interesting to get to see where Sidney, Dewey and Gale are in their lives, what they have done!!This ""Scream pack"" is one you can not miss, the movies are at a great price!",5,Modern classics,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,1731,"['well', 'known', 'fact', 'Scream', 'was', 'single-handedly', 'responsible', 'major', 'revival', 'horror', 'genre', '90', 'inspiring', 'countless', 'inferior', 'productions', 'entering', 'pop', 'culture', 'Nearly', '15', 'years', 'release', 'third', 'sequel', 'scheduled', 'start', 'production', 'next', 'couple', 'months', 'feel', 'inclined', 'renew', 'vows', 'ultimate', 'Scream', 'fan', 'even', 'feel', 'bit', 'scared', 'new', 'sequel.Truth', 'Scream', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'remember', 'being', 'totally', 'shocked', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'could', 'barely', 'sleep', 'night', 'ghostface', 'mask', 'haunted', 'fascinated', 'was', 'barely', 'teenager', 'was', 'amazed', 'movie', 'could', 'get', 'that.It', 'was', 'scary', 'movie', 'simple', 'had', 'memorable', 'characters', 'who', 'cared', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'original', 'yet', 'simple', 'Straight', 'point', 'Soundtrack', 'was', 'great', 'Acting', 'was', 'fabulous', 'think', 'really', 'started', 'paying', 'attention', 'technical', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'watched', 'Scream', 'Scream', '2', 'listened', 'filmmakers', 'talking', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'stretch', 'say', 'love', 'movies', 'general', 'exploded', 'Scream', 'films.And', 'day', 'up', 'well', 'classic', 'opening', 'scene', 'Barrymore', 'then-', 'surprising', 'end', 'hold', 'breaths.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'can', 'still', 'say', 'Scream', 'great', 'not', 'be', 'ashamed', 'have', 'horror', 'movie', 'positioned', 'amongst', 'many', 'dramas', 'TOP-10', 'favorite', 'movies', 'list', 'P.S', 'AM', 'Looking', 'forward', 'Scream', '4', 'hoping', 'best', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'least', 'interesting', 'get', 'see', 'where', 'Sidney', 'Dewey', 'Gale', 'are', 'lives', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'Scream', 'pack', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'price']",Scream Triple Pack: (Scream / Scream 2 / Scream 3)
