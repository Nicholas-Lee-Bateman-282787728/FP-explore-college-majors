272505,AFZU6XDO5L75R,6301926374,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[7, 7]","It's 1935, Life for Ryan Delaney has been tough. His father is dead, his mother recuperating from tuberculosis, whom it has been his duty to take care of and try to survive without enough food. He is fresh out of high school at age 16. Trying to get a scholarship to go to college, and looking for a job to pay the remainder of his tuition, jobs just don't seem to be available. Ryan's pesky little brother Sullivan, whom he has never realy known, has been living with relatives throughout his mothers long illness. Sullivan is sent back home to live, and placed in Ryan's care while their mother works. In order to obtain a job as a camp counselor, Ryan manufactures an elaborate lie about his age and experience and bites off a bit more than he can chew. Ryan impresses the dean so much with his interview that he is not only given the job, but hired as HEAD COUNSELOR of the camp. The problem? Ryan knows nothing about leadership, is barely more than a child himself, can't swim, has never been to camp before and hates 10 year olds. He also has to find a way to go away for the summer and tend to his 10 year brother at the same time. He manages to get Sullivan into camp as well, but on an agreement that Sulli fends for himself. In addition to the challenges that wait ahead for Ryan, life gets really complicated and Sulli is unable to manage on his own. The two brothers are forced to get acquainted really for the first time in their lives. Ryan receives word while at camp, that his scolarship application has been denied. He needs a miracle in order to go to college and earn a good enough living to raise his family out of the squallers of poverty. Ryan however soon realizes that is not the only miracle he needs.This is a very heart warming movie that I highly recommend to anyone. Emmy Award Winner (Best Actor) Greg Spottiswood, stars as Ryan Delaney. His performance is awesome, but he's not the only one stealing the show. The young man who plays as Sullivan does an outstanding job portraying his young character. All the acting in this film is wonderful and very believable. The casting is top notch and the story line is superb! Showcased in beautiful canadian surroundings, this film seems to have it all. The one hitch about ""Looking for Miracles"" that I found unsatisfactory, were a couple brief encounters with snakes. This would normally cause me to stop the movie and pull it out right there. If you're like me, you'll have to cover your eyes a couple minutes and wait until it's safe to look. The ending could have been much worse, and was really pretty good, but rather abrupt and I felt it could have been very powerful with another five minutes on the film. Includes a ""behind the scenes"" extra on the DVD. I loved this movie. This is one film that I would loved to have seen another hour of. You won't want it to end!",5,Sometimes Miracles are right under our nose all the time,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,2849,"['1935', 'Life', 'Ryan', 'Delaney', 'been', 'tough', 'father', 'dead', 'mother', 'recuperating', 'tuberculosis', 'whom', 'been', 'duty', 'take', 'care', 'try', 'survive', 'enough', 'food', 'fresh', 'high', 'school', 'age', '16', 'Trying', 'get', 'scholarship', 'go', 'college', 'looking', 'job', 'pay', 'remainder', 'tuition', 'jobs', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'available', 'Ryan', 'pesky', 'little', 'brother', 'Sullivan', 'whom', 'never', 'realy', 'known', 'been', 'living', 'relatives', 'mothers', 'long', 'illness', 'Sullivan', 'sent', 'back', 'home', 'live', 'placed', 'Ryan', 'care', 'mother', 'works', 'order', 'obtain', 'job', 'camp', 'counselor', 'Ryan', 'elaborate', 'lie', 'age', 'experience', 'off', 'bit', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'Ryan', 'dean', 'so', 'much', 'interview', 'not', 'only', 'given', 'job', 'hired', 'HEAD', 'COUNSELOR', 'camp', 'problem', 'Ryan', 'nothing', 'leadership', 'barely', 'more', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swim', 'never', 'been', 'camp', 'hates', '10', 'year', 'olds', 'also', 'find', 'way', 'go', 'away', 'summer', 'tend', '10', 'year', 'brother', 'same', 'time', 'get', 'Sullivan', 'camp', 'as', 'well', 'agreement', 'Sulli', 'addition', 'challenges', 'wait', 'ahead', 'Ryan', 'life', 'really', 'complicated', 'Sulli', 'unable', 'manage', 'own', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'forced', 'get', 'acquainted', 'really', 'first', 'time', 'lives', 'Ryan', 'word', 'camp', 'scolarship', 'application', 'been', 'denied', 'miracle', 'order', 'go', 'college', 'earn', 'good', 'enough', 'living', 'raise', 'family', 'squallers', 'poverty', 'Ryan', 'however', 'soon', 'not', 'only', 'miracle', 'very', 'heart', 'warming', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Greg', 'Spottiswood', 'Ryan', 'Delaney', 'performance', 'awesome', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'stealing', 'show', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Sullivan', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'young', 'character', 'acting', 'film', 'wonderful', 'very', 'believable', 'casting', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'line', 'superb', 'Showcased', 'beautiful', 'canadian', 'surroundings', 'film', 'have', 'one', 'hitch', 'Looking', 'Miracles', 'found', 'unsatisfactory', 'were', 'couple', 'brief', 'encounters', 'snakes', 'would', 'normally', 'cause', 'stop', 'movie', 'pull', 'out', 'right', 'there', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'have', 'cover', 'eyes', 'couple', 'minutes', 'wait', 'safe', 'look', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'was', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'powerful', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'scenes', 'extra', 'DVD', 'loved', 'movie', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'hour', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'end']",N/A

It's a lovely tale, and I wish the actors had kept acting! A very talented cast.
