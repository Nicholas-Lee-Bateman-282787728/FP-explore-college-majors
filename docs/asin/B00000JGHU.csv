506081,AFDHYHC7ZIWG3,B00000JGHU,BRENT BEEN,"[3, 4]",Moving drama about 18 year old daughter(Emily Lloyd) of father who was killed in Vietnam. Outstanding performances with solid cast especially Willis. Film is a living testament also to the geographical differences during Vietnam War as there was more political support for the troops and the cause in the south and midwest as opposed to the East and West coasts. Final scene takes place on location at actual Vietnam Wall in Washington.,5,Top Notch,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,436,"['Moving', 'drama', '18', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'Lloyd', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Vietnam', 'Outstanding', 'performances', 'solid', 'cast', 'especially', 'Willis', 'Film', 'living', 'testament', 'also', 'geographical', 'differences', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'more', 'political', 'support', 'troops', 'cause', 'south', 'midwest', 'opposed', 'East', 'West', 'coasts', 'Final', 'scene', 'place', 'location', 'actual', 'Vietnam', 'Wall', 'Washington']",N/A

It is a thoughtful character study that creeps up on you and really gets under the skin.Bruce Willis wisely downplays all of his usual acting schtick (much like he did in Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys). He delivers a truly heartfelt performance as an emotionally damaged Vietnam veteran. Pay close attention to what he does in this movie -- he uses his very expressive face to convey a wide spectrum of emotions that brings across the inner turmoil that is going on in his character.In Country is told from the perspective of Emily Lloyd's character. She is a naive, young girl who wants to know more about the war that took her father away from her and can't understand why her father's friends are so unwilling to talk about their experiences. This is her best performance of her, so-far, short career.But, let's be honest, this film belongs to Willis and deservedly so. He's the kind of actor who needs a strong director to reign him in and Norman Jewison is that kind of a filmmaker. He really gets a wonderful performance out of Willis that is wrenching, funny, sad and everything in between.This an excellent character-driven film set in small-town America much like the equally underappreciated Robert De Niro-Ed Harris drama, Jacknife. In Country examines how war not only effects those who fought in it but also the people around them after they return home.Sadly, the DVD has nothing in the way of extras (a commentary track by Jewison or the book's author, Bobbie Ann Mason, would have been nice) and is also presented in pan and scanned mode.

506084,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00000JGHU,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","""In Country"" was a contemporary film on initial release in 1989 but it has not dated one bit.  It depicts an important turning point in our country's history when we were trying to come to grips with the aftershocks of the Vietnam conflict.  The setting is small town Kentucky where the wounds inflicted by the war are still raw.  The townsfolk try to sweep the pain under the rug and even the returnees attempt in vain to forget about it.  Only Sam(Emily Lloyd) wants more light shed on the events everybody wants to vanish becuase she wants to know more about the father she never knew and what he did over there.  The film culminates in an emotional visit to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington where the names etched in black granite say more than a thousand speeches.  Lloyd, a British actress who was excellent in ""Wish You Were Here"", acquits herself well here.  The key to the film's success in my mind is Bruce Willis who portrays her Uncle Emmitt, a psychically scarred veteran.  Willis' role here is smallish but no less important.  Emmitt suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome but Willis' acoount of him is understated and honest.  His work here runs through the film's fabric and if it were misplayed the message here would have been undermined.  ""In Country"" is as important a film as more recognizable ones like ""Coming Home"" or ""The Deer Hunter"".",5,Moving Film That Earns It's Tears,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1371,"['Country', 'was', 'contemporary', 'film', 'initial', 'release', '1989', 'not', 'dated', 'one', 'bit', 'important', 'turning', 'point', 'country', 'history', 'when', 'were', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'aftershocks', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'setting', 'small', 'town', 'Kentucky', 'where', 'wounds', 'inflicted', 'war', 'are', 'still', 'raw', 'townsfolk', 'try', 'sweep', 'pain', 'rug', 'even', 'returnees', 'attempt', 'vain', 'forget', 'Only', 'Sam', 'Emily', 'Lloyd', 'more', 'light', 'shed', 'events', 'everybody', 'vanish', 'becuase', 'know', 'more', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'did', 'there', 'film', 'culminates', 'emotional', 'visit', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Memorial', 'Washington', 'where', 'names', 'etched', 'black', 'granite', 'say', 'more', 'thousand', 'speeches', 'Lloyd', 'British', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'excellent', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'well', 'here', 'key', 'film', 'success', 'mind', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'Uncle', 'Emmitt', 'psychically', 'scarred', 'veteran', 'Willis', 'role', 'here', 'smallish', 'less', 'important', 'Emmitt', 'suffers', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'Willis', 'acoount', 'understated', 'honest', 'work', 'here', 'film', 'fabric', 'were', 'misplayed', 'message', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'undermined', 'Country', 'as', 'important', 'film', 'more', 'recognizable', 'ones', 'Coming', 'Home', 'Deer', 'Hunter']",N/A

Bruce Willis can be a devastating actor when he wants to, and here, he clearly wants to. You would think there would be a surplus of films about war orphans, but this is one of the few.  The fact that it is a young girl adds to the poignancy and multi-layered dimensions.

Edwards,"[4, 4]","Amazon suggested I write a review on this beautifully done movie, one for which I think Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd deserved Emmies for their performances.  That recent reviews have panned the movie are a testament to the failure of history--forget it, and you will repeat it.  And that is what is happening with America's new crop of discouraged veterans lost in the sea of a society that does not understand or care, and a federal institution (Veteran's Affairs) flooded with workers still trying to rid themselves of Viet Nam vets and fearful of the new vets.Buy the movie, watch it with family and friends, read the book (which is a totally wonderful read), and try to find empathy for those struggling with the unseen losses of the wars.Forget the reviews that pan the movie or the book; and most of all, remember it is fiction not history you are watching.

506088,A2SU0F8DZS0OD7,B00000JGHU,Fairleigh Brooks,"[3, 6]","While almost no adaptation is page-for-page from the novel, most follow the original story, removing sequences that can be removed. Some cinematic versions of original works, though, require a different story altogether. ""In Country"" is one of those, but we never see that other story.The novel concerns Sam, who lives with her Vietnam vet uncle, is finishing high school and wondering about the next sixty years of her life. The action takes place in their small town, until Sam, Uncle and her maternal grandmother travel many hundreds of miles in a VW bug convertible to see The Wall in D.C., on which is inscribed the name of Sam's father and, of course, her grandmother's son.In my opinion that journey is the cinematic story, but we never see it. At the end, which is quite beautiful, Grandma reaches out to touch the engraved letters of her son's name, but we really know nothing about her. Up until that point we see her only as a caricature of a farm wife. Had she been a main character we might have seen the further ripples of Vietnam, or any war, which is to say the ones that tend to be invisible.This is not a bad movie, and is technically impressive.
