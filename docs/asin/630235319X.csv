It has an atmosphere reminiscent of October Sky, even the sound-track music seems similar and deserving of stand-alone performance.The cinematography is also reminiscent of October Sky, with its seemingly effortless depiction of real people in real situations. There is no phony lighting, and there is little make-up (apparently). I had to remind myself that ""artlessness"" is often simply the highest art.The attitudes about baseball playing serve as metaphor for life in this movie without heavy sermonizing or symbolism. Even the costumes of the cast are so natural (and true to the historic period) that the movie almost seems to be a documentary.My advice: have a box of Kleenex handy when watching this film.I did have one minor question/complaint: was the death of the star due to overexertion or to a deliberate overdose of high-blood-pressure medication? A bottle of medication was shown as explanation (?) and the word ""terminal"" was on the label, but the part the medication played in his death was not clear.As a testimony to my attitude, I am ordering two copies of the DVD to give to my family for Christmas!",5,"Beautifully, painfully realistic.",1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,1204,"['When', 'movie', 'came', 'HDTV', 'was', 'ready', 'switch', 'channels', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'atmosphere', 'reminiscent', 'October', 'Sky', 'even', 'sound-track', 'music', 'similar', 'deserving', 'stand-alone', 'performance.The', 'cinematography', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'October', 'Sky', 'seemingly', 'effortless', 'depiction', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'situations', 'phony', 'lighting', 'little', 'make-up', 'apparently', 'had', 'remind', 'artlessness', 'often', 'simply', 'highest', 'art.The', 'attitudes', 'baseball', 'playing', 'serve', 'metaphor', 'life', 'movie', 'heavy', 'sermonizing', 'symbolism', 'Even', 'costumes', 'cast', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'true', 'historic', 'period', 'movie', 'almost', 'be', 'documentary.My', 'advice', 'have', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'handy', 'when', 'watching', 'film.I', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'minor', 'question/complaint', 'was', 'death', 'star', 'due', 'overexertion', 'deliberate', 'overdose', 'high-blood-pressure', 'medication', 'bottle', 'medication', 'was', 'shown', 'explanation', 'word', 'terminal', 'was', 'label', 'part', 'medication', 'played', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'clear.As', 'testimony', 'attitude', 'am', 'ordering', 'two', 'copies', 'DVD', 'give', 'family', 'Christmas']",N/A

Pastime carries a lot of heart because of both the understated acting performances and the easy-going, nostalgic look of the 1950s.  This is certainly actor William Russ' best performance.  He is a veteran, but he has not been made jaded, and he is a career minor leaguer, but he is a baseball everyman.  With this much sentiment and success in filmmaking, &#34;Pastime&#34; remains to Baseball Films what the theme of the &#34;aging cowboy&#34; has always meant to so many Westerns.",5,Another 5 Star Review for a Deserving Films,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,609,"['Pastime', 'one', 'great', 'baseball', 'films', 'story', 'simple', 'emotionally', 'more', 'complex', 'film', 'Pastime', 'lot', 'heart', 'understated', 'acting', 'performances', 'easy-going', 'nostalgic', 'look', '1950s', 'certainly', 'actor', 'William', 'Russ', 'best', 'performance', 'veteran', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'jaded', 'career', 'minor', 'leaguer', 'baseball', 'everyman', 'much', 'sentiment', 'success', 'filmmaking', '34', 'Pastime', '34', 'Baseball', 'Films', 'what', 'theme', '34', 'aging', 'cowboy', '34', 'always', 'meant', 'so', 'many', 'Westerns']",N/A
308380,A3QIEISBZP4QTV,630235319X,"Mark E. Baxter ""Inquirer""","[4, 10]","As a baseball fan, I really looked forward to seeing this movie.  I've followed minor league baseball teams since the 60's.  Modesto California Reds, Kenosha Wisconsin Twins, Salt Lake City Utah Trappers, Gulls, Buzz and whatever they are called this year,  Ogden Raptors, and dozens of others around the country.  This movie advertises cameos from baseball greats like Killebrew and Feller.  Unfortunately the cameos are meaningless.But the plot of the movie is full of potential.  An ageing pitcher, played well by William Russ, struggles to hang on to the great love of his life, baseball, for just a little longer.  He even is trying to set the record for longest career, shades of Kevin Costner in Bull Durham trying to set the minor league home-run record. He pitched once in the major leagues to Stan Musial who hit a grand slam off of him.  And that's the high point of the film.  The rest is even more of a downer than that.****Spoiler Alert*****  He fails at the record, staying in baseball, and life in general.  But that isn't the point of this movie.  Indeed, the movie has no point.  Just when you think it will say something about ageing gracefully, it switches to another plot.  Then you think it will say something about racism as the major character makes friends with a new black pitcher shunned by the others.  But this relationship doesn't really develop either.  They hang out together a little bit, but that's about it.  Then you think maybe the movie is really about how the new player is helped out and guided by the veteran, but other than a few inanities like ""look people in the eyes when you talk to them"",  this plot line also fizzles.William Russ carries this film to its uncertain end.  He is superb in this role.  But the script is so weak that there isn't much that can be done.  There are so many directions this film could have gone, but it ended up being a pastiche of unfulfilled sub-plots.The veteran pitcher is cut from the team eventually at a team party, goes back to the ball park, and dies on the mound from pitching too hard.  Yea, I know, doesn't make sense to me either although apparently the veteran takes blood pressure pills.Anyway, this film is very disappointing and seems incomplete.  You may find William Russ's acting as the veteran is the only noteworthy part of this film.  I'd say this movie strikes out after watching a few curve balls go by.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw in this movie, but I sure won't watch it twice.",3,Forgettable look at minor leagues in the 50's,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2493,"['baseball', 'fan', 'really', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'teams', '60', 'Modesto', 'California', 'Reds', 'Kenosha', 'Wisconsin', 'Twins', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Utah', 'Trappers', 'Gulls', 'Buzz', 'are', 'called', 'year', 'Ogden', 'Raptors', 'dozens', 'others', 'country', 'movie', 'cameos', 'baseball', 'greats', 'Killebrew', 'Feller', 'Unfortunately', 'cameos', 'are', 'plot', 'movie', 'full', 'potential', 'ageing', 'pitcher', 'played', 'well', 'William', 'Russ', 'hang', 'great', 'love', 'life', 'baseball', 'just', 'little', 'longer', 'even', 'trying', 'set', 'record', 'longest', 'career', 'shades', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'trying', 'set', 'minor', 'league', 'home-run', 'record', 'pitched', 'once', 'major', 'leagues', 'Stan', 'Musial', 'who', 'hit', 'grand', 'slam', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'rest', 'even', 'more', 'downer', '****Spoiler', 'Alert*****', 'record', 'staying', 'baseball', 'life', 'general', ""n't"", 'point', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'point', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'will', 'say', 'something', 'ageing', 'gracefully', 'plot', 'Then', 'think', 'will', 'say', 'something', 'about', 'racism', 'major', 'character', 'friends', 'new', 'black', 'pitcher', 'shunned', 'others', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'really', 'develop', 'hang', 'out', 'together', 'little', 'bit', 'Then', 'think', 'maybe', 'movie', 'really', 'how', 'new', 'player', 'helped', 'guided', 'veteran', 'other', 'few', 'inanities', 'look', 'people', 'eyes', 'when', 'talk', 'plot', 'line', 'also', 'fizzles.William', 'Russ', 'film', 'uncertain', 'end', 'superb', 'role', 'script', 'so', 'weak', ""n't"", 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'directions', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'pastiche', 'unfulfilled', 'sub-plots.The', 'veteran', 'pitcher', 'cut', 'team', 'eventually', 'team', 'party', 'back', 'ball', 'park', 'dies', 'mound', 'pitching', 'too', 'hard', 'Yea', 'know', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'apparently', 'veteran', 'blood', 'pressure', 'pills.Anyway', 'film', 'very', 'disappointing', 'incomplete', 'may', 'find', 'William', 'Russ', 'acting', 'veteran', 'only', 'noteworthy', 'part', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'out', 'watching', 'few', 'curve', 'balls', 'go', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'saw', 'movie', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'twice']",N/A

William Russ (Roy Dean Bream) is great as an aging pitcher, whose dedication and love for the game contrasts with the flippant and immature attitudes of some of the younger players. Glenn Plummer (Tyrone Debray) portrays a 17 year old black pitcher making his start in the minors. Roy Dean becomes friend and mentor to Tyrone.

308382,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,630235319X,Mitch Weaver,"[25, 26]","Pastime focuses on two minor league pitchers in the 1950's. The first is an older pitcher named Roy Dean (William Russ). Roy had a &quot;cup of coffee&quot; in the major leagues when he was younger, but was sent back down to the minors shortly after. Years later, he is still playing in the minors and refuses to accept the fact that it is time for him to retire. Roy is told by the team's manager Clyde Bigby (Noble Willingham)that the team owner Peter LaPorte ( Jefferey Tambor)is getting ready to release him. Shortly after, an up and coming African American pitcher named Tyrone( Glen Plummer)joins the team. Tyrone has got a major league arm, but is extremely shy and unsure of himself because he is a 17 year old black kid. Roy sees potential in Tyrone, and takes him under his wing to teach him about the finer points of the game, and more importantly, the finer points of life.Pastime is perhaps one of the greatest baseball films ever made. It is a shame that no one really knows about it. The film is extremely realistic when it comes to the minor league atmosphere of the 1950's. William Russ and Glen Plummer both do an amazing job in their roles. Pastime also happens to be one of the best &quot;buddy&quot; films I have ever seen because of the relationship that develops between the two. It is very touching to see Roy pass on all his knowledge to Tyrone to help him get to the majors. The reason the film is inspiring, is because both Roy and Tyrone are underdogs. Everyone sees Roy as a pitcher past his prime, and no one takes him seriously. No one on the team respects Tyrone because he is a black man. Watching the two of them face the odds together is amazing. The ending to this film is extremely emotional and definately a tear jerker. It was also extremely satisfying.Overall, Pastime is one of the best baseball films I have ever seen. William Russ and Glen Plummer offer outstanding performances, and the film is very realistic with both the baseball action and the atmosphere of the 1950's. I highly recommend this film.A solid 5 stars...",5,The best baseball film you've never seen..,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2065,"['Pastime', 'two', 'minor', 'league', 'pitchers', '1950', 'first', 'older', 'pitcher', 'named', 'Roy', 'Dean', 'William', 'Russ', 'Roy', 'had', 'quot', 'cup', 'coffee', 'quot', 'major', 'leagues', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'sent', 'back', 'down', 'minors', 'shortly', 'Years', 'later', 'still', 'playing', 'minors', 'accept', 'fact', 'time', 'retire', 'Roy', 'told', 'team', 'manager', 'Clyde', 'Bigby', 'Noble', 'Willingham', 'team', 'owner', 'Peter', 'LaPorte', 'Jefferey', 'Tambor', 'getting', 'ready', 'release', 'Shortly', 'up', 'coming', 'African', 'American', 'pitcher', 'named', 'Tyrone', 'Glen', 'Plummer', 'team', 'Tyrone', 'got', 'major', 'league', 'arm', 'extremely', 'shy', 'unsure', '17', 'year', 'old', 'black', 'kid', 'Roy', 'potential', 'Tyrone', 'wing', 'teach', 'finer', 'points', 'game', 'more', 'importantly', 'finer', 'points', 'life.Pastime', 'perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'baseball', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'shame', 'one', 'really', 'film', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'when', 'minor', 'league', 'atmosphere', '1950', 'William', 'Russ', 'Glen', 'Plummer', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'roles', 'Pastime', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'quot', 'quot', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'touching', 'see', 'Roy', 'pass', 'knowledge', 'Tyrone', 'help', 'get', 'majors', 'reason', 'film', 'inspiring', 'Roy', 'Tyrone', 'are', 'underdogs', 'Everyone', 'Roy', 'pitcher', 'prime', 'one', 'seriously', 'No', 'one', 'team', 'Tyrone', 'black', 'man', 'Watching', 'two', 'face', 'odds', 'together', 'amazing', 'ending', 'film', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'definately', 'tear', 'jerker', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'satisfying.Overall', 'Pastime', 'one', 'best', 'baseball', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'William', 'Russ', 'Glen', 'Plummer', 'offer', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'baseball', 'action', 'atmosphere', '1950', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

I had picked up a VHS copy of this film on eBay from someone in Denholm, and after watching it, it automatically became one of the best baseball films I have ever seen (THE best I've seen, is of course, Field of Dreams, which I will review at another time), maybe even one of the greatest films I've ever seenThe movie is set in 1957, and centers around veteran minor league pitcher for the Steamers, Roy Dean Bream (Played by William Russ from Boy Meets World) whose sheer love of the game has kept him in it well past the height of his career, a three week stint in the major leagues twelve years earlier. In comes Tyrone Debray (Played by Glenn Plummer), a black (or African-American) seventeen year-old rookie, who joins the Steamers and befriends Roy. They end up challenging the racism, envy, and disbelief of the other players, one of the other players being played by Patrick O'Bryan from 976-EVIL.I really did like Russ' character as well as the character of Tyrone. One notable moment was when Roy asked Tyrone if he wanted a drink, Tyrone tells him that he's seventeen and then Roy offers him soda instead. And how could I write this review without mentioning Jeffrey Tambor's character of Peter LaPorte, the Steamers manager, who in my opinion, made for slight comic relief. The movie also features cameos by six of the greatest major league baseball players of all time, including, Duke Snider, Bob Feller, Ernie Banks, Harmon Killebrew, Bill Mazeroski, and Don Newcombe.Highly recommended.EXTRAS: The Cineplex Odeon logo appears at both the beginning and the end of the tape, but that's it.",5,One of the greatest baseball films I have ever seen. 10/10,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1702,"['Well', 'springtime', 'corner', 'baseball', 'season', 'corner', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'VHS', 'copy', 'film', 'eBay', 'someone', 'Denholm', 'watching', 'automatically', 'became', 'one', 'best', 'baseball', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'course', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'will', 'review', 'time', 'maybe', 'even', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seenThe', 'movie', 'set', '1957', 'centers', 'veteran', 'minor', 'league', 'pitcher', 'Steamers', 'Roy', 'Dean', 'Bream', 'Played', 'William', 'Russ', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'sheer', 'love', 'game', 'kept', 'well', 'height', 'career', 'three', 'week', 'stint', 'major', 'leagues', 'twelve', 'years', 'earlier', 'Tyrone', 'Debray', 'Played', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'black', 'African-American', 'seventeen', 'year-old', 'rookie', 'who', 'Steamers', 'Roy', 'end', 'up', 'challenging', 'racism', 'envy', 'disbelief', 'other', 'players', 'one', 'other', 'players', 'being', 'played', 'Patrick', ""O'Bryan"", '976-EVIL.I', 'really', 'did', 'Russ', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Tyrone', 'One', 'notable', 'moment', 'was', 'when', 'Roy', 'asked', 'Tyrone', 'wanted', 'drink', 'Tyrone', 'seventeen', 'then', 'Roy', 'soda', 'instead', 'how', 'could', 'write', 'review', 'mentioning', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'character', 'Peter', 'LaPorte', 'Steamers', 'manager', 'who', 'opinion', 'made', 'slight', 'comic', 'relief', 'movie', 'also', 'cameos', 'six', 'greatest', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'players', 'time', 'including', 'Duke', 'Snider', 'Bob', 'Feller', 'Ernie', 'Banks', 'Harmon', 'Killebrew', 'Bill', 'Mazeroski', 'Don', 'Newcombe.Highly', 'recommended.EXTRAS', 'Cineplex', 'Odeon', 'logo', 'beginning', 'end', 'tape']",N/A

It is wise in its warnings about clinging too tightly to our own dreams, racism, and jealousy, and in its portrayal of mentoring. One of my favorite scenes is when Tyrone learns the Bream Dream.
