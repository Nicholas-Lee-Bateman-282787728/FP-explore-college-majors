I own the first season of the show, and would probably be inclined to buy the second.  I understand the frustration of those who are disappointed that the original tunes that made the show so authentically '50s' are not included.  And, I agree that the studio is cutting corners in that regard.  One of the biggest disappointments I've had in this area was with the best of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson video set.  When Johnny's final show originally aired in May of '92, it featured a montage of the musical acts that had appeared on The Tonight Show over 30 years; and it was a truly nostalgic look back at the greats who had played on the show.  When the videos came out(I purchased the VHS set first, then the DVDs when they became available), the final show video was missing the musical segment.  I was very disappointed; but here's the facts:  When a show is filmed or taped, the producers only have to pay the 'synchronization rights' -- that is, the right to use a copyrighted piece of music in conjunction with a video production.  The producers don't have to pay the 'performance rights' -- those rights are paid by the TV stations around the country in yearly 'blanket license' fees.  But...when the shows are put onto video, the studios would have to pay more money in copyrights for the privilege of including those same original songs in DVDs to be distributed and sold in non-broadcast forums.That's why they don't include the original music.  Are they being 'cheap'?Perhaps.  I've been frustrated by that practice, too.

Also, you get to drool over Richie's girlfriends: Arlene (Laurette Spang) and Gloria (Linda Purl)...hubba hubba!This season also has the ""new"" Chuck, Randolph Roberts. He ain't as good as Chuck #1, (Gavan O'Herlihy) but he still does a decent job before the character of Chuck disappeared into the Twilight Zone for the remainder of the series.Watching this set, I was surprised at how many scenes have been cut for syndication - it's almost like watching new shows in places - and it was very enjoyable, in spite of the musical hatchet job (there are 23 episodes and, if you enjoyed ""Happy Days""' first two filmed seasons, you won't mind the music substitutions TOO much - I think you'll enjoy it nevertheless).One Last Question: Why are the TV DVD releases having so many problems with the music? If movie DVD's have no problem with music clearances (AMERICAN GRAFFITI, AMERICAN HOT WAX, GREASE, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, and thousands more who use familiar songs over credits and in strategic places throughout the films), then why is it so tuff for the TV DVD's?

1043185,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000M343AI,Just Bill,"[101, 111]","I refuse to buy altered DVDs. I don't care how classic the show was. And, to me, Happy Days was a classic show. It was part of my childhood. I was in my early teens when this great show was broadcast. I've waited for it to appear on DVD ever since. But I WILL NOT BUY DVDs THAT ARE POORLY MADE -- ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE MISSING THE ORIGINAL MUSIC, OR HAVE SLOPPY CUTS TO COVER UP THE LACK OF ORIGINAL MUSIC.I don't understand how anyone could buy ANY DVD set that lacks the original music and contains sloppy cuts to cover the fact. I didn't buy WKRP In Cincinnati for that very reason. I had it in my hand. Then I read the back of the box and saw that it didn't contain the original music. I put it back on the shelf.Come on, people! How short-sighted are you to accept trash like this?!?!?!?! Americans complain about the poor quality of merchandise available in our country (Asian imports cost less because they're made less well. Duh!), but here we have a chance to fight the problem simply by doing nothing. That's right -- nothing. Don't buy the product. You'll save $30-$40, you'll retain your self respect, and the studios that released the garbage will be out tens of thousands of dollars. It's a win-win situation.The more we accept shoddy merchandise, the more studios will continue to force it on us. Don't you people realize that? Don't you see what's happening here? If everyone refused to buy Happy Days, the studio would lose money on this release. They'd have a choice then. If they want to MAKE money on the release, they go back and do it right. And they do it the right way for all future releases.The flip side is true as well. If we buy this garbage now, they'll continue to release DVD sets like this in the future. It's all about the bottom line, people!Miami Vice is an example of a DVD series done the right way. Those episodes are intact, all the music is there, and believe me it makes a difference. Some of the music in those scenes has stuck with me -- connected to those scenes! -- since the day they were broadcast 20 years ago. I applaud the Miami Vice DVDs. They were done right. I abhor the Happy Days DVD releases and I am ashamed of those who bought them for purely selfish reasons instead of considering the bigger picture.",1,IT'S SO EASY TO FIGHT CORPORATE GREED!

And there still was a feel of realism to the show - not the silliness that took over in just a couple years after when the show was filmed before a live audience on a sound stage. And it was still based in the 1950's. Again, in just a couple of seasons into the future, the '50's seemed to have been cast aside and all of a sudden we had 1970's hair (Suzie Quatro's shag comes to mind, among others) and attitudes, and the episodes were based mainly around Fonzie instead of the whole cast. He seemed to end up in every scene in future seasons.That's why I like these earlier episodes of Happy Days the best (the first two seasons) - it was still a quality show that centered around the exploits of Richie Cunningham and his family and friends instead of just Fonzie.Although I would love to own these DVD's, I cannot purchase them. Basing my reason solely on the reviews stating that the original music has been edited out, I won't buy them until this has been corrected (did they do the same thing to season 1 ?). It's a shame that this cannot be rectified. I mean, isn't that the whole point of buying TV shows on DVD - to get the whole show uncut?Once this mess has been taken care of, I will get the first two seasons (and maybe season three, although that was the beginning of the end in my eyes).Until then, I guess I will have to be satisfied to watch them whenever I can on broadcast or cable TV.",3,5 Stars for the episodes - 1 Star for Messing With the Original Music = 3 Stars,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,1476,"['Amazon', 'review', 'states', 'was', 'when', 'Happy', 'Days', 'hit', 'stride', 'still', 'was', 'feel', 'realism', 'show', 'not', 'silliness', 'took', 'over', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'live', 'audience', 'sound', 'stage', 'was', 'still', 'based', '1950', 'Again', 'just', 'couple', 'seasons', 'future', ""'50"", 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'aside', 'sudden', 'had', '1970', 'hair', 'Suzie', 'Quatro', 'shag', 'mind', 'others', 'attitudes', 'episodes', 'were', 'based', 'mainly', 'Fonzie', 'instead', 'whole', 'cast', 'seemed', 'end', 'up', 'scene', 'future', 'seasons.That', 'why', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'Happy', 'Days', 'best', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'still', 'quality', 'show', 'centered', 'exploits', 'Richie', 'Cunningham', 'family', 'friends', 'instead', 'just', 'Fonzie.Although', 'would', 'love', 'own', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'purchase', 'Basing', 'reason', 'solely', 'reviews', 'stating', 'original', 'music', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'been', 'corrected', 'did', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'season', '1', 'shame', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'rectified', 'mean', ""n't"", 'whole', 'point', 'buying', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'get', 'whole', 'show', 'uncut', 'Once', 'mess', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'will', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'maybe', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'eyes', '.Until', 'then', 'guess', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'satisfied', 'watch', 'whenever', 'can', 'broadcast', 'cable', 'TV']",Happy Days: Season 2

Wasn't it still supposed to be ""Rock Around the Clock?"" Instead it is replaced by the Season 3 theme called ""Happy Days"" which is supposed to be played at the end credits for season 2 - and in the old big band style like in season 1. Since the gags in the opening credits were originally put together to last through ""Rock Around the Clock"", we get the season 3 ""Happy Days"" song's last verse repeated to make up for the time difference. While this pisses me off, I still figured that I wouldn't be playing each opening song before every show anyway. I mean don't you people get tired of listening to Bill Haley over and over while you watch through the series? I also love the Hawaii 5-O theme, but I must admit that while watching that dvd I hit the remote button to skip the opening theme after a while.Yeah some of the classic songs have been replaced by ""bay-bayba-baby, baba ba-ba, ba-ray"" or other generics during a scene cut, and even though I would've liked to have Bobby Darin's Splish Splash in this dvd set at least they kept Potsie's version of it in ""Fonzie Joins the Band.""I blame the overly greedy music industry for delayed dvd releases, which can result in long waits, unreleased shows, or in this case - inferior product when a company decides to release the merchandise heavily edited. When an estate asks for a ridiculous amount it's difficult to make a decent profit. Better to not release it at all? Maybe not giving in to high monetary demands will show these greedy musicians that you either get fair compensation or nothing.Season 2's picture quality jumps from good to bad during a few of the shows. As I'm watching a crisp clear picture, it suddenly and inexplicably jumps into a faded blurry picture which is about as bad as my old TV back in the 70's. This is not good.I was fortunate to have bought this season 2 dvd from my local used dvd shop for a cool $7.50. None of it goes to Paramount, none goes to the greedy estates of these former musicians. It boggles my mind why people go out and buy brand new when the price will drop later. I save a ton on dvds this way.Now I'm thinking about getting a different region dvd of Happy Days season 2, which I heard that the music is intact and can play on computers just fine.

1043199,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000M343AI,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 10]","After my very long and uncomfortable wait that additional seasons never would see the light of day, Hollywood finally realized that Happy Days still captivates the American public.23 episodes of this 1974-1975 ABC series once again have us rocking out. Because of the longer season, there are MANY more classic episodes for us to enjoy.An appreciable change of course is that the Fonz is actually wearing a leather jacket, more suited to riding motorcycles and convincingly being a 1950's greaser. Despite actually having no experience with motorcycles, Henry Winkler himself even had said something realizing that a gray windbreaker was ridiculously unrealistic for this role.  I hope the network executives who thought a leather jacket would scare young children and/or prompt us to `act up' lost their jobs over that concern just because it was so absurd by the 1970's!He's also living in his own off-camera apartment apart from the Cunningham family during this season. However, he still gets just enough screen time to dispense Richie and company lots of advice. Plus, he actually `goofs up' too as opposed to being a perfect know-it all in the middle seasons (""Fonzie joins the band"").As opposed to the ""PC"" version which Henry Winkler himself apparently was encouraging in ending seasons (when he would eventually fall in love with a single mother!), this Fonz clearly supports the sexual double-standard. In ""Fonzie's getting married"" he stresses that the girl has to be untried--while he obviously has not saved himself for a theoretical wedding day.  Upon finding out that his intended wife works as a stripper, Fonzie decides to stick with bachelorhood for now.Doing work for a young divorcee provides the boys with an air of intrigue in ""Get a job"".  Because divorce was really taboo in the 1950's and American divorce laws were just getting reformed in the mid-1970's, the episode was especially poignant. I know that even some other fans of this show get nitpicky about historical `goofs' which transcended eras nicely, but I think this episode was important because divorce wouldn't become a `mainstreamed' subject until MUCH later than the 1970's.Ritchie encounters another sexual dilemma during this season. Thinking the Fonz is cool--especially with the ladies, he ultimately has a problem learning that his sister plans to go out with Spike-- who is a miniature version of his `Uncle Fonz' (""Not with my sister you don't"").  He worries what ultimately will happen to Joannie considering how much Spike looks up to Fonzie for everything and Fonzie's reputation with women. Personally, considering that Spike looks much younger than junior high, I actually wouldn't have gone out on a date with him--even if our date only would end at the kitchen table playing Monopoly.  Ritchie worried for nothing!""Guess who's coming to Christmas"" is another classic Happy Days episode for one reason. They tried to make him work first with Gavan O'Herlihy and then Randolph Roberts cast in the role as `the older hoop-shooting brother', but Chuck Cunningham could never click with us viewers, so this was the character's last episode and the Cunninghams subsequently and officially shrank down to just `two kids' with no additional explanation of what happened.  Subsequently reformatted in later seasons to fit in with that plot development, the episode ranks among the best episodes of an already great series-- certainly no small feat!There are no extras in this season and some of the period music was tampered with, but I can live with that.Paramount unfortunately  DID not refrain from attempting to pile the DVDs directly on top of each other in the packaging Unlike the season one release, the DVD discs are not in separate snap cases, something I thought was cheap at first but retrospectively now believe to be conscious of our desire to avoid the inevitable DVD scratches (even with careful handling) while wanting to produce the season sets cost effectively. Disc decoration is irrelevant, but I can't believe somebody in the company authorized the horrible discs directly on-top of each other concept.Since this series IS in the American History Museum of the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., I am especially amazed the studios gave it such low budget production treatment. This is one of the few series gennuinely deserving the red-carpet-release treatment.Perhaps additional customer lobbying--will sway the studios to finally get it right.

I agree; everything as it originally was would have been preferable, but  SO WHAT!!!!!!!!!Let me repeat that.  SO WHAT!!!!!!!!There is nothing so outrageous about them altering the music that would make me give this a horrible review.  I certainly wouldn't use those creative swear words with those * symbols to blank out letters.  That is just immature.  (Do people feel like they are being socially responsible by using the * symbol?) I feel like these reviewers are going to get violent or have heart attacks because paramount ""altered"" the music.  The music was fine.  It sounded fine.  It got the point across.  The stories were as wonderful as I remembered.  THAT'S why you buy this. Richie and the gang were as much fun to ""hang out with"" as they were when the show first aired.  THAT'S why you buy this.If you want the awesome stories, memorable characters, and downright sense of comfort and joy that this series brought, then buy it absolutely!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is inexpensive enough.If you are only interested in the theme and accompanying music (which as I said, is fine) then don't buy it and just find a CD of the music instead.Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the music.  I have actually met Bobby Arvon, the writer, composer, and original performer of the Happy Days music (on a royal caribbean cruise) and have his CD. But I'm not ready to kill myself over the issue like some of the reviewers for this product are.One review claims ""Paramount won't be getting any of my money for this edited set.""  Good.  While you're watching another show, I'll be enjoying a TV show from the 70's that I grew up on and hold nostalgically close to my heart.By the way....that reviewer and a couple of others generically talk about the show being edited or altered.  How do you really know this????  Did you watch the DVD while simultaneously watching old video tapes of original broadcasts? (Even though there were no VCRs at the time).  Also, if you claim that Paramount will never get your money for this, then you do not own it, so how do you really know that it is edited or even changed in any way?Get over it.  Buy this.  Enjoy this.  Fun show then.  Fun show now.  Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars.....I would have LOVED to see special features.Thank you for your time.",4,Don't listen to the bad reviewers.

I don't know who to blame here. I'm sure it would be in Paramount's best interest to keep the show intact. If we are to find blame, perhaps we need to look at the music industry.Perhaps I am nuts, but wouldn't the music industry benefit by having these 1950s artists featured on a popular DVD?

1043205,A2SDM2D1X3HE7Z,B000M343AI,take403,"[4, 4]","This is one of my favorite seasons of Happy Days, as it still features Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard) as the star, with his buddies Potsie Weber (Anson Williams), Ralph Malph (Donnie Most) and Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli (Henry Winkler) and his family, sister Joanie (Erin Moran), mother Marion (Marion Ross), father Howard (Tom Bosley) and sometimes brother Chuck (they got a new Chuck in Season 2 before the character disappeared forever in basketball heaven).So why only 4 stars? The music edits are horrible in a lot of episodes, particularly Cruisin', Wish Upon A Star (the lip and hand synching of the band playing is totally out of tempo and stands out like a sore thumb) ROTC (sorry, but I still think of ""Yakety Yak"" when Richie threatens to put the whole platoon on report) and Richie's Flip Side (which takes a great episode, chock full of early rock and roll classics and makes it not-so-great). Fortunately, they seemed to leave Anson Williams' vocals intact on Fonzie Joins The Band, ditto Flash Cadillac And The Continental Kids' smokin' take on ""Young Blood"" in Fish And The Fins and Fats Domino's ""Blueberry Hill"" is fortunately included in Fonzie's Getting Married. Also, Rock Around The Clock truly belongs as the opening theme here, not ""Sunday, Monday, happy days..."" (also missing are the car honking as the gang performs a Chinese fire drill and the sound of ketchup being poured all over the face of one hapless date at Arnold's).Now a word about the shows themselves- though Richie was still the star, Fonzie was slowly becoming more popular and he finally let out a generous ""Aaaayyy!"" Also, we find out about his own family in both A Star Is Bored (where he, Richie and the gang perform Hamlet) and the poignant Guess Who's Coming To Christmas (he at 1st declines an invitation to spend Christmas with the Cunninghams but is gently persuaded to stay). Haunted shows Richie and Joanie scared to enter a haunted house until there's a party at the old spook pad (""You broke my cookie, you big ox!,"" says one frustrated trick-or-treater to Howard). The Not Making Of The President speaks of the Eisenhower election (and features one of the last appearances of the drive-in at Arnold's, before it was all indoors). Wish Upon A Star features future Charlie's Angel Cheryl Ladd whom lucky Richie gets to escort to the dance. Not With My Sister You Don't features the debut of another minor character- Fonzie's young nephew Spike (he was later replaced by Chachi in Season 5 and had a similar history as ol' Chuck) who takes Joanie on her 1st date with concerned older brother Richie as the chaperone. Speaking of Chuck, he has a rare feature role in Richie Moves Out (where Richie goes away from home for some privacy and foolishly gives each of his buddies a key to the pad). ROTC features one of the 1st fantasy sequences in Happy Days as Richie dreams he's on trial for his lack of mercy (it would be repeated in the Old West episode and the Thanksgiving episode, both in later seasons) ""I should've asked for my dollar back!"". Big Money is based on a real-life instant which would later become the movie Quiz Show (Richie wrestles with his conscience and Dave Madden, who played Reuben Kinkaid on The Partridge Family, plays the flamboyant game show host). Who's Sorry Now features Richie trying to break it off with an old flame and gets some questionable advice from the Fonz. In Cruisin', Richie must use Dad's car to go out having fun with his friends since Mom totalled it (Joanie blabs the news and Howard wryly observes: ""If Mom had borrowed my car, we'd have my favorite for breakfast instead of Richie's!"") and features former Brady Bunch star Maureen McCormick. in The New Car, Fonzie sells Richie a car, unbeknownst it's a stolen car (so Richie confesses to the judge in his pajamas!). In Fonzie Joins The Band, Potsie's band gets a gig thanks to Howard and Fonzie generously donates tuxedos to the band (on the condition he can be their bongo player!). Fonzie's Getting Married features the 1st ever live Happy Days episode and Fonzie is engaged to a girl who's not all she appears to be. Joanie is a special guest on Howdy Doody in The Howdy Doody Show and Richie tries to get a picture of clown Clarabelle without his makeup. In Kiss Me Sickly, Richie is entrusted to Fonzie's girlfriend and thinks she may be contagious (""I always use this glass because it's my favorite!"") and in Get A Job, Richie gets a date with an older woman (with Potsie and Ralph almost spoiling it!). Finally, in the season closer, Potsie, Richie and Ralph are ""Goin' To Chicago"" and get in all kinds of potential trouble when they go out for the night without the teacher's permission (and Potsie forgets his money belt).All in all, a great season (which is the reason for this rather lengthy review). And I hear you can get this in the UK with the original music (sans Rock Around The Clock as the opening theme), though you'll need a Region 2 DVD player. However, just a word of advice to Paramount- if you re-release this on Blu-Ray, please include the original music (with Rock Around The Clock). You will make more money than you probably did on this so-so release of an otherwise great season.

I popped in the episode of ""Fish and the Fins"" waiting to go back to the years of watching this show as a 10 year old. I thought, ""here we go"", after seeing the record changer opening sequence. I couldn't wait to hear 'Rock Around the Clock', by Bill Haley and the Comets.  Instead of nostalgia, I get a feeling of anger when I hear the third season theme!!  What the heck?It's nice to watch the eps uncut, but I have to fast forward past the theme because I cannot stomach the revision.The first two seasons of Happy Days were pure gold. It really struck the balance of comedy and nostalgia.  Until this DVD release, I never realized how big of an impact the music played in evoking that nostalgia.

I understand that when a series is filled with original songs, it makes for a royal headache in terms of securing rights ($$).

Even the 11th season (which I think had some surprisingly fine episodes ... don't get me started on Season 10, of course). :)  But, how can anyone ignore that Paramount BOTH wimped out on the music rights, AND put a sloppy, cheap package together with, amazingly, no special features yet again (c'mon, would it cost Paramount THAT much to get some nice interviews from Don Most, Anson Williams, et al about the 2nd season episodes?).  There's a message that comes across from Paramount that seems to scream, ""We don't care about this product at all.""

I always loved the early Happy Days episodes for the stories themselves.  Yes, the music was an important element of the stories, but not enough for me to boycott Paramount in the futile hope of getting them to care.  As for 'Rock Around the Clock' being replaced by 'Happy Days', how many times do you really need to listen to that intro anyway?  If you miss it that much, pop in Season 1 for the intro, and then take a commercial break and switch to Season 2 for the stories.  While you're at it, download the authentic 50s music from iTunes and play that in the background while watching the episodes.  Either way, the strength of the episodes will carry this set.  It took 2 years to get this released, so I would not count on Paramount spending any more time debating the issue for future re-releases.  Let's get through Season 3 and call it quits anyway.
