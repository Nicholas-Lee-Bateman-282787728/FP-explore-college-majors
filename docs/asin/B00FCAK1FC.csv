Pardon any spoilers here, but there were some things going on that just made you go &#34;Huh?&#34; and scratch your head. Sorry, but if you wake up and are able to pull your fingernails off, then you probably need to go to the doctor. And if you're so weak that getting out of bed is painful, then you're probably not able to take on grown men, much less dispatch of them...... YET... the special effects were pretty cool.

I can't really say I &#34;enjoyed&#34; this per se, but I highly commend the filmmakers and especially the leading lady for taking on such a venture.

1671081,AZZ4GD20C58ND,B00FCAK1FC,M. Brookes,"[4, 6]","I fell for the hype, the tag line was a Cronenburg style body horror with rancid flesh, it sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. I shouldn't have bothered as it's pretty dull. The set up is ok, but the story is thin. A young struggling artist starts waking up with mysterious markings, she assumes that they are from her partners, but they continue and get gradually worse. She also kills a few people and plays with herself a lot.The problem with the film is that it drags on, nothing much happens and there's no interesting revelations, just a grim monotony. It also teases at some madness behind the transformation\, but they don't really add anything and are confused scenes with no real coherence.It does however do one thing well and that is the decay of her body, the effects are good and the whole film carries a sense of the disgusting, it's not enough to turn it into a good film, but it did prevent it from being rated as truly awful.",2,Dull and confused,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,959,"['fell', 'hype', 'tag', 'line', 'was', 'Cronenburg', 'style', 'body', 'horror', 'rancid', 'flesh', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'so', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'pretty', 'dull', 'set', 'up', 'ok', 'story', 'thin', 'young', 'struggling', 'artist', 'starts', 'waking', 'up', 'mysterious', 'markings', 'are', 'partners', 'continue', 'get', 'gradually', 'worse', 'also', 'few', 'people', 'plays', 'lot.The', 'problem', 'film', 'nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'interesting', 'revelations', 'just', 'grim', 'monotony', 'also', 'madness', 'transformation\\', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'are', 'confused', 'scenes', 'real', 'coherence.It', 'however', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'well', 'decay', 'body', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'whole', 'film', 'sense', 'disgusting', 'not', 'enough', 'turn', 'good', 'film', 'did', 'prevent', 'being', 'rated', 'truly', 'awful']",Thanatomorphose
1671082,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B00FCAK1FC,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[1, 2]","I suppose it would be ironic to call the sentences ahead &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, but you&#8217;ve been warned.  If you are looking for something intelligent or even relevant in this train-wreck of a story, look much further, because it&#8217;s not to be found here.  The gist:  a young woman&#8217;s body begins to decay for no apparent reason.  One could almost argue that she is a metaphor for our disintegrating social moral structure of today, or that as she decomposes, her sense of self suddenly finds&#8230;well, you know the rest.  But thanks to the near-fatal doses of full-frontal nudity that pervade the film, and the fact that Kayden Rose emotes about as much as a real corpse, there is little to be had for viewer connectedness.  Why should anyone give one iota of crap what happens to this girl?  Never mind the fact that there are too many questions in the film that shouldn&#8217;t be there that never get answered:  First and foremost, why the hell doesn&#8217;t she get to a doctor?  Why was she with that ugly-assed boyfriend?  Why does she randomly engage in oral sex with a guy she rebuffed 5 seconds earlier?? Why the murderous spree?  And of course, why did it take so long to get to the hallucinatory ending of this film?",1,Stupid and pointless.,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,1245,"['suppose', 'would', 'be', 'ironic', 'call', 'sentences', 'ahead', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', '8217', 'been', 'warned', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'intelligent', 'even', 'relevant', 'train-wreck', 'story', 'look', 'much', 'further', '8217', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'gist', 'young', 'woman', '8217', 'body', 'decay', 'apparent', 'reason', 'One', 'could', 'almost', 'argue', 'metaphor', 'disintegrating', 'social', 'moral', 'structure', 'today', 'sense', 'self', 'suddenly', '8230', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'thanks', 'near-fatal', 'doses', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'pervade', 'film', 'fact', 'Kayden', 'Rose', 'as', 'much', 'real', 'corpse', 'little', 'be', 'had', 'viewer', 'connectedness', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'give', 'one', 'iota', 'crap', 'what', 'girl', 'Never', 'mind', 'fact', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'film', 'shouldn', '8217', 'be', 'never', 'get', 'answered', 'First', 'foremost', 'why', 'hell', 'doesn', '8217', 'get', 'doctor', 'Why', 'was', 'ugly-assed', 'boyfriend', 'Why', 'randomly', 'engage', 'oral', 'sex', 'guy', 'rebuffed', '5', 'seconds', 'earlier', 'Why', 'murderous', 'spree', 'course', 'why', 'did', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'hallucinatory', 'ending', 'film']",Thanatomorphose
1671083,A3PO1EUJGZEOVY,B00FCAK1FC,Robert T,"[1, 2]",I just got done watching this movie and its very disgusting and disturbing. You basically watch a woman rot away. And there's no explanation as why its happening. And thats pretty much it. I actually fast forwarded a few times cause I thought I was gonna vomit lmao. That's how sick this movie is. And I loved it. I don't think I've seen a movie this disgusting. I'm so happy I picked this up. If you love horror and gore pick this movie up. And prepare yourself to be grossed out.,5,DISGUSTING!!!!!,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,481,"['just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'disgusting', 'disturbing', 'basically', 'watch', 'woman', 'away', 'explanation', 'why', 'happening', 'pretty', 'much', 'actually', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'few', 'times', 'cause', 'thought', 'was', 'gon', 'vomit', 'lmao', 'how', 'sick', 'movie', 'loved', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'disgusting', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'picked', 'up', 'love', 'horror', 'gore', 'pick', 'movie', 'up', 'prepare', 'be', 'grossed', 'out']",Thanatomorphose
1671084,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B00FCAK1FC,The Piper at the Gates,"[8, 10]","I happened to see the cover of this film (not the one shown here) on a free streaming movie website and thought it looked interesting. After reading the plot, as simple as it sounded, I was still intrigued and decided to watch it. What is the plot you ask? Well its about a girl in an apartment that begins to decompose and rot while still alive. It's as simple as that. There's no plot twists and turns, no surprises at all. But even with being said, this review is going to have some spoilers in it, so turn back now if you wish to find out for yourself. And here lies the first problem with this film. Nothing else happens!! Probably 90% of the movie is a naked girl walking around in her apartment gradually getting sicker and turning, in effect, to a decaying zombie. There's no twist at the end. Not even a hint of explanation as to why this is happening to her; nothing. The movie ends when she completely decays and melts into a mess of goo and bones. If you've seen the 1986 version of The Fly where Jeff Goldblum's character is shown slowly turning into the fly creature, then imagine that happening for pretty much 90 minutes straight. And why is she naked the whole time? I assume its so they could show off the special effects, but most of the close up shots shown deals with her head and extremities that wouldn't matter if she was nude or not. Nudity doesn't bother me in films, but I thought it in this case, it was a bit unnecessary. In some ways, this movie is filmed sorta like a college art film experiment. There are these small interludes that has these weird filters and film effects. They sort of look like something from a Rob Zombie music video. They show up throughout the film, last for a minute or two, then its cuts back to the actual movie. I thought these were kinda cool. The biggest problem I think I have is something so obvious that it was driving me crazy while I was watching it and made me want to scream. During the whole film, the main protagonist, never..NEVER attempts to go to the doctor, visit a hospital, call 911...nothing. Its vaguely mentioned once early on then is quickly forgotten (because a guy decides to let a very sickly looking girl perform oral sex on him rather than take her to a hospital). And its mentioned near the end too, but again, nothing becomes of it. How do you just bypass that and ignore it? 10-15 minutes into the film, the girl would be calling for help, going to the doctor, etc. But nope, she's rotting before her very eyes and yet she does nothing . And other character's reactions to seeing her in such a state are way underwhelming. They nearly act like she has the flu or something. And speaking of other characters, she manages to easily dispatch two grown men and kill them, yet she's in such a weak physical state. That didn't really make sense as well. Ok, so I've bashed this film enough..how about some of the positives? Well on a side note, it has an awesome song by The Black Angels in it called &#34;Manipulation&#34;. However, the biggest thing this movie has going for it is the gross out factor. Though its a slow and gradual process, the special effects get better and better as it goes. And this being a pretty low budget film I would assume, it has some great effects. I was very impressed in that regard. And I do like the overall concept to this film. Yes, its simple, but i feel it's an interesting and intriguing idea. But the problem is, there's just not a lot else going on here. The film is extremely slow paced. Again, at least some explanation or back story; something that have sped it up a bit. But really the only reason to keep watching is to see the effects get more and more disgusting. Overall, part of me really wants to hate this one, and part of me really wants to like it. But I feel that the negatives just out way the positives. I recommend viewing this one based the concept and special effects alone. But don't expect much else.",2,"Impressive special effects, but not much else...",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,3947,"['happened', 'see', 'cover', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'shown', 'here', 'free', 'streaming', 'movie', 'website', 'thought', 'looked', 'interesting', 'reading', 'plot', 'as', 'simple', 'sounded', 'was', 'still', 'intrigued', 'decided', 'watch', 'What', 'plot', 'ask', 'Well', 'girl', 'apartment', 'decompose', 'rot', 'still', 'alive', 'as', 'simple', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'even', 'being', 'said', 'review', 'going', 'have', 'spoilers', 'so', 'turn', 'back', 'now', 'wish', 'find', 'out', 'here', 'first', 'problem', 'film', 'Nothing', 'else', 'Probably', '90', '%', 'movie', 'naked', 'girl', 'walking', 'around', 'apartment', 'gradually', 'getting', 'sicker', 'turning', 'effect', 'decaying', 'zombie', 'twist', 'end', 'Not', 'even', 'hint', 'explanation', 'why', 'happening', 'nothing', 'movie', 'when', 'completely', 'decays', 'melts', 'mess', 'goo', 'bones', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1986', 'version', 'Fly', 'where', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'character', 'shown', 'slowly', 'turning', 'fly', 'creature', 'then', 'imagine', 'happening', 'pretty', 'much', '90', 'minutes', 'straight', 'why', 'naked', 'whole', 'time', 'assume', 'could', 'show', 'off', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'close', 'up', 'shots', 'shown', 'deals', 'head', 'extremities', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'nude', 'not', 'Nudity', ""n't"", 'bother', 'films', 'thought', 'case', 'was', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'ways', 'movie', 'filmed', 'sorta', 'college', 'art', 'film', 'experiment', 'are', 'small', 'interludes', 'weird', 'filters', 'film', 'effects', 'sort', 'look', 'something', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'music', 'video', 'show', 'up', 'film', 'last', 'minute', 'two', 'then', 'cuts', 'back', 'actual', 'movie', 'thought', 'were', 'kinda', 'cool', 'biggest', 'problem', 'think', 'have', 'something', 'so', 'obvious', 'was', 'driving', 'crazy', 'was', 'watching', 'made', 'want', 'scream', 'whole', 'film', 'main', 'protagonist', 'never..NEVER', 'attempts', 'go', 'doctor', 'visit', 'hospital', 'call', '911', 'nothing', 'vaguely', 'mentioned', 'once', 'early', 'then', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'guy', 'let', 'very', 'sickly', 'looking', 'girl', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', 'rather', 'take', 'hospital', 'mentioned', 'end', 'too', 'again', 'nothing', 'becomes', 'How', 'do', 'just', 'bypass', 'ignore', '10-15', 'minutes', 'film', 'girl', 'would', 'be', 'calling', 'help', 'going', 'doctor', 'etc', 'nope', 'rotting', 'very', 'eyes', 'yet', 'nothing', 'other', 'character', 'reactions', 'seeing', 'such', 'state', 'are', 'way', 'underwhelming', 'nearly', 'act', 'flu', 'something', 'speaking', 'other', 'characters', 'easily', 'dispatch', 'two', 'grown', 'men', 'kill', 'yet', 'such', 'weak', 'physical', 'state', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'well', 'Ok', 'so', ""'ve"", 'bashed', 'film', 'enough..how', 'positives', 'Well', 'side', 'note', 'awesome', 'song', 'Black', 'Angels', 'called', '34', 'Manipulation', '34', 'However', 'biggest', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'gross', 'out', 'factor', 'slow', 'gradual', 'process', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'being', 'pretty', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'would', 'assume', 'great', 'effects', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'regard', 'do', 'overall', 'concept', 'film', 'Yes', 'simple', 'i', 'feel', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'problem', 'just', 'not', 'lot', 'else', 'going', 'here', 'film', 'extremely', 'slow', 'paced', 'Again', 'least', 'explanation', 'back', 'story', 'something', 'have', 'sped', 'up', 'bit', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'see', 'effects', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'disgusting', 'Overall', 'part', 'really', 'hate', 'one', 'part', 'really', 'like', 'feel', 'negatives', 'just', 'out', 'way', 'positives', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'one', 'based', 'concept', 'special', 'effects', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'else']",Thanatomorphose
