The first thing I did upon receiving it was look it up on amazon and read the reviews. Then I took it home to watch and listen to all three DVDs in the package. The difference in my expectations after reading some of the less positive reviews and what I actually saw and heard is tremendous. There seems to be a lot of venom directed at this set because of Carlos Santana's involvement. And believe me, I too was a little concerned knowing the kind of schlock he has issued in recent years. But it also seems that many who attack this never even watched and listened!In my eyes, Santana redeems himself a little here with this hat trick. He doesn't dominate the action, he merely participates on a couple of songs with each headliner and in my opinion even adds to them. So the focus should not be on Santana at all even though he ""presents"" this set, it should be on the principal performers, Buddy Guy, Gatemouth Brown, and Bobby Parker.My favorite performances are actually in the order of the presentation of the discs. I did not know of Bobby Parker before but was spellbound by his electrifying performance. He played as if playing for a prize. His entire band is good but I note in particular the play of drummer Dion Clay and Dane Russel on harmonica. Parker's entire set is good, but a couple songs really stand out. Those are: Nothing But the Blues, Its Unfair, and Watch Your Step.As for Gatemouth Brown, I expected a lot from him. I've seen him in concert at small clubs many times and he always put on a tremendous show. He is probably the most musically eclectic of the three featured artists and he shows some of that here. But the strongest part of this set just happens to be three of the songs (Drifter, Grape Jelly, and Okie Dokie Stomp) on which he shares the stage with Santana. Not only does he himself shine, he allows every member of his band to show what he can do. Particularly enjoyable is Eric Demmer on saxophone who at times looks so energized that one fears the big galoot is going to have a heart attack at any time. Those who haven't seen Gate play before should watch the unique way he strokes his guitar.As for Buddy Guy, I've never been a huge fan, but I do recognize his many skills. Though I didn't care so much for the acoustic set, I really enjoy his covers of Hoochie Coochie Man and Stormy Monday.So even though I am not ecstatic about every song on the DVDs, I still give it five stars because there is more than enough great music to make me satisfied that whoever buys this will get value for money. This is one I will be watching many times in the years to come.",5,Santana's Hat Trick,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,2701,"['had', ""n't"", 'received', 'Blues', 'Montreux', 'Kwanzaa', 'gift', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'receiving', 'was', 'look', 'up', 'amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'Then', 'took', 'home', 'watch', 'listen', 'three', 'DVDs', 'package', 'difference', 'expectations', 'reading', 'less', 'positive', 'reviews', 'what', 'actually', 'saw', 'heard', 'tremendous', 'be', 'lot', 'venom', 'directed', 'set', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'involvement', 'believe', 'too', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'knowing', 'kind', 'schlock', 'issued', 'recent', 'years', 'also', 'many', 'who', 'attack', 'never', 'even', 'watched', 'listened', 'eyes', 'Santana', 'little', 'here', 'hat', 'trick', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'action', 'merely', 'couple', 'songs', 'headliner', 'opinion', 'even', 'focus', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'Santana', 'even', 'presents', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'principal', 'performers', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'Gatemouth', 'Brown', 'Bobby', 'Parker.My', 'favorite', 'performances', 'are', 'actually', 'order', 'presentation', 'discs', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Bobby', 'Parker', 'was', 'spellbound', 'electrifying', 'performance', 'played', 'playing', 'prize', 'entire', 'band', 'good', 'note', 'particular', 'play', 'drummer', 'Dion', 'Clay', 'Dane', 'Russel', 'harmonica', 'Parker', 'entire', 'set', 'good', 'couple', 'songs', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Nothing', 'Blues', 'Unfair', 'Watch', 'Step.As', 'Gatemouth', 'Brown', 'expected', 'lot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concert', 'small', 'clubs', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'put', 'tremendous', 'show', 'probably', 'most', 'musically', 'eclectic', 'three', 'featured', 'artists', 'here', 'strongest', 'part', 'set', 'just', 'be', 'three', 'songs', 'Drifter', 'Grape', 'Jelly', 'Okie', 'Dokie', 'Stomp', 'shares', 'stage', 'Santana', 'Not', 'only', 'shine', 'member', 'band', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Particularly', 'enjoyable', 'Eric', 'Demmer', 'saxophone', 'who', 'times', 'looks', 'so', 'energized', 'one', 'big', 'galoot', 'going', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'time', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Gate', 'play', 'before', 'should', 'watch', 'unique', 'way', 'guitar.As', 'Buddy', 'Guy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'do', 'recognize', 'many', 'skills', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'much', 'acoustic', 'set', 'really', 'enjoy', 'covers', 'Hoochie', 'Coochie', 'Man', 'Stormy', 'Monday.So', 'even', 'am', 'not', 'ecstatic', 'song', 'DVDs', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'more', 'enough', 'great', 'music', 'make', 'satisfied', 'whoever', 'will', 'get', 'value', 'money', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'come']","Carlos Santana Presents Blues at Montreux 2004: Buddy Guy, Clarence Gatemouth Brown"

1019171,A27CPDIYA90WR4,B000I5YDAU,Pans Labyrinth,"[4, 4]","Wow, I was completely blown away by the first DVD featuring a performance by Bobby Parker.  Bobby is a journeyman blues guitarist dating way back to the late 50's / early 60's, travelling all over performing shows to whoever appreciated the blues. With only a hand full of hits and albums released during his career, Bobby lights it up on this DVD like a man whose still plays with the energy of when he was just starting out.  Man, is his show red hot, and I gotta tell you it's nice that Santana comes out and jams with him for the last few songs, but even Santana stops playing just to hear his childhood hero keep playing.  Amazing set.The other 2 DVD's are great, especially Gatemoth Brown.  The man is old, but he his playing is fluid, simplistic, and bone cutting. While I wished he played more guitar than fiddle (which he is a killer fiddler), he lets his sax man carry on through much of his set. The jam with Santana at the end is a highlight as Buddy Guy even comes out to try Santana's guitar.Lastly is Buddy Guy.  Buddy Guy is a legend, and the most well known of the 3 blues masters appearing this night. He's a household name. He starts out acoustically for 3 songs which are unbelievable.  Unfortunately, since Buddy Guy is well known, watching and listening to Buddy Guy I feel like he is the Jimmy Buffet of the blues.  I mean that when he's on full on band mode, it's a party and everyone is invited to come on up and jam.  And that's exactly what happens at the end of the show (minus Gatemouth).  Santana, Buddy, Bobby Parker, Nile Rodgers, and Barbara Morrison just have a fun, flat out 30 minute jam at the end.  While it's not as hot as it had the potential to be, it's not a dud by any means, in fact, once Buddy Guy leaves the stage, Bobby Parker takes over, and just lights it up like he did earlier.If anyone appreciates deep Southern American blues, get this.
