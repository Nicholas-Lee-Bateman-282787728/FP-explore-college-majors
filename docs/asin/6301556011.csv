As the Amazon write up states, ballet is timeless and it wouldn't have bothered me if it was shot in the 1960's - ballet moves are ballet moves no matter what the participants are wearing!There are 2 workouts (easier and harder) on this dvd and you can skip through the chapters although you can't pre-program it.  Each workout includes a warm-up with stretches then into standing barre work (you will need a sturdy high-backed chair or something similar to hold on to); then onto standing center work (no barrre, you balance yourself) then onto the cool down.  There isn't a cool down for Level 1, you need to skip through to Level 2 if you want one, but it is very brief anyway.There is a lot of foot bending/pointing which you will have trouble doing if you are wearing runners - use either ballet slippers or even better the split-soled runners they wear in NYC Ballet 1 & 2 Workouts.Melissa really knows her stuff but the cueing isn't the best in some parts - but I have found if I keep count myself I can keep up easier.  After you repeat the workout a few times you end up learning it anyway.The moves she performs are more 'classic ballet' than the NYCB workouts as she does standing barre and does more positions than NYCB too.  I use both in rotation as you can't beat the fantastic quality of the NYBC, especially 2 with its dance routine at the end.I wouldn't recommed beginners do this tape as you do need reasonable flexibility to do the exercises safely.  If you can't touch your toes then work on that first!  Anyone with yoga or pilates experience will find the transition to ballet fairly easy, as many of the moves are also in ballet.I took a star off because of the poor quality of the dvd and Melissa's cueing isn't the best, but not to the point that it can't be picked up after a few plays.  If you want a top quality dvd with excellent cueing go for NYCB 2 - but this one is a great to alternate as it is more of a 'ballet class' than NYCB.",4,"I'm not a dancer or ballerina, but I love this workout",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2166,"['can', 'get', 'early', '1980', 'clothing/hair/make-up', 'poor', 'transfer', 'quality', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'think', 'rental', 'shop', 'VHS', 'had', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'plays', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'Amazon', 'write', 'up', 'states', 'ballet', 'timeless', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'was', 'shot', '1960', 'ballet', 'moves', 'are', 'ballet', 'moves', 'matter', 'what', 'participants', 'are', 'wearing', 'are', '2', 'workouts', 'easier', 'harder', 'dvd', 'can', 'skip', 'chapters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pre-program', 'workout', 'warm-up', 'stretches', 'then', 'standing', 'barre', 'work', 'will', 'need', 'sturdy', 'high-backed', 'chair', 'something', 'similar', 'hold', 'then', 'standing', 'center', 'work', 'barrre', 'balance', 'then', 'cool', 'down', ""n't"", 'cool', 'down', 'Level', '1', 'need', 'skip', 'Level', '2', 'want', 'one', 'very', 'brief', 'anyway.There', 'lot', 'foot', 'bending/pointing', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'doing', 'are', 'wearing', 'runners', 'use', 'ballet', 'slippers', 'even', 'better', 'split-soled', 'runners', 'wear', 'NYC', 'Ballet', '1', '2', 'Workouts.Melissa', 'really', 'stuff', 'cueing', ""n't"", 'best', 'parts', 'have', 'found', 'keep', 'count', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'easier', 'repeat', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'end', 'up', 'learning', 'anyway.The', 'moves', 'performs', 'are', 'more', ""'classic"", 'ballet', 'NYCB', 'workouts', 'standing', 'barre', 'more', 'positions', 'NYCB', 'too', 'use', 'rotation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'fantastic', 'quality', 'NYBC', 'especially', '2', 'dance', 'routine', 'end.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommed', 'beginners', 'do', 'tape', 'do', 'need', 'reasonable', 'flexibility', 'do', 'exercises', 'safely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'toes', 'then', 'work', 'first', 'Anyone', 'yoga', 'experience', 'will', 'find', 'transition', 'ballet', 'fairly', 'easy', 'many', 'moves', 'are', 'also', 'ballet.I', 'took', 'star', 'poor', 'quality', 'dvd', 'Melissa', 'cueing', ""n't"", 'best', 'not', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'few', 'plays', 'want', 'top', 'quality', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'cueing', 'go', 'NYCB', '2', 'one', 'great', 'alternate', 'more', ""'ballet"", 'class', 'NYCB']",N/A

255227,A7U9GG09POJ02,6301556011,Erin,"[33, 34]","I've done this tape/dvd about 120x from 1999-2006 -- only because there wasn't anything better at the time. It's what you'd call an 'old stand-by'. Nothing outstanding to recommend itself by todays standards in production or intellectual 'snap', but not the worst thing you will ever own as far as a ballet dvd goes.It's stand-out points include: an overcrowded class, ancient hyper-extended stretches, ugly costumes, an akward piano score, uninspiring stressful undertones, and a forced and failed attempt at grace - but all that said, it IS a ballet class! There is no getting away from that. It might be a ballet class from 1981, and you'd probably assume there'd be some redeeming nostalgia about that, but, no, it must have been a bad filming day.Back when I used to first do it, I never liked it but, it was the best there was, and I was bloody grateful and probably would have given it a much more glowing review 8 years ago. Now, tho? It's not worth the money in my opinion. Get Dmitri Roudnev's Ballet Class with Dmitri Roudnev (Demonstration of exercises for music of Best of Ballet Class Vol V) and be truly inspired by a worthy ballet class. (see my unabashed, miles-long, glowing review of Dmitri's DVD.)I've seen a lot, a lot, a lot of good reviews for this tape/dvd, The Ballet Workout. I believe they stem from the same gratitude my only positive feelings about it do, as well. Honestly, back in the day, there was this ballet class to buy - and that's it. And because it covers 'basic ballet' the gratitude for this even existing for home use was, understandably, overwhelming when it was reviewed in the past. But it doesn't hold up any more for that singular reason, and thankfully, others have come along to replace this stiff class that always made me feel like the tention in it would make it blow apart at the seams.Is it the worst ballet dvd you could by? Is it a waste of money? No. It really isn't. You do ballet exercises in it. It's a hard class. If it was the only ballet class left in the world, I'd again, be thrilled to have it. It takes itself very seriously. It's akward, stiff, static, and tense. There's almost zero joy in it. It reminds me of what taking ballet in prison would be like, except that's an insult to anyone studying ballet in prision.Is the Ballet Workout a treasure? Beautiful? Uplifting? Inspiring? No. It's just an old tired, ballet class now, and not wonderfully 'old' in that you can learn marvellous timeless things from it. Just old. Tired. Done.

255228,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,6301556011,Feles31,"[4, 6]","PROS:  I have no ballet training but I thought this would be an interesting way to increase flexibility and muscle tone.  The exercises here will do both.  I have quite a bit of flexibility already from martial arts but it is a serious challenge trying to do some of the intermediate poses and stretches they have.  There is mat work, bar work, and floor routines which varies it up and should appeal to real ballet practitioners, I should think.  The instructor is not too peppy or annoying to listen to and the piano music is tinkly soothing.CONS:  Overall, the relaxed atmosphere is too relaxed and quiet and it makes me feel rather sleepy and does not inspire exerting effort. While the moves are difficult, I still don't really break a sweat since the difficulty isn't sustained long enough to do so.  There's a lot of switching positions and pointing your toes inbetween difficult moves that let you rest a lot rather than, say, holding a difficult pose.  The whole floor routine section just isn't really helpful for anyone learning the moves to get a workout, so a con for me.  They do not emphasize going up on their toes for this one but they do emphasize turning the toes out for good form and possibly to avoid injuring yourself with some of the moves.  I am not particularly interested in gaining this flexibility and it is a strain trying to not use your knees and train your hips, legs, and feet instead which means your focus is there but not on getting a workout.",2,"as a workout, no",1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1480,"['PROS', 'have', 'ballet', 'training', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'way', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'muscle', 'tone', 'exercises', 'here', 'will', 'do', 'have', 'quite', 'bit', 'flexibility', 'already', 'martial', 'arts', 'serious', 'challenge', 'trying', 'do', 'intermediate', 'poses', 'stretches', 'have', 'mat', 'work', 'bar', 'work', 'floor', 'routines', 'varies', 'up', 'should', 'appeal', 'real', 'ballet', 'practitioners', 'should', 'think', 'instructor', 'not', 'too', 'peppy', 'annoying', 'listen', 'piano', 'music', 'tinkly', 'soothing.CONS', 'Overall', 'relaxed', 'atmosphere', 'too', 'relaxed', 'quiet', 'feel', 'rather', 'sleepy', 'not', 'inspire', 'exerting', 'effort', 'moves', 'are', 'difficult', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'sweat', 'difficulty', ""n't"", 'sustained', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'so', 'lot', 'switching', 'positions', 'pointing', 'toes', 'inbetween', 'difficult', 'moves', 'let', 'rest', 'lot', 'rather', 'say', 'holding', 'difficult', 'pose', 'whole', 'floor', 'routine', 'section', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'helpful', 'anyone', 'learning', 'moves', 'get', 'workout', 'con', 'do', 'not', 'emphasize', 'going', 'up', 'toes', 'one', 'do', 'emphasize', 'turning', 'toes', 'out', 'good', 'form', 'possibly', 'avoid', 'injuring', 'moves', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'interested', 'gaining', 'flexibility', 'strain', 'trying', 'not', 'use', 'knees', 'train', 'hips', 'legs', 'feet', 'instead', 'focus', 'there', 'not', 'getting', 'workout']",N/A

I've done yoga, Pilates, belly dance, aerobic dance, but really, nothing compares to ballet for gaining the strength and muscle control I'm looking for.Melissa Lowe is a good teacher. Her voice is pleasant, and her descriptions of movements were very precise, complete, and not at all redundant. As a beginner-level adult, I needed that level of explanation so I could execute movements correctly without injury.Some things, like Ms. Lowe's stage makeup and poker face may seem jarring to the 21st century viewer, but keep in mind that this tape was produced in 1983, one of the very first dance instruction videos, before teachers had much collective experience before a video camera.For me, the moves are difficult to execute, even at the tape's &quot;beginner level&quot;, perhaps because of my age and inherent lack of flexibility. I would have appreciated being able to see what the exercises look like when executed correctly, although the dancer cannot yet achieve complete turnout or raise the leg fully.
