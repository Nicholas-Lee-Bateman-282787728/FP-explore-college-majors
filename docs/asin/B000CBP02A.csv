955990,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000CBP02A,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 6]","'The Gospel' is not a music extravaganza with a story tacked on.  Nor is it the opposite.  It has a good story with fine gospel music added intermitently throughout.  Both aspects complement one another, and the whole experience is uplifting.  The acting is decent, neither over the top nor Oscar caliber, but everyone makes it an authentic experience all the same.The story is one of redemption.  David Taylor (Boris Kodjoe) rushes to the side of his dying mother in a hospital while he is begging God to spare her life.  She is unconscious, but passes away under his watch.  His father, a minister, shows up after the fact, tardy because he was at a bible conference.  David is bitter at God and his earthly father, so he takes a different track in life.  Moving from his native Atlanta to Los Angeles, he finds all the trappings that the secular world has to offer.  Money, fame, music, and women enrapture him as he becomes a rap star.  He seems comfortable although it isn't perfect.  He starts to lock heads with a fellow artist who claims contract privileges with his music.  The street wiseness puts in a minor damper and a bit of fisticuffs for David.  That is until his own father's health starts to fail... Then, David interrupts everthing, including a contractual tour, to go home and investigate.  One of the best aspects of the movie is how it demonstrates the disparity between the faithful and the wayward.  It isn't all clear cut.  The church members aren't all judgmental hypocrites, and the sinners aren't all noble and wrongly maligned.  Rather, we see the skeptical reactions as the son of a preacher comes home to try and heal divisions of his father's church.  Understandably, many don't take him seriously when his biggest hit is ""I'll Try to Undress You"".  Bridging the gap, he falls in love with a regular attendee, but he quickly learns that being on the prowl doesn't work with this church woman.  Similarly, as David responds to his father's ailing health and the need for a new church, he also changes.  His priorities become new and different.  The movie plausibly and likably show how relationships change as his father is dying and his successor takes over the church.  The way they resolve the plot is worth the time to see ""The Gospel"".Perhaps the most compelling reason most see the movie is the inspiration.  The music is uplifting, and the camera angles showcase a splendid jamboree.  I think there is a temptation to think of this movie as a slightly glorified made-for-tv project, but the editing and the splendour of the church singing beg for a labored response.

Meanwhile, the Bishop's close-like-a-son right-hand man, Reverend Charles Frank (Idris Elba), stews over these developments.  [In the interim, David was out putting together an Usher-styled R&B; career, shepherded by a manager played by Omar Gooding.]The acting is very uneven - there are some novices. A pro like Elba (who's earned major chops inThe Wire - The Complete First SeasonandSometimes in April)) simply blows the doors off the others whenever he's on screen.  Plus, Kodjoe is clearly lip-synching.  Here's there simply because he looks great doing it.  Behind the scenes, credit goes to Atlanta-area singer Greg Kirkland (he's in the credits).The music is worth three stars alone.

Regardless of your musical interests, I think you will enjoy the songs.""The Gospel"" has been labled a modern version of The Prodigal Son--it is that and more as we see the pastor's son torn between secular success and salvation at home in the church, and we see a young, fresh pastor decide whether he is going to work for his name or God's name.  There are tensions between the sexes, between friends, between fellow ministers, and especially between a man's will and the will of God.I didn't know anything about this movie before renting it, but I am truly proud of the people who made it and acted in it for presenting such a profound version of the gospel.

955999,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000CBP02A,Dorrie Wheeler,"[19, 19]","The Gospel, one of the most exciting movies ever released about the black church, is now available on DVD. Boris Kodjoe (Soulfood), stars as David Taylor. David, the son of a popular minister, leaves the church after the untimely death of his mother and goes on to be a successful R&B; singer. After his father, portrayed by popular character actor Clifton Powell, becomes ill, David returns to the fold of the family church which is in financial crisis. Not everyone is glad to see David return. Some members of the church, particularly his former childhood friend, Reverend Charles Frank, don't know if it's such a good idea to have a well known secular singer in the fold. David finds himself comfortable back in the church and implements his ideas into rejuvenating the congregation. In addition to his new role with the church David also finds love with a church member named Rain (Tamyra Gray). David's manager Wesley, (Omar Gooding), spends his time trying to get his artist back into the lifestyle they have become accustomed to and back on the road.The Gospel is an excellent film and includes cameos from some of the biggest names in gospel music including Fred Hammond, Donnie McClurkin, and Yolanda Adams. Despite the big names that have small roles in the film, it's the newcomers such as former American Idol contestant Tamarya Gray and Idris Elba who offer surprisingly good performances. Boris Kodjoe also shows and proves that he is much more than just a pretty face with his performance in The Gospel.There were just a few little things about the movie that irked me.  Oscar, Tamarya Grays other love interest was always shown in his uniform for the most part.  As a military spouse, I think it's a bit odd that they showed Oscar in his uniform so much even when he wasn't working.  Also, there was an underlying storyline of strife/sexual dysfunction between the Nona Gaye character and her husband Reverend Charles Frank.  This storyline wasn't well developed.  Other than those two things it's a great film.DVD Special Features-Filmmakers Commentary-Deleted Scenes-Making-Of Featurette-Extended Musical Performances-Photo Montage",5,An exciting film about the church,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,2150,"['Gospel', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'movies', 'ever', 'released', 'black', 'church', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'Boris', 'Kodjoe', 'Soulfood', 'David', 'Taylor', 'David', 'son', 'popular', 'minister', 'church', 'untimely', 'death', 'mother', 'be', 'successful', 'R', 'B', 'singer', 'father', 'portrayed', 'popular', 'character', 'actor', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'ill', 'David', 'fold', 'family', 'church', 'financial', 'crisis', 'Not', 'everyone', 'glad', 'see', 'David', 'return', 'members', 'church', 'particularly', 'former', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Reverend', 'Charles', 'Frank', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'such', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'well', 'known', 'secular', 'singer', 'fold', 'David', 'comfortable', 'back', 'church', 'implements', 'ideas', 'rejuvenating', 'congregation', 'addition', 'new', 'role', 'church', 'David', 'also', 'love', 'church', 'member', 'named', 'Rain', 'Tamyra', 'Gray', 'David', 'manager', 'Wesley', 'Omar', 'Gooding', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'artist', 'back', 'lifestyle', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'back', 'road.The', 'Gospel', 'excellent', 'film', 'cameos', 'biggest', 'names', 'gospel', 'music', 'including', 'Fred', 'Hammond', 'Donnie', 'McClurkin', 'Yolanda', 'Adams', 'big', 'names', 'have', 'small', 'roles', 'film', 'newcomers', 'such', 'former', 'American', 'Idol', 'contestant', 'Tamarya', 'Gray', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'who', 'offer', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performances', 'Boris', 'Kodjoe', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'performance', 'Gospel.There', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'little', 'things', 'movie', 'irked', 'Oscar', 'Tamarya', 'Grays', 'other', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'always', 'shown', 'uniform', 'most', 'part', 'military', 'spouse', 'think', 'bit', 'odd', 'showed', 'Oscar', 'uniform', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'Also', 'was', 'underlying', 'storyline', 'strife/sexual', 'dysfunction', 'Nona', 'Gaye', 'character', 'husband', 'Reverend', 'Charles', 'Frank', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'developed', 'Other', 'two', 'things', 'great', 'film.DVD', 'Special', 'Features-Filmmakers', 'Commentary-Deleted', 'Scenes-Making-Of', 'Featurette-Extended', 'Musical', 'Performances-Photo', 'Montage']",N/A

The 'other' son has inherited the mantle of the bishop with special interests deflecting his commitment to the bishop's origins and the Prodigal Son finally finds acceptance in offering his talents to further the original dream of his father.The movie contains good snippets of music from ensemble choirs and well-known gospel singers. The movie had a plot with these songs intertwined, yet because the songs were kept short, it did not overload the movie with music. (However, if you are a gospel music lover, I think you'll still be pleased.) Yes, some may write it off as predictable, and a bit sappy, but that's also what got me about it. The movie speaks to you without feeling like it's preaching to youThe script is conversationally pedestrian but the actors did their best to make credible characters.

The son who turns his back on the church and his family is David Taylor, played by Boris Kodjoe. The son of a pastor he loses his faith when his mother dies feeling that God and his father let him down. He and his best friend Charles Frank played by Idris Elba were both studying to become reverends.David leaves and we jump forward fifteen years, and becomes a very popular secular singing idol. We see his decadent life style where he wants for nothing. But then he gets a call that his father is ill and he heads back home. His father is played well by Clifton Powell. And by this time his best friend Charles is a self-centered egocentric man that is using the church to try and promote himself. The real story is to give us a look inside of black church society and at the same time it is a story of redemption for both of these young men. The gospel music does add to the film. It changes along with the times and what is transpiring within the church community.So we have a low budget film about morality, faith, hope and recovery with some good original gospel music.

956011,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000CBP02A,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[10, 11]","The Gospel tells a simple story that doesn't twist and turn, but rather falls naturally from the believable characters created in Rob Hardy's screenplay and under his direction.  Hardy has wisely filled his movie with absolutely glorious Gospel music created by electrifying choirs and real Gospel greats like Fred Hammond and Yolanda Adams.  The movie is never more than one scene away from one with glorious music and as soon as I finish this review I'm going to order the soundtrack.The story is not difficult to follow.  Clifton Powell as Bishop Fred Taylor has built a thriving church in Atlanta, and he is a devoted Pastor.  So devoted that his son leaves home as a young man when the Bishop's wife passes away while the Bishop is conducting church services.  In the opening scene we see the son, David, telling the Bishop ""I hate you.  You always have time for the church, but you never have time for us"", on his way out of the hospital.15 years later we see that David Taylor has become a hip-hop singer right on the cusp of megastardom.  He's played by Boris Kodjoe as a handsome, brooding man.  He has a manager, played by Omar Gooding (with more than a slight resemblance to older brother Cuba) named Wesley who keeps ""D.T."" supplied with gigs and women.  David gets a phone call from his father's secretary, Ernestine (played by Aloma Wright), who tells him that the Bishop has become ill and could David come home.Against Wesley's wishes, David interrupts his tour as it's gaining momentum to return to the church, where he finds his teenaged friend Charles Frank has become a Reverend as well - associate pastor to the Bishop, married to his cousin Charlene, and the heir apparent to the church.The Reverend Charles Frank is an arrogant man who is quick with a discouraging word for his wife.  Another associate, Minister Hunter (played well by singer Donnie McClurkin), can't understand when the Bishop decides to turn the pulpit over to the brash Reverend Frank, but agrees to stay with the church at the request of the Bishop.This is the part of the movie that builds sympathy for wayward son David, who returns home with different eyes and sees the noble, charitable work that his father has been doing for decades.  He accompanies his father to a retirement home where he's told that the Bishop always comes, at least twice a week, even though everyone there knows he doesn't have time for it.The movie builds as a battle between the worldly David, who returns home as the performer of sexy secular songs, but builds in determination to not lose the legacy of his father, and Reverend Frank, who ""stayed true"" to the church and the Bishop, but now seems to have lost the vision of anything except himself in the church spotlight.By the end of the film the words and body language of all the characters are that ""it's all good"", and that the strife that has filled the hour and a half preceding is resolved.  We know that real life doesn't work that quickly, but we can believe that in real life, it may work out just as well.  The music helps.  It's reassuring to see a mainstream film made about people of faith and their real-world struggles.  If not for the fact that the final scene seems out of place with several rapid ""changes of heart"" I'd give the film 5 stars.  As it is, it's well worth your time - I'd say mandatory if you want to hear some glorious gospel music.",5,The Prodigal Son retold with Great Gospel Music,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3394,"['Gospel', 'simple', 'story', ""n't"", 'twist', 'turn', 'rather', 'naturally', 'believable', 'characters', 'created', 'Rob', 'Hardy', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'Hardy', 'wisely', 'filled', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'glorious', 'Gospel', 'music', 'created', 'electrifying', 'choirs', 'real', 'Gospel', 'greats', 'Fred', 'Hammond', 'Yolanda', 'Adams', 'movie', 'never', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'away', 'one', 'glorious', 'music', 'as', 'soon', 'finish', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'order', 'soundtrack.The', 'story', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Bishop', 'Fred', 'Taylor', 'built', 'thriving', 'church', 'Atlanta', 'devoted', 'Pastor', 'So', 'devoted', 'son', 'home', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'Bishop', 'wife', 'away', 'Bishop', 'conducting', 'church', 'services', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'son', 'David', 'telling', 'Bishop', 'hate', 'always', 'have', 'time', 'church', 'never', 'have', 'time', 'way', 'hospital.15', 'years', 'later', 'see', 'David', 'Taylor', 'become', 'hip-hop', 'singer', 'right', 'cusp', 'megastardom', 'played', 'Boris', 'Kodjoe', 'handsome', 'brooding', 'man', 'manager', 'played', 'Omar', 'Gooding', 'more', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'older', 'brother', 'Cuba', 'named', 'Wesley', 'who', 'D.T', 'supplied', 'gigs', 'women', 'David', 'phone', 'call', 'father', 'secretary', 'Ernestine', 'played', 'Aloma', 'Wright', 'who', 'Bishop', 'become', 'ill', 'could', 'David', 'come', 'home.Against', 'Wesley', 'wishes', 'David', 'tour', 'gaining', 'momentum', 'return', 'church', 'where', 'teenaged', 'friend', 'Charles', 'Frank', 'become', 'Reverend', 'as', 'well', 'associate', 'pastor', 'Bishop', 'married', 'cousin', 'Charlene', 'heir', 'apparent', 'church.The', 'Reverend', 'Charles', 'Frank', 'arrogant', 'man', 'who', 'quick', 'discouraging', 'word', 'wife', 'associate', 'Minister', 'Hunter', 'played', 'well', 'singer', 'Donnie', 'McClurkin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'when', 'Bishop', 'turn', 'pulpit', 'brash', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'stay', 'church', 'request', 'Bishop.This', 'part', 'movie', 'sympathy', 'wayward', 'son', 'David', 'who', 'home', 'different', 'eyes', 'noble', 'charitable', 'work', 'father', 'been', 'doing', 'decades', 'father', 'retirement', 'home', 'where', 'told', 'Bishop', 'always', 'least', 'twice', 'week', 'even', 'everyone', 'there', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'it.The', 'movie', 'builds', 'battle', 'worldly', 'David', 'who', 'home', 'performer', 'sexy', 'secular', 'songs', 'builds', 'determination', 'not', 'lose', 'legacy', 'father', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'who', 'stayed', 'true', 'church', 'Bishop', 'now', 'have', 'lost', 'vision', 'anything', 'church', 'spotlight.By', 'end', 'film', 'words', 'body', 'language', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'strife', 'filled', 'hour', 'half', 'preceding', 'resolved', 'know', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'work', 'quickly', 'can', 'believe', 'real', 'life', 'may', 'work', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'reassuring', 'see', 'mainstream', 'film', 'made', 'people', 'faith', 'real-world', 'struggles', 'not', 'fact', 'final', 'scene', 'place', 'several', 'rapid', 'changes', 'heart', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'well', 'time', ""'d"", 'say', 'mandatory', 'want', 'hear', 'glorious', 'gospel', 'music']",N/A
