1655615,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DHSDMPC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 12]","With our never ending fascination with the Royal Family, there is certainly no shortage of information to be found on the DVD market.  ""Born to Royalty"" is a rather opportunistic special that runs about 1 hour and 15 minutes and was timed to coincide with the birth of the new Prince.  Mind you, it isn't about the new Prince, per se, but about how child rearing has evolved over the decades in relationship to the Royal Family.  Experts weigh in on matters both historical and contemporary and the focus is on famous personalities when they were children.  From the tumultuous relationship that King George VI had with his father to the bold independence of Elizabeth (and her protectiveness of Margaret), the special covers stories that aren't particularly earth shattering with new revelations but they are quite interesting.  We also get tidbits about Charles and Anne, William and Harry, and much speculation about the newest Royal (who I don't think was even named when this was pushed to market).As with many of these specials, the ""experts"" don't seem especially close to the subjects.  There is a historian, a photographer, and a couple of others with a tenuous connection to the family.  For the most part, they relay stories that they've heard and engage in speculation based on their personal beliefs.  It always make me slightly uncomfortable for outsiders to act as authorities on matters of such intimacy, but all had a clear enthusiasm for the subject.  Nothing scandalous is presented here.  If you are an enthusiast on the subject, there may be nothing new either.  I wasn't expecting much from this DVD release, in case you couldn't tell, but it is actually well structured and briskly entertaining.For those looking for a more modern twist, there is a brief profile of William and Kate and how each grew up (and how that might influence them as parents).  Kate gets an inevitable comparison to Diana, and their indoctrination as Royals is paralleled.  The piece is narrated by Hugh Bonneville of ""Downton Abbey"" with efficiency.  Again, this won't reveal much in the way of new information.  But I thought it was a solid profile that I actually liked.  I particularly thought some of the stuff about young Elizabeth was of interest.  If you're obsessed with the Royal family, this is certainly better than some of the material available!

1655620,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00DHSDMPC,Z Hayes,"[5, 6]","My mother is a great fan of British royalty and I admit I inherited a little of her fascination for all things British royalty. It was a happy day reading that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, i.e. William and Kate had become new parents to  bouncing baby boy, Prince George. This DVD does not focus on the new royal baby, but instead takes a look at the world into which royal children past and present have been brought up in, with lots of archival footage that should delight fans of British royalty.""In 1948, Prince Charles was born in a Buckingham Palace bathroom which had been converted into a royal operating theater."" Now that is a peppy little anecdote for you! Interviews with royal watchers such as royal biographer Ingrid Seward reveals how Charles' imminent arrival was an anxious time for Prince Philip, husband of then Princess Elizabeth, who would in a few years, ascend the throne of England and become Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Archival footage shows the infant Charles surrounded by his eight sponsors, including his uncle Edward, who had infamously abdicated the throne of England for love of Wallis Simpson.The press is portrayed as being respectful and mindful of the Royals' need for privacy back when Charles and his siblings were being raised, but the documentary also shows how things have drastically changed since then, especially since the birth of Prince William, followed by Harry. The show makes a point of connecting this to the pressures that William and Catherine (Kate Middleton) will face as they raise Prince George. The glare of publicity is a given, and the question is, how will they manage this while giving George a semblance of a 'normal' upbringing?The documentary then moves on to analyzing a succession of British monarchs such as George V, and how these monarchs approached parenting, mainly traditional. Imagine being a royal infant or toddler and only being presented to one's parents, i.e. the King and Queen, for about an hour each day, while at tea! This distant parenting style impacted the personalities of royal children, and was especially significant in the case of Bertie (George VI) who had always been overshadowed by his older, more glamorous and confident brother Edward. When Bertie married Elizabeth and the pair became parents, they balked at the traditional parenting style favored by their parents and instead became more engaged parents to Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. But even then, the young Princesses were often accompanied by a succession of nannies and governesses, and young Elizabeth did not really have any real playmates except for her sister Margaret.I found the insights on royal child-rearing to be interesting and helpful in discerning the personalities of many members of the British royal family. It is obvious that the parenting of royal children has undergone many changes, from a more distant and traditional upbringing to more modern approaches as practiced by the late Princess of Wales, Diana. Now with Prince William and Princess Catherine as new royal parents, it will be interesting to see the way they approach parenting, and how this impacts the royal family and how it is perceived among the public. From what I've read so far, it appears they favor the hands-on method and look as though they will be highly engaged and involved parents.The DVD runs 75 minutes, in color and B&W; (when featuring archival footage), with the option of English subtitles, and is Region 1.
