Not Only but Also is a classic live sketch show staring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.  The first two series (1965-1966) were live in front of an audience in black and white.  The last series is mostly filmed segments, but still great stuff!  The reason full episodes aren't part of this is someone at the BBC accidentally erased some of the original elements.  So (as the title says) this is what's left.  Most importantly, there were two cameos by John Lennon and these should be included on here.

1164385,A20UJP1JSTIOL6,B0019MFY2M,artanis65,"[1, 1]","This British comedy sketch show from the 1960's is smart, occasionally surreal and always entertaining.  I started watching this with low expectations.  I usually don't get British humor. I thought the movie Peter Cook and Dudley Moore made together, ""Bedazzled"", was clever but only sporadically amusing.  Monty Python is hit or miss for me (mostly miss).  But this seems to hit my comedy sweet spot.  Both Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were born in the 1930's and their cultural tastes (and cultural references) were markedly pre-baby boom.  Their comedy is refreshingly unpolitical, and while it may have been moderately edgy on 1960's tv, it's not trying to challenge you or insult you or make you see the world in a different way; it's only trying make you laugh.  These were not angry guys.Moore and Cook play brilliantly off one another.  The best skits of all are probably those with the rather dim characters Pete and Dud, all of which are uniformly excellent and laugh out loud funny.  One thing that makes me think the show was aimed at adults are the musical interludes.  Dudley Moore was an excellent pianist, and his straight ahead jazz trio made several appearances.  His duet with vocalist Marian Montgomery, a great singer, on ""Close Your Eyes"" is especially wonderful.Very highly recommended for fans of classy comedy and also for fans of adult pop/jazz music.",5,funny and witty with a touch of genius,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,1376,"['British', 'comedy', 'sketch', 'show', '1960', 'smart', 'occasionally', 'surreal', 'always', 'entertaining', 'started', 'watching', 'low', 'expectations', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'British', 'humor', 'thought', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'made', 'together', 'Bedazzled', 'was', 'clever', 'only', 'sporadically', 'amusing', 'Monty', 'Python', 'hit', 'miss', 'mostly', 'miss', 'hit', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'spot', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'were', 'born', '1930', 'cultural', 'tastes', 'cultural', 'references', 'were', 'markedly', 'pre-baby', 'boom', 'comedy', 'refreshingly', 'unpolitical', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'moderately', 'edgy', '1960', 'tv', 'not', 'trying', 'challenge', 'insult', 'make', 'see', 'world', 'different', 'way', 'only', 'trying', 'make', 'laugh', 'were', 'not', 'angry', 'guys.Moore', 'Cook', 'play', 'brilliantly', 'one', 'best', 'skits', 'are', 'probably', 'rather', 'dim', 'characters', 'Pete', 'Dud', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'One', 'thing', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'aimed', 'adults', 'are', 'musical', 'interludes', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'was', 'excellent', 'pianist', 'straight', 'ahead', 'jazz', 'trio', 'made', 'several', 'appearances', 'duet', 'vocalist', 'Marian', 'Montgomery', 'great', 'singer', 'Close', 'Eyes', 'especially', 'wonderful.Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'classy', 'comedy', 'also', 'fans', 'adult', 'pop/jazz', 'music']",Peter Cook & Dudley Moore: The Best of...

It was a greatest hits compilation of the few sketches that remained of the show.  This DVD takes a different approach and re-creates six episodes.Working from memory it looks as if all the material from the videotape has been included here EXCEPT for the Pete & Dud reunion sketch they recorded for the release of the video.  The sketch is short, not terribly great, but it was nice to see the two of them together again.  That's the reason for my four star review instead of five; that sketch should have been included here.Having said that what's here is quite good.  All of their most famous sketches from the series are here (nuns on trampolines, a handful of Pete & Dud sketches, Superthunderstingcar, Peter as Garbo, teaching ravens to fly underwater, Peter as a dad having a sex talk with his boy Dudley) and it's a lot of fun.  A bit less fun are the jazz trio pieces and the female singers that occasionally perform with them.  There's also a somewhat interesting bonus feature entitled 'Success Story' that includes some nice clips (One Leg Too Few) and an interview with the boys from the 1970s.All in all it's great slice of mid-60s British sketch comedy.  Although Monty Python would come along in a few short years and destroy this format, there's something very sweet, silly and ultimately quite satisfying about Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.Don't hesitate to pick up this DVD and if you enjoy it then immediately head for the 'Beyond The Fringe' disc as well.

This series of live comedy sketches played across America under the name Good Evening. Every sketch was brilliantly funny and that the Vinyl disc has not become available as a DVD is an error bordering on tragic.The Best of... What's Left of is a title reflecting, perhaps too much truth. Mostly these are very clever sketches. Even more than a generation later the timing works and the punch lines deliver. The sketches are not quite up to the quality of the later stage show but at least this DVD allows America to see two very funny men were known to America as having been cute. What the DVD delivers that the stage show did not is a lovely sample of the many musical skills of Dudley Moore. The regular appearance of his jazz trio demonstrates him as a smooth and confident small jazz club style musician. The large scale brilliantly satirical comedic take on Beethoven displays Dudley Moore's inventive musical side. The Beethoven version of Why Why Why Delilah is a comedic delight.The deadpan, vaguely scholarly speeches and spot on improvisations of Peter Cook routinely convert a highly focused Dudley Moore into the giggling sidekick. As a team their middle class and not strictly speaking Cockney, characters Pete and Dud deliver wonderful byplay with the museum's scetch's ending producing  probably the biggest laugh on the  disk. There is a surprise appearance of a very young John Lennon in a sketch wherein they jointly perform a comedic video to illustrate and otherwise odd John Lennon poem. That a star of John Lennon's caliber would have appeared on the show was proof both of a personal relationship and of the fact that the two comedians were a bigger draw than BBC understood.Even though the roughly 6 programs presented on this DVD represent a cobbling together of the remaining bits and bobs of several programs there remains a certain consistency that belies the patch together truth. Shortly after the end of the American and Australian tours of Good Evening Cook and Moore  would split up. Both would have a certain degree of success with American Hollywood movies and both would die way too soon. As good as The Best of What's Left of... Is it is no more than a sampling of with this team was capable of doing. One can only hope that Good Evening will manage to make the leap into DVD.",4,A taste of just how funny Peter Cook and Dudley Moore really were,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,2444,"['70s', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Tony', 'award-winning', 'stage', 'production', 'comedy', 'duo', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'series', 'live', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'played', 'America', 'name', 'Good', 'Evening', 'Every', 'sketch', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'Vinyl', 'disc', 'not', 'become', 'available', 'DVD', 'error', 'bordering', 'tragic.The', 'Best', 'What', 'Left', 'title', 'reflecting', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'truth', 'Mostly', 'are', 'very', 'clever', 'sketches', 'Even', 'more', 'generation', 'later', 'timing', 'works', 'punch', 'lines', 'deliver', 'sketches', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'quality', 'later', 'stage', 'show', 'least', 'DVD', 'America', 'see', 'two', 'very', 'funny', 'men', 'were', 'known', 'America', 'having', 'been', 'cute', 'What', 'DVD', 'delivers', 'stage', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'lovely', 'sample', 'many', 'musical', 'skills', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'regular', 'appearance', 'jazz', 'trio', 'smooth', 'confident', 'small', 'jazz', 'club', 'style', 'musician', 'large', 'scale', 'brilliantly', 'satirical', 'comedic', 'take', 'Beethoven', 'displays', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'inventive', 'musical', 'side', 'Beethoven', 'version', 'Why', 'Why', 'Why', 'Delilah', 'comedic', 'delight.The', 'deadpan', 'vaguely', 'scholarly', 'speeches', 'spot', 'improvisations', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'routinely', 'convert', 'highly', 'focused', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'giggling', 'sidekick', 'team', 'middle', 'class', 'not', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'Cockney', 'characters', 'Pete', 'Dud', 'deliver', 'wonderful', 'byplay', 'museum', 'scetch', 'ending', 'producing', 'probably', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'disk', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'very', 'young', 'John', 'Lennon', 'sketch', 'wherein', 'jointly', 'perform', 'comedic', 'video', 'illustrate', 'otherwise', 'odd', 'John', 'Lennon', 'poem', 'star', 'John', 'Lennon', 'caliber', 'would', 'have', 'appeared', 'show', 'was', 'proof', 'personal', 'relationship', 'fact', 'two', 'comedians', 'were', 'bigger', 'draw', 'BBC', 'understood.Even', 'roughly', '6', 'programs', 'presented', 'DVD', 'represent', 'cobbling', 'together', 'remaining', 'bits', 'bobs', 'several', 'programs', 'certain', 'consistency', 'patch', 'together', 'truth', 'Shortly', 'end', 'American', 'Australian', 'tours', 'Good', 'Evening', 'Cook', 'Moore', 'would', 'split', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'certain', 'degree', 'success', 'American', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'would', 'die', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'As', 'good', 'Best', 'What', 'Left', 'more', 'sampling', 'team', 'was', 'capable', 'doing', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Good', 'Evening', 'will', 'manage', 'make', 'leap', 'DVD']",Peter Cook & Dudley Moore: The Best of...
