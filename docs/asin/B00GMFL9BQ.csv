1678907,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00GMFL9BQ,ahoffoss,"[1, 1]","Ok,...for some reason, the whole ""Bachelor party"" story line continues to get used in movies. Why?! I'm not really sure, but here is another one to add to the list. I honestly didn't even know this film existed until yesterday, so I went straight home after work and watched it. If you've seen the 2nd (and I'm assuming you have, since you're looking at the 3rd installment), then you won't be disappointed, as the 2nd was completely atrocious! This one, unfortunately, is equally as bad! How they conned Sean Astin into this movie is beyond my comprehension, but somehow they managed to and I must say,...he is about the only reason this doesn't get a single star rating. He plays the role as if he were in another one of this big budget titles! Fantastic actor, that guy! The others?...eh,..not so much.*******WARNING,....I'm going to completely RUIN this movie from here on*******This movie, for me, was kinda confusing in various parts. The actors all tend to blend together and it was difficult for me to tell one C-lister from the next. That being said, this movie takes place somewhere in the Caribbean. There's a wedding going on and for Marcus (Mitch Ryan), it's his last day as a bachelor. What better way to celebrate then the hire a ridiculously LARGE boat and sail to an uninhabited remote island?! Yeah, you get the picture. Anyways, Marcus is marrying into a VERY wealthy family and his brother, Josh (Brando Eaton) and his girlfriend, Penny (Jillian Murrey), along with lifelong friend and business partner, Dobs (Ryan Donowho) want to take his to an island in the Caribbean for a night of drinking and partying. (although how you party with just 2 dudes and one's girlfriend, I'm not sure?!). That being said,...what woman is even remotely likely to allow her fiance to go ""party"" with another girl. And who brings their girlfriend to a bachelor party?! Regardless,...they get a boat (which is FAR beyond their means of expense) and head out to what they refer to as a ""virgin beach"". Yeah. On the way they gift Marcus with a ridiculously large sex toy. Again,...yeah. We also, at this point, discover that Penny and Marcus once hooked up. I'm pretty sure they shot this scene just to get some nudity in the movie. As they approach the ""virgin beach"" they notice a building located on the shore. Hey, what the heck?! Let's go anyways!Now we're in a science lab. With the exception of Dr. Edwards (Currie Graham), the ""scientists"" all appear to be in their Freshmen year of college as they can't be older then 20. They have discovered some type of flesh eating virus and have quarantined it's only survivor, Porter (Sean Astin). Porter is immune to the disease and Dr. Edwards is intent on extracting a cure. At least, I think this is what is going on? They hold Porter against his will and administer tests on him until he decides to take matters into his own hands (literally!). He cuts his hand open and as a scientist enters his area, rips his suit off and forces his blood into the poor guy's face. This causes a mandatory evacuation period of 48 hours. All the scientist, except Dr. Edwards, Camila (Solly Duran), and Bridget (Lydia), are send into another building in quarantine.Back to the bachelor party! They make it to the beach and Josh and Emily decide to go snorkeling. Of course, Marcus and Dobs decide to stay on the beach and get high instead (cause you totally can't do THAT at home!). After being in the water, Josh and Emily discover a massive graveyard of fish on the bottom of the ocean floor. Disgusted, Emily rushes back to the beach. This is when the ""Fever"" begins. Emily quickly notices a rash forming on her arm and heads into the tent (which miraculously gets erected). As Josh gets called in to help with the situation he begins to notice a rash starting on his neck. He chalks it up to the weed they smoked and decides this is the perfect time to bang his girlfriend. Somehow, even with a multiple blisters and burning skin, she's up for it. Not only that, but she pushes him down to receive some oral pleasure. Now, I'm not expert,....but this girl as MASSIVE blisters ALL over her body,.....I mean, ALL OVER HER BODY, and this guy doesn't see anything wrong with that?! Gross. Regardless, I took it as sort of a ripoff of the ""finger"" scene from the original. Of course, you know what happens next. He rises up looking like he just got first place in a cherry pie eating contest and she pukes some sort of stuff all over him. Yummy! This cause Josh to rush out in a mad panic and start looking for help. Marcus and Dobs then remember the abandoned building and head for help.This is where I start to get confused,...and again, maybe it was just me?! Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention, or something, but they find themselves eventually inside the building. Dobs gets spooked after discovering an axe lodged in some equipment and blood on the table and accidentally engages the buildings locking system, barring the windows and exits. Instead of hacking through them they do what any other genius would and venture further into the remains eventually stumbling upon a kitchen and what appears to have been a massacre. After searching for a while, they are approached by a bloody mess that can only be a survivor of the outbreak, so they rush into the next room and lock the door. Too bad the next room if filled with bodies. After one of the bodies comes to life, Dobs quickly rushes back and locks Marcus in. Some friend?! Marcus takes care of business (since he still has the axe) while Dobs is nearly shot to death by the previous survivor. The only thing that saves Dobs (and this is actually how it happens), the scientists, while firing a shot, has his hand broken off at the wrist. This causes his hand to fly directly at his face and the gun to jam directly into his skull. And dead. Wow,....Who thought that would be cool? Stupid. Somehow (again, maybe I wasn't paying attention,..I WAS eating some delicious food at the time) both Marcus and Dobs end up outside again and are met by Josh (who's virus is quickly spreading). Josh has since made contact with Dr. Edwards and was told to come to the building. Dobs then pushes ONE BUTTON and manages to get the security door open. Convenient. They rush in looking for Dr. Edwards and are met by Bridget.(Now, in a previous scene, Bridget is helping Dr. Edwards with the poor guy Porter infected when the guy pukes in her face causing HER to contract the disease.)So here we are. Bridget talks to the 3 and tells them to follow her only to be put on the spot by Camilla. Camilla forces Bridget to reveal her face so the guys can see she's not well. Bridget says she can help with Penny, however, so she and Josh head out, leaving Camilla, Marcus, and Dobs. On the way, Josh tells Bridget about the boat they have, so she smacks him in the head and runs for it. She is stopped by Penny, who questions her. Now,...this is another one of those ""what were they thinking?!"" scenes. Bridget and Penny get into a fight. And who WOULDN'T feel like fighting?! They both are on the verge of death, but are somehow battling as if they were on the set of Game of Thrones. The fight is concluded when Penny smashes Bridget's face in with the GIANT dildo that was given to Marcus earlier in the movie. Again,...why they took they time to bring THAT with them to the beach, I have NO idea!Back in the science lab (that for some reason or another has a huge, illuminated billboard sign above it - because nothing says secret research facility like a giant, lit-up billboard sign), Camilla, Marcus, and Dobs meet up with Dr. Edwards and Portor. After an argument, Dr. Edwards makes his escape. Dobs chases him and Marcus and Camilla stay with Porter. Dr. Edwards makes it nearly all the way to the beach before being confronted by Dobs. He tells Dobs that he can help him with the illness (Dobs has since contracted the infection as well). Of course, Dobs agrees and Dr. Edwards punches him in the face, steals his gun, and kills him. So much for Dobs.Marcus and Camilla release Porter and initiate the ""self destruction"" sequence. Yes,...the building actually IS equipped with a self destruction sequence. They make a run for in and stumble upon Dr. Edwards. He makes a plea to Marcus and Camilla, I don't know something about how they can be rich, somehow or another, but Porter ends the argument with a poorly aimed shot at the Docs neck. And see ya, Dr. Edwards!The next scene appears and they're somehow back on that nice yacht. Porter gets both Marcus and Camilla water and locks them inside. After discovering he put his blood into it they try to get out and can't,...thus ending the movie.Fortunately during the credits, scenes play out to let you know how most of Porter's actions were accomplished. But doesn't do too much to properly explain why?So there you have it. Another poor excuse for a ""horror"" flick and yet another punch in Eli Roth's face. For a series that started off so awesome, they have done such a poor job with it. They have everything they need to make a cool flick except for the correct story. The only way to bring this series back to life is to have Eli Roth come in an take over. The movie, in itself, is watchable. Albeit, RIDICULOUS, but watchable. I wouldn't bother ever watching it again.FINAL VERDICT:  WAIT FOR IT ON TBS!  It is mildly entertaining at times, but only if you're not actually paying to see it.[...]",2,Bachelor parties NEVER work out in movies?!,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,9445,"['Ok', 'reason', 'whole',
