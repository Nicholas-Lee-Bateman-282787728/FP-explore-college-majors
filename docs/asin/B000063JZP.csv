He wants to be more like the heroes in the comics he reads, particularly the Arachnid Avenger.  The lab he works at just happens to be working with spiders.

It makes Larry Cohen (It's Alive, Q) look like a music video director on methamphetamine. It makes Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies) look like Michael Bay (Armageddon).Director Scott Ziehl has a pretty good story idea to work with (What would happen if Spiderman took on the other spider attributes after his radioactive bite. You know extra legs, a thirst for human blood) and seems afraid to get to the obvious. Instead we have endless tangents about a cop that lost his nerve (Dan Ackroyd) and his alcoholic cheating wife(Theresa Russell).Not just is this like skipping the shark attacks in Jaws to show an affair between the marine biologist and Mrs. Brody. But both Ackroyd and Russell are simply awful in their respective roles.Add in a surprising amount of community theater level supporting work and a boring love interest. And Earth vs. The Spider gives us nothing to hold our interest. (In true comic book geek tradition our hero gets nothing but a chaste kiss. Needless to say there is no nudity gratuitous or otherwise. Kind of a surprise from a made for Showtime horror film.)The movie, of course, has nothing to do with the pretty good monster movie from the fifties that share its name. And as a Spiderman parody Spiderbabe, a Misty Mundae soft-core porn film of all things, upstages it. The monster/superhero does make an appearance in the final ten minutes but I was really to bored to care and director Ziehl was still wrapping up boring love triangles instead of focusing on the good stuff.Indeed if someone ever makes a Dogma 95 superhero movie I expect it to look like this.",1,Earth vs. the Spider...

695323,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000063JZP,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 5]","The B-horror movie seems to be in vogue.  For a long time we were inundated with huge, expensive blockbusters, of which I need provide no examples as there are so many.  However, a number of recent releases proves that the B-movie, the staple of the drive-in theater, is not dead.In a variation on the ""Spiderman"" theme, nerdy Quentin Kemmer (David Summersall) dreams of being a superhero.  Working at a biotech facility, Quentin has an opportunity to inject himself with a serum that gives Quentin the powers of a spider.  Quentin almost immediately saves Stephanie Lewis (Amelia Heinle) from a rapist/murderer.  As the movie progresses, it turns out that beautiful Stephanie likes Quentin, and may even be interested in him.Unfortunately for Quentin, his new spider powers come with the terrible side effect of turning him into a real spider, with the hunger of a real spider.  Soon Quentin has all sorts of interesting physical changes that make him unsuitable for lovely Stephanie.  In the best tradition of the B-movie, Stephanie doesn't give up on Quentin even when he's threatening to make her his next meal.Dan Ackroyd also has a lead role in this movie as the appropriately named Detective Jack Grillo.  Dan never quite puts his finger on the situation until near the end of the movie, when he realizes that just maybe a really big spider is killing everyone.  Unfortunately, he also loses his lovely, but unfaithful and apparently alcoholic, wife Trixie (Theresa Russell).  In one of those wonderful coincidences so common to the B-movie, Trixie's lover Officer Williams (Christopher Cousins) also meets his fate at the fangs of the spider.  Interestingly, the normally humorous Dan Ackroyd plays a serious character, but is just over the top enough to be a caricature of an old-style gumshoe.The special effects of Sam Winston are good and valuable in this movie, yet the success of the movie hinges not on the special effects, but on the plot.  The characters provide a nearly believable innocence found in the monster movies of yore.  We want Quentin to be good and to recover.  We fall in love with the innocent, nave Stephanie, and want Quentin and her to be together.  We feel sorry for hard-working Detective Grillo, whose wife does not understand his commitment to his job.  An old-fashioned monster movie pulls us in and allows us to relive the days of ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf.""This movie is worthy of a horror fan's collection, and certainly worth at least one watch.

695324,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B000063JZP,Martin Asiner,"[2, 2]","Back in the 50s, monster movies most often revolved around the mutation of a human being into a morphed killer, who kept on killing right until the closing credits.  In EARTH VS THE SPIDER, director Scott Ziehl captures the essence of the innocent days when a man monster places himself squarely against society in a way that elicits some sympathy from the audience.  Modernized versions of the transformation movie usually attempt to interject some politically correct philosophical underpininning, much as Jeff Goldblum tried in his update of THE FLY.David Summersall plays Quentin, a nerdish security guard who protects his boss's arachnid DNA experiments by day and dreams of being Spiderman by night.  Quentin is your typical post-adolescent who is shy about asking out his pretty neighbor, played by Amelia Heinle.  During a break-in by thugs who kill his best friend, Quentin tries to do on purpose what Peter Parker did by accident in SPIDERMAN.  Quentin deliberately injects spider DNA into his body with predicatble results.  But in the world of EARTH VS THE SPIDER, spider powers accompany a spider's body.  Quentin slowly changes into a spider that must feed on fresh human blood.  It is at this point, that director Ziehl succeeds admirably in fusing the world of the comic hero with the world of the 50s mutant hero.  Many of the scenes blend seamlessly from stark horror to bemused comedy.  Dan Akroyd, for one of the few times in his career, plays a straight role as Lieutenant Grillo, who seeks this new webbed killer.  Theresa Russell, however, is miscast as his slatternly wife, who sleepwalks through her role as a boozy flirt.  The charm of EARTH VS THE SPIDER lies not in the special effects of Jeff Winston, who does his usual superlative job of making the impossibly gross seem inevitably straightforward, but in the comforting feeling that unpretentious fright flicks like this one can take the viewer back to a more innocent time when angry villagers with torches storm the mad scientist's castle to remove an evil presence.  This is a gem of a movie that deserves to be on the shelf of any serious fan of the gothic genre.",4,Just Like the Good Old Days,1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,2149,"['Back', '50s', 'monster', 'movies', 'most', 'often', 'revolved', 'mutation', 'human', 'being', 'morphed', 'killer', 'who', 'kept', 'killing', 'right', 'closing', 'credits', 'EARTH', 'VS', 'THE', 'SPIDER', 'director', 'Scott', 'Ziehl', 'essence', 'innocent', 'days', 'when', 'man', 'monster', 'squarely', 'society', 'way', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'Modernized', 'versions', 'transformation', 'movie', 'usually', 'interject', 'politically', 'correct', 'philosophical', 'underpininning', 'much', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'tried', 'update', 'THE', 'FLY.David', 'Summersall', 'Quentin', 'nerdish', 'security', 'guard', 'who', 'boss', 'arachnid', 'DNA', 'experiments', 'day', 'dreams', 'being', 'Spiderman', 'night', 'Quentin', 'typical', 'post-adolescent', 'who', 'shy', 'asking', 'out', 'pretty', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Amelia', 'Heinle', 'break-in', 'thugs', 'who', 'kill', 'best', 'friend', 'Quentin', 'do', 'purpose', 'what', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'did', 'accident', 'SPIDERMAN', 'Quentin', 'deliberately', 'spider', 'DNA', 'body', 'predicatble', 'results', 'world', 'EARTH', 'VS', 'THE', 'SPIDER', 'spider', 'powers', 'accompany', 'spider', 'body', 'Quentin', 'slowly', 'spider', 'must', 'feed', 'fresh', 'human', 'blood', 'point', 'director', 'Ziehl', 'admirably', 'fusing', 'world', 'comic', 'hero', 'world', '50s', 'mutant', 'hero', 'Many', 'scenes', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'stark', 'horror', 'bemused', 'comedy', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'career', 'straight', 'role', 'Lieutenant', 'Grillo', 'who', 'new', 'webbed', 'killer', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'however', 'miscast', 'slatternly', 'wife', 'who', 'role', 'boozy', 'flirt', 'charm', 'EARTH', 'VS', 'THE', 'SPIDER', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'Jeff', 'Winston', 'who', 'usual', 'superlative', 'job', 'making', 'impossibly', 'gross', 'seem', 'inevitably', 'straightforward', 'comforting', 'feeling', 'unpretentious', 'fright', 'flicks', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'viewer', 'back', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'when', 'angry', 'villagers', 'torches', 'storm', 'mad', 'scientist', 'castle', 'remove', 'evil', 'presence', 'gem', 'movie', 'be', 'shelf', 'serious', 'fan', 'gothic', 'genre']",N/A
695325,A3TWCND9PMIOG5,B000063JZP,"Marty Kingsley ""That Geek With The Clip-Ons""","[1, 1]","How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it/really liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulSo far I've only seen 2 out of the 5 Creature Features; this and Larry Clark's Teenage Caveman. The latter of which is a piece of crud! I hope the others are good as well, but I have a feeling this one will be the best of the bunch. My first attraction to this movie was that it had Dan Aykroyd in it. I would consider him one of my favorite actors, and under appreciated when it comes to more serious roles. Not that this movie doesn't have some cheese, but you expect that from a movie that's a throwback to the 50's B flicks. The rest of the cast does a good job as well.Devon Gummersall plays Quentin Kemmer, a shy comic book geek who works as a security guard at a research lab. His favorite superhero is the Arachnid Avenger, a clear homage to Spiderman. He even named his dog Thor, after the Marvel superhero of course. Quentin also has a crush on his pretty neighbor, but doesn't think she'd ever want to go out with someone like him. One day the lab he works at is attacked and his partner and friend is killed as a result. Quentin is fired, but before leaving he injects himself with a special serum made from spider DNA. Soon Quentin finds that being a spider isn't all that fantastic. Soon he's got an insatiable appetite, and tries desperately to keep his humanity. Aykroyd plays a seasoned detective trying to solve a string of bizarre killings.Overall this really is a solid film. The direction is tight and well executed. Like a good horror film, it builds up some tension before something shocking happens and gives us time with our characters. Gummersall is very likable as Quentin, and you believe he doesn't want to be a monster. That's another thing I like about the movie, the main character trying to hold on to his humanity. Amelia Heinle does a fine job as well as the love interest, who still wants his outcome to be good even when he's fully transformed. Some might think Aykroyd is miscast as the detective (mainly because of his weight), but I think he brings a lot to the role. He's very much reminiscent of an old fashioned PI who's set in his ways, and years of dealing with horrible crimes wearing him down.The real star of this movie of course are the special effects done by Stan Winston and his crew. Man do I love practical effects. Nothing against CGI, when done well it can look amazing and I know for the most part a lot of effort goes into those as well. But with prosthetics and such you see the work that goes into it by hand. They do use some computer effects to show Quentin morphing, but it's quick enough that it doesn't distract. The final form is really cool looking. They actually did make a figure of the monster, and I so want to get that some day if I can find it for a decent price. It reminds me of when Spiderman mutated in Man Spider. This is another cool aspect as well, what if Peter Parker had become even more spider than man. I also like the bit that talks about the nature of a spider, it's one of those touches that may not seem important to some, but it helps to enforce what's happening to Quentin.

This one is based on a little known 1957 film, and director Scott Ziehl leads his cast though the motions quite convincingly.We meet Quentin (Devon Gummersall), a timid security clerk at a chemical laboratory, whose dream is to be a &quot;superhero.&quot;  He is falling for his next door neighbor, the glamorous nursing student, Stephanie (Amelia Heinle), but he doesn't have the confidence to ask her out.  Meanwhile, back at the lab, someone breaks in and tries to steal something, which results in the death of Quentin's buddy, and he loses his job.  Before he goes, however, he injects himself with spider DNA because his dead friend said that the serum would make spiders invincible.  Of course, the serum does that---and more.The movie has some funny scenes (a cop steps on an escaped spider and it bounces right back), and it also has some gruesome ones involving the metamorphosis of Quentin into a disgusting spider man.The effects are well done, and the pacing of the movie is good.  Gummersall and Heinle are excellent; Theresa Russell as Dan Ackyroyd's cheating wife is sleazy.  I think Dan Ackroyd, however, was seriously miscast.  Granted, the actor is talented, but it's hard to see him as a tough NY Detective, and the poor guy is ballooning out, too---which adds to the improper casting.  But, it's a decent remake, better than the original, and let's hope Creature Features continues to redo some of those great b movies of our time!

It bills itself as a Terrifying Thriller Horror but I can only think of one shot in the film intended to scare. It plays more like a long episode of the Monsters! television show.

I had hopes for Akroyd due to his work in previous Horror/Comedies and even a few dramatic performances. Unfortunately, he and all the other actors play it for high drama.

Well, Quentin certainly did, dreaming about being a hero like his idol, the &quot;Arachnid Avenger.&quot; He found himself very inadequate in real life, however, with his job as a lowly security guard at a biotech company not allowing him to live his dreams. He couldn't stop local crime in his neighborhood, get the dream girl living in the apartment next door, or even feel good about himself. Still, all of this changes when the company he works for is infiltrated and things go terribly wrong, leaving him with a dead partner, a former occupation, and the chance to inject himself with a secret weapons research project involving extracts from spiders. That's when things go wonderfully wrong.To me, this movie felt like a classical superhero story at first, with the challenges of life inflicting someone who found themselves in a position of inferiority.  Then, out of the blue, a chance to become more presents itself and Quentin, being obsessed with the idea of having superpowers, can't pass it up. With them comes instant gratification, and he finds himself becoming something he never dreamed of, a man with strength, speed, and other, stranger (spider-like) abilities. Still, the bubble bursts soon enough when he finds that Stan Winston isn't interested in a superhero at all, and that Creature Features are just that.Having seen all the hype behind Spiderman's impending release, I found this movie a bit too fun to pass up. I know how Winston gets with his monsters, and I knew that the &quot;boy wonder&quot; wouldn't have that happy ending he had been longing for. Despite being a bit predictable, the movie still had a lot to offer, and you can actually taste everything going wrong at first and began to wonder when everything would stop going wrong by the end. I really wasn't disappointed in the least, except in one small regard, the fact that I could have used a bit more of that wonderful finished monster product.
