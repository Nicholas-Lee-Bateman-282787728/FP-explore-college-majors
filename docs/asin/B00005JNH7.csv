630769,A14W0N8PWQAKYU,B00005JNH7,"Ashley ""conga1985""","[55, 56]","DAYS is so deserving of DVD releases.  Though it's impossible for the entire series to get released since it's aired 5-days a week year-round for over forty years, Sony could still come out with themed ""Best Of"" multi-disc collections containing various FULL EPISODES, like each character or couple (past and present) having their own collection, or a weddings collection, and so on.  A good way for Sony to test the waters and see if DAYS DVD's would sell would be to maybe release the three primetime specials (One Stormy Night - 1992, Night Sins - 1993, and Winter Heat - 1994) as a set.  Then if successful proceed with larger themed collections.  It would be great if DAYS were to be the soap that broke the ice for daytime soaps on DVD.

I think it would be a great idea to release this feature on DVD.To those reviewers who think it's absurd or impossible to release the complete series because it's been on the air for 40 years now (and they air 5 episodes every week), I think you should do some research before making any negative comments about the release. `Days of our lives' was a half an hour show for the first 10 years since it aired (from the mid 60s to mid 70s). MPI have already released almost all the episodes of the soap opera `Dark Shadows' (which also aired for half an hour every week day in the 1960s and 1970s) and plan on releasing the entire series in due time. MPI wouldn't continue to release the box sets if they weren't selling well. So, if MPI can release every episode of a soap opera, I don't see why Sony/Columbia/Tristar can't make box sets as well. I can understand that it would be rather tedious and expensive to release the episodes that each aired for one hour from 1975, but at least they can release the first 10 years of the show like MPI did for `Dark Shadows'. I'm sure other `Days of our lives' viewers like I would love to see how the family generations started off, and how the characters were, back then. Besides, 1 hour episodes aren't actually an entire hour. If you remove the commercials, they only come up to around 36-38 minutes per episodes, and the company would be able to put around 4-5 episodes per DVD.All in all, I think it would be a great idea, because other than `Dark Shadows', no other soap opera has been released on DVD in season box sets.

I would hate to start to invest in a complete series (a series that I am sure would cost a bundle since it is so huge) and then find out that after the first two or three years did not sell much that they just washed the whole idea.  If they decide to do this then I think they should start by releasing the most recent years then start working their way backwards.  Also, if they were still unsure about such a large project on DVD then what about individual shows available for download via internet?
