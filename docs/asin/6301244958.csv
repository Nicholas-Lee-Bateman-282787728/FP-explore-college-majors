I didn&#8217;t care too much for this one either, although I think I liked it better.  It wasn&#8217;t terrible, but it was also pretty dull for long stretches and didn&#8217;t really pack much into the film.  When you have one of these character dramas, you need to have performances that bring you into these characters and make their plights feel honest and meaningful, but Basinger and Vincent just aren&#8217;t strong enough here, and the film&#8217;s general tone is one of complacency.  You can sense it&#8217;s trying hard, but nothing is realty happening.",3,Country gone soft&#8230;,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,718,"['watching', '8216', 'Hard', 'Country', '8217', 'was', 'reminded', '1980', '8217', '8216', 'Melvin', 'Howard', '8217', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'didn', '8217', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'think', 'liked', 'better', 'wasn', '8217', 'terrible', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'dull', 'long', 'stretches', 'didn', '8217', 'really', 'pack', 'much', 'film', 'When', 'have', 'one', 'character', 'dramas', 'need', 'have', 'performances', 'bring', 'characters', 'make', 'plights', 'feel', 'honest', 'meaningful', 'Basinger', 'Vincent', 'just', 'aren', '8217', 'strong', 'enough', 'here', 'film', '8217', 'general', 'tone', 'one', 'complacency', 'can', 'sense', '8217', 'trying', 'hard', 'nothing', 'realty', 'happening']",N/A

Hard Country is a 1981 dramatic movie starring Jan-Michael Vincent and Kim Basinger, and co-starring country music star Tanya Tucker along with Daryl Hannah. It was directed by David Greene and is rated PG in the USA.SUMMARY: This picture opened in theaters in the USA sometime in April of 1981 starring Jan Michael Vincent as Kyle, Kim Basinger who made her movie debut in this picture starred as Jodie, Michael Parks as Royce and Gayland Sartain as Johnny Bob. This movie is about the lives and that great state of Texas. No one ever moves away from the great state of Texas or even thinks about except one person. That person is a very young lady who's name is Jodie and she works for the telephone company. Jodie is filled with love and has that Georgia charm that makes anyone that comes around her fall in love with her right away. Jodie leaves with a young man name Kyle. Kyle is a young Texas boy who works at a local factor making chain link fences. These two young kids lived together in a little mobile home along with Kyle's dog. The problem is that Kyle likes the some country bars his friends and drinking beer while Jodie wants more. The country bar that everyone goes to is Stallions where they sing drink beer and have a good old country time. One night while at Stallions, a young woman that Jodie grew up is announced as tonight's entertainment and her name was Caroline. After Caroline is down singing her and her friend all, meet at Jodie place to drink and talk. Caroline and Jodie go into another room where they catch up on old times. Jodie biggest dream is that she wanted to become a flight attendant. The next day while at work, one of Jodie's coworkers shows her and ad in the local paper that states that the airlines are holding interviews at the local Marriott Hotel. While in the interview Jodie is asked if she would be willing to go to California for training and she accepted now all she has to do is wait to see if she can get the letter in the mail that states that she was accepted. Things start to erode when while at the Stallion Kyle is called out in a drinking game. The object of the game is both players get a pitcher of beer and the first person that drinks it all and puts his pitcher on the bar wins. After sitting and watching this, Jodie gets up and walks out because she had enough of Kyle childlike behavior.QUESTIONS: Will Jodie get accepted to the airlines as an Attendant? Will Kyle ever grow up and realize that what he has with Jodie is hard to find. Will Jodie dream of leaving Texas and moved to California ever happen.MY THOUGHTS: I thought this movie kind of drag a little even thought it had action, adventure, and drama in it. I thought that Kyle was your typical young man who had a good thing going but continue to act like a jerk. I thought Kim Basinger was excellent in her movie debut. She had spunk and knew when to use it. She was not only beautiful but she has talent also. I love the scene where she's cooking breakfast in her underwear and the other scene where she lying in bed with her legs up showing off the gorgeous thighs. I think that this movie could've used some more drama but Kim Basinger saves this movie and that's why I'm going to give this movie 10 weasel stars base on Kim Basinger alone. Kim Basinger movie debut was fantastic",5,Kim Basinger Excellent Movie Debut,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,3407,"['TITLE', 'HARD', 'COUNTRY', 'was', 'release', 'April', '1', '1981', 'time', 'movie', 'was', '104', 'minutes', 'Hard', 'Country', '1981', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'starring', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'co-starring', 'country', 'music', 'star', 'Tanya', 'Tucker', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'was', 'directed', 'David', 'Greene', 'rated', 'PG', 'USA.SUMMARY', 'picture', 'opened', 'theaters', 'USA', 'sometime', 'April', '1981', 'starring', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'Kyle', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'debut', 'picture', 'starred', 'Jodie', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'Royce', 'Gayland', 'Sartain', 'Johnny', 'Bob', 'movie', 'lives', 'great', 'state', 'Texas', 'one', 'ever', 'away', 'great', 'state', 'Texas', 'even', 'thinks', 'one', 'person', 'person', 'very', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'name', 'Jodie', 'telephone', 'company', 'Jodie', 'filled', 'love', 'Georgia', 'charm', 'anyone', 'fall', 'love', 'right', 'away', 'Jodie', 'young', 'man', 'name', 'Kyle', 'Kyle', 'young', 'Texas', 'boy', 'who', 'local', 'factor', 'making', 'chain', 'link', 'fences', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'lived', 'together', 'little', 'mobile', 'home', 'Kyle', 'dog', 'problem', 'Kyle', 'country', 'friends', 'drinking', 'beer', 'Jodie', 'more', 'country', 'bar', 'everyone', 'Stallions', 'where', 'sing', 'drink', 'beer', 'have', 'good', 'old', 'country', 'time', 'One', 'night', 'Stallions', 'young', 'woman', 'Jodie', 'grew', 'up', 'announced', 'tonight', 'entertainment', 'name', 'was', 'Caroline', 'Caroline', 'down', 'singing', 'friend', 'meet', 'Jodie', 'place', 'drink', 'talk', 'Caroline', 'Jodie', 'go', 'room', 'where', 'catch', 'up', 'old', 'times', 'Jodie', 'biggest', 'dream', 'wanted', 'become', 'flight', 'attendant', 'next', 'day', 'work', 'one', 'Jodie', 'coworkers', 'ad', 'local', 'paper', 'airlines', 'are', 'holding', 'interviews', 'local', 'Marriott', 'Hotel', 'interview', 'Jodie', 'asked', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'California', 'training', 'accepted', 'now', 'do', 'wait', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'letter', 'mail', 'was', 'accepted', 'Things', 'start', 'erode', 'when', 'while', 'Stallion', 'Kyle', 'called', 'out', 'drinking', 'game', 'object', 'game', 'players', 'get', 'pitcher', 'beer', 'first', 'person', 'pitcher', 'bar', 'wins', 'sitting', 'watching', 'Jodie', 'up', 'walks', 'out', 'had', 'enough', 'Kyle', 'childlike', 'behavior.QUESTIONS', 'Will', 'Jodie', 'get', 'accepted', 'airlines', 'Attendant', 'Will', 'Kyle', 'ever', 'grow', 'up', 'realize', 'what', 'Jodie', 'hard', 'find', 'Will', 'Jodie', 'dream', 'leaving', 'Texas', 'moved', 'California', 'ever', 'happen.MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'thought', 'movie', 'kind', 'drag', 'little', 'even', 'thought', 'had', 'action', 'adventure', 'drama', 'thought', 'Kyle', 'was', 'typical', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'continue', 'act', 'jerk', 'thought', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'debut', 'had', 'spunk', 'knew', 'when', 'use', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'talent', 'also', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'cooking', 'breakfast', 'underwear', 'other', 'scene', 'where', 'lying', 'bed', 'legs', 'up', 'showing', 'off', 'gorgeous', 'thighs', 'think', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'more', 'drama', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'movie', 'why', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'movie', '10', 'weasel', 'stars', 'base', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'alone', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'movie', 'debut', 'was', 'fantastic']",N/A
