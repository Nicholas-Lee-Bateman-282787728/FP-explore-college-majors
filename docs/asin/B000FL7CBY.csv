I bought Almost Strangers because it was in my ""recommendations list"" and read all the good reviews.  Love it and will treasure this.  I've been watching this once a day, after a stressful day at work.  A combination of drama and comedy.  Michael Gambon is a superb actor, so as Matthew MacFadyen, as well as the other actors - Lindsay Duncan, Timothy Spall, Toby Stephens, Claire Skinner.  I like their characters and how they portrayed their characters so well.  I like the plot  of the movie - every family has some secrets, exposing them give peace to every one.

Of course as is typical with those kinds of affairs, a lot of so called ""dirty laundry"" falls out of the closet--both literally and figuratively  . Most of which really isn't as bad as it is imagined to be.  As per normal there is always a ""do good"" family member that attempts ""to put things right"".  In this case it is a son of the so-called ""black sheep"" of the family as is so well played by Michael Gambon who gives a great performance indeed of a very strange person with his share of ""demons"".  His son played by Matthew Macfadyen is the ""do good"" family member that attempts to reconcile members that feel they (and a dead sibling) have been done wrong by a previously adored aunt that is now scorned by them.  Needless to say he fails miserably.  However, this attempt at making the aforesaid parties like each other again is the main focus of the story with the audience getting a peak at the family's history along with its ""dirty little secrets"".This miniseries is very well acted and directed.

In 2001 he created a television mini-series about a family reunion. It's hard to identify which actor is the ""star"" because so many of the characters figure so heavily in the 237 minutes of this highly involving dramedy. ""Almost Strangers"" is also called ""Perfect Strangers,"" so be careful when you look for it in your library or on your rental lists. The captions were activated by my DVD remote, not from my TV.Michael Gambon (""Gosford Park,"" ""The Lost Prince,"" ""Layer Cake"" and Dumbledore in ""Harry Potter"") plays one of the central characters. His son is played by Matthew Macfadyen (""Pride and Prejudice"" - 2005 and ""Death at a Funeral""). They are invited to a huge family reunion despite living some distance north of London and being considered sort of the black sheep of the family flock. One lovely aunt is played by Lindsay Duncan (""Mansfield Park"" and ""The Queen of Sheba's Pearls"") who portrays an elegant, gracious and capable woman caught in a wrenching dilemma.Macfadyen meets two cousins of a similar age and the three of them hit it off together. The male cousin is played by one of my favorites, Maggie Smith's son, Toby Stevens (""Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" ""Twelfth Night"" and ""Possession""). As we encounter various members of this extended family, we are treated with flashbacks which provide the back stories for them. There are long-kept secrets, long-held grudges, long-hidden love affairs, long-forgotten photographs and long-cherished marriages. We can wonder at the inseparable trio of elderly women, gape at the beautiful estates where the various functions take place and wince at the drunken dinner speech.This mini-series is involving, entertaining and highly satisfying.I recommend it.

992746,A2FV4Y4I7BBL6I,B000FL7CBY,R. Crane,"[14, 17]","Director/writer Stephen Poliakoff's movies focus on particular aspects of British life. In ""Gideon's Daughter"", Poliakoff captures the emptiness of celebrity culture, when it had reached unheard of heights after Princess Diana's death. In ""Almost Strangers"", the topic is family relationships, and the obsession with genealogy--digging to discover famous relations.The setting for this 3 part BBC series is a family reunion, a gathering of relatives, many of whom have not seen each other for decades. As they congregate for receptions, lunches, dinners and lectures, we see a typical mix of elderly and young people from a variety of economic and social backgrounds, though they all are connected by blood. One of them is the self-appointed family historian, who has amassed photographs of their past and shares them with family members.What makes this series so textured and fascinating is how Poliakoff uses images in the photographs to tell the backstories of these people.  The stories themselves are often unexpected and shocking.  What you see in reality hides the truths of the past, but you can decipher the pain, suffering, love and joy at key points in their lives in their old photographs.  As the series begins, it is almost boring seeing all these people, but as it progresses and their stories unfold, you can hardly believe how interesting their various lives have been. It is a terrific lesson not to meet people and make assumptions based on appearances.In a commentary Poliakoff discusses his own difficult relationship with his father, and the series reflects that difficulty in various family relationships.  It is a brilliant incisive look into the private lives of a family: the good, the bad, and the humiliating.  It is one of those experiences that afterwards you feel as though you actually knew everybody and that the experience was real.  Highly recommended.",5,"Do We Ever Really ""Know"" Our Family?",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,1887,"['Director/writer', 'Stephen', 'Poliakoff', 'movies', 'focus', 'particular', 'aspects', 'British', 'life', 'Gideon', 'Daughter', 'Poliakoff', 'emptiness', 'celebrity', 'culture', 'when', 'had', 'reached', 'unheard', 'heights', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'death', 'Almost', 'Strangers', 'topic', 'family', 'relationships', 'obsession', 'genealogy', 'digging', 'discover', 'famous', 'relations.The', 'setting', '3', 'part', 'BBC', 'series', 'family', 'reunion', 'gathering', 'relatives', 'many', 'whom', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'decades', 'congregate', 'receptions', 'lunches', 'dinners', 'lectures', 'see', 'typical', 'mix', 'elderly', 'young', 'people', 'variety', 'economic', 'social', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'connected', 'blood', 'One', 'self-appointed', 'family', 'historian', 'who', 'amassed', 'photographs', 'past', 'shares', 'family', 'members.What', 'series', 'so', 'textured', 'fascinating', 'how', 'Poliakoff', 'images', 'photographs', 'tell', 'backstories', 'people', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'unexpected', 'shocking', 'What', 'see', 'reality', 'truths', 'past', 'can', 'decipher', 'pain', 'suffering', 'love', 'joy', 'key', 'points', 'lives', 'old', 'photographs', 'series', 'almost', 'boring', 'seeing', 'people', 'stories', 'unfold', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'how', 'interesting', 'various', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'lesson', 'not', 'meet', 'people', 'make', 'assumptions', 'based', 'appearances.In', 'commentary', 'Poliakoff', 'own', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'father', 'series', 'difficulty', 'various', 'family', 'relationships', 'brilliant', 'incisive', 'look', 'private', 'lives', 'family', 'good', 'bad', 'humiliating', 'one', 'experiences', 'afterwards', 'feel', 'actually', 'knew', 'everybody', 'experience', 'was', 'real', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
992747,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000FL7CBY,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[57, 61]","This 3-part production from the BBC is chiefly for fans of high-class soap. While intended to be full of ironies about the dubious pride we take in being related to notable people (especially when they're glamorous, upper class, and wealthy), the central story line is a series of revelations - all of them family secrets - that turn out to be more mysteriously promising in their expectation than they are in fact.The performances make it all watchable. Michael Gambon is in top form as a curmudgeonly black sheep of the family (with comparisons early on to his cranky and embittered Singing Detective) and Lindsay Duncan as a beautiful, eternally sad woman of certain years who carries an unspoken grief with unfailing dignity. Together, they make a compelling contrast, and you wish the story had more to do with their relationship. Alas, it follows the adventures of his twenty-something son (Matthew Macfadyen), who takes a shine to two upper-crust cousins, while bedding one of them and finally meddling in family affairs that are beyond his simple wish to have age-old animosities resolved.Writer-director Stephen Poliakoff provides a commentary for the film, revealing the experiences from his own life used as source material for the dramatic situations and characters he has created, plus observations on the film's production, locations used (like Claridge's) and other off-camera matters. A short featurette includes additional comments by Poliakoff and a few members of the cast.",4,High-class soap . . .,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,1492,"['3-part', 'production', 'BBC', 'chiefly', 'fans', 'high-class', 'soap', 'intended', 'be', 'full', 'ironies', 'dubious', 'pride', 'take', 'being', 'related', 'notable', 'people', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'glamorous', 'upper', 'class', 'wealthy', 'central', 'story', 'line', 'series', 'revelations', 'family', 'secrets', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'mysteriously', 'promising', 'expectation', 'are', 'fact.The', 'performances', 'make', 'watchable', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'top', 'form', 'curmudgeonly', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'comparisons', 'early', 'cranky', 'embittered', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'beautiful', 'eternally', 'sad', 'woman', 'certain', 'years', 'who', 'unspoken', 'grief', 'unfailing', 'dignity', 'Together', 'make', 'compelling', 'contrast', 'wish', 'story', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'relationship', 'Alas', 'adventures', 'twenty-something', 'son', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'who', 'shine', 'two', 'upper-crust', 'cousins', 'bedding', 'one', 'finally', 'meddling', 'family', 'affairs', 'are', 'simple', 'wish', 'have', 'age-old', 'animosities', 'resolved.Writer-director', 'Stephen', 'Poliakoff', 'commentary', 'film', 'revealing', 'experiences', 'own', 'life', 'used', 'source', 'material', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'characters', 'created', 'observations', 'film', 'production', 'locations', 'used', 'Claridge', 'other', 'off-camera', 'matters', 'short', 'featurette', 'additional', 'comments', 'Poliakoff', 'few', 'members', 'cast']",N/A
