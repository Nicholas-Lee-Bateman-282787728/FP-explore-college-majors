1395393,A25FAJE4T2C6LU,B004BJMEO6,Aaron J. Krohn,"[3, 5]","I'm a 68 year old white heterosexual male...who happens to LOVE relationship movies, and LESBIAN relationship movies in particular....and lesbian-meeting-and-loving-straight-woman-relationship movies even more!!Those predilections taken into account, ""Elena Undone"" is the absolute BEST of that ""genre""!!Before I saw ""Elena"", I'd watched ""Room in Rome"", and THAT movie became my #1 in the above genre.(Previously, my favorite ""lesbian"" movie was ""Everything Relative"", but that movie is sorta like ""The Big Chill"" of lesbian movies.  Great flick, but NOT in the ""lez loves straight"" category!!)So, why is ""Elena Undone"" so fabulous??I'll begin with the story.It's believable!A married (15 years) woman with a teen son meets a lesbian at an adoption center.  Elena (a sensational Necar Zadegan) and her Pastor husband have tried, but failed to conceive a 2nd child.  Peyton (an also-sensational Traci Dinwiddie) is a woman whose mother just died, whose last relationship ended, but who wants to have a child.It's an instant attraction!!For both of them!!For Peyton, it's easy.....she's met another woman she's very attracted to.For Elena.....not so easy!!She's NEVER been attracted to a woman, hasn't even kissed a woman...ever!The story follows their blossoming relationship, from first chats to a photo shoot (for Peyton's book cover...Elena is a GREAT photog!!) to deeper and deeper involvement....to their first long kiss (advertised as the ""longest kiss in cinema history""!!)...to sex.But this is one story where the sex ACT isn't the be all-end all of the movie.Nonetheless, it's beautifully done, erotic, sensual, poetic.I won't reveal what happens later.....You'll have to see the movie for that!....but problems DO arise, and how they deal with those problems makes the ending a real HUGE tearjerking few minutes!!Yes, me, a 68 year old male, cried WET tears (not just a damp tear drifting down my cheek, but SOB-like crying!!) in the last 10 minutes of the film!!The actresses.In one word, PERFECT!!If you can think of any ""name"" actresses who could have done a better job, please let me know!!They are beautiful, and display their emotions right up FRONT!!You really believe these women ARE falling in love, and ARE lusting after the other!!The dialogueAs a writer for 47 years (and counting!), I MUST have GREAT dialogue to make me enjoy a movie (or TV show or book).And ""Elena Undone"" has all that!!I don't know if any of it was improvised (the dialogue, I mean), but it easily COULD have been!!Because the words these women speak are words YOU have spoken in YOUR serious relationships...and words I've spoken in mine!!Again, in one word, PERFECT!!Then there's the ""extras"".Meaning the other characters.Elena's best friend is a married male motivational speaker who's doing a documentary on ""twin flames"", people meeting their true soulmates.  (They're platonic friends!!)Peyton's best friend is another lesbian she's known since high school.  She's a wise-cracking Brit (Her accent sounds British!!) who is always THERE for Peyton!!Also, interspersed throughout are ""real"" (??) couples who tell the audience (or Elena's friend's camera!!) how they met and fell in love.  Reminded me a LOT of similar scenes from ""When Harry Met Sally""!!Then there's Elena's husband, who plays it kind of straightforward.And their son, Nash, who has a key role in the movie.Lastly, there's Nash's girlfriend, Tori, who is INCREDIBLE!!Wait till you see and hear HER!!!All told,  if there's a ""better"" lesbian-loves-straight movie, with all the necessary elements--emotions, lust, love, sex, believability--please tell me its name!!For lesbians and straights alike (both female AND male variety!), ""Elena Undone"" is a MUST SEE movie!!",5,The best lesbian-loves-straight woman movie EVER!,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,3728,"[""'m"", '68', 'year', 'old', 'white', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'who', 'LOVE', 'relationship', 'movies', 'LESBIAN', 'relationship', 'movies', 'particular', '.and', 'lesbian-meeting-and-loving-straight-woman-relationship', 'movies', 'even', 'more', 'predilections', 'taken', 'account', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'absolute', 'BEST', 'genre', 'saw', 'Elena', ""'d"", 'watched', 'Room', 'Rome', 'THAT', 'movie', 'became', '1', 'above', 'genre', 'Previously', 'favorite', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'was', 'Everything', 'Relative', 'movie', 'sorta', 'Big', 'Chill', 'lesbian', 'movies', 'Great', 'flick', 'NOT', 'lez', 'loves', 'straight', 'category', 'So', 'why', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'so', 'fabulous', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'story.It', 'believable', 'married', '15', 'years', 'woman', 'teen', 'son', 'lesbian', 'adoption', 'center', 'Elena', 'sensational', 'Necar', 'Zadegan', 'Pastor', 'husband', 'have', 'tried', 'failed', 'conceive', '2nd', 'child', 'Peyton', 'also-sensational', 'Traci', 'Dinwiddie', 'woman', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'last', 'relationship', 'ended', 'who', 'have', 'child.It', 'instant', 'attraction', 'Peyton', 'easy', 'met', 'woman', 'very', 'attracted', 'to.For', 'Elena', 'so', 'easy', 'NEVER', 'been', 'attracted', 'woman', ""n't"", 'even', 'kissed', 'woman', 'ever', 'story', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'first', 'chats', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Peyton', 'book', 'cover', 'Elena', 'GREAT', 'photog', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'involvement', '.to', 'first', 'long', 'kiss', 'advertised', 'longest', 'kiss', 'cinema', 'history', 'sex.But', 'one', 'story', 'where', 'sex', 'ACT', ""n't"", 'be', 'all-end', 'movie.Nonetheless', 'beautifully', 'done', 'erotic', 'sensual', 'poetic.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'later', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', '.but', 'problems', 'DO', 'arise', 'how', 'deal', 'problems', 'ending', 'real', 'HUGE', 'tearjerking', 'few', 'minutes', 'Yes', '68', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'cried', 'WET', 'tears', 'not', 'just', 'damp', 'tear', 'drifting', 'down', 'cheek', 'SOB-like', 'crying', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'actresses.In', 'one', 'word', 'PERFECT', 'can', 'think', 'name', 'actresses', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'beautiful', 'display', 'emotions', 'right', 'up', 'FRONT', 'really', 'believe', 'women', 'ARE', 'falling', 'love', 'ARE', 'lusting', 'other', 'dialogueAs', 'writer', '47', 'years', 'counting', 'MUST', 'have', 'GREAT', 'dialogue', 'make', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'book', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'improvised', 'dialogue', 'mean', 'easily', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'words', 'women', 'speak', 'are', 'words', 'YOU', 'have', 'spoken', 'YOUR', 'serious', 'relationships', 'words', ""'ve"", 'spoken', 'mine', 'Again', 'one', 'word', 'PERFECT', 'Then', 'extras', '.Meaning', 'other', 'characters.Elena', 'best', 'friend', 'married', 'male', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'who', 'doing', 'documentary', 'twin', 'flames', 'people', 'meeting', 'true', 'soulmates', ""'re"", 'platonic', 'friends', 'Peyton', 'best', 'friend', 'lesbian', 'known', 'high', 'school', 'wise-cracking', 'Brit', 'accent', 'British', 'who', 'always', 'THERE', 'Peyton', 'Also', 'interspersed', 'are', 'real', 'couples', 'who', 'tell', 'audience', 'Elena', 'friend', 'camera', 'how', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'Reminded', 'LOT', 'similar', 'scenes', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Then', 'Elena', 'husband', 'who', 'kind', 'son', 'Nash', 'who', 'key', 'role', 'movie.Lastly', 'Nash', 'girlfriend', 'Tori', 'who', 'INCREDIBLE', 'Wait', 'till', 'see', 'hear', 'told', 'better', 'lesbian-loves-straight', 'movie', 'necessary', 'elements', 'emotions', 'lust', 'love', 'sex', 'believability', 'please', 'tell', 'name', 'lesbians', 'straights', 'alike', 'female', 'male', 'variety', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'movie']",N/A
1395394,A1TRRIAA44W5OO,B004BJMEO6,Accen28,"[10, 15]","I purchased this film based on a friend's recommendation, and the fact that I think Traci Dinwiddie is gorgeous and very witty in real life (I saw an interview). I wish I had rented it instead. Parts of it were very well done. There was definite chemistry between the two women, and the two lead actresses were really good. You could feel their attraction to each other, and I liked how the director made us feel the increasing sexual tension and attraction between them, so that when we finally get to their first kiss (the much publicized 'longest kiss'), it felt inevitable.About that first kiss: I'm not a fan of it. Sometimes less is more. It felt too awkward in spots. I know directors stage these kinds of scenes to make them appear natural and romantic, but this one lost me about the time they got to the chaise. The position looked uncomfortable, and I found myself thinking about that instead of the kiss.The biggest problems were the structure of the film and the script. There is a narrator -- Elena's best friend, Tyler, who is filming a video project about Soulemetry, which is another term for soul mates, but is Tyler's raison d'tre and how he makes a living. Watching a documentary about the random documentary couples that keep popping up would be interesting, perhaps, but not in this movie. It distracts us from the story. Maybe that's the point, though. The plot is pretty thin, and the dialog is weak. Peyton (Dinwiddie) is supposed to be a successful writer (although she's written only one book about her agoraphobia, she lives in an expensive home, and doesn't appear to work). So it was a bit surprising when Peyton wrote such juvenile sounding letters to Elena.I wanted to know more about what happened after Elena's husband found out, but it all happens off screen. They could have added a couple of scenes to flesh out the main story, and add some dramatic substance and depth, if they didn't have all the distracting narration and clips from Tyler's video. I also disliked the narration because it was a device for the writer to tell us what we're supposed to learn from the story, instead of letting us discover it ourselves. This revealed a lack of faith in the strength of the story itself.Nicole Conn has certainly come a long way since 'Claire of the Moon,' which I thought was awful. I didn't hate Elena Undone. The acting was a lot better than in 'Claire,' but it's still mostly romantic fluff, and misses a great chance to tell a much more interesting and original story. My advice is to rent the movie instead of buying it, and lower your expectations a little from the big build-up this has gotten, and you should be happy.",3,Yet Another Opinion,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2664,"['purchased', 'film', 'based', 'friend', 'recommendation', 'fact', 'think', 'Traci', 'Dinwiddie', 'gorgeous', 'very', 'witty', 'real', 'life', 'saw', 'interview', 'wish', 'had', 'rented', 'instead', 'Parts', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'two', 'women', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'could', 'feel', 'attraction', 'other', 'liked', 'how', 'director', 'made', 'feel', 'increasing', 'sexual', 'tension', 'attraction', 'so', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'first', 'kiss', 'much', 'publicized', ""'longest"", 'kiss', 'felt', 'inevitable.About', 'first', 'kiss', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Sometimes', 'less', 'more', 'felt', 'too', 'awkward', 'spots', 'know', 'directors', 'stage', 'kinds', 'scenes', 'make', 'appear', 'natural', 'romantic', 'one', 'lost', 'time', 'got', 'chaise', 'position', 'looked', 'uncomfortable', 'found', 'thinking', 'instead', 'kiss.The', 'biggest', 'problems', 'were', 'structure', 'film', 'script', 'narrator', 'Elena', 'best', 'friend', 'Tyler', 'who', 'filming', 'video', 'project', 'Soulemetry', 'term', 'soul', 'mates', 'Tyler', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'how', 'living', 'Watching', 'documentary', 'random', 'documentary', 'couples', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'not', 'movie', 'story', 'point', 'plot', 'pretty', 'thin', 'dialog', 'weak', 'Peyton', 'Dinwiddie', 'supposed', 'be', 'successful', 'writer', 'written', 'only', 'one', 'book', 'agoraphobia', 'expensive', 'home', ""n't"", 'appear', 'work', 'was', 'bit', 'surprising', 'when', 'Peyton', 'wrote', 'such', 'juvenile', 'sounding', 'letters', 'Elena.I', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'Elena', 'husband', 'found', 'out', 'off', 'screen', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'couple', 'scenes', 'flesh', 'out', 'main', 'story', 'add', 'dramatic', 'substance', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'distracting', 'narration', 'clips', 'Tyler', 'video', 'also', 'disliked', 'narration', 'was', 'device', 'writer', 'tell', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'learn', 'story', 'instead', 'letting', 'discover', 'revealed', 'lack', 'faith', 'strength', 'story', 'itself.Nicole', 'Conn', 'certainly', 'come', 'long', 'way', ""'Claire"", 'Moon', 'thought', 'was', 'awful', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'acting', 'was', 'lot', 'better', ""'Claire"", 'still', 'mostly', 'romantic', 'fluff', 'great', 'chance', 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'original', 'story', 'advice', 'rent', 'movie', 'instead', 'buying', 'lower', 'expectations', 'little', 'big', 'build-up', 'gotten', 'should', 'be', 'happy']",N/A

1395404,A10NM4PC3209XU,B004BJMEO6,Deevah,"[0, 0]","How does a lesbian director open the curtains on a lesbian movie? With a man, of course! And thus, Nicole Conn begins her lesbian (and coming out) romance with the voice of Tyler (Sam Harris), the psychic love guru, setting the stage for whats to follow, and closes the film with him addressing the audience about soul mates. Tyler is a character that walks and talks like a gay boy, but remains an avowed heterosexual, and becomes the chatty instrument that pushes the plot to its conclusion. As for the gals who ignite the screen: Necar Zadegon (Elena) and Traci Dinwiddie (Peyton) give their characters gravity and conscience, and create love scenes together with sensuality and passion. I'd heard about the long kiss scene and looked forward to it; however, when it finally arrived I found its intensity quickly drained by the increasingly loud, second-rate, annoying soundtrack music. (Why, oh, why are so many lesbian independent films always subjected to dreadful song tracks?) When Elena and Peyton finally make love it results in one of the most electric moments in lesbian cinema. (Tsk-tsk: an actress in a non-porn lesbian sex scene should take off her ring, especially when said ring has a large [yikes!] gem stone.) Elena may be sexually undone in the beginning, but she gradually becomes aggressive in her ardent encounters with Peyton -- so much so, that while Peyton may be a top, Elena flips her with determined ease. In-between the lovemaking and WTF?!? ending you get New Age sermonizing and too much ado about having a baby. Conn deserves credit for bringing to the screen a memorable lesbian coupling that will become one of the highlights of lesbian film genre. However, she does not get a pass for loading the scale with heterosexual couples and not one, but three male key characters -- she needs to learn to do without.",4,"Lesbians, Christians, Psychics, Babies, and too many Men",1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,1844,"['How', 'lesbian', 'director', 'open', 'curtains', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'man', 'course', 'thus', 'Nicole', 'Conn', 'lesbian', 'coming', 'out', 'romance', 'voice', 'Tyler', 'Sam', 'Harris', 'psychic', 'love', 'guru', 'setting', 'stage', 'whats', 'follow', 'film', 'addressing', 'audience', 'soul', 'mates', 'Tyler', 'character', 'walks', 'talks', 'gay', 'boy', 'avowed', 'heterosexual', 'chatty', 'instrument', 'plot', 'conclusion', 'gals', 'who', 'ignite', 'screen', 'Necar', 'Zadegon', 'Elena', 'Traci', 'Dinwiddie', 'Peyton', 'give', 'characters', 'gravity', 'conscience', 'create', 'love', 'scenes', 'together', 'sensuality', 'passion', ""'d"", 'heard', 'long', 'kiss', 'scene', 'looked', 'forward', 'however', 'when', 'finally', 'arrived', 'found', 'intensity', 'quickly', 'drained', 'increasingly', 'loud', 'second-rate', 'annoying', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'lesbian', 'independent', 'films', 'always', 'subjected', 'dreadful', 'song', 'tracks', 'When', 'Elena', 'Peyton', 'finally', 'make', 'love', 'results', 'one', 'most', 'electric', 'moments', 'lesbian', 'cinema', 'Tsk-tsk', 'actress', 'non-porn', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scene', 'should', 'take', 'off', 'ring', 'especially', 'when', 'said', 'ring', 'large', '[', 'yikes', ']', 'gem', 'stone', 'Elena', 'may', 'be', 'sexually', 'undone', 'beginning', 'gradually', 'aggressive', 'ardent', 'encounters', 'Peyton', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'Peyton', 'may', 'be', 'top', 'Elena', 'determined', 'ease', 'In-between', 'lovemaking', 'WTF', 'ending', 'get', 'New', 'Age', 'sermonizing', 'too', 'much', 'ado', 'having', 'baby', 'Conn', 'credit', 'bringing', 'screen', 'memorable', 'lesbian', 'coupling', 'will', 'become', 'one', 'highlights', 'lesbian', 'film', 'genre', 'However', 'not', 'get', 'pass', 'loading', 'scale', 'heterosexual', 'couples', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'male', 'key', 'characters', 'learn', 'do']",N/A

Of course, I enjoyed watching Necar Zadegan -- she is a stunner and has a lovely accent. Her unusual looks and talents remain under-used. The cons are: the film is lacking in nuance. It ostensibly celebrates women but women are shown not as intelligent as they really are. In reality, women are walking supercomputers. They are capable of detecting love interest and distinguish the straight from lesbian ones in a matter of milliseconds. How long do you think it will take a woman to spot a lesbian interest projected on her? An instance. Yet, Necar is asking Traci -- after they hang out for a while -- what she meant by the phrase she ""had lived with a partner"".  After Traci admits she is lesbian, Necar proceeds to reassure Tracy that she is a friend of lesbians because she voted the right way.  Not only she is not shown terribly bright, she begins complying with Traci right away. This means that Traci had Necar ""at hello"", which doesn't make for an interesting romance, straight or lesbian. Where is the give-and-take? In end the film is a predictable vanilla soap.

1395418,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B004BJMEO6,KinoChelovek,"[2, 3]","I purchased this DVD due to the many good reviews on Amazon and the so-so ones over on imdb.  I was disappointed in many ways with this movie.First, the writer/director, Nicole Conn (known for ""Claire of the Moon""), places a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie that it is ""Inspired by Real Events"" (or something of that nature).  As a person who watches and analyzes movies, her disclaimer should have read ""Movie is a Remake of 'Un Amour de Femme' with a Religious Twist""!  -- read my review of that movie on Amazon --The story, not to be too redundant in the reviews, is about a married, quasi-religious woman who strays from her seemingly dull marriage (has one, male child) and falls for a lesbian woman.  She has to decide which is better for her: her devoutly religious life and her family OR a life of being a lesbian.  Yes, it is straight out of ""Un Amour de Femme,"" complete with a curly and long-haired son (granted, not the 9-year-old, but a 20-some-year-old playing a 16-year-old!) -- look out Peter Frampton!Second, what does Peyton, who is the best part of the movie as far as acting goes (and pretty to boot), do to afford a multi-million dollar home in what seems to be Beverly Hills to live in by herself and sit and swim in a pool ALL DAY LONG (it seems)?  There is no background info on her character (her family, her finances, for two instances), but all the other characters are described 'ad nauseum'.  Yes, I can buy that Elena is stuck in a lackluster role as housewife/mother, having given up her photography career, but the story never discusses Peyton, the second MAJOR character in the movie!  Why, Ms. Conn?  Are you hiding some information about yourself, seeing that there is an autobiographical ""feel"" to the movie?Third, the problem with writing a storyline with religion as a major element.  Ms. Conn seems to be attempting to discuss lesbianism while coming to grips with how to do so with the addition of the religious element in the movie.  She never seems to be able to show or balance religion in a positive light unless it is about the ""progressive"" Christians (not even going to go there).  She merely inserts monologues with Tyler discussing love like an outdated hippie from the early 70s.  Ms. Conn even inserts the character of Millie (I believe the character's name) to give a Christian stereotype of a coniving and scheming little b-----!  Insulting!  I'm not even religious, but it is insulting.Fourth, the son (and his girlfriend) and the father.  Talk about wooden, two-dimensional characters!  The son finds out his mom is ""becoming a lesbian"" and begins a life of theft, drinking, and watching lesbian porn(!).  The father doesn't even go that far!  In fact, the father simply disappears for most of the movie, as if Ms. Conn doesn't even know how to insert his role into the narrative.  He has every right to be angry and hurt by his unfaithful wife, but is shown in a bad light, both figuratively (as preaching in church about infidelity) and cinematographically (dark scenes in rooms that are claustrophobic).  He is rarely put into a positive light.  The son's girlfriend (an actress obviously too old for the part, like the son) just spouts off inane lines in front of the camera, even ""mugging"" every chance she can. It's buffoonish.There are many great elements of the film that, unfortunately, are trumped by (at least) the four pre-mentioned problems.  The camerawork and editing are quite good.  Even the few lesbian sex scenes are very well-shot and edited.  Note:  there is little nudity in the movie.  Ms. Conn can film a sex scene quite well.  Too bad the narrative isn't given equal respect.  I like the couples discussing how they met, especially the two that came from the same Oregon town and found each other in the world.  It was the best part of the movie.  However, the entire ""narrative insert"" concept has been done many times (""When Harry Met Sally""??).  The Tyler monologues are just annoying.  I felt like I was watching a really bad (chuckle here) Tom Cruise ""Magnolia"" impersonation.  The dual endings were okay.  The character named Wave was my favorite; on the other hand, Nash and Tyler were simply annoying and wooden.2 1/2 Amazon stars.  The story/narratives seem disjointed.  Too many characters that are stereotypes.  Religion is inserted and unrealistically portrayed.  Music (mostly by female performer(s)) was annoying and could have been better (even eliminated in several scenes).

At an adoption information session out lesbian writer, Peyton (Tracy Dinwiddle) meets Pastor's wife and photographer Elena (Necar Zadegan) and they exchange business cards. When Peyton asks Elena to collaborate on a project with her, their friendship begins. As they share information about their lives and experiences, the attraction begins to grow. During a photo shoot for Peyton's new author image, the tension mounts to nearly the breaking point. Although Elena doesn't believe that she is a lesbian, she does find herself irresistibly attracted to Peyton. When Elena shows up at Peyton's front door, she has one thing on her mind and the viewer is treated to a gloriously long make out session, including the longest screen kiss (3.5 minutes) in cinema history. After one taste of lesbian love, Elena is smitten and what started as a ""crush"" now advances quickly into a full-blown affair with exquisitely sensual love making scenes. Their love however, becomes so intense that Elena is unable to contain it any longer and she must choose between her husband and the woman she has fallen in love with.Writer/director Nicole Conn creates a wonderfully moving portrait of a woman caught in a loveless marriage who falls deeply in love with another woman. The film is well paced, capturing the early days of the women's attraction and all the excitement, nervousness and longing that goes along with it. The chemistry between Peyton and Elena is superb; the sexual tension virtually crackles on the screen.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2012 & 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",4,Sensual love scenes,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1619,"['Do', 'believe', 'possible', 'find', 'soulmate', 'adoption', 'information', 'session', 'lesbian', 'writer', 'Peyton', 'Tracy', 'Dinwiddle', 'Pastor', 'wife', 'photographer', 'Elena', 'Necar', 'Zadegan', 'exchange', 'business', 'cards', 'When', 'Peyton', 'Elena', 'collaborate', 'project', 'friendship', 'share', 'information', 'lives', 'experiences', 'attraction', 'grow', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Peyton', 'new', 'author', 'image', 'tension', 'mounts', 'nearly', 'breaking', 'point', 'Elena', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lesbian', 'find', 'irresistibly', 'attracted', 'Peyton', 'When', 'Elena', 'up', 'Peyton', 'front', 'door', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'viewer', 'treated', 'gloriously', 'long', 'make', 'out', 'session', 'including', 'longest', 'screen', 'kiss', '3.5', 'minutes', 'cinema', 'history', 'one', 'taste', 'lesbian', 'love', 'Elena', 'smitten', 'what', 'started', 'crush', 'now', 'quickly', 'full-blown', 'affair', 'exquisitely', 'sensual', 'love', 'making', 'scenes', 'love', 'however', 'so', 'intense', 'Elena', 'unable', 'contain', 'longer', 'must', 'choose', 'husband', 'woman', 'fallen', 'love', 'with.Writer/director', 'Nicole', 'Conn', 'wonderfully', 'moving', 'portrait', 'woman', 'caught', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'who', 'deeply', 'love', 'woman', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'capturing', 'early', 'days', 'women', 'attraction', 'excitement', 'nervousness', 'longing', 'along', 'chemistry', 'Peyton', 'Elena', 'superb', 'sexual', 'tension', 'virtually', 'screen.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2012', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",N/A

The chemistry between the two lead characters is unbelievable, and so real. This movie speaks to all lesbians, who find their true sexuality later in life. Not knowing who they are in their teens, and twenties, do what is expected, and date boys/young men, and marry young. Then something happens, and you meet someone who makes your heart race,  your hands sweat, and you can not catch your breath. It's a feeling you have never experienced with a man. You realize that your in love for the very first time. This movie is of a woman who falls into this category. Married, with a child, and just going through the motions of life. Not really feeling. Then she meets a beautiful lesbian who turns her world up side down. She awakens from this sleep she has been in for so long.

1395437,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004BJMEO6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Elena Undone (Nicole Conn, 2010)Elena Undone is known, mostly, for one thing--the kiss. The three minute and twenty-four-second kiss that broke the longest-onscreen-kiss record (three minutes and six seconds, You're in the Army Now, 1941). And let me rush to add before saying anything else that yeah, it is absolutely worth all the buzz. My oh my. But there's something I think it should be known for even more, and I was going to make it the subject of the opening paragraph (obviously), but then I realized it's kind of a spoiler, so I'll stick the plot synopsis on top of it and then, for those of you reading this in a place where it will have graphics, put up that big-[censored for Amazon consumption] ""spoiler alert!"" stop sign and you can figure out whether you want to continue reading. For the no-spoiler or short-attention-span crowds: I am recommending this, but with some reservations.Plot: Elena (Necar Zadegan, recently of Meth Head) is the wife of a pastor who's not quite sure what he believes--at the beginning of the film he seems to be a kind of laid-back guy, actually, but as one character wryly observes about halfway through the movie, psychotically-orthodox-religious Millie (Gone's Erin Carufel) is the church's biggest contributor, and so if Pastor Barry (Deadland's Gary Weeks) wants his church to stay afloat, he's got to adopt the same fire-and-brimstone attitude. Their marriage seems to be a solid one, though they have  the usual problems with a teenaged son, Nash (Connor Kramme, who seems to have hung up the acting gig to go behind the camera). And honestly, you can't call these folks a traditional family; Nash's girlfriend Tori (Beautiful Dreamer's Sabrina Fuster) lives with them; there are a couple of hints as to why this is, but it is never explicitly stated that I can remember. In any case, Elena and Barry have a friend from college named Tyler (Broadway actor Sam Harris, who won the very first season of Star Search back in the eighties), who dabbles in a little of everything to make money; one of the movie's conceits is that it cuts regularly to footage from a relationship video Tyler is editing (this starts off being kind of annoying, but by the end of the movie I was loving it). He also does psychic readings, and it is at one of Tyler's psychic-reading parties that Elena runs into Peyton (The Notebook's Traci Dinwiddie), an acquaintance Elena knows through the adoption agency where both of them have been feeling out the idea of adopting children--Elena because she and Barry may be having fertility problems, Peyton because she's a lesbian and isn't interested in going the ""traditional"" way when it comes to having a kid (she mentions early in the film she was previously married, and the expression on her face at the time should tell you all you need to know there). The two of them strike up a business relationship, but Elena quickly realizes that she has feelings geared toward turning it into something more...Okay, while the longest-onscreen-kiss thing is already kind of a spoiler, I'll stick up the spoiler alter stop sign here in case you don't want to know any more. Quit reading![insert spoiler stop sign]But like I said, I think the movie deserves equally to be known for the orgasm. Why? Because I can't believe that Conn is unaware of Kirby [censored for Amazon consumption, and yes, I note the irony of having to censor the director's name...]'s fantastic documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated, one  sequence of which contains fairly damning evidence that one of the things the MPAA absolutely refuses to tolerate in a R-rated movie is the face of a woman having an orgasm. (It is the clips in that segment of the documentary that got the film rated NC-17, lending additional credence to this position.) And, well, let's say Traci Dinwiddie is either really good at faking, or that was really an orgasm. Needless to say, the movie was released unrated (it was never submitted for rating in the first place), and I can't help but see that scene as a poke in the eye to the MPAA. A much-deserved one, I might add. (The one country IMDB reports the film as being rated in is The Netherlands, and there it is considered suitable for those 12 years of age or older. That is extremely telling about the idiocy of American morality.)So okay, enough about sex. What about the rest of the movie? (Though honestly, the sex is probably enough for me to say ""you should see this movie, it'll turn you on."") The actual plot of the film is kind of worn--a woman considers having an affair looking for something, and ends up finding herself--but it never actually feels that way, which is a big plus. On the other hand, some of the casting choices were questionable. There's a scene with Connor Kramme that's supposed to be intensely emotional that's, well, kind of unintentionally hilarious, and I really never bought Barry's transition from the confused-but-laid-back guy in the opening scenes to the fire-and-brimstone preacher; a bit more attention to that progression during the scriptwriting would have had a huge impact here, I think, and made Elena's ultimate decisions pack even more of a wallop than they did. (I will add that Sabrina Fuster's performance, which is sarcastic and knowing and all kinds of fun, does a lot to balance out these weak points--this is a woman with a very bright future in indie film, as long as Hollywood doesn't get hold of her.) So yeah, good points and bad points--but ultimately I think there's enough good here  to recommend it, even without the kiss or the orgasm. ***",3,Beneath the milky twilight...,1373328000,"07 9,

I saw plenty of desire in this movie,butalmost no passion. Two women who are ACHING to get together usually,for the firsttime,can't move fast enough to get their clothes off.Here, we get this airy,fairy,dead slow seduction scene.Simply not believable.If you want to see anticipation,desire and passion, see A Perfect Ending.Again it'sabout a straight married women wanting to walk on the wild side.Despite the seemingly negative tone of my review my interest was kept because ofthe dialogue.Ms.Conn did not hit a single discordant note throughout the entire movie. That alone was worth the price of admission,as they say.About the acting,Mary Wells was very believableand enjoyable as the best friend.Necar Zedagan never seemed to show an ounce of passion.I always felt as if she was standing on the sidelines watching here own reactions and not getting too involved.Acting involves a hell of a lot more than posing fora picture.I can't give a proper review of Traci Dinwiddie because she is so-o-o stunningthat I didn't care what she did.I do however wish she would have smiled morewhen she had the chance.She lights up the screen like a beacon with that smile.What's the chance of seeing either of these two actresses again in a lesbianmovie?
