This film is in the style of a quasi-documentary, as Laurence Fishburne (who does a fine job of acting) talks about Marshall's life in the style of a filmed lecture before an audience.  I don't think this would keep the attention of a high school audience and for those very knowledgeable about the subject you may be disappointed with some of the glossed over and missing details in his lecture.  They take some Hollywood liberties with some details though it is presented more like a factual documentary.",3,Disappointing.,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,584,"['am', 'history', 'teacher', 'who', 'subject', 'however', 'was', 'times', 'bored', 'film', 'style', 'quasi-documentary', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'talks', 'Marshall', 'life', 'style', 'filmed', 'lecture', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'keep', 'attention', 'high', 'school', 'audience', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'subject', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'glossed', 'missing', 'details', 'lecture', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'liberties', 'details', 'presented', 'more', 'factual', 'documentary']",N/A

I couldn't help thinking throughout the entire film that Laurence Fishburn has not received even 1/3 the acknowledgement of his talent as he should have.  I am buying several copies of this film to distribute to my students.  In saying this I'm not merely making the statement on the basis of his performance, but also on his depth of knowledge about the man. I feel, as someone who was around when Thurgood was in office, and who was well acquainted with the situation in the South,  during the 1950s and the restricted rights of African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, that Fishburne is practically a reincarnation of Thurgood.  The film is funny and sad. Many of the unspoken nuances defy misinterpretation and lend a good deal of humor to the presentation. I would definitely recommend that anyone who has not seen this film, see it and live the experiences of those living in America during the 1950s,1960s and 1970s.Bonita Evans, Ph.D.",5,Thurgood,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,981,"['truly', 'outstanding', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'entire', 'film', 'Laurence', 'Fishburn', 'not', 'received', 'even', '1/3', 'acknowledgement', 'talent', 'should', 'have', 'am', 'buying', 'several', 'copies', 'film', 'distribute', 'students', 'saying', ""'m"", 'not', 'merely', 'making', 'statement', 'basis', 'performance', 'also', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'man', 'feel', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'around', 'when', 'Thurgood', 'was', 'office', 'who', 'was', 'well', 'acquainted', 'situation', 'South', '1950s', 'restricted', 'rights', 'African-Americans', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'Fishburne', 'practically', 'reincarnation', 'Thurgood', 'film', 'funny', 'sad', 'Many', 'unspoken', 'nuances', 'defy', 'misinterpretation', 'lend', 'good', 'deal', 'humor', 'presentation', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'see', 'live', 'experiences', 'living', 'America', '1950s,1960s', '1970s.Bonita', 'Evans', 'Ph.D']",N/A
1414119,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004LROMXE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[14, 17]","THURGOOD (2011) is one of those incredible HBO films that makes me believe in synchronicity.I have always complained that a severe problem with American actors is they have never confronted their audience - unlike the British, who spend years performing in the streets, at Shakespeare's old haunts and tiny old theaters. The British practically lay (or jump into) the audience's lap. Americans have no idea what an ""audience"" is.In THURGOOD, Lawrence Fishburne, about whom I know little other than he's an actor I love, portrays USSC Justice Thurgood Marshall, a man who was a hero to both me and my father. Hoofing about onstage at the John F. Kennedy Center, before a live audience no more than a few feet from him, Fishburne shoulders this awesome one-man-play film with such cool, studied professionalism, I felt like it was actually Marshall.But I know all along it is Fishburne and his amazing talent. He begins old, hobbled as I recall Marshall when he announced his retirement. Then Fishburne does the amazing: he ages backward twice, with nothing more (nothing less!) than his skill. Once he ages backward to middle age, then again to about his 30s. At the end, in the space of about ten minutes, he ages back to 'old age'. And he nails Marshall spot-on, voice, gestures, jokes and foul language that were hallmarks I recall very well.This play mainly covers the story of Marshall's rise to fame in the law, describing his major lifetime accomplishments. It is sadly thin on his Supreme Court years because he did have a habit of simply concurring with Justice Stevens and nothing more. The play is happily thin on gimmickry, but I did not like the music competing with Fishburne's lines.I loved the way certain photographs were flashed on the giant screen behind Fishburne, but that wasn't overdone, either. It flavored and bolstered the performance. I cannot believe the discipline, the memory and the sheer nerve it takes to do something this powerful and unique. This is not Leonard Nimoy playing Vincent Van Gogh's brother in ""Theo"". It isn't John Gielgud in his one-man stage film SWAN SONG, but it's darned close.It is transcends an imaginary night with Thurgood Marshall; it isn't imaginary but it is 100% Fishburne. This is not the sort of thing I like at all. Some of my friends almost killed me for refusing to attend Hal Holbrook's portrayal of Mark Twain back when they brought the show here. I STILL would not go to a thing like that.Here I am sorry as hell that I missed being at JFK Center to see Lawrence Fishburne - and when you see this, you will be sorry you weren't there either. Marshall once said he'd ""live to be 110, then die ... shot by a jealous husband."" Fishburne delivers the line flawlessly, and we wish the longevity had been true for Marshall. Certainly for Fishburne, and no doubt for this film.Get this DVD and always have the next best thing. Remember also that you will be seeing something unique in modern cinema, something I hope we'll see productions companies do a LOT more often.",5,"""I'm going to live to be 100, and die from being shot by a jealous husband!""",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3030,"['THURGOOD', '2011', 'one', 'incredible', 'HBO', 'films', 'believe', 'synchronicity.I', 'have', 'always', 'complained', 'severe', 'problem', 'American', 'actors', 'have', 'never', 'confronted', 'audience', 'British', 'who', 'spend', 'years', 'performing', 'streets', 'Shakespeare', 'old', 'haunts', 'tiny', 'old', 'theaters', 'British', 'practically', 'lay', 'jump', 'audience', 'lap', 'Americans', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'audience', 'is.In', 'THURGOOD', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'whom', 'know', 'little', 'other', 'actor', 'love', 'USSC', 'Justice', 'Thurgood', 'Marshall', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'hero', 'father', 'Hoofing', 'onstage', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Center', 'live', 'audience', 'no', 'more', 'few', 'feet', 'Fishburne', 'awesome', 'one-man-play', 'film', 'such', 'cool', 'studied', 'professionalism', 'felt', 'was', 'actually', 'Marshall.But', 'know', 'Fishburne', 'amazing', 'talent', 'old', 'hobbled', 'recall', 'when', 'announced', 'retirement', 'Then', 'Fishburne', 'amazing', 'backward', 'twice', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'skill', 'Once', 'backward', 'middle', 'age', 'then', 'again', '30s', 'end', 'space', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'back', ""'old"", 'age', 'Marshall', 'spot-on', 'voice', 'gestures', 'jokes', 'foul', 'language', 'were', 'hallmarks', 'recall', 'very', 'well.This', 'play', 'mainly', 'story', 'Marshall', 'rise', 'fame', 'law', 'describing', 'major', 'lifetime', 'accomplishments', 'sadly', 'thin', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'years', 'did', 'have', 'habit', 'simply', 'concurring', 'Justice', 'Stevens', 'nothing', 'more', 'play', 'happily', 'thin', 'gimmickry', 'did', 'not', 'music', 'competing', 'Fishburne', 'lines.I', 'loved', 'way', 'certain', 'photographs', 'were', 'flashed', 'giant', 'screen', 'Fishburne', 'was', ""n't"", 'overdone', 'either', 'flavored', 'bolstered', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'discipline', 'memory', 'sheer', 'nerve', 'do', 'something', 'powerful', 'unique', 'not', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'playing', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'brother', 'Theo', ""n't"", 'John', 'Gielgud', 'one-man', 'stage', 'film', 'SWAN', 'SONG', 'darned', 'close.It', 'imaginary', 'night', 'Thurgood', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'imaginary', '100', '%', 'Fishburne', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'like', 'friends', 'almost', 'killed', 'refusing', 'attend', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'portrayal', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'back', 'when', 'brought', 'show', 'here', 'STILL', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'thing', 'that.Here', 'am', 'sorry', 'as', 'hell', 'missed', 'being', 'JFK', 'Center', 'see', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'when', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'either', 'Marshall', 'once', 'said', ""'d"", 'live', 'be', '110', 'then', 'die', 'shot', 'jealous', 'husband', 'Fishburne', 'line', 'flawlessly', 'wish', 'longevity', 'had', 'been', 'true', 'Marshall', 'Certainly', 'Fishburne', 'doubt', 'film.Get', 'DVD', 'always', 'have', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'Remember', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'something', 'unique', 'modern', 'cinema', 'something', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', 'productions', 'companies', 'do', 'LOT', 'more', 'often']",N/A
1414120,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004LROMXE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 20]","In staging a one man theatrical presentation, two things are certain--you've got to have a subject that is compelling enough to maintain interest and you've got to have a dynamic actor that holds an audience.  In HBO's filmed adaptation of the stage show ""Thurgood,"" we've got both!  Timed for airing with Black History Month, this dramatic monologue (filmed before a live audience) brings the best of theater right into your living room.  Thurgood Marshall is certainly a fascinating subject--from his early Civil Rights battles to his historical positioning in school segregation to his ascendancy to the Supreme Court, Marshall defied conventional expectations to become one of the most influential legal minds of several generations.  Laurence Fishburne (another terrific actor lately relegated to the rather uninspired world of procedural TV crime drama) has a field day bringing the charismatic Marshall to life.  It is certainly his most inspired and lively work in years.  So the winning combination of Marshall and Fishburne make ""Thurgood"" a can't miss proposition--especially to lovers of theater!Those completely new to the concept of a one man show should be aware that this is a piece that is reliant on words and performance.  Aside from a couple of props and a creatively used backdrop that sets any particular scene, there is nothing here to watch except for Fishburne.  So if you require extravagant production values or excessive visual stimulation, attending or watching a one man show may seem akin to watching grass grow.  But if you appreciate engaging and intelligent wordplay and enjoy relevant history or even down home storytelling, it's hard not to be caught up in this delightful presentation.  Marshall's life is played through its episodic high points (courtesy of a screenplay by George Stevens Jr.).  Some of the film's essential moments include the historic battle of Brown versus The Board of Education, descriptions of the division between state law and constitutional provisions, and the cantankerous Supreme Court years in which judicial appointments evolve with political changes.""Thurgood"" is, ultimately, quite successful in detailing Marshall's career highlights.  Personally, however, it is (by necessity and structure) a bit more superficial.  References to his home life and his wives are played for pathos and/or humor as the situation dictates, but we never really see that side of Marshall.  There are also plenty of comic asides that reference Marshall's wilder side--from drinking to an appreciation of women--that serve as levity points without being explored except as punchlines.  But the intent of the piece was not to be a full scale biographical treatment of an entire life--it is an evening with the fictional Marshall as he regales you with his stories interpreted through his voice.  As such, it is both informational and entertaining.  And really, that's all one could hope for...and all that is needed!

He made his mark in his compelling portrayal of a struggling African-American father with fierce integrity in Boyz In the Hood and since then he has more than become the consummate actor.  He has maintained an air of integrity around him and his characterizations regardless of the weaknesses seem to possess at the very least a measure of dignity.This performance can certainly be counted as an accomplishment.  Understanding of the world then is made very personal and thus very easy to relate to. Fisburne wonderfully exemplifies Marshall's strengths and poignantly reveals his weaknesses in this intriguing, very informative, difficult, colloquial, sad, and funny one-man show. The wonderful photography and sound effects combine to make for a compelling evening of theater.  Fishburne is in his element portraying the very human and ultimately exceptional example of leadership in the fight for civil rights.  I was a teenager when Marshall was appointed in the 60s and can assure you it was indeed a VERY tumultuous time.  It was eerie trying to celebrate and appreciate the magnitude of this progress while cities were going up in flames all around you.....and on a fairly regular basis......obviously this was far more than an excellent theater production for me.....but isn't this just what good art form is supposed to do?!! :0)I highly recommend this as not only an excellent one-man show with a tour-de-force performance but as more than a worthy addition to any movie library!
