We get that this was a big thing in Beijing, but I don't see why they had to zoom in on the audience's faces so much.",4,"Great DVD, too many audience shots.",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,400,"['bought', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'been', 'recording', 'show', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'had', 'seen', '2009', 'stage', 'setting', 'costumes', 'dance.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'audience', 'get', 'was', 'big', 'thing', 'Beijing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'had', 'zoom', 'audience', 'so', 'much']",N/A

Here are some observations (1) I still get tingles watching the most sensational acts, the finale for the first act, and the finale for the 2nd act, and then the reprise of the whole show directly afterward.  (2) There were a few things lost in translation to the video, (a) In the (new) battle between traditional tap dance and irish step dancing, the irish step dancers cross the stage ferociously, forcing the tappers off to the side of the stage, and this was lost by poor camera work, and secondarily, the tappers did some amazing toe-stands and 45-degree twirls that weren't really captured (or perhaps even performed) on the video.  This newer battle (vs original) between the tappers and steppers is a really cool modification of the original show.I noticed (and presumed) that many irish compositions had influenced top-10 american hit songs of the past 30 years, and I found myself wishing for dramatic new dance routines to be choreographed to some of these sensational irish-inspired american songs (or alternately, new dance numbers to some newer irish music would be equally welcome.)One great thing about the video is that it has close-ups of the leads, and they really are acting while they dance which is simply amazing.  And finally tonight, I reviewed the original 1995 show with michael flatley.  For me, the 1995 show was more amazing, but that's because nobody alive or dead can touch michael flatley for athleticism and flair and enthusiasm in hybrid irish/tap-dancing.  The present female riverdance lead is spectacularly beautiful and a great actor on this DVD, but for me, Jean Butler of the 1995 original is not only a red-headed wavy-haired celtic siren, but also dances with her arms straight down - not at her waist - which is waycool, and which looks different from the present production of riverdance.On the DVD, some of the cuts to the chinese-audience reactions were actually downers or laughter-inspiring, which I think detracted from the DVD's message.I went to the show hoping to see they had improved upon riverdance over the past 15 years.  I left - having felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up - at the same points today as 15 years ago when I first saw the show.  The DVD had some nice russian dances that weren't part of our live show, an arguable improvement.Nevertheless, I have to conclude that Michael Flatley was right - the present producers have produced a new flavor of the original menu, but nothing has been found to equal the top-3 pieces of the original Riverdance.  There were a few less choral pieces and a lot more violin and drum solos, and less dancing, sadly.  Thankfully, the original show was so strong it was still enjoyable to watch it again, albeit 15 years since the last time I saw it.  If you see this one first it might become your favorite, but for me, this show is like STAR WARS I, II, II vs. IV, V, VI ~ I have to reserve my 5-star rating for the Butler-Flatley version.",4,New flavor of an old favorite,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,3129,"['Well', 'saw', 'Riverdance', 'afternoon', 'Caterina', 'Coyne', 'Padraic', 'Moyles', 'bought', 'DVD', 'show', 'then', 'went', 'home', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'one', 'day', 'Here', 'are', 'observations', '1', 'still', 'get', 'tingles', 'watching', 'most', 'sensational', 'acts', 'finale', 'first', 'act', 'finale', '2nd', 'act', 'then', 'reprise', 'whole', 'show', 'directly', 'afterward', '2', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'lost', 'translation', 'video', 'new', 'battle', 'traditional', 'tap', 'dance', 'irish', 'step', 'dancing', 'irish', 'step', 'dancers', 'cross', 'stage', 'ferociously', 'forcing', 'tappers', 'side', 'stage', 'was', 'lost', 'poor', 'camera', 'work', 'secondarily', 'tappers', 'did', 'amazing', 'toe-stands', '45-degree', 'twirls', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'captured', 'perhaps', 'even', 'performed', 'video', 'newer', 'battle', 'vs', 'original', 'tappers', 'steppers', 'really', 'cool', 'modification', 'original', 'show.I', 'noticed', 'presumed', 'many', 'irish', 'compositions', 'had', 'influenced', 'top-10', 'american', 'hit', 'songs', 'past', '30', 'years', 'found', 'wishing', 'dramatic', 'new', 'dance', 'routines', 'be', 'choreographed', 'sensational', 'irish-inspired', 'american', 'songs', 'alternately', 'new', 'dance', 'numbers', 'newer', 'irish', 'music', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'welcome', 'One', 'great', 'thing', 'video', 'close-ups', 'leads', 'really', 'are', 'acting', 'dance', 'simply', 'amazing', 'finally', 'tonight', 'reviewed', 'original', '1995', 'show', 'michael', 'flatley', '1995', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'amazing', 'nobody', 'alive', 'dead', 'can', 'touch', 'michael', 'flatley', 'athleticism', 'flair', 'enthusiasm', 'hybrid', 'irish/tap-dancing', 'present', 'female', 'riverdance', 'lead', 'spectacularly', 'beautiful', 'great', 'actor', 'DVD', 'Jean', 'Butler', '1995', 'original', 'not', 'only', 'red-headed', 'wavy-haired', 'celtic', 'siren', 'also', 'arms', 'straight', 'down', 'not', 'waist', 'waycool', 'different', 'present', 'production', 'riverdance.On', 'DVD', 'cuts', 'chinese-audience', 'reactions', 'were', 'actually', 'downers', 'laughter-inspiring', 'think', 'detracted', 'DVD', 'message.I', 'went', 'show', 'hoping', 'see', 'had', 'improved', 'riverdance', 'past', '15', 'years', 'left', 'having', 'felt', 'hair', 'back', 'neck', 'stand', 'up', 'same', 'points', 'today', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'DVD', 'had', 'nice', 'russian', 'dances', 'were', ""n't"", 'part', 'live', 'show', 'arguable', 'improvement.Nevertheless', 'have', 'conclude', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'was', 'right', 'present', 'producers', 'have', 'produced', 'new', 'flavor', 'original', 'menu', 'nothing', 'been', 'found', 'equal', 'top-3', 'pieces', 'original', 'Riverdance', 'were', 'few', 'less', 'choral', 'pieces', 'lot', 'more', 'violin', 'drum', 'solos', 'less', 'dancing', 'sadly', 'Thankfully', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'again', '15', 'years', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'see', 'one', 'might', 'become', 'favorite', 'show', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'II', 'II', 'vs.', 'IV', 'V', 'VI', '~', 'have', 'reserve', '5-star', 'rating', 'Butler-Flatley', 'version']",N/A
