1539846,A2TFZFXKRWN94L,B007Y6CTBG,Adam Porter Demshar,"[1, 5]",I usually really like Morgan Spurlock films.  This one however needs to have every copy collected up and burned to save his reputation.  The characters that are examined are extremes and all too often total wierdos.  Why do I want to sit and watch a man who loves his beard more than mankind tell his self righteous story for 27 min?  Then you have the extreme Middle Eastern metro sexual.  It just gets too odd for me.  My advice is to forget you ever even heard of this piece.,1,This goes from odd territory to the totally bizare,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,478,"['usually', 'really', 'like', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'films', 'one', 'however', 'have', 'copy', 'collected', 'up', 'burned', 'save', 'reputation', 'characters', 'are', 'examined', 'are', 'extremes', 'too', 'often', 'total', 'wierdos', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'sit', 'watch', 'man', 'who', 'beard', 'more', 'mankind', 'tell', 'self', 'righteous', 'story', '27', 'min', 'Then', 'have', 'extreme', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'metro', 'sexual', 'just', 'too', 'odd', 'advice', 'forget', 'ever', 'even', 'heard', 'piece']",Mansome

1539848,A2R5VKE4YO966D,B007Y6CTBG,Charles Curtis,"[4, 4]","Not Spurlock's best work.  If you want an actual engagement offering perspective upon masculinity and maleness, the existential condition of the western man at the dawn of the 21st century or whateverhaveyou, this is not your film.  It's really just a series of somewhat superficial vignettes concerning facial and body hair, and personal grooming.  These are interspersed with that sort of spritely wry running ad-libbed commentary you'd expect from Jud Aptow's stable of comedic talent - Aptow himself, Rudd, Galifianakis, Bateman, and company - and this comedic horseplay is really the only reason to see this film. I enjoyed it, but it's thin gruel given what Spurlock could have done with the subject. I was hoping for something like what Chris Rock did with Afro-American hair culture in ""Good Hair"" - that film is excellent, really fascinating. This by comparison is mediocre, frankly quite disappointing. There's really no especial insight into gender, sexuality or culture here at all, which is what I expected and had hoped would be forthcoming. I've thought some of Spurlock's earlier stuff like ""Super Size Me"" and ""The Greatest Movie Ever Sold"" to be rather insightful, if gimmicky. This is neither clever in that trademark gimmicky sense, nor especially educational.  Still, if Rudd, Galifiankis, Bateman and that crew goofing off for the camera sounds like fun, you might still enjoy this.[Additional thought, 4/5/13]I've been mulling this film since last night, and it seems to me that this is the least personal effort that I've seen Spurlock make. I've seen quite a bit of his stuff, and he almost always is the pivotal character in his productions, being the sort of everyman narrator and gentle inquisitor who puts himself into an interesting situation (for 30 days typically, that's his schtick) and lets the story happen to him. Here, he appears only briefly, where he shaves off his iconic mustache to raise money for ""Movember"" prostate cancer research. He isn't even clearly the interviewer in most of the rest of the film. It's like he just stuck a bunch of his new found celebrity friends in front of the camera and then shot a bunch of footage about guys growing and trimming facial hair. I'm thinking this is its own slovenly commentary on what's become masculinity in this culture. You get a bunch of adolescent-retarded celebrities whose personas have been frozen since sophomore year college when they did this same comic schtick for their friends at their frat parties, and then a film about the one non-controversial thing about maleness left a college educated post-feminist guy in this culture: growing hair on his body and face while losing it on his head.  It's come to the point that the only way guys can assert their maleness without causing waves these days is through grooming their hair. It's the one gender distinctive that a guy like Spurlock can vigorously assert without pissing his hip vegan wife off.I'm not saying I'm much different than Spurlock, here. I'm not Robert Bly, and I don't have a chip on my shoulder about gender, or a coherent theory of gender myself. But I know this: a film about gender these days that is any good would be offensive to many people and would be compelling.  It would be deeply reactive, and this piece is not. We've gone from Don Draper and Sinatra to ""Sex in the City"" and ""Girls"" in two generations. What the heck has just happened?  That's an intense and vertigo inducing shift there, and nobody's got anything interesting to say about it?  All we can do is dish anodyne nonsense like this about it? Words like feminist, androgyny, misanthropy, misandry, eros and do not occur in this film.  How come?  Come on. Spurlock is okay when he is goring oxen acceptable to his cultural class. George Bush and corporations can be safely mocked and dissected.  But when he crosses into territory where the truth might lead him to examine and say things that might upset his groovy Brooklynite friends he pulls all his punches and becomes insipid and lazy. Poor show.  Too bad.",3,"light, mildly amusing",1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,4054,"['Not', 'Spurlock', 'best', 'work', 'want', 'actual', 'engagement', 'offering', 'perspective', 'masculinity', 'maleness', 'existential', 'condition', 'western', 'man', 'dawn', '21st', 'century', 'whateverhaveyou', 'not', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'series', 'somewhat', 'superficial', 'vignettes', 'concerning', 'facial', 'body', 'hair', 'personal', 'grooming', 'are', 'interspersed', 'sort', 'spritely', 'wry', 'running', 'ad-libbed', 'commentary', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Jud', 'Aptow', 'stable', 'comedic', 'talent', 'Aptow', 'Rudd', 'Galifianakis', 'Bateman', 'company', 'comedic', 'horseplay', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'thin', 'gruel', 'given', 'what', 'Spurlock', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'subject', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'what', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'did', 'Afro-American', 'hair', 'culture', 'Good', 'Hair', 'film', 'excellent', 'really', 'fascinating', 'comparison', 'mediocre', 'frankly', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'really', 'especial', 'insight', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'culture', 'here', 'what', 'expected', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'forthcoming', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'Spurlock', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'Greatest', 'Movie', 'Ever', 'Sold', 'be', 'rather', 'insightful', 'gimmicky', 'clever', 'trademark', 'gimmicky', 'sense', 'especially', 'educational', 'Still', 'Rudd', 'Galifiankis', 'Bateman', 'crew', 'goofing', 'off', 'camera', 'fun', 'might', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Additional', 'thought', '4/5/13', ']', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mulling', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'least', 'personal', 'effort', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Spurlock', 'make', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'bit', 'stuff', 'almost', 'always', 'pivotal', 'character', 'productions', 'being', 'sort', 'everyman', 'narrator', 'gentle', 'inquisitor', 'who', 'interesting', 'situation', '30', 'days', 'typically', 'schtick', 'story', 'happen', 'Here', 'only', 'briefly', 'where', 'iconic', 'mustache', 'raise', 'money', 'Movember', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'research', ""n't"", 'even', 'clearly', 'interviewer', 'most', 'rest', 'film', 'just', 'stuck', 'bunch', 'new', 'found', 'celebrity', 'friends', 'front', 'camera', 'then', 'shot', 'bunch', 'footage', 'guys', 'growing', 'trimming', 'facial', 'hair', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'own', 'slovenly', 'commentary', 'what', 'become', 'masculinity', 'culture', 'get', 'bunch', 'adolescent-retarded', 'celebrities', 'personas', 'have', 'been', 'frozen', 'sophomore', 'year', 'college', 'when', 'did', 'same', 'comic', 'schtick', 'friends', 'frat', 'parties', 'then', 'film', 'one', 'non-controversial', 'thing', 'maleness', 'left', 'college', 'educated', 'post-feminist', 'guy', 'culture', 'growing', 'hair', 'body', 'face', 'losing', 'head', 'come', 'point', 'only', 'way', 'guys', 'can', 'assert', 'maleness', 'causing', 'waves', 'days', 'grooming', 'hair', 'one', 'gender', 'distinctive', 'guy', 'Spurlock', 'can', 'vigorously', 'assert', 'pissing', 'hip', 'vegan', 'wife', 'off.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'m"", 'much', 'different', 'Spurlock', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'Robert', 'Bly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'gender', 'coherent', 'theory', 'gender', 'know', 'film', 'gender', 'days', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'offensive', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'compelling', 'would', 'be', 'deeply', 'reactive', 'piece', 'not', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Sinatra', 'Sex', 'City', 'Girls', 'two', 'generations', 'What', 'heck', 'just', 'happened', 'intense', 'vertigo', 'inducing', 'shift', 'there', 'nobody', 'got', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'can', 'do', 'dish', 'anodyne', 'nonsense', 'Words', 'feminist', 'androgyny', 'misanthropy', 'misandry', 'eros', 'do', 'not', 'occur', 'film', 'How', 'come', 'Come', 'Spurlock', 'okay', 'when', 'goring', 'oxen', 'acceptable', 'cultural', 'class', 'George', 'Bush', 'corporations', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'mocked', 'dissected', 'when', 'territory', 'where', 'truth', 'might', 'lead', 'examine', 'say', 'things', 'might', 'upset', 'groovy', 'Brooklynite', 'punches', 'insipid', 'lazy', 'Poor', 'show', 'Too', 'bad']",Mansome

The only thing this movie does is make men want to pamper themselves more like a gay, which IS NOT and will NEVER be what being a man is about because being a man is about having purpose, drive, and building the ability to create in that purpose.  NOT pampering yourself like a woman.  This side of being a man is never looked at in the movie though it is the evolutionary FACT.

I was on the fence until I noticed it was a Morgan Spurlock film.

I realize I felt let down because I was looking for something as engrossing as, say, that episode of THIRTY DAYS where Spurlock tries to live on a salary of minimum wage for a month.  Instead, I should have appreciated MANSOME for being MANSOME, an offbeat look at the trend in appearance-centered men.Also, it could be that MANSOME made me and other reviewers (most of the 14 preceding me do not like the film) uneasy, showing us men putting as much effort into their looks as women do.  The film's most memorable segment covers beard competition champion Jack Passion, and while a facial hair contest is not to a woman's beauty pageant what male go-go dancers are to female dancers, nonetheless I think the concept of a man using his appearance to further himself could reveal your prejudice.
