Not a bit of exaggeration, unfortunately.""Shout! Factory has taken this classic series, originally recorded on tape, and TRANSFERRED IT TO FILM. That alone completely destroys the integrity of the original episodes--but don't worry: they didn't stop there. They ""enhanced"" it. Kind of like the way going to the bathroom ""enhances"" one's toilet. They have HD'ed or 3-D'ed this thing to death. The result: a comedy that would've scared Hitchcock: it looks like a cartoon that's been filmed in stop-action animation--like bad Claymation. Also, the actors' body parts frequently appear to be out of proportion with one another, and the actors themselves frequently appear out of proportion with each other. (You gotta see it to believe it.) It's the creepiest, most bizarre thing I have ever seen; I can only describe the final product as grotesque.""And these reviewers here who say it's a great picture-- they are simply nearly blind, or uncaring, non-discerning people at all.  Sure, ""underneath,"" it looks like it came from great-quality masters, BUT THEN those were made into film or worse, with the wrong frames count-per second.  Watch the closing credits and EVERYBODY would agree this transfer is horrible.  The first 6 seasons were beautifully done by Sony; but this one is garbage video quality.This show was produced every year on video tape and that's why the picture quality ALWAYS looked so ""new.""  Whereas this 7th Season looks like film, and at the wrong speed.The only worse product is Shout! Factory's ""Room 222"" (both seasons 1 and 2 so far), but at least they warn you on those packages that they didn't get the greatest master tapes to start with.  Here, For ""All In The Family"" Seventh Season, this tape mastering job is ATROCIOUS.  Go tape the reruns of ""All In The Family"" 7th Season off of TV Land yourself-- literally, use VHS tapes, not even DVDs-- and you'll still have better VIDEO quality than this junk.I wish it wasn't so.  I had looked forward to this season very much and waited a long time for it.WILL SHOUT!

1089105,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000TD0PHG,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","This is an interesting 7th chapter of AITF. By season 6, the neighbors the Jeffersons have moved away, and Michael and Gloria had moved into the Jeffersons' house. This is an interesting change in that Michael + Gloria are now neighbors. Sometimes the story takes place at Archie's, and sometimes at Mike and Gloria's.It is interesting that there are notably less political issues in this season and more heart. While Archie has never much liked Spanish people, he allows a Spanish medical student Theresa to stay with them until she finishes her school. And when he thinks she is being threatened, Archie violently protects her.The ""Draft Dodger"" has Archie in an especially angry state when he finds out Michael has invited a draft dodger to dinner. ""Archie's Chair"" is a sentimental but understandable episode in that Archie can NOT part with his chair even for more money than the chair is worth. ""Mike + Gloria Split"" is an interesting episdoe where Michael and Gloria have a fight, and Archie has to very simply explain what the problem is.""Mike the Pacifist"" is an especially interesting episdoe in that on a subway, Michael hates himself for punching someone. But Archie and Gloria have to explain to him that his actions were understandable in that the man shoved Gloria. (The wall between Michael + Archie is starting to break down.) We also find ourselves starting to go along with Archie's dislikes when he points out the hypcrisy of certain professions. (Medical + Legal)Archie's most shining moment here is probably in ""The Unemployment Story"" when he has to stop a man from jumping off a building and thus killing himself.What makes this 7th chapter of Archie's journey interesting is that not only are there less politics, but we find ourselves siding more with Archie now: ""This guy is going to spend a week of taxpayer money, to write a letter and inform the guy that fired me that I'm out of work.""At this 7th chapter, the series is different, but in some ways a little more interesting.",3,Interesting Change of Formula,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,2006,"['interesting', '7th', 'chapter', 'AITF', 'season', '6', 'neighbors', 'Jeffersons', 'have', 'moved', 'away', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'had', 'moved', 'Jeffersons', 'house', 'interesting', 'change', 'Michael', '+', 'Gloria', 'are', 'now', 'neighbors', 'Sometimes', 'story', 'place', 'Archie', 'sometimes', 'Mike', ""Gloria's.It"", 'interesting', 'are', 'notably', 'less', 'political', 'issues', 'season', 'more', 'heart', 'Archie', 'never', 'much', 'liked', 'Spanish', 'people', 'Spanish', 'medical', 'student', 'Theresa', 'stay', 'school', 'when', 'being', 'threatened', 'Archie', 'violently', 'her.The', 'Draft', 'Dodger', 'Archie', 'especially', 'angry', 'state', 'when', 'out', 'Michael', 'invited', 'draft', 'dodger', 'dinner', 'Archie', 'Chair', 'sentimental', 'understandable', 'episode', 'Archie', 'can', 'NOT', 'part', 'chair', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'chair', 'worth', 'Mike', '+', 'Gloria', 'Split', 'interesting', 'episdoe', 'where', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'have', 'fight', 'Archie', 'very', 'simply', 'explain', 'what', 'problem', 'Pacifist', 'especially', 'interesting', 'episdoe', 'subway', 'Michael', 'punching', 'someone', 'Archie', 'Gloria', 'have', 'explain', 'actions', 'were', 'understandable', 'man', 'shoved', 'Gloria', 'wall', 'Michael', '+', 'Archie', 'starting', 'break', 'down', 'also', 'find', 'starting', 'go', 'along', 'Archie', 'dislikes', 'when', 'out', 'hypcrisy', 'certain', 'professions', 'Medical', '+', 'Legal', 'Archie', 'most', 'shining', 'moment', 'here', 'probably', 'Unemployment', 'Story', 'when', 'stop', 'man', 'jumping', 'off', 'building', 'thus', 'killing', 'himself.What', '7th', 'chapter', 'Archie', 'journey', 'interesting', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'less', 'politics', 'find', 'siding', 'more', 'Archie', 'now', 'guy', 'going', 'spend', 'week', 'taxpayer', 'money', 'write', 'letter', 'inform', 'guy', 'fired', ""'m"", 'work', '7th', 'chapter', 'series', 'different', 'ways', 'little', 'more', 'interesting']",N/A

Sanford and Son's 6th and final season ranked a mere #27, compared to the #2 success of its heyday. Maude, now in its fifth season, had fallen out of the Top 30 after 4 seasons of Top 10 success and would be cancelled the following season. Good Times, now in its 4th season, was clinging onto the lower reaches of the Top 30 at #26, and All In The Family, after five straight seasons at #1, slipped to #12 (Happy Days became #1 this season). This was partly because in those post-Vietnam times, audiences wanted something more lightweight and less topical on TV, which they got in the form of Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley and Three's Company amongst others.1.

1089110,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B000TD0PHG,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","Like the previous six seasons, Season 7 of ""All in the Family"" continued the tradition of what was perhaps the funniest half hour on American television during the 1970s. (""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" was equally funny, perhaps funnier, but that wasn't American TV.) By this point all the main characters had matured and developed, and the cast members were at their peak. Edith had become more assertive and Archie more mellow.This is the season when Archie endures an extended bout of unemployment and went into the hospital during this time for an operation, only to discover that the surgeon is a black woman. As a further twist in this episode, Archie has a rare blood type, and the surgeon offers to donate hers. (Which leads to Archie's hilarious line about being concerned that her ""black shemoglobins"" would mix with his ""white hemoglobins."")During this season Edith arranges to have Teresa,a Puerto Rican who had been the admissions nurse at the hospital where Archie had his operation to board in the spare bedroom (that had become available because Mike and Gloria had moved out), a move that allows for some great dialogue between Archie and Teresa. (Like the episode where Archie insists that Teresa talk about ""chicken chests"" rather than ""chicken breasts."")On a more poignant note, ""The Draft Dodger"" episode, which takes place around the dinner table at Christmas, involves Pinky Higgins, a friend of Archie's who has lost his son in Vietnam, and a friend of Mike's, who had fled to Canada to avoid the draft. When Archie finds out that Mike's friend is a draft dodger, he is incensed. However, the situation is defused when Pinky Higgins welcomes Mike's friend to remain, shakes his hand, and refers to him as ""son.""This is also the season when Stretch Cunningham dies and the family requests that Archie deliver a eulogy (or, as Archie would call it, a ""urology"") at Stretch's funeral. Only when he and Edith arrive at the funeral parlor do they discover that Stretch was Jewish. This leads Archie to forego his prepared eulogy (because of its Christian references) and deliver a bizarrely funny impromptu speech that manages to convey Archie's love for Stretch despite is several faux pas.All in all, some of the best episodes of the entire nine years are in Season 7.",5,The greatness continues,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,2290,"['previous', 'six', 'seasons', 'Season', '7', 'Family', 'continued', 'tradition', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'half', 'hour', 'American', 'television', '1970s', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', 'was', 'equally', 'funny', 'perhaps', 'funnier', 'was', ""n't"", 'American', 'TV', 'point', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'matured', 'developed', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'peak', 'Edith', 'had', 'become', 'more', 'assertive', 'Archie', 'more', 'mellow.This', 'season', 'when', 'Archie', 'extended', 'bout', 'unemployment', 'went', 'hospital', 'time', 'operation', 'only', 'discover', 'surgeon', 'black', 'woman', 'further', 'twist', 'episode', 'Archie', 'rare', 'blood', 'type', 'surgeon', 'donate', 'hers', 'Which', 'Archie', 'hilarious', 'line', 'being', 'concerned', 'black', 'shemoglobins', 'would', 'mix', 'white', 'hemoglobins', 'season', 'Edith', 'have', 'Teresa', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'admissions', 'nurse', 'hospital', 'where', 'Archie', 'had', 'operation', 'board', 'spare', 'bedroom', 'had', 'become', 'available', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'had', 'moved', 'out', 'move', 'great', 'dialogue', 'Archie', 'Teresa', 'episode', 'where', 'Archie', 'Teresa', 'talk', 'chicken', 'chests', 'rather', 'chicken', 'breasts', 'more', 'poignant', 'note', 'Draft', 'Dodger', 'episode', 'place', 'dinner', 'table', 'Christmas', 'Pinky', 'Higgins', 'friend', 'Archie', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'Vietnam', 'friend', 'Mike', 'who', 'had', 'fled', 'Canada', 'avoid', 'draft', 'When', 'Archie', 'out', 'Mike', 'friend', 'draft', 'dodger', 'incensed', 'However', 'situation', 'defused', 'when', 'Pinky', 'Higgins', 'Mike', 'friend', 'remain', 'shakes', 'hand', 'refers', 'son', 'also', 'season', 'when', 'Stretch', 'Cunningham', 'dies', 'family', 'Archie', 'deliver', 'eulogy', 'Archie', 'would', 'call', 'urology', 'Stretch', 'funeral', 'Only', 'when', 'Edith', 'arrive', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'do', 'discover', 'Stretch', 'was', 'Jewish', 'Archie', 'forego', 'prepared', 'eulogy', 'Christian', 'references', 'deliver', 'bizarrely', 'funny', 'impromptu', 'speech', 'convey', 'Archie', 'love', 'Stretch', 'several', 'faux', 'pas.All', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'nine', 'years', 'are', 'Season', '7']",N/A

Season starts off with Archie's near-affair with a waitress, a 3-parter that was a lot funnier than it sounds. Mike and Gloria's Miss America competition imitation in ""The Baby Contest"" is real genius, showing those two at their talented best - at other times, M & G can sometimes get on my nerves with their constant bickering.  ""Beverly Rides Again"", in which Beverly the drag queen that Archie saved in a previous season (not knowing she was a he) comes to visit.  The guys at Kelsey's play some good practical jokes on Archie and later its Archie's turn to pull one on them when Beverly shows up. ""The Draft Dodger"" is a more poignant episode when one of Mike's old draft dodging buddies steals back into the States from Canada to spend Christmas with the Bunkers.  The show still seems to be going quite strong even in its 7th season.In terms of visuals on the DVD, I didn't think things were near as serious as some reviewers made them out to be.  Worst was the opening and closing credits sequences in which the tape transfer doesn't look that great, but I didn't notice THAT much difference between this and other seasons in film quality during most of the actual episodes.  Perhaps a little, but not enough to keep me from enjoying the show.Yes, the packaging on these Shout editions is kind of cheap compared to the Season 1 - 6 original Sony editions which folded out and had a dust cover - that was quality packaging.

This should not happen with a high quality transfer from the original 35 mm tapes to DVD.

If Shout reads this, please contact me as I am really disappointed and feel that I wasted my money. Or send me a DVD set when you correct the video transfer, to replace the one I bought.

While it doesn't solve the problem completely, it certainly makes the episodes much more watchable.That being said, I haven't seen many of these shows in decades and am surprised how many are better than I remember.We get less of Gloria and Meathead this season but Archie and Edith are still able to carry the show without them.O'Connor and Stapleton are still delivering on all counts and in no way are yet phoning it in. Check out the waiting room scene in ""Archie's Operation"" where Edith peruses a Playgirl mag.

While previous seasons of this show on dvd look the same as they did on tv and retained that 70's feel to it, this season looks to have some sorta ""movement problem"".

That's over 2 years now! We're talkingabout a show that was the NUMBER ONE SHOW on TV fromseasons 2 - season 6. That's FIVE STRAIGHT SEASONS.All In The Family did drop out of the top ten duringseason 7 but was still a popular show, so i don't seeany reason why the last 3 seasons can't be released,unless it's because season 6 didn't sell well (whichwould be unfortunate!)Season 7 did have some GOOD EPISODES. This is the seasonin which Archie had a brief fling with an attractivewaitress. Another two-part episode where Archie has tohave an operation and his nurse is African-American(HILARIOUS!,Might be my favorite of the season.) Archie also has todeliver a eulogy after his friend (Stretch Cunningham fromwork) dies suddenly. Might be the funniest eulogy you wouldever hear at a funeral.I got numerous episodes from the last three seasons on ColumbiaHOUSE home videos, but there is still several episodes that havenever even seen before, EVER, so I got an itching to own therest of the series.Please SONY, get your act together and release seasons 7,8,& 9so us fans can enjoy them. I will definitely go buy them thefirst week their out.P.S. The one star rating is because it's taking so long for thesets to come out.",1,My Favorite HALF-HOUR SHOW - WHAT'S THE HOLD UP!!,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,1342,"['been', 'February', '2007', 'Season', '6', 'came', 'outso', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'alot', 'other', 'people', 'what', 'istaking', 'so', 'long', 'over', '2', 'years', 'now', ""'re"", 'show', 'was', 'NUMBER', 'ONE', 'SHOW', 'TV', 'fromseasons', '2', 'season', '6', 'FIVE', 'STRAIGHT', 'SEASONS.All', 'Family', 'did', 'drop', 'top', 'ten', 'duringseason', '7', 'was', 'still', 'popular', 'show', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'seeany', 'reason', 'why', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'released', 'season', '6', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'well', 'whichwould', 'be', 'unfortunate', 'Season', '7', 'did', 'have', 'GOOD', 'EPISODES', 'seasonin', 'Archie', 'had', 'brief', 'fling', 'attractivewaitress', 'two-part', 'episode', 'where', 'Archie', 'tohave', 'operation', 'nurse', 'African-American', 'HILARIOUS', 'Might', 'be', 'favorite', 'season', 'Archie', 'also', 'todeliver', 'eulogy', 'friend', 'Stretch', 'Cunningham', 'fromwork', 'suddenly', 'Might', 'be', 'funniest', 'eulogy', 'wouldever', 'hear', 'funeral.I', 'got', 'numerous', 'episodes', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'ColumbiaHOUSE', 'home', 'videos', 'still', 'several', 'episodes', 'havenever', 'even', 'seen', 'EVER', 'got', 'itching', 'own', 'therest', 'series.Please', 'SONY', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'release', 'seasons', '7,8', '9so', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'will', 'definitely', 'go', 'buy', 'thefirst', 'week', 'out.P.S', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'thesets', 'come', 'out']",N/A

Sure there are a couple of questionable character changes but I'm not complaining.

Though this season lacked the comedic bite of the first 4-5, it still is worthwhile to take a look at.The major shift in this seventh season is a (general) move away from the heated Archie/Meathead political ""debates"" and towards more societal/family matters, such as grandson Joey, women's liberation, and even Archie and Edith's sex life.  I have to give kudos to Norman Lear for doing this, as he realized that using the ""same old rhetoric"" just wouldn't work.Here's the problem: those societal issues just aren't as funny as the political stuff.  Archie vs. Mike was the stuff of legend, while the more personal topics are interesting, but don't provide that laugh-out-loud punch.  At times it is there, but those moments are much too few and far between.I liken it to ""The Office"" in terms of quality.  The first 4-5 seasons of that show were pure hilarity, a sixth was spotty, and (beginning with the seventh) it started to lose its gold standard.  That is almost EXACTLY the pattern of this show as well.However, it did not decrease to a point where I won't be purchasing the eighth go-'round early next year or anything like that.  I'll still be around to watch the Bunker/Stivic hilarity.",3,"Less Politics, More Heart",1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1388,"['First', 'let', 'just', 'note', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'seventh', 'season', 'All', 'Family', 'was', 'released', 'long', 'wait', 'production', 'company', 'shift', 'season', 'six', 'season', 'lacked', 'comedic', 'bite', 'first', '4-5', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'take', 'look', 'major', 'shift', 'seventh', 'season', 'general', 'move', 'away', 'heated', 'Archie/Meathead', 'political', 'debates', 'towards', 'more', 'societal/family', 'matters', 'such', 'grandson', 'Joey', 'women', 'liberation', 'even', 'Archie', 'Edith', 'sex', 'life', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'doing', 'realized', 'using', 'same', 'old', 'rhetoric', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'work.Here', 'problem', 'societal', 'issues', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'political', 'stuff', 'Archie', 'Mike', 'was', 'stuff', 'legend', 'more', 'personal', 'topics', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'provide', 'laugh-out-loud', 'punch', 'times', 'there', 'moments', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'between.I', 'Office', 'terms', 'quality', 'first', '4-5', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', 'pure', 'hilarity', 'sixth', 'was', 'spotty', 'beginning', 'seventh', 'started', 'lose', 'gold', 'standard', 'almost', 'EXACTLY', 'pattern', 'show', 'well.However', 'did', 'not', 'decrease', 'point', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'purchasing', 'eighth', ""go-'round"", 'early', 'next', 'year', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'watch', 'Bunker/Stivic', 'hilarity']",N/A
