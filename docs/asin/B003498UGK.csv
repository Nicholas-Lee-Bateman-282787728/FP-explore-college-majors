They have action and some of the scenes are very exhilarating.  This is the only way I want to see this type of storm however - vicariously!  I'm sure we'll watch them many times in the future.,5,Fun movies,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,291,"['was', 'disaster-movie', 'Christmas', 'got', 'quite', 'few', 'one', 'favorites', 'have', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'exhilarating', 'only', 'way', 'want', 'see', 'type', 'storm', 'however', 'vicariously', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'future']",N/A
1321176,ABARNA66MT43U,B003498UGK,Bonemonkey,"[0, 0]","This low budget disaster of a movie never really stood a chance. The storyline is questionable, the acting is pretty abysmal, and the special effects are just plain awful. The only real disaster is that someone actually agreed to finance it in the first place. I'm sure that a lot of the budget went on pumping the cast full of very strong coffee as most of the time they just stare bug-eyed at some far off point in the distance when they are supposed to be looking scared. Either that or they blurt out their lines and stutter through what should be emotional moments like it was the first time they had read the script. It does have some unintentional comedy moments but not enough to take it into the &#34;so bad it's good&#34; category.The storyline goes - some scientists are trying to control the weather. They want to be able to make it rain in places where it doesn't usually rain. They decide to build a thousand flying weather robots (as you would do) and then send them off do their thing. Not surprisingly, the plan backfires and lots of huge ice twisters start appearing without warning, killing men on tractors. The biggest danger if you are near an ice twister is getting squashed by a flying car - the flying car will ALWAYS try to land on the nearest person. All the scientists can do is say that they need help to save the town. Luckily, a weather disaster fiction writer (who also used to be a scientist, and who worked with these exact scientists before he quit) is in town. He manages to dive out of the way of a flying car and then dusts him self off and agrees to help them save the planet. So this new super-team go from place to place only to arrive and put the kettle on, but then suddenly see that an ice twister is forming above their heads, and have to run to their cars and drive away - sometimes through the middle of an ice twister (this is possible as long as you drive into it at the correct speed and angle). The less important cast members gradually get killed off along the way leaving the rest to knock on the door of the satellite control room (which is also in town) and tell them that they have a plan. They are going to blast a hole in the ozone layer. Yes, that's the plan. The heat that comes through the hole will heat up the atmosphere and melt the ice twisters before they can start doing their thing. There are some tense moments while everyone tries (and fails) to look concerned. Suddenly all the ice twisters start to vanish. The scientists all start cheering. The sun comes out and although they still haven't solved the problem of the global water crisis and have caused the deaths of hundreds of men on tractors, not to mention the millions of pounds of collateral damage, they all realize that they are happy to be alive. They all decide to get married.

This one I watched 3 times (one other I watched 2x - and the rest weren't really worth having watched even one time).It does takes the 2nd time to appreciate it. The first time it does seem a bit piecemeal and one wonders where they are going. But the 2x already know the characters and what their goals and agendas - then can concentrate on the action and the interaction - and it was very enjoyable.The storms/disaster scenes were quite short - but there were good effects in them.This is a science Fiction movie - it isn't meant to be factual about what can happen - but this had a few good points to make nonetheless.Passed it on to my sister who also enjoyed it - the action moves fast enough to keep one interested throughout (once the characters are all in place),4,One of the Better disaster movies,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,863,"['decided', 'do', 'marathon', 'disaster', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'out', 'one', 'watched', '3', 'times', 'one', 'other', 'watched', '2x', 'rest', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'having', 'watched', 'even', 'one', 'time', '.It', '2nd', 'time', 'appreciate', 'first', 'time', 'seem', 'bit', 'piecemeal', 'one', 'wonders', 'where', 'are', 'going', '2x', 'already', 'know', 'characters', 'what', 'goals', 'agendas', 'then', 'can', 'concentrate', 'action', 'interaction', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable.The', 'storms/disaster', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'short', 'were', 'good', 'effects', 'them.This', 'science', 'Fiction', 'movie', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'factual', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'had', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'make', 'nonetheless.Passed', 'sister', 'who', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'action', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'one', 'interested', 'characters', 'are', 'place']",N/A
