167109,A3M0FYS0JDJJTM,0934837163,John from Virginia,"[8, 8]","I first saw this video while I was going to college back in the 80s. Before I saw it, I wasn't sure about abortion. An ex-girlfriend once asked me, ""are you for or against abortion?"" I honestly didn't know. I was confused. My mother used to tell me that abortion was equal killing a person. I thought, how can you kill a person who isn't born yet?The answer is: You can . . .  if that person has been concieved (concieved is when the sperm has fertilized the egg inside of the womb). This video clearified to an 20 year old young adult (me) what abortion is really about. It caused me to think about unborn children in a whole different way. It shows that the people saying that a fetus is a person are not just full of it. It is a fact that unborn babies are very much alive. I went on to find out that babies have a beating heart and measurable brain waves just 4 weeks after conception. After you see this video, you won't need religion to convince you that abortion is nothing but murder.There is a reviewer who states that ""real doctors"" on the planned parenthood website debunk this video. Those ""doctors"" are themselves full of bunk. #1 There is nothing in this video that convinces me that it is fake. #2 The person that made this video was himself an abortion doctor for a very long time. He was horrified when the techonology of ultra sound came along and he actually saw the babies being killed inside the womb. He was honest enough to realize that this was nothing but murder and decided to educate the world about it. He could have kept it a secret, as the majority of abortion ""doctors"" have, and continued with his murderous occupation. He didn't because the man actually has a heart.Planned Parenthood and the abortion community don't like this video for a very good reason. Its bad for business. When you educate people, the thugs and scoundrels of the world are those who will suffer. Abortion doctors are the thugs of the Medical community. They know what they are doing is nothing but murder, yet they keep on doing what they do. They and organizations like Planned Parenthood lie and mislead young girls into thinking that this is a very healthy procedure. They don't inform them about the psychological and health risks associated with abortion . . . and they absolutely do not tell them that the baby that is inside of them is very much alive. In fact their claims in the media say that the opposite is true.Lets cut through the BS and address the 800 pound gorilla in the room . . . the abortion movement is not about a ""woman's right to choose,"" its not about women who have life threatening complications during their pregnancies or women who are pregnant as a result of rape as abortion proponents love to claim (These are rare examples as compared to the rest of abortion cases and the public on all sides is very sympathetic to these women anyway what ever their decision is). The real drive behind the abortion movement is for women and men to be able to be promiscious, to have sex with no boundries, as often as they want, without contraception and without consequences. Its all about the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s. There are consequences, however: #1 a murdered baby. #2 A woman who has the high risk of phychological problems including acute depression from aborting her baby especially if she realizes that she elected to murder her baby, #3 A woman who may have massive health complications due to the aborting of her baby.I could go on for ever on this subject but will leave with you with one last thing . . . Abortion doctors are technically not doctors at all. The very oath that they take (The Hippocratic Oath) prohibits abortion because even Hipporcrates(the ancient father of medicine) realized that abortion is nothing other than the sadistic murder,  dismemberment and disrespectful disgarding of the body of a baby. The baby's only crime being that it is not born yet and that it is not wanted.",5,Changed my view of abortion years ago.,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,3952,"['first', 'saw', 'video', 'was', 'going', 'college', 'back', '80s', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'abortion', 'ex-girlfriend', 'once', 'asked', 'are', 'abortion', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'confused', 'mother', 'used', 'tell', 'abortion', 'was', 'equal', 'killing', 'person', 'thought', 'how', 'can', 'kill', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'born', 'yet', 'answer', 'can', 'person', 'been', 'concieved', 'concieved', 'when', 'sperm', 'fertilized', 'egg', 'womb', 'video', 'clearified', '20', 'year', 'old', 'young', 'adult', 'what', 'abortion', 'really', 'about', 'caused', 'think', 'unborn', 'children', 'whole', 'different', 'way', 'people', 'saying', 'fetus', 'person', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'full', 'fact', 'unborn', 'babies', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'went', 'find', 'out', 'babies', 'have', 'beating', 'heart', 'measurable', 'brain', 'waves', 'just', '4', 'weeks', 'conception', 'see', 'video', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'religion', 'convince', 'abortion', 'nothing', 'murder.There', 'reviewer', 'who', 'real', 'doctors', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'website', 'debunk', 'video', 'doctors', 'are', 'full', 'bunk', '1', 'nothing', 'video', 'fake', '2', 'person', 'made', 'video', 'was', 'abortion', 'doctor', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'horrified', 'when', 'techonology', 'ultra', 'sound', 'came', 'along', 'actually', 'saw', 'babies', 'being', 'killed', 'womb', 'was', 'honest', 'enough', 'realize', 'was', 'nothing', 'murder', 'decided', 'educate', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'secret', 'majority', 'abortion', 'doctors', 'have', 'continued', 'murderous', 'occupation', 'did', ""n't"", 'man', 'actually', 'heart.Planned', 'Parenthood', 'abortion', 'community', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'bad', 'business', 'When', 'educate', 'people', 'thugs', 'scoundrels', 'world', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'suffer', 'Abortion', 'doctors', 'are', 'thugs', 'Medical', 'community', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'nothing', 'murder', 'yet', 'keep', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'organizations', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'lie', 'mislead', 'young', 'girls', 'thinking', 'very', 'healthy', 'procedure', 'do', ""n't"", 'inform', 'psychological', 'health', 'risks', 'associated', 'abortion', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'baby', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'fact', 'claims', 'media', 'say', 'opposite', 'true.Lets', 'cut', 'BS', 'address', '800', 'pound', 'gorilla', 'room', 'abortion', 'movement', 'not', 'woman', 'right', 'choose', 'not', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'life', 'threatening', 'complications', 'pregnancies', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'pregnant', 'result', 'rape', 'abortion', 'proponents', 'love', 'claim', 'are', 'rare', 'examples', 'compared', 'rest', 'abortion', 'cases', 'public', 'sides', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'women', 'anyway', 'what', 'ever', 'decision', 'real', 'drive', 'abortion', 'movement', 'women', 'men', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'promiscious', 'have', 'sex', 'boundries', 'as', 'often', 'want', 'contraception', 'consequences', 'sexual', 'revolution', '60s', '70s', 'are', 'consequences', 'however', '1', 'murdered', 'baby', '2', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'high', 'risk', 'phychological', 'problems', 'including', 'acute', 'depression', 'aborting', 'baby', 'especially', 'elected', 'murder', 'baby', '3', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'massive', 'health', 'complications', 'due', 'aborting', 'baby.I', 'could', 'go', 'ever', 'subject', 'will', 'leave', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'Abortion', 'doctors', 'are', 'technically', 'not', 'doctors', 'very', 'oath', 'take', 'Hippocratic', 'Oath', 'abortion', 'even', 'Hipporcrates', 'ancient', 'father', 'medicine', 'realized', 'abortion', 'nothing', 'other', 'sadistic', 'murder', 'dismemberment', 'disrespectful', 'disgarding', 'body', 'baby', 'baby', 'only', 'crime', 'being', 'not', 'born', 'yet', 'not', 'wanted']",N/A

167116,A2D4RUMDYEF0S5,0934837163,Thomas Foss,"[22, 39]","A reviewer has already posted the link to the Planned Parenthood site where this video is thoroughly debunked by real doctors and scientists. I recommend looking at it, no matter what your feelings are about abortion.The very premise of this movie is horrendously flawed. A fetus's lungs are filled with fluid. It has no way to ""scream,"" silent or otherwise. Furthermore, and this is the really important fact, 12-week-old fetuses do not have cerebral cortices, do not have myelinated neurons, and have not developed synapse connections between those neurons. Nerve signals do not transmit; they literally cannot feel pain, because they have no way of getting the signal from still-developing pain-receptive nerves to the brain.There may be good arguments against abortion. None of those arguments are presented in this film. Facts are twisted and ignored, editing and omission are used to provoke inaccurate responses from the viewer, and the abortion methods used here were archaic in the mid-80s, and are unthinkable now. Nathanson uses a series of gruesome images, half-truths, and arguments from pathos to try to disgust you into taking his side.Pro- and Anti-abortion people all ought to be ashamed of this film. Pro-Abortion because it is a series of poorly-constructed anti-abortion strawmen stacked upon one another, Anti-Abortion because Nathanson's arguments lack any sort of rhetorical substance, and are furthermore outdated.
