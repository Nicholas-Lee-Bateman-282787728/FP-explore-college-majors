Aside from the head I found the movie rather boring.  The film is about a young couple who get abducted and tortured by a psychotic doctor.  The first portion of the torture was the doctor fingering the young girl and forcing the guy to watch then more violation except this time the girl watches.  Then the doctors procedes to torture them in various ways (he tends to take turns like when the couple exchange a necklace the doctor made for each of them).  I got bored with it afterawhile but since I had sit through half of it I figured might as well finish it....and I did and the ending I found rather funny.,2,I gave it 2 stars for the biting decapitated head...,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,770,"['main', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'found', 'decapitated', 'head', 'flying', 'air', 'very', 'funny', 'yes', 'did', 'laugh', 'when', 'bit', 'someone', 'Aside', 'head', 'found', 'movie', 'rather', 'boring', 'film', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'get', 'abducted', 'tortured', 'psychotic', 'doctor', 'first', 'portion', 'torture', 'was', 'doctor', 'fingering', 'young', 'girl', 'forcing', 'guy', 'watch', 'then', 'more', 'violation', 'time', 'girl', 'watches', 'Then', 'doctors', 'procedes', 'torture', 'various', 'ways', 'take', 'turns', 'when', 'couple', 'exchange', 'necklace', 'doctor', 'made', 'got', 'bored', 'afterawhile', 'had', 'sit', 'half', 'figured', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'finish', '.and', 'did', 'ending', 'found', 'rather', 'funny']",N/A

1333366,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003905U5S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Grotesque (Koji Shiraishi, 2009)Grotesque, one of the most infamous horror films of the past ten years, comes  to us from Koji Shiraishi, whose name you may remember from such Asian cult films as Ju-rei: The Uncanny and A Slit-Mouthed Woman. (Or maybe not; given how much I've heard about Ju-rei, I'm kind of surprised that it only has 239 votes on IMDB as I write this; I thought it was easily as popular as The Grudge.) Grotesque has become, by far, Shiraishi's most popular film, mostly because it is only the third film in the past five years to have been flat-out rejected by the British Board of Film Classification for a rating, and it is the only one of those three to have had a theatrical release. (Yes, it's true: the dreaded Video Nasty still exists, long after the original Video Nasties were finally released in Great Britain!)It is, of course, the case that That Which Is Forbidden Is Desired(TM). Given that the movie was made available on the Internet in an official capacity almost as soon as it was banned in Britain, everyone in the country who actually wanted to see it could. (So much for censorship.) So could the rest of us, and needless to say the thing went viral pretty quick. Not only did the ban help, but taglines like ""Saw and Hostel were just appetizers!"" started floating around. Media whips started singing Shiraishi's praises as the Next Coming of Roth, or what have you, etc. But at the heart of all the media flap and controversy, one question remains: is the movie itself any good?The answer, which should not surprise you: no.Torture porn (the Brits, of course, came up with a snappier term: gorno, though it should be noted that this stuff is quite different than gorenography; I've never seen a gorno/torture porn film that actually contains hardcore scenes, as gorenography films do) is a well-trod field at this point, though given a decent director and a halfway original script, it's like any other subgenre: you could make a good movie by presenting fresh takes on that well-trod ground. Grotesque, like most of the tired, boring torture porn flicks we've seen in the past three or four years, has no pretensions at all to being a good movie. It's a cheap exploitation film whose producers and director are out to make a quick buck. The only ting that can be said for Grotesque that distinguishes it from, say, Train is that it's obvious Shiraishi is aware that torture porn existed long before Saw and Hostel, and he obviously has an affection for the early film work of Hideshi Hino; a number of shots hark back to Flower of Flesh and Blood and The Devil's Experiment. Would that shot composition were enough to recommend a movie, but there is little else here. The characters exist for the sole purpose of being in this flick. They are given no room to actually become characters, to the point that when Shiraishi springs what could have been a phenomenal plot twist on us halfway through the movie, there's no emotional reaction at all. You simply can't bring yourself to care about these characters. That is as important in horror as it is in any other genre. In this particular horror nook, it may be even more important, as the basis of any torture porn film is the actors being put through harrowing experiences; if you're going to be pulled along for the ride, you must identify with one or more characters onscreen. There's no getting around it. This is something Shiraishi does not understand (as Hino, to be fair, did not either until Mermaid in a Manhole, which came after the two flicks to which Shiraishi pays homage here), and as a result, Grotesque is a failure.I get the feeling that if and when we do get good torture porn flicks again, they will come from Asia, where Japan's Flower of Flesh and Blood and Hong Kong's Men Behind the Sun paved the way for the genre. But Grotesque is nothing more than a pothole on the road to those.
