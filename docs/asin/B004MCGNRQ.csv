1419762,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004MCGNRQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","The Lifetime network specializes in the women in peril genre, whether in social drama or in torrid thrillers, and it is a formula that seems to work for them.  ""Reviving Ophelia"" is an example of an earnest family drama about two girls struggling toward adulthood and the mothers (who are sisters) that are trying the best that they can to raise them.  There is nothing particularly subtle about the tale--one of the girls is in an abusive relationship--but this television movie fares better than most by having the great Jane Kaczmarek and the underappreciated Kim Dickens as the adult siblings.  This aspires to be a relevant and important message movie, so of course the screenplay brings a heavy touch to every revelation and confrontation.  With strong performers, however, the film didn't need to push into overwrought melodrama.  Had it kept things simple and realistic, the story would have spoken for itself and been an effective and affecting look at familial bonds and coping with crisis.  As is, though, this is still better than average on the Lifetime movie scale due to the principle actresses being able to ground the more overwrought aspects of the screenplay.Kaczmarek plays the more traditional role.  With an idealized relationship with her daughter, she sees her niece (Dickens' daughter) as a bad influence.  Rebellious and troublesome, the girl is struggling with the stresses of every day life and Dickens seems unable to communicate effectively with her.  When she discovers that her cousin (Kaczmarek's perfect daughter) is actually in an abusive relationship, she doesn't know what to do.  Her concerns are brushed off and disbelieved which does nothing to strengthen the family dynamic.  But, of course, the truth is never far from the surface and as you might expect--there are lessons to be learned all around.  Judgmental Kaszmarek must face reality and come to accept when she needs help.  Dickens must learn to trust her daughter and support her family.  And the girls must learn self esteem and respect.  If these four women can get it together, there's no stopping them.  It's actually a strong story with some nice dramatic moments, but rendered in rather obvious and simplistic terms.I did like that the film was not afraid to paint Kaczmarek in a rather unsympathetic light.  When her pride breaks down to showcase a naked vulnerability and helplessness, it provides a genuine moment of power.  Dickens is more subdued in her role--she's an underrated actress who I wish was utilized to greater effect here (anyone who hasn't seen the understated but devastating Things Behind The Sun should treat themselves to this great, but unpleasant, film).  The girls are both fine, while the boyfriend (whom we're also supposed to identify with due to a cycle of abuse) takes the brunt of the film's quick shifts in tone.  Overall, if you're a fan of the television movie format--this is a better Lifetime offering than most.  At about 3 1/2 stars, it has the power to move you but lacks a fundamental realness that might have made it extraordinary.
