Janet(Joyce DeWitt) and Helen Roper(the late Audra Lindley) protest in a march to legalize nude sunbathing. Stanley(the late Norman Fell) feels Chrissy(Suzanne Somers) is in love with him.

850162,AHSY48775P8RI,B0002Y4T7O,Avalon Daughter,"[25, 25]","A lot of fans have said that season 3 was the golden year of Three's Company and I couldn't agree more.This season was the one when everyone was watching and was #1 in the ratings.  We see Chrissy, Jack and Janet (and the Roepers) in their prime; They've grown used to the set and the characters are interacting like a well-oiled machine.The transfer is MUCH better than season 1, which I still think was pushed out too early due to the passing of John Ritter.  The extras are almost as good as season 2.  We get to see the second pilot with ""the other Chrissy"" and turns out it was the second episode of the series.  Kind of weird, isn't it?  Regardless, it is interesting seeing another Chrissy but the character is so overdone I could see why they replaced her with Suzanne Somers.Along with the extras is another memorandum to John Ritter with interviews from a lot of the cast (with the exception of Suzanne Somers, who in my opinion needs to grow up and be a part of this great DVD set.)  There's also another bloopers reel as well as ""the best of"" moments of the main characters.There's also a great function to play all the episodes of each disc (which is great if you're lazy like me.)  The only thing I wish would be they would insert chapters within the episodes.  Hitting the forward button takes you to the next episode rather than past the opening credits or otherwise.  All the original openers along with promos from John Ritter and ending tags have all be reinserted, so on the disc is what you saw when it originally aired.For fans, always recommended.

850165,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002Y4T7O,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 3]","Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977, Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues, the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off, Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day, dealing with subjects such as homosexuality, racism, sexual harassment, and of course, unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...In Three's Company, John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper, a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell), an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley), the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is, in fact, a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene, and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3, Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord, Mr. Furley - a nave, loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...The Three's Company (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Double Date"" in which Jack makes a date with the beautiful Samantha Evans (Rebecca Clemons), but Mr. Roper overhears and so Jack pretends he has a cold. Later, when Chrissy and Janet walk into the living room, Samantha finds out that they are his roommates (not his Church collector and nurse as he told her), so she leaves in disgust... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Love Diary"" in which Mr. Roper comes to believe that Chrissy has the hots for him, and ""The Harder They Fall"" in which Jack ruins Janet's date when he and his broken leg constantly get in the way...Below is a list of episodes included on the Three's Company (Season 3) DVD:Episode 32 (Double Date)Episode 33 (Good Old Reliable Janet)Episode 34 (The Love Diary)Episode 35 (The Fast)Episode 36 (Helen's Rendezvous)Episode 37 (My Sister's Keeper)Episode 38 (Chrissy and the Guru)Episode 39 (Larry's Bride)Episode 40 (Chrissy's New Boss)Episode 41 (The Crush)Episode 42 (The Kleptomaniac)Episode 43 (The Party's Over)Episode 44 (Eleanor's Return)Episode 45 (The Older Woman)Episode 46 (Stanley's Hotline)Episode 47 (The Catered Affair)Episode 48 (The Best Laid Plans)Episode 49 (The Harder They Fall)Episode 50 (The Bake-Off)Episode 51 (An Anniversary Surprise)Episode 52 (Jack Moves Out)Episode 53 (Triangle Troubles)The DVD Report",5,Come and knock on their door...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3155,"['Bursting', 'television', 'landscape', 'Spring', '1977', 'Three', 'Company', 'quickly', 'skyrocketed', 'ratings', 'cracking', 'top', '8', 'season', 'last', 'Sporting', 'plethora', 'quirky', 'characters', 'fresh', 'writing', 'talent', 'explored', 'modern', 'day', 'issues', 'show', 'held', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'programs', 'TV', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'Family', 'left', 'off', 'Three', 'Company', 'delved', 'social', 'taboos', 'day', 'dealing', 'subjects', 'such', 'homosexuality', 'racism', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'course', 'unmarried', 'men', 'women', 'living', 'together', 'true', 'success', 'Three', 'Company', 'stemmed', 'comic', 'talents', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'who', 'became', 'instant', 'stars', 'result', 'respective', 'roles', 'show', 'Three', 'Company', 'John', 'Ritter', 'role', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'young', 'cooking', 'student', 'San', 'Diego', 'who', 'move', 'apartment', 'two', 'female', 'friends', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'blonde', 'ditsy', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'three', 'friends', 'face', 'possible', 'wrath', 'landlord', 'Stanley', 'Roper', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'old-fashioned', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'such', 'arrangement', 'aid', 'Roper', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'three', 'manage', 'convince', 'Stanley', 'Jack', 'gay', 'when', 'fact', 'notorious', 'ladies', 'man', 'Jack', 'friend', 'Larry', 'Richard', 'Kline', 'also', 'player', 'local', 'singles', 'scene', 'regular', 'appearances', 'show', 'Following', 'Season', '3', 'Stanley', 'Helen', 'left', 'show', 'pursuit', 'own', 'spin-off', 'titled', 'Ropers', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'fame', 'was', 'brought', 'play', 'new', 'landlord', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'nave', 'loud-mouthed', 'ditz', 'who', 'tripled', 'hilarity', 'scene', 'appeared', 'Three', 'Company', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Double', 'Date', 'Jack', 'date', 'beautiful', 'Samantha', 'Evans', 'Rebecca', 'Clemons', 'Mr.', 'Roper', 'so', 'Jack', 'cold', 'Later', 'when', 'Chrissy', 'Janet', 'walk', 'living', 'room', 'Samantha', 'out', 'are', 'roommates', 'not', 'Church', 'collector', 'nurse', 'told', 'disgust', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Love', 'Diary', 'Mr.', 'Roper', 'believe', 'Chrissy', 'hots', 'Harder', 'Fall', 'Jack', 'Janet', 'date', 'when', 'broken', 'leg', 'constantly', 'get', 'way', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Three', 'Company', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '32', 'Double', 'Date', 'Episode', '33', 'Good', 'Old', 'Reliable', 'Janet', 'Episode', '34', 'Love', 'Diary', 'Episode', '35', 'Fast', 'Episode', '36', 'Helen', 'Rendezvous', 'Episode', '37', 'My', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'Episode', '38', 'Chrissy', 'Guru', 'Episode', '39', 'Larry', 'Bride', 'Episode', '40', 'Chrissy', 'New', 'Boss', 'Episode', '41', 'Crush', 'Episode', '42', 'Kleptomaniac', 'Episode', '43', 'Party', 'Over', 'Episode', '44', 'Eleanor', 'Return', 'Episode', '45', 'Older', 'Woman', 'Episode', '46', 'Stanley', 'Hotline', 'Episode', '47', 'Catered', 'Affair', 'Episode', '48', 'Best', 'Laid', 'Plans', 'Episode', '49', 'Harder', 'Fall', 'Episode', '50', 'Bake-Off', 'Episode', '51', 'Anniversary', 'Surprise', 'Episode', '52', 'Jack', 'Out', 'Episode', '53', 'Triangle', 'Troubles', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

While some of their lines are indeed humorous, their overall style of interaction is a bit tired and too predictable after three seasons. Yes, we know that Helen wants sex and Stanley doesn't. No matter how you say it, it's still the same, never-changing story.

850173,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0002Y4T7O,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[7, 9]","I am not old enough to remember when Three's Company caused such a stir in its original television airing. I simply caught an episode or two on Nick at Nite one evening and was hooked and was thrilled when they began releasing the seasons on DVD, although it seems that it took the much-to-early death of John Ritter to trigger those releases.Three's Company was comic gold. The dim-wittedness of Chrissy Snow, the straight-laced Janet Wood and the physical comedy of Jack Tripper made for one incredibly funny household. Add to the mix the bling-bling of ladies' man Larry Dallas and the sexually frustrated Helen Roper and her not-so-erotically-charged husband Stanley and season three was Three's Company at full stride and in full comic mode.Suzanne Somers made a name for herself playing Chrissy Snow, the blond daughter of a minister, still naive in the ways of the world. Her blondness combined with the positions she found herself in led to many great situations for the roomates.Joyce DeWitt, who along with John Ritter, was with the show for the entire length of the series, often had to serve as the straight to her comic roomates, but she did have her own moments to shine as well.John Ritter was the glue that held Three's Company together. His comic genius is shown in every light in this season and he shows why audiences loved to watch his show. His farce of being gay so that he can live with the two women leads to some great situations with his landlord Mr. Roper. Of course Jack manages to find trouble pretty well all by himself.Norman Fell and Audra Lindley, who played the Ropers, the roomates' landlords, left the show at the end of this season as they rode off into spin-off land, only heard from once again and replaced by Don Knotts in season four. Fell and LIndley brought a great quality to the show, one of parental guidance for the kids, yet at the same time they found plenty of exploits of their own.This DVD set features a couple of features on John Ritter and how he helped shape this show. Some of these interviews are quite informative. There is also a great commentary on a classic episode, ""The Bake-Off,"" provided by Chris Mann, the author of a behind-the-scenes book on the show.This show allowed me, unable to appreciate it in its time, the chance to really appreciate the talent of John Ritter and the comedy of this show. While the storylines can be tame by today's standards, this show still carries a comedic punch that will keep you laughing until Season Four arrives in stores.",4,Come and knock on our door. . .,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2525,"['am', 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'Three', 'Company', 'caused', 'stir', 'original', 'television', 'airing', 'simply', 'caught', 'episode', 'two', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'one', 'evening', 'was', 'hooked', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'began', 'releasing', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'took', 'much-to-early', 'death', 'John', 'Ritter', 'trigger', 'releases.Three', 'Company', 'was', 'comic', 'gold', 'dim-wittedness', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'straight-laced', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'made', 'one', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'household', 'Add', 'mix', 'bling-bling', 'ladies', 'man', 'Larry', 'Dallas', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'Helen', 'Roper', 'not-so-erotically-charged', 'husband', 'Stanley', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'Three', 'Company', 'full', 'stride', 'full', 'comic', 'mode.Suzanne', 'Somers', 'made', 'name', 'playing', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'blond', 'daughter', 'minister', 'still', 'naive', 'ways', 'world', 'blondness', 'combined', 'positions', 'found', 'led', 'many', 'great', 'situations', 'roomates.Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'who', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'show', 'entire', 'length', 'series', 'often', 'had', 'serve', 'straight', 'comic', 'roomates', 'did', 'have', 'own', 'moments', 'shine', 'well.John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'glue', 'held', 'Three', 'Company', 'together', 'comic', 'genius', 'shown', 'light', 'season', 'why', 'audiences', 'loved', 'watch', 'show', 'farce', 'being', 'gay', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'two', 'women', 'great', 'situations', 'landlord', 'Mr.', 'Roper', 'course', 'Jack', 'find', 'trouble', 'pretty', 'well', 'all', 'himself.Norman', 'Fell', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'who', 'played', 'Ropers', 'roomates', 'landlords', 'left', 'show', 'end', 'season', 'rode', 'off', 'spin-off', 'land', 'only', 'heard', 'once', 'again', 'replaced', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'season', 'four', 'Fell', 'LIndley', 'brought', 'great', 'quality', 'show', 'one', 'parental', 'guidance', 'kids', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'plenty', 'exploits', 'own.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'couple', 'features', 'John', 'Ritter', 'how', 'helped', 'shape', 'show', 'interviews', 'are', 'quite', 'informative', 'also', 'great', 'commentary', 'classic', 'episode', 'Bake-Off', 'provided', 'Chris', 'Mann', 'author', 'behind-the-scenes', 'book', 'show.This', 'show', 'allowed', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'time', 'chance', 'really', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'John', 'Ritter', 'comedy', 'show', 'storylines', 'can', 'be', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'show', 'still', 'comedic', 'punch', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'Season', 'Four', 'stores']",N/A

I have found this show really, really funny and I do believe it was way ahead of its time with the jokes and sex references. It's also so easy to fall in love with the main characters: Jack Tripper was by far the captain of the boat but without the clever Janet and the beautiful and naive Chrissy, he could've not made it. Unfortunely, to me Chrissy's character suffers a negative change in this season. In the first two seasons, Chrissy's character (played by the gorgeous Suzanne Summers) was a cute, charming and even naive girl with a personality of her own... that was exactly the charm of this character. But in season 3, I can see that she became a dumb, needless girl on the show (even for Chrissy's standards) with no presence of her own when she appears with the rest of te cast and that's sad because Chrissy's character was one of the main reasons for many men (myself included) to watch this show but not for her beauty alone but also for her comments, her thoughts and her interaction with the rest. And I must point out why on earth she appeared on most of the episodes with the same hair style. I don't know if the producers were trying to hide something that had happened to Suzanne back in those days but that flat hairdo and the pony tail on the side gets boring after a while. Don't get me wrong, Suzanne Summers looks gorgeous no matter how her hair looks like but, with her gorgeous hair they could've made many variations on her character.Now, I'm just half way convinced with this season but I'm planning to keep on getting the ones where Chrissy's character appears. I'm not planning on getting the seasons where she was vanished form the show...

850185,A1PIRNQ1I06XTV,B0002Y4T7O,Sherrie Jackson,"[0, 0]","So I'm kinda watching the series backward. Don't ask. But it has allowed me to notice some really interesting changes that I didn't notice having watched it chronologically before.But first, of course I have to say this is one of my favorite TV shows EVER; I remember being just a tyke and sitting in the family room while the afternoon cartoons (He-Man, She-Ra, Voltron) gave way to two gals and a guy living together in Santa Monica. I caught it in re-runs in junior high and again on Nick-at-Nite in college, and it has never failed to give me that warm, fuzzy feeling of familiarity and good times. Plus, I have an eternal crush on John Ritter.Anyway, here's what's different (markedly) in season 3. Firstly, they dumbed Chrissy down all the way to the basement. In season 2 she actually understood the situations she was in, mostly, and she was given actual paragraphs to recite, and she had a real, normal, somewhat perky voice. She came across as a woman. Here in season 3 she's all one-liners, her voice has gone shrill, and she doesn't seem to have any grasp of the world around her. Plus, her hair - she basically has a combover ponytail. I'm not sure what the deal was or what the producers found when they surveyed the average Joe, but they kind of just ruined Chrissy. They made her childlike, gave her those awful rambling stories that were supposed to be funny but weren't, and I could go on and on but you get the picture. I kind of feel like Suzanne Sommers was robbed of her dignity.So, then there's the difference with Jack. In season 2 he was actually a little mean; he would get angry, he would be insulting, and he came right out and called Chrissy brainless several times (something he only insinuated good-naturedly in season 3 when she, of course, was hemorrhaging brain cells). So Jack's was a good change - he's no longer sullen but just bright and cheerful and funny and charming, the way we remember him.The third difference is that while this has always been a comedy of errors, at least it wasn't taken to the extreme in season 2. In season 3 I tend to get frustrated - I mean, the dialogue was clearly written for maximum confusion and no one in reality would encounter such drawn-out misunderstandings. Sometimes it's hard for me to enjoy a fictional situation that's just obviously impossible.Alrighty. That's that.

For those of you who are not familiar with it, it's about 3 roommates that live together (2 girls and a guy).  Chrissy Snow, played by Suzanne Somers, is a ditsy blond.  Janet Wood, played by Joyce DeWitt, is serious and hardworking.  Jack Tripper, played by John Ritter, is always getting himself into trouble and along with his friend, Larry, is always on the look for women to date.  The managers of the apartment, The Ropers, are hilarious.  Mr. Roper is always listening in on conversations and misunderstands the facts and gets himself into trouble as a result.  Mrs. Roper is sex starved.  All of the characters get themselves into trouble due to misunderstandings, etc.  It is funny and interesting to see how they work themselves out of the hilarious situations.

Episodes vary from GREAT to good.  The best episode featuring the episode where Chrissy finds marijuana in the back yard.  Be on the look for when Mr Roper says a particularly stinging comment to his wife, he turns to another camera and makes this hilarious look on his face.  The big bonus was the original pilot.  I didn't care for the names or the blonde roommate, though I liked the brunette's character and actress who played her.  Pity she didn't stay on.  But John Ritter, Norman Fell, and Audra Lindley were perfectly cast.Season 3:  Very good DVD conversion quality (which actually allows more of the master tape's defects to be seen, but to repair that damage would sadly be too expensive), same format of extras, and episodes vary from good to GREAT (more GREAT ones).  The other pilot, essentially episode 2 from season 1, simply goes through the paces - fortunately, somebody found Suzanne Sommers, who makes the show her own in season 3.  While the Mr Roper-looks-at-the-camera shtick is mostly gone, we're replaced with an increasingly comic and hilarious Chrissy.  From her catchphrase snort giggle that always drew laughs to silly facial expressions and comments, Suzanne made the character her own in this season.Also included are interviews, hosted by Joyce DeWitt.  The Larry Kline interview was exceptional.Prime episodes in season 3 include (in no particular order):Jack Moves OutThe Bake-Off (classic!)The Best Laid PlansThe Older WomanChrissy's New BossMy Sister's KeeperHelen's RendezvousEleanor's ReturnThe Fast (classic!)Good Old Reliable JanetAnd while many people think that the Three's Company episode that was the pilot to ""The Ropers"" was part of season 3, it wasn't.  (so if you liked ""The Ropers"", that DVD set will contain the spinoff pilot featuring the regular cast.)In short, this set is worth every penny put into it.
