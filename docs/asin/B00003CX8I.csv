521338,A3SUKLWAA850B8,B00003CX8I,Aaron Ren,"[0, 0]","No, I'm not talking about some saturday-morning animated special. It's X-Men: The Movie, and it has parallels to our real-life issues of discrimination, racism, and nationalism. You, a concerned, hyper-zealous parent, must be thinking, &quot;What the--? A super-human comicbook movie adaptation that actually contains useful material for our generation of youngsters?&quot;That's right, Mrs. Censor. You see, X-Men's plot goes around the premise of a world where certain people are starting to attain magical superhuman abilities because of their genetic predisposition. Because of the way they are born, people begin to fear them and what they can do. Thus, the public gets pees their panties and wants the aforementioned &quot;freaks&quot; to be, in one way or another, contained. Any way you cut it, that's discrimination, folks. This is not by any means a shock to readers of the comics (as well as viewers of the animated TV show), since the theme of X-Men has always centered around the ideas of social acceptance and insecurity.The moral depictions are pretty cool, but what other things are  cool about this movie are the way our heroes (and villians) have their super-powers visualized. I won't spoil them for you right here, but believe me when I say fans of the comicbook will appreciate the innovative effects and stunts that bring the X-Men's &quot;mutations&quot; to life on the screen.This movie has its share of flaws, though. As many comic fans would have predicted, Wolverine gets the lion-share of coverage and development, while characters like Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Gray are underdeveloped. I would've liked to see more of the mentor-pupil relationship between Scott Summers and Professor Xavier that was so evident in the comics. However, Rogue was nicely characterized, subbing in for Jubilee as Logan's dependent friend and companion.What can I say? The movie is deliciously great, and its low-points mean diddly-squat in the midst of its high-points. It's a comic-book fan's dream. If you like the comics, buy this film. If you don't like the comics, buy this film anyway. If you have any idea how hard it is to pull off successful comic-book film adaptations, you'll by this film right now.",5,An educational superhero movie.,978739200,"01 6, 2001",2001,2219,"[""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'saturday-morning', 'animated', 'special', 'X-Men', 'Movie', 'parallels', 'real-life', 'issues', 'discrimination', 'racism', 'nationalism', 'concerned', 'hyper-zealous', 'parent', 'must', 'be', 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'super-human', 'comicbook', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'actually', 'useful', 'material', 'generation', 'youngsters', 'quot', 'right', 'Mrs', 'Censor', 'see', 'X-Men', 'plot', 'premise', 'world', 'where', 'certain', 'people', 'are', 'starting', 'attain', 'magical', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'genetic', 'predisposition', 'way', 'are', 'born', 'people', 'begin', 'fear', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Thus', 'public', 'pees', 'panties', 'aforementioned', 'quot', 'quot', 'be', 'one', 'way', 'contained', 'way', 'cut', 'discrimination', 'folks', 'not', 'means', 'shock', 'readers', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'viewers', 'animated', 'TV', 'show', 'theme', 'X-Men', 'always', 'centered', 'ideas', 'social', 'acceptance', 'insecurity.The', 'moral', 'depictions', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'what', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'cool', 'movie', 'are', 'way', 'heroes', 'villians', 'have', 'super-powers', 'visualized', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'right', 'here', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'fans', 'comicbook', 'will', 'appreciate', 'innovative', 'effects', 'stunts', 'bring', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'mutations', 'quot', 'life', 'screen.This', 'movie', 'share', 'flaws', 'though', 'many', 'comic', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'predicted', 'Wolverine', 'lion-share', 'coverage', 'development', 'characters', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'Jean', 'Gray', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'mentor-pupil', 'relationship', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'was', 'so', 'evident', 'comics', 'However', 'Rogue', 'was', 'nicely', 'characterized', 'subbing', 'Jubilee', 'Logan', 'dependent', 'friend', 'companion.What', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'deliciously', 'great', 'low-points', 'mean', 'diddly-squat', 'midst', 'high-points', 'comic-book', 'fan', 'dream', 'like', 'comics', 'buy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'comics', 'buy', 'film', 'anyway', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'successful', 'comic-book', 'film', 'adaptations', ""'ll"", 'film', 'right', 'now']",X-Men VHS
521339,A32JKNQ6BABMQ2,B00003CX8I,"abe ""starman""","[0, 16]","amazon only lets us review one part of a whole set so theres a better chance youll buy more stuff if you like the first review.i guess theyre more interested in $ than the freedom of speech and not ripping off its customers.so im going to review them both right here.in part one,wolverine who has acute senses,admantium blades and a extremely fast regenerative power is hurt and rescued by the x-men who are a team of highly evolved people with extraordinary talents.he was with rogue when he was recruited who can touch people and see there thoughts  and drains mutants abilities.thier leader is professer x.one of the guys from star trek.he is insanely telepathic.while there at mutant school,he meets cyclops with eye lasers and jean grey who also does the telepathic thing.theyre enemies are magneto who controls anything metal,sabretooth-a cat like he-man,toad with a very long and powerful tongue.like 4 or 5 feet and can throw people.magneto has a special machine that could suck all mutants powers into his captive rogue and then take over from there.a battle goes down up top the statue of liberty.then in the second part,which i give 5 stars,another bad mutant who works for magneto named mystique uses nightcrawlers9a good teleporting mutant]body to attack the white house so the x-men will get the blame.magneto who is trapped in a plastic prison pulls the iron in his guards blood to rip him apart and escapes.the guy who aided his escape is a big shot goverment type who wants the mutants dead.his son is a mutant who can control otheres minds.but the dad can control him with a special machine.so they try to use the kid to control professer x into using his cerebro invention to kill all mutants.theres a big fight,blahblah blah.mystique is totaly naked except for blue dye and little rubber suction thingys allover her body.sabretooth is played by the lucha libre star taylor mane.thats spanish for professinal wrestling.they are both good but 2 is way better.jean grey is a semi hot red head.if the creators really wanted to go over the top spectacular with this set theyd finish telling the story.jean grey does come back as an extremely powerful mutant called phoenix.she is powerful enough to take over the world but doesnt want to since shes good.but then she gets turned into the dark phoenix.also ,there are many many cool characters not even explored yet.theres juggernaut-a giant kind of like hulk but smarter.apocalypse-a more powerful and giant version of the t-1000 from terminater 2.giant robotic mutant hunters called sentinals.the blob-a giant fat guy whose mirth absorbs most any blow.longshot-a good guy who has incredible luck all the time.archangel-with paralytic darts and razor wings.the beast-more agile than spider man,genius and colored a lot like sullivan from monsters inc.havoc-he can concentrate something and blow stuff up.even a mountain if he really really tried.gambit can charge things and use them explosively.bobby drake from part 2 later becomes a far more powerful ice man.firestar who shoots fire.a lot like pyro in part 2.there are many many more too.at least 30.they even travel to the future for numerous outstanding stories.my point being,while both of these movies rock!they could make at least 3 more totaly awesome ones and a whole string of sequels some even involving psycic vampires and the like.wolverine did the best acting in part one but was outshined by pyro in the 2nd one.pyro can control flames.ie:in one scene he lights a lighter and uses it to blast a team of cops away so he can escape.that scene was the best scene of both parts.there is this subtle ww2 minority rise up against the white kind of undertone but its  expected with hollywood.in the best scene i talked about,wolverine gets shot in the head at point blank,hits the ground and is up within a minute.i guess the only star is the dude from star trek.so these are his 2 best movies.all his others suck.the special effects are very cool.pyro and nightcrawler put on some dazzling displays.ive already given some ideas for sequels but will recap.1-apocalypse vs the x-men,2-the dark phoenix saga,3-time travel to the vampire world of the future,4-sentinals vs the x-men,5-time travel story where the x-men are eventualy betrayed and wiped out by a friend,and even when the battled kang who in the very distant future rules the world and sets out to conquer all time!i give the real deal and the real deal is if you dont get all this and more youre getting screwed.",4,x-men 2-the greatest comic movie ever!,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,4499,"['amazon', 'only', 'review', 'one', 'part', 'whole', 'set', 'so', 'better', 'chance', 'youll',

First, it is well written, leaving just enough cheese and in-jokes for fans of the comics--but it doesn't ignore the newbie, either.  Each important plot point is explained, and we are saved from watching the &quot;origin&quot; of every character.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Professor X, and Ian McKellan as Magneto really steal the show.  They've embodied their characters, and work well together.  The message of discrimination is never played heavy-handed, but it comes across.  All in all, a solid performance.Michael Kamen's music is wonderful and fitting.  Just the right amount of adrenaline and somberness.

Fans of the comic will be pleased to see that the characters in the film aren't all that different from those in the Marvel comic.  There are of course some liberties that the filmmakers took in order to keep new fans out of the dark, but all-in-all, the comic-to-film transfer was very satisfactory.  There are some great actors in the film, most notably Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Ian McKellen as Magneto.  The film does a nice job of introducing the characters, and of laying details of their individual histories.  The storyline was reminiscent of the stories written by Chris Claremont, and not the pathetic excuse for a comic that Marvel is currently publishing.

While I am disapointed that it is Pan and Scan instead of widescreen, I guess that's just the name of the game with the format. I was actually suprised to find that this tape did feature deleted scenes after the feature presentation.As far as the movie goes, it's rather engaging. Not up there with Richard Donner's 'Superman: The Movie' or even the gothic-classical realm of Tim Burton's 'Batman,' but never the less a solid comic adaptation.Taking elements from a variety of eras of 'X-Men' mythology, it is set in the very near future. It opens with a dirty, shocking and bizzare sequence in Nazi Germany. It then flashes forward to Jean Grey addressing Congress concerning the Mutant Registration act. Meanwhile, her mentor Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, the only choice in my mind.) confronts his former friend, current advesary, Magneto (Ian McKellan of LotR fame). And so on.This film is firmly rooted in character development, rather than fight scenes. The three main characters (in regards to character development and screen time) are Rogue (Anna Paquin), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and the aforementioned McKellan.For fans of comic books and/or superheroes, this film is worth picking up.

521348,A1A4DEENGHK51T,B00003CX8I,Alan Attebery,"[7, 7]","Humanity is at a crossroads. Evolution has reared its head. There are human beings in the world today with extraordinary gifts and powers. These powerful beings are called ""mutants."" And their existence scares some people.In the United States, Senator Robert Kelly has introduced legislation that will require all mutants to ""register"" as such. He feeds the fear by telling his peers, and the public, some of what he's heard these mutants can do.Two of the most powerful mutants, Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X), and his old friend, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto), have different agendas of how best to deal with humanity's intolerance of mutants.The Professor believes that patience is a virtue in this case. Humanity will come around eventually, he believes. In the meantime, he has established a ""School for the Gifted,"" where he teaches his students how to control and master their powers for the good of humanity.Magneto, on the other hand, believes that a war between humans and mutants is inevitable. Instead of waiting for it to happen, however, he wants to go on the offensive. If it's a war humans want, it's a war they will get. One way or the other, Magneto will see to it that the mutant race is the only race that survives.That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know before going to see this movie, though you could really no nothing at all and not have to worry. ""X-Men"" does an excellent job of setting the stage for those viewers who no nothing of the world of mutants.The X-Men universe has been around for a very long time, with several incarnations in both the comic book and cartoon series world. Each incarnation has its own version of the struggle between humanity and mutants, as well as its own telling of the backgrounds of the characters. There is a very rich history to draw from, with a possible cast of hundreds of mutants to draw from.One of the reasons I liked this movie so much is that director Bryan Singer didn't try to introduce too many mutants all at once. Although long-time mutant lovers would have loved it, novice mutant viewers would have been too overwhelmed to follow the story. Instead, the main storyline was limited to just a handful of mutants (Professor X, Magneto, Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Sabertooth, Toad, and Mystique). However, he also treated long time X-Men fans to a glimpse of many other mutant favorites (including Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, and Kitty to name a few).I also thought the casting of this movie was near perfection. Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) made such a great Professor X that you almost begin to think that the comic book character was originally written with him in mind. Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) as Magneto was also a great choice. Fanke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) were also very well choices.However, my favorite casting decision has got to be Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I don't know who it was that saw the potential he had to play this part, but it was very much the right call. Of all the characters, the casting of Wolverine is the one that could have broken the entire movie for long time X-Men fans. Thankfully, Jackman was the perfect choice and we were treated to a great portrayal.I know some long time X-Men fans were disappointment that his or her favorite mutant did not make it into the movie. However, there is great potential for not only more X-Men movies (at the time of this review, X2: X-Men United has already been released and pre-production work is currently in progress for X-Men 3), but also for more specialized mutant movies focusing on one, two, or three mutants at a time (right now, rumors are circulating about a movie featuring Wolverine and one featuring Storm). If done correctly, this franchise can last for many, many years.The original VHS version also comes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards.Boiled down: ""X-Men"" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun.

521350,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,B00003CX8I,Alexander Suraev,"[0, 3]","The film is not without it's merits. Hugh Jenkman is intense though I could not help thinking that Australia now has the new export -  glowering actors with hair-framed faces, the wounded guys ready to burst out in rage. Doesn't he remind you of Russell Crowe's gladiator?I was happy to see Ray Park's face for the first time - without Darth Maul's warpaint and The Horseman's headlessness. His Toad is a funny, quirky  creature. Delicious Rebecca Romjin-Stamos having her revenge on the world for having to wear that weird makeup.The scene when the guns hang in the air aiming at their masters' foreheads is also very impressive and looks fresh.BUT!A few things just do not make sense. Wolverine catches up with the Rogue (who, by the way, does not look or act like rogue) in the train, they decide to give it another try and go back to the school -  then the wheels turn and they just sit, letting the train take them where the girl planned to go, as far from the mutant academy as possible.And that's not the only lapse of reason in the movie.What's more important is the production design. It seems that Bryan Singer could not decide what kind of comics-based movie he intends to make. The opening Holocaust scene made me feel I am watching the modern fairy tale of the new kind, something serious, and the cartoon evil echoes the terror of the human history.But nearly an hour passes and I see that tragic and bitter survivor dressed like a county fair magician. All the laughable clich&eacute;s in superhero's attire resurface.  His ""mind-impulse-proof"" headgear looks exactly like a boxer's helmet, hastily acquired in the nearest sports equipment shop. And if that thing can block the rival's impulses how come Magneto's brainwaves stream out unhindered?In Batman movies the Gotham City is very stylized and the characters' outfits does not look out of place. In Blade the city and the interiors are very modern and hi-tech - so even the vampires are dressed as a club-going crowd. And that does not make them look less menacing.When we see provincial America and the very unromantic places like Northern Alberta, the appearance of leather-clad cloaked clowns looks weird. The scenes are not stylized or not stylized enough.  Magneto and his cohorts marching down the railway station stairs is the perfect picture of the freak parade.The accents are unbalanced. We have the realistically shot reminder of the WW II genocide at the movie's start and at the end - the ultimate comic-book messing with the Statue of Liberty. Is that the testimony of the unease Bryan Singer felt as a ""serious"" director venturing into the territory of the purely commercial cinema?Of course any addition to the superhero cinematography is guaranteed a well-funded promotional campaign, an impressive official site and the merchandise that usually brings a large percentage of the film's profit. And the film has to be a total flop to leave the viewers with a definite feeling of disappointment. Even the deeply flawed movies ride a hypewave to the public appreciation.X-men is far from being a flop, but the promise of the opening scenes is left unfulfilled.

521351,A9998RE3AEA95,B00003CX8I,Alex,"[1, 1]","There are two ways of watching &quot;X-Men&quot;: either as a bad sci-fi flik, or as a worse film version of the comic book/animated series. As a sci-fi flik, &quot;X-Men&quot; isn't as bad as it is silly. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine has an overmoussed 'do, Patrick Stewart never comes off the screen as anyone but himself, and the fight sequences are so heavily computerized that the characters are almost continuously in the air.If watched as a film version of the classic comic book series, things get infinitely worse. &quot;Humanized&quot; in the best Hollywood traditions, the X-men act like sulky teenagers: they push and curse and &quot;claim their girls.&quot; The last is especially ridiculous, since reducing the cast of X-men to three essentially ensures that there's a love triangle. The conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine for the affections of Jean Grey is ludicrous in the extreme. Storm, the only other &quot;official&quot; team member in the movie, is a non-entity. Where are Beast, Gambit, and Nightcrawler?Continuing efforts of making the movie more &quot;mature&quot; lead to very few improvements. The movie makes the leap from cartoon violence to real violence: in the cartoon, we would have never seen Wolverine run his claws through Mystique. We would have never seen Senator Kelly, the mutant-hating McKarthy clone (R-Kansas), agonizingly dissolve into water.The plot is a miracle of compression: the impression is that the writers tried to squeeze in every last bit of X-men lore and then tossed out or changed whatever they didn't like. Thus, the central storyline is a retelling of the first episode of the cartoon series, only with Rogue (her sheepish character has nothing at all to do with brash but competent woman from the cartoon) in place of Jubilee (the only other change is that Wolverine is not yet an X-man, which makes very little difference). When the movie tires of this thread, it switches to Magneto's evil plot to change everyone into mutants, if only to allow for more floaty fight sequences.A lot of the original's entertainment value came from the intrinsic exoticism of the X-Men's allies and foes. Thus, Cyclops and his team fought Apocalypse in ancient Mayan temples, Magneto in the Lost Land, and even Deathbird in outer space. Here, there are three villains besides Magneto: Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad - all of them with zero backstory. The writers forgot that Mystique is Nightcrawler's mother, and that her power is shape-changing, not acrobatics. Isn't Sabretooth supposed to have resulted from the same cruel experiments that created Wolverine?Magneto (Ian McKellen) is really the only sympathetic character in the film, probably unintentionally. I could identify with his cynical view of mankind. He was a significant character in a crowd of cardboard cutouts.&quot;X-Men&quot; ends on a happy note: I was happy that it was over.

521363,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CX8I,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The reason I use that statement as my review title is that, while this film is good, much like `Spider-Man' and `Batman Begins', this film is trumped massively by the sequel.  That aside, this film is still very good for the genre that it finds itself in.  Superhero movies can be hard to make because there are so many devoted fans to please, and there is no way that one can perfectly transfer a comic book to the big screen.  Still, as far as they come, this is one of the better installments.It's a shame that the third film was such a cluttered mess (it's still better than `Spider-Mess 3').This film establishes the conflict between former friends Professor Xavier (Professor X) and Magneto, formerly known as Eric Lensherr.  Lensherr, facing prejudice his entire life, suffers greatly at the hands of an unkind and unsympathetic human race, who regard mutants as below them and continue to misunderstand and mistreat them.  Xavier and Lensherr, once comrades, are now rivals as their viewpoints on the world have begun to contradict one another.  Xavier believes in patience, for he feels that humans are universally good and that they will learn to accept mutants as equals, but Lensherr has grown to despise humanity and feels that the only key to happiness would be a human-free (and mutant inhabited) world.Thus sets the basis for the first installment in the X-Men franchise, and as Xavier's school for mutants and Magneto's band of thugs set off in search of the same girl, a young mutant named Rogue, chaos ensues.That good kind of action sequence chaos.When it comes to superhero films, the most important (or one of the most important) things to consider is the cast.  You have leagues of devoted fans waiting to put a face to the hero they have followed for years, and so `nailing' that aspect of the film is key.  For a film that is littered with heroes and villains, `X-Men' definitely has some inspired casting.  For any fan of the comic, I think there was only ONE choice for Professor X, and they got that one right.  Near unknowns (I say near because they weren't, and still aren't, BIG NAME stars) Famke Janssen and James Marsden filled out their respective roles very nicely (Janssen is a perfect Jean Grey) and Oscar winner Anna Paquin was the perfect choice for Rogue.  Ian McKellen is perfect as Magneto, and while I find that Storm didn't have much to chew on, Berry was a nice (if a tad obvious) choice.But seriously, this is the film that introduced Hugh Jackman to the world, and no matter how awesome the rest of the cast may be, Wolverine was the most important casting decision, and Jackman is absolutely outstanding!It lacks the polish of `X2: United', but it sets a nice tone for the franchise and really works in the origin stories without feeling rushed, stuffed or forced.  There is plenty of action, drama, romance and wit; and a naked blue Rebecca Romijn serves up some oddly stimulating eye-candy.  For what it is, this movie is pretty great.

Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as Proffesor X and Magneto, respectively.  Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is on the mark, and the character Toad (Ray Park) is cool in his own way.

521368,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00003CX8I,Anthony Hinde,"[3, 3]","In any group there can be found extremists and throughout history the most common type is the &quot;kill the strangers&quot; brand of fanatic. In the X-Men, we are introduced to a new group of humanity, mutants. These people are born with gifts and curses that set them apart from their neighbours. It is no surprise to learn that the rest of humanity is rumbling  and in the best tradition of politics, one Senator stands up to be counted. Senator Robert Jefferson Kelly has made it his mission to track and control the dangerous and secretive mutants. If you replace the word &quot;mutants&quot; in his speeches with &quot;Jews&quot;, you would get a clear Nazi feel for it all.The scriptwriters clearly borrowed a lot from Nazi Germany, not the least of which was the opening scene. A crowd of Jews is being herded into a concentration camp, complete with ominous smokestacks in the background. In the crowd, a young boy is separated from his parents as the gates close, the quota being filled. The boy is distraught and struggles to reach his parents. What is surprising is how successful he is, dragging two soldiers along the muddy road. Then we realise that the wire fence is bending towards him, being twisted as if by a giant hand. This miracle abruptly ends as yet another soldier slams the but of his rifle into the boy's face.Powerful images abound in the film. But at no stage is it heavy handed. This is one of those great stories where things are not always clear. We feel sympathy for the most violent and aggressive character in the film, Magneto. He may want to kill or transform the greater bulk of homo-sapiens but all the  time, we know he is that little boy who survived the holocaust. Even the bigoted and opportunistic Senator gets our sympathy when he is imprisoned and subjected to experimentation by Magneto. What's even scarier is that some of the good Senator's speeches actually made some sense. &quot;These mutant children have powers more dangerous than hand guns. We don't allow guns in schools, do we?&quot;Not all mutants want to dominate humanity. There is a group in Westchester being led by a wheelchair bound Professor named Charles Xavier. A mind reading mutant himself, he runs a school for the gifted that also doubles as a base for the X-Men. What do his students do when they graduate? Why, they use their talents for good, fighting crime and injustice. Luckily they have avoided the spandex accessories in their super hero careers, opting instead for form hugging black leather. Where do I sign up?The film has a large cast of important characters. Given the scope of the comic series, on which it is based, that is unavoidable. As the franchise develops, this will only become more of an issue. However, the story focuses mainly on one mutant, Wolverine, and we are encouraged to see most things  through his eyes. Otherwise known as Logan, he is a great character and his main gift seems to be a long-burning anger at the world. If you're angry all the time, it comes in handy to have six spring-loaded blades that can sprout from between your knuckles. Just the potential for damage forces us to carefully watch his every move. I was quite pleased when Hugh Jackman got this role. He's a talented Aussie actor and for those that aren't aware, he has a good singing voice as well.There's little point is describing all the characters in the film, although I would like to single out Anna Paquin for special praise. There are many powerful roles and they are all interesting. All except Dr Jean Grey, Famke Janssen, who doesn't do a whole lot of important things during the film. Since, in the comics, the good doctor developed into, Pheonix, one of the most powerful mutants, I look forward to seeing her spread her wings in the future. In fact, there is so much that needs exploring, after watching this enthralling film, that I hope they make another ten.",5,A comic mutated onto the big screen,970704000,"10 5, 2000",2000,3904,"['group', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'extremists', 'history', 'most', 'common', 'type', 'quot', 'kill', 'strangers', 'quot', 'brand', 'fanatic', 'X-Men', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'group', 'humanity', 'mutants', 'people', 'are', 'born', 'gifts', 'curses', 'set', 'apart', 'neighbours', 'surprise', 'learn', 'rest', 'humanity', 'rumbling', 'best', 'tradition', 'politics', 'one', 'Senator', 'up', 'be', 'counted', 'Senator', 'Robert', 'Jefferson', 'Kelly', 'made', 'mission', 'track', 'control', 'dangerous', 'secretive', 'mutants', 'replace', 'word', 'quot', 'mutants', 'quot', 'speeches', 'quot', 'Jews', 'quot', 'would', 'get', 'clear', 'Nazi', 'feel', 'scriptwriters', 'clearly', 'borrowed', 'lot', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'opening', 'scene', 'crowd', 'Jews', 'being', 'herded', 'concentration', 'camp', 'complete', 'ominous', 'smokestacks', 'background', 'crowd', 'young', 'boy', 'separated', 'parents', 'gates', 'close', 'quota', 'being', 'filled', 'boy', 'distraught', 'struggles', 'reach', 'parents', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'successful', 'dragging', 'two', 'soldiers', 'muddy', 'road', 'Then', 'realise', 'wire', 'fence', 'bending', 'towards', 'being', 'twisted', 'giant', 'hand', 'miracle', 'abruptly', 'yet', 'soldier', 'rifle', 'boy', 'face.Powerful', 'images', 'abound', 'film', 'stage', 'heavy', 'handed', 'one', 'great', 'stories', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'most', 'violent', 'aggressive', 'character', 'film', 'Magneto', 'may', 'want', 'kill', 'transform', 'greater', 'bulk', 'homo-sapiens', 'time', 'know', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'survived', 'holocaust', 'Even', 'bigoted', 'opportunistic', 'Senator', 'sympathy', 'when', 'imprisoned', 'subjected', 'experimentation', 'Magneto', 'What', 'even', 'scarier', 'good', 'Senator', 'speeches', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'quot', 'mutant', 'children', 'have', 'powers', 'more', 'dangerous', 'hand', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'guns', 'schools', 'do', 'quot', 'Not', 'mutants', 'want', 'dominate', 'humanity', 'group', 'Westchester', 'being', 'led', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'Professor', 'named', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'mind', 'reading', 'mutant', 'school', 'gifted', 'also', 'base', 'X-Men', 'What', 'do', 'students', 'do', 'when', 'graduate', 'Why', 'use', 'talents', 'good', 'fighting', 'crime', 'injustice', 'Luckily', 'have', 'avoided', 'spandex', 'accessories', 'super', 'hero', 'careers', 'opting', 'instead', 'form', 'hugging', 'black', 'leather', 'Where', 'do', 'sign', 'up', 'film', 'large', 'cast', 'important', 'characters', 'Given', 'scope', 'comic', 'series', 'based', 'unavoidable', 'franchise', 'will', 'only', 'become', 'more', 'issue', 'However', 'story', 'mainly', 'one', 'mutant', 'Wolverine', 'are', 'encouraged', 'see', 'most', 'things', 'eyes', 'Otherwise', 'known', 'Logan', 'great', 'character', 'main', 'gift', 'be', 'long-burning', 'anger', 'world', ""'re"", 'angry', 'time', 'handy', 'have', 'six', 'spring-loaded', 'blades', 'can', 'sprout', 'knuckles', 'Just', 'potential', 'damage', 'forces', 'carefully', 'watch', 'move', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'when', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'got', 'role', 'talented', 'Aussie', 'actor', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'good', 'singing', 'voice', 'little', 'point', 'describing', 'characters', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'single', 'out', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'special', 'praise', 'are', 'many', 'powerful', 'roles', 'are', 'interesting', 'Dr', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'important', 'things', 'film', 'comics', 'good', 'doctor', 'developed', 'Pheonix', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'mutants', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'spread', 'wings', 'future', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'exploring', 'watching', 'enthralling', 'film', 'hope', 'make', 'ten']",X-Men VHS

Some of the people who gave it one star apparently don't know how to listen well to the big talking heads on the movie-theatre screen.....how the mutants &quot;got&quot; their powers is &quot;explained.&quot;  Um, they were like, born with them?  Duh?  That's what a mutant is, a chromosomal abberation.Secondly, people complain about either not enough action or not enough character development.  It was OBVIOUS the focal point of the story was Wolverine and Rogue.  Their story was the fulcrum point for the whole film and a way to get the ball rolling for following movies.  These two characters were developed really well, and I felt satisfied with the exposition of the others considering their most outstanding personality traits were touched upon.Also, this movie had more to offer than just action and comic-book icons.  It really portrayed how cruel the dehumanization of those different from ourselves can be.  This lesson was balanced with the message of non-violent protest and change through understanding and education, rather than annihilation and force.  The viewer can sympathize with both Xavier's and Magneto's (yes, that's their names :P) causes, but one realizes that Magneto has been possibly hopelessly scarred by his persecution at the hands of Nazis, and he refuses to let his hatred and anger go and channels them into a very deadly, inhumane cause.There were some problems, of course.  How come Xavier didn't know there was a mutant in the academy?  Maybe he has to focus on what he's looking for, I don't know, but that threw me off.  Also, some of the lighting was really bad.  It was most noticeable in shots of Famke Jannsen (Jean Grey).  The unflattering shadows actually made her look quite unattractive at times.  Also, in the scene where Magneto has Rogue in the big &quot;mutant-o-matic&quot; at the end, Scott and Jean argue about &quot;taking a shot,&quot; and Jean keeps telling Scott to wait.  For what, praytell?  I still can't figure this out, and I hope someone else here understood what they were quibbling over.  I also found Halle Berry's performance a bit lacklaster on more than one occasion, and her white wig really should have been constructed better.  And of course, Sabretooth and Wolverine flew JUST a wee bit too far when they jumped or were pummeled by 2x4's.All in all, however, this movie accomplished its aims, I think, and was well done, especially in comparison with Batman and Robin, the latest teeny-bopper horrors, and Battlefield Earth, to name a few.",4,Better than I expected.....,993081600,"06 21, 2001",2001,2614,"['movie', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'action', 'movie', 'matter', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'listen', 'well', 'big', 'talking', 'heads', 'movie-theatre', 'screen', '..how', 'mutants', 'quot', 'got', 'quot', 'powers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Um', 'were', 'born', 'Duh', 'what', 'mutant', 'chromosomal', 'abberation.Secondly', 'people', 'complain', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'OBVIOUS', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'was', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'story', 'was', 'fulcrum', 'point', 'whole', 'film', 'way', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'following', 'movies', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'developed', 'really', 'well', 'felt', 'satisfied', 'exposition', 'others', 'considering', 'most', 'outstanding', 'personality', 'traits', 'were', 'touched', 'upon.Also', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'action', 'comic-book', 'icons', 'really', 'portrayed', 'how', 'cruel', 'dehumanization', 'different', 'ourselves', 'can', 'be', 'lesson', 'was', 'balanced', 'message', 'non-violent', 'protest', 'change', 'understanding', 'education', 'rather', 'annihilation', 'force', 'viewer', 'can', 'sympathize', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'yes', 'names', 'P', 'one', 'Magneto', 'been', 'possibly', 'hopelessly', 'scarred', 'persecution', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'let', 'hatred', 'anger', 'go', 'channels', 'very', 'deadly', 'inhumane', 'cause.There', 'were', 'problems', 'course', 'How', 'come', 'Xavier', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'mutant', 'academy', 'Maybe', 'focus', 'what', 'looking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'threw', 'off', 'Also', 'lighting', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'was', 'most', 'noticeable', 'shots', 'Famke', 'Jannsen', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'unflattering', 'shadows', 'actually', 'made', 'look', 'quite', 'unattractive', 'times', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'Magneto', 'Rogue', 'big', 'quot', 'mutant-o-matic', 'quot', 'end', 'Scott', 'Jean', 'argue', 'quot', 'taking', 'shot', 'quot', 'Jean', 'telling', 'Scott', 'wait', 'what', 'praytell', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'hope', 'someone', 'else', 'here', 'understood', 'what', 'were', 'quibbling', 'also', 'found', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'performance', 'bit', 'lacklaster', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'white', 'wig', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'constructed', 'better', 'course', 'Sabretooth', 'Wolverine', 'flew', 'JUST', 'wee', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'jumped', 'were', 'pummeled', ""2x4's.All"", 'however', 'movie', 'accomplished', 'aims', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'comparison', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'latest', 'teeny-bopper', 'horrors', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'name', 'few']",X-Men VHS

Perschbacher ""thegreatfizz""","[1, 4]","Apparently considered to be the breakout performance of Aussie native Hugh Jackman, X-Men delivers what most consider to be an exciting mix of fantasy and adventure.  All I can really see in this film is a mish-mashing of unrealized characters and confusing lines of dialogue.Now, for quite some time, I considered myself an X-Men fan, I only had about some 25 comics based on the mutated humanoids.  So, naturally I had at least 15% of my conscious self involved in the decision to see this movie.  Of course, my interest in the comic book heroes kind of died out about 3 years prior to the release of the movie, so I wasn't really into it.  Anywho, what I saw in the theaters came near to disgracing what the comic had set out to achieve.  Then again, what does a comic really give us besides a series of storyboarded illustrations.The movie X-Men proves to be less than even a series of random displays.  Obviously (for anyone who's seen the previews) they chose Wolverine to have the main part.  I guess I can see that, but why Rogue as the other main character?  And especially, why Anna Paquin as Rogue?  I don't really know what the casting director was thinking.  Much less what the screenwriters were thinking.  I absolutely love Storm's lines (ex: &quot;Hold on to something&quot; &quot;Do you know what happens to a toad when it is struck by lighting...the same thing that happens to everything else...&quot;).  I mean, come on.Plus, we only get to see Professor X for about 5 minutes before he has an anuerysm and falls faint for the final thousand minutes (or like what it seemed like to me).  Finally, we see the oddly cast Ray Park as Toad, fresh from his identical role in George Lucas' Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.

Everything supports the story.I have some quibles and this was probably done to make a few of the special effects, easier and less expensive.  They loose some sense of place by showing only a pitch-black night background during the train station scene.

A lot of people who considering themselves ""X-Men"" elitists will tell you this film was horrible and was nothing like the original comic book.  Well, they're half-right.  Some of the things, like the origin of the entire X-men story were not completely the way they were made.  And customs were different, yadda yadda.  Look, I'm not an expert on them, I only read a few comics and watched the original cartoon.  Oh, and I read some of the Uncanny X-men...all very good stuff.  So, I somewhat know what went on with all the original stuff and let me get one thing straight: All the characters in this movie were perfectly cast.  I know that Rouge's character (played by the young and beautiful Anna Panquin) has been highly criticized.  But what they don't realize, is that this is Rouge when she was younger...so she had not developed her normal ""strong"" approach and attitude.  Some people just want to see all flash and bang and are quick to criticize.  Read the damn comic book until you die if this doesn't satisfy you.  As far as comic book movies, this one ranks right up there with the original Batman and Spider-man for greatness.  Anyway, now on to the appeal for the mass audiences...The X-Men takes places while the world is changing and recognizing humans evolving (mutating) into new creatures, per say.  A lot of controversy is stirring and sides are beginning to form in the mutant world, specifically between Magneto and Professor X.  They each have their team of men they aide them in their fight.  It's the typical good vs. bad idea.  Now, Magneto, he wants a mutant called Rouge...she possesses the ability to absorb other peoples' life-forces (and powers if they are mutants).  Magento wants her so he can use her (in a way I won't reveal) to open the eyes of the human public.  Professor X, along with his team of X-men, of course plan to stop Magneto.  There are also many subplots involving Wolverine (his relationship with Rouge and his past) and Magneto and Professor X's relationship.  With intelligent and entertaining dialogue, complex characters, the actors fluidity with each other, good fight scenes, magnificent special effects and an excellent story X-men will not disappoint.",5,"Satisfying, even if the nerds don't feel the same.",1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2231,"['Yeah', 'right', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'considering', 'X-Men', 'elitists', 'will', 'tell', 'film', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'nothing', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'Well', ""'re"", 'half-right', 'things', 'origin', 'entire', 'X-men', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'completely', 'way', 'were', 'made', 'customs', 'were', 'different', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'Look', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'only', 'read', 'few', 'comics', 'watched', 'original', 'cartoon', 'Oh', 'read', 'Uncanny', 'X-men', 'very', 'good', 'stuff', 'So', 'somewhat', 'know', 'went', 'original', 'stuff', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'know', 'Rouge', 'character', 'played', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Anna', 'Panquin', 'been', 'highly', 'criticized', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Rouge', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'so', 'had', 'not', 'developed', 'normal', 'strong', 'approach', 'attitude', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'flash', 'bang', 'are', 'quick', 'criticize', 'Read', 'damn', 'comic', 'book', 'die', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'As', 'far', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'one', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'original', 'Batman', 'Spider-man', 'greatness', 'Anyway', 'now', 'appeal', 'mass', 'audiences', 'X-Men', 'places', 'world', 'changing', 'recognizing', 'humans', 'evolving', 'mutating', 'new', 'creatures', 'say', 'lot', 'controversy', 'stirring', 'sides', 'are', 'beginning', 'form', 'mutant', 'world', 'specifically', 'Magneto', 'Professor', 'X', 'have', 'team', 'men', 'aide', 'fight', 'typical', 'good', 'vs.', 'bad', 'idea', 'Now', 'Magneto', 'mutant', 'called', 'Rouge', 'ability', 'absorb', 'other', 'peoples', 'life-forces', 'powers', 'are', 'mutants', 'Magento', 'can', 'use', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'open', 'eyes', 'human', 'public', 'Professor', 'X', 'team', 'X-men', 'course', 'plan', 'stop', 'Magneto', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'subplots', 'involving', 'Wolverine', 'relationship', 'Rouge', 'past', 'Magneto', 'Professor', 'X', 'relationship', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', 'dialogue', 'complex', 'characters', 'actors', 'fluidity', 'other', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'magnificent', 'special', 'effects', 'excellent', 'story', 'X-men', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint']",X-Men VHS
521376,A3LRFGYJVXKPDI,B00003CX8I,Bennett Turk,"[0, 5]","The ""X-Men"" movie had to make a lot of changes from the comic book to make it more acceptable to the general public.  In the orginal comic book, the X-men get their powers, because their parents were exposed to atomic raditation.  For example, Sunfire became a superpowered mutant because his mother was in Hiroshima when the bomb went off.  Soon after she gave birth to Sunfire, and then she died.  In contrast; the movie ""The Conqueror"" (1956), starring John Wayne, was filmed downwind of above ground atomic tests in Nevada and Utah.  About 70% of the people associated with this movie died of cancer.  There were no reports of superpowered mutant children being born afterwards.  Also, Mystique was an enemy of Ms. Mar-vel.  Mystigue tried to kill Ms. Mar-vel, then she murdered Dr. Michael Barrett, a friend of Ms. Mar-vel.  Then Rogue, an ally of Mystique tried to murder Ms. Mar-vel and in the process Rogue gained Ms. Mar-vel's super powered ablities.  Carol Danvers, (Ms. Mar-vel),  survived to become Binary and then Warbird.  Rogue left Mystique, because Ms. Mar-vel's memories were overwhelming her, and then she went to the X-Men seeking help for her condition.  In the movie, the X-Men get their powers from their genes, not from raditation, and there is no metion of Sunfire or Ms. Mar-vel.  Rogue and Mystique have no prior relationship with one another in the movie.  As far as the movie goes, it tries to compare prejudice between regular humans, and superpowered mutants to other types of racism based on skin color, or religion, and I feel that is overreaching. The film has a scene set at a WWII death camp and I think that including it was tasteless in the extreme.  Most Marvel comic books are set in New York City; will we get a Marvel superpowered person movie that includes scenes of 9-11-01 in it?  I hope not!  The film is okay as far as acting, photography, dialoge, and special effects for a movie based on a comic book, but, I wish Patrick Stewart and most of the others could find a film more worthy of their obvious talents.  In comparison to other comic book movies; ""Superman I"" and ""II"" were the best, followed by the ""Batman"" movies with Michael Keaton, then ""Spiderman"" with Toby McGuire, and ""X-Men"".  I did not see ""Daredevil"" with Ben Affeck, about a totally BLIND superhero!

And it's a movie that fans of the comic books have been waiting for over 30 years to see. Well, after all of this time, I think we can mostly thank George Lucas for developing the technology necessary to bring an incredible action film like this to life. &quot;X-Men&quot; is every bit as good as I knew it would be, just watching the previews at the movies. Just by the way the story was explained in the three minute preview, I knew that Bryan Singer was going about this the right way, which is ironically like the way the animated series went about it when it first debuted. I think I can give a lot of the credit to the cast picks, and the performances from Hugh Jackman (the best Wolverine we could've hoped for), Anna Paquin (a younger but nevertheless effective Rogue), and of course Patrick Stewart who beamed down from the Enterprise to become part of another successful franchise. Never blink during this movie - you might miss something. But I can't help but wonder what would be different if they had given Bryan Singer the extra six months he originally had...

I like how the movie doesn't make the mistake of introducing too many mutants at once, since I don't think that there would've been enough time to flesh everyone out. With that said, I am also very happy that they did not go too in depth with characters. This way, there is more room left to explore character's origins in the future films.While the action is forgettable, the story still progressed well. Characters developed nicely with highlights including Wolverine and Rouge's friendship and Xavier and Magneto's opposite ideologies for humans and mutants. The setting for the movie revolving around increased tension between humans and mutants was established quite well. All in all, director Bryan Singer did a good job. Original story, dialogue, and music make this movie something that will be cherished by both X-Men fans and newcomers alike.The movie keeps true to the comic book, but it doesn't come without its tweaks. Certain tweaks were expected, but some tweaks stand out more than others. The complicated and interesting rivalry between Wolverine and Sabretooth is... well... its not really there. Sure the two go at it a couple times in the movie, (and they take a disliking to each other quick), but the dialouge between them is pretty much absent.

The story wasn't sacrificed for the action although the story moves fast and there is a lot of action.  The introduction with Magneto and his parents being rounded up by the Nazis was compelling and helped make Magneto a little more sympathetic then he otherwise would have been.  Ian McClellan is great in the role.  All the actors do a good job, especially Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin.  The special effects are very impressive.  I especially liked the scene with Magneto tearing the train apart.  The fight scenes were exciting and well choreographed.I know there are those die hard fans of the comic book series who won't be happy with the exclusion of characters or the inconsistencies in the continuity of the Marvel Universe but even the comic changes over time.  I haven't regularly read an issue in years but I recall that Wolverine's claws are now bone.  As for remaining true to the spirit of the comics I think the movie did a great job.

Unlike other superhero films this one takes itself as a straight coin and does not attempt to create atmospheric moods of the Gotham City or The Crow. The film is fast paced like an hour long TV episode or a comic book; it raises the issues of the gifted and the creative being ostracized, but movesd too fast to explore it in any detail.

521391,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B00003CX8I,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","Bryan Singer has created a great opening to the X-Men movie franchise. The key to this type of film is not to play it too comic bookish and also not to play it too seriously. Singer does a good job on both counts. With great casting and a quickly moving plot line the X-Men movie is a pleasure to watch and as Singer puts it in his commentary a good trailer for the next movie in the series.There are many characters in the X-Men universe but the film wisely introduces the viewer to a small group of them who will be essential to the story. In the America of the not too distant future a debate rages as to whether mutants (those with special powers) should be made to register with the government. To Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) this is just too close to his childhood which was spent in a Polish concentration camp. He has gathered his Brotherhood of Mutants in order to battle this registration scheme. He intends to use a special radiation emitting device which will turn all into mutants. His group includes Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) the Toad (Ray Park) and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn).Opposing the Brotherhood's Plans id Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who believes in a peaceful existence between mutants and the humans. He runs a school for mutant children that preaches inclusion rather than fear and exclusion. His star students who teach at his Academy have not rejoined the world. They are the X-Men. The X-Men that are featured are the weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry), the lasar eyed Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Into his group comes a teen who cannot touch others, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and a man who has been equipped with claw like weapons named Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).To give away more of the story would ruin the fun. This is the best type of action movie both intelligent and quick moving. One can only hope that future movies in the series will follow the same outline. I viewed this film in the special two-disc edition that includes the director commentary, an extended viewing mode with 17 incorporated branching featurettes and a number of special features introduced by Singer on a second disc.Of the many comic book movies released in the last few years this is one of the best that I've seen.

I saw it in the theaters 5 times and reserved it on Amazon.com the minute it was available.  Of course, I have been an X-Men fan since I was 3 years old and have been waiting ever since I can remember for a movie about the X-Men to come out.  I was skeptical about the movie at first seeing the quality of other comic book movies, but this movie is a masterpiece.  The actors portray their roles well, the special effects are very nice, and the overall translation from comic to movie was pretty near perfect.  Perfectionists will be critical about the way Singer presented the origins of some of the characters since they are not completely on spot with the comics, and true sticklers for detail may be disappointed with the costumes.  I think it would have been a mistake to use the comic costumes in the movie because they just don't fit in to a real life scenario.  The costumes used in the movie still look comic book like, but appear more like &quot;customized uniforms&quot; if you will.  The movie leaves very little to be desired.  I recommend any fan of Action Movies, Comical Movies, or Sci-Fi Movies to purchase this DVD or VHS.  As for the quality of the DVD itself- its just as perfect as the movie.  In terms of picture, the colors and detail are depicted in perfect quality on this DVD.  The sound has to be the best I've heard on a DVD.

I primarily keep trying to find good ones because of hubby's enjoying them after a hard day in the office. I would have never viewed this film without my online friend Ellen M recommending it to me.  What a surprise to find a genuinely creative idea, a coherent, well-written script and excellent exposition of the story, while using special effects, but not being blinded by the glory of special effects.  The premise is that there are two types of people in the USA.  One is a regular person with no abilities out of the ordinary.  The other is mutants with each mutant having his or her own special paranormal power.  There is a shape shifter, a telepath, one with electrical power, another with the ability to adapt any other mutant's power and so forth.  A Senator has been stirring the regular people into a frenzy over the mutants, recommending that they be purged.  The mutants have 2 camps: a peaceful one which mainly wants to defend itself if attacked and, another, that wishes to attack and eradicate the regulars.  Sir Ian McClellan does a very able job of playing the main bad-guy mutant without turning him into a caricature.  The special effects, which show the powers of the mutants, are dazzling but they do not subsume the entire film.

Bryan Singer is a wonderful director and writer, and I felt he did an excellent job with it. He co-wrote the script along with Tom DeSanto. The cast is perfect for their roles, especially Hugh Jackman. There's so many big-name actors that could've been wrongly-chosen to play Wolvervine, but this Australian actor was born to play Logan. He has the look and everything down. I am so glad Fox didn't make the mistake of getting together a director and production team that would turn the film into a camp-fest, like Warner Bros. let Joel Schumacher do on the hideous &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;.The only complaint I had on X-Men was the editing. I read the movie tie-in novel before I saw the movie, and the movie leaves out several things I liked. For instance, the script had scenes showing when Storm and Cyclops first discover their powers. It had the Blackbird Jet appearing in the beginning when they rescue Logan and Rogue, causing it to appear twice. Also some scenes from the book I liked were filmed and then cut, and appear as deleted scenes on the DVD (I'm glad they let you view the movie with the scenes intact). Actually the only cut scenes I miss that much are when Storm is teaching the class (which only snippets of this scene made it into the final cut, being interwoven with a monologue from the Professor), and subsequently when she talks to Rogue after class ends, and the scene where Cyclops asks Logan if he will follow orders in the Ready Room, and gives Logan his uniform. I thought the &quot;Ready Room&quot; scene was great because it gave the two characters a scene with just them where they could become friends without any distractions. But other than that, the movie rocks. It has to be the best comic book adaption since Tim Burton's first &quot;Batman&quot; in 1989.

521401,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00003CX8I,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","As an adaptation, I think, this outing from Marvel's partnerships with Hollywood isn't quite as good as the first two Spiderman films.  Of course, the special effects are splendid (Storm calling up the weather, Magneto at work, his henchman Toad hopping about flourishing an incredible tongue, shapechanger Mystique, and Wolverine's claws, to name a few), and Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier was an inspired casting choice.  But there's a certain darkness to the movie that isn't just about Marvel angst (I would have preferred to see the costumes from the original comics rather than a generic uniform, for one thing).  What's more, the focus is less on the X-Men as a whole than on Wolverine (perhaps to be expected considering his fan base!) and Magneto.  And even without being able to read Magneto's mind, it seems that a genius like Xavier, with the advantage of his long acquaintance with Magneto, would at least entertain the possibility that it's Rogue, not Wolverine, that he wants.  (Wolvie, after all, has apparently been out and about for a while before we meet him by way of Rogue, the newly-fledged Mississipian mutant who has run away from home in terror of what her powers do to people.)  On the other hand, Magneto is a villain with whom one can almost sympathize (especially considering that we learn early on that he survived the Nazi Holocaust and therefore fears that mutants may be the target of another such program--or should that be pogrom?).  I'm hoping that the subsequent chapters will give Cyclops, Jean Gray, and Storm more chance to shine.

Well you got yourself the best example ever in X-Men.First off we all know the story, mutants, Professor X, and Wolverine.  It's all good, the fan boys have bought this film to death.  So my review is geared towards the non-fan boys.  Because they should be the only ones that do not own this film yet.By the way fan boy = comic book lover.So heres the dealeo.  X-Men starts off by telling us the tragic story of how mutants and humans are having trouble coexisting, this burr is stuck between a certain senators unmentionables.  Thus creating stress between the two races.  In comes Magneto (picture villian with power to control magnetism)a mutant with a cause.  To kick all humans ....  Here enters Prof. X the good guy with mind powers and his X-Men (basically lots of mutants that help the fella out)  Plus we get treated to how these characters focus around two other mutants, Rogue and Wolverine who meet up in the Canadian outback.  The story then progesses along and well I won't tell you anymore, sorta ruins the whole movie watching process.The DVD in itself is awesome with really neat interactive menus and lots of goodies to keep one entertained for awhile.  But I think they should have at least added in mutant biographies to give non-comic fans an idea of who these characters are and describe them a bit better.  All in all though..it's still super well done.The story and movie is excellent as it has a lot of action scenes to keep everyone buckled in.  Plus the acting is a pure treat to watch.  The actors in this movie really made it work.  Just a great movie to sit down and watch.In closing, if your not a comic book fan and thinking ""eh is it really worth it?"" my answer yes it is, it is at least a must rent and a eventual must own.  Great watch and feast for the eyes, the special effects are great and nothing is done below the par level.  So go out and get this film people, what still reading this review?  Go!

The menus are a lot like the official website for the movie if you had the chance to check that out last Spring when all the hype was in full swing.As for the movie itself, it's very good, perhaps the best super-hero movie ever made. Director Bryan Singer does a good job of establishing each of the main characters. While not everyone gets the amount of screen time Wolverine does, you get a pretty good sense who these characters are and what they're about.The story is essentially drawn from the X-Men comic book, featuring the team's battle against the violent mutant forces of Magneto, the mutant master of magnetism. Pitted against the X-Men's telepathic mentor, Dr. Charles Xavier, Magneto poses as Malcolm X to Xavier's Martin Luther King. While Xavier wants to establish a peaceful coexistence for mutants among humans, Magneto does not believe humanity will ever accept mutants and therefore adopts a more violent approach.The script could have used a little more tweaking here and there. The dialogue's clunky at times and the one liners aren't very original. The cinematography gives you a pretty good sense of a comic book come to life without going overboard like the Batman films or Dick Tracy. Nothing against those movies, but X-Men takes a more realistic approach to telling a super-hero story.The DVD also includes the trailers and a nice interview with Singer.

521409,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00003CX8I,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[1, 1]","This Comic book to screen adaptation is one of the best of its type, well cast, well paced, and set up for its first sequel.I haven't read an X Men comic in at least 25 years--since the 70's. Since then the comic books have become enormously popular, but I've not kept up or knew much about it at all.I have fond memories of the clever, creative series and it quickly took the place of the mid 60's Superman, Batman, DC Gang comic books. But I grew out of comic books and I've not been overly nostalgic looking back at them. Oh sure I've wandered into comic book collector stores and peaked at a few old issues, stuff I remember having as a kid....X MENI'm sure not having a strong recollection of any story line and barely recalling some of the characters was a plus in my enjoying the 'surprises' of the film. I found the film wonderfully cast. Patrick Stewart makes a great Professor Xavier. Though Wolverine I understand is basically a dwarf in the comics, I don't think much is lost by having him full sized in the film. Ian McKellan plays a pretty old Magneto (but whow cares? he's having a good time and so are we).They did a wonderful job with it I thought. At times the film was almost touching, and without slowing down the fast pace of its character introductions, plot mechanics or action.Unfortunately, when you come to the end you realize the huge hurdle that any of these movies face. You want to end a movie like this, satisfying the audience but leaving them wanting a little more.Of course there's no mystery about the wanting a little more part. The movie was done well, it will do good box office and so there will of course be a sequel. The lead actors have agreements in place to be in a couple of sequels, though director Singer isn't a sure thing. There will be another X Men movie,probably within a couple years. So the movie isn't exactly complete because unlike a movie where you aren't sure if there will be a sequel or not, you already know not only will the film  continue, it's already in several of the actors contracts. So they don't have to wrap everything up, they can have characters rush off to find themselves and not show us or tell us a thing about it, because there's gonna be a sequel.I enjoyed the humor, the relationships, the special effects. The darker parts of the story I thought all were well balanced and the film didn't stop dead as we explored some disturbing revelations (as happened in the Batman films for instance). Because of the intelligent script and good acting the film isn't as shallow as most comic books to the screen conversions have been.The film has some drawbacks. It was pretty much the Wolverine story, and several characters were given short shrift. Halle Berry was given almost nothing to do with her character of Storm. The reaction of the character to situations was also very slow. Berry's casting and performance may be the weakest thing about the film, but the script gave her so little to do it's impossible to determine if she would have been good were the part better written for her.Some of the wire work stunt scenes were fairly obvious, but I much prefer this style of filmed stunts than CGI. I get a sense real people are doing the action scene and acrobatics at least part of the time, rather than most of it being computer generated.It was a real drawback that we never see Cyclops and Jean interact as a couple to know how 'special' their relationship is. If we had, the triangle would have worked much better.Bruce Davison who plays the Senator is usually very enjoyable in whatever he does, and he's quite good here and deserves a mention.Bryan (Usual Suspects) Singer has directed one of the most  enjoyable, comic book movies I've ever seen and I anticipate many successful sequels (particularly if he agrees to direct another).Now give me 80 or 90 mil, and a collection of Green Lantern books to refresh my memory and I'll turn it into a great 2 hour and 20 minute movie.

Patrick Stewart makes the PERFECT Professor X just as Halle Berry makes the Perfect Storm.  Another thing I liked about the movie is that the creators decided to have the X-Men wear black suits instead of the colorful ones that are in the comic books.  This really helped the visual appeal of this movie, because it seemed less like a comic book and more like a movie.  The acting is this movie was suprisingly good as well, Xavier, Rogue, Storm and Magneto did a spectacular job as well as the other characters who are not well known actors (at least not to me.) The special effects in this movie were done perfectly, and were used in the right place at the right time.  Nothing was overdone in this movie.  I guess if I could find one bad thing about this movie is the fact that there were limited characters on each side, the X-Man in this movie were Storm, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Rogue and of course Charles Xavier.  On the other side, there was Sabertooth, Toad, Mystic and Magneto. However, from the talks I have been hearing, there WILL be a sequel and they will more than likely feature more characters.  I am hoping that the sequel will be just as good or possibly even better than the original.

The sequels are going to be awesome!"" A lot like how the Empire Strikes Back was an alright movie, but let's face it, it was really just a long hype up for Return of the Jedi.While being a great movie, X-Men has the problem many movies have. A great story with a lot of things left out, unexplained, or that could have been fixed. I never read the comic books growing up, but listening to my friends who did, I had enough knowledge to wonder why they never covered Storm's claustraphobia when she was in the elevator shaft, or why Rogue was so young.Then there's Halle Berry for Storm. I know, ""she's sooooo hot!!"" But she's not that great of an actor in this movie. Expecially when you give her an accent. She looks the part, but the director needed to work with her some more. Expecially when it comes to her lines. I've never met anyone who's disagreed that her line to Toad when she fries him has to be one of the dumbest lines in movie history. And when they were trying to save Rogue, why couldn't she fly up to her? SHE CAN FLY!! Perhaps I just had a problem with her portrayal of Storm.  I'm used to the bold...Storm and not one that looks scared or sad all the time.As other have said, Sabertooth was a [softy.]And Toad!? He's the dumbest villian in the whole series. At least they got him out of the way early.Finally there's Jean Grey. Great role, but needed a hotter actress. Not to be picky, but I HAVE seen how she's drawn in the comics. They just didn't portray her well enough.But now that that's all out of my system, I will say that the rest of the movie was great. It made me quite excited for the sequel. Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine.  Before I saw the movie I thought the biggest challenge would be making Wolverine's hair look normal.  And no one other than Patrick Stewart would work for Professior X.Again, this is a great movie with a few flaws.  Perhaps they'll fix all them in the sequel knowing people will go see it.As for me, I feel like such a nerd...I'm gonna go shower.

There may have been some other people in the movie as well, I didn't really notice. Wait, I think there was a guy who shot laser beams out of his eyes; I noticed him because a couple of times he stood in front of Hugh Jackman, blocking my view.Seriously, this film does hail the first American appearance of what is surely a new star. As Wolverine, Jackman hits just the right notes of rage tempered with vulnerablity. Director Brian Singer deserves major kudos for channeling 40 years of best selling comic books into a comprehensible 2 hour movie, although much of the comic book mythology has been jettisoned. (Rogue, for example, has no prior history with either Mystique or Magneto.) Still, the spirit is here, and while the film occasionally bogs down a bit (everything to do with the bigoted senator is a bit of a snooze for me) it reenergizes whenever Jackman is on the screen, particularlly in his scenes with Rogue.X-Men 2 is in the works, and those who have read the script say it will be better than the first installment.

Directed by Bryan Singer, the film stars - amongst others - Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn.Mutants are seen as the next step in humankind's evolution and born with a slightly different genetic makeup - a variation that generally brings a superpower with it. You won't necessarily be able to tell just by looking at someone they're a mutant, however - in many cases, mutants look just like normal humans. In fact, only three of the characters in the film - Toad, Mystique and Sabretooth - look anyway different. In most cases, a mutant won't even know that they are a mutant until they reach puberty - which is generally when their powers 'switch on'. Throw in an unhealthy dose of widespread anti-mutant sentiment, and an over-complicated adolescence gets even worse.Rogue is one such teenager. The poor girl enjoys her first kiss, and sees her young boyfriend collapse into a coma. Unfortunately for Rogue, her mutant superpower is destined to make her lonelier than most : skin-on-skin contact with another human will see her absorbing that person's life-force. (Although she doesn't know it at first, touching another mutant will also see her - briefly - gaining that mutant's superpower). In a blind panic, she flees - running more or less randomly to small-town Alaska. There, she finally has a bit of luck - when she runs into Wolverine, a cagefighter who's also a mutant. Originally known as Logan, Wolverine has an adamantium skeleton, a very sensitive nose, and a hyperactive healing factor. (You can injure him - he just won't stay injured for very long). However, he doesn't have much of a past - Wolverine's life is a mystery even to him. Unfortunately, the pair have barely made their introductions before they're dragged into a war...On their way out of town, Rogue and Wolverine are attacked by Sabretooth - a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, led my Magneto. Luckily, two X-Men called Storm and Cyclops arrive to help, and take the pair back to their base in New York State. The initial assumption is that Magneto wanted Wolverine for some reason. The X-Men's leader - Professor Charles Xavier, the world's most powerful telepath and a one-time friend of Magneto's - wants to find out why. He asks Wolverine agrees to stay a little while and, in return, the Prof will try to help Logan remember his past. Rogue, meanwhile, is enrolled at the  Professor's School for Gifted Youngsters. The school could be viewed as a cover of sorts : the Professor's abilities are not public knowledge, though the 'gifted youngsters' are actually mutants. The purpose of the school is to train young mutants how to properly - and responsibly - control and use their powers. The Professor also believes humans and mutants can live peacefully, side-by-side - Magneto, on the other hand, disagrees.Magneto is not alone in his belief : Senator Kelly - a 'standard', though influential, human - sees mutants as something to be feared and, therefore, requiring control. The Senator very strongly advocates the Mutant Registration Act, though he wants even more than that. ""If it were up to me"", he says ""I'd lock them all away"". If it weren't for people like Kelly raising the stakes and talking of imprisoning people without trial, this war may never have needed fought...A cracking superhero movie overall. There's a bit more of Wolverine than any of the other heroes, though there is a heavy side-order of Rogue - who I liked a lot more onscreen, than did in print. (I was very impressed with Paquin's performance as Rogue, and also Romijn as Mystique. A member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Mystique is a shapeshifter. However, while she doesn't look human in her natural form, she does look very cool). The sparring between Cyclops and Wolverine also worked very well, and provided a few comic moments. I wasn't too impressed with Storm, though - her contribution to the movie was pretty much non-existent. That may well have been down to the writing, but I'm not sure Halle Berry was all that bothered about making the most of her screen-time. Still, other than that, a very enjoyable show.",4,Welcome to Mutant High.,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,4263,"['X-Men', 'based', 'Marvel', 'comic-book', 'series', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', '2000', 'Directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'film', 'amongst', 'others', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn.Mutants', 'are', 'seen', 'next', 'step', 'humankind', 'evolution', 'born', 'slightly', 'different', 'genetic', 'makeup', 'variation', 'generally', 'superpower', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'just', 'looking', 'someone', ""'re"", 'mutant', 'however', 'many', 'cases', 'mutants', 'look', 'just', 'normal', 'humans', 'fact', 'only', 'three', 'characters', 'film', 'Toad', 'Mystique', 'Sabretooth', 'look', 'anyway', 'different', 'most', 'cases', 'mutant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'are', 'mutant', 'reach', 'puberty', 'generally', 'when', 'powers', ""'switch"", 'Throw', 'unhealthy', 'dose', 'widespread', 'anti-mutant', 'sentiment', 'over-complicated', 'adolescence', 'even', 'worse.Rogue', 'one', 'such', 'teenager', 'poor', 'girl', 'first', 'kiss', 'young', 'boyfriend', 'collapse', 'coma', 'Unfortunately', 'Rogue', 'mutant', 'superpower', 'destined', 'make', 'lonelier', 'most', 'skin-on-skin', 'contact', 'human', 'will', 'see', 'absorbing', 'person', 'life-force', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'touching', 'mutant', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'briefly', 'gaining', 'mutant', 'superpower', 'blind', 'panic', 'running', 'more', 'less', 'randomly', 'small-town', 'Alaska', 'finally', 'bit', 'luck', 'when', 'Wolverine', 'cagefighter', 'who', 'also', 'mutant', 'Originally', 'known', 'Logan', 'Wolverine', 'adamantium', 'skeleton', 'very', 'sensitive', 'nose', 'hyperactive', 'healing', 'factor', 'can', 'injure', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'injured', 'very', 'long', 'However', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'past', 'Wolverine', 'life', 'mystery', 'even', 'Unfortunately', 'pair', 'have', 'barely', 'made', 'introductions', ""'re"", 'dragged', 'war', 'way', 'town', 'Rogue', 'Wolverine', 'are', 'attacked', 'Sabretooth', 'member', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutants', 'led', 'Magneto', 'Luckily', 'two', 'X-Men', 'called', 'Storm', 'Cyclops', 'arrive', 'help', 'take', 'pair', 'back', 'base', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'initial', 'assumption', 'Magneto', 'wanted', 'Wolverine', 'reason', 'X-Men', 'leader', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'world', 'most', 'powerful', 'telepath', 'one-time', 'friend', 'Magneto', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Wolverine', 'agrees', 'stay', 'little', 'while', 'return', 'Prof', 'will', 'try', 'help', 'Logan', 'remember', 'past', 'Rogue', 'meanwhile', 'enrolled', 'Professor', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Youngsters', 'school', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'cover', 'sorts', 'Professor', 'abilities', 'are', 'not', 'public', 'knowledge', ""'gifted"", 'youngsters', 'are', 'actually', 'mutants', 'purpose', 'school', 'train', 'young', 'mutants', 'how', 'properly', 'responsibly', 'control', 'use', 'powers', 'Professor', 'also', 'humans', 'mutants', 'can', 'live', 'peacefully', 'side-by-side', 'Magneto', 'other', 'hand', 'disagrees.Magneto', 'not', 'alone', 'belief', 'Senator', 'Kelly', ""'standard"", 'influential', 'human', 'mutants', 'something', 'be', 'feared', 'therefore', 'requiring', 'control', 'Senator', 'very', 'strongly', 'Mutant', 'Registration', 'Act', 'even', 'more', 'were', 'up', ""'d"", 'lock', 'away', 'were', ""n't"", 'people', 'Kelly', 'raising', 'stakes', 'talking', 'imprisoning', 'people', 'trial', 'war', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'needed', 'fought', 'cracking', 'superhero', 'movie', 'overall', 'bit', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'other', 'heroes', 'heavy', 'side-order', 'Rogue', 'who', 'liked', 'lot', 'more', 'onscreen', 'did', 'print', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Paquin', 'performance', 'Rogue', 'also', 'Romijn', 'Mystique', 'member', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutants', 'Mystique', 'shapeshifter', 'However', ""n't"", 'look', 'human', 'natural', 'form', 'look', 'very', 'cool', 'sparring', 'Cyclops', 'Wolverine', 'also', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'provided', 'few', 'comic', 'moments', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'Storm', 'contribution', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-existent', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'down', 'writing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'bothered', 'making', 'most', 'screen-time', 'Still', 'other', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'show']",X-Men VHS

521420,A169I83JL8QJGN,B00003CX8I,Daniel A Moir,"[2, 2]","Fear and dread crept over me as I first began to follow the making of this movie. I cringed as Ana Paquin was announced as Rogue, I cried when they didn't cast Derek DeLint as Magneto (who looks a lot like Jim Lee's interpretation of the character) and when I found out that Beast would not be making an appearance in this film I lost all hope for this movie being any good. I figured that X-Men would enter the tradition of [bad] super hero flicks along side the Batman movies... Thankfully Bryan Singer and David Hayter (AKA Solid Snake of Metal Gear fame) are geniuses and handled the X-Men, the limited budget, the costumes and everything with a surprising accuracy that made me see this movie almost as much as I saw Episode 1 when that came out. Only with this film it wasn't the title of the movie (though I am a huge X-fan) but the movie itself. X-Men was surprisingly well written, and now I've sworn to marry Ana Paquin... For what they set out to do, although her accent could have been more consistent, she worked perfectly as Rogue, and Ian McKellin is fantastic as Magneto, no... Perfect. These actors (except Hally Berry as Storm) became the characters for me. They worked out so much better than I had though, especially new comer Hugh Jackman's incredibly accurate portrayal of Wolverine. Jackman IS Wolverine as far as anybody needs to know. The story is much better than most comic to movie translations, and the best part is that the movie stays in the grays the way that the comics do, not having any villains that are just pure evil (except Sabretooth, who is sadly under used in this film.) The fact of the matter is that X-Men is definitely a super hero flick done right, it stays true to the spirit of the comics with only Storm being a disappointment. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it's mostly tongue in cheek, and over all the movie is a lot of fun for people of all ages, weither or not they're X-fans, I firmly believe that most people looking for a good action drama will love X-Men.

521421,A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2,B00003CX8I,"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru""","[5, 6]","Normally when I watch a movie based on a comic book I cut it a bit of slack when it comes to things like character motivation.  After all, we are dealing with characters who are larger than life.  Heroes wear white and are motivated by a sense of justice, villains wear black and do their evil deeds basically because they are evil.This sort of basic motivation has even snuck into mainstream movies.  Gladiator and The Patriot both had villains who, when asked why they do the evil deeds they do could be expected to reply, &quot;Because I'm the bad guy and that's my job.&quot;  The heroes of these movies are motivated by revenge rather than justice.Here comes X-Men and shows them up with style.  On one side we have Normal Human Senator Kelly, out to register Mutants because he is afraid of them.  He is afraid they will make him obsolete, afraid they have the ability to destroy him at will and he has no way to protect himself from them except by marking them as dangerous beings.On the other side is Magneto, a mutant with the power to control metal and a survivor of the Holocaust.  He sees this as an attempt to bring back those bad old days and is ready to fight it at all costs.Both of these villains have motives that are wholly understandable.  In today's movies that is unusual.  In a movie based on a comic book it seems remarkable.In between these two forces are the X-Men led by Professor Xavier who is out to keep the peace, prevent Senator Kelly's Anti Mutant law from being passed by legitimate debate and similarly try to keep Magneto from killing Normal Humans.  His team rescues Wolverine (Hugh Jackman in what should be a star making performance) and Rogue (The lovely Anna Paquin) from an attack by Magneto.Purists to the comic book may balk at the variations from the original, but these things almost always happen when translating a story from one medium to another.  Even a simple origin story like Superman went through variations when translated to film.  The fact of the matter is that this movie treated the source material with respect in a quest to make a decent movie and the result is a movie which should have been hyped as an event when initially released.",5,Comic Book Adaptation to Rival Superman-The Movie,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,2197,"['Normally', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'cut', 'bit', 'slack', 'when', 'things', 'character', 'motivation', 'are', 'dealing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'Heroes', 'white', 'are', 'motivated', 'sense', 'justice', 'villains', 'wear', 'black', 'do', 'evil', 'deeds', 'basically', 'are', 'evil.This', 'sort', 'basic', 'motivation', 'even', 'snuck', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'Gladiator', 'Patriot', 'had', 'villains', 'who', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'do', 'evil', 'do', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'reply', 'quot', ""'m"", 'bad', 'guy', 'job.', 'quot', 'heroes', 'movies', 'are', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'rather', 'justice.Here', 'X-Men', 'up', 'style', 'one', 'side', 'have', 'Normal', 'Human', 'Senator', 'Kelly', 'register', 'Mutants', 'afraid', 'afraid', 'will', 'make', 'obsolete', 'afraid', 'have', 'ability', 'destroy', 'will', 'way', 'protect', 'marking', 'dangerous', 'other', 'side', 'Magneto', 'mutant', 'power', 'control', 'metal', 'survivor', 'Holocaust', 'attempt', 'bring', 'back', 'bad', 'old', 'days', 'ready', 'fight', 'costs.Both', 'villains', 'have', 'motives', 'are', 'wholly', 'understandable', 'today', 'movies', 'unusual', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'remarkable.In', 'two', 'forces', 'are', 'X-Men', 'led', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'who', 'out', 'keep', 'peace', 'prevent', 'Senator', 'Kelly', 'Anti', 'Mutant', 'law', 'being', 'passed', 'legitimate', 'debate', 'similarly', 'try', 'keep', 'Magneto', 'killing', 'Normal', 'Humans', 'team', 'rescues', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'star', 'making', 'performance', 'Rogue', 'lovely', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'attack', 'Magneto.Purists', 'comic', 'book', 'may', 'balk', 'variations', 'original', 'things', 'almost', 'always', 'happen', 'when', 'translating', 'story', 'one', 'medium', 'Even', 'simple', 'origin', 'story', 'Superman', 'went', 'variations', 'when', 'translated', 'film', 'fact', 'matter', 'movie', 'treated', 'source', 'material', 'respect', 'quest', 'make', 'decent', 'movie', 'result', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hyped', 'event', 'when', 'initially', 'released']",X-Men VHS
521422,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CX8I,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 12]","Even when I was really into comics more than a few years ago, the X-Men just never really appealed to me.  Maybe it was the fact that I really didn't know the story behind each character; that was certainly one of the issues I had with this film.  Granted, my encounters with the X-Men have been few and far between, but I've just never seen much of anything behind any of the characters other than Dr. Charles Xavier and Wolverine.  I followed Wolverine during the first couple of years of his first solo comic, largely because he was a complicated, mysterious, deadly character with great depth and passion, a man still trying to discover what he truly was.  Despite his mutant powers, Wolverine always comes across as a human being, with all the positives and negatives that implies.  Without him, I can't connect with any of the other mutants, so I think the filmmakers definitely had the right idea when they used Wolverine as their cinematic conduit to the viewing public.This is a rather unusual film, in that it was obviously written with sequels in mind - there's not a very big sense of completion to this film at all.  Not only does it refrain from supplying some important answers, it doesn't even get around to asking all of the questions yet.  The first half of the movie basically serves to introduce us to all the major players.  Even still, I feel like I know next to nothing about Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden); in actuality, I can't work up much of a reason to even care about those two very much.  I have to wonder, though, if Cyclops is supposed to be so annoyingly prissy; Marsden seems to be channeling a Footloose-era Tom Cruise, which made it impossible for me to like his character.  I can't complain about the two heavyweights in this particular arena, though.  Patrick Stewart adds an important air of believability to a story that could have easily stumbled down the road toward campiness, while Ian McKellan - a rather surprising choice to play Magneto, I feel - actually brings gravitas to a role that seems quite beneath him.  The special effects are quite impressive, and the story is interesting enough, but I'm not sure this film would have worked without Stewart and McKellan.As I mentioned earlier, I tend to look upon this (for the most part) as Wolverine's movie.  Hugh Jackman pretty much nails his character, in terms of both the look and the attitude.  Despite his personal preference for solitude, Wolverine's the one who helps Rogue out when she's trying to find her bearings; most of what we learn about Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) and Cyclops are a direct result of the connection he makes with Grey; he is the one who draws the most important information out of Dr. Xavier, etc.  The movie doesn't really bring this out, but Wolverine also has a special rivalry with Sabretooth (Tyler Mane, who doesn't do the character a whole lot of justice to my eyes).In terms of the plot, you basically watch Logan and Rogue slowly make a place for themselves among the X-Men, eventually coming together with Grey, Cyclops, and Storm to prevent Xavier's old, wayward buddy Magneto from succeeding in his dastardly plan to establish the dominance of mutants over human society - even if it means inciting a war between humans and mutants.  Honestly, it isn't the most impressive script I've ever seen, basically putting the ultimate fate of the film in the hands of the actors and actresses bringing the story to life.

521423,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CX8I,Daniel McInnis,"[0, 2]","Maybe I shouldn't have expected much from the X-Men but with Bryan Singer at the helm and his Apt Pupil star Ian McKellen in front of the camera I figured at the very least it would be entertaining.  And it is that, but my biggest complaint is that the first twenty minutes are so exceptional in the way the transend the typical comic book fare that it's a shame to see the rest of the movie fall apart.  It's as though Fox executives somewhere along the line saw the dalies and reminded Singer that he was making a much anticipated summer blockbuster, which brings with it certain expectations.  These expectations are met in the form of off-the-wall action, flamboyant characters that take themselves far too seriously and lots of eye candy.If I had to pick a star out of the ensemble cast it'd have to be Hugh Jackman, who's the only actor to leave any kind of an impression, in the role of Wolverine.  He's a mutant drifter with an uncanny knack for healing himself who uses his powers, he also has retractable blades in his forearms, to fight his way out of trouble.  He travels from city to city, town to town, making money at tough man contests.  Being as the Aussie's a bit of a pretty boy, and bears a remarkable resemblence to Gladiator star Russell Crowe, none of the bar thugs want to concede that he's the better man, even after he's pumbled their peers.  So naturally he cleans up at these events, or at least until he meets a young girl and fellow mutant named Rouge.  Rouge's power (or in this case curse) is that she drains the lifeforce out of anybody she touches, even if it's inadventant.Reluctantly Wolverine takes up with Rouge and the duo hit the road.  And it's not long after that they find themselves targeted by an evil mutant, Magneto (McKellen), bent on waging war on the humans.  He's loathing of mankind is spawned from surviving the Holocaust, and having seen the depths to which we're capable he decides to vanquish us.  He's met with opposition from a professor, Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who operates a school for the gifted.  Little does the taxpaying public know that this school is actually teaching mutants to hone their abilites, in this case in a positive way.Chief skeptic to that fact is a Senator whose overwhelming fear of the mutants leads him to press for a bill that would act as a segregation law to seperate their kind from ours.  With mutants already having to endure an intolderably high number of threats this bill would only serve to condone the behavior of those who would perpetrate these hate crimes.  With his hopefulness in mankind contuniously sinking, Magneto takes the first step towards war by kidnapping the Senator and turning him into a mutant himself.  By doing this to him, and others like him, Magneto fells he can take control of the Congress and ultimately the world.Scribe David Hayter makes a concerted effort to blur the lines between good and evil, but instead of making the film more thoughtful he only confuses the situation more.  He tries to do exactly what I'm critizing the film for not doing enough of, and I in turn am critizing him for that.  Maybe the X-Men just can't win with me.  Or maybe it's that inconsistency, the poor balancing act done between social satire and breakneck action that perturbs me so.  The filmmakers seem uncertain in the direction they want to take to movie, so they oversimplify things.  They allow the picture to switch gears at random which sends the story into a tailspin.But what did I expect? Unfarmilar with the D.C. comic, and not being a particular fan of comics turned into films in general, I must admit a bias against this movie going in.  So maybe I'm not best suited to judge a film of this genre, but I can only hope that Ang Lee's upcoming The Incredible Hulk realizes the potential that I saw in this picture's first few minutes.",2,X-Men  Misses  It's  Mark,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,3857,"['Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'much', 'X-Men', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'helm', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'star', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'front', 'camera', 'figured', 'very', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'so', 'exceptional', 'way', 'transend', 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'fare', 'shame', 'see', 'rest', 'movie', 'fall', 'apart', 'Fox', 'executives', 'somewhere', 'line', 'saw', 'dalies', 'reminded', 'Singer', 'was', 'making', 'much', 'anticipated', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'certain', 'expectations', 'expectations', 'are', 'met', 'form', 'off-the-wall', 'action', 'flamboyant', 'characters', 'take', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', 'lots', 'eye', 'candy.If', 'had', 'pick', 'star', 'ensemble', 'cast', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'only', 'actor', 'leave', 'kind', 'impression', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'mutant', 'drifter', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'healing', 'who', 'powers', 'also', 'retractable', 'blades', 'forearms', 'fight', 'way', 'trouble', 'city', 'city', 'town', 'town', 'making', 'money', 'tough', 'man', 'contests', 'Being', 'Aussie', 'bit', 'pretty', 'boy', 'remarkable', 'resemblence', 'Gladiator', 'star', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'none', 'bar', 'thugs', 'want', 'concede', 'better', 'man', 'even', 'pumbled', 'peers', 'So', 'naturally', 'up', 'events', 'least', 'young', 'girl', 'fellow', 'mutant', 'named', 'Rouge', 'Rouge', 'power', 'case', 'curse', 'lifeforce', 'anybody', 'even', 'inadventant.Reluctantly', 'Wolverine', 'up', 'Rouge', 'duo', 'hit', 'road', 'not', 'long', 'find', 'targeted', 'evil', 'mutant', 'Magneto', 'McKellen', 'bent', 'waging', 'war', 'humans', 'loathing', 'mankind', 'spawned', 'surviving', 'Holocaust', 'having', 'seen', 'depths', ""'re"", 'capable', 'vanquish', 'met', 'opposition', 'professor', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'who', 'school', 'gifted', 'Little', 'taxpaying', 'public', 'know', 'school', 'actually', 'teaching', 'mutants', 'hone', 'abilites', 'case', 'positive', 'way.Chief', 'skeptic', 'fact', 'Senator', 'overwhelming', 'fear', 'mutants', 'press', 'bill', 'would', 'act', 'segregation', 'law', 'seperate', 'kind', 'ours', 'mutants', 'already', 'having', 'endure', 'intolderably', 'high', 'number', 'threats', 'bill', 'would', 'only', 'serve', 'condone', 'behavior', 'who', 'would', 'perpetrate', 'hate', 'crimes', 'hopefulness', 'mankind', 'contuniously', 'sinking', 'Magneto', 'first', 'step', 'towards', 'war', 'kidnapping', 'Senator', 'turning', 'mutant', 'doing', 'others', 'Magneto', 'can', 'take', 'control', 'Congress', 'ultimately', 'world.Scribe', 'David', 'Hayter', 'concerted', 'effort', 'blur', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'instead', 'making', 'film', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'only', 'situation', 'more', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'critizing', 'film', 'not', 'doing', 'enough', 'turn', 'am', 'critizing', 'Maybe', 'X-Men', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'inconsistency', 'poor', 'balancing', 'act', 'done', 'social', 'satire', 'breakneck', 'action', 'so', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'uncertain', 'direction', 'want', 'take', 'movie', 'oversimplify', 'things', 'allow', 'picture', 'switch', 'gears', 'random', 'story', 'tailspin.But', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'Unfarmilar', 'D.C.', 'comic', 'not', 'being', 'particular', 'fan', 'comics', 'turned', 'films', 'general', 'must', 'admit', 'bias', 'movie', 'going', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'best', 'suited', 'judge', 'film', 'genre', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'upcoming', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'potential', 'saw', 'picture', 'first', 'few', 'minutes']",X-Men VHS

Love comics, hate X-Men.  It's not a comic book, it's a lifestyle, a monstrously twisted and convoluted backstory that REALLY needs to be cleaned away (DC Comics has the right idea, doing some huge event that purges various problems and contradictions.)  As such, boiling it down, let alone rendering it watchable, would have been hard work.  Yet this is a perfectly accessible movie; you don't have to know ANY backstory to enjoy it.Bryan Singer at the helm definitely helps, but the cast is also mostly sharp.  I wish Halle Berry hadn't done so many Quaaludes before every scene, but she's the only bad apple in the bunch.  The film shows a definite vision and cohesiveness a lot of action movies lack, period, let alone an atrocity like &quot;Batman and Robin.&quot;  The script is compact, well-written.

521425,A3P049IKQGPDZB,B00003CX8I,DarkRaven,"[1, 1]","Wow. This is the BEST movie ever. It felt like they weren't mutans, but special people with great powers. My favorite character was Storm (I want those powers!). If you like the ""cartoon"" X-MEN, then you'll like this movie. I think it's so great that you'll watch it more than one time (I can't even count how many times I watched it). This movie was done very well and the special effects were really great. I don't know what else to say, but here are some things about stories of the characters.Storm: is my favorite and she has the power to controll the weather and that is how she can levitate (by using the wind). In this movie she is played by Halle Berry. In the movie she was a teacher at the Xavier School for the Gifted (I think that was the name). She is just great. in the movie she uses her powers and that was why I re-watched it for countless times. The Beast really seems to hate her (you know the Beast that fights with Walverine and trys to brake Storm's neck). Storm is the best!Cyclops: has the power to beam something out of his eyes and in the movie you don't even get to see his eyes. He has a problem with Walverine because Walverine likes his girlfriend (Jean). That's about all about his, and he was also one of the first students at the Xavier's school (including Jean and Storm).Jean: has the power to move things with her mind and can also read minds. She is Cyclop's girlfriend and one of the first students at Xavier's school. She came close to danger of dieing when she tried to use Xavier's machine for finding new mutants. She is the one that Wolverine likes.Wolverine: has the power to heal quickly and also has sharp metal coming out of his hands (not his mutant power but a result os an expiriment on mutants. He likes Jean and says some ""bad"" and funny things to Cyclops. He has a painful past that Jean sees when she trys to read his mind.Rogue: has the power to steal powers and life essences of others. She is very close to Wolvarine (a father-daughter relationship). She is very powerful and Magneto trys to use her for his evil plan, that could indeed destroy lives. She is around 16 and 17 years old.Xavier: he is not important but he has some helpful powers and he helps the other characters in this movie. He also has some problems with Magneto.The Evil Mutants: Magneto is the leader and with him, there are four of them. Some of them also have interesting powers (especially Mystic).Buy it, enjoy it, watch it countless times.

I thought maybe Sam Raimi or Alex Proyas, someone who was a bit more VISUAL a director. Don't get me wrong here, Singer's debut film 'The Usual Suspects' still ranks as one of my favorite films of all time, but it so much different then adapting one of the most beloved and revered comic books of all time. But in the end Singer turned out to be the perfect choice. Why? His attention to characters. The X-Men, from it's earliest days, has always been a comic driven and defined by it's attention to character development, not just explosions and chaos. What Singer does here is miraculous. He takes a group of unbelievable characters and turns them into easily identifiable people, people who you might actually believe existed. The talented group of players lucky enough to play the roles in the film are uniformly fine. Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor Xavier, Famke Janssen is touching and alluring as Jean Grey, and Hugh Jackman (in a superb out-of-nowhere performance) brings humanity and lonliness to the imposing visage of Wolverine. The film also marks a bold departure from other films of it's kind in one more crucial area: special effects. Too many times the effects ARE the film, they are what holds our interest and define our excitement. While X-Men is by no means short on effects, the effects ENHANCE the characters instead of BEING the characters. These are people with gifts, we focus on them and not their abilities. The story is common-place comic book drivel, the good guys are out to stop the bad guys, blah blah blah... but it all hold together because of the intelligent and sometimes touching script. It's actually thought-provoking at times, a fact that makes me wonder why every other comic adaptation can not muster a single brain cell half the time. It is a fabulous achievement, a film that should not have succeeded but does because of a great script, wonderful performances, and assured direction from a man who is clearly out of his game. The DVD edition of X-Men is unique in one way as well: it's deleted scene can be viewed separately or pieced back into the film via a special 'branching' version of the film. It is clever and important. Many times I have watched the deleted scenes included in DVDs and been completely unable to get any impact from them whatsoever because they were being viewed out of context. This 'branching' feature marks a new standard and precedent that i hope many other DVDs will live up to. The picture quality is crisp and the sound is vibrant. No commentary track however (bummer) but it also house a few easter-eggs that a few people will stumble upon. A great package for a great film.",4,Stunning.

The movie is heavily changed from the comic history, and for an X-men buff like me, that can be a little dissapointing. Also, some of the acting wasen't all that good.

It dissects a human drama between the difference of a mutant and ordinary, of race and segregation, and it makes the audience feel for the idiosynacractic ways that the mutants handle their grief of being ostracized.

Smooth acting from Patrick Stewart hold this movie together and is compimented by a nice performance from Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Anna Paquin (Rouge).  I found the other actors a little too cheesey for my liking, but thats probably a true reflection of their comic book characters.  The movie has cool, but not overly ground-breaking special effects.  The plot is pretty basic, but that's comic books for you. The movie runs along at a nice pace and is pretty much action packed from beginning to end.  The DVD has some nice extra features.

521442,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00003CX8I,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[10, 19]","The first in a possibly long ""X-Men"" movie franchise is a great but flawed movie and it is one of the one of my favorite movies of 2000.It starts with a young teenage boy by the name of Eric Lensherr who struggles against the Nazi during WWII and his powers manifest for the first time in his life when he manages to warp and damage a gate to a concentration camp before being knocked unconscious. It is not seen however but Lensherr escapes however and would eventually meet Charles Xavier. Their friendship would eventually continue sort of in a way but at the same time, it would turn into a bitter rivalry as prejudice against mutants worsens and worsens and Xavier seeks to mend the rift between normal humans and mutants while Lensherr on the other hand, believing that humans will never accept mutants into their society, seeks to wage an all-out war against them and rid the world of them. In this flick, Magneto has plotted a special machine that irradiates a force field that mutates normal human cells and the normal human body rejects the mutations and dissolves into water while mutants are completely unscathed. Also, Wolverine escapes a military testing compound with little or no memory of his time there.The cast of the film is hit and miss, not by the actors themselves but simply how some of them act out their character roles.The best ones for their characters are Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, and Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto.  Hugh Jackman has the right kind of expressions that would remind one of Wolverine from the 1992-1996 cartoon series. Patrick Stewert does a wonderful job playing Xavier, I would even go far as to say that Stewert IS Charles Xavier. Sir Ian McKellan cannot be outdone playing the master of magnetism Magneto and has the right kind of sinister voice that would definitely scare young kids. All three of these actors give solid performances and they alone steal the show with their skillful performances in this movie. Rebecca Romijn Stamos' does a good job in her role as Mystique which will be forever remembered with the 'costume' merely being blue body paint and the bizarre stick-on scales to make Mystiques course skin and it's probably Stamos' most famous role in her entire career. Interesting camera angles I must admit.Others though don't fare as well. While none of them are near horrible or fatally catastrophic, some characters should've been giving much larger roles and could've been much better both appearance wise and personality wise. Rogue, Storm, and Cyclops are among the best characters off all time but in the film, they are reduced to two-dimensional characters with Rogue and Storm being the particular ones as the comic books show them as beautiful, intelligent, and elegant, but on the film they hardly show any of the elegance nor intelligence that they have been in the comics for almost 40 years! Anna Paquin doesn't do a bad job playing Rogue but her character hardly shows Rogue's emotional trauma that the comics have showed time and time again and simply looks more like a helpless victim. Sabertooth while awesome looks more like the bearded lead singer in the rock band Metallica (No offense to the band). Jean Grey looks more romantically involved with Wolverine than with Cyclops. What's with that? Cyclops is almost as uninteresting as your average stranger and hardly shows the romantic relationship with Jean Grey.  All of these characters in my opinion are in dire need of improvement on their part especially Storm and Rogue. However, all of these flaws in the characters I mentioned are forgivable in my opinion, considering how difficult it was to adapt a HUGE and rich comic book series to the big screen and it could've turned out disastrous, but instead they pulled it off quite well. There's lots of room for improvement though and hopefully the cast will do an even better job on X-Men 2.Although I'm not complaining about it, some characters don't even show up in the film at all. Gambit doesn't join the X-Men until much later, Henry McCoy aka Beast doesn't either, nor does Jubilee. That's OK though. Gradually the X-Men movies shall improve upon the previous as time goes on and hopefully it'll have a long theatre life as opposed to the Batman movie series that probably wound up being killed by the box-office bust, ""Batman & Robin"".Although I love this movie a lot, even I cannot deny that there were plenty of flaws to the film. Despite all of these things, this movie is a great one to own and has a strong message of the effects of bigotry, prejudice and racism and it's destructive effects on society as a whole. The fight scenes in some of them are awesome especially Wolverine battling Sabertooth atop The Statue Of Liberty and the incident at the train station. Overall, while this movie could've been better. This is just my perspective but I think that this first X-Men movie is more of a warm-up to the possible action-packed sequel X-Men or the ones after it. I just hope that this will become like a long lasting movie series that'll go for years and years. I think that they did a good job at adapting the X-Men to the big screen and is a good first start.

521443,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CX8I,D. Litton,"[9, 12]","Longtime fans of the Marvel comic series will find Twentieth Century Fox's adaptation of &quot;X-Men&quot; to be quite enjoyable and authentic. I was quite enlightened to see how well it mirrors the characters from the age old comic, as well as the glorious array of special effects, set designs and acting talents that all make the movie more intense and surprising.In a world where differences are frowned upon, evolution begins its course in the creation of mutants, who possess certain physical and emotional powers beyond that of regular humans. Heading a school for the specially gifted citizens is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who himself possesses the power to read peoples' minds. Among his many students are Cyclops (James Marsden), whose eye beams can cause massive destruction, Storm (Halle Berry), who calls upon the natural forces of weather, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who can look into people's minds and uses telekinesis, and newcomers Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose powerful fighting ability is due in part to his razorbalde knuckles, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can steal the power of another mutant simply by her touch. Xavier soon learns that his nemesis, Magneto (Ian McKellan), is planning on using a special machine to convert human beings into mutants, and that he needs Rogue in order to make the machine work to its fullest. This sets in motion the intense action that held childrens' imaginations for so many years as the group of mutants band together to stop the enemy from overpowering the world.Being a long ago fan of the comic and all the little perks that went with it, I can say that the film is a faithful and magnificent adaptation. Each of the mutant's powers is recreated with terrific authenticity, and it is very exciting to see it for the first time on the big screen in the age of blockbuster special effects.

521444,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00003CX8I,D. Mok,"[6, 7]","The X-Men comics were one of the richest mines for a movie franchise among all comic books.  A complex central issue dealing with alienation, bodily image, race, prejudice, plus a cast of troubled but iconic characters -- what more could a movie want?Well, for one thing, a script.  An appropriate cast.  Performances.  X-Men the movie had high aspirations, but so many of its pieces were just flat-out wrong.Granted, I had scoffed at the new image the movie had crafted for these characters, especially Cyclops' oversized goggles.  But the costumes turned out to work better than I thought in this movie.  No, the problems with X-Men are casting and script.  It's no wonder that the one actor who rises beautifully to the challenge is (then) newcomer Hugh Jackman.  Though a little young for the character of Wolverine, his great physique and feral presence suited the movie terrifically.  But the script offers him nary a chance to really craft something immortal, like Michael Keaton in Batman.  Simply put, the script is Thin with a capital T.  The central plot gets lost midway through the movie amidst all the exposition about Professor X's school.  This was necessary, but it was placed in the wrong part of the movie and resulted in the main plot grinding to a halt.  After the brilliant juggling trick he did with the kaleidoscopic plot of The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer disappoints in this movie, not quite able to make the mishmash screenplay work.  The characters of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Professor X, Storm and Rogue all became completely one-dimensional facades, which worked contrary to the movie's message that there's more to mutants than meets the eye.  Wolverine's memory loss is given no payoff.  Senator Kelly's melting trick (as Magneto says, &quot;Are you sure you saw what you saw?&quot;) is not explained, as if the screenwriter simply forgot to wrap up that strand of plot.And then there's the actors.  With the sole exception of Jackman, everybody looks tremendously uncomfortable.  The wonderful Ian McKellan is given little to chew on, plus a ridiculous-looking helmet and costume to match.  James Marsden as Cyclops looks like one of the Coneheads.  Famke Janssen is about ten years too old to be playing Jean Grey, failing along the way to project any of the charisma of the character, making us question why in hell Wolverine is so enamoured with her. (...because the comic books said so.)  Halle Berry is embarrassing as Storm, manifesting not a  shred of the elegance and intelligence of a wind goddess.  Anna Paquin as Rogue looks all right, but never probes into Rogue's psychological pains and instead comes off as a pure victim.  The villains fare better by virtue of being simpler:  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is lithe (though practically mute) as shapeshifter Mystique, and Ray Parks (Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode I) dazzles with a combination of acrobatic displays and mechanical effects as Toad.I think I would have questioned the suitability of the actors to their roles a lot less if the story had simply moved along better.  As it is, I get neither the satisfaction of watching a good comic-book adaptation nor a good sci-fi/action movie.",2,"Weak, despite the high concept.",1014595200,"02 25, 2002",2002,3181,"['X-Men', 'comics', 'were', 'one', 'richest', 'mines', 'movie', 'franchise', 'comic', 'books', 'complex', 'central', 'issue', 'dealing', 'alienation', 'bodily', 'image', 'race', 'prejudice', 'cast', 'troubled', 'iconic', 'characters', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'movie', 'want', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'script', 'appropriate', 'cast', 'Performances', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'had', 'high', 'aspirations', 'so', 'many', 'pieces', 'were', 'just', 'flat-out', 'wrong.Granted', 'had', 'scoffed', 'new', 'image', 'movie', 'had', 'crafted', 'characters', 'especially', 'Cyclops', 'oversized', 'goggles', 'costumes', 'turned', 'out', 'work', 'better', 'thought', 'movie', 'No', 'problems', 'X-Men', 'are', 'casting', 'script', 'wonder', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'beautifully', 'challenge', 'then', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'little', 'young', 'character', 'Wolverine', 'great', 'physique', 'feral', 'presence', 'suited', 'movie', 'terrifically', 'script', 'nary', 'chance', 'really', 'craft', 'something', 'immortal', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Batman', 'Simply', 'put', 'script', 'Thin', 'capital', 'T.', 'central', 'plot', 'lost', 'midway', 'movie', 'exposition', 'Professor', 'X', 'school', 'was', 'necessary', 'was', 'placed', 'wrong', 'part', 'movie', 'resulted', 'main', 'plot', 'grinding', 'halt', 'brilliant', 'juggling', 'trick', 'did', 'kaleidoscopic', 'plot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'disappoints', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'able', 'make', 'mishmash', 'screenplay', 'work', 'characters', 'Cyclops', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Professor', 'X', 'Storm', 'Rogue', 'became', 'completely', 'one-dimensional', 'facades', 'worked', 'contrary', 'movie', 'message', 'more', 'mutants', 'eye', 'Wolverine', 'memory', 'loss', 'given', 'payoff', 'Senator', 'Kelly', 'melting', 'trick', 'Magneto', 'quot', 'Are', 'sure', 'saw', 'what', 'saw', 'quot', 'not', 'explained', 'screenwriter', 'simply', 'forgot', 'wrap', 'up', 'strand', 'plot.And', 'then', 'actors', 'sole', 'exception', 'Jackman', 'everybody', 'tremendously', 'uncomfortable', 'wonderful', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'given', 'little', 'chew', 'ridiculous-looking', 'helmet', 'costume', 'match', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Cyclops', 'one', 'Coneheads', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'ten', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'failing', 'way', 'project', 'charisma', 'character', 'making', 'question', 'why', 'hell', 'Wolverine', 'so', 'enamoured', 'comic', 'books', 'said', 'so', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'embarrassing', 'Storm', 'manifesting', 'not', 'shred', 'elegance', 'intelligence', 'wind', 'goddess', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'right', 'never', 'probes', 'Rogue', 'psychological', 'pains', 'instead', 'off', 'pure', 'victim', 'villains', 'fare', 'better', 'virtue', 'being', 'simpler', 'Rebecca', 'Romjin-Stamos', 'lithe', 'practically', 'mute', 'shapeshifter', 'Mystique', 'Ray', 'Parks', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'combination', 'acrobatic', 'displays', 'mechanical', 'effects', 'Toad.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'questioned', 'suitability', 'actors', 'roles', 'lot', 'less', 'story', 'had', 'simply', 'moved', 'along', 'better', 'get', 'neither', 'satisfaction', 'watching', 'good', 'comic-book', 'adaptation', 'good', 'sci-fi/action', 'movie']",X-Men VHS

Although Hollywood has often turned to comics lately, they're rarely done one this well. Once you've accepted the basic premise that humanity has suddenly and spontaneously mutated to the extent that any of a host of &quot;superpowers&quot; are rampant in the population, then you are off for a romp. If you can't buy this, then stay away! The casting is superb--apparently Hugh Jackman was a late substitution, but he is so good it is hard to imagine anyone else in the part. Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen as Magneto are also perfect for their roles, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos will be in the dreams of every teenaged boy who sees this film for years to come. I have to admit that I found the character and portrayal of Toad by Ray Park so totally over-the-top (yes, he has a long sticky tongue and hops around...sheesh!!) that it was absurd--it really detracted from the overall effect. But for the most part, Marvel Comic characters and stories have always had more depth than their DC counterparts, and the movie takes full advantage of this. Even the bad guys are motivated not primarily from a desire to do evil, but from self-preservation. Special effects in this film were fantastic, the plot was reasonably complex and interesting, characters had some depth--the criticism that there were simply too many characters is valid, but after all the film wasn't X- *MAN*....and of course, we are set up for a sequel. If they keep this quality, I'd be happy to see it--I thought this was the best comic treatment I've seen since the original Batman with Michael Keaton.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","With the second X-Men movie rolling out this summer, I decided that it would be a good time to get off my backside and watch the first. What I found was a very enjoyable action movie, with more brains than one usually finds in that genre, with a good cast and excellent direction. If the sequel is this good, then it will definitely be worth watching.In recent years, an increasing number of people have been discovered to be mutants, whose DNA has taken a leap forward and given them superhuman powers. Now their freedom is threatened. Rogue, a girl whose touch can kill (Anna Paquin) and Logan/Wolverine, (Hugh Jackman) a man with steel claws and amazing regenerative abilities are attacked in Canada, only to be rescued by mutants and taken to a top-secret ""school for the gifted"" in New York. It's run by the mind-reading/controlling mutant Carles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), to teach and protect his fellow mutants, known as X-Men.But there are others without such benevolent plans. Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor who can generate powerful magnetic fields, anticipates a coming war between mutants and ordinary humans. With the help of the reptilian shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), savage Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), and nasty Toad (Ray Park), he abducts and artificially mutates a U.S. senator, then threatens the entire population of New York with a bizarre weapon. And only the X-Men can hope to stop him.Yes, it sounds cheesy, but it's done well. In fact, most of the movie goes under the listing of sounds-stupid-but-is-done-well. The superpower-enhanced action sequences are well done, and the mutants are given human edges and attachments that keep them from just being pretty faces with superpowers. They may not be homo sapiens any longer, but in personality they are quite human. The special effects are surprisingly muted, and usually kept in tune with the storyline. Though this is an action movie, it bothers to have a complicated plotline including politics, history, and a bit of commentary on intolerance and mindless prejudice as well.Patrick Stewart does a good job as a benevolent father-figure to all the mutants (they're even referred to as his ""children"" in one scene). Ian McKellen is flawless as Magneto; this is not some random wanna-conquer-the-world villain, but someone who is embittered and determined to the point of potential genocide. (An interesting parallel is that he is a survivor of the Holocaust, yet he seeks to establish a ""master race"" of mutants) Hugh Jackman does a good job with Wolverine's tough-guy image that covers his confusion and loneliness, since he doesn't know who he is or who put metal all over his bones. Anna Paquin annoyed me as Rogue, because she seems to cry a lot. Famke Janssen (as telekinetic Jean Grey), Halle Berry (as weather-controlling Storm), and James Marsden (as laser-eyed Cyclops) are all good supporting roles, although Berry's role is somewhat thinner than her costars'.This movie is also a bit darker than films like Spiderman, more adult and more disturbing (especially with the themes about prejudice and discrimination). This movie isn't quite flawless, unfortunately. Some of the costumes are a bit overdone, especially Storm's -- is there any logical reason for her to wear that silver catsuit and cape? Most of the characters are fine, like Cyclops and Wolverine, but occasionally the costumes get a little silly. Additionally, many of the scientific aspects of the movie are never explained at all, such as Kelly's transformation into the human jellyfish. How exactly does Magneto do this? I'm a little fuzzy on how that radiation is generated and how it affects ordinary humans.Despite these flaws, ""X-Men"" is a good solid action/SF movie, especially since it so easily could have been a total disaster.

This movie is what a lot of us had been waiting for years, a movie based on a Marvel series that wasn't terrible (IE: remember Dolph Lundgren in that awful PUNISHER movie? And let's not forget any of the made for TV Marvel movies that also did no justice to the great Marvel name).Now for any of you older X-MEN fans that have some of the original comics, X-MEN the movie does stray away from the original series because in the original series, the first X-Men were Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Angel and Ice Man (when they made Ice Man like a snow man). This one went with the most notable X-Men, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm and Rogue. That and another thing that might bother older fans is how Rogue is introduced as a 16 year old girl when in the original series, she is introduced as an enemy to the X-Men after stealing the powers of Ms. Marvel.One last thing that absolutely bothered me was that Sabretooth wasn't the 8' tall, buff as hell, ominous monster that he is in the comics. Personally, he looked like a regular guy who snarled and had bad nails. Don't get me wrong, X-MEN the movie is otherwise nearly flawless and very entertaining and very cool. I'd suggest this movie to anyone, whether Sci Fi fans, X-Men fans or Action movie fans.

Unfortunately, it didn't exceed those rather modest expectations - this despite the fact that the X-Men seemed to me one of the few super-hero comics that could be effectively adapted into an SF film and gain an appeal outside of fans of the original comic book. But the director and writers seemed unsure about how to approach the movie: either make it a genre film for ""X-Men insiders"" or an SF thriller with broad appeal. The result is a little of neither. Even so, the acting is generally good in spite everything going against the movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are perfectly cast as Professor Xavier and Magneto, respectively, the two most intriguing characters in the whole X-Men story - personally I think the whole movie would have been much better if the story and action revolved exclusively around them. Here, however, they are generally sidelined (esp. Prof. Xavier, who spends a major part of the movie in a coma) as more emphasis is placed on fight sequences and special effects. Despite some very good, even moving scenes, like the first sequence showing Magneto's early childhood as a Holocaust survivor, the movie's plot is actually quite silly - believe me, comic books are written better than this. There is little in the way of interesting character development, since the story is based on a serial publication with dozens of characters and none of them are given a chance to really stand out. Perhaps that's the main problem: the X-Men would function much better as a television series than as a feature-length film.",2,Mostly disappointing,985910400,"03 30, 2001",2001,1702,"['When', 'used', 'read', 'comics', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'X-Men', 'were', 'favorite', 'so', 'watched', 'movie', 'more', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'anything', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'exceed', 'rather', 'modest', 'expectations', 'fact', 'X-Men', 'seemed', 'one', 'few', 'super-hero', 'comics', 'could', 'be', 'effectively', 'adapted', 'SF', 'film', 'gain', 'appeal', 'outside', 'fans', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'director', 'writers', 'seemed', 'unsure', 'how', 'approach', 'movie', 'make', 'genre', 'film', 'X-Men', 'insiders', 'SF', 'thriller', 'broad', 'appeal', 'result', 'little', 'Even', 'so', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'spite', 'everything', 'going', 'movie', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'respectively', 'two', 'most', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'whole', 'X-Men', 'story', 'personally', 'think', 'whole', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'action', 'revolved', 'exclusively', 'Here', 'however', 'are', 'generally', 'sidelined', 'esp', 'Prof.', 'Xavier', 'who', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'coma', 'more', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'fight', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'moving', 'scenes', 'first', 'sequence', 'showing', 'Magneto', 'early', 'childhood', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'movie', 'plot', 'actually', 'quite', 'silly', 'believe', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'written', 'better', 'little', 'way', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'based', 'serial', 'publication', 'dozens', 'characters', 'none', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'main', 'problem', 'X-Men', 'would', 'function', 'much', 'better', 'television', 'series', 'feature-length', 'film']",X-Men VHS

Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X.  Getting a actor of Ian McKellen's status for Magneto was a real coup.  Hugh Jackman gives the best performance in the highly desired role of Wolverine.  Who knew then that Halle Berry would become the second Oscar-winning actress in the cast (along with Anna Paquin)?  And who also knew then that Rebecca Romjin-Stammos would become arguably modeldom's hottest pin-up?All these people were cast by others that knew the characters inside and out, and wanted the best product possible.

I admit that this movie was more of an introductory movie.  That excites me too... I can't wait to see the coming films.  I'm thrilled by this movie because it focused on some of those characters who did not get as much attention, like Rogue (played by the wonderful Anna Paquin) and Wolverine (played by the relatively new face Hugh Jackman).  The overplayed Cyclops, Jean Gray and Professor X are mostly in the background, and might get more play in the next movie.

Still, like everyone else, I want to have my say about the movie, even before seeing the DVD.I'm not a fan of the comics, in the sense of knowing them well and buying them. I might have bought a couple, and watched a few episodes of the animated series. What I saw I liked, but it was some time ago, and when I came to see this movie, I was missing a lot of stuff, even basic stuff, like what Rogue's power is. But I knew enough to know who most of the characters were.The movie, IMO, was meant mainly as an exposition to next ones. It looked like this, although this feeling wasn't as strong as I got when I saw Spawn. There was still enough of a story and conclusion here.I liked it that it's not a special effect movie. Yes, there are great special effects, but they are so well integrated, that they just look natural. The only time I felt an effect was a little forced was when Jean Gray shows her telekinesis power when she's working on wolverine. But generally the effects were so well done, that they did their job of fleshing an impossible world without drawing attention to themselves, and there was enough story to keep you engaged and not thinking of them (unlike, for example, Star Wars Episode 1).What I really liked about this movie is that it's deep and interesting enough. It goes way beyond just action, or even character interaction (which is also done pretty well). The initial scene, with Magneto's parents being taken to be cremated by the Nazis was pretty strong, IMO (a friend I saw the movie with thought it was a bit too much to put a reference to the holocaust in a blockbuster movie, but I disagree). It puts in an interesting light the attempts to have mutations &quot;licensed&quot;, and allows some understanding of Magneto.The idea of the character of Rogue is great. A girl who can't touch anyone - that's true agony. And then there's Wolverine with his lost memories. This really has the making of a great story, which is why, as the title says, it makes me interested in reading more about these characters.The film also does well in capturing the sexy spirit of many current comics. Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are certainly very attractive women, as is Rebecca Romjin-Stamos. I guess that the men are not bad looking, either, but I'm not the best judge of that. I did feel that both Magneto and Storm were a little, well, smaller than I imagined them from my previous encounters with the X-Men series. But that wasn't a real problem for me.That about sums it up. The main reason I don't give this movie 5 stars is because it was an introductory movie. If the second movie manages to keep to the standards set by this one, then it should be great.",4,Makes me want to read the comics,972518400,"10 26, 2000",2000,2802,"['First', 'must', 'say', 'kind', 'funny', 'how', 'many', 'quot', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'quot', 'are', 'even', 'came', 'out', 'Still', 'everyone', 'else', 'want', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'even', 'seeing', 'DVD.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'comics', 'sense', 'knowing', 'well', 'buying', 'might', 'have', 'bought', 'couple', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'animated', 'series', 'What', 'saw', 'liked', 'was', 'time', 'ago', 'when', 'came', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'missing', 'lot', 'stuff', 'even', 'basic', 'stuff', 'what', 'Rogue', 'power', 'knew', 'enough', 'know', 'who', 'most', 'characters', 'were.The', 'movie', 'IMO', 'was', 'meant', 'mainly', 'exposition', 'next', 'ones', 'looked', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'got', 'when', 'saw', 'Spawn', 'was', 'still', 'enough', 'story', 'conclusion', 'here.I', 'liked', 'not', 'special', 'effect', 'movie', 'Yes', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'integrated', 'just', 'look', 'natural', 'only', 'time', 'felt', 'effect', 'was', 'little', 'forced', 'was', 'when', 'Jean', 'Gray', 'telekinesis', 'power', 'when', 'working', 'wolverine', 'generally', 'effects', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'did', 'job', 'fleshing', 'impossible', 'world', 'drawing', 'attention', 'was', 'enough', 'story', 'keep', 'engaged', 'not', 'thinking', 'example', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', '1', '.What', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'deep', 'interesting', 'enough', 'way', 'just', 'action', 'even', 'character', 'interaction', 'also', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'initial', 'scene', 'Magneto', 'parents', 'being', 'taken', 'be', 'cremated', 'Nazis', 'was', 'pretty', 'strong', 'IMO', 'friend', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'put', 'reference', 'holocaust', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'disagree', 'interesting', 'light', 'attempts', 'have', 'mutations', 'quot', 'licensed', 'quot', 'understanding', 'Magneto.The', 'idea', 'character', 'Rogue', 'great', 'A', 'girl', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'anyone', 'true', 'agony', 'then', 'Wolverine', 'lost', 'memories', 'really', 'making', 'great', 'story', 'why', 'title', 'interested', 'reading', 'more', 'characters.The', 'film', 'also', 'well', 'capturing', 'sexy', 'spirit', 'many', 'current', 'comics', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'are', 'certainly', 'very', 'attractive', 'women', 'Rebecca', 'Romjin-Stamos', 'guess', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'looking', 'either', ""'m"", 'not', 'best', 'judge', 'did', 'feel', 'Magneto', 'Storm', 'were', 'little', 'well', 'smaller', 'imagined', 'previous', 'encounters', 'X-Men', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'problem', 'me.That', 'sums', 'up', 'main', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'introductory', 'movie', 'second', 'movie', 'manages', 'keep', 'standards', 'set', 'one', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'great']",X-Men VHS

521472,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CX8I,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 3]","Though highly imaginative with astounding visual effects, ""X-Men"" explodes onto celluloid much the same way as most of the other comic book films, with a weak and predictable plot and characters as two dimensional as their paper counterparts.  This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it is.  It is very high on filmmaking ""coolness"" and the action is intense and impressive.  However, it suffers from excessive form and very little substance.The science in this so-called science fiction story is laughable.  If we are to accept the premise presented here, suddenly, over a period of about 50 years, man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants.  There is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations; it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution.  Well, evolution doesn't work that way, not even close.  Major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species.  So the concept is really more fantasy than science fiction.""Lighten up"", you say.  ""Who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway?  It is just an awesome movie!""  That's a good point.  However, even fantasy films need a plot.  ""X-Men"" trots out the same tired storyline; good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on.  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the story.The film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants.  However, the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not vice-versa as depicted here.  Feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them.  They have the power.  How much sympathy can we have for them?At the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned e-mail, I have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was.  This film was all sizzle and no steak.  There was only one character with a shred of substance and that was Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  The rest were just cardboard cutouts.In 1995, at the age of 29, wunderkind director Bryan Singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called ""The Usual Suspects"".  He then burst into flames with ""Apt Pupil"", a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly Nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the U.S.  After that disaster, he went underground until ""X-Men"".  This film showed that Singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick, but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of ""Suspects"".  That film showed that he has a certain directorial genius, but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative, but shallow projects like this.The acting; well, there wasn't much acting to be done.  Anna Pacquin and Hugh Jackman had the only parts that weren't utterly superficial.  Both of them did a good job, actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor, and she said all six of her lines like a true professional.I'm being overly hard on the film.  It wasn't bad.  It was very enjoyable.  It just didn't deserve the raves that were doted on it.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences.  These areas were an easy 10/10.  The screenplay was about a 3/10.

However, this movie is a wonerful example of modern B-Rate movies.  Not that being a B-Rate movie is bad.  It's just that if you can figure out the entire plot within 45 minutes of movie i'm dissapointed.  The acting isn't exactly inspired, it follows the comic about as well as your grandmother does, and the great comedic moments are chuckle-worthy at best.However, it has the three major components of a B-Rate flick.  Great action scenes, a script made up by a group of 12-year olds, and good-looking women running around.

The human race is feeling threatened (perhaps by not having a cold war with a ready-made enemy to vilify) by a new phenomenon - mutant people who possess strange abilities. Are they defects and deformed people? Are they the next step in evolution? Whatever they are (hence the X term), they are a worry to many, particular the senator calling for their registration (a recurrent theme in American sociology - let's register those different from us; let's register known communists, let's register all gun owners, let's register all sex offenders, let's register, hmmm, what's left?).Some of the X people (sorry, the title is gender-inaccurate: not all of the X-men are men) see this as the first step to their imprisonment and irradication, particularly the one named Magneto, who watched his family being herded toward death chambers in Nazi Germany (where they also had a penchant for registration). Magneto decides that this is the final straw, and vows to 'change the minds' of the leaders of the world.On the side of the angels is Xavier, Professor Charles Xavier, powerful telepath, who is both a champion of mutant rights but also a believer in the fundamental goodness of humanity. Thus, we have the classic battle - good and evil. The battle lines are drawn. The forces line up.Behind Magneto, who can control metal objects, either believing in his vision of a corrupt humanity who will do them no good, or simply after the power their powers could afford them, are Toad, a mutant spits toxic goop with his rubbery tongue, Mystique, a basic shape-shifter, and Sabretooth, the 'muscle' every villain.In league with Xavier at his school are Cyclops, a man whose eyes fire laser beams, Storm, who can control the weather, and Jean Grey, who possesses minor telepathic powers and telekinetic abilities.Into the midst of this gathering battle fall Wolverine, a man with heightened senses, quick healing and special implants of metal, and Rogue, a frightened teenaged girl whose touch robs the one she's touching of his or her life force.--The Story--Good versus evil. Who's side are you on? Wolverine and Rogue are nearly abducted by Magneto's forces, saved by Xavier's forces, then (of course) caught once again. There are some clever moments and diversions (what is really going on?), but mostly as a movie inspired by a comic book would be, the plot is predictable. Magneto is out to convince the world leaders that they are wrong to despise and fear the mutants by turning them into mutants. Each of the mutants has a reason to opt for one side or the other in this battle. Each of the X-people have a past, and we get only teasing glimpses of some of them. The good guys win, of course, but it isn't a definitive victory. Of course, you wouldn't expect it to be. This is supposed to be a blockbuster that will spawn sequels for years to come...Overall, this was a fun movie with a good action, a good story, and good effects. I must confess to never having seen the comic books before and being completely ignorant about the characters or plots, so there were no expectations to be dashed. Stewart and McKellen are two of my favourite actors, and they did not disappoint in their roles.My one wish would have been for more background and details - I know they were hoping to leave something for the sequels, but coming in at just over 90 minutes, they surely could have let those of us without a comic book interest in on a little more of the mystery.",4,X marks the spot,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,3503,"['Setting', 'not-to-distant', 'present', 'human', 'race', 'feeling', 'threatened', 'perhaps', 'not', 'having', 'cold', 'war', 'ready-made', 'enemy', 'vilify', 'new', 'phenomenon', 'mutant', 'people', 'who', 'possess', 'strange', 'abilities', 'Are', 'defects', 'deformed', 'people', 'Are', 'next', 'step', 'evolution', 'are', 'hence', 'X', 'term', 'are', 'worry', 'many', 'particular', 'senator', 'calling', 'registration', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'American', 'sociology', 'let', 'register', 'different', 'let', 'register', 'known', 'communists', 'let', 'register', 'gun', 'owners', 'let', 'register', 'sex', 'offenders', 'let', 'register', 'hmmm', 'what', 'left', '.Some', 'X', 'people', 'sorry', 'title', 'gender-inaccurate', 'not', 'X-men', 'are', 'men', 'see', 'first', 'step', 'imprisonment', 'irradication', 'particularly', 'one', 'named', 'Magneto', 'who', 'watched', 'family', 'being', 'herded', 'death', 'chambers', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'where', 'also', 'had', 'penchant', 'registration', 'Magneto', 'final', 'straw', 'vows', ""'change"", 'minds', 'leaders', 'world.On', 'side', 'angels', 'Xavier', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'powerful', 'telepath', 'who', 'champion', 'mutant', 'rights', 'also', 'believer', 'fundamental', 'goodness', 'humanity', 'Thus', 'have', 'classic', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'battle', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'forces', 'line', 'Magneto', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'metal', 'objects', 'either', 'believing', 'vision', 'corrupt', 'humanity', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'good', 'simply', 'power', 'powers', 'could', 'afford', 'are', 'Toad', 'mutant', 'spits', 'toxic', 'goop', 'rubbery', 'tongue', 'Mystique', 'basic', 'shape-shifter', 'Sabretooth', ""'muscle"", 'villain.In', 'league', 'Xavier', 'school', 'are', 'Cyclops', 'man', 'eyes', 'fire', 'laser', 'beams', 'Storm', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'weather', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'who', 'minor', 'telepathic', 'powers', 'telekinetic', 'midst', 'gathering', 'battle', 'fall', 'Wolverine', 'man', 'heightened', 'senses', 'quick', 'healing', 'special', 'implants', 'metal', 'Rogue', 'frightened', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'touch', 'one', 'touching', 'life', 'force.', 'Story', 'Good', 'versus', 'evil', 'Who', 'side', 'are', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'are', 'nearly', 'abducted', 'Magneto', 'forces', 'saved', 'Xavier', 'forces', 'then', 'course', 'caught', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'clever', 'moments', 'diversions', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'mostly', 'movie', 'inspired', 'comic', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'predictable', 'Magneto', 'out', 'convince', 'world', 'leaders', 'are', 'wrong', 'despise', 'fear', 'mutants', 'turning', 'mutants', 'mutants', 'reason', 'opt', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'battle', 'X-people', 'have', 'past', 'get', 'only', 'teasing', 'glimpses', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'course', ""n't"", 'definitive', 'victory', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'supposed', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'will', 'spawn', 'sequels', 'years', 'come', 'Overall', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'effects', 'must', 'confess', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'comic', 'books', 'being', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'characters', 'plots', 'were', 'expectations', 'be', 'dashed', 'Stewart', 'McKellen', 'are', 'two', 'favourite', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'roles.My', 'one', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'background', 'details', 'know', 'were', 'hoping', 'leave', 'something', 'sequels', 'coming', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'surely', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'comic', 'book', 'interest', 'little', 'more', 'mystery']",X-Men VHS

I have watched this movie many times and it still isn't boring, that is the best thing that can be said about movie. That it has a long life and can still be enjoyed years after it's release, and X-Men definitely fits that category. But, what is not to like about this movie?The casting for it is perfect, Ian McKellen makes a great Magneto and Patrick Stewart makes a perfect Professor Charles Xavier. The same things can be said for everyone in the movie and who they were cast as in the film. It is done so perfectly, it adds to the story and makes me wonder if this movie would have been as powerful as it is if other people were cast in this film. Let's not forget the special effects that are used in this movie. That is definitely eye candy for sure. The mutant powers look great when they are used in this movie and look realistic. It is really cool to see Wolverine's adamantium claws first slowly come out in the bar.The story doesn't follow the comics as well as I had hoped they would. The biggest example I could see in the film is that Wolverine and Sabertooth don't know each other prior to their meeting in this movie, but in the comic, they have known each other for years. Despite the lack of being 100% like the comic, this movie makes a story of it's own and the previous story isn't really needed. It is so compelling in the way it is told, it can be forgiven for its very small mistakes for sure. This is definitely a have to see movie.

Hugh Jackman steals the show in his movie debut, but what do you expect from a stage actor -- the man can act. You don't doubt him for a second. His story is very interesting too.The depiction of the X-Men school is great. So is the depiction of Magneto, Sabretooth, and did I mention Wolverine? He's the MAN.

Forget the critics' whine that character development and introduction eats up the first hour of the film.  X-MEN is exactly what comic book fans are looking for.  Director Bryan Singer has delivered a dark, mature tale based on one of the finest comic books ever produced.As comic book characters, the X-Men were deeper than many who had come before.  You knew Superman was good.  You knew Lex Luthor was bad.  Is Wolverine good?  Is Magneto truly bad?  The X-Men were constantly struggling with themselves as well as their adversaries (who often became allies).  That's why I felt the first hour of character development was essential to the film, especially for viewers unfamiliar with the characters.  And the plot?  Who cares?  Again, it's the characters that take precedence - they're more interesting than any story - and we all know this is basically a two-hour set up for a sequel.  And if the sequel is as good as this original, bring it on, one after another.For longtime fans, there's plenty to pick up on, such as other X-Men at Xavier's school, Kitty Pryde and Iceman to name two.  I, for one, was pleased that they even got the characters' proper names right, something they couldn't even do in the BATMAN series.  There are also clever &quot;inside jokes,&quot; such as Cyclops' reference to yellow spandex that keep the dialogue lively and the hardcore fans satisfied without descending into campiness, e.g., &quot;Holy Rusted Metal, Batman!&quot;This film is also nearly perfectly cast.  The relatively unknown Hugh Jackman had the greatest challenge and pulled it off perfectly.  My only complaint was the laughably miscast Anna Paquin as Rogue.  Too young and unable to deliver the accent, Rogue was nothing like her predecessor in print.  Rogue was the woman who was dangerous because she exuded sexuality and everyone wanted to touch her, not a child constantly wrapped in a silly cloak.  Everyone else is just fine.  I can think of more interesting villains than Toad, but we'll just expect to see them in the sequel.In summary, a great, well-directed film that's fun without being silly.  It's dark, but not overbearingly so.  A nice transfer to DVD with nice extras, but nothing essential.  The film itself stands on its own merits.  This is a film that could have gone terribly wrong (remember PUNISHER?  CAPTAIN AMERICA?), but, lucky for you and I, it didn't.",4,Best comic book adaptation yet,974937600,"11 23, 2000",2000,2409,"['Forget', 'Magneto', 'plan', 'Forget', 'critics', 'whine', 'character', 'development', 'introduction', 'up', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'X-MEN', 'exactly', 'what', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'are', 'looking', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'delivered', 'dark', 'mature', 'tale', 'based', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'books', 'ever', 'produced.As', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'X-Men', 'were', 'deeper', 'many', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'before', 'knew', 'Superman', 'was', 'good', 'knew', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'was', 'bad', 'Wolverine', 'good', 'Magneto', 'truly', 'bad', 'X-Men', 'were', 'constantly', 'struggling', 'as', 'well', 'adversaries', 'who', 'often', 'became', 'allies', 'why', 'felt', 'first', 'hour', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'essential', 'film', 'especially', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'characters', 'plot', 'Who', 'Again', 'characters', 'take', 'precedence', ""'re"", 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'know', 'basically', 'two-hour', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'sequel', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'bring', 'one', 'another.For', 'longtime', 'fans', 'plenty', 'pick', 'up', 'such', 'other', 'X-Men', 'Xavier', 'school', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'Iceman', 'name', 'two', 'one', 'was', 'pleased', 'even', 'got', 'characters', 'proper', 'names', 'right', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'BATMAN', 'series', 'are', 'also', 'clever', 'quot', 'inside', 'jokes', 'quot', 'such', 'Cyclops', 'reference', 'yellow', 'spandex', 'dialogue', 'lively', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'satisfied', 'descending', 'campiness', 'e.g.', 'quot', 'Holy', 'Rusted', 'Metal', 'Batman', 'quot', 'film', 'also', 'nearly', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'had', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'pulled', 'off', 'perfectly', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'laughably', 'miscast', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'Too', 'young', 'unable', 'deliver', 'accent', 'Rogue', 'was', 'nothing', 'predecessor', 'print', 'Rogue', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'dangerous', 'exuded', 'sexuality', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'touch', 'not', 'child', 'constantly', 'wrapped', 'silly', 'cloak', 'Everyone', 'else', 'just', 'fine', 'can', 'think', 'more', 'interesting', 'villains', 'Toad', ""'ll"", 'just', 'expect', 'see', 'sequel.In', 'summary', 'great', 'well-directed', 'film', 'fun', 'being', 'silly', 'dark', 'not', 'overbearingly', 'so', 'nice', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'nothing', 'essential', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'remember', 'PUNISHER', 'CAPTAIN', 'AMERICA', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't""]",X-Men VHS

The director expertly showcases the X-Universe, setting the mood and tone for the sequels to come.Although this is sci-fi material, in a way it`s depicted in a realistic, believable manner, as the characters and their envoironment seem credible and not too fantasy-like creations.

The plot focuses mainly on Wolverine and Rogue, so unfortunately the rest of the characters aren`t too developed, but given that this is the first movie of a series it works well enough.""X-Men"" is intelligent, creative sci-fi, a solid movie with good direction, competent special effect (used just when necessary, avoiding useless explosions and fights), an efficient plot and a talented cast.

And people who have no prior exposure to X-Men should give it a chance - my sisters didn't even want to see it and they liked it just as much as I did. There are some changes from the comic book and cartoon series that serious fans may object to, but I thought that in the end they worked out for the better. The casting was perfect, even though Halle Berry's performance was a bit off the mark. Character development is a bit of an issue for the lesser parts, but each character was interesting enough to keep your attention and make you look forward to seeing them again in the sequel (especially Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' surprisingly good turn as the wonderfully wicked, though a bit underused, Mystique).

But this movie is way different. The film takes time to develop its characters, especially Rogue, so you feel sympathy or agony for what they are going through, men or women. The plot of the movie is really quite simple but is given a lot of intelligence by the clever dialogue and good set-ups. The acting is fantastic - Ian McKellen is a good baddie despite his age, Hugh Jackman is hairy and fabulous, Patrick Stewart puts on a believable show as Professor Xavier, Famke Janssen is sophisticated and sexy, Halle Berry looks cool in a white wig and acts well as the powerful Storm, James Marsden is given heaps of opportunities to WOW! the audience, Anna Paquin is sweet and expresses Rogue's emotions brilliantly and the other evil X-Men do well too, including Ray Park (Darth Maul, anyone) in a tongue-twisting and scene-stealing role. Wow! Good casting, too, as you can see. Okay, back to the facts. The screenplay is neat and has heaps of depth, action, technology, adventure, science, chemistry and comedy. I enjoyed all the action sequences and the film is really hard to dislike, even for people who have never heard of or read the comic book. The story seems quite realistic too and you can even believe its happening, which is a big compliment for a fantasy flick. I loved the techno music on the soundtrack too, really good stuff for a party or something.

At first, I thought it was an ad for the newest Nightmare On Elm Street installment, until I noticed that it was Hugh Jackman in the upcoming movie ""The X-Men"".  My mind gave the famous line of Emily Litella:  ""Well, that makes it completely different.  Never mind.""  After all, I had read and loved the X-Men comics when I was younger, and knew enough to know that Jackman was playing the Wolverine.This movie was as good as I could imagine it, and even better.  It had the special effects and action you would expect in a comic book adaptation.  But the movie appealed to the mind as much as to the eyes and nerves.This movie (and actually, the whole series) deals with the issue of prejudice and how to deal with it.  In these movies, it is mutants that are the victims of this prejudice.  The story line says it is a spurt of evolution; there is nothing to scientifically verify this.  Nevertheless, the mutants are feared and persecuted.There are mutant protagonists, led by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and mutant antagonists, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen).  The difference between them is the response to the persecution.  The protagonists seek to live quietly and peaceably with humans, having Xavier's school as a place for protection and refuge.  The antagonists are ready to wage war with the persecutors.In this first installment, Magneto's goal is to transform humans into mutants, which he does to a Senator who wants to have mutants registered (not unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany, a comparison made in the first scene of the movie).  The problem is that humans are unable to withstand the change and end up dying.I avoid detailed plot descriptions in my reviews so I spoil as few surprises as possible.  I will say, though, that Magneto survives the first movie, not unlike Darth Vader surviving in the Star Wars movies.  One thing I like about the movie, though, is that Magneto is not the type of villain you want to see killed.  Magneto and Xavier are not true enemies, but adversaries who would admit the other is really a friend.  I am the type of person who would rather see a villain reformed than executed.This movie is PG-13.  The Senator's death, among other scenes, keep this from being a family movie.

The characters are simple and varied enough to make us like that universe of monstrous mutants that look just like us but can turn into whatever they want. Welcome to Carrie, Christine, Firestarter, the Tommyknockers and many other Stephen King paranormal beings and situations. Of course, this film adds to that berserk universe a good old American wrapping but with a twist. The statue of liberty standing on its nice little island as the symbol of what it is called after and yet looking like a stiletto stabbing the sky  and jutting out of a flat no man's seascape. The twist is in the fact that it is this very statue that is going to be the epicenter of the destruction of all the heads of states assembled at the United Nations for the general assembly of this world's forum. This American wrapping is the standard bigot position of a senator against mutants, against people who are different, who rejects them and kills them as fast as possible. And the twist is that this senator is kidnapped by the bad mutants, transmuted himself by them and then discarded to die in any odd place away from them. And before dying he is saved by the good mutants and he even comes to like them. Finally the main twist is that there are good mutants and in this film, temporarily, they win and save humanity from a cataclysm that would have destroyed both humanity and mutant-dom. Then the rest is not even sentimental episodes. It is pure action and mission and some fights, and a lot of visual special effects. That makes a nice entertaining film though on no matrix whatsoever except maybe the very very distant faraway relation to a certain Quasimodo in Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo: the ugly monster is the savior of the beautiful gypsy girl all the normal Parisians want to victimize and kill.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,There is some pleasure beyond the numerous models,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,1964,"['special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'simple', 'varied', 'enough', 'make', 'universe', 'monstrous', 'mutants', 'look', 'just', 'can', 'turn', 'want', 'Welcome', 'Carrie', 'Christine', 'Firestarter', 'Tommyknockers', 'many', 'other', 'Stephen', 'King', 'paranormal', 'beings', 'situations', 'course', 'film', 'berserk', 'good', 'old', 'American', 'wrapping', 'twist', 'statue', 'liberty', 'standing', 'nice', 'little', 'island', 'symbol', 'what', 'called', 'yet', 'looking', 'stiletto', 'stabbing', 'sky', 'jutting', 'flat', 'man', 'seascape', 'twist', 'fact', 'very', 'statue', 'going', 'be', 'epicenter', 'destruction', 'heads', 'states', 'assembled', 'United', 'Nations', 'general', 'assembly', 'world', 'forum', 'American', 'wrapping', 'standard', 'bigot', 'position', 'senator', 'mutants', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'who', 'kills', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'twist', 'senator', 'kidnapped', 'bad', 'mutants', 'transmuted', 'then', 'discarded', 'die', 'odd', 'place', 'away', 'dying', 'saved', 'good', 'mutants', 'even', 'like', 'Finally', 'main', 'twist', 'are', 'good', 'mutants', 'film', 'temporarily', 'win', 'save', 'humanity', 'cataclysm', 'would', 'have', 'destroyed', 'humanity', 'mutant-dom', 'Then', 'rest', 'not', 'even', 'sentimental', 'episodes', 'pure', 'action', 'mission', 'fights', 'lot', 'visual', 'special', 'effects', 'nice', 'entertaining', 'film', 'matrix', 'whatsoever', 'maybe', 'very', 'very', 'distant', 'faraway', 'relation', 'certain', 'Quasimodo', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Paris', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'ugly', 'monster', 'savior', 'beautiful', 'gypsy', 'girl', 'normal', 'Parisians', 'want', 'victimize', 'kill.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",X-Men VHS

I think, being the introduction to all the amazing characters like Rogue, Wolverine, Professor Xavier himself (whom I so loved as a child I named my only son Xavier after!), Magneto, Storm, and so many others their names escape me at the moment!  But my point is movies where so many main characters are introduced, usually the first in the series, are often the best, because these are the movies where you meet and get to know and fall in love with said characters, as you do so here.  And you come along a main evil, humanity, which wants to rid the world of mutants.  And there are also so many sub-stories, sub-origin stories as well.  Like where everyone is coming from, their backstories, how they are meeting and coming to Professor Xavier's school, coming together, and on the reverse how the other, ""bad"" mutants are coming to Magneto's side, etc., and the other stories, and love plots, between Jean and Wolverine and with Rogue wanting so badly to make a connection and being unable to touch anyone.  This is also Anna Paquin's big coming out, playing Rogue, her first big part on the big screen (now as Sookie Stackhouse in the True Blood series), and she really makes her mark and nails this part like no other could.

Each mutant possesses thier own unique special power.  Wolverine has razor-sharp claws that extend and retract, Storm has the ability to control the weather, Cyclops has red laseres that shoot from his eyes, Dr. Grey has telekenitic powers, while Xavier can read people's minds.Xavier has nurtured the mutants through the disguise of a ""school for gifted children"".  However, he concentrates his efforts on helping mutants use their unique powers to help better mankind.  Wolverine, who is found by Storm and Cyclops stranded in a snowstorm after an attack by Magneto's thugs, is taken to Xavier's school.  Here, he is helped by Dr. Grey and Xavier to harness his powers.  Rogue, a young girl who was travelling with Wolverine, is also brought along.  She too possesses mutant powers.  She has the ability to absorb other mutants' powers into herself.  Magneto finds out about Rogue and devises a plan to capture her and have her absorb his powers and use them for evil.She tries to flee by leaving on a train, but Wolverine follows her and catches up with her on the train.  However, Magneto is there as well and manages to capture Rogue.The climactic battle between the X-men and Magneto takes place in the Statue of Liberty during a United Nations metting in New York City.  Magneto plans to channel his power to Rogue so she can in turn steal all of the power from the U.N. delegates.The visual effects in this film are first rate and the acting is excellent.

Of course if you're talking about the X-Men, you're talking subject matter that is more mature on many levels than most comics books.  The story line goes head on into the racism and fear of mutants, people born with genetic differences that don't surface until they hit puberty and give them never seen before gifts that allow them to do pretty amazing things, some incredibly beautiful, others intensely frightening.  Professor Charles Xavier (perfectly cast and portrayed by Patrick Stewart) is their unsung savior as a wealthy father figure who takes in these young people to try to mold them into something positive.  On the other end of the spectrum is a jaded and bitter Magneto, also portrayed well by Ian McKellen, who believes that normal humans have had their chance and now something has to be done to show them that mutants are superior.  Xavier's Senior students, Cyclops, Jean Gray and Storm help new found mutants Rogue and Wolverine discover who they are and what may lie in the future.  The actions scenes are unique and original.  All the actors give solid performances, especially Jackman, and Halle Berry impressed me with her Kenyan accent.  I hope she speaks more in the sequel.  The DVD is excellent for true fans because it's obvious that Director Brian Singer wanted so much more for this movie but just wasn't allowed to have it.  Time, budget and a last minute search for someone to play Wolverine caused serious constraints.  Considering the obstacles and the bad luck of past comic-book-to-movie adaptations, this one scores high and pleases fans and normal folks alike.  It stands for something more than just heroes and villians, and it gives us a story about people, no matter who they are or what they can do.

I was especially interested in the 10 minutes of additional footage, since I had heard there was far more than that left on the cutting room floor and wanted to see what was put back in.It was a bit of a disappointment. Although the extra footage is certainly welcome and adds some extra character flavor, it's not in the same aspect ratio as the rest of the movie. In addition, the footage is much darker than the rest of the film, making one wonder why they didn't bother to keep the quality the same as the rest.There's a feature called &quot;interactive version&quot;, which basically plays the regular movie and inserts these bonus footage clips into the play stream as it reaches them. I found this a very poor way of doing it, especially because it doesn't overwrite the footage that's duplicated -- you actually end up seeing the same scene twice (once in bonus version, then the theater version). There's also an annoying pause as the DVD jumps from the movie to the bonus clip, then back.At a time when most other movies with bonus footage are either giving you two versions of the movie (one with, one without) or simply releasing the movie with the extra footage worked in as it was intended, I find it hard to believe that Fox had no interest in doing the same.The other features, such as Hugh Jackman's screen test, are entertaining, but the real reason I wanted this was the movie itself and the bonus footage. The movie, of course, is still great, but the DVD as a whole is just a little lacking, mainly due to how Fox chose to incorporate the extra footage.

However the human race misunderstands them and kind of treats them unfairly, so a powerful good mutant named Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) have formed a school for the gift where young mutants can control their powers and help the benifit of all mankind. However there are some terrorist mutants lead by Magneto (Ian McKellen) who are hellbent on trying to destroy the human race so that mutants can rule over mankind, a runaway mutant girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) who has the power to absorb lifeforces and energy from other beings including mutants temporarily of course as she runs away from home. She meets up with a Canadian mutant named Wolverine (a.k.a. Logan) (Huge Jackman) but after being attacked by a savage brute named Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) they get rescued by a team of mutants named The X-Men lead by Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) where they live in Professor X's school for the gifted to help mankind from the bad mutants such as Magneto's minions like Toad (Ray Park) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijin Stamos) who are planning on mutating the whole human race.An excellent adaptation of the popular comic books from Marvel that started a different trend on superheroes created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Bryan Singer who did the excellent ""Usual Suspects"" was born to do these movies except for the third as he really took the comics metaphor on discrimination of different people well to the big screen after years of development hell even with Carolco originally wanting the rights but Fox came to save it. The acting is quite excellent including the action sequences as i love how this Sci-fi movie plays as a movie about racism in the future and how to try to be accepted by mankind. I love how this movie introduces audiences to a different cinematic superhero then Batman or Superman back in 2000 who is Wolverine making him the best superhero ever! it was followed by an equally awesome yet even better sequel.This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set offers the movie in a glorious picture and sound quality experience that would rocket the viewer to the roof.

Goodness knows, there have been missteps in the past.  But director Brian Singer does about as good a job as can be reasonably expected. First off, we need to thank the makers of Mission Impossible 2 for running over-schedule, thus tying up actor Dougray Scott and consequently allowing actor Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine.  Jackman is the standout in this movie.  His wonderfully understated performance as the &quot;reluctant hero&quot; is arguably the centerpiece of this film.What distinguishes this film from other lesser film adaptions is an intelligent script, or at least intelligent for the genre.  Character development isn't sacrificed to make room for more standard mindless special effects and action setpieces, like in some movies (&quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, anyone?).The in-jokes are funny, and the characters' history and motivations are treated with a fan's level of respect.If the filmmakers can retain those elements of character-driven story and a respect for the source material in future installments, then they may have a successful movie franchise on their hands",4,Better than it should have been.,974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,1166,"['Comic', 'books', 'are', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'translate', 'feature-film', 'format', 'Goodness', 'have', 'been', 'missteps', 'past', 'director', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'can', 'be', 'reasonably', 'expected', 'First', 'off', 'need', 'thank', 'makers', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'running', 'over-schedule', 'thus', 'tying', 'up', 'actor', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'consequently', 'allowing', 'actor', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'play', 'Wolverine', 'Jackman', 'standout', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'performance', 'quot', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'quot', 'arguably', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'other', 'lesser', 'film', 'adaptions', 'intelligent', 'script', 'least', 'intelligent', 'genre', 'Character', 'development', ""n't"", 'sacrificed', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'standard', 'mindless', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'setpieces', 'movies', 'quot', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'quot', 'anyone', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'characters', 'history', 'motivations', 'are', 'treated', 'fan', 'level', 'respect.If', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'retain', 'elements', 'character-driven', 'story', 'respect', 'source', 'material', 'future', 'installments', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'successful', 'movie', 'franchise', 'hands']",X-Men VHS

During the film, I noted some of the changes from the original comic book, such as Storm not having an African accent, Wolverine and Sabertooth do not know each other, Rogue does not have a southern accent and she is a little too young. But these did not take away from the movie at all. The origins of the mutants aren't known (except for Magneto) but I assume there will be a sequel because Rogue doesn't have super strength and she does not fly. The center of attention is Rogue and I won't tell you why, see it for yourself. Geirich, creator of the mutant slaying Sentinels, is dead from the start and Senator Kelly is trying to get the Mutant Registration Act passed. Because of Kelly's and other normal humans feelings about mutants, Magneto has decided that a war is inevidable. With the help of Charles Xavier and his gifted students, mankind may have a chance to survive. But is that enough?The special effects were first rate and the acting fantastic.

A surprisingly enjoyable movie, this has a good dose of the humor of the comics (c'mon, they're mutants - that's inherently silly) while providing a serious dramatic thread (Hugh Jackman's performance as Logan is a breakout, as we can almost feel his anger at the world and his frustration with not being able to remember his past). The real standouts here, though, are Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, who dominate the two sides of the movie. It's a real treat when two actors of their caliber can go up against each other in a movie. The DVD is flawless, and has plenty of fun extras (Jackman's screen test, obviously done after the original actor playing Wolverine was injured, is interesting to see). A small warning to parents: the flashback scenes are quite intense and more than a little disturbing. There is one glaring omission to this DVD, probably the result of it being rushed out for the winter holidays: there is no commentary track from Bryan Singer or from anyone else.

While I question some of the casting decisions (bad-boy James Marsden as Scott/Cyclops, the quintessential Boy Scout?), the acting was also uniformly excellent, especially Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. The special effects are seamlessly integrated, making each character's mutant powers seem both supernatural and utterly believable, and look especially good on DVD.Now for the DVD itself. The deleted scenes are nice, although most of them were taken out for good reason, as they're just expanded versions of scenes that stayed in the movie. I do like the special option that lets you watch the movie with the deleted scenes spliced in, though...this is a feature that more DVDs should have.

521535,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00003CX8I,JRP,"[0, 0]","Now before my 1st 20 years ago review for the month of May X2 I thought I would review the 1st X Men movie as a kid you know I was a fan of the animated X Men show I had a lot of the toys & of course I was a fan of the animated show from the 90's & I always wanted a movie made about The X Men. So in the year 2000 X Men was released in theaters. Now I do enjoy all 3 movies cause I can get some entertainment out of The Last Stand but I have my problems with it & it's not as good as the 1st X Men movies. But getting to this review X Men was directed by Bryan Singer who directed the sequel to this movie as well as Apt Pupil The Usual Suspects & unfortantly Superman Returns. It stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, James Mardsen as Cyclops, Famke Janseen as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin as Rouge, Rebecca Romjn as Mystique & Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The story is you start off in 1944 in Poland a boy named Eric Lehnsher who is seperated from his parents & they are being taken off to a gas chamber. This scene imo is better than X Men First Class where the guards are holding him back from getting to his parents & his mutant powers are triggered & he bends a metal gate the effects are so much better than those Secret World Of Alex Mack effects in First Class. So Eric goes on to become Magneto. Then you get to 50 years later you're introduced to this girl nmaed Marie who kiss her Boyfriend & she has mutant powers that that can take away peoples life force. It nearly kills her Boyfriend & he was put in a coma for 3 weeks Marie runs away from home & goes by the name of Rouge. She ends up in northern Alberta Cnaada she sees this cage fight going on where Wolverine is kicking a  s  s. Some guys start hounding Wolverine & pulls his claws out & The Bar Tender pulls a Shot Gun out on him Wolverine cuts it in 2. While he is leaving he discovers Rouge hiding in the back of his truck. He lets her go along. They are attacked by Sabertooth who works for Magneto but they are saved by Cycolps & Storm. Then you haved this Senator named Robert Kelly who wants to start up a Mutant Regerstration Program during the hearings he debates Jean Grey meanwhile you have Professor Xavier spot his old friend Eric & as you should know they have different view points Xavier wants peace with Mutants & Humans while Magneto wants a war. Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen had a good back & forth with each other in these movies. I have heard people say Professor X & Magneto in X Men First Class was better I'm sorry but James McAvoy is a bad actor & Michael Fassbender is an overrated actor & that movie is a crime compared to what was told in the animated series. Then you get to the mansion where Wolverine comes to & tries to escape he looks for Rouge but meets Professor Xavier he is told that this is a school for mutants & how he can help him figure out his past. Meanwhile Magneto hatches this plot to capture Senator Kelly & another of Magneto's hench men Toad is flying the helicopter & Mystique a shape shifter turns into 1 of Senator Kelly's aid's. Magneto infects him with Mutant powers. He escapes & tells The X Men what Magneto is up to. 1 night Rouge hears noises coming from Wolverine's room she goes to check on him he accidently sticks his claws in her & she starts to absorb his power. Mystique transforms into this student named Bobby who is a love interest of Rouge's & tells her that everyone is mad at her & she should leave. Mystique sets up Cerebro the supercomputer of Professor X uses to kill him. Rouge is tracked down to a train station. The Professor has Cyclops & Storm go to get her he has Wolverine stay he fells that Magneto is trying to but Wolverine takes Cyclops motorcycle & goes to get her anyway. While he talks to Rouge Magneto shows up takes Rouge the police try to stop Magneto but that doesn't work out for them. When Magneto turns the cops weapons on them Xavier uses his powers to save them. They figure out why Magneto took Rouge cause with her he can infect many people. Cause the machine he used on Senator Kelly nearly killed him. When The Professor used Cerbro it nearly kills him leaving him in a coma. You have the team suit up & go after Magneto. There is  this summit going on with all these World Leaders & Magneto wants to inffect them. The X Men fight off Mystique & Toad. Mystique transforms into Wolverine her & Wolverine have a pretty good fight. Meanwhile Storm,  Jean Grey & Cyclops have their troubles with Toad. Toad also spits some kind of slime into Jean Grey's face. Storm defeats & of course she has this stupid line. Then you have this scene where Mystique turns into Storm & she tells Wolverine they need to regroup but Wolverine knows it's not Storm by her scent & he stabs her in the stomach. Then you have scene that I felt this is what animated series Wolverine would say when Cyclops & Storm think Wolverine is Mystique & Cyclops wants him to prove it Wolverine says ""You're ad  i  c  k."" They get to the top of The Statue Of Liberty where Magneto traps them he also uses his powers to to move Wolverine's arms to his chest. Wolverine injures himself to break free has a good fight with Sabertooth he kills Sabertooth. Storm & Jean Grey compine their powers to get Wolverine to the top of the machine where he destroy's it & saves Rouge. Magneto is defeated you have Professor X tells Wolverine that there is this abandoned Military Base in Canada that might hold some secret of his past. The group find out Mystique is still alive & she is impersonating Senator Kelly. You have a great ending where you have Magneto tells Professor X that he will eventually escape & Xavier says he will be there to stop him. Now getting to the things I didn't care for they focused on Wolverine & not the entire X Men which they do a lot in all 3 movies  mainly in the 1st & 3rd. I didn't like what they did with Robert Kelly seeing as his character got important in the animated series. But the rest you had a cast that clikced well humor that worked good directing by Bryan Singer. Patrick Stewart was did a great job. Ian McKellen was great.

I really wasn't all that excited because I was not exactly a fan of the comics, and I never really cared for superheroes. But this film surprised me beyond belief, I really liked it and I saw it twice at the movies, both times the level of excitement and interest were unbelievably high!In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them &quot;mutants&quot;, the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Daivson). The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called &quot;X-Men&quot; to stop him. In the meantime, 2 mysterious mutants, one named Logan (Hugh Jackman), a powerful and agressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) emerge. Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?X-Men is a largely enjoyable and well-paced comic adaption that mixes thrills, action, science and comedy all into 90 minutes, and does it quite superbly. The star-filled cast all have a blast, really bringing the mutants alive, newcomer Hugh Jackman in particular, he's really quite stunning as Wolverine, and he is going to be huge. Famke Jenssen and Halle Berry should've been used more, but the plot is mostly worked around Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen + Jackman and Anna Paquin, so it really uses up most of the room. But, that's a minor flaw, in an awesomely-decorated, excellently strung-together piece of work that is much better than anyone had the right to expect.Roll on X-Men 2.

521540,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00003CX8I,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 7]","In the year 2000, Marvel Comics in association with 20th Century Fox officially ushered in the current age of superhero movies with the successful box office smash ""X-Men"". Truthfully, out of all of their vast properties to adapt for the silver screen, the X-Men seemed in my estimation to be one of the riskiest endeavors for Marvel in terms of being a hit. I felt it was a risky choice if for no other reason than the fact that the X-Men universe is so rich and diverse that it would seem almost impossible to winnow it down to a manageable level that could easily fit into a 90 minute or two hour running time. Yet, despite a few minor flaws in the story and/or some tweaks to some characters, the difficult task was accomplished in an extremely impressive fashion under the watchful eye of talented director Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"").""X-Men"" is the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has the unique ability to heal from any wound along with unsheathing razor-sharp adamantium (an unbreakable metal) claws from his hands, as he struggles to find the truth about himself, while helping a young mutant named Rogue (Anna Paquin). During their journey the two encounter a team of mutants led by the enigmatic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that somehow both humans and mutants can find a way to peacefully co-exist with one another. However, for every school of thought there is an equally strong opposing viewpoint, and this one is led by a powerful and extremely angry mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellan). As battle lines are being drawn, Wolverine and Rogue find themselves stuck in the middle of a war they never knew existed, and are forced to choose a side to stand with before time runs out.The story for ""X-Men"" as written by David Hayter (""Watchmen"") provided a very nice and neat introduction into the expansive universe that these iconic characters inhabit. While this initial film featured a relatively focused story that revolved around the two pivotal roles of Wolverine and Rogue and their quest for answers and acceptance, it hinted at the potential for a much bigger story to follow on a much grander scale. For most franchises to succeed, especially those that could be deemed risky, you need the initial story to be a little smaller in scope in order to draw your audience in and establish the groundwork of relationships with which further sequels can build upon. Writer David Hayter understood this and crafted a very tight and concise script that moved along at an almost relentless pace, yet without really skimping on too many of the details. For comic book fans there were numerous nods or references to either events or characters from the comics, but this movie wasn't just for the fanboys. The wisest decision that 20th Century Fox and Marvel made was to make these characters as accessible to those outside of the world of comics as possible, but at the same time not making such drastic changes so as to alienate your core fan base. All of this was achieved with the story for ""X-Men"" and as I said a moment ago, it served as the perfect jumping point for this series to expand from.Bringing the film to life was director Bryan Singer, who with this movie brought to comic book films something that had been noticeably absent for many years...a semi-grounded sense of reality not too dissimilar from our own (apart from the whole super-powered thing mind you). Previous to this film (and for that matter the first ""Blade"" film), the only truly successful comic book movies were those in the initial Batman franchise, and in each of those movies we found a very eccentric, gothic-inspired reality that was more outlandish and showy. For me I appreciated the fact that Bryan chose to steep these films in a reality that was much more recognizable to our own rather than one much more fantastic. By doing this we are able to better relate to the characters, and therefore become immersed in the story, allowing for a much easier suspension of our disbelief (which every fantasy and/or sci-fi film relies upon).Besides the look and feel of the film, Bryan also excelled in creating some really fun, entertaining action sequences that at times felt like they were the very panels of a comic book coming to life. As a fan of comic books and some of the comic book films that had come prior to this film's release, I was pleased to watch an adaptation that knew how to blend the action elements together with intriguing character development. Generally these types of films had been written off as no more than summer fluff at the box office, and nine times out of ten this had been proven true. Not since 1989's ""Batman"" (to my recollection) had a comic book movie effectively blended those two all-important elements together to such a great degree of success. So, for this adaptation to buck the established order of things (so to speak), and actually include a coherent story rife with interesting characters along with the obvious entertainment factor inherent in most visual effects movies was a bit unheard of. Thankfully, Bryan Singer and his writer David Hayter, along with everyone else involved in the decision making behind the scenes of ""X-Men"" were smart enough to create a film that stayed somewhat true to the notion that this was a summer blockbuster, but also a movie that contained some great drama and could please audiences for years to come beyond its stay at the box office.Starring in this film is quite the varied group of talented actors and actresses ranging from veterans of both stage and screen, such as Sir Ian McKellan (""Apt Pupil"") and Patrick Stewart (""Star Trek: Nemesis""), to some of Hollywood's great beauties like Famke Janssen (""Taken"") and Halle Berry (""Swordfish"") to relative new faces like Anna Paquin (""Fly Away Home"") and Hugh Jackman (""Someone Like You""). What was great about this cast is that each member brought a seriousness to the role and portrayed these comic book characters as if they were any other dramatic role, opting not to play up the camp factor that would have been the order of the day in previous years past (for example the much maligned ""Batman & Robin""). For a majority of the actors and actresses chosen for the various mutants, and humans for that matter, the casting appeared to be strokes of genius and good fortune combined, as each one looked as if they had manifested directly from the comic book page.Perhaps the biggest surprise casting choice, for me at least, would be a then unknown Hugh Jackman as the fan favorite Wolverine. Having not seen Jackman in anything prior to this film I wasn't sure if he could do justice to the clawed hero; however, I was completely blown away by the intensity and ferocity that Jackman brought to the role. His portrayal is so spot-on that it reached the point that his interpretation became almost universally accepted by the comic book fan community as being the one true Wolverine. A move that is surprising given that this community is generally extremely finicky about sticking to the details of their beloved heroes, not to mention the fact that Jackman is over 6' tall, lean, yet still muscular rather than being a short, and semi-stocky, but extremely muscular guy that would more closely resemble his comic book counterpart. With that knowledge one could see how surprising it is that his portrayal was so easily accepted, but I guess when it's clear that he's the ideal person for the role, some details can be overlooked for the greater good of the franchise.""X-Men"" was a very well written, directed, and acted movie that gave comic book fans and audiences in general something that everyone could enjoy. For comic book fans there were some minor gripes about changes made to some of the characters origins, but nothing significant enough to take away from how great this movie was, or what it would mean for other comic book characters being brought to life on the big screen. Even after all the comic book movies that have bowed since this film's opening, ""X-Men"" still remains one of my all-time favorites of the genre, a fact that I don't see changing anytime in the near future.""X-Men"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",4,Those We Fear Are the Only Ones Who Can Save Us...,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,8228,"['year', '2000', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'association',

At 14, Rogue was taken in by Mystique, &quot;Mama&quot; and coerced into sucking the life from Marvel Girl, leaving her in a coma and listed as a Jane Doe in the cartoon.

521552,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00003CX8I,K. Driscoll,"[4, 5]","The first X-Men film is not really perfect, but in terms of it's timing and what it meant might be coming down the pike with regards to cinematic interpretations of comic books (specifically Marvel comics) it is pretty darn close to perfect. Lets face it, this is the harbinger of the comic book movie age that has, like it or not, made some exciting and high-grossing films. I personally think the majority of comic book movies fail and could care less about how much money they make, but X-Men is a bit more than that. It's a very good movie too.I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters but that actually served the film well in terms of how I viewed the hype. I didn't care because so many did...that's the old punk in me in guess. So I waited and received the film as an early Christmas gift the following year. I actually watched it Christmas eve and found it to be incredibly refreshing and enjoyable.It begins by showing us a young boy being separated from his parents at a German concentration camp in Poland. His parents are going into the camp and will be killed. The boy is desperate to save them and as the German soldiers hold him down he reaches out and somehow begins to bend the metal gates that close in his parents before being struck down by the [...] of one of the soldiers' guns. The boy is Eric Lehnsherr, one of the great all-time Marvel comic villains known as Magneto. In one fell swoop, Bryan Singer does something that I've always been glad X-Men writers did consistently, and that is allow us to sympathize with this villain.We are then introduced to the primary plot of a modern day Senator bent on the granting the government the ability to force registration of all mutants. Then it shows how telepathic and mind manipulating mutant Charles Xavier and his old friend and rival Magneto fundamentally disagree on how mutants as a race must react to this oncoming repression. This is followed by the introduction to our primary protagonists; Rogue, a young girl who drains the life of all people her skin makes contact with, and Wolverine, an enhanced mutant with the ability to heal himself enough that his body endured somking of skeletal replacement surgery. His skeleton is made of an indestructible metal and he also has claws made of this metal that break through his skin anytime he wants to kill someone. Great characters that Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman are able to portray well here. Again, Singer introduces these characters with relatable depth.In short, Magneto wants to destroy humanity and the X-Men must stop him in an environment where they are not appreciated in the least by the public. Singer attempts to make sociological insights on those terms in addition to bringing great character depth. When you consider the number of characters and the length of the movie, these are not easy tasks to say the least. Then again, when watching the Usual Suspects it's quite obvious Singer has a knack for just this sort of thing.X-Men is a very good movie but I won't give it five stars because it also contains some fairly annoying dialogue that I absolutely refuse to forgive. For example, the character Storm asks the villain Toad what happens when a toad is hit by lightning and answers her own question by saying ""the same as everything else."" It's not funny or witty.

The characters are silly.  The plot was aweful.  The acting non-existant, except for Sir McKellen and Mr. Picard.  They stole their scenes.  However, too much emphasis was placed by Mr. Singer on the action and the aweful plot of bash the bad guys.  I understand this is a typical summer blockbuster movie, so plot is irrelevant and the fans want explosion and fighting. Fine, if that's what you want, then go for it. In any case, this movie stunk.  The box office also proved my sentiments.  It's NOT a blockbuster if a movie made less than $150 million.  The gross is probably less than 50 million.  That's aweful.  Movie watchers stopped supporting this movie by the 4th week, if not earlier.  This movie appeals to the comic book fan base.  Not much else, I guess.  There's plenty of X-men and Marvel goodies here , but for us normal folks who demand decent acting and a decent plot, this just doesn't deliver.

Well, then came X-Men.  6 times I saw this movie in the theatre, and every time, it was like seeing it for the first time.  The movie does the impossible, it takes a 30 year old comic book property and makes it publically accessible, which is in its self, a triumph.  Yet, then there are all of those little things that fanboys, such as I would pick up on.  Especially the &quot;yellow spandex&quot; joke toward the ending of the movie.  The movie also took it's subject matter seriously, which most comic movies don't do.  The X-Men isn't about rich guys upset about dead parents, or aliens sent to Earth who grow up to be over the top boyscouts in blue tights, its about, simply put, racism.  Humanity hates and fears mutants because of their genetic enhancements.  Fueling humanities hatred, Sentator Kelly, bent on advancing his political career by stoking the proverbial fire.  There truly is no villain in this movie save humanities ignorance, but on the more extreme side of the mutant spectrum is Magneto.  Having survived the Holocaust in WW2, he fears world wide mutant genocide and is prepared to take any actions to prevent this from happening...even if it means waging a war on humanity.  On the other end of the spectrum, Professor Xavier, who respects humanity and only wishes peaceful coexistance with them.  Visually, this film is stunning.  The &quot;mutant effects&quot; look real, especially Cyclop's optic blast.  The only problems I had with this movie were that it wasn't long enough and that Storm didn't have a bigger role.  Halle Berry was a wonderful Storm and she commanded every scene she was in, but her role wasn't big enough.  Hopefully, that will be rectified when the sequel gets made.

Director Singer, best known for The Usual Suspects, has created a film which is inventive and exciting while staying true to the comic's origins.The main star of the film is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, a rouge mutant who joins Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)'s team of mutants including Cyclops, Storm and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who are pitted against Magneto (Ian McKellen), the head honcho of bad guys with a plan to turn the world's population into mutants.Wolverine is the main guy here, as Jackman proves to be perfect for the role of the hairy guy with some nasty claws. The star power of McKellen and Patrick Stewart gives the film it's gravitas, and the supporting cast of Tyler Mane as the imposing Sabertooth and Ray Park as Toad combine to create a great ensamble cast abbeted with a great script to work with.Seamless CG combined with impressive live-action stunts is awesome, and the film's strong point, action, is well-paced and exciting, with a string of set-pices building up to the huge and amazing finale. The score, by Michael Kamen is a pulse-driven soundtrack that fits the film's style and tone well.There are problems; the film does centre around Wolverine too much, making you want a bit more exposition on the other charcters and their backgrounds, and the film's running time makes the viewer want more, but hey, that's what sequels are for, and the next instalment will no doubt be worth the wait...The DVD extras are impressive with ""making of""s, deleted scenes and production material.",4,Brian Singer's X Men,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,1651,"['Brian', 'Singer', 'take', 'classic', 'X', 'Men', 'comic', 'fun', 'action-filled', 'film', 'great', 'characters', 'eye-popping', 'SFX', 'Director', 'Singer', 'best', 'known', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'created', 'film', 'inventive', 'exciting', 'staying', 'true', 'comic', 'origins.The', 'main', 'star', 'film', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'rouge', 'mutant', 'who', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'team', 'mutants', 'including', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'Dr.', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'who', 'are', 'pitted', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'head', 'honcho', 'bad', 'guys', 'plan', 'turn', 'world', 'population', 'mutants.Wolverine', 'main', 'guy', 'here', 'Jackman', 'be', 'perfect', 'role', 'hairy', 'guy', 'nasty', 'claws', 'star', 'power', 'McKellen', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'film', 'gravitas', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'imposing', 'Sabertooth', 'Ray', 'Park', 'Toad', 'combine', 'create', 'great', 'ensamble', 'cast', 'abbeted', 'great', 'script', 'work', 'with.Seamless', 'CG', 'combined', 'impressive', 'live-action', 'stunts', 'awesome', 'film', 'strong', 'point', 'action', 'well-paced', 'exciting', 'string', 'set-pices', 'building', 'up', 'huge', 'amazing', 'finale', 'score', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'pulse-driven', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'style', 'tone', 'are', 'problems', 'film', 'centre', 'Wolverine', 'too', 'much', 'making', 'want', 'bit', 'more', 'exposition', 'other', 'charcters', 'backgrounds', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'viewer', 'want', 'more', 'hey', 'what', 'sequels', 'are', 'next', 'instalment', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'wait', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'impressive', 'making', 's', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'production', 'material']",X-Men VHS

I had goosebumps), and the story was about par for the course. I watched it, and I saw a fine tradition of comics make it's first successful transition to the big screen. I was thrilled and excited. Like the first time Superman and Spiderman teamed up.I have to say, that when I first heard about this movie, I was sure that &quot;They&quot; couldn't get the characters right. Well, I was 90% wrong. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Xavier were all magnificent. There were some adjustments made to ages of other characters, but that's okay. Every story teller changes things to suit their tale. I think Grace Jones would have made a better Storm/Ororo, but my opinion wasn't sought.The only real flaw in the movie is the focal point on Magneto.  The characterization was good, but the characterization of Magneto's ethics, the core beliefs, fell short here, and I was very upset. Magneto was/is a character whose goal differed from Xavier's in that he felt mutants should live apart from humans, instead of with and amongst them. His protectiveness of mutant-kind (Homo Sapiens Superior), and his perception of mankind (Homo Sapiens) as the equivalent of the Nazi Reich, was what kept him on the outside fringe of law and order. The character himself believe in justice, and honor.So he wouldn't have played it the way he did in the movie. Eric Magnus Lensher would never have sacrificed someone else to do something that he could do himself. It was something that was integral to how he was seen by the world at large, and his own feelings about mutant brotherhood.Keep in mind, this is all from the perspective of one who grew up on the tales of these heroes. From the fresh perspective of one uneducated/untainted (depending on your point of view) this is a good movie for action buffs, anime fans and those who like one-liners throughout.So +1 star for the comic-fan's rating, as is for the movie... as is.

I saw the theatrical release and watched this on VCR, but the DVD format is super.  The interviews with director Singer on the Rose show really tell us what he was doing with the film; and he did deliver.  The cartoon comic characters are there with enough action and pacing to keep the kids' interest, but there is also the depth of levels with themes of racism and intolerance to pique the adult viewer's interest and make this a movie ABOUT SOMETHING more than just the cartoon.  The actors turn in fine performances.  I enjoyed the extra material in the DVD version.  We had fun watching part of it in French.  The Fox commentary with Bruce Davison's Senate campaign commercials and the mock news format was a fun addition to the film.  The actors' interviews are illuminating.  I enjoyed seeing what the actress who plays Mystique (the blue woman) looked like.  In retrospect, I really enjoyed the control Halee Berry shows with the character of Storm.

521568,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B00003CX8I,Libretio,"[16, 21]","X-MEN(USA - 2000)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS / SDDSIn a brief interview with director Bryan Singer (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, APT PUPIL) included in the supplemental materials of the original US DVD edition of X-MEN, the alarmingly young-looking helmer explains that the film - originally intended for a Christmas 2000 release - was abruptly rescheduled for summer of that year, forcing the entire production to scramble desperately to realize its lofty ambitions. Against all the odds, the final product (based on a long-running Marvel comic series developed by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Chris Claremont and Len Wein) demonstrates a profound maturity that lifts it head and shoulders above the massed ranks of mechanical Hollywood blockbusters, whilst simultaneously delivering the kind of effects-heavy spectacle that audiences have come to expect from this particular sub-genre.Whilst bigoted politicians are fomenting unreasoning hostility toward a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers including telepathy, pschokinesis and/or mind control, representing the next stage in human evolution - a benevolent psychic named Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has established a private school where he teaches particularly gifted mutants to channel their abilities safely. But some of his most powerful students - played with earnest conviction by a number of Hollywood's sexiest rising stars, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden - are called upon to challenge the wrath of Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant supervillain whose hatred of mankind was cultivated in a Nazi concentration camp (outlined in a harrowing opening sequence, where the film's sober intentions are signalled in no uncertain terms), and who is determined to launch a devastating assualt on the world's non-mutant population, igniting a war between the species that only the mutants can win.The unusually clever scenario provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, without skimping on either aspect of the production. That's due partly to David Hayter's concise script, Singer's ingenious ability to convey a wealth of relevant information at high speed without rushing or obscuring the details, and a strict adherence to the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.). The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen may seem unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors elevate the proceedings beyond the confines of mere 'Good and Evil', adding real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team are somewhat underused, but they certainly LOOK spectacular and they make the most of their limited screen time, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen.Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of a rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's Panavision photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins, reflected in the DVD's similarly-styled packaging.While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia, the only form of prejudice which remains openly condoned throughout society. Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protestors gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? These themes are further underlined in a Fox TV special included on the original DVD release, constructed as a series of news reports surrounding Congressional hearings on a proposed Mutant Registration Act, wherein Davison holds court with almost religious fervor, spitefully twisting the evidence to suit his own rhetoric, only to be laid low by an amusing final twist that mirrors the downfall of many a similar real-life politician. This particular interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) that he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it certainly provides plenty of food for thought...Followed by X2 (2003).",4,Mature SF-fantasy doesn't skimp on the action,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,5093,"['X-MEN', 'USA', '2000',

This is the era of far glitzier issues with whole teams cooperating to make the pages shock and titillate.  Life was a bit tamer then, comics were fun, but not exactly earth-shattering.  So thinking ""The X-Men, Ho-Hum,"" I did not bother to see the film when it came out.  That was a serious mistake.  I have a very large monitor, but there is no question but that I should have seen it then.This film is remarkable for many reasons.  First, the script is as fresh and up-to-date as could be.  Gone are the super heroic declamations (other than when Dr. Xavier and Magneto argue) and in their place is good, dramatic dialog delivered by talented, professional actors.  Then there is the filming, which consistently avoids any sense of cramped or overly open space.  It provides a seamless background for the special effects.  If the dialog has been brought down to a human scale, the visual imagery completely exceeded my expectations.Casting is wonderful too.  Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) seem made for their parts, and the rest of the cast are no less able.  This is not a Dino De Laurentiis film with one or two good actors using spectacle to cover its weaknesses.  Instead, we have an entire cast that conspires to make the unbelievable real.  And Michael Kamen's music is also a treat.The film brings home far better than the comic series ever did that the problem being dealt with is not really good mutants vs. bad mutants.  Instead, the real issue is that these mutants are trying to live in a world full people who are suspicious and fearful of those who are 'different.'  This is a talel about the effects of prejudice, clothed in an action story.  The protagonists stand for two possible solutions.  Sometimes one can understand Magneto (Ian McKellan) despite his willingness to use evil for his purposes.The plot is the simple tale of Logan and Rogue's (Anna Paquin) coming to Dr. Xavier's school and the ensuing struggle to stop Magneto from turning a ray that makes humans into mutants on an assembly of diplomats.  Each of the characters contains a story, often deeply tragic, and each has given something up as the price of their talents.The DVD is a bit short on extras.  A short on the film's making, an interview with director Brian Singer, and various other bits and pieces.  A special feature that adds back in other versions of scenes sounds interesting, but actually amounts to very little.  This is a worthwhile film. If it did not have quite the impact on me that the first Star Wars did, it still was an engrossing experience in a jaded world.

The XMEN Movie Series, the Spiderman Movie Series, the Blade Series, Fantastic 4, Hulk, etc. They've had some duds, too(Iron Man, Fantastic 4 II, Elektra, Blade Trinity, the 2nd Hulk movie, Daredevil, etc.), but that total comes to 10 to 0 against DC(if you count movies with lasting impact). Might I add, that's also in a shorter frame of time.X-MEN movies point indirectly to the Civil Rights Struggle or Battle For Equality/Freedom To Thrive. Sub mutants in for minorities/undesirables and humans in for RACIST whites/intolerant people and X-MEN comes into clearer focus. This movie features leader and professor Xavier(extraordinary, unbelievable mental control-- enhanced even more by Cerebro: a device that gives Xavier scanning, pinpointing, and other special extras) who runs his school for mutants(usually powerful) which doubles as a defense agency. The hands-on agency particularly deals with mutant vs. human rights/affairs--with no quarter given to either side.  Xavier's mutants important to this movie are Cyclops (field leader and has a powerful optic blast), Jean Grey(Cyclops' wife and controls objects with her mind plus is slightly psychic), Storm(the power of the weather--any of them), Wolverine(unbreakably metallic claws; unbreakably  metallic skeleton; heightened senses despite being a heavy  smoker; and almost instantaneous healing ability from almost any illness or injury), Iceman(generates ice), and Rogue(can absorb another's life force: partly or completely & their feelings/memories/abilities for a relatively short time; when doing so, she weakens the victim and can kill, if prolonged). Iceman and Rogue are teenagers and numbered as apart of the children: not allowed to fight at this point. They try to use peace to solve their problems, but, in situations where this is not possible or their special abilities give them an added boost, they will use their abilities. His team of mutants also have access to a state of the art jet. Enter their problem in this movie: Magneto(decades ago, he and Xavier were tight friends working for Xavier's transcendent goal until Magneto's--prior to officially becoming Magneto--family gets killed by humans) now regards Xavier as a civil  acquaintance and will attack anything or anyone who interferes with his mission: mutant superiority to humans.  Helping him are likeminded mutants: Mystique(shifts into  the form of other people), Toad(super long tongue and frog like abilities), and Sabretooth(stronger than Wolverine and has his healing ability without the metallic claws). Magneto plans on turning all humans into mutants and this involves the death of Rogue and all the death of the humans to which this machine's energy is applied. The old friends' missions always clash and, many times, battles break out.

To me this is like watching Dragon Ball Evolution, it's just that horrible.I really still to this day don't understand why people say they love this film even fellow X-men fans because I don't get it. Ever since I was a kid I used to collect the cards, read the comic books, play with the toys, watch the show and play the games. A real live X-men movie was something of a fantasy, and to find out it was actually happening was a dream come true. Anyone who has ever cracked open a comic book or watched the Saturday morning cartoon show on Fox knows that this movie is NOT the X-men and neither were any of the sequels this thing spawned. Some characters did look good like Mystique haha no I take that back. They all look as though the person that designed them for the movie never read the comic book. Mystique is a vixen and a sexy blue skinned red haired seductress not a lizard woman but, that's just many problems I had with the movie.For starters with the custom design not even in the picture it's really about how they portray the X-men and their relationships to one another. First of all the X-men even though not officially act as a military group. They have Ranks and Teams that they work with under the command of Professor X. Storm leads one Team and Cyclops leads another. Storm is not a background character she is key figure and 2nd in command to Professor X. She is the Xavier's Right hand and Scott is his left hand. Now that leads to other things about this movie that are off. Wolverines relationship with other characters in this movie. For one thing Wolverine does not like Cyclops and he doesn't bother himself with him unless he has too which means he mostly spends his time around storm when it comes to finding out what he needs to know or getting his orders. Storm and Wolverine are actually very close friends and he's probably closer to her than just about anyone on the team.Which leads to another problem with the movie when Rouge is introduced. Wolverine and Rouge are not buddy buddy their just acquaintances like Co-workers. Rouge is also a grown woman and not a little girl. Jubilee however is a young teenage girl that Wolverine adores and she looks up to and admires him. For some reason this movie completely turns character roles and relationships around and that breaks the story completely.So as you watch the movie you think to yourself mostly ... ""what?"" ... ""that's not how that happens?"" ""What the?"" .. hey ""why did they do that?"" and so on and so fourth. Basically they completely rewrote the story of X-men just to fit it into the big screen. This is mostly a movie about Wolverine,Cyclopes&Jean; Grey all the other X-men are just background characters. I did enjoy seeing Magneto and some of the other Brotherhood of Mutant villains in this one but, they kind of ruin them in a way as well. The villians in X-men aren't really Villains, they both want the same goal but just go about achieving it in a different way. Xavier wants to coexists with humans and Magneto wants to eradicate them. The movie never really explores the characters in that right and just makes this seem like another good guy stops bad guy comic book movie and that is NOT what X-men is about. The villians are just as favored as the heroes and both sides should have been explored and explained better I think.They tried with this one and it was a hit with mostly people who don't know much about the X-men but for the rest of us we were expecting to see our beloved comic book characters come to life and it didn't really happen. The characters in the movie are much much much weaker than they are in the comic books. I didn't understand that part at all as the other movies that came later like the Hulk,Iron Man, Fantastic 4 and all the rest did a good job at showing the strength of the characters but the X-men really didn't do to well at that. Especially with Storm and Wolverine.Overall this move came and we all went to see it and it was a hit but, I don't feel like the X-MEN got the type of movie treatment that they really deserved.",2,From the point of an X-men fan...,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,4252,"['movie', 'was', 'really', 'terrible', 'many', 'Super', 'hero', 'movies', 'come', 'out', '2000-2012', 'X-men', 'series', 'was', 'worst', 'one', 'followed', 'comic', 'book', 'least', 'watching', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Evolution', 'just', 'horrible.I', 'really', 'still', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'say', 'love', 'film', 'even', 'fellow', 'X-men', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Ever', 'was', 'kid', 'used', 'collect', 'cards', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'play', 'toys', 'watch', 'show', 'play', 'games', 'real', 'live', 'X-men', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'fantasy', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'was', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'cracked', 'open', 'comic', 'book', 'watched', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'show', 'Fox', 'movie', 'NOT', 'X-men', 'were', 'sequels', 'thing', 'spawned', 'characters', 'did', 'look', 'good', 'Mystique', 'haha', 'take', 'back', 'look', 'person', 'designed', 'movie', 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'Mystique', 'vixen', 'sexy', 'blue', 'skinned', 'red', 'haired', 'seductress', 'not', 'lizard', 'woman', 'just', 'many', 'problems', 'had', 'movie.For', 'starters', 'custom', 'design', 'not', 'even', 'picture', 'really', 'how', 'portray', 'X-men', 'relationships', 'one', 'First', 'X-men', 'even', 'not', 'officially', 'act', 'military', 'group', 'have', 'Ranks', 'Teams', 'work', 'command', 'Professor', 'X', 'Storm', 'one', 'Team', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'not', 'background', 'character', 'key', 'figure', '2nd', 'command', 'Professor', 'X', 'Xavier', 'Right', 'hand', 'Scott', 'left', 'hand', 'Now', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'off', 'Wolverines', 'relationship', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'like', 'Cyclops', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'mostly', 'time', 'around', 'storm', 'when', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'know', 'getting', 'orders', 'Storm', 'Wolverine', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'close', 'friends', 'probably', 'closer', 'just', 'anyone', 'team.Which', 'problem', 'movie', 'when', 'Rouge', 'introduced', 'Wolverine', 'Rouge', 'are', 'not', 'buddy', 'buddy', 'just', 'acquaintances', 'Co-workers', 'Rouge', 'also', 'grown', 'woman', 'not', 'little', 'girl', 'Jubilee', 'however', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Wolverine', 'adores', 'reason', 'movie', 'completely', 'character', 'roles', 'relationships', 'story', 'completely.So', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'mostly', 'what', 'not', 'how', 'What', 'hey', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'so', 'so', 'fourth', 'Basically', 'completely', 'rewrote', 'story', 'X-men', 'just', 'fit', 'big', 'screen', 'mostly', 'movie', 'Wolverine', 'Cyclopes', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'other', 'X-men', 'are', 'just', 'characters', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Magneto', 'other', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutant', 'villains', 'one', 'kind', 'ruin', 'way', 'well', 'villians', 'X-men', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'Villains', 'want', 'same', 'goal', 'just', 'go', 'achieving', 'different', 'way', 'Xavier', 'coexists', 'humans', 'Magneto', 'eradicate', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'characters', 'right', 'just', 'seem', 'good', 'guy', 'stops', 'bad', 'guy', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'NOT', 'what', 'X-men', 'about', 'villians', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'favored', 'heroes', 'sides', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'explained', 'better', 'think.They', 'tried', 'one', 'was', 'hit', 'mostly', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'X-men', 'rest', 'were', 'expecting', 'see', 'beloved', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'weaker', 'are', 'comic', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'part', 'other', 'movies', 'came', 'later', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Fantastic', '4', 'rest', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'strength', 'characters', 'X-men', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'Especially', 'Storm', 'Wolverine.Overall', 'move', 'came', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'hit', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'X-MEN', 'got', 'type', 'movie', 'treatment', 'really', 'deserved']",X-Men VHS
521587,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CX8I,Matthew Horner,"[1, 5]","I must admit that after watching X-Men, I felt that I must be getting old. Normally, even when I don't relate to a movie, I understand how a certain age group or a certain segment of society could. I then try to review it with that part of the audience in mind. I knew in advance that X-men was wildly popular with many teenagers. It has already gained a sort of cult status. I tried to decide whether or not I would have been bowled over by it when I was seventeen. I decided I would not have been. So, while there is a constancy to the young, it stands to reason that each generation is somewhat unique as to what turns it on and what doesn't. I concluded that I might have been better of watching X-men with a group of kids. Then I might have had the answer. Or maybe I should have just ignored my parents' strict ban on comic books.X-men is based on the wildly successful Marvel Comics series. The time is the near future. According to the story, we are in a period of evolutionary change. The result is a growing number of people who are mutations. These people have extraordinary powers, which can be used for good or for bad. Some members of Congress fear these mutants and want to pass a law forcing them to register with the government. The mutants have banded together into several groups. One major group is led by Professor X [Patrick Stewart]. He has founded a school to teach young mutants how to live with their powers. He believes coexistence with ordinary mortals is possible. The other major group, headed by Magneto [Ian McKellen], thinks that their survival can come only through annihilation of 'normal' people. Professor X's team [the X-men] must stop Magneto and his troops before they reek havoc on the rest of humanity.There are many elements in this story that could have led to a great movie. It is full of colorful characters. Magneto has the power to magnetize metal, while Professor X can read minds. Wolverine is able to heal himself instantly after every battle. Cyclops is equipped with laser vision, Storm can morph into another body, and Raven literally has a touch that can kill. The special effects are all decent enough. One problem is that there is little character development. The characters react as though they have feelings, but these feelings seem superficial. There is little of the depth and angst that made Batman, which had a similar plot, so memorable. In that picture the hero was almost as dark and troubled as The Joker, the villain so wonderfully played by Jack Nicholson. At the same time, both characters had a wonderfully wicked sense of humor. X-Men's director, Bryan Singer, is one of the best, but he seems to have been unable to take characters from a cartoon book and make them anything but cartoon-like. Yet the movie also does not aspire to be a spoof or a satire. The great actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen could have had a field day with this material. Instead, they are required to play serious, and that seriousness may be the movie's biggest problem.",2,Its charm escapes me [perhaps I'm getting old!],1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3026,"['must', 'admit', 'watching', 'X-Men', 'felt', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'old', 'Normally', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'relate', 'movie', 'understand', 'how', 'certain', 'age', 'group', 'certain', 'segment', 'society', 'could', 'then', 'try', 'review', 'part', 'audience', 'mind', 'knew', 'advance', 'X-men', 'was', 'wildly', 'popular', 'many', 'teenagers', 'already', 'gained', 'sort', 'cult', 'status', 'tried', 'decide', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bowled', 'over', 'when', 'was', 'seventeen', 'decided', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'So', 'constancy', 'young', 'reason', 'generation', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'concluded', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'watching', 'X-men', 'group', 'kids', 'Then', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'answer', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'ignored', 'parents', 'strict', 'ban', 'comic', 'books.X-men', 'based', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'series', 'time', 'near', 'future', 'According', 'story', 'are', 'period', 'evolutionary', 'change', 'result', 'growing', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'mutations', 'people', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'good', 'bad', 'members', 'Congress', 'fear', 'mutants', 'want', 'pass', 'law', 'forcing', 'register', 'government', 'mutants', 'have', 'banded', 'together', 'several', 'groups', 'One', 'major', 'group', 'led', 'Professor', 'X', '[', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', ']', 'founded', 'school', 'teach', 'young', 'mutants', 'how', 'live', 'powers', 'coexistence', 'ordinary', 'mortals', 'possible', 'other', 'major', 'group', 'headed', 'Magneto', '[', 'Ian', 'McKellen', ']', 'survival', 'can', 'come', 'only', 'annihilation', ""'normal"", 'people', 'Professor', 'X', 'team', '[', 'X-men', ']', 'must', 'stop', 'Magneto', 'troops', 'reek', 'havoc', 'rest', 'humanity.There', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'great', 'movie', 'full', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Magneto', 'power', 'magnetize', 'metal', 'Professor', 'X', 'can', 'read', 'minds', 'Wolverine', 'able', 'heal', 'instantly', 'battle', 'Cyclops', 'equipped', 'laser', 'vision', 'Storm', 'can', 'morph', 'body', 'Raven', 'literally', 'touch', 'can', 'kill', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'One', 'problem', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'react', 'have', 'feelings', 'feelings', 'seem', 'superficial', 'little', 'depth', 'angst', 'made', 'Batman', 'had', 'similar', 'plot', 'so', 'memorable', 'picture', 'hero', 'was', 'almost', 'dark', 'troubled', 'Joker', 'villain', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'had', 'wonderfully', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'X-Men', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'take', 'characters', 'cartoon', 'book', 'make', 'anything', 'cartoon-like', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'aspire', 'be', 'spoof', 'satire', 'great', 'actors', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'material', 'Instead', 'are', 'required', 'play', 'serious', 'seriousness', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problem']",X-Men VHS

It looks great, the details are better, and it has a DTS TrueHD soundtrack. There are some movies that actually look a bit worse in HD because the effects are done somewhat sloppily and the finer detail in the image just calls attention to their phoniness. I haven't notices that in X Men. It's a very tightly made movie in almost every respect, though I'll admit a soft spot for origin stories.there is some visible film grain, but I assume that that's because of, well, the film. Though I honestly don't know if it's true film grain or if it was added in post (sometimes they do that), but it's rarely, if ever, distracting.

521594,A4RBWH5IMQBXZ,B00003CX8I,"Michael Andrews ""movie buff""","[1, 1]","2000's X-Men, directed by Bryan Singer, could have gone wrong on so many levels, and while it does have some minor flaws here and there, I still find it one of the best cinematic interpretions of a comic book property ever produced. I am a major Marvel fanatic, and I love the X-Men in particular. The notion of a group of superhumans born, or ""cursed"" depending on the various points of view, with their special abilities is always an intriguing one, and comics writer/creator Stan Lee set up such a unique legend with the whole intolerance/racism angle most humans have against the mutant population on Earth. Some mutants, such as Professor Charles Xavier, a telepath and founder of the X-Men team of adventurers, want to teach understanding and acceptance for mutants and humans alike, while others, like Magneto, who can control magnetism and was a prisoner of the Nazi death camps, view humans as scum to be ruled over by ""Homo Superior"".The film follows the character of Logan/Wolverine, well played by then newcomer Hugh Jackman, as he reluctantly joins our heroes in a quest to stop the villianous Magneto (a strong, compelling Ian McKellan) and his Brotherhood of Mutants (The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in the comic books) from using a machine that would turn all humans into mutants...to ""even us out"".The story couldve been beefed up in some aspects, yet this was just the first intro to the mythology on-screen, and it still works; some flaws I had a little trouble with included the notion of the great villian Sabretooth (here played by Tyler Mane) being somewhat subservient to Magneto, sort of like a brainless henchman. If you know the character from the comics, Sabretooth is one of the most vile, cold blooded and actually quite intelligent and cunning supervillians ever created. Rounding out the bad guys is Mystique (played by Rebecca Romajn Stamos), a murderous shapeshifter, and Toad (Ray Park), who has incredible agility and a whip-like tongue.In the X-Men, we have Cyclops (James Marsden), the leader, who shoots destructive energy beams from his eyes, though his curse is he cant control them without a ruby quartz visor to wear, Jean Grey (Famke Jenssen) a telepath/telekinetic, Storm, whose screen characterization could have been beefed up as well as Cyclop's since they are two of the most compelling characters of the group, is played by Halle Berry. She can manipulate the elements (rain, wind, etc). Rounding it out is Rogue (Anna Paguin), whose mutant ability involves touching and absorbing the physical abilities of those around here, sometimes with dire consequences. The great Patrick Stewart plays Prof Xavier. He brings a quiet, understated fatherly authority to the film, and his presence is felt even when hes not on screen.Jackman does a very good job as Wolverine, and it makes you wonder how farther he can go with it, since Wolverine is by far one of the most fun, complex and challenging antiheroes in comics. Personally I felt Jackman was a tad too tall for the role, but he does bring a surly, belligerant yet noble and heroic attitude to Wolverine, which feels right if you know what the character is all about psychologically.The SFX are good but dont overwhelm the story and characters, and Singer directs with a moody, dark vision that thankfully doesnt play down the world these complicated characters inhabit, and actually takes this storyline seriously.

521597,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00003CX8I,Michael J. Mazza,"[1, 1]","In the near future, a new breed of humans--known as mutants--begins to emerge from the general population. Gifted (or cursed, depending on one's standpoint) with a variety of extranormal abilities, these mutants face fear and distrust from society. But under the leadership of Professor Charles Xavier, a group of these mutants has banded together to help light the path to a better future for both mutants and normal humans. This is the premise of &quot;X-Men.&quot;Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter David Hayter faced a daunting task in taking the massive X-Men mythos (which has evolved through decades of different comic book titles, and has involved an encyclopedic number of characters) and adapting it into a feature film. But, together with a superb international cast, the filmmakers succeed brilliantly.A prologue set during the Nazi Holocaust sets the overall serious tone for the film--a welcome change from the increasingly campy and ridiculous &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise. Yes, &quot;X-Men&quot; is a science fiction film with plentiful action and special effects. But at its heart, this film is an intelligent drama about characters who face crises and challenges.Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) squares off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a rival mutant leader with a radically different philosophy. Add to this struggle Bruce Davison as a McCarthyesque, mutant-hating U.S. senator, and you have a rich tapestry of ideological conflict which serves as a backdrop for the frequently explosive action. But overall I found the emotional core of the film to lie in the relationship between Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a seemingly indestructible warrior with retractable metal claws, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with the ability to suck the life force out of others. Each of the actors delivers an excellent performance.The mutants of &quot;X-Men&quot; can be seen as metaphors for any feared or persecuted group in human history. Ultimately, the film celebrates the ability of oppressed individuals to overcome alienation, to form supportive communities, and to work for a greater good. It is, I believe, the film's success in tapping into universal human fears, hopes, and ideological conflicts that elevates it above being merely an excellent sci-fi action epic.",5,More than just a sci-fi action spectacle,990576000,"05 23, 2001",2001,2310,"['near', 'future', 'new', 'breed', 'humans', 'known', 'mutants', 'emerge', 'general', 'population', 'Gifted', 'cursed', 'depending', 'one', 'standpoint', 'variety', 'extranormal', 'abilities', 'mutants', 'face', 'fear', 'distrust', 'society', 'leadership', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'group', 'mutants', 'banded', 'together', 'help', 'light', 'path', 'better', 'future', 'mutants', 'normal', 'humans', 'premise', 'quot', 'X-Men.', 'quot', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Hayter', 'faced', 'daunting', 'task', 'taking', 'massive', 'X-Men', 'mythos', 'evolved', 'decades', 'different', 'comic', 'book', 'titles', 'involved', 'encyclopedic', 'number', 'characters', 'adapting', 'feature', 'film', 'together', 'superb', 'international', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'succeed', 'brilliantly.A', 'prologue', 'set', 'Nazi', 'Holocaust', 'overall', 'serious', 'tone', 'film', 'welcome', 'change', 'increasingly', 'campy', 'ridiculous', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'film', 'franchise', 'Yes', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'plentiful', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'heart', 'film', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'characters', 'who', 'face', 'crises', 'challenges.Professor', 'Xavier', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'off', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'rival', 'mutant', 'leader', 'radically', 'different', 'philosophy', 'Add', 'struggle', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'McCarthyesque', 'mutant-hating', 'U.S.', 'senator', 'have', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'ideological', 'conflict', 'backdrop', 'frequently', 'explosive', 'action', 'overall', 'found', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'lie', 'relationship', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'seemingly', 'indestructible', 'warrior', 'retractable', 'metal', 'claws', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'young', 'mutant', 'ability', 'suck', 'life', 'force', 'others', 'actors', 'excellent', 'performance.The', 'mutants', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'metaphors', 'feared', 'persecuted', 'group', 'human', 'history', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'ability', 'oppressed', 'individuals', 'overcome', 'alienation', 'form', 'supportive', 'communities', 'work', 'greater', 'good', 'believe', 'film', 'success', 'tapping', 'universal', 'human', 'fears', 'hopes', 'ideological', 'conflicts', 'being', 'merely', 'excellent', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'epic']",X-Men VHS

I came away pleasantly impressed.The acting was top-notch. When I heard that Patrick Stewart was to portray Professor Xavier, I had mixed feelings. I had no doubt that he would do an excellent job in the role, but I was concerned that he might end up being an otherwise excellent actor in a lame movie (&aacute; la Sean Connery in &quot;The Avengers&quot;). I was therefore very pleased to watch the movie and find that wasn't the case with X-Men. Stewart gave a stellar performance, opposite the equally excellent Sir Ian McKellen (&quot;Magneto&quot;). Other good performances were put in by the really splendid Hugh Jackman (&quot;Wolverine&quot;), Anna Paquin (&quot;Rogue&quot;), and Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly).Turning a comic book into a movie is a dangerous endeavor (again, look no further than &quot;The Avengers&quot;), but X-Men pulled it off just right. The movie takes itself seriously (but not too seriously), and--from what I've heard--it remains pretty faithful to the existing X-Men story, without alienating the uninitiated. It also makes the viewer think about important issues, such as racism, instead of just being a brainless, explosion-filled, ammo-laden action movie. Yet the action is there, and movie never gets too heavy or preachy on the issues.Visually, X-Men is stunning, featuring some really slick computer animation, particularly Wolverine's claws and the scene where Xavier uses the mind-machine to find Rogue. The sound and music complimented the on-screen action. The plot and the explanations of the characters' backstories were interesting, and left things wide open for a sequel.Overall, X-Men is worth your money.",5,Will Please Comic and Film Fans alike,978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,1833,"['am', 'was-', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'books', '[', 'had', 'complete', 'run', 'January', '1980', 'January', '1995', ']', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'came', 'away', 'pleasantly', 'impressed.The', 'acting', 'was', 'top-notch', 'When', 'heard', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'was', 'portray', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'had', 'doubt', 'would', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'was', 'concerned', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'actor', 'lame', 'movie', 'aacute', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'quot', 'Avengers', 'quot', 'was', 'therefore', 'very', 'pleased', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'X-Men', 'Stewart', 'gave', 'stellar', 'performance', 'opposite', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'quot', 'Magneto', 'quot', 'Other', 'good', 'performances', 'were', 'put', 'really', 'splendid', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'quot', 'Wolverine', 'quot', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'quot', 'Rogue', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Senator', 'Kelly', '.Turning', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'dangerous', 'endeavor', 'again', 'look', 'further', 'quot', 'Avengers', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'pulled', 'off', 'just', 'right', 'movie', 'seriously', 'not', 'too', 'seriously', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'existing', 'X-Men', 'story', 'alienating', 'uninitiated', 'also', 'viewer', 'think', 'important', 'issues', 'such', 'racism', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'brainless', 'explosion-filled', 'ammo-laden', 'action', 'movie', 'action', 'there', 'movie', 'never', 'too', 'heavy', 'preachy', 'issues.Visually', 'X-Men', 'stunning', 'featuring', 'really', 'slick', 'computer', 'animation', 'particularly', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'scene', 'where', 'Xavier', 'mind-machine', 'find', 'Rogue', 'sound', 'music', 'complimented', 'on-screen', 'action', 'plot', 'explanations', 'characters', 'backstories', 'were', 'interesting', 'left', 'things', 'wide', 'open', 'sequel.Overall', 'X-Men', 'money']",X-Men VHS

521603,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00003CX8I,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","The first X-Men movie is an entertaining film but an extremely basic film.  It is definitely not bad, but it is not great either.  I spoiled myself by watching X-Men United first.  After watching that brilliant film a number of times watching this film for the first time felt very underwhelming.  After watching in a number of times after that I came to enjoy the flick.  I also thank the film for helping to open the doors to a long chain of superhero films throughout the 2000s and still going strong.  If it was not for this film or the first Spiderman film, we might not have nearly as many superhero films as we have today let alone great ones.  However, it is still basic superhero film compared to films compared to later movies like X2.Most of the cast does a good job.  I like most of the characters.  The majority of the actors fit their characters perfectly especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart (Professor X).  Famke Janssen does a good Jean Grey and James Marsden does a really good Cyclops.  One thing that this movie does right that the other after it does not is have Cyclops be relevant.  This is the only movie that we get to see Cyclops do anything.Some actors were miscast though.  Anna Paquin does not do a good job as Rogue.  I think she would have been better a Kiddy Pride.  The character of Rogue in this movie is a far cry from the character in the comics and the TV shows.  Rogue is supposed to be a spit-fire.  This Rogue is the complete opposite of that.  Halle Berry does okay as Storm, but there are plenty of people that could have played the role better.The villain Magneto is a great in this film.  He is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen.  McKellen is one of my favorite actors.  He does great in every movie he is in whether the movie is good or bad.  He got the character of Magneto down to a tee.  Magneto is one of the best parts of the film.  I like him because he is not really a full villain but more of an antagonist.  You feel for him and can see where he is coming from.  I even like his ultimate plan in the film.  It is really not that bad of a plan if it wasn't for an unfortunate side effect. The other villains are very one-note and not worth talking about.The score is nothing special.  The fight scenes are well done and entertaining.  The effects are quite good too.

521614,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00003CX8I,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[12, 13]","As most of the world knows by now, X-Men is the live-action version of the of the Marvel comic strip, directed by Bryan Singer (of the Usual Suspects fame). Set in the not too distant future the X-Men are humans who thanks to genetic mutation have inherited special powers. On the surface, having special powers sounds great (you might think) but in X-Men the mutant race is an oppressed and persecuted minority, due to the bigotry, ignorance and fear of much of the non-mutant population. Furthermore an ambitious and influential Senator (Bruce Davison) wants to introduce a registration policy for mutants in an attempt to further restrict their civil rights. In response to this the mutant community is split into two camps led by Professor X, aka Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto, aka Erik Mangus Lensherr (Sir Ian McKellen). Magneto believes in the supremacy of the mutant population, which he is willing to use force to prove, whilst Professor X merely wants, equality, integration and peace. With fundamentally opposing views the two camps are set on a collision course with the future of the human race at stake.X-Men is an entertaining action movie and it has some great fight scenes but it is pitched at its intended mass audience and carefully falls short explicit violence making it pretty much suitable for all but young children. However, although the X Men movie comes from a comic book background and is definitely aimed at a mass audience it also has a message and is a lot more highbrow than most super hero adaptations. X-Men for example opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp with a young Magneto witnessing his mother being shepherded off to the gas chamber and from this it is pretty clear that Director Bryan Singer is deliberately making a point and drawing a comparison. It is also worth noting that at the time of the X Men's creation, back in 1963, among the major political figures in pre civil rights America were Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and it is easy to draw comparisons with Professor X and Magneto. Comparisons can also be drawn between X-Men character Senator Robert Kelly and a certain Senator McCarthy. What is more, X-Men is particularly pertinent at a time when there is so much tabloid speculation and scare mongering with regard to genetic engineering.With X-Men, Director Bryan Singer, a self-confessed fan, has stayed remarkably loyal to the comic books and has served up a commercial but extremely enjoyable film with impressive special effects, which has inevitably spawned a sequel and (in all likelihood) a franchise, which makes me for one very happy. Full of great characters and great performances from the likes of Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine), Anna Pacquin (as Rogue) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey) and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique). However, it is the excellent pairing of the Royal Shakespeare company's McKellen and Stewart opposite each other that really adds gravitas to the proceedings and my only real dissapointments were seeing the excellent and beautiful Halle Berry (as Storm) being under-used and the relatively short running length of 97 minutes.X-Men 2 hits our screens later this year and I for one am really looking forward to it!

Though the casting was fairly good for that one, it was not as good as it could have been.  Plus the fact that it was a character that was hard to like.

Bryan Singer from &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, and &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;.  How was he going to make the move from gritty realism to that of a comic book world?He didn't have to!  As hard as it is for me to beleive, Bryan made a gritty, realistic, comic book movie, and it is great.  With a little help from the casting , and CGI departments, he made an exceptional film.Now we come to the point in the interview where comic fans may be disappointed.  The film does not follow any storyline from the comics, so don't get this expecting &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; or some other story.  It is totally new.

Singer did not just a good job, but an outstanding job with the special effects and the storytelling and such. As far as the acting goes, Patrick Stewart (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") was an excellent choice as Professor Xavier. In fact, I knew that they would pick Stewart for this role. And as for Hugh Jackman (who appeared in 1998's ""Paperback Hero"" prior to doing ""X-Men"") as Logan/Wolverine, Jackman was brilliant! We all know that Hugh Jackman is from Australia, and that ""X-Men"" was his first American production. But when Jackman gets right down to talking in that American accent, he does it with perfection all the way! And that is what makes Jackman the actor that he is today, with lots of charisma and style as well. The supporting cast, including Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique), Tyler Mane (Sabertooth), and Ray Park (Toad) gave great performances as well! The DVD transfer of this was simply amazing! Especially with features like Hugh Jackman's screen test, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, behind the scenes footage, and much more! ""X-Men"" is the best comic book adaption ever made since ""Superman"" and ""Batman""! I cannot wait for the ""X-Men"" sequels to come out!

The last real success was Tim Burton's 'Batman', which is still debatable. Incredibly, it took a non-comic film like 'The Matrix' to elevate standards beyond the schlock that characterizes the 'Batman' series. 'X-Men' meets the difficult standards of portraying characters everyone already knows and walking the fine line of making them realistic without destroying their identities. Doing this while making a film that is its own coherent work while doing justice to the comic series is another fine line to walk. In every way -story, effects, acting, characters- 'X-Men' pulls it off. Beginning with the concentration camp scene was startling, and a stroke of genius; Magneto's depth of character was both well acted by McKellan, and well set by the scenes of demagoguery. By focusing on Wolverine and Rogue to create depth, without burdening the story with every aspect of the heroes, the good-vs-bad struggle does not come across as merely effects-driven eye candy. Leaving enough loose holes at the end to make the story bigger for sequels, one isn't left with a sense that they're going to bastardize the whole concept just to make a buck off of McDonald's Happy Meals, as the 'Batman' series has become.

It's not easy living in the ""not so distant future"" knowing that whenever you touch someone, something bad happens to them (like a friend being in a coma).  Unfortunately, Marie (more commonly known as Rogue) has to live with this mutation.  Unable to live with her mutation, Rogue runs away.  She soon finds herself face-to-face with Logan (Wolverine): a man with incredible healing powers and metal througout his entire circulation system, which gives him his metal claws.  Rogue befriends Wolverine and they set off together.  On the road, they hit a tree in the road and Wolverine goes soaring through the windshiled, leaving Rogue trapped in the car with a fire burning inside.  As Wolverine goes to help Rogue, he is attacked by Sabertooth: a mutant who works for the evil Magneto, a mutant with the ability to bend metal, who is trying to turn all humans into mutants with his machine.  Fortunately, Rogue and Logan are saved by Cyclops (lasers that shoot through his eyes when they open) and Storm (ability to create a storm) and are taken to Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Students (which unknown to the public helps mutants secure their mutations).  Xavier promises to help Logan and Rogue.  But after Rogue flees from the school, Logan defies Xavier and goes to rescue her.  When he finds Rogue, Magneto and his mutants appear.  Magneto kidnaps Rogue and runs off with her.  The X-Men sit down and finally they discover why Magneto wanted Rogue: he is planning to use her power to harness another mutant's power against the world.  He will give her his power, and then she will power his machine which will transform all of the humans to mutants.  There is only one consequence: Rogue will die from the machine.  And after Xavier becomes deathly ill, it's up to the X-Men to save the day.

521635,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00003CX8I,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","Okay, I'm just going to say it:  that prison at the very end is awesome!  I'd sign up to be a superhero just for the chance to send someone to that prison!This film was widely regarded as being the revival of comic book movies, a genre that had lost many fans during the late 1990s.  It's easy to see why.  This film was smart, well-paced, and, while there were good guys and bad guys, nothing was black and white...at least in terms of motives.On the good team are the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier, who is played by Patrick Stewart.  Rather than simply fight for justice and to defeat evil, this team works to control their own powers and show mankind that mutants like them are not a threat.  It's nice to see heroes who, for the most part, do not have a tragic backstory.  It's explained that these heroes' various powers are due to a genetic mutation that people are randomly born with, like the genes that create hair and eye color.Playing for the bad guys is a team that was never really given a name.  They're led by Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto, who is played by Sir Ian McKellen.  This villain does have a tragic backstory, mainly that he is a Holocaust survivor whose parents were killed by the Nazis.  This helps influence his beliefs that humans and mutants can never co-exist and drives him to either eliminate the latter or turn them into the former...he's not that picky.  Actually, he and Professor X were once friends and he helped the professor build his school before their falling out.  While we've seen the plot of friends facing off before (i.e. pretty much every Spider-Man movie ever made), this is a little different.  For one thing, the falling out already happened long before this movie began.  And, despite their differences, these two still respect each other and don't want either to be hurt...it all falls into that gray area I sort-of mentioned before.Entering this conflict is drifter Logan, also known as Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman.  With animal-like senses, super-fast healing powers, and an adamantium skeleton he can't remember having implanted, he winds up at the X-Mansion, where he slowly gets to know the professor and his students and fellow faculty.  While he too isn't wild about Magneto's plans, he'd rather not get involved more than anything else...even though his new friend Rogue, played by Anna Paquin, has different ideas.  Of course, there is the fact that the X-Men did rescue Wolverine from the clutches of Magneto's henchmen.This was a great film, a great start for a film series that's still going strong fourteen years later, and a great revival for a thought-to-be-gone film genre.  I had never read the X-Men comics, but I've seen a couple of the TV shows that have been put out in the late 90s and early 2000s, so I'm not completely oblivious to these guys.  Consequently, I was a bit disappointed by James Marsden's performance as Scott Summers/Cyclops.  Cyclops had always been one of my favorite X-Men, but here, he was pretty bland, his only motivation being to keep his relationship with Jean Grey alive and well and consequently forming a rivalry with Wolverine...kind of boring for a guy who can shoot laser beams out of his eyes.  I found Magneto to be the most interesting and Ian McKellen did an unbelievable job in the role...he's not outright evil, but he has some ideas which, given his youth, aren't entirely unjustifiable.  I especially like when he reminds Xavier that, even if he were not a threat anymore, the problems both men have been combating were still alive and well.  Apart from being a wide-open door for sequels, this is just a great insight into the character's mindset.This is a film for both old and new fans of the X-Men.  Fans of superhero films will definitely enjoy it too.  So will fans of movies in general.  It's no waste of time for anyone.

One of the things that compeled me to buy it was that among the lack-luster superhero collection--Spawn, Batman &amp; Robin--it is a movie that wasn't made for mass merchandising (let's face it, the comic books and toys were already out there waaaay before this movie was even a though in a studio wig's head). This movie was made to have fun, and this is what director Bryan Singer has given us--a good time at the movies.  This is a movie that isn't afraid to make fun of itself, or take itself too serious. Singer made sure of this as the result: the actors gave a better performance, the effects were spectacular, and fans of the comic book were satisfied with it's results.  On a personal note, I think Hugh Jackman is the hottest thing here--nothing says sex appeal like a hunky tough guy that's got razor sharp claws tearing out of his knuckles! Okay, I'm getting off track, but ladies, can you blame me?  The DVD's features include deleted scenes you can access alone or as a second version of the film. It's got animated sequences--a sort of animated storyboard come to life! It also features a Fox Special, which is quite corny but very welcome. And, of course, Hugh Jackman's Screen Test--here he acts out a scene with Anna Paquin and you can see why he got the job.

No. That title still goes to Superman 2 in my opinion. But this movie does show that modern technology can make comic book creations come to life on screen without looking overly garish. From Cyclops optic blasts to Wolverines claws, we get treated with some very nice special effects and pretty good dialogue among the characters. There could have been some definite improvements to the movie such as finding a more realistic lookking wig for Storm or getting an older actor to play Cyclops as Jean looked way too old for him.  As for the dvd, the picture is clean and crips. Definitely a pleasure to view. Extras are pretty sparse with the standard character art, language select, etc. The dvd says that there are ten minutes of extra footage. Let me clarify this. First off, you could play he extra footage by themselves or view them while watching the regular feature. However, the footage isn't exactly cleaned up so it looks out of place and blurry a bit. Also, some footage are the same exact scenes as in the regular feature with some extra dialogue that had been spliced out. So, when you view the footage with the feature you could be seeing the same scenes twice. Another thing..this disc may have problems playing in older dvd players.

521648,A2EW96AE53PZMK,B00003CX8I,Richard De Angelis,"[0, 0]","The X-Men (if you are one of the half dozen or so people who don't already know) are a band of super-powered mutants who appear monthly in a number of titles published by Marvel Comics.  In comparison to many previous made for TV failures and direct to video flops this first major motion picture adaptation of Marvel Comics' characters was very impressive visually and had some nice moments of dialogue as well.The premise of the story (both in the comics and the movie) is that occasionally, in defiance of the normally slow process of evolution, someone is born with a bizarre genetic mutation that gives them powers far beyond those of ""normal"" humans.  These mutants have become the latest in a long series of societal pariahs, feared and hated by an increasingly large segment of the general population.  In the face of persecution from a Joe McCarthy-like Senator, the world's most powerful telepath, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), has set up a special school to help young mutants come to terms with their strange abilities and use them to convince the world that they are not a threat.  His graduate band of do-gooders include telekinetic prodigy Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), optic beam firing Cyclops (James Marsden), and weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry).  To this group are soon added two newcomers: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is equipped with animal-keen senses and reflexes, the ability to heal wounds nearly instantaneously, and a skeleton and claws made of an indestructible metal.  Teenaged Rogue (Anna Paquin) is cursed by a touch that drains the life-force of anyone whose bare skin contacts hers.Along with a hostile public, the X-Men deal with another band of mutants, lead by the master of magnetism, Magneto (Ian McKellen), that is intent on permanently eliminating the threat posed by the prejudice of normal humans.  Magneto's troops include the feral berserker Sabretooth (Tyler Mane); the leaping, prehensile tongue shooting Toad (Ray Park); and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, which totally captures the spirit (if not the letter) of the comic book character.  Other highpoints include the opening scene that explains Magneto's mistrust of humans, the interaction between former friends turned enemies Xavier and Magneto, the friendly rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops, the confrontation between Magneto and the police outside a train station, and the fight scene between Wolverine and Mystique.Unfortunately, the story was not as gripping as it could have been and, with the exception of Anna Paquin's Rogue, all the female characters were given very little screen presence.  Jean Grey and Storm are two of the most powerful mutants in the comic book series, but in the movie they mostly stand around looking pretty and end up getting beaten up and/or having to be rescued. (Of course, what can you expect from a group that calls itself the ""X-MEN"" even though half its members are women?)  Even Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' Mystique (in the BROTHERhood of Mutants) only gets one sentence of dialogue in the whole movie.The 10 minutes of additional footage on the VHS (andDVD) version all add a great deal of characterization to the film, and should never have been cut from the theatrical release.  I only wish that, rather than having them all at the end of the tape, these expurgated scenes had been reinserted into the film.",3,Mutant McCarthyism,982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,3475,"['X-Men', 'are', 'one', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'are', 'band', 'super-powered', 'mutants', 'who', 'appear', 'monthly', 'number', 'titles', 'published', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'comparison', 'many', 'previous', 'made', 'TV', 'failures', 'direct', 'video', 'flops', 'first', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'adaptation', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'characters', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'visually', 'had', 'nice', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'well.The', 'premise', 'story', 'comics', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'defiance', 'normally', 'slow', 'process', 'evolution', 'someone', 'born', 'bizarre', 'genetic', 'mutation', 'powers', 'far', 'normal', 'humans', 'mutants', 'have', 'become', 'latest', 'long', 'series', 'societal', 'pariahs', 'feared', 'hated', 'increasingly', 'large', 'segment', 'general', 'population', 'face', 'persecution', 'Joe', 'McCarthy-like', 'Senator', 'world', 'most', 'powerful', 'telepath', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'set', 'up', 'special', 'school', 'help', 'young', 'mutants', 'come', 'terms', 'strange', 'abilities', 'use', 'convince', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'threat', 'graduate', 'band', 'do-gooders', 'include', 'telekinetic', 'prodigy', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'optic', 'beam', 'firing', 'Cyclops', 'James', 'Marsden', 'weather', 'controlling', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'group', 'are', 'soon', 'added', 'two', 'newcomers', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'equipped', 'animal-keen', 'senses', 'reflexes', 'ability', 'heal', 'wounds', 'nearly', 'instantaneously', 'skeleton', 'claws', 'made', 'indestructible', 'metal', 'Teenaged', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'cursed', 'touch', 'life-force', 'anyone', 'bare', 'skin', 'contacts', 'hers.Along', 'hostile', 'public', 'X-Men', 'deal', 'band', 'mutants', 'lead', 'master', 'magnetism', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'intent', 'permanently', 'eliminating', 'threat', 'posed', 'prejudice', 'normal', 'humans', 'Magneto', 'troops', 'include', 'feral', 'berserker', 'Sabretooth', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'leaping', 'prehensile', 'tongue', 'shooting', 'Toad', 'Ray', 'Park', 'shapeshifting', 'Mystique', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', '.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'portrayal', 'Wolverine', 'totally', 'spirit', 'not', 'letter', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Other', 'highpoints', 'include', 'opening', 'scene', 'Magneto', 'mistrust', 'humans', 'interaction', 'former', 'friends', 'turned', 'enemies', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'friendly', 'rivalry', 'Wolverine', 'Cyclops', 'confrontation', 'Magneto', 'police', 'train', 'station', 'fight', 'scene', 'Wolverine', 'Mystique.Unfortunately', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'gripping', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exception', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'presence', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Storm', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'powerful', 'mutants', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'mostly', 'stand', 'around', 'looking', 'pretty', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'beaten', 'up', 'and/or', 'having', 'be', 'rescued', 'course', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'group', 'X-MEN', 'even', 'members', 'are', 'women', 'Even', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Mystique', 'BROTHERhood', 'Mutants', 'only', 'one', 'sentence', 'dialogue', 'whole', 'movie.The', '10', 'minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'VHS', 'andDVD', 'version', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'characterization', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'release', 'only', 'wish', 'rather', 'having', 'end', 'tape', 'expurgated', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'reinserted', 'film']",X-Men VHS

521650,A1OW7A7HW60ZVV,B00003CX8I,Rich Williams,"[1, 1]","I have heard of The X-Men comic books, but that is as far as it goes.  But that would not seem to matter here.  Actually, I would suggest that the X-MEN is directed at the un-initiated.The setting is the near-future.  Humanity has started it's next stage of evolution and a small percentage are born with &quot;mutations&quot;.  These mutations empower the every day individual with some special ability.There is divide in the general population as to how to respond to these &quot;mutants&quot; with some calling for registration and legal segregation and others calling for integration.  You would be correct in thinking that the thematic point of X-MEN serves as an allegory on racism.  Indeed, the opening sequence depicting the taking of Jews into a Nazi concentration camp delivers the theme effectively.The &quot;hero&quot; of this flick is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has a second metallic skeleton that allows him to shoot razor sharp talons out of his knuckles.  He is introduced to us through Roque(Anna Paquin), a teenage girl whose mutation causes her to take the life-force from another human at a single touch.  Rogue, running scared from her family and friends, teams up with Wolverine who is making a living as a traveling bare-knuckle fighter.  Together, they are rescued from Magneto(Ian McKellen) and his henchmen Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Toad(Ray Parks), and Sabretooth(Tyler Mane) by the X-Men.The X-Men are a team of mutants led by Prof. Charles Francis Xavier(Patrick Stewart).  His objective is to teach mutants to control and respect their powers while educating society on the value of mutants.  The overall aim here is for society to accept and integrate mutants.  His old friend and nemesis, Magneto, believes that in order for mutants to survive, they must fight society.  Xaviers team are: Cyclops(James Marsden) who can shoot fire from his eyes, Storm(Halle Berry) who can control the weather, and Dr. Jean Grey(Famke Janssen) who has telepatic powers.The less experienced Sci-Fi moviegoer may find the detailed stories rather challenging.  The multiple stories and themes that run through this movie are complex yet compelling and - as is always the case with &quot;pack&quot; movies - the viewer is often left feeling that they would have liked to known more about each character.In terms of action, the fight sequences are expertly performed and are very reminiscent of The Phantom Menace's Jedi/Darth Maul fight scene.  Indeed Ray Parks (who played Darth Maul in Episode 1) is given plenty of opportunity to display those same skills again.  The special effects are somewhat muted and serve to enhance the movie rather than to overtake the plot.  I was particularly fond of a scene outside a railway station where Magneto (who can control metal) stops a bullet in front of a policemans forehead and threatens to let it go again.Overall, the X-MEN is a very good movie packed with plenty of story and enough visuals to keep everyone happy.Additionally, I am particularly fond of the the DVD box presentation.  The attractive packaging starts to draw you in before you even watch the movie.

Like any written story that has acquired a huge fan base, a worthy transfer to the screen is difficult to say the least, more so when the players of the story are given visual characterization as in the comic's medium.  If the face doesn't match the comic version the actor has to try doubly hard to win over the fan. In the case of the X-Men, casting has hit the target bull's eye, leaving the actors the luxury of being able to slip into the roles like an old coat. Transition from the page is smooth as silk so the comic fan can take in the film as they would any issue of the mag.  But what of the non-fan? Is the film worth seeing?

ANyone who could create something like The Usual Suspects has to be a genius. No two ways about it. And thus he was tabbed to do the long-awaited film version of the comic book X-Men. And to his credit, he did a wonderful job with what he was given.The story centers mostly around Wolverine (an interestingly-coifed Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who find themselves thrown together and caught in the middle of a longtime battle between old friends Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Wolverine and Rogue, along with Magneto and Xavier, are mutants-- humans with various special powers. Magneto and Xavier run the two cliques of mutants, if you will, and Wolverine and Rogue swear allegiance to neither; they don't have much time to weight their options, though, as the two sides fighting over them attempt to recruit them for a very dastardly deed that Magneto's got going on.A plot that simple would have made for a bang-up two and a half hour action film. Where the writers went wrong was in trying to add too much in the way of subplots, and they ended up with something a lot more confused than it really needed to be. A focus on the humanity of the mutants and the decisions that Wolverine and Rogue need to make would have been enough to fill a film (I mean, come on, the Usual Suspects wasn't all that long on plot, either; all the greatness came from the subtleties within an extremely simple mystery). Still, if looked at somewhat simply, it does work as an action film; there's a good deal of eye candy, stuff blows up, Ray Park does his usual flying-leap-all-over-the-place thing, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen aren't considered two of the greats for nothing, you know.A great way to kill some time, but don't be expecting a whole lot of depth. ***",3,Tried to pack too much into its length,985737600,"03 28, 2001",2001,1865,"['X-Men', 'Bryan', 'Singer', '2000', 'Singer', 'genius', 'pure', 'simple', 'ANyone', 'who', 'could', 'create', 'something', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'be', 'genius', 'two', 'ways', 'thus', 'was', 'tabbed', 'do', 'long-awaited', 'film', 'version', 'comic', 'book', 'X-Men', 'credit', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given.The', 'story', 'centers', 'mostly', 'Wolverine', 'interestingly-coifed', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'find', 'thrown', 'together', 'caught', 'middle', 'longtime', 'battle', 'old', 'friends', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'Magneto', 'Xavier', 'are', 'mutants', 'humans', 'various', 'special', 'powers', 'Magneto', 'Xavier', 'run', 'two', 'cliques', 'mutants', 'will', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'swear', 'allegiance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'weight', 'options', 'though', 'two', 'sides', 'fighting', 'attempt', 'recruit', 'very', 'dastardly', 'deed', 'Magneto', 'got', 'going', 'on.A', 'plot', 'simple', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'bang-up', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'action', 'film', 'Where', 'writers', 'went', 'wrong', 'was', 'trying', 'add', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'subplots', 'ended', 'up', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'confused', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'focus', 'humanity', 'mutants', 'decisions', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'need', 'make', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'fill', 'film', 'mean', 'come', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'long', 'plot', 'either', 'greatness', 'came', 'subtleties', 'extremely', 'simple', 'mystery', 'Still', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'simply', 'work', 'action', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'eye', 'candy', 'stuff', 'up', 'Ray', 'Park', 'usual', 'flying-leap-all-over-the-place', 'thing', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'are', ""n't"", 'considered', 'two', 'greats', 'nothing', 'know.A', 'great', 'way', 'kill', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'depth', '***']",X-Men VHS

Dolph Lungren as the Punisher!!??!! It seems that the only cool comic characters that became movies were Superman, Batman, Blade, MIB, and that cool Hulk TV show with Bill Bixby. But the long overdue  X-Men is about as good as you can get for a comic movie while staying fairly true to the original.Although we see the origins of Magneto and Rogue, the story seems to center around Wolverine (who is no doubt the most popular of the X-Men).  We see how Wolvie survives as a drifter in Canada, unable to remember his past as a military experiment, how he and Rogue meet up with the X-Men and are taken to Xavier's school,where there are cameos by Jubilee,Iceman, and a kid with blue hair (Beast perhaps?), and the X-Men's struggle not only with Magneto and the public who fears them, but with themselves.  The tension between Wolvie and Cyclops is great too.Hugh Jackman is AWESOME as the ol' Canuckle Head (it seems as though he IS Wolvie) and has some of the best lines in the movie.  Cyclops to Logan: &quot;How do we know it's really you?&quot;  Logan: &quot;You're a d--k!!&quot; CLASSIC!!!  Patrick Stewart as Professor X is pretty convincing as well.Comic purists will find fault with the movie, as did sub geeks with U571, war geeks with The Patriot, gun geeks with all the Lethal Weapon movies, and all cops with any Dirty Harry movie.  &quot;The uniforms were different!&quot;  &quot;The air inlet on the Blackbird isnt correct!&quot;  &quot;Where were the Sentinels?&quot; This movie is set up perfectly for a sequel, which will no doubt come soon.Sound is great, picture is great, everything was great!!!",5,"Pretty good, unlike most comics-turned-movies",974851200,"11 22, 2000",2000,1724,"['Remember', 'stinker', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', '70', 'how', 'terrible', 'early', '90', 'Captain', 'America', 'Dolph', 'Lungren', 'Punisher', 'only', 'cool', 'comic', 'characters', 'became', 'movies', 'were', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Blade', 'MIB', 'cool', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'show', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'long', 'overdue', 'X-Men', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'comic', 'movie', 'staying', 'fairly', 'true', 'original.Although', 'see', 'origins', 'Magneto', 'Rogue', 'story', 'center', 'around', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'doubt', 'most', 'popular', 'X-Men', 'see', 'how', 'Wolvie', 'drifter', 'Canada', 'unable', 'remember', 'past', 'military', 'experiment', 'how', 'Rogue', 'meet', 'up', 'X-Men', 'are', 'taken', 'Xavier', 'school', 'where', 'are', 'cameos', 'Jubilee', 'Iceman', 'kid', 'blue', 'hair', 'Beast', 'perhaps', 'X-Men', 'struggle', 'not', 'only', 'Magneto', 'public', 'who', 'tension', 'Wolvie', 'Cyclops', 'great', 'too.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'AWESOME', 'ol', 'Canuckle', 'Head', 'Wolvie', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'Cyclops', 'Logan', 'quot', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'really', 'quot', 'Logan', 'quot', ""'re"", 'd', 'k', 'quot', 'CLASSIC', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Professor', 'X', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'well.Comic', 'purists', 'will', 'find', 'fault', 'movie', 'did', 'sub', 'geeks', 'U571', 'war', 'geeks', 'Patriot', 'gun', 'geeks', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'movies', 'cops', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movie', 'quot', 'uniforms', 'were', 'different', 'quot', 'quot', 'air', 'inlet', 'Blackbird', 'isnt', 'correct', 'quot', 'quot', 'Where', 'were', 'Sentinels', 'quot', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'perfectly', 'sequel', 'will', 'doubt', 'come', 'soon.Sound', 'great', 'picture', 'great', 'everything', 'was', 'great']",X-Men VHS

In other words, this is the movie which &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace&quot; should have been! The director, Bryan Singer, was responsible for &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, which was one of the cleverest movies of the nineties, so it's no surprise that this movie is very enjoyable.

The plot is essentially the essence of the X-Men comics: people who were born different vying for acceptance in a world that fears and hates them, while attempting to stop the ""villain"" from carrying out his evil plot. (I say ""villain"" because I'm not really sure if Magneto counts as a villain, if you get right down to it. He and Professor Xavier are basically two sides of the same coin. But, I digress.) It has generally good acting, with one or two exceptionally excellent or horrid performances, and the script...well, it works, usually. What this movie is, more than anything, is a setup for X2, which is by far the best of the series and (in my opinion) one of the better super hero movies in existence. But this first X-Men movie is a solid effort, and a fun watch, if only because Ian McKellen or Patrick Stewart are in it (for the movie buffs) or because there are explosions (for the action fan).

521661,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CX8I,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","In the world of movies, profundity often creeps up in the most unexpected and unlikely of places.  Let's face it; one does not instinctively turn to the super-hero genre if one is searching for films with great thematic meaning and philosophical depth.  Yet, ""X-Men"" provides just those qualities in the context of a thought provoking, intelligently written and superbly executed tale of ""mutants"" searching for acceptance, tolerance and affirmation in a world filled with frightened and often even hostile inhabitants.Much more than just a mere action film, ""X- Men"" broadens into a study of the effects of prejudice, done in almost allegorical terms.  Often when a theme has become played out through over exposure, it takes a fresh approach to make it come alive again.  Yet another movie chronicling the injustices done to blacks, Native Americans, Jews, gays, the handicapped and a host of other routinely aggrieved groups probably would not have the same impact as this film does.  By creating an entirely fictional group to serve as the target of intolerance, the filmmakers allow us see the issue from a novel perspective, stripped down to its barest essentials as it were.  Since none of us brings to the film an innate prejudice against a group that doesn't exist in real life, we are all free to see the irrationality, fear and idiocy that serve as the basis for bigotry in any of its forms.  How many movies of any genre can one say THAT about?The film begins, appropriately, with a scene recreating a factual example of bigotry in one of its most recent and darkest forms - as a family of Jews in 1944 Poland is marched to its doom in a Nazi concentration camp.  We discover later on that the young lad has survived the experience and that he is actually one of the first of a new breed of ""mutants"" being caused by a sudden leap in the human evolutionary cycle.  It seems that these mutants begin manifesting their various differences around the time of puberty, and that as the 21st Century progresses and more and more of these special people begin to reveal themselves, the world finds itself grappling with the issue of whether or not they should be denied equal rights and equal citizenship and even whether or not they should be allowed to remain integrated with the rest of society.  In many ways, I imagine that this film speaks with particular significance to the gay community, since in contemporary terms, that seems to be the group most often targeted with the kind of ignorant, vitriolic claptrap we hear coming from the outraged ""normal"" citizens and opportunistic politicians in the film.  The X-Men are a group of mutants (women included, by the way) with super-human powers whose twofold mission it is to prevent the world's lawmakers from passing legislation against them and to simultaneously fight off some renegade mutants who have decided to take matters into their own, less diplomatic hands.  Kudos to writer David Hayder and director Bryan Singer for daring to explore such a profound theme in such an entertaining format.For make no mistake about it:  ""X-Men,"" for all its profundity and thematic richness, is, first and foremost, a stylish and enthralling comic book action thriller.  Even though the mutant heroes are essentially two-dimensional characters, at least they don't undercut the seriousness of their purpose by indulging in the customary wisecracking, adolescent antics that have diminished so many earlier super hero characters in previous films of this nature.  Most impressive is that the ""villain"" possesses not only a credible motive for his actions, but even the seeds of some long dormant goodness that allow for the possibility of his redemption somewhere down the road.  (And it is indeed obvious that this film provides a dandy setup for a potentially lucrative series of films to follow).  The first-rate action stunt sequences and state-of-the-art special effects contribute greatly to the entertainment level of the film.  Of the actors, the standout is Patrick Stewart who, as the mutant dedicated to building a bridge of tolerance and understanding between the mutants and the outside world, brings just the right note of comforting civility and rationality to the role.Yet, for all its technical virtues as an action film, it is the depth and breadth of its vision that separates ""X-Men"" from so many other films of its genre and makes it truly worthwhile viewing.

The story was kept very simple and did not try to over explain itself or over work itself. A few things were left out or changed from the comics but ultimately they are changes I can live with. I am referring to things like Wolverine &amp; Sabertooth not knowing each other that fact that Rouge and Jubilee were more or less morphed into one character.  I loved the inside jokes (the students), the Easter Eggs on the DVD are great!  Especially the outtake with an unexpected visitor.  :)  I won't spoil the surprise if you don't know, but all you have to do is go to the TV Spots part and highlight the rose and OK it or whatever, let 'er rip.  I about busted a gut let me tell you. The other Easter Egg is the in the Art Gallery and displays artwork for characters not used in this movie, but perhaps the sequel. I can say enough about it, Patrick Stewart man, that's a whole conversation right there.  He NAILED Professor X in my mind.  Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, in fact, I think all the actors pretty much nailed there characters. I think the reason I like it so much was like I said it was kept simple.  They didn't try and do too much, and you weren't bombared with all this information that only really makes sense to fans like me.  Outstanding!!  I cannot WAIT for the sequel, Bryan Singer's back on board and as far as I know, all the actors have said yes to one.  The seriousness is another factor.  I mean, the story, for being so out there is treated very seriously.  No goofy off the wall crap.  Oh, BTW, the deleted scenes aren't all that, but they rarely are (hence why they were cut out of the film) but there is one between Jean Grey and Professor X while they're talking about Wolverine that I liked quite a bit.  Still it didn't hurt the movie and kept the pace up.  Rent this movie and then when you can't stand it BUY IT! I saw this movie on opening and day and was waiting for the DVD with baited breath and was not disappointed at all.

521669,ASRUV1OYTKB4,B00003CX8I,Sanjiv Sarwate,"[1, 1]","Comic book adaptations have a decidedly mixed history, ranging from groundbreaking (e.g. the first Superman) to abysmal (e.g. &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;).  Movies which try to split the focus among too many characters have fared even worse.  (e.g. the last three Batman movies).  X-Men, going in, was therefore running against long odds.X-Men is not as good as the first Superman, but that isn't a strike against it.  The first Superman had the advantage of one hero, one villain, and a mythology ingrained in popular consciousness.  However, X-Men certainly far exceeds most of the comic adaptations out there.  Though some have criticized the focus on four characters (Wolverine, Rogue, Magneto and Professor X), a film that tried to flesh out everyone would end up pleasing no one.  The focus was also appropriate because Paquin, McKellen and Stewart clearly have acting chops and bring depth to their performances.  The real surprise was newcomer Jackman, who fully occupies his role as the feral Wolverine.  Wolverine is, for most fans (myself included) the character on who this film would live or die, and Jackman more than lived up to the challenge.  The script, though somewhat thin, did make the right calls overall on what to accept and what to reject in the mythology.  The villain's master plan was a little contrived, but the same could be said of Lex Luthor's master plan in the first &quot;Superman&quot; movie.&quot;X-Men&quot; is not a deep film and won't show up in the major awards at the Oscars, but it was a very entertaining film that brought the comic book to life.  The big mistake now would be to accede to fan demands for more characters.

The special effects &amp; are done well (without copying 'The Matrix'!!), and the movie didn't stray too far from the comic's essence.The 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound is excellent, so your stereo will get a work out!!I enjoyed seeing characters I knew (Storm, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Prof.X, Magneto, Cyclops, etc.), and the film laid the groundwork for future movie sequels by giving brief introductions to 'young mutants' like Bobby Blake (the future 'Iceman', and others with special gifts!!).SEQUEL?? You can bet on it!!!If you are familiar with the X-Men, you should be satisfied with this DVD, but the movie failed to introduce or speak of the other ORIGINAL X-Men (The Beast,and the Angel to be exact), but the script works well.**Now, as for the BONUS FEATURES, they aren't top notch at all.After being treated with 'TOP LEVEL' bonus features in the new Terminator 2 DVD &amp; the Independance Day DVDs, the X-Men DVD serves up average stuff.~The extra 10 minutes of scenes should not have been clipped to begin with.What's an extra 10 minutes going to matter ??~The interview with Bryan Singer was annoying!! Not because of Bryan, but because it is chopped into 6 or 7 '2 minute' segments!! Why not show the entire interview in one segment ??~The 'Mutant Watch' News Parody is great, and it's actors overdo it at times, but it's a fun segment.Other bonuses include photo stills, and that's fine too.In short, this DVD would make a nice addition to your collection!!...",4,Great movie!!

On the other hand, they really messed up on the casting of certain characters (read: Storm), and the storyline for others (Rogue is supposed to start out as evil!).  Although I think David Hayter's script (and his other work as the voice of Solid Snake) are cool, there's really no denying that this is the same crap Hollywood always puts out.  Honestly, the fight scenes were really just special effects showcases, and I really would have liked to see more character development.

Fox put X-Men on the fast-track, essentially axing a full six months of post-production work, so the company could have a big summer film.  The fact that Singer and company were able to put together a film as wondrous as this one is X-traordinary enough.  But what is truly X-asperating is the fact that if it hadn't been so rushed, we would have hade an infinitely more pleasing end product.Well, it would seem FOX did the same thing to us with the DVD version.

While there were changes made for the screen, most of them were for the worst. In the comics the X-men had tight, character driven stories, the screenplay for this movie is juat a bunch of jumbled scenes thrown together. While there are some good casting moves (Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian Mckellen are wonderful in their roles) we rarely get to see ANY OF THE CAST DO ANYTHING  EXCEPT pot and spout cliches with the exception of Hugh Jackman who gets way too much screen time. Characters we've all grown to care about-Cyclops(underused), Storm(who has an on again off again African accent), Rogue(too young) and Jean Grey(wooden) have nonexistent roles. The villans are also pretty useless in this movie too. Mystique has no story, sabretooth no personality and toad is just a spit and tongue gimmick. The years of depth and caracter development of the comic characters are sacrificed for the sake of idiotic stunts and special effects.

521678,A2RL9JHYNEJ1QR,B00003CX8I,"SH in Tampa ""SPH""","[0, 0]","The X men is a widely popular serial comic that has been around for years.  This film brings the comic to life on the big screen with the story of how the four X men, mutants with special physical powers, are brought together to help mankind under the kindly guidance of Professor X.  They do this against the backdrop of reactionary America, which does not understand their mutations and fears their powers.  Faced off against the X men is the Brotherhood of Mutants, lead by Magneto who wants to make humans an extinct link in the evolutionary chain.Although I am not a big comic series fan, I watched this film with a group of die hard X men fans.  Each of them badly wanted this film to be fantastic and were a little disappointed.  Although I'll bet they would have rated it higher than a two, it certainly wouldn't have been a five for any of them.  If you are not a fan of the series, the X men movie has some interesting special effects and does not require knowledge of the comic books to understand the plot.However, because the movie had to play to both fans and non fans, I believe some of the depth in the characters were lost.  The shallow treatment of all the characters other than Wolverine, coupled with very weak performances from Halle Berry (Storm), served to blunt the intensity necessary for any action movie.  Fortunately, the on screen chemistry between Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Famke Janssen (Dr. Gray) helped interject some humor into the film and Jackman's performance through out the film is strong.Out of all the villans that have graced the pages of the X men, I wish that they had chosen more interesting ones than Toad and Sabertooth.  Sabertooth is just a WCW wrestling character without any particularly impressive powers and the Toad character was a tad silly.  Mystique was the only truly interesting bad guy (bad person?) and has one of the best special effects scenes in the movie as she transforms in mid kick.  Finally, Ian McKellan does a great job as an arch villain, so why dress him up in a silly looking cap?There were some interesting special effects in this show but I think that bad directing also blunted some of their impact.  The pace of the film is slightly off and never develops a really real adrenaline rush that it could have inspired.  The fight scenes are particularly weak, I wish that they had spent more time teaching the actors how to fight and then found more exciting ways to show the fights - they should have been realistic (ala Matrix) versus the WWF wrestling (aka fake) style used in the film.The DVD extras are terrible.  Besides a few rather interesting easter eggs, the deleted scenes add nothing to the movie (unless you want to hear Halle Berry with the worst fake accent since Kevin Costner tried to be english in Robin Hood).  The mutant watch special is just an extended commerical for a film you have already seen.Finally, the DVD sound quality is ok but the picture quality is not great.  In a couple of places, the DVD pauses longer than it should and in one or two places, there is visible image distortion that it not an intentional special effect.Overall, this movie was ok but given the material it should have been fantastic.",3,It's fans deserved better,975888000,"12 4, 2000",2000,3214,"['X', 'men', 'widely', 'popular', 'serial', 'comic', 'been', 'years', 'film', 'comic', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'story', 'how', 'four', 'X', 'men', 'mutants', 'special', 'physical', 'powers', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'help', 'mankind', 'kindly', 'guidance', 'Professor', 'X', 'do', 'backdrop', 'reactionary', 'America', 'not', 'understand', 'mutations', 'fears', 'powers', 'Faced', 'off', 'X', 'men', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutants', 'lead', 'Magneto', 'who', 'make', 'humans', 'extinct', 'link', 'evolutionary', 'chain.Although', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'comic', 'series', 'fan', 'watched', 'film', 'group', 'die', 'hard', 'X', 'men', 'fans', 'badly', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'fantastic', 'were', 'little', 'disappointed', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'two', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'five', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'series', 'X', 'men', 'movie', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'require', 'knowledge', 'comic', 'books', 'understand', 'plot.However', 'movie', 'had', 'play', 'fans', 'non', 'fans', 'believe', 'depth', 'characters', 'were', 'lost', 'shallow', 'treatment', 'characters', 'other', 'Wolverine', 'coupled', 'very', 'weak', 'performances', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'served', 'blunt', 'intensity', 'necessary', 'action', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Dr.', 'Gray', 'helped', 'interject', 'humor', 'film', 'Jackman', 'performance', 'film', 'strong.Out', 'villans', 'have', 'graced', 'pages', 'X', 'men', 'wish', 'had', 'chosen', 'more', 'interesting', 'ones', 'Toad', 'Sabertooth', 'Sabertooth', 'just', 'WCW', 'wrestling', 'character', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'powers', 'Toad', 'character', 'was', 'tad', 'silly', 'Mystique', 'was', 'only', 'truly', 'interesting', 'bad', 'guy', 'bad', 'person', 'one', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'scenes', 'movie', 'mid', 'kick', 'Finally', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'great', 'job', 'arch', 'villain', 'so', 'why', 'dress', 'up', 'silly', 'looking', 'cap', 'were', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'think', 'bad', 'directing', 'also', 'blunted', 'impact', 'pace', 'film', 'slightly', 'never', 'really', 'real', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'could', 'have', 'inspired', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'weak', 'wish', 'had', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'teaching', 'actors', 'how', 'fight', 'then', 'found', 'more', 'exciting', 'ways', 'show', 'fights', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'realistic', 'ala', 'Matrix', 'WWF', 'wrestling', 'aka', 'fake', 'style', 'used', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'terrible', 'few', 'rather', 'interesting', 'easter', 'eggs', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'add', 'nothing', 'movie', 'want', 'hear', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'worst', 'fake', 'accent', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'tried', 'be', 'english', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'mutant', 'watch', 'special', 'just', 'extended', 'commerical', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'seen.Finally', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', 'ok', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'couple', 'places', 'DVD', 'longer', 'should', 'one', 'two', 'places', 'visible', 'image', 'distortion', 'not', 'intentional', 'special', 'effect.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'given', 'material', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic']",X-Men VHS

However, after purchasing the video and watching it several times I realized that there were several subtleties in the plot that I simply did not catch on that single viewing.  The movie seems to grow on me and gets better with each viewing.Sure there are places where the action could look a little more realistic (such as when Sabre Tooth goes flying through the air in a perfectly horizontal path after Storm zaps him with a bolt of lightning in the train station scene.)  But then again, immediately after that we see a man jumping around like a Toad and we are reminded that the film was not intended to impress us with its documentary-like realism -- it is supposed to entertain us.

521680,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B00003CX8I,S J Buck,"[1, 1]","X-Men is the best comic strip adaptation I've seen to date. It has all the excitement and special effects that you'd expect, together with a class of acting that you don't see in many other films of this type.The story concerns the two factions of the X-Men. X-Men are mutations from normal humans. One is lead by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the other by Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen). Xavier believes the X-Men can work with humans. Magneto wants to destroy humanity and in a brilliant opening scene (shot in black & white) set during the 2nd world war we see he has some justification for this view. Patrick Stewart and in particular Ian McKellan are the main reasons to see this film. They add a certain gravitas to the proceedings that takes the movie to a different level.

If you never even knew that there was a X-Men comic book, you will really enjoy this movie.  Going in, I was worried about how this flick was going to be handled.  There have been so many stories surrounding these characters.  THey have died too many times to count, been to other planets, dimensions, even times in history.  Yet, there is a tremendous amount about some of them that had never been addressed.  Naturally there are plenty of pieces that any quasi-fan could point out.  Toad and Mystique's fighting ability, Wolverine/Logan's lack of that berserk edge and a couple of changes to Rouge's character all depart from the long history in the books, yet I find all of this acceptable.  Remember X-Fans, to make this flick, it had to be understandable to all, to have a mass appeal to justify more X-Movies.  I feel numerous little 'inside' jokes are there for us.  I was the only one in the theatre to get the &quot;yellow spandex&quot; joke.

521682,A1VGVMUOI5FHTE,B00003CX8I,"""snootchiebootchies""","[1, 2]","I should first admit that I was a big fan of &quot;X-Men&quot; comics as a youth, especially during the Chris Claremont / John Byrne collaboration era in the early 1980's.  I collected those monthly issues religiously, even though my weekly allowance of a measly dollar a week made comic book collecting nearly beyond my means.  So it is likely that my opinion of this film adaptation may be more than a little biased.  With that acknowledgement out of the way, I want to say that &quot;X-Men&quot; is easily the best movie adaptation of a superhero comic book that I've ever seen.  Before seeing it, I, like all the other fans of the comic book, was wary about how accurately the characters will be portrayed.  We have really no reason to trust Hollywood to be faithful to the original comic book considering their incompetence in previous similar efforts.  Man, I still can't believe Superman took Lois to the Fortress of Solitude and that Batman revealed his identity to some stupid girl, even if she happens to be Kim Basinger.  However, I had no such complaints about how the X-Men were translated onto the screen, and in fact, fans of the comic book will be hard pressed to come up with any significant differences between the movie versions of Professor X and Wolverine and their comic book counterparts.  I am especially delighted that the filmmakers decided to retain the moral grayness of Wolverine and his lack of compunction over the act of killing.  I also liked how many of the plot elements were left unresolved, because it means that a sequel will surely follow.  Another likely bonus for X-Men fans in the upcoming sequel is the appearance of Kitty Pride and Iceman, who were both briefly introduced as young students at Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted.  In an effort to be objective, I will admit that the story did suffer from excessive expository dialogue and unnecessary scenes that appeared to have been inserted only to serve as descriptions of the respective capabilities of each mutant.  But heck, that just means the sequel will be even better since the writers will only need to concentrate on the story.  Overall, this movie will make you forget the real world for 90 minutes and will make kids wish they could squeeze into a microwave oven in order to mutate themselves.",4,One of the best movie adaptation of a comic book.

If you think this is going to be a glowing review, you're DARN STRAIGHT!My expectations where off the charts for this movie.  I hate when I do that 'cause I usually get let down.  NOT IN THIS CASE!  IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.  Everything was great about this movie.  The characters, the effects, and especially the story line.  It stayed true to everything I know about the X-Men, which isn't as much as some, and Wolverine, which I know quite a bit about.  What can I say I'm a bit of a Fan-Boy.  Heck I have a tatoo of Spider-Man on my arm.  By the way, if they screw up that movie, I'm gonna be pissed!The story revolves around Logan, or Wolverine, as he likes to be called, when he first comes in contact with the other mutants, or X-Men at Prof. Xaviers school for gifted youngsters.  He's a rebel. A cigar smokin', beer drinkin' , out of control SOB.But he is as cool as hell.  He has a metal skeleton, and metal claws that prorude from his knuckles when he gets pissed, and has to hurt someone.He is a wild man but, he has a soft side.  I don't want to get into it too much cause I don't want to give any of the movie away, so that's all I'm going to say about the plot.James Marsden does a great job of playing Cyclops, as do the rest of the cast in their roles.Here is a list.Femke Jansen.......................Jean GreyHal Berry................................StormAnna Paquin...........................RougePatrick Stewart........................Professor XSir Ian McKellan......................MagnetoTaylor Dane.............................SabertoothRay Park..................................ToadRebecca Romaijn Stamos........MystiqueBut the actor who is going to get the most attention from this movie is Hugh Jackman who plays Wolverine.  This guy was pretty much an unkownbut he played this part perfectly.  Just enough insanity along with heart.  He was Wolverine.Doug Ray Scott was supposed to do this part, but he had to do another little summer movie, which by the way is going to be crushed by X-Men, called Mission Impossible 2.  Which I won't see until it comes out on video, because car chases just don't thrill me that much.  He is going to be kicking himself for doing that instead of X-Men.It's only Sunday, and the totals are already up to 57million.  So they probably haven't even confirmed what it made today.The reason it's doing so well is not because of the F/X, it's because they actually, finally did a comic book movie right.They made the characters so you cared about what happened to them, and it wasn't just a bunch of senseless F/X.The two sides were actually fighting for something they believed in.  I WANT TO BE WOLVERINE!I'm going nuts I have to end this review.THE GOODI can't say enough good about this.  It's a great film you can take your whole family to see, and everyone from kids to adults will love it.THE BADYeah right!THE BOTTOM LINEIf you only see one film this summer, seriously, make this the one you see.  And see it more than once.  You'll enjoy the second time even more.

521688,A37F8W82A1E6L7,B00003CX8I,Stephen Cords,"[2, 2]","I am a geek, however I do not bite the heads off chickens at local fairs.  The term has come to encompass quite a few meanings over the years.  In high schools it is used to describe academically inclined individuals with a slight build or those that fall outside of the &quot;in crowd&quot;.  In my time I have come to embrace these people as my own.  We are generally more interesting than the musclebound idiots that made our lives hell for those formative four years.  I don't hold grudges though.  I have actually come to appreciate the lessons I learned as a young geek.  I learned how to think myself out of uncomfortable and sometimes even dangerous situations.  I learned to use those things that seperated me from the mainstream to my advantage.  These qualities became the definition of my being all those years ago and have developed into the talents I have come to love and appreciate above all of my other attributes.  I also enjoy films with lots of action, humor and things getting blown up.  If this sounds at all like you; you too will love the X-Men.This film deals with the core characters that even those who have just seen the Fox saturday morning cartoon will recognize. Storm, Rogue, Cyclops, Professor X, Jean Grey and of course... Wolverine.  Hardcore fans will undoubtedly miss their own favorite mutants, but I feel that Bryan Singer selected the best characters for the story and uses them, and their powers, beautifully.Singer also realizes that the measure of heroes are the villains that they have to deal with.  Magneto and his league of evil mutants are sketched broadly, but with enough attention to the details to make them come alive and even seem sympathetic.  Fans of the comics will pick up on some very subtle nuances that Singer placed there for us while those new to the Mutantverse will enjoy the action and (very) cool effects.The performances are dead on with Hugh Jackman standing out above and beyond everyone's expectations.  The long and short of it is that he just became Wolverine.  There were stories relayed from the set that he got so into his character that at one point he had actually sustained an injury while suspended in a harness and wasn't helped down for quite a while because no one knew he was actually hurt.  I am really looking forward to seeing him in other roles in the future.The script was a little loose with some cheesey dialogue at times; but this is a comic book movie.  Some of that has to be expected.  Being the first film in the series the requisite broad strokes are there to set up the remaining flicks in the series.  I have to say that this was a far better set up than Phantom Menace.  If only Halle Berry had never asked &quot;Do you know what happens to a toad that gets hit by lightning?&quot;  The movie would have been perfect.The suplements listed seem interesting and will include a &quot;documentary&quot; that was shown on Fox detailing Senator Kelley's political views on how to deal with the &quot;mutant menace&quot; as well as other nice little goodies.

The only disappointing points in the film were: Rogue-a teenager? and no Jubilee! Other than that, the movie was fantastic. My favorite mutant, aside from Jubliee, is Storm (played beautifully by the stunning Halle Berry) the mutant with the ability to control mother nature. My favorite scenes are the train station scene and the battle inside the Statue of Liberty. When Sabretooth thinks he has defeated Storm by grabbing her throat and slamming her against the window, she turns the tables on him and kicks his [butt]. She summons the fierce lightening and blows him back threw a concrete wall. WAY TO GO! The other scene which is almost haunting is when she is fighting Toad and he kicks her down an elevator shaft (notice how he does his Darth Maul move afterwards, hence Toad is played by Ray Park). Then all of a sudden the doors to the elevator start to shake and glow with lightening. Then the doors blow open and the STORM ARISES out of the shaft. See the movie and find out what happens.I would not have picked a better person to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart. He is an amazing actor. Another mistake was Ian McKellan playing Magneto. It looked like my grandfather was in the film. They could have expanded Cyclops and Jean Grey a little more. I have never been a fan of Wolverine, until this movie.

In &quot;X-Men&quot; the world is experiencing a strange mutant phenomenon.  These mutants are so feared that a conservative senator (Bruce Davison) is trying to pass a bill for mutant registration.  The theme of the movie (and comic book) is that mutants are just like regular people, in fact most of them don't even want their strange abilities.  That leads to the film's central conflict; there are two groups of mutants, one good and one evil.  The good mutants are of course the &quot;X-Men&quot; led by Professor X and the evil mutants are led by Magneto.  Magneto and his &quot;Brotherhood of Mutants&quot; have been so mistreated by society that they have taken upon themselves to &quot;mutate&quot; the human race.One of the areas where this film succeeds is creating a world realistic enough for these mutants to be believable, it takes the same approach that the first &quot;Superman&quot; film did.  Instead of populating his world with fantastic sets and costumes, director Bryan Singer emphasizes on the fantastic characters and makes them people.  The X-Men behave just like people in the real world.  They work well together, then some like the Wolverine and Cyclops dislike eachother very much, in fact they both compete for the affections of the lovely Jean Grey.  The humanity of the comic characters doesn't stop with the X-Men.  In fact the villian of the movie, Magneto, had such a horrific childhood that you could almost understand his distrust for non-mutants. It's through these touches that &quot;X-Men&quot; reveals itself to be far deeper than the usual summer blockbuster.Most of the story concerns the initiation of the wayward mutants Wolverine and Rogue into the X-Men and their struggle to adapt to mutant society.  The X-Men soon battle Magneto and his Brotherhood hoping to stop him from destroying the human race.Although more serious than other comic-book films, &quot;X-Men&quot; still manages to be quite fun and entertaining. It is full of great suprises, action, visual effects, a good chuckle here and there, and of course black jump suits.  This is a super hero movie after all.  If there is anything strange about the film it's in the way film abrupty ends.

It seems so easy to make a comic book into a movie. Comic books use frames and shots and the storyboards are already there, just adapt. Yet when they get to the screen, the tights look silly, the villains aren't what you expect and the whole thing seems to be an origin story even if you are familiar with these characters from long back.This movie could have been horrible. There are so many characters in the comic book that the origin portion of the movie could have rivaled the original Superman for tedium. The cliched storyline running through the comic book has the theme of ""oppression is wrong"".This movie gets it right by focusing on Wolverine and Rogue. Already the two most interesting characters in the comic, these are the ones you want to watch anyhow. Preserving the Wolverine loves Jean Grey and hates Cyclops storyline from early X-men helps to drive the story along. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are the best distinguished actors in Hollywood now that John Gielgud is dead. And there is a real plotline. Sure, it sufferes from the action movie problem of random bits thrown in for no reason, but you feel like someone actually sat down and wrote this. As opposed to most Batman movies where you think that a bunch of producers sat on the set yelling things at the director to do.Of course there are problems and no comic book fan is going to love a comic book movie unconditionally. Sabretooth is supposed to be Wolverine's bigger and meaner double, but since they  hired a pro wrestler (and not a very talkative one) they didn't give him anything but a lot of grunts. Ray Park is a great martial artist which you can tell from his too-few-scenes. And a lot of the other X Men are just sort of there.But still this is a fun movie and one that almost takes the bad taste of eitehr Punisher or Captain America out for only a moment.",4,Yay!

Let's face it, there are enough X-Men out there to dedicate at least thirty movies to. Concentrating on these specific characters was the only way to make the movie work. Who really cares that Rogue doesn't have the powers she absorbed from Ms. Marvel when she was a villain and Mystiques young charge? Some things had to change to make this movie work and they did what they had to. Upset? then read the comics and leave the rest of us better adjusted types (i.e. those of us who have actually dated people and moved out of our parents basement into homes/apartments of our own)alone. I couldn't think of anyone better suited to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart. He is a great actor. I saw him on Broadway doing his one man show of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol in '95 and I knew then he was far more than Jean-Luc Picard. This man is a great actor with lots of range. Don't believe me? Check out &quot;Jeffrey&quot; for some amazing work by him. But I digress. He was great in this as was Hugh Jackman. I was a little disappointed in Halle Berry as Storm though. I didn't feel she had hit upon the spirit of the character.Here's an interesting tidbit I stumbled across: during part of the production Joss Whedon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame was brought on board to do a little work on the script. He admits to writing both the best and the worst line in the movie. I'll leave it up to the viewer to figure out which lines they are.

521720,A16688KNH19Z1D,B00003CX8I,Ultraman,"[1, 1]","As far as big screen adaptations of comic books go, so many in the past have come up short, such is not the case with Fox's 2000 release of &quot;X-Men.&quot; Besides the first &quot;Batman&quot; film, &quot;X-Men&quot; is the best film adaptation of a successful comic book series. It works in all the right ways, ways in which past Marvel Comics features have failed, i.e. &quot;Captain America,&quot; &quot;The Punisher,&quot; and the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; television show.First of all, they got a budget and a studio with some money. In order to do the X-Men justice, as is the same for any comic book come-to-life, there is a need for big bucks to pull the special effects off and create a believable world in which these characters live.Second, they got an excellent motion picture director behind the project, Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil). Instead of a monkey that could hold a camera to direct, they got someone with an eye for the feel of how the X-Men should come to the screen.Third, and one of the most important points, they stayed true to the characters. Sure, some things were changed around (like the absence of Beast, Iceman as a teenager, and Rogue taking on a younger role as the Kitty Pride/Jubilee part), but the characters as a whole remained honest to the ones that die hard fans have loved for 30-plus years. I myself read the multiple X-Men series for years and found that the slight changes were not nearly enough for me to enjoy this film any less than I did. Sure, the costumes were modified, but wouldn't yellow spandex have looked a little odd?Those in charge of casting did an excellent job, as well. Since filming on &quot;Mission: Impossible 2&quot; ran late, Dougray Scott had to leave the role of Wolverine, which went to Hugh Jackman, who did a terrific job. Had this movie been made 15 years ago or so, I personally think Mel Gibson would have made a perfect Wolverine, back during his crazy days, fresh from &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; and the first &quot;Lethal Weapon.&quot; However, the special effects would have suffered and it was very worth the wait. Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Tyler Mane, Bruce Davison, and, yes, even Halle Berry were all good choices in their roles, as well. The only thing I might have changed would have been Charlize Theron as Rogue (she had a pretty convincing accent as a Southern Belle in &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;) in place of Anna Paquin, but that's just a minor detail.I look forward to the future; the establishment of a successful and excellently produced series has been made with &quot;X-Men.&quot; The actors and director have been signed, or are now in talks to sign on, for the coming sequel(s).I loved reading the comics and I loved seeing those heroes I had only read about finally take their place on the silver screen, in such gallant fashion.

There also were many quotes and moments that become even better, if you know the comic. I don't think it is a good idea to make movies out of comic books but this time and with one or two Tim Burton movies, too, it worked very well. Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are absolute convincing, justifying every modification made on the character. Even ruce Davison was great and let no doubt about the sincerity of his action occur. The only thing that bothered me a little was that - at least in the german dubbed version of the film - small touch of &quot;arrogant right hand&quot; put onto Cyclops but here, too, I think fans of the comic book now better. Although he always said to be no fan of the comic, Bryan Singer seemed to have made a film full of love for the material making that over the top characters like Magneto or Sabretooth appear serious and true. &quot;X-Men&quot; stands way above the usual superhero flicks in character and plot development but also doesn't try to look more real through cutting superpowers to a more realistic level. And for the visual expressiveness, seeing someone carrying a tray with glasses of champaign in Wolverine's dream or Professor Xavier graciously standing up from a chair inside Kelly's memories are just two little details of many, where the action movie grows to be art. I surely can't wait to see Beast or Gambit in action but for a sequel it would also be an idea to concentrate more on the characters that are standing on the side line in the first movie like Storm or Cyclops. After all &quot;X-Men&quot; is a great piece of film, fun to watch and almost flawless in portraying some of the greatest comic heroes of all times and lets recent superhero flicks like &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; look even more hollow than they already are. I hope, their will be more films like &quot;X-Men&quot; in the future but I also hope, that Marvel understands that there is a big difference between the movies and the comic books and don't repeat the mistake of letting a film change an already existing comic like they did with &quot;Blade&quot;.",5,Not only for X-Men Fans...,977702400,"12 25, 2000",2000,2185,"['was', 'stunned', 'how', 'serious', 'film', 'brought', 'comic', 'life', 'also', 'were', 'many', 'quotes', 'moments', 'become', 'even', 'better', 'know', 'comic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'movies', 'comic', 'books', 'time', 'one', 'two', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movies', 'too', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'are', 'absolute', 'convincing', 'justifying', 'modification', 'made', 'character', 'Even', 'ruce', 'Davison', 'was', 'great', 'let', 'doubt', 'sincerity', 'action', 'occur', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'little', 'was', 'least', 'german', 'dubbed', 'version', 'film', 'small', 'touch', 'quot', 'arrogant', 'right', 'hand', 'quot', 'put', 'Cyclops', 'here', 'too', 'think', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'now', 'better', 'always', 'said', 'be', 'fan', 'comic', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'seemed', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'full', 'love', 'material', 'making', 'top', 'characters', 'Magneto', 'Sabretooth', 'appear', 'serious', 'true', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'way', 'usual', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'also', ""n't"", 'try', 'look', 'more', 'real', 'cutting', 'superpowers', 'more', 'realistic', 'level', 'visual', 'expressiveness', 'seeing', 'someone', 'carrying', 'tray', 'glasses', 'champaign', 'Wolverine', 'dream', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'graciously', 'standing', 'up', 'chair', 'Kelly', 'memories', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'little', 'details', 'many', 'where', 'action', 'movie', 'be', 'art', 'surely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Beast', 'Gambit', 'action', 'sequel', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'idea', 'concentrate', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'standing', 'side', 'line', 'first', 'movie', 'Storm', 'Cyclops', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'great', 'piece', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'almost', 'flawless', 'portraying', 'greatest', 'comic', 'heroes', 'times', 'lets', 'recent', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'quot', 'Batman', 'amp', 'Robin', 'quot', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'hollow', 'already', 'are', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'films', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'future', 'also', 'hope', 'Marvel', 'big', 'difference', 'movies', 'comic', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'mistake', 'letting', 'film', 'change', 'already', 'existing', 'comic', 'did', 'quot', 'Blade', 'quot']",X-Men VHS

Just recently, I watched the DVD for the first time (I haven't seen any X-Men movies at this time). The movie in itself is a great film that will surely entertain everyone; including those who are not typically Sci-Fi fans such as myself. The movie left me very much looking forward to seeing the other two movies, but only after watching this one AGAIN first.Three of us watched this film and we watched it in the enhanced mode where ""deleted scenes"" and ""behind the scenes looks"" were cut into the picture. I was expecting the scenes to just be added in clearly and cleanly like they were for Spider-Man 2.1, however they were not. The deleted scenes were located on another part of the DVD causing brupt pauses before and after each scene came on. With two discs, one would think they would have put the two versions of the movie in this collection in SEPERATE spaces for continuous playback with either version. However, they did not. (Note the regular version of the movie is continuous and uninterupted.) In the enhanced mode, there are ""X""s and ""/""s that appear on your screen when either a ""deleted scene"" or a ""behind the scenese look"" comes up during the movie. For this reason, my rating of the movie gets a 4 out of 5 stars.This Steelbook Edition, along with the other nine Steelbooks that recently came out in June of 2007, is a reprint of the 2-Disc previously released edition of X-Men 1.5. There's nothing new about it, but it gives those who missed out on the opportunity to get the 1.5 version a second chance. Even with the pausing and cues that occur in the enhanced viewing mode of the extended version, the same format was copied from the first release; which was done before Spider-Man 2.1 came out (which may explain the better viewing of Spidey).X-Men, as I said before, was a very good movie. I highly recommend this Steelbook to anyone who's a fan of X-Men. The bonus features are plentiful and will give fans even more enjoyment of this great film in a highly preservable packaging. I understand this is a rare and limited Steelbook, but if you can get it, I'm sure you'll be satisfied.",4,Steelbook Review of the X-Men 1.5 2-Disc Set,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2226,"['bought', 'Steelbook', 'Edition', 'rare', '1.5', 'version', 'X-Men', 'Best', 'Buy', 'where', 'believe', 'was', 'exclusive', 'Just', 'recently', 'watched', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'time', 'movie', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'surely', 'entertain', 'everyone', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'typically', 'Sci-Fi', 'fans', 'such', 'movie', 'left', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'only', 'watching', 'one', 'AGAIN', 'first.Three', 'watched', 'film', 'watched', 'enhanced', 'mode', 'where', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'looks', 'were', 'cut', 'picture', 'was', 'expecting', 'scenes', 'just', 'be', 'added', 'clearly', 'cleanly', 'were', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'however', 'were', 'not', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'located', 'part', 'DVD', 'causing', 'brupt', 'pauses', 'scene', 'came', 'two', 'discs', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'collection', 'SEPERATE', 'spaces', 'continuous', 'playback', 'version', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'Note', 'regular', 'version', 'movie', 'continuous', 'uninterupted', 'enhanced', 'mode', 'are', 'X', 's', '/', 's', 'appear', 'screen', 'when', 'deleted', 'scene', 'scenese', 'look', 'up', 'movie', 'reason', 'rating', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars.This', 'Steelbook', 'Edition', 'other', 'nine', 'Steelbooks', 'recently', 'came', 'out', 'June', '2007', 'reprint', '2-Disc', 'previously', 'released', 'edition', 'X-Men', '1.5', 'nothing', 'new', 'who', 'missed', 'out', 'opportunity', 'get', '1.5', 'version', 'second', 'chance', 'Even', 'pausing', 'cues', 'occur', 'enhanced', 'viewing', 'mode', 'extended', 'version', 'same', 'format', 'was', 'copied', 'first', 'release', 'was', 'done', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'came', 'out', 'may', 'explain', 'better', 'viewing', 'Spidey', '.X-Men', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Steelbook', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'plentiful', 'will', 'give', 'fans', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'preservable', 'packaging', 'understand', 'rare', 'limited', 'Steelbook', 'can', 'get', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied']",X-Men VHS
521727,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003CX8I,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)"" (2006).""X-Men"" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the general plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are presented and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and understandably opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as Iceman and Pyro. Both groups meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which I believe is the weakest part of the film.Regardless, when I saw ""X-Men"" in the theater in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the great quality of many of those flicks.GRADE: A-",5,Laid the foundation for all the great Superhero flicks to come,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2201,"['think', 'X-Men', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'popular', 'X-Men', 'dare', 'be', 'different', 'concept', 'X-Men', 'strays', 'far', 'superhero', 'conventions', 'approach', 'X-Men', 'films', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'getting', 'something', 'akin', 'Superman', 'Spider-Man', 'Batman', 'forget', 'it.The', 'unique', 'concept', 'X-Men', 'humanity', 'starting', 'evolve', 'next', 'level', 'humans', 'globe', 'are', 'starting', 'manifest', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'mutant', 'X', 'gene', 'Two', 'mutant', 'leaders', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'old', 'friends', 'take', 'highly', 'contrasting', 'positions', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'school', 'mutant', 'youths', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'attitude', 'positive', 'goal', 'benign', 'Eric', 'Lensherr', 'Magneto', 'other', 'hand', 'fed', 'up', 'paranoia', 'non-mutants', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutants', 'clear', 'attitude', 'superiority', 'say', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely.You', 'could', 'say', 'Xavier', 'approach', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'Magneto', 'route', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'interesting', 'comparison.Although', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'feel', 'three', 'films', 'original', 'trilogy', 'are', 'same', 'general', 'quality', 'X-Men', '2000', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'Two-Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2003', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2006', 'X-Men', 'naturally', 'foundation', 'introducing', 'principle', 'characters', 'general', 'plight', 'mutants', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'are', 'presented', 'slowly', 'develop', 'interesting', 'big', 'brother/little', 'sister', 'type', 'relationship', 'come', 'contact', 'Magneto', 'Brotherhood', 'Xavier', 'school', 'understandably', 'opt', 'latter', 'Magneto', 'bunch', 'Sabertooth', 'Toad', 'Mystique', 'Xavier', 'team', 'Cyclops', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Storm', 'as', 'well', 'Iceman', 'Pyro', 'groups', 'meet', 'tussle', 'Liberty', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'Harbor', 'believe', 'weakest', 'part', 'film.Regardless', 'when', 'saw', 'X-Men', 'theater', '2000', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'comic-to-film', 'adaption', 'Superman', '1978', 'Superman', 'II', '1980', 'was', 'precursor', 'great', 'superhero', 'films', 'came', 'out', '2000s', 'only', 'lost', 'allure', 'due', 'great', 'quality', 'many', 'flicks.GRADE', 'A-']",X-Men VHS

The contradictions detract from the movie for someone familiar with the comics, but if I were new to the storyline, it would be an enjoyable exercise in fantasy.

521730,A318RKL1I9ABCM,B00003CX8I,"""zaloop""","[10, 18]","X-Men could've been the best film of the summer. It's still mostly good,  but it has a bunch of flaws- little lapses in direction- that, combined,  hurt the film. In other words, this film is pretty good, but by no means  great.For a comic-book adaptation or any action film, the story is exceptionally  smart and clever. There are a number of clever little details which  combine to make a very convincing setting. For example, Xavier's school is  just like a regular school, and its students have their own quirks (like  when a boy uses teleportation in a basketball game and the other kids  yell &quot;Hey, no fair! We said no powers!&quot;). The  allusions to racial and ethnic tensions in our own world are apparent in  the persecution of mutants, the McCarthyism of Sen. Kelly, and the  opposing philosophies of Magneto (Malcolm X) and Prof. Xavier (MLK, Jr.).  I like how the two were friends yet separated by principle. All the  conversation scenes with them are clever and entertaining; we can tell  that these two people have known each other for a long time and are aware  of each other's nuances and behaviors. And, even though it consisted  mostly of innuendo jokes, the love triangle between Logan, Cyclops, and  Jean Grey provides nice tension among the X-Men.The characterizations are well-done. The opening scene, of a concentration  camp, is in exact contrast to what one would expect from a comic-book  action film, and the tone of it (hopeless, desperate, isolated, angry,  dark) sets the stage for the themes about to be presented in the movie  later on. It creates understanding for Magneto, and a human connection to  the mutant. The superheroes in this film are not perfect and happy; the  film not only shows us how they suffer and have their own inner conflicts,  but also portrays the responsibilities and risks each of their superpowers  entails. (Like when Rogue asks Logan, &quot;Does it hurt when they come out?&quot;  and he answers, &quot;Every time.&quot;) This is a serious, realistic superhero  film. There's almost no parody or self-mockery of the characters that  would be used to &quot;lighten things up.&quot; That's very refreshing.But X-Men has its flaws, which end up showing why it can be called pretty  good, but not great. First of all, the story. By itself, the story for X- Men is great, in theory at least. But in the context of the film, it's  not. Its weakness comes from its application. It's simply given way too  much time in the film. Because it's blown all out of proportion, it loses  its effect by being stretched too far. It should've been secondary to the  most important element: the action. If it were compressed more, the effect  would've been magnified and it would've worked a lot better. X-Men's story  is good, but not good enough to survive being given as much screen time as  it was. It becomes tedious. It takes up so much, the action only has about 15 minutes to  develop. This is a result of a script that still needed work, and some bad  editing.Secondly, X-Men is a little weak in its visual aspect, and doesn't have a  lot of imagination put into it. The sets, effects, and detail simply  aren't well thought-out or original enough to be called great. If you want  to see a truly visual film, watch Gladiator (definitely the best film of the summer), which has wonderful, diverse  sets, with minute detail packed into every scene and setting. X-Men has  nothing special like this. And the costumes (except Mystique's) look like they were bought at some cheap Halloween outfit store.Finally, the third weakness X-Men has is, unfortunately, the most  important aspect: the action. Although director Bryan Singer did a good  job overall with X-Men, his direction at times could be summed up in one  word: lazy. He lets the story get expanded to insane lengths, and one can  so obviously tell he's a novice at action. The action scenes are  undeveloped (with only about 15 minutes net screen time, it's no wonder);  the mutants' powers are never really taken advantage of (Toad, one of the  best, appearing for a whopping 5 minutes, 2 1/2 minutes of which he spent  fighting with his tongue, which is just stupid). The action has a poorly- made, hokey quality about it; besides the flaws I just mentioned, the wire  work is awful: whenever someone is thrown or blown away by an impact of  some sort, they fly across the room completely horizontally, as if they're  on a trolley. And during the Wolverine vs. Mystique fight (the best part  of the film), the martial arts are sluggish and the actors seem to be  slowing down for each other's benefit, so that they'd get all the moves  down. Whenever Mystique kicks or flips, it looked awkward and forced-  again, the poor wire work. Not to mention that this looks like a ripoff of  an action scene from The Matrix, only slower.You won't be sorry seeing X-Men, but it isn't anything special. Go see (or  see again, or buy) Gladiator, the best film of the summer, or The Matrix,  or The Phantom Menace, all excellent examples of how an action film should  be done. This is still a good film. I am giving it three stars, after all. I applaud  Singer for actually making a smart, clever comic-book adaptation. But if  there will be a sequel, I hope another director is attached to it, one who  can truly take advantage of the potential this material has.",3,"Good, but wastes potential to be
