This is a work of carnal passion vs. religious masochism.  The production shows the conflict magnificently.On the side of passion, naked dancers, roses and more roses.  On the side of religious SM, the thorns, crosses strewn everywhere,  The staging is incredibly effective.  When Thais' doppelganger raises to dance naked on a cross during the Meditation, ending up in a crucifixion pose, I was simply astonished at the forceful message of conversion, which ends with the bed of roses abruptly bereft of petals,revealing the thorns.I found all of the principals excellent. . Eva Mei and Michele Pertusi are simply magnificent.  This is what all opera should be: a feast for the eye and the ear.  But I am afraid that in our country, full of hypocritical pharisees (too much naked flesh, someone complained) such a production would not be possible.

I saw my first production at the San Francisco Opera in the 70's.  The only thing I can remember was Athanael squirming around on a rock with a vision of Thais in the background.  The roll was sung by Beverly Sills.  I guess eroticism has no boundaries.  My second viewing was at Chicago Lyric a couple seasons ago.  Rene Fleming was Athanel's object of desire and the singing and production was quite good, but I was still looking at my watch listening to this mediocre music.Not one to give up or perhaps I'm just a glutton for punishment, I ordered the DVD which only confirms my suspicion - this is not a very good opera.  The singers barely have the vocal resources to handle the score.  They really have to work hard to sing all the notes, especially Eva Mei in the title roll.The production is about as cheesy as it gets.  Pier Luigi Pizzi should be ashamed of himself.  It's full ot T&A; including a nearly bare chested Thais.  And all things being equal, a couple of totally nude (from behind) male supers are positioned in Thias' chamber - but don't blink or you'll miss them!What I found really offensive took place during the ""conversion dream"" when a topless ballerina was wiggling around on a cross made out of steel beams.  If you have any religious sensibilities this scene will offend you.  It was like a nightmare version of the Cirque du Solei or a drinken night at Hooters.There was also too much use of the colors pink and red.  Video isn't kind to these hues as they come across as blurry and overpowering.  And what was the director thinking when he had those dancers coming down the staircase wearing what looked like pink bubble wrap?On the plus side, the conductor, Marcello Viotti, is excellent but unfortunately this talented man just died.  And the final scene with a hundred or so white crosses on the stage is effective however placing the topless dancers among them for the curtain call was in bad taste.I know I've seen an outstanding performance when I leave the theater reminiscing about the singing and music.

829204,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B0002ABSR2,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[54, 57]","Finally, some blistering Massenet for the screen!Pier Luigi Pizzo's production for La Fenice production is absolutely gorgeous with incredible care shown down to the smallest detail, yet always fresh and never fussy. Roses seem to be a central theme in this production and Pizzi gives us have tons of them, a virtual moving wall of roses. Thais (and later, Athanael's) bed is made of huge ropey vines of roses (which transforms during the meditation - as Thais lies on it, the roses all fall off at once leaving only a bed of giant thorny vines!).Eva Mei is a moving Thais and while the voice lacks some &quot;plushness&quot; her piano and sustained high register singing is pure and lovely. An affecting actress her transformation from courtesan to saint is not only believable but poignant, she actually seems to radiate. The Mirror Aria is well sung, but it is in her duets with Pertusi, especially the opening and closing ones of Act III where she shines. Her death scene is absolutely beautiful.A lot of flesh is on display here, the entire female corps de ballet is topless, save for necklaces, and Thais has a topless doppleganger who gives a radiant performance of the Meditation (Though Mei's own costume leaves little to the imagination at one point exposing one of her own breasts).Everyone is barefoot but with stunning, ornate ankle ornaments by a company called Pompei 2000. (The Venetian pedicurists must have been working overtime during this production!).Everybody has great legs here too, not just Thais and the girls, but also Athanael and Nicias. Both men here show a lot more skin than most male principals (and in their &quot;mini skirted&quot; tunics I was momentarily fearful of seeing something(s) revealed that needn't be seen).William Joyner's bright tenor rings nicely and in Nicias's brief time onstage, Joyner creates a vain but imminently likeable fellow. I haven't seen this singer in about a decade and it's nice to hear (and see) him looking and sounding so fit!While the opera is called Thais - and as terrific as Mei is in the role - Michele Pertusi as Athanael just about walks away with the show. His is a presence that is never less than magnificent. He is a complete master of &quot;the pose&quot;; his hands, feet, face, his every gesture is weighted with meaning and he looks like an El Greco painting come to life. Vocally, Pertusi wraps his himself around the role with a seemingly instinctual madness and burns with an intensity that never lets up (even after the final curtain - you'll see what I mean!)While costumes are &quot;traditional&quot; in their representation of early A.D. Egypt, the physical production is more representational and sparse but with stunning use of the stage (though the literally dozens and dozens of crosses in Act III - another heavy symbol here i- nitially had me thinking &quot;overkill&quot; - it still worked well and is visually arresting.)Marcello Viotti leads the Fenice forces - orchestra and chorus in a moving and theatrical reading.

829205,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B0002ABSR2,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[17, 25]","I've just finished watching my DVD of this performance. I'm not quite sure what to say. There were pluses... and there were minuses. Some of the elements in this production were in incredibly bad taste, and some worked very well. For the most part, I thought the lighting worked beautifully - it was a symphony of rich and sensuous colour. The costumes (when there were any) were mostly fine, except for Thais's, the first of which looked like a 60s black cocktail caftan, the second of which was fine except when it swung half off one shoulder to reveal Eva Mei's breast, and the third of which was a plain white sack-like garment which did not indicate purity to me - just a saccharine and tasteless smock effect. (I suspect directors or costume designers have difficulty with the concept of purity, finding it hard to convey without confusing it with prissy missishness.)For the most part, the casting was good - the Athanael had a great sense of drama and zeal, and the voice was... adequate. It never took wing, and it had some pushed moments, but for the most part, he was extremely convincing.The Nicias was deliciously decadent and almost effete in his role as the young aristocrat who sells off his vineyard and other property to indulge in a voluptuous week of amorous delight with the top courtesan of the city. His voice was a very ""pretty"" tenor, and mostly sounded fine.The role of Thais was taken by Eva Mei - and I do have some reservations. She's clearly an intelligent actress, and clearly has a voice that can sound pretty, but there were long sections and moments all over the place where the voice was unpleasant, uncertain, and off-pitch. For instance, the entire scene with Nicias, in her first appearance, was shoddily sung. Her ""Eternellement"" aria was surprisingly good in comparison, and the death scene was indeed very sensitively performed. But she did not come across as a sizzling and dazzling courtesan of such eroticism that the men of the city were slaves to her beauty. For that matter, while Ms Mei is by no means ill-looking, she's not Helen of Troy. The short hair which is revealed after the repentance is so distractingly inappropriate... I could understand the casting if Ms Mei's voice were outstanding, but it's not. It's mostly an average voice, sometimes a pretty voice, but never outstanding.The acting of EVERYONE was universally good in this performance, and that's odd - not that the acting should be so good, but that... well... frankly, the acting was so much better than the general standard of the singing. Perhaps I'm a purist - my first criterion in an operatic performance is the singing, and as a singer myself I know darned well I set high standards for others as well as for myself. The singing simply was not quite good enough to match the acting.My SECOND criterion in an operatic performance is the acting, and here I was mostly not disappointed.One of the huge drawbacks for me was the excessive nudity. There was no need for it, and the score doesn't call for it. Au contraire - the one scene where Thais should drop her robe in a taunting display never happened in this production. Indeed, Thais mostly stayed... er... staid, while the eroticism was given to almost entirely nude female dancers. I have a few reasons for not liking that.Firstly, Thais herself is minimised as the beautiful courtesan, because there are more attractive women prancing around naked, taking the focus away from Thais. Indeed, this happens even with the character of Nicias being virtually seduced by a particular G-stringed dancer, when the attention ought not to be upon another woman at that point at ALL.Secondly, too much flesh. Way too much flesh. The dancers began repeating moves all too frequently; they displayed their bare breasts all too frequently; they turned up everywhere, all too frequently.Thirdly, I wait possibly in vain for directors to realise eroticism doesn't necessarily mean nudism. It would have been more sensuous to avoid all the nudity, which really, really was gratuitous. Something much more effective could have worked well.Fourthly, what a pity - with all the nudity, there is no way I can lend this DVD to my two adorable little nieces. It's a shame - it's a beautiful opera, but made X-rated.And then there is the sacrilege aspect. Yes, I'm sorry, I'm one of those who took offence at a woman who's completely naked (except for a tiny G-string) crawling all over a cross, displaying herself, and then assuming the Christ position on the cross in the end of her dance. And all of this was going on during the beautiful Meditation, too. That was simply bad taste... incredibly vulgar and unnecessary.There were some nice touches in this production. But the negative aspects add up to a more lasting effect than the positive aspects.",3,The spirit was willing but the flesh was weak...,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,4810,"[""'ve"", 'just',

Eva Mei was not overly interesting as Thais and the production really would have been helped had she disrobed at the end of Act I. Carol Neblett did it to great acclaim years ago in Los Angeles and don't think for one minute that it wasn't the high point of the opera which everyone was waiting for.  That said, it should be obvious that I don't have a problem with nudity on stage.  I did have a problem with the nude ballerina writhing around on a large crucifix during the Meditation.  It was uncalled for, visually offensive and there's no way I can ever show this DVD to my parents.  I'm surprised that the audience, in what is a heavily Catholic country, accepted it.  Had the artistic director had a different vision in designing this production, a scene like that would have never occurred.  As I mentioned in my review of this Teatro's production of Le Roi de Lahore, it seems to be a trademark of the Teatro La Fenice's to have stylized sets and somewhat historically incongruous costumes.  The Teatro should watch San Francisco's production of Samson et Dalila, as it appears they have no idea what French orientalism is all about. Lavish sets and costumes would have more than made up for this production's shortcomings.",2,Where is Cecil B.

Her singing is very poor.  She must have practiced a lot for the last scene as she was more together vocally there.  Still, nothing about the way she acts or looks or sings evokes any sensuality.  In fact, very much a turn off.  I guess that's why our stage director shows so much nudity, to try to get some sexual feeling to the audience.I always thought Dessay would be perfect in this role with her ethereal singing and heart wrenching acting.

And too, to my ear her intonation is suspect.  I  hear her often as coming in under thesweet spot of the note. With that aside, it is a beautiful production of a lush score and I am very glad I have it.  The main draw is the orchestral richness of this score.In the strictly personal taste view, I found the Meditation physical accompaniment to be a distraction from the pure beauty of the moment and the music.  It put me in mind of productions that attempt to ""do"" something during Butterfly's overnight wait for Pinkerton.  Best left to stillness in my view.

Eva Mei has sour moments vocally, and others where she is very bright; i agree that physically it's a brave performance, not only at exposing her body but the suppleness with which she moves. She makes one believe in her character all the way. Same with Pertusi, he is totally the fanatical monk fighting his own sensuality, and has a stunning presence. He has a large voice, but goes sharp in many places, and it turns hard and ugly when singing forte: that's why, in spite of all his fine qualities, i'd like to hear this role sung by someone with a warmer voice. The tenor singing Nicias (excepting an ugly top note at the end of his part) and the other roles were finely cast, i just would have had other singer for Albine, who was wobbly. I found the production stunning, full of beautiful effects. Can't imagine it better done.

829211,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0002ABSR2,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[13, 15]","This is an incredible staging of the opera Thas, loosely based on Anatole France's book of the same name. As in so many operas, the story is nominal. Paphnutius is a monastic hermit who retired from worldly temptations many years ago. They have not retired from him, though, and he is bedeviled by thoughts of his former life of dissipation. Thas, a renowned actress and courtesan, is chief among the devils in his mind. He undertakes to claim her for the holy life, despite the lush promise of secular pleasures that he sees on his quest. He claims her and consigns her to a nunnery. She dies, then he dies, and they're all dead happily ever after.OK, I guess the plot isn't why you'd go see an opera. The reason for seeing this is the fantastic staging: stark and geometric, vivid and monumental. The main palette is extremes of black and white, until the scene turns to profane pleasures, or dreams of them. Then, the sets and costumes are all the red of passion and hellfire. Dancers join the stage at that point, semiclad women who represent lust in a wholly convincing way. The dance performance has spectacular solos at its several high points. In them, the prima ballerina captures the overwhelming grace, beauty, and physical power of the human animal. I guess that's the best word for this presentation, if I had to use just one: spectacle.I admit, I'm not a fan of opera per se, so I can't comment on the quality of the vocal performances. I don't have to, though - there's plenty here to enthrall us non-lovers of opera, and maybe to entice us back for more.//wiredweird",5,Magnificent pageant,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1582,"['incredible', 'staging', 'opera', 'Thas', 'loosely', 'based', 'Anatole', 'France', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'so', 'many', 'operas', 'story', 'nominal', 'Paphnutius', 'monastic', 'hermit', 'who', 'retired', 'worldly', 'temptations', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'not', 'retired', 'though', 'bedeviled', 'thoughts', 'former', 'life', 'dissipation', 'Thas', 'renowned', 'actress', 'courtesan', 'chief', 'devils', 'mind', 'claim', 'holy', 'life', 'lush', 'promise', 'secular', 'pleasures', 'quest', 'consigns', 'nunnery', 'then', ""'re"", 'dead', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.OK', 'guess', 'plot', ""n't"", 'why', ""'d"", 'go', 'see', 'opera', 'reason', 'seeing', 'fantastic', 'staging', 'stark', 'geometric', 'vivid', 'monumental', 'main', 'palette', 'extremes', 'black', 'white', 'scene', 'profane', 'pleasures', 'dreams', 'Then', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'red', 'passion', 'hellfire', 'Dancers', 'join', 'stage', 'point', 'semiclad', 'women', 'who', 'represent', 'lust', 'wholly', 'convincing', 'way', 'dance', 'performance', 'spectacular', 'solos', 'several', 'high', 'points', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'overwhelming', 'grace', 'beauty', 'physical', 'power', 'human', 'animal', 'guess', 'best', 'word', 'presentation', 'had', 'use', 'just', 'one', 'spectacle.I', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'opera', 'se', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'vocal', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plenty', 'here', 'enthrall', 'non-lovers', 'opera', 'maybe', 'entice', 'back', 'more.//wiredweird']","Massenet - Thais / Mei, Pertusi, Joyner, Fel, Viotti, Venice Opera"
