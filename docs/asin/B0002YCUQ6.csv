850799,ABHR4QW3JAJXC,B0002YCUQ6,Jason Serra,"[28, 37]","The problem with this is that unlike all other TV series which generally include proper credits for each episode, commentaries, special features, original music & sounds... in other words, the real TV series, this offers NOTHING. This is a cheap way to test the waters to see if anyone would drop the cash on the whole set. Lucasfilm says ""this is what people have been waiting for."" No, no it isn't. Season one of the Ewoks ran with the droids in a program called ""The Ewoks & Droids Adventure Hour"" & had a wonderful theme song by blues artist Taj Mahal. The stories were wonderful & in a way, built on one another. Season two ran alone & was drawn a bit differently & focused mainly on Wicket, Teebo, Kneesaa, & Latara. It was geared mostly for the very young, except for a couple of episodes (""The Night of the Stranger"" & ""Battle For The Sunstar""). Season two also was a bit more varied with several of the episodes split into two stories, offering more tales from the Endor woods.At any rate, this IS NOT what people have been waiting for at all. It's the same as it was on VHS, meaning that they only offer a few episodes, different music, & a whole lot of nothing else. Wait for the release of the rest of the series (but not too long, because they never will). If you want to blow your dough on this, go ahead.

I remember seeing this animated series during its original television run in 1985 through 1987 as I went from a 10-year-old boy to a 12-year-old pre-adolescent and I loved these cartoons growing up and I still do. I only wish that Lucas had released all of them instead of just two of them. These ""Ewok"" cartoons take place before the two Ewok television movies as we watch Wicket, Princess Kneesaa, and Teebo grow up on the moon of Endor. Once again George Lucas is executive producer as he did with ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" & ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" and that in part is what made this animated television series so good, because George Lucas is a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the episodes, but he is no director. Any episodes of this wonderful animated series is highly recommended and a great & positive influence for children to watch.",5,The first animated series from the greatest film saga ever!,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,1164,"['have', 'read', 'reviews', 'line', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'first', 'release', 'two', 'Ewok', 'cartoon', 'episodes', 'Haunted', 'Village', 'Tales', 'Endor', 'Woods', 'agree', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'animated', 'series', 'original', 'television', 'run', '1985', '1987', 'went', '10-year-old', 'boy', '12-year-old', 'pre-adolescent', 'loved', 'cartoons', 'growing', 'up', 'still', 'do', 'only', 'wish', 'Lucas', 'had', 'released', 'instead', 'just', 'two', 'Ewok', 'cartoons', 'take', 'place', 'two', 'Ewok', 'television', 'movies', 'watch', 'Wicket', 'Princess', 'Kneesaa', 'Teebo', 'grow', 'up', 'moon', 'Endor', 'Once', 'again', 'George', 'Lucas', 'executive', 'producer', 'did', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'V', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'VI', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'animated', 'television', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'George', 'Lucas', 'great', 'storyteller', 'creating', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'adventure', 'watch', 'characters', 'grow', 'episodes', 'director', 'Any', 'episodes', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'great', 'positive', 'influence', 'children', 'watch']",Star Wars Animated Adventures: Ewoks

Basically what this release is is 8 episodes from the first season of the show cobbled together to form two very unbalanced animated films. What we do get is basically 8 episodes of the show with new adult Wicket voice-overs. What we don't get is the opening theme song, original end credits, and I have a feeling original music (though I guess I'll never know since this will probably be the only release in this format.) At least the ""chapters"" are labeled with the original episode titles. I know this sounds nit-picky and in the vein of the ""complainers"" of the ill done reissues of the Original Star Wars trilogy on DVD, but come on.

Sinclare,"[1, 2]","I have read what other reviewers had to say about this Ewoks DVD release and I completely agree, they are not being nitpicky, they are telling the truth - This is total CRAP!  I found my copy for 4 dollars at a local pond shop where I live which is the only reason I even picked it up.  I would never have paid amazon's outrageous price for it.  I have never seen anything butchered this badly in my life.  I used to watch this show when I was a kid and I remember it soooo differently.  The episodes that are included are badly edited together and have footage missing(in addition to the already missing original opening theme song and original end credits).  All I can say is is that if George Lucas were ever to be roasted on the comedy network, this particular DVD release would be thrown right in his face.  Hopefully one day this show will be released in proper seasonal packaging with all the episodes fully restored.
