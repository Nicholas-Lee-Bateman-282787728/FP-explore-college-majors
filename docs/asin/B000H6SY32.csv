His candor is very refreshing, and while I have this DVD, I regularly watch this also on my iPod Touch. The dvd has a few extras that didn't make the cut, but his experience, while he is a celebrity, still hits home. You will enjoy this.",5,Yes. Absolutely.

Tarin ""EveryoneIsBlindnDeaf""","[7, 8]","Like everyone else, I was wondering about what happened to Dave when he busted to Africa, all the rumors this one that one and all the others.  Well here is all the scoop, he tells it like it is, after you see this you will go ohhhhhhhhh okay!plus lots of funny stuff, as well as serious talk, as only Dave can say it.This show was so in demand to keep playing after it aired, and calls and emails for a DVD were so many that here he go for the first time ever, over 200 guest, a DVD is released from one guest of this show.  There is another DVD ""Set"" with Clint Eastwood, B.S. ( Barbara Streisand, Robert Redford, and someone else, but how about that, the biggest stars of the world, and they wont even give them there own dvd release, it's all together or nothing.  Dave has is OWN release, that should tell you how compelling this particular show was, and is.The only guest of James that was tops over this, was Robin Williams, off the hook make you pee and cry show, and that was on a couple years ago, and still no DVD from that one.  hope they release that.Dave or Daves peeps, if your reading this, please re release Killin Them Softly DVD with Closed Captioned.  They play this on Comedy Channel, and its closed captioned, I would like to by the dvd as well as you would be suprised how many people out there have bad hearing, not just deaf.  as we have in our family.  since the comedy channel already has it captioned, maybe can look into using that over to the dvd, this way not much of a new incured cost, eh?Also, Daves show season one and two, actually say closed captioned on the box, but its not.  I emailed lots of people of this site and asked them to try there dvd out to see, everyone said the dvd they have also doesnt have it.  please address, again on tv its closed captioned, maybe transfer it over to the dvd's?  to lesson the cost.  think of all the people that will now buy these dvds now that it has it, thanks.",5,"Dave talks about everything, must see DVD",1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,1940,"['everyone', 'else', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'Dave', 'when', 'busted', 'Africa', 'rumors', 'one', 'one', 'others', 'Well', 'here', 'scoop', 'see', 'will', 'go', 'ohhhhhhhhh', 'okay', 'lots', 'funny', 'stuff', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'talk', 'only', 'Dave', 'can', 'say', 'it.This', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'demand', 'keep', 'playing', 'aired', 'calls', 'emails', 'DVD', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'here', 'go', 'first', 'time', 'ever', '200', 'guest', 'DVD', 'released', 'one', 'guest', 'show', 'DVD', 'Set', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'B.S', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'someone', 'else', 'how', 'biggest', 'stars', 'world', 'wont', 'even', 'give', 'there', 'own', 'dvd', 'release', 'together', 'nothing', 'Dave', 'OWN', 'release', 'should', 'tell', 'how', 'compelling', 'particular', 'show', 'was', 'only', 'guest', 'James', 'was', 'tops', 'was', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'hook', 'make', 'pee', 'cry', 'show', 'was', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'DVD', 'one', 'hope', 'release', 'that.Dave', 'peeps', 'reading', 'please', 're', 'release', 'Killin', 'Them', 'Softly', 'DVD', 'Closed', 'Captioned', 'play', 'Comedy', 'Channel', 'closed', 'captioned', 'would', 'like', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'suprised', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'have', 'bad', 'hearing', 'not', 'just', 'deaf', 'have', 'family', 'comedy', 'channel', 'already', 'captioned', 'maybe', 'can', 'look', 'using', 'dvd', 'way', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'incured', 'cost', 'eh', 'Also', 'show', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'actually', 'say', 'closed', 'captioned', 'box', 'not', 'emailed', 'lots', 'people', 'site', 'asked', 'try', 'there', 'out', 'see', 'everyone', 'said', 'dvd', 'have', 'also', 'doesnt', 'have', 'please', 'address', 'again', 'tv', 'closed', 'captioned', 'maybe', 'transfer', 'dvd', 'lesson', 'cost', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'now', 'buy', 'dvds', 'now', 'thanks']",Inside The Actors Studio: Dave Chappelle
