True he uses alot of foul language during his comedy set but that's what makes him the way he is.  Some of my favorite parts of this DVD was the start with him with a shovel and then saying ""Told you to shut up"".  Perfect way to start the DVD then some of the jokes were sexual in style but given his past preformances thats a given for his sets.  But beside Christopher Titus, Ron White, and I think one other comedian who can make me laugh so hard I will fall over in the chair or sofa.  Ron White was able to do just that with most of this jokes my gut was hurting at one point and then almost cried from the laughing.  So in closing I own all of Mr. Ron White's comedy sets DVD wise Tatar Salad, Behavioral Problems, You Can't Fix Stupid, and now A Little Unprofessional.
