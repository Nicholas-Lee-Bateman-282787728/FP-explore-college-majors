His attraction to his model muse due to his thighs seems misplaced if not mystifying and his addiction to thinness seems particularly a waste of time. The Valentino film is much more entertaining than this but then again, so is he personally so maybe that's the difference. We did learn Lagerfeld lives all over the world which we knew and flies in private jets which we knew so not a whole lot of new here except his devotion to dogs which seems to match the Queen's obsession with her corgis which makes him more human. To the degree that was in question, his staff and his videographer seem devoted to him which is a very good sign.

Night and Day doesn't even begin to describe the difference between YSL and Karl Lagerfeld.  I also watched this on the Sundance Channel during their fashion designers marathon.  Karl Lagerfeld's crappy bedroom on its own not compared to YSL's home tells you how Lagerfeld sells Chanel.  He has ALL the clothing creation history of Europe AND China.  So many people can fill his shoes.  I haven't seen one item that is not derived and can't be traced.  He's not like Christian Lacroix who is the real Elizabeth Taylor of the bunch and no one is doing anything about it.  The only thing missing is access to historical information and skilled craftspeople thrown at African creativity - look at the Byron Lars Barbies - strip away the distracting colors and materials - look at it in black and white or imagine it as a sketch - and you can see, they can do it.  Many people on this planet can do Karl Lagerfeld's job and we'll be spared the sight of Claudie Schiffer's teat inspired champagne glass.

If it is what you want then go to Wikipedia and you will get this in detail.

He is a genius. He is arrogant. I guess the top in most fields will have some twist to their unique character that enabling them to propel with new visions - or borrowed modified in new light.I think that the movies, personally is entertaining. I like the strong character seeing some of the &#34;ignorant&#34; views from the bubble of praise he must live in - and deserves. I respect his work, I like his tongue that offends many. Others it motivates. I am in the second category.The question, for you, is why are you viewing this. If you are interested in fashion, fashion design, or autobiography like documentaries I think this will be of interest to you. If the tilt is mainly fashion I would recommend this regardless if whether you like him or not - it is a good way to see a segment of the high-end industry and how it works for the successful, somehow. If your favourite viewing genres are more mainstream and politically correct - you may want to look elsewhere.This gets a five from me, as it is brilliant. Even the irksome arrogance he speaks of is often lined with truth. The perspective matters. Think well - of you buy - enjoy it for what it is.

1169310,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001AZIRUE,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Maybe &#8220;Lagerfeld Confidential&#8221; is not the right title for this documentary. The entire film is an up-close, straightforward portrayal of Karl Lagerfeld, to be sure, but for anyone who is looking for an in-depth look into what made him one of the most influential icons in the fashion world, Rodolphe Marconi&#8217;s documentary would seem superficial.You will not learn much about the personal history or career of Karl Lagerfeld, or the wide variety of his works. The documentary film looks like bits of footage about the designer working and talking, all pieced together at random. You are going to see inside his mansion, and witness how he draws, surrounded by stacks of books, or how he works with Nicole Kidman for a Chanel photo shoot, and so on, but not much that is really interesting.But Karl Lagerfeld himself is something different. He talks before the camera about his childhood and his philosophies of life, and these bits themselves are pretty interesting partly because of the way in which Lagerfeld speaks. You are not perfectly sure who he is or what he really thinks, but you know he is acting out the role of Karl Lagerfeld, and he does it perfectly.After all this is a film about Karl Lagerfeld, a sharp-witted man who has successfully remained an elusive figure. Probably that&#8217;s what he wants, and he does it very well.
