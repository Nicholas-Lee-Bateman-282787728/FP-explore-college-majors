1178988,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B001D2WUDE,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[14, 20]","Having made his initial TV debut years earlier as Republican Alex P. Keaton, Michael J. Fox blatantly crossed the political aisle in his triumphant TV return.Now he is playing Democratic New York Deputy Mayor Mike Flaherty. Flaherty is a curious combination of Al Gore and George Stephanopoulos with lots of requisite/inevitable `Kennedy family' references tossed in.His boss is Mayor Randall Winston (Barry Bostwick), a more-or-less transparent spoof of Bill Clinton. In terms of physical structure at least, there is a fair resemblance. Vocal-inflection and intelligence, I don't see a comparison, but hey, politics is the game of compromise. You take what you can get.Basically, this is a small-screen version of Primary Colors: a warm-hearted but satirical look at Democratic politics. And the 24-episode season won't make you incur a personal deficit in order to own it!A favorite episode is ""Kiss Me Stupid"" where another childhood crush, Luke Perry returns to his former boyfriend Carter Heywood--with some very important but unexpected news. After having dated each other for a while, Luke's character now dates women, even planning on marriage. Spence Kamer wants Carter to be his best man for this impending ceremony. Perry's apparent comfort with publically delivering `flirty' lines to another man sincerely impressed me, having grown up seeing him merely as a `teen idol'. Instead of Sheen in the later seasons, the production crew for this series should have convinced Perry to sign on as a replacement for Fox. Who knew he was capable of successfully delivering sitcom work? I certainly hadn't.Being a disability advocate, I easily imagined myself in ""Deaf Becomes Her"".  Misunderstandings about the Mayor's intention towards the deaf community (and more generalized, the disability community!) eventually get successfully resolved. Arriving at mutual ground, Mike and the city's leading deaf advocate realize they do share a mutual desire to help people--and maybe more.Mike is a politician, but he's also on the prowl only for true and lasting love. An ongoing storyline this season is his romance with news reporter Ashley Schaeffer (Carla Gugino)---and how sincerely heartbroken he becomes upon their breakup (""Bye-Bye, Love""). Rather than a temporary fling with the inevitable `campaign trail...etc' woman, Mike concedes that he is looking for something deeper and safer (""Striptease"").This is exactly why Mike is so charming; he is political without being `sleazy' or the stereotypical know-it-all. He's still our lovable `guy-next door'!After Mike (duh), my second favorite permanent staff member has to be Carter Heywood (Michael Boatman). As the Mayor's ""Diversity Liaison"" (who comes on in the ""Pilot""), he is supposed to perform outreach with and for `diverse' community organizations. Otherwise, presumably these groups would not have their fair share of representation at City Hall. For it's not that the other staff are insensitive or `not diverse' they just juggle multiple `other concerns' in the ever-compartmentalized world of public service. There is always too much to do and never enough time or money.Perpetual pulls between his previous ""outsider"" grassroots community organizing and now being on the `inside' gets best illustrated in ""Pride and Prejudice"". The same needle exchange program which Carter believes would halt (or even eliminate) the spread of AIDS throughout New York ultimately must get withdrawn for political expediency. It's a powerful lesson for Carter to concede that the `edgiest' public policies will not always work the best in the staid world of bureaucracy. Carter is passionate about his causes, but he's also genuinely intelligent and articulate--rather than being a `token' who is appointed merely to fill a slot.Since Boatman and the other actors merely could have been one-dimensional tokens for Fox and Bostwick to bounce their one-liners off of, it's appreciated that they have substantive plots of their own throughout this season (and the series). Technically it's 'his' show, but Fox is the type of leading actor who sucessfully demonstrates that he can and is not afraid to share the limelight with other actors.Extras for this season include a retrospective featurette by the cast and crew: they are also contributing to fond memories about this perpetually awesome series. And Michael J. Fox and Gary David Goldberg themselves provided a seminar to what was then the Museum of Television & Radio. It explained how the creation of this series successfully came into fruition between the two of them.Please, please, cast your vote for this release so we get (at least) all the seasons with Mike elected into production--and on the market!",5,Campaign for great TV!,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,4713,"['Having', 'made', 'initial', 'TV', 'debut', 'years', 'earlier', 'Republican', 'Alex', 'P.',

Fox's character smoothing out the wrinkles in his boss (Barry Bostwick)s' debut term as mayor of New York, but the newest hire in the Mayor's office was black gay activist Carter Heywood (Michael Boatman) as head of minority affairs. Early episodes not only dealt with Carter trying to increase AIDS funding, and establish a needle exchange, but seven shows into the run he staged a mock wedding to protest the mayor's stand against gay marriage. Plus, Boatman and Fox's characters share an onscreen kiss to make guest star Luke Perry (Carter's bisexual ex) jealous.

I found humor in some small things but others i just found to be to forced like Fox and cast were just reading various cracks off cue cards. Fox is the best in the show, as expected but he just seems like he's trying to hard to be the clever Alex P Keaton, economical, political suit wearing boy we all know and love. His character as Mike seems very confused and feels like he can't quite find his niche'. Alex was one of the most if not the most notable character to come out of 80's sitcoms, therefore i guess its hard to compare them. All in all the show isn't horrible, but i've got to admit the writing just isn't very good. Also i'm not all about the homosexual movement and i disagree with it totally, and there is far to much of that in the show as well, and 80% of the show revolves around sexual humor. Its ok after a bit, but is a bit overkill at times, the good thing about Family Ties it was one of the few shows that had limits and was very original and a good family show for everyone. Sure it had some cursing, sexual inuendos and such but it was with some class, and tact. I understand the show got good ratings because of Fox, but without him is was a utter disaster as Charlie Sheen showed us later on. Also trying to compete with Sienfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond was next to impossible, so an E for effort, but as i said i just really didn't find the show that funny.
