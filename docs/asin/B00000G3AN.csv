He had a longer and more comprehensive monologue for instance. He quit too soon. Very good information on Jack and I loved the ""W.C"" joke (audio only) that led him to leave the show and then come back. I never knew the whole story behind that.",5,Excellent Documentary,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,367,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', 'never', 'saw', 'Jack', 'Paar', 'show', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'ways', 'think', 'better', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'had', 'longer', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'monologue', 'instance', 'quit', 'too', 'soon', 'Very', 'good', 'information', 'Jack', 'loved', 'W.C', 'joke', 'only', 'led', 'leave', 'show', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'never', 'knew', 'whole', 'story']",N/A

What a talented feller! The best part of the whole business (although the entire program is wonderful) is the fact that the dvd &#8220;As I Was Saying&#8230;and More&#8221; includes audio of the infamous &#8220;WC&#8221; story that NBC refused to air in 1960.

It is bad...VERY bad. However, Paar himself is tremendous, as well as the overall program material.Even though I'm a HUGE fan of the late and great Johnny Carson,Jack Paar not only was the innovator of the talk show format, but also had the talent to back up those staunch critics who claim he remains #1. I'm among those many.His classic exchanges with Judy Garland and Jonathan Winters have never been equaled.

501068,ABDAHMRYSMMIV,B00000G3AN,"John Ellis ""jonthes""","[9, 9]","This collection is a wonderful portrait of Paar, who was an egotist but very charming. My only objection is - give us more of him with his great guests. Where is Dody Goodman, Beatrice Lillie, more Jonathan Winters, Judy Garland, Bette Davis? - neither this nor the other recent DVD issue of Paar really showcases him at his best, in the company of the great talents he drew to the Tonight Show and established the reputation that Johnny Carson and Leno today still feed off. Paar touring Africa is interesting. Paar with his guests was fascinating.

501069,A1J03J0HZ7KU5T,B00000G3AN,Scott T. Rivers,"[3, 3]","""As I Was Saying & More"" is a long-overdue appreciation of Jack Paar's influence on the television medium. As host of ""The Tonight Show"" from 1957 to 1962, he paved the talk-show road followed by Johnny Carson, David Letterman and numerous others. Paar was a brilliant monologist, cultural observer and undisputed master in the art of TV conversation. Happily, this VHS set includes a generous selection of rarely seen material, with a special video devoted to Paar's guest appearances and later work.

501070,A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00000G3AN,steve_manassas,"[0, 0]","This documentary originally aired in 1997 as an AMERICAN MASTERS SPECIAL on PBS.  I was too young to remember Jack Paar's stint on THE TONIGHT SHOW (NBC, 1957-62), but I do remember watching him on THE JACK PAAR PROGRAM (NBC, 1962-65).  This is an excellent documentary that tells Paar's life story from his Michigan childhood (he had a stuttering problem) to his World War II service in the Army, his days in radio, his short-lived Hollywood career, and his burgeoning TV career, beginning as a writer and guest host for Red Skelton, followed by his own series on CBS, and then the offer of a lifetime from NBC to host TONIGHT, which at that time was on its last legs (a couple of post-Steve Allen formats had failed miserably).  Jack took over the show in 1957 and successfully hosted it for five years, making TONIGHT the powerhouse franchise it still is today (Jack left TONIGHT in early 1962; guest hosts, including Merv Griffin, filled in until Johnny Carson took over on October 1, 1962.  After Johnny's retirement in May 1992, Jay Leno took over and has hosted THE TONIGHT SHOW ever since (except for the ill-fated period in 2009-10 when Conan O'Brien hosted TONIGHT for a few months, while Leno moved to prime time)).Jack then moved to prime time in 1962, retiring in 1965.  He made a few specials and guest appearances after that, and made another comeback in 1973 with JACK PAAR TONIGHT on ABC (nothing from that show is on this DVD).  Among the guests that Jack had over the years were Buddy Hackett, Judy Garland, Jonathan Winters, Oscar Levant, Dody Goodman, and political figures as diverse as John and Robert Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Barry Goldwater.  Bonus features include a photo gallery, credits for his entire TV career, a mini-documentary about JFK and PT-109, which aired on THE JACK PAAR PROGRAM (although the DVD packaging says that it aired in the late '60s), and the audio of the censored ""water closet"" joke from 1960, which caused Jack to leave THE TONIGHT SHOW for a while, although he eventually returned.Overall, the picture quality is good, considering the age of the clips.  Although the show was broadcast in Living Color, the clips were preserved in B&W;, as was common in those days.For those who like Jack Paar, this is an excellent purchase.",5,Excellent documentary of a TV pioneer,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2283,"['documentary', 'originally', 'aired', '1997', 'AMERICAN', 'MASTERS', 'SPECIAL', 'PBS', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'Jack', 'Paar', 'stint', 'THE', 'TONIGHT', 'SHOW', 'NBC', '1957-62', 'do', 'remember', 'watching', 'THE', 'JACK', 'PAAR', 'PROGRAM', 'NBC', '1962-65', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Paar', 'life', 'story', 'Michigan', 'childhood', 'had', 'stuttering', 'problem', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'service', 'Army', 'days', 'radio', 'short-lived', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'burgeoning', 'TV', 'career', 'beginning', 'writer', 'guest', 'host', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'followed', 'own', 'series', 'CBS', 'then', 'offer', 'lifetime', 'NBC', 'host', 'TONIGHT', 'time', 'was', 'last', 'legs', 'couple', 'post-Steve', 'Allen', 'formats', 'had', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Jack', 'took', 'over', 'show', '1957', 'successfully', 'hosted', 'five', 'years', 'making', 'TONIGHT', 'powerhouse', 'franchise', 'still', 'today', 'Jack', 'left', 'TONIGHT', 'early', '1962', 'guest', 'hosts', 'including', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'filled', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'took', 'over', 'October', '1', '1962', 'Johnny', 'retirement', 'May', '1992', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'took', 'over', 'hosted', 'THE', 'TONIGHT', 'SHOW', 'ever', 'ill-fated', 'period', '2009-10', 'when', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'hosted', 'TONIGHT', 'few', 'months', 'Leno', 'moved', 'prime', 'time', '.Jack', 'then', 'moved', 'prime', 'time', '1962', 'retiring', '1965', 'made', 'few', 'specials', 'guest', 'appearances', 'made', 'comeback', '1973', 'JACK', 'PAAR', 'TONIGHT', 'ABC', 'nothing', 'show', 'DVD', 'guests', 'Jack', 'had', 'years', 'were', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'political', 'figures', 'as', 'diverse', 'John', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'Bonus', 'include', 'photo', 'gallery', 'credits', 'entire', 'TV', 'career', 'mini-documentary', 'JFK', 'PT-109', 'aired', 'THE', 'JACK', 'PAAR', 'PROGRAM', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'aired', 'late', ""'60s"", 'audio', 'censored', 'water', 'closet', 'joke', '1960', 'caused', 'Jack', 'leave', 'THE', 'TONIGHT', 'SHOW', 'while', 'eventually', 'returned.Overall', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'considering', 'age', 'clips', 'show', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Living', 'Color', 'clips', 'were', 'preserved', 'B', 'W', 'was', 'common', 'days.For', 'who', 'like', 'Jack', 'Paar', 'excellent', 'purchase']",N/A
