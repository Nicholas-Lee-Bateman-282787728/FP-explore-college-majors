186009,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1572521716,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","Take two of my favorite foreign actors (Deneuve and Auteuil), place them in one of my favorite film genres (the family drama) and hand them a script that is fully capable of fleshing out everything that great about both facets and you have `Ma Saison Preferee', a stunning and beautifully intoxicating look at sibling relationships and what we make of them.Auteuil and Deneuve play Antoine and Emilie respectively, siblings who have drifted apart yet are brought together through mutual care for their ailing mother.  Emilie is trapped in a marriage of convenience, one that tests her patience and sends her riling into the arms of her brother Antoine, a jealous and emotionally drained man who has yet to find anyone who can reach him quite like his sister.  As Emilie struggles to find a newfound balance, one that will allot her a freedom yet not negate her responsibilities, she finds that sorting out her life is going to be more difficult than she expected; and with Antoine's sudden resurface everything gets a little more complicated.The film is a very profound and moving look at the bond that forms between siblings, a bond that can be hard to sever (impossible really) and one that is tested through all sorts of stormy weather.  One theme that I found very poignant here, but one that may not be directly addressed, is that of incest.  I don't mean that in the overtly literal sense of the word, but at least a mental form of incest, as both Emilie and (especially) Antoine find themselves entwined within one another in ways of less than amenable fashions.Don't let that idea turn you off, because it is not a overly expressed idea here, but it is one that can be raised (emotional incest maybe) and one that should be explored in order to appreciate the depth of character in this film.The performances are all stellar, but it is Daniel Auteuil that really steals my heart and my attention here.  There is a charismatic subtleness to his performance (this may be his finest hour, or at least one of his finest) that just draws me in to each frame.  The way he is consumed by his relationship with Emilie, the way it attacks him in varying ways (excitement, frustration, depression, aggression) is just stunning, and he plays with his character's emotions flawlessly.  Catherine Deneuve is stunning here, and effectively stunted in scenes (complaints have been made to her emotionally inexpressive performance, but I found that it was the perfect counterbalance to Auteuil's unraveling).  I loved them both, but Auteuil truly steals this film for me.With an elegant and sensual backdrop like Southern France dripping from every frame, `Ma Saison Preferee' is a beautiful and intoxicating film that will leave you with plenty to contemplate and remember.  If you are not moved by brooding character studies, or if you lack the willingness to delve into the unconventional depths of a film like this, then you should probably stay away, for `Ma Saison Preferee' will come across as boring and aimless to you; but if you can bring yourself to the places this film wants to take you then you will find satisfaction in every single word.",5,One of my favorite movies...,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,3145,"['Take', 'two', 'favorite', 'foreign', 'actors', 'Deneuve', 'Auteuil', 'place', 'one', 'favorite', 'film', 'genres', 'family', 'drama', 'hand', 'script', 'fully', 'capable', 'fleshing', 'out', 'everything', 'great', 'facets', 'have', 'Ma', 'Saison', 'Preferee', 'stunning', 'beautifully', 'intoxicating', 'look', 'sibling', 'relationships', 'what', 'make', 'them.Auteuil', 'Deneuve', 'play', 'Antoine', 'Emilie', 'respectively', 'siblings', 'who', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'yet', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'mutual', 'care', 'ailing', 'mother', 'Emilie', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'one', 'patience', 'riling', 'arms', 'brother', 'Antoine', 'jealous', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'man', 'who', 'yet', 'find', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'reach', 'quite', 'sister', 'Emilie', 'find', 'newfound', 'balance', 'one', 'will', 'allot', 'freedom', 'yet', 'not', 'negate', 'responsibilities', 'sorting', 'out', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'expected', 'Antoine', 'sudden', 'resurface', 'everything', 'little', 'more', 'complicated.The', 'film', 'very', 'profound', 'moving', 'look', 'bond', 'siblings', 'bond', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'sever', 'impossible', 'really', 'one', 'tested', 'sorts', 'stormy', 'weather', 'One', 'theme', 'found', 'very', 'poignant', 'here', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'directly', 'addressed', 'incest', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'overtly', 'literal', 'sense', 'word', 'least', 'mental', 'form', 'incest', 'Emilie', 'especially', 'Antoine', 'find', 'entwined', 'one', 'ways', 'less', 'amenable', 'fashions.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'idea', 'turn', 'off', 'not', 'overly', 'expressed', 'idea', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'raised', 'emotional', 'incest', 'maybe', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'explored', 'order', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'character', 'film.The', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'really', 'heart', 'attention', 'here', 'charismatic', 'subtleness', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'hour', 'least', 'one', 'finest', 'just', 'draws', 'frame', 'way', 'consumed', 'relationship', 'Emilie', 'way', 'varying', 'ways', 'excitement', 'frustration', 'depression', 'aggression', 'just', 'stunning', 'character', 'emotions', 'flawlessly', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'stunning', 'here', 'effectively', 'stunted', 'scenes', 'complaints', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'emotionally', 'inexpressive', 'performance', 'found', 'was', 'perfect', 'counterbalance', 'Auteuil', 'unraveling', 'loved', 'Auteuil', 'truly', 'film', 'me.With', 'elegant', 'sensual', 'backdrop', 'Southern', 'France', 'dripping', 'frame', 'Ma', 'Saison', 'Preferee', 'beautiful', 'intoxicating', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'plenty', 'contemplate', 'remember', 'are', 'not', 'moved', 'brooding', 'character', 'studies', 'lack', 'willingness', 'delve', 'unconventional', 'depths', 'film', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'Ma', 'Saison', 'Preferee', 'will', 'come', 'boring', 'aimless', 'can', 'bring', 'places', 'film', 'take', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'satisfaction', 'single', 'word']",N/A

186012,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572521716,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 9]","Interesting but somewhat cryptic family-dynamics saga presented with characteristic French warmth and some charm.  Daniel Auteuil plays a brain  surgeon in love with his big sister (Catherine Deneuve).  Apparently he has  been pining away for her for decades since they are now middle-aged.  She's  no longer interested in sex, and he apparently never was, since he never  married and lived alone.  Meanwhile mom, who loved him best, can't live  alone anymore because of fainting spells, and so goes to live with Deneuve  and her family.  But that doesn't work out and Auteuil won't or can't take  her in, and so they send her to a nursing home, which she hates.  All this  occasions brother and sister to spend some time together.  They recall with  fondness their childhood; and when she breaks up with her husband, little  brother rents a nice apartment for himself and her, all the better to live  happily ever after.Well, what a tease.  That really doesn't happen.  After a bit Deneuve gets seduced by a very aggressive and anonymous intern  which reawakens her sexuality and makes her realize she can't live with her  brother.  And so she leaves him.  He breaks into her house in an attempt to  get her back....I think Director Andr&eacute; T&eacute;chin&eacute; did a good job with what  he attempted, but could have attempted more.  The cast is good, especially  Marthe Villalonga as the mother and Deneuve, who has aged well.  It's  amusing to see that the cool and stately actress is still being sexually  abused by the French directors for the audience.  I wonder what they would  have done if, instead of Hitchcock, et. al., THEY could have gotten their  hands on Deneuve's cinematic American soul sister, Grace Kelly.  It would  have been interesting to see Grace Kelly in, say, Truffaut's Mississippi  Mermaid (1969) with Jean-Paul Belmondo instead of Deneuve.

186013,A1PA5T5HY0LAMX,1572521716,DG,"[25, 26]","The uneven but always intriguing director Andre Techine has crafted an extremely involving tale of a middle-aged brother and sister (Catherine Deneuve and Daniel Auteuil) who must deal with their elderly mother's  deteriorating health. As a result, old wounds are reopened and family  relationships are all strained to the breaking point. And brother and  sister begin a self-examination that will take them on a rocky (and always  beliveable) journey toward what it means to be family. The story, such as  it is, rambles and changes focus from time to time, but that's the point.  The characters, dialogue and situations are all thoroughly realistic and  anyone who has come through any kind of family crisis will find plenty to  identify with here. On the cinematic side, Techine has exquisitely captured  the beauty of the French countryside, and his use of widescreen is  surprisingly effective for such an intimate piece. Deneuve (who's even more  beautiful than she was 30 years ago, if that's possible) does some of her  best work, and the ever-underrated Auteuil is equally good.

186018,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,1572521716,Marc Cabir Davis,"[8, 16]","Catherine Deneuve's roles are sometimes so simple that she seems to walk through them. Little wonder then that her much acclaimed performance in this film seems nothing more than a casual day at the office. This is the first Deneuve movie I saw since 'Indochine', and though she did a great job in that, her work here both startled and bored me. Not that its a terrible performance, but 'Ma Saison Preferee' does not know what it wants to be. Its one of those open-ended loopy movies that will have art house critics discussing for hours, yet to a serious foreign language film viewer, it ultimately strikes one as a piece of pretentious fluff.The movie stands out in many ways though. It manages to extract a spectacular performance from Daniel Auteuil as the troubled brother, and makes history by introducing us to Deneuve's real life daughter, Chiara, who plays the role of, what else, the daughter.The story is rather simple. Catherine's marriage is dissolving, partly because of the presence of her mother in the house, and partly because she realizes that there is no spark between her husband and herself. There is also a pointless subplot between her son and her secretary, but upon retrospect, this storyline is so weak ...that its not even worth mentioning. Lets just say that we've seen Deneuve and Auteuil in far superior work than this. Auteuil's performance is perhaps the only reason we go on caring about the film. The main theme of the movie is the displacement of the mother - neither the son nor the daughter want to keep her, and she is packed off to a retirement home. When its evident that woman is slowly losing her mind and succumbing to her age, Deneuve and Auteuil play good children and take Mommy in again. With a storyline like this, its fairly evident what is about to happen. After the mother passes away, the family comes together once more, each debating around the table what their 'favorite season' is. Catherine then stands up and delivers a heartless poem and the credits roll. Thats about all.I wish I could say something positive about this movie. The only interesting thing about it remains the cinematography. France has rarely looked so gorgeous on film, and there are a few sweet and tender moments, but it doesn't really add up. Marthe Villalonga does a great job playing the sick mother - she is both wicked and has a genuine sense of humor, and as sickness takes over her, its hard not to care. Unfortunately, everytime we begin caring, there is a shift in narrative to the love lives of the children of the house, and this gets a bit grating.There are also certain inexplicable scenes. Granted that when a woman leaves her husband, she may be prone to act in ways alien to her, but when we see Catherine making out with a handsome French stranger on the gardens of the hospital, just because he expresses his interest (by walking up to her and hitching up her skirt) it gets to be a drag.  ...This sort of spur-of-the-moment lovemaking is rather unbelievable.Chiara Mastroianni delivers a plausible performance - we will have to wait for her real screen debut to judge if she is an actress of any great capability. Anthony Prada, who plays Lucien, the son, is the typical French male teen, all too interested in his mothers' beautiful Algerian secretary, who is also associated in a pointless subplot with her own money laundering brother. Anthony, a local schoolboy who was roped into playing the role, has never made another movie thus far.This film reminded me of 'Up at the Villa' and other lazy pieces of that sort. Its not criminal to make a film this directionless, but what is tiring is the same old film making cliches that are incorporated time and time again in movies of this sort. I just saw 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' a few days ago and rediscovered how wonderful French movies can be. 'Ma Saison Preferee' is a middling example of that. I went into this one expecting far too much, and all said and done, the only thing this film resembles is a soppy French mid-day soap opera that has no chance of making a second season.",3,Life in Avant Garde,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,4087,"['Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'roles', 'are', 'sometimes', 'so', 'simple', 'walk', 'Little', 'wonder', 'then', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'performance', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'casual', 'day', 'office', 'first', 'Deneuve', 'movie', 'saw', ""'Indochine"", 'did', 'great', 'job', 'work', 'here', 'startled', 'bored', 'Not', 'terrible', 'performance', 'Saison', 'Preferee', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'open-ended', 'loopy', 'movies', 'will', 'have', 'art', 'house', 'critics', 'discussing', 'hours', 'yet', 'serious', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'viewer', 'ultimately', 'one', 'piece', 'pretentious', 'fluff.The', 'movie', 'out', 'many', 'ways', 'extract', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'troubled', 'brother', 'history', 'introducing', 'Deneuve', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'Chiara', 'who', 'role', 'what', 'else', 'daughter.The', 'story', 'rather', 'simple', 'Catherine', 'marriage', 'dissolving', 'partly', 'presence', 'mother', 'house', 'partly', 'spark', 'husband', 'also', 'pointless', 'subplot', 'son', 'secretary', 'retrospect', 'storyline', 'so', 'weak', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Lets', 'just', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Deneuve', 'Auteuil', 'far', 'superior', 'work', 'Auteuil', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'only', 'reason', 'go', 'caring', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'displacement', 'mother', 'son', 'daughter', 'want', 'keep', 'packed', 'off', 'retirement', 'home', 'When', 'evident', 'woman', 'slowly', 'losing', 'mind', 'succumbing', 'age', 'Deneuve', 'Auteuil', 'play', 'good', 'children', 'take', 'Mommy', 'again', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'evident', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'mother', 'away', 'family', 'together', 'once', 'more', 'debating', 'table', 'what', ""'favorite"", 'season', 'Catherine', 'then', 'up', 'delivers', 'heartless', 'poem', 'credits', 'roll', 'Thats', 'all.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'something', 'positive', 'movie', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'cinematography', 'France', 'rarely', 'looked', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'sweet', 'tender', 'moments', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'up', 'Marthe', 'Villalonga', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'sick', 'mother', 'wicked', 'genuine', 'sense', 'humor', 'sickness', 'hard', 'not', 'care', 'Unfortunately', 'everytime', 'begin', 'caring', 'shift', 'narrative', 'love', 'children', 'house', 'bit', 'are', 'also', 'certain', 'inexplicable', 'scenes', 'Granted', 'when', 'woman', 'husband', 'may', 'be', 'prone', 'act', 'ways', 'alien', 'when', 'see', 'Catherine', 'making', 'out', 'handsome', 'French', 'stranger', 'gardens', 'hospital', 'just', 'interest', 'walking', 'up', 'hitching', 'up', 'skirt', 'be', 'drag', 'sort', 'spur-of-the-moment', 'lovemaking', 'rather', 'unbelievable.Chiara', 'Mastroianni', 'plausible', 'performance', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'real', 'screen', 'debut', 'judge', 'actress', 'great', 'capability', 'Anthony', 'Prada', 'who', 'Lucien', 'son', 'typical', 'French', 'male', 'teen', 'too', 'interested', 'mothers', 'beautiful', 'Algerian', 'secretary', 'who', 'also', 'associated', 'pointless', 'subplot', 'own', 'money', 'laundering', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'local', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'was', 'roped', 'playing', 'role', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'thus', 'far.This', 'film', 'reminded', ""'Up"", 'Villa', 'other', 'lazy', 'pieces', 'sort', 'not', 'criminal', 'make', 'film', 'directionless', 'what', 'tiring', 'same', 'old', 'film', 'making', 'cliches', 'are', 'incorporated', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'movies', 'sort', 'just', 'saw', ""'The"", 'Umbrellas', 'Cherbourg', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'rediscovered', 'how', 'wonderful', 'French', 'movies', 'can', 'be', ""'Ma"", 'Saison', 'Preferee', 'middling', 'example', 'went', 'one', 'expecting', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'said', 'done', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'soppy', 'French', 'mid-day', 'soap', 'opera', 'chance', 'making', 'second', 'season']",N/A

186020,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,1572521716,Turfseer,"[3, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Director Andr&eacute; T&eacute;chin&eacute;'s 'My Favorite Season' is one of those 'oh so French' domestic dramas that will pretty much keep you interested from beginning to end. The subject matter is rather drab however; two adult siblings are forced to make a decision as to what to do with their aging mother, who is exhibiting signs of dementia. The two siblings, Emilie (Catherine Deneuve) and Antoine (Daniel Auteuil), along with a sensational performance by Marthe Villalonga, as Berthe, the aging mother, make the film what it is. The rest is really window dressing.The film begins with Berthe moving in with Emilie, her husband, Bruno, their daughter and adopted son. Emilie hasn't talked to brother Antoine, a brain surgeon, in three years but finally decides to bury the hatchet by visiting him at the hospital where he works. She invites him for dinner so he can visit their mother. We soon learn that all is not very good with Emilie and Bruno's relationship. This is perhaps the weakest part of the film, as their estrangement is never explored in any kind of depth. Emilie merely states to Bruno that he's grown old poorly and soon afterward, Bruno makes it clear that he's angry that Emilie won't share the same bed with him, and he agrees to her suggestion that they separate.Meanwhile, the 'young ones', the daughter, the adopted son and his girlfriend, are shown mainly as a contrast to the gravity of Emilie and Antoine's relationship. Most of the time, the young people engage in trivial pursuits, including a couple of dances in the buff by the girlfriend. When Antoine walks in on the son and his girlfriend making love, we also learn that Antoine is quite tolerant, promising not to reveal their tryst to the parents.Antoine proves to be the most interesting character in the film. While he believes in the philosophy of 'live and let live', he's quite thin-skinned, and often is unable to control his temper. When Bruno accuses Antoine of being cowardly, because he doesn't want to discuss his mother's proposal to draw up a will, they come to blows.When Berthe collapses back at her home, Emilie and Antoine must then decide what to do with their mother. In perhaps the most touching moment in the film, Antoine has a heart-felt conversation with Emilie, after she's taken refuge in a woman's bathroom, following Antoine chastising her for her suggestion that they put their mother in a nursing home. As they both have no choice, the besieged siblings eventually do put their mother in the nursing home but eventually realize that she's deteriorating there and remove her from the debilitating environment.After Antoine learns that Emilie has separated from her husband for good and moves to a hotel, we see him talking to himself, reveling in the fact that his sister has finally left the man who Antoine always regarded as 'no good'. Now Antoine becomes more possessive of Emilie. He even suggests they move in together and Emilie is completely uncomfortable with this idea--in her mind, Antoine may have incestuous feelings for her. From Antoine's point of view, there's nothing wrong acting 'childlike'.A final crisis with the mother unhinges both siblings. Berthe is found to have a lesion on the brain and Emilie accuses Antoine of having ignored her symptoms, and not prevented the present crisis (which involves the mother's imminent demise). Emilie ends up having sex in a park with a young intern at Antoine's hospital while Antoine jumps off his balcony, in a half-hearted suicide attempt.After the mother's funeral, the family has lunch together and a reconciliation between both the siblings and the family at large, appears to be in the offing. Emilie recalls the words to a song she sung as a child. The lyrics begin, 'where is the friend I seek?' And of course, the 'friend' is life itself. And Emilie confesses that she must always summon up the courage to 'wait'--like waiting for Antoine, which ultimately will bring her contentment. But she never quite finds the 'friend' she is seeking, because in the end, our lives end in death, and there is no significance to our lives, due to life's ultimate finality.",4,Sensitive take on siblings' relationship during crisis of mother's encroaching dementia and ultimate demise,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,4193,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Director', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'T', 'eacute', 'eacute', ""'My"", 'Favorite', 'Season', 'one', ""'oh"", 'so', 'French', 'domestic', 'dramas', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'keep', 'interested', 'beginning', 'end', 'subject', 'matter', 'rather', 'drab', 'however', 'two', 'adult', 'siblings', 'are', 'forced', 'make', 'decision', 'what', 'do', 'aging', 'mother', 'who', 'exhibiting', 'signs', 'dementia', 'two', 'siblings', 'Emilie', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'Antoine', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'sensational', 'performance', 'Marthe', 'Villalonga', 'Berthe', 'aging', 'mother', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'rest', 'really', 'window', 'dressing.The', 'film', 'Berthe', 'moving', 'Emilie', 'husband', 'Bruno', 'daughter', 'adopted', 'son', 'Emilie', ""n't"", 'talked', 'brother', 'Antoine', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'three', 'years', 'finally', 'bury', 'hatchet', 'visiting', 'hospital', 'where', 'dinner', 'can', 'visit', 'mother', 'soon', 'learn', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Emilie', 'Bruno', 'relationship', 'perhaps', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'estrangement', 'never', 'explored', 'kind', 'depth', 'Emilie', 'merely', 'Bruno', 'grown', 'old', 'poorly', 'soon', 'afterward', 'Bruno', 'clear', 'angry', 'Emilie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'bed', 'suggestion', 'separate.Meanwhile', ""'young"", 'ones', 'daughter', 'adopted', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'shown', 'mainly', 'contrast', 'gravity', 'Emilie', 'Antoine', 'relationship', 'Most', 'time', 'young', 'people', 'engage', 'trivial', 'pursuits', 'including', 'couple', 'dances', 'buff', 'girlfriend', 'When', 'Antoine', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'making', 'love', 'also', 'learn', 'Antoine', 'quite', 'tolerant', 'promising', 'not', 'reveal', 'tryst', 'parents.Antoine', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'philosophy', ""'live"", 'let', 'live', 'quite', 'thin-skinned', 'often', 'unable', 'control', 'temper', 'When', 'Bruno', 'Antoine', 'being', 'cowardly', ""n't"", 'want', 'discuss', 'mother', 'proposal', 'draw', 'up', 'will', 'come', 'blows.When', 'Berthe', 'back', 'home', 'Emilie', 'Antoine', 'must', 'then', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'mother', 'perhaps', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'film', 'Antoine', 'heart-felt', 'conversation', 'Emilie', 'taken', 'refuge', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'following', 'Antoine', 'chastising', 'suggestion', 'put', 'mother', 'nursing', 'home', 'have', 'choice', 'besieged', 'siblings', 'eventually', 'do', 'put', 'mother', 'nursing', 'home', 'eventually', 'realize', 'deteriorating', 'there', 'remove', 'debilitating', 'environment.After', 'Antoine', 'Emilie', 'separated', 'husband', 'good', 'moves', 'hotel', 'see', 'talking', 'reveling', 'fact', 'sister', 'finally', 'left', 'man', 'who', 'Antoine', 'always', 'regarded', ""'no"", 'good', 'Now', 'Antoine', 'more', 'possessive', 'Emilie', 'even', 'move', 'together', 'Emilie', 'completely', 'uncomfortable', 'idea', 'mind', 'Antoine', 'may', 'have', 'incestuous', 'feelings', 'Antoine', 'point', 'view', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'acting', 'final', 'crisis', 'mother', 'siblings', 'Berthe', 'found', 'have', 'lesion', 'brain', 'Emilie', 'Antoine', 'having', 'ignored', 'symptoms', 'not', 'prevented', 'present', 'crisis', 'mother', 'imminent', 'demise', 'Emilie', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'park', 'young', 'intern', 'Antoine', 'hospital', 'Antoine', 'balcony', 'half-hearted', 'suicide', 'mother', 'funeral', 'family', 'lunch', 'together', 'reconciliation', 'siblings', 'family', 'large', 'be', 'offing', 'Emilie', 'words', 'song', 'sung', 'child', 'lyrics', 'begin', 'friend', 'seek', 'course', ""'friend"", 'life', 'Emilie', 'must', 'always', 'summon', 'up', 'courage', ""'wait"", 'waiting', 'Antoine', 'ultimately', 'will', 'bring', 'contentment', 'never', 'quite', ""'friend"", 'seeking', 'end', 'lives', 'end', 'death', 'significance', 'lives', 'due', 'life', 'ultimate', 'finality']",N/A
