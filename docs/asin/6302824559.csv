He seemed so natural that you forget he's acting... and isn't that the mark of a good actor.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, and in this reviewers eyes his best role to date.Along with another '80's ""B"" comedy, Running Scared (I wish that Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines had done more comedies together while Hines was still alive,) Real Genius is one of my all time favorite movies, though ""Genius"" has a much better ending.  It's so watchable.  I've seen it literally hundreds of times myself.  It's an intelligently written and performed little comedy produced by Martha Coolidge, Real Genius has since become something of an icon.  It contains both the subtle and the non-subtle.  Though dated, the script, which is very well written, and most of the soundtrack holds up well under the test of time, I think.Without the advent of HBO and Cinemax in the '80's that played it over and over and over, this film might have been missed by many, including this reviewer.  Though expensive for a twenty year old movie, it is well worth it in my opinion.  You won't be sorry unless you insist on watching mindless comedies (""Dumb and Dumber"" comes to mind. The title says it all here.)There are lots of movies that fit that description.

Evolving over time into a cult classic, this can be classified as more of a generational film. Most of the people I know who grew up in the 1980s have seen it. As such, it meets the criteria to be defined as a must see movie...When fourteen-year-old Mitch Taylor (Gabriel Jarret) receives entrance into a highly prestigious college program at Pacific Tech, he's put to work by his mentor Professor Jerry Hathaway (William Atherton) on a highly experimental and difficult project - the development of a specific type of laser. But Mitch's studies are hindered by his more laid back roommate, Chris Knight (Val Kilmer), who would rather use his genius brain to have fun rather than be used by people. Explaining that he used to be just like Mitch, he one day learned that you can't through all of life with your nose in a book.Garnering great influence with Mitch, Chris and the rest of the students engage in some crafty shenanigans (such as turning the dorm room floor to ice - ice that turns from solid to liquid). But Chris and Mitch are foiled by the Prof. Hathaway kiss-up, loser Kent Torokvei (Robert Prescott) who is always shadowing their activities and telling Hathaway. When Mitch meets up with Jordan (Michelle Meyrink) at an auditorium where the orchestra pit has been turned into a pool, the two develop a romance. But the party is crashed by Hathaway who threatens to send Mitch home.With the military applying pressure on Hathaway to complete the laser project, he threatens to fail Chris. With Chris and Mitch working around the clock, the project makes great progress. But the team has to enlist the help of Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries), an eccentric former student who lives in their closet, before they make the breakthrough discovery that gives them an operational laser.Celebrating out on the town, the team ponders the implications of the laser they have created. Realizing that it will be used for assassinations, they run back to lab only to find the laser missing. When they unleash a plan to get revenge on Prof. Hathaway, Kent and the professor's house become part of a great popcorn experiment...Rife with a number of hilarious scenes, one of the more hilarious is when Mitch, Chris, Jordan, and their friend Ick gas Kent and insert a microphone in his mouth. They then speak to Kent, pretending to be God. The entire movie is worth that scene alone, but there are countless others in this popular teen classic.

If you've never seen this movie, I recommend it for its charm, intelligence and sense of fun. I never realized it was rated PG. One could argue that ratings were more fast and loose in the 80s but in truth, this film is well written and though there is suggestion, the adult content never goes as far as the average television show of today.

339743,AUHG8KSHI529U,6302824559,Craig Matteson,"[14, 15]","This is one of those movies that stays fun no matter how many times you see it year after year.  Val Kilmer had made a couple of movies before this one, but this was his breakout role as the genius Chris Knight - a senior in college working on a project for his professor that he is largely indifferent to completing.  Along comes the underage freshman, Mitch Taylor (wonderfully played by Gabriel Jarrett), who has been recruited to help finish the project.The movie is really about Mitch finding his way in a high-pressure college situation.  He endures Kent, the jerk that tortures him and who works in the same lab.  Kent is not untalented, but not a genius like Chris or Mitch and resents the favoritism genius claims.  Kent tries to get attention by sucking up to Prof. Hathaway (brilliantly played in all his corruption by William Atherton), but never gets what he is seeking.As just one minor example of the riches in this movie is the scene when Mitch is going to a packed math class.  Soon people start bringing small tape recorders to class and not attending.  Mitch is one of the few actually listening to the prof.  Finally, Mitch is the only one in the class, even the prof becomes a reel-to-reel tape player with a sign attached that says encourages the students to listen carefully.  While changes in technology would make that scene impossible today, it is still wonderfully effective.Mitch also meets Jordan, a girl who is so hyperactive she doesn't sleep, finds time to invent things as well as resurface the floor in her dorm room.  Jordan is magnificently played by Michelle Myrink and is one of those characters you wish you knew in real life as a friend.  Although, frankly, Jordan would be exhausting to know.  But her intelligence, innocence and kindness would more than compensate for the energy you would have to expend keeping up with her.The movie is populated with wonderful characters of all sorts.  The plot is hung on a very 80s theme, but that's OK, the final scene draws it all together in spectacular and funny way.A classic.",5,Lasing a stick of dynamite!,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2061,"['one', 'movies', 'stays', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'year', 'year', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'had', 'made', 'couple', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'breakout', 'role', 'genius', 'Chris', 'Knight', 'senior', 'college', 'working', 'project', 'professor', 'largely', 'indifferent', 'completing', 'underage', 'freshman', 'Mitch', 'Taylor', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Gabriel', 'Jarrett', 'who', 'been', 'recruited', 'help', 'finish', 'project.The', 'movie', 'really', 'Mitch', 'finding', 'way', 'high-pressure', 'college', 'situation', 'Kent', 'jerk', 'who', 'same', 'lab', 'Kent', 'not', 'untalented', 'not', 'genius', 'Chris', 'Mitch', 'favoritism', 'genius', 'claims', 'Kent', 'get', 'attention', 'sucking', 'up', 'Prof.', 'Hathaway', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'corruption', 'William', 'Atherton', 'never', 'what', 'seeking.As', 'just', 'one', 'minor', 'example', 'riches', 'movie', 'scene', 'when', 'Mitch', 'going', 'packed', 'math', 'class', 'Soon', 'people', 'start', 'bringing', 'small', 'tape', 'recorders', 'class', 'not', 'attending', 'Mitch', 'one', 'few', 'actually', 'listening', 'prof', 'Finally', 'Mitch', 'only', 'one', 'class', 'even', 'prof', 'reel-to-reel', 'tape', 'player', 'sign', 'attached', 'students', 'listen', 'carefully', 'changes', 'technology', 'would', 'make', 'scene', 'impossible', 'today', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'effective.Mitch', 'also', 'Jordan', 'girl', 'who', 'so', 'hyperactive', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'time', 'invent', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'resurface', 'floor', 'dorm', 'room', 'Jordan', 'magnificently', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Myrink', 'one', 'characters', 'wish', 'knew', 'real', 'life', 'friend', 'frankly', 'Jordan', 'would', 'be', 'exhausting', 'know', 'intelligence', 'innocence', 'kindness', 'would', 'more', 'compensate', 'energy', 'would', 'have', 'expend', 'keeping', 'up', 'her.The', 'movie', 'populated', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'sorts', 'plot', 'hung', 'very', '80s', 'theme', 'OK', 'final', 'scene', 'together', 'spectacular', 'funny', 'way.A', 'classic']",N/A

Overblown, over-acted characters, stiffen this superficial take on science, with short interludes of human sensitivity, not enough to save this from the scrap heap of 80's Failures-to- achieve.It starts as a ""War Games""hybrid, then segues into ""Animal House,"" when a lone ingenue steals the farce with touching humanness, then it scoots forward for the revenge of the nerds.This is simply a patchwork of other work. Had the writer known anything about Richard Feynmann's life, these stressed-out nerds could have been grounded in truth instead of ludicrousness.

339785,A60074ZOWMQGX,6302824559,Joe Banks,"[1, 1]","Real Genius is one of my favorite 80s films.  If for no other reason than the fast-paced story, razor sharp one-liners, and brilliant pranks. For example, the revenge visited on Dr. Hathaway at the end is perhaps the most perfect in comedy history (even better than the Animal House finale).  Real Genius deftly pulls off what few films have managed to do--it makes it cool to be a techno geek.  Revenge of the Nerds attempted the same thing, but its approach was much more ham-handed.  The characters are well done, especially Dr. Hathaway, Chris Knight (Val Kilmer at his best), Kent, and a surpringly hot Jordan (played by the hyperkinetic Michelle Meyrink).  The dialog is also top notch, even for the minor characters (Dr. H- ""I noticed your stuttering has improved, Brody."".  B- ""I've been giving myself shock treatments."", Dr. H - ""Up the voltage."").  As an extra bonus, it features a memorable mid-80s soundtrack too.Despite all that, I subtracted one star for the film's ending, which is totally divorced from reality.  Lets face it--there is nothing wrong or illegal with using science to build weapons--it happens all the time.  In real-life, the aftermath of these events would have resulted in Chris, Mitch, and Jordan going to Federal Prison (for sabatoging a multi-million $$ DOD test), Kent going blind (his retinas surely burned out from staring directly at the laser beam), and Dr. Hathaway suing the Air Force for professional and personal damages (the test would have gone fine if base security wasn't so shoddy).

Maillard ""Digital Enthusiast""","[81, 82]","""Real Genius"", along with Amy Heckerling's brilliant ""Johnny Dangerously"", is one of those comedies that never seemed to grasp the audience of other famous '80s flicks like ""Caddyshack"" or ""Back to School"". Well, now that it's on DVD, it's a perfect time to see what you've been missing.""Real Genius"" is a simple story really. It's about a 15-year-old whiz named Mitch who goes off to this technology school, where's he's forced to fit in with all of the other brainiacs who spend most of their time simply being smart. While there, he meets up with fellow genius Chris Knight, played with full gusto by Val Kilmer. Chris and Mitch are hand-picked by their professor and head genius, Jerry Hathaway, to lead a team of students that will develop a laser. Seemingly harmless, the team later learns that Hathaway has his own agenda for the laser (actually, the military's agenda), and they attempt to spoil the plot as only really smart kids can.Mitch and Chris' on-screen chemistry works, simply because as Chris puts it, ""I was just like you."" Kilmer's Chris Knight is the rebel of the group, scheming against the brown-nosing Kent and causing Hathaway's major headaches throughout the film. Kilmer's facial expressions are some of the best of the decade, and he's got some classic lines to boot. It's too bad Kilmer went on to things like ""The Saint"". His best work is in ""Real Genius"". Consider this: When Hathaway tells him he needs to be ""seeing more of him at the lab,"" Kilmer replies, ""Fine. I'll gain weight."" Oh yeah, comedy baby.So if you haven't seen ""Real Genius"" yet, I urge you to rent the DVD when it arrives.

It is full of subtle and not so subtle satire on society, such as the botched saying (""like shooting ducks in a barrel"") in the slick video boardroom presentation for the weapon concept, and the remark from one general after hearing about having a working weapon system by June - ""Don't ask me, I haven't had a working weapon system since Korea.""I can't add anything about the Cal Tech trivia, but it did seem to me that the limo used for the weapon test looked an awful lot like JFK's ill-fated Dallas limo. Veiled commentary about the Military-Industrial Complex?There is, of course, lots of geek/college humor, but nothing really gross. The sexual humor and references are pretty light, well handled, and fit in with the story. The humor covers the social commentary well, and the film makes its statements without preaching.

Too many brain cells means no party and no ""fun.""When Jerry threatens Chris to get his act together and solve the power problem, Chris as usual dooesn't take him seriously until Jerry also threatens to not allow Chris to graduate. The mad dash to create the ultimate weapon (looks a lot like the old Star Wars project from the Reagan years), to making this semester count with the usual college antics (turning the floor into a ice that turns to gas, going after beauticians, taking apart a car and reassembling it in a dorm bedroom, and inserting a listening device and microphone in the braces.What follows up to the hijinks and laughs is when Chris, Lazlo (a middle aged student), Jordan, and Mitch find out the plans of the mad professor Dr. Hathaway (Atherton). They make a plan to try to stop the professor, leak it out to the local representatives and also end it with a laugh.Lots of laughs and hijinks in what you would think would include nudity, but surprisingly; there is none. The picture and sound are great. There are no extras like deleted scenes, director's commentary and/or outakes. Just the usual interactive menu, theatrical coming attraction. This DVD includes both Widescreen and Fullscreen. If you like comedies, this is a great addition to your DVD library. If you like college hijinks and have Animal House and/or Revenge of the Nerds; you will like this one. The laughs are spread out and while it's not hillarious; it is a funny movie.",5,"""Socrates said it best, I drank what?""",1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,2424,"['lot', 'not', 'most', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', '80', 'was', 'one', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Saint', 'Chris', 'Knight', 'college', 'student', 'very', 'prestigious', 'school', 'professor', 'create', 'highly', 'classified', 'laser', 'weapon', 'Chris', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'team', 'have', 'create', 'laser', 'just', 'need', 'build', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'spaceship', 'can', 'target', 'anything', 'earth', 'Working', 'long', 'side', 'Kent', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'who', 'also', 'Jerry', 'William', 'Atherton', 'Ghostbusters', 'Die', 'Hard', 'movies', 'rear', 'Kent', 'Chris', 'are', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'Kerry', 'better', 'side', 'sleek', 'job', 'Chris', 'slacker', 'fools', 'lot', 'Kent', 'solve', 'power', 'problem', 'laser', 'same', 'time', 'said', 'kiss', 'Jerry', 'rear', 'Jerry', 'smart', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Mitch', 'Gabe', 'Jarrett', 'work', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'get', 'Mitch', 'mellow', 'out', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Too', 'many', 'brain', 'cells', 'party', 'fun', 'When', 'Jerry', 'Chris', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'solve', 'power', 'problem', 'Chris', 'usual', 'dooes', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'Jerry', 'also', 'not', 'allow', 'Chris', 'graduate', 'mad', 'dash', 'create', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'lot', 'old', 'Star', 'Wars', 'project', 'Reagan', 'years', 'making', 'semester', 'count', 'usual', 'college', 'antics', 'turning', 'floor', 'ice', 'gas', 'going', 'beauticians', 'taking', 'apart', 'car', 'reassembling', 'dorm', 'bedroom', 'inserting', 'listening', 'device', 'microphone', 'braces.What', 'up', 'hijinks', 'laughs', 'when', 'Chris', 'Lazlo', 'middle', 'aged', 'student', 'Jordan', 'Mitch', 'find', 'out', 'plans', 'mad', 'professor', 'Dr.', 'Hathaway', 'Atherton', 'make', 'plan', 'try', 'stop', 'professor', 'leak', 'out', 'local', 'representatives', 'also', 'end', 'laugh.Lots', 'laughs', 'hijinks', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'include', 'nudity', 'surprisingly', 'none', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'and/or', 'outakes', 'Just', 'usual', 'interactive', 'menu', 'theatrical', 'coming', 'attraction', 'DVD', 'Widescreen', 'Fullscreen', 'like', 'comedies', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library', 'like', 'college', 'hijinks', 'have', 'Animal', 'House', 'and/or', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'laughs', 'are', 'spread', 'not', 'hillarious', 'funny', 'movie']",N/A

Any film that features a memorable moment like Deborah Foreman's articulation of her standards for a male companion, a memorable character like Michelle Meyrink's hyper-kinetic Jordon, and the memorable sight of a house exploding from the force of a giant Jiffy Pop container can never be forgotten.And who doesn't feel good just watching the neighborhood kids play in a mountain of popcorn to the sound of Tears For Fears' ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"".Although ""Real Genius"" has not totally escaped the ravages of the past 20 years, it has held up reasonably well. Now it can even be appreciated as a sort of time capsule, demonstrating rather strikingly the complete computerization of the applied sciences that has occurred during the relatively short time period since its 1985 release.

""Real Genius"" is a prime example of this. When released in 1985, it was buried by two other sci-fi comedies also released that summer: ""My Science Project"" and ""Weird Science."" I remember one movie critic calling that summer the summer of ""My real genius weird science project."" Also to the film's detriment was the fact that it boasted no established stars (Kilmer had not yet made his mark). The result was that it came and went away rather quickly.It wasn't until it debuted on cable that people caught on to what a funny and engrossing film it was. Wiliam Atherton, fresh from his great heel performance as the EPA official in ""Ghostbusters,"" plays Jerome Hathaway, a media-renowned physicist who collects prodigies like others collect baseball cards. The reason: to build a laser weapon he is developing in conjunction with a the CIA. The kids build the laser and he collects the monies, most of which comes under the table. To his consternation, the CIA has bumped up the delivery date for the weapon and he must get his students to work harder and faster.His problem is that his lead prodigy, Chirs Knight (Val Kilmer) is having a crisis of mission in life. Once believing in nothing else than his studies and work, he has come to a change of mind. Worse yet for Dr. Hathaway, the young genius he has recently recruited, 15-year old Mitch Taylor (Gabe Jarrett) is rooming with Knight and is picking up his philosophy of life. Taylor learns that the reason for Knight's change of mind has come from Holyfeld, an ex-student who lives in the steam rooms below campus, to which the only entrance is through Chris and Mitch's closet...Yes, it's a thin plot, and yes, they do build Hathaway's pet project, but we get so caught up in the characters that we lose track of the plot because we're too busy laughing.

He plays one of the main characters, Chris Knight, a brilliant student who never takes his work too seriously & has a crazy fashion sense (including wearing fuzzy slippers & novelty antennae). Kilmer clearly has a field day here, playing a ""loose cannon"" who seems strongly connected with the brilliant but undisciplined/quip-filled Hawkeye Pierce of ""Mash"".

It is then Kilmer's job to introduce a little fun to the straight-laced 15-year old...before he ""melts down"" like former resident Lazlo (who pops mysteriously in/out of a closet).There's a wide assortment of eccentric characters (naturally): Nerdy whiner Kent (who's sort of a comic rival here in the ""Frank Burns"" mold); the already mentioned former genius/recluse Lazlo; Mitch's object of affection, a girl who never sleeps & who jumps around & speed-talks like a waitress at Starbucks. Of course, lest we forget William Atherton, the ""all-purpose villain of the 80's"" at his snivelling best here.Director Martha Coolidge showed real finesse with handling her story. She had enough common sense not to take things too seriously & keep it loose, while at the same time, didn't allow the story to bog down into a ""big-bad-military-using-weapons-of-mass-destruction"" morality play. There is a genuine sense of fun here.This is an enjoyable comedy, and surprisingly, it hasn't really dated at all.",5,"Underrated; a goofball comedy with ""smarts""",1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1835,"['been', 'years', 'watched', 'endearingly', 'goofy', 'little', '80', 'comedy', 'group', 'misfit', 'whiz-kids', 'Professor', 'creating', 'deadly', 'military', 'weapon', 'profit', 'Top', 'Secret', 'sorely', 'underrated', 'film', 'coincidentally', 'young', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'stars', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Chris', 'Knight', 'brilliant', 'student', 'who', 'never', 'work', 'too', 'seriously', 'crazy', 'fashion', 'sense', 'including', 'wearing', 'fuzzy', 'slippers', 'novelty', 'antennae', 'Kilmer', 'clearly', 'field', 'day', 'here', 'playing', 'loose', 'cannon', 'who', 'strongly', 'connected', 'brilliant', 'undisciplined/quip-filled', 'Hawkeye', 'Pierce', 'Mash', 'Gabe', 'Jarrett', 'who', 'somehow', 'dropped', 'radar', 'film', 'equally', 'good', 'more', 'straight', 'man', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'Mitch', 'new', 'whiz-kid', 'assigned', 'project', 'then', 'Kilmer', 'job', 'introduce', 'little', 'fun', 'straight-laced', '15-year', 'old', 'melts', 'down', 'former', 'resident', 'Lazlo', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'in/out', 'closet', 'wide', 'assortment', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'naturally', 'Nerdy', 'whiner', 'Kent', 'who', 'sort', 'comic', 'rival', 'here', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'mold', 'already', 'mentioned', 'former', 'genius/recluse', 'Lazlo', 'Mitch', 'object', 'affection', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'sleeps', 'who', 'jumps', 'speed-talks', 'waitress', 'Starbucks', 'course', 'forget', 'William', 'Atherton', 'all-purpose', 'villain', '80', 'snivelling', 'best', 'here.Director', 'Martha', 'Coolidge', 'showed', 'real', 'finesse', 'handling', 'story', 'had', 'enough', 'common', 'sense', 'not', 'take', 'things', 'too', 'seriously', 'keep', 'loose', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'story', 'bog', 'down', 'big-bad-military-using-weapons-of-mass-destruction', 'morality', 'play', 'genuine', 'sense', 'fun', 'here.This', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'really', 'dated']",N/A

339841,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,6302824559,The Night Falcon,"[1, 1]","My own background is heavy in the arts and sciences, even coming out of college. This film is for those of us who can equate to the technical mind set and that type of journey through life.This film is light hearted with its premise. Even the scene in the dorm where they fill the hallways with ice, so they can ""body slide"" the halls on the ice, reminds me of some of the things done at my college dorm so long ago.If you think the pranks done in this movie don't happen in college, here are some examples of things I saw in my own college days while living on campus. One day someone put a vaseline slick on the carpet, so if you came running down the hallway, you'd be sliding down the length of hallway on your butt. (lol) On another occasion, I passed a trash barrel full of water vicariously and precisely balanced up against someone's door so that when they opened the door, the barrel would fall on them saturating them in water.Then there was that one morning I woke to use the central bathroom down the hall and could not get out of my dorm room. I simply could not make the door knob turn, as though it were locked.  Neither could my room mate. So I climbed out on the window ledge, two stories up no less on the narrow ledge, and got in through someone elses window, whose door was operating.  As I stepped into the hallway, I could hear all the door knobs turning as each person was trying to get out of their room.  What I learned was that some engineer had stuck pennies inbetween each door and door lip creating enough pressure so that the door knob would not turn.  As I freed each person from each dorm, using a kitchen knife to pop out the pennies, I discovered that some doors were three penny doors, some were six penny doors; some were in betweeners. I couldn't stop laughing.  I think I made about 45 cents that morning for my trouble and eventually got to use the bathroom when everyone else was done. This happened in just my freshman year.In my senior year, while living with three other guys sharing an off campus apartment, one of my room mates decided to play a prank on me.  One of our teachers kept a life size Marylyn Monroe manikin in his office.  My friend Jym had come to me proposing I join him, and a few others, in sneaking into the office and steal the manikin.  I turned him down on that offer and when I didn't join him, by the weekend, when I came in from classes one Friday evening, and climbed the stairs to the two level apartment we shared, to my bedroom, I found Marylyn; lying in my bed in a seductive pose, with my desk light covered in a red gel to mimic the red light district. (chuckling)At that moment I didn't find it funny. Jym and his buddies could not stop laughing.  After awhile I did laugh and suggested we send a randsom note telling the teacher if our demands were not met, we would take the pieces apart and send the teacher on a treasure hunt, all over campus, to find all the parts.  In short, I have a few of my own college prank stories to tell. All of them are good memories 30 years later regardless.  I've tried my whole life not to take life too seriously.  Afterall, none us are getting out of it alive in the end.I suppose if any of us had thought of it, we would have filled the hallways with ice, like they showed in this movie. The scene at the end of the film, showing the giant ""Jiffy Pop"" corn popper is a classic gag. Maybe U.S. leaders should learn from this scene, when it comes to dealing with people like Sedom Hussain, for instance. Instead of skud missling the enemy, maybe U.S. forces should have sent a heat ray into his home, after sending him a giant Jiffy Pop popper via International carrier and laid him out with a ton of Jiffy pop popcorn! You have to see the movie to appreciate what I'm talking about. I could not stop laughing when I first saw the gag done with the first viewing of this film.The Amazon summary pretty well gives you the story. I'm just filling in some of the movie's highlights. Overall its a fun 80's film to watch. Val Kilmer was cute when this was made; so are the young college gals during the party scene. Makes me wish I was young again. Reminds me of all the fun times I had in college pursuing my technical studies.So if you like a light hearted, fun story and a good laugh, then this film is for you. I certainly enjoyed it very much.",5,Loved the gags!,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,4358,"['own', 'background', 'heavy', 'arts', 'sciences', 'even', 'coming', 'college', 'film', 'who', 'can', 'equate', 'technical', 'mind', 'set', 'type', 'journey', 'life.This', 'film', 'light', 'hearted', 'premise', 'Even', 'scene', 'dorm', 'where', 'fill', 'hallways', 'ice', 'can', 'body', 'slide', 'halls', 'ice', 'things', 'done', 'college', 'dorm', 'so', 'long', 'think', 'pranks', 'done', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'college', 'here', 'are', 'examples', 'things', 'saw', 'own', 'college', 'days', 'living', 'campus', 'One', 'day', 'someone', 'put', 'vaseline', 'slick', 'carpet', 'so', 'came', 'running', 'down', 'hallway', ""'d"", 'be', 'sliding', 'length', 'hallway', 'butt', 'lol', 'occasion', 'passed', 'trash', 'barrel', 'full', 'water', 'vicariously', 'precisely', 'balanced', 'up', 'someone', 'door', 'so', 'when', 'opened', 'door', 'barrel', 'would', 'fall', 'saturating', 'water.Then', 'was', 'one', 'morning', 'woke', 'use', 'central', 'bathroom', 'hall', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'dorm', 'room', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'door', 'knob', 'turn', 'were', 'locked', 'could', 'room', 'mate', 'So', 'climbed', 'out', 'window', 'ledge', 'two', 'stories', 'less', 'narrow', 'ledge', 'got', 'someone', 'elses', 'window', 'door', 'was', 'operating', 'stepped', 'hallway', 'could', 'hear', 'door', 'knobs', 'turning', 'person', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'room', 'What', 'learned', 'was', 'engineer', 'had', 'stuck', 'pennies', 'inbetween', 'door', 'door', 'lip', 'creating', 'enough', 'pressure', 'door', 'knob', 'would', 'not', 'turn', 'freed', 'person', 'dorm', 'using', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'pop', 'out', 'pennies', 'discovered', 'doors', 'were', 'three', 'penny', 'doors', 'were', 'six', 'penny', 'doors', 'were', 'betweeners', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'think', 'made', 'about', '45', 'cents', 'morning', 'trouble', 'eventually', 'got', 'use', 'bathroom', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'done', 'happened', 'just', 'freshman', 'year.In', 'senior', 'year', 'living', 'three', 'other', 'guys', 'sharing', 'off', 'campus', 'apartment', 'one', 'room', 'decided', 'play', 'prank', 'One', 'teachers', 'kept', 'life', 'size', 'Marylyn', 'Monroe', 'manikin', 'office', 'friend', 'Jym', 'had', 'come', 'proposing', 'join', 'few', 'others', 'sneaking', 'office', 'steal', 'manikin', 'turned', 'down', 'offer', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'join', 'weekend', 'when', 'came', 'classes', 'one', 'Friday', 'evening', 'climbed', 'stairs', 'two', 'level', 'apartment', 'shared', 'bedroom', 'found', 'Marylyn', 'lying', 'bed', 'seductive', 'pose', 'desk', 'light', 'covered', 'red', 'gel', 'mimic', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'chuckling', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'Jym', 'buddies', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'did', 'laugh', 'suggested', 'send', 'randsom', 'note', 'telling', 'teacher', 'demands', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'would', 'take', 'pieces', 'apart', 'send', 'teacher', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'campus', 'find', 'parts', 'short', 'have', 'few', 'own', 'college', 'prank', 'stories', 'tell', 'are', 'good', 'memories', '30', 'years', 'later', 'regardless', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'whole', 'life', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'too', 'seriously', 'Afterall', 'none', 'are', 'getting', 'alive', 'end.I', 'suppose', 'had', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'filled', 'hallways', 'ice', 'showed', 'movie', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'showing', 'giant', 'Jiffy', 'Pop', 'corn', 'popper', 'classic', 'gag', 'Maybe', 'U.S.', 'leaders', 'should', 'learn', 'scene', 'when', 'dealing', 'people', 'Sedom', 'Hussain', 'instance', 'Instead', 'skud', 'missling', 'enemy', 'maybe', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'should', 'have', 'sent', 'heat', 'ray', 'home', 'sending', 'giant', 'Jiffy', 'Pop', 'popper', 'International', 'carrier', 'laid', 'out', 'ton', 'Jiffy', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'gag', 'done', 'first', 'viewing', 'film.The', 'Amazon', 'summary', 'pretty', 'well', 'story', ""'m"", 'just', 'filling', 'movie', 'highlights', 'Overall', 'fun', '80', 'film', 'watch', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'was', 'cute', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'are', 'young', 'college', 'gals', 'party', 'scene', 'Makes', 'wish', 'was', 'young', 'again', 'fun', 'times', 'had', 'college', 'pursuing', 'technical', 'studies.So', 'like', 'light', 'hearted', 'fun', 'story', 'good', 'laugh', 'then', 'film', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much']",N/A
