Her friend Bok nam has changed a lot and is abused both sexually and physically by her husbands crazy family. The episodes of abuse are quite horrific and very depressing.  Bedevilled can be categorized as a horror film because the violence is filled with gore.

The film itself is a very powerful and intense study of suffering, reaching your limit and brutal, savage revenge. South Korean cinema never ceases to amaze and astound me. If you enjoyed South Korean films like ""Howling"", ""Helpless"", ""The Chaser"", ""The Isle"", ""Memories of Murder"", ""Mother"", ""Secret Sunshine"", ""Mowhere To Hide"", ""Old Boy"", ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance"", and ""Lady Vengeance"", then ""Bedevilled"" is right up your alley. I will buy Well Go Usa's blu-ray in appreciation for them releasing this intense film in the United States. I REALLY HOPE that Well Go USA picks up the South Korean film ""Howling"" (2012) next, starring Song Kang-Ho (who starred in films like ""The Host"", ""Memories of Murder"", ""Hindsight"", ""Thirst"", ""The Quiet Family"", ""Secret Sunshine"" and ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance""). ""Bedevilled"" and ""Howling"" are MUST-SEE films! South Korea's ""Helpless"" and ""The Cat"" aka ""Two Eyes That See Death"" are also 2 newer South Korean films worth seeing.

1437280,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0051S1FDM,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 3]","I've said it before, but it bears repeating: slasher-style films are a dime a dozen.  For studios, they tend to be a low-cost investment almost always promising a respectable return.  What varies is the set-up - who's the killer, who's his (or her) backstory, what's the hack-slash-cut weapon of choice, who're the victims, etc.  Of course, those are a lot of variables, and that's primarily why studios will almost always produce some variation on the original formula of ""boy meets girl, girl rejects boy, boy buys machete, town lives in peril.""Hae-won (played by the lovely Seong-won Ji) has one seriously bad day at work, and, after she takes it out on a co-worker, is placed on a forced leave of absence in order to get her life in order.  Distraught and uncertain of what to do next, she decides to travel to Moo-do Island - the home of her youth - where her childhood friend, Bok-nam (Young-hee Seo), still lives with family.  However, Bok-nam has been dealing with stresses all of her own - a philandering husband, a sexually abusive brother-in-law, and a daughter whose the victim of domestic abuse - so she decides to enlist Hae-won in a devious plot: help her escape from the island to Seoul where she will raise her daughter away from the torments of the other island women.  As fate would have it, Bok-nam's sanity is going out of style, and, unless she receives help of some kind, she's about to embrace the kind of madness that goes hand-in-hand with homicide.I'll say this right away: despite a relatively tame first half, BEDEVILLED may not be for everyone.  This isn't to say that the second half is particularly graphic (which it is); it's just to say that, as a revenge picture, it has a very slowly percolating set-up.  In fact, the front half the film - Hae-won's time in Seoul that sets up her work vacation, Hae-won's arrival on Moo-do, and the slow realization of what Bok-nam's existence has become - is necessarily slow; there's a lot of ground to cover - these two women have a history, and some of that is explored via flashbacks as well - and all I can say is that you'll have to trust me when I tell you it's absolutely needed for the film's climax to have the impact it deserves.  While the moments that explore revenge are relatively graphic, I'd maintain that the picture isn't about the glorification of the bloodspray.  Rather, this story is about the descent into madness.  It's an examination of the causes - big and small - that push these women to make the choices they do, and then it's about the consequences of their decisions.That said, both ladies turn in some very impressive performances.  Seong-won Ji brings some tremendous subtlety to her professional haughtiness; she's built walls around her world, and, despite what see witnesses going on in her surroundings, she refuses to invest herself emotionally in anything resembling compassion much less justice.  Also, Young-hee Seo steals the show here, gravitating between two very different performances as the happy-go-lucky island girl who gradually turns into a raving lunatic with one farm tool too many.  It's a brilliantly measured performance, one that pays off quite well in the conclusion though the script flirts with the all-too-clich&eacute; imperviousness most serial killers somehow magically possess.  Also, the supporting cast of quietly oppressive women and physically abusive men each have some fine moments, and it's the ensemble that wins here as each player contributes significantly to the dynamic of the group.Despite the obvious preachiness of the set-up, BEDEVILLED goes somewhere I didn't quite see coming.  It's equally dark and calculating.  Some folks may find it a bit uneven, but, as I've tried to be clear, there are rewards for the patient viewer.  Just don't say I didn't warn you about the violence.BEDEVILLED is produced by Boston Investments, Filma Pictures, Tori Pictures, and the Korean Film Council (in association with).  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through Well Go USA.  The film looks and sounds exceptional; great care went into producing the film, and I'm impressed that as much attention accompanied the disc's manufacture as sound in horror films can make or break the experience ... and this one is worth hearing as well as seeing.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the picture played at the Cannes Independent Film Festival; was the winner for `Best Film' at the 2011 Gerardmer Film Festival; won the `Best New Director' award at the 2010 Grand Bell Awards; and won `Best Actress,' `Best of Puchon,' and `Eterna' awards at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival.  Sadly, as is often the case with these imports, there are no significant special features to speak of; there's a brief 15-minute `making of' special that's mostly a compilation of production efforts.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's more than a bit uneven, but BEDEVILLED is a modern horror story with teeth ... well, sickles, that is.  I would imagine the primary problem with the picture is that the audience drawn to the first half is probably not interested in the second half, and those folks looking for a modern twist on the horror/slasher mythos is probably unmoved by the long (but necessary) social commentary set-up of the first hour-plus.  Still, performances are solid, and, if you're around for the second half when all of the bodies start piling up, you're in for a bloody treat (pun intended).In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA provided me with a DVD screener of BEDEVILLED for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Uncommon Performances Make the Commoners'

1437281,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0051S1FDM,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","It really makes me want to spit when a movie verges on being great only to drop the ball on the five yard line. That's the case here.Here's the scoop. Hae won came from an Island off South Korea to mainland Seoul at a young age. She now works for a bank as is moderately successful but not a really nice person. After a violent office incident she is put on leave. An old friend from the Island, Kim Bok-nom, has been begging her to come visit. She takes this time off to do so, and when she gets there she finds the situation to be less than idyllic.  Her friend, though trying to keep a pleasant demeanor, is unraveling from mental, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband and his brother. She gets no support from the other Islanders or the authorities and one incident drives her over the edge.Up until the climax, this is on of the best movies I've ever seen. The treatment of women is at the heart of things. Hae won's inability (unwillingness?) to finger some thugs who beat up and disfigured a young girl. The treatment her friend receives with no one to turn to for help, and how a seemingly lovely Island is home to such unspeakable acts, builds from the get-go. Kim Bok-nom's husband is a brute. He doles out violence and sexual abuse with impunity. He brings prostitutes to the Island and into his home with his wife right outside the door. He may be sexually abusing her daughter as well. The other women (granny is the nastiest, meanest woman on the planet) not only give her no sympathy whatsoever, they're nearly as mean to her as her husband. That she finally breaks is of little wonder. That's when things fall apart. The beginning of her rampage is very good. Watching her mete out revenge is great for the soul.

After the first hour, it has grabbed your guts without your even noticing it, and it simply won't let go until the very end. The story is quite over the top, that is very much true, but serves perfectly as a vehicle to trigger the deepest, most contradictory emotions. One feels sorry for the killer, feels good when she kills, just can't wait for the victims to be killed as painfully as possible. What a powerful film!! South Korean movie makers are, at this point, among the very best in the world, no doubt about it. Technically impeccable, they have mastered script writing, setting, directing, acting, and all aspects related to this art. Yes, it is entertainment, but is also art, and the most powerful one, as it is able to trigger such hidden, dark emotions. The last shot of the movie (this is not really a spoiler) of the woman body fusing with the profile of the island was so beautiful and unexpected that it truly gave me a real thrill. Then, the images and music as the end titles roll leave you with the most tender and saddest feelings after the almost unbearable realistic horror ride. Realistic not because of the blood, which is generous, but not over the top; realistic because of the way it touches and manipulates, for the best, our darkest emotions.

She is welcomed by her childhood friend, Bok-nam; Bok-nam is treated like a slave by her abusive husband and disrespected daily by the elderly islanders. Eventually, Bok-nam tries to escape which results in tragedy- and she finally snaps with brutal force. Bedevilled is a brutal and haunting revenge thriller.Bedevilled has a dark and brutal story; although Hae-won is a significantly character, Bok-nam really takes center stage. The brutality in this film doesn't only come from her vicious vengeance; Bok-nam is vividly beaten and raped throughout the film without any help, even from her ""childhood friend"". Some of these scenes will infuriate; in fact, the entire film, especially the ending, may leave you shocked/angry. (this feeling will probably be most evident in those that haven't experience South Korean cinema yet.) I won't spoil the ending, all I will say is: I love endings that leave an impact, and this one definitely accomplishes that goal. (stay for the scene during the credits for a more thought-provoking experience.) The acting was great, the direction was brilliant, and the music was amazing. (I really loved the song at the credits.)Overall, Bedevilled is an amazing revenge thriller that manages to leave the audience shocked and unsettled- emotionally and mentally.

1437286,A12VLTA3ZHVPUY,B0051S1FDM,Justice For Humanity,"[0, 0]","This motion picture brings forth the intensity of emotions and brutality into a solid collaboration of film making. The cinematography is sharp, clean, and skillfully shot. The characters give true to life performances that make you love, hate, or pity them. In particular actress Seo Young-hee turns out an extraordinary performance as the character Bok-nam who is a woman scorned to the highest degree. The things she must endure as well as the situations she is put through on the island are jagged and perturbing. As previously mentioned, her performance is stellar.The pacing of this motion picture is first-class. Nothing comes off as rushed or tacked on. The plot is given enough time for character development and set up for various events that unfold. This is a revenge thriller yet the elements of revenge are enacted differently than others of this genre, which therefore ultimately puts more emphasis on the ""thriller"" aspect of the movie than anything else. The violence in the film is of a pragmatic style and used primarily when necessary to emphasize the moments of frustration and intense emotion carried by the cast of characters. Similar to other international films like ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""Old Boy"" this film challenges the viewer in many areas. It creates tension for the audience and gives a sense of uneasiness whilst simultaneously creating a yearning of justice for the main character. It gives a ""thrill"" so to speak, thus providing the viewer a run for their money. By the film's conclusion you will have gained something new from the overall cinematic experience.Overall this is an entertaining motion picture that should not be missed. If you like being challenged as a cinema viewer and looking for raw, intense film-making, and stellar acting performances, then this is for you. However, if you are an oversensitive, timid movie watcher (which there is more than ever these days) then you're better off in the safety zone of PG-13 films.Highly Recommended for Open-Minded Thick-Skinned Audiences!",5,Raw Intense filmmaking....Timid viewers Beware!,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2031,"['motion', 'picture', 'forth', 'intensity', 'emotions', 'brutality', 'solid', 'collaboration', 'film', 'making', 'cinematography', 'sharp', 'clean', 'skillfully', 'shot', 'characters', 'give', 'true', 'life', 'performances', 'make', 'love', 'hate', 'pity', 'particular', 'actress', 'Seo', 'Young-hee', 'out', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'character', 'Bok-nam', 'who', 'woman', 'scorned', 'highest', 'degree', 'things', 'must', 'endure', 'as', 'well', 'situations', 'put', 'island', 'are', 'jagged', 'perturbing', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'performance', 'stellar.The', 'pacing', 'motion', 'picture', 'first-class', 'Nothing', 'off', 'rushed', 'tacked', 'plot', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'set', 'up', 'various', 'events', 'unfold', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'yet', 'elements', 'revenge', 'are', 'enacted', 'differently', 'others', 'genre', 'therefore', 'ultimately', 'more', 'emphasis', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'movie', 'anything', 'else', 'violence', 'film', 'pragmatic', 'style', 'used', 'primarily', 'when', 'necessary', 'emphasize', 'moments', 'frustration', 'intense', 'emotion', 'carried', 'cast', 'characters', 'Similar', 'other', 'international', 'films', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'Old', 'Boy', 'film', 'viewer', 'many', 'areas', 'tension', 'audience', 'sense', 'uneasiness', 'whilst', 'simultaneously', 'creating', 'yearning', 'justice', 'main', 'character', 'thrill', 'so', 'speak', 'thus', 'providing', 'viewer', 'run', 'money', 'film', 'conclusion', 'will', 'have', 'gained', 'something', 'new', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience.Overall', 'entertaining', 'motion', 'picture', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'like', 'being', 'challenged', 'cinema', 'viewer', 'looking', 'raw', 'intense', 'film-making', 'stellar', 'acting', 'performances', 'then', 'However', 'are', 'oversensitive', 'timid', 'movie', 'watcher', 'more', 'ever', 'days', 'then', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'safety', 'zone', 'PG-13', 'films.Highly', 'Recommended', 'Open-Minded', 'Thick-Skinned', 'Audiences']",Bedevilled [Region 2]

Bedevilled is a movie about 2 Women. One who lives in the city and is cold hearted and self centered. She's only concerned about herself and has little regard to how other people feel. The movie begins with Hae-won coldly turning down a loan for a desperate elderly woman. As a result she has a trick played on her by one of the maintenance workers that don't quite agree with her attitude. The entire mishap causes her to assault and blame one of her coworkers who is a lot more kind hearted and concerned about the companies clients. She ends up being forced to take a ""leave"" from work. Along the journey we get to see more of her cold attitude where she witnesses a crime and doesn't care enough to point out the people who did it even though the father of the victim begs her too. She just carries on about her life unconcerned.Hae-won has no where to go on her vacation so she decides to visit the island where her Grandfather lived and where she spent part of her childhood. The island is isolated from the mainland and the community there holds their fare share of secrets. When Hae-won arrives at the island she is visited by her childhood friend Bok-nam. The two girls were once very close but over time drifted apart. Mostly this was forced by Hae-won who never bother to read the letter Bok-nam sent her. On the island Hae-won spends her time learning about how much has changed over time little by little. Bok-nam is a kind hearted woman but is treated like dirt and looked down on by the entire community. They refer to her as ""b#@ch"" and or ""stupid b#@ch"", and make her do the bulk of the labor on the island. Bok-nam is also shared by her husband and her husbands brother who rapes her when he wills it. Bok-nam's husband openly cheats on her by hiring prostitutes and sleeping with them in the presence of herself and her child. There is no respect at all for Bok-nam who is really just a desperate woman that wants to leave the island with her daughter for a better life but can't due to her abusive husband and community that keeps holding her back from leaving.Eventually Hae-won learns about Bok-nam's situation but does little to nothing at all to intervene other than deciding she would like to return home to Seoul early. Bok-nam beg's Hae-won to take her and her daughter with her but she declines and when Bok-nam tells her a sad truth Hae-won accuses her for being a liar. Bok-nam then deperately tries to escape on her own but is caught by her abusive husband who brutally beats her in front of her daughter. That's when the story takes it's turn and story of vengeance begins.Overall Bedevilled is a great movie because it's the first time it shows just how truly selfish some people are. The main character in this movie is just that and even after witnessing a murder she will ignore it and act as though she didn't see a thing just to protect herself. There is a lot of despair and also satisfaction in the film but the ending really speaks volumes as to just who Hae-won is. You find out at the end (maybe a spoiler or not it's not exactly put upfront in the movie) that Bok-nam proteced Hae-won as a kid. She was stronger than her and looked after her. One day when the two are attacked by a group of boys Bok-nam fights them off while Hae-won runs. Unfortunately Bok-nam ends up getting hit over the head and knocked out where she is then sexually molested by the boys. Hae-won just sits behind a tree staring and not attempting to get help.Hae-won has been a ""unkind"" person her entire life and towards the end Bok-nam tries to tell her that. Sadly for Bak-nam everyone has been unkind to her as long as she's been alive. Her only joys in life were her childhood friend Hae-won who turned out to be worthless and her daughter whom she couldn't protect. Every man (but the old guy) she has met has either treated her like dirt or a sex object so the movie hints when she meets someone that isn't from the island and they're kind to her.Bedevilled could be a horror movie,could be a drama, could be suspense, could be a tragic story but really it's all of the above. The only part that the movie didn't play out on was if Bok-nam was in love with Hae-won or if she was just mind warped from seeing another woman that wasn't broken down from working fields all day.Overall this is a good movie well worth watching!",5,A Good Korean Movie!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,4468,"['Actually', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'Korean', 'movies', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'recent', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'Bedevilled', 'movie', '2', 'Women', 'One', 'who', 'city', 'cold', 'hearted', 'centered', 'only', 'concerned', 'herself', 'little', 'regard', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'feel', 'movie', 'Hae-won', 'coldly', 'turning', 'down', 'loan', 'desperate', 'elderly', 'woman', 'result', 'trick', 'played', 'one', 'maintenance', 'workers', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'agree', 'attitude', 'entire', 'mishap', 'assault', 'blame', 'one', 'coworkers', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'kind', 'hearted', 'concerned', 'companies', 'clients', 'up', 'being', 'forced', 'take', 'leave', 'work', 'journey', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'cold', 'attitude', 'where', 'crime', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'point', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'even', 'father', 'victim', 'too', 'just', 'life', 'unconcerned.Hae-won', 'where', 'go', 'vacation', 'visit', 'island', 'where', 'Grandfather', 'lived', 'where', 'spent', 'part', 'childhood', 'island', 'isolated', 'mainland', 'community', 'there', 'fare', 'share', 'secrets', 'When', 'Hae-won', 'arrives', 'island', 'visited', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Bok-nam', 'two', 'girls', 'were', 'once', 'very', 'close', 'time', 'drifted', 'apart', 'Mostly', 'was', 'forced', 'Hae-won', 'who', 'never', 'bother', 'read', 'letter', 'Bok-nam', 'sent', 'island', 'Hae-won', 'time', 'learning', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'time', 'little', 'little', 'Bok-nam', 'kind', 'hearted', 'woman', 'treated', 'dirt', 'looked', 'down', 'entire', 'community', 'refer', 'b', '@', 'ch', 'stupid', 'b', '@', 'ch', 'make', 'do', 'bulk', 'labor', 'island', 'Bok-nam', 'also', 'shared', 'husband', 'husbands', 'brother', 'who', 'when', 'Bok-nam', 'husband', 'openly', 'hiring', 'prostitutes', 'sleeping', 'presence', 'herself', 'child', 'respect', 'Bok-nam', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'desperate', 'woman', 'leave', 'island', 'daughter', 'better', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'due', 'abusive', 'husband', 'community', 'holding', 'back', 'leaving.Eventually', 'Hae-won', 'Bok-nam', 'situation', 'little', 'nothing', 'intervene', 'other', 'deciding', 'would', 'like', 'return', 'home', 'Seoul', 'early', 'Bok-nam', 'beg', 'Hae-won', 'take', 'daughter', 'declines', 'when', 'Bok-nam', 'sad', 'truth', 'Hae-won', 'being', 'liar', 'Bok-nam', 'then', 'deperately', 'escape', 'own', 'caught', 'abusive', 'husband', 'who', 'brutally', 'front', 'daughter', 'when', 'story', 'turn', 'story', 'vengeance', 'begins.Overall', 'Bedevilled', 'great', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'how', 'truly', 'selfish', 'people', 'are', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'just', 'even', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'will', 'ignore', 'act', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'thing', 'just', 'protect', 'lot', 'despair', 'also', 'satisfaction', 'film', 'ending', 'really', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'just', 'who', 'Hae-won', 'find', 'out', 'end', 'maybe', 'spoiler', 'not', 'not', 'exactly', 'put', 'upfront', 'movie', 'Bok-nam', 'proteced', 'Hae-won', 'kid', 'was', 'stronger', 'looked', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'attacked', 'group', 'boys', 'Bok-nam', 'fights', 'off', 'Hae-won', 'runs', 'Unfortunately', 'Bok-nam', 'up', 'getting', 'hit', 'head', 'knocked', 'out', 'where', 'then', 'sexually', 'molested', 'boys', 'Hae-won', 'just', 'tree', 'staring', 'not', 'attempting', 'get', 'help.Hae-won', 'been', 'unkind', 'person', 'entire', 'life', 'end', 'Bok-nam', 'tries', 'tell', 'Sadly', 'Bak-nam', 'everyone', 'been', 'unkind', 'as', 'long', 'been', 'alive', 'only', 'joys', 'life', 'were', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Hae-won', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'worthless', 'daughter', 'whom', 'could', ""n't"", 'protect', 'man', 'old', 'guy', 'met', 'either', 'treated', 'like', 'dirt', 'sex', 'object', 'movie', 'hints', 'when', 'someone', ""n't"", 'island', ""'re"", 'kind', 'her.Bedevilled', 'could', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'drama', 'could', 'be', 'suspense', 'could', 'be', 'tragic', 'story', 'really', 'above', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'was', 'Bok-nam', 'was', 'love', 'Hae-won', 'was', 'just', 'mind', 'warped', 'seeing', 'woman', 'was', ""n't"", 'broken', 'down', 'working', 'fields', 'day.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Bedevilled [Region 2]

1437292,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0051S1FDM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Kim Bok-nam Salinsageonui Jeonmal (Bedevilled) (Chul-soo Jang, 2010)You all know the story--or at least the beginning of it. In 1790, a British ship called the Bounty foundered on the rocks near what is now Pitcairn Island. Its captain, William Bligh, supposedly went stir-crazy after a time and had to be deposed by a number of mutineers, headed by one Fletcher Christian. The mutineers eventually settled on Pitcairn, with Polynesian wives, and founded a country, or at least a British protectorate. (For what it's worth, Bligh and the loyalists were, in fact, let go, and founded nearby Norfolk Island.) Then began two hundred years of the Brits intermarrying and adapting to what Colleen McCullogh, whose husband hails from Pitcairn, infamously called ""indigenous customs"" involving the roles of women in society. There was a big blow-up last decade that ended with the first trial in Pitcairn history, with six men convicted of thirty-three counts of, had they been Americans, various degrees of statutory rape. The trial, and the inevitable media flurry, focused on the sexual assaults, but there was more than that; women were treated as mere objects, little more than chattel. (Any wonder why every woman who accused the men was no longer living on Pitcairn, most of them having fled to New Zealand?)I'm not certain that's the basis for Bedevilled, a film that at least one review I read today claimed ""revitalized Korean horror"" (I didn't realize Korean horror needed revitalizing; the past few years have brought us Arang, Epitaph, and The Red Shoes, among others), but the parallels are chilling. Of course, the movie is also well-informed by seventies rape-revenge flicks (Americans will be most familiar with I Spit on Your Grave, naturally, but the seventies rape-revenge thriller was a global phenomenon, at least briefly), but you put a woman and her daughter on a remote, sparsely-populated island and have the entire male population treat her like a slave (and all the older women forcing her to do their share of the work)? It may look Korean (despite the rather ridiculous make-up jobs), but it sure smells like Pitcairn, especially when the woman's husband starts making eyes at the daughter. But I'm getting well ahead of myself.Plot: Hae-won (Harmony's Seong-won Ji) works at a large bank in Seoul. Things start going bad for her afer she witnesses a crime, and both her work and personal lives suffer. Her boss forces her to take a vacation, so she heads off to see her childhood friend Bok-nam (The Chaser's Yeong-hie Seo). Bok-nam is thrilled to see her, but Hae-won quickly realizes something's wrong; the entire population of the island, save a senile old grandfather, treats Bok-nam like dirt. Hae-won begins to bond with Bok-nam's daughter, Yeon-hee (Ji-eun Lee in her feature debut), but Yeon-hee is almost of an age where she can start assisting her mother in doing all the other inhabitants' work. Bok-nam, who seems resigned to her own fate, is desperate to save her daughter--but Hae-won, cold, distant, and saddled with her own problems, is reluctant to get involved. That is, of course, assuming the island's inhabitants are willing to let her leave in the first place...The main problem with Bedevilled is that it's too long. The climactic scene happens just halfway into the film, which leads to the big third-act denouement, but then the film keeps going, mostly to wrap up some unanswered questions. All well and good, except that segment goes, oh, twenty minutes, contains yet another big twist (that really didn't need to be there), etc. On the other hand, with the exception of some pacing problems (setting the climax where it is is synecdochic, not an anomaly), the first two-thirds of the movie are captivating--well-acted, gorgeously-shot, and with some darn fine screenwriting courtesy Kwang-young Choi (Secret Reunion). This was only the guy's second script--I can't wait to see what he's capable of once he's mastered the art of trimming. But if you are okay with the whole rape-revenge theme (I will warn you that at least one scene, about twenty minutes into the film, is probably triggering) and you like a lot of character development in your drama/thrillers (I wouldn't call this a horror film at all), then Bedevilled should be right up your alley. ***",3,"""I have stared long into the sun, and it spoke to me...""",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,4309,"['Kim', 'Bok-nam', 'Salinsageonui', 'Jeonmal', 'Bedevilled', 'Chul-soo', 'Jang', '2010', 'know', 'story', 'least', 'beginning', '1790', 'British', 'ship', 'called', 'Bounty', 'foundered', 'rocks', 'what', 'now', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'captain', 'William', 'Bligh', 'supposedly', 'went', 'stir-crazy', 'time', 'had', 'be', 'deposed', 'number', 'mutineers', 'headed', 'one', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'mutineers', 'eventually', 'settled', 'Pitcairn', 'Polynesian', 'wives', 'founded', 'country', 'least', 'British', 'protectorate', 'what', 'worth', 'Bligh', 'loyalists', 'were', 'fact', 'let', 'go', 'founded', 'nearby', 'Norfolk', 'Island', 'Then', 'began', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'Brits', 'intermarrying', 'adapting', 'what', 'Colleen', 'McCullogh', 'husband', 'Pitcairn', 'infamously', 'called', 'indigenous', 'customs', 'involving', 'roles', 'women', 'society', 'was', 'big', 'blow-up', 'last', 'decade', 'ended', 'first', 'trial', 'Pitcairn', 'history', 'six', 'men', 'convicted', 'thirty-three', 'counts', 'had', 'been', 'Americans', 'various', 'degrees', 'statutory', 'rape', 'trial', 'inevitable', 'media', 'flurry', 'focused', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'women', 'were', 'treated', 'mere', 'objects', 'little', 'more', 'chattel', 'Any', 'wonder', 'why', 'woman', 'who', 'accused', 'men', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'living', 'Pitcairn', 'most', 'having', 'fled', 'New', 'Zealand', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'basis', 'Bedevilled', 'film', 'least', 'one', 'review', 'read', 'today', 'claimed', 'revitalized', 'Korean', 'horror', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Korean', 'horror', 'needed', 'revitalizing', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'brought', 'Arang', 'Epitaph', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'others', 'parallels', 'are', 'chilling', 'course', 'movie', 'also', 'well-informed', 'seventies', 'rape-revenge', 'flicks', 'Americans', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'familiar', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'naturally', 'seventies', 'rape-revenge', 'thriller', 'was', 'global', 'phenomenon', 'least', 'briefly', 'put', 'woman', 'daughter', 'remote', 'sparsely-populated', 'island', 'have', 'entire', 'male', 'population', 'treat', 'slave', 'older', 'women', 'forcing', 'do', 'share', 'work', 'may', 'look', 'Korean', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'make-up', 'jobs', 'sure', 'Pitcairn', 'especially', 'when', 'woman', 'husband', 'making', 'eyes', 'daughter', ""'m"", 'getting', 'well', 'ahead', 'myself.Plot', 'Hae-won', 'Harmony', 'Seong-won', 'Ji', 'large', 'bank', 'Seoul', 'Things', 'start', 'going', 'bad', 'afer', 'crime', 'work', 'personal', 'lives', 'suffer', 'boss', 'take', 'vacation', 'see', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Bok-nam', 'Chaser', 'Yeong-hie', 'Seo', 'Bok-nam', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Hae-won', 'quickly', 'something', 'wrong', 'entire', 'population', 'island', 'save', 'senile', 'old', 'grandfather', 'Bok-nam', 'dirt', 'Hae-won', 'begins', 'bond', 'Bok-nam', 'daughter', 'Yeon-hee', 'Ji-eun', 'Lee', 'feature', 'debut', 'Yeon-hee', 'almost', 'age', 'where', 'can', 'start', 'assisting', 'mother', 'doing', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'work', 'Bok-nam', 'who', 'resigned', 'own', 'fate', 'desperate', 'save', 'daughter', 'Hae-won', 'cold', 'distant', 'saddled', 'own', 'problems', 'reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'course', 'assuming', 'island', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'willing', 'let', 'leave', 'first', 'place', 'main', 'problem', 'Bedevilled', 'too', 'long', 'climactic', 'scene', 'just', 'halfway', 'film', 'big', 'third-act', 'denouement', 'then', 'film', 'going', 'mostly', 'wrap', 'up', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'well', 'good', 'segment', 'oh', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'yet', 'big', 'twist', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'etc', 'other', 'hand', 'exception', 'pacing', 'problems', 'setting', 'climax', 'where', 'synecdochic', 'not', 'anomaly', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'are', 'captivating', 'well-acted', 'gorgeously-shot', 'darn', 'fine', 'screenwriting', 'courtesy', 'Kwang-young', 'Choi', 'Secret', 'Reunion', 'was', 'only', 'guy', 'second', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'capable', 'once', 'mastered', 'art', 'trimming', 'are', 'okay', 'whole', 'rape-revenge', 'theme', 'will', 'warn', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'probably', 'triggering', 'like', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'drama/thrillers', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'Bedevilled', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', '***']",Bedevilled [Region 2]

It takes us into the life of a very small community of islanders (9-10 people) that basically live by they're own rule. It is brutal, heart breaking, sad and horrifying all rolled into one great revenge film.Hae-won is a young and stressed woman due to her job and a crime she witnessed. When she finally explodes at work her boss makes her take a vacation at which time she decides its best to get away. She takes a trip to where she grew up, Moodo Island, where she reconnects with her childhood friend Bok-nam who has a daughter of her own. As she settles in she notices that Bok-nam is treated like a slave by the whole community and is mistreated daily by her abusive boyfriend Man-Jong but yet never comes to her aid. One day Bok-nam tries to escape with her daughter only to get caught by Man-Jong.In a violent struggle Bok-nams daughter is accidentally killed by Man-Jong prompting the community to cover up what really happened when an investigator is called in. Bok-nam finally losing her last straw, goes on a murderous rampage to exact revenge on those that have done her wrong and the people responsible for the death of her daughter, including her childhood friend Hae-won.I absolutely loved this film. It shows how one person can be pushed around their whole life and finally snap when the one thing they loved the most is taken away from them. It tests the bonds of friendship and takes betrayal to a different level. It is a very violent and some what gory film that will suck you in and have you rooting for this poor abused woman as she cuts her way through this abusive community.I really can't say anything bad about ""Bedevilled"" at all and recommend you pick up a copy and enjoy this South Korean masterpiece.",5,"""A Vacation to Where Evil Dwells""",1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1856,"['Bedevilled', 'beast', 'movie', 'coming', 'South', 'Korea', 'land', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'making', 'Just', 'had', 'add', 'life', 'very', 'small', 'community', 'islanders', '9-10', 'people', 'basically', 'live', ""'re"", 'own', 'rule', 'brutal', 'heart', 'breaking', 'sad', 'horrifying', 'rolled', 'one', 'great', 'revenge', 'film.Hae-won', 'young', 'stressed', 'woman', 'due', 'job', 'crime', 'witnessed', 'When', 'finally', 'work', 'boss', 'take', 'vacation', 'time', 'best', 'get', 'away', 'trip', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'Moodo', 'Island', 'where', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Bok-nam', 'who', 'daughter', 'own', 'Bok-nam', 'treated', 'slave', 'whole', 'community', 'mistreated', 'daily', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Man-Jong', 'yet', 'never', 'aid', 'One', 'day', 'Bok-nam', 'tries', 'escape', 'daughter', 'only', 'get', 'caught', 'Man-Jong.In', 'violent', 'struggle', 'Bok-nams', 'daughter', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'Man-Jong', 'prompting', 'community', 'cover', 'up', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'when', 'investigator', 'called', 'Bok-nam', 'finally', 'losing', 'last', 'straw', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'exact', 'revenge', 'have', 'done', 'wrong', 'people', 'responsible', 'death', 'daughter', 'including', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Hae-won.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'pushed', 'whole', 'life', 'finally', 'snap', 'when', 'one', 'thing', 'loved', 'most', 'taken', 'away', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'different', 'level', 'very', 'violent', 'what', 'gory', 'film', 'will', 'suck', 'have', 'rooting', 'poor', 'abused', 'woman', 'way', 'abusive', 'community.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Bedevilled', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'enjoy', 'South', 'Korean', 'masterpiece']",Bedevilled [Region 2]
