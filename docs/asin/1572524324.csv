Instead, you end up with a one dimensional joke that's stretched well over 80 minutes.  There are some moments of brilliance and cleverness, but they are few and far between.  It's more of a shameless Dirk Shafer promo piece than anything else, probably because his glory days are over and he has to get a real job.  From the opening shot, you quickly realize that Dirk is getting old, like the rest of us, and that he looks NOTHING like he does on the cover of the DVD box or in the multitude of Playgirl pictures that are shown throughout the film.  His choice of characterizations is quite irritating: the gay activists are shown as bitter queens whose lives won't be complete until they &quot;out&quot; him; and for being so in love with his own boyfriend, there are very few moments of genuine caring between them.  As one reviewer mentioned, the AIDS sideplot is pathetic and really doesn't belong in this story.  Must every gay-themed movie have someone dying of AIDS?  Don't people die from car crashes anymore?  Or gunshot wounds?The DVD itself is sorely lacking.  There are NO extras whatsoever except for a trailer of the film and a scene access feature (they call it &quot;interactive menus&quot;...ha!).  No commentary, no interviews, not even subtitles for the hearing-impared!  The picture is full-frame; no widescreen is available.  This is obviously another rush job on the part of Fox-Lorber.

187472,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,1572524324,J. Martin,"[0, 0]","It looks like I'm the only person who loved this movie; I enjoyed it more than any I've seen in a very long time, and it's entirely because of writer-director-star Dirk Shafer. It's a reconstructed and partially fictionalized account of his actual experience as Playgirl magazine's 1992 Man of the Year, filmed a couple of years later.Shafer is amazingly charismatic, intelligent, funny and unpretentious. If it's all an act, he deserves an Oscar. The fact that he's gorgeous is almost irrelevant, because he's so thoroughly appealing in so very many ways. He's one of the few people I've ever seen in a movie whom I'd really love to know, and it has nothing to do with his looks. He's a sweet, smart, articulate, fantastically likeable person, and when he's on screen the movie is always delightful.I had only two problems with it. I almost quit watching after a few minutes, because I'd expected something like Spinal Tap or Waiting for Guffman, a totally convincing ""documentary"" - which Man of the Year is not. It's painfully obvious from the first words that this is a scripted work of fiction, using some pretty bad (and some pretty good) actors to tell the story. (I got used to the different style pretty fast, though, and it never bothered me again.)I can't think of any other movie like it, in which a person tells his own story - nearly all of which is almost certainly true - playing himself but using a script and actors to play the other people in his life (there are a very few real people playing themselves, but even their lines are scripted).That's the other problem for me: I never knew what to believe, what was true and what wasn't. I'm not talking about the facts of his life, the Playgirl stuff - as I said, that's almost certainly all true. I mean his relationships, in particular his relationship with his boyfriend, called Mike in the movie and played beautifully by Michael Marisi Ornstein - the best actor in it, and no less charming and attractive than Shafer is.Is he real? Those two guys are so amazing that I'd love to think they're really a couple. So I loved the movie, but it left me a little unsettled, almost as if I'd watched a movie about my own life and left wondering how much of it was true.

187473,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,1572524324,J. Michael Click,"[6, 12]","A tasteless and offensive film that ultimately proves to be a cynical joke played by writer-director-star Dirk Shafer against his audience.  Shafer was the 1992 ""Playgirl"" Man of the Year centerfold who (supposedly) represented the ultimate object of desirability for the magazine's (supposedly) heterosexual readership, but is in reality a gay man.  Having played the role of a straight man in life, Shafer went on to make this film, a fictional documentary about his secret life during the year of his ""reign"".  He's a gay man who pretended to be a straight man who is pretending to unmask himself as a gay man ... get it?  Ha, ha.  Ha.Very (yawn) funny, except that during the course of the film Shafer keeps touching on some very unfunny subjects: a best friend dying of AIDS; homophobia; gay self-hatred; celebrity stalking; etc.  The big punch line comes at the end of the movie when Shafer confides that his overall objective in making the movie was not to reveal himself, but merely ""to direct""; i.e., to con the viewer into paying to see yet another false presentation of himself.  What an ego!  The film might have had some redeeming quality if only Shafer had been graceful enough to laugh at himself, but he doesn't.  Trust me, there's less to him than meets the eye.  Not even worth a look for Bill Bochtrup (""NYPD Blue"") as the friend dying of AIDS or Mindy Sterling (the Austin Powers movies) in a brief bit as fictional talk show host Cindee.The DVD includes the theatrical trailer which is presented in widescreen.

187474,ACZ6J3L2C0IZ6,1572524324,"John Cardenas ""opera nut""","[6, 9]","This movie is dunderheaded, offensive, and hot in about equal measure.  Shafer is obviously a dazzling physical specimen, and no doubt that accounts for a lot of the interest in this film, as well as the intrigue of  his sham heterosexual heartthrob status.  However, an intrinsic drawback of  this mockumentary genre is that the joke wears thin pretty fast, and we  soon feel compelled to groan at the same stale, straightfaced antics.  And  when Shafer makes the egregious error of using a friend's illness from AIDS  (in a particularly lame performance by the actor in the movie here) to lend  some poignancy to his slender theme, one may feel compelled to throw  something at the screen.  The obvious self-satisfaction of these laidback,  self-consciously hip types, laughing down their noses at the rubes who  bought Shafer's ruse, grates.  Shafer seems unaware what a sick joke his  feeble movie has become.  His obvious self-absorption and lack of acting  ability doesn't help things either.  One performance does transcend the  generally flaccid narcissism and cheap theatrics:  the woman who portrays  Shafer's mother has a scene where she gets to suggest some of the pain of a  mother who realizes what her gay son has had to go through.

The problem with this video is that is doesn't know whether it should be funny or serious and this is definately a huge mistake for this kind of project/subject matter.  I personally LOVE dark humor......but this aint it!!!Best is the scene in which the mother talks about accepting herself as a fit and caring parent while she was dealing with the homophobic father of a dying AIDS patient on the phone.The worst part of this whole video (and frankly I almost stopped watching quite a few times just due to this), are the ""date scenes"", in which Dirk is set up by Playgirl to go on a contest winning date with some supposedly hick gal (bad actress..bad!) who won it.  The scenes never feel real and it's obvious that everyone is over-acting during the whole mess.One thing I noticed is that while it's never a great movie and really not good either, overall Dirk isn't a horrible actor and I think he's actually pretty attractive, where as before I just thought he was a pretty boy.  Also NYPD Blue fans will recognize the wonderful actor, Bill Bochtrup, in the role of AIDS patient and ""discoverer"" of Dirk the centerfold.I was somewhat entertained or I wouldn't bother to write about it.
