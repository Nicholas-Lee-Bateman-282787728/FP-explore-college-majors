1370319,A3NWXCY2FT3O0E,B003X859DE,Chris L.,"[0, 0]","This is amazing!!  An HD full stereo crisp clear Colin Hay experience.  I've seen the band show many times, and prefer the songs he does with the band, but also love the solo shows (the long out of print VHS concert Live at the Continental is also cool).  Usually the artsy black and white footage intertwined with the color, gets on my nerves, but it fits here, the editing is masterful!  I think Colin is so under-rated and any music fan will enjoy this.  Can't praise this product enough, buy it you will be glad you did.  The only song that is missing is Company of Strangers, that would only make it better (my fav song).  The usual band (for the most part is here), his wife is a great singer and is great in her own right.  Look for Colin, he's on tour a lot! and he'll probably come to your town soon.

On this DVD the band is great, the song choice is great and Colin is great.  Personally, I am slightly more inclined toward his solo accoustic performances on the DVD, but that's not a knock against his selections with the band.  If you've never seen Colin Hay live, this DVD gives a good taste of what he's like, especially in the more intimate confines of the Corner Hotel as opposed to a big arena.  It's much more like you're actually there.  I confess am reluctant to comment on the performance of Cecilia Noel yet I feel something needs to be noted.  I fully understand that some artists like to have their partners on stage with them.  John had Yoko, Paul had Linda and Bruce has Patty.  Okay, I get that.  The problem I had with Ms. Noel is that her on-stage antics were terribly distracting to the point of upstaging Colin Hay.  I realize that Ms. Noel is a star in her own right in her own genre of music.  But but this is a Colin Hay DVD and he's supposed to be the focus here.  Watching her cavort around the stage during the performances was simply bizarre.  But, I'll concede that perhaps that's just my reaction.  Others may not find her behavior as disruptive as I did.  Otherwise it's a fine DVD.  I very much enjoyed the special features, especially Colin Hay's duet with his younger sister.  I also enjoyed his monologue and found it amusing.",4,"Loved Colin, but.....",1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,1446,"['other', 'reviewers', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'Colin', 'Hay', 'finally', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'band', 'great', 'song', 'choice', 'great', 'Colin', 'great', 'Personally', 'am', 'slightly', 'more', 'inclined', 'solo', 'accoustic', 'performances', 'DVD', 'not', 'knock', 'selections', 'band', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Colin', 'Hay', 'live', 'DVD', 'good', 'taste', 'what', 'especially', 'more', 'intimate', 'confines', 'Corner', 'Hotel', 'opposed', 'big', 'arena', 'much', 'more', ""'re"", 'actually', 'there', 'confess', 'am', 'reluctant', 'comment', 'performance', 'Cecilia', 'Noel', 'yet', 'feel', 'something', 'needs', 'be', 'noted', 'fully', 'understand', 'artists', 'have', 'partners', 'stage', 'John', 'had', 'Yoko', 'Paul', 'had', 'Linda', 'Bruce', 'Patty', 'Okay', 'get', 'problem', 'had', 'Ms.', 'Noel', 'on-stage', 'antics', 'were', 'terribly', 'distracting', 'point', 'upstaging', 'Colin', 'Hay', 'realize', 'Ms.', 'Noel', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'own', 'genre', 'music', 'Colin', 'Hay', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'be', 'focus', 'here', 'Watching', 'cavort', 'stage', 'performances', 'was', 'simply', 'bizarre', ""'ll"", 'concede', 'perhaps', 'just', 'reaction', 'Others', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'behavior', 'as', 'disruptive', 'did', 'Otherwise', 'fine', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'Colin', 'Hay', 'duet', 'younger', 'sister', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'monologue', 'found', 'amusing']",N/A

It's about a 50-50 proposition that you are going to get one that has both exceptional audio and video.  This is exceptional.  Hey - I had never heard of Colin Hay......  Only after watching a couple of clips on youtube, did I realize he was the main man in the band ""Men at Work"" (which meant nothing to me because I was not too familiar with ""Men at Work"").  But, watching and listening to a couple of clips on youtube, I was impressed - so I took the chance and bought this DVD.  It is nothing less than excellent.  The guy is a true life ""Rags to Riches to Rags"" guy.  He started out playing small clubs - progressed to filling auditoriums and back to small clubs.  He is, once again, on the rise doing his own gig.  There's a story to every song.  A great voice, great guitarist and funny.  This concert consists of him doing solo work - singing and playing guitar to a full band.

1370322,A38WI2P5PHH38Y,B003X859DE,Music Lover,"[1, 1]","Colin does acoustic shows, and shows with a band. We were lucky enough to see him at Orange County fair, and then saw him again at the coach house. We bought this DVD, and love it. It's interesting how different he is from show to show, but always great. This started a little slow with a couple of acoustic pieces, and then the band joined in. The extras are great also including his stand-up comedy act. All-around great disc. Will see him again.",5,Seen Colin 3 times now counting this DVD,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,448,"['Colin', 'acoustic', 'shows', 'band', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'Orange', 'County', 'fair', 'then', 'saw', 'again', 'coach', 'house', 'bought', 'DVD', 'love', 'interesting', 'how', 'different', 'show', 'show', 'always', 'great', 'started', 'little', 'slow', 'couple', 'acoustic', 'pieces', 'then', 'band', 'joined', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'including', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'act', 'All-around', 'great', 'disc', 'Will', 'see', 'again']",N/A
1370323,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B003X859DE,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 3]","I guess I have to disagree with the two previous reviewers before me. I enjoy Hay's music and I have seen him live in a cub in the US and he put on a great show. I didn't get the same experience with this DVD.The ""concert"" at this small club in Melbourne (Hay was born in Scotland, raised in Australia and now lives in Los Angeles) has the audience standing in front of the stage for the 98-minute length and watching the heads is a ""little"" annoying. But the camera work is closer to cinema verite with odd angles and switching back and forth from color to black and white (and some out of focus shots too). I don't have an HD player or TV and the image was less sharp for me than most current concert videos.Also annoying to me - but I guess its personal taste - is watching Hay's wife Cecilia Noel jumping around the stage and shaking her body (the only thing she doesn't do is cartwheels - but the stage is probably too small) on all the songs which feature the band. She was not with Hay on the tour I saw and so this is first time I ""experienced her"". Again, personal preference, but she distracts from watching Hay.The Special features are another odd part of the DVD.  The first is the 16 minute :""Monologue"" that preceded the first song on the concert, but was placed as a special feature because, I guess, they wanted the ""program"" to be all music. (Note that there basically no spoken introductions to the songs. It's Hay's attempt at stand up comedy and some of it is funny. Then comes a song cut from the show with Colin and his sister Carol singing ""Melbourne Song"". Next is a seven minute ""Interview"" edited from his answers to questions about his tour and career. Finally there are three ""Acoustic"" performances from another concert - obviously from years before based on his haircut. They are enjoyable and it was in a concert hall, not a club.Because this is the best available performance footage of Hay, his fans will want it. She explains in the interview that they did it because ""fans wanted to take home a concert DVD after my concerts"". It is okay but I guess I'll stick with the audio CDs for now and catch him on tour for a live show.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,"Oddly edited film with Hay (not to mention his ""active"" wife) in a small club in Melbourne",1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2194,"['guess', 'have', 'disagree', 'two', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'enjoy', 'Hay', 'music', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'cub', 'US', 'put', 'great', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'experience', 'DVD.The', 'concert', 'small', 'club', 'Melbourne', 'Hay', 'was', 'born', 'Scotland', 'raised', 'Australia', 'now', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'audience', 'standing', 'front', 'stage', '98-minute', 'length', 'watching', 'heads', 'little', 'annoying', 'camera', 'work', 'closer', 'cinema', 'verite', 'odd', 'angles', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'focus', 'shots', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'HD', 'player', 'TV', 'image', 'was', 'less', 'sharp', 'most', 'current', 'concert', 'videos.Also', 'annoying', 'guess', 'personal', 'taste', 'watching', 'Hay', 'wife', 'Cecilia', 'Noel', 'jumping', 'stage', 'shaking', 'body', 'only', 'thing', ""n't"", 'do', 'cartwheels', 'stage', 'probably', 'too', 'small', 'songs', 'feature', 'band', 'was', 'not', 'Hay', 'tour', 'saw', 'so', 'first', 'time', 'experienced', 'Again', 'personal', 'preference', 'watching', 'Hay.The', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'odd', 'part', 'DVD', 'first', '16', 'minute', 'Monologue', 'preceded', 'first', 'song', 'concert', 'was', 'placed', 'special', 'feature', 'guess', 'wanted', 'program', 'be', 'music', 'Note', 'basically', 'spoken', 'introductions', 'songs', 'Hay', 'attempt', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'funny', 'Then', 'song', 'cut', 'show', 'Colin', 'sister', 'Carol', 'singing', 'Melbourne', 'Song', 'Next', 'seven', 'minute', 'Interview', 'edited', 'answers', 'questions', 'tour', 'career', 'Finally', 'are', 'three', 'Acoustic', 'performances', 'concert', 'obviously', 'years', 'based', 'haircut', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'concert', 'hall', 'not', 'club.Because', 'best', 'available', 'performance', 'footage', 'Hay', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'interview', 'did', 'fans', 'wanted', 'take', 'home', 'concert', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'okay', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'audio', 'CDs', 'now', 'catch', 'tour', 'live', 'show.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
