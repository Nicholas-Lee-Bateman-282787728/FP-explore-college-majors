1280776,A1FDVT0DLJWV78,B002O4J4B6,D. A. J.,"[14, 15]","This DVD covers the Sid episodes of brushing teeth, eating a healthy diet, germs, and exercise. There are also bonus episodes - including one on vaccinations that we haven't watched yet. Sid is great a teaching science because the program conquers it effortlessly. It doesn't seem preachy or condescending to children. Unlike many learning programs, Sid is not a ""remake"" of an old show that is trying to be hip today (as in the case of the Electric Company or Sesame Street), Sid was created for children today so it doesn't feel forced.I enjoy that Sid learns not only at school, but at home as well. He learns from his mother and father as well as his wonderful grandmother. The program also does a good job of showing experiments that can be done at home, which we have done with our children. Sid seems to be a normal kid (although one gifted in asking good questions) and does well at fostering a scientific investigation mindset in young children. Our children are currently 2 and 4 years old and they have learned a lot watching the episodes. This learning as led to more in-depth study on many of the subjects introduced on the show.While you can watch these for free by finding them on your local PBS station, having the DVD means you can watch them at your leisure.  We also took them on vacation with us and could watch a quality show that was appropriate for our children.I have recommended this and other Sid videos to others as well.If you want an entertaining show that teaches without preaching and makes learning enjoyable for young children - definitely try this out. There are entertaining songs that are quick enough to be engaging, but not dominating. Scientific experiments that can be done at home with mom and dad. They acknowledge the teaching role of mom's and dad's (as many programs seem to infer learning happens only at school), and thankfully shows an intact, functioning, multi-generational family (another aspect sorely missing from many shows today). The show is fun for kids and you as a parent won't go crazy. On a recent 9 hour car ride, my children watched the main 4 episodes several times in a row and at no point did my husband or I try to jump out the car screaming ""make it stop, make it stop"" - that alone makes this a good DVD to purchase! If you need more encouragement, here are the lyrics to a song that appears in every episode:""I love my mom,my mom is cool;but now its time,for having fun at school"".Have fun and get ready for your little one to burst through the door saying ""one scientist in the house!""Most appropriate for the 2 - 6 age range.",5,A great DVD tackling science for young children,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,2597,"['DVD', 'Sid', 'episodes', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'eating', 'healthy', 'diet', 'germs', 'exercise', 'are', 'also', 'bonus', 'including', 'one', 'vaccinations', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'Sid', 'great', 'teaching', 'science', 'program', 'conquers', 'effortlessly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'preachy', 'condescending', 'children', 'many', 'learning', 'programs', 'Sid', 'not', 'remake', 'old', 'show', 'trying', 'be', 'hip', 'today', 'case', 'Electric', 'Company', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Sid', 'was', 'created', 'children', 'today', ""n't"", 'feel', 'forced.I', 'enjoy', 'Sid', 'not', 'only', 'school', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 'grandmother', 'program', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'experiments', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'home', 'have', 'done', 'children', 'Sid', 'be', 'normal', 'kid', 'one', 'gifted', 'asking', 'good', 'questions', 'well', 'fostering', 'scientific', 'investigation', 'mindset', 'young', 'children', 'children', 'are', 'currently', '2', '4', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'learned', 'lot', 'watching', 'episodes', 'learning', 'led', 'more', 'in-depth', 'study', 'many', 'subjects', 'introduced', 'show.While', 'can', 'watch', 'free', 'finding', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'having', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'leisure', 'also', 'took', 'vacation', 'could', 'watch', 'quality', 'show', 'was', 'appropriate', 'children.I', 'have', 'recommended', 'other', 'Sid', 'videos', 'others', 'well.If', 'want', 'entertaining', 'show', 'preaching', 'learning', 'enjoyable', 'young', 'children', 'definitely', 'try', 'out', 'are', 'entertaining', 'songs', 'are', 'quick', 'enough', 'be', 'engaging', 'not', 'dominating', 'Scientific', 'experiments', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'home', 'mom', 'dad', 'acknowledge', 'teaching', 'role', 'mom', 'dad', 'many', 'programs', 'seem', 'infer', 'learning', 'only', 'school', 'thankfully', 'intact', 'functioning', 'multi-generational', 'family', 'aspect', 'sorely', 'missing', 'many', 'shows', 'today', 'show', 'fun', 'kids', 'parent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'crazy', 'recent', '9', 'hour', 'car', 'ride', 'children', 'watched', 'main', '4', 'episodes', 'several', 'times', 'row', 'point', 'did', 'husband', 'try', 'jump', 'out', 'car', 'screaming', 'make', 'stop', 'make', 'stop', 'alone', 'good', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'need', 'more', 'encouragement', 'here', 'are', 'lyrics', 'song', 'episode', 'love', 'mom', 'mom', 'cool', 'now', 'time', 'having', 'fun', 'school', '.Have', 'fun', 'get', 'ready', 'little', 'one', 'burst', 'door', 'saying', 'one', 'scientist', 'house', 'Most', 'appropriate', '2', '6', 'age', 'range']",N/A
