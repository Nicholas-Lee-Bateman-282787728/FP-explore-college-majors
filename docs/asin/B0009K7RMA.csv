First the acting improved, sigal didn't hit it on his second try but he was close everyone else was ok. This to me and a lot of other fans was a very big problem in the first one, how does a director work his magic with bad actors. There were so many flaws that couldn't go unnoticed like for one Rocawear wasn't created until the late 90's so why are they wearing rocawear in the 70's flash backs and everyone in the whole movie is wearing rocawear. Seriously the only time nobody was wearing it was in the jail scenes to some people this isn't a big problem but to me this is another one of damon dash's hustles. This is suppose to be a serious movie I mean in real life somebody's got to be wearing sean john or enyce. It was too cluttered I think we all know the roc was going to try to fit everyone of their artist in there.
