The movie was basically generic, the acting was sub par and the movie did not have that horror movie feel to it. There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new. The plot was thin and so was the pacing of the entire film. You don't care for any of the characters and trust me; I have been watching and collecting horror movies for years. This one stinks, badly. Hollywood needs to stop butchering Asian films.

1137627,A10UGG54QNH71L,B0012KJ0CG,"Alex S ""Blurb""","[5, 9]","Ahem, let me just see if I got this right. This is a US remake of a recent Japanese horror film, helmed by a duo of... French directors, with Jessica Alba as the main blind (!) character? And, like ""The Grudge 2"", ""The Ring 2"" and numerous other Hollywood remakes of mid-grade J-horror, it hasn't been screened for critics... Hmmm. Maybe one shouldn't expect a masterpiece here.It's not. Not by a long stretch. Aside from a few nice visual touches here and there, the film is poorly directed, acted, edited, scripted, lit - and worst of all, it never approaches even the mediocre original's (directed by the Oxide brothers) ability to raise chills.I would go into intricate plot details, but let's face it - if you're going to watch it, you don't want me to spoil whatever flimsy attempts at twists this film makes. And if you're not going to watch it (I predict this will be the majority), you won't be bothered to read this review.So I'll take the rest of my time trying to convince those of you still reading NOT to watch this film.I mean, name ONE decent Jessica Alba performance. (""Sin City"" doesn't count - all she does in it is dance.) She has never been, and never will be a contender for an Oscar nomination - unless she plays a paralyzed deaf mute with a bandaged face. She's sexy, but as an actress leaves a lot to be desired.Why would you want to go watch ""The Eye"", when such films as ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""There Will Be Blood"", and, if you're looking for shocks, ""Cloverfield"", are playing in theaters? Trust me, you've seen it all before: the uncanny hazy visions, darkly lit atmospheric corridors, eerie noises and a predictable finish. This is clearly a case of ""let's hire some fresh European directors to remake some film for a quick buck."" Hopefully, there won't be any bucks.Go watch the original Japanese version instead - while no classic by a stretch, it's  more entertaining than this dreck. Or, even better, go see what the directors are capable of in their far superior debut feature ""Them"", a 75-minute sustained terror trip, and let this shallow, pointless feature become a flop.Maybe then they'll stop making 'em.",1,Painful to the Eye...,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,2167,"['Ahem', 'let', 'just', 'see', 'got', 'right', 'US', 'remake', 'recent', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'helmed', 'duo', 'French', 'directors', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'main', 'blind', 'character', 'Grudge', '2', 'Ring', '2', 'numerous', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'mid-grade', 'J-horror', ""n't"", 'been', 'screened', 'critics', 'Hmmm', 'Maybe', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'here.It', 'not', 'Not', 'long', 'stretch', 'Aside', 'few', 'nice', 'visual', 'touches', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'poorly', 'directed', 'acted', 'edited', 'scripted', 'lit', 'worst', 'never', 'even', 'mediocre', 'original', 'directed', 'Oxide', 'brothers', 'ability', 'raise', 'chills.I', 'would', 'go', 'intricate', 'plot', 'details', 'let', 'face', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'flimsy', 'attempts', 'twists', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'watch', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'majority', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'read', 'review.So', ""'ll"", 'take', 'rest', 'time', 'trying', 'convince', 'still', 'reading', 'NOT', 'watch', 'film.I', 'mean', 'name', 'ONE', 'decent', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'performance', 'Sin', 'City', ""n't"", 'count', 'dance', 'never', 'been', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'contender', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'paralyzed', 'deaf', 'mute', 'bandaged', 'face', 'sexy', 'actress', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.Why', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'watch', 'Eye', 'when', 'such', 'films', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', ""'re"", 'looking', 'shocks', 'Cloverfield', 'are', 'playing', 'theaters', 'Trust', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'uncanny', 'hazy', 'visions', 'darkly', 'lit', 'atmospheric', 'corridors', 'eerie', 'noises', 'predictable', 'finish', 'clearly', 'case', 'let', 'hire', 'fresh', 'European', 'directors', 'remake', 'film', 'quick', 'buck', 'Hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bucks.Go', 'watch', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'instead', 'classic', 'stretch', 'more', 'entertaining', 'dreck', 'even', 'better', 'go', 'see', 'what', 'directors', 'are', 'capable', 'far', 'superior', 'debut', 'feature', 'Them', '75-minute', 'sustained', 'terror', 'trip', 'let', 'shallow', 'pointless', 'feature', 'become', 'flop.Maybe', 'then', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'making']",The Eye
1137628,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B0012KJ0CG,Allen Bowers,"[1, 3]","Some of you may have read my review for the original asian version of ""The Eye"" so you most likely know where I stand with that mostly plotless bore. So as for this American remake all I can say is ""ZZZ!ZZZ"". Yeah this wasn't anymore exciting than the original! I don't completely know what the differences are between the 2 versions, but I will say that while this movie version is considerably better written, better acted, and possessing a little more character development than the original it still just proves way too bland. It's a bitter enough pill that gorgeous and incredibly hot Jessica Alba never gets naked EVER nor does she have any love interest in the movie. But to make matters worse the story was this same bland plot with a beautiful blind violinist girl getting to see again from a cornea transplant only to have visions of her dark past. I mean what it is that anybody thought would be interesting about a dull plotline like that is beyond me! And it still ends the same stupid way as the original. I won't give away what the ending was that much but only I will say that after Jessica Alba saves the people from a gas tanker explosion during a traffic jam why then wouldn't she instead be getting used to seeing as well as having no further flashbacks about the donors incident in the past. That would have been a better turn out. If you read my other review for the original the said ""incident"" is not any different really. Oh and by the way it would have been nice if they had gotten rid of that annoying little boy ghost who keeps asking for his report card.  Oh Please!!

1137630,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0012KJ0CG,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","The Eye starts off rather boring, and definitely NOT scary. However, after you get by the first 30 minutes, the unexplainable scares Jessica Alba's character begins to see really get going and *this* is when the story takes off.The story begins with Jessica's character portraying a blind woman, but soon she gets surgery that allows her to see. The movie does a great job allowing Jessica's character development to build, and making it believable that we really ARE seeing someone learn to use their eyes after years of not being able to see at all.  Good detail here.As soon as her vision gets settled in, she starts seeing dark, ghostly figures that definitely aren't friendly by any stretch of the imagination.She soon realizes that whenever she sees these ghostly figures, she is seeing them because a death has taken place recently around the area, and these ghosts have come to take away people who have died recently.Sometimes the scares are truly disturbing, such as the one involving a little kid who kept asking her if she'd seen his report card. That part was a bit funny, because it's easy to see WHY his report card was so bad- he spends all day hanging around the hotel hallways, haha.However, the kid actually died, and when Jessica discovers this, any future encounter with the boy will only result in something horrifying... but I won't spoil what actually happens.Another very freaky part is when she actually walks *through* another woman while walking across the street.  You will see what's up with this scene after you get used to the storyline.Those aren't the only dead people she sees either- she sees plenty of other people too.  Wait until you see what happens whenever she looks at a mirror.The movie does a terrific job keeping the ghostly figures few and far between, allowing tension to build, and allowing us to appreciate the horror aspect when it unfolds.A great movie, but please, take time to get used to a slow-moving storyline in the beginning, and you will probably be satisfied with the film by the conclusion.",4,"builds slowly, but won me over in the end",1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,2052,"['Eye', 'rather', 'boring', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'scary', 'However', 'get', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'unexplainable', 'scares', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'character', 'see', 'really', 'get', 'going', '*this*', 'when', 'story', 'off.The', 'story', 'Jessica', 'character', 'portraying', 'blind', 'woman', 'soon', 'surgery', 'see', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'allowing', 'Jessica', 'character', 'development', 'build', 'making', 'believable', 'really', 'ARE', 'seeing', 'someone', 'learn', 'use', 'eyes', 'years', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'Good', 'detail', 'here.As', 'soon', 'vision', 'settled', 'seeing', 'dark', 'ghostly', 'definitely', 'are', ""n't"", 'friendly', 'stretch', 'imagination.She', 'soon', 'whenever', 'ghostly', 'figures', 'seeing', 'death', 'taken', 'place', 'recently', 'area', 'ghosts', 'have', 'come', 'take', 'away', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'scares', 'are', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'such', 'one', 'involving', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'kept', 'asking', ""'d"", 'seen', 'report', 'card', 'part', 'was', 'bit', 'funny', 'easy', 'see', 'WHY', 'report', 'card', 'was', 'so', 'bad-', 'day', 'hanging', 'hotel', 'hallways', 'haha.However', 'kid', 'actually', 'died', 'when', 'Jessica', 'future', 'encounter', 'boy', 'will', 'only', 'result', 'something', 'horrifying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'actually', 'happens.Another', 'very', 'freaky', 'part', 'when', 'actually', '*through*', 'woman', 'walking', 'street', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'up', 'scene', 'get', 'used', 'storyline.Those', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'dead', 'people', 'either-', 'plenty', 'other', 'people', 'too', 'Wait', 'see', 'what', 'whenever', 'mirror.The', 'movie', 'terrific', 'job', 'keeping', 'ghostly', 'figures', 'few', 'far', 'allowing', 'tension', 'build', 'allowing', 'appreciate', 'horror', 'aspect', 'when', 'great', 'movie', 'please', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'slow-moving', 'storyline', 'beginning', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'satisfied', 'film', 'conclusion']",The Eye

""The Eye"" is a film like that, and that's too bad because I really wanted to immerse myself in the thrills and chills without focusing on the specifics. Yes, this movie is creepy and tense, but it's also completely unbelievable, from the characterizations to the plot details to the ending, which is so ridiculous and contrived that I almost felt cheated. Pretty much the only believable part of the story is the supernatural element, which involves the transplanted eyes of a formerly blind woman seeing horrible things. It probably doesn't matter that I've never seen the Chinese film this is based on, or even that I have no idea how a medical procedure like a corneal transplant really works; what does matter is that ""The Eye"" succeeds in being frightening but fails at telling a good story.Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, a concert violinist who went blind at age five because of an incident with firecrackers. Her sister, Helen (Parker Posey), feeling responsible for Sydney's condition, has her undergo a corneal transplant. Soon enough, Sydney is lying in a hospital recovery room with bandages over her eyes; when removed, she sees a world of blurred images and undefined shapes, which is normal so soon after such a procedure. But then she begins to see things that aren't normal, ugly, gray-skinned things that disappear and reappear at will. As her vision gets clearer, she soon discovers that they serve as postmortem escorts, leading ghosts away from their bodies and into another realm. Where they go and why they do this is never explained, but I guess it doesn't matter since they were effective.Not so effective are the circumstances surrounding a series of visions. As she struggles to cope with newfound eyesight, Sydney's life is plagued by recurring nightmares and ghostly visitations, all of which incrementally reveal unfamiliar people and places. They all seem to have something to do with a devastating fire and the deaths of many people, but it's unclear as to what they mean or why she's seeing it. She eventually realizes that it has something to do with the eye donor, but any attempts at extracting information are flatly rejected. It's confidential, they say. They only one willing to help is her therapist, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), a man I neither believed in nor cared about. A character this out of place shouldn't be so quick to point out all of the ways Sydney will have trouble adjusting; he says that because she's been dependant on her other senses for so long, she won't know how to handle what she sees. This may be true, but he certainly wasn't able to convince me.The search for the donor leads Sydney and Paul into Mexico, and this is pretty much where the film is at its worst. It isn't until then we learn that Paul is fluent in Spanish, which isn't unrealistic so much as it's convenient for the plot, as is the fact that the first real character they meet is fluent in English. I can't really describe this part without being annoyingly vague, so let us leave it at the fact that Sydney has been called there for something directly related to the visions she's been having.This is the kind of plot that sounds decent enough on paper but doesn't quite measure up on the big screen. Much like the sequence in Mexico, most of ""The Eye"" is dependent on convenience, whether or not it's plausible. Sydney's casual attitude towards her new eyesight is downright maddening, as is the ease with which she navigates streets, hallways, stairs, and elevators. For someone used to doing all this blindly, she behaves as if she has been able to see her whole life. The character development is painfully lacking, especially when it comes to side characters that seem important but ultimately contribute nothing. Take, for example, Alicia Millstone (Chloe Moretz), a nine-and-a-half year old cancer patient living in the hospital: she seems desperate to be friends with Sydney, so much so that she enters Sydney's room whenever she feels like it and offers herself as a kind-hearted soul. But why does she feel so connected? Why does she care at all, considering her own struggles? This character was the weakest of the film, more so than the unbelievable Paul Faulkner.One aspect of the film I did like related to Sydney's mirror image. When she fails to recognize herself in a picture taken by Helen, she realizes that her reflection is in fact not her own, but that of the donor. How psychological. How symbolic. How jaw-droppingly unnerving. Of course, it's nothing more than one shocking moment--the rest of the film is nowhere near as effective in terms of drawing the audience in. Had the story been halfway as good as it sounded, the film could have been something more. It would be too much to say that ""The Eye"" is a bad film, but it would be untrue to say that it worked, and I say this because it wanted to be more than just a run of the mill supernatural thriller. But when a film about sight is bookended by voiceover narrations that say you shouldn't trust your eyes, a supernatural thriller is the best it's ever going to be.",3,"Was Blind, But Now She

I saw this recently with almost no expectations after reading some incredibly harsh reviews. I was surprised at how enjoyable it was, and how it avoided what could have been some exceptionally heavy-handed social commentary. No, this isn't an especially original horror film, and it isn't particularly gory or edgy. But it's certainly gripping enough for me to recommend it, and I hope it gains a larger audience on DVD.Jessica Alba plays a blind violinist who receives a corneal transplant and almost immediately starts seeing supernatural visions. While some of them reminded me of the typical Asian oddball ghosts we've seen recently, others reminded me more of creatures from ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Regardless, most of them were creepy. Jessica Alba gives her best performance since ""Dark Angel"" in this movie (I've been very critical of practically every film she's done) and it's to her credit that the movie works as well as it does. She channels the same spirit of alienation that she did as Max on ""Dark Angel"" and it's hard not to have sympathy for a character who is as isolated as she is by the middle third of the film. As the only A-list talent in the film, everything is on Jessica's shoulders and she rises to the occassion.Most of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out very well, suggesting that either whole reels were left in the editing room or the filmmakers were trying to capture the sketchy nature of ""Carnival of Souls"" (which portions of ""The Eye"" strongly resemble). This helps prevent ""The Eye"" from ever becoming a great film but as I've stated before, it's a solid nonpretentious horror flick.",3,"Good, though not an ""Eyeful""",1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,1817,"['spoiler-free', 'review', 'Eye', ""'re"", 'looking', 'few', 'decent', 'thrills', 'competently', 'made', 'horror', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'subgenre', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Eye', 'saw', 'recently', 'almost', 'expectations', 'reading', 'incredibly', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'how', 'avoided', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exceptionally', 'heavy-handed', 'social', 'commentary', 'No', ""n't"", 'especially', 'original', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'gory', 'edgy', 'certainly', 'gripping', 'enough', 'recommend', 'hope', 'gains', 'larger', 'audience', 'DVD.Jessica', 'Alba', 'blind', 'violinist', 'who', 'corneal', 'transplant', 'almost', 'immediately', 'seeing', 'supernatural', 'visions', 'reminded', 'typical', 'Asian', 'oddball', 'ghosts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'others', 'reminded', 'more', 'creatures', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Regardless', 'most', 'were', 'creepy', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'best', 'performance', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'critical', 'practically', 'film', 'done', 'credit', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'channels', 'same', 'spirit', 'alienation', 'did', 'as', 'Max', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'hard', 'not', 'have', 'sympathy', 'character', 'who', 'as', 'isolated', 'middle', 'third', 'film', 'only', 'A-list', 'talent', 'film', 'everything', 'Jessica', 'shoulders', 'occassion.Most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'suggesting', 'whole', 'reels', 'were', 'left', 'editing', 'room', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'capture', 'sketchy', 'nature', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'portions', 'Eye', 'strongly', 'resemble', 'prevent', 'Eye', 'ever', 'becoming', 'great', 'film', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'solid', 'nonpretentious', 'horror', 'flick']",The Eye

1137643,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0012KJ0CG,Dave. K,"[2, 3]","Over the past few years Hollywood has been in a remake craze; it seems every horror release is a remake or a sequel. The sad part is there are actually a lot of great remakes over the years, but due to the recent trend that is now often over-looked. The recent hash of remakes has mostly been poor with a few exceptions.For some reason though the remakes of Asian flicks have been rather terrible; I'm not quite sure why, but these movies do not work in the States. The only remake of an Asian movie I thought was great was The Departed. Besides that they have all been rather bad with some being slightly below average. The remake of The Eye I found better than most of the Asian movie remakes, but with that said The Eye wasn't very good. If anything the movie was simply ok. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it just wasn't all that good.The screenplay by Sebastian Gutierrez wasn't bad per se, but it's never interesting and that's the problem. The characters are rather boring and the story never fully works. It takes the basic idea of the original, but offers its own twist, which is a good thing. I hate remakes that are the same exact thing as the original. But the direction the movie goes in is just never interesting.Directors David Moreau & Xavier Palud who have recently gotten some attention due to their French movie Them make their American movie debut. To be honest I didn't really care for Them; it takes the last 20-minutes of a slasher film and stretches it to an hour. Hear a noise and run away. But I did see some potential and had I liked the characters I probably would have liked the movie. While there was potential as filmmakers they sure as hell didn't come near with The Eye.This is the typical ghost flick we've seen done over and over again. The original Eye wasn't the most original of movies. The basic style has been done plenty of times, but The Pang Brothers put their own twist on it, David Moreau & Xavier Palud never do that. It's really like every other remake of an Asian horror flick. If I didn't know any better I would think it was the same filmmakers each time out. But despite that The Eye is still better than most remakes of Asian horror flicks, which isn't saying much I suppose.The original was a really eerie movie with some solid suspense. From the very start the Pang Brothers set a tone and maintain that through the whole movie. Moreau & Palud never come anywhere near doing that with their version. There are a few scenes that are just like the original, but never once are they effective. The biggest problem is the use of cheap jump scares.Like I always say any filmmaker with a little talent can create a jump scare and more often than not we jump not because we're scared, but due to it being a simple reaction. The only time jump scares work is when they are set up prior to that. Moreau & Palud relied on the cheap jump scare tactic and it simply doesn't work. Though I will say the final act is actually quite well-done. While it does seem a bit rushed it's about the only scenes that are effective at all. By no means are they the most suspenseful, but do work well. But it's just as a whole The Eye just never fully works.Jessica Alba really isn't a very good actress and let's be honest the main reason she's a high profile actress is due to her looks. There is no denying Alba is very nice to look at. I'll give her some credit here though. Alba manages to be more than just eye candy and actually delivers a pretty decent performance. This isn't a great performance, but it was actually pretty good, which surprised me.In closing, The Eye isn't bad movie, but it's just never really interesting. There was potential, but never reaches it. The Eye makes for a decent time killer, but I'd stick with the original. Again The Eye isn't bad, but just never really interesting.",3,"The Eye isn't bad, but just never really interesting",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,3843,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'remake', 'craze', 'horror', 'release', 'remake', 'sequel', 'sad', 'part', 'are', 'actually', 'lot', 'great', 'remakes', 'years', 'due', 'recent', 'trend', 'now', 'often', 'over-looked', 'recent', 'hash', 'remakes', 'mostly', 'been', 'poor', 'few', 'exceptions.For', 'reason', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'flicks', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'terrible', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'States', 'only', 'remake', 'Asian', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'Departed', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'bad', 'being', 'slightly', 'average', 'remake', 'Eye', 'found', 'better', 'most', 'Asian', 'movie', 'remakes', 'said', 'Eye', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'ok', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'means', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'good.The', 'screenplay', 'Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'se', 'never', 'interesting', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'boring', 'story', 'never', 'fully', 'basic', 'idea', 'original', 'own', 'twist', 'good', 'thing', 'hate', 'remakes', 'are', 'same', 'exact', 'thing', 'original', 'direction', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'interesting.Directors', 'David', 'Moreau', 'Xavier', 'Palud', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'gotten', 'attention', 'due', 'French', 'movie', 'Them', 'make', 'American', 'movie', 'debut', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Them', 'last', '20-minutes', 'slasher', 'film', 'stretches', 'hour', 'Hear', 'noise', 'run', 'away', 'did', 'see', 'potential', 'had', 'liked', 'characters', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'potential', 'filmmakers', 'sure', 'hell', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'Eye.This', 'typical', 'ghost', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'over', 'again', 'original', 'Eye', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'movies', 'basic', 'style', 'been', 'done', 'plenty', 'times', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'put', 'own', 'twist', 'David', 'Moreau', 'Xavier', 'Palud', 'never', 'do', 'really', 'like', 'other', 'remake', 'Asian', 'horror', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'same', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'out', 'Eye', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'flicks', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'suppose.The', 'original', 'was', 'really', 'eerie', 'movie', 'solid', 'suspense', 'very', 'start', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'set', 'tone', 'maintain', 'whole', 'movie', 'Moreau', 'Palud', 'never', 'come', 'anywhere', 'doing', 'version', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'original', 'never', 'once', 'are', 'effective', 'biggest', 'problem', 'use', 'cheap', 'jump', 'scares.Like', 'always', 'say', 'filmmaker', 'little', 'talent', 'can', 'create', 'jump', 'scare', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'jump', 'not', ""'re"", 'scared', 'due', 'being', 'simple', 'reaction', 'only', 'time', 'jump', 'scares', 'work', 'when', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'prior', 'Moreau', 'Palud', 'relied', 'cheap', 'jump', 'scare', 'tactic', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'will', 'say', 'final', 'act', 'actually', 'quite', 'well-done', 'seem', 'bit', 'rushed', 'only', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'means', 'are', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'do', 'work', 'well', 'just', 'whole', 'Eye', 'just', 'never', 'fully', 'works.Jessica', 'Alba', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'main', 'reason', 'high', 'profile', 'actress', 'due', 'looks', 'denying', 'Alba', 'very', 'nice', 'look', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'here', 'Alba', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'performance', ""n't"", 'great', 'performance', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'surprised', 'me.In', 'closing', 'Eye', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'interesting', 'was', 'potential', 'never', 'Eye', 'decent', 'time', 'killer', ""'d"", 'stick', 'original', 'Again', 'Eye', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'interesting']",The Eye

1137646,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0012KJ0CG,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","In 2002, the Pang Brothers released one of the best Asian ghost stories in recent memory, &#34;The Eye.&#34; It was spooky, eerie and tragic...... so of course, Hollywood decided that it needed a remake. With Jessica Alba. And like so many remakes, it belly-flops into forgettable mediocrity -- partly due to Alba's awkward two-expression acting, and partly because co-directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud... simply do not have the indefinable skill that makes a horror director good.After many years of blindness, Sydney (Alba) is given a corneal transplant that finally restores her sight. Everything is going beautifully after the transplant, although Sydney is a little bewildered. Then she starts seeing things that she shouldn't -- ghosts who repeat what they did before they died, people who have just expired, and dark shadows that escort them away. Oh, and fire. She keeps seeing fire.Unsurprisingly, her friends and doctors think that she's having some sort of weird reaction to all the new input coming into her brain, but Sydney knows that her new corneas have somehow given her supernatural powers. So she begins investigating the woman whose corneas she currently has, hoping to bring peace to her soul.I'd like to mention that I am NOT one of those hipsterish people who pretend that all American remakes are automatically bad or inferior to the original, nor do I labor under the provincial delusion that Hollywood is the only movie industry that remakes stuff from other countries. In fact, the American &#34;The Eye&#34; isn't even the first remake of this story -- there was a 2005 remake over in India.So I can say without prejudice that this movie is terrible. To the credit of Palud and Moreau, they try painfully hard to stick to the Hong-Kong movie -- almost every scene is identical, and some of the spooky moments are copied shot-by shot.But there's something... missing. It's difficult to exactly put your finger on what is wrong with the movie, but it simply is not scary -- there are things that should be skin-crawlingly creepy (Sydney realizing that her reflection is not her face) that just feel vaguely dull. Some of this also comes from the music, which tends to be bland and tensionless, even during dramatic or scary scenes.Also, Jessica Alba. She is possibly the worst choice possible for a horror movie. This woman has two facial expressions, and neither one of them is fear -- so whenever Sydney is horrified or frightened, Alba just scuttles around looking vaguely displeased.And this is what truly kills &#34;The Eye.&#34; There are countless scenes that strain pathetically to be frightening, and almost are able to be. Consider when Sydney is trapped in an elevator with the levitating, slowly-approaching ghost of a dead man... and Alba just stands in a corner making &#34;scared&#34; noises, aperformance that is embarrassing to watch. This movie needed Sarah Michelle Gellar or Jessica Chastain instead of.... this.And you get the sense that none of the other actors are really invested in this.

1137647,A34O1FHEAN9DN6,B0012KJ0CG,E. Beckstrom,"[0, 0]","Some of the American remakes of Asian horror films are worthy of our time and some are not. For instance, the American version of The Ring--with the exception of the incompetently directed, terribly acted initial 10 minutes or so--is actually better than the Japanese version, and a very good ghost story in its own right. The American version of The Grudge is also quite effective as a horror movie. As for The Eye, you're much better off watching the original Pang brothers' Chinese version. For example: One of the key segments of the story is when the main character finds out who donated her transplanted corneas, and sets off to learn what she can about the donor. In the Pang's film, these sequences are pretty startling and creepy, are much more effectively edited, and, compared to the American remake, make better use of sound and camera movement to build suspense. By contrast, this same section of storyline in the American re-make is rushed and cursory. It is ineffective both as storytelling and as cinema--it's just nothing special, when it should have been one of the hallmarks of the film. Other aspects of the American version also come off as sloppy. For instance, Helen, the sister of Sydney (the main character) promises Sydney she will stick by her and help her as she recovers from surgery and learns to cope with her new-found ability to see. But then Helen inexplicably leaves town and we don't see her again until literally the last few seconds of the movie. I don't honestly recall what role the sister played in the Pang's version, but her character serves almost no purpose in the American version. This is just sloppy filmmaking. Bottom line, the Chinese version of The Eye is a pretty good little creepy horror flick (The Eye 2 is also quite good--a very unusual, low key, yet startling, ghost story), but the American version is a complete waste of time. It gets two stars instead of one only because Jessica Alba is so dang pretty.",2,"Original Chinese version is very good, American version is lame",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,1964,"['American', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'worthy', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'instance', 'American', 'version', 'Ring', 'exception', 'incompetently', 'directed', 'terribly', 'acted', 'initial', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'actually', 'better', 'Japanese', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'American', 'version', 'Grudge', 'also', 'quite', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'Eye', ""'re"", 'much', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'original', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'Chinese', 'version', 'example', 'One', 'key', 'segments', 'story', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'out', 'who', 'donated', 'transplanted', 'corneas', 'off', 'learn', 'what', 'can', 'donor', 'Pang', 'film', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'startling', 'creepy', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'edited', 'compared', 'American', 'remake', 'make', 'better', 'use', 'sound', 'camera', 'movement', 'build', 'suspense', 'contrast', 'same', 'section', 'storyline', 'American', 're-make', 'rushed', 'cursory', 'ineffective', 'storytelling', 'cinema', 'just', 'nothing', 'special', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'hallmarks', 'film', 'Other', 'aspects', 'American', 'version', 'also', 'come', 'off', 'sloppy', 'instance', 'Helen', 'sister', 'Sydney', 'main', 'character', 'Sydney', 'will', 'stick', 'help', 'surgery', 'cope', 'new-found', 'ability', 'see', 'then', 'Helen', 'inexplicably', 'town', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'literally', 'last', 'few', 'seconds', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'recall', 'what', 'role', 'sister', 'played', 'Pang', 'version', 'character', 'almost', 'purpose', 'American', 'version', 'just', 'sloppy', 'filmmaking', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Chinese', 'version', 'Eye', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'creepy', 'horror', 'flick', 'Eye', '2', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'unusual', 'low', 'key', 'yet', 'startling', 'ghost', 'story', 'American', 'version', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'only', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'so', 'dang', 'pretty']",The Eye

1137653,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0012KJ0CG,Jason,"[2, 2]","Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, who went blind at the age of seven as a result of a firecracker accident with her sister. I'll only mention this as an interjection, because that's how it felt in the movie, but Parker Posie is a horrible actress, was completely forgettable, and may actually have some sort of sense deprivation similar to the star character in this movie. Despite Posie's black-hole of suck ""acting"" style, Jessica Alba manages to carry every scene with her incredible beauty and acting ability.Despite the disability, Wells has moved on well enough in life to be a celebrated violinist, living successfully in the big city at a swanky condo expensive enough to have an elevator employee. Somehow she doesn't have a boyfriend or love interest; so she can devote most of her time to her career, being nice, and listening to her sister harp (pun intended) on her about getting cornea transplants.After getting the surgery, she is sent to a specialist, of what I have no idea. However, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) is an eye specialist that helps cornea transplant recipients readjust to their new sight, but he does so in the most callous manner possible, without even the slightest regard for the psychological trauma someone may experience when gaining one of the five senses they've lived without their entire adult life. His approach is essentially the equivalent of telling someone with a torn hamstring to rub some dirt on it and get back in the game. The fact that he has the perpetual George Michael five-o'clock shadow, and nearly no compassion adds little credibility to his portrayal as a doctor.Along with Sydney's new-found vision, she also begins to see abnormalities (eerie ghosts, spooky images, blurry suspicions, etc.). She seems to have the ability to see events in the past, events in the future, as well as people making their after-life transition. Not only that, but she also begins having visions of her surroundings changing, and gray, creepy apparitions of some kind acting as escorts to the aforementioned recently deceased. One can only assume they are escorts towards a purgatory of some sort; otherwise, there is no reason to make the apparitions evil, especially when escorting off innocent, out-going, little girls with terminal brain cancer.The plot moves along when Sydney find out the reflection she sees is of a different woman, and from there she must find out who this woman is, and why she wants from Sydney. (This scene reminded me of Scott Bakula's character in the old TV show Quantum Leap, except the reflections were very rarely as attractive) She makes the connection around this time and realizes all the visions have to do with her eye donor.The conclusion comes about when Sydney inevitably avenges the death of her donor by completing an altruistic deed left unfinished. Lives are saved, the evil escort spirits are thwarted, and the donor's soul can rest in one of the most predictable endings in movie history.In the perpetual stream of Japanese horror flicks made into mediocre Hollywood productions, this is nothing more than a typical translation. And, just like the commanalities in language translation, this movie comes across about as scary as many of the Engrish signs I've seen; it may work in Japan, but in America it comes across as somewhat silly and contrived...but it's still the best translation yet, because Jessica Alba takes it to the next level.",4,Maybe the best Japanese remake yet,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,3439,"['Jessica', 'Alba', 'Sydney', 'Wells', 'who', 'went', 'blind', 'age', 'seven', 'result', 'firecracker', 'accident', 'sister', ""'ll"", 'only', 'mention', 'interjection', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'Parker', 'Posie', 'horrible', 'actress', 'was', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'sort', 'sense', 'deprivation', 'similar', 'star', 'character', 'movie', 'Posie', 'black-hole', 'suck', 'acting', 'style', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'carry', 'scene', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'acting', 'ability.Despite', 'disability', 'Wells', 'moved', 'well', 'enough', 'life', 'be', 'celebrated', 'violinist', 'living', 'successfully', 'big', 'city', 'swanky', 'condo', 'expensive', 'enough', 'have', 'elevator', 'employee', 'Somehow', ""n't"", 'have', 'boyfriend', 'love', 'interest', 'can', 'devote', 'most', 'time', 'career', 'being', 'nice', 'listening', 'sister', 'harp', 'pun', 'intended', 'getting', 'cornea', 'transplants.After', 'getting', 'surgery', 'sent', 'specialist', 'what', 'have', 'idea', 'However', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Faulkner', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'eye', 'specialist', 'cornea', 'transplant', 'recipients', 'readjust', 'new', 'sight', 'so', 'most', 'callous', 'manner', 'possible', 'even', 'slightest', 'regard', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'someone', 'may', 'experience', 'when', 'gaining', 'one', 'five', 'senses', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'entire', 'adult', 'life', 'approach', 'essentially', 'equivalent', 'telling', 'someone', 'torn', 'hamstring', 'rub', 'dirt', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'fact', 'perpetual', 'George', 'Michael', ""five-o'clock"", 'shadow', 'nearly', 'compassion', 'little', 'credibility', 'portrayal', 'doctor.Along', 'Sydney', 'new-found', 'vision', 'also', 'see', 'abnormalities', 'eerie', 'ghosts', 'spooky', 'images', 'blurry', 'suspicions', 'etc.', 'have', 'ability', 'see', 'events', 'past', 'events', 'future', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'making', 'after-life', 'transition', 'Not', 'only', 'also', 'having', 'visions', 'surroundings', 'changing', 'gray', 'creepy', 'apparitions', 'kind', 'acting', 'escorts', 'aforementioned', 'recently', 'deceased', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'are', 'escorts', 'purgatory', 'sort', 'otherwise', 'reason', 'make', 'apparitions', 'evil', 'especially', 'when', 'escorting', 'off', 'innocent', 'out-going', 'little', 'girls', 'terminal', 'brain', 'cancer.The', 'plot', 'moves', 'when', 'Sydney', 'find', 'out', 'reflection', 'different', 'woman', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'woman', 'why', 'Sydney', 'scene', 'reminded', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'character', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'reflections', 'were', 'very', 'rarely', 'attractive', 'connection', 'time', 'realizes', 'visions', 'have', 'do', 'eye', 'donor.The', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Sydney', 'inevitably', 'death', 'donor', 'completing', 'altruistic', 'deed', 'left', 'unfinished', 'Lives', 'are', 'saved', 'evil', 'escort', 'spirits', 'are', 'thwarted', 'donor', 'soul', 'can', 'rest', 'one', 'most', 'predictable', 'endings', 'movie', 'history.In', 'perpetual', 'stream', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'flicks', 'made', 'mediocre', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'nothing', 'more', 'typical', 'translation', 'just', 'commanalities', 'language', 'translation', 'movie', 'across', 'as', 'scary', 'many', 'Engrish', 'signs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'may', 'work', 'Japan', 'America', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'contrived', 'still', 'best', 'translation', 'yet', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'next', 'level']",The Eye

""A New Yorker""","[23, 32]","This new trend with the film industry when it comes to the east vs. west or the west vs. east doesn't seem like it's slowing down any time soon plus they all end up having the same scare tactics. What they sometimes do is remove color from the ""monster"" making him look all shades of grey and then they remove frames while it's moving. Making it look like it's jerking around and pop locking. We saw it in the eastern remake of `The Ring,' the eastern remake of `The Grudge' and we see it again in `The Eye.' I guess if you have a winning formula you stick to it but I don't think every year we need to have some black and blue kid pop-locking on the big screen in his or her attempt to make me jump in my seat. I know I've been warned by this film through my Amazon friends but I had to see it for myself.For those who don't know we are introduced to Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who is an accomplished, independent, Los Angeles-based concert violinist. She is also blind, and has been so since a childhood tragedy. As our story opens, Sydney undergoes a double corneal transplant, a surgery she has waited her whole life to have, and her sight is restored. After the surgery, neural ophthalmologist Dr. Paul Faulkner helps Sydney with the difficult adjustment, and with the support of her older sister Helen, Sydney learns to see again. But Sydney''s happiness is short-lived as unexplainable shadowy and frightening images start to haunt her. Are they a passing aftermath of her surgery, Sydney''s mind adjusting to sight, a product of her imagination, or something horrifyingly real? As Sydney''s family and friends begin to doubt her sanity, Sydney is soon convinced that her anonymous eye donor has somehow opened the door to a terrifying world only she can now see.Though it wasn't really an original film it wasn't a horrible. Jessica Alba is finally getting to the point where I think she can carry a film by herself. In the past she has just been a bit of arm candy for a movie. But that's not the case any more.

Asian remakes, they've become a little redundant and are definitely losing their quality as opposed to the actual films that are being remade. Stories that could be told so much better on film than they actually were because of restrictions such as rating or actors, please stop.So why did I even bother viewing The Eye? Because I hoped that there would be some saving grace, even a miniscule bit of saving grace. There was. The story is very interesting, and there are a few bits where it grabbed my attention. It didn't hold it for long. What mainly grabbed me was the story of the donor, and Alba's character to discover the donor's origins. I'm fans of Parker Posey and Alessandro Nivola, and to see them was nice although Parker Posey had maybe a mere 5-6 minutes of screen time. Visually, the film looked crisp and the colors used were great.Aside from that, there wasn't much to hold onto. The scares were minimal, and pretty noneffective. None of the characters aside from the donor and Alessandro's effected me. Most of the exposition fell flat.

1137662,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0012KJ0CG,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've talked to a number of people who have really ragged on actress Jessica Alba. They claim that she has no talent whatsoever, that she is nothing more than a pretty face. Well she is that but I think there is more beneath that is not seen often enough. Unfortunately it's also not seen here in THE EYE.Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a blind concert violinists who is about to have her world completely changed. A donor has been found and replacement eye surgery puts her next in line to receive the gift of vision.While we are first exposed to her world of sightlessness, as most movies concerning blind characters that suddenly see, the majority of the film deals with what happens after she receives sight. When she wakes in the hospital, she sees things. Since she's never seen before (or at least since she was a child) she's not sure if these images are normal or something else.With the aid of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandra Nivola), a doctor whose job it is to help patients like these adjusts to life with sight, Sydney discusses the visions she begins having. Not only is her focus coming in when it comes to those around her, she keeps seeing a dark figures as well. These later adjust to become more than mere shadow figures but horrific images that resemble more nightmares than dreams.Determined to find out just what is causing these visions, Sydney decides to discover whose eyes she was given. The path of the film to this point is long and tedious. At times you feel like you'll never get here. But we do and that is when we find that Sydney's eyes came from a young Mexican woman who was branded as a witch by the local villagers.It sis while on a trip to see her family and to get to know more about her that Sydney has her most vivid sight ever, seeing the images of hundreds being carried off by these dark characters she has been seeing. Can she discover just what it is that she is seeing, what it is she is supposed to do?This movie offers very little in the way of entertainment. The plot seems to move along at a snails pace, feeling a bit redundant at times. The acting is fine and lacks no where, but when the script moves along like this, nothing can save it.Having seen the original film that this was based on, 2002's Chinese film THE EYE, it was hard not to compare the two films. Fortunately it's been a while since I saw that one and I didn't feel like I was referring back and forth between the two. I will say that the original held my interests more and built suspense and mystery than this production though.Hollywood seems to have given up on creating new horror, relying more on remakes of horror favorites (even FRIDAY THE 13TH is being remade as I write) and of oriental films like this one or THE GRUDGE and THE RING. Its fine to turn these foreign films into something more English speaking people will see, but if you choose to do so, why not honor the original instead of picking a few scarps of meat from the bones to be content with.Yes, THE EYE is not a movie I could recommend whole heartedly to rent or purchase. But, as this article began, it does not mean that Jessica Alba is a terrible actress. Even some of the best actresses ever were hindered with bad scripts and bad directing.

1137665,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0012KJ0CG,P. Hardy,"[5, 5]","The moment this movie was announced, the Cruise/Wagner produced remake of the Hong Kong film, The Eye, was destined to be hated or loathed. However, unlike the film that comes afterward, Jumper, which was terrible in every aspect of the word, there's no merit to the low ratings this film's gotten (you know, other than personal opinion and disdain for Jessica Alba). I had the pleasure of watching the original ""EYE"" film before seeing the remake and I enjoyed it immensely.I'm glad to say that, like the American remakes before this one, ---The Ring (Ringu) and The Grudge (Ju-on: The Grudge)--, The Eye is without a doubt the best adaptation of its original movie since the aforementioned films. Naturally, some changes are made to accommodate cultural differences and the current timeline of the world.The story follows Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), classical violinist, who has lived with an accident-caused blindness since she was just five years old. Now, nearly 20 nears later, she finally getting a transplant surgery that will restore her sight. At first, she is confused and disoriented, unable to understand if what she sees is ""real"" or not.During her first night with her new eyes, her bedmate at the hospital dies, and Sydney, not understanding, watches her blurry figure being led away by someone else. During her stay, she also befriends a young girl named Alicia Milstone (Chloe Moretz), who is there undergoing surgery for a brain tumor.As time goes on, Sydney's vision begins to clear up and she struggles to understand the new world around her. Her therapist, Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), feels that her strange visions are her mind's way of interpreting what it was never able to before. However, when she starts to see more and more apparitions of the dearly departed, Sydney believes otherwise. Her sister, Helen Wells (Parker Posey) worries that the stress of her new experiences are beginning to get to Sydney, but Sydney persists that everything she is seeing real.With no one to believe she is actually seeing the ghosts, the terrible visions of fire and death, Sydney struggles to retain her sanity as she attempts to decipher the mystery behind original owner of her eyes.In terms of faithfulness, THE EYE is a near-recreation of its predecessor. Scenes mirror each other with only minor differences. The storyline is true to its source material, again, with only minor changes. For instance, instead of the donor being from Northern Thailand, she is from Mexico, but their fates are largely the same. Another nice touch is, like Keri Russell for August Rush, Jessica Alba took violin lessons for film (assuming I remember correctly). So whether or not she's actually playing on screen and not simply mimicking the movements while a soundtrack plays in the background, it's a nice bit of information to know. Granted, a lot of people will bi**h and moan about the way the movie ends, as its quite different from the original, but given the motivation Sydney uses to get the civilians to flee from danger, I can believe it (even though most in reality would laugh you off the bus and call you a lair).The atmosphere of the movie a hardly scary, but it manages to weave a sense of unease, uncertainty (in concerns of Sydney's sanity), and tense moments when you least expect things to jump out at you. On technical aspects, the CGI used in the film blends well against the surrounding reality, especially near the end of the film. The ghosts, [Grim Reapers?], that usher spirits into the next world are more unsettling in appearance opposed to the originals. Which honestly begs the question as to whom they're actually working for -- especially since they ""don't like to be seen"".The performances in this film are excellent. Jessica Alba especially shows off a surprisingly convincing dramatic side of her highly doubted skills as an actress. She excels in every scene she's in and more than proves her worth (to me anyhow). Parker Posey's performance Alba's moody sister, Helen, is entertaining for the short time she appears in the film; its made perfectly clear that her character blames herself still what happened to her sister.Alessandro Nivola's Dr. Paul Faulkner, is about as likeable as Lawrence Chou's Dr. Wah in the beginning of the original film. Only, I didn't end up liking him at the end of this remake like I did the aforementioned character. Faulkner didn't strike me as that engaging of a character, though it could be because of Alessandro's deadpan performance.Marco Beltrami`s, the to-go guy if you want a quick score for a horror movie, score is suitable for the movie, though its rarely noticeable at times (I was a little too engrossed in the movie to listen).

They are completely OUT of fresh ideas for cinema. The well has run dry, and now they're trying to dip into the wells of their neighbors. What I mean by that is the latest trend of ripping off movie ideas from foreign cinema (much like Bollywood rips of Amercian films). ""The Eye"" is the American remake of a similar Asian film that apparently did well in the eastern markets, so it's gotta do well over here. Right?Wrong.What other cultures find amusing, scary, offensive, etc. is not necessarily how our culture feels about the same material (ever seen what Russians consider comedy? Not funny at all; but maybe that's just me).Anywho, to understand what I mean, watch any of John Woo's Hong Kong action films (The Killer, Hard Boiled) and then watch his Hollywood features (Broken Arrow, Face/Off). There is no comparsion. Woo's Hong Kong films are gritty, real, down to earth, and in-your face. His Hollywood films are formulaic and prepackaged for the masses. That's what happens when Hollywood gets its greedy little nubs on something.My whole point is, this film is predictable, formulaic, and rehashed. It's not something we haven't seen before.

No one can do the Pang Brothers like the Pang Brothers can do the Pang Brothers. I think I went to see it just to find out how badly Hollywood (who had the Pang Brothers for one film, the highly underrated The Messengers, then cast them back into the waters of Hong Kong) would mangle the brilliant original. While it wasn't a total loss, it was the kind of carnage you have to slow down to take a look at.The story is the same: a young violinist, Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), who was struck blind at the age of five, receives a cornea transplant. All is well and good, except that she starts having visions that she soon realizes are the memories of the donor, a Mexican woman (Fernanda Romero) who committed suicide. (Unlike in the original, this isn't a spoiler; we see her suicide in the opening shot.) Wells becomes convinced she has to go to Mexico and fins out all she can about the donor, against the advice of her doctor, Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), who, while finding her frustrating, is attracted to her. (Well, it's Jessica Alba, wouldn't you be?)As usual, the butchering could have been avoided had anyone decided on a shot-by-shot remake instead of watering down everything that made the original great. (Those who have seen the original will probably be groaning at the film's climax, which is grossly redone.) There are a few scenes here that do stand out, as when Wells ducks into the Chinese restaurant, but a few memorable scenes are a far cry from a good movie.

1137670,A2D1F0HWHN4T1U,B0012KJ0CG,Robert,"[0, 2]","I was a big fan of the unnerving and creepy Asian original, and was curious how well it would translate into an American film. When compared to the first, this version seems unusually light and devoid of suspense. Jessica Alba certainly has the star power and eye candy going for her as Sydney, the lead character who was tragically blinded at age five, but her range is limited and her ability to express anything beyond a mild surprise is annoyingly ineffective. When Sydney undergoes a cornea transplant and first sees light and shapes for the first time in decades, her response is tepid, at best, and nonchalant, leading one to believe the scene is little more than an afterthought so the movie can begin.Once Sydney begins to regain her sight, she discovers she is able to see dead people and characters that snatch up the recently deceased and take them to whatever realm they belong (they do have a bit of shock value at first, but it fades, and there is no other explanation). This comes from the donor of the cornea, who herself was able to see the dead. Sydney remarkably and without any surprise or revelation regains her vision without any since of wonder whatsoever, leaving us absent any real sense of any newfound discovery. Her visions eventually lead her to Mexico, along with her therapist, where she confronts the source of her hauntings (I'll be intentionally vague, but it's not as interesting as it sounds). A gooey ending is followed by a bubble gum pop song while the credits roll, a testament to the movie's apparent desire to please thirteen year old girls and avoid any real chills or tension.I remember explicitly a scene in the original film where the lead character is trapped in a moving elevator while a spirit slowly, and with a great sense of dread, hovers just out of her line of sight. The scene is shot with great skill, using camera angles, actress expressions, and lighting to effectively express a sense of terror. This film lacks any of that, and fails to truly create much tension between Sydney and her ghostly apparitions. While there is little CGI effects (no harm there) the use of light and shadows to create suspense is oddly absent after the first third of the film.Disappointment sums up my thoughts on ""The Eye"" and I'll stick with a recommendation for the original.

I'm not sure though that ""The Eye"" quite does the job. It's not too bad, but it's too much of a re-tread.It might remind the viewer of any number of 1950's drive-in horror flicks that featured reanimated body parts. There was ""The Hand,"" the ""Head,"" and indeed a host of either transplanted or disembodied eyes with minds of their own. So the idea that a pair of transplanted eyes can see things that their new owner never saw - is an old one.Then this film also recycles a lot of its special effects from ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"" - right down to specifics, including a pair of feet levitating behind the person riding on an elevator.""The Eye"" is also somewhat disappointing in that no real chemistry ever develops between the blind woman who receives an eye transplant and the doctor who counsels her after the operation. Although at the end of the film, the two take a dramatic road trip together in order to solve the mystery of the alarming visions that Jessica Alba's character is having - no convincing bond forms between them.Finally, a volley of what initially sounded to me like pseudo-scientific rationales are delivered to make the premise of this film sound possible. They invoked entanglement and other concepts from quantum physics to make a convincing case that memories can reside in separate body parts. I laughed this off at first. But coincidentally, right after seeing ""The Eye,"" an article appeared in an authoritative scientific magazine explaining that researchers are now coming to believe more literally in ""body knowing."" In their artificial intelligence departments, they are finding that in order to build effective robots, they have to distribute intelligence throughout all the functioning parts of the robot, rather than centralizing commands in a ""brain."" They now believe that this distributed intelligence is actually a better model of how humans themselves function. The article concluded that different parts of the body inform the brain with their memories and intelligences, rather than the other way around.So perhaps ""The Eye"" does have it after all - or at least some of it.",3,The Eyes Don't Quite Have It,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,2225,"['always', 'room', 'one', 'more', 'thriller', 'slide', 'chill', 'two', 'cracks', 'casements', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Eye', 'quite', 'job', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'too', 'much', 're-tread.It', 'might', 'remind', 'viewer', 'number', '1950', 'drive-in', 'horror', 'flicks', 'featured', 'reanimated', 'body', 'parts', 'was', 'Hand', 'Head', 'indeed', 'host', 'transplanted', 'disembodied', 'eyes', 'minds', 'own', 'idea', 'pair', 'transplanted', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'things', 'new', 'owner', 'never', 'saw', 'old', 'one.Then', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'Grudge', 'Ring', 'right', 'specifics', 'including', 'pair', 'feet', 'levitating', 'person', 'riding', 'elevator', 'Eye', 'also', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'real', 'chemistry', 'ever', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', 'eye', 'transplant', 'doctor', 'who', 'operation', 'end', 'film', 'two', 'take', 'dramatic', 'road', 'trip', 'together', 'order', 'solve', 'mystery', 'alarming', 'visions', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'character', 'having', 'convincing', 'bond', 'forms', 'them.Finally', 'volley', 'what', 'initially', 'sounded', 'pseudo-scientific', 'rationales', 'are', 'delivered', 'make', 'premise', 'film', 'sound', 'possible', 'invoked', 'entanglement', 'other', 'concepts', 'quantum', 'physics', 'make', 'convincing', 'case', 'memories', 'can', 'reside', 'separate', 'body', 'parts', 'laughed', 'off', 'first', 'coincidentally', 'right', 'seeing', 'Eye', 'article', 'appeared', 'authoritative', 'scientific', 'magazine', 'explaining', 'researchers', 'are', 'now', 'coming', 'believe', 'more', 'literally', 'body', 'knowing', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'departments', 'are', 'finding', 'order', 'build', 'effective', 'robots', 'have', 'distribute', 'intelligence', 'functioning', 'parts', 'robot', 'rather', 'centralizing', 'commands', 'brain', 'now', 'believe', 'distributed', 'intelligence', 'actually', 'better', 'model', 'how', 'humans', 'function', 'article', 'concluded', 'different', 'parts', 'body', 'inform', 'brain', 'memories', 'intelligences', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'perhaps', 'Eye', 'have', 'least']",The Eye

This is a movie where the scares will make you jump. It is not bloody, and is sort of an action movie. Jessica Alba does a great job of acting like she is blind; and her reactions to suddenly being able to see make perfect sense.

1137677,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B0012KJ0CG,Siklootd,"[3, 4]","Horror films can be great even if they are not terrifying.  ""The Eye"" happens to be one of those films.  The film won't necessarily scare the audience, but with a deep enough story, and a good plot line with likable characters, the film can definitely make for an exciting viewing time, despite the anti-climatic ending.  Personally, I believe that this film is highly under-appreciated.The story revolves around a young woman named Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who has been blind the majority of her life.  Years in darkness have taught her to utilize her other senses in order to sustain a well organized life.  The opening scenes of the film show the audience that Sydney has not only overcome her handicap of visual impairment, but she is quite comfortable with it as well.  Living the life of a well known concert violinist, Sydney appears to be quite content with her lifestyle.  Until the day she decides to try out a new medical procedure that promises to restore her eyesight.In an attempt to regain her eyesight that she lost as a child, Sydney (Alba) goes through with corneal transplant surgery.  She awakes in a dark hospital bedroom.  She cannot see too clearly at the moment, her vision impaired with blurry images.  This turns out to be the least of her worries.  Immediately after waking up in her hospital room, Sydney sees the image of an elderly woman who is being taken away by a dark shadowy figure.  The initial appearance of the ghost is well timed, allowing a decent shock for the viewer, but not one that is good enough to actually scare them either.Slowly, she begins to see more ghostly images, ranging from a local coffee shop, to her own apartment complex.  These images cause Sydney to seek help from an eye specialist, Dr. Paul Faulkner, who promised to teach Sydney how to readjust to the sense of sight.  Upon telling Paul that she has been seeing strange images, Paul simply tells Sydney that she is still adjusting to her new sense.  What he doesn't know is that the images are real, and appear to be occurring more frequently.  As it turns out, Sydney received the eyes from a dead woman who also was capable of seeing ""ghosts"".  The woman committed suicide after tormenting images haunting her night and day turned the small Mexican village where she resided against her.I find the story to be quite compelling and the characters are very easy to relate to.  The ending was nothing spectacular, and may have been a little too anti-climatic to garner enough praise.  The film may leave some viewers searching for more details, but it ends too abruptly to allow for further insight.  The pacing is done quite nicely, and the development of the plot proceeds quite smoothly, allowing the audience to get to know the characters better.  The movie has some tense scenes in it, mainly at the hospital after the initial images begin to occur, but the scary factor dwindles with time and the movie becomes more of a ""mystery"" film than a horror one.  Being one of Jessica Alba's biggest roles in a movie, I believe she did an excellent job of portraying the torment that she was going through.  The lighting of the film and the camera techniques added to the overall ambiance that generated the feeling of tension when needed.  The movie was not ""scary"" but was instead ""suspenseful"" and well developed, in my personal opinion.  If you're a fan of Jessica Alba (like me) or of horror films, you really can't go wrong with adding ""The Eye"" to your collection, just don't expect it to make you sleep with the lights on.",5,"Great Film, Under-appreciated",1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,3546,"['Horror', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'terrifying', 'Eye', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'scare', 'audience', 'deep', 'enough', 'story', 'good', 'plot', 'line', 'likable', 'characters', 'film', 'can', 'definitely', 'make', 'exciting', 'viewing', 'time', 'anti-climatic', 'ending', 'Personally', 'believe', 'film', 'highly', 'under-appreciated.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Sydney', 'Wells', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'who', 'been', 'majority', 'life', 'Years', 'darkness', 'have', 'taught', 'utilize', 'other', 'senses', 'order', 'sustain', 'well', 'organized', 'life', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'show', 'audience', 'Sydney', 'not', 'only', 'overcome', 'handicap', 'visual', 'impairment', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'as', 'well', 'Living', 'life', 'well', 'known', 'concert', 'violinist', 'Sydney', 'be', 'quite', 'content', 'lifestyle', 'day', 'try', 'out', 'new', 'medical', 'procedure', 'restore', 'eyesight.In', 'attempt', 'regain', 'eyesight', 'lost', 'child', 'Sydney', 'Alba', 'corneal', 'transplant', 'surgery', 'dark', 'hospital', 'bedroom', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'too', 'clearly', 'moment', 'vision', 'impaired', 'blurry', 'images', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'worries', 'Immediately', 'waking', 'up', 'hospital', 'room', 'Sydney', 'image', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'initial', 'appearance', 'ghost', 'well', 'timed', 'allowing', 'decent', 'shock', 'viewer', 'not', 'one', 'good', 'enough', 'actually', 'scare', 'either.Slowly', 'see', 'more', 'ghostly', 'images', 'ranging', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'own', 'apartment', 'complex', 'images', 'cause', 'Sydney', 'seek', 'help', 'eye', 'specialist', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Faulkner', 'who', 'promised', 'teach', 'Sydney', 'how', 'readjust', 'sense', 'sight', 'telling', 'Paul', 'been', 'seeing', 'strange', 'images', 'Paul', 'simply', 'Sydney', 'still', 'adjusting', 'new', 'sense', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'images', 'are', 'real', 'appear', 'be', 'occurring', 'more', 'frequently', 'out', 'Sydney', 'received', 'eyes', 'dead', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'capable', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'woman', 'committed', 'suicide', 'tormenting', 'images', 'haunting', 'night', 'day', 'turned', 'small', 'Mexican', 'village', 'where', 'resided', 'her.I', 'find', 'story', 'be', 'quite', 'compelling', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'ending', 'was', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'anti-climatic', 'garner', 'enough', 'praise', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'viewers', 'searching', 'more', 'details', 'too', 'abruptly', 'allow', 'further', 'insight', 'pacing', 'done', 'quite', 'nicely', 'development', 'plot', 'proceeds', 'quite', 'smoothly', 'allowing', 'audience', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'better', 'movie', 'tense', 'scenes', 'mainly', 'hospital', 'initial', 'images', 'begin', 'occur', 'scary', 'factor', 'dwindles', 'time', 'movie', 'more', 'mystery', 'film', 'horror', 'one', 'Being', 'one', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'biggest', 'roles', 'movie', 'believe', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'torment', 'was', 'going', 'lighting', 'film', 'camera', 'added', 'overall', 'ambiance', 'generated', 'feeling', 'tension', 'when', 'needed', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'scary', 'was', 'instead', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'developed', 'personal', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'horror', 'films', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'adding', 'Eye', 'collection', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'sleep', 'lights']",The Eye

You definately have a few creepy scenes in here, but overall I think the movie is pretty well done.

1137682,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0012KJ0CG,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","The Eye is the latest American remake of an Asian horror film, this time of the Hong Kong produced film of the same name.  The general theme of nearly all of these Americanized remakes is stick with the original!  I know...some of you don't like to read subtitles but in the case of this film, the original is vastly better.  Jessica Alba continues to get starring roles without demonstrating any particular skill at acting and she's no better here.She plays a blind concert violinist named Sydney Wells who undergoes cornea transplant surgery to restore her sight.  The operation proves to be successful but soon after, Syndey begins experiencing horrific visions.  At first she thinks these are just nightmares and tries to pass them off but she soon becomes convinced that she's seeing things that the cornea donor saw.  Her Doctor (Nivola) thinks it's merely stress from dealing with the new sensations of her restored sight.Sydney continues to ""see dead people"" although why her eyes also allow her to HEAR dead people remains a mystery of the film.  The visions are mostly those fleeting glimpses designed to make you jump in your seat although they never amount to any prolonged tension.  Sydney is determined to find out who the donor is and what message they are trying to send with the visions.  While she will learn that donor had a sort of precognitive power to see people's deaths and attempt to prevent them.  This, however, doesn't explain why Sydney would see the ghost of a little boy in her building who is looking for his report card nor the ghost of the little girl in the hospital who died of cancer.  It's just one of the many senseless continuity gaffes in ""The Eye"".  Sydney is also able to see mysterious shadow creatures, which seemingly escort dead spirits off to wherever.  These creatures appear to be evil so are they devils?  They don't like that Sydney can see them but that plot twist goes virtually untapped.Alba is easy on the eyes (no pun intended) but she lacks any presence or charisma in this role.  The only real strength of her performance was her emotions and struggles as a formerly blind person who is able to see for the first time in decades.  As tedious as Alba was, her co-star Alessandro Nivola is even more boring.  He defiantly tells Sydney that he could ruin his career if he reveals who the donor is...and then he goes and steals the file anyway.The Eye freely borrows clich&eacute;s from just about every other J-Horror film that's been made in the last decade but none of them are exciting enough to save this film.  Sydney may have had her eyes opened in the film but she'll make ours close tightly.ExtrasThe Eye comes on two discs although the second disc features just a digital copy of the film that you can load on your PC or iPod.

1137685,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0012KJ0CG,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Jessica Alba is Sydney Wells, a concert violinist who has recently received an eye transplant. The operation is a success, but soon she starts seeing scary things that other people cannot see. Could it be that her new eyes are deceiving her, or is she just imagining things?The film's premise itself is fairly interesting, but ""The Eye"" fails to really interest us because of its derivative story and the lack of scare. It was a bit shocking for me to see the director team David Moreau and Xavier Palud, responsible for their brilliant film ""Them,"" using so many familiar tricks of horrors like sudden big sound or shadowy figure moving around.The 2002 Hong Kong film (directed by the Pang brothers), upon which this new version is based, made a good use of the premise against the background of the Asian locations and culture. It may not be the greatest horror film (or maybe I should not call it a horror as the story was more about the characters - the recipient and the donor - than about the terrors they experience), but the direction was imaginative and Angelica Lee's acting as the tormented heroine was splendid. Unfortunately Jessica Alba's performances as the terrified heroine is not as good as Lee's and supports including Alessandro Nivola and Parker Posey are not very memorable.As you know, films with stories related to ""the second sight"" are nothing new (remember ""The Eyes of Laura Mars""? or how about ""Blink""?) To create a truly engaging film, however, you need something more, something that makes the whole film more suspenseful or some clever twist as in ""The Dead Zone"" or, naturally, ""The Sixth Sense."" Though some may find the film is reasonably entertaining (and I have never said the film is terrible), ""The Eye"" needs original ways and ideas to develop the story.",2,"Not a Terrible Remake, But Maybe It's Time to Stop ...",1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,1794,"['Jessica', 'Alba', 'Sydney', 'Wells', 'concert', 'violinist', 'who', 'recently', 'received', 'eye', 'transplant', 'operation', 'success', 'soon', 'seeing', 'scary', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'Could', 'be', 'new', 'eyes', 'are', 'deceiving', 'just', 'imagining', 'things', 'film', 'premise', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'Eye', 'really', 'interest', 'derivative', 'story', 'lack', 'scare', 'was', 'bit', 'shocking', 'see', 'director', 'team', 'David', 'Moreau', 'Xavier', 'Palud', 'responsible', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Them', 'using', 'so', 'many', 'familiar', 'tricks', 'horrors', 'sudden', 'big', 'sound', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'moving', 'around.The', '2002', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'directed', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'new', 'version', 'based', 'made', 'good', 'use', 'premise', 'background', 'Asian', 'locations', 'culture', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'horror', 'film', 'maybe', 'should', 'not', 'call', 'horror', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'characters', 'recipient', 'donor', 'terrors', 'experience', 'direction', 'was', 'imaginative', 'Angelica', 'Lee', 'acting', 'tormented', 'heroine', 'was', 'splendid', 'Unfortunately', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'performances', 'terrified', 'heroine', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Lee', 'including', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'memorable.As', 'know', 'films', 'stories', 'related', 'second', 'sight', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'remember', 'Eyes', 'Laura', 'Mars', 'how', 'Blink', 'create', 'truly', 'engaging', 'film', 'however', 'need', 'something', 'more', 'something', 'whole', 'film', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'clever', 'twist', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'naturally', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'have', 'never', 'said', 'film', 'terrible', 'Eye', 'original', 'ways', 'ideas', 'develop', 'story']",The Eye

At least, there's an odd mix of really bad parts and really good parts.Of course, some things in this movie are pretty ridiculous. For example, the character of her therapist (the main character after Alba's) seems completely unprofessional and unconvincing, and the relationship between them is confusingly unrealistic. And it was really annoying how the ghosts she saw would sort of calmly drift away into the afterlife or wander off or something, and then for no apparent reason other than to shock the audience they'd suddenly jump out in front of her and go ""boo."" Why? Thank goodness they stopped doing that after the first twenty minutes or so.But some of this movie was actually kind of neat. The parts where she sees scary things but can hardly make them out through her post-surgery blurry-vision, rendered in first person for the audience to see, are very creepy. Alba's character seems to have no friends to turn to for help except her therapist, which gives the movie an odd atmosphere of desperation and loneliness. And the overall plot is basically exciting. The conclusion, thank goodness, is NOT one of those irritating nonsensical shock-value-only twists that most other films inspired by Chinese/Japanese horror movies have.So... seeing this really wasn't a total waste of nine dollars.",3,Not too bad.,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1351,"['movie', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'awful', 'expected', 'least', 'odd', 'mix', 'really', 'bad', 'parts', 'really', 'good', 'parts.Of', 'course', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'example', 'character', 'therapist', 'main', 'character', 'Alba', 'completely', 'unprofessional', 'unconvincing', 'relationship', 'confusingly', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'really', 'annoying', 'how', 'ghosts', 'saw', 'would', 'sort', 'calmly', 'drift', 'away', 'afterlife', 'wander', 'off', 'something', 'then', 'apparent', 'reason', 'other', 'shock', 'audience', ""'d"", 'suddenly', 'jump', 'out', 'front', 'go', 'boo', 'Why', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'stopped', 'doing', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so.But', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'neat', 'parts', 'where', 'scary', 'things', 'can', 'hardly', 'make', 'out', 'post-surgery', 'blurry-vision', 'rendered', 'first', 'person', 'audience', 'see', 'are', 'very', 'creepy', 'Alba', 'character', 'have', 'friends', 'turn', 'help', 'therapist', 'movie', 'odd', 'atmosphere', 'desperation', 'loneliness', 'overall', 'plot', 'basically', 'exciting', 'conclusion', 'thank', 'goodness', 'NOT', 'one', 'irritating', 'nonsensical', 'shock-value-only', 'twists', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'inspired', 'Chinese/Japanese', 'horror', 'movies', 'have.So', 'seeing', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'waste', 'nine', 'dollars']",The Eye

Jessica Alba plays the role of blind concert violinist Sydney Wells who receives a corneal transplant that allows her to see again (she lost her eyesight in a freak childhood accident). Trouble is, she sees more than she wants to as the transplant enables her to 'see' the supernatural world around her where the recently dead are escorted to the other side by supernatural beings, restless souls haunt their former homes, etc.It doesn't take too long before Sydney realizes there is more to her 'gift' and that she needs to find out the story of the donor in order to put an end to her own torment. She is aided by a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola). The action is fast-paced but I felt that the scary scenes were less credibly set up than in the original HK movie. It almost seems comical the way Sydney experiences one supernatural jolt after another. The effects were slick but I felt there was too much CGI and overly loud sound effects which did nothing to increase the spooky factor.The original movie had lots of atmosphere and genuinely creepy moments that had me practically jumping out of my seat (there's one scene in the original where the main character is taking a calligraphy lesson and a spirit literally attacks her out of nowhere for sitting in the departed soul's seat - very scary and nicely executed). Such scenes are lacking in this movie, and those that are meant to scare viewers fail to do so.Alba plays her role quite well, but it is not an extraordinary performance (I felt the HK actress was amazing and much more credible in the original). Nivola is ok as eye candy but not much else. Final verdict - watch the original if you can, it's a much more rewarding viewing experience, but if you absolutely can't stand a subtitled movie, then this serves as an OK substitute.",3,A less engaging rehash of the original HK movie,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1997,"[""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'HK', 'original', 'Eye', 'i.e', 'Jian', 'Gui', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'original', 'much', 'creepier', 'more', 'credibly', 'acted', 'remake', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'role', 'blind', 'concert', 'violinist', 'Sydney', 'Wells', 'who', 'corneal', 'transplant', 'see', 'again', 'lost', 'eyesight', 'freak', 'childhood', 'accident', 'Trouble', 'more', 'transplant', ""'see"", 'supernatural', 'world', 'where', 'recently', 'dead', 'are', 'escorted', 'other', 'side', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'restless', 'souls', 'haunt', 'former', 'homes', 'etc.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'Sydney', 'realizes', 'more', ""'gift"", 'find', 'out', 'story', 'donor', 'order', 'put', 'end', 'own', 'torment', 'aided', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Faulkner', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'felt', 'scary', 'scenes', 'were', 'less', 'credibly', 'set', 'up', 'original', 'HK', 'movie', 'almost', 'comical', 'way', 'Sydney', 'one', 'supernatural', 'jolt', 'effects', 'were', 'slick', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'overly', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'did', 'nothing', 'increase', 'spooky', 'factor.The', 'original', 'movie', 'had', 'lots', 'atmosphere', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'had', 'practically', 'jumping', 'seat', 'one', 'scene', 'original', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'taking', 'calligraphy', 'lesson', 'spirit', 'literally', 'nowhere', 'sitting', 'departed', 'soul', 'seat', 'very', 'scary', 'nicely', 'executed', 'Such', 'scenes', 'are', 'lacking', 'movie', 'are', 'meant', 'scare', 'viewers', 'fail', 'do', 'so.Alba', 'plays', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'felt', 'HK', 'actress', 'was', 'amazing', 'much', 'more', 'credible', 'original', 'Nivola', 'ok', 'eye', 'candy', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Final', 'verdict', 'watch', 'original', 'can', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'subtitled', 'movie', 'then', 'OK', 'substitute']",The Eye
