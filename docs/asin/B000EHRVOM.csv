973034,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EHRVOM,A Customer,"[5, 6]","It isn't easy being Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden, an effeminate young boy who likes to dress up in his mother's clothes and pop on some lippy. But he has a wicked sense of humor and a penchant for story telling, and it is these qualities that allow him to cope with growing up in the puritanical Ireland of the 1960's and 70's, where everyone either labels him as different or some kind of harbinger of the devil.Ma Braden (Ruth McCabe) curses the day she took the deviant infant in when he was left on the doorstep of a presbytery. Taken in by the parish priest (Liam Neeson) Patrick is raised by the elderly Ma Braden who is infuriated by this wayward and unusual boy. Patrick realizes that anyone who doesn't like the fact that he cross-dresses just can't be his mother. So off he goes to London to search for the mother who deserted him.The only clue to who she might be is that she bears a striking resemble to Mitzi Gaynor. In his mind's eye, he envisions her in soft blond curls riding on a red trolley car, and she becomes almost a mythical figure to him. Patrick's search is at a time of extreme conflict between the Irish Republican Army and British military and even though Patrick/Kitten abhors violence; he appears chameleon-like during harrowing moments and gets himself in all sorts of terrible situations.Breakfast on Pluto has a lovely bouncy ebullience - courtesy of a terrific period soundtrack - and the dashes of fantasy are beautifully melded into the film's quirky humor and quick-witted irreverence. But the film is very episodic and a little over-long for this type of material. The pacing is good, and the narrative is broken up into lots of short, sharp vignettes that never allow the movie to sag; yet the essential conceit of Patrick constantly looking for unconditional love does get a bit repetitive.It is the amazing Cillian Murphy who holds this film together and he is nothing short of astounding, and he also should have received an Oscar nomination. The irony is that in many of the drag scenes he looks better as a woman than as a man! It's a charming, understated performance, with Murphy expressing his character's androgyny as if it's the most natural thing in the world.The supporting players also provide richly nuanced roles: Ruth Negga is excellent as Charlie who accepts Patrick without question and Stephen Rea is also good as Bertie the Magician, a sweetly sad middle-aged man who takes wandering Patrick under his wing. Punk-rock pioneer Gavin Friday is amusing as a '70s glam-rocker who also cares for Patrick along the way. Bryan Ferry shows up as a ""john"" with evil intentions, and Brendan Gleeson also gets in on the act as Uncle Bulgaria, who convinces Patrick to join him working as one of the Wombles of Wimbledon Common.Although Breakfast on Pluto was released at the same time Transamerica, it was Transamerica that got most of the accolades - it was the better film. Yet, Breakfast On Pluto is still an offbeat delight, jammed with eccentric characters and spot-on performances.With all the troubles of the 1970's the IRA and the bomb attacks in London, Kitty remains the ultimate optimist, constantly bending reality to suit his own needs, believing that love will conquer all and hoping that one day he will realize his fantasy of finding his long lost mother.

973035,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000EHRVOM,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Admittedly, ""Tales-Of-Transvestites-Told-Using-IRA-Terrorism-As-A-Backdrop"" is a relatively small film genre.  That said, Breakfast On Pluto certainly leads the pack.  Ironically, the movie holding down the runner up position, The Crying Game, is also by director Neil Jordan.  The Crying Game was arguably the ultimate gadget film; everything rested on revealing its one very unsurprising surprise.  Breakfast On Pluto takes another approach; it doesn't try to be surprising at all.This picture has an awful lot going for it.  It certainly wins on quirky charm and likeability. The acting and cinematography are excellent, even some of the bit players are marquee names - Brian Ferry as a serial killer!  The soundtrack is simply marvelous, although occasionally song content is aimed at plot points heavy-handedly.  Cillian Murphy is quite amazing as Kitten, a boy who is gay and lives as a transvestite without ever actually making any attempt to switch genders.  Kitten is beyond different, especially in a small town in Northern Ireland, Kitten is unique.And so, like so many ""totally other"" characters, (space aliens, etc.), Kitten travels the long metaphorical road, encountering good people and bad.  Some are nice, some are cruel, some are both.  But no matter what happens, Kitten stays innocent and unchanged, in this way he holds a mirror up to society.  You will love the movie if you appreciate it at this level.  But I would say that Kitten's persistent innocence is maddening, and anyone who endures such a bizarre voyage of hurt and hardship without developing some sort of life-changing character is simply two-dimensional.Unlike The Crying Game, where it was integral, IRA bombings seem a bit artificial in Breakfast On Pluto - as in Hollywood the old saying goes, ""If things slow down, send in a helicopter.""  But this movie has heart, Murphy's performance as Kitten is remarkable, and underneath everything bizarre there is a universal, and touching, theme.",4,Served By Goofy,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,1978,"['Admittedly', 'Tales-Of-Transvestites-Told-Using-IRA-Terrorism-As-A-Backdrop', 'relatively', 'small', 'film', 'genre', 'said', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'certainly', 'pack', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'holding', 'down', 'runner', 'position', 'Crying', 'Game', 'also', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'Crying', 'Game', 'was', 'arguably', 'ultimate', 'gadget', 'film', 'everything', 'rested', 'revealing', 'one', 'very', 'unsurprising', 'surprise', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'approach', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'surprising', 'all.This', 'picture', 'awful', 'lot', 'going', 'certainly', 'quirky', 'charm', 'likeability', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'even', 'bit', 'players', 'are', 'marquee', 'names', 'Brian', 'Ferry', 'serial', 'killer', 'soundtrack', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'occasionally', 'song', 'content', 'aimed', 'plot', 'points', 'heavy-handedly', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'quite', 'amazing', 'Kitten', 'boy', 'who', 'gay', 'transvestite', 'ever', 'actually', 'making', 'attempt', 'switch', 'genders', 'Kitten', 'different', 'especially', 'small', 'town', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Kitten', 'unique.And', 'so', 'so', 'many', 'totally', 'other', 'characters', 'space', 'aliens', 'etc', 'Kitten', 'long', 'metaphorical', 'road', 'encountering', 'good', 'people', 'bad', 'are', 'nice', 'are', 'cruel', 'are', 'matter', 'what', 'Kitten', 'innocent', 'unchanged', 'way', 'mirror', 'up', 'society', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'level', 'would', 'say', 'Kitten', 'persistent', 'innocence', 'maddening', 'anyone', 'who', 'bizarre', 'voyage', 'hurt', 'hardship', 'developing', 'sort', 'life-changing', 'character', 'simply', 'two-dimensional.Unlike', 'Crying', 'Game', 'where', 'was', 'integral', 'IRA', 'bombings', 'seem', 'bit', 'artificial', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'Hollywood', 'old', 'saying', 'things', 'slow', 'down', 'send', 'helicopter', 'movie', 'heart', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'Kitten', 'remarkable', 'everything', 'bizarre', 'universal', 'touching', 'theme']",N/A
973036,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000EHRVOM,Andy Orrock,"[4, 4]","I agree with the reviewers here who call Neil Jordan's ""Breakfast on Pluto"" (do they rename it now to ""Breakfast on a Dwarf Planet""?) 'plodding' and 'too episodic.'  Jordan seems compelled to have squeezed every bit of Pat McCabe's novel into a film that tries to do too much.  At 135 minutes, my top-most reaction at the end of the film was that there were long stretches that almost stopped the film's momentum cold.  It seemed to labor towards the finish.That aside, 'Pluto' is a breakout star turn for Cillian Murphy.  I've been a fan since seeing the Irish 2003 ensemble piece 'Intermission,' a film Murphy walked away with despite the presence of some of Ireland's bigger names (Colm Meaney, Colin Farrell).Stephen Rea is excellent here as always.  The odder the role, the better he is.  His turn here will harken everyone to the winning Jordan/Rea ""Crying Game"" partnership.The 'making of' featurette doesn't add much value, except these two small things that stood out:* I learned 'Cillian' is pronounced with a hard 'C' (thus stopping me from sounding like an idiot while talking about this film).* I liked Murphy imploring Jordan to make the film soon because ""I only have a couple of years left to play the part.""

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","It's always a joy to find a film that falls outside the norms of casual cinema, which usually contain common plots, cookie-cutter characters, and bland stories. It's also enjoyable to see an extremely strong character portrayal by an actor who you probably couldn't have pictured in a particular role, but does such a stunning job that after watching the film you couldn't see anyone else playing it. Cillian Murphy (Red Eye (Widescreen Edition)is normally someone most movie-goers associate in the ""bad guy"" spotlight. But here, in BREAKFAST ON PLUTO, Murphy shows he's got some serious acting chops.Similar in terrain toTransamerica, the focus is on a transvestite named Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden. As an infant, he's left on the doorstep of a local Irish church and picked up by Father Liam (Liam Neeson,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition). Unable to locate the child's mother, Father Liam inserts the boy into an orphanage where, as he grows, we quickly see that he doesn't fit in. Punished for his impudent behavior, ""Kitten"" (as he likes to be called) moves from place to place and person to person looking for the mother who'd abandoned him.Not willing to give up until he finds her, his life leads him through IRA uprisings, bombings, sexual exploits of the most heinous kind, and eventually to London (""the city that swallowed up his mother"") where an encounter with his real mum gives him the realization that his life is his own and he needs to live it for himself, not for anyone else.The entire film is shot as if it were telling a story via a book (which of course it is based on); each section of Kitten's life is given a chapter number and title. This was pretty cool and a nice break from Hollyweird norm.The most shocking and comedic portions of the film are completely intermingled. Bombings of nightclubs in Ireland and England are put in hysterically funny contexts (one time leading Kitten to believe he/she could be a superhero who eliminates his/her foes by spraying them with a special caustic perfume, but in reality he/she has to deal with her Irish heritage in a country -- England -- that believes he/she to be a bombing suspect). Most of the time, Kitten's enemies quickly become his/her friend because of his/her friendly demeanor. Even interrogating policemen eventually come to care for Kitten which, again, was both shocking and funny.The film isn't without its flaw, however. The chapter periods are sometimes very short, only giving the audience a minor glimpse of situations and certain pivotal, lateral characters.But Murphy's performance is solid gold and makes this a VERY watchable flick.",4,"Cillian Murphy: More Than Just A ""Bad Guy""",1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,2675,"['always', 'joy', 'find', 'film', 'norms', 'casual', 'cinema', 'usually', 'contain', 'common', 'plots', 'cookie-cutter', 'characters', 'bland', 'stories', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'extremely', 'strong', 'character', 'portrayal', 'actor', 'who', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'pictured', 'particular', 'role', 'stunning', 'job', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Red', 'Eye', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'normally', 'someone', 'most', 'movie-goers', 'associate', 'bad', 'guy', 'spotlight', 'here', 'BREAKFAST', 'ON', 'PLUTO', 'Murphy', 'got', 'serious', 'acting', 'chops.Similar', 'terrain', 'toTransamerica', 'focus', 'transvestite', 'named', 'Patrick', 'Kitten', 'Braden', 'infant', 'left', 'doorstep', 'local', 'Irish', 'church', 'picked', 'up', 'Father', 'Liam', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Unable', 'locate', 'child', 'mother', 'Father', 'Liam', 'boy', 'orphanage', 'where', 'quickly', 'see', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Punished', 'impudent', 'behavior', 'Kitten', 'be', 'called', 'moves', 'place', 'place', 'person', 'person', 'looking', 'mother', 'who', ""'d"", 'abandoned', 'him.Not', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'IRA', 'uprisings', 'bombings', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'most', 'heinous', 'kind', 'eventually', 'London', 'city', 'swallowed', 'up', 'mother', 'where', 'encounter', 'real', 'mum', 'realization', 'life', 'own', 'live', 'not', 'anyone', 'else.The', 'entire', 'film', 'shot', 'were', 'telling', 'story', 'book', 'course', 'based', 'section', 'Kitten', 'life', 'given', 'chapter', 'number', 'title', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'nice', 'break', 'Hollyweird', 'most', 'shocking', 'comedic', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'intermingled', 'Bombings', 'nightclubs', 'Ireland', 'England', 'are', 'put', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'contexts', 'one', 'time', 'leading', 'Kitten', 'believe', 'he/she', 'could', 'be', 'superhero', 'who', 'foes', 'spraying', 'special', 'caustic', 'perfume', 'reality', 'he/she', 'deal', 'Irish', 'heritage', 'country', 'England', 'he/she', 'be', 'bombing', 'suspect', 'Most', 'time', 'Kitten', 'enemies', 'quickly', 'become', 'his/her', 'friend', 'his/her', 'friendly', 'demeanor', 'Even', 'interrogating', 'policemen', 'eventually', 'come', 'care', 'Kitten', 'again', 'was', 'shocking', 'funny.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'flaw', 'however', 'chapter', 'periods', 'are', 'sometimes', 'very', 'short', 'only', 'giving', 'audience', 'minor', 'glimpse', 'situations', 'certain', 'pivotal', 'lateral', 'characters.But', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'solid', 'gold', 'VERY', 'watchable', 'flick']",N/A

973039,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B000EHRVOM,Cecily Champagne,"[2, 3]","Several reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining Breakfast on Pluto's plot, so I'll keep it brief.  Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden is an Irish transvestite in search of his mother, a Mitzi Gaynor lookalike who abandoned him at birth.  Convinced that she has been ""swallowed up"" by the great city of London, he embarks on a journey in search of her - meeting a number of seedy characters (in a very Dickens-esque manner) along the way.Breakfast on Pluto is director Neil Jordan's second adaptation of a Patrick McCabe novel, his first being the 1997 film, the Butcher Boy.  It is no surprise, then, that Breakfast on Pluto resembles the Butcher Boy in a number of ways: both films examine the life of a young Irishman (a social deviant, very much a product of his childhood); both are funny and irreverent; both contain a number of surreal, cerebral images; and both successfully manage to capture the tone of McCabe's writing, which is simultaneously morbid and delightfully jubilant.  Unfortunately, while the Butcher Boy is able to reproduce not only the tone, but also the *essence* of McCabe's novel, Breakfast on Pluto misses the mark (I think it's telling that McCabe was the screenwriter for the TBB, while Jordan penned BOP).It is difficult for a movie to exactly replicate a book, so I really have no problem with some of the liberties Jordan took with the plot.  I do, however, have a bit of a problem with the way he glossed over the darkness and poignancy of McCabe's story.  Don't get me wrong.  The film is still difficult at times (the IRA attacks; Kitten's run-in with a violent strangler; his simple and yet unfulfilled desire to be loved ...) - but it is, nonetheless, much more conservative and optimistic  than the book.  I will avoid spelling out these differences for fear of spoiling the story, but let me just say that the changes Jordan made are huge.With that said, anyone who hasn't read McCabe's book will probably really like this movie.  It is, after all, very entertaining and touching.  And Cillian Murphy is amazing as Kitten.  If you *have* read Breakfast on Pluto - I wouldn't exactly discourage you from seeing this film; I would simply advise that you try to forget about McCabe's story.  Comparatively, the movie is very different and inferior.

The same Neil Jordan who made such serious non-musical and non-episodic fare as ""Mona Lisa,"" ""Michael Collins"" and ""The Butcher Boy"" (and comes dangerously close here to making the same movie twice, having previously made the more, er, straight-laced transvestite-amidst-the-IRA classic ""The Crying Game"" (also with Stephen Rea)) manages to break free from most of his previous directorial rhythms and create the same kind of mixture of the hilarious and the horrific, the grandiose and the grotesque, the outrageous and the understated that John Cameron Mitchell so ably concocted in Hedwig.So is it strange that Neil Jordan has made more of a Hedwig II than its own originator has?  Well, it would seem that way at first - until you listen to the commentary track and hear that the main reason Jordan specifically wanted to revisit what some might consider old material was because he loved the attitude brought to the proceedings by the main character Kitten (luminously played by Cillian Murphy, whose eyes all but blaze with a quiet strength) - so brave yet childishly naive.  To shine a light of absurdity on aspects of Jordan's prior works that Kitten would chastise as being ""so serious, serious.""  (And, to be fair, I doubt John Cameron Mitchell would be satisfied rehashing ""Hedwig"" for the rest of his moviemaking career...)Still, for Hedwig fans, the similarities abound - from the main character's difficult transvestitism and its glam rock accoutrements to the colorful energy infused into almost every scene.  Here, however, instead of Hedwig's heartbroken callousness, borne of an abandoned lover, Kitten is able maintain an innocence and purity amidst her heartbreak, which itself is borne of an abandoned mother.A couple of notes I didn't see in the other reviews here: 1) in addition to the much-mentioned standout supporting performances by Liam Neeson and Rea, also very noteworthy is the outstanding job first time actor Gavin Friday does in his portrayal of glam rock show band singer Billy Hatchet.  2) Be on the lookout for Patrick McCabe (the author upon whose work this film is based) in an amusing turn as the affronted teacher at Kitten's school.Though not a musical per se, this is a very music heavy film, with the traditional score being replaced by the songs of the era.  I would definitely recommend this movie to those who loved Hedwig - for those who wish that there would be a sequel, I think this is as close as another film is going to come without being completely derivative.  And for all those who haven't yet seen Hedwig, suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this film greatly if you enjoy quirky, energetic, sweeping and episodic cinema that isn't afraid to mine comedy from some pretty dark places.(p.s. the title quote for this review is one of Kitten's many provocative utterances.  And if you don't find it particularly funny, well that's probably an indication that this movie is not for you...)",5,"""So if I wasn't a transvestite terrorist, would you marry me?""",1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,3356,"['Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'shortly', 'seeing', 'Shortbus', 'finding', 'tiny', 'bit', 'lacking', 'comparison', 'predecessor', 'creator', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'come', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'find', 'true', 'cinematic', 'sibling', 'real', 'companion/follow-up', 'Hedwig', 'actually', 'been', 'made', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'Wait', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'true', 'same', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'who', 'made', 'such', 'serious', 'non-musical', 'non-episodic', 'fare', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'Butcher', 'Boy', 'dangerously', 'close', 'here', 'making', 'same', 'movie', 'twice', 'having', 'previously', 'made', 'more', 'er', 'straight-laced', 'transvestite-amidst-the-IRA', 'classic', 'Crying', 'Game', 'also', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'break', 'free', 'most', 'previous', 'directorial', 'rhythms', 'create', 'same', 'kind', 'mixture', 'hilarious', 'horrific', 'grandiose', 'grotesque', 'outrageous', 'understated', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'so', 'ably', 'concocted', 'Hedwig.So', 'strange', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'made', 'more', 'Hedwig', 'II', 'own', 'originator', 'Well', 'would', 'seem', 'way', 'first', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'hear', 'main', 'reason', 'Jordan', 'specifically', 'wanted', 'revisit', 'what', 'might', 'consider', 'old', 'material', 'was', 'loved', 'attitude', 'brought', 'proceedings', 'main', 'character', 'Kitten', 'luminously', 'played', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'eyes', 'quiet', 'strength', 'so', 'brave', 'childishly', 'naive', 'shine', 'light', 'absurdity', 'aspects', 'Jordan', 'prior', 'works', 'Kitten', 'would', 'chastise', 'being', 'so', 'serious', 'serious', 'be', 'fair', 'doubt', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'rehashing', 'Hedwig', 'rest', 'moviemaking', 'career', 'Still', 'Hedwig', 'fans', 'similarities', 'abound', 'main', 'character', 'difficult', 'transvestitism', 'glam', 'rock', 'accoutrements', 'colorful', 'energy', 'infused', 'almost', 'scene', 'Here', 'however', 'instead', 'Hedwig', 'heartbroken', 'callousness', 'borne', 'abandoned', 'lover', 'Kitten', 'able', 'maintain', 'innocence', 'purity', 'amidst', 'heartbreak', 'borne', 'abandoned', 'mother.A', 'couple', 'notes', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', '1', 'addition', 'much-mentioned', 'standout', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Rea', 'also', 'very', 'noteworthy', 'outstanding', 'job', 'first', 'time', 'actor', 'Gavin', 'Friday', 'portrayal', 'glam', 'rock', 'show', 'band', 'singer', 'Billy', 'Hatchet', '2', 'Be', 'lookout', 'Patrick', 'McCabe', 'author', 'work', 'film', 'based', 'amusing', 'turn', 'affronted', 'teacher', 'Kitten', 'school.Though', 'not', 'musical', 'per', 'se', 'very', 'music', 'heavy', 'film', 'traditional', 'score', 'being', 'replaced', 'songs', 'era', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'loved', 'Hedwig', 'who', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'sequel', 'think', 'as', 'close', 'film', 'going', 'come', 'being', 'completely', 'derivative', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'Hedwig', 'suffice', 'say', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'quirky', 'energetic', 'sweeping', 'episodic', 'cinema', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'mine', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'dark', 'places.', 'p.s', 'title', 'quote', 'review', 'one', 'Kitten', 'many', 'provocative', 'utterances', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'funny', 'well', 'probably', 'indication', 'movie', 'not']",N/A

973044,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EHRVOM,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Released in theaters last December at the same time as Duncan Tucker's similarly themed ""Transamerica"", this latest film from writer-director Neil Jordan unfortunately pales by comparison in sharing the plight of Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden, a hopelessly romantic transvestite who gets caught up with the IRA in the early 1970's while he looks for his long-lost mother in London. Both movies deal with gender reassignment as a desperate yet inevitable means toward self-fulfillment for the conflicted protagonists. In Jordan's 2005 film, the political backdrop makes for a vibrant, volatile landscape, but Patrick's dilemmas don't provide enough of a counterbalance to make the two halves of the movie meld seamlessly. Part of the problem is that Patrick is conceived as such an oblivious, self-involved character that it's challenging to empathize with his struggle to find either his mother or his identity.Fortunately, Jordan has cast the brilliant Cillian Murphy to play Patrick in his trademark unsettling manner. However, on a different path from the one he takes as the Scarecrow in ""Batman Begins"", he uses his chilly style to avoid sentimentalizing his off-kilter character unnecessarily. We follow Patrick from the day his mother leaves him on the steps of the church through his turbulent childhood with an intolerant foster family to a heady romance with Billy Rock, the lead singer of a traveling rockabilly band. It's Billy's clandestine involvement with the IRA that gets Patrick inextricably linked to their revolutionary activities. The band forces Billy to dump Patrick, and he subsequently works as an assistant to Bertie, a magician with a most bloody act, and then as a costumed helper for a theme park character named Uncle Bulgaria. Things hit rock bottom when Patrick hits the streets as a hustler and then as a peep show attraction. This is when the facts of his parentage come to life, and he resolves to confront his past.As he proved with 1992's ""The Crying Game"", Jordan is gifted when it comes to establishing the right atmosphere, especially when he sets his stories in his native Ireland. Declan Quinn's saturated camerawork also helps to set the right mood. Even more  effective is the judicious used of period-authentic pop music to help move the film along, as does Jordan's playful conceits like the subtitled robins acting as a chorus and breaking the film down into thirty-six chapters with ironic titles. The supporting actors are all strong - Gavin Friday as Billy, Stephen Rea as Bertie, Brendan Gleeson as Uncle Bulgaria, and best of all, Liam Neeson as the emotionally coiled Father Bernard. At 135 minutes, the movie runs on too long in too episodic a fashion, and the ending, while inevitable, rings a bit hollow. But Murphy's turn is worthwhile experiencing mostly for the sheer audacity of his approach. The best feature of the DVD is Jordan's commentary track. Although he is joined by Murphy, Jordan dominates with his insights and anecdotes. There is also a brief, none-too-interesting making-of featurette included.",3,Cillian Murphy's Audacious Turn Hampered by Plodding Story Structure and Ill-Used Political Backdrop,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,3062,"['Released', 'theaters', 'last', 'December', 'same', 'time', 'Duncan', 'Tucker', 'similarly', 'themed', 'Transamerica', 'latest', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'unfortunately', 'comparison', 'sharing', 'plight', 'Patrick', 'Kitten', 'Braden', 'hopelessly', 'romantic', 'transvestite', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'IRA', 'early', '1970', 'long-lost', 'mother', 'London', 'Both', 'movies', 'deal', 'gender', 'reassignment', 'desperate', 'yet', 'inevitable', 'means', 'self-fulfillment', 'conflicted', 'protagonists', 'Jordan', '2005', 'film', 'political', 'backdrop', 'vibrant', 'volatile', 'landscape', 'Patrick', 'dilemmas', 'do', ""n't"", 'provide', 'enough', 'counterbalance', 'make', 'two', 'halves', 'movie', 'meld', 'seamlessly', 'Part', 'problem', 'Patrick', 'conceived', 'such', 'oblivious', 'self-involved', 'character', 'challenging', 'empathize', 'struggle', 'find', 'mother', 'identity.Fortunately', 'Jordan', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'play', 'Patrick', 'trademark', 'unsettling', 'manner', 'However', 'different', 'path', 'one', 'Scarecrow', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'chilly', 'style', 'avoid', 'sentimentalizing', 'off-kilter', 'character', 'unnecessarily', 'follow', 'Patrick', 'day', 'mother', 'steps', 'church', 'turbulent', 'childhood', 'intolerant', 'foster', 'family', 'heady', 'romance', 'Billy', 'Rock', 'lead', 'singer', 'traveling', 'rockabilly', 'band', 'Billy', 'clandestine', 'involvement', 'IRA', 'Patrick', 'inextricably', 'linked', 'revolutionary', 'activities', 'band', 'forces', 'Billy', 'dump', 'Patrick', 'subsequently', 'assistant', 'Bertie', 'magician', 'most', 'bloody', 'act', 'then', 'costumed', 'helper', 'theme', 'park', 'character', 'named', 'Uncle', 'Bulgaria', 'Things', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'when', 'Patrick', 'streets', 'hustler', 'then', 'peep', 'show', 'attraction', 'when', 'facts', 'parentage', 'come', 'life', 'confront', 'past.As', 'proved', '1992', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Jordan', 'gifted', 'when', 'establishing', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'when', 'stories', 'native', 'Ireland', 'Declan', 'Quinn', 'saturated', 'camerawork', 'also', 'set', 'right', 'mood', 'Even', 'more', 'effective', 'judicious', 'used', 'period-authentic', 'pop', 'music', 'help', 'move', 'film', 'along', 'Jordan', 'playful', 'conceits', 'subtitled', 'robins', 'acting', 'chorus', 'breaking', 'film', 'down', 'thirty-six', 'chapters', 'ironic', 'titles', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'strong', 'Gavin', 'Friday', 'Billy', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Bertie', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Uncle', 'Bulgaria', 'best', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'emotionally', 'coiled', 'Father', 'Bernard', '135', 'minutes', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'episodic', 'fashion', 'ending', 'inevitable', 'bit', 'hollow', 'Murphy', 'turn', 'worthwhile', 'experiencing', 'mostly', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'approach', 'best', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Jordan', 'commentary', 'track', 'joined', 'Murphy', 'Jordan', 'insights', 'anecdotes', 'also', 'brief', 'none-too-interesting', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'included']",N/A

However, I have to be true to myself and give it the rating I have.Yes, Cillian Murphy is a star and he is the lead of this film. Yes, Neil Jordan directed it. Yes, Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleason, Liam Neeson and several other major UK actors appear in it. Yes, it is based on the book by the same name.But what is the point? I just didn't get it.Patrick is an orphaned boy who grows up with with a local Cavan (Ireland) woman who adopts him. He rejects her at every turn and decides early on that he wants to be a woman and find his own mother. Apparently in this tiny little Irish hamlet there is no such thing as homophobia as Patrick (to the viewer's eye) does not receive much adverse reaction from the other boys (only the priests and the women in town). He eventually leaves, adopts the name Kitten, and goes to London to find his mother who abandoned him. Why? Well, ostensibly to find out why he was abandoned and also to glean some nugget of truth from this supposed ""Mitzi Gaynor"" lookalike. Along the way he ""joins"" a band, gets involved with the IRA, a magician, and then becomes a peep show oddity. In each situation, he manages to truly avoid any REAL adverse reaction to his lite-drag personoa. Sure, he almost gets killed by a man in a car (former Roxy Music lead Bryan Ferry), but he comes out of that somewhat unscathed as well. It plays like farce at times and then other times it is serious. It is uncertain how the director wants us to truly react to the whole thing (there are CGI birdies throughout the film that speak to the audience and each other).Cillian Murphy as Kitten is oddly svelte enough to carry the part. Something of a pretty boy actor, Murphy is a formidible actor. I like him! I just didn't understand this character.I truly believe that this film scores high marks with some people who may or may not identify with the lead character's seeming separation from society. However, it did not ""speak"" to me.I found it overly drawn out and quite boring, largely. The only interesting aspects for me were the IRA involved ones.I'm assuming that ""Kitten's"" search for his mother was the sole driving force in his young life. However upon meeting his mother, he must have had some sort of catharsis that didn't come through the screen, because I didn't ""get"" that he no longer needed her. I also didn't see any change in Kitten's life as a result of having met his/her mother.Jordan's own The Crying Game more aptly connected with the disenfranchisement that a transvestite feels than this film did.Acting aside, I found this film a complete waste of my time.",1,Okay.....I guess I didn't get it,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,2691,"['would', 'seem', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'am', 'completely', 'base', 'review', 'However', 'have', 'be', 'true', 'myself', 'give', 'rating', 'have.Yes', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'star', 'lead', 'film', 'Yes', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'directed', 'Yes', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Brendan', 'Gleason', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'several', 'other', 'major', 'UK', 'actors', 'appear', 'Yes', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name.But', 'what', 'point', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Patrick', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'local', 'Cavan', 'Ireland', 'woman', 'who', 'turn', 'early', 'be', 'woman', 'find', 'own', 'mother', 'Apparently', 'tiny', 'little', 'Irish', 'hamlet', 'such', 'thing', 'as', 'homophobia', 'Patrick', 'viewer', 'eye', 'not', 'receive', 'much', 'adverse', 'reaction', 'other', 'boys', 'only', 'priests', 'women', 'town', 'eventually', 'name', 'Kitten', 'London', 'find', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'Why', 'Well', 'ostensibly', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'abandoned', 'also', 'glean', 'nugget', 'truth', 'supposed', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'lookalike', 'way', 'band', 'involved', 'IRA', 'magician', 'then', 'peep', 'show', 'oddity', 'situation', 'truly', 'avoid', 'REAL', 'adverse', 'reaction', 'lite-drag', 'personoa', 'Sure', 'almost', 'killed', 'man', 'car', 'former', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'lead', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'somewhat', 'unscathed', 'as', 'well', 'farce', 'times', 'then', 'other', 'times', 'serious', 'uncertain', 'how', 'director', 'truly', 'react', 'whole', 'thing', 'are', 'CGI', 'birdies', 'film', 'audience', 'other', '.Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Kitten', 'oddly', 'svelte', 'enough', 'carry', 'part', 'Something', 'pretty', 'boy', 'actor', 'Murphy', 'formidible', 'actor', 'like', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'character.I', 'truly', 'believe', 'film', 'high', 'marks', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'identify', 'lead', 'character', 'seeming', 'separation', 'society', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'me.I', 'overly', 'drawn', 'out', 'quite', 'boring', 'largely', 'only', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'were', 'IRA', 'involved', 'ones.I', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Kitten', 'search', 'mother', 'was', 'sole', 'driving', 'force', 'young', 'life', 'However', 'meeting', 'mother', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'sort', 'catharsis', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'change', 'Kitten', 'life', 'result', 'having', 'met', 'mother.Jordan', 'own', 'Crying', 'Game', 'more', 'aptly', 'connected', 'disenfranchisement', 'transvestite', 'feels', 'film', 'did.Acting', 'aside', 'found', 'film', 'complete', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

The priest hurriedly places the infant with a foster mother and we watch the little boy Patrick Braden slowly grow into a cross-dressing child with outsider friends, loathed by his adopted mother to the point where he is unable to cope with life as a lie and makes off to London as a transvestite gay man (now going by the name 'Kitten Braden').  He hopes to find his birth mother and his search leads him through the dregs of London, the city that 'swallowed up' his real mother, becoming involved with the seamier side of the city, jailed mistakenly, becoming an apprentice to a magician (Stephen Rea), a cabaret singer, etc until he finally makes the discovery of his beginnings - his true parents - and his journey to find happiness ends sweetly.The entire cast of this long (over two hours) film is so fine that never for an instant does the pace of the tale let up.  The cinematography by Declan Quinn is splendid, the costumes by Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh are some of the best recreations of the 70's on film, and the musical score by Anna Jordan mixes her own creations with the wonderful tunes from the era and the result is brilliantly integrated into the film.  Director Neil Jordan adapted the screenplay from Patrick McCabe's fine novel and finds all the magic and makes it visual.  But in the long run if we are unable to identify and care about Patrick 'Kitten' Braden the movie would seem silly.  Cillian Murphy is such an honest actor (having spent time pre-production living with transvestites about whom he speaks so tenderly in the featurette) and gives a multifaceted, glitteringly fine performance.  This is a fun, entertaining, and important film.  Highly Recommended for all audiences!

Sondel - lover of the arts""","[41, 45]","Adapted for the screen and directed by Neil Jordan, ""Breakfast on Pluto,"" based on the novel by Patrick McCabe, is the story of Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden, a gay Candide, off on a kaleidoscopic journey of self discovery.  As you'd expect from the creators of ""The Butcher Boy,"" this is a strange little film, episodic to the extreme, with a surreal quality and a unique kinetic energy.Left on the doorstep of a parish priest in a small Irish village, our kitten is placed in the home of a lady shopkeeper who hasn't the ability to cope with, let alone nurture, a cross-dressing boy all to quickly developing into a flamboyantly gay man.  One confrontation too many and our kitten hits the road in search of love and the mother who abandoned him.  His resulting adventures include professional and romantic entanglements, prostitution, mistaken identity, false imprisonment, attempted murder and, most poignantly, a happy ending.As Kitten, Cillian Murphy is a revelation.  I've seen a number of straight actors play gay transvestites and have rarely been impressed, feeling most fail to connect or communicate any of the inner juice of their characters, delivering performances that are hollow and false.  Murphy, star of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later,"" nails it.  He rises to the challenges and demands of his role, bringing Patrick Braden to life in all his ambiguous glory.  Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea, both Jordan regulars, standout among the supporting players, each quietly affecting in rather tricky roles.Neil Jordan has been making emotionally charged, character driven dramas for more than twenty years.  Along with ""Mona Lisa,"" ""The Butcher Boy,"" ""The End of the Affair"" and the Oscar winning ""The Crying Game,"" ""Breakfast on Pluto"" ranks among this great filmmaker's very best efforts.

973050,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,B000EHRVOM,James Carragher,"[34, 41]","Breakfast on Pluto has two slight strikes against it that make it easy to overlook. First, despite many differences it immediately recalls Neil Jordan's earlier Crying Game in its subject matter and IRA-struggles context. Second, there are at least two higher profile gay and/or gender bending-themed movies around this season. But this film stands strongly on its own merits. Cillian Murphy (last seen in the 180 degree different Red Eye) plays Kitten Braden, a boy who wants (and largely succeeds) to be a girl, who wants to find his Phantom Lady mother who abandoned him as a baby, and who wants to live happily in a world that is entirely too -- in his/her words -- ""serious, serious."" The foundling journey tale is at least as old as Tom Jones and Kitten's particular one includes wrenching moments of cruelty and violence perpetrated on him, some witnessed violence against the IRA backdrop, emotional pain, unexpected kindnesses from unexpected sources, and, finally, a certain peace, happiness and reward. Some of Kitten's life chapters, as the movie constructs them, feel overdone or superflous about a third of the way through the film, but it steadily gathers power and depth, while always retaining its light touch, right to the end and its reference to Oscar Wilde. Throughout, Murphy is pitch perfect, every inch a Kitten, but never entirely losing his maleness. It is acting at its best. Stephen Rea is excellent as the magician who befriends, loves, but also exploits Kitten. Ditto for Liam Neeson as a priest. Humane, knowing and triumphant, Breakfast on Pluto and Kitten Braden are as real a story as you will see in movies this or any year.",4,Nearly Five Stars,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1659,"['Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'two', 'slight', 'strikes', 'make', 'easy', 'overlook', 'First', 'many', 'differences', 'immediately', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'earlier', 'Crying', 'Game', 'subject', 'matter', 'IRA-struggles', 'context', 'Second', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'higher', 'profile', 'gay', 'and/or', 'gender', 'bending-themed', 'movies', 'season', 'film', 'strongly', 'own', 'merits', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'last', 'seen', '180', 'degree', 'different', 'Red', 'Eye', 'Kitten', 'Braden', 'boy', 'who', 'largely', 'be', 'girl', 'who', 'find', 'Phantom', 'Lady', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'baby', 'who', 'live', 'happily', 'world', 'entirely', 'too', 'his/her', 'words', 'serious', 'serious', 'foundling', 'journey', 'tale', 'least', 'as', 'old', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Kitten', 'particular', 'one', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'cruelty', 'violence', 'perpetrated', 'witnessed', 'violence', 'IRA', 'backdrop', 'emotional', 'pain', 'unexpected', 'kindnesses', 'unexpected', 'sources', 'finally', 'certain', 'peace', 'happiness', 'reward', 'Kitten', 'life', 'chapters', 'movie', 'feel', 'overdone', 'superflous', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'steadily', 'power', 'depth', 'always', 'retaining', 'light', 'touch', 'right', 'end', 'reference', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Throughout', 'Murphy', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'inch', 'Kitten', 'never', 'entirely', 'losing', 'maleness', 'acting', 'best', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'excellent', 'magician', 'who', 'loves', 'also', 'Kitten', 'Ditto', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'priest', 'Humane', 'knowing', 'triumphant', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'Kitten', 'Braden', 'are', 'real', 'story', 'will', 'see', 'movies', 'year']",N/A
973051,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000EHRVOM,Jonathan Appleseed,"[11, 15]","Cillian Murphy's performance in Breakfast on Pluto is nothing short of astonishing. Although I'd never thought of him playing a transvestite, upon seeing him it was readily apparent that he was born to play one. It didn't take much makeup for him to appear ""womanly"", but far beyond that were his remarkably spot-on affectations. Every single movement he made, be it dancing, pointing, walking, trying to hop, smiling, making moon eyes at almost any male that would give him attention - whatever - he *was* ""Kitten."" Of all the performances by men playing transvestites or transsexuals, his by far outshines all others. I'm going to refer to Murphy's character as ""she"", because that's what Kitten would have liked. &lt;grin>As a baby, Kitten was placed on the doorstep of a church, thereby orphaned. (Have you ever wondered what has happened to children left on church doorsteps when nobody's home? Say the Father [or Sister] is on vacation, or they're sleeping and it rains at night...) The Father arranged for him to be raised by another woman. While in Catholic school, he drove the Father's mad. 1) He wrote a fanciful story describing his conception which, in a Catholic school, was particularly lewd; 2) When a Father acknowledged that at their age they would have ""questions"" (i.e., sexual questions), Kitten dropped a note in the question box about how to go about getting a sex change. There were others...all fairly hysterical, and although she didn't put the face to it, they were pleas for affection/attention.Kitten had an indomitable spirit. No matter what hell she was placed in, somehow she rose above it, even in her own innocent navet&eacute;. One of the most insightful scenes in the movie involved the club bombing. A handsome young man spotted her ""across the bar"", and bought her a drink. They then danced, ironically to a song that her first love, a musician she traveled with when she first home, sang. She asked this young man to pretend his name was that of her first love, and he agrees. That was touching and sentimental, and showed a very important side of Kitten, one that holds on to things regardless of circumstance. Then a bomb goes off, wounding many, and probably killing some. Kitten herself is terribly wounded, and is taken away in an ambulance. We then see Kitten in an interrogation room being knocked around by a detective (or whatever they call them across the ocean) because he believes that Kitten, being Irish, had something to do with it. They kept him there for seven days - the maximum they could keep him - and while he jokingly or perhaps insanely made admissions of guilt, they knew that he wasn't being serious. But because he was Irish, they figured he was in on the scheme.When he is finally released, he begs them to allow him to stay. He doesn't want to be released back into a world where everything and everyone is so ""serious"", but they toss him out. They can't keep him any longer. Watching him beg to stay was disturbing, but for the first time, really, we saw that although he was in a world that he found far too ""serious"" and was existing in it bravely, that world terrified him. He would have preferred to stay in jail.The ""epic"" in this story is the quest for Kitten to find his birth mother, and all the different places that quest takes him - even while he is waylaid at times from this, usually for a man, as he will accept the affection and attention that almost any man will give him. It's so horribly sad to see such desperation - which Murphy and those eyes of his display so perfectly.Whether he finds his mother is significant, and if I spoke about the results of his quest it would be like telling someone that never watched or read The Lord of the Rings that Gollum bit Frodo's ring finger off and fell into the fires of Mount Doom. (I feel safe saying this because the books have sold almost 200 million copies and the movies generated 2.9 billion dollars.)But it is the epic quest that he's on, and whether he completes it, and if so how it affects him, is significant.However it plays out...it will be a joy for you to watch.",5,Murphy purrs like a kitten,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,4107,"['Cillian', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'nothing', 'short', 'astonishing', ""'d"", 'never', 'thought', 'playing', 'transvestite', 'seeing', 'was', 'readily', 'apparent', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'makeup', 'appear', 'womanly', 'far', 'were', 'remarkably', 'spot-on', 'affectations', 'single', 'movement', 'made', 'be', 'dancing', 'pointing', 'walking', 'trying', 'hop', 'smiling', 'making', 'moon', 'eyes', 'almost', 'male', 'would', 'give', 'attention', 'Kitten', 'performances', 'men', 'playing', 'transvestites', 'transsexuals', 'far', 'outshines', 'others', ""'m"", 'going', 'refer', 'Murphy', 'character', 'what', 'Kitten', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'lt', '>', 'baby', 'Kitten', 'was', 'placed', 'doorstep', 'church', 'thereby', 'orphaned', 'Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'children', 'left', 'church', 'doorsteps', 'when', 'nobody', 'home', 'Say', 'Father', '[', 'Sister', ']', 'vacation', ""'re"", 'sleeping', 'night', 'Father', 'arranged', 'be', 'raised', 'woman', 'Catholic', 'school', 'drove', 'Father', 'mad', '1', 'wrote', 'fanciful', 'story', 'describing', 'conception', 'Catholic', 'school', 'was', 'particularly', 'lewd', '2', 'When', 'Father', 'acknowledged', 'age', 'would', 'have', 'questions', 'i.e.', 'sexual', 'questions', 'Kitten', 'dropped', 'note', 'question', 'box', 'how', 'go', 'getting', 'sex', 'change', 'were', 'others', 'fairly', 'hysterical', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'face', 'were', 'pleas', 'affection/attention.Kitten', 'had', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'placed', 'somehow', 'rose', 'even', 'own', 'innocent', 'navet', 'eacute', 'One', 'most', 'insightful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'involved', 'club', 'bombing', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'spotted', 'bar', 'bought', 'drink', 'then', 'danced', 'ironically', 'song', 'first', 'love', 'musician', 'traveled', 'when', 'first', 'home', 'sang', 'asked', 'young', 'man', 'pretend', 'name', 'was', 'first', 'love', 'was', 'touching', 'sentimental', 'showed', 'very', 'important', 'side', 'Kitten', 'one', 'things', 'regardless', 'circumstance', 'Then', 'bomb', 'off', 'wounding', 'many', 'probably', 'killing', 'Kitten', 'terribly', 'wounded', 'taken', 'away', 'ambulance', 'then', 'see', 'Kitten', 'interrogation', 'room', 'being', 'knocked', 'detective', 'call', 'ocean', 'Kitten', 'being', 'Irish', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'kept', 'seven', 'days', 'maximum', 'could', 'keep', 'jokingly', 'perhaps', 'insanely', 'made', 'admissions', 'guilt', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'serious', 'was', 'Irish', 'figured', 'was', 'scheme.When', 'finally', 'released', 'allow', 'stay', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'released', 'back', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'everyone', 'so', 'serious', 'toss', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'longer', 'Watching', 'beg', 'stay', 'was', 'disturbing', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'saw', 'was', 'world', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'serious', 'was', 'existing', 'bravely', 'world', 'terrified', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'stay', 'jail.The', 'epic', 'story', 'quest', 'Kitten', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'different', 'places', 'quest', 'even', 'waylaid', 'times', 'usually', 'man', 'will', 'accept', 'affection', 'attention', 'almost', 'man', 'will', 'give', 'so', 'horribly', 'sad', 'see', 'such', 'desperation', 'Murphy', 'eyes', 'display', 'so', 'perfectly.Whether', 'mother', 'significant', 'spoke', 'results', 'quest', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'someone', 'never', 'watched', 'read', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Gollum', 'bit', 'Frodo', 'ring', 'finger', 'fell', 'fires', 'Mount', 'Doom', 'feel', 'safe', 'saying', 'books', 'have', 'sold', 'almost', '200', 'million', 'copies', 'movies', 'generated', '2.9', 'billion', 'dollars', 'epic', 'quest', 'so', 'how', 'significant.However', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'joy', 'watch']",N/A

Brown ""judybrowni""","[0, 0]","Breakfast on Pluto is a 2005 comedy-drama film directed by Neil Jordan (director of Interview with the Vampire and the Crying Game) based on the novel of the same name by Patrick McCabe, as adapted by Jordan and McCabe. This dark comedy stars Cillian Murphy as a transgender foundling searching for love and her long-lost mother in small town Ireland and London in the 1970s.An Irish boy becomes an emotional and sexual outcast as the 1960s fade into the 1970s in this period drama from director Neil Jordan. When he was just a baby in the early '60s, Patrick Braden (Conor McEvoy) was abandoned by his mother and left on the doorstep of a church overseen by Father Bernard (Liam Neeson). Placed in a foster home, sensitive Patrick doesn't much care for the emotionally chilly attitude of his new ""family,"" and psychologically buffers himself against the world by writing stories that make fun of Father Bernard and the other authority figures in his life. As he grows into adulthood, Patrick (played as an adult by Cillian Murphy) also discovers that he enjoys dressing in women's clothes and prefers the company of men, and as a teenager he falls into an affair with Billy Hatchet (Gavin Friday), a nightclub performer who also runs guns for the Irish Republican Army. In the early '70s, Patrick -- who has since taken on the drag name ""Kitten"" -- makes his way to London, where he becomes involved with Bertie (Stephen Rea), a small-time nightclub magician who gives the young man a place to say, a sense of security, and a job as his on-stage assistant. However, Patrick's idyllic life with Bertie proves short-lived when his old friends come to town on IRA ""business."" Breakfast on Pluto also features a supporting performance from former Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry.Breakfast on Pluto, Patrick McCabe's lyrical and haunting new novel, became a #1 bestseller in Ireland, stayed on the bestseller list for months, and was nominated for the Booker Prize, one of the world's most prestigious literary awards.With wonderful delicacy and subtle insight and intimation, McCabe creates Mr. Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden, the enduringly and endearingly hopeful hero(ine) whose gutsy survival and yearning quest for love resonate in and drive the glimmering, agonizing narrative in which the troubles are a distant and immediate echo and refrain. Twenty years ago, her ladyship escaped her hometown of Tyreelin, Ireland, fleeing her foster mother Whiskers (prodigious Guinness-guzzler, human chimney) and her mad household, to begin a new life in London.There, in blousey tops and satin miniskirts, she plies her trade, often risking life and limb amongst the flotsam and jetsam that fill the bars of Piccadilly Circus. But suave businessmen and lonely old women are not the only dangers that threaten Pussy.

973055,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000EHRVOM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[23, 29]","I had looked forward to seeing ""Breakfast on Pluto"" after missing its theatrical run.  Neil Jordan is a filmmaker that I admire.  Perhaps best known for ""The Crying Game"" and ""Interview With A Vampire,"" he also helmed one of my favorites--the overlooked ""Mona Lisa.""  I have, likewise, been intrigued by Cillian Murphy.  He's an interesting actor and I had hoped this would give him the opportunity to shine.  But much to my disappointment, I didn't connect with ""Breakfast on Pluto.""  While it had the potential to be a great film, Murphy's character (based on real life transvestite Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden) is so superficially drawn--it's hard to muster much interest in her self-involved lifestyle.Before I get any hate mail, yes--I understood the character and the film.  Kitten refuses to see reality for what it is and oftentimes exists solely in the fantasy of her mind.  The surreal quality of the film and the hyperdramatic Kitten are supposed to reflect a parallel universe to the classic love films that she wants the world to be like.  I think that's a perfectly acceptable narrative device.  But the movie touches on every subject from Catholicism, the IRA, terrorism, prostitution, prejudice, abortion--and yet manages not to involve us in any of it.  Why?  Because the world through Kitten's eyes doesn't allow it.  That's fine, too--if Kitten were someone I wanted to go on a journey with.  But, sadly, she's not.  It's not Murphy's fault--he's fine.  The screenplay doesn't let us see any texture to Kitten.  Many times as she is set up to be the victim of a scene, she has either been so rude, delusional, or downright idiotic--I just couldn't generate any sympathy for her.She has some childhood friends who we follow periodically, but they are so sketchily drawn--they barely register.  Kitten's main quest is to find the mother who has abandoned her.  But again--as her friends and country are being torn apart, her interests are always self-motivated.  There are bigger issues in the world that Kitten falling in love at first sight.  And boy, do the guys flock to her.  With her sing-songy voice and ridiculous love talk (on first meeting), I would have run from the madwoman.  But somehow, it's meant to be enchanting.  I know, some of you will contend--""But, she's a real person.""  OK, then I didn't like her in the film's portrayal.The film covers everything, but strangely nothing at all.  Maybe the problem was too much content--it needed to focus on a smaller scale and really develop the characters.  Even the significant moments of Kitten's life are seemingly glossed over.  Even though she walks the streets, gets picked up by strange men, works in a prostitution house--she never has sex.  It's all so vague, so surface.  With nothing to hold on to--I just let go.  At the center of ""Breakfast"" is an emotional void.  The film does have a fun and funky soundtrack which was my favorite thing in the movie.  But overall, I was left flat and uncaring about Kitten and her story.A big disappointment from a talented team--the fact that I didn't like ""Breakfast on Pluto"" couldn't have surprised me more.

973056,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EHRVOM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","Director Neil Jordan's 1996 film ""The Butcher Boy"" was based on a novel by Patrick McCabe, and he adapts a second work of the Irish author for the screen with ""Breakfast on Pluto.""  This is the tale of Patrick Braden (Cillian Murphy), who prefers to go by the name ""Kitten.""  As a wee babe Patrick was left on the doorstep of a presbytery in an Irish town, where he was taken in by the parish priest (Liam Neeson) and given over to the local pub owner to raise.  One day the young boy dresses up in his step-sister's clothes and that is it.  His step-mother threatens to parade him up and down the street to shame the boy, but not only is Patrick an transvestite, he is apparently an exhibitionist as well.Being a Nancy boy in Ireland is likely to get you killed, which is one reason for Patrick to head to London and complete his transformation into Kitten, but he has another reason.  What little he knows about his mum from the local gossips is that she is supposedly in London and looks a bit like Mitzi Gaynor (if you have no more clue about what Mitzi Gaynor looks like than two birds sitting on a window sill, do not worry: a film clip evidences the point).  So Kitten arrives in London all dressed up where no place to go, until he meets up with a stage magician named Bertie (Stephen Rea, who is not going to be fooled twice by a transvestite in a Neil Jordan film).""Breakfast on Pluto"" is told in three dozen chapters whose numbers and titles appear on screen (e.g., ""Lollipop Ladies,"" ""Deep Water""), as Kitten's quest to find his mother leads to other adventures and discoveries.  But even more important than what I assume are the chapter titles from McCabe's book are the 1960s and 1970s songs that provide musical counterpoints to the developments in the story.  There is something of a preference for the work of Harry Nielsen (always great to hear ""Me and My Arrow""), but there are bonus points for using the Lee Hazlewood song ""Sand"" as a duet for Murphy and Gavin Friday, who plays Billy Hatchet, the singer of a band that Kitten hooks up with early on in the film.  This is a soundtrack that makes everything from ""Windmills of Your Mind"" and ""Feeling"" to ""Children of the Revolution"" and ""Fly Robin Fly"" work, and makes sure characters get the lyrics right to ""How Much Is That Doggy In The Window.""There are a lot of movies in which an orphan goes off in search of a parent, and a lot of pitfalls as to what happens when the big moment comes.  I like the way ""Breakfast on Pluto"" plays this out and manages to preserve most of Kitten's aura of innocence, even when he is forced to become a street prostitute (compare what happens here with what we see with the same situation in ""Mysterious Skin"").  Kitten does not need much to be happy in this world, but then the odds are not favorable in that regard.  If you are looking for a comparable character in contemporary films to Kitten it is not the cowboys in ""Brokeback Mountain"" or the transsexual in ""Transamerica,"" but Angel from ""Rent.""  Kitten lacks the bravado and self-confidence of Angel, but they are kindred spirits, which is a pretty good recommendation in and of itself.",4,Even an Irish Nancy boy needs a real mum and dad,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,3153,"['Director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', '1996', 'film', 'Butcher', 'Boy', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'McCabe', 'second', 'work', 'Irish', 'author', 'screen', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'tale', 'Patrick', 'Braden', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'who', 'go', 'name', 'Kitten', 'wee', 'babe', 'Patrick', 'was', 'left', 'doorstep', 'presbytery', 'Irish', 'town', 'where', 'was', 'taken', 'parish', 'priest', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'given', 'local', 'pub', 'owner', 'raise', 'One', 'day', 'young', 'boy', 'up', 'step-sister', 'clothes', 'step-mother', 'threatens', 'parade', 'up', 'street', 'shame', 'boy', 'not', 'only', 'Patrick', 'transvestite', 'apparently', 'exhibitionist', 'well.Being', 'Nancy', 'boy', 'Ireland', 'likely', 'get', 'killed', 'one', 'reason', 'Patrick', 'head', 'London', 'complete', 'transformation', 'Kitten', 'reason', 'What', 'little', 'mum', 'local', 'gossips', 'supposedly', 'London', 'bit', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'have', 'more', 'clue', 'what', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'two', 'birds', 'sitting', 'window', 'sill', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'film', 'clip', 'point', 'So', 'Kitten', 'London', 'dressed', 'up', 'where', 'place', 'go', 'up', 'stage', 'magician', 'named', 'Bertie', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'fooled', 'twice', 'transvestite', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'film', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'told', 'three', 'dozen', 'chapters', 'numbers', 'titles', 'appear', 'screen', 'e.g.', 'Lollipop', 'Ladies', 'Deep', 'Water', 'Kitten', 'quest', 'find', 'mother', 'other', 'adventures', 'discoveries', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'assume', 'are', 'chapter', 'titles', 'McCabe', 'book', 'are', '1960s', '1970s', 'songs', 'provide', 'musical', 'counterpoints', 'developments', 'story', 'something', 'preference', 'work', 'Harry', 'Nielsen', 'always', 'great', 'hear', 'Me', 'My', 'Arrow', 'are', 'bonus', 'points', 'using', 'Lee', 'Hazlewood', 'song', 'Sand', 'duet', 'Murphy', 'Gavin', 'Friday', 'who', 'Billy', 'Hatchet', 'singer', 'band', 'Kitten', 'up', 'early', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'everything', 'Windmills', 'Your', 'Mind', 'Feeling', 'Children', 'Revolution', 'Fly', 'Robin', 'Fly', 'work', 'sure', 'characters', 'get', 'lyrics', 'right', 'How', 'Much', 'Doggy', 'Window', 'are', 'lot', 'movies', 'orphan', 'off', 'search', 'parent', 'lot', 'pitfalls', 'what', 'when', 'big', 'moment', 'way', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'out', 'manages', 'preserve', 'most', 'Kitten', 'aura', 'innocence', 'even', 'when', 'forced', 'become', 'street', 'prostitute', 'compare', 'what', 'here', 'what', 'see', 'same', 'situation', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'Kitten', 'not', 'need', 'much', 'be', 'happy', 'world', 'then', 'odds', 'are', 'not', 'favorable', 'regard', 'are', 'looking', 'comparable', 'character', 'contemporary', 'films', 'Kitten', 'not', 'cowboys', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'transsexual', 'Transamerica', 'Angel', 'Rent', 'Kitten', 'bravado', 'self-confidence', 'Angel', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'pretty', 'good', 'recommendation']",N/A

The casting was perfect and the acting extremely convincing; the plot flows well and I didn't get bored. The cinematography is wonderful and the choreography reflects great forethought; and the script was very well written.When the film starts we see a young baby boy left by his mother on the doorstep of a church so that the Father and the others there could raise him although of course things get much more complicated than that! As Patrick grows up in the home of his foster mother, Ma Braden (Ruth McCabe), trouble starts to get worse and worse when it becomes quite clear that Patrick will grow up to be anything but a jock. Even as a young boy Patrick (Conor McEvoy) loves to put on Ma Barden's shoes and dresses when she's not at home; Patrick eventually prefers to go by ""Kitten"" since he believes that there was a Catholic Saint by that name--and it lets him express himself as a woman who loves men as well. Inevitably, the almost fully grown Patrick (now played by Cillian Murphy) has had enough of Ma Braden and her daughter Caroline (Charlene McKenna)--and so Patrick leaves Ireland for London to find his long lost mother. He doesn't know much about her except for her first initial and her last name (E. Bergin); and he believes that she resembles Mitzi Gaynor!Once Patrick is on the road he finds himself traveling with a performing band. Billy Hatchett (Gavin Friday), one of the performers, starts a quasi-romantic relationship with Patrick although Billy also wants to use Patrick as someone to watch their hideout for stored guns--they're actually very involved in the IRA! Patrick goes through other remarkable experiences including being an assistant to Bertie (Stephen Rea), a magician; spending time alone with men for money in London, being beaten up by London police who wrongly believe that Patrick planted a bomb that exploded in a nightclub and much, much more. The film also provides us with a very poignant ending.As the film progressed I became absolutely enamored with Cillian Murphy's performance. Now there's an actor with guts to play a part so unlike himself in real life! Look also for excellent performances by Liam Neeson as Father Liam; Ruth Negga as Patrick's female friend Charlie; Laurence Kinlan as Irwin and Seamus Reilly as Lawrence.The DVD comes with an optional running commentary by director Neil Jordan and Cillian Murphy; and I especially liked the ""behind the scenes"" featurette.If you like artsy films, this one's for you. I came away feeling as if I had witnessed a grand voyage--an odyssey. The acting is brilliant and you won't forget this anytime soon.

Pitts,"[2, 3]","Set in the United Kingdom during the tumultuous 1960s and `70s, BREAKFAST ON PLUTO tells the story of Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden (an electrifying Cillian Murphy), an orphan from a small Irish town who dreams of escaping his drab surroundings. Though his orphan status is enough to make him an outsider, Patrick's gleeful decision to become the cross-dressing Androgynous Kitten sends him into the outside world for good. He ends up at the trailer home of traveling musician Billy Rock (Gavin Friday), who is hiding weapons used by the IRA in a series of vicious attacks.After an unexpected tragedy, Kitten says farewell to Ireland and heads for the glamorous, rough-and-tumble streets of London, where she faces hatred and hardship in equal measure. Through it all, Kitten somehow retains her unwavering spirit, teaching a valuable lesson about staying hopeful and optimistic in the face of harsh degradation.Murphy's portrayal of the fiercely flamboyant Kitten is a sight to behold. Beautiful as a man, Murphy's appearance takes on an even more ethereal glow as a woman.

Seeing him sashaying down the street in his make up and vintage finery made me think of the kinder, gentler drag queens like Tootsie or those in The Birdcage with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane rather than the harsher, campier ones as featured in a John Waters film.  It set the tone for this rather odd movie, and left me thinking there was just as much learned as their was to be confused.Our Kitten comes into the word as an orphan boy left on the backsteps of a church in a small Irish town.  Here he is found by the local parish priest and adopted into a family.  It's clear from the beginning that he is not like other boys, and his small town, stanch Irish Catholic family doesn't know what to do with him.  Eventually, Kitten leaves his hometown for London, in a quest for both freedom as well as to somehow find his birth mother.  What unfolds is a really, really, odd chain of events.  He joins a band, is mistakenly arrested as being a member of the IRA, clashes with a variety of people, and looks into the sleazy side of life.I saw this movie as more of a train of thought rather than a substantial story.  It was some fun, some horror, some smut, and some ugliness.  In short, that's what life is really all about.  And it has a happy ending, where Kitten finds a family.

973061,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,B000EHRVOM,Pristine,"[1, 1]","Transvestite adventures of filmmaker Neil Jordan continues from the Crying Game.  Now, the displaced soul embodies itself in Cillian Murphy (who I must admit, looked more adorable and vulnerable in 28 days later).  An orphaned boy who discovers the nancy life leaves his little Irish village and get swallowed up in 70s London in search of his real mother.  Along the way he meets with druid pot-smoking bikers thoerizing about time space continuum travel, then Native Indian posing rockers, IRA sympathizers, Bryan Ferry, a magician (played expertly by Crying Game's Stephen Rea, apparently a Jordan alumni forever in dating hell going from one transvestite relationship to another), before starting to look for his mum again.Both Stephen Rea and Liam Neeson (as the village priest) steals the show in wonderfully quiet character studies.  For me, Cillian Murphy's Kitten comes alive only after the curly hair disappears under the wig.  This actor has marvelous angular features with high cheekbones, which gets wasted on that curly hairdo.  70s music play in almost continuously throughout the movie to give ambience for the era.  I found this mildly distracting in the same way the movie Outside Providence felt as if I was standing in front of a jukebox.Keep an eye out for the expertly-crafted ""confession booth"" scene, which displays Jordan's virtuosity as a storyteller.  This scene, where the tables get turned, is worth the admission of the movie alone.  I think the Crying Game was a blueprint of what Jordan was attempting to say, and Breakfast on Pluto is the master copy.  The ruined cathedral sequence is beautifully filmed, sublime in its message that true faith will surive the worst of humanity.  The Telecom lady visit is also acted with delicate understatement.At first, I had trouble with the way Rea's character disappears suddenly from the story.  However, given the nature of his character's profession (magician), Jordan's narrative sleight-of-hand makes complete sense here.This movie is not really about transgendered lives, it uses the concept of duality as an allegory for that other Irish ""problem.""",4,An expertly crafted allegory about displacement,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2128,"['Transvestite', 'adventures', 'filmmaker', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Now', 'displaced', 'soul', 'embodies', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'who', 'must', 'admit', 'looked', 'more', 'adorable', 'vulnerable', '28', 'days', 'later', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'who', 'nancy', 'life', 'little', 'Irish', 'village', 'get', 'swallowed', 'up', '70s', 'London', 'search', 'real', 'mother', 'way', 'druid', 'pot-smoking', 'bikers', 'thoerizing', 'time', 'space', 'continuum', 'travel', 'then', 'Native', 'Indian', 'posing', 'rockers', 'IRA', 'sympathizers', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'magician', 'played', 'expertly', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'apparently', 'Jordan', 'alumni', 'forever', 'dating', 'hell', 'going', 'one', 'transvestite', 'relationship', 'starting', 'look', 'mum', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'village', 'priest', 'show', 'wonderfully', 'quiet', 'character', 'studies', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Kitten', 'alive', 'only', 'curly', 'hair', 'disappears', 'wig', 'actor', 'marvelous', 'angular', 'features', 'high', 'cheekbones', 'wasted', 'curly', 'hairdo', '70s', 'music', 'play', 'almost', 'continuously', 'movie', 'give', 'ambience', 'era', 'found', 'mildly', 'distracting', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'Outside', 'Providence', 'felt', 'was', 'standing', 'front', 'jukebox.Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'expertly-crafted', 'confession', 'booth', 'scene', 'Jordan', 'virtuosity', 'storyteller', 'scene', 'where', 'tables', 'get', 'turned', 'admission', 'movie', 'alone', 'think', 'Crying', 'Game', 'was', 'blueprint', 'what', 'Jordan', 'was', 'attempting', 'say', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'master', 'copy', 'ruined', 'cathedral', 'sequence', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'sublime', 'message', 'true', 'faith', 'will', 'surive', 'worst', 'humanity', 'Telecom', 'lady', 'visit', 'also', 'acted', 'delicate', 'understatement.At', 'first', 'had', 'trouble', 'way', 'Rea', 'character', 'suddenly', 'story', 'However', 'given', 'nature', 'character', 'profession', 'magician', 'Jordan', 'narrative', 'sleight-of-hand', 'complete', 'sense', 'here.This', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'transgendered', 'lives', 'concept', 'duality', 'allegory', 'other', 'Irish', 'problem']",N/A
973062,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000EHRVOM,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2Based on the novel by Pat McCabe, ""Breakfast on Pluto"" takes us on a loopy journey through the turbulent years of the late 1960's and early 1970`s.  Our guide for the occasion is one Patrick ""Kitten"" Jordan, a hopelessly romantic transvestite who finds himself looking for love in all the wrong places.The story begins in 1956 Ireland, when Patrick, as an infant, is left on the doorstep of a local priest who may just possibly be the father of the child.  As Patrick grows up in the care of a bitter foster mother, he comes to learn that his real mother was a beautiful young woman - a dead ringer, he's told, for Mitzi Gaynor - who worked as a housekeeper for the priest, then disappeared in London not long after Patrick was born.  With his effeminate mannerisms and penchant for wearing women's clothing, Patrick does not exactly fit into the highly conformist world of Irish Catholic society, and, as a result, he suffers much abuse at the hands of his less-than-understanding parochial school teachers who have no idea what to make of him.  But Patrick has unlocked the secret to survival.  He simply gives back as good as he gets, using sardonic humor and an air of indifference to protect himself from the ugliness and harshness of the society around him.  Even if he is only laughing to cover up the hurt, at least it beats crying his eyes out at every bump in the road life throws his way.Eventually, Patrick becomes old enough to leave home and make his own way in the world.  The film relates his brief involvements with a rock-n-roll band, some IRA gun runners, and an exploitative magician, as well as his eventual journey to London to find the mother who abandoned him.  While there, he has a brief stint as a streetwalker and is even arrested as the prime suspect in a dancehall firebombing.  But all of these travails are just brief downpours in Patrick's life experience, and while they may dampen his mood at times, they can't extinguish his spirit.Writer/director Neil Jordan has turned McCabe's novel into a fast paced (if overlong) film filled with warmth, humor and a sort of cockeyed optimism that helps to counterbalance some of the grim social issues (prejudice, child abandonment, terrorism) that lie along the story's periphery.  The film occasionally feels aimless and episodic and some of Patrick's experiences are more compelling than others.  Most of the subsidiary characters are left sketchy and underdeveloped, but that really doesn't matter all that much because Patrick has enough personality for the lot of them.  And Cillian Murphy makes what could easily have been just another mincing gay stereotype into a multi-dimensional character of substance and depth.  Most of the other actors (Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea et. al.) aren't given enough screen time to make much of an impression, though Neeson nicely underplays the role of Patrick`s priest and father.Patrick knows that, when the going gets tough, we all need to journey to that special place of imagination and beauty where we can find security and comfort.  For Patrick, as the title suggests, that place is Pluto.  However, now that that particular celestial object has lost its planetary status, I wonder if Patrick will still be traveling there to partake in the most important meal of the day.",3,episodic but engrossing film,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3300,"['***1/2Based', 'novel', 'Pat', 'McCabe', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'loopy', 'journey', 'turbulent', 'years', 'late', '1960', 'early', '1970', 's', 'guide', 'occasion', 'one', 'Patrick', 'Kitten', 'Jordan', 'hopelessly', 'romantic', 'transvestite', 'who', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places.The', 'story', '1956', 'Ireland', 'when', 'Patrick', 'infant', 'left', 'doorstep', 'local', 'priest', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'possibly', 'be', 'father', 'child', 'Patrick', 'up', 'care', 'bitter', 'foster', 'mother', 'learn', 'real', 'mother', 'was', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'dead', 'ringer', 'told', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'who', 'worked', 'housekeeper', 'priest', 'then', 'disappeared', 'London', 'not', 'long', 'Patrick', 'was', 'born', 'effeminate', 'mannerisms', 'penchant', 'wearing', 'women', 'clothing', 'Patrick', 'not', 'exactly', 'fit', 'highly', 'conformist', 'world', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'society', 'result', 'much', 'abuse', 'hands', 'less-than-understanding', 'parochial', 'school', 'teachers', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'make', 'Patrick', 'unlocked', 'secret', 'survival', 'simply', 'back', 'as', 'good', 'using', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'air', 'indifference', 'protect', 'ugliness', 'harshness', 'society', 'Even', 'only', 'laughing', 'cover', 'up', 'hurt', 'least', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'bump', 'road', 'life', 'way.Eventually', 'Patrick', 'old', 'enough', 'leave', 'home', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'world', 'film', 'brief', 'involvements', 'rock-n-roll', 'band', 'IRA', 'gun', 'runners', 'exploitative', 'magician', 'as', 'well', 'eventual', 'journey', 'London', 'find', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'there', 'brief', 'stint', 'streetwalker', 'even', 'arrested', 'prime', 'suspect', 'dancehall', 'firebombing', 'travails', 'are', 'just', 'brief', 'downpours', 'Patrick', 'life', 'experience', 'may', 'dampen', 'mood', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'extinguish', 'spirit.Writer/director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'turned', 'McCabe', 'novel', 'fast', 'paced', 'overlong', 'film', 'filled', 'warmth', 'humor', 'sort', 'cockeyed', 'optimism', 'counterbalance', 'grim', 'social', 'issues', 'prejudice', 'child', 'abandonment', 'terrorism', 'story', 'periphery', 'film', 'occasionally', 'feels', 'aimless', 'episodic', 'Patrick', 'experiences', 'are', 'more', 'compelling', 'others', 'Most', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'sketchy', 'underdeveloped', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'that', 'much', 'Patrick', 'enough', 'personality', 'lot', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'mincing', 'gay', 'stereotype', 'multi-dimensional', 'character', 'substance', 'depth', 'Most', 'other', 'actors', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'et', 'al', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'Neeson', 'nicely', 'role', 'Patrick', 's', 'priest', 'father.Patrick', 'knows', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'need', 'journey', 'special', 'place', 'imagination', 'beauty', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'security', 'comfort', 'Patrick', 'title', 'place', 'Pluto', 'However', 'now', 'particular', 'celestial', 'object', 'lost', 'planetary', 'status', 'wonder', 'Patrick', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'traveling', 'there', 'partake', 'most', 'important', 'meal', 'day']",N/A
973063,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000EHRVOM,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 3]","""Breakfast on Pluto,"" (2004),another triumph from Irish director Neil Jordan, was made with support from both the Irish, and Northern Irish film boards.  It has a light, jokey style, plenty of wit, and a sound track that refracts ironically from the action. And then there are those robins, slurping up the cream from the milk bottles, commenting on the human action around them, and quoting --gay--Anglo-Irish humorist/playwright Oscar Wilde.  But at its heart,this film couldn't be more serious.The movie was based on a best-selling, raucous novel by Patrick Mc Cabe; Mc Cabe and Jordan wrote the film script.  It was filmed on location, in the lovely countryside of Co. Kilkenny, and London.  It's set during the swinging late 1960's/ early 70s of that city, a period that, in addition to nifty clothes and cars, also, unfortunately, saw a lot of Irish Republican Army terrorist activity.The gorgeous Cillian Murphy stars -- if you think he's cute as a boy, you ought to see him as a girl.  He gives a remarkable performance as Patrick Braden, who prefers to be known as Kitten, and has a way with a sewing machine.  He really deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this job, but had to settle for a Golden Globe nomination.  Patrick is a foundling, left in a basket on the doorstep of the local church, where Liam Neeson plays the Father Liam, the priest who finds him and quite likely fathered him.  Or so the village, and the robins think,  on his lovely young one-time housekeeper, said to resemble the American actress Mitzi Gaynor.  Braden's stepmother, Mrs. Braden, is played by Ruth Mc Cabe, who has pretty much grown up on camera.  Author of the book, Patrick Mc Cabe, plays one of the boy Patrick's less than-happy-with-the-boy school teachers:  for it seems that nobody can keep young Patrick out of girl's clothes and makeup.Well, eventually young Patrick must leave the charming village of his birth, of course, and start making his way to London, to which his mother is supposed to have fled.  On his way, he tarries briefly with popular Irish entertainer Gavin Friday, playing Billy Hatchett,a gay local rock star.  In London, he'll run across real rock star Bryan Ferry, playing Mr. Silky String,a serial killer; Brendan Gleeson as John Joe Kenny, an entertainment park performer; the very talented Ian Hart as a P.C. Wallis, and the Irish actor Stephen Rea as Bertie,a mediocre magician who gets attached to Patrick(Kitten) Brady.  Kitten Brady will have many adventures in London, some good, some heart-breaking; he will face them all with sweet-tempered equanimity, eventually find his birth mother, and realize she has created a life for herself in which there's no room for him.Jordan, as is well-known, has frequently worked with Neeson, Gleeson, and Rea, and that shows in the fine performances these stalwarts give him.  It's a funny thing, a very bold Cockney friend of mine once found herself standing next to Neeson in the then-famed New York bar, Denim and Diamonds: all she knew was she was standing next to a tall, well-built, good-looking man in a beautiful, beautifully fitted suit.  Well, she was watching some young lovers across the bar room, and, inevitably, she began elbowing this guy standing next to her, chatting away about this couple.  So they had a friendly chat -- mind you, she had nothing in particular in mind: this friend of mine certainly was a cougar before they'd even invented the concept, an ex- of hers used to call her the Disco Granny, but she knew she was quite a few years older than this man.  She just wanted to talk.  It was only after Neeson left that the bartender told her who she'd been elbowing.  She'd just thought he was a nice, good-looking man in a gorgeous suit.  And so he was.It has been said that the director's pictures are generally about men who find themselves in love with inappropriate love objects, and you'd have to say ""Breakfast"" fits that mode:  Neeson gives us a priest who really appears to have loved his housekeeper, rather than just lusted after her.  But no matter: in an Irish village of the 1960's-70's they can have no permanent relationship.  Happily for him, however, he comes to realize that, while  it may not be popularly approved, he can manage a relationship with his son.",4,"Light as a Feather, Serious at Heart",1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,4280,"['Breakfast', 'Pluto', '2004', 'triumph', 'Irish', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'was', 'made', 'support', 'Irish', 'Northern', 'Irish', 'film', 'boards', 'light', 'jokey', 'style', 'plenty', 'wit', 'sound', 'track', 'ironically', 'action', 'then', 'are', 'robins', 'slurping', 'up', 'cream', 'milk', 'bottles', 'commenting', 'human', 'action', 'quoting', 'gay', 'Anglo-Irish', 'humorist/playwright', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'heart', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'serious.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'best-selling', 'raucous', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'Mc', 'Cabe', 'Mc', 'Cabe', 'Jordan', 'wrote', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'lovely', 'countryside', 'Co.', 'Kilkenny', 'London', 'set', 'swinging', 'late', ""1960's/"", 'early', '70s', 'city', 'period', 'addition', 'nifty', 'clothes', 'cars', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'saw', 'lot', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'terrorist', 'activity.The', 'gorgeous', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'stars', 'think', 'cute', 'boy', 'ought', 'see', 'girl', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Patrick', 'Braden', 'who', 'be', 'known', 'Kitten', 'way', 'sewing', 'machine', 'really', 'deserved', 'least', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'job', 'had', 'settle', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'Patrick', 'foundling', 'left', 'basket', 'doorstep', 'local', 'church', 'where', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Father', 'Liam', 'priest', 'who', 'quite', 'likely', 'fathered', 'so', 'village', 'robins', 'think', 'lovely', 'young', 'one-time', 'housekeeper', 'said', 'resemble', 'American', 'actress', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'Braden', 'stepmother', 'Mrs.', 'Braden', 'played', 'Ruth', 'Mc', 'Cabe', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'grown', 'up', 'camera', 'Author', 'book', 'Patrick', 'Mc', 'Cabe', 'one', 'boy', 'Patrick', 'less', 'than-happy-with-the-boy', 'school', 'teachers', 'nobody', 'can', 'keep', 'young', 'Patrick', 'girl', 'clothes', 'makeup.Well', 'eventually', 'young', 'Patrick', 'must', 'leave', 'charming', 'village', 'birth', 'course', 'start', 'making', 'way', 'London', 'mother', 'supposed', 'have', 'fled', 'way', 'briefly', 'popular', 'Irish', 'entertainer', 'Gavin', 'Friday', 'playing', 'Billy', 'Hatchett', 'gay', 'local', 'rock', 'star', 'London', ""'ll"", 'run', 'real', 'rock', 'star', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Silky', 'String', 'serial', 'killer', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'John', 'Joe', 'Kenny', 'entertainment', 'park', 'performer', 'very', 'talented', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'P.C', 'Wallis', 'Irish', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Bertie', 'mediocre', 'magician', 'who', 'attached', 'Patrick', 'Kitten', 'Brady', 'Kitten', 'Brady', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'adventures', 'London', 'good', 'heart-breaking', 'will', 'face', 'sweet-tempered', 'equanimity', 'eventually', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'realize', 'created', 'life', 'herself', 'room', 'him.Jordan', 'well-known', 'frequently', 'worked', 'Neeson', 'Gleeson', 'Rea', 'fine', 'performances', 'stalwarts', 'give', 'funny', 'thing', 'very', 'bold', 'Cockney', 'friend', 'mine', 'once', 'found', 'standing', 'next', 'Neeson', 'then-famed', 'New', 'York', 'bar', 'Denim', 'Diamonds', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'standing', 'next', 'tall', 'well-built', 'good-looking', 'man', 'beautiful', 'beautifully', 'fitted', 'suit', 'Well', 'was', 'watching', 'young', 'lovers', 'bar', 'room', 'inevitably', 'began', 'elbowing', 'guy', 'standing', 'next', 'chatting', 'away', 'couple', 'had', 'friendly', 'chat', 'mind', 'had', 'nothing', 'particular', 'mind', 'friend', 'mine', 'certainly', 'was', 'cougar', ""'d"", 'even', 'invented', 'concept', 'ex-', 'hers', 'used', 'call', 'Disco', 'Granny', 'knew', 'was', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'man', 'just', 'wanted', 'talk', 'was', 'only', 'Neeson', 'left', 'bartender', 'told', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'elbowing', ""'d"", 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'good-looking', 'man', 'gorgeous', 'suit', 'so', 'been', 'said', 'director', 'pictures', 'are', 'generally', 'men', 'who', 'find', 'love', 'inappropriate', 'love', 'objects', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Breakfast', 'mode', 'Neeson', 'priest', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'loved', 'housekeeper', 'rather', 'just', 'lusted', 'matter', 'Irish', 'village', ""1960's-70"", 'can', 'have', 'permanent', 'relationship', 'Happily', 'however', 'realize', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'popularly', 'approved', 'can', 'manage', 'relationship', 'son']",N/A

Working from another Patrick McCabe novel, this is no Butcher Boy. Following another maladjusted foundling at odds with the vigorous conformity of small-town life, this episodic cross dressing chronicle of Patricia Kitten Braden and ""her"" search for ""her"" mother and love in the Ireland and England of the 70s against a background of flared trousers, platform heels and IRA bombings is a much more optimistic tale. Relying on the kindness of strangers, Kitten's good nature even makes an unlikely guardian angel out of the cop who beats him up after a pub bombing in which s/he becomes the prime suspect. Yet despite the very different perspective, at times it almost feels like it's running through a checklist. Priests seducing their housekeepers? Check. Schoolboy priest baiting? Check. Mocking the paramilitaries until things get serious, serious, serious? Check. ""I'm not a girl""? (One for the Jordan fans there) Check. Surreal flights of comic fancy to offset the tragedy and darkness? Check. Even the supporting cast feels like Jordan trotting out the repertory company of old favorites - along with Liam Neeson there's also the inevitable Stephen Rea, Ian Hart and Brendan Gleeson in a Womble suit. There's something just a little bit tired about it all.It's a film that needs a strong, charismatic central performance to pull it all together, and Cillian Murphy's Kitten just doesn't quite work. He looks uncannily right for the part, with the kind of pansexual look you'd find in glam rock stars like Marc Bolan from the era if they'd gone that extra mile, but the voice is a real problem: aside from being so soft spoken that it's a good job the DVD comes subtitled to pick up what he's saying, it never convinces that there's a real person under the affectations and seems to leaves the wardrobe and makeup to do more of the work, resulting in a rather superficial performance. You observe the character but you don't care about her. Liam Neeson doesn't fare too well either, with only the latter scenes playing to his strengths as an actor and too many of his early ones emphasising his weaknesses. In many ways the film's real standout performances come from Gavin Friday's gay singer Billy Hatchett who Kitten charms right out of the closet and Ruth Negga as one of Kitten's loyal childhood friends.As Breakfast On Pluto it ambles along in its overlong, unfocused way, it's hard to dislike - after all, how can you hate a film that uses a pair of gossipy robins as a Greek chorus? - but it's definitely a film that diminishes in the memory shortly after seeing it.",3,"Overlong, unfocused and underachieving, yet somehow hard to dislike",1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,2698,"['highly', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'be', 'counted', 'sporadic', 'failures', 'Working', 'Patrick', 'McCabe', 'novel', 'Butcher', 'Boy', 'Following', 'maladjusted', 'foundling', 'odds', 'vigorous', 'conformity', 'small-town', 'life', 'episodic', 'cross', 'dressing', 'chronicle', 'Patricia', 'Kitten', 'Braden', 'search', 'mother', 'love', 'Ireland', 'England', '70s', 'background', 'flared', 'trousers', 'platform', 'heels', 'IRA', 'bombings', 'much', 'more', 'optimistic', 'tale', 'Relying', 'kindness', 'strangers', 'Kitten', 'good', 'nature', 'even', 'unlikely', 'guardian', 'angel', 'cop', 'who', 'up', 'pub', 'bombing', 's/he', 'prime', 'suspect', 'very', 'different', 'perspective', 'times', 'almost', 'running', 'checklist', 'Priests', 'seducing', 'housekeepers', 'Check', 'Schoolboy', 'baiting', 'Check', 'Mocking', 'paramilitaries', 'things', 'get', 'serious', 'serious', 'serious', 'Check', ""'m"", 'not', 'girl', 'One', 'Jordan', 'fans', 'there', 'Check', 'Surreal', 'flights', 'comic', 'fancy', 'offset', 'tragedy', 'darkness', 'Check', 'Even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'feels', 'Jordan', 'trotting', 'out', 'repertory', 'company', 'old', 'favorites', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'also', 'inevitable', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Womble', 'suit', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'tired', 'all.It', 'film', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'central', 'performance', 'pull', 'together', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Kitten', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'uncannily', 'right', 'part', 'kind', 'pansexual', 'look', ""'d"", 'find', 'glam', 'rock', 'stars', 'Marc', 'Bolan', 'era', ""'d"", 'gone', 'extra', 'mile', 'voice', 'real', 'problem', 'aside', 'being', 'so', 'soft', 'spoken', 'good', 'job', 'DVD', 'subtitled', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'saying', 'never', 'real', 'person', 'affectations', 'leaves', 'wardrobe', 'makeup', 'do', 'more', 'work', 'resulting', 'rather', 'superficial', 'performance', 'observe', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Liam', 'Neeson', ""n't"", 'fare', 'too', 'well', 'either', 'only', 'latter', 'scenes', 'playing', 'strengths', 'actor', 'too', 'many', 'early', 'ones', 'emphasising', 'weaknesses', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'real', 'standout', 'performances', 'come', 'Gavin', 'Friday', 'gay', 'singer', 'Billy', 'Hatchett', 'who', 'Kitten', 'charms', 'right', 'closet', 'Ruth', 'Negga', 'one', 'Kitten', 'loyal', 'childhood', 'friends.As', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'along', 'overlong', 'unfocused', 'way', 'hard', 'dislike', 'how', 'can', 'hate', 'film', 'pair', 'gossipy', 'robins', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'definitely', 'film', 'memory', 'shortly', 'seeing']",N/A
973069,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000EHRVOM,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Using 36 short chapters, `Breakfast on Pluto' follows the life of Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden (Cillian Murphy) like journal, or Charles Dickens novel. Patrick is an orphan in a small Irish town, leaves the strife-torn country (the film is set in the glittering 70s) and goes to London in order to find his 'real' mother. And he meets a lot of strange but interesting characters on the way. The difference is, unlike Pip, Patrick, or Kitten, is a transvestite.As the story unfolds, you will sense that this Neil Jordan film is based on a book. The book is written by Patrick McCabe whose book `The Butcher Boy' was also filmed by Jordan in 1997.To some viewers who expect character development in Kitten, `Breakfast on Pluto' would be a disappointing experience. And if you're looking for something very `campy,' you may also be disappointed. Kitten is at times more like an observer of a series of the incidents - some bizarre, some sad, some happy, including his own fantasy world. Consequently the characters surrounding Kitten are sometimes more interesting than he.I know Cillian Murphy is a talented actor (and he was nominated for Golden Globe for this role), but in this film the supporting actors like Liam Neeson, Ian Hart, Brendan Gleeson and Stephan Rea are more impressive in spite of the brief time given to them. To be frank, the characters of Kitten, who heartily dislikes the word `serious,' may look monotonous compared with them, partly because he acts as if he never takes everything seriously including himself (even when so many people are dead). So why should we take him seriously?[CHANGES] Maybe this is not the biggest problem for you, but even if you have not read the book on which the film based, you will realize that changes are made. As one of the previous reviewers rightly said, Neil Jordan changed the content of the book considerably. I won't write about it, but Jordan, who gave us an edgy 'thriller Crying Game,' is obviously trying to give a lighter and happier tone to the original material, which includes some disturbing elements.Not that the film lacks its original merit, though. Liam Neeson gives another touching performance as Father Bernard (with the nod to 'Paris, Texas'), but maybe the film should have explored his guilt-ridden character more. The pop soundtrack is fun, and speaking of music, there are cameos from musicians: one from Gavin Friday (as the singer of traveling band) and the other from Bryan Ferry as ""Mr. Silky String."" But you may seriously ask `Do we really need these episodes?'In spite of occasional fun and insight, `Breakfast on Pluto' suffers from its sprawling storyline that attempts to include as many things as possible. Delete the episode about the stage magician/hypnotist, one extended cameo from Neil Jordan's regular Stephen Rea, and amusing as the episode is, the film remains almost the same without it. In this way you might want to skip several chapters to reach the conclusion, knowing that those skipped chapters may contain some good things. The ending is worth your waiting, but probably the film could have delivered it much faster, with the much shorter time than 135 minutes, I am afraid.",3,Well-acted (Especially by Liam Neeson) But Too Episodic And Lacks a Strong Story,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,3179,"['Using', '36', 'short', 'chapters', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'life', 'Patrick', 'Kitten', 'Braden', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'journal', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'orphan', 'small', 'Irish', 'town', 'strife-torn', 'country', 'film', 'set', 'glittering', '70s', 'London', 'order', 'find', ""'real"", 'mother', 'lot', 'strange', 'interesting', 'characters', 'way', 'difference', 'Pip', 'Patrick', 'Kitten', 'transvestite.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'will', 'sense', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'book', 'written', 'Patrick', 'McCabe', 'book', 'Butcher', 'Boy', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'Jordan', '1997.To', 'viewers', 'who', 'expect', 'character', 'development', 'Kitten', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'would', 'be', 'disappointing', 'experience', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'very', 'campy', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Kitten', 'times', 'more', 'observer', 'series', 'incidents', 'bizarre', 'sad', 'happy', 'including', 'own', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Consequently', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'Kitten', 'are', 'sometimes', 'more', 'interesting', 'he.I', 'know', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'talented', 'actor', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'role', 'film', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Stephan', 'Rea', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'spite', 'brief', 'time', 'given', 'be', 'frank', 'characters', 'Kitten', 'who', 'heartily', 'word', 'serious', 'may', 'look', 'monotonous', 'compared', 'partly', 'never', 'everything', 'seriously', 'including', 'even', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'dead', 'why', 'should', 'take', 'seriously', '[', 'CHANGES', ']', 'Maybe', 'not', 'biggest', 'problem', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'will', 'realize', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'one', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'rightly', 'said', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'changed', 'content', 'book', 'considerably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'Jordan', 'who', 'gave', 'edgy', ""'thriller"", 'Crying', 'Game', 'obviously', 'trying', 'give', 'lighter', 'happier', 'tone', 'original', 'material', 'disturbing', 'elements.Not', 'film', 'original', 'merit', 'though', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'touching', 'performance', 'Father', 'Bernard', 'nod', ""'Paris"", 'Texas', 'maybe', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'explored', 'guilt-ridden', 'character', 'more', 'pop', 'soundtrack', 'fun', 'speaking', 'music', 'are', 'cameos', 'musicians', 'one', 'Gavin', 'Friday', 'singer', 'traveling', 'band', 'other', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'Mr.', 'Silky', 'String', 'may', 'seriously', 'ask', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'episodes', 'spite', 'occasional', 'fun', 'insight', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'suffers', 'sprawling', 'storyline', 'include', 'many', 'things', 'possible', 'Delete', 'episode', 'stage', 'magician/hypnotist', 'one', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'regular', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'amusing', 'episode', 'film', 'almost', 'same', 'way', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'several', 'chapters', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'knowing', 'skipped', 'chapters', 'may', 'contain', 'good', 'things', 'ending', 'waiting', 'probably', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'much', 'faster', 'much', 'shorter', 'time', '135', 'minutes', 'am', 'afraid']",N/A

Yes, this is one of three known movies that is an adaptation of a book and is actually better!I already knew that Cillian Murphy is a good actor, but he pretty much blew my socks off in this movie.  I think the movie is fantastic in its own right but it is definitely Murphy's performance that seals the deal and makes it so believable and heart-wrenching!  He plays the naive, innocent, yet not-stupid Patrick ""Kitten"" so well, I am saddened but not surprised he did not get an Academy Award nomination.In a nutshell, Breakfast is about a young man who is different than most of his peers and he has known such since he was a young boy.  His mother abandoned him when he was born and he feels like something is missing, like he is not complete without her or at least knowing what happened, where she went, why she left.  He goes off in search of her but finds something else instead and it turns out that that is probably what he needed.  I think this movie is well-paced and ended in a perfect way.  This would be in the ""miscellaneous"" section of my video store if I owned one.  It is funny at times but not really a comedy, it is sad but not quite a drama.  All I know is that it leaves me feeling sort of inspired, happy and even hopeful.To say Breakfast is well-acted would be a gross understatement, it has wonderful cinematography and it has a great soundtrack as well.
