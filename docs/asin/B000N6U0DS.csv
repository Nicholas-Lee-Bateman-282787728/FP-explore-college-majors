That's what they say, and, unless you're as determined as Chris Gardner (Will Smith), you don't have a chance.  Unfortunately, money does buy some happiness.  As Chris looks about the wealthy, he observes, ""They looked so d---ed happy to me.  Why couldn't I look like that?""  His lot is to sell portable magnetic resonance imaging machines to doctors.  His prospects can be inferred by his description of them as ""expensive...and only slightly better at creating images"" than the ones they already had.  His wife, Linda (Chandie Newton) picks up the slack.  They have a beautiful, intelligent, inquisitive son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), whom they juggle from daycare to parent care, like many struggling wage earners.  She bears the burden as the chief wage earner, taking double shifts at the laundry, which can hardly be lucrative.  Her patience with him and the paper chase runs her ragged.  The IRS, the landlord, and the utilities all have a constant claim to their near future.  In the meantime, Chris gets an offer for the American Dream, a chance to be an intern at Dean Whitter, where, once accepted, bares a twenty-to-one chance of being hired after six months of grueling stock huckstering and hitting the books.  Like most people he wants a better life for himself and his family.  Remembering his own lot in life, he vows, ""My children were gonna know who their father is.""  Indeed some of the father and son scenes show real love, even by a father who is frayed by the pressures to succeed.  Taking place in the eighties, Chris will try the impossible, aligning his fortunes like the Rubik's cube he sets out to master...`The Pursuit of Happyness' pays dirt.  Every development along the way is absorbing from the first frame.  Always a stickler to detail, the beautiful background music and the well-chosen soundtrack are marvelous without ever making the film sentimental.  It's one step forward and two steps back.  This is true for Chris and the rest of us. Only the way it is revealed by Chris is truly a piece of work.  Chris tells his son, ""Don't ever let anyone tell you, you can't do something...If you have a dream, you have to protect it...You want something, go get it.""  Inspiring for all of us, this film may sound off themes from `Death of a Salesman,' but the results and details are often desperate, but offer us all hope.  (Blog, if you believe feel-good movies are not all acts of plagiarism.)

1054142,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000N6U0DS,Alistair McHarg,"[9, 14]","I'm told that soprano sax hack Kenny G once played a sustained, uninterrupted note for an entire hour.  (There is no data available regarding how many audience members took their own lives in response.)  In The Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith tops this dubious distinction by playing the same note for 2 hours straight, no variation in pitch, tempo, color, texture - unadulterated schmaltz.  Smith is box office gold because he's just so darn wholesome and non-threatening, which is precisely why he had no prayer of pulling this off.  Had it been played for real, this would have been a dark and chilling movie, ultimately an inspiring one, but it's far too well-scrubbed for that.Smith plays Chris Gardner, and Gardner's overriding passion is to be a good father.  He and real life son Jaden Smith traipse through the film like a couple of hobos; one expects to see them holding cigar butts with toothpicks and playing harmonicas.  Mom, played by the exotically beautiful Thandie Newton, abandons Chris, son, and the pleasures of San Francisco to work as a waitress in New York.  (Presumably there were no more waitress positions available in San Fran.)  Why she breaks that strongest of all bonds - mother and child - is never explained, she's a straw character exiting early.  This leaves us with only dad and son, and dad's big dream - which is to be a stockbroker.  The mystery of why anyone in his right mind would want to be a stockbroker is explained early on when Chris sees one parking a Ferrari - say no more!  Obviously a car like that is happiness - I mean happyness.Of course, you and I know better.  We know that the end of Chris's rainbow is not a pot of money; much less the maniacal streetwalking stockbrokers engage in to make that kind of money.  It is, of course, the relationship he has with his son - which he has had all along.  Unfortunately the director doesn't seem to know this, because all action drives from impoverishment to ultimate acceptance in the temple of lucre.  What makes this worse is that there seems to be no chemistry at all between Smith and his actual son.  Any chance the film had of touching a nerve depended entirely on a convincing performance by young Smith.  He is every bit as likeable as dear old dad, a real chip off the old blockhead, but there's no spark there at all.As the film reminds us, Jefferson spoke of the pursuit of happiness, i.e. one must seek it.

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[3, 4]","I do not normally review DVD's but 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' got my attention.This is of course the true story of Chris Gardner,an entrepeneuring San Franciscan played by Will Smith who peddles heavy Bone Density machines to support his girlfriend and young son (played by Will's own son Jaden).One thing leads to another,his girlfriend leaves Chris,one things leads to another and Chris and his little boy end up living in a church mission for a time;it's a bones to rags to riches story in and of itself.But many things impressed me about it.Will Smith really threw himself believably into his character and little Jaden is actually a pretty fine actor;very very believable.And if this is autobiographically correct I think Chris Gardner was a good parent for one reason if nothing else;he didn't lie to his son.Instead of making promises he could'nt keep,he did his best to keep the boy safe and calm and always told him the truth as he could understand it,even if it wasn't what the boy wanted to hear.The juxtaposition of actuall homeless people with actors was a great idea as Jaden's sometimes confused and frightened interactions all the more real;no child should have to go through what he does in this movie.But Chris maintains his dignity extremely well even at the lowest ebb of riding the subway all night,because there was nowhere else to be.Even studying as a non salery intern at Dean Witter Chris is a very intelligent man;he encourages and respects his son's thirst for knowledge,has an idedic memory for numbers and can solve rubix cubes in a few minutes.But where he seems to fail is common sense.Most of the things he went through would'nt have occured had he not been so obsessed with people who ran off with his Bone Density machines;these escapades lead him to almost get killed by a car.But he's doing it all for his child.'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is kind of an oxymoron because this is more about the pursuit.There isn't a lot of happy moments in this movie no.Some light humor.Another good thing is Will Smith produced this himself and totally avoided the mawkish melodrama movies about this subject have tended to have in the best-he concentrates on humanity and genuine love.It's a true story and nothing is over the top;it did and could all really happen.But even at it's saddest moments 'Pursuit Of Happiness' is very positive.Of course it has a happy ending but that isn't the point-the journey is what's important.It doesn't glamorize homelessness-it glamorizes love and fatherhood and if you have to glamorize

1054150,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000N6U0DS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Will Smith carries this film on his very sturdy shoulders and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has matured since his `Fresh Prince' days into a very fine actor.  His performance is layered, structured and intelligent, but amidst all of that he still comes across natural and refreshing, never forced or mechanical.  Every emotion runs through his blood effortlessly and full of believable conviction.  I've always been a fan of Smith, but here he returns to the brilliance he possessed in `Ali', coupling his on screen fire with heart and soul that transcends the meaningless boundary's of comic relief but that which leaves a deep rooted sense of character and warmth.  Smith disappears inside Christopher Gardener but he never loses himself, his charm and his commanding presence.`The Pursuit of Happyness' tells the true life story of Christopher Gardener, a family man who gets wrapped up in the wrong pyramid scheme and ends up broke and homeless.  His wife Linda, played by Thandie Newton, walks out on him he's left desolate and alone.  The love for his son Christopher, played brilliantly by Smith's own son Jaden, is what keeps Gardener holding on in pursuit of a better life.One thing that Christopher has going for him is potential.  He's a smart man with ambition and determination and so when he sees an opportunity to rise above himself through an internship with a law-firm he takes it despite the fact of no pay and he uses it to better himself and his surroundings.  Smith's wide range of emotions are what keeps this story compelling and entertaining, from his sadness and grief stricken situation to his cheerful demeanor he masquerades in for his sons sake to that emotional clap of relief as he realizes his dreams amidst a crowded sidewalk, Smith breaks down his own barriers and builds for himself a place alongside the acting giants of today.With pros there must also exist cons, and those cons appear in a few different forms.  The first form is that of co-star Thandie Newton who develops a bad habit of repelling the viewer.  Her character, while unsympathetic in general, is overly unsympathetic not to mention a tad-bit annoying, and that's putting it nicely.  Where's that girl I saw in `Crash' who stole the entire show from her co-stars, who electrified the screen and screamed ""nominate me""?  She's lost albeit in a mess of a character who could have been so much more but turned out so much worse than anticipated.  The flow of the film is a bit choppy as well.  Some parts flow by effortlessly while others drag on and even get a bit redundant.  The director at times tries too hard to emphasize Gardeners destitute condition when that said condition is already made apparent enough for the average viewer.That said, there is still a lot of good to remember when recalling this film, and Will Smith's brilliant performance is reason enough to watch it at least once.  I also must mention Smith's young son Jaden who perfectly compliments his father's passion by effortlessly mastering his performance which is sympathetic, controlled and elegant, never over the top or exaggerated like it could have been.  He comes across as poised as his father and as at home in his performance as an actor who's been doing this all his life.  One day this young actor will reach the feats his father has, and with a beginning as strong as this one he may end up there sooner than later.  This story is one to be heard, and told as beautifully as it is here makes it easy on the ears.",4,Smith finally breaks through into the elite of actors and gives us as all something cheer about...,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,3514,"['Will', 'Smith', 'film', 'very', 'sturdy', 'shoulders', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'matured', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'days', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'performance', 'layered', 'structured', 'intelligent', 'still', 'natural', 'refreshing', 'never', 'forced', 'mechanical', 'emotion', 'blood', 'effortlessly', 'full', 'believable', 'conviction', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Smith', 'here', 'brilliance', 'possessed', 'Ali', 'coupling', 'screen', 'fire', 'heart', 'soul', 'meaningless', 'boundary', 'comic', 'relief', 'deep', 'rooted', 'sense', 'character', 'warmth', 'Smith', 'Christopher', 'Gardener', 'never', 'charm', 'commanding', 'presence.', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Christopher', 'Gardener', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'wrapped', 'up', 'wrong', 'pyramid', 'scheme', 'up', 'broke', 'homeless', 'wife', 'Linda', 'played', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'out', 'left', 'desolate', 'alone', 'love', 'son', 'Christopher', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Smith', 'own', 'son', 'Jaden', 'what', 'Gardener', 'holding', 'pursuit', 'better', 'life.One', 'thing', 'Christopher', 'going', 'potential', 'smart', 'man', 'ambition', 'determination', 'so', 'when', 'opportunity', 'rise', 'internship', 'law-firm', 'fact', 'pay', 'better', 'surroundings', 'Smith', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'are', 'what', 'story', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'sadness', 'grief', 'stricken', 'situation', 'cheerful', 'demeanor', 'sons', 'sake', 'emotional', 'clap', 'relief', 'dreams', 'amidst', 'crowded', 'sidewalk', 'Smith', 'down', 'own', 'barriers', 'builds', 'place', 'acting', 'giants', 'today.With', 'pros', 'there', 'must', 'also', 'exist', 'cons', 'cons', 'appear', 'few', 'different', 'forms', 'first', 'form', 'co-star', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'who', 'bad', 'habit', 'repelling', 'viewer', 'character', 'unsympathetic', 'general', 'overly', 'unsympathetic', 'not', 'mention', 'tad-bit', 'annoying', 'putting', 'nicely', 'Where', 'girl', 'saw', 'Crash', 'who', 'stole', 'entire', 'show', 'co-stars', 'who', 'electrified', 'screen', 'screamed', 'nominate', 'lost', 'albeit', 'mess', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'worse', 'anticipated', 'flow', 'film', 'bit', 'choppy', 'well', 'parts', 'flow', 'effortlessly', 'others', 'drag', 'even', 'get', 'bit', 'redundant', 'director', 'times', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'emphasize', 'Gardeners', 'destitute', 'condition', 'when', 'said', 'condition', 'already', 'made', 'apparent', 'enough', 'average', 'viewer.That', 'said', 'still', 'lot', 'good', 'remember', 'when', 'recalling', 'film', 'Will', 'Smith', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'also', 'must', 'mention', 'Smith', 'young', 'son', 'Jaden', 'who', 'perfectly', 'father', 'passion', 'effortlessly', 'mastering', 'performance', 'sympathetic', 'controlled', 'elegant', 'never', 'top', 'exaggerated', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'poised', 'father', 'home', 'performance', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'young', 'actor', 'will', 'reach', 'feats', 'father', 'beginning', 'as', 'strong', 'one', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'there', 'sooner', 'later', 'story', 'one', 'be', 'heard', 'told', 'as', 'beautifully', 'here', 'easy', 'ears']",N/A

That would be incredibly tragic and put a damper on the story.As for the movie, my lower than average rating is because I found the movie to be sooo depressing.

Here he gives an incredible performance as the quintessential good man who struggles to survive against random events which nearly overwhelm him (and would probably overwhelm anyone else). I just got done making a point about the movie Apocalypto which I will also make here. Movies like these fully reveal how silly we are to spend so much time obsessed with race, sex, and class in our society because no matter what your persuasion or ethnicity is most of us can easily relate intimately to those who differ from us when the circumstances necessitate it. In this film we cheer for Smith to succeed with all of our might. Our desire to see him make it is all-consuming.All of us, no matter what we look like, can relate to the character of Chris Gardner. The first hour of the film is almost painful to watch as we see a bright, capable, assertive man get beaten down by the vagaries of life. They called him ""Ten Gallon Head"" in high school because of how smart he was but most of the film is a testament to man's impotence and limitations when confronted with forces he cannot control. His intelligence does not even seem to matter. Gardner seems to ""run bad"" for 95 percent of the movie.Yet, his character and belief in himself are pervasively on display. He is a role model to everyone. Despite the disasters that keep punching him in the gut he refuses to quit. He refuses to accept defeat. He fights until...well, see the film.

Set in 1981, Chris is a struggling medical equipment salesman. Chris is a smart guy, but made the mistake of selling medical equipment in which he had to buy all the product up front and then finds out no one wants the stuff.  So, Chris has a wife that basically hates him and a job that isn't paying and bills that are due. With his life going down the tubes, Chris sees the lifestyles that the successful stockbrokers have and wants it. He applies for an internship and gets it, but finds out the job doesn't pay a salary. Then his wife leaves him and his young son, played by Smith's actual son.Chris juggles daycare and bills and selling the medical equipment while trying to learn the ins and outs of selling stocks. Eventually, the bills catch up with him and Chris and his son are homeless, forced to fight for places in line at homeless shelters.This movie was a successful Christmas blockbuster and the preview packs an emotional punch. I expected a feel-good tear jerker, but what I got was a drama without the highs and lows expected from the genre.  The problem I saw is the lack of conflict. Sure, Chris is homeless and poor, but we know he eventually succeeds.  Also, every executive Chris encounters treats him nicely or with respect, so we never see Chris as the object of ridicule that he could have been considering his at time rough appearance.  This is a well made movie and entertaining, but it moves along at a predictable paceBy no means do I think this is a bad movie. I highly recommend it. Smith is excellent, his kid (Jaden Smith) isn't as good of an actor as some have said. Especially enjoyable is Chris's interaction with some of the Dean Witter clients and his ploy to get free tickets to a San Francisco 49ers game.

Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happyness.(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit. The film makers did this in order to show how far the Mr. Gardner had come.)",4,A Tale Of Two Struggles: Fatherhood And Financial,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,2819,"[""'re"", 'not', 'feel-good', 'person', 'still', 'okay', 'watch', 'THE', 'PURSUIT', 'OF', 'HAPPYNESS', 'moments', 'out', 'more', 'story', 'human', 'struggle', 'touchy-feely', 'film', 'based', 'real-life', 'events', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'also', 'emotional', 'heft', 'story', 'bit', 'cheating', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', '.Most', 'story', 'impact', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'Chris', 'Will', 'Smith', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'BAGGER', 'VANCE', 'son', 'Christopher', 'played', 'Smith', 'real-life', 'son', 'Jaden', 'interactions', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'effortless', 'watching', 'film', 'sheer', 'joy', 'herein', 'lay', 'trap', 'other', 'young', 'actor', 'had', 'played', 'beside', 'Will', 'Smith', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'come', 'off', 'easy', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'film', 'team', 'making', 'decision', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'matter', 'how', 'unfair', 'might', 'seem', 'other', 'father/son', 'film', 'struggle', 'easy-going', 'nature', 'similar', 'characters.Viewing', 'one', 'man', 'dogged', 'determination', 'maintain', 'functioning', 'relationship', 'son', 'would', 'be', 'admirable', 'today', 'society', 'matter', 'what', 'Especially', 'coming', 'financially', 'destitute', 'broken', 'family', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'refused', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'becoming', 'successful', 'father', 'businessman', 'felt', 'movie', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'performance', 'tumbling', 'off', 'screen', 'Losing', 'everything', 'only', 'scramble', 'back', 'up', 'be', 'repeatedly', 'challenged', 'nothing', 'new', 'cinema', 'Smith', 'completely', 'believable', 'performance', 'something', 'wonder', 'real', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'put', 'loan', 'Smith', 'production', 'everything', 'had', 'authentic', 'feel', 'also', 'meant', 'were', 'fewer', 'liberties', 'taken', 'story', 'Gardner', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'certain', 'omissions', 'changes.The', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Will', 'Smith', 'son', 'corny', 'jokes', 'tickle-fests', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'dinosaurs', 'touching', 'dialogue', 'moved', 'story', 'brighter', 'territory', 'darkest', 'times', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'CRASH', 'also', 'well', 'Smith', 'alienated', 'wife', 'little', 'screen', 'time.Learning', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'something', 'can', 'take', 'bank', 'Mr.', 'Gardner', 'certainly', 'did', 'now', 'multimillionaire', 'who', 'assisting', 'poor', 'very', 'San', 'Francisco', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'sobering', 'story', 'place', 'Giving', 'back', 'homeless', 'shelters', 'getting', 'notice', 'about', 'hunger', 'own', 'cities', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'not', 'only', 'success', 'smart', 'thoughtful', 'other', 'reason', 'should', 'watch', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'Note', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'real', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'cameo', 'spot', 'wearing', 'very', 'expensive', 'suit', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'order', 'show', 'how', 'far', 'Mr.', 'Gardner', 'had', 'come']",N/A

What it delivered was a hokey attempt to pull at the viewer's heart strings with an overly depressing and contrived set of circumstances.A well made movie understands how to tease the moviegoer with waves of sadness, relief, and joy. The director threw all that out the window and leaves you depressed for 115 minutes and happy for 2 minutes. The problem is that the viewer is so inundated with the negative that we begin to resent the movie as a disingenuous attempt to appeal to our sympathies. By the time the climax, and only non-depressing moment of the movie, comes the viewer no longer cares about the outcome of the film or for the well being of the characters.In addition, upon further analysis of the movie one can only come to the inescapable conclusion that Will Smith's character is a bad role model and a poor father figure. Not only do we have to watch him continually make bad life decisions, but we also have to witness him force his son from his mother, who had a steady job and residence, only to neglect him in day care and force him to sleep in homeless shelters and public toilets. In addition, all of this hardship is under the pretense of him getting a better job and a better life. However, by all definitions the job he is attempting to get is a pipe dream, akin to winning the lottery. So not only  is he gambling with his future, but more importantly, he is gambling with his son's future.In the end one can't help but to feel that he neither deserves the job nor the company of his son. And although he may now be a multi-millionaire in real life, we the viewers will always know that when push came to shove, he unfairly made his own selfish desires a priority over the well being of his son.",1,"Overly Depressing, Poor Role Model, Fails to Deliver",1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,1825,"['went', 'movie', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'inspiring', 'story', 'someone', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'What', 'delivered', 'was', 'hokey', 'attempt', 'pull', 'viewer', 'heart', 'overly', 'depressing', 'contrived', 'set', 'circumstances.A', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'how', 'tease', 'moviegoer', 'waves', 'sadness', 'relief', 'joy', 'director', 'threw', 'out', 'window', 'depressed', '115', 'minutes', 'happy', '2', 'minutes', 'problem', 'viewer', 'so', 'inundated', 'negative', 'begin', 'resent', 'movie', 'disingenuous', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'sympathies', 'time', 'climax', 'only', 'non-depressing', 'moment', 'movie', 'viewer', 'no', 'longer', 'outcome', 'film', 'well', 'being', 'characters.In', 'addition', 'further', 'analysis', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'inescapable', 'conclusion', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'bad', 'role', 'model', 'poor', 'father', 'figure', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'watch', 'continually', 'make', 'bad', 'life', 'decisions', 'also', 'have', 'witness', 'force', 'son', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'steady', 'job', 'residence', 'only', 'neglect', 'day', 'care', 'force', 'sleep', 'homeless', 'shelters', 'public', 'toilets', 'addition', 'hardship', 'pretense', 'getting', 'better', 'job', 'better', 'life', 'However', 'definitions', 'job', 'attempting', 'get', 'pipe', 'dream', 'akin', 'winning', 'lottery', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'gambling', 'future', 'more', 'importantly', 'gambling', 'son', 'future.In', 'end', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'job', 'company', 'son', 'may', 'now', 'be', 'multi-millionaire', 'real', 'life', 'viewers', 'will', 'always', 'know', 'when', 'push', 'came', 'shove', 'unfairly', 'made', 'own', 'selfish', 'priority', 'well', 'being', 'son']",N/A

Yes, the film is based on a true, inspirational story and Will's real life son Jaden, playing his on screen son is adorable. There are also numerous enjoyable performances by the supporting cast, specially the homeless guy (John Robb) looking for a time machine. Product values are superior throughout and the storyline possesses both depth and character. The problem is that Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) personal crisis goes on too long and by the time things are finally turning positive the film abruptly ends and the audience is denied the opportunity to sit back for a moment and relish the emotional high from his accomplishment.A good film, definitely something you should see.

Take away the true ""cuteness"" between Will Smith - the main  character - and his son, who is also his real life son.  Take away Smith's great acting skills (Note: he has come a far way from ""The Prince of Bel-Air"").  Take also away the good camera movement and the editing.  What you are left with is a story of a man who despite his social standing, his nonsupporting wife, his skin color, his education, his age and his lack of ""luck"" goes after what he wants.  And Smith's character does not just go after it, he pursues it.  He puts all his effort, all his time and all his strength into building a better life for himself and his son.The story is obvious from the beginning, but nonetheless, the viewer is drawn in and is rooting for the underdog.  We applaud his persistence when he goes after the head of HR at a large company, demanding an in-person interview to be accepted into a apprenticeship position.  We are cheering at his ingenuity when instead of listening to his trainer to move from the bottom of a calling sheet, he immediately goes to the top.  We are amazed about his sincerity when he goes to someone's house to apologize for being late.What is important to note is that Smith's character is rarely seen to use government services for help.  We never see him using food stamps and he only at the very end stays at a local shelter.  Smith's character is a man who uses his wits, his determination and his drive to move himself into a position that in the end will allow him to build the life that he envisions for himself and his son.I highly recommend this movie for families with teenagers, who will benefit greatly from such an uplifting story.

The title for one thing, had me on guard against the protaganist being some kind of misspelling apologist, and I am adamantly opposed to people of that kidney. Early on, however, I was disabused of that notion, and found instead that the central character was in fact, a correct spelling stickler. What a relief.He is also a fan of the poetic writing of Thomas Jefferson in The Declaration of Independence, and in voice-over ruminates on how Jefferson , in his wisdom, realized that perfect happiness might not ever be possible, but was something that nevertheless, all had a right to pursue.The other contributing factor to the aforementioned trepidation was that this retelling of the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches fable would be tedious drudgery. Too much hard work. This was not your usual Hollywood mindless entertainment, instant gratification for Live-For-The-Momentsters, but it was well worth the time and effort invested. Hard work, yes, but productive work that paid many dividends.In a promotional appearance on a talk show (probably Letterman, since I eschew Leno) with his real life son Jaden Smith in tow (who also plays his character's son in the film), Will Smith bragged about what a great actor his son was. He had even given him advice pertaining to his own acting that had greatly enhanced his performance. I was very skeptical of this claim, because of course he would be biased in his son's favor. But, after seeing the film, I would have to agree with him. His son did a great job walking that tight rope between being cute, but not so damn cute that it becomes annoying.A prime example of that is the kid who plays Bobby Jr. on the sitcom, All of Us: Khamani Griffin. In case you haven't seen it, the show was conceived and created by Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and is based on their own modern approach to raising kids with divorced parents, in evolving, caring relationships. Bobby Jr. is so repulsively cute that he would make anyone want to puke after watching him for five seconds. Surprisingly, that never happens in this movie, possibly because of the harrowing situations father and son goes through together.Will Smith did some great acting here as well. One scene in a Metro/BART terminal restroom was very moving. Homeless, he and his son are forced to sleep there, and he tries to make it an adventure. He is lugging one of his unsold bone density scanners, which he has rescued from a crazy street person who believed it was a time machine. He tells his son it really is a time machine, and when they press the button, pretends they are back in the time of dinosaurs, and the restroom is a cave. He cries actual tears here, and is totally believable. Another scene with a Rubik's Cube shows another side of his thespian skills, as well as evoking 1981. Another scene where he must interview for the stockbroker internship in paint splattered jeans was well done. Don't ask why. Parking tickets. If you have ever lived in San Francisco, you would know what that was like.In fact, San Francisco in 1981 was pretty much how it looked in this movie. Sometimes movies or TV Shows are set in San Francisco, but they get everything wrong. Like you know it was shot in LA, with just a few establishing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge thrown in, but totally in the wrong place. Suddenly Susan, Full House, Greg & Dharma--even Bullet, with Steve McQueen had him in the Tenderloin, and then on the next block, suddenly he was in The Marina. The crazy street person (John Robb) who thought his bone density scanner was a time machine was a bit jarring, like the tone suddenly shifted, and we were in a different, less realistic movie, or one of those stupid sitcoms, but since this was based on the real-life experience, I have no doubt that it probably happened exactly as depicted. All of the rest of the people were very believable, especially the stockbrokers. A friend of mine, who actually was a stockbroker intern during that same time and place concurred that it was pretty accurate.Finally, I was pretty excited when I saw the opening credits and found that Thandie Newton was in it, but she didn't have much to do as his wife but nag and eventually leave him. Oh, well. That is a pursuit for another movie, I suppose.",4,Good Will Smithing,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,4832,"['Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'played',

""The Pursuit Of Happyness"" (ironically ""Happiness"" is mispelled just like in the movie...but the ""F"" word was spelled correctly) was an awesome movie to watch. Basically it's about a family who is struggling to get by and accumulated so much debt (parking tickets, fines, taxes, etc.) that they have no where to turn. The father (Will Smith), who sells bone density scanners for a living while the mother (Thandie Newton) works double shifts all in order to pay rent and daycare for their son (played by Jayden Christopher Smith). Eventually they come to some rough times and the mother bails out on the family, leaving the father and son moving from place to place for a place to sleep. I really don't want to give away the movie like some reviewers have. At times, this movie can be very depressing, such as the part where the father and son sleep in the bathroom of a train station. Watching this movie right here, I've learned that life can easily be much worse than it already is, and hopefully I never have to end up on the streets and sleep in public bathrooms. Then ending of the movie is worthwile though. There were some funny parts in the movie though (like the time Chris Gardner ran from the cab without paying fare). You reall have to check this movie out, because it is so inspirational about life. Also I believe lil' Jayden Smith has a promising acting career ahead of him, judging by the way he played his part in the movie.

1054178,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000N6U0DS,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","When Oprah Winfrey interviewed the real Christopher Gardner, I found his story absolutely amazing, more so than the film adaptation of his life, ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" There are many things to appreciate about this kind of film: it's an inspiring Rags to Riches story with a main character who must overcome adversity if he's to succeed. It also reinforces a number of life lessons that many have yet to learn. However, something different needed to be done if the intention was to actually impress me; yes, this film is inspiring, but so is ""Working Girl,"" ""Cinderella Man,"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" This kind of film has been made many, many times before, and frankly, it's getting tiresome.So why am I giving it four stars? I suppose because, as worn out and cliched as this story is, it at least has some decent performances and a good message. And it delivers exactly as you expect it to: if you want a feel good film, you've got a feel good film. I'm sure those of you who aren't as jaded as I am will be reduced to tears by the plight of Gardner, played in the film by Will Smith. He overcomes a number of difficult circumstances, ones that many wouldn't be able to handle if they were in his place. Living in San Francisco in 1981, Gardner tried his hand at selling bulky bone density machines to hospitals, thinking that such a technology would be preferred over traditional x-rays. Unfortunately, most of the hospitals considered them to be unnecessary luxuries and weren't willing to invest.As a result of slow business, Gardner and his family are in a financial crisis: their rent is months overdue; they owe the IRS; and they can't rely solely on the wife's income. How fortuitous that he should pass a man getting out of his Ferrari. ""What do you do and how do you do it?"" asks Gardner. ""I'm a stockbroker,"" replies the man, pointing to the building they're both standing next to. He also says that you don't necessarily have to go to college to be a stockbroker; you only need to be good with numbers and good with people. This inspires Gardner to apply for the internship program at Dean Witter. He's offered a position (aided by his ability to solve a Rubik's Cube). Despite the fact that he'll receive no salary, and despite the fact that he's down on his luck, he accepts the offer, believing that if he can work through the internship, something better will come along.Unfortunately, it's too little too late in terms of his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton). Years of financial strain have pushed her to the breaking point, and she decides to leave for New York. Of course, she wants to take their five-year-old son, Chris, Jr. (played by Smith's real life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), but both she and Gardner know that she can't care for him. Thus, Chris is left with his father. This suits Gardner just fine; early on, his voiceover narration says that he didn't meet his real father until he was twenty-six, and that no matter what, he would make sure his children knew who their father was.For most of the rest of the film, it seems as if everything will continue to go downhill. For one thing, he can no longer afford to pay his rent, meaning he has to leave his apartment. He and his son move into a local motel, where he pays half of what he paid for rent. But then the IRS finally catches up with him, taking over six hundred dollars out of his bank account. He's left with just over twenty dollars, which is not nearly enough to pay for their room. This paves the way for one of the film's more devastating scenes; with nowhere else to go for the night, they lock themselves in a subway bathroom. The impact of the scene is heightened by the fact that someone continuously rattles the door on the other end.The effectiveness of this scene depended on its originality. I say this because the rest of the film is unflatteringly run of the mill. At one point, when shooting hoops with his son, Gardner says, ""Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You want something, you go for it, period."" It's a fine sentiment, certainly, but haven't we heard such sentiments before? And consider the character of Alan Frakesh (Dan Castellaneta), the Dean Witter employee who trains the new interns; while he never talks down to Gardner, he does ask him to do degrading menial tasks, such as getting him coffee, buying him donuts, and re-parking his car to avoid the street sweepers. I can't help but wonder if he was included merely as a counterpoint to Gardner's good spirit; are villains of these kind required in such films?Nonetheless, I was moved by Gardner's tenacity, which is another reason why I went ahead and gave the film four stars. He clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word ""quit,"" which is one of the best attitudes to have in life. Even when forced to wait in long lines to stay in homeless shelters, he refuses to settle for what he has been dealt. He's determined to make a better life for himself and his son, which is difficult considering Chris, Jr. doesn't completely understand what his father is going through. He's merely a boy of five, with a basketball, a little multicolored backpack, and a Captain America figurine in his possession. There's no denying that the kid is as cute as a button, which is probably what enabled me to look past the heavy-handedness of his line, ""You're a good papa.""I don't think there's any question of whether or not Gardner overcomes adversity; the real life Christopher Gardner is now a multimillionaire in his own firm. The fact that he succeeded clearly makes his story inspiring, and for that, I'm recommending ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Still, I got the sense that this film adaptation altered the story to make it more appealing for a mass audience, which resulted in a number of tried and true elements that have long since worn out their welcome. It can't be a good thing when a five-minute segment on ""Oprah"" is more interesting than a two-hour film; Gardner told Oprah his childhood Christmas Day experience. While he was taking a bath, his abusive stepfather stormed in, held a gun at him, and told him to get out of the apartment. Naked and wet, Gardner was left outside on a freezing December night. That kind of material would have made more of an impact than the material in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" did. Unfortunately, I'm forced to settle for yet another feel good tearjerker.",4,He Works Hard for the Money,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,6406,"['When', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'interviewed', 'real',

Smith's character is doing poorly selling an overpriced med-tech bone density scanner to physicians. He applies for an internship to become a stockbroker at Dean Witter, but there is no pay. He can't pay his bills, and his wife leaves him. He is evicted from two different rental units, spends a night in jail, and nights in homeless shelters and subways (always in the company of his son). Everything bad that can possibly happen to him does happen. It happens so much that I was uncomfortable watching much of it. I think what is missing from the film is any in-depth relationships that Chris Gardner has with anyone besides his son. They seem to be alone in an indifferent world. He doesn't seem to have anyone he can turn to for help and support.

Mounting bills --- so what, people will wait until tomorrow.  Unhappy wife --- she'll be happy tomorrow.  Then it hits the fan.  But instead of folding and crumbling in self-pity, or relinquishing his son, this man chooses to take a chance he knows has the best possibility for a secure, long term pay off.There are so many lessons in this film on attitude, self-worth and never giving up on the right thing.  In such a competitive environment, the film showed what to do to keep up with and pass the competition.  This man had drive.  At the Day Care, I was glad they showed a Dad being concerned with the care of his son.  It was good to see a Dad answering his sons questions and never ignoring him.

S. and over $300 million worldwide.  Why?  Because everyone knows more about hard times than they care to admit.  We know what its like to be up against it financially, have a period in our lives when it is hard to pay the rent or make the mortgage payment.  While most of us haven't had to use a men's room as sleeping accommodations, we know what it is like to want to care for our children and have times when we can't provide for them as we would like. Most people know what it is like to have more meals of macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles than they would choose to have if they had more green in their wallets. Many more people know what a shutoff warning from the utility company looks like than would tell you about it.We know what it is like to have dreams and to pursue them under pressure and against tough odds.  We know what it is like to want to teach our kids about life and then later regret giving them our own disappointments rather than the truth and how that might sap their own dreams and vitality - the gifts of youth - and to want to take those words back.Almost all marriages have tough times.  Not every marriage collapses, but the pressures of life have killed marriages that could have made it under different circumstances.  We know what it is like to make a mistake in choosing a bad job and having to work our way out of it.For these reasons, and many more, we relate to this movie.  It is terrific.  And the performances by Will and Jaden Smith are something quite special.  Will Smith is always charismatic on the screen, but this time he wisely lets Jaden have that dramatic space and Will plays Chris Gardner, a real man under real pressure.  Chris is a brilliant man who didn't have the opportunities to develop his intellectual talents as he should have had.  He and his hard working wife made a tough business decision in trying to sell bone density scanners, but it was a product wasn't as accepted in the marketplace as they had hoped.  Now Linda (played with the right notes by Thandie Newton) has to work two shifts while their money gets spread thinner and thinner - to the point of evaporation.  A nice touch is when Linda pours the left over iced tea in their dinner glasses back into the pitcher.  Only people really hurting do that kind of thing.However, despite the hardship, this is a positive and heartwarming movie.  We root for everyone in the film.  We realize that a lot of the pain in the film is caused by mis-communication or a total lack of willingness or ability to simply go and explain the situation to another.  Maybe that was impossible and things would not have worked out as well if they had.  Still, we wish people would just say this or that to that person there.A terrific movie.

1054194,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000N6U0DS,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[4, 5]","As a big Will Smith fan, I was hoping for a great performance by the actor in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"".  In ""Men in Black"", ""Enemy of the State"", and ""I, Robot"" Smith delivered amazing performances.  In ""Ali"", ""Bad Boys II"", and ""Wild Wild West"", Smith not only delivered lackluster performances, but he chose scripts that really failed to deliver anything worth the price of admission.  But this film, this absolute brilliant masterpiece of movie making creativity, deserves a whole lot of recognition!""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is one of the most ""real-to-life"" movies to come around in a while.  The script is energetic, interesting, and smart; the acting is second to none; and the performance Will Smith turns in is without a doubt his best work to date.This is the kind of movie that can inspire people to see past their struggles and look toward the light at the end of the tunnel.  People who are going through financial, spiritual, and mental struggles need a film like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" to remind them that lots of people have struggled, are struggling, and will struggle to be the best they can be in life.Will Smith (playing the role of Chris Gardner) and his on screen wife, Linda (played by Thandie Newton), are exceptionally convincing as two parents trying to make things work when everything in their lives seems to be falling apart.  Smith is stunningly realistic as a man just about to go over the deep end as life throws him as many punches as his Ali character actually took in the boxing ring.  Some of the scenes where Smith and Newton are verbally jousting looked as if a physical confrontation was about to come to fruition, but it doesn't.Smith had to rely on every single emotion, physical characteristics of humans, and making another person's story appear as his own to pull this film off.  This is his crowning achievement as far as this critic is concerned.  Much like Val Kilmer could make movies from now until the day he is unable to act and never be able to top his performance as Doc Holiday in the movie ""Tombstone"", Will Smith may never be able to rise above his accomplishments in this performance.Jaden Smith plays the part of Christopher (Chris Gardner's son) and is just as convincing as his real life father throughout the entire film.  The two work magic on the big screen.  And as much as I don't get into the whole put-a-cute-kid-in-a-movie-and-you-can't-lose philosophy, Jaden Smith is a kid you just can't help but enjoy seeing say predictable things in the movie.  The kid doesn't overact at all.  That's a big plus for a film like this, where it is based on a true story.Brian Howe (playing the part of Jay Twistle) is great as the man who gives Gardner his first big shot at a more positive future.  His fascination with the Rubik's Cube while riding in a taxi, Gardner begging him for a chance at becoming a stockbroker, is a scene I won't soon forget.  Two men in a taxi, trying to solve Rubik's Cube, with one of the men trying to find a way to solve the puzzle of his own life, and one man not even realizing the desperation that was riding beside him in the taxi; now that's irony.  Isn't that exactly what causes a lot of the pain we see in the world today - the lack of one group of humans to see the needs and thoughts of another group of humans?Will Smith is a great actor, and he seems like a genuinely good person with a great future.  He is not your typical Hollywood Big Head, with the all the superstar baggage we see with most of the Hollywood elite.  The main character in this movie seems like the best example of what Smith's real life integrity is like; and it's a good statement!  I wish Smith and his family all the best!  Thanks for working so hard on this film.If you are reading this review and trying to decide if ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a movie worth seeing, just ask yourself if you are interested in the story of human struggle.

1054196,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000N6U0DS,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","""The Pursuit Of Happyness"" is an emotionally enriching cinematic experience.  It's basically a tribute to the pursuing one's dreams despite the obstacles that are thrown in front of you and perservering in the end.  Will Smith's Chris Gardner is an industrious chap with a lot of charm and savvy but suffers from a little misdirection.  He begins the film peddling around San Francisco doctor's offices bone density scanners.  This venture doesn't make him rich so he soon sets his goal on an internship with Dean Witter for a one-in-twenty shot at being a stockbroker.  There are many pitfalls to attaining his dream.  His wife recently left him with a five year old son to fend for.  The internship is unpaid.  He's evicted from a number of domiciles and at times forced to live in shelters and public bathrooms.  Racism isn't really cited as a reason for Chris' predicament but there are subtle hints like when Dean Witter's instructor forces Chris to park his car.  Despite it all Chris never wavers from his determination.  Credit Will Smith for giving a full-bodied portrait of a man who wants his piece of the American Pie.  Not to give anything away, the look on the face of Chris as he meets with the Dean Witter executives toward the films end will bring out the tear ducts.  Jaden Smith, Will's real life son and his son in the film, gives a naturally charming and unaffected performance.

His portrayal of a man fighting against poverty, and burdened by having a family on top of that was eerily convincing. I have a good friend who is a successful author who went through much of the same. Living out of his car, showering daily at the gym, working every day and writing at coffeehouses every night, basically doing whatever it took to stay alive and create a better future, while doing everything he could to keep anyone from finding out that he was homeless. Now he has a line of successful books and helps out others who are in need.To me this is more than a movie about someone overcoming adversity: this is a message of hope to anyone who is able to see this movie and realize that they are not alone, and not unable to change the future. I did some research and found the numbers of people living in their cars, vans, station wagons, and RV's in America is staggering. These people work next to us, go to movies, read books, pay taxes, and in every way are citizens, except for their ability to afford rent. Living in Los Angeles I know how expensive real estate is in California. Not every job pays enough to afford even a small apartment, but someone needs to make our espressos and  Big Macs or our way of living would cease. Knowing this makes this movie so much more poignant, so much more of a social commentary that it is not easy being poor, and even harder pulling yourself out of poverty when so many simply give in and accept it. But it gives hope to those who need it most. I applaud Will Smith for making a movie with this gravity in between his more action-oriented projects.",5,This move was inspiring,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,1766,"['have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Will', 'Smith', 'movies', 'missed', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'dodged', 'bullet', 'was', 'astounded', 'how', 'deeply', 'moving', 'movie', 'was', 'portrayal', 'man', 'fighting', 'poverty', 'burdened', 'having', 'family', 'top', 'was', 'eerily', 'convincing', 'have', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'successful', 'author', 'who', 'went', 'much', 'same', 'Living', 'car', 'showering', 'daily', 'gym', 'working', 'day', 'writing', 'coffeehouses', 'night', 'basically', 'doing', 'took', 'stay', 'alive', 'create', 'better', 'future', 'doing', 'everything', 'could', 'keep', 'anyone', 'finding', 'out', 'was', 'homeless', 'Now', 'line', 'successful', 'books', 'out', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'need.To', 'more', 'movie', 'someone', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'message', 'hope', 'anyone', 'who', 'able', 'see', 'movie', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'not', 'unable', 'change', 'future', 'did', 'research', 'found', 'numbers', 'people', 'living', 'cars', 'vans', 'station', 'wagons', 'RV', 'America', 'staggering', 'people', 'work', 'next', 'go', 'movies', 'read', 'books', 'pay', 'taxes', 'way', 'are', 'citizens', 'ability', 'afford', 'rent', 'Living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'know', 'how', 'expensive', 'real', 'estate', 'California', 'Not', 'job', 'enough', 'afford', 'even', 'small', 'apartment', 'someone', 'make', 'espressos', 'Big', 'Macs', 'way', 'living', 'would', 'cease', 'Knowing', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'social', 'commentary', 'not', 'easy', 'being', 'poor', 'even', 'harder', 'pulling', 'poverty', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'simply', 'give', 'accept', 'hope', 'who', 'need', 'most', 'applaud', 'Will', 'Smith', 'making', 'movie', 'gravity', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'projects']",N/A
1054199,A11L5M4MJP00UW,B000N6U0DS,"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover""","[1, 2]","The chemistry between Will Smith and his real son who stars in this makes this movie very special.  I don't think another child actor could have pulled it off as well.  Most of the movie is factual, but the age of the child was 2 and not 5 as in the movie.  Also I find it hard to believe that he would have twice lost the scanning machines he was trying to sell and then able to recover them both times (or was it 3 times)?  Several reviewers complained that the movie did not show much of the happy part of his life, but it wasn't necessary because you know that once he lands the job at Dean Whitter that he will be just fine, especially knowing the sacrifices that he went through to get it.  Some say this is Will Smith's best performance yet and it may well be.  He was very convincing in the role and nothing was over done or under done.  His kid was cute without being precocious or too smart.  The relationship between father and son couldn't have been done any better.  This is not a movie about overcoming racism, but in Chris Gardner's own words, it's about overcoming ""Placeism"".  By that he means being born in a poor family without influence or advantage and no money of his own and having to overcome those disadvantages.  The real Chris Gardner is a great role model for those who think they can't make it in this world because of who they are, the color of their skin, what they do or don't start with or where they come from.

The bonus features are nice, especially learning about the Italian director who could barely speak English and getting to see and hear the real Chris Gardner.

You see, in order to understand the struggle, you have to have LIVED it. I understand this movie because I HAVE lived it. Some other review cited that it took far too long to display the epic struggle that left us no time to relish the moment of success. I submit that were it not for the INTENSE struggle he faced, there would BE no reason to celebrate his ultimate success. It would have less meaning. I have NEVER cried so hard as I did at the end of this movie. During the course of the film, you FEEL his pain of wanting to be just that little bit more than what he felt himself to be. You yearn for him to experience that one bit of happiness to know that he doesn't HAVE to sell his blood anymore to make a few bucks to be able to fix a light in a bone density scanner he sells to provide a meal and a place to live for a few weeks for himself and his son. This man went through more tribulations than any of the other reviewers here have seen in their own lives or the family and friends that surround them. If you want to see a film that TRULY lifts you up by the climax, see the pursuit of happyness, and IGNORE the many discouraging reviews from people who have no clear understanding of personal anguish and eventual triumph.

It makes you ponder upon your future life, weather you'd wind up struggling or making it the easy way throughout life. The movie showed a caring father who loves and puts no one above his child, and gave a good example for young men these days, telling them that no matter what happens you should always be there for your child, and to always let them have that father figure in their lives. The way Will Smith played those roles so perfectly that you could feel his hurt, pain, and stress within the scenes in your heart. You know its amazing to see a black man show a great example of a great man coming up from nothing and making his life worth something, so that his child would do the same.

Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[0, 0]","When it comes to motivational and inspirational pursue-your-dreams kind of movies THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS may very well take home the prize.  I was amazed first by Will Smith's persuasive portrayal of Chris Gardner and second by the character's unending drive in the face of a barrage of setbacks, disappointments, along with the most unpredictable attacks from Murphy.  Long after most people would have thrown in the towel, he keeps on, stays focused, and doesn't rest until his dream of becoming a successful stockbroker and a providing father are complete.It's a message badly needed in our world today.  It's also a strong portrayal of a father which is rarely seen in Hollywood today (as Hollywood, for whatever reason, is almost never father-friendly).  I think my favorite line in the film (also in the trailer) is when after Chris's son says he wants to become a famous basketball player someday, and Chris almost unconsciously gives his son the typical reflex-reply that most parents would give: Don't practice too much, there's too many people better than you, etc.  (I'm paraphrasing.)  Then he catches himself and remembers his own seemingly hopeless situation and adds, ""Don't let anybody ever tell you that you can't do something--not even me!""My major problem with this film (many would probably call it a small thing) is the plain-sight portrayal of the F-word on the side of the son's daycare building.  I know they're trying to say it's in a rough neighborhood, but they could have conveyed that without putting an expletive on the side of the building.  Later we hear the boy repeat the word, asking if it's spelled correctly.  Lately, it seems Hollywood enjoys having small children use profanity in films.  This principle is incompatible with family entertainment.Come to think of it, there's no reason, why they couldn't have clean the film up and given it a PG-rating.",4,Good motivational story (but not what I'd call a family film),1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,1893,"['When', 'motivational', 'inspirational', 'pursue-your-dreams', 'kind', 'movies', 'THE', 'PURSUIT', 'OF', 'HAPPYNESS', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'take', 'home', 'prize', 'was', 'amazed', 'first', 'Will', 'Smith', 'persuasive', 'portrayal', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'second', 'character', 'unending', 'drive', 'face', 'barrage', 'setbacks', 'disappointments', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'attacks', 'Murphy', 'Long', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'thrown', 'towel', 'stays', 'focused', ""n't"", 'rest', 'dream', 'becoming', 'successful', 'stockbroker', 'providing', 'father', 'are', 'complete.It', 'message', 'badly', 'needed', 'world', 'today', 'also', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'father', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'reason', 'almost', 'never', 'father-friendly', 'think', 'favorite', 'line', 'film', 'also', 'trailer', 'when', 'Chris', 'son', 'become', 'famous', 'basketball', 'player', 'someday', 'Chris', 'almost', 'unconsciously', 'son', 'typical', 'reflex-reply', 'most', 'parents', 'would', 'give', 'Do', ""n't"", 'practice', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'better', 'etc', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'Then', 'remembers', 'own', 'seemingly', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anybody', 'ever', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'not', 'even', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'many', 'would', 'probably', 'call', 'small', 'thing', 'plain-sight', 'portrayal', 'F-word', 'side', 'son', 'daycare', 'building', 'know', ""'re"", 'trying', 'say', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'could', 'have', 'conveyed', 'putting', 'expletive', 'side', 'building', 'Later', 'hear', 'boy', 'repeat', 'word', 'asking', 'spelled', 'correctly', 'Lately', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'small', 'children', 'use', 'profanity', 'films', 'principle', 'incompatible', 'family', 'entertainment.Come', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'clean', 'film', 'up', 'given', 'PG-rating']",N/A

Some actors have such big personalities that it's hard to see them as the characters they're trying to portray. Except for 'The Legends of Bagger Vance' and the 'Fresh Prince' characters, most of Will Smith's performances have fallen into this category; which is hard to believe given his bankability. But 'The Pursuit of Happyness,' may take Will Smith's career in a new direction. I know he's already successful, I'm referring to his ability to play more realistic down to earth characters; characters with more substance. I usually approach these type (a black-man struggles to prove himself worthy and make it in a predominantly white mans field) films with a bit of trepidation. In truth, I generally hate these type films, because I'm always forced to ask myself why? Why do black men seeminlgly have such a hard time (both past and present) in a country that touts fairness and equality as it's cornerstone in the job market, the courts, etc. But this film was a refreshing departure from the quintessential feel-racially-sorry for that guy piece. It was a vindication of sorts for the determined. Smith finally takes you to a place where you momentarily forget it's him and follow the character. The performance by his son was also believable. Be advised though, the character had so many set backs it get's a bit tiresome to watch him rebound yet again. I would've liked to see the Chris Gardner character enjoy some of his well-deserved success. Living with new-found success is sometimes just as hard as the pursuit.

Foremost, the film is uplifting ... it is (forgive the cliche) a film which clearly illustrates the ""triumph of the human spirit."" It would have been a gross-misstep to ""downplay"" Gardner's challenges and hardships: this is what makes the ending as powerful as it is. Moreover, this film underscores that which is all-too-overlooked in our society: the unconditional love of a father for his child. Hollywood loves mothers, but often vilifies fathers ... it is refreshing to see a turn in the trend. And, that Will Smith's own son plays his on-screen son ... it is a tribute to fathers and sons everywhere.The quality of the film itself is worthy of a four or five-star rating. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting (watch for a cameo by the real Chris Gardner at the film's conclusion), and the film-extras: all are near immaculate. Hopefully, this will help allay the fears that the one and two-star ratings may have instilled. And, also allow me to say, that I am not a fan of mainstream film ... but I did enjoy this honest portrait of an incredible man.When you purchase this film, be certain to watch the film-extra ""The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner.""

1054218,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000N6U0DS,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","This is indeed a great inspirational film. It's the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who has struggled with both his finances and his support for his son. His only chance of success is becoming a stockbroker, and he tries his hardest during his internship while taking care of the only person he cares about. And he does this when he is evicted from his own home, and starts living in a motel, a subway train, even in a public bathroom. But Chris never gives up on not only his dreams of success, but his dream of his own son fulfilling his own dreams of success.Surely, this is a very inspirational film about perseverance, success, and family. And now this film is way more significant today. We're in the middle of a chaotic economic crisis, and it looks to be getting worse. Thousands of people are losing jobs and businesses, hundreds of homes are in foreclosure, food and gas prices have gone up, and big corporations are going bankrupt and being shut down. Of all the misery that the entire world is facing, there is still hope. We just can't give up on our own dreams. we can make it. We have to work hard at what we do and what we want to be, even if we can't pay our bills on time. Right now I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm still not giving up on my dreams of being a n author, despite many obstacles that I'm facing right now. My parents, older brother, and I have moved into an apartment just last year, and we're still facing major challenges. My parents and my brother aren't making that much money and are having trouble with payments, while I'm struggling with my grades (and money) during my fourth year in a community college and it looks like I've still got a few more years until I can actually transfer to a university. But I shouldn't feel horrible about all this. I still believe that we can pull this all off. We have to feel confident that we can achieve a great deal in the future. Right now, I'm in the process of writing several short stories, and I'm hoping to publish at least some of it this year. And maybe in a couple of years, I could publish my very first novel. With the obstacles I'm facing, I'm sure I can beat them.This is why ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" and Chris Gardner himself, is so special. It's a constant reminder that are dreams can be fulfilled. We have to work hard and believe in ourselves. If we quit, then we are disappointing ourselves and the people are supporting us. In the end, it's all about perseverance.""You got a dream, you got to protect. When people can't do something themselves, they want to tell you that you can't do it. You want something...you go get it.

The script was in dire need of tightening; three-fourths of the film did not have to be dedicated to Gardner's never ending battle with hardships and disappointments - and that machine! Viewers get the point at least halfway (if not sooner) through the movie.The script should have concentrated more on how his time as an intern at the brokerage firm helped lay the foundation for his future success - with the last act being more concerned with his growing financial success after he ventured out on his own; that's a great story that is never told - at least in the film. Instead, Gardner elaborates on that subject in the ""Special Features"" segment.As for Will Smith's performance, I can see why he was up for an Oscar. The fact that he didn't win in no way took anything away from a truly outstanding (and Oscar calibre) performance, matched only by his son's wonderful performance as well.Perhaps just as important as the message in the film is the discovery of Will Smith as a fine, leading actor in a dramatic role.

The line with his boy on the basketball court, where he tells him never to let anyone take his dream away by telling him he cannot do something, is very poignant as it shows us how easy it is to fold under negative pressure from people who say I CAN'T or YOU CAN'T.  The message here is to take what you do have, even when it seems it isn't much, and try with all you have within you to turn it around, survive, come out on top and say I CAN.

Will Smith did an excellent job capturing every heartfelt moment of his character. Its very rare that I cry watching movies, but the scenes that left me speechless and in tears were the bathroom scene, and the boardroom scene (near the end of the movie). Will deserves an oscar nom, if not the award for this movie, he was excellent.  The bathroom scene was so moving, especially the way he got his son to believe that they were hiding from dinosaurs.  It was by far the best acting scenes ever by any actor.  I know in a lot of movies when actors have to cry, you know its not real tears, but Will sure had me fooled. His emotions throughout the movie were so intense, I swear those many of his tears were real.  The courage the real life Chris Gardner had, to hold it all together despite his struggles to maintain some sense of self-respect, while trying to provide food and shelter for himself and his son. So many people complain about how bad their life is and some turn to drugs and violence as a means to survive, but this guy represents what it truly means to stand and deliver and that he did.  As Malcom X said ""A man who stands for nothing falls for anything"".  Chris Gardner stood for plenty and it paid off.  Little Will was so adorable in this movie, but yet his compassion and humor throughout the movie gave you hope for what would become of him. (probably an actor like his dad) Great movie!!

See the movie very carefully:  it's about a man struggling for survival so that he and his sone can fulfill that American dream:  the pursuit of happiness.You just feel bad for Chris Gardner in this movie.  No matter how hard he tried to do something, it seemed like he could never catch a break, but he never let that stop him from trying.  Your heart does go out to him on this one.  Despite the bad luck, he never let showed his son that he lost hope.  He always kept his chin up as he became more and more humbled in his situation.  That's why the end is so poignant and endearing.I could barely see this movie because I cried so hard.  I knew from just watching the trailer that Will Smith would garner and Oscar nomination; however, it was a close call toss up between him and Forest Whitaker portraying General Idi Amin.  Really, really close.  I still would have picked Will Smith because this story seemed to resonate with me, and I would have given this the Oscar for Best Picture, as well, but things as they were, it did not come to pass.I was surprised to learn that Will Smith and hisproducer John Lassiter actively sought Italian director Gabriele Muccino to direct this.  Muccino did ""the Las Kiss"" and ""Remember me, My Love"".  This whole movie experieince is based upon risk taking.  Will Smith took a risk on Gabriele Muccino to do this movie.  Muccino did a fabulous job being that this was his first non-Italian film ever.  Secondly, they auditioned so many kids to play the son of Chris Gardner, and they couldn't find any.  So they decided to give Will Smith's son a chance to read, and it turned out he was the best audition and he got cast.  So this is a first Father-son movie for Will Smith.  Thirdly, the whole movie centers aorund how the real Chris Gardner took a risk in his sales job to become a stock broker and after hitting a serious low and given his God-given chance, he finally becasme a success.How does a movie like this not get Best Picture?

Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt.  Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film.  Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco.  Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry.  The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed.  How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines.  Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy.  The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent.  PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is well worth the journey.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","SPOILERS, SPOILERS, and, yes, more SPOILERS.Stockbroker Chris Gardner's real life rags-to-riches story was featured in a 15 minute segment on 20/20 some years ago and it was memorable and inspirational enough that, now, we have THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, a film based, more or less, on that story. Now, certain facts have been altered a bit, ostensibly, for better dramatic consumption. Three examples of changes that were wrought are: back in 1981, Chris actually had custody of his infant son, not a five year old; instead of being unpaid, he did receive a meager stipend in his brokering internship; and Chris's wife Linda is fully fictionalized in the film. Whether such changes work or are even needed is, of course, left for you to decide. What's not up to debate is the quality of man it takes to pull off an underdog story like this. The real Chris Gardner must've been (and, presumably, still is) a formidably resilient man who made his own luck, who remained undeterred by a life that was kicking him to the curb.The film's plot: THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (The misspelled ""happyness"" originates from an outside mural displayed on the crappy Chinatown day care center to which Chris sends his son) is set in 1981, in San Francisco. Go-getter Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who had been an excellent student as a child but who now, as an adult, feels he's basically amounted to nothing, is eking out a hand-to-mouth living as an unsuccessful hawker of a hospital equipment called a bone density scanner, which proves to be a flop with the medical community. With a young 5 year old and an increasingly bitter wife to provide for, it's tough going for Chris. In fact, it's his wife Linda (a worn down, shrewish Thandie Newton), who toils in multiple shifts and, more often than not, furnishes the capital. Linda finds this lifestyle too unbearable and soon takes off for New York. Upon the insistence of Chris, she reluctantly leaves their son Christopher (Jaden Smith) in his care. Bye bye, Linda.Chris has a plan. A few scenes back, a fleeting encounter with a friendly stockbroker sporting a red Ferrari - who informed him that all one needed to have success in stocks was to be ""good with people and good with numbers"" - had impacted him enough  that he had decided to become a stockbroker himself. A month of persistence (or, basically, politely hounding an executive outside his brokerage building and then impressing him with his Rubik's Cube skills) lands him an interview for a prospective 6-month internship program with the prestigious Dean Witter firm, with the possibility of being hired at internship's end. He passes the interview and is offered a spot in the program, despite showing up dressed like a transient (a long story, involving paint, parking tickets, and prison). However, to his dismay, he finds that it is an unsalaried internship; after some long, hard thinking, he decides to still go for it, while re-dedicating himself to selling more of his bone density scanners to make ends meet.Of course, things go bad immediately. With his wife and her steady income gone, Chris struggles badly. He runs afoul of the landlord, the IRS, and, in one kinda funny sequence, of one dogged taxi driver. He does manage to sell a scanner, only to have his finances subsequently confiscated by the IRS. Down to literally mere dollars, he and his son succumb to poverty and become homeless; they find themselves forced to wait in line for hours to get into homeless shelters and, when not getting in the shelter, having to spend nights in public rest rooms. Meanwhile, during the day, Chris dons his business attire and attends his internship. He finds it difficult to compete with the other 19 aspirers in the program as they manage to put in 9 hours daily, whereas he's only able to spend 6 hours in the firm (he has to pick up his son from day care, catch the bus, get in line for the shelter, etc). To compensate, while in the firm, he doesn't drink water (thus, less time in the bathroom) and keeps the phone constantly in hand (discovering he gains 8 minutes by doing so). As the 6 months of internship continue to elapse, things get progressively worse for the Gardner family. And then the last day of internship comes...I won't lie, it's a pretty dark, gloomy film; but there's a beauty and a sincerity to it. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is imbued with a certain stark honesty, depicting Chris' struggles as he copes with his internship while simultaneously walking that tightrope between life on and off the streets. This film is sentimental without being too cloying and contains enough levity to thankfully provide a much-needed counterpoint to the main character's dreary, ever worsening plight.I truly enjoyed this film. It's 180 degrees away from the normal, breezy Will Smith flick. Although he's done serious cinema in the past, he's never put as much of his soul and his heart as he does in this one. It's evident that PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a personal project of his. One reason for his emotional investment is, undeniably, the casting of young Christopher, unaffectedly portrayed by Jaden Smith, who happens to be Will Smith's real life son. Their natural chemistry is what makes this whole shebang works. The bond between the two is a delight to behold. If there's any doubt that Will Smith is genuinely a nice guy, his sweet, easy relationship with his son should dispel any doubt, if there were any, to begin with. Young Jaden Smith is a fresh, new talent who is effectively unmannered in his acting and also delivers with some pretty good kid jokes.I've never had any doubts that the Fresh Prince can act. He proved that early on in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION. Will Smith was also great in ALI, and he is equally charismatic here as he unveils a focused commitment to dramatic acting. Once again, his innate likability holds him in good stead. There are moments in the film where he'll make you positively weep. Witness his performance as he and Christopher are forced to spend a night in a BART station men's room, or the fleeting look of bleakness which crosses his face when he's forced to relinquish his last five dollar bill to loan his boss cab fare, and, brilliantly depicted, the held-in-check emotions he displays in the movie's culminating moments when he finds out he just got hired (c'mon, you did know he was gonna get the gig, right?). I wouldn't be at all surprised if an Oscar nomination is in the offing.So what else can I say to convince folks to check this film out? This movie is fairly stark without being patronizing, hopeful without being saccharine. Yes, there are several patented Hollywood moments (how could there not?), but these are curtailed by Smith's awesomely gritty performance. His protagonist is a man of big smarts whose dignity, optimism, perseverance, resilience, and love for his son never flag. Chris Gardner realizes, too, that resorting to bitterness and anger isn't the answer. Instead, throughout his travails, he maintains his composure, his wits, his smile, and his warmth, qualities which inevitably carry him to the summit. This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting. I'm so glad I saw it.",4,"""He must've had some really nice pants.""",1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,7193,"['SPOILERS', 'SPOILERS', 'yes', 'more', 'SPOILERS.Stockbroker', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'real',

Actor Will Smith shines in his portrayal of a real-life, self-made investment broker in this emotionally exhausting but ultimately inspiring biopic.It's the 1981 recession, and Chris Gardner struggles to make ends meet as a self-employed medical-equipment salesman who has a family to support in San Francisco. With a stack of bone-density scanners gathering dust in his efficiency apartment kitchen, and with wife Linda (Thandie Newton) pulling double shifts at a neighborhood laundry, he can barely pay the bills. Chris spends his days shuttling his five-year-old son, Christopher, to day care (the film's title refers to Chris's constantly nagging the owner of the day-care center to correct the word's spelling on a mural there) and trying to hawk his expensive equipment to doctors and hospitals with shrinking budgets.Looking for a way out of his dead-end job, Chris spots a well-heeled businessman (Geoff Callan) parking a red Ferrari and quizzes him. ""Man, I've got two questions for you: What do you do, and how do you do it?"" The man informs him he's a stock broker with the prestigious Dean Witter Reynolds firm and that he's ""good with numbers and people.""Suddenly, Chris sees his life as it could be. Watching the men and women exiting the brokerage house, he reflects, ""They all looked so damned happy to me,"" and wonders, ""Why couldn't I look like that?"" After impressing one of the senior brokers (Brian Howe) by solving a Rubik's Cube puzzle during a taxicab ride, Chris applies for a Dean Witter internship program and lands an interview.However, all that Linda can see in Chris's decision to become a broker is a pipe dream. ""Salesman to intern is backwards,"" she protests. Unable to handle the stress of the landlord breathing down their necks for back rent, she leaves, forcing Chris to raise their son alone. As if that weren't enough, on the night before his big interview with Dean Witter, the police show up at his doorstep to arrest him for a pile of unpaid parking tickets.After spending the night in the police lockup, Chris--disheveled, wearing jeans and a tank-top undershirt--barely makes it to his interview on time. ""I could not think of a lie bizarre enough,"" he explains awkwardly to his skeptical interviewers. ""I just got out of jail for unpaid parking tickets and my wife left me."" One asks him: ""What if a man walked in here with no shirt, and I gave him a job?"" Chris replies good-naturedly: ""He must've had on some really nice pants.""Chris lands a spot in the internship program, not by bluffing his way out of the awkward situation, but through his forthright honesty and sense of humor.  However, there's a catch--the internship is unpaid and will last six months. Even after the program ends, there are no guarantees: only one intern out of twenty will be hired by the firm.Already having moved with his son into a hotel room to save money, Chris is faced with the dilemma of either trying to provide fully for his son right away or taking the chance that after a half-year he'll land a salaried position as an investment broker. Figuring that he can make rent and keep Christopher in day care if he can sell just one bone-density scanner a month after work and on weekends, he decides to go for it. (In this regard, the movie takes a little dramatic license: In Chris Gardner's real life, the internship paid a small stipend each month, and he quit his job selling the scanners when he took the internship; he was not self-employed.)But his troubles are just starting. When the IRS seizes his checking account for back taxes, Chris and his boy are evicted from their hotel room. With only the clothes on their backs, they are turned out on the streets. But whether sleeping on subways, buses, or in luncheonette booths, Chris never leaves Christopher's side or reveals a hint of discouragement.As much as The Pursuit of Happyness is the story of Chris Gardner's struggle to succeed in the business world, it's also the story of a father's love for and commitment to his child. At their lowest point--forced to spend the night sleeping on the floor of a men's room in a train station--he never lets on to his boy that their state is desperate, even as he's about to go to pieces. Much like the Roberto Benigni character in 1997's Life Is Beautiful, Chris conceals the indignity of their situation from his youngster by playing a make-believe game of hiding from cavemen and dinosaurs. The scenes between father and son are among the movie's most natural, convincing, and genuinely moving, no doubt because of the bond between Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden, who plays Christopher.At one point, while shooting hoops at a neighborhood playground, Chris realizes the power that an adult's words can have on a child. He makes a self-effacing quip, telling Christopher not to bother spending too much time working on his game because he himself was never any good at basketball, either. The boy puts down the ball and slumps in resignation. Angry at himself for his own thoughtlessness, Chris counsels his son:Don't ever let someone tell you you can't do something! Not even me!. . . .You got a dream, you gotta protect it! People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period!What makes this movie ring so true is that Chris Gardner heeds his own advice, even though he seems trapped in an inescapable maze. Constantly down but never out, he refuses to slink away and abandon his dream. His quest becomes a frantic chase: rushing to catch buses, arriving late at sales calls, picking up his son from daycare, tracking down a bone scanner that some hippies stole from him, securing a place to sleep in a homeless shelter. But homelessness is never depicted--or regarded--as more than a transient condition. And Chris Gardner is always in transit: everywhere he goes, he's running. Indeed, I believe Smith spends more screen time running than Dustin Hoffman did in the 1976 thriller Marathon Man.Unlike the anti-business messages conveyed by so many of today's movies, this film depicts the business world as gruelingly tough, but ultimately fair--even liberating. Most refreshing are the scenes showing Chris in the Dean Witter internship program. I cheered to myself as he applied his quick head for numbers, shaving seconds off ""cold calls"" by not hanging up between phone conversations and by going straight to the top of a company's contact directory rather than starting at the bottom, as is customary.In many respects, The Pursuit of Happyness reminded me of business-themed comedies from the 1980s, such as Trading Places and Working Girl, but without the bitter ""getting even with the boss"" side plots. If anything, the movie extols the productive nature of the stock market while regarding government as the parasite. While talking with a prospect who wants a retirement fund that yields high returns but low taxes, Gardner quips, ""So, basically, you don't want nobody's hands in your pockets but your own.""Italian director Gabriele Muccino--best known for his 2001 romantic comedy The Last Kiss--adapts his lighthearted style effortlessly to this somewhat weighty story, his first American film. Meanwhile, director of photography Phedon Papamichael exploits the steep streets of San Francisco and Oakland as a metaphor to capture the ups and downs of Chris's world. In the Dean Witter offices, Papamichael's camera moves left-to-right, visually conveying the business world's virtues of drive, economy, and progression. For his part, Will Smith digs deep into his dramatically demanding role, giving his most forceful performance to date. Is this really the same easy-going guy who starred in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and Men in Black?As for the real-life Chris Gardner, today he is a multi-millionaire who runs an investment firm in Chicago. Speaking about this stirring, feel-good movie (which, ironically, is at times also one of the bleakest movies I've ever seen), Gardner hailed the ability of Smith and director Muccino to capture life ""when the whole world tells you how small you are, but you see how big you really can be.""And big he is. The Pursuit of Happyness is one of the most positive and heroic portraits of a businessman that I've ever seen. The choices that Chris Gardner makes under the most trying of circumstances reveal his indomitable, optimistic resolve and character. Smith, who produced as well as starred, first seized upon the idea of making this movie after seeing an ABC ""20/20"" profile of Gardner. ""Chris represents the American Dream,"" he remarked. ""The promise of America is such a great idea. Nowhere else in the world could a Chris Gardner exist.""And, I might add, nowhere else in the world could a movie honoring a Chris Gardner exist.",5,Life of a Salesman,1179619200,"05 20,

1054247,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B000N6U0DS,Irfan A. Alvi,"[2, 2]","First, let me just quickly say that the acting, plot construction, scenery, and other standard elements are very good in this movie.  There are no significant flaws which threaten to ruin the movie.Turning to the story itself, as most people know, this movie is ""inspired by a true story"" involving a man who faces enormous financial hardships, to the point where he and his son wind up homeless.  The problems he encounters are so relentless that it becomes almost too painful to watch.  But he's gifted at math, has good interpersonal skills, and works incredibly hard, so he eventually winds up with a nice job in a San Francisco financial firm, and later goes on to start his own firm and become a multi-millionaire.A story like this will naturally appeal to an American audience because it taps in to the meritocratic notion that the American dream is accessible to most of us if we're willing to work hard and make sacrifices.  But we can question how much this moving and inspiring story can really serve as a model for the masses.  I would say not much.  In a country of 300 million people, you'll always be able to find stories like this, but they're the exception, not the norm, and of course that's what makes this story worthy of a movie.  Moreover, the main character clearly had abilities and a work ethic far beyond the norm, so it took very special strengths to prevail over such especially bad luck.  But I do think this story illustrates the upper limits of what's possible, and most people can draw the lesson that working hard will still provide at least some benefit, even if the benefit falls short of one's ultimate dreams.Another lesson which is perhaps equally important is that children may value and need our love and attention more than the material resources we can provide.  That's certainly the case in this story, and I suspect that this can be generalized to most children.  Something to consider for dads (and moms) who are preoccupied with putting in long hours away from home in order to make a lot of money ...Highly recommended to anyone looking for an uplifting story, even if few people can replicate an ending as happy as this one.",5,"Moving and inspiring, even if nonreplicable",1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,2172,"['First', 'let', 'just', 'quickly', 'say', 'acting', 'plot', 'construction', 'scenery', 'other', 'standard', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'significant', 'flaws', 'threaten', 'ruin', 'movie.Turning', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'movie', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'involving', 'man', 'who', 'enormous', 'financial', 'hardships', 'point', 'where', 'son', 'wind', 'up', 'homeless', 'problems', 'are', 'so', 'relentless', 'almost', 'too', 'painful', 'watch', 'gifted', 'math', 'good', 'interpersonal', 'skills', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'eventually', 'up', 'nice', 'job', 'San', 'Francisco', 'financial', 'firm', 'later', 'start', 'own', 'firm', 'become', 'multi-millionaire.A', 'story', 'will', 'naturally', 'appeal', 'American', 'audience', 'meritocratic', 'notion', 'American', 'dream', 'accessible', 'most', ""'re"", 'willing', 'work', 'hard', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'can', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'story', 'can', 'really', 'serve', 'model', 'masses', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'much', 'country', '300', 'million', 'people', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'stories', ""'re"", 'exception', 'not', 'norm', 'course', 'what', 'story', 'worthy', 'movie', 'Moreover', 'main', 'character', 'clearly', 'had', 'abilities', 'work', 'ethic', 'far', 'norm', 'took', 'very', 'special', 'strengths', 'prevail', 'such', 'especially', 'bad', 'luck', 'do', 'think', 'story', 'upper', 'limits', 'what', 'possible', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'draw', 'lesson', 'working', 'hard', 'will', 'still', 'provide', 'least', 'benefit', 'even', 'benefit', 'short', 'one', 'ultimate', 'dreams.Another', 'lesson', 'perhaps', 'equally', 'important', 'children', 'may', 'value', 'need', 'love', 'attention', 'more', 'material', 'resources', 'can', 'provide', 'certainly', 'case', 'story', 'suspect', 'can', 'be', 'generalized', 'most', 'children', 'Something', 'consider', 'dads', 'moms', 'who', 'are', 'preoccupied', 'putting', 'long', 'hours', 'away', 'home', 'order', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'looking', 'uplifting', 'story', 'even', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'replicate', 'ending', 'as', 'happy', 'one']",N/A

The way the story is told is very realistic; Charles Gardner deals with the same problems that so many of us have gone through. I have enjoyed seeing Will Smith's previous films, but this one made the biggest impression on me. Perhaps it is because of the fact that the boy in the film (Christopher) is actually his own son (Jaden), so their acting together is all the more effective. Whatever the reason, however, Smith's performance here is stronger than that seen in I, Robot, Independence Day, Hitch, or Men in Black, and greatly deserves a notable award for his effort. I especially liked the scene where Chris must take shelter in the men's room with his son at the subway station. It is moving, to say the least. At the end of the movie, we are told that the real Chris Gardner is now a respected millionaire. Perhaps it's a result of the enduring love for his child that motivated him to become who he is today? This movie will teach you what it means to be a good father.

1054249,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000N6U0DS,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","We are not used to seeing Will Smith playing the father taking care of his son alone. Especially in his world under Reagan. He lost his wife, then his apartment, then a second apartment, then he had to go to homeless people's shelters, with his son mind you, sleep in BART toilets, with his son mind you, work like hell to get a new profession in the world of finance, go on selling some of the medical machines he was selling before to just make ends meet, to avoid the worst possible, losing his child, his son. And he manages to keep his cool, to remain friendly with everyone, even those who obviously exploit him, and he proves himself and he gets the job, one out of twenty. The whole film is dominated by a quotation from the Declaration of Independence, the ""pursuit of happyness"". And this pursuit is a real chase but a chase that does not so much take place outside, because outside it is a hunt not for happiness but for the game that is homeless, defenseless, out of luck and deprived of the minimum. But the chase, and the pursuit, is in one's mind first and foremost. If you are not free in your mind, if you have no project and if you do not have the motivation and the determination to get it going, you will not overcome the difficulties life will bring. Though I think this is true for everyone, that motivation and determination are the basic qualities you need to get anywhere in life, the end result will be quite different and vary a lot according to the point where you started and the opportunities that will come along across your own path and that you will be able to catch. We definitely are equal potentially, but the end results of people in their lives vary tremendously and then at this point equality is no longer the main characteristic.

1054250,A1Y7PVYQ9NOHLB,B000N6U0DS,Jake,"[2, 3]","Man, the Fresh Prince has come a long way. Here he simply shines as Chris Gardner, a down on his luck dad trying to make ends meet in San Francisco in the 80's. When Chris' wife leaves him, he is forced to take care of his son (played by Smith's real life son Jaden), all the while struggling to keep from going under financially. Gardner then lands a dream job as an intern for a major stockbroker firm, only to find out it is a non-paying position. He must come out on top in the program if he hopes to land a paying gig. Meanwhile, Chris and his son are forced to live on the streets.This film is based on the true story of Chris Gardner and how he, quite literally, started at the bottom and worked his way up. This a classic story about not giving up and fighting for what you want. This is possibly Will Smith's strongest role to date, and his performance is exceptional. Smith brings Gardner's story to life. A story that is full of heartache, despair, darkness, and most importantly...hope. I'll admit this is a tough one to watch..especially for parents. One of the most heart-breaking scenes is when Chris and his son are forced to spend the night in a subway bathroom. As the movie goes on you will find yourself asking the question: How much can one man take?  But if you stick around until the end you will be touched and inspired. Hard to watch? Sure. Worth it?

1054251,A2EDRZBKY4QPZ,B000N6U0DS,"James G. Greenhill ""Jim Greenhill""","[2, 2]","Will Smith, as Chris Gardner, and Jaden Smith, as his son Christopher, give outstanding performances in this inspiring movie based on the true story of a man who kept getting up when life knocked him down and overcame adversity to find success and, more important, ""happyness.""Gardner never loses his bearing. He never complains. Never makes excuses. He never blames other people, his hard circumstances or bad luck. The words ""if only"" never once come out of his mouth. He holds on to his vision. He keeps his priorities -- his son and being a good parent -- straight. He cannot control the big outcome that he wants, but he can control how he reacts to what's happening right now, and that's the key to fulfilling his vision. Because he makes good small choices more often than not, he ultimately finds what he's looking for. He has stamina, persistance and stubbornness. There are no guarantees any of it will get him what he wants, but he chooses to keep trying.Gardner doesn't always make perfect choices (bone density scanners?) but he also doesn't add to his burdens by making rotten choices such as escapism, sitting in a depressed heap watching TV for hours every night, chain smoking, drowning his miseries each evening at the local bar or developing a drug habit.The key moment is when Gardner goes out of his way to apologize for being late for a meeting. Though he still faces struggles, this is the turning point. It's this action that sets him apart -- not this specific action, but the fact that he does this kind of thing when few others would. His choice to make the apology results in an accumulation of opened doors that helps him save himself.All of this rings true to real life which -- given that it's based on the true story of a man who had it even harder than the movie version -- is because it is real life.Strengths of the movie include that it shows how thin the line is between shelter, food, warmth and comfort for so many people and homelessness and serious challenges without getting preachy, whiny or political. It shows how slight the safety net is. And its strengths include the high value the movie places on being a responsible parent.Gardner is out for financial success, there's no doubt about that -- but the movie never suggests that this goal is any more important to him than being a good father and having a loving relationship with his child. The relationship between father and son is beautifully portrayed by the Smiths.Another of the movie's strengths is that nothing is overplayed. When Gardner finds some success, he almost cries -- but he doesn't actually cry. The moment is played just right.This movie is about how one man confronts the actual hard challenge of life and how the choices he makes help him succeed.

1054255,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000N6U0DS,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 5]","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" tells the story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a lower middle class black man whose dream of prosperity is evaporating. He and his wife invested heavily in a portable bone densitometer, but sales are horrible and the family is just a step ahead of eviction. Slowly but surely, Chris loses nearly everything, until he is left almost literally with nothing but his young son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) and the clothes on his back. By luck, he connects with a group of E.F. Hutton employees and starts a long and uncertain trip out of his predicament.The film does a phenomenal job of communicating just how difficult it can be to rise from the margins, even if one is talented and ambitious. Gardner must feed and house his son while studying for a soul-crushing investment exam, showing up to work fresh every day and managing child care. The difficulties he faces are enormous and daunting, and would have deterred many a less hardy soul.Spoilers ahead.But from a filmic perspective, there were problems. How many close calls can a viewer endure without getting irritated? And using the name of a real investment firm pretty much gives away the ending. Then too, there was the lack of emotional intensity between the characters, with the exception of Jaden, who was delightful and real throughout. One had to wonder as well about the likelihood that a man who washed himself in subway bathrooms could be fresh -- both mentally and aromatically - every day for months. And without once cutting corners in the childcare area.""Pursuit of Happiness"" is a fine movie that depicts the experience of individuals who are dogged about achieving their dreams. But it does so at the cost of its own integrity, shortchanging the damage that such a pursuit, no matter how well-motivated, has on those around them. By the end of the film, I was unconvinced by Chris Gardner's sterling character and mistrustful of the depiction of his money-grubbing dream as worthy of his efforts.",3,"Too many setbacks, too small a dream",1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2008,"['Pursuit', 'Happiness', 'story', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'black', 'man', 'dream', 'prosperity', 'evaporating', 'wife', 'invested', 'heavily', 'portable', 'bone', 'densitometer', 'sales', 'are', 'horrible', 'family', 'just', 'step', 'ahead', 'eviction', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'Chris', 'nearly', 'everything', 'left', 'almost', 'literally', 'nothing', 'young', 'son', 'played', 'Smith', 'real-life', 'son', 'Jaden', 'clothes', 'back', 'luck', 'group', 'E.F.', 'Hutton', 'employees', 'long', 'uncertain', 'trip', 'predicament.The', 'film', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'communicating', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'rise', 'margins', 'even', 'one', 'talented', 'ambitious', 'Gardner', 'must', 'feed', 'house', 'son', 'studying', 'soul-crushing', 'investment', 'exam', 'showing', 'up', 'work', 'fresh', 'day', 'managing', 'child', 'care', 'difficulties', 'are', 'enormous', 'daunting', 'would', 'have', 'deterred', 'many', 'less', 'hardy', 'soul.Spoilers', 'ahead.But', 'filmic', 'perspective', 'were', 'problems', 'How', 'many', 'close', 'calls', 'can', 'viewer', 'endure', 'getting', 'irritated', 'using', 'name', 'real', 'investment', 'firm', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'ending', 'Then', 'too', 'was', 'lack', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'characters', 'exception', 'Jaden', 'who', 'was', 'delightful', 'real', 'One', 'had', 'wonder', 'as', 'well', 'likelihood', 'man', 'who', 'washed', 'subway', 'bathrooms', 'could', 'be', 'fresh', 'mentally', 'aromatically', 'day', 'months', 'once', 'cutting', 'corners', 'childcare', 'area', 'Pursuit', 'Happiness', 'fine', 'movie', 'experience', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'dogged', 'achieving', 'dreams', 'so', 'cost', 'own', 'integrity', 'shortchanging', 'damage', 'pursuit', 'matter', 'how', 'well-motivated', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'unconvinced', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'sterling', 'character', 'mistrustful', 'depiction', 'money-grubbing', 'dream', 'worthy', 'efforts']",N/A

His natural rapport with his son is in no way one-sided; Jaden Smith is believable and very charming. Certainly, the audience can feel secure that Chris Gardner, the main character, will succeed in some fashion or else a film would never have been based on his autobiography, but the simple, sentimental score, well-written screenplay, subtle direction and, above all, Will Smith's acting make us strive with Gardner, cry with him, and hurt with him.Gardner's tale is like ""Die Hard"" for the masses; he has to endure being arrested, being evicted, fighting for a bed at the homeless shelter, trying to keep appointments and to study while holding down two full-time jobs with no car, sprinting all over San Francisco, attempting to keep himself and his son clean--it just does not stop. Watch Smith's face during the film--he shows us a man who only just manages to fend off despair. He bleeds and weeps because of the injustice in the world, with disappointment at how his potential has been wasted, with the weight of all his past failures, and with worry for his son. But he clings to the path he has chosen in the belief that it will lead him from this torment. One can actually see the dead look in Smith's eyes, the punch-drunk expression of one who is suffering, who is juggling so many burdens that his mind spills over with the effort, for whom a seemingly minor setback is a Big Deal. Smith gets it, and he makes us get it, too.Incidentally, he could probably have been a stuntman or a professional athlete. He has had running scenes in many of his films to date, and in this movie he looks ready to set a new record for the 400 meters. Smith is a little too fit and energetic for a homeless guy who hardly sleeps and eats in a soup kitchen for much of the movie, but his running and carrying feats illustrate Gardner's bulldog tenacity, and how his own physical power and endurance aided him in achieving his ends. All I have to say is this movie is one of the best this year. I couldn't believe how good Will Smith did in this film. I also couldn't imagine a bone density scanner salesman lived a part of his life this way. Sleeping in a bathroom at a Subway station! On top of toilet paper!

Capitalism however is a term created by Karl Marx, who ridiculously believed that the benefits of free-enterprise only go towards the rich.Some idiots have already rung in with ridiculous assessments, such as one who claims that according to this movie, money is happiness, but if that's the case, then why didn't Chris Gardner abandon his son, since according to the reviewer, he would have been happier that way.  Happiness is a subjective thing.  Part of the reason Chris Gardner pursued the job of a stock-broker is so that he could create a better life for his son.  By far the most idiotic claim comes from toddo however who says:""The American dream in this movie is one of the false values this society actively promotes. Don't fall for it!""Does toddo believe that the pursuit of misery, suffering, death, and destruction, are the real,  true values that are society should pursue instead.  Did you, toddo, cry not out of happiness but sadness when the Berlin Wall fell or when you heard that Pol Pot had been slain.  Let us all return to the Dark Ages while we're at it.  Or does toddo believe that otherss subjective happiness is not his subjective happiness and therefore that they must be wrong.The movie itself is heart-warming and slightly funny at times.  Chris Gardner is a  member of the proletariat, working hard to pull himself up out of poverty.  He is hardly some greedy, shallow, materialistic, monster, but rather a hard-working man who uses his head, pays attention to and acts on opportunities, and even makes a big risk at one point, which at first flops but creates something useful when he follows up on it.  It also portrays a big successful businessman whom he meets as an extraordinarily friendly businessman and kindly father himself.  Chris Gardner goes through hell, at one point even sleeping with his son in the bathroom of a subway restroom, crying as his son is asleep with someone knocking on the door.  Then don't reveal much about what happened when he got the job, which is its one drawback, but still the facial expression employed by Will Smith at the made me completely forget that this guy played a goofball from Phillly on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

1054260,A3MF0IQNNXUOPD,B000N6U0DS,Jerrold Zayac,"[1, 4]","I hate to go against the wind here, but this movie was too tense, too extreme. This movie reminded me of the tribulations of Job in the Bible. The movie's portrayal Chris Gardner's pain and hardships never ended until the final 5 minutes of the movie.Was this ""really how it was"", this extreme. So many questions: Questions like how did he afford to pay for the childcare expenses when he had no income, yet had to stay at a shelter? Did he really have to leave work early to pick up his child at daycare in an attempt to get to the shelter before it closed at five o'clock?More obvious questions like: Why would he allow his child to go thru such foreseeable hardships when he is offered a reprieve from the boys mother. Let her take him for awhile, at least until he's established enough with an income and a place to live. No, instead, he just says, ""you know you can't take care of him"", so she leaves, no contact with the child for presumably at least 6 months.One obstacle after another, ninety minutes of being abused, humiliated, degraded, all while caring for a five-year child.  This was like water torture having to watch the pain one man is enduring. However, I couldn't help but think was his misfortunes time and time again overdone, way overdone. Did he really have his 5-year-old child with him while he had no income for six months and lived in various shelters?  Was his income really completely dependent upon selling medical equipment that nobody wanted, and that two were taken from him, which he did recover after great misfortune. Were the horrendous misfortunes, one after another really true? If they were, how did he not go insane?  Well, it turns out no. Most of it was made up-""Hollywoodized'.  In real life, things were not as bad as portrayed in the movie, thank goodness. The greatest problem encountered by Will Smiths character in the movie was that he was not given a salary while training at Dean Witter. So his only source of income was selling his last few pieces of medical equipment. This was not enough to sustain him and his son in any stable housing, which lead him to seek out various shelters. Well, after doing a little research about the real Chris Gardner, it appears most of what was portrayed in the movie is not true; it's a greatly fictionalized account. He was given a stipend at Dean Witter of $1000 a month while training, and most important he didn't' have his child with him while he was training with them, so all the rushing to shelters before five o'clock with his son didn't happen. So many examples of the truth being stretched to make a more compelling drama, but for me, it was way overboard.  Mr. Gardner's true-life story is a very compelling one. I have not read his book, only synopsis of it.  However one thing about his true life is apparent, he was not a Saint, yet the movie goes out of its way to almost portray him as one. He is not a bad man either. He is just a man, a man who had many hardships and disadvantages in his life, all of which he did overcome and become a great success. As stated however, the movie seems to want to go out of it's way to show a Saintly genius, one with the ability to overcoming one tragedy after another, endure more one pain, one more humiliation, one more unbelievable mishap after another, all the way to the last five minutes of the movie. Then, only in the last one-minute of the movie, right before the ending credits do we read a few lines that now he is a millionaire. Everything's ok.

I suppose those brainwashed with marxist anti-Americanism will see this film as proof that American society makes us all homeless and starving to death; while the rest of us will see it as a testement that hard work can get you to places you never thought possible. Will Smith is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He's real in almost everything he does. You trust that he feels for the characters he plays; there is no exception to this film.

The trouble is, there's only a miniscule chance of that -- Gardner is competing with dozens of other hopefuls, among whom only one will be selected to stay with the firm.To compound matters, Gardner's wife has just left him, sick of the couple's financial woes. He has custody of their young son Christopher, which brings him comfort -- and panic, when he is evicted from his apartment and ends up homeless. Gardner quickly learns that there aren't many resources for homeless fathers in 1980s California -- there are shelters for men, and shelters for women and children. No one seems to care about single fathers.Nonetheless, Gardner does his best to hold onto Christopher, convinced that their luck will turn as soon as he's able to complete his internship and land the job. He's also determined not to let anyone know his circumstances, studying in the shelter by the light from outside, and taking care to appear in fresh, clean suits every day.In the light of many movies today -- violent, stupid-funny, or a just plain waste of $10 and 90 minutes -- ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was a wonderful treat!

Chris Gardener tells his son that he'll probably be good at a lot of things in life, but he'll probably be lousy at basketball just like he was. And in an instant, you can see the joy draining out of his son's eyes. Gardener realizes what he just told his son and says something truly amazing, ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can do - not even me. People like to tell you that you can't do something because they can't. If you want something in this world, go out and get it...""How many of us had big, huge dreams as a kid and then somebody (usually someone very close and dear to us) told us to be ""realistic""? And so we grow up...supposedly...and we forget about those dreams, those wishes, those visions we had when we were younger and we get into jobs that we hate only because it pays the bills and keeps a roof over our head and puts food on the table but deep down in our gut we know that we ""sold out"".This movie inspired me greatly. It made me look at what I really want in my life in every area. It made me realize that age is nothing but a number and it's okay to have dreams and visions. Gardener did. Even when it looked at though he ""lost"" everything he still had the love and the admiration of his devoted son, and that love propelled him to new heights because that is what love does. It also got me to forgive my dad for a lot of things he told me growing up as a kid. I know he was only trying to keep me safe and not get hurt by having outlandish dreams of what I wanted to be, do, and have because in many ways, he gave up his dreams by raising a family. I don't know if it was a sacrafice, but he defintely renounced certain things in order to put food on the table and clothes on our backs.This movie filled me to overflowing with joyful tears at the end.

His family life is in shambles and he is really going nowhere with a son who is caught between Gardner and his ex.  Gardner thinks about an opportunity he hears of working for an investment firm as an intern and he goes for it.He faces many challenges while attempting to even get into the program, where only one person of all who go through it are selected.  The premise of the movie, is that we in the USA have the right to pursue happiness.  It is not a given.  Carter worked to pursue what would make him happy and this movie is even a way to give back.You will see some of the actual areas where Carter actually operated, even the homeless shelter is the actual one where he stayed eeking out a living.  (The DVDs features will tell you a whole lot more about that that is even touching just by itself.)This is a movie about winning in life, and mostly, not giving up when things seem the worst.

They have something that tells about ourselves and things we can relate to. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is the most inspirational film of 2006. Not only because we understand and care about the main characters, but also there is an important message which is to follow your dreams no matter what. The road might be difficult--maybe to the point of despair--but if you finish the journey, your life will change forever.Story:The movie starts in San Francisco in early 1980s. Family man Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is going through difficult financial problems. He is an unsuccessful salesman who struggles everyday trying to sell a medical machine--bigger than a microwave oven--that not many doctors want. He carries one everyday. Unfortunately, his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) doesn't make much money either. They have a five-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith) who Chris takes to a day care center everyday. Things go from bad to worse; the money they make is not enough to sustain them. Chris sees an opportunity, he wants to become a stock broker and gets an internship, but there is no pay until he is chosen. Linda cannot stand the poverty they live in and decides to leave him for good. Chris wants to stay with his son in San Francisco, she doesn't fight back. Now he has to take care of him and pursuit a dream to become a stock broker and leave the poverty they are in. ""Will"" he make it?Review:A compelling film, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" follows the old dramatic underdog formula that most of us are used to by now, but it's done correctly this time around because you really care about the main character. In other words, Will's performance is what makes this movie great. We see Chris going through a lot of problems, not only economically but emotionally as well. Linda is sick and tired of dealing with all his issues--she is a mean and unlikable character to say the least--and poor little Christopher is always asking questions. These situations create moments of despair to Chris throughout the film. Although it seems for moments that the whole city is against him, Will Smith's character never gives up his hopes. He is smart, likable and persuasive--he is also excellent at the 80s famous Rubik's cube which gives the audience a feeling of how smart this guy is. He sends the right message to the audience of what he is about.We appreciate the credibility and realism of this film due to great photography and costume design--the look and feel of the subway scenes are excellent. These elements give us the impression that we are back in the 80s. There are some moments where the movie drags a bit and it might feel soapy for some, but those small little flaws do not affect the final product.The Verdict:Probably an Oscar contender for best actor, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a touchy film that gives us lessons of perseverance, love and the American dream. Great acting, inspiring story, and the survival factor make the film one of the best dramas of 2006.

You might pass her on the street without a second glance, which I think freed up something in Newton, allowing her to do some of her very best work here.  Of course she has a thankless part because nobody cares about her anyhow, as everyone has pointed out.  It's sort of like the way Meryl Streep is treated in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, except here she doesn't even get to come back at the end, not even a phone call to let her boy know she made it safely to New York.Am I the only one who watched all the extras to this movie and tried in vain to find out what happened to the little boy?

Hope I'm not putting my foot in my mouth, but I'm curious.When Chris sells his bone scanning machine to the kindly doctor, he cashes his check at Ted's Market, which is on my block South of Market here in San Francisco.

The viewer basically lives out the struggles of a man with not much more than street smarts and a high school diploma to get him, his girlfriend, and son through life.  Fed up with the life Gardner provides, his wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him and (reluctantly) their son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) for the greener pastures of New York.  Determined to make it in San Francisco, Gardner takes a non-paying internship with Dean Witter and has to rely on his dwindling and hard-to-sell stock of bone density scanners to put food on the table.  Needless to say, Gardner and his son face immense hardships, eventually being forced to live on the street, staying in a public bathroom and shelters in order to survive.The story's outcome is wonderful and heartwarming.  I'm not ashamed to say that this film made me cry.

The ""making of"" documentary is a ""must see"" after you've watched the movie.  The mini documentary on the Rubics Cube is great too!Second, something some may not notice that I did was the painstaking attention to detail in reproducing the early 1980's.  (This was mentioned in the ""making of"" documentary)  When we see scenes taken outside where there is a lot of traffic, I saw many cars but not one that was after 1981.  All the appliances, electronic devices, and other set decorations took me right back to about 1980.  Quite amazing.  Way more work went into this movie that you'd expect.This movie shows what the opposite of cynicism looks like.  And, it gave me something to really think about.  Maybe it's the persuit of ""happyness"" that makes life worthwhile, as much or more than being ""happy"".Finally, I very much appreciated the fact that the story was ethnically neutral, for lack of a better term.  What I mean is that the situation Chris Gardner found himself in could have happened to anyone regardless of background.

His girlfriend/wife (I've heard both, and the movie never makes it clear) is working double shifts to support the two of them and their son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  Chris, meanwhile, is working as hard has he can to sell bone density machines.  He's already bought them, so he needs to sell them to get his life savings back.One day, he happens to meet a successful stock broker.  Chris is fascinated by the wealth this guy has, so he begins to pursue it as a new career, not knowing all the stress that is involved.  He learns of an internship offered by Dean Witter, and tries to get into the program despite his lack of formal education.Meanwhile, his life is going downhill.  His landlord is tired of waiting for the rent and his wife decides to leave for New York.  Can he balance being a single dad with a spot in this competitive internship?The first strike against the movie is the trailer.  That's right.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen this movie.  I half expected that when I went to see it, so that's not my main complaint.I went to the film expecting an inspiring true story.  I got a true story.  While the theme ""If you work hard, you can accomplish anything"" does come out, the movie focuses on all the struggles.  It got depressing long before the end with very little to balance it out.And, of course, there are Chris's actions.  While I did spend most of the film rooting for him to succeed, there were times it was hard.  He risked too much since he had to care for his son.  And he didn't seem to be able to keep track of his machines either.What I can't fault is Will Smith's performance.  He is a powerful actor who does an excellent job bringing Chris to life.  Jaden Smith does a decent job playing the son, he good but certainly not the next big child star.

Gardner knows he cannot support his son for long by continuing in his profession, so he displays that plucky American entrepreneurial spirit and enters a cutthroat competition to become a high paid executive at a financial institution. The competition is basically a full-time, six-month internship with no pay, during which time Gardner must outperform the other competitors.Meanwhile, Gardner must raise his son alone and still sell medical equipment to support them.

But thankfully, as he's getting older, he's turning to different roles in the last few years, there's been Ali (which I haven't seen, but read some good reviews) and this. (We'll exclude Hitch completely.)Pursuit of Happyness is based on a true story, about a period in a man's life, where absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong, does go wrong. I've kinda been on a downer the past couple of days and this is the perfect movie to help you along if you're in that kinda mood, and I topped my mood off even worse by watching the last couple of discs of the final ever seaon of Quantum Leap. Thoroughly depressed? You bet.Will plays Chris Gardner absolutely brilliantly, and it's a role he's never really done before. I was so involved in the movie that I forgot to even look out for Dan Castellaneta (Homer in the Simpsons) - clue: he asks Chris for a donut! It's a truly heart wrenching story, and I was nearly in tears at some points, from having to bunk down for the night in a men's toilets, to having all the money taken from his account in one swoop. His wife walks out on him, leaving with a five year old son (who's Will's real life son), he's selling something that is probably unsellable, he gets arrested for unpaid traffic tickets, and just when he thinks nothing else can happen, it does.The way this film depicts poverty in America looks extremely accurate and gut wrenchingly honest. It hurts to watch it, but then the movie is enriched by the fact the two actors playing father & son are actually father & son, and it's a great chemistry and bond between them, but must have been hard for Jaden at some points, particularly when he has to be yelled at. He's quite the little scene stealer isn't he? But then so was the old guy who thought the x-ray machine thing was a time machine. He was hilarious, I wanted to see more of him.It's a truly magical movie, and I won't give too much more away than I already have.

Determined to not give up, Gardner endures homelessness and ends up pursuing an internship for a stockbroker position at a major Wall Street investment firm. Despite the trials and tribulations Gardner went through, not only due to the lack of a roof over his head but also the hard work related to his internship and even an IRS seizure of his money to boot, Gardner's endurance and hard work pays off.The movie, and I am sure the book, is a testament to how anyone can get themselves out of poverty and become wealthy with hard work, persistence  and determination.

1054321,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000N6U0DS,mirasreviews,"[49, 52]","""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is an unabashed tearjerker about the American Dream and commitment to family in the face of great odds. It was inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, who spent some time in the 1980s homeless while trying to care for his young son and make it through a stockbroker internship. The film is fictionalized but stays true to Gardner's struggle for success and dedication to his son. Gardner's autobiography, which goes by the same title, was actually published after the film was written. In San Francisco, 1981, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) can't make ends meet selling portable bone density scanners, while his embittered wife Linda (Thandie Newton) waitresses 2 shifts a day. Chris spies a man with an enviable sportscar on the street one day and asks him what he does for a living. He's a stockbroker. So Chris decides that's what he'll be. He must be at the top of his class after 6 months in Dean Witter's competitive internship program to be hired. Meanwhile, Chris has no wife, no money, no paying job, and a 5-year old son (Jaden Smith).A story of hardship and hard work, paternal love and frustration, could easily be too saccharine for words. It's saved from this fate by Chris Gardner's desperation. Behind his indomitable pluck, Gardner is truly desperate. He has no money, no home, uncertain prospects, and the responsibility of providing for a young child. He hides his circumstances from his colleagues. He's spends an inordinate amount of energy chasing errant bone scanners around town. He compromises his ethics. His single-mindedness eventually takes a toll on his son. Chris is struggling for his life. And his financial problems are something the audience can understand and may themselves fear. That's why ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" works so well. Credit is due Will Smith's Oscar-nominated performance and Italian director Gabriele Muccino's understanding of intense emotions painted with small strokes.The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 4 featurettes, the song ""I Can"" by Bebe Winans and Dave Koz (5 min, audio), and a feature commentary. ""Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American Dream"" (17 min) interviews Gabriele Muccino, Will Smith, and the producers about choosing Muccino to direct. Muccino talks about filming in San Francisco and working in English. ""Father and Son: On Screen and Off"" (7 min) recounts casting Jaden Smith after auditioning hundreds of other children, and Will Smith talks about working with his son. ""The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner"" (12 min) interviews Gardner about his participation in the film, and Will Smith talks about learning from him. ""Inside the Rubik's Cube"" (6 min) is a fun short documentary on the persistent popularity of the Cube. There is a nice audio commentary by director Gabriele Muccino, in English. Muccino tells us how he got the job, discusses themes, recreating the 1980s, Will Smith's trust, locations, and some technical details.

Also, at the end, when you saw the ""riches"",  I felt such joy, relief, and true HAPPINESS for him.  I felt like a parent watching their child struggle for years on something, and then finally achieving their goal.  I was so encouraged by his strength.

Chris is a smart, capable guy, but he's gotten himself into a bad situation. He sunk his life savings into selling bone density scanners, which don't seem to be moving very quickly. And his girlfriend Linda (played by Thandie Newton, looking as bad as a person that gorgeous can look), who's been working double shifts to make ends meet, gets fed up. She's going to leave him and take the kid, but Chris won't let her. So she leaves him AND the kid. Here's where things get interesting. In an effort to better their situation, Chris applies for a competitive broker internship. He's learned that out of a pool of 20 interns, only one will be offered a job at the end of the six-month program. He gets the internship. Problem? It's unpaid.So, Chris has to start selling some scanners, FAST. He has moderate success, but there are still times when the father/son team is living pretty close to the bone. During some scenes, such as when the little family finds itself homeless for a while, I almost cried. These are the kinds of characters I can root for. Chris is doing everything possible to keep body and soul together and make a future for himself and his son. And sometimes, it still isn't enough. But the guy just won't give up. He powers through the worst of circumstances. He puts a brave face on for his kid. He keeps his wits about him. He doesn't cave. You gotta love a guy like that.Will Smith is great in this. He must have gotten in awesome shape, too, because he spends alot of the movie in a flat-out run. (Talk about hustle.) And Jaden is adorable. His sweet, soft little-boy face. His good nature. His ultimate trust in his dad (on screen and off). A totally effortless performance, it was perfect for this movie. You will love this kid.I recommend The Pursuit of Happyness.

1054334,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000N6U0DS,Olukayode Balogun,"[4, 4]","It could be said that this is a movie about a number of things: The pursuit of the American dream, never giving up, and that if you are prepared to do whatever it takes, you can probably achieve anything. I think it also hints at the question of whether money, success and power can ever bring happiness in themselves but, wisely, it's a question the movie leaves largely unanswered.For me though, this movie is about a man who has an absolute and unwavering love for, and commitment to, his young son. As a man who didn't have a good relationship with his father in the past and doesn't have one at all in the present, I found the movie painfully difficult, yet exhilaratingly beautiful to watch. If more black men (or maybe even men in general) were this committed to their sons, I remember thinking, this world would be a very different place.The movie is based on the real-life story of the real-life Chris Gardner, a bright and talented San Francisco man who falls on bad times, suffers the breakdown of his relationship with his wife and eventually winds up homeless. Thandie Newton gives a strong performance as the waspish shrew of a wife who eventually naffs off and leaves Chris to it. (Well, to be fair to her, she did want to take the child with her but Chris put his foot down). Through all the struggles that follow, Chris always has his son at his side and this is the heart of the story.Though this is probably my favourite Will Smith performance since 1998's ""Enemy Of The State"" (and a performance that has earned Mr Smith a Best Actor Oscar nomination), for me it's his son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, who is the real star of this movie. For a first-timer, he gives a barnstorming, heartwrenching perfomance. And he's such a cutie too. I've become a hardened, jaded, unfeeling and cynical old man over the years and hardly anything touches me anymore but this movie, I felt. This one made me cry. I cried the first time I watched it and I cried even more when I watched it a second time. I can't wait for the DVD. I don't know what it is, but this movie has something special. If you haven't seen it already, I urge you to do so. Inspirational on so many levels. The real Chris Gardner makes a brief cameo appearance towards the end of the movie which just wraps it up beautifully.How come no soundtrack though?

1054342,A2UO4Y0063LNBX,B000N6U0DS,"R. C. Harris Jr. ""Norway""","[2, 5]","To direct this movie, Will Smith hand-picked Italian director Gabriele Muccino, whose previous two films Will had seen and was greatly impressed with. This was to be Muccino's first English-speaking movie, and his first time directing non-Italian speaking people.The result is Will's best performance in any film yet. Will himself (in the ""Making Persuit"" fetaurette on this DVD) proclaims this film as his greatest achievement to date.I have to agree that choosing a European director was a very wise choice. It gives the film a realism and a point of view that would have been hard to find in a Hollywood director. Muccino's saw this as an ""American dream"" come true story, and how a father-son relationship should be.The final scene, showing Gardner's final interview with the Big Bosses including his reaction once he gets outside the building, was possibly the most touching moment I have ever seen in a movie. His expression and reaction was so real, so emotional I couldn't help but cry with him for joy and for his pain through the journey. The perfect choice to end the film.Extras:# Father and Son: Onscreen and OffThis is a great introduction to Will's son, Jaden. It shows that the filmmakers were reluctant to consider him at first. It was only after testing thousand of boys in three weeks (and not being happy with any of them) that director Gabriele Muccino asked the other producers if they thought it would be ok to audition Will's son. Jaden blew the other kids out of the water in the tests and the chemistry between him and Will made their relationship on film all the more real.# The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris GardnerThis is a short featurette (8-9 minutes) with clips from an interview with the real Chris Gardner. It was interesting to learn that the real Reverend who ran the outreach center where Chris and his son stayed a few nights, Rev. Cecil Williams, played himself in the film. Chris Gardner insisted on it! The location was also the real place. Chris said that without Cecil Williams, thousands of San Fransisco's homeless (including Gardner) would be in desperate trouble or even dead. We also learn that the subway-bathroom where Chris and son spend a night was an exact replica of the real one. We learn that the director insisted they use real homeless people as extras to play many of the homeless! And many other interesting facts.# Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American DreamThis is where we learn the most about the choice of Gabriele Muccino as director. A fantastic featurette documenting the making of the film, specifically experienced from a first-time English-speaking-movie director. Imagine directing actors and a crew in your second or third language and not being able to express your thoughts or ideas very well because you don't know the words! Fascinating how he pulled it off!# Inside the Rubik's CubeA short featurette (under 6-7 mins) about the rubics cube. It was invented by a Hungarian. In the 80's 1 out of 4 households had one. The HUGE success helped bring Hungary out of communism. And more history. Also a bit about ""cubing"" today.# ""I Can"" Song (audio only)A song written for the film, but not used in the theatrical release. Nice, but hard to *only* listen to a song (without seeing video attached) since this is a dvd.# Audio commentary with director Gabriele MuccinoCommentaries are some of my favorite features on DVD's. But they are either hit or miss. This one was very good! Muccino starts off explaining how he got involved with the film (hand-picked by Will Smith) and his initial meetings with Will where they discussed their visions for the story. He described some of the challenges directing such a HUGE production, including the insane amount of extras in some scenes (he says American extras are the most professional he has ever encountered), to the period cars (some scenes had well over 100 cars from the period (early '80s), to how he selected and then directed some of the actors. He expresses his deep admiration and respect for Will Smith as an actor and how well Smith took critique and direction.An EXCELLENT film with some great extras.

1054344,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,B000N6U0DS,Regina McMenamin,"[1, 1]","Starring Will Smith, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a highly recommended film about Chris Gardner's rise from homeless, medical equipment salesman to Wall Street stockbroker.Far from the typical Hollywood feel-good film, this isn't the sweet, happy tale the commercials and trailers promise.  Instead THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is the dark story of an intelligent man whose entire life falls apart after a series of bad decisions and unfortunately timed consequences.As it begins we viewers know that everything will eventually turn out joyfully, but never does director Gabriele Muccino spare us the pains of this single father.  Instead we are left in our seats, cringing for two hours as Gardner faces a biblical struggle to be a caring, loving father while living in a homeless shelter and trying to get a job at a competitive San Francisco brokerage house.Radical for a big Hollywood film, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is surprisingly pro-American and pro-capitalism.  As Smith himself has noted in countless interviews, this is a true story that never could have happened in any other country.  Though no one could ever say that Gardner had an easy time, the film shows how one man succeeded in changing his life through his own intelligence and hard work.Recommended to those who appreciate rags-to-riches stories, this film can be appreciated on many other levels.  First it offers a sympathetic look at an African-American man who is determined to be a hero in his own life and in the rearing of his only child, played by Smith's real life eight-year old son Jaden.Second, the film is visually interesting because its set designers and costumers are obsessive in their accurate depiction of the home d&eacute;cor and clothing styles of the early 1980s.  Third and most importantly, the film promotes a view of African-American men that we never see on TV, in newspapers or in other films.My only quibble, and the reason I cannot give THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS five stars is that the actions and motivations of Gardner's wife, played by Thandie Newton, are not fully explained.  There has to be a reason that she left her son to live with his homeless father, while she moved to another state.

So why bother? Because this film, despite its almost universally positive reception, got my hackles up.The Will Smith character, Chris Gardner, is portrayed as being a loving and caring father who is doing everything he's doing for the sake of his 5-year-old son. Nonsense. Chris Gardner is doing what he is doing primarily for himself. Yes, he does take good care of his son, but the final result is positive only because things do work out for him in the end.What if it had all gone horribly wrong? For every person who attempts to do what Chris Gardner did, and succeeds, there are 100 who attempt it and fail. What then? What would the consequences have been for Chris Gardner's son?My claim is that a really responsible father would have bitten the bullet and taken an ordinary job and settled down to being a single father and living a simple life, instead of gambling everything on ""the American dream"". Doing what Chris Gardner did, while it did succeed for him, was, in fact, irresponsible.Another irritating aspect of this movie is that to a large extent it pushes the idea that money and happiness go hand-in-hand. Those who are rich are all portrayed as being happy and decent people, which in my experience is far from the truth.And then there's the problem of whether Chris Gardner's chosen profession is admirable or meaningful in the general context of human activities. My understanding of financial markets is almost zero, but I got the impression that Mr. Gardner was becoming successful by selling the kind of financial constructions that have since become part of the Wall Street meltdown and the trigger to a global financial crisis.My conclusion is that ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a Hollywood ""feel-good"" movie that doesn't stand up to a more critical examination.Rennie Petersen",3,Money = happiness?,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,2022,"['normal', 'policy', 'not', 'write', 'reviews', 'products', 'already', 'have', '10', 'more', 'reviews', 'know', 'review', 'will', 'disappear', 'oblivion', 'month', 'so', 'probably', 'netting', 'several', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'So', 'why', 'bother', 'film', 'almost', 'universally', 'positive', 'reception', 'got', 'hackles', 'up.The', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'portrayed', 'being', 'loving', 'caring', 'father', 'who', 'doing', 'everything', 'doing', 'sake', '5-year-old', 'son', 'Nonsense', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'primarily', 'Yes', 'take', 'good', 'care', 'son', 'final', 'result', 'positive', 'only', 'things', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'end.What', 'had', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'person', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'did', 'are', '100', 'who', 'attempt', 'fail', 'What', 'then', 'What', 'would', 'consequences', 'have', 'been', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'son', 'claim', 'really', 'responsible', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'bitten', 'bullet', 'taken', 'ordinary', 'job', 'settled', 'down', 'being', 'single', 'father', 'living', 'simple', 'life', 'instead', 'gambling', 'everything', 'American', 'dream', 'Doing', 'what', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'did', 'did', 'succeed', 'was', 'fact', 'irresponsible.Another', 'irritating', 'aspect', 'movie', 'large', 'extent', 'idea', 'money', 'happiness', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'who', 'are', 'rich', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'happy', 'decent', 'people', 'experience', 'far', 'truth.And', 'then', 'problem', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'chosen', 'profession', 'admirable', 'meaningful', 'general', 'context', 'human', 'activities', 'understanding', 'financial', 'markets', 'almost', 'zero', 'got', 'impression', 'Mr.', 'Gardner', 'was', 'becoming', 'successful', 'selling', 'kind', 'financial', 'constructions', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'Wall', 'Street', 'meltdown', 'trigger', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis.My', 'conclusion', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'Hollywood', 'feel-good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'more', 'critical', 'examination.Rennie', 'Petersen']",N/A

It was slow-moving, and after about an hour, it was established that this guy was having a tough time. One thing we noticed was the sensitivity and unconditional love for his son, and his very common sense approach to life at large without crippling the son's mind for life. The screenwriters are to be commended for adapting Chris  Gardner's auto-biography in a direct, matter-of-fact way. I thought the pairing of Mr. Smith and his son, Jaden, was fine (unlike others' opinions). I also thought that Thandie Newton played the wife with the utmost despair, a frustration that she simply couldn't deal with. I would like to know what ultimately happened to her, as well as the young son, now in his late 20's. The DVD had some good extras, especially about Mr. Gardner and his in-put during filming. My favorite element of the film is that it involved very little racism. Mr. Gardner never complained that his bad luck was due to ""being Black"", and instead used his wit, wisdom and intelligence to make a seemingly hopeless stuation work to his ultimate advantage. He's a fine role model for ALL people who think they're at the rope's end. It CAN be done, as Mr. Gardner proved, and there are valuable lessons here, for those who take the time to let them soak in.

1054350,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B000N6U0DS,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[2, 5]","With Will Smith and apparently his young son, we get a stirring and heart-string-tugging movie about perseverance and stick-to-it-ness.For me, the movie was almost painful to watch, been there done that. Eaten with kids one meal per day at the St Vincent de Paul's, sold plasma, lived on the streets. It was not a pleasant movie by any means, i left the room several times. I can admire his drive, often i wish i had that kind of ambition, or recently that my kids had it.But the movie was, for me, like that old joke: the pilot comes on the loudspeaker and says, i got good news and i got bad news. The good news is that we are making excellent time, the bad news is that we are completely lost.The movie presents the high side and the low side of economic life in this culture. The main character traverses this spectrum on his way down. Yet his salvation is his perseverance, his ability to sacrifice everything but his son for the task at hand---getting through the internship and grabbing the brass ring of money, and influence, and power and all good things that flow from this trinity.He doesn't seem to question the monetization of all relationships. He loses a friend over a $14 debt, his wife lives because she wants a provider not a dreamer. But most importantly he nevers seems to questions the structure, the way things are. Why is the internship unpaid, they make plenty of money for the business, it is little different that that rabbit at the dogtrack, a distant carrot to incite a herculean effort to achieve it. Why are so many smart, hard working, educated people racing with the rats? when they really must know that 5% is a high percentage of winners. And what do they really win? and what do they sacrifice? what does the society sacrifice when all relationships are monetized? When a ballgame is just another way to meet people to sell them things or services or whatever?The business of America is business. phewy, life is not about making money, and he ought to have realized that when his wife left and when he hugs his kid. Friendships are not about selling things, but about sharing. But we live in a society where tupperware parties happen in the church, where phone numbers and bank statements are interchangable, for people become commodities, to be bought and sold in the ever expanding marketplace.Sure it was a touching movie, i remember our rule #1: the family stays together. Certainly a large number of people are: one marital fight from the street, or one paycheck, or one commission sale. or 2 plasma sales this week. or a cart full of aluminum cans. The question is not how a single person can rise above such and make a multimillion sale, but why we created and sustain this stupid economy that grinds down not just the poor but everyone. That grinds up the things of this world to make unneccessary bone density machines and then sells them as a dream. Movies can tell us a lot about ourselves, the fact that a black man, a single father, living on the streets, can make it in the white monied world of stockbrokers and penthouse suites at the ballgame is a tribute to the way America has changed. But more importantly how it's dreams of a good life have infected all people here, not just those descented from the recent elites. But more importantly how you could have a movie showing this life, from a bright and talented man's viewpoint and yet not at all challenge the circumstances of his life and why things are the way they are.That is my big issue with the movie, so he gets ahead and makes lots of money. Doesn't he feel anything for those who didn't? Doesn't he have a real relationship with any of the bums in the shelter? or are they incapable of being leads and prospects. It's a good movie, worthwhile watching, but i really would like to have seen some thoughtful challenge of circumstances not just the perseverance to overcome them.",4,a feel good movie with a window into our society's soul,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3891,"['Will', 'Smith', 'apparently', 'young', 'son', 'get', 'stirring', 'heart-string-tugging', 'movie', 'perseverance', 'stick-to-it-ness.For', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Eaten', 'kids', 'one', 'meal', 'day', 'St', 'Vincent', 'Paul', 'sold', 'plasma', 'lived', 'streets', 'was', 'not', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'means', 'i', 'left', 'room', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'admire', 'drive', 'often', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'had', 'kind', 'ambition', 'recently', 'kids', 'had', 'it.But', 'movie', 'was', 'old', 'joke', 'pilot', 'loudspeaker', 'i', 'got', 'good', 'news', 'i', 'got', 'bad', 'news', 'good', 'news', 'are', 'making', 'excellent', 'time', 'bad', 'news', 'are', 'completely', 'lost.The', 'movie', 'high', 'side', 'low', 'side', 'economic', 'life', 'culture', 'main', 'character', 'spectrum', 'way', 'down', 'salvation', 'perseverance', 'ability', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'son', 'task', 'hand', '-getting', 'internship', 'grabbing', 'brass', 'ring', 'money', 'influence', 'power', 'good', 'things', 'flow', 'trinity.He', ""n't"", 'seem', 'question', 'monetization', 'relationships', 'friend', '14', 'debt', 'wife', 'lives', 'provider', 'not', 'dreamer', 'most', 'importantly', 'questions', 'structure', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'Why', 'internship', 'unpaid', 'make', 'plenty', 'money', 'business', 'little', 'different', 'rabbit', 'dogtrack', 'distant', 'carrot', 'incite', 'herculean', 'effort', 'achieve', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'smart', 'hard', 'working', 'educated', 'people', 'racing', 'rats', 'when', 'really', 'must', 'know', '5', '%', 'high', 'percentage', 'winners', 'what', 'do', 'really', 'win', 'what', 'do', 'sacrifice', 'society', 'sacrifice', 'when', 'relationships', 'are', 'monetized', 'When', 'ballgame', 'just', 'way', 'meet', 'people', 'sell', 'things', 'services', 'business', 'America', 'business', 'phewy', 'life', 'not', 'making', 'money', 'ought', 'have', 'realized', 'when', 'wife', 'left', 'when', 'hugs', 'kid', 'Friendships', 'are', 'not', 'selling', 'things', 'sharing', 'live', 'society', 'where', 'tupperware', 'parties', 'happen', 'church', 'where', 'phone', 'numbers', 'bank', 'statements', 'are', 'interchangable', 'people', 'become', 'commodities', 'be', 'bought', 'sold', 'ever', 'expanding', 'marketplace.Sure', 'was', 'touching', 'movie', 'i', 'remember', 'rule', '1', 'family', 'together', 'Certainly', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'are', 'one', 'marital', 'fight', 'street', 'one', 'paycheck', 'one', 'commission', 'sale', '2', 'plasma', 'sales', 'week', 'cart', 'full', 'aluminum', 'cans', 'question', 'not', 'how', 'single', 'person', 'can', 'rise', 'such', 'make', 'multimillion', 'sale', 'why', 'created', 'sustain', 'stupid', 'economy', 'down', 'not', 'just', 'poor', 'everyone', 'up', 'things', 'world', 'make', 'unneccessary', 'bone', 'density', 'machines', 'then', 'dream', 'Movies', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'ourselves', 'fact', 'black', 'man', 'single', 'father', 'living', 'streets', 'can', 'make', 'white', 'monied', 'world', 'stockbrokers', 'penthouse', 'suites', 'ballgame', 'tribute', 'way', 'America', 'changed', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'dreams', 'good', 'life', 'have', 'infected', 'people', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'descented', 'recent', 'elites', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'movie', 'showing', 'life', 'bright', 'talented', 'man', 'viewpoint', 'yet', 'not', 'challenge', 'circumstances', 'life', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are.That', 'big', 'issue', 'movie', 'ahead', 'lots', 'money', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'Does', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'relationship', 'bums', 'shelter', 'are', 'incapable', 'being', 'leads', 'prospects', 'good', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'thoughtful', 'challenge', 'circumstances', 'not', 'just', 'perseverance', 'overcome']",N/A

Gardner decides he wants to be a stockbroker, despite having no college education, and pursues this dream doggedly. Smith's moving performance perfectly captures this air of perseverance and determination. As we watch Smith descending into the bowels of society, we are heartbroken along with him, and later elated when successes come. Also turning in an excellent debut is Smith's real life son, Jaden, who is charming as Christopher Gardner.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 3]","Pros: I read an article in my college newspaper from a columnist who made fun of a homeless man selling Streetwise. He basically proclaimed that if no one was selling condoms, liquor, Greek paraphernalia, or telling them about a party, then they shouldn't be bugging him on the way to class to sell a newspaper. I was absolutely outraged and wrote a nice long article to that newspaper and another publication to make sure my voice was heard. There are far too many elitist people in this world too wrapped up in their own personal drama to reflect the fact that they should be thankful for what they have.  In this movie, we learn about a man who has made a bad business decision by buying medical equipment and going into debt trying to make a profit from it.  With his employment issues, he also has a wife who is working overtime and a son who has a very unprofessional daycare instructor.  To make matters worse, his wife leaves him and he is evicted from his apartment.  But the strongest part about it is that even with all of the things going on around him, he is still so determined to sell his equipment, take care of his son, be civil with his wife, and try to find a career that works. I read an article in JET magazine about the real life Chris Gardner, and one of the shelter employees said that it was rare that someone could come out of poverty into being a millionaire. This story had to be told--if not for those selfish people who don't understand why people are standing on the corner because they have no place else to go; that homeless men have a rough time getting into those shelters because so many are for women and children; and how charities work.  Whether it was Christmas or not, this type of story needs to be told because so many (like that simple-minded writer I spoke of earlier) turn a deaf ear to anybody not in their economic group. It's aggravating and stressful.  I appreciated Smith being apart of this movie so much.  It's cool when he tries his hand at other genres (science fiction, action, documentaries) and I love that he will take on so many different roles, from killing aliens to molding into a very strong and admirable homeless man who will succeed by all means necessary.  This was a very touching film and I loved every minute of it.  There is nothing more adorable than to see a father who loves his child, and I'm so glad that Smith's son was able to play the part of the son.On top of that, when I was leaving the theater, this thugged out dude was on his cell phone talking to a friend about how much this movie motivated him and made him want to make money.  When Will Smith touches brothas to want to make legitimate money, there's no way I can give it anything but a thumbs up.

Well one day in browsing Blockbuster I realized it had come out on DVD, so I take it home with me.It was a 2-day rental. I still haven't given it back.Inspired by a true story, Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, the poor salesman who has a problem with parking tickets and paying rent. He's a very smart guy, though, as he is able to complete a Rubik's Cube in only a few minutes...talk about skilled! He has a son, Christopher, who he had with his girlfriend who leaves him towards the beginning of the movie. Chris applies for an internship as a stock broker in hope that he will be able to produce the money to provide a better living atmosphere for he and his son.Will Smith has never given a finer performance. As a Hollywood multi-million dollar actor, the way he is able to portray a poor man in such a realistic way is beyond me. Little Jaden Smith (Will's son) does a surprisingly amazing job as Chris's son.But, in my opinion, the best part about this movie is the message: ""If you want something, go get it. Period."" I couldn't agree with this statement more, and the true story of Chris Gardner proves it.

Gardner works as a salesman and is trying his hardest to support his family, but nobody wants to buy his bone density scanners. Bills are piling up, the rent is two months behind, and his landlord is running out of patience.Gardner's world changes when he has a chance encounter on the street with a stockbroker. The man owns a flashy car and Gardner notes that everyone walking out of the office building seems happy. He decides to apply to Dean Witter in an attempt to solve all of his problems.Getting the attention of his potential employer is not easy, but the film, which is set it 1981, uses a Rubik's Cube to demonstrate Gardner's intelligence. Gardner manages to share a cab with a Dean Witter employee who is in a position to recommend him for an interview, and he solves the puzzle of the Rubik's Cube during the journey. That leads to an interview, but Gardner is arrested for non-payment of parking tickets the night before. He turns up for the interview covered in paint and without a shirt. It's a great scene with a lot of humor and Gardner somehow passes the interview.The film is based on a true story and shows a typical struggle of a man trying to make his way in the world. You might compare it to It's a Wonderful Life in many ways. Linda eventually decides to leave Gardner, but he insists that Christopher will stay with him. It's here that the film stands out. The relationship between father and son is the very heart of the film. Gardner tries to support Christopher, but money is always a problem. The pair are forced to endure some rough times, but Christopher trusts his father and rarely complains.I think Pursuit of Happyness was a breakthrough role for Smith. We already knew that he could pull off action roles and comedy, but he had to show considerable range to play Chris Gardner. The performance earned him an Oscar nomination and it was truly deserved.It's interesting watching Gardner claw his way up while he serves his internship. His dual role as a father limits the time he can spend working and studying, but he makes the best use of what time he has available. Jaden Smith was effective as Christopher, though I wonder how much acting was necessary when your on-screen father is your real father.Director Gabriele Muccino did a good job of focusing on Smith's emotional side and I found myself fully-invested with Gardner's struggle the whole time.The film makes me wonder how many people are quietly struggling through similar problems every day. In the current economic climate, things are even tougher than they were in 1981. What would you do to ensure that your family is able to survive? Taking two or three jobs is an option, but that places a strain on you and on all of your relationships.How do you define happiness? Is it enough just to be able to survive? I've explored this theme in a number of reviews and it's highly relevant here. I don't think Gardner was simply pursuing money and career success; he was taking care of his child. Maybe it's important to feel like you are making the most of your abilities? Pride in your performance is one measure of success, and so is spending time with the people you love. I think The Pursuit of Happyness explores a number of important themes. The definition of happiness is subjective. Do you know what your own definition would be?",5,Probably Smith's best performance to date,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,3494,"['Chris', 'Gardner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'cheap', 'rental', 'apartment', 'partner', 'Linda', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'who', 'mother', 'son', 'Christopher', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Gardner', 'salesman', 'trying', 'hardest', 'support', 'family', 'nobody', 'buy', 'bone', 'density', 'scanners', 'Bills', 'are', 'piling', 'up', 'rent', 'two', 'months', 'landlord', 'running', 'out', 'patience.Gardner', 'world', 'changes', 'when', 'chance', 'encounter', 'street', 'stockbroker', 'man', 'flashy', 'car', 'Gardner', 'notes', 'everyone', 'walking', 'office', 'building', 'happy', 'apply', 'Dean', 'Witter', 'attempt', 'solve', 'problems.Getting', 'attention', 'potential', 'employer', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'set', '1981', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'demonstrate', 'Gardner', 'intelligence', 'Gardner', 'share', 'cab', 'Dean', 'Witter', 'employee', 'who', 'position', 'recommend', 'interview', 'puzzle', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'journey', 'interview', 'Gardner', 'arrested', 'non-payment', 'parking', 'tickets', 'night', 'before', 'up', 'interview', 'covered', 'paint', 'shirt', 'great', 'scene', 'lot', 'humor', 'Gardner', 'somehow', 'interview.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'typical', 'struggle', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'world', 'might', 'compare', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'many', 'ways', 'Linda', 'eventually', 'leave', 'Gardner', 'Christopher', 'will', 'stay', 'here', 'film', 'out', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'very', 'heart', 'film', 'Gardner', 'support', 'Christopher', 'money', 'always', 'problem', 'pair', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'rough', 'times', 'Christopher', 'father', 'rarely', 'complains.I', 'think', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'Smith', 'already', 'knew', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'action', 'roles', 'comedy', 'had', 'show', 'considerable', 'range', 'play', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'performance', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'truly', 'deserved.It', 'interesting', 'watching', 'Gardner', 'claw', 'way', 'up', 'internship', 'dual', 'role', 'father', 'time', 'can', 'spend', 'working', 'studying', 'best', 'use', 'what', 'time', 'available', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'was', 'effective', 'Christopher', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'acting', 'was', 'necessary', 'when', 'on-screen', 'father', 'real', 'father.Director', 'Gabriele', 'Muccino', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'focusing', 'Smith', 'emotional', 'side', 'found', 'fully-invested', 'Gardner', 'struggle', 'whole', 'time.The', 'film', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'quietly', 'struggling', 'similar', 'problems', 'day', 'current', 'economic', 'climate', 'things', 'are', 'even', 'tougher', 'were', '1981', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'ensure', 'family', 'able', 'survive', 'Taking', 'two', 'three', 'jobs', 'option', 'strain', 'relationships.How', 'do', 'define', 'happiness', 'enough', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'survive', ""'ve"", 'explored', 'theme', 'number', 'reviews', 'highly', 'relevant', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Gardner', 'was', 'simply', 'pursuing', 'money', 'career', 'success', 'was', 'taking', 'care', 'child', 'important', 'feel', 'are', 'making', 'most', 'abilities', 'Pride', 'performance', 'one', 'measure', 'success', 'so', 'spending', 'time', 'people', 'love', 'think', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'number', 'important', 'themes', 'definition', 'happiness', 'subjective', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'own', 'definition', 'would', 'be']",N/A
1054373,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000N6U0DS,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[4, 8]","***UPDATE:  I had the incredible good fortune to hear Gardner's story firsthand when my wife surprised me with tickets to see him when he visited our area and spoke at the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce on May 2, 2007.  He basically told his story as it was revealed in the film and noted some changes the film made such as in reality his son was only 2 when all this happened to him and not 5.  He did say something terrifically funny when he said, ""I'm amazed that it cost Hollywood 70 million dollars to reproduce what I experienced for free.""  His presentation was filled with such precious gems like that one.  Gardner continues to give back to people who desperately need it as his book was available after his speech and a portion of the proceeds went to a local charity and he does this everywhere he speaks.  Gardner is a truly inspirational individual and I was honored to hear his story firsthand.This is one of those films that can be very difficult to review without alienating somebody.  If you criticize Will Smith, his legions of fans will go on the attack.  If you criticize the film itself, you'll get blasted for being heartless.  Lastly, if, God forbid, you criticize a child's performance, you are considered ruthless.  I can see by the number of negative votes that I have received here that my point is somewhat valid even though I took great pains to praise this film where it appropriately deserved it, but I guess my criticism where poorly received.  I wish people knew how to use these ""helpful"" buttons more as they aren't meant to ONLY support reviews one agrees with.  I have given many ""helpful"" votes to review I totally disagree with as they supported their opinion well and got me to consider things I hadn't before.  Oh, well.  Here is my review and I still stand by it today.""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was a hard film to watch as I believe it was intended by those involved as it is always very difficult to witness the heartaching struggles others sometimes have.  This is a truly moving story of a poverty-stricken family and a dad who all too often creates his own obstacles in life, but, nevertheless, continues to move forward with courage, dignity, love, and patience that few possess.  Although a flawed hero, Will's character, Gardner, is a hero in the true sense of the word and one can't help but feel that old phrase ""There but through the grace of God walk I.""  The main character and storyline are truly inspirational and Smith's acting here is something to really behold, but the film, for me, did have some serious flaws.On the positive end, the acting by Smith is nothing less than flawless.  His eyes show his pain and joy at any given moment.  I was absolutely brought to tears myself (my family too) when he's holed up in a subway bathroom with his kid pretending it's a cave and they are hiding out from dinosaurs.  Smith's slow, laborious, and silent weeping in that bathroom on the floor while holding his sleeeping son is one of the most emotional scenes ever filmed and that scene alone requires an Oscar nomination for him (which would be his second).  I was also moved to tears when Smith's character gets the job at the end of the film and does all he can not to cry in front of his new employers.  I have been in such a situation myself after losing a job and when I found another after a year of unemployment and losing my home; I could really relate to Smith's struggle to not cry in front of his new bosses.  By the way, I didn't spoil anything here as all, if not most, are aware of this man's success story already.Will's son is not the best actor, but he's engaging enough.  Some cliched script writing hurts him more than his ability to deliver a line.  He's just too perfect of a kid to believe and that affects how I actually view his performance and that, perhaps, isn't fair.  However, who can resist a real-life father and son act?  I can't.  It's just sad that the writers have him saying some silly and/or too mature lines over and over again.  In an overall good film this is a serious flaw that really stands out and can be distracting.In addition, the direction was another serious flaw with the film.  It labors too long in some areas and goes too fast in others, yet, I must admit that I appreciate the level of acting the director gets out of his actors in spite of his poor pacing and uneven direction.  I am as exhausted as Smith's character by the end of the film as he's always running somewhere.  I realize that may have been the intention of the film, but in actuality, it is annoying after awhile with it's redundancy.  Again, I know we are being asked to experience the tragedy of this man's existance at the worst time in his life; however, I'm also noting that the repetitive scenes of dispair wear away at an audience's patience at times.  I noticed many squirming in their seats at numerous such scenes.  A good point can be lost when overdone.  I had the awkward feeling that the director was feeling outshined by his cast and tried too hard to put his personal stamp on the film.I did love some specific elements in the film like how meaningless money is to those that have it.  A very memorable moment is when Smith's boss asks him for $5 to cover a cab ride and he gives it to him, leaving nothing left for himself or his son but a few dollars.  Oh, how we take money for granted.  Another such scene is when he shares a cab with another boss who stiffs him the $20 cab fee (assuming everyone has at least $20 bucks on them), forcing Smith's character to literally flee the cab and be chased by the driver, which, by the way, was a very well-directed sequence.All in all, this is a competent film with an extraordinary performance by Will Smith which earned him a well-deserved second Oscar nomination for Best Actor (the first was forAli), but just don't be surprised that the overall quality of the film is that of a TV-Movie; albeit, a very well-made TV-Movie.  I recommend this film for those who have the patience to sit through this kind of film which can be difficult due to its subject matter and its uneven pacing.  Poverty is never pretty to witness or experience, but stories like this need to be told and we need to listen to what it has to say.  This is a very inspirational film with moving performance and a number of memorable scenes.  I might not ""buy"" this DVD when it comes out (something I reserve for films that have great repeat value), but I would surely rent it and view it again and recommend others to view it as well.",3,In

I'm all better.Well, I'm sure to get some negative hits at Amazon, after I post this review, but here it goes...Chris Gardner (Smith), the struggling father of a small boy, Christopher (Smith), struggles to sell pieces of medical equipment no doctor seems to want, struggles to get his kid to a third rate, but cheap daycare, and struggles to maintain a home with his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), who works double shifts in a hotel laundry. He just struggles. Chris eventually loses one of the medical devices and this is the last straw for Linda, who walks out. Unable to pay the rent, Chris and his son are evicted and they move into a seedy motel in the Mission district of San Francisco. Chris watches a man park his expensive car at the curb and learns the man is a stockbroker at Dean Witter. Hounding the head of personnel, Jay Twistle (Brian Howe), Chris eventually wins an interview and soon lands an internship with the prestigious brokerage. An unpaid internship. While he works through the competitive internship, Chris sets out to sell the remaining medical devices, to support him and his son, providing their only source of income. Only one in the class of twenty will be hired so it's a struggle. As Chris tries to keep his son safe and fed, he studies his manual, tries to sell the machines, and tries to impress his bosses. Will Chris Gardner be able to overcome the struggle?""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (yes, I know Microsoft, it is misspelled), directed by Gabriele Muccino, starring Will Smith and his real son, Jaden, is ""inspired by"" the real story of Chris Gardner.""Happyness"" is the perfect film for this time of year. Designed to provide a brief respite for all of the mall shoppers, give them a bit of fluff, between checkout lines at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, and give them a little inspiration before they trudge out to deal with the next store employee who has had one too many customers like you today. I'm sure some people will be moved and some people will be inspired, it is difficult to not be moved when Gardner finally gets the job at Dean Witter. Oh, I'm not spoiling anything. Even if you didn't already know this, they would never make a film about someone who didn't get the job. That is what the film is about, persevering beyond the struggles. Maybe you'll come out of the film with that extra little oomph in your step, ready to face your own struggles with holiday woes.But ""Happyness"" is so much more than a little piece of fluff. It is a very calculated move by Smith to get an Oscar nomination. If he tells you otherwise, he is lying. Smith is a movie star and commands a top salary for every film. He can open any film, good or bad, because he has legions of fans willing to pay to see any film he is in. Heck, he can open ""The Pursuit of Happyness"", making it the number one film for the weekend. But he, like every actor, isn't content with simply appearing in box office fluff. Right before this film, there was a trailer for Adam Sandler's next film ""Reign Over Me"", in which he plays a depressed widower who meets up with an old college chum (Don Cheadle). Sandler and Smith are remarkably similar. If Sandler appears in a silly comedy, the film is box office gold. If Smith appears in a sci fi comedy or an action film, box office gold. But both want respectability and the way to achieve that is to make films like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Reign Over Me"". These films show they can act, become something other than their popular on screen persona. Sandler has been dipping his toes in this pool for a while, making films like ""Punch Drunk Love"" and ""Spanglish"" along with his more sophomoric comedies.So, going in, we already know the outcome of ""Happyness"", which means there is no suspense. The only point in watching the film is to watch the struggle. And Gardner struggles. No doubt about that. As the voice over narration states, he signs over his life savings to buy these machines, the medical devices no doctor seems to want. He loses his car, because he has a problem with parking tickets, so he has to carry them all over the Bay Area. He has to make sure he can pick up his son on time. He has to count every penny, to make sure he can feed his son. And more. When the money starts to run out, they are kicked out of their apartment. Then the slide downward continues.But Chris can't let this affect him, as it would most. He has a son to look after. So he signs up for the internship. As he deals with all of these other problems, he also has to study and learn all about his new job. ""Pursuit"" piles on the challenges and the few moments Chris is able to spend with his young son are filled with moments of ""divine insight"". Chris imparts one helpful comment after another, determined his son will not suffer the same mistakes he has made. ""Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.""The problem with ""Pursuit"" is two-fold. Because there is not suspense about whether he will get the job, we must be content with the depiction of the struggle. And how he struggles. One obstacle after another is thrown at him. This presents the second problem. Chris Gardner is so saintly, his character has no evolution or change at all. He starts out a good father and ends the film as a good father. He is a saint and the film knows it. At one point, when Chris and Christopher are sleeping in a homeless shelter run by a church, `poppa' moves to a darkened corner to work on his last medical device; the device is broken and he needs to fix it before he can sell it. When he manages to fix it, a brilliant white light emanates from the machine and the film moves away to a long shot, to show the light emanating from Chris' center, the center of his very being. If you look at the poster for this film, you may notice that a light obscures where Smith is holding his son's hand. Chris is a martyr who will do anything for the betterment of his son's life.Every year, a number of fine actors and actresses are nominated for an Academy Award. If you do a survey, you will find that an inordinate amount of these nominations went to actors who portray handicapped people of one type or another. And a large number of winners have played these roles. It also helps if a pretty or handsome actor takes on the role, to `show their range'. In ""Pursuit"", Chris Gardner has a handicap of sorts; a phenomenal lack of good decision making skills. From marrying Linda and having a son with her, to spending his life savings on the medical devices, from asking a hippie to safeguard one of the machines while he has an interview, to chasing a homeless man through BART to retrieve one of those heavy medical devices, Chris never makes the right decision. Yet, he perseveres. And the moment when Chris gets the job with Dean Witter is an emotional one. Maybe Smith does deserve a nomination for making this performance work.""Pursuit"" doesn't seem to believe anyone has more than one facet to their character. Chris is good. Linda is bad. Thandie Newton's Linda does nothing but complain, act sullen, put out and annoyed, grudgingly kissing her son and husband. Believe me, she has every right to be this way, but because Chris is so saintly, we look at Linda as a shrew. She has to work two shifts? Look at how this man has struggled to sell these machines all over the Bay Area, lugging the heavy machines on multiple buses and through crowded BART trains. How dare she complain, even though Chris created the problem by not paying his parking tickets. When she walks out, the film wants us to have no sympathy for her, Chris is the saint in this picture and he must have the sympathy.All of the people who Chris comes into contact with are either good or meant to provide comic relief. He has an encounter with a hippy and another with a crazy homeless man, but all of the partners at Dean Witter are supportive and encouraging. Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer and many other characters on ""The Simpsons"") plays Alan Frakesh, the office manager who runs the intern training program. Chris becomes his errand boy and Alan unknowingly threatens some of the deals Chris is working on. But this character goes nowhere. Because he `unknowingly' threatens these deals, he is still `good'. And he doesn't provide enough comic relief to make the role interesting.Jaden Smith is okay as Christopher. He's no Tatum O'Neal, but he's not as precocious as some child actors. Most of his scenes require him to do little more than display one emotion, and he does this well. In some, he is mopey, in others, happy. Hopefully, his adult life won't mirror the daughter of Ryan O'Neal's either.""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is meant to be an inspiring holiday tale, designed to move people to tears as they watch Chris Gardner's struggle. But it is such a calculated piece of filmmaking that it was difficult for me to watch. It doesn't help that many of the moments between Chris and Christopher are punctuated by dialogue that seems ingested from every single self help book ever written. Hopefully, Dr. Phil is getting a royalty.I cry when I watch ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" and ""Pursuit"" didn't move me that much.",2,Full of saccharin and self-help platitudes,1166572800,"12

1054382,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000N6U0DS,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a based-on-truth story about Chris Gardner, freelance salesman of portable bone density tracer. But carrying a heavy machine around in San Francisco is a hard work especially when he has to send his son to the daycare center, and not every doctor is interested in his `gismo.' Down on his luck, he accepts an unpaid job in the training program of a stockbroking house, but in spite of (or because of) his eagerness, his wife become more estranged, giving a cold shoulder to him.Will Smith is perfect as Chris Gardner, who eventually has to sleep in a public restroom in the subway with his son, making him believe that this is a `cave.' Because of the warmth and humor in Will Smith's performance and the visible rapport with his son (played by his real-life son Jaden), the film is not depressing as you might believe. Still some people (not me) might feel so looking at Chris doing jobs as unpaid intern, hit by a car in the street, and still going back to work even though he is uncertain of his future (only one applicant will pass the test).Italian-born director Gabriele Muccino avoids sugary sentiments in this Horatio Alger-like tale, and at times Chris' zealous attitudes look pathetic (don't miss one scene where Chris is seen dragging his son to catch a bus). It is clear that Muccino is trying to present his own version of American dream. The film gets really credible and its satire becomes biting when the company's bosses casually ask him to do things like lending five dollars. The bosses are not bad people (no `villains' appear), but they just don't see the vast gaps (financial and otherwise) between them and Chris even though they are both wearing suits.However, like many major studio films made by non-American directors brought in Hollywood, we can see director is trying to be different in contents, but we don't see in what way exactly. I read many reviews on this film, and though many used such words as inspirational and uplifting, some people said the film is depressing. The fact is `The Pursuit of Happyness' could be both, not content with being either of them. After all, what made Chris apply for the stockbroker's trainee course first? Was it a red Ferrari or his son's happiness?We are not sure of that. We are sure of Will Smith's heart-warming turn, however, and that is probably the greatest thing in `The Pursuit of Happyness' which is a feel-good movie, but there is somewhere in the film an untold part you can vaguely sense.",3,Excellent Will Smith and Another Inspirational Real-Life Story Told Slightly Different Way,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2499,"['Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'based-on-truth', 'story', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'freelance', 'salesman', 'portable', 'bone', 'density', 'tracer', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'machine', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hard', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'send', 'son', 'daycare', 'center', 'not', 'doctor', 'interested', 'gismo', 'Down', 'luck', 'unpaid', 'job', 'training', 'program', 'stockbroking', 'house', 'spite', 'eagerness', 'wife', 'become', 'more', 'estranged', 'giving', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'him.Will', 'Smith', 'perfect', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'who', 'eventually', 'sleep', 'public', 'restroom', 'subway', 'son', 'making', 'believe', 'cave', 'warmth', 'humor', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance', 'visible', 'rapport', 'son', 'played', 'real-life', 'son', 'Jaden', 'film', 'not', 'depressing', 'might', 'believe', 'Still', 'people', 'not', 'might', 'feel', 'so', 'looking', 'Chris', 'doing', 'jobs', 'unpaid', 'intern', 'hit', 'car', 'street', 'still', 'going', 'back', 'work', 'even', 'uncertain', 'future', 'only', 'one', 'applicant', 'will', 'pass', 'test', '.Italian-born', 'director', 'Gabriele', 'Muccino', 'avoids', 'sugary', 'sentiments', 'Horatio', 'Alger-like', 'tale', 'times', 'Chris', 'zealous', 'attitudes', 'look', 'pathetic', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Chris', 'seen', 'dragging', 'son', 'catch', 'bus', 'clear', 'Muccino', 'trying', 'present', 'own', 'version', 'American', 'dream', 'film', 'really', 'credible', 'satire', 'becomes', 'biting', 'when', 'company', 'bosses', 'casually', 'ask', 'do', 'things', 'lending', 'five', 'dollars', 'bosses', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'people', 'villains', 'appear', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'vast', 'gaps', 'financial', 'otherwise', 'Chris', 'even', 'are', 'wearing', 'suits.However', 'many', 'major', 'studio', 'films', 'made', 'non-American', 'directors', 'brought', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'trying', 'be', 'different', 'contents', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'way', 'exactly', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'many', 'used', 'such', 'words', 'inspirational', 'uplifting', 'people', 'said', 'film', 'depressing', 'fact', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'content', 'being', 'what', 'made', 'Chris', 'apply', 'stockbroker', 'trainee', 'course', 'first', 'Was', 'red', 'Ferrari', 'son', 'happiness', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'sure', 'Will', 'Smith', 'heart-warming', 'turn', 'however', 'probably', 'greatest', 'thing', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'film', 'untold', 'part', 'can', 'vaguely', 'sense']",N/A

On each one of our individual journeys there are thousands of things that can happen to knock us off our feet and set us back hundreds of paces.  It can be really frustrating and confusing.  Yet, the trials of life shouldn't be an excuse for giving up.  We can move forward towards ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""  That's what Chris Gardner did.THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is an inspiring movie about some of the events in Gardner's life and how he was able to overcome them.  Gardner (played by Will Smith) was a struggling salesman of portable bone density scanners.  He used his life savings to pay for the venture and it was a costly mistake, but Gardner didn't give up.  He was determined to work the pavement, going from one medical office to another until he sold every last unit and could move on to better things.  His wife is unhappy in their marriage, his car has been possessed by the City of San Francisco, and they are almost three months behind due on their rent.  In this desperate time Gardner becomes inspired to apply for an internship at a major stock brokerage firm.  He impresses the employers and is offered the competitive internship, only to discover that it's a six month unpaid internship.  Determined to change things around, Gardner takes the position.  His wife leaves and Gardner is left to raise their son alone.  Together the father and son struggle as they are evicted from one place and another, homelessness, an auto accident, tax seizure, and mediocre child care all in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Will Smith is one of America's great actors.  He can do drama, action, comedy, romance, and just about any other genre and not just do it, but do it well.  In this film he is joined by his own son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, portraying Gardner's son, Christopher.  Will Smith and Jaden must have a strong relationship and it comes across in the movie.  The real-life relationship between the film's stars helps ground the movie even more.I enjoyed watching THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS.  The movie seemed real and true. Unlike many inspirational stories and biopics I've seen, it wasn't an over-sentimental, mushy, feel-good fluffy film.  Instead, to me, I felt like I was watching a few chapters from the biography of someone's life; a person who had overcome some incredible odds.  I also enjoyed the strong relationship displayed between Gardner and Christopher.  So often in movies, even ones based on real people, children neglect their parents and parents neglect their children.  That wasn't the case in this film.

It is suppose to be based on a true story which in todays world might have meant that a white guy applied for a job and was a track star and they got this movie out of that story. I think that Will Smith was going for Tom Cruises record of being the greatest runner in the history of cinema. Smith, who I don't think is a great actor but who does an adequate job runs, runs and runs some more thru this entire movie.
