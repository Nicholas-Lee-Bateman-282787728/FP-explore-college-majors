Though the movie has no definite construction of climax and conclusion, I found it very inspiring and thought provoking. I think that what the director intended was to have the audience try and get into the characters heads. Why do they act the way they do, what kind of relationship do they really have with the other characters? Situations that are very realistic and comparable to what we may experience, and how the characters handle it can be eye-opening. A very well-acted, well-written movie.",5,Thought Provoking,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,613,"['movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'popular', 'genre', 'today', 'reason', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'relatable', 'movie', 'definite', 'construction', 'climax', 'conclusion', 'found', 'very', 'inspiring', 'thought', 'provoking', 'think', 'what', 'director', 'intended', 'was', 'have', 'audience', 'try', 'get', 'characters', 'heads', 'Why', 'do', 'act', 'way', 'do', 'what', 'kind', 'relationship', 'do', 'really', 'have', 'other', 'characters', 'Situations', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'comparable', 'what', 'may', 'experience', 'how', 'characters', 'handle', 'can', 'be', 'eye-opening', 'very', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'movie']",Archipelago [Region 2]

This movie like her other work didn't fail to disappoint.  I loved it so much I saw it twice in the same week.  A rarity for me.  All the actors do such a great job.  A stellar portrayal of a broken family who come together out of suffering obligation and expectation rather than out of joy and the tension that arises from that.,5,My favorite of Hoggs,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,434,"['just', 'love', 'Joanna', 'Hogg', 'work-', 'only', 'complaint', 'being', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'enough', 'available', 'movie', 'other', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'fail', 'disappoint', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'saw', 'twice', 'same', 'week', 'rarity', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'stellar', 'portrayal', 'broken', 'family', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'suffering', 'obligation', 'expectation', 'rather', 'joy', 'tension']",Archipelago [Region 2]
1442044,A25S4Q7KSTEW02,B0054SFD7I,W. Rodick,"[8, 12]","Archipelago is not a wonderful film. It is one of the few films that dares to analyse the English middle-class mindset. It is an intriguing portrayal of loneliness.A family holiday is a rented house in a baron landscape. A painter is hired to assist them with their artistic bent. A young female cook supplements her income as their cook/housemaid. Pheasant are killed especially for them. Two lobsters are also caught for 35 without so much as a pause in the sale. We don't see the fisherman hand over the 5 change. Such things are completely unimportant. And taken for granted.The layers of the film are to be enjoyed. The painter provides 'chaos.' The juxtaposition of art and life is rendered through words and pictures. The telephone in the confined corner is a masterstroke. As are the doors, the pale shades of walls and the missing painting. When the family each in turn say good-bye to the house I see and hear lives as empty as the restaurant they all dined at. Just once.Only the painter has an unconditional relationship but that is with his creative spirit. The cook is strong enough to step aside. It is the family who have suffered as individuals. Never been loved. Their relationships conditional, disciplined and defined. A change of scene, equally well ordered, is their only form of hope.Can I recommend this film? It is up to you. I enjoy original filmmaking which keeps me watching, wondering. Thinking after the facts.
