789991,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0000ZBONC,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","This series is a Tenchi series in name only. The series should be called Seina Yamada GXP. Seina is a boy that is knida lame. His family enrolls him in the galaxy police academy. This show is about the crazy life he has at the academy. He is yet another wimpy boy that gets the attention of some major babes. He is not a very compelling character though. He tries hard, but all the powers that be are out to get him. I like the female characters in this series, and there are some pretty funny situations, but this series falls way short of greatness. There are  few old characters that get a little time. Mainly Mihoshi, who cleans the toilets and hallways at the academy. If you are a completest and won't be satisfied unless you own all the Tenchi entries, then go on and buy this show. If you are interested in this series b/c you expect more Tenchi and his harem, then you aren't missing anything. Personally I don't think this series good or bad. It's not memorable, and has already been forgotten by most.",3,It's not Tenchi.

789992,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B0000ZBONC,Michael Valdivielso,"[4, 4]","Seina Yamada is from Earth, but through a series of accidents and strange events, he ends up joining the Galaxy Police.  He'll meet Pirates and Princesses, sexy Police Detectives and weird aliens (some of which are also sexy).  Will he survive space travel?  Will he survive having so many females trying to help him?  Will he survive dorm life?While he might be unlucky, he does have a few good points.  He has a good heart and REALLY wants to explore space and learn about life off the planet Earth.  So it looks like he plans to stay with the Galaxy Police, no matter what happens.This first DVD has five episodes, a few extras and a lot of fun.  The GXP TV series is linked to the Tenchi Muyo! OVAs by using some of the same settings and some characters related to the OVA characters.  We get a glimpse of Ryoko, we meet Mihoshi's mom, it seems that the dorm security system was designed by Dr. Clay, and we learn that the Jurai Family Tree is more of a over-cooked bowl of spaghetti.  The artwork is great, with heavy use of computer graphics for the ships and many of the combat scenes.  I just loved the pirate Rats and the marks that could not be shown on TV.  Warning: The subtitles for the Japanese version IS different from the English version (which I believe is meant to help the hearing impaired).  So if you want a direct translation listen to the Japanese audio with the subtitles - it does seem to make more sense too.

Awnings fall on him, his bike falls apart every time he rides it, he falls constantly and things fall on him, and so on; his luck also rubs off on people he passes, so most people avoid him.  Through a &quot;random&quot; encounter, he meets a member of the Galaxy Police who has come to earth to deliver a message to Tenchi and who rescues him from drowning after her ship crashes into Tenchi's lake and floods the surrounding area.  She gives him an application for admission to the Galaxy Police Academy and vanishes, literally.  His mother and sister, thinking that it's a sweepstakes entry (they can't read the alien language), force him to fill it out and thumbprint it.  That night while he's asleep, he's beamed up into a GP transport ship.  He awakes on ship to find a blond woman named Mitoto (Mihoshi's mother) and the captain of the ship standing over him, and he's informed that he's on the way to the GP academy.  His bad luck causes the ship to be attacked by an entire fleet of pirates, which causes him to later meet the Devil Princess of Jurai, the woman detective who recruited him, the girl who took care of him when he was small, Yosho's wife, Mihoshi's grandparents and more characters related to the Tenchi universe.  He enters the academy, undergoes transformations, fights pirates, captains his own ship, returns to Earth for a visit, pilots a giant robot, and this is just in his first year of training!This is even more of a slapstick roller coaster ride than the rest of the Tenchi series.  The wonder of the Tenchi universe is here with its alien civilizations, unbelievable technology, complicated relationships, and deep backstory.  There's not as much of the seriousness that occasionally pervaded Tenchi; it's subordinated to the comedy, and, being Tenchi, the comedy is often crude, seriously lewd, and brash, but it's just flat-out fun.  This is definitely not for children in places.  Also, check out track two of the English subtitles; it's a more literal translation from the Japanese than the dub, and sometimes the differences are so huge that you have to wonder what story Funimation was watching when they wrote the script.For extremely detailed descriptions of the episodes, I recommend [...]",5,It's a blast!,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2311,"['unluckiest', 'human', 'Earth', 'Seina', 'Yamada', 'schoolmate', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Awnings', 'fall', 'bike', 'apart', 'time', 'constantly', 'things', 'fall', 'so', 'luck', 'also', 'off', 'people', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'avoid', 'quot', 'quot', 'encounter', 'member', 'Galaxy', 'Police', 'who', 'come', 'earth', 'deliver', 'message', 'Tenchi', 'who', 'rescues', 'drowning', 'ship', 'crashes', 'Tenchi', 'lake', 'floods', 'surrounding', 'area', 'application', 'admission', 'Galaxy', 'Police', 'Academy', 'vanishes', 'literally', 'mother', 'sister', 'thinking', 'sweepstakes', 'entry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'alien', 'language', 'force', 'fill', 'out', 'thumbprint', 'night', 'asleep', 'beamed', 'up', 'GP', 'transport', 'ship', 'ship', 'find', 'blond', 'woman', 'named', 'Mitoto', 'Mihoshi', 'mother', 'captain', 'ship', 'standing', 'informed', 'way', 'GP', 'academy', 'bad', 'luck', 'ship', 'be', 'attacked', 'entire', 'fleet', 'pirates', 'later', 'meet', 'Devil', 'Princess', 'Jurai', 'woman', 'detective', 'who', 'recruited', 'girl', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'Yosho', 'wife', 'Mihoshi', 'grandparents', 'more', 'characters', 'related', 'Tenchi', 'universe', 'academy', 'undergoes', 'transformations', 'fights', 'pirates', 'own', 'ship', 'returns', 'Earth', 'visit', 'pilots', 'giant', 'robot', 'just', 'first', 'year', 'training', 'even', 'more', 'slapstick', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'rest', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'wonder', 'Tenchi', 'universe', 'here', 'alien', 'civilizations', 'unbelievable', 'technology', 'complicated', 'relationships', 'deep', 'backstory', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'seriousness', 'occasionally', 'pervaded', 'Tenchi', 'subordinated', 'comedy', 'being', 'Tenchi', 'comedy', 'often', 'crude', 'seriously', 'lewd', 'brash', 'just', 'flat-out', 'fun', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'places', 'Also', 'check', 'out', 'track', 'two', 'English', 'subtitles', 'more', 'literal', 'translation', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'sometimes', 'differences', 'are', 'so', 'huge', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'story', 'Funimation', 'was', 'watching', 'when', 'wrote', 'script.For', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'episodes', 'recommend', '[', ']']",Tenchi Muyo GXP - Out of This World Vol. 1

The first disk does introduce you to all the characters, and gets the show going so by the second and third disk its all good.
