505140,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00000IXOF,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 9]","Jab, Kick & Burn is a kickboxing workout which consists of three 14-minute kickboxing segments followed by a 10-minute abs-focused cool-down.  British instructor Tracey Mallet has a high energy level and Barbie-like good looks; she definitely seems to be having fun during the workouts and encourages you to do the same.The first kickboxing section was my favorite.  After a brief warm-up which includes some slightly dance-y moves, Tracey moves on to some kicking drills.  She then continues with some slow and controlled combos which were fun but which didn't raise my hear rate much, but the second half of the workout includes more jumping and increased cardio intensity.  Although Tracey's cueing was sometimes a bit off, I was able to follow her in this workout.  In the second and third workouts, however, the choreography was much more complex, and I found Tracey's cueing to be less than adequate.  She began teaching each new combination slowly at first, but she does a lot of ""take-it-from-the-top"" instruction, and she frequently fails to cue things like number of repetitions, sequence changes, and left-right.  Both workouts contain plenty of kicking:  the second workout ends with a series of front kicks, and the third contains a segment which Tracey refers to as ""chicometrics"":  basically, squats with a knee lift or kick and then a jump to the reverse side.  There is no cool-down at all to the third kickboxing segment.The final abs segment begins with Pilates-type movements, including a bent knee roll-up, toe dips, the frog, and crunches; there are then a few seated stretches such as a spine stretch forward.  During the three kickboxing segments, there are several live drummers on stage, and Tracey instructs a class of approximately 6-8 others, but in the abs cool-down, Tracey works out alone to softer background music.  I would definitely not recommend this video for those new to kickboxing, as there is no instruction on form and many of the moves are difficult to follow.  This workout would probably be best suited to those who are familiar with the basics of kickboxing and who prefer complex, dance-y choreography.",3,"High energy, fun workout, but sometimes hard to follow",1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2150,"['Jab', 'Kick', 'Burn', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'three', '14-minute', 'kickboxing', 'segments', 'followed', '10-minute', 'abs-focused', 'cool-down', 'British', 'instructor', 'Tracey', 'Mallet', 'high', 'energy', 'level', 'Barbie-like', 'good', 'looks', 'definitely', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'workouts', 'encourages', 'do', 'same.The', 'first', 'kickboxing', 'section', 'was', 'favorite', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'slightly', 'dance-y', 'moves', 'Tracey', 'kicking', 'drills', 'then', 'slow', 'controlled', 'combos', 'were', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'raise', 'hear', 'rate', 'much', 'second', 'half', 'workout', 'more', 'jumping', 'increased', 'cardio', 'intensity', 'Tracey', 'cueing', 'was', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'workout', 'second', 'third', 'workouts', 'however', 'choreography', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'found', 'Tracey', 'cueing', 'be', 'less', 'adequate', 'began', 'teaching', 'new', 'combination', 'slowly', 'first', 'lot', 'take-it-from-the-top', 'instruction', 'frequently', 'cue', 'things', 'number', 'repetitions', 'sequence', 'changes', 'left-right', 'workouts', 'contain', 'plenty', 'kicking', 'second', 'workout', 'series', 'front', 'kicks', 'third', 'segment', 'Tracey', 'refers', 'chicometrics', 'basically', 'squats', 'knee', 'lift', 'kick', 'then', 'jump', 'reverse', 'side', 'cool-down', 'third', 'kickboxing', 'segment.The', 'final', 'abs', 'segment', 'Pilates-type', 'movements', 'including', 'bent', 'knee', 'roll-up', 'toe', 'dips', 'frog', 'crunches', 'are', 'then', 'few', 'seated', 'stretches', 'such', 'spine', 'stretch', 'forward', 'three', 'kickboxing', 'segments', 'are', 'several', 'live', 'drummers', 'stage', 'Tracey', 'class', 'approximately', '6-8', 'others', 'abs', 'cool-down', 'Tracey', 'out', 'alone', 'softer', 'background', 'music', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'video', 'new', 'kickboxing', 'instruction', 'form', 'many', 'moves', 'are', 'difficult', 'follow', 'workout', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'basics', 'kickboxing', 'who', 'prefer', 'complex', 'dance-y', 'choreography']","The Method - Jab, Kick & Burn VHS"

There are 3 segments on this tape, the first is mostly for beginners, and goes fairly slow with kicks and punches. The second section gets your heart rate up and is fun. The third section gets you sweating and out of breath but it is SO MUCH FUN! After I am done I feel like I've accomplished a great task.There is a lot of jumping around and squats/plie's so if you have bad knees, stay away.

There are three different cardio sections and an ab section.  There is no cool down for the cardio sections, so you go from a high heartrate and then it starts another section with tai chi.  There are also times that Tracey is off or does the wrong move and it could be confusing.Besides that, I really like the moves and it gets my heartrate up, I can get over the other things and warm up/cool down on my own.",3,Uneven workout,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,511,"['enjoy', 'workout', 'can', 'see', 'problems', ""n't"", 'much', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'are', 'three', 'different', 'cardio', 'sections', 'ab', 'section', 'cool', 'down', 'cardio', 'sections', 'go', 'high', 'heartrate', 'then', 'section', 'tai', 'chi', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'Tracey', 'off', 'wrong', 'move', 'could', 'be', 'confusing.Besides', 'really', 'moves', 'heartrate', 'can', 'get', 'other', 'things', 'warm', 'up/cool', 'down', 'own']","The Method - Jab, Kick & Burn VHS"
