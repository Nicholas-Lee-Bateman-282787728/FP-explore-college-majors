Rufus Sewell is nuanced and great (as always).  Gabriel Byrne gives a solid, masterful performance. Terence Maynard is really fabulous. And then we come to Toby Stephens.  Whether he was not up to the task or the writer/director George Isaac was lacking - it's hard to tell.  I tend to think it was a combination of the two. Toby Stephens acted in a range that ran the gamut (as Dorothy Parker has said) from A to B.  Not a chuckle in a carload.  Not an ounce of humor.  Not a bit of emotion. Ever. His acting had all the earmarks of someone who has just smelled something very nasty, but keeps that to himself. And all of that just about sank the movie.  The other actors - journeymen all - were up to the task.  Not Stephens. It was as though Isaac kept saying ""for God's sake don't smile!"" and ""No, we'll have to do it again - I think I saw you have a thought..."" and Stephens was just along for the ride. Too bad.

Teslovich,"[2, 2]","It only took a few minutes to see how bad this one was going to be.First, no subtitles and for anyone outside England - good luck getting most (even some) of what was said. Aussies, Canadians, Irish - again, good luck. Add the poor audio levels and even poor enunciation by London standards and it was torturous.Second, no special features. A good sign of cheap.Third, a whole bunch of pointless scenes in those opening minutes and found in countless crime movies, e.g. our main crook is in a hotel bedroom checking which, out of an arsenal of handguns, to buy. His test is to hold each gun outstretched and look down the barrel sight. Dumb! Then he meets with some guy and his girl with the camera focused on the girls crossed, under the table, legs. Dumb! Then he steals diamonds as easily as grocery shopping. Then he pours gasoline on his getaway car to burn the evidence. Tediously dumb! We get the usual burial scene with a hot chick dressed all in black with the usual sunglasses and off in the distance is the mysterious solitary figure watching the whole funeral. Pleease! The diamond exchange site is the usual garage loaded with expensive cars as the backdrop. How imaginative! Guy and girl in bed, about to do something, and guess what? Phone rings, time to go to work.Fourth, robotic acting, dialogue and not believable ending. A made for TV crime formula vibe.

In return for letting his son go, Parker wants Corso Sr to do him a favour by hiring another thief, Riley, played by Toby Stephens. This is a convoluted story of double cross by threes, and is very confusing.The storyline leaves a lot to be desired, but the screen shots of London, the insides and outsides of the city are well worth a look.
