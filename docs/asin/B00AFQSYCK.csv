I mean that in a good way. For, it kept me attention from start to finish and even then, I really did not see the end coming!!!The performances are pretty on par with other gay indie films. Taylor Caldwell does a nice job playing the mute character. He easily gets his story across through simple eye and facial expressions.LUNA PARK has a little of something for everyone, but is sure to please viewers that have a more &#34;twisted&#34; interest.I would actually like to see what happens next with this storyline, as it seems it can take off in any direction!!!The original short, ROSE & ALEXANDER, is included on the DVD as a bonus feature!",4,another dark entry,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1290,"['Steven', 'Vasquez', 'dark', 'entry', 'film', 'library', 'time', 'entitled', 'LUNA', 'PARK.LUNA', 'PARK', 'full', 'length', 'spin-off', 'award-winning', 'short', 'film', 'ROSE', 'ALEXANDER.LUNA', 'PARK', 'touches', 'Steven', 'Vasquez', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'are', 'layered', 'storylines', 'characters', 'crossing', 'paths', 'timeline', 'present', 'past', 'back', 'again', 'previous', 'films', 'SIREN', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'example', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'lost', 'journey.LUNA', 'PARK', 'moments', 'humor', 'overall', 'dark', 'story', 'hard', 'explain', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'secrets', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'kept', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'even', 'then', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'end', 'coming', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'par', 'other', 'gay', 'indie', 'films', 'Taylor', 'Caldwell', 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'mute', 'character', 'easily', 'story', 'simple', 'eye', 'facial', 'expressions.LUNA', 'PARK', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'sure', 'please', 'viewers', 'have', 'more', '34', 'twisted', '34', 'interest.I', 'would', 'actually', 'like', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'storyline', 'can', 'take', 'off', 'direction', 'original', 'short', 'ROSE', 'ALEXANDER', 'included', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'feature']",Luna Park

YET it has a definite plot with plenty of twists and turns and a surprise ending.  And you can tell by the way it was filmed that the team behind it actually cared about what they were creating even if the final result was over-the-top cheese.  it seemed like they were going for a noir piece, with plenty of dramatic flashbacks filmed in black and white, reavealing the leading lady's dirty family secrets.  But the acting was uneven at best.  Also, the frontal nudity cheapened the story.  I'm not a prude; I just don't think it was necessary for the story to succeed.  Still, I was strangely entranced--I just couldn't stop watching the darn thing!Two things I really liked:  1) The actor who plays Christopher (Christi), the mute young man who runs Luna Park, is compelling to watch.  He has a charisma about him that would really shine if he worked with an acting coach.

How somebody finagled to find the money to ever finish, let alone release such an extreme rats' nest of a movie; nor(b.)  What exactly kept me glued in slack-jawed astonishment at its sheer awfulness through to the very end.Luna Park does display a rare a sort of grim surrealism that strangely snared my fascination:  hence two stars rather than the one.  Or I could have it wrong entirely, and rather than the dregs of bottom-feeding, no-budget queer movies--of which the digital age has provided us a mind-rotting surplus--this is actually a work of mad genius, truly transgressive art far beyond the tepid efforts of an Ed Wood or a John Waters, vastly stranger stuff than any of those Brit ""Art Movies"" made by the likes of aPeter Greenawayor the lateDerek JarmanImagine, if you dare, a homo-dramatic telenovela--ostensibly in English, but with periodic and totally unexplained swerves into mangled faux-French (usually, but not exclusively, for conversations with God)--and I am only guessing the subject matter of the film here, about a fierce female media mogul/ex-porn megastar attended by swarms of very gay assistants who sporadically face the camera in utterly gratuitous full frontal nudity. All of that stuff is in English.  The French parts might be flashbacks.  The plot might involve a gay porn web-cam apartment complex owned by the vicious drama empress/media moguless, but theoretically managed by her mute (why?) and waifish younger brother (with ""serious emotional issues"" and Andy Warhol hair) who not only appears incapable of running his own hot dog cart, let alone a live porn site, but also in the climactic Big Reveal turns out to not be her brother, but really her secret second child, after she had inexplicably ""lost"" the first baby and furthermore one of these children may or may not have been sired by her brother (in which case the messed-up kid could be her nephew *and* her son, you know, sorta like Faye Dunaway's big scene at the end of Chinatown). Or maybe she was impregnated by her father? Or possibly it was the result of a rape? Who knows? One can only gather that Very Bad Things Happened. However, the who, why, or what dots are never connected from the extra-melodramatic back story to the events depicted on the screen.Please be my guest if you might be inclined to watch Luna Park a few more times and sort out not only whatever the earlier tragic deeds might have been, but also explain how they effect whatever is happening in this flick.  One suspects there might be a shorthand code acquired from years of watching daytime soap operas known only to true aficionados that magically renders these murky waters crystal clear, but leaves those of us not fluent in sudsy symbology scratching our heads, muttering ""what the frak . . . ?""  I'm not about to venture back myself, but I would be sincerely curious to know if there is actually a story embedded in such a surfeit of enigmas.The camera work and the editing are equally haphazard with neither of a quality up to par with the average Adult Entertainment Industry product. Apparently this is a conscious style choice in the service of enhancing the mood of the piece.  Nobody intentionally shoots such sloppy video.  As for the cast, I'll retreat to the safety of ""If you can't say anything nice . . .""  Apparently other reviewers here find the guys attractive. The Dragon Lady herself, weird dialogue aside, succeeds admirably in projecting a Not Very Nice Person. The biggest mystery of all, far more bewildering than either ""Who are these characters supposed to be?"" or ""What on earth are they doing?"" is how this total train wreck ever found its way to release not only on streaming video, but as also on DVD, which actually reqires real money upfront to pay for the disks and printing the artwork for the jewel boxes.  But what do I know about the market for pure, undiluted wall-to-wall sleaze?Do not forget there yet remains the possibility, albeit an exceedingly slim one, that the movie Luna Park is a work of tortured genius and future generations will revere it as a pinnacle of surrealistic expression on the outer frontiers of experimental cinema.  I mean William Borough's bookNaked Lunch(*not* to be confused with the David Cronenberg movie version, which was a lily-livered cop-out) makes no sense whatsoever either, also features lots of naked

Inconsistent editing too much time spent on unimportant details and not enough on important ones making the movie drag on forever. Acting was forced and heavy handed, but the actors were attractive and you got to see a lot of them, yep full frontal, that got me half way through the movie.
