Just throw George Clooney together with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Eliott Gould, Bernie Mack, Casey Affleck, Al Pacino, and Carl Reiner; add an impossible plot; and let them run from the starting gate. The plot is almost impossible to untangle, but it's a fun piece of nonsense nonetheless.  Ocean (Clooney) wants to win back the casino business to Reuben (Gould) whose rival is a casino hotel owner (Pacino).  The sabotage is multi-faceted and often can raise eyebrows.  (It seems that some of the work would have to be more slippery to escape detection, and the sabotage would have to be less costly than the payoffs might suggest.)  The film's methods at least give the venture some credibility, and the execution is too breezy to make us even care.  Often friendly and fun, 'Ocean's 13' has a message added to the mix in a way that doesn't seem tacked on but naturally fits into the story.",3,An Easy Bet,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,992,"['2', '1/2', '*', 'draw', 'gambling', 'caper', 'film', 'understandably', 'ensemble', 'Just', 'throw', 'George', 'Clooney', 'together', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Eliott', 'Gould', 'Bernie', 'Mack', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'add', 'impossible', 'plot', 'let', 'run', 'starting', 'gate', 'plot', 'almost', 'impossible', 'untangle', 'fun', 'piece', 'nonsense', 'nonetheless', 'Ocean', 'Clooney', 'win', 'back', 'casino', 'business', 'Reuben', 'Gould', 'rival', 'casino', 'hotel', 'owner', 'Pacino', 'sabotage', 'multi-faceted', 'often', 'can', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'slippery', 'escape', 'detection', 'sabotage', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'less', 'costly', 'payoffs', 'might', 'suggest', 'film', 'methods', 'least', 'give', 'venture', 'credibility', 'execution', 'too', 'breezy', 'make', 'even', 'care', 'Often', 'friendly', 'fun', '13', 'message', 'added', 'mix', 'way', ""n't"", 'seem', 'tacked', 'naturally', 'story']",N/A

1103597,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B000VQQJ8U,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[2, 4]","Ocean's Thirteen is a vast improvement over the disappointing Ocean's Twelve. Like the first Ocean movie, its set in Vegas and the plot such as it is, having only one setting to worry about means more time for the characters to interact, with each other, and also set in motion the revenge heist.Al Pacino is the big name added to the cast here, and I think it's his least intense performance for awhile. I got the impression he enjoyed not being the lead and had fun as Wily Banks, the villain of the piece - though in truth even the good guys are bad guys when you get down to it.As for the main gang, although Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Cheadle and Garcia are all good, the movie is actually stolen by Casey Affleck as Virgil. The little story he gets set in a Mexican factory not only is very funny, but nearly steals the movie. One of the things I've always admired about this series (and other big movie sagas), is the way they can get all the actors to return for each movie. For some movies, it could be due to being signed up for more as part of the deal, but here I think it's simply the fact they enjoy working together and it shows. The chemistry between them seems effortless, and also the fact that they like to poke fun at each other helps. Listen to the last exchange between Clooney and Pitt and you'll see what I mean!The actual plot about getting revenge when one of their numbers is cut out a big deal is not really that important. What's important is the fun you have simply getting to enjoy it being played out. It may not be up there with the first one, but as I mentioned, more than makes up for the disappointing sequel. If this is the end of the series, then it's a worthy finish.",4,Tight Script that recaptures the spirit of the original film,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,1701,"['Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'vast', 'improvement', 'disappointing', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'first', 'Ocean', 'movie', 'set', 'Vegas', 'plot', 'such', 'having', 'only', 'one', 'setting', 'worry', 'means', 'more', 'time', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'also', 'set', 'motion', 'revenge', 'heist.Al', 'Pacino', 'big', 'name', 'added', 'cast', 'here', 'think', 'least', 'intense', 'performance', 'awhile', 'got', 'impression', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'being', 'lead', 'had', 'fun', 'Wily', 'Banks', 'villain', 'piece', 'truth', 'even', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'it.As', 'main', 'gang', 'Clooney', 'Pitt', 'Damon', 'Cheadle', 'Garcia', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'actually', 'stolen', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Virgil', 'little', 'story', 'set', 'Mexican', 'factory', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'funny', 'nearly', 'movie', 'One', 'things', ""'ve"", 'always', 'admired', 'series', 'other', 'big', 'movie', 'sagas', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'actors', 'return', 'movie', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'being', 'signed', 'up', 'more', 'part', 'deal', 'here', 'think', 'simply', 'fact', 'enjoy', 'working', 'together', 'chemistry', 'effortless', 'also', 'fact', 'like', 'poke', 'fun', 'other', 'helps', 'Listen', 'last', 'exchange', 'Clooney', 'Pitt', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'actual', 'plot', 'getting', 'revenge', 'when', 'one', 'numbers', 'cut', 'out', 'big', 'deal', 'not', 'really', 'important', 'What', 'important', 'fun', 'have', 'simply', 'getting', 'enjoy', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'first', 'one', 'mentioned', 'more', 'up', 'disappointing', 'sequel', 'end', 'series', 'then', 'worthy', 'finish']",N/A

Nobody likes to see a guy screw his partner (not in the old days anyway maybe now things are different in the raw dog-eat dog world).

Danny (played by George Clooney) and Rusty (played by Brad Pitts) are once again called to right some Vegas wrongs in the film under review, Ocean&#8217;s 13.The plot line is simple-A friend, an old time casino owing friend and father figure for Danny and the boys (played by Eliot Gould) has been kicked the teeth by an up and coming Vegas hotel mogul (played by Al Pacino), and partner, who wants to make Vegas a more upscale place where Mom and Pop might not feel so comfortable but where the international jet set might want to land for a few days. So out goes the old bargain basement casino-hotels and in comes the new. And that is the kick in the teeth that Danny and friends try to avenge.

1103602,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000VQQJ8U,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","...I didn't!Okay, so I made it obvious with my review of `Ocean's Twelve', and before that with my review of `Ocean's Eleven', that I am really disappointed with the way these films have turned out.  With such an eclectic cast of big name, highly enjoyable stars you would think that these movies would be nothing short of amazing, but in actuality they have been rather boring, dull and forgettable.  They have even lacked any real charm.  I mean, these movies star George `king of charm' Clooney, not to mention Brad Pitt and yet they seem to fizzle as apposed to sizzle.That is about to change though.`Ocean's Thirteen' should have marked the beginning, not the end of the this franchise (I'm still scared they may try and pull of an `Ocean's Fourteen', and I'm not so certain they would fare this well again judging from their track record).  The film is witty, interesting, farfetched yet in an engaging and forgivable way, and get this; it has charm (thanks in large part to Matt Damon, who in my opinion was a weak link in the first two films).The film brings the boys back to Vegas where they attempt to outsmart (and bleed dry) a corrupt and dishonest hotelier named Bank who has cheated their friend Reuben, leaving him in the hospital.  Danny and his crew concoct a harebrained (I mean really, heists like these are impossible and totally preposterous to consider as valid) scheme to rob this man blind.  In the process they enlist the help of Terry Benedict, leaving their jilted past aside in order to ruin a man who has damaged them all.The scheme they concoct is probably the easiest of the three to follow and despite it's impossibility they make it seem almost probable (don't even try to attempt this at home).  Regardless of the fact that it is stupid to believe this can be done, the whole idea is rather neat and each and every part of the ultimate equation is fun to watch them work out.The acting is far better than the previous films as well.  Clooney is in even less of this movie than he was in `Twelve' (has this become Pitt's vehicle?) but when he is on, he is dashing.  Pitt is also charming, more so than the previous films, but it is Matt Damon that really takes this film to another level.  Maybe he was upset that `Twelve' used him so sparingly, and practically made him a laughingstock, so he decided that this time he wanted to be front and center.  Well, whoever decided it, it was a smart decision.  He adds something fresh to this movie, something that Pitt or Clooney could not.  Another surprise was Pacino, who sinks his teeth into his hammy role with so much charisma and grace.  I just loved him here.  Ellen Barkin is fetching as Banks' partner in crime, and David Paymer is devastatingly hilarious as the casino's VUP.  I really wish that there would have been more Izzard or Cheadle, but I cannot complain too much, for this film is so much more than I imagined it would be.It is still far from perfect.  I am not a fan of Soderbergh's muted use of color.  I mentioned this in my review of `Twelve'.  These films needed to be vibrant and colorful and he insists on giving almost every scene a yellowy tint.  I just don't like that very much.  I was just in Vegas a few weeks ago, and everything pops out at you.  For some reason Soderbergh doesn't get that.Still, I can honestly say that this is a pretty decent movie, and one that I would watch again without hesitation.  I only wish they had started with this and built up from it, instead of starting at the bottom, dropping below the bottom and then scrounging up something good for a final pow-wow.  It would have been really cool to have three films this engaging on the roster, but alas, at least we have one.",4,Just when I thought I was going to hate this movie...,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,3712,"['did', ""n't"", 'Okay', 'made', 'obvious', 'review', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'review', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'am', 'really', 'disappointed', 'way', 'films', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'such', 'eclectic', 'cast', 'big', 'name', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'stars', 'would', 'think', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'actuality', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'boring', 'dull', 'forgettable', 'have', 'even', 'lacked', 'real', 'charm', 'mean', 'movies', 'star', 'George', 'king', 'charm', 'Clooney', 'not', 'mention', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'yet', 'seem', 'fizzle', 'apposed', 'sizzle.That', 'change', 'though.', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'should', 'have', 'marked', 'beginning', 'not', 'end', 'franchise', ""'m"", 'still', 'scared', 'may', 'try', 'pull', 'Ocean', 'Fourteen', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'certain', 'would', 'fare', 'well', 'again', 'judging', 'track', 'record', 'film', 'witty', 'interesting', 'farfetched', 'yet', 'engaging', 'forgivable', 'way', 'get', 'charm', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'opinion', 'was', 'weak', 'link', 'first', 'two', 'films', '.The', 'film', 'boys', 'back', 'Vegas', 'where', 'attempt', 'outsmart', 'bleed', 'dry', 'corrupt', 'dishonest', 'hotelier', 'named', 'Bank', 'who', 'cheated', 'friend', 'Reuben', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'Danny', 'crew', 'harebrained', 'mean', 'really', 'heists', 'are', 'impossible', 'totally', 'preposterous', 'consider', 'valid', 'scheme', 'rob', 'man', 'blind', 'process', 'enlist', 'help', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'leaving', 'jilted', 'aside', 'order', 'ruin', 'man', 'who', 'damaged', 'all.The', 'scheme', 'concoct', 'probably', 'easiest', 'three', 'follow', 'impossibility', 'make', 'almost', 'probable', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'attempt', 'home', 'Regardless', 'fact', 'stupid', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'whole', 'idea', 'rather', 'neat', 'part', 'ultimate', 'equation', 'fun', 'watch', 'work', 'out.The', 'acting', 'far', 'better', 'previous', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Clooney', 'even', 'less', 'movie', 'was', 'Twelve', 'become', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', 'when', 'dashing', 'Pitt', 'also', 'charming', 'more', 'so', 'previous', 'films', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'really', 'film', 'level', 'Maybe', 'was', 'upset', 'Twelve', 'used', 'so', 'sparingly', 'practically', 'made', 'laughingstock', 'decided', 'time', 'wanted', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'Well', 'whoever', 'decided', 'was', 'smart', 'decision', 'something', 'fresh', 'movie', 'something', 'Pitt', 'Clooney', 'could', 'not', 'surprise', 'was', 'Pacino', 'who', 'teeth', 'hammy', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'charisma', 'grace', 'just', 'loved', 'here', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'fetching', 'Banks', 'partner', 'crime', 'David', 'Paymer', 'devastatingly', 'hilarious', 'casino', 'VUP', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Izzard', 'Cheadle', 'can', 'not', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'imagined', 'would', 'be.It', 'still', 'far', 'perfect', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Soderbergh', 'muted', 'use', 'color', 'mentioned', 'review', 'Twelve', 'films', 'needed', 'be', 'vibrant', 'colorful', 'giving', 'almost', 'scene', 'yellowy', 'tint', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'just', 'Vegas', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'everything', 'pops', 'out', 'reason', 'Soderbergh', ""n't"", 'get', 'that.Still', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'hesitation', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'started', 'built', 'up', 'instead', 'starting', 'bottom', 'dropping', 'bottom', 'then', 'scrounging', 'up', 'something', 'good', 'final', 'pow-wow', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'cool', 'have', 'three', 'films', 'engaging', 'roster', 'alas', 'least', 'have', 'one']",N/A

As a result, Reuben has a heart attack and ends up bedridden and ill, too depressed to fight back.So Ocean (George Clooney) and pals decide to get back at Bank in revenge, and to perk Reuben up.Bank is opening a new casino, and really, really wants the Five Diamonds Award. He's even got the diamonds on display. Ocean's plan isn't to steal from the casino this time, so much as it is to make sure that the casino loses money. A lot of money. And to ensure that he doesn't get the Five Diamonds Award.There's a lot of high-tech scheming and running around to rig all the games, including a trip to a Mexican factory that makes dice that launches a hilarious subplot, but eventually they run into a snag and have to bring in Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). The price for Benedict's help? The diamonds. Which they've already concluded they can't steal.So it's impossible--business as usual for this crew.It's a very fast-moving film, and I just gave up on trying to catch everything.

After the ruthless and arrogant Bank suggests that Reuben ""rolls over and dies"", Danny and his team decide to take the Bank's stunning new casino out of business on the big opening night. The third Ocean's movie is great fun and a wonderful mixture of genres that works as comedy/crime/thriller/revenge. Vegas is spectacular. The jokes are funny, the dialogs are witty, the directing is first class with the split screens, unusual angles, and the camera that always moves fast but does not rush. The acting is terrific. The absence of Julia Roberts and Katherine Zeta Jones is more than compensated by the presence of great Ellen Barkin who is a better actress than two and a hot beautiful woman, the real ""cougar"". Besides Ocean and his Eleven (who all have fun with their parts but this time Carl Reiner was simply outstanding), it was great to see David Paymer as an unlucky (or was he?) hotel reviewer and Eddie Izzard as a famous computer hacker. Did I mention that Al Pacino took the role of Willie Bank and he was excellent playing in his quiet mode without screaming which I like a lot? There are certainly the holes in the story and the absence of logic but I did not care a bit. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not about logic or plausibility or realism, it is all about fun and entertaining and it entertains admirably.

I've got this three-pack of Ocean movies so I bit the bullet and put &#34;Ocean's Thirteen&#34; on for late night entertainment. Well, it was back to Las Vegas and that was a relief. Hmmm.

The photography was good enough that it actually made Las Vegas look rather good. How do they do that? Have you ever been to Las Vegas? Have you ever looked at the city out and away from the tourist area? Well here I go drifting away from the movie again. I guess that's just how the movie went. Boring. I just couldn't keep my mind on it. My wrist watch seemed to be more interesting. It was something about stealing diamonds and such. And there was a lot of effort devoted to shorting the casino. And there was an earthquake machine. Oh hell, the production values were high and everything was well done. I just wish some more work couldn't have gone into the script.

1103638,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000VQQJ8U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and the rest of the cool bunch are at it again. This time, in OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, it's even more personal as one of their own is unceremoniously victimized which results in his suffering a near fatal stroke. One of Ocean's elder partners in crime, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), against the advice of his friends, decides to go into a business venture with Willie Bank (Al Pacino, in very good form) as they build a new hotel in Las Vegas, called the Midas. Willie Bank has the rep for being two-faced and for pulling the rug out of his partners, but Reuben discounts it. This is a humongous mistake as Reuben is abruptly forced out of the partnership, and, to add insult to injury, the name of the hotel is changed from the Midas to the Bank. Soon, Ocean and the gang congregate in the hospital around Reuben's comatose figure and decide to get payback for the man. Six months later, the con to break the Bank begins.Watching this film series is like thumbing thru an issue of People Magazine or the Hollywood Reporter, there's so many stars to gawk at. Given, the love interests, Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones, are regrettably absent because, as Ocean puts it, ""It's not their fight."" So, not much chance for a proper romance in this one, although Linus gets a half-hearted crack at it. But everyone else is back. The cast chemistry is still very much intact, especially between Clooney and Pitt, who've kind of become soul mates or something. Andy Garcia also returns as the reptilian Terry Benedict, who apparently has a beef against Willie Bank, and the actor makes the most of what is effectively an extended cameo. Matt Damon's Linus, still seeking the approval of basically everyone around him, gets a larger part in the con this time. The great Don Cheadle, again with the Cockney accent, and Ellen Barkin, she of the unconventional sexy looks, are both not used enough. And the bad guy? Well, everyone knows that a movie greatly benefits from a credible and worthy antagonist, and when this antagonist dares to put down Frank Sinatra, the deity of Las Vegas, well, then, you just know it's merely a matter of time before this guy enters a dimension of unmitigated misery and comeuppance. Accordingly, Al Pacino comes in full ruthless businessman regalia and delivers yet another strong and hissable performance. Meanwhie, character actor David Paymer is endlessly amusing as the pranked-upon hotel V.U.P. (Very Unimportant Person). Poor dude.Let's hearken back a bit. I absolutely loved the OCEAN'S ELEVEN remake, which I thought vastly improved on Sinatra and his rat pack's original. I even enjoyed OCEAN'S TWELVE, despite its rambling narrative and self-congratulatory reek. OCEAN'S THIRTEEN isn't as good as ELEVEN but is better and more focused than TWELVE. This isn't a bonafide thriller, of course, there's no real sense of jeopardy here. You know there'll be close scrapes but, no worries, everything'll come up roses for the good guys and go snake eyes for the villains. Director Steven Soderbergh again keeps the tone playful and breezy, the film propelled by hip, ritzy music and a plot that's constantly on the move. Yes, the movie ventures down a predictable and well traveled avenue, but enough plot complications are woven in that it remains interesting. As usual, the meticulously planned out scheme doesn't perfectly play out (it never does), and Ocean, Rusty, et al. must resolve upcropping obstacles on the fly: A Mexican factory which manufactures casino dice goes on strike (fomented, ironically, by one of the 13); the crew runs short of finances and must resort to enlisting the loathed Terry Benedict, who then demands that an impregnably guarded cache of diamonds be pilfered; and there's even a callback to a character in the first sequel. However, the most problematic dilemma may well be the artificial intelligence which is housed in Willie Bank's security system.I don't think we'll ever see the likes of Jack Black or Jon Heder as members of this sexy and glamourous crew. Clooney, Pitt, and Damon all belong to Hollywood's sleek and beautiful in-crowd, and OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, like the prior two films, exudes a pervading sense of ""Hey, look at all of us looking pretty and being cool here."" Affecting nonchalant poses, delivering lines with off-the-cuff verve, and engaging in celebrity inside jokes - there's a lot of that going around in the film. The sense of elbow nudging fun is very much alive as we see Matt Damon sporting a proboscis and attempting to down a drink, Clooney derisively rolling his eyes at Garcia (we've all seen the trailer), and Clooney and Pitt viewing an Oprah episode with moist eyes. I also liked Ocean's eventual revenge on/pay off to Terry Benedict. This series, when boiled to its essence, is just a bunch of boys (and girls) hanging out, goofing around, and enjoying each other's company. But, unlike TWELVE, I'm glad to note that the actors seem more invested into the story here, perhaps because, this time, there actually is a story. So, despite that feeling of having seen all this before, OCEAN'S THIRTEEN is eminently watchable and rates 2 snake eyes from me.",4,"""Peligroso es mi nombre medio."",",1181433600,"06 10,

The idea is always the same: to make a break-in or a burglary that is by principle impossible. In this case the impossibility is some extremely sophisticated digitalized security system protecting a casino in Las Vegas. How can a bunch of burglars manage to enter the system and pervert it in order to get even with the boss of that casino who was not honest with a partner that he forced into bankruptcy and retirement, with a good heart attack along with it. The vengeance is absolutely savage and wild. And that is absolutely brilliant, though of course impossible. The plot is just tinkering about to get to the target and objective and that is all. No real logic, no real meaning, no real believability. The more farfetched, the better. And more than farfetched it is at times. And yet here and there, there is a punch-line or a remark that is tilting the scales towards some meaningfulness, like the strike in Mexico for a 3.5 dollar rise a week, but it is evanescent and quick, like a good big wink at the audience, if they are not too far gone away in their intellectual slumber. So the vengeance is of course consumed and reached totally. The bad casino boss is pushed down the stairs, loses five hundred millions and three or four sets of two hundred and fifty million dollar each diamond necklaces. All together he must have lost in about ten minutes something like 1.5 billion dollars. Funny but where is the moral of the story?

1103642,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000VQQJ8U,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 8]","Well not that great. The story is entertaining and simple enough. Ocean's 13 are all about the cast of characters, their chemistry together, and their interactions with each other. Returning director Steven Soderbergh excitedly plays and toys with the camera with different angles, different kinds of shots, wide variety of lengths of shots, and even borrowing a technique that was made famous in Fight Club. While its nothing experimental, Soderbergh does a good job showcasing a story using a variety of techniques so the movie never even considers looking stale. Completing the directing is a sort of old-school vibe that accompanies the soundtrack. It begins to look so dated that you might expect even Sinatra to make an appearance.Pacing is what turn-off some moviegoers, and pretty much what destroyed Ocean's 12 (despite the unforgivable plot). Unlike recent third installments, the pacing here remains consistent, and for the most part works well. The majority of Ocean's 13 is setting up the grand scheme, which ranges from an underground bunker in Nevada to a factory in Mexico. The third act is when the plan starts getting off the ground, and the payoff is definitely great for the audience and the lucky cast of gamblers unaware of what is about to unfold.Bottom Line: Despite some missing members of before (where'd all the women go?) Ocean's 13 is good and everything that made the original a surprise smash. The chemistry among the crew remains intact, but now we have a different story to follow, and a better heist to capture on film. Capturing all the merriment is Soderbergh, who once again excels in putting his distinct methods of film-making to good use as he contributes a dosage of style, color and old-school flavor to the movie. The ending leaves the door open for more, and as long as they remain as entertaining as this, why shouldn't we continue the series? Clooney, Damon, and especially Brad Pitt seem to have a lot of fun robbing people and screwing around. Whatever happened to the good-ol' days of classic, one-track storytelling anyway? 13 had nothing surprising.

It was hard to follow with too much camera movements and handheld camera usesage. Ocean's 13 is about as slick and cool as the original though. The gang rejoin to hit a greedy Casino owner's new Casino. He's played by Al Pacino  who ripped off one of their own played by Elliott Gould. Gould doesn't take it too well, infact it almost kills him. So the gang is back but for revenge this time around. It's not a thick plot but it's more of a plot than Ocean's 12 had anyway.Everyone is back from the original but Julia Roberts and I think her character is just mentioned by Brad Pitt once but not by name. The film is entertaining enough to easily forget about her though. It's stylish and cool and yes there's some good laughs as well. What's funnier and interesting than the actual robbery is them doing everything they can to make sure the new hotel/Casino gets rated bad. They do this by making the guy who rates the place stay there horrible in anyway they can. It's also pretty funny how Clooney watches Opera and gets teared up when a house is built for a family on her show.

Ocean's 13 isn't much of an improvement over Ocean's 12, not by much at least. It was like watching a dull, dry documentary and it was difficult to pay attention. Much of the same jokes and cons were done again from the prior two films which contributed to the boredom. I found the bar room casino jazz soundtrack to play much like elevator music, it was monotonous and tiresome as well as the dialog. There wasn't anything terribly original about this third installment of the Ocean's 11 franchise/trilogy, in fact...as a viewer it was insulting. In my opinion, Ocean's 11 was and is the only film worthy of watching. It was a good reinvention of a classic which featured the original ""Rat Pack"".Unfortunately Oceans 13 (just like Ocean's 12) suffer from what many other film franchises have before them. The lack of originality and what you have is a repeat of the same original film that did so well and was so entertaining, but flops in its retelling with only a few additions and tweaks to barely make a plot. I wouldn't rent this film, let alone Ocean's 12 ever again and I certainly wouldn't buy it. Despite the all star cast, many of who are actor's I enjoy seeing on screen, Ocean's 13 just doesn't have it, nor does it pack the punch promised from viewing the trailers early this past summer.

Surprisingly, Ocean's Thirteen is a step up from the previous film--which was pretty boring by the way. This time around, everything is bigger--the stakes, money and casinos. It has its minor flaws, but it was much better than expected.Brief Story Intro:Successful, and very arrogant, casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) double-crosses one of the original eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould). The evil Mr. Bank basically ruins him economically and mentally--All of this to build his new monster casino in Las Vegas. Reuben is so devastated by his loss that he suffers a nervous breakdown and he is unable to speak. It is time to get even. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) finds all this insulting and gathers the rest of the gang to plan an attack to ruin Will Bank. The task won't be easy. They will face new obstacles along the way--even a super computer similar to the one from Superman III. Also, they'll need to team up with an old nemesis Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to get the job done.Review:More dynamic and entertaining than the 2004 sequel, Ocean's Thirteen follows the same old formula, but has all the right ingredients to keep you entertain. We enjoy the same old chemistry between the characters, double-crosses, jokes and new plans to ruin Bank's business--this time they have to penetrate a state-of-the-art hotel & casino with an artificial intelligence super computer. Some might find the plot a bit silly and hard to follow, especially with all their new plans to scam the casino--which are more elaborated this time around. But towards the end of the movie, everything starts to make sense and perhaps will put a smile in your face.These are A-class actors who give us great performances. But the actor who really got my attention is Andy Garcia who is more charismatic and entertaining than before--in my opinion, he did a much better job than superstar Al Pacino who played his same old character. I also enjoyed the cinematography which is more colorful than the previous films.But there are things that should have been done to make the film more entertaining. First of all, the movie is a bit long (2 hours). Yes, there are some draggy moments, but they are not that big of an issue, at least for me.

1103654,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000VQQJ8U,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","In 2001, director Steven Soderbergh brought us the re-imagining of the Rat Pack classic ""Ocean's Eleven"", and then in 2004, he followed it up with the not nearly as entertaining sequel ""Ocean's Twelve"". Three years later Soderbergh, and most of his original cast from the previous two films, returned one more time for ""Ocean's Thirteen"". For a franchise that has seen one great movie and one not-so great in its franchise's relatively short existence, one must wonder how the third effort will turn out. Will ""Ocean's Thirteen"" bring back the fun and excitement of the first film, or continue to falter under its own self-importance as ""Ocean's Twelve"" did?""Ocean's Thirteen"" begins with a member of Danny's crew being swindled out of a share of profits in a new Las Vegas hotel by a nefarious businessman named Willy Bank (Al Pacino). Now, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and company want retribution for their deceived comrade, but to succeed they will have to pull off their most daring job yet.Screenwriting duo Brian Koppelman and David Levien (""Knockaround Guys"") bring back to the ""Ocean's"" franchise something that had been sorely missed in its second outing... all of the fun. This time around, not only is the script much more in the vein of the first film, but the entertainment value is nearly as high as it was the first go-round. With the clever comebacks, the wit, and an overall feel good atmosphere, none of which ever decreased the interesting and entertaining nature of ""Ocean's Eleven"", this latest installment brings the series back from the doldrums that ensnared it throughout the lesser-entertaining ""Ocean's Twelve"".While the fun of the series has been revived that is not to say that this movie is lacking in any sort of drama. The story for ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is the most intimate the series has ever been. By placing the Ocean's crew in a position where one of theirs has been wronged and thus their newest job is driven purely by retribution from the get-go creates a fresh, new twist for what could have been an all-too familiar tale. One other aspect of this film's story that one will notice when watching the movie is that there appears to be a sense of finality to the series' various character arcs. I have heard that this is intended to be the final film in the franchise, at least with this cast, and if so, I appreciate the efforts made in the screenplay to bring resolution to not only the characters, but also the various plot threads that have existed since the first film. If this is indeed the final chapter for Danny Ocean and his crew, then this was a very satisfying and enjoyable ending to the series.Reprising their roles from the previous two films are essentially everybody that we have become familiar with since 2001; however, Julia Roberts and previous newcomer Catherine Zeta-Jones are noticeably absent from the proceedings. Aside from those two missing assets, everyone else is back, and arguably better than ever. I was especially pleased to discover that the fast-paced repartee amongst the characters, primarily between Danny (George Clooney) and Rusty (Brad Pitt), was back in full force, and just as fluid and smartly crafted as before.From my perspective as a fan of the series, despite the low point of ""Ocean's Twelve"", one of the highlights in the cast has remained Matt Damon's character of Linus. Damon's portrayal of Linus has evolved naturally over the course of the previous two films, culminating in this one with the audience finally getting to see Linus in a capacity that rivals Danny or Rusty in terms of respect, usefulness, and skill. Another highlight of the cast would be Carl Reiner who had been somewhat under-utilized in the previous two films; this time around he is given much more to do with his character. His comedic timing and immersion into the character is great, and he proves that even at his age he can easily keep up with his much younger co-stars.Of course, when discussing the cast of ""Ocean's Thirteen"" one would be remiss not to mention the terrific performances from the two newcomers to the series, Al Pacino (""The Godfather"") and Ellen Barkin (""Sea of Love""). These two enduring talents are extremely fun to watch in this film as both clearly appear to be enjoying themselves on camera. Ellen Barkin is perfect in the role of the seductive assistant to Al's Willy Bank character. Ellen takes a character that should have been a fairly one-dimensional role and turned her into a complex, modern woman who is nearly as ruthless as her boss.However, it was Al Pacino's performance that was the most surprising to me. I know it sounds strange to say that Al Pacino gave a surprising performance, I mean let's face it the guy is a legend, but it's because of how low-key he was in this role when compared to some of his work from the last 10 to 15 years that I can say that. Here's an actor that has become heavily parodied by today's comedians because of his penchant for yelling his lines at random, and yet, in this film I can hardly recall a single instance where he really cut loose with the volume. Along with his reserved performance, Pacino delivers a character in Willy Bank that is so slimy, distrustful, and utterly narcissistic that you instantly hate him, but at the same time there's something about the role that is flat-out entertaining. Honestly, Al's portrayal of Willy Bank in ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is some of the best work he's done of late and is vastly superior to his less-than-stellar performances in ""Righteous Kill"" and ""88 Minutes"".""Ocean's Thirteen"" is an incredibly fun heist movie that brings the trilogy full circle, wrapping up the various threads in a very satisfying manner. Although not quite as good as the first film in the series, ""Thirteen"" is a very close second and more than makes up for the shortcomings of its predecessor.""Ocean's Thirteen"" is rated PG-13 for language.",4,Thirteen Brings Back the Fun of the Series...,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,5904,"['2001', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'brought', 're-imagining', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'classic', 'Ocean',

Willy led Reuben to believe he would be his partner in Willy's new Las Vegas Casino.  Willy double-crossed Reuben which caused Reuben to have a heart attack.

The condition was Danny & the guys have to steal a diamond necklace that Willy has in a display case.  Willy had received this necklace the year before as a prize for winning the Best Casino award.  Terry Benedict wanted to get this necklace because he knew how much it meant to Willy.

Nobody takes it too seriously, yet there's a lot of quality here, both in the easy humor and interplay of the cast, and in the occasionally spectacular cinematography by Soderbergh. Even the script is quite good.What isn't good is the transfer to both dvd and blu-ray. I watched the dvd and was amazed at how washed out and grainy it was, so I rented the BD, and it was no better. The only positive is that the crappy transfer saturates the colors even more than they already are, and it suits Soderbergh's splashy, neon vision of Vegas quite well.The real star here is the camera, and it's used to perfection, sweeping down gleaming hallways and floating over the very nicely CGI'ed Bank Hotel. SS has become a very sharp director, getting fine performances from all his actors while framing them, the town, and its cheesy architecture in a style reminiscent of both the best noir and '70s crime flicks. The music echoes it all and Ocean's 13 becomes quite a pleasure to watch if you're a fan of either of those genres.You need to turn off your logic filter, though, as the plot has endless holes, but none of this is meant to be taken too seriously. Pacino gets this and turns in a very funny performance in its own edgy way. Ditto for Barkin. In fact, everybody in the movie is fun to watch, and Pitt and Clooney make a truly great team. You can imagine the fun these guys all had shooting this in Vegas and it shows up on screen. There are plenty of laughs to go around and it's all a breezy good time.Pure fluff, but very entertaining fluff done with technical brilliance, O13 is well worth seeing if you like any of these actors, great cinematography, Vegas, and crime capers in general. Even the weak transfer is easy to let go of; it adds its own grainy color and in some ways fits in just fine.",4,"Beautifully shot, pleasantly goofy film suffers only mildly from poor transfers on both dvd and blu-ray",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,1870,"['4.3', 'starsI', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'was', 'Nobody', 'too', 'seriously', 'yet', 'lot', 'quality', 'here', 'easy', 'humor', 'interplay', 'cast', 'occasionally', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'Soderbergh', 'Even', 'script', 'quite', 'good.What', ""n't"", 'good', 'transfer', 'dvd', 'blu-ray', 'watched', 'dvd', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'washed', 'out', 'grainy', 'was', 'rented', 'BD', 'was', 'better', 'only', 'positive', 'crappy', 'transfer', 'colors', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'are', 'suits', 'Soderbergh', 'splashy', 'neon', 'vision', 'Vegas', 'quite', 'well.The', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'camera', 'used', 'perfection', 'sweeping', 'down', 'gleaming', 'hallways', 'floating', 'very', 'nicely', ""CGI'ed"", 'Bank', 'Hotel', 'SS', 'become', 'very', 'sharp', 'director', 'getting', 'fine', 'performances', 'actors', 'framing', 'town', 'cheesy', 'architecture', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'best', 'noir', ""'70s"", 'crime', 'flicks', 'music', 'Ocean', '13', 'quite', 'pleasure', 'watch', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genres.You', 'need', 'turn', 'off', 'logic', 'filter', 'though', 'plot', 'endless', 'holes', 'none', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'Pacino', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'own', 'edgy', 'way', 'Ditto', 'Barkin', 'fact', 'everybody', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'Pitt', 'Clooney', 'make', 'truly', 'great', 'team', 'can', 'imagine', 'fun', 'guys', 'had', 'shooting', 'Vegas', 'up', 'screen', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'go', 'around', 'breezy', 'good', 'time.Pure', 'fluff', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fluff', 'done', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'O13', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'actors', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Vegas', 'crime', 'capers', 'general', 'Even', 'weak', 'transfer', 'easy', 'let', 'go', 'own', 'grainy', 'color', 'ways', 'fits', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

However, in spite of all that good stuff, I was still disappointed with this film. The first hour or so really dragged for me. There aren't a whole lot of subplots going on like in the first two films, and everyone's attention is focused on the technical details of planning the scam, which gets kind of old after a while. The fact that the characters of Tess and Isabel are absent from this film also takes away from everything. I knew that Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones weren't slated to appear in the film, but I was still hoping for a cameo, at least. There weren't really any fun cameos in this movie, unlike the first two films, which was a major bummer. Many of the jokes didn't seem as funny this time around, and although the pace really picked up once the con officially was underway, it just wasn't as fun of a movie as the first two were.Another complaint I have about ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is that it's an incredibly predictable movie. Everyone knows that no one's going to trump Danny Ocean and his crew, and even when seemingly unbeatable obstacles spring up or integral characters start getting arrested, we know it's all part of the plan and that the scam will go off without a hitch. Many of the casino staff members and FBI officials are in on the scheme, too, but that wasn't a surprise at all because the same trick was used in the first two films on multiple occasions.Still, all my griping aside, I enjoyed the film. Things really picked up after the first hour or so, and there are some very funny scenes in the movie (unfortunately, though, I think most of them ran in the trailer). The Danny/Rusty/Oprah crying scene is hilarious, as is the little ""inside joke"" scene at the very end with Pitt and Clooney. All of the actors did a great job. Pacino is a very nice addition to the cast, as is Ellen Barkin, although I think her character was kind of watered down and could have been a lot stronger. Also, the Vegas shots are great. I especially like the scene where Rusty and Danny are conversing outside of the Bellagio: there are some beautiful shots of the Strip in this film, which makes Vegas lovers like myself very happy.Ultimately, I think the main problem with this film is that the script is very weak, which is a shame. Fortunately, everything manages to come together in the end, and Clooney and his costars make the movie entertaining to watch.",4,"Not the best film in the series, but still fun",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,3303,"['Ocean', 'Eleven', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'quite', 'enjoyable.In', 'latest', 'Ocean', 'adventure', 'gang', 'together', 'vile', 'casino', 'owner', 'Willy', 'Bank', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Reuben', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Led', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'con', 'men', 'devise', 'massive', 'plot', 'rig', 'Willy', 'new', 'casino', 'opening', 'night', 'cause', 'house', 'lose', 'three', 'half', 'minutes', 'straight', 'thus', 'breaking', 'Willy', 'Bank', 'bank.The', 'premise', 'story', 'great', 'love', 'fact', 'scam', 'set', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'time', 'group', 'forced', 'enlist', 'help', 'longtime', 'nemesis', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'fun', 'new', 'twist', 'situation', 'However', 'spite', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'still', 'disappointed', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'really', 'dragged', 'are', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'subplots', 'going', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'everyone', 'attention', 'focused', 'technical', 'details', 'planning', 'scam', 'kind', 'old', 'while', 'fact', 'characters', 'Tess', 'Isabel', 'are', 'absent', 'film', 'also', 'away', 'everything', 'knew', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'were', ""n't"", 'slated', 'appear', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'hoping', 'cameo', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'fun', 'cameos', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'major', 'bummer', 'Many', 'jokes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'funny', 'time', 'pace', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'once', 'con', 'officially', 'was', 'underway', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fun', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'complaint', 'have', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'incredibly', 'predictable', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'one', 'going', 'trump', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'crew', 'even', 'when', 'seemingly', 'unbeatable', 'obstacles', 'spring', 'up', 'integral', 'characters', 'start', 'getting', 'arrested', 'know', 'part', 'plan', 'scam', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'hitch', 'Many', 'casino', 'staff', 'members', 'FBI', 'officials', 'are', 'scheme', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'same', 'trick', 'was', 'used', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'multiple', 'occasions.Still', 'griping', 'aside', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Things', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'think', 'most', 'ran', 'trailer', 'Danny/Rusty/Oprah', 'crying', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'little', 'joke', 'scene', 'very', 'end', 'Pitt', 'Clooney', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Pacino', 'very', 'nice', 'addition', 'cast', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'think', 'character', 'was', 'kind', 'watered', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'stronger', 'Also', 'Vegas', 'shots', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Rusty', 'Danny', 'are', 'conversing', 'Bellagio', 'are', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'Strip', 'film', 'Vegas', 'lovers', 'very', 'happy.Ultimately', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'script', 'very', 'weak', 'shame', 'Fortunately', 'everything', 'manages', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'Clooney', 'costars', 'make', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'watch']",N/A
1103680,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000VQQJ8U,Mel Odom,"[14, 20]","Ocean's Thirteen brings back a star-studded cast headed by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon.  They are once more backed by Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, Shabao Qin, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, and Carl Reiner in great support roles.As always, Danny Ocean (Clooney) co-leads with Rusty Ryan (Pitt) in a deadly, dangerous, and twisting con scheme. In the previous two movies, Ocean, Ryan, and the others have always been motivated by personal desires as well as financial ones. This time it's more personal. Reuben (Gould) has been beaten out of his fortune by Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who is planning to open the most impressive casino in Las Vegas.Willie Bank (And don't you just love the subtle name?  Will he bank?) has already been a successful casino owner/operator. All of his casinos before have earned the ""Five Diamonds Award"" of excellence. Bank expects no less this time. And he shut Ruben out of the deal so than the glamour - not to mention the profit - can all be his.Ocean and Rusty gather with the rest of the crew to pay their respects to Reuben and figure out what they are supposed to do to get their friend's fortune back. Reuben appears to have lost the will to live. As an act of courtesy, Ocean offers Bank a Billy Martin: a chance to redeem himself on his own and give the money back to Reuben. Of course if Bank had accepted the proposition the movie would have been much shorter.So Ocean and his team go to work. The con to get Reuben's money back is complicated and involves a lot of details. Some of it is realistic, but much of it lies in the realm of fantasy. Still, these movies are confection and are to be enjoyed just on their own.And they are probably also an excuse for the high-powered stars to get together and play.In Ocean's Eleven the mix was exactly right. The stars matched the story, and each of those stars got the chance to be an absolute scene-stealer.  The franchise stumbled badly in Ocean's Twelve because the movie seemed to lack a central focus. Some viewers even stated that the film had no plot at all.The plot in the latest film is apparent from the earliest scenes, but it seems like Clooney, Pitt, and the others are merely going through the paces, hitting their marks and delivering lines of dialogue that are often funny, but too often wide of the mark.  The story isn't as tight as the first one.In order to explain the premise of the con to the audience, Ocean and Ryan have to describe what they've got in place to a new con man that specializes in computer technology. He supposedly is the best at figuring out cybernetic systems. Bank's new casino is protected by an artificial intelligence. Which seems weird because the military evidently doesn't have those yet. And the fact that it's an artificial intelligence is never exploited in the film. It's just one of those near science fiction explanations to make the job supposedly harder.Part of the plan involves manufacturing dice made of a special polymer. One of the team (Affleck) goes undercover at the Mexican manufacturing plant where they're made to get the special polymer into the mix. While he's there, he ends up taking part in a mini-revolution of blue collar workers against white collar administration. This is truly one of the funnier bits in the film, but it feels a little out of place. It's a diversion that doesn't fit in with the Las Vegas scene that's going on. And even the special dice are not showcased that much later in the film.Moving the franchise back to Las Vegas seems to be a good idea, though. There's something about this city that just makes magic for these kind of shows.However, even at 1:53 running time, the movie feels a little long and sags some in the middle. Clooney and Pitt break up those sections with glimpses into their personal lives that are fun, but even those become noticeable as props to keep the plot flowing.I went to see the movie in the theater with my wife because that was where we'd seen the other two.  We wanted to see this one there.  It was a big improvement over the second movie, but it still didn't match expectations fostered by the first movie.  If you haven't seen Ocean's Thirteen yet, I'd suggest waiting for it on DVD and pick it up to complete your collection or to rent just to watch.",3,The Con Is On Again!,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,4293,"['Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'back', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'headed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'are', 'once', 'more', 'backed', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Shabao', 'Qin', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'great', 'support', 'roles.As', 'always', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'Clooney', 'co-leads', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'Pitt', 'deadly', 'dangerous', 'twisting', 'con', 'scheme', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'Ocean', 'Ryan', 'others', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'motivated', 'personal', 'desires', 'as', 'well', 'financial', 'ones', 'time', 'more', 'personal', 'Reuben', 'Gould', 'been', 'beaten', 'fortune', 'Willie', 'Bank', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'planning', 'open', 'most', 'impressive', 'casino', 'Las', 'Vegas.Willie', 'Bank', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'subtle', 'name', 'Will', 'bank', 'already', 'been', 'successful', 'casino', 'owner/operator', 'casinos', 'before', 'have', 'earned', 'Five', 'Diamonds', 'Award', 'excellence', 'Bank', 'less', 'time', 'shut', 'Ruben', 'deal', 'so', 'glamour', 'not', 'mention', 'profit', 'can', 'be', 'his.Ocean', 'Rusty', 'gather', 'rest', 'crew', 'pay', 'respects', 'Reuben', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'get', 'friend', 'fortune', 'back', 'Reuben', 'have', 'lost', 'will', 'live', 'act', 'courtesy', 'Ocean', 'Bank', 'Billy', 'Martin', 'chance', 'redeem', 'own', 'give', 'money', 'back', 'Reuben', 'course', 'Bank', 'had', 'accepted', 'proposition', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'shorter.So', 'Ocean', 'team', 'go', 'work', 'con', 'get', 'Reuben', 'money', 'back', 'complicated', 'lot', 'details', 'realistic', 'much', 'realm', 'fantasy', 'Still', 'movies', 'are', 'confection', 'are', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'own.And', 'are', 'probably', 'also', 'excuse', 'high-powered', 'stars', 'get', 'together', 'play.In', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'mix', 'was', 'exactly', 'right', 'stars', 'matched', 'story', 'stars', 'got', 'chance', 'be', 'absolute', 'scene-stealer', 'franchise', 'stumbled', 'badly', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'movie', 'seemed', 'lack', 'central', 'focus', 'viewers', 'even', 'stated', 'film', 'had', 'plot', 'all.The', 'plot', 'latest', 'film', 'apparent', 'earliest', 'scenes', 'Clooney', 'Pitt', 'others', 'are', 'merely', 'going', 'paces', 'hitting', 'marks', 'delivering', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'are', 'often', 'funny', 'too', 'often', 'wide', 'mark', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'tight', 'first', 'one.In', 'order', 'explain', 'premise', 'con', 'audience', 'Ocean', 'Ryan', 'have', 'describe', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'place', 'new', 'con', 'man', 'computer', 'technology', 'supposedly', 'best', 'figuring', 'out', 'cybernetic', 'systems', 'Bank', 'new', 'casino', 'protected', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'Which', 'weird', 'military', 'evidently', ""n't"", 'have', 'yet', 'fact', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'never', 'exploited', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'near', 'science', 'fiction', 'explanations', 'make', 'job', 'supposedly', 'harder.Part', 'plan', 'manufacturing', 'dice', 'made', 'special', 'polymer', 'One', 'team', 'Affleck', 'undercover', 'Mexican', 'manufacturing', 'plant', 'where', ""'re"", 'made', 'get', 'special', 'polymer', 'mix', 'there', 'up', 'taking', 'part', 'mini-revolution', 'blue', 'collar', 'workers', 'white', 'collar', 'administration', 'truly', 'one', 'funnier', 'bits', 'film', 'little', 'place', 'diversion', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'scene', 'going', 'even', 'special', 'dice', 'are', 'not', 'showcased', 'that', 'much', 'later', 'film.Moving', 'franchise', 'back', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'though', 'something', 'city', 'just', 'magic', 'kind', 'shows.However', 'even', '1:53', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'little', 'long', 'middle', 'Clooney', 'Pitt', 'break', 'up', 'sections', 'glimpses', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'fun', 'even', 'become', 'noticeable', 'props', 'keep', 'plot', 'flowing.I', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'wife', 'was', 'where', ""'d"", 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'wanted', 'see', 'one', 'there', 'was', 'big', 'improvement', 'second', 'movie', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'expectations', 'fostered', 'first', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'yet', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'pick', 'up', 'complete', 'collection', 'rent', 'just', 'watch']",N/A

1103683,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000VQQJ8U,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","I enjoyed Ocean's Twelve.  I skipped Ocean's Eleven.  I heard good things about Ocean's Thirteen, so I downloaded it.Ocean's Thirteen is supposed to be better than Twelve; the characters are emotionally invested in the plot (as opposed to the first movie, where they were apparently needed the money, I guess) because this time they're out for revenge. Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) invests in some properties only to have it forcibly taken from him in a move of Trumpian proportions by the nefarious Willie Bank (Al Pacino).  Poor Tishkoff suffers...a stroke? A broken heart?  Some kind of nondescript medical condition that leaves him bed-ridden? Our boys are loaded with cash, so it's just a matter of humiliating Bank, returning the property to Tishkoff, and making a quick buck in the process.The fact that they have to ally with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is supposed to make the movie even more hilarious.  But it doesn't matter, because our heroes take it in stride.  In fact, there's never a moment in the film when we actually feel like things might go sour.There's a lot of problems with Ocean's Thirteen, not the least of which is the superhero status of our Justice League of Swinging Hip Guys.  There's too many of them. They're all really rich at this point.  And it's hard to conceivably rouse them into action, even if one of their buddies got hurt.  Or to put it another way, when Superman can punch you through a wall with his fist, does he really get that upset if you cut him off in traffic?  Does he even drive in traffic?Bank is supposed to be a really mean guy, but Pacino barely gets to tear up the scenery because it's crowded with a dozen other actors.  So he's only sorta mean.  He's also really, really paranoid, which makes breaking into his place a challenge.  He invests in all kinds of technological defenses, including an artificial intelligence that uses face recognition to spot cheats.  Bank is truly a wonder of the modern age.Opposing this technological villain are our heroes, who kick it old school.  And by old school, I mean they buy a gigantic drilling machine to cause an earthquake, thereby temporarily shutting down the computer security system and giving the team time to get in and get out.This is pretty much where the movie broke down for me.  They bought a giant drill to get revenge on this guy?  Seriously?  When you have that much money, why not buy a big satellite laser and just nuke the guy from orbit?There are other nearly interesting plots, like the one in which Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) decides he's up to the challenge of seducing Bank's right hand woman, Abigail Sponder (the SMOKING hot Ellen Barkin). And what do we get?  Caldwell ends up using some ridiculous technological doodad to knock her off her heels, which seems suspiciously similar to a date-rape drug.  If the movie was trying to make a statement about outwitting your opponent vs. using technology, it failed.  If it was trying to imitate the Rat Pack, I don't think drugging the hot chick (no matter how old she is) is how you do it.  And given that Barkin smolders on-screen, the fact that there's no actual pressing of flesh really makes the whole film into one big practical joke.  If Ocean's Thirteen were trying to emulate the old style heist movies, you'd better believe Caldwell would be keeping the ""cougar"" busy. The greater sin is that this leaves Barkin with nothing to do than look stupid.  She barely has any lines!There's other stuff that happens, some of it meant to be funny that's not so funny.  Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle, still using that ridiculous accent) gets to ham it up, which is a high point in the movie.  He writes touching letters to poor old Tishkoff to bring him out of his funk, but we're robbed of any sentimental feeling because we never find out what's in the letters.  And for reasons that don't make any sense to me, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are barely in the movie.  It's almost as if the guys thought that their egos got in the way of the second film, so instead they'd make it all not about them in the third film and that would make it better.It doesn't.  Ocean's Thirteen is a photocopy of a photocopy.  It feels like it's written by guys who didn't bother to see the original Ocean's Eleven and instead wanted to put in jokes about funny noses and ""cougars.""

1103686,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000VQQJ8U,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""Ocean's Thirteen"" is better than the abysmal ""Ocean's Twelve"", but this is another exercise in panache from Steven Soderbergh and all-star company with limited entertainment value. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang plot a revenge job this time. Mentor Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) has been swindled out of his share of a dream Las Vegas hotel by business partner Willie Bank (Al Pacino). The gang intends to compel Bank to restore Reuben's share by making the hotel's Grand Opening go very wrong. If they can cause the casino to lose money, Bank will default on his loans. And if they ensure the hotel won't receive a 5-star rating, Bank will be humiliated.To call this plot flimsy would be generous. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is a series of disjointed conversations and glamorous sets. It jumps from one person or place to another with little reason. The point seems to be mediocre one-liners and a striking color palette. Soderbergh fills the screen with oranges and cerulean blue. Most scenes could have been left out. The crime itself is dull as dishwater, an unforgivable fault in a heist movie. But all the frenetic editing and meaningless scenes left me to ponder the fabulous colors. The production design and lighting earn all 3 stars. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is a 2-hour fractured vignette of a fantasy Las Vegas. Cutting a half hour would have helped.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2007): Bonus features include some deleted scenes and 2 featurettes. ""Vegas: An Opulent Illusion"" (22 min) is an interesting documentary on the evolving culture, architecture, and economy of Las Vegas. It interviews an architect, casino host, owner, and others about the Strip's constant reinvention, the lure of casinos, the lifestyle of high rollers, and the current transition from mega resorts to design-oriented architecture. In ""Jerry Weintraub: Walk and Talk"" (2 1/2 min), the producer takes us on a tour of the casino sets. Subtitles are available for the film in English, English SDH, French, Spanish.

1103687,A1E8HGPHF98MOV,B000VQQJ8U,Mister Chris,"[0, 0]","I loved the slickly packaged, star-studded fluff that was ""Ocean's 11 (the remake, of course).""  After the farcical nonsense that was ""Ocean's 12,"" director Steve Soderbergh promised that ""Ocean's 13"" would be an assured return to form. With the addition of the Godfather, himself, Al Pacino, and the welcome return of actress Ellen Barkin I was primed for a cool time.  The result in Blackjack jargon- House Bust!""Ocean's 13"" is nothing more than a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" minus the palpable fun and energy.  With no Julia Roberts this time around to provide any romantic heat, writers Brian Koppelman and David Levian bring back these icy-cool Robin Hoods for another casino raid.  Again the patsy is another thug like Vegas tycoon(Pacino)who has fleeced Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), our hero Danny Ocean's mentor, of millions and literally breaking the man's heart.  Seeking revenge (think ""The Sting""), A-List stars George Clooney (Ocean), Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon and the rest of familiar faces from the previous movies dream up another elaborate caper (these thieves all seem to be members of MENSA) to embarrass Pacino and also steal his prized possession of diamonds.Soderbergh is a gifted filmmaker, of course,  and has managed to infuse all the ""Ocean"" movies with a snappy, retro 60's vibe.  However, the problem lies in the fact that after ""Ocean's 11"" there was no discernible reason to see any of these characters again (unless if you're a greedy studio executive with an eye on the box office).  Thus, ""Ocean's 13"" is another pointless, soulless sequel-the proverbial, dull tasting, third glass of beer.  The lack of urgency shows in the material and the actors. Clooney and company all interact as if they were stoic world leaders during an economic summit.  Pitt, in particular, seems visibly bored and I can hardly blame him.  His part more than ever could have been filled by well-dressed department store mannequin and he oddly disappears through out the midsection of this movie (""Hey George, gotta go!  Angelina and the kids need me!"").  Pacino seems game at first with an edgy performance but ultimately is made to look wide-eyed and ridiculous while Barkin does indeed smolder as Pacino's bitchy first lieutenant.  Also comic veterans Carl Reiner and David Paymer are among the few with a twinkle in their eyes.It's better to skip the adventures of Ocean and his boys and watch Jules Dasin's grittier ""Rififi- the granddaddy of all nifty capers.",2,Unlucky 13,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2472,"['loved', 'slickly', 'packaged', 'star-studded', 'fluff', 'was', 'Ocean', '11', 'remake', 'course', 'farcical', 'nonsense', 'was', 'Ocean', '12', 'director', 'Steve', 'Soderbergh', 'promised', 'Ocean', '13', 'would', 'be', 'assured', 'return', 'form', 'addition', 'Godfather', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'welcome', 'return', 'actress', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'was', 'primed', 'cool', 'time', 'result', 'Blackjack', 'jargon-', 'House', 'Bust', 'Ocean', '13', 'nothing', 'more', 'remake', 'Ocean', '11', 'palpable', 'fun', 'energy', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'time', 'provide', 'romantic', 'heat', 'writers', 'Brian', 'Koppelman', 'David', 'Levian', 'bring', 'back', 'icy-cool', 'Robin', 'Hoods', 'casino', 'raid', 'Again', 'patsy', 'thug', 'Vegas', 'tycoon', 'Pacino', 'who', 'fleeced', 'Reuben', 'Tishkoff', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'hero', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'mentor', 'millions', 'literally', 'breaking', 'man', 'heart', 'Seeking', 'revenge', 'think', 'Sting', 'A-List', 'stars', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ocean', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'rest', 'familiar', 'previous', 'movies', 'dream', 'up', 'elaborate', 'caper', 'thieves', 'seem', 'be', 'members', 'MENSA', 'embarrass', 'Pacino', 'also', 'steal', 'prized', 'possession', 'diamonds.Soderbergh', 'gifted', 'filmmaker', 'course', 'managed', 'infuse', 'Ocean', 'movies', 'snappy', '60', 'vibe', 'However', 'problem', 'fact', 'Ocean', '11', 'was', 'discernible', 'reason', 'see', 'characters', 'again', ""'re"", 'greedy', 'studio', 'executive', 'eye', 'box', 'office', 'Thus', 'Ocean', '13', 'pointless', 'soulless', 'sequel-the', 'proverbial', 'dull', 'tasting', 'third', 'glass', 'beer', 'lack', 'urgency', 'shows', 'material', 'actors', 'Clooney', 'company', 'all', 'interact', 'were', 'stoic', 'world', 'leaders', 'economic', 'summit', 'Pitt', 'particular', 'visibly', 'bored', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'part', 'more', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'well-dressed', 'department', 'store', 'mannequin', 'oddly', 'midsection', 'movie', 'Hey', 'George', 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'Angelina', 'kids', 'need', 'Pacino', 'game', 'first', 'edgy', 'performance', 'ultimately', 'made', 'look', 'wide-eyed', 'ridiculous', 'Barkin', 'indeed', 'smolder', 'Pacino', 'bitchy', 'first', 'lieutenant', 'Also', 'comic', 'veterans', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'David', 'Paymer', 'are', 'few', 'twinkle', 'eyes.It', 'better', 'skip', 'adventures', 'Ocean', 'boys', 'watch', 'Jules', 'Dasin', 'grittier', 'Rififi-', 'granddaddy', 'nifty', 'capers']",N/A

That original film was little more than a visualization of the tabloid interest in the lives of the Rat Packers, and a sad late career addition to the resume of the estimable Lewis Milestone (""All Quiet on the Western Front"", etc.) I would say that the original producers, at least, knew enough to stop at a single installment. However, such marginal ""entertainments"" as ""Sergeants 3"" and ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" were sort of sequels. Obviously, the new series also exists primarily because of the interest in celebrities named Clooney, Pitt and Damon. I found even the superior first entry to be of limited interest. I missed the roundly panned second, and was uninvolved in this ultimate sequel...... except when Al Pacino is present. Hardly his best work, but he's just such an interesting actor. His ""Sea of Love"" co-star Ellen Barkin is wasted in a demeaning turn as a tough as nails, yet unbelievably mooney minion of Pacino.

Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition.  The good news is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that`s not a particularly high bar to jump over).  The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining ""Ocean's Eleven"" in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not having them traipsing all over Europe, as they did in the second installment, on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors.  In ""Thirteen,"" Danny Ocean and his ""crew"" of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself.  The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.At the beginning, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances.  Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors.  Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore.  And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.""Ocean's Thirteen"" may be better than ""Ocean's Twelve,"" but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie.  I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects.  We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that.",2,"Better than ""12"" but not by much",1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,2652,"['**1/2After', 'disastrous', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'was', 'released', '2004', 'ended', 'review', 'asking', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', '[', 'saga', ']', 'sliced', '11', '12', 'ways', 'noticeably', 'diminishing', 'results', 'do', 'dare', 'go', 'unlucky', '13', 'Well', 'long', 'last', 'question', 'been', 'answered', 'come', 'form', 'good', 'news/bad', 'news', 'proposition', 'good', 'news', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'marks', 'least', 'slight', 'improvement', 'previous', 'installment', 'then', 'again', 's', 'not', 'particularly', 'high', 'bar', 'jump', 'over', 'bad', 'news', 'ONLY', 'slight', 'improvement.For', 'latest', 'entry', 'series', 'began', 'easy', 'forget', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', '2001', 'writers', 'Brian', 'Koppelman', 'David', 'Levien', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'have', 'least', 'had', 'wisdom', 'return', 'boys', 'back', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'not', 'having', 'traipsing', 'Europe', 'did', 'second', 'installment', 'what', 'seemed', 'high-cost', 'junket', 'bunch', 'already', 'overpaid', 'actors', 'Thirteen', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'crew', 'con', 'artist', 'buddies', 'rally', 'ailing', 'Reuben', 'Tishkoff', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'cheated', 'portion', 'brand', 'new', 'casino', 'unscrupulous', 'partner', 'allegorically', 'named', 'Willie', 'Bank', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'business', 'plan', 'sabotage', 'Bank', 'place', 'will', 'go', 'belly-up', 'even', 'officially', 'beginning', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'fairly', 'decent', 'caper', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'noticeable', 'fatigue', 'lethargy', 'begin', 'creep', 'writing', 'performances', 'Very', 'quickly', 'plot', 'steam', 'come', 'sense', 'all-star', 'players', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'et', 'al.-', 'are', 'merely', 'going', 'motions', 'hanging', 'around', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'cash', 'hefty', 'paychecks', 'heading', 'off', 'worthier', 'more', 'artistically', 'rewarding', 'endeavors', 'Clooney', 'Pitt', 'Damon', 'Cheadle', 'particular', 'have', 'been', 'striking', 'out', 'such', 'interesting', 'career', 'paths', 'late', 'perhaps', 'hearts', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'saga', 'much', 'anymore', 'acting', 'hard', 'audience', 'feel', 'either', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'still', 'largely', 'half-hearted', 'effort', 'little', 'burnish', 'reputation', 'original', 'movie', 'think', 'long', 'past', 'time', 'float', 'series', 'sea', 'so', 'fine', 'actors', 'can', 'continue', 'pursuing', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'projects', 'would', 'benefit', 'win-win', 'proposition']",N/A

Sadly enough, expectations weren't met at all. The plot was unrealistic and so weird, and the storyline had loose ends.Regarding the acting you had the feeling just like in Ocean's 12 that here are a bunch of $20 million actors strolling around who truly enjoyed their payday. It was good to see Andy Garcia, but not enough of him - he should have driven in his Cadillac SUV from the TV commercial, so that he gets out of the office. Producer Jerry Weintraub had to be in the flick as he's often in his own films, and he drove off in his very own Maserati Quattroporte - that was fun.The fictitious hotel structure was unique, but not really anything that fits on the Las Vegas Strip, and therefore so unrealistic that it was almost a joke.Al Pacino was there as the bad guy, and although he had the characteristics of a certain real winning Las Vegas hotel owner, somehow the edge and sophistication was missing.I was hoping to see more of Las Vegas to add flair to the flick, but the film plays mostly in offices and enclosed rooms here and there.Is it worth seeing this film? Let's put it this way, I would have lived perfectly happy without ever seeing it. There are a lot of slow passages and it's sad because with that kind of budget, pool of actors and premise a so much better movie could have been made. But then there was no foul language aside from one outburst and there were no stupid sensual scenes, ... so it's a save movie that should have received a PG rating although it's not a film for kids.

I am happy to report that this new film comes much closer in quality to the earlier effort, and thus, is another winner. The elements are all there, a highly entertaining storyline, plenty of funny moments, a cleverly planned revenge and an impressive cast.There are a few differences this time around though. The plan involves destroying the empire of Willie Bank (Al Pacino), a ruthless casino mogul, who cheated Reuben out of his share of the hotel they were planning to open together. In turn, Reuben lost his will for living and is in a life-threatening state. The crew wants their revenge and to provide Reuben a reason for going on with his life. Therefore, this is a plan that involves no personal profit, well maybe just a little, but mostly the goal is to punish Bank. Another difference is that sadly, Julia Roberts is not present this time around. Finally, did you ever think that Danny Ocean and his friends will work together with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)? I didn't either, so brace yourself for a shock!From cheating at the casino, to initiating a revolt among laborers in Mexico, this movie has it all.

Jentsch,"[0, 0]","How Does it Look?Color tint changes, split-screen effects, and other aesthetic effects are employed in this movie, making a standalone judgement of picture quality difficult.However, there were a few instances of edge enhancement that were noticeable, but not to a degree where it distracted from the movie in a major way. Considering the type of movie that this is (a crime caper, not an epic), the issues are barely worth mentioning because they do not impact enjoyment of the movie.How Does it Sound?This is primarily a talking movie, so it's not surprising that the center channel gets all the action and the rest aren't used much at all. It is disappointing in a way, though, as Las Vegas is one of the most dynamic environments created by man, and the casino scenes are notably lacking in any ambience.The tremor scene was mildly realistic by lighting up the subwoofer a little, but this is another instance where doing it any better would have stood out when the rest of the movie is so center-heavy.ExtrasI like to see the theatrical trailer included with movies, so I'm disappointed that they omitted one on this DVD. Considering that the up-front ads included no less than four trailers/ads for other movies, it would have been nice had Warner provided us with one that was connected with the movie on the disc.What we have been given is a feature on what designers in Las Vegas do to influence visitors called Vegas: An Opulent Illusion. It's interesting, but nothing that we haven't been exposed to in other documentaries about Sin City. Much less interesting is the other short video, Jerry Weintraub Walk and Talk. Weintraub looks uncomfortable to be doing it, and he doesn't really provide much insight beyond the fact that most of the props used in the casino are fully operational. The Additional Scenes are largely forgettable, and add nothing to the movie. They serve as a testament to the skill of the Editor, but not much else.ConclusionIf you enjoyed the first two movies, you will enjoy this one. It's definitely the weakest of the bunch, but probably better than a lot of other movies out there. It's disappointing to see so few interesting extras, which makes one believe that a special edition is coming down the line at some point that will include extras that have already been offered online. This isn't sold as a Special Edition, and the street price on this disc is low, so perhaps it's difficult to complain about the lack of decent extras. Still, I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are a big fan and want to complete your set of the previous movies.

With Reuben confined to bed, Danny Ocean (Clooney) and the boys, proving that there is honour among thieves, band together to bankrupt Bank on the opening night of his new casino. However, because the plan is the most elaborate yet, they need the help of their former enemy Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) and his asking price ups the stakes some more. That's the plot, but most of us just want to see Clooney and co. do their smug thing one more time for smugness' sake. Like Twelve, it's best to put the plot - that includes (among others) Carl Reiner's hotel inspector, a trade union dispute in Mexico, simulated earthquakes and Vincent Cassel's revenge - to one side and sit back and enjoy the verbal back-and-forth, the close calls, the funky soundtrack and Soderbergh's sexy '70's approach. Everything that worked in the previous two instalments (although there's no sign of Julia Roberts) makes a welcome comeback: Pitt and Clooney's 'going nowhere' dialogue is honed, Damon is given more room to manoeuvre and the male camaraderie is very much to the fore (Ellen Barkin's 'cougar' is the only femme on show).

But ultimately, there's nothing really special about this film. It's not bad, its not great. It's just somewhere in-between. The plot was pretty simple. There really were no big twists or surprises in the film, and the few twists they did throw in, you could see coming ahead of time. One thing I did like was the pacing of the film, it did move quickly, but almost too quickly. After the first 30 minutes or so of the film, you know pretty much everything that's gonna happen in the rest of film. You know basically every aspect of the heist, and how they are gonna pull it off. As far as acting, you can't argue with the talent in these films, but to me, there seemed to a lot of ""sleepwalking"" in some of the roles. People just going through the motions. No, there weren't bad performances, but it just seemed that the weren't putting there all into some scenes. And Al Pacino, well he was pretty much like all the rest. There really was no big dramatic scenes with him, and no Oscar worthy performances here. He came in, played a part in the film, and that was it. I just felt that the writers/directors could've made his role more dramatic, or maybe, like I said, Pacino wasn't fully into the character. But anyway, for whatever the reason, this film is simply ok. Like I said, nothing real special.

1103730,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000VQQJ8U,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 6]","Danny Ocean (George Clooney) gathers the group together because one of their own has been hurt by a malicious new casino owner, Willy Bank (Al Pacino). Bank entered into a partnership with Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) to use his influence, to steal his land and to smooth the wheels of bureaucracy. Reuben doesn't listen to the warnings and gladly helps with all of this. When his usefulness is over, Willy forces him out and Reuben collapses. Danny and Rusty (Brad Pitt) show up at his bedside and learn what happened. When Willy refuses to make it right, they set out, on two fronts, to destroy Willy and his new deluxe casino, the Bank Casino on opening night; they want to bankrupt the casino and prevent Bank from earning another coveted 5 Diamond Award. They bring in Linus (Matt Damon), Basher (Don Cheadle), Frank (Bernie Mac) and all of the others. There plan is to attack on many fronts, so they bring in a hacking expert, Roman Nagel (Eddie Izzard) to help. His news isn't good, so they refine their plan. Eventually, they need an infusion of cash and someone suggests they turn to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). He agrees, with one caveat; they must also steal the diamonds that Bank gives his wife every time he receives the 5 Diamond Award for one of his hotels. They are secured in a room at the top of the casino. Keeping an eye out for all of Bank's activities is his personal assistant, Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin), a tough as nails woman who seems to only have eyes for her boss.""Ocean's 13"", the second sequel to the remake of the original Rat Pack film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a really fun caper romp. Love those caper romps. More importantly, it is so much better than the last sequel. Sooooo much better.Anytime filmmakers go to the effort of redoing the studio logo to match the look and feel of their film, it is a signal we are in for something special. For ""13"", the studio logos are set against retro graphics, something like you might see in a film from the 60s. Given this is a sequel to a remake of a film from the 60s, the filmmakers are clearly trying to return to the roots of the project and deliver a breezy, fun piece of escape to entertain their fans for a few hours during the summer.The ""Ocean's"" films are Soderbergh's most commercial projects. He eschews most of the technical tricks and ideas he experiments with in his other films for a slick, glossy production value perfectly matching the Las Vegas setting. ""13"" is set at a new casino, which seems to be a mishmash of styles in an effort to attain a coveted 5 Diamond Award, and to appeal to most guests and particularly Asian high rollers. The hotel is filled with dark colors, shiny surfaces (marble, highly polished wood, gold, silver) and luxurious items. Soderbergh's camera (he also serves as the Director of Photography) captures every element of this excess.The entire cast returns and they have added some memorable actors to make the mix exciting and fresh.George Clooney seems tailor made for the role of Danny Ocean. He is a con-man and thief who always seems to be one step ahead of his prey. In each film, there are insurmountable odds, but he and the rest of his crew have come up with a plan that is difficult, maybe even impossible, but there is too much money at stake. They have thought through every aspect of the plan and now feel they can navigate through the treacherous waters. This all makes sense, because they put up their own money to bankroll the plan to reap the considerable rewards at the end of the operation, but wouldn't risk it. They would naturally work out every detail to protect their investment.Clooney has an easy going charm that has helped to make him a movie star. Danny Ocean is for Clooney exactly what the role was for Sinatra; a chance to work with some friends, make some money and give him some bargaining power for more substantial projects. Last year, ""The Good German"", directed by Soderbergh and starring Clooney, made about $1.2 million, considerably less than it cost. Warner Bros. produced that film as well as ""13"". I'm sure ""12"" made ""The Good German"" and ""Syriana"" possible and now that they have ""13"", Warner Bros. is probably not very upset and willing to take a chance on another risky Clooney project.Clooney is a good actor, but this is a breezy role and he doesn't have to exhibit a lot of acting chops. All of the actors just have to keep things moving, keep them lighthearted and keep the audience entertained. If they do that, they have been successful.Basically, we go to the ""Ocean's"" films to see Clooney and Pitt, and to a lesser extent Damon, pal around and joke with one another. And ""13"" doesn't disappoint here. Clooney and Pitt's characters are the leaders of the group; Damon's character is the step-child always vying for respect. In each film, the leads don ridiculous disguises, and in ""13"", Danny dresses up like a 60's beatnik, a hotel maintenance worker and others. Rusty dons the disguise of a geologist who needs a haircut. Damon sports a huge nose as his alter ego, a character he creates in an effort for him to get closer to Ellen Barkin's character. It is a lot of fun to watch these guys don a series of disguises, each more outlandish than the last. I don't think anyone involved expects us to believe these costumes work, but somehow they always accomplish what they set out to do in the context of the film's universe.Clooney and Pitt are the Sinatra and Martin of the group, without all of the alcohol. They have a breezy repartee and seem to really enjoy each other's company, playfully giving each other a little jab here and a little jab there. Danny and Rusty work so well together they are at the point where they can even finish each other's sentences.Damon's Linus has always been the apprentice, fighting for respect and a chance to play a management role. In ""13"", part of the plan involves romancing Barkin's character. When this pops up, they immediately turn to Rusty (Pitt), but Linus is adamant that he should do it, as he already has made previous contact with her. Just to make sure, they give him a little help. This is a welcome development in the story and provides for an amusing scene, even with the prosthetic nose Damon wears as his character's alter ego.Pacino's Bank is a formidable foe. Bank, a well-known hotelier, has received a number of 5 Diamond Awards for his elaborate, deluxe locations around the world. Now, he wants to set-up shop in Vegas and has created an elaborate structure that towers over most of the other luxurious locations on the Strip. Bank will do whatever is necessary to make this hotel a success, because he has sunk a fortune into it. He is also an egotistical control freak, which explains why he is so intent on receiving yet another 5 Diamond Award. These two elements of his character are what Danny and his crew set out to attack.After Bank enters into an arrangement with Reuben (Gould), in an effort to secure his land, use his connections, and get some chandeliers from an old acquaintance, he cuts him out of the deal. When Danny and his crew enter the story, they decide to give Bank an opportunity to make things right, he shook Sinatra's hand after all. This is, apparently, a code of ethics among people in Vegas. But Bank refuses the `Billy Martin' and the Ocean's team sets their plan into motion.We quickly realize how powerful and intimidating Bank can be. When something goes wrong with the Koi pool in his lobby, he immediately turns to the pool attendant and says ""it's not his fault, I should have fired you when the problem first started. You're fired"". Sponder fires a waitress because she has gained four pounds. Bank and Sponder are on the quest for excellence and this will ultimately lead to their downfall.When the plan starts to get out of hand, and their resources run low, Danny and the crew decide to approach Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the mark in ""Ocean's 11"" and the owner of the Bellagio. Benedict is in, because he can't stand Bank's new hotel, it casts a shadow over his pool. But for his involvement, Terry wants them to steal Bank's jewel collection. Every time Bank receives a 5 Diamond Award, he makes a big show of presenting his wife with an elaborate necklace in honor of the award. Each of these necklaces is on display in secure room at the top of the hotel. Stealing these necklaces would be the ultimate way for him to give his chief rival a kick in the backside. The jewels are worth $250 million, but Bendict just wants them stolen.David Paymer has an amusing turn as the inspector for the 5 Diamond Award. Danny and Rusty are able to learn his identity and they do everything they can to make sure he has an unpleasant stay at the Bank Casino.Another fun aspect of ""Ocean's 13"" is the ability to see a variety of people work together again, to see how easily this group of friends meshes together. Of course, the core crew from the first two films returns, and Eddie Izzard's Roman Nagel from ""12"" returns in a greatly expanded role in this new film. Vincent Cassell also returns as a French jewel thief. But ""13"" adds both Pacino and Barkin, both of whom steamed up the screen in the sexy ""Sea of Love"" many years ago. And it's fun to watch Pacino and Garcia working together again, many years after ""The Godfather III"". These relationships make everyone and everything appear as though they are elements of a well-oiled machine.Not a groundbreaking, or earth shattering film, ""Ocean's 13"" is a fun, enjoyable way to spend a few hours at the multiplex this summer.",4,4 1/2 - Fun and Breezy.

1103734,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000VQQJ8U,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","""Oceans 13"" starts with the 70-ish music and slick opening credit, both making me anticipate something thrilling and entertaining is coming in the next two hours. The film's opening sequence (after Rusty's funny ringtone) quickly moves, setting up the initial part of the story. In short in ""Oceans 13"" Danny Ocean and the boys come back to Las Vegas, not for money but for revenge or for too trusting Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) who was deceived and suffered heart attack.So far the film is great. Then always reliable Eddie Izzard arrives and I thought Ocean's plans for the casino robbery would begin immediately. However, more than one hour in, the guys are still preparing for their robbery and their plans get more and more complicated and it becomes clear that more than one big contraption is needed to do what they are supposed to do. By the time they put into practice their elaborate plans, sorry, but I lost interest.Not that ""Oceans 13"" is waste of time. George Clooney as Danny Ocean and some of his friends, especially Brad Pitt as Rusty shine with charisma, but considering their talent, that is not a surprise. Al Pacino's ""villainous"" casino owner is more interesting as character (with possible references to real-life persons), and so are the amusing turns from veterans like Carl Reiner and David Paymer as ""V.

P.""Still female roles are sadly disappointing (even though I am aware the film is about ""Ocean's 13""), and the scene where Ellen Barkin is seduced by Matt Damon (with a false nose) with a help of ""Gilroy"" is embarrassing to see. Some actors like Julian Sands and Vincent Cassel are called in, but they are not given chance to show their talent.In spite of its great ""all-star"" cast, the real star of ""Oceans 13"" is Steven Soderbergh's camera work and the city of Las Vegas. Soderbergh fills the screen with colors like red and gold and even uses techniques like split screen.""Oceans 13"" is much better than its predecessor ""12"" but shares the same weakness as ""Shrek 3,""""Spider-Man 3""and ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" other third installments of popular series released this year: lots of things going on but not enough story in it.",3,Lots of Things Going on But Not Enough Story,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2169,"['13', 'starts', '70-ish', 'music', 'slick', 'opening', 'credit', 'making', 'anticipate', 'something', 'thrilling', 'entertaining', 'coming', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Rusty', 'funny', 'ringtone', 'quickly', 'moves', 'setting', 'up', 'initial', 'part', 'story', 'short', 'Oceans', '13', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'boys', 'come', 'back', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'not', 'money', 'revenge', 'too', 'trusting', 'Reuben', 'Tishkoff', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'who', 'was', 'deceived', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack.So', 'far', 'film', 'great', 'Then', 'always', 'reliable', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'thought', 'Ocean', 'plans', 'casino', 'robbery', 'would', 'begin', 'immediately', 'However', 'more', 'one', 'hour', 'guys', 'are', 'still', 'preparing', 'robbery', 'plans', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'complicated', 'clear', 'more', 'one', 'big', 'contraption', 'needed', 'do', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'time', 'put', 'practice', 'elaborate', 'plans', 'sorry', 'lost', 'interest.Not', 'Oceans', '13', 'waste', 'time', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'friends', 'especially', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Rusty', 'shine', 'charisma', 'considering', 'talent', 'not', 'surprise', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'villainous', 'casino', 'owner', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'possible', 'references', 'real-life', 'persons', 'so', 'are', 'amusing', 'turns', 'veterans', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'David', 'Paymer', 'V.', 'U.', 'P.', 'Still', 'female', 'roles', 'are', 'sadly', 'disappointing', 'even', 'am', 'aware', 'film', 'Ocean', '13', 'scene', 'where', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'seduced', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'false', 'nose', 'help', 'Gilroy', 'embarrassing', 'see', 'actors', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'are', 'called', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'talent.In', 'spite', 'great', 'all-star', 'cast', 'real', 'star', 'Oceans', '13', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'camera', 'work', 'city', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Soderbergh', 'screen', 'colors', 'red', 'gold', 'even', 'techniques', 'split', 'screen', '13', 'much', 'better', 'predecessor', '12', 'shares', 'same', 'weakness', 'Shrek', '3', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'other', 'third', 'installments', 'popular', 'series', 'released', 'year', 'lots', 'things', 'going', 'not', 'enough', 'story']",N/A

1103737,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,B000VQQJ8U,viewer,"[1, 3]","I had not seen any ""Ocean"" movies, so I did not know what to expect from Ocean's 13. Given the cast, especially Al Pacino, I was looking forward to it. My enthusiasm drained away pretty quickly, though, and I found it only mildly entertaining. The friend who invited me to watch it and who had liked both the Ocean's 11 remake and Ocean's 12, had the same reaction as I did, expressing disappointment with its relative lack of action and of spark to the characters.Ocean's 13 has a light, glib flow and style to it. It has some pleasant, attractive actors and scenery. Pacino's electronic security system gives the movie some focus and challenge.  But its choppy pace and its frivolity are disappointing. When a movie, like this one, sets up a series of major and minor ""cons,"" it should use subtle, clever strokes and should play fair. This movie plays fast and loose on both scores.Within minutes, Ocean has lined up numerous moles in key positions in Pacino's casino. This occurs in flimsy and unbelievable ways, like simply dropping in and making an open-ended promise to a desk clerk that she will be made a manager, slipping a restaurant manager some fast cash, and catching a casino floor manager pawning fancy casino silverware. The way Ocean infiltrates one of his own men into the casino as a dealer is played more for laughs than believability, and it is left completely up in the air how later busting the cover of that same man makes any sense as part of the plan (in fact, it almost destroys the plan). A quick, easy conversation with one big-shot is all it takes for Ocean to get numerous ""whale"" high-rolling gamblers to up and leave Pacino's hotel.Very early on, Ocean's team seems to have free run of the casino's security and electronics floor. With ease, they repeatedly tramp back and forth across it, so that, for example, one of his men can relieve a guard at just the right moment. Details about how Ocean plans to fix Pacino's dice, roulette wheels, and slot machines, and use a gigantic drill to mimic an earthquake, are glossed over to the point they come off as amateur science fiction - not to mention ""the Gilroy,"" some sort of magical love potion used to reduce the only mildly competent guest character in the film, Pacino's top manager Ellen Barkin, to jello.And then there is the way the team spoils Pacino's attempt to get a five-star rating for his hotel. The movie goes completely over the top in inflicting all manner of extreme, unbelievable, foul treatment on the implausible-acting visiting critic. Not content at depriving Pacino of five stars, the movie pounds the joke into the ground, not stopping even at one star. How, in the midst of all of the luxury and other satisfied hotel guests, are we supposed to think that the critic, or anyone else, would believe such an exaggerated, isolated experience? As if in recognition of the near-sadistic, unfunny excess, there is a simple-minded, contrived scene at the end where the beleaguered critic is helped to win big at an airport slot machine.Playing fair not only means that the film cannot lift off completely from reality, but it also means that both the good and bad guys need to be up to the challenge. Here, Pacino does nothing but talk tough.  He is given fair notice by Ocean at the outset, but does not make a single smart move the entire movie, only mistake after mistake (such as being easily manipulated into allowing Bernie Mac to set up a game on the casino floor and generally allowing Ocean's men to swarm all over his hotel, completely undetected and undeterred). In one token scene, which the script comes right out and tells us is meant to show how savvy Pacino is, he taps into an FBI computer to search for the identity and known associates of a dealer who Ocean planted in the casino.  But this incident only undercuts everyone's credibility.  It depends on Ocean confusingly blowing the dealer's cover, it nearly destroys Ocean's plans, and the way Ocean and his men get out of it is wildly exaggerated and far too easy.  Way too easily, Ocean dismisses Pacino's threats at the end, confirming the character's total impotence.Indeed, the few adversities faced by Ocean are trumped-up accidents, either overcome too easily or too implausibly. As a result, there is a near-total lack of suspense and a diminished, anticlimactic sense of accomplishment at the end.The film has an overall slack pace, despite -- or maybe because of -- rapid cutaways between short, thin scenes. At times, it feels like slow-motion, which can be one of director Soderbergh's worst tendencies. This saps not only the drama but also the humor. There are so many characters that few if any have time to shine. As if to make up for this, Damon, Cheadle, and Bernie Mac get strained, far-fetched, show-boating scenes that only fall flat. Andy Garcia seems injected almost as an afterthought.While the film evokes some sentimentality about the Elliott Gould character, including a short scene reminiscing about ""the old Las Vegas,"" much about this is superficial and unexplained. His end scenes, in which he shows up and struts around at Pacino's casino in fancy dress with a big cigar in his mouth, acting triumphant based on absolutely nothing that he himself has done, strike a false and ineffective note.Nothing could be easier with a movie like this than writing a canned, shallow, gushing review, celebrating the movie's famous faces and places and glitzy, smooth, and easy feel. Of course, these qualities, and the talented people involved, create some entertainment value.  But any serious review has to come to grips with the failings that make this movie a disappointing missed opportunity even as mildly entertaining fluff.",3,Plays too fast and loose to amount to

It is entertaining at its core and even goes back to the Vegas locale that made the first one so successful.  However, by the end of ""13"" it is clear that the ""Ocean's"" series has played itself out.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), and the rest of the gang (this time featuring Matt Damon in a much larger role) back in Vegas, where this time they are getting a little revenge on casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) for putting Reuben (Elliot Gould) in the hospital.The biggest ""plus"" about this film is that it goes back to Vegas, the setting that these kinds of movies need to feature.  Even when all else can (and sometimes does) go wrong, there is just something about seeing those suave guys in sharp clothing strutting around the casino floor.  It adds that ""cool"" factor.Unfortunately, ""13"" is kind of a mishmash of all kinds of different stuff, both plot and character-wise.  The ""big job"" is delved into much too quickly with very little ""setup"" (a key component of the original), while the characters become (for the first time) little more than parodies of themselves.  Everything just kind of feels rushed in this one, as if the plan was to camouflage a fading series with continued action instead of plot/character development.Overall, though, ""Ocean's 13"" is still entertaining, at least.
