1518464,A2FDKMTT60QZAQ,B006OV7RZA,Jackie,"[0, 0]","So far my toddler daughter has all but one of the newer Strawberry Shortcake movies and I have to say I personally prefer them myself. They have the ""girls"" and berrykins overcoming obstacles and learning from their mistakes and I really like that. Makes them more educational in my opinion, in the areas of manners & learning common sense and such. The ones prior to these new ones with the pie man and his wife are ok too, but I like that the new ones don't have a ""bad guy"" in them. My only complaint about this particular item has nothing to do with the actual item, and in the long run everything turned out great. I paid $8.99 for this one new and found it 2 days later in Walmart for only $5. I checked 2 different stores to make sure the first one hadn't marked it wrong. However, their online price does list it as over $10, so I can't blame amazon for not knowing the in-store price, as I think they only base theirs on what others are selling it for online. I was going to return it, but amazon surprised me by crediting my account and letting me keep it. I didn't know they did that. I was getting it for my daughter's birthday so it's kind of like she got a birthday present from amazon too!",5,Love the newer Strawberry Shortcake movies,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,1204,"['So', 'far', 'toddler', 'daughter', 'one', 'newer', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'movies', 'have', 'say', 'personally', 'prefer', 'have', 'girls', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'learning', 'mistakes', 'really', 'Makes', 'more', 'educational', 'opinion', 'areas', 'manners', 'learning', 'common', 'sense', 'such', 'ones', 'prior', 'new', 'ones', 'pie', 'man', 'wife', 'are', 'ok', 'too', 'like', 'new', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'guy', 'only', 'complaint', 'particular', 'item', 'nothing', 'do', 'actual', 'item', 'long', 'run', 'everything', 'turned', 'out', 'great', 'paid', '8.99', 'one', 'new', 'found', '2', 'days', 'later', 'Walmart', 'only', '5', 'checked', '2', 'different', 'stores', 'make', 'sure', 'first', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'marked', 'wrong', 'However', 'online', 'price', 'list', '10', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'amazon', 'not', 'knowing', 'in-store', 'price', 'think', 'only', 'base', 'theirs', 'what', 'others', 'are', 'selling', 'online', 'was', 'going', 'return', 'amazon', 'surprised', 'crediting', 'account', 'letting', 'keep', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'was', 'getting', 'daughter', 'birthday', 'kind', 'got', 'birthday', 'present', 'amazon', 'too']",Strawberry Shortcake: Bloomin' Berry Garden
