While I mostly enjoyed it (especially the opening music number), there were so many things that did not make this season two, more like a filler between seasons like they did with Full Metal Panic.  While seeing Moka's sister was funny, and also was happy to see the Mothers of the girls episode and the season one return home episode (end of season one in the manga), i think they went too far off the story line with this season, mixing some of season one with the first 2 books of season two.  add to the fact that Ruby is regaled to a minor character status and the changes about the great seal situation just did not sit well with me (though I did enjoy watching inner moka trying to still be one of the group).  Then the ending really made no sense.Still it gets at least a B- with over the top humor, and fan service of the first season.  Hopefully the producers will read some of these and make a real season 2 and stay more on the story of the manga (even if it gets darker).",3,ROSARIO VAMPIRE FUMUFFU????,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1076,"['fan', 'manga', 'got', 'season', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'watched', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'opening', 'music', 'number', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'season', 'two', 'more', 'filler', 'seasons', 'did', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'seeing', 'Moka', 'sister', 'was', 'funny', 'also', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Mothers', 'girls', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'return', 'home', 'episode', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'manga', 'i', 'think', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'story', 'line', 'season', 'mixing', 'season', 'one', 'first', '2', 'books', 'season', 'two', 'add', 'fact', 'Ruby', 'regaled', 'minor', 'character', 'status', 'changes', 'great', 'seal', 'situation', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'inner', 'moka', 'trying', 'still', 'be', 'one', 'group', 'Then', 'ending', 'really', 'made', 'sense.Still', 'least', 'B-', 'top', 'humor', 'fan', 'service', 'first', 'season', 'Hopefully', 'producers', 'will', 'read', 'make', 'real', 'season', '2', 'stay', 'more', 'story', 'manga', 'even', 'darker']",Rosario + Vampire: CAPU2 Season 2

He finds out that it is a school for youkai (monsters). On the way to his new school he meets a vampire girl named Moka. She's very self conscious from living in the human world through middle school. She quickly begins to cling to Tsukune. He also manages to attract a succubus named Kurumu, a snow woman named Mizore, and a little witch named Yukari. All 3 of these cute girls are all about him and fight like crazy people to win his affection. The problem he faces is his humanity. If he is discovered to be human he will be killed. The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.This season begins with all the characters going back for 2nd year. This time Tsukune meets Moka's sister, Kokoa, on his way to school. She's a feisty brat, and she's determined to remove Moka's seal and get her ""real"" sister back. There are also 2 episodes that involve Kurumu and Mizore's mothers. There just older versions of their daughters.There is a descent amount of nudity in this season, unlike the 1st. So it's probably more of an R rating. There is not much of a difference as far as the animation and flow of the series is concerned. Thankfully, all of the voice actors have returned. I think they do a good job. I have seen rumors of a 3rd season, and I hope they are true. At the end of this season Moka tells Tsukune that he will be having to choose one of the girls very soon. That leads me to believe that a 3rd is likely. The popularity of this anime in Japan is also very large.Overall this is a great harem anime with cool characters and lots of laughs.

It has the little plastic divider for one DVD and the other sits like normal.  As stated in my last review if you you don't like to keep your extras (Slip Cover) than you can put this DVD into the box set of ""Season 1"".  The box ""Season 1"" came in works well to keep both seasons together.The show is not censored, and not for kids.Season two of a good anime kicks off with a family member coming into the main cast life to mix things up, and it kind of borderlines on incest.  It does not go over the top, but still present.  Season two picks up right where season one ended, and will end like normal anime ends, leaving you with no real closer for the main characters.Season two has a lot more action than season one, but falls back on the tried and true anime love story formula.  That is, boy can never make up his mind but all the girls love him.  If you like that kind of anime this one is for you.  For some reason I like this kind of anime, it makes me laugh.  There is a lot of fan service, and this anime is not intended for children. There is nudity.A lot of the monsters are really cool, and the animation is top notch.  I recommend you purchase this anime when it comes out.  Knowing Funimation and the quality of their anime I can recommend this before even getting the DVD set.The color is good on the DVDs not to much background issues. The transfers are well done.  No problems with picture.  Sound is well done as well, The 5.1 sound, sounds better than most anime so no complaints.At times the characters voices can be annoying, but nothing to write home about.  The dub for this anime is well done, and worth watching.  If you do not like dubs, the subtitles are there and from what I have seen match up well to the fan dubs.",4,Can I suck your blood?

1410440,A3LH0LIL5BQNJW,B004I8WN14,Niels Bohr,"[5, 25]","I am reviewing this as a biased person because I read the manga. I think that it's fair to do this because I really wish I would have noticed it before I went and purchased this. I was very disappointed with the first season due to how the characters where not developed due to very important scenarios being changed, moved around in the timeline or just outright left out. This season makes the last one seem like perfection in that area. I'm wondering if the people who created this even bothered to read the manga. It's like this was written by a 12 year old. Anyway, I think you get the picture. This anime will upset you if you have read the manga. Otherwise, If I was to merit it without taking the manga into consideration... I would give it about 3 stars. The previous background artwork has been improved and the music is good. Still, the characters are thin and the story is meh as it is. Fan service is a little over the top but whatever. I think that it is worth a view just not a purchase. Most definitely not worth a purchase if you liked the manga and were hoping to see the sweet action and character development.Ok, so I have finally finished this trash. The anime has nothing to do at all with the manga and honestly, it is crap stupid and so full of fan service that it is pointless. Christ! I have always made it my point to purchase anime so that the market expands in the US but it seems as if recently garbage like this is what they think we want. This tripe deserves negative stars imho. One of the worst animes ever. No content, development or action. Just stupid panty shots. If you are 12 - 13 years old then this should be great material.

The problem starts that Kokoa has no knowledge that Moka's powers and true personality has been sealed and a more demure and friendly outer personality is in control of the physical body.  At first Kokoa has an intense dislike bordering on hatred for Moka but after a fight and when the seal rosary is removed realizes what has happened.  Thus we now have Kokoa trying to undo the rosary seal and permanently free the inner Moka for good,  the hijinx this causes are humorous and endearing but also pretty much standard in some animes as well.  Of course the series still has Tsukune and his group of female admirers though his heart is set on Moka and so we'll also get our usual harem hijinx in a few episodes as well.  The series animation and soundtrack are great and while most of the cast for the dubbed and subbed were great the dubbed actress for Kokoa could have made her sound a little less annoying.

I found that the second season had more fan service and a little more adult themes including full breasts.  I still enjoyed the stories and liked how the characters developed.  I finished it and searched for season 3 to no avail.  The ending if you can call it that seemed to be left unfinished and from what I could find the manga goes much farther into the characters giving them more depth.  I was surprised that there wasn't a third series in the works and several sites were waiting and emailing anyone they could for information.  I have never bought manga before but this series makes me want to give it a try just to see how it all ends.  I liked the show and would love a third season but I take what I can get.  It a good watch if you like fun and light hearted anime.,5,This series Rocks!,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,840,"['bought', 'second', 'season', 'right', 'finished', 'first', 'found', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'more', 'fan', 'service', 'little', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'including', 'full', 'breasts', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'liked', 'how', 'characters', 'developed', 'finished', 'searched', 'season', '3', 'avail', 'ending', 'can', 'call', 'seemed', 'be', 'left', 'unfinished', 'what', 'could', 'find', 'manga', 'much', 'farther', 'characters', 'giving', 'more', 'depth', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'third', 'series', 'works', 'several', 'sites', 'were', 'waiting', 'emailing', 'anyone', 'could', 'information', 'have', 'never', 'bought', 'manga', 'series', 'want', 'give', 'try', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'liked', 'show', 'would', 'love', 'third', 'season', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'watch', 'like', 'fun', 'light', 'hearted', 'anime']",Rosario + Vampire: CAPU2 Season 2

1410445,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B004I8WN14,S. Der,"[0, 2]","I feel that this second series of the anime was little bit more enjoyable than the first series. There isn't much difference between the two series. The few differences is that you get to see Moka little sister in this series and all she does is try to get Moka vampire form to come out and stay forever. Also, you get to see the parents of the other girls now too.So besides the few differences in this shows than the last, it's pretty same thing . All it is, is Moka and Tsukune want to be together, but the problem is that there are so many other girls that want Tsukune too and the parents get in the way too now. Then add in a slight easy problem to fix in every show so that Moka can fix with her kick.Moka still solving the problems at the end of every show with just a few kicks. Still really boring.  She does ""kicks"" because those are her only moves that show her pantis. If she punches people then you won't see her pantis, so she only kicks when she fights.Fan service is great and all but there's just too much of it here still. It just boring so fast. Their skirts are way too short. It's like they are not wearing anything sometimes because you are always shown from below skirt level to see them.There nothing else to say about this anime because that's it.But...the spoiler alert....the second series just have Tsukune show some more power since he got some of Moka blood in him now. You will see this at the last show of the series. He not exactly human anymore but not a monster either. He just above a regular human.  He wants to be with the nice Moka more than her vampire self. He shows this by trying to get her a new rosario from her father.Like I said before, this show was just tiny bit better than the first series. But still average overall anime.",3,This is the same thing as the first series + a little sister!,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,1775,"['feel', 'second', 'series', 'anime', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'series', ""n't"", 'much', 'difference', 'two', 'series', 'few', 'differences', 'get', 'see', 'Moka', 'little', 'sister', 'series', 'try', 'get', 'Moka', 'vampire', 'form', 'come', 'out', 'stay', 'forever', 'Also', 'get', 'see', 'parents', 'other', 'girls', 'now', 'too.So', 'few', 'differences', 'shows', 'last', 'pretty', 'same', 'thing', 'Moka', 'Tsukune', 'want', 'be', 'together', 'problem', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'girls', 'want', 'Tsukune', 'too', 'parents', 'get', 'way', 'too', 'now', 'Then', 'add', 'slight', 'easy', 'problem', 'fix', 'show', 'Moka', 'can', 'fix', 'kick.Moka', 'still', 'solving', 'problems', 'end', 'show', 'just', 'few', 'kicks', 'Still', 'really', 'boring', 'kicks', 'are', 'only', 'moves', 'show', 'pantis', 'people', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'pantis', 'only', 'when', 'fights.Fan', 'service', 'great', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'still', 'just', 'boring', 'so', 'fast', 'skirts', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'are', 'not', 'wearing', 'anything', 'sometimes', 'are', 'always', 'shown', 'skirt', 'level', 'see', 'them.There', 'nothing', 'else', 'say', 'anime', 'it.But', 'spoiler', 'alert', '.the', 'second', 'series', 'just', 'have', 'Tsukune', 'show', 'more', 'power', 'got', 'Moka', 'blood', 'now', 'will', 'see', 'last', 'show', 'series', 'not', 'exactly', 'human', 'anymore', 'not', 'monster', 'either', 'just', 'regular', 'human', 'be', 'nice', 'Moka', 'more', 'vampire', 'self', 'trying', 'get', 'new', 'rosario', 'father.Like', 'said', 'before', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'better', 'first', 'series', 'still', 'average', 'overall', 'anime']",Rosario + Vampire: CAPU2 Season 2
