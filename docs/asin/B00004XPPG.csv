556813,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00004XPPG,,"[5, 6]","THE PATRIOT (2000) Directed by Roland Emmerich. Script by Robert Rodat. Score by John Williams.Starring Mel Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Heath Ledger, Chris Cooper, Rene Auberjonois, Peter Woodward and Tom Wilkinson as General Lord Charles Cornwallis.This..the story of the American Revolution in South Carolina told through various fictional amalgams of real personages along with real persons and events was a masterpiece when it was first released and time........and the extended cut available on DVD has only confirmed its status.Rather like GETTYSBURG inspired its own cast and behind the camera creative teams, so did this film...since except for Isaac, Woodward, Auberjonois and Gibson, no one before or since this film have impressed me tremendously............and the film IS endlessly brilliant and inspired. From Gibson's sublime performance as Benjamin Martin...a man tortured by his bloody past in the French and Indian War and, except when fighting, is incredibly unsure of himself to the beautiful cinematography(the film is simply beautiful to look at at times), there is not a single false moment nor a concession to modern degraded sensibilities. The film goes effortlessly from tremendous battle sequences to a tearjerking moment of a father having to leave his daughter to go off to war. Jason Isaacs as the fictionalized version of Banestre Tarleton knocked my socks off in 2000 with his Classic Hollywood style Basil Rathbone/George Sanders villainy and that impression has not diminished. Isaacs well deserved his later roles in everything from BLACK HAWK DOWN to his definitive Captain Hook in PETER PAN.The history---though condensed in sections(the battles of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse are combined) is generally excellent with casual references to everything from Kips Bay to Horatio Gates. John Williams....for a change..produced a fine score that can be listened on its own merits without visuals. The dialogue is actual dialogue, rather than mindless catch phrases, with true meaning and emotional import. Historical issues and military tactics are actually discussed. Characters actualy live and breath rather than just exist to provide body count money shots. When someone dies here, the viewer feels it.  The viewer understands what is at stake in this war and feels sadness at the defeats and pride for his/her country as she rises to greatest and victory.Simply put. I love this film to death. Somehow it snuck out of Hollywood when no one was looking and is one of the greatest films of the 21 st century as well as being that incredibly rare bird....a film about the American Revolution......a rarer good film about the American Revolution and of the handfull of truly great films about the American Revolution.One of the very few films made after 1980 that is as good as something made before 1965. One of the very few films made after 1980 that I do not automatically have to treat like a special child since it is, after all, a modern film and it can't help itself.A masterpiece of epic filmmaking. A practical throwback to the 50s/60s era of the genre.Sit down and show this to the kids.......now.Enlightening. Ennobling. Entertaining.

He just wants to live in peace and raise his family and tend his crops.Just like American patriots to this day he did not want war. No, we are a God fearing, peaceful people. But, if our freedom is under attack and our country needs us then we will accept the call to duty. Freedom is not free.This is the true American spirit and even though Australian, Mel Gibson understands it very well. Perhaps it is his faith that ties him together with us. As in a previous film, ""Braveheart"", Gibson is a good man forced into action by circumstances beyond his control to fight the English. And when he does, put on your rain coat because there will be blood, and lots of it, pouring and spraying everywhere. If there ain't a lot of blood shed it's not a Mel Gibson movie. Farmer Mel does the Lord's work, quickly turning into an axe weilding colonial Rambo killing machine. I suppose one shouldn't be surprised at his dispatching of a fairly large number of Red Coats with such efficiency. The peoples' blood lust shall be satisfied with just killings of the wicked. And the English surely are wicked and cruel, at one point burning to the ground a little white chapel filled with innocents. No wonder our brave countrymen fought the Revolution. And watching this vivid and moving history you know God was on our side.Actually, the movie is pretty fascist in it's conception. Leni Riefenstahl would love it. It does make you wonder when something like this is popular what percentage of the masses, particularly the peasantry, is inherently fascist in it's politics.

556815,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00004XPPG,Acute Observer,"[12, 16]","Few films are made about the Revolution since WW II, the financiers on Wall Street must not be comfortable with the concept. The film begins by showing a meeting to discuss Independence, and the need for war. One man talks of &quot;taxation without representation&quot;, but the Declaration of Independence lists all the grievances. (Do you remember them?) There is no mention of the 1765 Stamp Act and the ruinous taxation that followed. There is little said of the business of this planter. Isn't tobacco the equivalent of coca leafs or opium poppies? The film gives an example of the fighting of that time. The Carolinas suffered the most in the Revolution, even more than New Jersey, where many of the battles were fought (the land bridge connecting Philadelphia to New York). The after battle scene shows pistols and muskets used to kill wounded prisoners; they would have used gun butts, bayonets, or swords as in other massacres. The film is accurate in showing boys experienced with firearms, and the use of knives and tomahawks in close combat.Colonel Mel leads his militia into guerrilla attacks on British supply wagons. The militia was usually used to attack foraging troops. These losses tied down the British regulars and prevented their advance. No mention of the Loyalist militia here. The film shows the British setting a trap to ambush the ambushers! (How could this failure of intelligence occur? Just for dramatic effect?) The &quot;Ghost&quot; plays a trick on the General to get 18 prisoners released. Another failure of intelligence? Historians will object to some of the events created for dramatic effects. But popular entertainment isn't academic history. The celebration at the seashore seems designed for an intermission.The scene where the townspeople are locked in a church and then burned alive has been criticized as an invention. But it symbolizes the cruelty and horrors of war in the Carolinas. Afterwards Mel's men catch up to some of the troops. Could that experienced Colonel be surprised by not posting guards? The evil Colonel escapes by a ruse; would an experienced soldier be fooled?The final battle seems to be based on the battle of Cowpens, when the retreating militia led the charging British into the prepared trap and won the battle. There is a final confrontation between Mel and the evil Colonel. Cornwallis is forced to retreat to Yorktown, where the French fleet traps them and forces a surrender. The War of Independence was won! But you owe it to yourself to read a history book to learn more.

Mel Gibson plays Ben Martin, some one that is perfectly content with his life as it is and, will not fight in a war that will that not only destroy the lives of his countrymen, but could be witnessed by the eyes of his children. Soon, as the war starts to tear at his families bindings, He too finds himself wading into its bitter turmoils. After several viewings I see the strong likeness to Braveheart. Someone dies, he is enreged, takes revenge, then is off to war. I have been turning the question around and around in my head, why did they make the story line at such a close resemblance? Maybe, after five years, we needed it. Braveheart struck a chord in me when I saw it, and goodness know's I was proud to have Scottish blood in me, and still am. The Patriot should do something else, and that is: make us proud of our forefathers, and cheer for them. To understand, atleast to some extent, what our ancestors went through. We will never know how that felt. Now, even though we still have fighters and patriots, we will never know what it was like to fight a tyrant king that wants absolute control of our lives, and well being. We will never feel that. The Patriot does give a hint, a glimps, into the way it was. Maybe historically the facts about Francis Marion will never make a perfect appearance on the big screen, but this movie isn't about exactness. It's about our freedom, and the high cost of it; The love we did have for our country, and the reflection of devotion that we should have now. ~S.A.O.S.~",5,A battle at home,993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1610,"['Patriot', 'retelling', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Ben', 'Martin', 'one', 'perfectly', 'content', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'fight', 'war', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'destroy', 'lives', 'countrymen', 'could', 'be', 'witnessed', 'eyes', 'children', 'Soon', 'war', 'tear', 'families', 'bindings', 'too', 'wading', 'bitter', 'turmoils', 'several', 'viewings', 'see', 'strong', 'likeness', 'Braveheart', 'Someone', 'enreged', 'revenge', 'then', 'war', 'have', 'been', 'turning', 'question', 'head', 'why', 'did', 'make', 'story', 'line', 'close', 'resemblance', 'Maybe', 'five', 'years', 'needed', 'Braveheart', 'struck', 'chord', 'when', 'saw', 'goodness', 'know', 'was', 'proud', 'have', 'Scottish', 'blood', 'still', 'am', 'Patriot', 'should', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'make', 'proud', 'forefathers', 'cheer', 'understand', 'atleast', 'extent', 'what', 'ancestors', 'went', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'felt', 'Now', 'even', 'still', 'have', 'fighters', 'patriots', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'fight', 'tyrant', 'king', 'absolute', 'control', 'lives', 'well', 'being', 'will', 'never', 'feel', 'Patriot', 'give', 'hint', 'glimps', 'way', 'was', 'Maybe', 'historically', 'facts', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'perfect', 'appearance', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'exactness', 'freedom', 'high', 'cost', 'love', 'did', 'have', 'country', 'reflection', 'devotion', 'should', 'have', 'now', '~S.A.O.S.~']",N/A

Mel Gibson was excellent. There were other people in the movie who also played their roles superbly. It is a brutally real story of war in people's own backyards and towns, and focuses on one man's struggle to protect his family from the horrors of the war around them.

My fear is that younger viewers will view the British largely as proto-Nazis, the same British who sacrified a generation in WWI before we finally closed it out at the end, who virtually saved western civilization in WWII through their RAF, and are our staunchest allies today. Here we see an incredibly vicious British officer (played convincingly actually by Isaacs) upon whom Gibson, so capable of subtler, touching acting, yet whose acting here leaps over the top, wreaks predictable vengeance. Yes, there are shocking scenes worthy of good action adventures, but when the film depicts the burning of a church full of innocents, which never happened, the viewer must realize he has been had. And this by a director who clearly seeks nothing but commercial cache. And I'm certain Emmerich has earned it by now. Richardson and most of the cast are fine. The cinematography is almost magical, capturing the time, place, and feel of 1776 Charleston.

But enough of Braveheart, let's talk Patriot, the movie is great, the soundtrack is very nice, it was nominated for an Oscar, which proves my point. The acting is quite good, Heath Ledger really surprised me, and after seeing A Knight's Tale, a movie he made after The Patriot, it confirmed me that he is a very good new-comer actor, he really helps the Patriot. And yes, the movie is a bit bias when showing the British as this very bad and evil soldiers that only wanted to kill, watch as in the film a corneal Tavington kills and kills people just because they looked him bad. But hey, don't take it too serious, this is an action film, it's purpose is to entertain and it does it very well, like the Mummy, not a to take it seriously, although this movie has some very disturbing images and scenes, like the church, or the battle scenes with gruesome violence, but that really does not make this movie bad, actually it adds more tension to it, plus, there are not many movies about this period, at least not recent ones, so spend a few bucks and buy this movie, is not bad, it is not a little shadow of Braveheart, it is good, plus it comes in a great DVD, nice special features, although the special features menu is a bit tricky, but nothing to worry about, when you get it you can see trailers, special effects, deleted scenes, talent files, decent special features, the least Paramount could have done for Braveheart. Plus the picture is very clear and the sound, well, let's just say that the muskets have never been as clearer and realistic, plus the soundtrack is pretty well heard and does not alter the dialogue like in some movies, when you get to the first battle you will be hooked to the story, which is not bad in any way.

556826,ASC5CH6RALOHL,B00004XPPG,"Alden Utter ""nedlum""","[2, 5]","It's interesting to look at what sells in movies. World War II has about ten movies set in every front, from the king of war films, Saving Private Ryan (German front) to the subpar Windtalkers (Pacific). Vietnam has about two movies for every month it was fought, and that wasn't even technically a war. But the American Revolution, the war that created the United States-what great movies have been made about that? What happened to the films telling about a man who left his girlfriend one day to die on Bunker Hill? Why isn't there a Boston Massacre thriller? Where is the Benidict Arnold bioepic?The Patriot, it seems, tries to help those of us with an itch for cannon, muskets, and dead Brits. Mel, as often is the case, plays a widower (Gibson loses a lot of wives. The one movie, to my knowledge, that he ends married is Lethal Weapon 4). Mel forbids his son, Heath Leger, from fighting in the revoution; surprisingly, the son enlists in the colonial militia at his first chance. Then there's murders, raids, massacares, betrayals, laughs, ruthlessness, revenge, and a love intrest between Mel and his sister-in-law.Wait... was that plot recap to fast for you? Well, to be honest, I don't feel like saying the entire thing; it's rather dull. The villain, a dragoon colonel by name of Tavington, is shown as ruthlessly evil, through and through, just wanting to kill people to win the war, and get some land - and although fully evil characters are fine, he wasn't enough fun to do fully evil well, and he lacked the motivated evil that would allow him to be dull. Someone - I believe it was General Cornwallis, who has the unfortunate duty of not only surrendering his sword to the Americans (which he gave to a lower officer) but also delivering a god-awful monolouge at the finale about how farmers had defeated him, and the whole world is going to hell - has been told that in return for keeping America, the crown will spilt the colonies with him fifty-fifty, and he offered to give Tavington a substantial portion.This being an action movie in dramatic masking, let's look at the fighting. It's decent, but sometimes it seems like a video game more then anything else. Sure, one guy killing a few brits with no backup other then his twelve year old sons seems possible, but here Mel kills about thirty redcoats without taking a single wound, missing a single shot, or forgetting a single solider. That's only realistic in Medal of Honor, and even then you need a scope to accomplish it. We see cannon taking off legs, but they seem, somehow, less dangerous then those of The Last of the Mohicans. Maybe, however, it's just that Mohicans is a much better movie then the Patriot. The scenes are often colorful in an unrealistic fashion; the best example of this is when the Heath Leger character goes to the window of a house he had entered, and we see an army being routed beneath a sky given an ungodly blue. It's almost as jarring as the fact that this battle is right next to the house, but they hadn't heard the fighting until they got inside it. Or something; I don't remember exactly all the ways the scene was bad.Is The Patriot a bad movie? No, it has some redeeming qualities. More importantly, it covers a war that needs to be covered, and rarely is; I encourage other directors to go out and show Washington's famous Christmas raid against the Hessians in 1776, or ""The Shot Heard Round the World"" at Lexington. But as it stands, if you want a good movie in the age of old style cannon, you've got Gettysburg, Glory, or the Last of the Mohicans as good picks; leave this one on the shelf.",3,A mediocre look at an excelent setting,1036368000,"11 4, 2002",2002,3610,"['interesting', 'look', 'what', 'movies', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'about', 'ten', 'movies', 'set', 'front', 'king', 'war', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'German', 'front', 'subpar', 'Windtalkers', 'Pacific', 'Vietnam', 'about', 'two', 'movies', 'month', 'was', 'fought', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'technically', 'war', 'American', 'Revolution', 'war', 'created', 'United', 'States-what', 'great', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'What', 'happened', 'films', 'telling', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'day', 'die', 'Bunker', 'Hill', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'thriller', 'Where', 'Benidict', 'Arnold', 'bioepic', 'Patriot', 'tries', 'help', 'itch', 'cannon', 'muskets', 'dead', 'Brits', 'Mel', 'often', 'case', 'widower', 'Gibson', 'lot', 'wives', 'one', 'movie', 'knowledge', 'married', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '4', 'Mel', 'forbids', 'son', 'Heath', 'Leger', 'fighting', 'revoution', 'surprisingly', 'son', 'colonial', 'militia', 'first', 'chance', 'Then', 'murders', 'raids', 'massacares', 'betrayals', 'laughs', 'ruthlessness', 'revenge', 'love', 'intrest', 'Mel', 'sister-in-law.Wait', 'was', 'plot', 'recap', 'fast', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'saying', 'entire', 'thing', 'rather', 'dull', 'villain', 'dragoon', 'colonel', 'name', 'Tavington', 'shown', 'ruthlessly', 'evil', 'just', 'wanting', 'kill', 'people', 'win', 'war', 'get', 'land', 'fully', 'evil', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'fun', 'do', 'fully', 'evil', 'well', 'lacked', 'motivated', 'evil', 'would', 'allow', 'be', 'dull', 'Someone', 'believe', 'was', 'General', 'Cornwallis', 'who', 'unfortunate', 'duty', 'not', 'only', 'surrendering', 'sword', 'Americans', 'gave', 'lower', 'officer', 'also', 'delivering', 'god-awful', 'monolouge', 'finale', 'how', 'farmers', 'had', 'defeated', 'whole', 'world', 'going', 'hell', 'been', 'told', 'return', 'keeping', 'America', 'crown', 'will', 'spilt', 'colonies', 'fifty-fifty', 'offered', 'give', 'Tavington', 'substantial', 'portion.This', 'being', 'action', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'masking', 'let', 'look', 'fighting', 'decent', 'video', 'game', 'more', 'then', 'anything', 'else', 'Sure', 'one', 'guy', 'killing', 'few', 'brits', 'backup', 'other', 'then', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'sons', 'possible', 'here', 'Mel', 'kills', 'thirty', 'redcoats', 'taking', 'single', 'wound', 'missing', 'single', 'shot', 'forgetting', 'single', 'solider', 'only', 'realistic', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'even', 'then', 'need', 'scope', 'accomplish', 'see', 'cannon', 'taking', 'off', 'legs', 'seem', 'somehow', 'less', 'dangerous', 'then', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Maybe', 'however', 'just', 'Mohicans', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'then', 'Patriot', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'colorful', 'unrealistic', 'fashion', 'best', 'example', 'when', 'Heath', 'Leger', 'character', 'window', 'house', 'had', 'entered', 'see', 'army', 'being', 'routed', 'sky', 'given', 'ungodly', 'blue', 'almost', 'as', 'jarring', 'fact', 'battle', 'right', 'next', 'house', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'fighting', 'got', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'ways', 'scene', 'was', 'Patriot', 'bad', 'movie', 'No', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'More', 'importantly', 'war', 'be', 'covered', 'rarely', 'encourage', 'other', 'directors', 'go', 'out', 'show', 'Washington', 'famous', 'Christmas', 'raid', 'Hessians', '1776', 'Shot', 'Heard', 'Round', 'World', 'Lexington', 'want', 'good', 'movie', 'age', 'old', 'style', 'cannon', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Gettysburg', 'Glory', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'good', 'picks', 'leave', 'one', 'shelf']",N/A

556832,A928WN8NV03WZ,B00004XPPG,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[1, 1]","First off I will have to admit, I liked this movie.  But it was a mixed bag of good and bad.  It did come out as a lot of people pointed out, like braveheart, but not nearly as good.here are some of the good.The action sequences and cinematography are amazing.  This director really knew how to set up the battle sequences so that they are both picturesque, and frightening at the same time.  This was rated as one of the middle period Napoleonic wars, and the fighting style is much different than what we are used to.  You dressed in bright uniforms and marched to your death.  Cavalry charges were still used to a great degree of effectiveness, and they used them with deadly efficiency.  The cannons were primarily large bullets that they would angle specifically so that they would bounce or skip and hit as many soldiers as they could, similar to a bowling ball.There were some funny moments with Mel Gibson and his children.A few twists and turns were in the plot, where it was following a cliche movie device up until the very end, where they turn it around at the conclusion.Some of the dialogue is interesting and the character motivations were not all standard.  Mel Gibsons characters initial refusal to enter the war, his speech to the continental congress, etc....Like Braveheart it had many historical ideas that were true in a sense, but didn't happen in the same way.  There was a military leader in the british army that practiced a slash and burn operation similar to sherman in the civil war.  As well as other decisions by the British that angered many colonials causing them to join the war when the originally stayed neutral.  Cornwallis was a noted field commander and a favorite of the king.Now for the bad.Some of the cliches were almost laughably bad.The antagonists, though well acted and interesting, were over the top in some key areas.  Cornwallis was not flawless in his exploits, and he was a patriot but actually opposed harsh treatment of Americans before the war, including the infamous &quot;stamp tax&quot;.  Though some leaders in the millitary did a slash and burn campaign, I don't recall any mention of people being burned alive.The method they had for victory in the end was a bit simplistic.  The main selling point was it was the defeat of a giant in the war for independence.  Though the British army in question was a giant in that time, it seemed like too cliche and easy of a ruse, relying on the arrogance of a oppsing general.The ambush sequence where Mel Gibson and his sons killed a large number of soldiers was a bit far fetched.  Though troops at that time were terrible at defending against ambush, they weren't necessarily stupid, and could have mounted a better defense.The murder of his son in the earlier part of the movie was over the top in its attempt to show how wicked the leader of the Dragoons was.

This review is for the video I taped from cable in 2001. I make no assertions about the actual DVD itself, although I reserve the right to revisit the matter once I view the DVD itself.The costumes, production and supporting cast of this movie were A#1! I also loved the portrayal of Lord Charles Cornwallis by Tom Wilkinson, a phenomenal British actor. Rene Auberjonois, fresh off his role from DS9 was a delight to see. I was pleased to see him in a motion picture. He more than held his own as a preacher. I did not like seeing him die.What I did not like was the unrealistic portrayal of Gibson's character as a man who did not have slaves. Everyone I spoke to at the time told me how they did not believe that part of the movie. The war crimes of British soldiers killing women and children are apocryphol. So too was the burning alive of those hapless souls in the church. That scene lowered the rating of this movie by One Star alone while the fight scene between Tarlton and Gabriel was unrealistic. There is no way Gabriel (Played Remarkably By Heath Ledger) would have been lulled in to such a position. Indeed, the very fight was contrived by the burning of the helpless souls in the church. No, I felt that was wrong.Sadly, this very family 75 years later would be fighting against the Union in The Civil War.A.

556834,A2IW4CBVAYQ7ZB,B00004XPPG,andrew bates,"[2, 3]","Mel Gibson has to be one of my favorite actors. His ability goes beyond his good looks and the big action usually associated with his movies. While I had no problems with Mel in this movie, nor the action, the movie dragged, was too cliche, and relied on a love story that was never substantiated. Emmerich was never able to bring any life to the &quot;emotional&quot; scenes that were interspersed throughout the movie. But I don't want to knock on the director, nor the actors too much, for a movie that had a script stock full of cliche's and an immature initiation of Gibson's rage, which anyone watching the movie could see coming a mile away. The action that followed was one of the most intense scenes that I had ever witnessed, outside of the first battle scene in Braveheart. But the movie could not stand on the first rate action alone, which was too little and too far between. I unfortunately have to pit the Patriot against Braveheart (arguably one of the great cinematic achievements of our time). While Braveheart was written so well that good acting was not necessary, but present, to bring out emotion, the Patriot couldn't force it out of you, even with two death's that were before their time (who didn't see either coming). The movie was definitely too long and was weighed down by the minutes, whereas Braveheart moves along at a pace unhindered by time. Lastly, the ending. Maybe Mel was turned off by his Braveheart demise and in this movie went for the exact opposite, or maybe he thought a movie about the revolutionary war should end on a good note; whatever the reason, he missed with this heartwarming end. How much better would it have been had he died on the battlefield, what a fitting tribute for any patriot that believed in what they were fighting for (not to mention just one other way that Braveheart exceeds the Patriot ten-fold).",3,Braveheart??

556835,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004XPPG,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I remember when I first saw this film, about two days after my wedding.  My wife and I were lounging around the house for a week before we left for our honeymoon and so we spent a lot of time watching movies.  Well, we never really say through a movie in it's entirety and so, a few years later, I found that I didn't really remember anything about this movie (outside of that gory hatchet murder scene).So I watched it again.The thing for me is that `The Patriot' is just not that great.  There are a lot of films that circulate this genre, and you really have to stand up tall to be taken seriously.  For me (and I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion), this movie hardly stands tall enough.This is sad, because the performances here are all very, very good, at times broaching on fantastic.  I am not a big Mel Gibson fan (in fact, I've only really ever lauded him in `Ransom') but I felt that he was outstanding here, truly balancing the political, emotional and parental aspects of this man.  He found the grit within the script and used it to bring this character to life before our eyes.  Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is also wonderfully used here.  He had just started building his career in 2000 and this is one of those performances that makes you stand back and take notice.  Tom Wilkinson is always great (I love that man) and even though he doesn't have a huge role, his scenes are brilliantly executed.  Even the token villain role is given an extra push through the eyes of Jason Isaacs, who chews scenery like you wouldn't believe, yet not in that regrettably clich&eacute;d way.But, the films plot, which is little more than a revenge drama, takes this film down a few notches for me.  Unlike `Gladiator', which came out this very same year and used a similar plot structure (to drastically superior effect), `The Patriot' doesn't seem to be able to use that element to its benefit.  Instead, it comes off rather elementary and hollow.The films direction is effective, and the battle scenes (while nothing overly impressive) are very well crafted.  The savagery of certain scenes (like the aforementioned hacking) is also used in an effective and memorable fashion, and the cinematography adds layers of beauty to the films gritty core.  It is entertaining (although I did find that it tended to drag in parts) but it falls short of being anything truly remarkable, despite all that it has going for it.BTW, I'm not a history buff, and I don't pretend to be, so the historical inaccuracies that many have called this film out for don't really bother me (in fact, I didn't even really notice them).  For me, this film wasn't claiming to be a history lesson (which was part of the problem, since the clich&eacute;d `revenge' formula should have been ditched for a more astute look at the war) so I didn't pick it apart for not being one.",3,An entertaining yet hollow look at the Revolution...,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,2866,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'about', 'two', 'days', 'wedding', 'wife', 'were', 'lounging', 'house', 'week', 'left', 'honeymoon', 'so', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'watching', 'movies', 'Well', 'never', 'really', 'say', 'movie', 'entirety', 'so', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'anything', 'movie', 'gory', 'hatchet', 'murder', 'scene', '.So', 'watched', 'again.The', 'thing', 'Patriot', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'lot', 'films', 'circulate', 'genre', 'really', 'have', 'stand', 'up', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'understand', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinion', 'movie', 'hardly', 'tall', 'enough.This', 'sad', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'times', 'broaching', 'fantastic', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fan', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'only', 'really', 'ever', 'lauded', 'Ransom', 'felt', 'was', 'outstanding', 'here', 'truly', 'balancing', 'political', 'emotional', 'parental', 'aspects', 'man', 'found', 'grit', 'script', 'used', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'eyes', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'R.I.P', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'used', 'here', 'had', 'just', 'started', 'building', 'career', '2000', 'one', 'performances', 'stand', 'back', 'take', 'notice', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'always', 'great', 'love', 'man', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'role', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'Even', 'token', 'villain', 'role', 'given', 'extra', 'push', 'eyes', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'who', 'scenery', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'yet', 'not', 'regrettably', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'way.But', 'films', 'plot', 'little', 'more', 'revenge', 'drama', 'film', 'down', 'few', 'notches', 'Gladiator', 'came', 'out', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'used', 'similar', 'plot', 'structure', 'drastically', 'superior', 'effect', 'Patriot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'element', 'benefit', 'Instead', 'rather', 'elementary', 'hollow.The', 'films', 'direction', 'effective', 'battle', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'overly', 'impressive', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'savagery', 'certain', 'scenes', 'aforementioned', 'hacking', 'also', 'used', 'effective', 'memorable', 'fashion', 'cinematography', 'layers', 'beauty', 'films', 'gritty', 'core', 'entertaining', 'did', 'find', 'tended', 'drag', 'parts', 'short', 'being', 'anything', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'going', 'it.BTW', ""'m"", 'not', 'history', 'buff', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'many', 'have', 'called', 'film', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'notice', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'claiming', 'be', 'history', 'lesson', 'was', 'part', 'problem', 'clich', 'eacute', 'revenge', 'formula', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ditched', 'more', 'astute', 'look', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'apart', 'not', 'being', 'one']",N/A

Instead, there are moments of high achievement undercut by sequences that make you embarrassed to watch them.

But, what many seem to forget is that the intention of the movie isn't really about the Revolution. Rather, it is a universal story about a people (and a family) struggling for peace and freedom.Mel Gibson does a masterful job as peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin, who finds he and his family are caught in the middle of a war against Britain's monarchy. He is not the perfect hero that Maximus is in the film ""Gladiator,"" the ""other"" big epic of that year.  After several watchings, Maximus actually grew tiresome as the ""perfect"" hero (Oh, and by the way, ""Gladiator"" is just as historically inaccurate:  there was never any Maximus, Commodus was in many ways very different in real life, and the ending is pure fiction).Not that Benjamin Martin doesn't want to equally tear apart his own archenemy, who turns out to be British Colonel Tavington(Jason Isaacs) who manages to destroy his idyllic world (...) in the process. A word on Tavington:  He's probably one of the best villains in modern movie history, and ranks right up there with Commodus in the movie ""Gladiator."" It's difficult to decide who does the better job. (...) Yes, typical; but so are most revenge movies.Yes, it is a typical ""freedom"" movie; but it perfectly captures the mood of an idealistic people who defied a world power. And yes, the family is a very typical family; but it's supposed to be, because it represents any family during a time of war.Other actors are not bad in ""The Patriot."" Wilkinson as Cornwallis is perfect; his father-figure for Colonel Tavington is a nice touch. Their exchanges are some of the most interesting in the movie. Heath Ledger is also good as the eldest son of Martin.The battles are quite good, though by no means perfect.The only real qualms I have over the movie (...) was a silly side romance that, no matter how I look at it, I still find slightly offensive. Another qualm is the fact that not enough effort was put into bringing out Tavington's side. You have to watch him carefully to realize there's quite a bit of a story behind him other than a colonel who loves to butcher people. The final qualm over the movie is that it doesn't try very hard to include any of the most important events during the American Revolution.  It's a pity not much is said about the Revolution at all.All in all, however, it is a very good movie that should be taken for what it is; not what it isn't.",5,A Review on the Patriot,991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,2544,"['First', 'off', 'certainly', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'movie', 'American', 'Revolution', 'then', 'again', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'what', 'many', 'seem', 'forget', 'intention', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'Revolution', 'Rather', 'universal', 'story', 'people', 'family', 'struggling', 'peace', 'freedom.Mel', 'Gibson', 'masterful', 'job', 'peaceful', 'farmer', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'who', 'family', 'are', 'caught', 'middle', 'war', 'Britain', 'monarchy', 'not', 'perfect', 'hero', 'Maximus', 'film', 'Gladiator', 'other', 'big', 'epic', 'year', 'several', 'watchings', 'Maximus', 'actually', 'grew', 'tiresome', 'perfect', 'hero', 'Oh', 'way', 'Gladiator', 'just', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'was', 'never', 'Maximus', 'Commodus', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'different', 'real', 'life', 'ending', 'pure', 'fiction', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'want', 'equally', 'tear', 'apart', 'own', 'archenemy', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'British', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'who', 'destroy', 'idyllic', 'world', 'process', 'word', 'Tavington', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'modern', 'movie', 'history', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Commodus', 'movie', 'Gladiator', 'difficult', 'decide', 'who', 'better', 'job', 'Yes', 'typical', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'revenge', 'movies.Yes', 'typical', 'freedom', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'idealistic', 'people', 'who', 'defied', 'world', 'power', 'yes', 'family', 'very', 'typical', 'family', 'supposed', 'be', 'family', 'time', 'war.Other', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'Patriot', 'Wilkinson', 'Cornwallis', 'perfect', 'father-figure', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'nice', 'touch', 'exchanges', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'also', 'good', 'eldest', 'son', 'Martin.The', 'battles', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'means', 'perfect.The', 'only', 'real', 'qualms', 'have', 'movie', 'was', 'silly', 'side', 'romance', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'still', 'find', 'slightly', 'offensive', 'qualm', 'fact', 'not', 'enough', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'bringing', 'out', 'Tavington', 'side', 'have', 'watch', 'carefully', 'realize', 'quite', 'bit', 'story', 'other', 'colonel', 'who', 'butcher', 'people', 'final', 'qualm', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'include', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'American', 'Revolution', 'pity', 'not', 'much', 'said', 'Revolution', 'all.All', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'what', 'not', 'what', ""n't""]",N/A

There are the set pieces of Lexington, Concord, Paul Revere's ride, Valley Forge and so on.But the war in the southern colonies was a far more vicious, partisan affair.  The Loyalists - colonists remaining loyal to the British crown were numerous and many formed up military units.  One battle, King's Mountain, was fought entirely between Americans, Loyalists and Patriots.  ""The Patriot"" is a fictionalized account  of events that occurred during this period.  Mel Gibson is a farmer, reluctantly brought into the conflict to save his son from execution as a spy by a very nasty British Colonel, based on the real life Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, otherwise known as ""The Butcher"".  Their conflict is a portrait of the war itself,  compete with ambushes, burinings, and other atrocities.The battle scenes, particulary Cowpens, accurately depict 18th  century rules of engagement, and the costumes are authentic, right down to the buttons.  The role of the French, whose alliance was crucial to winning the war is well represented.  However, this is an entertainment, not a documentary and that is readily apparent.  Mel Gibson is impossibly clever, noble and brave, and the fact of slavery is sanitized to the point of absurdity.

The devastating effects of war upon a civilian population is also integral to the story.All such movies have a memorable villain, this being no exception. Evil British Col. Tavington (Isaacs) targets non-combatants, wreaking havoc until Gibson's Benjamin Martin, aka the ""Ghost,"" finally meets him on the battlefield.At story's beginning, Martin is an advocate for peace because he knows the real consequences of war. In due course we come to understand what violent demons from his past haunt Benjamin. It's a sudden family tragedy instigated by bloodthirsty Tavington, and not Martin's nature, that compels him to again take up arms in what will ultimately be a very personal battle.Sweeping in scope yet always maintaining a most human perspective, skillfully balancing action, romance, pathos and humor, ""The Patriot"" addresses the quandary of what must be done when one's convictions are directly challenged by opposing and overwhelming events.

There was the phone message to his ex-girlfriend which was pretty much insane, his alcohol induced racist tirade in 2006, and of course who can forget his controversial portrayal of the execution of Robin Hood in the critically acclaimed ""Passion.""  In his film ""The Patriot,"" Gibson takes on his most difficult task yet; the merging of multiple characters from different movies while still maintaining their historical relevance in his interpretation of the American Revolution.  The movie opens with little explanation as to how William Wallace (again played by Gibson) came to America some 470+ years following his execution but nonetheless...Wallace is back and ready to avenge his death against Hitler and his British allies during their attempted conquest of the American Colonies.  Gibson's performance is stoic though the historical inaccuracies of the film take away from the overall film quality.  For one, in the film's re-enactment of the Battle of Camden, Gibson identified the 5th German Panzer Division as providing the artillery support against the American Colonists when in fact it was the 3rd German Panzer Division who had this honor.  Another inaccuracy occurred when Wallace uproots his family for a 2 week all inclusive paid trip to Hilton Head Resort, South Carolina...DURING A WAR!!!  There is no record of Wallace deserting the Army during the American Revolution and it is almost certain that he would have been executed for sedition had he done so.  Hotel records have come up inconclusive as well.  There is no visualization of the Luftwaffe's involvement in the Southern Theatre of the American Revolution despite their consistent attacks on American ground forces including Wallace's during the time in which the film is set.  Though these historical inaccuracies take up minimal screen time, for history enthusiasts and scholars such as myself, it negatively impacts the overall critique of the film.  On the flipside, one of the highlights of the film for me was Gibson's use of The Joker played by Heath Ledger.  Gibson's interpretation of The Joker focuses on the early chapters of his life when he was an innocent country boy who finds love amongst war, first with his father's plantation farmhands during his experimental years followed by a relationship with a woman, Anne Howard played by Lisa Brenner.  Gibson really opens the door for Christopher Nolan's later representation of The Joker when Brenner's character Anne spikes Ledger's drink with a blue alcohol concoction in an attempt to turn Ledger's character straight.  As the film plays out The Joker is exposed to heartbreak, being raped by the hands of a woman he came to love, and the pain of losing friends and former lovers to war.  All of the Joker's hardships lead to the creation of the monstrous Joker which Ledger plays brilliantly towards the films conclusion.  Nolan capitalized on Gibson's development of The Joker and even used some of that blue dye from the scene with Howard to help create the face that terrorized Gotham City in ""The Dark Knight.""  At the end of the day, despite the historical inaccuracies, the complex storyline, and character developments, the film is a refreshing and new look at America's fights against Nazi Germany and their British Allies during the American Revolution.",5,The Patriot: Victory for Mel!

War is ugly and costly and the only currency it accepts is blood.The moral of this story is that war should only be the absolutely last resort.

I wished a more credible director would have gotten his hands on this subject first and given it a more acceptable feel, not to mention credibility and dignity. This one felt too ""I. Day"" at moments for me as far as the writing is concerned. And at moments the acting and reality weren't far from that movie either. There's lots of gratuitous dialogue here that is out of place and prevents any serious flow. It added action thriller, good guy/bad guy matinee qualities at moments where simple adherence to historical detail could have created and displayed the wickedness of the war without using Steven Seagal villain archetypes to emphasize those facts. The contrast between good and evil here isn't being questioned. Just the cheesy extent they went to display both. We wanted to defeat the British for our independence. Not the way Niko Tuscani would want to crush the bad guy who he saw kicking a puppy. But that's the quality and feel I couldn't get away from in this flick. As time has gone on, it's also occurred to me how over rated I think Mel Gibson is. I've watched one of his movies more than once-Lethal Weapon. It's one of my faves. But even that one I acknowledge is cheesy and lacks a lot of plausibility. The following Lethals sucked worse as did his acting in them, and his other movies speak for themselves. There's times in this movie where with his delivery at certain serious dramatic points, I expected him to break into Martin Riggs. And I don't care what anyone says. I've never thought Heath Ledger was as great an actor as he was built up to be, and this movie didn't prove otherwise. Their acting, as well as the writing and flow of this movie had such a Hallmark Channel quality to it, I couldn't take it serious. It actually distracted me from the historical content I was most interesting in seeing this movie for in the first place. You can get around that with bad acting, but not bad direction. And Roland Emmerich is one of the worst.  This movie just makes you want to get the bad guy in the end. It could have been for drowning kittens for all I cared. The historical setting was a mere side note and served merely as a backdrop after some point. I give Roland Emmerich way too many chances, for seriousness anyway. I really loved the way they looked out on their front yard through the big picture window chatting quietly while watching the battle take place like they were watching a Holyfield boxing match on a big screen. When a movie closes with the satisfaction of a Charlie's Angels episode, it deserves the snickers it derives. I give it 2 stars because it does have its moment, though too few and far between. And it does have some well depicted historical scenes, though not totally accurate in its recreation for the convenience of the side dribble story lines.",2,Great subject.

The only war movies I really liked were &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot; (I haven't seen &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; yet). The only reason I went to see &quot;The Patriot&quot; is because, when I found out that Roland Emmerich directed it, I gazed upon the film's poster with a sense of humorous irony tickling my funny bone: The guys who made &quot;Independence Day&quot; are making a movie about Independence Day. That just seemed too perfect for me to ignore. So I antied up and walked to the box office (by myself, frown), paid my ticket and walked into one of the stadium seating theaters. I sat down, watched the previews and laughed hysterically at the movie theater's ridiculous promotion music, then I proceeded to kick back and enjoy a terrific movie going experience. &quot;The Patriot&quot; is, like &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; very realistic in its depiction of war, very lushly photographed, and very well acted. Mel Gibson, as always, is charismatic and heroic in the lead role.&quot;The Patriot&quot; is obviously about the American Revolution. As the film opens, we see life on a farm in one of the southern colonies. Mel Gibson's character is attempting to build yet another rocking chair that turns out to be a hilarious disaster. The mail comes, and we find out that his oldest son (Heath Ledger) wants to become part of the Continental Army. Gibson refuses to let him join. The relationship between Gibson and Ledger is immediately established to be one of a son who sees his father as over-protective instead of enlightened and experienced in the calamity of war. Gibson's character is very experienced in war. He is still reverred as one of the great heroes of a battle that he won almost single-handedly. The man knows how to fight, but when it comes to fighting for a cause that is, he agrees, great, but also suicide, and taking care of his family, he chooses family. His wife has already died, and he doesn't wish to leave his children fatherless as well. Anyway, as is expected, Gibson's son gets his own way, and it isn't until the war comes literally into his family's own backyard, leaving him with a dead son and a burning house that he decides to fight. And we understand immediately why this man is seen as such a hero: He can kick Redcoat butt when he wants to. He kills twenty men almost by himself before our very eyes. WOW! (Proposed match-up: Mel Gibson's &quot;The Patriot&quot; character versus Russell Crowe in &quot;Gladiator.&quot; Whaddya think?)Robert Rodat, who wrote &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; also wrote &quot;The Patriot,&quot; and he does a job that is on a par with his previous work, but he ends up surpassing himself with the addition of a splendid villain, played by Jason Issacs, who is a renegade Colonel of the Redcoat army. (Another match-up: Jason Issacs versus Joaquin Phoenix) I loved this movie through and through. Some may say that its pace is a little too slow, but movies like this are intentionally built that way. Besides, the payoff at the end is way to good to cast this movie aside. The characters are interesting, the supporting cast is great, the battle sequences are expertly executed, and visuals are stunning.

While &quot;The Patriot&quot; is certainly more than satisfactory in parts it is not nearly in the same league as  &quot;Braveheart.&quot;I'm sure you know the plot to this and if you  haven't then I'm sure you're best guess will be sufficient. Gibson plays a  Father (with a mysterious, war ridden past) who attempts to keep his sons  away from the war with Britain. Unfortunately his eldest son feels  compelled to go and fight and leaves home. When the British pay Gibson a  visit he sees their harshness firsthand and decides himself to return to  battle.The battle scenes are really incredible. The film's three hour  length would be unendurable had it not been for at least three or four  really first class battle scenes thats save the picture. The Patriot is  also beautifully shot in fine epic style. There is one shot in particular  that stands out: The camera pans across several fields stretching for miles  and you can see at least several thousand soldiers spread out across the  fields. Very nice indeed.Unfortunately there are a number of things that  are just terrible in this film. For some reason American studios seem to  think that by making up history they are doing themselves a favour. The  producers of &quot;U571&quot; certainly thought that. I don't know how this  became such an anti-British film but many of the events are totally  fictitious. In one scene the evil English general locks at least 50  innocent American women and children in a church. He then burns them alive.  It turns out that this never actually occured in reality and has been  staged purely to anger some foolish viewers in the audience. I thought if  you are going to make a historical picture then yes, you can take some  dramatic license with your material. You cannot just make up history as you  please. Why not have Gibson fighting communist China while he was at  it?The scripting is overwhelming bad and frankly the screenwriter  deserves jailtime.

He proved his Critics wrong and made another war film that has all the same ingredients as ""Braveheart"", and it turned out Just as Enjoyable. (I think it's even more enjoyable as it has more light moments than ""Braveheart"")Mel plays Benjamin Martin, an Ex-Military turned Family man. His wife is dead but the family is happy, that is until his oldest son Gabriel (Aussie boy Heath Ledger) signs up to take up arms against the Invading British. Benjamin's choice between Patriotism and Family is most Assuredly Family, but when an Evil British Coronal Tavington (Jason Isaacs ""Event Horizon"", ""Soldier"" and ""Sweet November"") Involves his family in the war, Benjamin leads a Militia group against the British and he Again becomes a Patriot.If ""The Patriot"" had used the same Promotion lines that ""Gladiator"" used, it would say ""The Father.. Who Became a Ghost.. Who Defied a King.. Who Became a Patriot"". (in case you haven't seen it, the people call him a Ghost, because he moves like one) Fans of ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" will eat it up with a Spoon, it is a Classic war film that makes you Laugh, Cry, Cheer, Curse and Applaud until you hands hurt.Mel carries this Epic, he seems to be able to Spit out these Oscar-worthy performances with the Upmost of ease. Heath Ledger (""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""A Knight's Tale"" and ""Two Hands"") make the leap from Teen Heartthrob to Big Screen Heavyweight with his Gabriel, he makes him Ultra-Believable and Infinitely Likeable. Jason Isaac Relishes his Hateable Villain role, Every Smirk made me want to Strangle the man, so Obviously, he did a Very Good Job.The Large supporting cast give All they've Got to their roles. Standouts include Tom Wilkinson (""The Full Monty"" and ""The Ghost and the Darkness""), Chris Cooper (""American Beauty"", ""October Sky"" and ""Money Train"") and Tcheky Karyo (""Nikita"", ""Wing Commander"" and ""Bad Boys""). The Biggest Standout in my opinion is the Young Actor who plays Benjamin's son Thomas (he also stars in Joe Dante's Underrated film ""Small Soldiers"").

556862,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00004XPPG,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[6, 9]","In the years between Braveheart and The Passion Of The Christ, Mel Gibson created The Patriot - a big screen portrayal of the American Revolution against the British crown. Nominated for three Academy Awards, and including a brilliant original soundtrack composed by John Williams, The Patriot is an excellent illustration of the historical roots of American representative government. Mel Gibson stars in the lead role with his usual charismatic screen presence. In essence, this is Braveheart in the foothills of South Carolina, and Gibson's fans will not be disappointed...The year is 1776, and in a small South Carolina town, farmer Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is disheartened to hear of the impending American rebellion against England. A veteran of the French and Indian War, Martin is well aware of the horrors associated with armed conflict. He prefers the safety and tranquility of farm life and encourages his family to do the same. But when his eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) joins the revolution, British redcoats arrive on Martin land and threaten the entire family. When one of Benjamin's younger sons attempts to help his brother, the sadistic British officer William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) cuts him down. The murder of his son inflames the passions of Benjamin Martin who changes his mind about fighting and enlists in the local militia. Hunting down British army officers with the stealth actions of a wild animal, Martin employs guerilla tactics and superior knowledge of the land in order to level the playing field against the world's greatest army...As British General Cornwallis moves his troops into the South Carolina area, Martin leads a band of militiamen who successfully sabotage British supplies, bomb British ships anchored in Charleston, and pluck off redcoats one-by-one. Fighting side by side with his eldest son, Martin hopes to hold off the British advance long enough to receive aid from the French. He also hopes to avenge the murder of his son and give birth to a new nation. But another chance encounter with Tavington results in Gabriel's death on the battlefield.As the American Revolution gains ground against the British forces, Martin engages in a series of bloody conflicts - one of which leads to the inevitable showdown between himself and Tavington, the man who murdered his sons...Released in late June of 2000, just a few days before Independence Day, The Patriot is a well-written, action packed foray into the world of Colonial rebellion. Its stunning portrayal of the American Revolution inspires every viewer who retains a modicum of patriotism for the American experiment, and the fight for freedom makes for a worthy subject. One of Mel Gibson's best movies, The Patriot offers scene after scene of majestic landscapes, elegant soundtrack music, and an overall story dripping with action and suspense. If you loved Braveheart, then you'll definitely enjoy The Patriot. Its similar depiction of an honorable and heroic figure fighting for the freedom of his countrymen makes The Patriot a must-see film for the ages...The DVD Report",4,Braveheart comes to South Carolina...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,3093,"['years', 'Braveheart', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'created', 'Patriot', 'big', 'screen', 'portrayal', 'American', 'Revolution', 'British', 'crown', 'Nominated', 'three', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'brilliant', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'composed', 'John', 'Williams', 'Patriot', 'excellent', 'illustration', 'historical', 'roots', 'American', 'representative', 'government', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'lead', 'role', 'usual', 'charismatic', 'screen', 'presence', 'essence', 'Braveheart', 'foothills', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Gibson', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'year', '1776', 'small', 'South', 'Carolina', 'town', 'farmer', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'disheartened', 'hear', 'impending', 'American', 'rebellion', 'England', 'A', 'veteran', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'Martin', 'well', 'aware', 'horrors', 'associated', 'armed', 'conflict', 'safety', 'tranquility', 'farm', 'life', 'family', 'do', 'same', 'when', 'eldest', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'revolution', 'British', 'redcoats', 'arrive', 'Martin', 'land', 'threaten', 'entire', 'family', 'When', 'one', 'Benjamin', 'younger', 'sons', 'attempts', 'help', 'brother', 'sadistic', 'British', 'officer', 'William', 'Tavington', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'down', 'murder', 'son', 'passions', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'who', 'mind', 'fighting', 'enlists', 'local', 'militia', 'Hunting', 'down', 'British', 'army', 'officers', 'stealth', 'actions', 'wild', 'animal', 'Martin', 'guerilla', 'tactics', 'superior', 'knowledge', 'land', 'order', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'world', 'greatest', 'army', 'British', 'General', 'Cornwallis', 'troops', 'South', 'Carolina', 'area', 'Martin', 'band', 'militiamen', 'who', 'successfully', 'sabotage', 'British', 'supplies', 'bomb', 'British', 'ships', 'anchored', 'Charleston', 'pluck', 'off', 'redcoats', 'one-by-one', 'Fighting', 'side', 'side', 'eldest', 'son', 'Martin', 'hold', 'off', 'British', 'advance', 'long', 'enough', 'receive', 'aid', 'French', 'also', 'avenge', 'murder', 'son', 'give', 'birth', 'new', 'nation', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Tavington', 'results', 'Gabriel', 'death', 'battlefield.As', 'American', 'Revolution', 'gains', 'ground', 'British', 'forces', 'Martin', 'series', 'bloody', 'conflicts', 'one', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'Tavington', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'sons', 'Released', 'late', 'June', '2000', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Patriot', 'well-written', 'action', 'packed', 'foray', 'world', 'Colonial', 'rebellion', 'stunning', 'portrayal', 'American', 'Revolution', 'inspires', 'viewer', 'who', 'modicum', 'patriotism', 'American', 'experiment', 'fight', 'freedom', 'worthy', 'subject', 'One', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'best', 'movies', 'Patriot', 'offers', 'scene', 'scene', 'majestic', 'landscapes', 'elegant', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'overall', 'story', 'dripping', 'action', 'suspense', 'loved', 'Braveheart', 'then', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'Patriot', 'similar', 'depiction', 'honorable', 'heroic', 'figure', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'countrymen', 'Patriot', 'must-see', 'film', 'ages', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Not all men were noble like Gibson's character was, but they did believe in the war against the Brits.

556868,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00004XPPG,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[14, 22]","""The Patriot"" is an immensely entertaining, action packed film with some of the best battlefield and hand-to-hand combat scenes in modern cinema. Mel Gibson plays a retired British soldier and master of a tobacco plantation, named Captain Martin, in South Carolina at the start of the Revolutionary War. As the colonists get fired up and prepare for the eight-year struggle that will ultimately make them Americans the Captain is reluctant to join in the action. Having earned a bloodthirsty reputation in a controversial incident during the preceding French and Indian War, Martin wants no part of the horrors to come. But Martin is unable to prevent his son, Gabriel from enlisting with the rebels and when the tide of the war turns against them, a wounded Gabriel finds himself back on the plantation pursued by British dragoons. When the evil leader of the dragoons captures Gabriel and leads him off to be executed, Martin is suddenly forced to dust off his old war trunk, retrieve his tomahawks and pistols from it, and to fulfill our cinematic hopes by blasting back from his retirement. What follows are some amazing, rifle ambushes, swash buckling, realistically choreographed tomahawk fighting and a whole lot of absurd historical propaganda.Historical propaganda? Yes, I'm afraid so. While the battle scenes in this film are immensely realistic, the historical picture it portrays is specious to the point of idiocy. I don't mind that a whole lot of rhetoric floats around about ""the cause"" and ""the country"" and any other allusions to the magnificent nation to come when in fact the primary cause of the Revolution was the desire to eliminate excessive British taxation. It doesn't even bother me that the film makers go overboard in vilifying the British by having them massacre civilians in a scene more reminiscent of Nazi occupied Europe or a Central American village that had fallen into the hands of CIA trained death squads.What really irritates me is how in a scene that screams of revisionism, a black slave joins the colonists in their final battle and says he's doing it ""for the cause"". Doesn't he realize, as the audience surely must, that when this war is over his people still have one hundred years of official slavery ahead of them, and another hundred years of brutal oppression to follow? Or do the filmmakers hope to persuade us that the Revolutionary War was a beautiful, egalitarian, multi-cultural event? Somehow I doubt audience members will go home and pick up Charles A.

Gibson was alright in his acting ability, although he often seemed to lack the focus he shows in other roles.The movie is quite long, so I would have expected a little better character development, but the film also seemed to lack this.  It was hard to feel for Gibson's fellow militia partners, as the viewer really didn't get a chance to know them.The battle scenes were fantastic though.  A lot of care and detail went into making the scenery look realistic.  The wardrobe seemed to have a nice authentic feel to it as well.Overall, the film was simply okay.

556871,AB34G6VKP28L,B00004XPPG,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 3]","I enjoy this film each and every time I stick it into the player. It's essentially the story of one man's struggle with his faith during the American Revolution. Due to a shameful past during the French & Indian War, Benjamin Martin has no desire to go to war against England. Eventually, when his family is targeted by the ruthless Colonel Tavington (based on historical Colonel Tarleton of the Green Dragoons under General Cornwallis, who was nicknamed ""The Butcher"" for executing prisoners of war), Benjamin joins up with the Colonials.Someone said below in another review that the film was ridiculous because of the 'obvious' traps set for and by the main characters. Contrary to popular belief, the Revolution was full of these acts of sheer blindness or stupidity. Though the British were demonized in this film, they were also notoriously polite, with the exception of the Green Dragoons. One case I might bring up is when they were searching homes for concealed musket-balls and ammo in Concord. A woman denied them access to a room of her house, claiming that another lady was ill inside and shouldn't be disturbed. The British politely accepted this denial and continued their search of the house. Of course, the ONE ROOM they didn't search had the ammo in it! So you can't say Martin coming out into the open to trap a battalion of British soldiers is foolhardy.The film is not perfect, and does play hard and fast with historical facts. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, since we all know what Hollywood loves is a good story. To have a good story play out on screen, you need regular slimy villains who kill for kicks, several heroic leads that may or may not make it to the final credits, and a good heresy or two in order to get the audience stirred up. The actual filmmaking is beautiful. The special effects are good. The soundtrack is patriotic and stirring. The acting is exceptional.As an American whose proud to be an American, I love ""The Patriot."" The DVD is also well stocked with some great featurettes, behind the scenes glimpses, two trailers, and other goodies. The one reason I gave the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is thanks to the commentary by the director and producer. The producer is obviously an educated, knowledgeable man. I enjoyed his contributions greatly to the disk. But Roland Emmerich would do better to avoid commentaries, since it only reveals what an apt fool he is. He sounds like your ordinary thirteen year old fresh out of middle school. Every other word (I kid you not!) is ""like."" I couldn't stand it after about three minutes and turned the volume down whenever he was speaking.Maybe, like, Mr. Emmerich, you know, you might, like, want to, like, work on your, like, adult vocabulary so, you know, people can, like, actually WATCH your, like, commentaries!Parental Note: There's no sex and only occasional mild language, but the violence is extreme in several of the battle scenes.

Mel Gibson is a great storyteller, maybe the best in Hollywood. As in Braveheart, Gibson knows just what emotional buttons to push to draw you in and hold you fast. And one of my definitions of a great movie is a movie that seems shorter than it is. When I saw this in the theater, it felt half an hour long. All in all, a great movie......if you're not conversant in history. You can fudge the history in a movie like Braveheart. The sources are not all that reliable anyway. With the American Revolution, it is another matter. In America, the history is fairly well-documented and everyone knows it so mistakes positively scream at you.  The one thing about this movie that I simply couldn't overlook was its numerous historical distortions.Like? Well there were all those African-American folks about. Seems to me that when dealing with the S word, you need to do one of two things. You make Ben Martin an over-the-mountain man with a Cherokee wife, you bring him across the Blue Ridge Mountains to fight the battle of King's Mountain, and you let him stick around until the end of the war, making wry comments to the slaveholders he's fighting alongside. Or you go ahead, face the problem directly, and make him a slaveholder. Maybe he frees his slaves at the end or maybe he just starts feeling REALLY ambivalent about slavery. The one thing you positively can't do is not to address the issue at all.Or Colonel Tavington. Banastre Tarleton, the man upon whom Tavington is based, was a tough and occasionally brutal soldier. But he was most emphatically not the Nazi fiend portrayed in this movie. There were atrocities committed in the southern theater, but it was usually Ben Martin's neighbors who committed them. There is no record of British officers locking people in a church and setting the church on fire. Tavington's cartoonish sadism was unnecessary and irritating.  All movie &quot;villians&quot; needn't be Nazis or even particularly bad people.Or the battles. How can you have a movie about the Revolutionary War in the South and leave out King's Mountain, the battle that turned the tide? Where was Daniel Morgan? How could Gibson even think about leaving out the Old Waggoner? And what was final battle supposed to be? A combination of the Cowpens and Guilford Court House? The Cowpens alone would have been easier to stage, easier to follow, and much more dramatic.If you can overlook the historical lapses, The Patriot is a great piece of storytelling.

Farmer refuses to go to war; farmer's family is threatened and house burned down by the evil English; farmer returns to his soldier's roots.

When watching Braveheart, you're really rooting for the Scots to whip the English curs. In The Patriot, I just felt sort of empty. As an American you root for the colonials, but the whole jingoistic feel to the movie keeps you from really caring. The English are just SO evil they become caricatures instead of realistic villains. They're mean just for the sake of being mean. Perhaps if the film were a little more historically accurate?Mel Gibson's character, Benjamin Martin, a widower with seven children, is intriguing, but not developed enough to make him that interesting. He's an aged warrior, slow to act, but once his fire is lit, watch out! As members of his family and his militia fall, we're meant to feel more enraged against the English tyrants. It's an attempt to manipulate the audience, but because of the lack of character depth, it's really hard to feel much of anything for the death of two-dimensional characters.I was disappointed in The Patriot. It doesn't live up to its billing and for the most part, it is a failed attempt to stir false patriotism. Better to watch Saving Private Ryan or Braveheart for great, savage battle scenes and greater character depth.",2,Simplistic story; average battle scenes,976752000,"12 14, 2000",2000,1914,"['Patriot', 'was', 'touted/reviled', 'depending', 'who', 'asked', 'being', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'American', 'Revolution', 'are', 'similarities', 'vengeance', 'English', 'being', 'main', 'one', 'description', 'really', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well.This', 'movie', 'suffers', 'pretty', 'weak', 'story', 'Farmer', 'go', 'war', 'farmer', 'family', 'threatened', 'house', 'burned', 'down', 'evil', 'English', 'farmer', 'returns', 'soldier', 'roots', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'dozen', 'times', 'film', 'usually', 'better', 'want', 'see', 'vengeance', 'story', 'greater', 'appeal', 'look', 'further', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'touted', 'being', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'found', 'uninspired', 'unoriginal', 'When', 'watching', 'Braveheart', ""'re"", 'really', 'rooting', 'Scots', 'whip', 'English', 'curs', 'Patriot', 'just', 'felt', 'sort', 'empty', 'American', 'root', 'colonials', 'whole', 'jingoistic', 'feel', 'movie', 'really', 'caring', 'English', 'are', 'just', 'SO', 'evil', 'become', 'caricatures', 'instead', 'realistic', 'villains', ""'re"", 'mean', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'mean', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'widower', 'seven', 'children', 'intriguing', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'aged', 'warrior', 'slow', 'act', 'once', 'fire', 'lit', 'watch', 'out', 'members', 'family', 'militia', 'fall', ""'re"", 'meant', 'feel', 'more', 'enraged', 'English', 'tyrants', 'attempt', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'really', 'hard', 'feel', 'much', 'anything', 'death', 'two-dimensional', 'characters.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Patriot', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'most', 'part', 'failed', 'attempt', 'stir', 'false', 'patriotism', 'Better', 'watch', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Braveheart', 'great', 'savage', 'battle', 'scenes', 'greater', 'character', 'depth']",N/A
556879,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00004XPPG,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[16, 24]","Welcome to the world of the modern epic-A world where history itself will be distorted to fit into a demographically audience tested action film formula while many of it's tiniest details are meticulously made as accurate as possible.  It's not a documentary after all, it's a summer blockbuster from the genius' who brought us Independence Day, Godzilla, and 13th Floor.  It's gotta be good. Right?  We'll spin an American Revolution tale that's part Rambo, part Outlaw Josie Wales and part Mad Max.  The previews will make it look like Braveheart set during the American Revolution, right?. We'll get John Williams to score the thing at his pompous best.  Mel Gibson will give us a really good performance, we'll have a romance or two, and then we'll make sure it's good and bloody too.In fact if there was this much blood in a slasher film, it would be rated NC17.  But, this is a big budgeted picture about a war, so, some splatterfest blood here and there is okay.  Take a head off with a cannon ball?  Sure.  Let a child watch dad put an Ax into someone's forehead-oh it'll be fine.  Sadism?  Brutality?  It's war, it's a big budget summer blockbuster.The film is not as utterly predictable as I thought it might be. It has a lot more gore and brutality than I was expecting and some very dark plot twists. That's the good news.  The bad news is, the film is also a lot more cornier and dumber than I thought it would be.  Hard to believe that a film made today can be cornier, and sillier than films made 50 and 60 years ago.  Well perhaps a lot of the cliche's and corn can be blamed on screenwriter Robert Rodat  he certainly had practice being corny and sentimental with much of his script for Saving Private Ryan.  And I can't say I was expecting a great deal of depth from the directing/producing team of Independence Day and Godzilla.But the corn and sentimentality are just the beginning.I am not an African-American but I was very disappointed with how the slavery issues are all but ignored in a film set primarily in South Carolina.  How the blacks who work for the lead character aren't slaves, `but work the land freely'.  How it's the British who will enslave these supposedly free blacks and force them to fight for them for the promise of freedom  if they survive and the British win.  (In reality both sides promised slaves their freedom for fighting for them and it would be the last time the military was integrated in the U.S. until the Korean War.)Even now in the year 2000, in what amounts to popcorn movies  we feel the need to whitewash our history and turn our past into not just politically correct versions of history but utter historical fantasies.  The Disney studios of the early 1960's would have given us a more accurate view of the South than this movie does.  And it's not okay just because it's ultimately a dumb summer blockbuster movie, because a lot of people believe that at least parts of the film reflect with some accuracy what history must have been like.  There is at least some truth to what occurs in the movie The Patriot. And there's a lot of period detail accurately on display in this film. Costumes were painstakingly recreated right down to the type of stitching they used back in the 1700's.  Accurate historical detail is another matter all together.  Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, who is based loosely on a real character.  But the inspiration for the character was a slave-owner and so obsessed with getting revenge on the British he used brutal tactics not just against the British but also in getting people to join his militia.If you're looking for a big, sprawling, overly patriotic bit of inaccurate goo, this film will fit the bill nicely.  Mel G as Benjamin Martin will lose his cool and become Mad Martin, shooting and then chopping up British Soldiers until he's covered in blood.  Wait till you hear his description of how he became a hero in the French -Indian Wars at a place called Fort Wilderness.So as your groaning at the corny lines and wincing at the cliches, and shaking your head over the lame attempts at humor, you can rest assured you'll be treated to some spectacular, sometimes very bloody action sequences.The chief villain is also loosely based on a real person.  But here, he's made into a horrible, sadistic, nasty brute of a man who will shoot an unarmed 14 year old boy in cold blood in front of his father, and drag off the father's other son to be hanged. James Bond needs villains this cruel. Jason Isaacs professionally spits out the scenery he chews upon.  He makes a good Snidely Whiplash of a villain.  The fact his real life counterpart wasn't quite this despicable matters not to the film-makers.  Making things as cartoonish as possible is what made them a ton of money with Independence Day, and they were hoping to strike gold again in a film about a different kind of Independence Day.Actors like Joely Richardson and Chris Cooper and Rene Auberjonois aren't asked to do very much at all.  They play their caricatured roles as convincingly as anyone could.I suppose we should be grateful we have a film that is at least superior to the Al Pacino /Hugh Hudson  stinker Revolution (1985).  It is ... but that's not saying much at all.You'll thrill at the scene where Ben picks up an American flag his son has been repairing and leads a rag tag army against the British.  You'll ignore how Ben is nearly killed, sliced open with a sword, and within a day or two is completely recovered and riding a horse again.The film is loaded with corn and cliche's.  Ben Martin is really the only character in the film who's got any depth whatsoever and everything is so ridiculously stacked in his favor even his vengeful, bloody methods seem more than justified against the utterly evil and sadistic British.The DVD has quite a few extras including a director and producer commentary and a couple of behind the scene featurettes which detail the historical accuracy of the period details .  There's also a short segment showing how they digitally created hundreds of extras for the battle scenes, and how they blew a man's head off with a cannon ball.  It's splatterific !!!!I started listening to producer Dean Devlin and director Roland Emmerich's blow by blow commentary track on the DVD.  Sometimes director , producer and actor commentaries can be quite interesting either from a technical film-making perspective or from a colorful behind the scenes story perspective.  Sometimes the commentaries are very funny, sometimes they are very insightful and downright educational.I knew this was not going to be one of the most memorable of commentaries when Devlin and Emmerich  began by gushing unashamedly over their own company's logo at the beginning of the movie and how it was the best part of the film.  A bad joke...because they are at least partially right-- maybe the logo is the best part of the film.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

556880,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B00004XPPG,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[1, 1]","Anyone looking for anything with Mel Gibson in it will certainly be satisfied with ""The Patriot,"" but anyone expecting even a semi-accurate look at possibly the most important events in American history better look elsewhere. From the film's outset, Gibson plays his character of farmer-turned militia leader Benjamin Martin with a sense of brooding and always with a voice of reason and logic, until he cries for revenge. The film starts with talk of the pending revolution and Martin's objection to it on moral grounds and not because of loyalty to the crown. But Martin is dragged into the revolution as a reluctant libertarian when oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) defies his father's command to stay at home and leave the fighting to other patriots. Along with fighting, Benjamin is something of a diplomat in negotiating with British Gen. Cornwallis, played with some historic accuracy by Tom Wilkinson (""In the Bedroom""). As a fighting patriot, Benjamin tastes the bitterness of revenge when he vows to take out sinister British Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs in a thoroughly villaneous and worthy performance). As a historical piece, ""The Patriot"" disappoints, but it may well not have been intended as a period piece. Rather, it renders itself to the impact of revolution and war on the families of their fighting men and on civilian populations. Keeping that in mind, ""The Patriot"" is a worthy project, and it serves to further bolster Mel Gibson as a talented actor and craftsman of tremendous range.",3,More entertainment than history,1044316800,"02 4, 2003",2003,1510,"['Anyone', 'looking', 'anything', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Patriot', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'even', 'semi-accurate', 'look', 'possibly', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'American', 'history', 'better', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'outset', 'Gibson', 'character', 'farmer-turned', 'militia', 'leader', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'sense', 'brooding', 'always', 'voice', 'reason', 'logic', 'revenge', 'film', 'talk', 'pending', 'revolution', 'Martin', 'objection', 'moral', 'grounds', 'not', 'loyalty', 'crown', 'Martin', 'dragged', 'revolution', 'reluctant', 'libertarian', 'when', 'oldest', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'father', 'command', 'stay', 'home', 'leave', 'fighting', 'other', 'patriots', 'fighting', 'Benjamin', 'something', 'diplomat', 'negotiating', 'British', 'Gen.', 'Cornwallis', 'played', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bedroom', 'fighting', 'patriot', 'Benjamin', 'bitterness', 'revenge', 'when', 'take', 'out', 'sinister', 'British', 'Col.', 'Tavington', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'thoroughly', 'villaneous', 'worthy', 'performance', 'historical', 'piece', 'Patriot', 'disappoints', 'may', 'well', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'period', 'piece', 'Rather', 'impact', 'revolution', 'war', 'families', 'fighting', 'men', 'civilian', 'populations', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'Patriot', 'worthy', 'project', 'further', 'bolster', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'talented', 'actor', 'craftsman', 'tremendous', 'range']",N/A

556891,A2GYX971VETQBV,B00004XPPG,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[0, 0]","One can easily discuss the negative aspects of ""The Patriot.""  The film is not historically accurate; its main character (played by Mel Gibson) is an utterly perfect and flat character that has no visible faults and is somehow able to articulate the ideas of freedom better than the framers of the Constitution; the film is slanted towards the American side, portraying the British in an overtly negative light; the blacks and French are underplayed and stereotyped; etc.  But to conclude that the film has no worth based upon these points is ridiculous.  One must step back from the film and ask, ""Was I entertained?  Did the movie hit upon some things that made me think?  Feel?""""The Patriot"" is certainly an enjoyable film visually.  The battle scenes are terrific and provide a plenty of visual and emotional interest-an aspect that is surprising with its long pans and relatively slow camera angles.  The scene in which Gibson first ""re-enters"" his warrior mode and almost single-handedly takes on a British regiment of twenty soldiers has some spectacular hatchet fighting and hand combat choreography.  This scene alone makes the film worth watching for any lover of guerilla tactics or knife fighting/close combat.  On top of the action, the screenplay is quite clever in parts, despite its tendency towards the sentimental.  Mel Gibson's performance seems very much like a continuation of his role in ""Braveheart""-one can hardly notice a difference in the characters.  But he plays this part well, the part of a man who alone can save a country from the oppressive enemy.  In the scenes where he deals with the loss of his family his acting is moving and quite believable.There is much to dislike in this picture.  If one is upset by the historical inaccuracies, I ask why they are looking to Hollywood to fill them in on American history.  Writing a film that satisfied all of the points mentioned above would not only be an impossibility-it would be boring and lack any appeal.  This movie tells the story of a man who fights for his family and, in doing this, for a new country and an ideal.

They kill one of his young'uns and they lock a congregation inside their church, including his daughter-in-law, and burn it down.  Now there is no historical record of the British committing such an atrocity,but, hey.  The film also kind of inflates the role of militias in the winning of the war.  Where would the army of George Washington have been without them?  Did I forget to mention the pre-teens who pick-off the approaching British troops?

Heath Ledger as his son gives a charismatic turn.  Tom Wilkinson does the most he can with the role of General Cornwallis who,on paper, is buffoonish.  Jason Isaacs is evil incarnate as Taviston, the loathsome British officer.  Really good camerawork here by Caleb Deschanel.  The definitive film about the American Revolution remains to be made.

556900,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00004XPPG,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[16, 27]","Mel Gibson once again aptly discharges the role of the reluctant hero who ultimately feels compelled to risk life and limb for his nation.  A family is provided to move the plot along.  The sons' commitment to the revolution places the Gibson character in an inescapable predicament.  A loyal wife and adorable  little girls tug at our heart strings.  The viewer after the first five minutes should easily guess how the plot will unfold. Tom Wilkerson as the British  General Corwallis plays the part of a man who will abide by his strict military moral code even if it will hurt England's chance for victory.  On the other hand, his  underling performed by Jason Isaacs is the pure personification of evil.  The latter relishes torturing and murdering those who oppose King George 's  government.  Isaacs is at his best when ordering the so called traitors burned alive in the church. The director Roland Emmerich knows how to film scenes  guaranteed to glue viewers to their seats even though this movie is longer than it should have been.  The editor could have cut at least ten minutes of  footage without harming the finished product.One of the most most hysterically inane aspects of &quot;The Patriot&quot; is how it dishonestly portrays the plight of black people during this era.  We are suppose to be  persuading into believing that the colonists were convinced egalitarians who respected the rights and autonomy of Afro-Americans.  Alas, nothing  could be further from the truth.  There is arguably more good than bad resulting from our fight for independence, but the Revolutionary War was not fought to  give freedom to all human beings, only establishment white men.  Slave owning was one the &quot;rights&quot; the colonist demanded from the British.  Members of the  black race would have been far better off if the British had won the war.  Great Britain was one the few noble countries strongly opposed to slavery.The battle scenes are well done. Although the scene where the head is shot off from the body is admittedly gory, this is what  warfare is really all about.  It is far more preferable to boldly confront the awfulness of battle.  A Pollyanna like perspective may inadvertently encourage a reckless  attitude.  Pacifism is not a legitimate option for a great nation, but neither is loving war for its own sake tolerable.&quot;The Patriot&quot; is one the strangest major films ever produced.  I haven't a clue why those responsible for putting together this project chose to slander the people of  Great Britain.  The standard excuse that a certain degree of embellishment is warranted in order to enhance the story line simply makes no sense.  A more truthful  adherence to actual historical documents would have likely increased ticket sales.  Many folks almost certainly stayed away from the box office due to the  controversial falsehoods.

The acting is great although Gibson occassionally seems a a bit awkward with the 18th Century dialect. I seem to have detected more than one similarity to Gibson's own family life. Besides the fact that he has seven children in real life, the daughter-in-law of his chracter, Benjamin Martin, is named Anne Patricia, which was the actual name of Gibson's mother.

Mel Gibson plays a farmer who is an ex-guerilla fighter who is reluctant to take up arms against the British until a tragedy occurs in his family that forces him to take a stand.  Critics of this film have liken this to a Mad Max film but his re-transformation back into the warrior mode is plausible. Of course, there are some dramatic licenses taken here since Gibson's character is a composite of many of the types of American heroes like Francis Marion aka ""The Swamp Fox"" and also depicted in Disney film years ago by I believe, Leslie Nielsen before he descended or risen into his famous comedy mode (The Naked Gun). The Blu-ray transfer of this extended version is excellent and a special mention should be made of the excellent acting of Jason Issacs as the villainous British officier who forces Gibson's hand in a pivotal moment.

It is a brutally real story of war in people's own backyards and towns, and focuses on one man's struggle to protect his family from the horrors of the war around them.

But underneath all this is a movie that carries on too long. I have no problem with long movies, but at 2 and 1/2 hours watching a film by the same team who made &quot;Godzilla&quot; is unfair.Mel Gibson is not at fault here, who plays a  retired soldier raising his several children by himself. He does his best withe the material he was given.  After something terrible happens to a loved one, he starts a vigilante war against Great Britain.There is too much going on in this movie, with his oldest son falling in love for the first time and Mel's budding relationship with his dead wife's sister. It just seems there is not enough justification to drag this movie on like the producers did. What made me give this film 3 stars is that even though Roland Emmerich is not what I consider a good director when it comes to character interaction, he did do a fine job on the battle sequences, much like in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, another film he did.This a film you may want to see once, but not again and again, because there is too much distractions going on during the main story. One earlier reviewer was right though by saying that scacrifices were made during the Revolution for the greater good of the Colonies, not for a single person to seek vengeance. And the notion that the children would not see anything wrong with their father seeing their aunt is totally ridiculous.

556910,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00004XPPG,D. Litton,"[1, 6]","Mel Gibson has always been a very powerful actor when he plays a father or a hero. In these types of movies, his characters always have just cause for revenge and extensive displays of either muted or expressed emotion. &quot;Braveheart&quot; allowed him to indulge in his leadership qualities, while playing a very emotional role. &quot;Ransom&quot; allows him to play the part of a caring and loving husband and father, which he does extremely well. &quot;The Patriot,&quot; his latest movie, is yet another chance for him to show these character traits in fine form, matching his performance in &quot;Braveheart.&quot; Gibson gives us an emotionally charged performance as the main character, proving his worth in Hollywood.And the movie itself isn't that bad, either. I have found that many historians and buffs have criticized the movie for its lack of authenticity, but if you don't have a clear knowledge of the events of the time period, or you can set aside your need for the true facts, then the movie works on the basis of its emotional and surprising plot. It's one of those feel-good movies where you know what is going to happen, and then the ending is completely different. It can be a bit trying at times, due to its length, and will test the patience of many viewers, but the material is solid and ends up pleasing us.Taking place during the Revolutionary War, the story begins in a day in the life of Benjamin Martin, who lives peacefully in his South Carolina home with his five sons and two daughters. As the battle between the statesman and the British becomes heated, Martin's son, Gabriel, takes up arms, despite his father's opposition to the war. Gibson, along with Heath Ledger, have a unique father/son chemistry onscreen that is believable and emotional, hitting home for those interested in this aspect of the plot. Their bond strengthens once Gabriel returns, soon followed by a brigade of British soldiers. Their home is burned, Gabriel is taken away, but not before his brother is killed in trying to save him.The movie takes on a bit of the &quot;Braveheart&quot; incentive for Gibson's character here, as Martin's son's death sparks him into action, leading him to victory over the soldiers holding Gabriel hostage. He and Gabriel soon begin forming a group of rebels in a Militia against the British soldiers, as the cunning and ruthless Colonel William Tavington closes in on &quot;The Ghost&quot; responsible for the dent in the King's Army. Martin and his men ride to many victories, keeping their honor and their dignity, but soon, Martin realizes that he will have to face the armies of the British head on in order to protect his family, now under the care of their Aunt Charlotte.The movie has the overall look and feel of a big, booming epic, and while it's not up to scale such as past films like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Titanic,&quot; it still is good, rousing entertainment for mass audiences. It has many elements which will appeal to many different demographics, one of which is two separate romances that build within the movie's plot. One involves Gabriel, who falls in love with and marries a girl from a small town. Their relationship also provides some comical relief, mostly in the parents, who react just like today's parents would if their daughter were in love (though I don't think too many people sew their daughter's boyfriends into straight-jackets). The other romance involves Benjamin and Charlotte, his deceased wife's sister. The relationship between these two characters may be taken as controversial to some; I mean, come on, what are the kids supposed to think? She's their aunt, but the movie never dives too heavily into this relationship, so we're never given enough time to really think about it.Another contributor to the movie's epic feel is the grand photography and cinematography, headed by photographer Caleb Deschanel, who brings lots of beauty and slow motion to the movie to bring us into the action as well as surrounding us with the unseen beauty of nature. By unseen, I mean that those involved in the battle never lament over nature's beauty, and it seems to close in on them at times, surrounding them with noises of crickets in the night, or green leaves of brush and trees. Lighting plays a key factor in certain scenes, most notably during the raid on Charlotte's house, adding a sense of heightened suspense to the moment. Slow motion strengthens the display of the horrors of war, which are vastly displayed in graphic shots, giving us all the brutality of the Revolutionary War.The story, while relying on some formulaic elements, also keeps the movie's epic appearance up, following the trials and tribulations of a man whose life is in danger every minute of the movie's most intense moments. Martin's story, while being fictional, is quite moving, powerful and emotional. Benjamin has his values, which makes him an admirable character, and his children are embodied with those values, which makes the bond between father and family very strengthened and moving.The historical aspect of the movie is going to be a factor of controversy among everyone who sees this movie that knows what really went on during the Revolutionary War. People will say that the historical aspect is authentic and makes sense to the movie, while others will say it is a cheap attempt to bring the war to life with a fictional story for its premise. I, myself, do not know off the top my head anything about the Revolutionary War, and that is why I enjoyed this movie as I did because I don't have to worry about criticizing it for its accuracy or inaccuracy. For me, everything else in this movie works, so I was able to find it satisfying.Just as Gibson gives his powerhouse performance, the rest of the cast also gives us stellar performances that add heart and feel to the movie. Heath Ledger, who starred in &quot;10 Things I Hate About You,&quot; takes on a very adult role in this movie, and does so with ease. He never flinches, and his performance never falls short. Jason Isaacs plays Colonel William Tavington, who is pompous, arrogant and ruthless in his war tactics. He brings all of this and more to the role. Joely Richardson is Charlotte, strong and gentle, who cares for Benjamin's children and with whom she shares a strong chemistry, even if briefly. Other actors include Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo, Rene Auberjonois and Tom Wilkinson.While not the best epic ever made, &quot;The Patriot&quot; is by no means a failure, and its integrity, emotion, strength and intelligence all make it worthwhile in watching. The overall effect one feels after watching this movie is one of satisfaction, and that is more than most movies can account for. It dazzles the senses while keeping us intrigued by the story of one man's struggle to free his family from oppression.",4,Mel Gibson brings on the action!,985996800,"03 31, 2001",2001,6859,"['Mel',

I've read lots of the reviews about Patriot here, and everybody say it's cliche. Well, I don't disagree with those because it's cliche. But the point is, 99% of all movies is cliche and the other 1% are not the best ones. When watching a movie, story is the least important factor for me. If I rate Patriot part by part, I'll give 5 stars to Emmerich in the first place. He's a talented director, although lots of people would disagree, he shooted ID-4 and Godzilla perfectly, the best way which can be made out of those foolish scripts. For the first time, he has a good script, Patriot and he used his talents more than ever and shot a really powerful action-drama. The editing is revolutionary for me. Especially in the scene where Gabriel and militia fights the redcoasts after the church is flamed. The editing in that small battle will be a pure entertainment for those who love good edits. The music by John Williams (The biggest movie score composer of all time) is as always, nothing to say much, it's perfect. Acting is also good, especially Gibson performs his role very well.  The story behind all this is american independence war and the movie includes lots of dialogues about warfare. Especially the scene where Martin talkes to Lord Cornwallis about the war.  The dialogues are well written in every scene, there's no un-natural ones which lead to the next important dialogues ( Gladiator is full of them ). So the movie is the best of the season and also the year. If you like action and big war-scenes, definitely watch this movie and if you want more than action, Patriot is also a good drama after all.

There was no burning of a church with a number of colonists in it.  The real Tarleton survived the war and went home to Great Britain.

This movie is historically inaccurate, filled with lies and misrepresentations of what really happened. The Americans were responsible for their own fair share of attrocities in the war, perhaps more so than anything the English did. Furthermore the main character was not the shining light he is portrayed to be, but rather a vicious, brutal slave owner who was notorious for the extreme abuse he inflicted on his slaves.

556924,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00004XPPG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE PATRIOT (2000, not to be confused with Steve Seagal's excellent 1998 film of the same name - even the DVD covers are identical with face-on portraits of the respective stars) is the story of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a South Carolina State Legislature member and former hero of the French-Indian War.Harrison Ford turned down this role, angered that the film portrayed the Revolution as a one-man crusade of revenge, which I think is silly. I'd have loved this film with Ford rather than Gibson, yet I can understand why Ford got angry about this fairy tale in lieu of some more solid, reliable history.The year is 1776, and on the Martin farm it looks like all peace and tranquility. News of the Revolution is anxiously awaited by Benjamin's sons Gabriel (Heath Ledger, how sad to see him looking so young and beautiful) and Thomas (equally lovely Gregory Smith). They want to sign up and fight. Martin is opposed to the war, though he concedes America ought to be free.Gabriel enlists and Benjamin can't stop him. Later, Benjamin is quartering both British and American wounded at his home. The Darth Vader of England, Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) shows up, gets irked and burns the Martin house to the ground after murdering the American wounded. Benjamin still resists any involvement, but hits the ceiling when finally, young Thomas is murdered by Tavington.This is when The Ghost is born. Martin tears off after the officers who have Gabriel and dispatches them with heavenly force. I have to say, when we first saw this film, we thought it had great stuff in it that has influenced lots of subsequent films. Director Roland Emmerich (of several favorites of mine including2012,10,000 B.C.- vid. my review -The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)andIndependence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)) took his time with this.With extensive help and consultation courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution, Emmerich delivered a picture-perfect, detailed rendering of that era not to be matched until HBO gave usJohn Adams. Though a fictional story, most of the characters are based on real folks. General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) is all too real. The Smithsonian even allowed the producers to examine genuine uniforms from the period, and one of the producers remarked how moved he was when he saw sweat stains in a uniform's collar. He remarked, ""It was the sweat of the endeavor to free this country!""There are too many stellar performers to list them all - but now here comes the ugly of it: this movie LOVES the slow-mo, and it gets irritating in a film that is 165 minutes long. There is a lot of sub-par operatic music by John Williams, but an equally generous number of brilliant themes that show up in the HARRY POTTER films too. The dialogue is too modern, and is sometimes just as irritating as the shots of a screaming Mel Gibson smearing themselves at a snail's pace across the screen.It is this along with the fact that this story is a work of fiction that makes it too much of a fairy tale for my taste - but then, I am not complaining and I never did complain about that. Hopefully this will silence the unworthy criticism of anyone who states the fact that this is a fictional story. It is barely - just barely - based on a true character and events.Furthermore, though I thought I detected a few added scenes in this special-edition DVD, the special features are pretty rotten. Only an hour-long documentary or a piecemeal documentary with good information can make such a DVD release truly ""special"" - and this thing is missing all that in spades.All in all, if it is understood this is a fantasy (or ""fairy tale"") film with painstaking detail, it is not only worthy of viewing; it's darned good. You may not feel so patriotic about it, but you'll feel it's a good film. Many reviewers here seem to despise it for some reason, but I loved it overall. One doesn't need to be a historian - or claim to be a historian - to love a film like this.However, I think they'd have gotten a lot more mileage out of it if they had entitled it ""The Ghost"", made it closer to an actual historic event, and had not stinted on some of the matters of good taste.One final note: while I made what I saw as good edits to this review, I did not do it for the happiness or edification of any other reviewer here. Or any commenter, or any random screwy person. I frequently edit my reviews to improve them. So I will not be adding any names to the review's authorship or thanking anyone in particular.

However, the rest of the characters appeared one dimensional and uninteresting to me, particularly the evil colonel, who is a cardboard cutout villain with no redeeming qualities (the writers don't even bother to delve into his motivations for the atrocities he commits to set himself up as Martin's nemesis).

Not this work.I've seen this movie on the wide screen  ,and I tell you - don't see it. It's a waste of time and money.When I  had first seen the poster and heard about the plot ,it blew my mind. I  thought to myself &quot;Five years have pasted since the last spectacular  epic (BraveHeart)-it's time for another great historical performance of the  man !&quot;Soon enough I realized how far and at the same time  &quot;close&quot; to the truth I was. As I was watching the film I could  notice, although seeing it for the first time, how many motives of  BraveHeart were copied to the movie ,changing only names and dates.For example ,(I'm not going to ruin the film to those who would see it  anyway!)Gibson in this era of the pre american independence day war doesn't  wanna fight! what a surprise! Exactly like in BraveHeart-not for  long...Someone of his dearest must die in order to completely change his  mind and heart.The story continues as he succeeds to gather the  crumbling militia forces,causing heavy loses to the enemy and so on,as was  the script in BraveHeart.Even the love story is lame ,childish and  dissatisfying,very far from the original &quot;Model&quot; of this film.  Not to mention the battles ,in which blood is seen everywhere ,wounded and  deceased scattered ,maybe like in the original battles , but you can't help  the feeling that something is wrong or missing.It actually made me  angy to witness the shameless mimicry that surroundes the entire movie.I'd  come to see someting new and intelligent ,to discover this dissapointing  consequence.I would'nt want to burden you any further with  descriptions or analysis,just to say again - spare your time.

Darling ""naive cynic""","[3, 4]","My boyfriend and I watched this movie for a second time last week, and even sitting at home I was completely drawn into the film. This is the kind of movie which makes me forget I'm even *here*; the living room disappeared, and the images on the television screen absorbed me in a way that few films are able to.Mel Gibson has cast away any remaining doubts I previously held regarding his ability to act; while his ""Hamlet"" and ""Braveheart"" roles certainly showcased his range, his Benjamin Martin blows me away. His anguished eyes as he tries to cope with ""Legends of the Fall""-like tragedy convey emotion that I have not often seen, andhis grim determination in the battle sequences is unparalleled. Heath Ledger delivers another strong performance, and gives me faith that another excellent leading man is in the making here. Eight-year-old Skye McCole Bartusiak gives a surprisingly skilled and intense performance as Susan, and I really look forward to seeing her in future roles. In this film, she was one of those rare children's roles that I absolutely fell in love with.Other really enjoyable players were Chris Cooper (in a role completely unlike his performance in ""American Beauty,"") Tcheky Karyo (as yet another incredibly likeable Frenchman,) Jay Arlen Jones (as the loyal, illiterate Occam,) and Jason Isaacs (as the blazing-eyed, cruel Tavington.) While those roles certainly stand out, nearly everyone in this film gave their all, and on the whole, it's a wonderful piece.The depiction of the battles of the day is gut-wrenching; the research the filmmakers performed pays off with realism in such scenes as the horrifying surgical tents, and the cannonball rolling through the troops. While there is a fair amount of blood and death, it is not gratuitous; much like ""Black Hawk Down,"" it is simply another element of the story which is neither overdone nor brushed aside.There are few, if any, glaringly obvious anachronisms or plot inconsistencies that I saw - if they existed, I was too wrapped up in the story to notice. There are many emotional moments, but most of the cast doesn't go over the top and stray into the overly-melodramatic. There is suspense, action, betrayal, battles, romance, loyalty, and the best and worst of human traits.

This movie takes place in South Carolina back in the 1776 struggle to free ourselves from British rule.The hero, Benjamin Martin is the consolidation of many patriots, and it surfaces the tremendous sacrifice endured by our ancestors, who survived through the destruction of their homes and the trauma of losing family members to the cruelty displayed by many a British soldier.Benjamin Martin, masterfully played by Mel Gibson, is a hero of the French-Indian war, who witnessed such cruelty during the many battles he survived that he has decided to live by peaceful means and not get involved in what he augurs to be a rather brutal fight that shall not take place in a remote location, but that will take its toll in every backyard of the residents of the town where he lives with his six children.

How did the slaves and ""free blacks"" really feel about this? How were one man and two kids able to take out twenty armed soldiers? That was the one scene that really got me. Of course Gibson is a trememdously talented actor and plays the part well of a commander who is hesitant about joining the war due to some lingering guilt from the French and Indian war. The brutal killing of his son right in front of him and the fear of losing another son in combat drives him to pick up arms and join the cause.Jason Isaacs was also a good actor. Some people are just born to play the villan, and he is one of them. His ""brutal"" tactics keep you in constant shock and awe, and remind us that war is hell, and none of that crap that Cornwallis was talking about ""fighting like gentlemen"". This is war, not a tea party!There is a lot of conflict in this film. Martin doesn't really know if he fighting for the cause or for his sons. Either way, mission accomplished. Sometimes motive doesn't matter. Wilkinson doesn't really know whose side he is on, but decides to play it safe and fight for England, although his burning of the church probably led him to ""fall on his sword"" in battle out of guilt. Tavington is trying to prove himself worthy of a hero in this war but is constantly thwarted by Cornwallis, who wants him to be nice and stay his brutal tactics.

I cannot imagine being a student and sitting in a classroom (High School or college)and not being taught the American Revolution and all its military campaigns. I feel it would be un-American to do so. I would probably die from boredom if the American Revolutionary war were taught only as a social history. This great country of ours was forged in blood, and to deny our students from learning the military aspect of our history would be a disservice and a dishonor, not only to our students, but also to our great Nation. What kind of social or cultural history would we have had had we not fought the British in order to gain our independence ? We would have had none. Therefore, the answer lies in military history.Mel Gibson's character is a composite of two historically famous indiviuals: Francis Marion and Daniel Morgan. The final battle in the movie is loosely based on the battle of Cowpens, where we achieved not only total victory over Tarleton and his Tory legion, but also over British regulars.I would like to thank Mel Gibson for having the courage and integrity to make such films as Braveheart, We were once soldiers, and the Patriot.

556940,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004XPPG,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 9]","War is horrific.  If there is one message that comes across clearly in this film that is it.  ""The Patriot"" is an extraordinarily graphic and compelling depiction of 18th Century warfare.  It is difficult to imagine a scene more terrifying than the sight of thousands of men leveling muskets at you from a distance so close you can see the sweat on their faces.  Woven into this revolutionary war film was a human drama about a man and his family and the devastating effect the war had on them.In an effort to make the audience sympathetic to the hero, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan), wrote an overly melodramatic and sentimental script with excessively noble Americans and incredibly evil Brits.  Though I didn't have a real problem with this, I can see how many people would be rolling their eyes, especially the ones whose top priority was the war itself.  Still, for those who like a good human drama, this film grabs the emotions and makes one scream out in vindication when the bad guys get what they deserve.  It is also difficult not to feel a bit patriotic while watching this film.  I was put off however, by the preachy, politically correct pabulum regarding the slave soldiers.Other than that criticism, which is more a matter of personal preference, this film was extraordinary.  It was brilliantly directed.  With this film, Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day) has moved beyond schlocky sensational films and actually assembled a substantial film with a story that wasn't tongue in cheek.  If there is one area where Emmerich excels, it is visual effects, and this film is another shining example of that.  He created graphic and grisly effects of decapitations and dismemberments that were disturbingly realistic.  His choreography of the combat with thousands of extras was magnificent.  In some cases, he used computer simulations for panoramic battlefield scenes that were indistinguishable from action created by real humans.  The costume design by Deborah Lynn Scott (Wild, Wild West, Titanic) was superlative.  She actually went to the Smithsonian Institution to use real revolutionary uniforms as her models for the patterns.  The entire period was fantastically rendered.  The five-speaker surround sound on the DVD was awesome, especially during the combat, with voices and battle sounds coming from all directions.The acting was superb.  Mel Gibson was completely immersed in his role as the reluctant Colonel, for whom the war was a personal vendetta.  He had to handle quite a range of emotions, from the tenderness of a father to the rage and savagery of battle and the seething hatred of the murderous dragoon.  He was outstanding in every scene.  Heath Ledger (Ten Things I Hate About You) was also excellent as the Martin's idealistic son whose war started as patriotism and became personal in the end.

556943,A36CRRNKFUP1HU,B00004XPPG,Frankland S. Strickland,"[1, 4]","With all of the numerous titles that have been released in the last ten years concerning World War II, and with all of the Vietnam War titles released in the 80s and 90s, I'd have to say that it's certainly time we had something---anything---concerning, perhaps, the most important war in American history. I'm sure there are a few old ""black and whites"" out there from many years ago that might fit the bill, but until ""The Patriot"" was released a few years ago it seemed as if this chapter of American history had gone largely ignored.I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is an accurate depiction of any particular event during the Revolution---it is not by far. It does, however, capture more or less the zeitgeist, or the ""spirit of the age,"" as well as could be expected given its largely fictional plot. In other words, it's more like a ""Platoon"" rather than a ""We Were Soldiers"" or a ""Pearl Harbor"" as opposed to a ""Saving Pvt. Ryan.""Historians, like myself, will nevertheless tip their hats to the screenwriters who based many of the characters in part on real historical figures. Take the lead role played by Mel Gibson for example. Gibson's character, Benjamin Martin, is sort of a mix between the very real Daniel Morgan and the very real Nathaniel Green. The villainous Colonel Tavington, played to perfection by Jason Isaacs, draws many parallels to the infamous ""Bloody"" Tarleton of the British Dragoons. One might even be led to believe that the part of Jean Villeneuve is based on a likeness of Lafayette. Some characters in the movie, of course, are indeed based on real people. Tom Wilkinson plays a very convincing version of General Lord Cornwallis.Given that the costuming and special effects with the battle scenes seem right on the money, you'd think that this movie would hit the bulls eye in terms of its historical value as well as its entertainment value. Unfortunately, there are just a few too many cheesy ""Hollywood moments"" to merit this movie being an all-time classic. Sure, it is quite plausible to believe that a veteran of the bloody French and Indian Wars would have had more than his fill of fighting and would be reluctant to join the Revolution. It's even believable to imagine his willingness to revert to the savagery of war when he witnesses one of his sons being murdered in cold blood by an overly villainous British officer. What is not believable, however, are the cheesy comical moments (duping General Cornwallis) or the cheesy ""political-correct"" moments (having freed Blacks working his plantation in South Carolina). There are also a few too many mushy love scenes and a bit too much of totally inaccurate British atrocities, as well as the cheesiest moment in the movie----a dejected and depressed Benjamin Martin finally deciding to do ""the right thing"" and returning to the ""Great Cause."" Watching him ride alone across a field with the morning light as a backdrop, complete with a war-torn and tattered American flag---well, that's going a bit too far for me. I almost expected him in blue woad paint and kilt rallying his beleaguered Highlanders before the English onslaught.Despite its somewhat over-reliance on sentimentality and overall cheesiness, this movie should still satisfy both the historian as well as the casual movie observer. There is indeed intense action and some degree of suspense throughout. Just don't expect an 18th-century ""Saving Private Ryan"" and you shouldn't be too disappointed.",5,As close as we can get . . . for now.,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,3478,"['numerous', 'titles', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'concerning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'titles', 'released', '80s', '90s', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'certainly', 'time', 'had', 'something', '-anything', '-concerning', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'war', 'American', 'history', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'old', 'black', 'whites', 'there', 'many', 'years', 'might', 'fit', 'bill', 'Patriot', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'seemed', 'chapter', 'American', 'history', 'had', 'gone', 'largely', 'ignored.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'give', 'impression', 'movie', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'particular', 'event', 'Revolution', '-it', 'not', 'far', 'however', 'capture', 'more', 'less', 'zeitgeist', 'spirit', 'age', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'largely', 'fictional', 'plot', 'other', 'words', 'more', 'Platoon', 'rather', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'opposed', 'Saving', 'Pvt', 'Ryan', 'Historians', 'will', 'nevertheless', 'tip', 'hats', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'based', 'many', 'characters', 'part', 'real', 'historical', 'figures', 'Take', 'lead', 'role', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'example', 'Gibson', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'sort', 'mix', 'very', 'real', 'Daniel', 'Morgan', 'very', 'real', 'Nathaniel', 'Green', 'villainous', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'played', 'perfection', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'many', 'parallels', 'infamous', 'Bloody', 'Tarleton', 'British', 'Dragoons', 'One', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'led', 'believe', 'part', 'Jean', 'Villeneuve', 'based', 'likeness', 'Lafayette', 'characters', 'movie', 'course', 'are', 'indeed', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'very', 'convincing', 'version', 'General', 'Lord', 'Cornwallis.Given', 'costuming', 'special', 'effects', 'battle', 'scenes', 'seem', 'right', 'money', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'hit', 'bulls', 'eye', 'terms', 'historical', 'value', 'as', 'well', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'cheesy', 'Hollywood', 'moments', 'merit', 'movie', 'being', 'all-time', 'classic', 'Sure', 'quite', 'plausible', 'believe', 'veteran', 'bloody', 'French', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'fill', 'fighting', 'would', 'be', 'reluctant', 'join', 'Revolution', 'even', 'believable', 'imagine', 'willingness', 'revert', 'savagery', 'war', 'when', 'one', 'sons', 'being', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'overly', 'villainous', 'British', 'officer', 'What', 'not', 'believable', 'however', 'are', 'cheesy', 'comical', 'moments', 'duping', 'General', 'Cornwallis', 'cheesy', 'political-correct', 'moments', 'having', 'freed', 'Blacks', 'working', 'plantation', 'South', 'Carolina', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'mushy', 'love', 'scenes', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'totally', 'inaccurate', 'British', 'atrocities', 'as', 'well', 'cheesiest', 'moment', 'movie', 'dejected', 'depressed', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'finally', 'deciding', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'returning', 'Great', 'Cause', 'Watching', 'ride', 'alone', 'field', 'morning', 'light', 'backdrop', 'complete', 'war-torn', 'tattered', 'American', 'flag', '-well', 'going', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'almost', 'expected', 'blue', 'woad', 'paint', 'kilt', 'rallying', 'beleaguered', 'Highlanders', 'English', 'onslaught.Despite', 'somewhat', 'over-reliance', 'sentimentality', 'overall', 'cheesiness', 'movie', 'should', 'still', 'satisfy', 'historian', 'as', 'well', 'casual', 'movie', 'observer', 'indeed', 'intense', 'action', 'degree', 'suspense', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', '18th-century', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed']",N/A
556944,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00004XPPG,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[4, 6]","It seemed for a time that Mel Gibson thought that the one thing that makes a new picture better than his last picture is a higher body count. Rack up an astonishing 182 dead bodies in 'The Patriot'. This includes death by all manner of devices 'civilised' and otherwise, including a beheading by cannonfire. Did such things happen? Indeed. Do such things continue to happen around the world? Well, there are fewer tomahawk axings (save at the occasional baseball game) but, yes, alas, we still live in a violent world. Does a movie like 'The Patriot' gorify, er, I mean, glorify it too much?I thought this was a reasonably good movie. I could have done without the more than 1-dead-body-per-minute body count, but I thought this was an interesting tale.--Double standards in movies--One thing that irritates me, if you will permit me a brief digression, is that this epic film competed in epic terms, with the earlier summer release Gladiator. One criticism of Gladiator I heard over and over was that it was not true to the history of the time. I did not hear that criticism levelled at The Patriot, which is just as fictional while being based in a real-world scenario.Of course, another parallel with Gladiator that I couldn't help but notice is that of a major villain (the emperor Commodus in G, and the despicable Tavington (played admirably by Jason Isaacs) here) taunting our hero to try to make him lose his cool, only to be rebuffed and get his come-uppance later.Ah, formulas aren't just for the chemistry lab...--Basic Plot--Mel Gibson turns in his usual good performance as Benjamin Martin (how colonial a name is that?), a widowed single father of a large brood of children, who had had enough of war in the French and Indian War (perhaps America's most forgotten war), reluctantly goes along with his idealistic son as he determines the best way to preserve his family (his personal definition of and attachment to liberty) is to drive the British out.There is a dark secret in Martin's past (which I won't reveal here). Alas, I didn't think it was THAT dark, but then, in colonial times, well...Of course, the British (in this film, and in real life) had no reason to think that they could ever lose this war (the loss of the colonies is perhaps best likened to America's failure in Vietnam -- how can a superpower, and Britain the strongest superpower of the time, lose a war against underequipped, ill-trained, poorly disciplined... well, you get the drift).The battlefield drama, the struggle to decide what is right and wrong, the fight with the inner demons and the past, make this an interesting psychological drama despite the pile of dead bodies in the background.--Production notes--The costs were staggering, but this held all the elements for a summer blockbuster -- star power, compelling theme (ID 4 also grabbed the July holiday slot, and did well, and shares many of the same people in production with The Patriot). Many have described this as the American Braveheart -- I wonder, if Gibson were not in, if that would be true? Gibson claims not to have given much advice to the filmmakers of 'The Patriot', whereas he was in charge of Braveheart. If the battlefield scenes look similar, that is because battlefield scenes do look similar, over time (and across films).--Historical notes--This movie shows in stark terms some of the conditions and costs of the American Revolution/War with the Colonies. It is perhaps one of the more regrettable wars in human history, much more akin to the American Civil War a century later, as it pitted relatives and friends against each other.

When we get some inkling of the suffering endured by those who fought to secure the freedoms we all now take for granted, perhaps we won't be in such a big rush to abandon those freedoms every time the going gets a little tough. I think this movie does a good job of walking the line between telling a patriotic story about a war that I'm glad we won on one hand, and making war look too glamorous and fun on the other. Some have said the British were unfairly shown in a bad light, but I'm told that the atrocities depicted were based on true events. And &quot;our&quot; guys were not exactly made out to be angels, either.This movie had a few minor faults. I couldn't count all the guys knocked off running horses at preposterous ranges by shots fired from smoothbore flintlock pistols. The bit about the token black militiaman was a little sappy.

He won't tell his kids and he refuses to accept any honor or mention from other citizens with regard to that time.He is essentially a pacifist now. Then one of his boys is murdered by British troops and he goes into a berserker rage. Well, heck yes! And the way he goes after his revenge is sweet! It is deserving and justified.Then he sort of wimps out. Oh sure, he had the fire and fury to murder all the troops who were taking orders to do the unjustified actions, but when he finally gets a chance to go after the commanding officer who actually and quite literally murdered his son (and subsequently murdered another son and many many others at his order), well ol' Mel's character seems to have wimped out.Why is this? Is it Mel's fault? Yeah, in part it is. He's more than a bankable star. He can greenlight films and he certainly has creative control over just about any picture he's involved with. So why didn't Gibson's character get sweet revenge against this British officer? Who the heck knows?I do know that the battle in which he kills that officer is less than fulfilling and certainly nothing less than a standard battle scene.I can assure you that if my sons were murdered and the wives and children of my friends were burned alive, I'd be living large with a murderous rage - and since this is the Revolutionary War, Gibson's character would have too.The film is well developed and over all, effective, but the climactic final scene is anything but climactic or satisfying. It's almost as if the film starts out with conviction and then by the end of the film, we are being fed some sort of PC crap that ""we should take the higher ground and be humane"". Well screw that!

556948,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B00004XPPG,G. Garner,"[10, 17]","I am a huge fan of this movie. I am reasonably knowledgeable about the American Revolution, but I certainly make no pretense of being an expert. However, I would like to respond to some of the criticisms that have been made about the film in regards to its historical accuracy. It seems to me that most of the things that are considered controversial are difficult to characterize as being either historically valid or not.For example, when it comes to the most harrowing moment of the movie, the church burning scene, the producers themselves make no pretense that this actually happened. However, there are endless anecdotes about other acts of unspeakable cruelty. Torture and mutilation seem to have been rather commonplace in this particular theater of the war.Of course, some of these tales may be nothing more than wartime propaganda. I think that the best way to put this in perspective is to recall that the British considered the colonists to be guilty of treason. The British penalty for treason at this time was singularly unpleasant. What Tavington did to the colonists in that church may have been little worse than what they might have endured if they had been arrested for treason and shipped overseas to stand trial. Also, remember that the British used Native Americans during the revolution as allies. People who had the misfortune to fall into their hands as prisoners of war could expect treatment that would make the cruelty depicted in the Patriot look like something out of a Disney movie.If anyone feels that I'm simply making that up, they are welcome to look the following incidents up for themselves.1.The Wyoming Valley Massacre-American prisoners were tortured to death(often tied to small trees or stakes, and then burned alive-but slowly,in a prolonged fashion, to make their pain as excruciating as possible).2. The Cherry Valley Massacre-A whole community, including dozens of women and children, were butchered with hatchets and tomahawks3.Hayes Station-The incident which most closely parallels the fire in the movie-A wooden structure is set ablaze, and when the Americans evacuate, they are hacked to pieces by William Cunningham and his men(but at least they didn't burn up, right?)In fairness, most of this was done by people fighting as allies of the British, rather than the British themselves. American loyalists and Native Americans perpetrated some of the more sadistic atrocities. (I seriously doubt that it made the deaths of the victims any less dreadful).The British used the Iroquois as allies. They knew full well how these people operated. Torture was an integral part of their existence.(They used it on other Indian tribes long before the white man arrived.) They were known to torture people for prolonged periods, sometimes even going so far as to nurse them back to health so that they could torture them some more.Once they were turned loose, the war took on a far more horrific tone. Patriots were, on occassion, disemboweled, burned alive, or subjected to other hideous torments. While this was in a different theater of the war, it still happened, and it was done on the British behalf. (If I pay a guy to burn your house, wouldn't I deserve prison just as much as him?) If anything, this film held back in depicting the cruelty of the conflict.(To be fair, it held back on both sides.)Simply put, the critics are correct in claiming that the scene is a fabrication.However, it is so heavily inspired by reality that there is little reason for anyone to claim that it is unfair. I have read that the man who was responsible for the most American suffering was actually a jailer. He simply pocketed the money that was supposed to supply their food and let many of them starve. But, of course, this storyline doesn't make nearly as exciting of a movie.Another thing that seems to draw a lot of criticism is the portrayal of Tavington, the evil British commander. He is heavily based upon Banastre Tarleton, but there are elements of other people in his character, as well. Some have claimed that he was too cruel to be a believeable figure. I am not at all sure about that. I think the producers simply wanted to make him a symbol of what was most heinous about the war. This has led some to call him a mere caricature. However, his only genuinely unbelieveable trait is his lack of human empathy. While his hard-heartedness is certainly unusual, we all know that such people do exist. This seems to be the defining characteristic of what modern psychology calls a sociopath-the lack of empathy for the suffering of other people. Handsome? Cunning? Utterly ruthless and cruel? It sounds like Tavington, but it also sounds like Ted Bundy, who was all too real. Overall, the movie gives him credit in the area where the real-life Tarleton would have probably most wanted it-as a soldier. Tavington is depicted as fully the equal of the hero in regards to strength and courage. If you'll recall, in the climactic fight with Benjamin Martin, he basically had the fight won, but forfeited his life by taking a minute to gloat.Again, he is an unreal character, but he is not nearly as farfetched as some folks seem to imagine. I believe that such attacks on the movie reveal more about the critics than they do about the movie itself. Any doubts? Ask yourself one question: Have any of these people ever complained about the depiction of the movie's hero? After all, the Mel Gibson character admitted to having participated in a massacre when he was a young man that, by his own accounts, was probably just as painful for the victims as what Tavington did later on at the church.Yet I have yet to hear one word of complaint about that fact. Such people will attack the movie for 'deifying' the hero owing to his being the employer of free men rather than slaves. I suppose that the fact that he admitted to butchering people(while they were still alive) was not enough to save the film from being accused of whitewashing history.It's not perfect, and the critics do make some valid points. All in all, though, I do feel that the Patriot is a better exploration of the motivations behind fighting than most war movies. Mel Gibson's character is not a man who jumps because some bureaucrat behind a desk tells him to. He fights only when provoked, which is far more in keeping with traditional American ideals than most of our recent military machinations.In the end, I love the movie and the extras are pretty good. Most of the criticism is rooted in validity, but is excessive in tone. The film isn't perfect, and I would prefer that it had been about twenty minutes shorter. But for people who love adventure stories that feature strong, charismatic characters, I would recommend this one highly.",5,yet another history major,1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,6750,"['am',

The American director and writer are the real villains in this flop, not the British officers. A great opportunity to make a Rev War battle flick that outdid the modest British-produced 'Revolution' and the flawed but spectacular 'Gettysburg' was lost by hackneyed reversion to Hollywood cliche, presumably to appeal to every segment of the woefully ignorant American family audience. Plot, character, behavior, score, costume design, art direction, etc. are almost all wrong. The Continental and Brit infantry extras (mostly re-enactors) do a decent job in the battle scenes which are otherwise ruined by absurdly incorrect artillery. Even the sets are wrong, being highly sanitized representations of very primitive Carolina living conditions. The infamous Tarleton and his British Legion are clothed not in their distinctive green jackets but in something better suited to a comic operetta. Too many failings in fact, dialogue, lifestyle, behavior, costume, arms, etc. to allow any but the ignorant to suspend disbelief. A mockery was made of American/British military history and cynically clothed in jingo-istic flag-waving - a fitting film to represent the hypocritical mis-representations and false 'patriotism' of the Bush administration.

556951,A7Y6AVS576M03,B00004XPPG,gobirds2,"[1, 1]","THE PATRIOT remains controversial to this day. There has always been much controversy over its historical accuracy and the scene where soldiers under British command huddle American colonists into a meeting house and set fire to it killing all inside. The strength of THE PATRIOT is that it is a large budgeted film set during colonial America and the American Revolution. Films set in this time period are far and few in between. Yet, the one scene that defines THE PATRIOT is the ambush scene where Mel Gibson along with his two very young sons fire on and decimate a column of British soldiers who have Gibson's son eldest (Heath Ledger) a prisoner and are taking him away for a certain to be held execution. An English officer has just killed Gibson's third eldest son at Gibson's homestead. Following them Gibson now catches up with them on a forest road where they are now en-rout with Ledger. The ambush that erupts is an incredibly filmed and edited and very powerful scene with muskets being fired and rapidly reloaded by Gibson's two youngest sons as Gibson darts back and forth being trees firing on the column. Redcoats fall one by one and as Gibson moves in closer he uses a tomahawk to slaughter his enemy in a most brutal fashion. He mercilessly and brutally bludgeons the last British soldier trying to escape Gibson's blood curdling rage in one of the most horrifying scenes ever filmed.It is interesting to watch Gibson's rage during these moments. As an actor he is totally focused during this scene. Yet, during many other scenes during this film his performance seems distant, detached and indifferent. Chris Cooper playing Gibson's former commander Colonel Harry Burwell is very well cast and gives a much levelheaded performance as the colonial military leader. Tom Wilkinson playing Lord Cornwallis is brilliant as always and is a great leveling counterpart to the evil Colonel William Tavington played by Jason Isaacs. Isaacs is so good at unlikeable characters. In all, I watch this film from time to time and enjoy the parts I like and overlook a lot of things I do not like about this film. I would never dismiss this film because it truly shows how history can be rewritten or retold and there is always going to be a lot of inaccuracy. And that is why I love history books.

The cast is masterful at what they do, and the writers have truly made a movie that has brought the story full circle as well as developed a plot making the audience think about the true value of family, and patriotism, and how the two work togetherThe Patriot is a movie about a man named Ben (Mel Gibson), a hero of the French and Indian War. A man who just wants to raise his seven children in peace. But it's not going to be that way. The Revolutionary War is starting and his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) enlists to fight for his country and his belief that all men are created equal. The war still seems far away until the day when it comes too close to home for Ben's comfort. In a rage, Ben and two of his young sons kill over twenty British officers. Ben's unique and somewhat savage way of fighting is described by a survivor of the battle. ""It was like he was a ghost... one moment he was there, the next, he wasn't"" This earns him the nickname ""The Ghost"" and the wrath of the British officers. Sending his young children to live with their Aunt, he joins the war, gathering men to fight with him. Using tequnices that surprise and mock the British, they begin to turn the war around in their favor. The Patriot shows Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger at their best.

What this film does is to incorporate all of the bad teaching many received on the Revolutionary War and then invent some of its own.I gave it three stars just for the costumes and settings which were fun to see.  Also from the perspective that aside from being so flawed it was fun to watch.Historical flaws:  It was the British not the Colonists that offered slaves their freedom for fighting.  Remember George Washington was a man of his times and was a slave owner.  I still believe he was a great man and an even greater general.  He alone devised the strategy to defeat a much more powerful force through attrition, economics, and political stalemates.The British did not fight cruelly like this movie portrays.  Except for remote instances where the offenders were duly punished the British fought with honor often times allowing colonists to retreat amidst certain annhilation.  If anyone fought ""dishonorably"" it was on the U.S. side but war is hell isn't it?The French did not join for La Libertad!  The French have never done anything that doesn't directly benefit the French.

556965,A2GYIDJ1COED2K,B00004XPPG,Ihazo,"[26, 59]","Even before its world premiere, The Patriot had become the center of not one, but two, controversies. Because the movie depicts children shooting  rifles, it came under fire by certain anti-gun groups. And, because the  main character is a fictionalized representation of Francis Marion, who has  been confirmed as a hardcore racist by historians, questions had been  raised about the film's choice of a protagonist. Perhaps these two issues  were needed to spark interest in this film because, based on content alone,  there's not much to get excited about. This is a derivative and  relentlessly mediocre piece of propagandaThis film was also advertised  as the Revolutionary War equivalent of Gibson's great Scottish epic  &quot;Braveheart&quot;, but it's nowhere near as good and does a much more  methodical job of demonising the British while glamorising a revolt. The  narrative essentially consists of Gibson seeking revenge against those evil  Redcoats for the murder of his son - and that's it. Of course there is the  over-the-top politically correct civics lesson on race that has nothing in  common with real history.  Indeed, the most unrealist aspect of this film  is the  dainty treatment of slavery. In late colonial  times, South Carolina's whites were outnumbered  three-to-one by Indians -- of whom The Patriot  has  none -- and black slaves, of whom we meet  perhaps four;  the colony's militia, reports  historian Howard Zinn, was  too occupied  controlling slaves to ambush many redcoats.Martin has black servants and field hands, but  they're all free - yeah, right!  -- and Gabriel  assures a black militiaman who's been promised  his  freedom after a year's service that slavery is  a sin of  the Old World. (Perhaps young Gabe was  unaware that the  Continental Congress had  recently excised a denunciation  of the slave  trade from slaveholder Thomas Jefferson's  Declaration of Independence.)Then  there's the cured white racist militiaman  who just  before the climactic battle tells the  black soldier how  honored he is to serve with him  -- and then emphatically  repeats himself, just to  impress us with the filmmakers'  sincerity.Along with the over-the-top vilification of the English  (their anti-partisan activity is not unlike the Nazis), Roland Emmerich  needs to stick to Big Lizards and UFO's and leave American history alone.",1,Propaganda,967680000,"08 31, 2000",2000,2370,"['Even', 'world', 'premiere', 'Patriot', 'had', 'become', 'center', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'controversies', 'movie', 'children', 'shooting', 'rifles', 'came', 'fire', 'certain', 'anti-gun', 'groups', 'main', 'character', 'fictionalized', 'representation', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'who', 'been', 'confirmed', 'hardcore', 'racist', 'historians', 'questions', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'film', 'choice', 'protagonist', 'Perhaps', 'two', 'issues', 'were', 'needed', 'spark', 'interest', 'film', 'based', 'content', 'alone', 'not', 'much', 'get', 'excited', 'about', 'derivative', 'relentlessly', 'mediocre', 'piece', 'propagandaThis', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'advertised', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'equivalent', 'Gibson', 'great', 'Scottish', 'epic', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good', 'much', 'more', 'methodical', 'job', 'demonising', 'British', 'glamorising', 'revolt', 'narrative', 'essentially', 'Gibson', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'evil', 'Redcoats', 'murder', 'son', 'course', 'over-the-top', 'politically', 'correct', 'civics', 'lesson', 'race', 'nothing', 'common', 'real', 'history', 'Indeed', 'most', 'unrealist', 'aspect', 'film', 'dainty', 'treatment', 'slavery', 'late', 'colonial', 'times', 'South', 'Carolina', 'whites', 'were', 'outnumbered', 'three-to-one', 'Indians', 'whom', 'Patriot', 'none', 'black', 'slaves', 'whom', 'meet', 'perhaps', 'four', 'colony', 'militia', 'historian', 'Howard', 'Zinn', 'was', 'too', 'occupied', 'controlling', 'slaves', 'ambush', 'many', 'redcoats.Martin', 'black', 'servants', 'field', 'hands', ""'re"", 'free', 'yeah', 'right', 'Gabriel', 'black', 'militiaman', 'who', 'been', 'promised', 'freedom', 'year', 'service', 'slavery', 'sin', 'Old', 'World', 'Perhaps', 'young', 'Gabe', 'was', 'unaware', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'had', 'recently', 'excised', 'denunciation', 'slave', 'trade', 'slaveholder', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Then', 'cured', 'white', 'racist', 'militiaman', 'who', 'just', 'climactic', 'battle', 'black', 'soldier', 'how', 'honored', 'serve', 'then', 'emphatically', 'just', 'impress', 'filmmakers', 'sincerity.Along', 'over-the-top', 'vilification', 'English', 'anti-partisan', 'activity', 'not', 'Nazis', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'stick', 'Big', 'Lizards', 'UFO', 'leave', 'American', 'history', 'alone']",N/A
556966,ATZPI8XK3KP7,B00004XPPG,Ikihi,"[1, 14]","The Patriot was made in 2000 and it was directed by Roland Emmerich. It is a Historical fiction Hollywood movie about a family who lives in South Carolina in 1776 whose lives are deeply affected by the American Revolution. The movie has a definite bias in favor of the American colonists and against the British and colonial loyalists. Benjamin, the protagonist, his family and the other colonials are portrayed as loyal patriots who are noble, brave, and determined to fight off British aggression. In contrast, the British are portrayed in a very negative light as sub-human, ruthless soldiers who fight and kill without morals. The important antagonists in the film are loyalist Captain Wilkins who betrays the colonists and British General Tavington who was portrayed as a blood thirsty monster.The movie portrays the British as beasts without morals. Benjamin's oldest son, Gabriel, is portrayed as brave and noble. Gabriel stumbles into his father's house all bloody one night and warns that the British Green Dragoons under General Tavington murdered all of his regiment who surrendered. Then, British troops swarm upon Benjamin's house the next day. General Tavington orders his men to burn down Benjamin's house because their family is taking care of wounded rebel soldiers. By giving this order, this makes Tavington look sub-human because Benjamin, a loyal patriot, was taking care of wounded British soldiers also.  In the next scene, Gabriel tells Tavington that he is the rebel dispatcher they are looking for in order to protect his family. Tavington declares that since he is a spy, he will hang, even though this is against military protocol of the rules of war. Benjamin pleads to Tavington to let his son go. Tavington aims a pistol and inquires whether Benjamin wants a lesson in the rules of war. The lesson would be a pistol shot to Benjamin's head. Benjamin is trying to stay out of the war because he has a family to take care of. This scene suggests to the audience that the Americans are being victimized and dragged into a conflict with Britain rather than choosing to do so by their own free will. Tavington then orders all the wounded rebels to be killed. We then see a scene of them executing all the wounded soldiers. We see a kid crying after this scene which adds to the sympathy for the Americans. The British look like murderers who lack human feelings. Benjamins 2nd oldest son, Thomas, decides to attempt to save his older brother Gabriel, however despite his brave actions, Thomas gets shot right through his heart by Tavington. I believe the director did this to symbolize that by attacking families, the British are attacking the back-bone of the revolution. This scene was deliberately done to further make the British look sub-human because they killed a kid who is 15. After Thomas dies and his older brother Gabriel is captured, the British carry out the order to torch and burn Benjamin's house. This is symbolic because the movie is further suggesting that the Americans are being forced into this war and no longer have a choice in the matter because it is affecting their personal lives. Benjamin wanted to stay out of the war and now he is being led to conflict with the British.Later in the Movie during a battle, Gabriel also is killed by Tavington. For Benjamin, hearing of his son's death is the last straw and he is now convinced that he must join the war effort. The movie again portrays that Benjamin was forced into this conflict rather than choosing to do so. The movie shows him proudly carrying the American flag in battle. Benjamin looks noble and determined. He bravely fights to end British oppression and to bring justice for the death of his sons.At one point in the movie we observe loyalist Captain Wilkins, who has been acting as a spy by giving information to the British about the colonials. He is sitting on his horse and just watches while Tavington traps a group of innocent civilians and children inside a church and then sets the church on fire. The church burns up and kills all the people inside. The movie also again uses children here to make the British look especially evil. When Captain Wilkins just rides off with the British General Tavington, the movie is portraying the loyalists in a bad light because Wilkins did nothing to stop Tavington.The movie raises some viewpoints concerning American foreign relations. In the scene where Benjamin went into a frenzy and hacked a soldier to pieces with an axe, the audience is led to believe this is okay because the British have been established by now as the sub-human enemy. But if a British soldier killed an American like at this point in the film, it would have been seen as completely evil and barbarous. This scene reminded me of the Jacksonian view of foreign policy, which is that America abides by the rules, but if America is attacked first, then America will do anything to ensure total destruction of the enemy, and what ever way America deems fit is justified because America was attacked first. The end justifies the means. I think the director of the movie feels that since Benjamin was attacked first, that represents ""America"" being attacked first and all rules are off the table, and so therefore the movie is concluding that it is morally okay that Benjamin brutally hacked the guy to pieces over and over with an ax.After rescuing Gabriel, Benjamin's young son is upset that he killed British soldiers with his father. I feel that Benjamin's response drew another parallel to how America conducts its foreign policy. Benjamin tells his son that he did what he had to do; there was no wrong in it because they were wronged by the British. If we compare that statement to America's war policies, it seems pretty similar. America feels it has a right to do whatever it takes to win as long as America feels it is on the morally right side of dishing out justice. Benjamin obviously felt that he dished out justice that day. The ends justify the means to America and to Benjamin. His son responds that he is ""glad"" that he killed those British. Again the Director uses children to obtain disapproval against the British. In the next scene after this one, his wife's sister tells him that he has ""done nothing for which you should be ashamed."" Benjamin responds to his wife's sister by saying, ""I've done nothing...and for that I am ashamed."" This is a further outlook on America's foreign policy that America doesn't feel shame for killing any amount of people as long as America was wronged first.The final battle of the movie takes place in Yorktown in the year 1781. The French are seen coming into the harbor to support the Americans. The movie wonders what took the French so long. The French are portrayed as the ""long lost friends who had finally arrived"" with their naval support. The battles in the movie are shown as being fought with colonial soldiers independent from the aide of any foreign soldiers. It's never mentioned that some of the war supplies came from French aide. Only a single French General is shown at the end of the movie in the last battle at Yorktown. The last battle was portrayed as an easy victory by the colonists. The French are portrayed as chickens who just stayed out in the water safely on their ships while the Americans did the brutal fighting.The movie also never discussed the foreign policy side of the story Benjamin Franklin went through over in France in order to secure French aide for the revolution's battles at places like Yorktown and the rest of the revolution. Two treaties with France were signed in 1778, one economic and one military treaty. Benjamin Franklin was over seas begging the French for military aid, and finally was able to convince the French to support our revolution after the battle of Saratoga in 1777. The French gave the revolution military and navy support, money, and weapons, so France in this movie is never given enough credit for their help in the revolution. The director and writers of this movie obviously felt that America is exceptional, and they obviously have a distorted view of American foreign policy. But I did enjoy watching the movie. I love watching biased movies.Written by Steven D.

Movies are entertainment and usually I don't care when I movie gets some things wrong, but I guess I care when the movie is about the most important event in American history. It's mostly just small details that Roland Emmerich completly screws up but the fact that he allowed the line about a free country in the final cut amazes me. No one talked like that, and when they do this kind of stuff it ruins a movie that could have given Gladiator a run for its money a the 2000 Acamedy Awards.In this emotionally charged movie-Mel Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a reluctant hero who is swept into the American Revolution when the war comes to his front porch. When the war does reach Benjamin Martin's home and family he decides to take up arms against England.Benjamin Martin was a hero of the French and Indian conflict, Martin had renounced fighting forever to raise his family in peace (sounds like Braveheart doesn't it). When the British do arrive at his South Carolina home and endanger the things that he holds closest, and his son joins the American army, Martin finally does decide to go to war, leading a militia into battle against an overwhelming English army. Martin eventually finds out that the only way to protect his family is to fight for America's freedom.The Patriot will make you proud to be an American. It is also like Braveheart set in a different time. I don't know if the militia really fought like that but who really cares? The Patriot is a really entertaining movie and that's what counts. Sure the Americans look like warm-hearted heroes and the British look like cold-hearted pagans, but in a way that's sort of the way it was during the Revolution.

Don't be misled by the fact that it was directed by Roland Emmerich, the director of Stargate and Independence Day. By the way, Stargate is under rated also-an excellent sci-fi flick light years better than the Phanthom Menace. The acting in The Patriot is excellent. Mel Gibson, similar the his turn in Braveheart, is a reluctant warrior who is forced by extreme circumstances to fight and fight brutally. Battle scenes are vivid, bloody and convincing. Benjimin Martin, Gibson's character, warns his friends what will happen when his part of the country (a beautifully photographed South Carolina or country standing in for it)gets involved in a war. Gibson's family are warm, humorous,  Caleb Deschnagel's cinematography is burnished and the southern landscapes are fabulous to behold. Scene after scene are well-balanced and never boring. Emmerich has directed a major film on the subject of the American Revolution. There have been precious few in the film catalog that are not badly made. The Patriot shows a good picture of what it must have been like to live and fight in the eighteen century. It is a bold, exciting, thrilling movie. Forget all the negative critic reviews and see it for yourself and buy it. It is a wonderfully spun tale of freedom, war, revenge, love and family, and redemption.

Unlike Master & Commander, the dialog channel is good and is not drowned out by sound effects.The BD transfer is bright and sharp, so background elements have far more detail. The BD version is a revolution in clarity.  The texture of clothing, woods, equipment, and fields of soldiers in battle formation are rendered well and appear more real than CGI cartoons.  By now, BD veterans are used to the ultra detail shown on actors faces: down to EACH stubble on faces, and pores on their skin.  Unlike Troy, its clear many of the props and sets appear life like and made of 'real stuff' versus stucco or papier mache.  Also, actor's makeup is less obvious if not invisible, compared to other DVD to BD transfers.

Whoever thought that lining up in a big mass in front of a group of musket-wielding automatons was a good idea, is a military leader without a hint of imagination.  Through the ardent desire to form a country free from oppression, a country is born, and its first heroesSTORY:  Col. Benjamin Martin (Gibson) wishes to stay out of war and seek peace.  With a recently deceased wife he counters the growing surge to fight the Brits with this brilliantly prophetic line about having one's own government, ""Why should I trade one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away? An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king can.""PATRIOTISM:  When his son Gabrielle (Ledger) enlists without his permission, Benjamin is heart-fallen and worried.  With just about everyone, however, enlisting is looked upon as brave, just, and patriotic.  As the wars rage in his own crops and on his land, his young family is unwillingly embroiled in a country's birth.  When his despotic middle child foolishly rushes into a gun-fight without a gun, Benjamin decides it's about time to unleash the fury within (the defense of one's country is closely tied to the security of a man's family).FAVORITE BATTLE(S): In the most memorable scene of the movie, Benjamin takes his two youngest sons - one may have still been carrying a pacifier - into the woods to hunt some Brits who had previously imprisoned Gabrielle and displayed their poor dental hygiene.  After setting up a rudimentary ambush and supplying the kids with a few words of wisdom, Benjamin almost single-handedly destroys a platoon of red-coats with a couple of muskets, a knife, an Indian axe, and the rage of a father who just saw his son get the business end of a musket.  Benjamin Martin really was some sort of combination of a ghost, a ninja, and great Indian MME warrior in this one.FAVORITE LINE:  Aim small, miss small.THE MESSAGE:  Taxes suck, without representation they suck worse, and there was no way England could control the willpower of America's people.",5,"Aim small, miss small",1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,2207,"['WAR', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'desperately', 'important', 'cause', 'freedom', 'independence', 'brutally', 'ignorant', 'fighting', 'techniques', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'lining', 'up', 'big', 'mass', 'front', 'group', 'musket-wielding', 'automatons', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'military', 'leader', 'hint', 'imagination', 'ardent', 'desire', 'form', 'country', 'free', 'oppression', 'country', 'born', 'first', 'heroesSTORY', 'Col.', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'Gibson', 'stay', 'war', 'seek', 'peace', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'growing', 'surge', 'fight', 'Brits', 'brilliantly', 'prophetic', 'line', 'having', 'one', 'own', 'government', 'Why', 'should', 'trade', 'one', 'tyrant', 'three', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away', 'three', 'thousand', 'tyrants', 'one', 'mile', 'away', 'elected', 'legislature', 'can', 'trample', 'man', 'rights', 'as', 'easily', 'king', 'can', 'PATRIOTISM', 'When', 'son', 'Gabrielle', 'Ledger', 'permission', 'Benjamin', 'heart-fallen', 'worried', 'just', 'everyone', 'however', 'enlisting', 'looked', 'as', 'brave', 'just', 'patriotic', 'wars', 'rage', 'own', 'crops', 'land', 'young', 'family', 'unwillingly', 'embroiled', 'country', 'birth', 'When', 'despotic', 'middle', 'child', 'foolishly', 'rushes', 'gun-fight', 'gun', 'Benjamin', 'time', 'unleash', 'fury', 'defense', 'one', 'country', 'closely', 'tied', 'security', 'man', 'family', 'BATTLE', 'S', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'Benjamin', 'two', 'youngest', 'sons', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'carrying', 'pacifier', 'woods', 'hunt', 'Brits', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'imprisoned', 'Gabrielle', 'displayed', 'poor', 'dental', 'hygiene', 'setting', 'up', 'rudimentary', 'ambush', 'supplying', 'kids', 'few', 'words', 'wisdom', 'Benjamin', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'platoon', 'red-coats', 'couple', 'muskets', 'knife', 'Indian', 'axe', 'rage', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'saw', 'son', 'get', 'business', 'end', 'musket', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'really', 'was', 'sort', 'combination', 'ghost', 'ninja', 'great', 'Indian', 'MME', 'warrior', 'one.FAVORITE', 'LINE', 'Aim', 'small', 'miss', 'small.THE', 'MESSAGE', 'Taxes', 'suck', 'representation', 'suck', 'worse', 'was', 'way', 'England', 'could', 'control', 'willpower', 'America', 'people']",N/A

556984,ATLUWL6MV3YBY,B00004XPPG,J. C. Bailey,"[0, 0]","The key critical question to ask about ""The Patriot"" is this: Were there no American-born actors rugged or handsome enough to take lead role in a film about the defining moment in US nationhood? It is not even as if Gibson is a particularly flexible actor: He spends most of the film with the facial expression of a man suffering from an impacted gallstone, but when he really has to convey grief and anger it is unconvincing.The film is also littered with anachronisms and straight historical inaccuracies. Most of these are minor, however. The only moment that really jars is right at the end of the film (I'm not giving any of the plot away) where we are presented with a patronising and anachronistic picture of racial harmony - as though the worst years of oppression for African-Americans were behind them (when in fact the tragic worst still lay in the future).That final, hopeful image is almost certainly well-intended. Less justifiable, and perhaps more damaging, is the way this film perpetuates the myth that the British military leaders all were corrupt, incompetent or both. That some of them were a disgrace to humanity and/or their profession is unquestionable, but to tar them all with the same brush is to belittle the astonishing achievement of the state militias and ultimately the Continental Army in wearing down a military command of greatly superior fire-power and experience. This was part of the magic of the Revolutionary War - what kind of historical revisionism needs to cheapen the victory by making it look easy in either military or moral terms?Finally, having got these quibbles out of the way, I can say that ""The Patriot"" spins a believable and fairly moving story about resolve and heroism with some brilliant action scenes. The photography is outstanding and the pace is well-judged from start to finish (essential for such a long film). It's a touch gruesome in places, but strongly recommended.

It is a step above most brainless action movies.The plot, while based on  actual events and people, has been greatly twisted and warped for a  Hollywood story. I personally think the true stories of the Revolutionary  war are much more interesting. There was a big media frenzy in England over  the character of Mel Gibson's main adversary. Saying the cruel behaviour  did not take place. Towards the end some of the plot twists seem more than  a bit hokey. Example, the love interest between Mel and the character of  his departed wife's sister.The movie presents first-rate production  values. The action is easy to follow even during the confusing and muddles  battles of the Revolutionary War.The acting is what you would expect in  a big budget movie. The supporting cast provided the best in terms of  it.Weighing in at close to 3 hours, the movie does not slow down at all.

556987,A1W16LV46EQQUQ,B00004XPPG,Jean-Francois Virey,"[8, 12]","...I somehow respected him for his choice of models. Since *Stargate*, Emmerich has been successfully directing big-budget Hollywood blockbusters like *Independence Day* or *Godzilla*, all  of them heroic, benevolent and pro-American- three qualities I look for in movies, even if the America I admire has not survived the twentieth century.*The Patriot* gives the Revolutionary War the Emmerich treatment: it's a big, exciting, melodramatic, feel-good movie with wonderful production values and splendid widescreen cinematography. Most of all, it is not a movie that spits on the American flag, but respectfully patches it and trimphantly waves it - a thorouhgly enjoyable experience for someone like me, who live in France, a country where anti-Americanism is a sine qua non among academics and teenage rebels.Of course, the movie can be criticized for its historical inaccuracies: from the more technical (explosive projectiles had not yet been invented) to the more blatant (America was invaded by British troops, not Nazis). In fact, the filmmakers deviated so much from their historical sources that they preferred to give their characters fancy names that are often variations on the original ones (imagine a Civil War epic featuring George Strongarm Custard and Brickwall Johnson).The good guy, Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin, is said to be a composite of Francis Marion, the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;; Thomas Sumter (who actually had his house burned by Tarleton); Andrew Pickens and Daniel Morgan (who gave the order to shoot twice and then retreat at the real battle of Cowpens.) The bad guy, William Tavington, is a more anachronistic and imaginative mixture of Banastre Tarleton and the S.S. officer who gave the order to burn the whole population of Oradour, France in the town church in 1944. As for the final battle, which is not named, it is supposed to be a combination of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse.The greatest critic of the movie's historical reliability is not an historian, however, but film director Spike Lee. Among other things, he has berated the movie because it allegedly &quot;dodged around, skirted about or completely ignored slavery&quot; (apparently, either he did not realize that the film could not logically do all three, or he was not able to make up his mind as to what it actually did.) Actually, the movie does mention slavery, as one of the characters is one of the several thousand blacks who were set free by the enlistment process (see for instance Murray Rothbard's *Conceived in Liberty*, volume IV, Chapter 78). Just because Martin's black workers are not slaves does not mean the movie ignores slavery. After all, not all blacks were slaves in Colonial America: there is even one documented case of a black man who owned white slaves.A Newsweek reviewer also wrote: &quot;If the South Carolina of 1778 looked like this *House and Garden* version - gentrified, spick and span, wealthy - you'd wonder why anyone would feel the need to fight a revolution.&quot; This confirms my opinion that today's journalists derive their historical notions mostly from Karl Marx and other communist propaganda, and only have a vague idea of who Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and James Madison were.I personally do not care if the film is not historically truthful. Noone expects historical accuracy from a Hollywood movie these days, and there are many resources on the Internet that will help you sort the fact from the fiction, not to mention excellent books. What I hope is that *The Patriot* will both give a glimpse of greatness to its viewers and stimulate their interest in the War of Independence. There are indeed signs of the latter, as I read a South Carolina historical guide report that thanks to the movie, &quot;People say to me on a daily basis, 'I had no idea the American Revolution was fought in the South.'&quot;If you are in the mood for more rousing Revolutionary adventures, I highly recommend Kenneth Roberts' historical fiction, which is just as exciting as *The Patriot*, in addition to being utterly reliable -sometimes even more so than historical non-fiction. *Arundel* deals with Benedict Arnold's epic March to Quebec in 1775; *Rabble in Arms* chronicles the campaign of the Army of the North in 1775-7; *Oliver Wiswell* brilliantly presents the War from the Loyalist point of view, taking you to Boston, New York, Virginia and Carolina; and finally *The Battle of Cowpens* is a short booklet which presents one of the two battles that inspired the climactic scene of *The Patriot*.(I am also told that Thomas Fleming, the author of *Liberty!*, has written excellent novels on the Revolutionary War; and that John Buchanan has a good book on the Revolutionary War in the South entitled *The Road to Guilford Courthouse*)",4,An exciting historical

Michael Click,"[12, 24]","Imagine Jim Anderson, the paternal title character from TV's &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, suddenly revealing his inner Rambo ...  and single-handedly inspiring America to win the decisive battle  that spells the eventual end of the Revolutionary War.  Sound wretched?  ludicrous?  stupid?  Of course!  And yet that is the general premise of &quot;The Patriot&quot;.Needless to say, no actor could imbue such a story with enough believability to save it from putrescence.  Certainly, Mel Gibson gives it a good try, but he has nothing to work with. His performance hits basically three notes throughout: wise patriarch; witty omnipotent; and bloodthirsty warrior.  It wears thin after the first half hour, and is excruciatingly stale by the time the movie limps to its conclusion over two hours later.  Along the way, there is some welcome distraction from Heath Ledger as Mel's oldest son; Jason Isaacs as a sadistic redcoat; and Joely Richardson as the widowed Mel's buxom sister-in-law (listen to how much this actress sounds like her real-life mother, Vanessa Redgrave!).  There are also some eye-popping costumes, phenomenal set decorations, and gorgeous cinematography to divert attention from the inanities of the script, but eventually, these attributes also wear thin.Among the other conceits of the script:  that a father could romance his children's aunt without the children being in the least uncomfortable ... that racism in America was less insidious a problem during the Revolutionary War than it would be during the following two centuries ... that in the heat of an epic,  brutal battle two individuals could find each other and engage  in a little &quot;mano a mano&quot; without interruption ... etc, ad nauseum.The DVD transfer looks and sounds great, and there are some  decent extras ... but this is definitely one you should rent before you buy.  Or better yet, skip it all together and watch John Ford's 1939 Revolutionary War classic &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; instead.

556997,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B00004XPPG,jmpg,"[1, 3]","I was surprised that this was a film by Roland Emmerich, the same guy who directed Stargate, ID4, and (ugh) Godzilla. He finally did something right. Unlike his previous films, this one actually has some meaning to it. The Patriot is about a man whose faith and beliefs about war intersects with what is more important: his family, but also takes us down the road in American history. It's not a deep-in-depth historical masterpiece, but it still gives you a good idea of what went on, and it's also a good 2 1/2 hours of your time.Headed by Mel Gibson, some people will think that The Patriot is Braveheart resurrected. Well, at some points it is, but the movie is not. Anyways, outstanding performances are evident throughout. Gibson is the real thing, both on and off the battlefield. Jason Isaacs probably gives the highlight performance of the movie, playing the kind of character you just want to chuck something at. We get a good sense that the characters live in spacious worlds and not just know only each another. The movie has an obsessed balance of grittiness and comedy, which worked great. Still, some questionable things were here and there: for this movie, the title &quot;The Patriot&quot; didn't seem to work. Also, is this a story of a man who fought for a cause in the Revolution, or is it about the Revolution itself? Who knows, but what counts is that we got a good idea of both.The Patriot is Emmerich done right, but his filmmaking formula remains. It's not bad thing, but for those who want a historical background from this movie, I'm afraid you'll have to look somewhere else. It has the idea, but it doesn't give too much. The Patriot is well worth the money, but it is basically a big summer movie painted over with the American Revolution. It supplies many laughs, tears, and triumph, but not so much on history. You could take this story on a set that doesn't have to be about the Revolution and still have the same concept. You have a perfect summer movie anyways right?

557003,A1WI9BLVSUCLVZ,B00004XPPG,John Elsegood,"[2, 4]","The American Revolution has always fascinated me and &quot;The Patriot&quot; is a spectacular drama on the big screen. If you are looking for strict historical accuracy then this film will disappoint you. However I concur with Tom Reynolds that movies with a historical theme do indeed inspire people to refer to other sources to gain further information. My love of history came about by reading historical novels as a child and watching Disney productions like the Swamp Fox, (starring Leslie Nielsen), about Francis Marion the legendary Carolinian guerilla leader in the Revolutionary War. In fact the central character in this movie, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), known as &quot;The Ghost,&quot; is loosely based on Marion-we even see an ambush on redcoats in the swamps of South Carolina. The British cad, Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs),is also rather loosely based on Col.Banastre Tarleton, commander of the Green Dragoons, whom some historians believe has been demonised unfairly.Certainly Tavington's display in herding  villagers, including women and children, into their local church and then setting fire to the building is more akin to a Nazi-style action than something from the Revolutionary War, which is not to deny that atrocities occured-as they do in all wars.  Indeed, I think the challenge for American movie-makers is to be a little less patriotic in their future renditions of this important conflict between colonists and mother country. It has to be remembered there were many fine Americans who were loyalists and many of them were also treated disgracefully  before,during and after the great conflict of 1775-83. I would really like to see a future Revolutionary film produced like the Civil War's &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; which was far more balanced in the treatment given to the opposing sides in another, later, great conflict on American soil. Having said that, &quot;The Patriot&quot; is a good action-packed adventure with some great photography. If it manages to interest people to further look at an important period in America's history then perhaps we should not complain too much about historical inaccuracies, particularly when US film producers use a West Aussie, Heath Ledger, for a major part, whilst the main actor, Mel Gibson,has spent so much of his life in Australia that we claim him as one of our own!",4,A loyally patriotic movie,970963200,"10 8, 2000",2000,2359,"['American', 'Revolution', 'always', 'fascinated', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'spectacular', 'drama', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'looking', 'strict', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'disappoint', 'However', 'concur', 'Tom', 'Reynolds', 'movies', 'historical', 'theme', 'do', 'indeed', 'inspire', 'people', 'refer', 'other', 'sources', 'gain', 'further', 'information', 'love', 'history', 'came', 'about', 'reading', 'historical', 'novels', 'child', 'watching', 'Disney', 'productions', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'starring', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'about', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'legendary', 'Carolinian', 'guerilla', 'leader', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'fact', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'known', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'quot', 'loosely', 'based', 'Marion-we', 'even', 'see', 'ambush', 'redcoats', 'swamps', 'South', 'Carolina', 'British', 'cad', 'Colonel', 'William', 'Tavington', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'also', 'rather', 'loosely', 'based', 'Col.Banastre', 'Tarleton', 'commander', 'Green', 'Dragoons', 'whom', 'historians', 'believe', 'been', 'demonised', 'unfairly.Certainly', 'Tavington', 'display', 'herding', 'villagers', 'including', 'women', 'children', 'local', 'church', 'then', 'setting', 'fire', 'building', 'more', 'akin', 'Nazi-style', 'action', 'something', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'not', 'deny', 'atrocities', 'occured-as', 'do', 'wars', 'Indeed', 'think', 'challenge', 'American', 'movie-makers', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'patriotic', 'future', 'renditions', 'important', 'conflict', 'colonists', 'mother', 'country', 'be', 'remembered', 'were', 'many', 'fine', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'loyalists', 'many', 'were', 'also', 'treated', 'disgracefully', 'before', 'great', 'conflict', '1775-83', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'future', 'Revolutionary', 'film', 'produced', 'Civil', 'War', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'balanced', 'treatment', 'given', 'opposing', 'sides', 'later', 'great', 'conflict', 'American', 'soil', 'Having', 'said', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'good', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'great', 'photography', 'interest', 'people', 'further', 'look', 'important', 'period', 'America', 'history', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'not', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'particularly', 'when', 'US', 'film', 'producers', 'use', 'West', 'Aussie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'major', 'part', 'whilst', 'main', 'actor', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'Australia', 'claim', 'one', 'own']",N/A
557004,A332MW6OA1LYDF,B00004XPPG,John Noodles,"[3, 5]","The single thing about this movie that has gotten the most press, it seems, it the politically incorrect scene in which Gibson's character gives  his sons muskets and has them assist him in the ambush and killing of  British soldiers who have just murdered one of his sons and arrested  another.  Given the evilness of the British soldiers, this is the only  reasonable thing to do...but in this age of post-Columbine hysteria, what  can we expect?There are other problems with this movie, real problems,  not ideological ones.  For one thing, this movie is an epic, or wants to  be, but the characters don't really contain the sort of moral ambiguity  that real people embody, and that makes a movie *about* people--whatever  the historical setting--truly compelling.  In &quot;The Patriot,&quot; we  get some token wavering of resolve from the miltia soldiers, but the  British are portrayed as cartoonishly evil.  It doesn't bother me that the  film may not be historically accurate (witness all the happy slaves, or,  worse, Gibson's &quot;free men&quot;!)--after all, this is entertainment;  it doesn't pretend to be a documentary.  The director &amp; screenwriter  take too many easy outs, though.  The British are just *too* evil.  Which  isn't to say the movie doesn't have its moments; it does. When Gibson  confronts Corwallis face-to-face, and outwits him...this is a nice scene,  but generally the British are portrayed as being as stupid as they are  evil.  Certainly, narrative tension requires an antagonist and a  protagonist, but outside of supernatural horror stories, the good-evil  thing can be overdone.It may sound as though I didn't enjoy the movie.  I did.  If you go into it with too discriminating an expectation, though,  you are likely to be disappointed.  If you want little more than a  good-guys-andbad-guys movie, done on a grand scale, you'll probably love  this.

However, I would like to list in detail the aspects of this movie that WERE done correctly, either theatrically or historically.>1.) The idea of going to war with England for independence was hardly a unanimous feeling throughout the Colonies. Just as there are people who live within English territory today who feel loyalty to the Crown (Rangers fans in Glasgow, for instance), so were there loyalists (Tories) within the colonies who happily considered themselves to be British. Such voices aren't often heard in other film productions depicting this subject; in that aspect ""The Patriot"" was spot-on in its depiction of Colonial politics.>2.) Contrary to many negative (read: British) reviews of this movie, the British army in general and their officers specifically are not portrayed as murderous Visigoths. It is true that the ""lead villain"" role is seen as exceptionally loathsome in his conduct, but I failed to see his conduct as being condoned by other officers within his chain of command; indeed, there are many times when his actions are equally questioned (and scorned) by his own subordinate and superior officers. I feel that the director was trying to personify the horrors and depravities of war (surely found in any number of the multitudes of men who have commanded troops since the dawn of warfare) within the single, easily identifiable form of one man (Colonel Tavington; the fact that the actor portraying Colonel Tavington did such a fantastic job with the character and by doing so caused the viewer to paint the British with a rather broad brush in forming such a negative opinion is more of a positive reflection on the actor's work rather than the result of the film's director attempting to show the British as 18th-Century nazis). The same goes for Mel Gibson's heroic character Benjamin Martin; no one man did as much to much to win any war (with the possible exception of Achilles in Homer's ""Iliad"") as Gibson's did in this movie...but in the same sense that the dark side of man must be personified in one character, so must the heroic and uplifting aspects of good.>3.) Like ""Braveheart"", the battlefield scenes (and the obligatory ""M*A*S*H""-inspired ""post-battle triage"" scenes) in this movie are brutally realistic and not for the faint-of-heart. Besides the battle scenes themselves, which are memorable, the set designs and costumes are fantastic...I believe, based on my own historical studies, that this movie did accurately present the aspects of life within Coastal Colonial Carolina in the late 18th Century.>4.) Slavery is, of course, the most notorious memory that remains of America's first two centuries. It should be noted, however, that the institution of slavery was not widespread among the general population. Only those wealthy enough to own the amount of land necessary to require a salve labor force could afford the slaves by which the land could be worked; landowners of lesser means (such as Benjamin Martin) would acquire his labor force the old fashioned (and far more enjoyable) way of excessive procreation.>In summary, this movie definitely isn't for everyone. Like the ""Miracle On Ice"" story of the 1980 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament, it probably helps to be an American to gain full enjoyment of ""The Patriot"". There are moments within the movie that are legitimately touching and heartfelt; and there are aspects of this movie which some will simply find too intolerable to allow for any enjoyment. My opinion is that is a Hollywood production that is (somewhat) factually flawed, but a very entertaining movie otherwise. If you're an American and/or a Mel Gibson fan, you're going to really enjoy this. For those from ""the other side of the pond"" who hold a grudge even after all this time, I daresay this won't quite be your cup of tea.",4,Mounting a,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,4213,"['true', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'anyone', 'apparently', 'who', 'English', 'nationality', 'wonder', 'what', 'treatment', 'gave', 'Gandhi', 'when', 'was', 'released', '>', 'will', 'admit', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'pass', 'history', 'exam', 'based', 'wholly', 'content', 'Patriot', 'however', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Braveheart', 'film', 'often', 'compared', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'list', 'detail', 'aspects', 'movie', 'WERE', 'done', 'correctly', 'theatrically', 'historically.', '>', '1', 'idea', 'going', 'war', 'England', 'independence', 'was', 'hardly', 'unanimous', 'feeling', 'Colonies', 'Just', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'English', 'territory', 'today', 'who', 'feel', 'loyalty', 'Crown', 'Rangers', 'fans', 'Glasgow', 'instance', 'so', 'were', 'loyalists', 'Tories', 'colonies', 'who', 'happily', 'considered', 'be', 'British', 'Such', 'voices', 'are', ""n't"", 'often', 'heard', 'other', 'film', 'productions', 'depicting', 'subject', 'aspect', 'Patriot', 'was', 'spot-on', 'depiction', 'Colonial', 'politics.', '>', '2', 'Contrary', 'many', 'negative', 'read', 'British', 'reviews', 'movie', 'British', 'army', 'general', 'officers', 'specifically', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'murderous', 'Visigoths', 'true', 'lead', 'villain', 'role', 'seen', 'exceptionally', 'loathsome', 'conduct', 'failed', 'see', 'conduct', 'being', 'condoned', 'other', 'officers', 'chain', 'command', 'indeed', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'actions', 'are', 'equally', 'questioned', 'scorned', 'own', 'subordinate', 'superior', 'officers', 'feel', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'personify', 'horrors', 'depravities', 'war', 'surely', 'found', 'number', 'multitudes', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'commanded', 'troops', 'dawn', 'warfare', 'single', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'form', 'one', 'man', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'fact', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'character', 'doing', 'so', 'caused', 'viewer', 'paint', 'British', 'rather', 'broad', 'brush', 'forming', 'such', 'negative', 'opinion', 'more', 'positive', 'reflection', 'actor', 'work', 'rather', 'result', 'film', 'director', 'attempting', 'show', 'British', '18th-Century', 'nazis', 'same', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'heroic', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'one', 'man', 'did', 'as', 'much', 'much', 'win', 'war', 'possible', 'exception', 'Achilles', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'Gibson', 'did', 'movie', 'same', 'sense', 'dark', 'side', 'man', 'must', 'be', 'personified', 'one', 'character', 'so', 'must', 'heroic', 'uplifting', 'aspects', 'good.', '3', 'Braveheart', 'battlefield', 'scenes', 'obligatory', 'M*A*S*H', '-inspired', 'post-battle', 'triage', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'not', 'faint-of-heart', 'battle', 'are', 'memorable', 'set', 'designs', 'costumes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'believe', 'based', 'own', 'historical', 'studies', 'movie', 'did', 'accurately', 'present', 'aspects', 'life', 'Coastal', 'Colonial', 'Carolina', 'late', '18th', 'Century.', '>', '4', 'Slavery', 'course', 'most', 'notorious', 'memory', 'America', 'first', 'two', 'centuries', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'however', 'institution', 'slavery', 'was', 'not', 'widespread', 'general', 'population', 'Only', 'wealthy', 'enough', 'own', 'amount', 'land', 'necessary', 'require', 'salve', 'labor', 'force', 'could', 'afford', 'slaves', 'land', 'could', 'be', 'worked', 'landowners', 'lesser', 'means', 'such', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'would', 'acquire', 'labor', 'force', 'old', 'fashioned', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'excessive', 'procreation.', '>', 'summary', 'movie', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'Miracle', 'Ice', 'story', '1980', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'ice', 'hockey', 'tournament', 'probably', 'be', 'American', 'gain', 'full', 'enjoyment', 'Patriot', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'legitimately', 'touching', 'heartfelt', 'are', 'aspects', 'movie', 'will', 'simply', 'find', 'too', 'intolerable', 'allow', 'enjoyment', 'opinion', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'somewhat', 'factually', 'flawed', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'American', 'and/or', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fan', ""'re"", 'going', 'really', 'enjoy', 'other', 'side', 'pond', 'who', 'hold', 'grudge', 'even', 'time', 'daresay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quite', 'be', 'cup', 'tea']",N/A

Though The Patriot didn't fullfill those expectations, I was not disappointed; in fact, I loved it.Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a retired soldier who became a hero in the battle with the French. After having 6 children and loosing a wife, he decides that war is not in his future anymore. His sons have different asperations. Martin and his eldest son, I believe his name was Joseph, go to the seat of South Carolina for a meeting. While there, Martin confesses his distaste of war to the populace to the chagrin of his compatriots. Though he did not vote on the passage of the levy, it nonetheless passes and his son, against Martin's wishes, joined the Continental Army. After some months of battle, his son returns home to heal. Martin and his helpers, not his slaves, decide to lend medical attention to any soldier, British or otherwise. Unfortunately, this merciful act leads to tragedy. A British regimen comes to Martin's home and initially, they thank him for caring for &quot;his majesty's soldiers&quot;. Soon afterwards, a British commander arrives and orders the rebel soldiers killed and the messenger of the military mail, Martin's son, to be hanged. Martin stood dumb-founded as his eldest son is being taken away to his destiny. But his second eldest had no such notion to stand and see his brother killed. He runs to his brother, pushes the soldier taking him away, and is then shot by the British commander. After the soldiers depart, Martin goes into his house (which is now on fire at the order of the commander) and gets his indian tomahawk and guns. He takes his last 2 sons to the forest where the soldiers with his son are and unleash a vicious attack upon the British soldiers. Martin is now in the war but he decides that a traditional war would not win them freedom. He and Joseph recruit regulars and form a militia which wreaked more havoc upon the British than the Continental Army ever did.

This one, The Patriot, surpasses Braveheart in many ways.  It is war time and Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, who is a single father of seven children.  Luckily for him, Benjamin only has one son fighting in the war, Gabriel (Heath Ledger).  Benjamin, himself, refuses to fight this battle due to his devotion to his children and his past experiences that have made him famous throughout the land.  But when Colonel Harry Burwell of the Continental Army murders his middle son, Benjamin is pulled into the war fighting with one goal: to find and kill the man who murdered his son.  Commanding a fleet of men using 'un-gentlemanly' tactics, he turns the fate of the war around.  With so much on the line and his oldest son fighting alongside him, Benjamin will fight the battle of his lifetime, not for country but for vengence.This is a must-see for any war movie fan, being both accurate and very well-scripted.  The one thing that breaks this movie out of the war mold, though, is its incredible heart.

A little bit of a mix, there. It actually turns out that this is a far below average movie, that fails with every turn, and The Patriot's basic moral is that Hollywood is completely finished with making good war-hero films.Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a South Carolina planter who is still haunted by his notoriously brutal past as a soldier in the French and Indian War. When the American Revolution comes, he chooses not to fight for the Continental Army because he wants to protect his family. But when the British Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) threatens their welfare and kills one of his sons, he chooses to enlist. Martin becomes the leader of a makeshift militia, which consists of peasants, slaves, a minister, and assorted other irregulars. During the war Martin and his men discover that they will pay a steep personal price for their rebellion. But thanks to their courage and bravery, they are also destined to pay a pivotal role in turning the tide against the Redcoats.The Patriot is an over-long, boring and pointless picture that delivers only in a couple of scenes. The cinematography is quite stunning, but some some un-purposely over-blown performances (especially from Jason Isaacs), messy direction and a premise that could've been written better by monkies don't help The Patriot be the Oscar-worthy film it might've been if the script and direction had been taken into different hands.Disappointing and rarely interesting, The Patriot is a film that makes me proud not to be an American war hero like the characters in this film.",2,Full of yawns,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,1689,"['PatriotScore', '49/100What', 'exactly', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Patriot', 'director', 'Godzilla', 'stars', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'little', 'bit', 'mix', 'actually', 'out', 'far', 'below', 'average', 'movie', 'turn', 'Patriot', 'basic', 'moral', 'Hollywood', 'completely', 'finished', 'making', 'good', 'war-hero', 'films.Benjamin', 'Martin', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'South', 'Carolina', 'planter', 'who', 'still', 'haunted', 'notoriously', 'brutal', 'past', 'soldier', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'When', 'American', 'Revolution', 'not', 'fight', 'Continental', 'Army', 'protect', 'family', 'when', 'British', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'welfare', 'one', 'sons', 'enlist', 'Martin', 'leader', 'makeshift', 'militia', 'peasants', 'slaves', 'minister', 'assorted', 'other', 'irregulars', 'war', 'Martin', 'men', 'discover', 'will', 'pay', 'steep', 'personal', 'price', 'rebellion', 'thanks', 'courage', 'bravery', 'are', 'also', 'destined', 'pay', 'pivotal', 'role', 'turning', 'tide', 'Redcoats.The', 'Patriot', 'over-long', 'boring', 'pointless', 'picture', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'stunning', 'un-purposely', 'over-blown', 'performances', 'especially', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'messy', 'direction', 'premise', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'written', 'better', 'monkies', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'Patriot', 'be', 'Oscar-worthy', 'film', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'script', 'direction', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'different', 'hands.Disappointing', 'rarely', 'interesting', 'Patriot', 'film', 'proud', 'not', 'be', 'American', 'war', 'hero', 'characters', 'film']",N/A

Indeed, that scene is the centerpiece and showpiece of an otherwise conventional movie that's short on history, short on dilemmas, short on surprise, but long on derivative brutality.Not that I'm surprised by the result.  Emmerich is, after all, the guy who directed  *Independence Day*, a movie that is very nearly the ultimate mindless  &quot;summer blockbuster&quot;.  Along with Emmerich's direction comes a screenplay by the guy  (forgot the name)  who penned  *Saving Private Ryan*, which, if you'll recall, was dependent on the kinetic direction of Spielberg much much more than on the sagging script  (does anyone remember what happens in the middle of that movie?).  Throw in Mel Gibson, let him reprise his  *Braveheart*  role in trousers instead of kilts, and you get what suspiciously looks like a cynical strategy to make money rather than a good movie.  The studio heads seem to have attempted to bring together a group of elements from previous  &quot;successes&quot;  with the idea of building an Oscar-friendly movie that might just earn $100 million at the box.  Well, they might not get any Oscars  (except for F/X, natch), but they certainly succeeded in raking it in.  They succeeded in little else.[...] Notice how the most engaging character in the film is the FRENCH nobleman/mercenary.

Here the sheer stupidity of warfare is shown,  as well as the reason for why regulars were considered more reliable the  militia (better discipline). All the little details are in place, the red  coats, the &quot;sleeping bag&quot; for the soon to be married as well as  references to various historical persons. The action is usually well  co-ordinated, in particular the scene were they describe by pictures rather  then words why Gibsons character is a man people used to fear. However his  berserk rage cools quickly and he once again becomes the calculating  guerrilla officer.The actors fill their parts, Gibson is greying but  still strong and honest, the son is handsome, and his love chaste and the  rest (of the American part of the cast) have endearing features, even those  that are somewhat unwashed.So far the film comes together well, the  first quarter or so is entertaining, then it falls apart. It really does  not matter if you have all the details correct when the big picture is  completely out of focus. That the only person in South Caroline who seems  to own a slave is described as a despicable exeption to the norm, as well  as the prejudice filled soldier who in the end comes to terms with his  black brother in arms, comes across as somewhat false. There would be  another war before black rights within the US were begun to be addressed  and a hundred years from that conflict there were forms of segregation in  many American states that had been outlawed in Britain before the start of  the war for independence. The French aid (not only of a fleet, but also of  supplies and troops) is downplayed and the sole Frenchmen is there more for  comic relief then to be a hero. In all this rewriting of history (only a  few examples give here) the fact that the colonists are portrayed with many  very modern views and are nothing like the people I studied when I read  about the period is almost to small a detail to mention.This is a film  about a war that were the start of a on the whole very positive thing, the  United States, but the director seems afraid to say anything that might  appear damaging to the &quot;heroes&quot; of the era. Instead they have  created a fairytale story about a war fought on one side by heroes and on  the other by scum and idiots. There are entertaining parts but on the whole  it is only depressing. I could not help but think of ID4, especially the  president's speech (&quot;...today we celebrate our independence...&quot;). The  film is like that speech, only more the two hours long with only the  occasional break for action.

Most of the reviewers before me have done a fine (and sometimes not so fine) job doing that already. Instead, I will explain why I feel this is a very good movie and would make a worthwhile addition to your DVD library.When a movie is historically accurate (""Gods and Generals,"" for instance), it gets panned because of the lack of political correctness, or it's too slow, or overly long, etc. When it isn't historically accurate (""The Patriot""), it  still gets panned for not being historically accurate. You can't win!I found The Patriot to be an engulfing movie filled with suspense, excitement, humor, drama, and, dare I say it, enough historical accuracy for the viewer to get an understanding of the time and events in which this movie takes place.I guess what appeals to me most in this movie is the fact that they do not attempt to bring the late 20th century mores and morals (or lack of) into the 18th century, as too many of today's Hollywood flicks make it a point to do ...I had to laugh at the fact that these liberal do-gooders were so upset that there were children in ""The Patriot"" who actually were allowed to brandish a (gasp!) musket! C'mon people! This is supposed to be a movie representing life in the late 18th century Revolutionary War time. Kids with guns was as common and accepted as kids with skateboards today - more, in fact. These revisionist historians would prefer to 'Disney - fy' our history and remove any truths they deem politically incorrect.There are wonderful examples why this movie is slightly above many  others when it comes to the period in time it is attempting to revise. For example, the old custom of 'bundling,' where one would lie in the same bed as their sweetheart fully clothed and sometimes restrained as to ensure no funny business could happen, takes place in this movie, as does some of the archaic language from the time period, used in the dialogue (""take me in his stead!"").It's these sort of subtle historical gems that helps me to overlook the inaccuracies of the battle dress - not that I am happy about that inaccuracy at all. But, unless you get a truly passionately produced movie ...we sometimes have to, unfortunately, settle for a bit less. But less is not always bad.One day, I hope someone does the Revolutionary War right and produces/directs the ultimate movie about the birth of our great nation...But, until then, ""The Patriot"" and ""The Crossing"" will have to do.",4,A Worthwhile DVD,1048204800,"03 21, 2003",2003,2560,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'waste', 'time', 'retelling', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'what', 'Patriot', 'about', 'inaccuracies', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'sometimes', 'not', 'so', 'fine', 'job', 'doing', 'already', 'Instead', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'feel', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library.When', 'movie', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'instance', 'panned', 'lack', 'political', 'correctness', 'too', 'slow', 'overly', 'long', 'etc', 'When', ""n't"", 'historically', 'accurate', 'Patriot', 'still', 'panned', 'not', 'being', 'historically', 'accurate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'found', 'Patriot', 'be', 'engulfing', 'movie', 'filled', 'suspense', 'excitement', 'humor', 'drama', 'dare', 'say', 'enough', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'viewer', 'get', 'understanding', 'time', 'events', 'movie', 'place.I', 'guess', 'what', 'appeals', 'most', 'movie', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'attempt', 'bring', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'mores', 'morals', 'lack', '18th', 'century', 'too', 'many', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'flicks', 'make', 'point', 'do', 'had', 'laugh', 'fact', 'liberal', 'do-gooders', 'were', 'so', 'upset', 'were', 'children', 'Patriot', 'who', 'actually', 'were', 'allowed', 'brandish', 'gasp', 'musket', ""C'mon"", 'people', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'representing', 'life', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'time', 'Kids', 'guns', 'was', 'common', 'accepted', 'kids', 'skateboards', 'today', 'more', 'fact', 'revisionist', 'historians', 'would', 'prefer', ""'Disney"", 'fy', 'history', 'remove', 'truths', 'deem', 'politically', 'incorrect.There', 'are', 'wonderful', 'examples', 'why', 'movie', 'slightly', 'many', 'others', 'when', 'period', 'time', 'attempting', 'revise', 'example', 'old', 'custom', ""'bundling"", 'where', 'one', 'would', 'lie', 'same', 'bed', 'sweetheart', 'fully', 'clothed', 'sometimes', 'restrained', 'ensure', 'funny', 'business', 'could', 'happen', 'place', 'movie', 'archaic', 'language', 'time', 'period', 'used', 'dialogue', 'take', 'stead', '.It', 'sort', 'subtle', 'historical', 'gems', 'overlook', 'inaccuracies', 'battle', 'dress', 'not', 'am', 'happy', 'inaccuracy', 'get', 'truly', 'passionately', 'produced', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'have', 'unfortunately', 'settle', 'bit', 'less', 'less', 'not', 'always', 'bad.One', 'day', 'hope', 'someone', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'right', 'ultimate', 'movie', 'birth', 'great', 'nation', 'then', 'Patriot', 'Crossing', 'will', 'have', 'do']",N/A

Hollywood assumes they can make money off our patriotism by squeezing out a shoddy ""underdog America"" flick just before Independence Day.  On the surface The Patriot , directed by Roland Emmerich, was about fighting for your country and succeeding because the `lobsterbacks' are bad and we are good.  Aha, that is only superficial; underneath the surface, it is all about perpetuating the felled myth that moviegoers will pay the exorbitant and watch the subordinate.  The Patriot opens with a scene that inevitably becomes foreshadowing: widower Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson, star of critically acclaimed Braveheart, has just finished building a rocking chair. Being one of many exhausted attempts, his family waits with baited breath to see if this one will sustain his weight and not buckle.  The chair shattered like crystal chandelier.Mel Gibson's acting was his worst ever.  In Braveheart  he did a great job feeling the emotion that William Wallace may have felt, and he was soothingly natural for the part, but in The Patriot, he was as awkward as a duck-footed cat.  Not too be stood up, Heath Ledger acted more the worse.  There's something about reenacting historic events that puts actors in ""declamatory"" mode.  A declamatory, or demonstrative actor is one that plays off of a strong stereotype, rather than doing what the actual person would do, they act merely to portray a stereotype.  A good example of a declamatory actor is, well, Mel Gibson in Hamlet.  ""To be or not to be..."" (you get the idea)  The embarrassing special effects are another negative.  ure, I heard somebody scream in pain as a cannon ball seemingly shot into the audience, but the digitized backgrounds were hackneyed and the battle scenes seemed distant no matter how close the cameraman zoomed.  I am convinced the `special' effects were shot in the late 1700's.  Furthermore, I want to know where my $7.00 is going.  I might take my brother's suggestion and just watch the trailers from now on, two minutes of intrigue beats a 158minutes of coma inducing melodrama with a balled fist.Against his father's will, Gabriel Martin, played by Heath Ledger (if you're among the fifteen people who watched Ten Things I Hate About You, then you probably recognize him as the teenage Verona) decides to march off to war and defend the colonies against the red-coated Brits.  Benjamin Martin is himself a veteran of war and adamantly opposes his son Gabriel's enlistment, but like every parent of who ever lived, Benjamin learns that teenagers have iron skulls which cannot be penetrated by reason, experience, or even ""kryptonite.""  The war wages on, and after the assassination of his second eldest son, Benjamin Martin decides to rejoin ranks and fight alongside Gabriel.  The plot continues along epic lines, and is an interesting story once the ball begins to roll, but the poor dialogue and malnourished characters as well as underdeveloped emotion toward characters makes this movie more of a rental.The Patriot is not, however, the touchstone of cinematic ineptitude, currently that spot is reserved for Mission 2 Mars, but it does not seize the audience like Gladiator or Braveheart.  If you want an American catharsis, watch fireworks and listen to Neil Diamond's ""Coming to America,"" if you want comedy, watch Me, Myself &amp; Irene, and if you want action/suspense, watch The Perfect Storm, but do not  watch The Patriot.",1,"They Can Take Our Money, But They Cannot Take&#65533;Our Freedom!",985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,3540,"['FREEZE', 'Slowly', 'put', 'money', 'back', 'pockets', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'rash', 'watch', 'anything', 'not', 'Patriot', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'patriotism', 'squeezing', 'out', 'shoddy', 'underdog', 'America', 'flick', 'just', 'before', 'Independence', 'Day', 'surface', 'Patriot', 'directed', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'was', 'fighting', 'country', 'succeeding', 'lobsterbacks', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'good', 'Aha', 'only', 'superficial', 'surface', 'perpetuating', 'felled', 'myth', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'pay', 'exorbitant', 'watch', 'subordinate', 'Patriot', 'scene', 'inevitably', 'foreshadowing', 'widower', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'star', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Braveheart', 'just', 'finished', 'building', 'rocking', 'chair', 'Being', 'one', 'many', 'exhausted', 'attempts', 'family', 'baited', 'breath', 'see', 'one', 'will', 'sustain', 'weight', 'not', 'buckle', 'chair', 'shattered', 'crystal', 'chandelier.Mel', 'Gibson', 'acting', 'was', 'worst', 'ever', 'Braveheart', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'William', 'Wallace', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'was', 'soothingly', 'natural', 'part', 'Patriot', 'was', 'as', 'awkward', 'duck-footed', 'cat', 'Not', 'too', 'be', 'stood', 'up', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'acted', 'more', 'worse', 'something', 'reenacting', 'historic', 'events', 'actors', 'declamatory', 'mode', 'declamatory', 'demonstrative', 'actor', 'one', 'strong', 'stereotype', 'rather', 'doing', 'what', 'actual', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'act', 'merely', 'portray', 'stereotype', 'good', 'example', 'declamatory', 'actor', 'well', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Hamlet', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'get', 'idea', 'embarrassing', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'negative', 'ure', 'heard', 'somebody', 'scream', 'pain', 'cannon', 'ball', 'seemingly', 'shot', 'audience', 'digitized', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'hackneyed', 'battle', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'distant', 'matter', 'how', 'close', 'cameraman', 'zoomed', 'am', 'convinced', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'shot', 'late', '1700', 'Furthermore', 'want', 'know', 'where', '7.00', 'going', 'might', 'take', 'brother', 'suggestion', 'just', 'watch', 'trailers', 'now', 'two', 'minutes', 'intrigue', '158minutes', 'coma', 'inducing', 'melodrama', 'balled', 'fist.Against', 'father', 'will', 'Gabriel', 'Martin', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', ""'re"", 'fifteen', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'Ten', 'Things', 'Hate', 'then', 'probably', 'recognize', 'teenage', 'Verona', 'march', 'off', 'war', 'defend', 'colonies', 'red-coated', 'Brits', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'veteran', 'war', 'adamantly', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'enlistment', 'parent', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'Benjamin', 'teenagers', 'have', 'iron', 'skulls', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'penetrated', 'reason', 'experience', 'even', 'kryptonite', 'war', 'wages', 'assassination', 'second', 'eldest', 'son', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'rejoin', 'ranks', 'fight', 'alongside', 'Gabriel', 'plot', 'epic', 'lines', 'interesting', 'story', 'ball', 'roll', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'malnourished', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'underdeveloped', 'emotion', 'characters', 'movie', 'more', 'rental.The', 'Patriot', 'not', 'however', 'touchstone', 'cinematic', 'ineptitude', 'currently', 'spot', 'reserved', 'Mission', '2', 'Mars', 'not', 'seize', 'audience', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'want', 'American', 'catharsis', 'watch', 'fireworks', 'listen', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'Coming', 'America', 'want', 'comedy', 'watch', 'Me', 'Myself', 'amp', 'Irene', 'want', 'action/suspense', 'watch', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'Patriot']",N/A

But really, ""The Propagandist"" would be most apt, since this laughable ""history"" is some of the most virulent Anglophobic claptrap I have ever seen.  All the blatant inaccuracy of Revere's famous Boston Massacre engraving seems to be the approach, i.e., forget the facts, just hate the Brits!I couldn't decide if the cartoon characters shown as the Brits were more one-dimensionally stupid or one-dimensionally bloodthirsty. Oops!  Maybe I've missed some unexpected character development in a Gibson flick - the Brits really were two-dimensional:  stupid AND bloodthirsty.And gee, what a ""good massuh"" Gibson's character was to his slaves - they all loved him.  Kind of makes you want to be a slave and wonder what all that abolitionist nonsense was about!Can anyone even begin to believe how [incorrect] the facts are in this mess of a film? Turning regular British soldiers into incessant civilian-murdering thugs may have been what one would expect of a period propagandist like Paul Revere, but surely we ought to expect a bit more truth and enlightened approach these days. And the watering down of the hateful institution of slavery, practiced by these ""patriots"", just sidesteps an historical dilemma we Amercians ought to be coming to grips with some day.I am also very tired of the untruthful cliches in supposed historical films, and I thought the American public would be too at this point.  What is really disappointing to me is that some of my countrymen are so sheepishly jingoistic that they'll get caught up in this ""hooray for the red white and blue"" mentality and like this film, despite what...it really is.For example, if these film makers had made a brand new Western showing the old cliches - the peaceful, civilized, settlers getting massacred by the savage, bloodthirsty Indians - the film would have been hooted out of the theatre.  But somehow, because it is so ""patriotic"" to support the American revolution, and fashionable to think badly of the Brits, we accept the same level of outrageously untruthful cliches in this film.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who would prefer some small level of truth in their historical films.

It had a big impact on me, and gave me a deeper respect and understanding of the Revolutionary War. All off the characters and actors were incredible, and the scenery was spectacular. It doesn't seem too Hollywoodish to me. This story has some important messages for all us to learn, especially for those that have men & women fighting in our armed forces.The story takes place in South Carolina in July 1775, where Benjamin Martin (Oscar-Award winner Mel Gibson, ""Braveheart"", ""Pocahontas"", ""What Women Want"", ""Letal Weapon"", ""Forever Young"") leads a quiet life on his plantation with his family after serving as captain during the French and Indian War. He doesn't like war after seeing all the souls being lost, and he certainly doesn't want his older sons, Gabriel (Heath Ledger, ""A Knight's Tale"", ""The Brothers Grimm"") & Thomas (Gregory Smith, ""Everwood"") to get involved with the Revolutionary War against England. Years earlier, Benjamin lost his wife, but is always remembered as the North Star. One day, they recieve a letter from the Charleston congress to come to a meeting to decide whether or not South Carolina should be involved in the war. They arrive in this big city, where they greet their aunt Charlotte (Joely Richardson, ""101 Dalmatians [1996 version with Glenn Close]""). During the meeting, people from all across the state speak out their opinion, including Benjamin. He believes that war doesn't solve the answer, and believes that talking to the British would solve things a whole lot better than losing millions of lives in battle. (Amen!) But the votes of joining the war were higher than not joining the war-28-18, to be exact. Gabriel signs up to join the army against his father's wishes. A few months later, he returns wounded while carrying dispatches to the Patriots. Benjamin urges him to stay home while he heals. The next day, while the Martins are tending to the wounded Redcoats and Continentals, Gen. Lord Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"") comes along and commands all of the Martins' African-American servants to fight for the British, as well as the house and plantation being burned down because they were aiding the enemy. (How unfair is that? Have they ever heard of good sportsmanship in war?) Also, they capture Gabriel and sentence him to death. While Benjamin couldn't do anything to stop the British, since they would kill all of his family members if he did, Thomas rushes out to stop the them from taking Gabriel, but is killed by Cornwallis. All this happens in front of the family's eyes. Hurt and angry, Benjamin grabs his guns, takes his two younger sons, Nathan (Trevor Morgan, ""I'll Remember April"") and Samuel (Bryan Chafin), and goes off and kills the Redcoats holding Gabriel captive. After all the blood and sweat is shed, they return home to take the children to live with Charlotte in her plantation not far from their own. Benjamin decide to join the war, in vegeance for what has happened. Through the course of this film, Benjamin, Gabriel, and his comrades will experience plenty of sadness, anger, victory, and losses in many of the battles fought.You already know in the course of American history that the Americans win the war, but this is the inside story of the fighting that was over 200 years ago. The characters, scenes, costumes, and words said in this film are so real; it makes you feel like you're actually there, living and breathing every speck of history. As I said earlier, there are some lessons taught in this film. The biggest one probably being that war isn't worth it because of all of the innocent lives taken away in the course of war. But at the same time, we should be thankful for all of the men & women who fight for our country to keep freedom and equality alive for all people around the world.There are plenty of scenes that are truly unforgettable, but also said, such as all of the Martins' closest family and friends and homes being destroyed by the British. Those scenes made me want to cry because it was so sad to lose people or things that are close to your heart.Buy this film today.

557043,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00004XPPG,Lawyeraau,"[0, 1]","Mel Gibson plays the role of an early American colonist, Benjamin Martin. He is a reluctant hero, a man who does not take sides in the Revolutionary War until forced to do so. When one of his young sons is killed during a gratuitous display of brutality by a British officer, and another is taken away to be hanged, Martin is at a crossroad in his life. This galvanizes Martin, our reluctant hero, into action, and he rescues his otherwise doomed son with a ferocity of purpose that is gripping.Once committed, Martin becomes a leader of the local militia and the scourge of the British. There is a droll scene in which he and Cornwallis, the leader of the British campaign, meet, and Martin manages to get the better of him. It is here, however, that the British officer who killed Martin's son locks horns with Martin, and the lines are drawn. This sets the tenor for what is to come.There are scenes of great barbarity and pathos, which tell one that war is not just about heroism and great battles, but about personal pain and loss. It is about a desire for freedom and the privilege of living in peace without the yoke of tyranny around one's neck. Despite the odds, Martin cuts a wide swath of destruction among the British, and his prowess and leadership on the battlefield ultimately lead to a turning point in the American Revolution.This movie shows the effect that the war had on civilians and how their lives were affected by it. The film is about love, family, honor, dishonor, tragedy, and redemption. Deftly directed by Roland Emmerich, this is a well-acted film with stirring action scenes. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast as a colonist whose life is turned upside down by the vagaries of war. The supporting cast is, likewise, excellent.

It's the same old/usual cliches involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: the British  (it must have been really difficult to include Germans, Serbs or Russians in this one...).For starters, misusing the term Patriot in referring to Englishmen who betrayed their government, their country, and their flag, is reminiscent of the Soviet Union and how they christened their ultimate tool (newspaper) of propaganda Pravda, or ""Truth.""Similarly, the British Colonel asked the Loyalist how he could betray his neighbors and not the other way around.2) From the beginning, the setting is South Carolina and all that is heard throughout the film is either a British or a Northern (Yankee) accent!3) South Carolina was home to most of the 13 colonies' Loyalists, even to the point of outnumbering the Continentals, yet all we saw was but a few.4) At the time when the S.C. Assembly voted in favor of secession not a single Red Coat or a single Loyalist were in the vicinity!  Not a single shot was fired...5) There is no clarification that taxes set by the British Government are taxes set by King and Parliament, not King George III alone.6) Throughout the film the Continentals are presented in good light while the Red Coats are demonized.  Oh, I forgot; the British have to be the baddies while the Continentals are the heroes...  Have mercy on us, please!7) The movie does not really portray the double-crossing merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain.  Nor does it show the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes, favoritism, public relations, political connections), between Congress and the Army, as well as the farmers and most importantly the merchants profiteering at the expense of whoever/whichever side etc.8) Martin's slaves were not slaves; they were ""free men"" working of their own will...9) Does not show what the Continentals did to the Loyalists during and after the Revolution.10) Blacks and Whites fighting together against the British was simply absurd for that era.  What's more, the British policy, which was indeed to free the slaves from the colonists, is ridiculed in the movie...In short, the film does a good job, as it should do, in presenting a case study on the use of propaganda on unaware people and the danger it poses.If the American Revolution is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING films Revolution starring Al Pacino and Donald Sutherland, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer.In conclusion, the potential for a great movie was there.

There was action throughout -- love, heroism, and big, bold and bloody emotion-grabbing battle scenes.  I don't ever remember being so caught up in a film.Of course it has its flaws.  The movie is set in South Carolina and yet I didn't hear any southern accents.  And could there really have been such a beautiful unmarried and loving woman just waiting for Mel Gibson?  The attempt at political correctness seems a bit contrived.  The British are depicted as cruel monsters.  And there's little about the real politics that were going on at the time.However, and this is a BIG however, none of this matters as to the enjoyment of the film which bombarded all my emotions and set me right in the middle of the action.  Yes, it was sensationalism all the way.  Heroes and villains. Some of the most bloody battle scenes I have ever seen.  And history that is alive on the screen rather than just words in a book.

The special effects are pretty good, but this is a Blockbuster...so they had a big budget, and they did the same mistake than the awful Godzilla and the very boring Independence Day (and by the way, it's the same director in this one). This is a part of history that wants itself to be shown on a golden plate, but the bad quality of the script and directing make the plate cheaper. I compare this film to Braveheart a lot, and I realize how good Braveheart was, and how deceiving The Patriot is. It's the same kind of situation that brings the hero to react and create an army to destroy the bad guys and get back their freedom. Some scenes try to be pathetic, but Mel Gibson isn't convincing at all.

This story takes place in 1776, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a hero of the Fort Wilderness campaign, now a widower living in South Carolina with seven children to raise on his own, is once again confronted with war in ""The Patriot."" Mr. Martin believes in the cause, but has had enough of war and killing in his life, and is troubled by the prospect of leaving his children orphans if he must fight again; but as in real life, things happen that change your mind despite your beliefs and he soon realizes that he has no choice other than to join in the conflict.

He imbues him with the stoicism needed to shoulder responsibility, but also with the human touch required of fatherhood.Historically, whether or not ""The Patriot"" is accurate in detail is not really important.

He has hung up his weapons and wants to live peacefully on his family farm and care for his children. He has a past as a fearsome warrior, but has hung up his axe (literally). He's an admirable character. Unfortunately the tide of war comes close to home and he is forced to take up arms to defend those he loves (his children) and fight for freedom from British tierany.He becomes an respected leader of a band of simple country folk who took up arms in defense of freedom for this great country of ours. They look up to him as a great leader and follow him into battle. The scenes of battle leave you feeling such great admiration for these simple people who could have taken the easy road, but instead took the hard road even though they knew that for many of them it would lead to death.The acting in this film (all the actors) is wonderful, you feel as though you are watching the real thing and not just a recreation of the past.

This Revolutionary War saga is amazingly similar to Braveheart, in that a peace loving but fiercely able Gibson is forced from a pastoral life by malevolent political forces. The movie is not without highlights, notably Gibson and his two young sons taking on a handful of British soldiers, but the payoffs are ho-hum.

557062,A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O,B00004XPPG,"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot""","[2, 6]","""We hold these truths to be self-evident:That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ... whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government ...""1775:After more than a decade of enduring various measures including highly unpopular taxations, insensitive customs regulation, peace-time quartering and maintenance of standing armies, deprivation of trial by jury, the largely unpunished act of the Boston Massacre, and other British misuses of authority and legality ... Colonial America was ready for war. Some colonists had started gathering arms for the eventuality.And Britain - harboring the recent memory of the December `73 ""tea party"" in Boston harbor, as well as other acts of rebellion, riot, and intimidation - seemed just as ready to suppress.In April, General Thomas Gage deployed troops to dismantle colonial military storages in Concord, New Hampshire. On the 19th local minutemen, forewarned by Paul Revere, met British redcoats on Lexington Green ...and however initially gradual it was to catch on, the colonies' historic fight for independence from England, famously known as the American Revolutionary War, began. (The quote above, excerpted from the Declaration itself, actually originated after the eruption of war; it does, however, open an incisive window into American political feeling at the time.) Colonial victory at Concord, and the immediate aftermath, drew out much patriotic support throughout New England. About 16,000 residents took up a siege of Boston, forcing the British to withdraw the next March (`76).Later, in June, Thomas Jefferson drafted an official document stating the colonies' independence from the British Crown. The formal declaration was revised and finally adopted in the early evening of July 4, to be signed by an eventual fifty-six men. Not surprisingly, American statesmen shortly thereafter rejected terms of peace and pardon offered by England through (General) William and (Admiral Lord) Richard Howe. General Howe organized his troops and forced a colonial army under General George Washington in Long Island to retreat, first to Manhattan, then to White Plains. General Charles Cornwallis then pushed Washington from New York down to New Jersey, where the former stopped for winter at Trenton, and the latter camped opposite him along the Delaware River's Pennsylvania bank. Washington and company crossed the Delaware late Christmas night, and surprised Cornwallis' garrison. When Cornwallis regained control of Trenton, Washington escaped and proceeded to overpower British reinforcements at Princeton. His victory gave new life to the waning patriotic spirit of the war.Further north, British General John Burgoyne began leading an army southward. His July of `77 capture of Fort Ticonderoga was briefly enjoyed, however. He suffered a double defeat at Albany by American Generals Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold, and surrendered at Saratoga in October.Following a loss at Brandywine Creek and a meager outcome at Germantown, Washington and his Continental Army wintered at Valley Forge. The general was fortunate, as he had in his services a Prussian officer (von Steuben) who trained his men in more efficient methods of combat, which turned out to be substantially helpful in securing a much-needed victory at Monmouth, NJ, the following June ('78).That month, France declared War on England and mobilized a fleet, and would later become instrumental in the sieges of Savannah and Yorktown. The Spanish declared war on England the next year, 1779, with the Netherlands following suit in 1780. The insurgency was no longer a merely internal affair, but an international event.Meanwhile, Cornwallis had regrouped in the South. In mid-August, he all but demolished General Gates' army at Camden, but saw defeat at Kings Mountain (October) and at Cowpens (January). After a brief clash in North Carolina, Cornwallis headed into Virginia and rooted himself within Yorktown. French naval forces drove the remaining British navy out of the Chesapeake, and then moved in on Cornwallis; Washington was there, and he too pressed in: the two surrounding him, working away at his forces. On 19 October 1781, Cornwallis surrendered.The war on American soil had ended. Fighting still continued at sea, but from here out until its conclusion in 1783, most engagements took place between British, and corresponding European enemy, vessels.The thirteen colonies emerged an infant nation.--Columbia TriStar's summertime fireworks-and-flags flick THE PATRIOT strives to set itself firmly on the historical ground of Revolutionary America, even if sometimes it loses its footing.Set against the backdrop of the late-eighteenth century colonial period, the movie tells the story of Benjamin Martin, a South Carolina farmer who desires peace among a growing spirit of rebellion against England. But when an unusually cruel British colonel threatens his family, Martin turns deadly and joins in the fight. He bravely leads bands of enlisted men into battle, through victory and defeat, often outnumbered, in the struggle to win the independence of the states.Benjamin Martin seems to have been partially modeled after Francis Marion, the elusive ""Swamp Fox,"" as the British dubbed him. Like Martin, Marion was from South Carolina. Like Martin, he fought in the French & Indian War. Like Martin (occasionally), he fought redcoats guerilla-style. UN-like Martin, he probably never opposed the American rebellion. Nor is it likely that he ever faced Lord Cornwallis, let alone outwitted him. (The filmmakers really strayed from history here, since Cornwallis was, by all accounts, a highly intelligent strategist, and may have been England's most capable commander in North America.) Colonel Tavington is himself based on real-life British officer Banastre Tarleton, known as ""Bloody Ban,"" a ranking lieutenant colonel commandant who employed cruel tactics against Americans during the war.But the film does get other things right as well. The issues of tyranny and despotism were both apparent and decried by Americans, and treason was probably the commonest charge invoked by the British on those who advocated rebellion. Armies fought each other wherever open lands permitted. If that included your back or front yard, so be it. Many within the militia - most of whom were farmers - utilized guerilla warfare techniques, finding them to be their most useful defense strategy. The British, not unlike previous empires, had an affinity for using fire: they burned houses, barns, supply stores, and yes, even churches - in at least one or two cases. Christianity permeated much of colonial life. Preachers are known to have joined, and in some cases they led, the fight for a nation's liberty. Bundling bags were a means (at the time) of preserving virginity until marriage.Mel Gibson appears convincing as Benjamin Martin. Jason Isaacs does better, as Colonel William Tavington. But it is Tom Wilkinson who puts in the best overall performance, as the General Lord Cornwallis. Where acting is not so much of a problem, the screenplay can be. When Martin politely asks to sit next to his sister-in-law, she replies, ""It's a free country ... or at least it will be."" Would any colonial have made such a casual remark, in the middle of war? Let us not forget that the `Amendments' of the Constitution were yet to be formed. Nobody at the time really had a great sense of freedom. They yearned for it, to be sure, but not so much to possess it as some abstract concept; what they sought was a self-governing liberty, total independence from Britain. Elsewhere, the Frenchman tells a slave-hater, ""Your sense of freedom is as pale as your skin."" While this is certainly possible, it in no way represents the general mood of the time toward slavery, which the director mostly glosses over. Instead, it would have looked better to drop the statement and show a bit more of the slave's struggle to acquire that freedom, amidst the ungrateful boos of racists. And what happened to the accents? Despite their opposition, most colonists were Englishmen enjoying English culture in English colonies. The majority should have had British accents, and those that didn't should have had other European accents. No specifically later-American ones. As for the plot, a couple of times elements during or following action sequences are improbably portrayed. Once, a British officer is shot in either the stomach (one of the most painful areas, it is said, in which to get hit) or the side, and falls over. Just before he is decisively stabbed, he inexplicably summons the strength (and knowledge?) to whirl around and thrust his sword into his would-be killer. Just before a character finishes off his nemesis, he says, ""My sons were better men,"" knowing that he'd killed them. But, in the case of one son, he neither sees nor hears `who' killed him. He just finds his son on the ground, dying an on-the-battlefield death, with little further indication as to who may have fatally wounded him (it's knife-related, which would narrow the possibilities down but not single out any one person). This leaves us wondering how the father figured out the killer's identity. And, while not actually a flaw, it should be noted that the French helped the American cause NOT because they were pro-America, but because they were anti-British. Finally, in one scene, the special effects used to convey ship sails and masts look phony.But none of these missteps make THE PATRIOT a bad movie. Nor does the fact that it is so much like Gibson's earlier film `Braveheart'. It is, in fact, quite good. Most of it is serious and very entertaining, and we can be thankful Roland Emmerich didn't repeat his earlier mistake (""Independence Day""). Too few movies have been made about this specific period of American history, and this one is noble in its attempt to show us what our forefathers and their contemporaries sacrificed to secure our freedom.DVD features include director/producer commentary, various featurettes, deleted scenes, photo galleries, and theatrical trailers.",4,"The Patriot, and the War for Independence",1105488000,"01

557063,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00004XPPG,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","To paraphrase Charles Dickens, The Patriot is the best of movies and the worst of movies. Visually, it ranks with Gladiator  as one of the great movies of 2000. The story has power because, like Gone with the Wind, it brings home the horror of war, in this case The American Revolution, by focusing on its effects on one family. The element that makes it the worst of movies is its historical perspective. The movies generally make bad history teachers. Their primary purpose is to entertain. Still, there have been scores of pictures which have successfully approximated the historical period they were set in without sacrificing their entertainment quotient. So what are we to make of The Patriot? My suggestion is that the viewer enjoy its epic story and remember that it is just a well told tall tale, just a lavishly produced fable.Col. Benjamin Martin [Mel Gibson] fought in the French and Indian Wars. While hailed a hero, he is racked with guilt over a grisly incident that occurred during his command. He is now a farmer in South Carolina. Recently widowed, Martin must also raise his seven children who range in age from three to seventeen. The revolution has begun in the northern colonies. Martin supports the cause of freedom from British rule, but he stops short of advocating war, much to the chagrin of his two oldest sons. When Gabriel [Heath Ledger] disobeys his father and enlists, Martin is saddened but determined not to bloody his own hands again. When another son is killed in front of him and his other children, Martin's mind is changed. He is forced once more to become the warrior.The visuals truly are impressive. The digitally rendered backgrounds, such as Charleston harbor, blend seamlessly with the actors in the foreground. The battle scenes are immense in size, very well choreographed and intensely dramatic. The many costumes are elaborate and colorful. The photography has especially vibrant hues. Having lived in the area of South Carolina where many of the exteriors were filmed, I have to add that it is one of the most beautiful areas in the country.Mel Gibson gives his usual workman-like but enthusiastic performance. As Gabriel, Heath Ledger, raised like Gibsonin Australia, seems more like a young man having a blast making a movie than one enmeshed in bloody revolution. Still, he is apt to become a star in his own right. The female leads, Joely Richardson and Lisa Brenner, both do a good job, but in several scenes they are required to wear makeup that is strictly 21st Century. Martin's younger children are the usual adorable types that exist as a group only in the movies. There is one remarkable performance, that of Jason Issacs as Col. William Tavington, a British officer, Martin's nemesis, and one of the best villains of late. Issacs sinks his teeth into the role.The Patriot is moviemaking on the grand scale, and if you can disregard its historical mistruths, it can be grandly entertaining.",3,"Entertaining if you view it as a tall tale, not history",1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2951,"['paraphrase', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Patriot', 'best', 'movies', 'worst', 'movies', 'Visually', 'Gladiator', 'one', 'great', 'movies', '2000', 'story', 'power', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'home', 'horror', 'war', 'case', 'American', 'Revolution', 'focusing', 'effects', 'one', 'family', 'element', 'worst', 'movies', 'historical', 'perspective', 'movies', 'generally', 'make', 'bad', 'history', 'teachers', 'primary', 'purpose', 'entertain', 'Still', 'have', 'been', 'scores', 'pictures', 'have', 'successfully', 'approximated', 'historical', 'period', 'were', 'set', 'sacrificing', 'entertainment', 'quotient', 'what', 'are', 'make', 'Patriot', 'suggestion', 'viewer', 'enjoy', 'epic', 'story', 'remember', 'just', 'well', 'told', 'tall', 'tale', 'just', 'lavishly', 'produced', 'fable.Col', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', '[', 'Mel', 'Gibson', ']', 'fought', 'French', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'hailed', 'hero', 'racked', 'guilt', 'grisly', 'incident', 'occurred', 'command', 'now', 'farmer', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Recently', 'widowed', 'Martin', 'must', 'also', 'raise', 'seven', 'children', 'who', 'range', 'age', 'three', 'seventeen', 'revolution', 'begun', 'northern', 'colonies', 'Martin', 'cause', 'freedom', 'British', 'rule', 'short', 'advocating', 'war', 'much', 'chagrin', 'two', 'oldest', 'sons', 'When', 'Gabriel', '[', 'Heath', 'Ledger', ']', 'disobeys', 'father', 'enlists', 'Martin', 'saddened', 'determined', 'not', 'bloody', 'own', 'hands', 'again', 'When', 'son', 'killed', 'front', 'other', 'children', 'Martin', 'mind', 'changed', 'forced', 'once', 'more', 'become', 'warrior.The', 'visuals', 'truly', 'are', 'impressive', 'digitally', 'rendered', 'backgrounds', 'such', 'Charleston', 'harbor', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'actors', 'foreground', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'immense', 'size', 'very', 'well', 'choreographed', 'intensely', 'dramatic', 'many', 'costumes', 'are', 'elaborate', 'colorful', 'photography', 'especially', 'vibrant', 'hues', 'Having', 'lived', 'area', 'South', 'Carolina', 'where', 'many', 'exteriors', 'were', 'filmed', 'have', 'add', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'areas', 'country.Mel', 'Gibson', 'usual', 'workman-like', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'Gabriel', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'raised', 'Gibsonin', 'Australia', 'more', 'young', 'man', 'having', 'blast', 'making', 'movie', 'one', 'enmeshed', 'bloody', 'revolution', 'Still', 'apt', 'become', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'female', 'leads', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Lisa', 'Brenner', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'required', 'wear', 'makeup', 'strictly', '21st', 'Century', 'Martin', 'younger', 'children', 'are', 'usual', 'adorable', 'types', 'exist', 'group', 'only', 'movies', 'one', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Issacs', 'Col.', 'William', 'Tavington', 'British', 'officer', 'Martin', 'nemesis', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'late', 'Issacs', 'teeth', 'role.The', 'Patriot', 'moviemaking', 'grand', 'scale', 'can', 'disregard', 'historical', 'mistruths', 'can', 'be', 'grandly', 'entertaining']",N/A

While it is true that there are many historical inaccuracies in this film, and it does tend to have a strong anti-Brit feel, AND it runs way too long at over two hours, I can't help but love to watch this movie!  It is one of the best depictions of the Revolutionary War era in recent times and I find the many horrifically realistic battle scenes fascinatingly re-watchable.  And I love that tomahawk!  Not since Last of the Mohicans have we seen a workout as when Benjamin Martin takes out half an infantry company with his trusty old tomahawk. While I too found it annoying that so many inaccuracies found their way into this Hollywoodized re-telling of an American legend, church burnings, free &quot;slaves&quot;, and &quot;Green&quot; Dragoon coats aside, you can't help but love the scene where Martin dupes British General Lord Cornwallis out of hanging his militiamen or the over-the-top confrontation between Martin and dashing but villianous Colonel Tavington.  There have been so many things said about the basis for Ben Martin (real-life South Carolina patriot Francis Marion) and Tavington that I found it amusing to read some of the comments below.  Francis Marion was indeed a slave-owning southern plantation owner who fought Indians and was probably, like other men of his time, a racist bigot.  Needless to say, the stories about his raping slave girls and hunting Indians for fun may be true, or may more likely be attributed to Revolutionary War era Tory propaganda that is passed off as fact even today.  That is the wonder of history! We may never know what the real Marion was like as a man, but we do know that he fought to make this country a new nation. Colonel Tavington is of course based on British Colonel Banastre Tarleton who, while never massacring civilians or dying on the battlefield, did earn himself a nasty reputation as a butcher on the part of the rebels for his zeal in cutting down surrendering troops at Camden.  If nothing else, I hope that this movie will at least inspire an interest in a great period of history and perhaps lead to even more enjoyable  and accurate Revolutionary War movies.",4,Enjoyable if Flawed,1001980800,"10 2, 2001",2001,2236,"['have', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'debate', 'back', 'forth', 'Patriot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', 'true', 'are', 'many', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'tend', 'have', 'strong', 'anti-Brit', 'feel', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'two', 'hours', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'depictions', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'era', 'recent', 'times', 'find', 'many', 'horrifically', 'realistic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'fascinatingly', 're-watchable', 'love', 'tomahawk', 'Not', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'have', 'seen', 'workout', 'when', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'out', 'infantry', 'company', 'trusty', 'old', 'tomahawk', 'too', 'found', 'annoying', 'so', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'found', 'way', 'Hollywoodized', 're-telling', 'American', 'legend', 'church', 'burnings', 'free', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Green', 'quot', 'Dragoon', 'coats', 'aside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Martin', 'British', 'General', 'Lord', 'Cornwallis', 'hanging', 'militiamen', 'over-the-top', 'confrontation', 'Martin', 'dashing', 'villianous', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'said', 'basis', 'Ben', 'Martin', 'real-life', 'South', 'Carolina', 'patriot', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'Tavington', 'found', 'amusing', 'read', 'comments', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'was', 'indeed', 'slave-owning', 'southern', 'plantation', 'owner', 'who', 'fought', 'Indians', 'was', 'probably', 'other', 'men', 'time', 'racist', 'bigot', 'Needless', 'say', 'stories', 'raping', 'slave', 'girls', 'hunting', 'Indians', 'fun', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'may', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'attributed', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'era', 'Tory', 'propaganda', 'passed', 'off', 'fact', 'even', 'today', 'wonder', 'history', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'Marion', 'was', 'man', 'do', 'know', 'fought', 'make', 'country', 'new', 'nation', 'Colonel', 'Tavington', 'course', 'based', 'British', 'Colonel', 'Banastre', 'Tarleton', 'who', 'never', 'massacring', 'civilians', 'dying', 'battlefield', 'did', 'earn', 'nasty', 'reputation', 'butcher', 'part', 'rebels', 'zeal', 'cutting', 'down', 'surrendering', 'troops', 'Camden', 'nothing', 'else', 'hope', 'movie', 'will', 'least', 'inspire', 'interest', 'great', 'period', 'history', 'perhaps', 'lead', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'accurate', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'movies']",N/A

I admit, it was cheap, and I do have phases where I have a bit of a thing of Mel Gibson. But I have to be in the right mood for him.I don't know much about American History. I don't know much about my own Scottish history actually, never mind anything else. But I liked Braveheart, so I figured this was cheap, sounded kinda similar, why the hell not? I'd bought it a few months before Heath Ledger died, and only managed to get round to watching this a couple of months later.Basically, this is one of those movies where everyone who knows their American history will quibble the slightest inaccuracy - and this kinda film is normally riddled with them. But I'm going to skip over all that. I left school for a reason.The Patriot, is about a man with seven children and no wife/mother. No, you're not getting another Von Trapp family. (SEVEN CHILDREN???) The script originally called for six children, but since Mel has seven in real life, it was changed. (SEVEN CHILDREN???) He has particpated previously in battles, and is now a proud family man, trying to keep his children out of danger. But his eldest son, played by a blonde Heath, is determined to serve his country, and goes out fighting.Meanwhile things get hectic back home, with an evil Colonel (Jason Isaacs) hellbent on wrecking quiet family life, until he encounters the Ghost. Can you guess who it is?There's not much else to report on The Patriot, without repeating 800+ reviewers have already said. It's there to be watched, but at 2hrs 48mins long, you need to find a long night free, with no interruptions. (Easter Sunday strangely enough did it for me.) Mel doesn't really get stretched playing the role of Benjamin Martin, and there are a couple of similarities, particularly in scenes, to Braveheart. (Did you see the scene where he was riding in front of the army? Did you not want to shout at the TV ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM""? Or was that just me?)It was one of those films that yes was good, but could have been edited slightly better towards the end.

557072,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,B00004XPPG,Mercy Bell,"[17, 21]","I'll risk getting raised eyebrows from fellow cinephiles and history buffs, but ""The Patriot"" is one of my favorite films. It's a film that could have been a brilliant, go-down-in-history epic if not for confining itself to studio-ism, clich&eacute;s, and historical inaccuracies where it could have done more.The story of a South Carolinian family during the infamously violent and vicious Southern campaign of the American Revolution, the film is the saga of the Martin family caught in the midst of a historical shift. The film takes complicated themes that were played out constantly during the war but are often hard to grasp or forgotten today and vividly brings them to life: neighbors killing each other, families torn apart, atrocities, the use of militia, and the cost of a war that is played out on the homefront. The violence is used to numb and shock you. In the film's goriest scene (and one of it's best) we see Benjamin (Gibson) and his two young sons chase down a British squadron after tragedy befalls his family. With pure hatred and barbarity, and using the advantage of a forest he and his sons know as their home and which the British find only a foreign jungle, he slays and reduces the squadron to one man. He chases down a soldier and hacks him to pieces in a creek as his sons watch in horror. It's the sight of a grieving man trying to bring order back into his life with tactics he and militiamen around the South of both loyalties were adept at, and were readily used to wage war upon each other. This is what the film does masterfully, it renders an image of savage violence and atrocity inflicted upon a colonial population and how it affected the individuals involved.The fact that they kill off as many characters as they do is risky, but true to the brutality and unpredictability of life and history, and gives the film the air of a true tragedy because of how much we become attached to these people (which is one reason why I have a problem with the ending). Unfortunately, the acts committed, like the film's two most emotionally gut-wrenching scenes of the burning of a church with people inside and the skirmish that follows (all breathtakingly photographed against a slate gray sky and beautiful autumn colors which only heightens the tragedy of it all), plus the massacres, torchings, and killing of prisoners, are shown as a strictly British versus American problem, where in reality the colonists were by and large the ones fighting each other in this manner. It was portrayed as far too black-and-white a dilemma, where the actual history would have been more complex and interesting. I find this frusterating because the film had already taken so many chances, such as having young boys deeply involved in the violence, harsh and tainted characters, that it would have been easy to have gone one step further. And they got the British uniforms wrong to boot. At least we get Jason Isaac's riveting and seductive performance as Tavington.The drama of the film, where it may contain some stock scenarios, mediocre dialogue and characters, is equally witty, poignant, and effective thanks to the acting and directing. The fight scenes never bore. There are many moments where the camera finds the perfect place to watch Gabriel, without an ounce of treacle, wave goodbye to his fiancee (Heath Ledger turns in a lovely, sensitive, and entirely convincing performance as a young revolutionary/big brother but without acting like a starched shirt collar); to watch Benjamin bark an order or hug his daughter (Mel plays a great daddy), for Tavington to say something piercing, for someone to die. It's moments like these that create utterly normal, real people in the midst of turmoil.This film brought me to another time and place amidst the trials of a breathing, aching family. It recreates the feel of the time so tangibly, it picks you up and plunks you right into the middle of a humid, violent place where tensions are heightened and you're constantly looking over your back to see if your family is safe, to check your loyalties. Despite some unfortunate writing - the useless aunt, whitewashing over slavery, the whole last 20 minutes of mindless explosions and revisionism which are a weird and painful shift from the brutal,visceral tone of the rest of the film - you get to know a lot of the characters on a very personal level and we begin to understand the fine lines between freedom and loyalty, taking risks or managing the threat, priorities and principles. When Benjamin doesn't want to support a war because of his family or see his sons go to fight you feel how desperate he is,but you also understand Gabriel's youthful idealism and urgency and his love for his wife (although she's fairly annoying) and his cause. We see how feelings for family, country, one's past, and enemy intermingle and how it becomes one big tangled confused smashed gory mess.The film is probably one of the best looking films out there, with stunning cinematography showcasing gorgeous Spanish moss, multicolored skies, mist, twilight, swamps. Cinematography - and production design - use the natural landscape and the period as a living part of the film's setting and just pulls us into it, help create that world, and serve to enhance much of the dramatic material. Top it off with John Williams' score which evokes the Revolution and the era and the human drama of it all.Although ""The Patriot"" isn't as masterful as it easily could have been, it's still a film worth seeing for everything it does well, which is a lot. Despite problems, this is how history should be treated, as a vivid, emotional, palpable story - a story - about people that is as thrilling and gut-wrenching as it was, and not merely a dry academic lesson. I would love to see other films pick up where ""The Patriot"" left off, take the initiative to continue and build upon what this film did so beautifully and to succeed where it didn't. Film can treat us to a different and similar world where we can attempt to understand the thrills and the woes, the joys and sorrows of the time and fate of those who lived their lives out before us.",4,"Brutal, emotional, lovely couldashouldabeen brilliant film",1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,6150,"[""'ll"", 'risk', 'getting', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'fellow', 'cinephiles', 'history', 'buffs',

557078,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00004XPPG,Michael J. Mazza,"[9, 17]","In &quot;The Patriot,&quot; director Roland Emmerich tells the story of Benjamin Martin (played by Mel Gibson), a colonial landowner whose family becomes involved in the American Revolutionary War. The film wants to be a sweeping historical epic with a heart, but its flaws weigh it down.The film aims at &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;-style realism in its warfare scenes, but this goal does not fit well with the childish humor and high school-ish romantic subplots that mark the rest of the film. In terms of plot and characterization, the script piles one stereotype and cliche upon another. Particularly ill-served are the British characters. With the exception of one amoral sadist, the British are all basically ridiculous fops.Many of the movie's scenes are blatant ripoffs from scenes in better films. Pay attention and you'll see scenes ripped off from &quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Aliens,&quot; and more.&quot;The Patriot&quot; has been harshly criticized for its whitewashing of the issue of slavery. I must admit that this is one aspect of the film that I found most unsettling. It is ironic that while the film aims at realistic battlefield carnage, it presents an insultingly simplistic, &quot;fairy tale&quot; view of happy colonial African-Americans.

The scenery and fighting scenes superb.The story itself stinks. Completely devoid of history and not much more in plot or credability.Mel Gibson's character owns a plantation but employs free negroes (NOT BELIEVABLE).

In &quot;The Patriot,&quot; this  feeling was captured in the same ways as classic war films like  &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Patton,&quot; and (gee, I wonder why?)  &quot;Braveheart.&quot;  While &quot;The Patriot&quot; really isn't as good  as any of those three, it is still quite the entertaining motion  picture.I will spare you the plot synopsis as the pros at Amazon.com  seem to do a good enough job of that for you.  This movie is well acted by  all parts, especially Gibson.  As you watch this film you will feel the  familiarity of watching &quot;Braveheart,&quot; and for good reason.  The  plot is quite similar, and Gibson once again plays a similar character.  The difference this time around is the connection you will feel as an  American. (Well, at least for us Americans, I guess...)  While we watched  &quot;Braveheart&quot; and were not only entertained but given a history  lesson, with this, you will feel the familiarity of the setting as you  brain reaches back to all that stuff we tried to forget about American  history AFTER we graduated.  It feels more...  real, I guess.The biggest  compliment I can give this film is not any I can type in here, but that  I've ordered it, and from the looks of it, I've ordered it even before  they've posted any special features.

Cornwallis was not at Cowpens (the movie's final battle) and there was no large mansion on the battlefield!  Cowpens was known as a place for cattle to graze and contained some woods but no large houses.2.  Mel Gibson loosely portrayed Francis Marion (aka &quot;The Swamp Fox) while Jacob Issacs' portrayal of Tavington was loosely based on Banastre Tarleton.  As far as I know the two never met in battle and Tarleton survived the war.  Tarleton did command the losing side in the Battle of Cowpens.3.  As far as I know, there were no French at the Battle of Cowpens - the battle was fought by militia and Continental troops on the American side vs. loyalists and British troops on the other side.4. I do not believe any record exists of Mel Gibson's character (&quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;) ever meeting Tavington (Tarleton) or Cornwallis.I live only about 1.5 hours from the Cowpens battlefield and have visited the site several times. So much for Hollywood historical accuracy!Despite this, I did enjoy the movie and could feel Gibson's reluctance to join the American cause and found myself despising Tavington (killed two of Gibson's sons, burned the church with people in it, shooting wounded Americans, torching homes, etc.).  In my humble opinion, I thought at least the acting was good.Buy or rent the movie and enjoy, but be warned: there are some bloody scenes for the squeamish.

557083,AURZ4YQ270W3T,B00004XPPG,Mike Freed,"[15, 31]","&quot;The Patriot&quot; has stunning battle sequences that show war in its full horrific reality, but displays a stunning lack of historical accuracy and moral courage. This is a film that shows people giving their lives by the thousands for freedom, but at its end, cozies up to the idea that some Americans (read: slaves) weren't all that unhappy not to be free.It's this hypocritical glossing over of historical fact that ultimately sinks &quot;The Patriot&quot;, and that's a shame, because the film has many strengths, including its depiction of the brutality of combat, marvelous period feel and set design, and a very strong performance by Mel Gibson.If you've forgotten why war is a nightmare that must be avoided at all costs - all to easy to do in today's world, where war looks like Nintendo - consider &quot;The Patriot&quot; your wake up call.The Revolutionary War wasn't fought with smart bombs, Stealth fighters and TV footage...it was fought with vast armies of men that showed up together on a battlefield and proceeded to brutally kill each other with cannons, rifles, bayonets, knives, rocks, or anything else. More than any other film in history, &quot;The Patriot&quot; shows this old-style warfare in its utter brutality and scale. It's remarkable.Unfortunately for &quot;The Patriot&quot;, the accuracy of its battle scenes doesn't make up for its utter ignorance of history or glossing over the greatest human rights issue in our nation's history.Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a widower and veteran of the French and Indian Wars. As revolutionary talk spreads, Martin would rather stay home and tend his plantation (yep, it comes complete with all-too-helpful and all-too-happy slaves). But Martin is drawn into the conflict when British officer Tavington decides to go on a Nazi-style mission of destruction against Martin, killing one of his kids, imprisoning another for the heck of it, and burning his house down. And wouldn't you just know it...Martin ends up being a one-man army of destruction against the Brits.Anyone who has even opened up a history book about the revolution knows that even in their worst moments, the Brits NEVER even approached the consistent level of indiscriminate, Nazi-style brutality portrayed in &quot;The Patriot&quot;. Unfortunately, that's the impression that this movie gives, and in an age where kids can't remember when the Civil War was fought, such blatant historical inaccuracy is downright irresponsible.Then there's the depiction of slavery, which is utterly ridiculous and borderline insulting. First off, I have very little sympathy for someone who fights for freedom but owns slaves, and Martin is a slaveowner. For this viewer, that fact drained the Martin character of every bit of nobility, despite Gibson's excellent performance.One of Martin's slaves joins the revolution because George Washington has promised freedom for any slave who fights. So what's the first thing this newly-freed slave wants to do after the war's over? He wants to rebuild Martin's house.Huh? This guy is free and the first thing he wants to do is hang out with 'Massuh' and rebuild his house? Man, how much did they have to pay a black actor to buy into this racist apologist drivel?That's what I found most disturbing about this film: after showing us brutal battle after brutal battle, all fought in the name of freedom, &quot;The Patriot&quot; glosses over the fact that after the battles were done, millions of Americans weren't free at all.Talk about an opportunity lost...wouldn't it have been better to confront Martin with his hypocrisy after sacrificing so much in the name of freedom? Why couldn't he realize that when some Americans weren't free, NO Americans were really free? Now that would have been a ending with teeth...as it is, we get feel-good namby pamby.So there you have it, folks: &quot;The Patriot&quot; is a historical drama that honors history in its depiction of violence but ignores it in its depiction of the British, and glosses over the reality that freedom wasn't really freedom for many Americans.",2,"Great battle sequences, but fails utterly as history...",972950400,"10 31, 2000",2000,4087,"['quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'stunning', 'battle', 'sequences', 'show', 'war', 'full', 'horrific', 'reality', 'stunning', 'lack', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'moral', 'courage', 'film', 'people', 'giving', 'lives', 'thousands', 'freedom', 'end', 'idea', 'Americans', 'read', 'slaves', 'were', ""n't"", 'unhappy', 'not', 'be', 'free.It', 'hypocritical', 'glossing', 'historical', 'fact', 'ultimately', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'shame', 'film', 'many', 'strengths', 'including', 'depiction', 'brutality', 'combat', 'marvelous', 'period', 'feel', 'set', 'design', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'Mel', 'Gibson.If', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'why', 'war', 'nightmare', 'must', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'easy', 'do', 'today', 'world', 'where', 'war', 'Nintendo', 'consider', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'wake', 'up', 'call.The', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'was', ""n't"", 'fought', 'smart', 'bombs', 'Stealth', 'fighters', 'TV', 'footage', 'was', 'fought', 'vast', 'armies', 'men', 'showed', 'up', 'together', 'battlefield', 'proceeded', 'brutally', 'kill', 'other', 'cannons', 'rifles', 'bayonets', 'knives', 'rocks', 'anything', 'else', 'More', 'other', 'film', 'history', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'old-style', 'warfare', 'utter', 'brutality', 'scale', 'remarkable.Unfortunately', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'accuracy', 'battle', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'utter', 'ignorance', 'history', 'glossing', 'greatest', 'human', 'rights', 'issue', 'nation', 'history.Gibson', 'stars', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'widower', 'veteran', 'French', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'revolutionary', 'talk', 'spreads', 'Martin', 'would', 'rather', 'stay', 'home', 'tend', 'plantation', 'yep', 'complete', 'all-too-helpful', 'all-too-happy', 'slaves', 'Martin', 'drawn', 'conflict', 'when', 'British', 'officer', 'Tavington', 'go', 'Nazi-style', 'mission', 'destruction', 'Martin', 'killing', 'one', 'kids', 'imprisoning', 'heck', 'burning', 'house', 'down', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'know', 'Martin', 'up', 'being', 'one-man', 'army', 'destruction', 'Brits.Anyone', 'who', 'even', 'opened', 'up', 'history', 'book', 'revolution', 'even', 'worst', 'moments', 'Brits', 'NEVER', 'even', 'approached', 'consistent', 'level', 'indiscriminate', 'Nazi-style', 'brutality', 'portrayed', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'impression', 'movie', 'age', 'where', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'fought', 'such', 'blatant', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'downright', 'irresponsible.Then', 'depiction', 'slavery', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'borderline', 'insulting', 'First', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'sympathy', 'someone', 'who', 'freedom', 'slaves', 'Martin', 'slaveowner', 'viewer', 'fact', 'drained', 'Martin', 'character', 'bit', 'nobility', 'Gibson', 'excellent', 'performance.One', 'Martin', 'slaves', 'revolution', 'George', 'Washington', 'promised', 'freedom', 'slave', 'who', 'what', 'first', 'thing', 'newly-freed', 'slave', 'do', 'war', 'rebuild', 'Martin', 'house.Huh', 'guy', 'free', 'first', 'thing', 'do', 'hang', 'out', ""'Massuh"", 'rebuild', 'house', 'Man', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'have', 'pay', 'black', 'actor', 'buy', 'racist', 'apologist', 'drivel', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', 'showing', 'brutal', 'battle', 'brutal', 'battle', 'fought', 'name', 'freedom', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'fact', 'battles', 'were', 'done', 'millions', 'Americans', 'were', ""n't"", 'free', 'all.Talk', 'opportunity', 'lost', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'confront', 'Martin', 'hypocrisy', 'sacrificing', 'so', 'much', 'name', 'freedom', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'realize', 'when', 'Americans', 'were', ""n't"", 'free', 'NO', 'Americans', 'were', 'really', 'free', 'Now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ending', 'teeth', 'get', 'feel-good', 'namby', 'pamby.So', 'have', 'folks', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'historical', 'drama', 'honors', 'history', 'depiction', 'violence', 'depiction', 'British', 'reality', 'freedom', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'freedom', 'many', 'Americans']",N/A

557085,A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B00004XPPG,"Mike ""Movie Buff""","[1, 2]","Actors Mel Gibson (Lethal Weapon saga), Heath Ledger (10 Things I Hate About You), Tcheky Karyo (The Core), and Rene Auberjonois (Odo from Star Trek: DS9) lead an all-star cast loosely based on the American Revolution in the states of Virginia and the Carolinas. When I say loosely, I mean it's kind of one sided. If you've read textbooks in the United States you will notice how Britain is cast as an evil parent (as the mother country of the 13 colonies). General Cornwallis is referred to as a poor general. But that's the textbooks and this review is more about the movie itself.Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a former leader in the colonial militia who fought in the French Indian War. The captain of the militia tries but unsuccessfully to recruit Martin in the Continental Army. Tragedy strikes when a brutal British Colonel kills one of Martin's young sons. Martin then joins the Continental Army to lead and take revenge for what Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) had taken from him. Benjamin Martin in his battle expierence begins to take charge of a small militia and teaches them battle tactics that the British are unfamiliar with. While slavery isn't entirely viewed in the movie, it was shown as the continental army General named George Washington allowed slaves to fight on the Continental Army for aperiod of time and then were free. Donal Logue plays a member of the miltia who disagrees with this notion but as human as he is, he changes his mind and embraces a slave who's time was up yet still stayed. Anyway, the British outnumber the colonial militia who are nothing more than farmers. As Martin's militia begin to be a thorn in Cornwallis's side, the colonists begin to believe in their cause. In the history books, the French aid the colonies with soldiers, able bodied generals, supplies, and ships.Tcheky Karyo plays a French general who fights along side Gibson's Martin as well as training his men. Both Gibson and Karyo provide some good comedy relief within a war which is never fun.All in all this is a great war movie that makes for an interesting view during the time period when some colonists insisted on breaking from the mother country: Britain. The starts as the American Revolution had already started. It's a great movie set in a time period that I love the most; The colonies and the Revolutionary War.

557086,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,B00004XPPG,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[5, 9]","&quot;The Patriot,&quot; starring Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Chris Cooper, Jason Isaacs, and Tom Wilkinson, is a film that's well acted and sumptuously produced, although not particularly historically accurate.  It tells the heroic story of how one man's attitude toward the war slowly ensnaring him and his family changed from one of indifference to fervent patriotism; a tale of how a stolid family man and pillar of his community became an impassioned leader of men in battle, and, ultimately, a hero to his nation's cause.I enjoyed every aspect of this superb film.  Mel Gibson turns in another characteristically fine performance as Colonel Benjamin Martin. Gibson portrays the movie's protagonist as a man of contradictions: gentle with his children, yet possessed with an almost demonic violent streak; a stolid, almost stoic family man capable of demonstrating great passion for the cause he so deeply believes in;  a man of great honor who will not hesitate to stoop to less than honorable means to achieve his goals; and a man tortured by a dark secret in his past.One other particularly noteworthy performance must be mentioned here:  that of Jason Isaacs as the pathologically evil Colonel William Tavington.  With his icy blue eyes and clipped, uppercrust British accent,  Isaacs imbues his deliciously evil character with ramrod-straight military bearing, stuffily aristocratic swagger, and overweening pomposity, making him the kind of arch-villian easy for viewers to hate passionately.Heart-pounding action abounds in &quot;The Patriot.&quot;  Battle scenes are well choreographed and employ just the right amount of bloody realism, without succumbing to gratuitous sanguinary violence.  Some viewers may find themselves a bit squeamish at a couple of points in the film; however, those scenes of gore are necessary and pass by very quickly.If there is one area in &quot;The Patriot&quot; deserving of criticism, it's the apparent lack of an original idea.  It appears to me that &quot;The Patriot&quot;  relied too heavily upon another wildly popular Mel Gibson vehicle - &quot;Braveheart&quot; - for its inspiration.  Indeed, the similarities between the themes in these two films are so striking that they cannot be coincidence!  In both films, the protagonist - already a hero to his people - has ambivalent feelings toward violence.  Only a heart-shattering event resulting in a deep personal loss is capable of changing the protagonist's mind about fighting the enemy of his people.  Once committed, however, the hero becomes an impassioned, almost zealous, exponent of his cause.  I would have liked to see &quot;The Patriot's&quot; screen writers rely a bit more on an original story line.  It would have made an already entertaining film even better.For lovers of great action movies and fans of Mel Gibson: don't miss &quot;The Patriot!&quot;  It's first-rate entertainment all the way!",4,&quot;Braveheart&quot; at the Battle of Cowpens!,992563200,"06 15, 2001",2001,2912,"['quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'sumptuously', 'produced', 'not', 'particularly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'heroic', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'attitude', 'war', 'slowly', 'ensnaring', 'family', 'changed', 'one', 'indifference', 'fervent', 'patriotism', 'tale', 'how', 'stolid', 'family', 'man', 'pillar', 'community', 'became', 'impassioned', 'leader', 'men', 'battle', 'ultimately', 'hero', 'nation', 'cause.I', 'enjoyed', 'aspect', 'superb', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'characteristically', 'fine', 'performance', 'Colonel', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'man', 'contradictions', 'gentle', 'children', 'yet', 'possessed', 'almost', 'demonic', 'violent', 'streak', 'stolid', 'almost', 'stoic', 'family', 'man', 'capable', 'demonstrating', 'great', 'passion', 'cause', 'so', 'deeply', 'man', 'great', 'honor', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'hesitate', 'stoop', 'less', 'honorable', 'means', 'achieve', 'goals', 'man', 'tortured', 'dark', 'secret', 'past.One', 'other', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'here', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'pathologically', 'evil', 'Colonel', 'William', 'Tavington', 'icy', 'blue', 'eyes', 'clipped', 'uppercrust', 'British', 'accent', 'Isaacs', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'character', 'ramrod-straight', 'military', 'bearing', 'stuffily', 'aristocratic', 'swagger', 'overweening', 'pomposity', 'making', 'kind', 'arch-villian', 'easy', 'viewers', 'hate', 'passionately.Heart-pounding', 'action', 'abounds', 'quot', 'Patriot.', 'quot', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'choreographed', 'employ', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'bloody', 'realism', 'succumbing', 'gratuitous', 'sanguinary', 'violence', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'squeamish', 'couple', 'points', 'film', 'however', 'scenes', 'gore', 'are', 'necessary', 'pass', 'very', 'quickly.If', 'one', 'area', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'deserving', 'criticism', 'apparent', 'lack', 'original', 'idea', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'vehicle', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'inspiration', 'Indeed', 'similarities', 'themes', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'striking', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'coincidence', 'films', 'protagonist', 'already', 'hero', 'people', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'violence', 'Only', 'heart-shattering', 'event', 'resulting', 'deep', 'personal', 'loss', 'capable', 'changing', 'protagonist', 'mind', 'fighting', 'enemy', 'people', 'Once', 'committed', 'however', 'hero', 'impassioned', 'almost', 'zealous', 'exponent', 'cause', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'screen', 'writers', 'rely', 'bit', 'more', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'already', 'entertaining', 'film', 'even', 'better.For', 'lovers', 'great', 'action', 'movies', 'fans', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'first-rate', 'entertainment', 'way']",N/A

If you're looking for a history lesson, pass on this one, but if you are looking for a great action movie coupled with a good storyline, above average acting and directing and a vague look into some of the characters and events of the southern campaigns of the Revolution, THE PATRIOT will not let you down.Though the movie lacks historical accuracy, it does draw from several different characters and events. For example, Benjamin Martin's (Mel Gibson) character, an ex-guerilla fighter turned semi-pacifist farmer, draws from at least three different characters; Francis Marion, Elijah Clark and Col. Daniel Morgan. The movie also rather loosely depicts the brilliant plan of Col. Morgan's used to soundly defeat the Brits at Cowpens, and those same tactics were later duplicated at Guilford Courthouse. Also in the movie, the British officer, Colonel Tavington is undoubtedly based upon Lt. Col Tarleton, the brutal British Greencoat who had no compunction about burning civilians out of their homes.If you can watch a movie without being overly critical of it's failure to breech the chasm of fact and fiction, and can simply enjoy the movie for it's entertainment value, then you will love this movie.

I'm glad I rented it and didn't see it in the theatres...If you know nothing of history, this film is great. It's really not completely terrible... but it's not *good*. The kids do a far better job acting than do some of the veterans. But you can't blame them, really, you can only blame a bad script. And why is the villain the most intriguing character in this movie? You'll have to read my ""So you'd like to Root for the Bad Guy"" movie list to answer that. =)Here's what we learn about the Rev War from this film:That ALL Brits soldiers wear nothing but Red coats, all Colonial soldiers wear blue, the Colonists spoke with nondescript ""American"" accents, that the French didn't arrive until after the battle at Cowpens (at the end, basically), Cowpens is a big dry field with niffty Mediaeval ruins, all armies fight in line formation, that ""militia"" means incompetent or rustic farmers with pitchforks, in battle you NEVER ever kill the Officers, that the high-ranking Officers didn't fight with the menial soldiers - they stood safely off to the side and watched, that blacks weren't slaves in the south (except to the rich), 18th C. Colonial women wore French style sacback dresses, married women ran around without matron caps, widows didn't wear black, and that unmarried men and women could shnog each other on the street or on the beach without their parents or anyone else protesting. Sounds good, right?Good GRIEF! Did Rodat and Emmerich REALLY think the American audience was SO stupid that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a British and a Colonial soldier? And that we wouldn't remember the most major events from our American History classes? That we wouldn't be able to guess that when the ""good"" (Boring) characters were getting shot at by a handsome bloke on a beautiful horse that HE must be the baddie?Boo to the Smithsonian society for even helping this terrible ""Hollywood History"". They should not be proud. They should hang their heads in shame for the inaccuracies they committed against history. ""Accurate down to the Buttons"", my butt.Here's a sum up of all the faux-pax committed in this film, so you can feel smug and intellectually snobby whilst watching it:*Widows wore black - Charlotte Selton does not. ever. I didn't know she was MARRIED the first time I saw this film!*Colonial women did NOT wear Sackback gowns. (Hell, Brits didn't for the longest time, either! that would be a Continental fashion. Everybody say: ""Continental""...)*Militia means: Fully. Trained. Mobile. Army. Lesser in prestige. Not skill. Militia does NOT mean: incompetent rustics with brands and torches. This is in contrast to: Regular Army. (At least they got that right)*British Uniform Colours: Red. Blue. Green (Tavington: GREEN Dragns). WHITE ""spray-on"" pants. Black boots. Nice hats. Mostly Tricornes.*Blacks (African Americans) did NOT make Gullah camps on beaches. They would have been in the Mtns.*Blacks were NOT freed men. No matter how nice their masters.*Mens' wigs were NICE. Not shoddy. Most all men wore wigs. As did the ladies.*Young ladies (Anne) did not talk sauce to their elders or betters*You do not refer to people by first name, unless it's your immediate family, or very intimate friends.*You did not need to always call your father ""father"". Papa and Pa worked then, too.*Bedrooms were UPstairs.*They did not Troop the Colours when on the battle field.*General Cornwallis was not nearly the old fop he is here portrayed as, but was younger than Mel Gibson by the time of the Rev War, and was beloved by his men because he fought alongside them, down on the field, in the gritty mayhem of war. Go Cornwallis.*AND, British Great Danes' ears were and are not propped like modern-day American ones are. Their ears stay floppy. Cute doggies. Nice doggies.Sadly, this film falls short of greatness and even coming close to semi-accurate history, for all the above listed reasons and so much more (namely that the main characters were boring, 2D fluff about whom we didn't care, even when they died).So, kids, remember: to avoid looking like a loser, pay attention in history classes! That way, if you ever become a filmmaker, you can avoid the major pitfalls of this movie!Oh well.

The film is just one clich&eacute; after another, cloaked in huge spectacle and scenography (which is in itself a clich&eacute;). Five minutes into the film, you'll allready have figured out where things are gonna end as well as all the major twists and turns in the plot. The characters in the film are two dimensional. I just love the fact (from a sarcastic point of view) that all Americans are portrayed as great guys, while foreigners are dirtbags; Even the French, whom the Americans would never have won the war without, are bad guys in this film. Plus, there's also the problem with Mel Gibson's character and his &quot;free workers&quot;. This is just plain stupid. The only reason this made it into the scripts is because the producers were afraid to offend anybody, and that could mean less money at the box office (and that's pretty much what Hollywood is all about). If the filmmakers had made it so that Gibson's character had kept slaves, then they could have made a point out of the patriot's desire for freedom versus their inability to see the slaves' desire for freedom.

At the end, it's just another good vs. evil action flick w a loosely held-to period setting to make it seem different and realistic.  Some people complained about the brutal violence in the movie.

557108,AQBHNE9AP6YBP,B00004XPPG,NostalgiaVHS,"[0, 0]","The Patriot is a film that came out a year too early. Imagine if this film had come out after September 11th, when American pride was at its all time high. It would've been bigger than Titanic! People would've been lining up around the block to see Mel Gibson fight for our country's freedom. It would've been considered the most inspirational film of all time, a masterpiece.Instead, The Patriot is considered by many to be an over-indulgent exercise in Hollywood commercialism that contains little in the way of historical accuracy and even less in the way of originality. I say: bullocks to that! The Patriot is, to me, anyway, a fantastic historical action/drama, and even though it has its sappy, melodramatic scenes, it's still very enjoyable and entertaining.Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a widower and wealthy plantation owner in the South with a large family, including his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger). Eventually, the Revolutionary War manages to find its way into Martin's backyard, and his house is burned by the evil General Tavington, a delightfully evil villain who's general insanity is matched only by Adolf Hitler. In addition, Tavington kills Martin's second oldest son, who, in all honesty, kinda deserves it (when Tavington says 'Stupid boy!', I agree.)Anyway, Mel Gibson goes on a Rambo-esque rampage against British troops, the joins the Continental army as the leader of a militia. With his rag-tag team of gentle farmers and hard boiled brutes, Martin causes severe devastation the British supply lines, including one awesome scene in which they pop out from tall grass and shoot the s*** out of the British redcoats.This movie has a lot of action, which is why I consider it to be an action movie above all else. It's essentially just a standard revenge story set in a different time period (much like Braveheart). Mel Gibson is pretty cool, as usual, and his character is actually kinda deep (for an action movie, anyway). Heath Ledger is also pretty good, but rather dull. He has almost no personality, and his supposed 'love interest' is boring and has no influence on the actual plot. It should've been left on the cutting room floor.The character of Tavington is evil to an insanely exaggerated degree. Was it necessary to make him so damn evil? His evil reaches Nazi-like proportions, perhaps even worse. He is a gnarly man indeed, and makes for a great villain, as long as you can get past his totally exaggerated behavior.The battle scenes in the film are awesome. The costumes look great (though rather inaccurate), and every combat scene is thrilling and well-executed. The final battle, in particular, is very exciting.The film contains so much emotionally exploitative moments it would make Terms Of Endearment jealous. Everything is so melodramatic and corny, but so aweome at the same time. My absolute part of the film is near the end, when Mel Gibson rides into battle carrying an American flag and all the soldiers wave their hats in the air triumphantly. It's an empowering scene, and its cheesier than Rosie O'donell's butt-crack.The music in the film, composed by the legendary John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) is one of my favorite things about the film. The score is so epic. It's incredible, there's nothing more to say, it pretty much makes the film.One of the many complaints about the film is its apparent skimming over of the many 'racial' issues going on at the time. I wonder if that's such a bad thing. Let me explain: in order to properly explore such delicate themes and issues, the film would have to dedicate a lot of time to it, and at over two and a half hours, the film is long enough as it is. So, the only options are to A.) cover it half-assingly, or B.) ignore it and get on with the action! I choose B.While certainly not perfect, The Patriot is a very enjoyable film with great action, great music, and great direction (yes, for the first time ever, I liked Roland Emmrich's direction).

The battle scenes struck me as the mythical guerilla minute man exposes, which indeed happened but not the way nor to the extent Mel envisions. I think it is a shame when directors have to make history what they would prefer it to have been, rather than display it for what it was.

It doesn't matter too much to me if it is not correct, I just enjoy an excellent movie.  The Patriot is an excellent movie because of its perfect storyline, flawless acting, and authentic uniforms.The story starts with Benjamin Martin and his family at their house in South Carolina.  They travel to Charleston to see how the levy to allow South Carolina to go to war against the British turns out.  Benjamin, having seen much of war, is against the levy.  When the levy passes, his oldest son, Gabriel, signs up against his father's wishes.  Eventually, Benjamin is dragged into the war as his family becomes involved.  He begins a guerrilla war with great effectivness.  The story heads out from there and can get very sad at points, but it is definately well written.The acting done by Mel Gibson (Benjamin Martin), Gabriel Martin (Heath Ledger), and many others is absolutely flawless.  They say their lines in a very convincing way.  I have not noticed a single slip-up by any of the cast.The detail made to the uniforms and weapons is fantastic.  The British uniforms are well detailed along with the muskets.  The Colonials uniforms are also highly detailed and look authentic.

However, there were parts of this story that were very disconcerting, e.g. the burning of the church. Now, we all know this didn't happen, but movies make history so &quot;alive&quot; that we tend to put a great deal of stock and feeling into what we see on the screen. This scene really sickened me, especially when I knew it didn't happen. The development of the character of Tavington, however, I believe was probably right on. Banstre Tarleton was despicable. There were some very nice visual spots in the movie, e.g. Charleston. I think Roland Emmerich used far too many shots where the soldiers were shot and it seemed like the camera was in the &quot;right place at the right moment&quot; to catch the blood spurt.

The victory may take a long while, but eventually the colonizers will get sick of fighting a foreign populace who hate them.The second lesson is broader: people fighting for the liberation of their own country from outside oppressors are motivated.  They have everything to gain and everything to lose.The third lesson is related to the other two: the vicious methods of the outside powers--targeting civilians intentionally or indiscriminately, devastating the landscape--will so alienate the people that they will throw in behind the insurgents, making the triumph of the freedom-fighters well-nigh inevitable.The acting is good, the human element (though brief) is moving, the scenery is spectacular.As with all war movies, women get short shrift.

I admire Randall Wallace's writing--though Man in the Iron Mask, his artful take on Dumas's work, was much better than Braveheart--but he relied, i think, too much on expectation and people's wishes (especially Marion Braidfute's character, who was really only one of Wallace's many female acquaintances).  The movie set a tone for epics, and too many people use it as a criterion for their film ethics.The Patriot is a much more personal movie, revolving around a man of simple entertainments and a family(chair-building).  The wit in the writing, I think, merited Academy Awards.  But people are, I'm afraid to say, idiots many a time.  I see no relation to Braveheart, lest it be in the nature of the conflicts.  But that is war, and it must be so.  The villain was extreme, but provides a nice foil to Benjamin.Forgive my severity.  But I grow weary of empty plots and lies in movies.  Andrew de Moray, in truth, was Wallace's greatest ally--almost as great as Wallace himself.  And the Bruce, king of scots, was the one with the leprosy.  Still, Braveheart perseveres.

While it is free of anachronistic phrases, it also doesn't contain lot of faux eighteenth century-speak. It is therefore clear and easy to follow, while still having a flavor of the revolutionary period. This is an excellent choice. The script plays as natural, and doesn't call undue attention to itself. It is a great compliment to say that a script &quot;wasn't there,&quot; in the sense that the words are so natural, they really seem to come right from the characters. This is the case here.Most importantly, the footage of the minutemen makes clear why a ragtag army of rebels could defeat the British bulwark. The sniper attacks of the minutemen-- not considered &quot;honorable&quot; at the time-- were what really won the war.

Afterall, Roland Emmerich was the brain behind such wondrous projects as Godzilla (1998) and Universal Soldier. Hoo boy. That said, it's quite amazing that the thing manages to come off as well as it does. The main reason it does is Jason Isaacs, who plays William Tavington, the sleazy British colonel who serves as Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson)'s nemesis. (Did Isaacs look familiar to you? He delivered the immortal &quot;C minus&quot; line in Armageddon-- one of the few lines in that movie that made it worth watching.)While this film is most certainly a Mel Gibson vehicle, he seems somewhat pale here, almsot as if he were bored with the thing for a good deal of the shooting. The minor characters, however, make up for that in many cases. Along with Isaacs, excellent performances are turned in by Heath Ledger, Gregory Smith, and the always-underrated Jay Arlen Jones (hey, I had to find a way to get a Night of the Creeps reference in here somewhere!).Still, it ain't Braveheart.

It tries to pose itself as an epic, yet the story is shallow and characters superficial and 2-dimensional. You want to cheer for Gibson's character, Ben Martin, but he's certainly not as &quot;cheerable&quot; as Porter (Payback). You never learn much about the human element or drama because everyone serves as a stereotype (Slave, Reverend, The Loyalist, etc) and these characters are introduced and used only as needed. There could have been some wonderful opportunities to expand the Loyalist character (played by Adam Baldwin), yet all we see is 10 seconds of him troubling over whether he should set fire to the church.While Saving Private Ryan accurately (my guess -- how would I really know?) relentlessly portrayed the acute grimness of war with a semi-objective documentary style feel, and felt cold as a result, The Patriot is saddled by the two: Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, of Independence Day.

The props and cosumes were, of course, changed and the issues modified to tie in with the concerns of the period but other than that, the movies were roughly interchangable.The very simple story was tediously overstated again and again. The backstory -- Benjamin Martin's dark side -- was also overstated and then it wasn't even used in the film's gory climax. The movie was watchable and entertaining, but  can't see it becoming a classic. In the end, it's really just another movie.Even though the movies have almost nothing in common, I can't help but compare &quot;The Patriot&quot; to one of my favorite period films, &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; which I can watch multiple times and from which I still get new information and entertainment.Amazon's own reviewer Jeff Shannon hit the nail squarely on the head when he opens with: &quot;Aimed directly at a mainstream audience, The Patriot qualifies as respectable entertainment, but anyone expecting a definitive drama about the American Revolution should look elsewhere.&quot; I would have to say that I agree with that assessment just about 100%.",3,Very High production values; Just Average screenplay.,973900800,"11 11, 2000",2000,1181,"['was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'movie', 'tastes', 'props', 'cosumes', 'were', 'course', 'changed', 'issues', 'modified', 'tie', 'concerns', 'period', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'roughly', 'interchangable.The', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'was', 'tediously', 'overstated', 'again', 'again', 'backstory', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'dark', 'side', 'was', 'also', 'overstated', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'used', 'film', 'gory', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'becoming', 'classic', 'end', 'really', 'just', 'movie.Even', 'movies', 'have', 'almost', 'nothing', 'common', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'one', 'favorite', 'period', 'films', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'can', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'still', 'get', 'new', 'information', 'entertainment.Amazon', 'own', 'reviewer', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'hit', 'nail', 'squarely', 'head', 'when', 'quot', 'Aimed', 'directly', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'Patriot', 'qualifies', 'respectable', 'entertainment', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'definitive', 'drama', 'American', 'Revolution', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere.', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'agree', 'assessment', 'just', 'about', '100', '%']",N/A
557155,A1JIPFV4OL520T,B00004XPPG,Robert Wynkoop,"[11, 20]","This is really an amazing film when viewed against modern American culture.  The message of the film is simple- Liberty is a costly thing.  Our hero, Benjamin Martin, is the reluctant warrior; he is haunted by the sins of his youth.  As the American colonies slide inexorably towards war against Britain he refuses to commit himself or his sons to war.  He knows only too well that such a war will not be fought on the frontier, but in their cities and farms- that the price of such a war would be costly indeed. As a father he decides to put his family above his principles.  King George is indeed unjust and the British army is warring against the American people, but our hero will not fight.  He may protest, he may write letters, but he will not fight- That is, until the war found him. His eldest son was captured and unjustly arrested as a spy and condemned to hang, another son was brutally murdered.Throughout the movie, war is characterized as a bloody and brutal thing.  Both sides were guilty of the excesses of war . . . both sides routinely shot prisoners and slaughtered those who tried to surrender.  The first battle scene ends with the Mel Gibson character killing a fleeing British soldier and them mashing the dead soldier's head to a pulp.  The scene where a whole village is barricaded within a church and then the building set ablaze was heart breaking.  Yet, despite the brutality, there are men on both sides of the conflict who protest the excesses but who could not stop them.  War, as Sherman said, is hell.Compare this to the feminization of American culture in the post Vietnam age.  Liberty is a masculine trait, fairness if a feminine trait.  (Stay with me now. . . read my argument before you vote no.  If I make sense, even if you do not agree with me, give this review a positive vote for making a good argument. If this argument is utter nonsense, feel free to vote no.) Liberty is inherently unfair. In a free society some will succeed others will fail.  Some will gain wealth, others will remain poor.  Liberty awards the ambitious, the intelligent, and the risk takers.  On the other hand, those who are not particularly ambitious, those who may lack intelligence and those who prefer security to risk, usually do not succeed as well in a free society.The feminine trait of fairness sees this as unjust.  A mother, who raises children, sees to it that her children are treated fairly by those inside and outside of the family.  Every child knows that a winning argument with mom is ""That isn't fair.""  Since women have the primary child care role in our society (I am not saying that this is right or wrong, but that it is simply the way things are), they tend to value security over liberty.  Their concern, and rightly so, is the feeding and care of their children.  The Mel Gibson character assumed this role after the death of his wife.  He became the protector of his children- security became more important than liberty. After all, who could blame him; he had a family to care for. It is only after the brutal death of his son, that he becomes the warrior.Compare this to our modern view of the military since Vietnam.  Every brutality of war, that is committed by American troops is broadcasted and condemned by the American media.  As I write this, some poor solider is being disciplined for kicking a copy of the Koran (by the way, where was the outrage by the American press at the desecration of the Church of the Nativity when Palestinians occupied it a couple of years ago and  used the pages of the New Testament as toilet paper?. . . but I guess that doesn't matter). The American press and many in our culture see the United States, and the American military in particular as not being fair. . . they are afraid that the conduct of our troops will inflame the passion of the Moslem world.  They want our troops to fight fair. . . even if it means that they don't shoot first.  They can shoot an enemy combatant, but not too many times. . . they must show restraint . .  . It comes down to this- they see the use of force by the American military as inheritably unfair.  Americans they say must become more understanding of other cultures.  This is nothing more than the feminization  and destruction of the American culture.Some may say that this is well and good, the natural course of societal evolution.  They believe that the world will be a better, safer and fairer place when we adopt the feminine virtues of fairness and security.  Perhaps.  But as a society looses the ability to defend itself, when the middle class no longer supports the military by encouraging their sons to become soldiers, when safety, security and fairness become the dominate values of a society, that society will no longer fight for it's freedom.  And history has repeatedly proven that leaner, hungrier, peoples will raise up.  And when they do, they will not be concerned about fairness and security.  Freedom is a decidedly masculine virtue and every society that has not fought for its liberty loses it.  Think about it.",4,The price of liberty and the feminization of our culture,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,5064,"['really', 'amazing', 'film', 'when', 'viewed', 'modern', 'American', 'culture', 'message', 'film', 'simple-', 'Liberty', 'costly', 'thing', 'hero', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'reluctant', 'warrior', 'haunted', 'sins', 'youth', 'American', 'colonies', 'slide', 'inexorably', 'towards', 'war', 'Britain', 'commit', 'sons', 'war', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'war', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'fought', 'frontier', 'cities', 'farms-', 'price', 'such', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'costly', 'indeed', 'father', 'put', 'family', 'principles', 'King', 'George', 'indeed', 'unjust', 'British', 'army', 'warring', 'American', 'people', 'hero', 'will', 'not', 'fight', 'may', 'protest', 'may', 'write', 'letters', 'will', 'not', 'fight-', 'war', 'found', 'eldest', 'son', 'was', 'captured', 'unjustly', 'arrested', 'spy', 'condemned', 'hang', 'son', 'was', 'brutally', 'movie', 'war', 'characterized', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'thing', 'sides', 'were', 'guilty', 'excesses', 'war', 'sides', 'routinely', 'shot', 'prisoners', 'slaughtered', 'who', 'tried', 'surrender', 'first', 'battle', 'scene', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'killing', 'fleeing', 'British', 'soldier', 'mashing', 'dead', 'soldier', 'head', 'pulp', 'scene', 'where', 'whole', 'village', 'barricaded', 'church', 'then', 'building', 'set', 'ablaze', 'was', 'heart', 'breaking', 'brutality', 'are', 'men', 'sides', 'conflict', 'who', 'protest', 'excesses', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'War', 'Sherman', 'said', 'hell.Compare', 'feminization', 'American', 'culture', 'post', 'Vietnam', 'age', 'Liberty', 'masculine', 'trait', 'fairness', 'feminine', 'trait', 'Stay', 'now', 'read', 'argument', 'vote', 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'give', 'review', 'positive', 'vote', 'making', 'good', 'argument', 'argument', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'feel', 'free', 'vote', 'Liberty', 'inherently', 'unfair', 'free', 'society', 'will', 'succeed', 'others', 'will', 'fail', 'will', 'gain', 'wealth', 'others', 'will', 'remain', 'poor', 'Liberty', 'ambitious', 'intelligent', 'risk', 'takers', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'ambitious', 'who', 'may', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'who', 'prefer', 'security', 'risk', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'free', 'society.The', 'feminine', 'trait', 'fairness', 'sees', 'unjust', 'mother', 'who', 'children', 'children', 'are', 'treated', 'fairly', 'family', 'child', 'winning', 'argument', 'mom', ""n't"", 'fair', 'women', 'have', 'primary', 'child', 'care', 'role', 'society', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'right', 'wrong', 'simply', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'tend', 'value', 'security', 'liberty', 'concern', 'rightly', 'so', 'feeding', 'care', 'children', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'assumed', 'role', 'death', 'wife', 'became', 'protector', 'children-', 'security', 'became', 'more', 'important', 'liberty', 'who', 'could', 'blame', 'had', 'family', 'care', 'only', 'brutal', 'death', 'son', 'warrior.Compare', 'modern', 'view', 'military', 'Vietnam', 'Every', 'brutality', 'war', 'committed', 'American', 'troops', 'broadcasted', 'condemned', 'American', 'media', 'write', 'poor', 'solider', 'being', 'disciplined', 'kicking', 'copy', 'Koran', 'way', 'where', 'was', 'outrage', 'American', 'press', 'desecration', 'Church', 'Nativity', 'when', 'Palestinians', 'occupied', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'used', 'pages', 'New', 'Testament', 'toilet', 'paper', 'guess', ""n't"", 'matter', 'American', 'press', 'many', 'culture', 'see', 'United', 'States', 'American', 'military', 'particular', 'not', 'being', 'fair', 'are', 'afraid', 'conduct', 'troops', 'will', 'inflame', 'passion', 'Moslem', 'world', 'want', 'troops', 'fight', 'fair', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'first', 'can', 'shoot', 'enemy', 'combatant', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'must', 'show', 'restraint', 'down', 'this-', 'see', 'use', 'force', 'American', 'military', 'inheritably', 'unfair', 'Americans', 'say', 'must', 'become', 'more', 'understanding', 'other', 'cultures', 'nothing', 'more', 'feminization', 'destruction', 'American', 'culture.Some', 'may', 'say', 'well', 'good', 'natural', 'course', 'societal', 'evolution', 'believe', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'safer', 'fairer', 'place', 'when', 'adopt', 'feminine', 'virtues', 'fairness', 'security', 'Perhaps', 'society', 'ability', 'defend', 'when', 'middle', 'class', 'no', 'longer', 'military', 'encouraging', 'sons', 'become', 'soldiers', 'when', 'safety', 'security', 'fairness', 'become', 'dominate', 'values', 'society', 'society', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'fight', 'freedom', 'history', 'repeatedly', 'proven', 'leaner', 'hungrier', 'peoples', 'will', 'raise', 'up', 'when', 'do', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'concerned', 'fairness', 'security', 'Freedom', 'decidedly', 'masculine', 'virtue', 'society', 'not', 'fought', 'liberty', 'Think']",N/A

Indeed, by the middle of the movie, I was rooting for evil Colonel Tavington to wipe out Benjamin Martin and his passel of annoyingly cute children.Jason Isaacs as Colonel Tavington is the best thing about this film. He takes a two dimensional, cartoon villain and humanizes him, giving Tavington both depth and energy. A good example of an actor rising above his material. In fact, the only reason I would recommend the DVD over the VHS version is that the DVD contains extra Tavington scenes which were cut from the movie (click under Gabriel's gun on the Special Features page to access them).Tom Wilkinson also gives a very textured performance as Lord Cornwallis.The cinematography is beautiful and the battle scenes well-staged, but the film is marred by a simplistic, ham-handed, overly melodramatic script.

Unfortunately with mel Gibson at the helm, all we get is a silly Brave Heart set in the American Revolution. This is too bad, as the sets and costumes are quite well done, but all is for naught as we have all the mel gibson cliches of showing the British too be either arrogant buffoons, or nasty, petty killers.  The revenge element in todays movies seems to be a Hollywood vehicle to dumb down historical content for the American viewer.  This is unfortunate as i believe the American public could handle a more complex film and plot, but Hollywood does not think we can, so we get the same contrived stuff served up to us over and over again.  The battle scenes, while impressive, are exaggerated.  The numbers involved are too large. The Southern battles were fought with a few thousand on each side, and the Americans generally outnumbered the British and usually lost!  Cornwallis was not the silly parody we see here, but one of the few daring and aggressive generals the British had. Washington rightly feared him because of the defeats he had administered to him several times.  And the travasty of Lord Tavington burning innocent colonials in their church is a take off on the Nazi's in WW2!  It has no place in this period!  Such scenes like this show how immature and inbalanced the movie producers were in this film.  Tavington is a corruption of Banastere Tarleton, the hard-ridding Britsih dragoon officer, who was controversial in some of his actions, but not a cold-blooded maniac-nazi that we have here, and of course mel has to get him in the end!

557162,AKELS44ECAVEB,B00004XPPG,"Rogue Fox ""Rogue""","[4, 7]","When I first watched the movie, I had a blast watching it. Though as time passed I plainly got bored with it, and got to the point of not watching it completely. Yes, I still watch it every once in awhile. From the very begging I could see that this was based on Hollywood and definitly not History. There are many flaws, and unforgiving mistakes in the movie. I know, that people are looking for an action movie .... not a History Channel... documentary, but still Ron Emmerich( the director) may have gotten to carried away.First, of all I see that Emmerich added the old good vs. evil hollywood trick, which is of course very common. Really, the British people were and still aren't evil,.... gosh. If you look at the political matters I say that both the Colonists and British are at fault, with niether side being the good guy,at in fact only the British army offered freedom to slaves that served. George Washington, was a man of the era being a slave owner himself in fact, and I'm not saying he's a bad person either. Also the first American flag shown in the movie wasn't even created until, after the war. The French weren't helping us at all by the way; they in fact were using us so that they could gain an upper edge in the battle of the New World colonies. They also wanted their lands on the Frointer back too, that they lost in the French Indian War. THe French really never cared who one, as long as they got something out of the whole deal.Since, I gave you a brief history I will explain some other flaws that really bugged me. For example, Emmerich didn't do his homework because, the colonists just didn't kill 700 red coats close range, more like 1000.... if you actually stayed awake during History class.... ok that was history related as well, but now I will put that whole history thing behind me. The setting just didn't feel realistic, and the acting in my opinion was plainly weak... with only Mel Gibson pulling through with a good performance. I don't really know why they picked Mel Gibson for the role, but he kinda impressed me. Heath Ledger put in a respectable performance, but he did better in ""Knight's Tale""!!! It's in fact like ""A Knight's Tale"" being a great action movie, but is nothing special with a few flaws here and there. Both the movies are fun to watch but, are not masterpieces by any means.There were though some nice visuals, and battles. There was still something missing. The battles were lacking, just compare the scenes of Lord of the Rings and this and you'll see what I mean. True there is no way you can actually compare the two. My point is that they sholud have made the battles more realistic and intense. You can tell alot of the stuff is computer animated. The movie did depict the milita in realistic way, but really it's just hard for me to picture Mel Gibson as the so called leader. Yet, this movie does give credit to the people who really helped us gain the upper edge the milita. The movie also did give you the idea of what the patriots gave for freedom and liberty. This movie you can say is historical fiction not propoganda Hollywood. Besides that this is still a pretty good action movie, but something you have to go buy.The movie is just to bland and flawed for me to enjoy at times... yet it will be fun to watch at times. I myself wouldn't have bought this if I could do it all over again, but it's still something you should rent in the future, and maybe buy it if you like it. I say just go see something more innovative and something that hasn't been done before.Overall, I will give this movie an 3/5,... pretty good historical fiction movie, but nothing impressive!!!-Rogue Fox ""rogue""REVIEW MASTER... want help or buying advice be free to check out my other reviews.",3,Hollywood Not History !!!!,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,3753,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'time', 'passed', 'plainly', 'got', 'bored', 'got', 'point', 'not', 'watching', 'completely', 'Yes', 'still', 'watch', 'once', 'awhile', 'very', 'begging', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'based', 'Hollywood', 'definitly', 'not', 'History', 'are', 'many', 'flaws', 'unforgiving', 'mistakes', 'movie', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'still', 'Ron', 'Emmerich', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'carried', 'away.First', 'see', 'Emmerich', 'added', 'old', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'hollywood', 'trick', 'course', 'very', 'common', 'Really', 'British', 'people', 'were', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'evil', 'gosh', 'look', 'political', 'matters', 'say', 'Colonists', 'British', 'are', 'fault', 'side', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'fact', 'only', 'British', 'army', 'offered', 'freedom', 'slaves', 'served', 'George', 'Washington', 'was', 'man', 'era', 'being', 'slave', 'owner', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'person', 'Also', 'first', 'American', 'flag', 'shown', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'created', 'war', 'French', 'were', ""n't"", 'helping', 'way', 'fact', 'were', 'using', 'could', 'gain', 'upper', 'edge', 'battle', 'New', 'World', 'colonies', 'also', 'wanted', 'lands', 'Frointer', 'back', 'too', 'lost', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'THe', 'French', 'really', 'never', 'cared', 'who', 'one', 'as', 'long', 'got', 'something', 'whole', 'deal.Since', 'gave', 'brief', 'history', 'will', 'explain', 'other', 'flaws', 'really', 'bugged', 'example', 'Emmerich', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework', 'colonists', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', '700', 'red', 'coats', 'close', 'range', 'more', '1000', 'actually', 'stayed', 'awake', 'History', 'class', 'was', 'history', 'related', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'will', 'put', 'whole', 'history', 'thing', 'setting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'realistic', 'acting', 'opinion', 'was', 'plainly', 'weak', 'only', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'pulling', 'good', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'picked', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'role', 'impressed', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'put', 'respectable', 'performance', 'did', 'better', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'fact', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'being', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'nothing', 'special', 'few', 'flaws', 'here', 'there', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'not', 'masterpieces', 'means.There', 'were', 'nice', 'visuals', 'battles', 'was', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'battles', 'were', 'lacking', 'just', 'compare', 'scenes', 'Lord', 'Rings', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'True', 'way', 'can', 'actually', 'compare', 'two', 'point', 'sholud', 'have', 'made', 'battles', 'more', 'realistic', 'intense', 'can', 'tell', 'alot', 'stuff', 'computer', 'animated', 'movie', 'did', 'depict', 'milita', 'realistic', 'way', 'really', 'just', 'hard', 'picture', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'so', 'called', 'leader', 'movie', 'give', 'credit', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'helped', 'gain', 'upper', 'edge', 'milita', 'movie', 'also', 'did', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'patriots', 'gave', 'freedom', 'liberty', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'historical', 'fiction', 'not', 'propoganda', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'something', 'have', 'go', 'buy.The', 'movie', 'just', 'bland', 'flawed', 'enjoy', 'times', 'yet', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'times', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'could', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'still', 'something', 'should', 'rent', 'future', 'maybe', 'buy', 'like', 'say', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'something', 'more', 'innovative', 'something', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before.Overall', 'will', 'give', 'movie', '3/5', 'pretty', 'good', 'historical', 'fiction', 'movie', 'nothing', 'impressive', '-Rogue', 'Fox', 'rogue', 'REVIEW', 'MASTER', 'want', 'help', 'buying', 'advice', 'be', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'reviews']",N/A
557163,A3TOQAMJURAYFC,B00004XPPG,Roland Dark,"[2, 2]","""The Patriot"" is a fictional Revolutionary War almost-epic about an ardent pacifist (Mel Gibson) doing a 180 after his young son is murdered by a sadistic British officer (Jason Isaacs). Accompanied by his idealistic oldest son (Heath Ledger) and a motley militia of Yankee Doodles, Gibson reinvents himself as ""The Ghost"", a one man army who makes mince meat out of British soldiers, and sets out to avenge his son's death, being a veritable thorn in the side of British hierarchy, in the process.While splendidly filmed and acted, ""The Patriot"" attempts to foist emotional manipulation on us as an epic story. Scene after scene, The Ghost's family and friends become the victim's of atrocites by the British officer Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs in a role that makes Ralph Feinnes portrayal of Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"" look like Mr. Rogers!). If it is not enough that one of his younger sons is callously murdered, we have to witness The Ghost's eldest son stabbed to death, and his son's beautiful young wife and innocent townspeople burned alive in a church.  The sole purpose of this carnage is to engender in the audience a strident hatred of Tavington, an effect that is both superficial and manipulative.  The film never gave me a sense of meaning.Do not expect ""The Patriot"" to be a history lesson, either. The film demonizes the British army, portraying them as nothing more than snobbish bad guys. And the watered down depiction of slavery is shameless.

557168,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00004XPPG,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 6]","Ben Martin (""Mel Gibson"") is a scarred vet of the French and Indian War who resists and then enters the revolutionary war in this movie that seems at times an update of  the superior ""Braveheart"".A happily settled widower in Carolina, Martin stays aloof of the revolutionary cause, mostly because of his distaste for any government (serving a tyrant 3000 miles away beats serving one ruling from down the block) but also because he's still haunted by the brutalities of the older war. The war comes to him, hot on the heels of his fiery son-turned Continental soldier. Although the British forces in the Carolinas are led by sage and otherwise humane general Cornwallis, the Tories' brutal side is embodied by one charachter - the sadistic Colonel Tavington. In his first confrontation with the colonel, Martin's eldest son is captured, while the youngest is cruelly shot. Martin joins the revolutionary effort, amassing a scraggly horde of swamp fighters who pick the redcoats off from behind trees while the Continentals' army struggles vainly out in the open against the superior might of the redcoats. The revolution's only hope is to keep the enemy forces in Carolina - which has numbers, weapons and Cornwallis on its side - from linking up to the British Army in NY and choking Washington into defeat. The French have promised a blockade and their own military support, but nothing materializes quickly. Martin doesn't play by British rules, refusing to line up his meager and swampy forces as cannon fodder for the British. Martin's early successes galvanize the Colonial's hopes, but also rouse the British, and soon invite more personal tragedy for Martin and his family. Col. Tavington doesn't play by the rules either. Realizing his military tactics (which include annihilating whole towns suspected of abetting the Continentals' guerrilas) will prevent him from returning to England, he sets on a path that will give him his own fiefdom in America (""let's talk about....Ohio""). With the Continental's position improving and becoming more desperate at the same time, the stage is set for a climactic battle where Martin will face Tavington and the might of the British Empire without a swamp to hide behind.Historically, the flick is suspect.  There are no rich slave owners (Martin's slaves were released and remain as his tenants), and white soldiers erase their prejudice against black patriots as soon as the two have shared a battle.  As for the flick's nominal villain, it's hard to take the evil Tavingotn at face value: were there as evil a character as Tavington fighting in the colonies, would the script have had to invent a fictional composite?""The Patriot"" follows ""Braveheart"" very closely, but the story does go its own direction at times, and there's more of a story to the bit players - tough guerrila soldiers who find themselves quite emotionally vulnerable when their families are victimized, or other white soldiers who learn that black soldiers can be just as valiant as themselves and should be free. The British aren't the uniformly snearing and evil crew that faced the scots in that older film. While patriotism is upfront, the film doesn't come off jingoistic.  Unlike ""Braveheart"", Gibson's character here tends to embody a cause more often than a person who just happens to be critical to the cause.

557173,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B00004XPPG,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[1, 5]","The 2000 summer film, ""The Patriot"" which I believe was in theatres appropiately on the 4th of July, stars Mel Gibson in the heroic role of Benjamin Martin, a father fighting for his family and his colony from the British enemy forces of General Cornwallis (played by Tom Wilkinson). The movie was directed by Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day, which, though science fiction blockbuster epic that it was, still maintained the 4th of July American patriotism theme much like this movie. Being entirely different from his usual blockbusters (Godzilla, Day After Tomorrow most recently) Emmerich immerses us into the historical period of early America in the 1770's, when the budding, newfound country was at war with Great Britain. The American Revolution was the first real war in America. The country was earning its independence and fighting for it in the most literal sense.Althoug the movie keeps its period piece/costume drama visuals, in the dialogue you can find traces of modernism. For example, in one scene, Mel Gibson sits with his wife and asks ""Can I sit here ?"" and she replies in comedy tone ""Hey it's a free country.. or that is it will be"". Much of Mel Gibson's own influence is in this movie. He did not direct this movie although he could have easily done so. The fighting scenes, the battles, the gunfights and the violence is very Mel Gibson in nature (he is after all responsible for such films as Braveheart). The portrayal of the British is of course biased since it's on the American side we're sympathezing with. Cornwallis is a man we love to hate-rude, arrogant and cruel. The other British in the film are also portrayed as very nasty. The message of patriotism, love of family and home is all quite strong here. But it does make a good film if you're into this period, if you want to see Mel Gibson doing a historic piece and as the hero which he always does so well in. Mel Gibson, though much older now, is still a great actor and provides much romantic/sex appeal.

It is not the fault  of Mel Gibson, although I would have prefered to see his efforts elsewhere  than this tepid Braveheart rehash. Can't blame the supporting actors, Heath  Ledger to T. Karyo to Chris Cooper.Where does the blame go? Clearly on  the shoulders of the most overrated director (ok Peter Hyams is a close  second) and producer team in Hollywood, Roland Emmerich and Dean  Devlin.My list of complaints are long for this film, but I will just  share a few.1st: One of my little rules, never build up a villian to  large, that whatever death comes to them, you are not satisfied. Moviegoers  love revenge, and when Col. Tavington finally meets his maker, it is both  hokey as heck, and completely unsatisfying.2nd: The film gives no sense  of Geography. It is near impossible to understand how far away towns are,  why people never bump into eachother, why the brittish will not search the  swamps, etc. Becasue of this, we feel no build of tension when we see any  of the Charaters riding along. Are they going to run itno each other?  Probibly not, but it would help to know how far things are from  eachother.3rd: Damnit, why do we have to have old glory as the rallying  point.

Henderson,"[4, 4]","Having just watched The Patriot and looked over a few of the previous reviews, let's get one thing out of the way---there are those who criticize this movie for not being a realistic vision of the American Revolution (artistic license, please) so they praise the story of a man and his family caught in war's whirlwind but really, this story is weak and extremely predictable right down to the showdown on the battlefield between Gibson and his sons' murderer.  There were so many moments when I laughed and said &quot;enough, already.&quot;  Are we to believe that a father would stand by while his firstborn son is led away to be hung while his secondborn son is shot and killed right in front of the whole family?  The smartest character here is little Susie who refuses to talk!  She's probably thinking &quot;I may be young but I WASN'T BORN LAST NIGHT!&quot;  And the scene at the aunt's house where everyone is hiding in the basement from the mean Brits --- COME ON, travel all that distance and not search the basement?  There are just too many unbelievable scenes here that, one on top of the other, make this an embarrassment.  Who wrote this crap?  On the other hand, no movie yet has captured this revolution with even a smidgen of historical accuracy so I give it 3 stars for trying.  Many people may think it stupid for opposing armies to face each other in open field and fire their weapons all at once but this was the way they often fought with the idea that whoever could reload faster might hold the field.  And Cornwallis' interview with Martin concerning &quot;gentleman's&quot; fighting tactics neatly summarizes 18th century warfare unbelievable as it may seem to modern eyes.  The hackneyed story and cliche-ridden details throw this effort off the track very early in the movie and by the end (and it doesn't come soon enough) you're left wondering what a picture with Tom Hanks instead of Aussie Mel Gibson would've looked like.

557201,A317595DBB9L8W,B00004XPPG,Stephen M. Long,"[6, 8]","This entertaining and inspiring film offers an insightful portrait of the era of the American Revolution, from the perspective of one family caught up in its effects and circumstances in South Carolina starting in 1776, then mostly 1780-81.  Mel Gibson portrays Benjamin Martin, a reluctant hero whose veteran war experiences have left him somewhat haunted.  Though a fictional person, his character is an amalgam of several real Patriots, including Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens, who rejoined the fight after their Plantations were burned by the British;  Brig. General Daniel Morgan, who employed militia as a decoy in battle like is portrayed in the film, and mostly Francis Marion (The Swamp Fox), known for surviving gruesome missions in the French and Indian War and his effective hit and run tactics in the Revolutionary War.  His likable rebel leader recruits locals into a militia and scores a few underdog successes disrupting the occupying British operations.The film is beautifully photographed and has a score composed by John Williams (Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan).  The careful attention to period language, names, clothing, and customs adds authenticity to the story.  The main antagonist is the snide and brutal British Colonel William Tavington, based on actual cavalry leader Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, who earned a fierce and ruthless reputation in battle in South Carolina.  There is much to show how the war affects the Martin family.  Young daughter Susan, sullen and almost mute after seeing her brother killed and their Plantation burned, at one point cries out to her father that she would say anything if it would keep him from going back to the fighting, in an almost heartbreaking scene.  Another memorable scene is where the Reverend Oliver (Rene Auberjonois) and Benjamin's son Gabriel Martin (Heath Ledger) attempt to call for the ethical treatment of prisoners when some surrendering British are shot in a chaotic battle skirmish, imploring ""We are better men than that!"" to his father and comrades.  Gabriel enters the local church at one point and he, with the help of his childhood friend Anne Howard's (Lisa Brenner) impassioned speech, rally the people to the defense of their town and country.The film has many engaging and entertaining action sequences, and these build toward a final battle, which is dramatically and graphically depicted.  The historical accuracy is not what it could be, but the story is told well, and captures the spirit of the Revolution in a memorable and inspiring way.  Note that it is 2 Australian Actors and a German Director bringing American Patriotism to life here, but they do such a good job, in a great film that is watchable and inspiring again and again.",4,Spirit of the American Revolution,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2737,"['entertaining', 'inspiring', 'film', 'offers', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'era', 'American', 'Revolution', 'perspective', 'one', 'family', 'caught', 'up', 'effects', 'circumstances', 'South', 'Carolina', 'starting', '1776', 'then', 'mostly', '1780-81', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'veteran', 'war', 'experiences', 'have', 'left', 'somewhat', 'haunted', 'fictional', 'person', 'character', 'amalgam', 'several', 'real', 'Patriots', 'including', 'Thomas', 'Sumter', 'Andrew', 'Pickens', 'who', 'rejoined', 'fight', 'Plantations', 'were', 'burned', 'British', 'Brig', 'General', 'Daniel', 'Morgan', 'who', 'employed', 'militia', 'decoy', 'battle', 'portrayed', 'film', 'mostly', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'known', 'surviving', 'gruesome', 'missions', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'effective', 'hit', 'run', 'tactics', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'likable', 'rebel', 'leader', 'locals', 'militia', 'few', 'underdog', 'successes', 'disrupting', 'occupying', 'British', 'operations.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'score', 'composed', 'John', 'Williams', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'careful', 'attention', 'period', 'language', 'names', 'clothing', 'customs', 'authenticity', 'story', 'main', 'antagonist', 'snide', 'brutal', 'British', 'Colonel', 'William', 'Tavington', 'based', 'actual', 'cavalry', 'leader', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Banastre', 'Tarleton', 'who', 'earned', 'fierce', 'ruthless', 'reputation', 'battle', 'South', 'Carolina', 'much', 'show', 'how', 'war', 'Martin', 'family', 'Young', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'sullen', 'almost', 'mute', 'seeing', 'brother', 'killed', 'Plantation', 'burned', 'one', 'point', 'out', 'father', 'would', 'say', 'anything', 'would', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'fighting', 'almost', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'memorable', 'scene', 'where', 'Reverend', 'Oliver', 'Rene', 'Auberjonois', 'Benjamin', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'Martin', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'attempt', 'call', 'ethical', 'treatment', 'prisoners', 'when', 'surrendering', 'British', 'are', 'shot', 'chaotic', 'battle', 'skirmish', 'imploring', 'are', 'better', 'men', 'father', 'comrades', 'Gabriel', 'local', 'church', 'one', 'point', 'help', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Anne', 'Howard', 'Lisa', 'Brenner', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'rally', 'people', 'defense', 'town', 'country.The', 'film', 'many', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'action', 'sequences', 'build', 'final', 'battle', 'dramatically', 'graphically', 'depicted', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'spirit', 'Revolution', 'memorable', 'inspiring', 'way', 'Note', '2', 'Australian', 'Actors', 'German', 'Director', 'bringing', 'American', 'Patriotism', 'life', 'here', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'great', 'film', 'watchable', 'inspiring', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Never mind the bad press he has gotten over the years, he has still produced a credible body of work and The Patriot is certainly up there with his best.  This movie has been around for quite some time so no 'spoiler alerts' need be necessary.  The quality of audio is excellent and the use of surrounds gets a well deserved workout which I always appreciate.  Using  lossless PCM I audio,  the shifts between the surrounds when appropriate were well blended and very distinct.  Really well done on that score.  The audio also was nicely balanced between the center channel dialogue and foley fx going to the sides or rears. Once you set your audio volume levels, you could just leave them alone.The video quality was also excellent shifting between cool color grading in evening and early morning scenes and either deeply saturated or, in a couple of cases, desaturated for daytime and battle sequences.  The extended portions included were seamlessly done, that is all except one short time lapse scene at the end of Gibson's attack on the troops leading his son, Heath Ledger, away to be hanged.  I suppose this one small scene would lend itself to the 'ghost' name that was applied to his character but it was the one scene I felt could have been left out.Deep blacks and strong details in the shadows support my contention for this high quality video rating as well as the lack of any grain or video noise or artificating.Bottom line,  glad I have it.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Patriot Extended Edition on Blu Ray,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1915,"['long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'one', 'often', 'forgotten', 'about', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'resume', 'up', 'Never', 'bad', 'press', 'gotten', 'years', 'still', 'produced', 'credible', 'body', 'work', 'Patriot', 'certainly', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'movie', 'been', 'quite', 'time', ""'spoiler"", 'alerts', 'need', 'be', 'necessary', 'quality', 'audio', 'excellent', 'use', 'surrounds', 'well', 'deserved', 'always', 'appreciate', 'Using', 'lossless', 'PCM', 'audio', 'shifts', 'surrounds', 'when', 'appropriate', 'were', 'well', 'blended', 'very', 'distinct', 'Really', 'well', 'done', 'score', 'audio', 'also', 'was', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'center', 'channel', 'dialogue', 'foley', 'fx', 'going', 'sides', 'rears', 'Once', 'set', 'audio', 'volume', 'levels', 'could', 'just', 'leave', 'alone.The', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'shifting', 'cool', 'color', 'grading', 'evening', 'early', 'morning', 'scenes', 'deeply', 'saturated', 'couple', 'cases', 'desaturated', 'daytime', 'battle', 'sequences', 'extended', 'portions', 'included', 'were', 'seamlessly', 'done', 'one', 'short', 'time', 'lapse', 'scene', 'end', 'Gibson', 'attack', 'troops', 'leading', 'son', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'away', 'be', 'hanged', 'suppose', 'one', 'small', 'scene', 'would', 'lend', ""'ghost"", 'name', 'was', 'applied', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out.Deep', 'blacks', 'strong', 'details', 'shadows', 'support', 'contention', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'rating', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'grain', 'video', 'noise', 'artificating.Bottom', 'line', 'glad', 'have', 'it.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

A lot of the battle scenes in `The Patriot' reminded me of the ones in `Mohicans'.  Overall a very entertaining epic. This isn't a movie about the war, but a movie about revenge that happens to occur during the war. Very much like `Braveheart' it that respect. The commentary was okay, but not as interesting as I had hoped. The director and producer did point out some interesting little known facts about the war. The featurettes where decent and combined would make a nice little documentary. It was surprising to learn how many of the effects where digital. In the commentary they refer to some scenes that where cut and/or outtakes. It would have been nice to have these included. If you like the above-mentioned movies you will probably enjoy this movie.

557205,A2QW2V285U824L,B00004XPPG,"Steven Bailey ""Cinemaven""","[1, 1]","What is it about American wars that brings the best out of otherwise trivial filmmakers? Ten years ago, the glorious Glory came from &quot;thirtysomething&quot; creator Edward Zwick. Now, Godzilla's Roland Emmerich, about the last director from whom we could expect full-bodied characters, brings us The Patriot--in every sense of the word, the most beautiful movie of its year.Part of the credit should probably go to screenwriter Robert Rodat who, as Saving Private Ryan proved, surely knows which patriotic buttons to push. Whoever should be credited, there's not a false move in this rousing three-hour tribute to American spirit. When they say &quot;They don't make 'em like that anymore,&quot; point to this one as an example of how it can still be done.And who knew Mel Gibson still had any actorism left in him? As Benjamin Martin, a reluctant war veteran who is finally moved to fight in the Revolutionary War when a redcoat kills one of his sons, Gibson sheds his familiar love-me mannerisms like an old winter coat. He never relies on cutesy tics, and not once does he strike a false note. His character elicits laughter, tears, and bloodshed, and for the first time in years, Gibson emotes an honest-to-gosh person on the screen.The movie's basic point--stated outright by Martin early on in the story--is that the Revolutionary War was won by wily militiamen who served as a direct counterpoint to the straight-on British manner of battle. But that's about the only thing in the movie which is stated so blatantly. The dialogue, rather than being laden with jingoism, is appropriately sparse, letting the movie's considerable action tell the story. And as such, this movie is a perfect argument against gratuitous movie violence (despite its R rating)--it shows the devastating effects of war (Martin loses a great deal of his family, one by one) and yet doesn't linger on its horrific effects.Gibson's magnificent underplaying and Rodat's spare screenplay seem to have invigorated the rest of the cast as well. Everyone from Jason Isaacs (the British colonel with a bug up himself about Martin) to Tom Wilkinson (terrific as British warlord Gen. Cornwallis) to Trevor Morgan (the actory smart-aleck in The Sixth Sense) as one of Martin's sons, seem just as juiced up as Gibson is.I haven't told a great deal about the plot, have I? (I haven't even touched upon Caleb Deschanel's beautiful cinematography, or John Williams' best movie score since E.T.) And this is as it should be. Please just trust that you should devote nearly three hours to one of the most perfectly realized movie visions you're likely to see for a long, long time.The Patriot is rated R, mostly for very graphic violence, though in context, a PG-13 would be far more appropriate. Its only dramatic effect is to get kids talking about the story, an opportunity that I'd imagine most history teachers and parents would welcome.",5,The Patriot a perfect Fourth of July rouser,994118400,"07 3, 2001",2001,2911,"['What', 'American', 'wars', 'best', 'otherwise', 'trivial', 'filmmakers', 'Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'glorious', 'Glory', 'came', 'quot', 'thirtysomething', 'quot', 'creator', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Now', 'Godzilla', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'last', 'director', 'whom', 'could', 'expect', 'full-bodied', 'characters', 'Patriot', 'sense', 'word', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'year.Part', 'credit', 'should', 'probably', 'go', 'screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Rodat', 'who', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'proved', 'surely', 'patriotic', 'buttons', 'push', 'Whoever', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'not', 'false', 'move', 'rousing', 'three-hour', 'tribute', 'American', 'spirit', 'When', 'say', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'anymore', 'quot', 'point', 'one', 'example', 'how', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'done.And', 'who', 'knew', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'still', 'had', 'actorism', 'left', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'reluctant', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'finally', 'moved', 'fight', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'when', 'redcoat', 'one', 'sons', 'Gibson', 'familiar', 'love-me', 'mannerisms', 'old', 'winter', 'coat', 'never', 'cutesy', 'tics', 'not', 'once', 'strike', 'false', 'note', 'character', 'elicits', 'laughter', 'tears', 'bloodshed', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'Gibson', 'honest-to-gosh', 'person', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'basic', 'point', 'stated', 'outright', 'Martin', 'early', 'story', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'was', 'won', 'wily', 'militiamen', 'who', 'served', 'direct', 'counterpoint', 'straight-on', 'British', 'manner', 'battle', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'stated', 'so', 'blatantly', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'being', 'laden', 'jingoism', 'appropriately', 'sparse', 'letting', 'movie', 'considerable', 'action', 'tell', 'story', 'such', 'movie', 'perfect', 'argument', 'gratuitous', 'movie', 'violence', 'R', 'rating', 'devastating', 'effects', 'war', 'Martin', 'great', 'deal', 'family', 'one', 'one', 'yet', ""n't"", 'linger', 'horrific', 'effects.Gibson', 'magnificent', 'underplaying', 'Rodat', 'spare', 'screenplay', 'seem', 'have', 'invigorated', 'rest', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'Everyone', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'British', 'colonel', 'bug', 'up', 'Martin', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'terrific', 'British', 'warlord', 'Gen.', 'Cornwallis', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'actory', 'smart-aleck', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'Martin', 'sons', 'seem', 'just', 'as', 'juiced', 'up', 'Gibson', 'is.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'told', 'great', 'deal', 'plot', 'have', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'touched', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Williams', 'best', 'movie', 'score', 'E.T', 'should', 'be', 'Please', 'just', 'trust', 'should', 'devote', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'one', 'most', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'movie', 'visions', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'long', 'long', 'time.The', 'Patriot', 'rated', 'R', 'mostly', 'very', 'graphic', 'violence', 'context', 'PG-13', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'appropriate', 'only', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'get', 'kids', 'talking', 'story', 'opportunity', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'most', 'history', 'teachers', 'parents', 'would', 'welcome']",N/A

Gibson is a widowed daddy resistant to joining the fight due to personal demons from his own battle experiences, and Ledger plays his war hungry son. As the plot unfolds, we watch as Gibson's character is pulled into the fight through personal tragedy and a thirst for vengeance.Jason Isaacs, who plays William Tavington, is a bad man. He kills little kids, he burns down churches holding entire villages within, and he has an unnatural interest in ruining Mel Gibson's life. You would think that an officer in the King's army would have better things to do than nurse a vendetta against a single family when surely there are more pressing issues at hand with 13 entire colonies revolting.And herein lies the problem with this movie...The characters, overall, are interesting, and the story is a fun, flag waving melodrama, but Tavington is not the most believable of characters, nor are his motives. Even his own people dislike him, and while one can get lost in his deliciously played out evil, he should have saved it for a role in which is is trying to take over the universe because his intensity is way over the top.On the other hand, Gibson's portrayal as a man reluctant to fight, and initially unwilling to give up his children to the war, is rather realistic. Many people in the colonies were reluctant to fight the mother country, even if they did agree with the ideals of the revolution!

I urge those who want to see a historically accurate film about the revolutionary war to find something else.  This movie is a work of fiction and does not apologize for that.Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a widowed father of seven.  He is pressed, unwillingly, into the war as a Colonel of the militia, after a ruthless dragoon shoots and kills one of his children.  From there the movie takes off and never lets up.  Viewers are shown how the war affects different peoples: fathers losing innocent children (sometimes more than one), women having their homes burnt to the ground, wives and small children shot for information, a slaves quest to earn his freedom with a year's worth of militia service, even a town full of people locked inside of a burning church.  There are also moments of levity as Benjamin Martin negotiates for a prison exchange with Lord Cornwallis, only for Cornwallis to learn that he has bartered for straw filled officers coats.The Patriot also is a good-looking film.  The filmography is excellent.  Costumes, backdrops, and battlefields are so well done as to be almost a work of art.  It is very visually impressive.Like many movies about war, The Patriot does not blink in showing the sickening details of life on the battlefield.  Those with a weak stomach need not apply.

This film is an exciting popcorn event film written and acted expertly.  &quot;The Patriot&quot; may be Hollywood's first Oscar worthy popcorn film.The heart of the film is Mel Gibson's performance as Benjamin Martin.  A hero of the French/Indian War, Martin is now a content farmer overseeing his brood of seven children.  His oldest son; Gabriel (Heath Ledger) signs on to fight the British agianst his father's wishes and before long Martin himself is fighting along with Gabriel.  While Gabriel fights for freedom, Martin's quest is far more dark and more personal as he tries to both protect his son in the war and seek revenge against a blood thirsty Redcoat played by Jason Issacs.This film has all the aspects of a great summer event blockbuster.  It has spectacular action sequences, villians and noble heroes, a strong supporting cast, a sweet romance and good hearted humor.  It is also the first solid film by Roland Emmerich.

557227,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,B00004XPPG,The Seeker,"[5, 7]","""The Patriot"" is an American historical and fictional war film that was released to theaters in the summer of 2000. It stars Mel Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper, Tom Wilkinson, and Heath Ledger. It was directed by Roland Emmerich, and written by Robert Rodat.What lead me to watching this movie comes from the fact that I am an American and I love American History, and I love to learn how my country came to be the great country it is today, and what sacrifices were made for the U.S.A. to become a country, and this is a wonderful film to learn all that.The film takes place during the American Revolutionary War, mostly during the mid-to-late 1770's in the state of South Carolina, which is the host to several bloody conflicts between the British and Continental armies. What lead to the American Revolution was that there was a time when the American Colonies were apart of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and Great Britain at that time had been in one war or another for fifty years and was drowning in debt. Over in London, England, Parliament felt that Americans should help out by paying their fair share, and King George III agreed. After all, Great Britain had spent plenty of pounds fighting in American Colonies for the good of the Americans, and the crown was still supporting the British Army to help stop Native American attacks on the American frontier. Great Britain felt it was their legal and moral right to collect payment. The American colonials however resented being taxed by parliament in which they had no representation, which (among other things) lead to the American Revolution.The story in ""The Patriot"" is about a rural American family lead by Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) - A father, a widower, farmer, and veteran to the French and Indian War. Martin and his family find themselves caught in the middle of war. Martin only desires to live in peace, and to raise his family, and for the sake of his children, he hopes to avoid conflict with King George III's Army as much as possible, but he and his family soon learn that being caught in the middle of a war can sometimes be more dangerous then actually picking a side to support.English actor Jason Isaacs brilliantly plays the part of the brutal Colonel William Tavington - An evil, heartless, loyal, and fearless English soldier who has nothing but hate for disloyal Americans. He will stop at nothing to crush the American rebellion against the Crown, including breaking the rules of warfare. This way of thinking soon leads to a conflict between Tavington and Martin when the two men meet.While many of the characters in this film and the main story itself are fictional, some of the events, as well as some of the other characters certainly are not fictional. Also, if you study the American Revolution, you'll learn that English soldiers commited various war crimes against American civilians, so what we see American civilians go through in this movie is not that far-fetched. One can learn quite a lot about the American Revolution by watching this film in fact. i.e. The settings, the locations, the battles, the style of clothing people wore during that time period, etc. This film is also visually beautiful, and quite a treat for the eyes. Especially on blu-ray.I've read some people's comments about this film over the years and they nit-pick about some of the minor historical inaccuracies, and the thing is, this film is not a documentary, and it's not a history book; It's a film and it's purpose is to not only educate, but to entertain as well, and I think this is a very educational and entertaining film. I love American History, and I study it, and when I watch the movie, I don't notice any historical inaccuracies, and I don't look for goofs. I just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. I also think because there are sadly some people out there who don't like history, in order to make a historical film more enjoyable for non-history buffs, some things had to more dramatized to make it more appealing and interesting to the casual fan who normally has no interest in history. It's mostly hardcore history buffs that nit-pick. I really don't think the average mainstream casual fan doesn't know about the inaccuracies or doesn't care. They are just looking to be entertained, as am I. I will also give an example of how just making a film entertaining as opposed to historically accurate can sometimes be a good thing:During the American Revolution, it's likely (although I'm not 100% sure) based on my studies, everyone (Americans included) spoke with an English accent, and it probably didn't even sound like today's English accent. However, from an entertainment stand point, in my view, I enjoy the fact that in ""The Patriot"" the American characters speak in a modern American accent, and the English characters speak in a modern English accent. Reasons being is because -First - Being an American myself, it makes me able to relate to the American characters more when I hear their American accent.Second - Because of the difference in the accents between the American characters and the English characters, it creates more of a culture clash, and adds to the tension and makes it all the more entertaining.All wars have a ""Us against them"" attitude, and if the accents were exactly the same in ""The Patriot"", I question if that tension and crystal clear distinction between the two sides would have been there. I think it makes the film more entertaining by having the accents be different. Even in movies about the American Civil War, the accents between both sides are different.I think history buffs will enjoy this film, as well as anyone looking for a good movie to watch on the 4th of July. I think some of the more hardcore history buffs who have a demand for historical accuracy might be bothered by the fact that this film not only aims to educate, but entertain as well, even if that means not making everything historically accurate. I also think some people from England may not care for the film since it vilifies the English.As far as how it compares to other war films - Some war films such as ""Glory"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" only show the U.S. soldier's perspective, and never presents the enemy's point of view, whereas other war films such as ""Gettysburg"" will not vilifie anyone, and presents both armies in a fair way and makes each side sympathetic, and you the viewer can understand both armies cause.""The Patriot"" however is a classic good vs. evil war film with the Americans as the heroes, and the English as the villians. Granted, it shows the English point of view in the film, but it shows it in the same way ""Star Wars"" shows scenes that feature it's villians. i.e. You see the scenes of English soldiers interacting with each other, and you can learn more about them, but you will not likely be cheering for them or understanding their choices afterwards.As far as the action goes - Some of the violence in the film, as well as the deaths of certain characters may be too intense and disturbing for younger viewers. I believe thirteen-years old and older is the idea age people should be to watch this film.There are a lot of good action scenes, but it's not just a straight-up action film. There's romance as well in the movie, and the film also shows just how badly war affected American civilians after the violence, and all the hard-work and planning it took to overcome such a strong and powerful English Army.Some have even compared ""The Patriot"" to ""Braveheart"" because both films star Mel Gibson, both are history films, and both are about Mel Gibson playing a character that leads a revolt against England. While both films have a few things in common, they overall are two very different movies in my view. American colonial culture and 1300-something Scottish culture are very different for starters, and because ""Braveheart"" took place in the 1300's and ""The Patriot"" took place in the 1770's, the styles of warfare are very different from each other, so the battle scenes are quite different. William Wallace was also a single man leading his people to freedom, and he craved war, whereas Benjamin Martin did not start any war, and did not welcome war, and is only trying to survive it and protect his family.The blu-ray for ""The Patriot"" is great. The audio and video are amazing. The special features include two featurettes titled ""True Patriots"" and ""The Art of War"", which are both about the making of the film.The soundtrack to this film is absolutely *amazing*. :-) I enjoy listening to it whenever I walk just before sunset.All and all, ""The Patriot"" is a great and fun film full of beauty, art, emotion, romance, education, action, and drama that will not only entertain you, but teach you a lot about early American history as well. It is a good film to watch anytime of the year, but it's extra fun to watch it around or on the 4th of July. It'll make the holiday twice as festive if you have a cool American Revolution film to watch. After swimming and enjoying BBQ all day, and popping some fireworks with your family on 4th of July, this is a great movie to pop-in and watch with them at night. It will make you proud to be an American.",5,Will make you proud to be an American!,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,9208,"['Patriot', 'American', 'historical', 'fictional', 'war', 'film', 'was',

Many of the uneducated masses will consider this movie accurate--it is not.  The Brits were not nearly as brutal as depicted in the film--no, they never herded townspeople in a church and then burned it to the ground.  The slavery aspect was also poorly represented.  Yes, free slaves often worked for a family as depicted in the movie, but this wasn't very common.But at least Hollywood veered away from it's anti-gun rights agenda and actually showed children using muskets and shooting at the Brits (although the incredible accuracy they demonstrated illustrated Hollywood's ignorance of 18th century arms, sigh).  As a side note--the predictable media uproar over this scene was pretty amusing.  What! Children using guns instead of just blankly standing by while the Brits try to kill their father!

Either that or he *really* has it in for England.Unfortunately, he didn't quite hit the mark. ""The Patriot"" is a good movie. There's lots of blood, guts, gore, and swearing (for the men) along with a sweet story of the love a father has for his children (for the women). But it's not ""Braveheart."" Although I did start to wonder in a couple of scenes - Mel Gibson, atop a horse, waving an American flag... I expected him to shout out ""Sons of Scotland!"" or the repeated shots shown in the previews of Mel Gibson running towards the camera, grimacing. Perhaps this character is some descendant of William Wallace!But that aside, this movie *is* worth watching - on video. I thank my lucky stars I didn't waste the money to see it on the screen. There's just a certain something lacking from this movie... a certain spark. And for some reason, I found the war scenes more disturbing than I did in ""Braveheart.""

557236,A8KQFDL7D81KR,B00004XPPG,Trevor James,"[4, 8]","Few movies can generate such an impact on a viewer and impose such an overwhelming feeling of patriotism, as does Roland Emmerich's aptly titled summer film ""The Patriot"".  Before even viewing it, you could determine that a war epic starring Mel Gibson had two words written all over it... Oscar contender.  And rightly so.  Emmerich does a brilliant job setting each scene.  But not in such a way that it became a predictable film.  Time period, character significance, and a general movie concept are established quickly and viewers can enjoy its contents without becoming lost in a sea of understatements and foreshadowing.  And what's more incredible is that ""The Patriot"" is very well written, especially for such a time period as the 18th century.  I personally found there to be no ""modern terms"" that can easily slip into character dialect as writers hastily try to complete editing before deadlines.  And now that we have a potential epic on our hands, all we need now is Hollywood's favorite leading man to make it  complete.  Ah yes, Mr. Mel Gibson.  A director couldn't ask for a better actor as Gibson whose repertoire stretches back 20 years and portraying dozens of different characters.  But what undoubtedly gave Gibson an edge in casting processes is a little movie in which he played a Scottish warrior vying for ""FREEDOM!""  And also in which the topic of patriotism was underlined.  I would of course be talking about the epic, award-winning ""Braveheart"".  And one can easily contrast ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"" and find the similarities striking.  Too striking perhaps.  And so I conclude that in spite of Gibson's great performance, Emmerich simply had to find someone else to portray a lead character.  Anyone who saw both films would agree with me when I say that ""The Patriot"" was an Americanized ""Braveheart"".  But I cannot deny that Emmerich and his film deserve any accolades that it receives.

557237,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00004XPPG,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Okay, I'm going to nail my colors to the mast here: not only do I like Roland Emmerich's The Patriot, but I also think it's also a damn good film, and not just because so many films about the Revolutionary War are so pitifully bad (Revolution, cough cough). While it is driven by the simplistic revenge motif that all American epics seem to need to stand a chance at the box-office, it does give a good sense of the slow progress of the war as it deteriorated from a `civilized' confrontation waged according to the rules of battle to an increasing vicious guerrilla war for survival. The battles are convincingly brutal and for perhaps the first time in a movie it shows how cannonballs were really used - not as explosives but to smash their way through the flesh and bone of the opposing ranks of soldiers.Yes, it glosses over the real Swamp Fox's racism in favor of an idealized vision of racial harmony and it invents a church-burning incident redolent of old anti-Nazi propaganda films (revenge on Herr Director's part, perhaps?), but it's not quite as simplistic as that. For much of the first half Mel Gibson's character takes no prisoners himself, taking genuine pleasure in killing surrendering British troops until he persuaded to stop more for propaganda reasons than moral ones. Similarly, it points out that this was initially very much a civil war, with colonial settlers divided among themselves over where their loyalties lay (people tend to forget that rather than Americans vs. British, it was British vs. British at that time). Certainly history gets a better deal here than it did in Gibson's own Braveheart. And give it credit for at least not having Gibson stab the bad guy with Old Glory.Don't use it as a history lesson by any means, though it's not quite the travesty outraged tabloids have implied, but as a lavish, old-fashioned epic, complete with a cast of thousands (even if many of them are digital), glorious widescreen photography and a fine score by John Williams.

557239,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00004XPPG,tropic_of_criticism,"[12, 24]","This picture has more in common with DIE HARD than genuine American history.  To be sure, there are moments when something approaching genuine history shines through, despite the writer's best efforts to the contrary.  But by and large THE PATRIOT leaves us unmolested by fact.  It's almost an outrage that the writer should've chosen to create as his hero an amalgamation of several real figures, instead of just choosing one.  Apart from being more interesting than the lackluster Mr. Martin, someone like Francis Marion would have grounded the writer in fact.As it is, THE PATRIOT wallows in its own excess.  You know the drill: improbable escapes from point-blank shooting, clever repartee with bloodthirsty enemies, a man of peace called back for one last mission of revenge.  It's so hackneyed, the script could've been phoned in.Unfortunately, this film looks great.  The producers try, and largely succeed, to imbue the picture with an authentic historic look.  The costumer, cinematographer and special effects guys, in particular, deserve Oscars  for their efforts.  The problem is they've created a piece of total fabrication that some kids are no doubt going to grow up thinking is true.  And it's not.  It just LOOKS fabulously real.To be fair, THE PATRIOT gives a general sense of truth.  It did happen that the South Carolina militia was vital to the success of the Continentals in the Revolutionary War.  Cornwallis was indeed the fashion plate and gentleman of society that is portrayed here.  And there was reluctance on the part of a lot of the American aristocracy to enter the war.But where other historical fiction manages to successfully create fictional heroes and put them in historically accurate settings, THE PATRIOT simply misses the mark.  Apart from being bad history, it's just bad drama.  Both villain and hero are more caricature than character.  Worse, the resolution of the personal conflict between them is hopelessly contrived.Having said all this, it's not that you won't have a good time with this movie.  It's a watchable film.  You might even come out with a visual understanding of why the French were strategically important to the final battle of the war, or what it felt like to be in Revolutionary combat.  You'll definitely exit with a sense of the importance of the Carolinian part of the war.  But I guarantee you that when the credits run,  you'll immediately say that the film could've been much, much better.[DVD NOTES:  Frankly, you learn more about the history of the times watching the extra features than watching the movie itself.  The ""True Patriots"" vignette is particularly rewarding, as it gives a sense of the efforts taken by everyone but the writer to imbue the movie with a sense of authenticity.  The director/producer commentary is worth hearing, but I found it hard to listen to at times.  I found Director Roland Emmerich's accent very off-putting, as he peppers his speech with an unbelievable number of ""you know""s and ""kind of""s and ""like""s.  Seriously, for every five words he says, only one conveys actual meaning.  It's like listening to Hans and Franz, from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE . . . for two hours.  Plus most of what he talks about, curiously, is history, not filmmaking.  It's producer Dean Devlin who gives the most insight into the actual filmmaking process.  It's still worth listening to, of course, but it doesn't rank among the best commentaries ever included on a DVD.]",3,"As they say in South Carolina, fair to middlin'",977616000,"12 24, 2000",2000,3455,"['picture', 'more', 'common', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'genuine', 'American', 'history', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'something', 'approaching', 'genuine', 'history', 'shines', 'writer', 'best', 'efforts', 'contrary', 'large', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'unmolested', 'fact', 'almost', 'outrage', 'writer', 'should', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'create', 'hero', 'amalgamation', 'several', 'real', 'figures', 'instead', 'just', 'choosing', 'one', 'Apart', 'being', 'more', 'interesting', 'lackluster', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'someone', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'would', 'have', 'grounded', 'writer', 'fact.As', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'own', 'excess', 'know', 'drill', 'improbable', 'escapes', 'point-blank', 'shooting', 'clever', 'repartee', 'bloodthirsty', 'enemies', 'man', 'peace', 'called', 'back', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'revenge', 'so', 'hackneyed', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'phoned', 'in.Unfortunately', 'film', 'great', 'producers', 'try', 'largely', 'succeed', 'imbue', 'picture', 'authentic', 'historic', 'look', 'costumer', 'cinematographer', 'special', 'effects', 'guys', 'particular', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'efforts', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'created', 'piece', 'total', 'fabrication', 'kids', 'are', 'doubt', 'going', 'grow', 'up', 'thinking', 'true', 'not', 'just', 'LOOKS', 'fabulously', 'be', 'fair', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'general', 'sense', 'truth', 'did', 'happen', 'South', 'Carolina', 'militia', 'was', 'vital', 'success', 'Continentals', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Cornwallis', 'was', 'indeed', 'fashion', 'plate', 'gentleman', 'society', 'portrayed', 'here', 'was', 'reluctance', 'part', 'lot', 'American', 'aristocracy', 'enter', 'war.But', 'where', 'other', 'historical', 'fiction', 'manages', 'successfully', 'create', 'fictional', 'heroes', 'put', 'historically', 'accurate', 'settings', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'simply', 'mark', 'Apart', 'being', 'bad', 'history', 'just', 'bad', 'drama', 'villain', 'hero', 'are', 'more', 'caricature', 'character', 'Worse', 'resolution', 'personal', 'conflict', 'hopelessly', 'contrived.Having', 'said', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'watchable', 'film', 'might', 'even', 'come', 'out', 'visual', 'understanding', 'why', 'French', 'were', 'strategically', 'important', 'final', 'battle', 'war', 'what', 'felt', 'be', 'Revolutionary', 'combat', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'exit', 'sense', 'importance', 'Carolinian', 'part', 'war', 'guarantee', 'when', 'credits', 'run', ""'ll"", 'immediately', 'say', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'much', 'better', '[', 'DVD', 'NOTES', 'Frankly', 'learn', 'more', 'history', 'times', 'watching', 'extra', 'features', 'watching', 'movie', 'True', 'Patriots', 'vignette', 'particularly', 'rewarding', 'sense', 'efforts', 'taken', 'everyone', 'writer', 'imbue', 'movie', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'director/producer', 'commentary', 'worth', 'hearing', 'found', 'hard', 'listen', 'times', 'found', 'Director', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'accent', 'very', 'off-putting', 'speech', 'unbelievable', 'number', 'know', 's', 'kind', 's', 's.', 'Seriously', 'five', 'words', 'only', 'one', 'conveys', 'actual', 'meaning', 'listening', 'Hans', 'Franz', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'two', 'hours', 'most', 'what', 'curiously', 'history', 'not', 'filmmaking', 'producer', 'Dean', 'Devlin', 'who', 'most', 'insight', 'actual', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'still', 'worth', 'listening', 'course', ""n't"", 'rank', 'best', 'commentaries', 'ever', 'included', 'DVD', ']']",N/A

557242,A2G8IR6ENZSQHF,B00004XPPG,"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[27, 59]","I was recently forced to watch ""The Patriot"" for an assignment, as I was to analyze its historical accuracy.  Needless to say, the film is so wildly inaccurate that it's probably more entertaining if you view it without having much knowledge of American History.  However, ""The Patriot"" is relentlessly mediocre by any standards, at least in my opinion.""The Patriot"" is filled with historical howlers.  Why did the British lose the American Revolution?  Because they pissed off Mel Gibson!  Why did the Americans rebel against the British?  Because they were purely noble, while the British were heartless Nazis and aristocratic fops.  There is never any mention of the economic reasons for the colonies going to war against Britain.  According to ""The Patriot"", race relations in 18th century South Carolina were quite good; sure, there were a few bigots, but they had all been won over by the end of the war, and the slaves themselves were happy to serve their kind masters.  This fantasy world, of course, leaves no explanation for South Carolina's secession and the Civil War less than a century later, or even the Civil Rights movement of the 20th century.  All the women in ""The Patriot"" are outspoken and willful, and treated as absolute equals by the men- this leaves no explanation for the feminisit movement over the next two centuries.For all the above reasons and more, I was very irritated when I analyzed this film for historical accuracy.  However, it's really not a very good movie anyways.  I suppose Mel Gibson has some charm, though I was not affected by it (let's just say that after last year, I dislike him with a Passion).  Heath  Ledger is less effective, as he's downright boring and in the center of a painful romantic subplot.  Then there's Jason Isaacs, who plays the British villain with such over-the-top menace that I often found him ridiculous.  This guy burns down houses and murders women and children just for the fun of it- he seems pulled straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon.Overall, the film's pace often flags, and its climax leaves much to be desired.  This is a very going-through-the-motions movie, and it's pretty easy to predict the end of every scene.  Only one event in the entire movie surprised me (that being the conclusion of the negotioations between the protagonist Benjamin Martin and General Cornwallis).  Director Roland Emmerich is obviously out of his league here- he's known for directing entertaining disaster flicks, not historical epics.  I'm afraid a couple good battle scenes do not make a 150-minute film.I can't really recommend ""The Patriot"" to anyone other than Mel Gibson fans and those who believe that the American Revolution was divine and holy, with no flaws or moral amibguity (those kind of people are probably Mel Gibson fans anyways).  This is an inaccurate, overblown, and borderline boring film.",2,Review from an American History major- it stinks,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,2880,"['was', 'recently', 'forced', 'watch', 'Patriot', 'assignment', 'was', 'analyze', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'so', 'wildly', 'inaccurate', 'probably', 'more', 'entertaining', 'view', 'having', 'much', 'knowledge', 'American', 'History', 'However', 'Patriot', 'relentlessly', 'mediocre', 'standards', 'least', 'opinion', 'Patriot', 'filled', 'historical', 'howlers', 'Why', 'did', 'British', 'lose', 'American', 'Revolution', 'pissed', 'off', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Why', 'did', 'Americans', 'rebel', 'British', 'were', 'purely', 'noble', 'British', 'were', 'heartless', 'Nazis', 'aristocratic', 'fops', 'never', 'mention', 'economic', 'reasons', 'colonies', 'going', 'war', 'Britain', 'According', 'Patriot', 'race', 'relations', '18th', 'century', 'South', 'Carolina', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'sure', 'were', 'few', 'bigots', 'had', 'been', 'won', 'end', 'war', 'slaves', 'were', 'happy', 'serve', 'kind', 'masters', 'fantasy', 'world', 'course', 'explanation', 'South', 'Carolina', 'secession', 'Civil', 'War', 'less', 'century', 'later', 'even', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', '20th', 'century', 'women', 'Patriot', 'are', 'outspoken', 'willful', 'treated', 'absolute', 'equals', 'men-', 'explanation', 'feminisit', 'movement', 'next', 'two', 'centuries.For', 'above', 'reasons', 'more', 'was', 'very', 'irritated', 'when', 'analyzed', 'film', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'However', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'anyways', 'suppose', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'charm', 'was', 'not', 'affected', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'last', 'year', 'dislike', 'Passion', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'less', 'effective', 'downright', 'boring', 'center', 'painful', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Then', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'who', 'British', 'villain', 'such', 'over-the-top', 'menace', 'often', 'found', 'ridiculous', 'guy', 'down', 'houses', 'murders', 'women', 'children', 'just', 'fun', 'it-', 'pulled', 'straight', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon.Overall', 'film', 'pace', 'often', 'flags', 'climax', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'very', 'going-through-the-motions', 'movie', 'pretty', 'easy', 'predict', 'end', 'scene', 'Only', 'one', 'event', 'entire', 'movie', 'surprised', 'being', 'conclusion', 'negotioations', 'protagonist', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'General', 'Cornwallis', 'Director', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'obviously', 'league', 'here-', 'known', 'directing', 'entertaining', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'not', 'historical', 'epics', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'couple', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'make', '150-minute', 'film.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'Patriot', 'anyone', 'other', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fans', 'who', 'believe', 'American', 'Revolution', 'was', 'divine', 'holy', 'flaws', 'moral', 'amibguity', 'kind', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fans', 'anyways', 'inaccurate', 'overblown', 'borderline', 'boring', 'film']",N/A

What a dismal disappointment. It's amazing that so many moviemakers have so many resources at their artistic disposal and are so clueless to the greater importance and responsibility of posterity, not to mention art and history. I watched this film and marvelled with approval at the incredible recreation of the period, the wonderful energy and superb acting, and then watched with dismay as it went unbelievably nowhere. Formula, formula, formula. It's just a Braveheart rehash with even more abuse of history and more political correctness.  You'd think they'd want to give us some inkling into the impetus for the American Revolutionaries and some grasp of the real relationships of the times. Instead, they give us Longshanks and his stabbing henchmen reincarnated in a couple of redcoats, and the impetus, once again, only revenge. It's just the same old run to the end to see one really bad fictional thug get his just reward by the oh so noble Melly. Almost nothing here really about the Revolution. Certainly nothing profound. Certainly, uninformative. Certainly, a storyline uninspired, except by caution and an eye on gross receipts. Simple entertainment shlock. The makers should be ashamed. In the true modern Hollywood calculation, adolescent sensation reigns supreme over mature fidelity and intelligent informed dramatic engagement. Is historical fiction really in the hands of Jackass?  Are teenage boys really the only bottom line for the major movie industry?  They should include a tube of pimple creme with this video. No chances taken, no long lasting value created. Grand production, grand disappointment. Another log on the ashheap of Hollywood moviemaking. Two brilliant stars for the recreators and the actors, three very dead stars for the scriptwriters, the director, and the producers. What a waste. What a waste.

He makes you feel for his character and the things going on around him.  You feel great sympathy for his family and the ordeals that many families in the war times of the 1700's went through.  This is a mark of a good actor.  He basically took over the movie and made it his.The cinematography was out of this world also.  The setting was beautifully photographed.

It's incorrectly named, for one thing.  Benjamin Martin is not a patriot.  He is not motivated by love of country or dedication to an ideal.  He takes up arms for the simple purpose of revenge.  He's basically a vigilante.As for the rest of the movie, it's a little too maudlin and a little too politically correct for my taste.  Fortunately, it's beautifully staged and shot, and even more fortunately, Jason Isaacs acts the holy hell out of the villain, Col. Tavington.

Historians/Revolutionary War buffs might find themselves disappointed with all of the historical inaccuracies littered throughout the film, especially if they expect to see a dramatic reinactment of the Revolutionary War with an all star cast (finally!), but if you see this movie with the sole expectation of being entertained, I don't believe that you'll be disappointed at all.Though it might be a few moments too long, The Patriot covers just about everything you'd want to see in your typical Hollywood Summer Action film. Everything is pretty formulaic. We have our stalwart and true hero, widower Benjamin Martin (in an effective performance by Mel Gibson) raising a family all by himself. Among his family is eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) who is very eager to participate in the Revolutionary War. Benjamin, having seen enough of the horrors of war in youth is opposed to the very idea and is quite dismayed when Gabriel eventually enlists in the Army. His life becomes quite difficult from that point on. Benjamin has the pleasure of meeting the savage, sadistic and British Col. William Tavington, (played flawlessly by Jason Isaacs) who arrives on his property to take Gabriel away to be hanged. In what one might call an unfortunate turn of events, during this initial meeting Tavington also kills Benjamin's other son Thomas and burns down his house.What follows is your standard fight for the cause/a little for your own personal vendetta/classic showdown between good and evil storyline. Throughout the course of the movie we are privy to every range of emotions under the sun and the monologues that inevitably come along with them at least twice. Also, our characters become less dimensional and more like caricatures so we know for sure who we need to cheer for and who we need to boo. Fortunately, both of these things work for the movie. It is a basic plot that's received an intense treatment of Hollywood Glamourization but it's a success because it understands that and has no illusions about being anything more or anything less.The battle scenes are effectively violent, sometimes extremely disturbing but all wonderfully choreographed. The performances by the actors are strong. Particular props must go to Jason Isaacs who so perfectly played the part of the cold and ruthless William Tavington that it's hard to think of any other actor who could play the role half as well. He and Mel Gibson work well with one another. The movie, at times, strays dangerously close to rising to the heights of Cheesedom, but overall it's a satisfying watch.

""Kevin""","[2, 5]","You can say it all you want - The Patriot can never be compared to Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down or Glory or Platoon or Braveheart and any other classic epic war films...however, it is a rousing action film that does hit deeper than cannonball decapitations and slow motion battle scenes.We know the Revolutionary War was not quite like this.  The British are depicted as merciless redcoat bastards, with utter disregard for the rules of engagement (sort of like Benjamin Martin's ragtag bunch)...but it's for a reason.  We need somebody to root for.  I have no doubt that in most cases, the Brtish were fairly well-behaved with reasonable manners and delightful accents (maybe), but that leaves no room for Col. Tavington's deep-seated vileness that makes us want to slap him upside the head ourselves for being such a jackass.  Roland Emmerich's film is really about the family and what happens to a family when it is torn apart by war.  Mel Gibson's character does all he can to prevent it from happening, but having two older sons itching to fight makes it inevitable.  And once one of his sons is shot and killed by the dastardly Tavington (sorry to those who haven't seen it), Benjamin Martin is propelled down a path of revengeful violence.  The slaughter of the British caravan may seem ridiculous and over the top, but the pain on Martin's face is so visible as he digs the tomahawk out of a redcoats back.Any parents who view this film will probably connect more with the family drama than the epic war scenes (and they are indeed epic).  I still tear up at the part when Martin's youngest daughter, who up until this point has never spoken a word to him, yells for him to come back, ""don't go, i'll say anything you want, just don't go.""  The actress is adorable and does a phenomenal job in the scene, making a potential very cheesy moment quite powerful.That being said, the war scenes are amazing.  The sweeping camera shots and bright colors, combined with the graphic special effects convey the realism.  This was the Revolutionary war movie I had been waiting for.  I had grown tired of seeing dumb re-enactments and History Channel specials where the actors just fall over and play dead.  The Patriot doesn't spare the viewer.  We hear the ""thump"" of musket balls striking flesh, see the blood spatter from the impact, and witness the horrible devastation of cannon fire.  Besides the final fight scene between Martin and Tavington with too much slow motion and shots of Mel Gibson contorting his face in pain  ( I would have appreciated a real time duel with a more realistic finish), The Patriot accomplishes two goals.  1)  Gives us a nice (if not entirely accurate) taste of American history, and 2) Succeeds in making the scenes about family just as important as the battles.  For that, I'll give 4 stars anyday.",4,Quality Entertainment,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2844,"['can', 'say', 'want', 'Patriot', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'compared', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Glory', 'Platoon', 'Braveheart', 'other', 'classic', 'epic', 'war', 'films', 'however', 'rousing', 'action', 'film', 'hit', 'deeper', 'cannonball', 'decapitations', 'slow', 'motion', 'battle', 'scenes.We', 'know', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'British', 'are', 'depicted', 'merciless', 'redcoat', 'bastards', 'utter', 'disregard', 'rules', 'engagement', 'sort', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'ragtag', 'bunch', 'reason', 'need', 'somebody', 'root', 'have', 'doubt', 'most', 'cases', 'Brtish', 'were', 'fairly', 'well-behaved', 'reasonable', 'manners', 'delightful', 'accents', 'maybe', 'room', 'Col.', 'Tavington', 'deep-seated', 'vileness', 'want', 'slap', 'upside', 'head', 'being', 'such', 'jackass', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'film', 'really', 'family', 'what', 'family', 'when', 'torn', 'apart', 'war', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'can', 'prevent', 'happening', 'having', 'two', 'older', 'sons', 'itching', 'fight', 'inevitable', 'once', 'one', 'sons', 'shot', 'killed', 'dastardly', 'Tavington', 'sorry', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Benjamin', 'Martin', 'propelled', 'down', 'path', 'revengeful', 'violence', 'slaughter', 'British', 'caravan', 'may', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'pain', 'Martin', 'face', 'so', 'visible', 'tomahawk', 'redcoats', 'back.Any', 'parents', 'who', 'view', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'connect', 'more', 'family', 'drama', 'epic', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'indeed', 'epic', 'still', 'tear', 'up', 'part', 'when', 'Martin', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'who', 'up', 'point', 'never', 'spoken', 'word', 'yells', 'come', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'i', ""'ll"", 'say', 'anything', 'want', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'actress', 'adorable', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'scene', 'making', 'potential', 'very', 'cheesy', 'moment', 'quite', 'being', 'said', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'amazing', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'shots', 'bright', 'colors', 'combined', 'graphic', 'special', 'effects', 'convey', 'realism', 'was', 'Revolutionary', 'war', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'had', 'grown', 'tired', 'seeing', 'dumb', 're-enactments', 'History', 'Channel', 'where', 'actors', 'just', 'fall', 'over', 'play', 'dead', 'Patriot', ""n't"", 'spare', 'viewer', 'hear', 'thump', 'musket', 'balls', 'striking', 'flesh', 'see', 'blood', 'spatter', 'impact', 'witness', 'horrible', 'devastation', 'cannon', 'fire', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'Martin', 'Tavington', 'too', 'much', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'contorting', 'face', 'pain', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'real', 'time', 'duel', 'more', 'realistic', 'finish', 'Patriot', 'accomplishes', 'two', 'goals', '1', 'nice', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'taste', 'American', 'history', '2', 'Succeeds', 'making', 'scenes', 'family', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'battles', ""'ll"", 'give', '4', 'stars', 'anyday']",N/A

We can't offend African Americans so we've got a South Carolina plantation owner who has African free men, not slaves, working his field.  Our hero has to be the most sympathetic character, so we make him a widower secretly pining for his dead wife's sister.

Gibson's character is a composite of several actual militia commanders, most notably one Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox, who spent the war making life miserable for the British in the Carolinas. Isaac's character is a fictional variant on the British cavalry officer Banastre Tarleton, who in fact survived the war and went on to become a member of Parliament in London (side note: Tarleton appears in the film Amazing Grace, where the actor Ciaran Hinds plays him). The timeline is somewhat skewed in the film between Camden and the Battle of Cowpens (essentially the final battle in the film, never actually called that), and it brings in two men who weren't actually at that battle- Cornwallis and Greene.

First, the &quot;slaves&quot; weren't slaves at all. They were paid workers for Benjamin. They said so themselves. Secondly, the slave that joined Benjamin's militia wasn't his slave. He was acting as a substitute for a slaveowner that was too old to fight. Third, the newly-freed slave isn't the only one helping to rebuild Benjamin's house. All the surviving members of the militia were pitching in as well. It was also implied that ALL the fighters' homes would be rebuilt in like fashion, with EVERYBODY helping. As for your umbrage taken to the tactics used by the British Army, keep in mind that Colonel Tavington was the only one using these tactics, and that he was reprimanded by General Cornwallis. Next time, actually watch the movie before you decide to write a criticism about it. For the rest of you, the movie is worth at least a rent.
