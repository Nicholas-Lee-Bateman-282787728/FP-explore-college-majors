1668225,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00EO2I6PQ,California Dreaming,"[8, 24]","If you make the mistake of renting this film, you will most likely think, ""I'm halfway through this movie.  Should I turn it off and find something better to do -- like say, washing the dishes or staring at the wall -- or should I watch the rest of it since I paid for a full rental?""  So the movie puts you into Zugzwang from the opening move, which is never a good position for a chess player or a film viewer to be in.I played high school chess, and have a degree in computer science, and so you'd think that this movie would have been as satisfying as a cheapo checkmate for me.  And you'd be wrong.  It was a blunder making the film, it was a bigger blunder paying for it, and it was finally the biggest blunder of all by not just resigning in the second act and dropping the King.  Or at least the remote.I guess that this is supposed to be a comedy, and that may be so, but aren't comedies supposed to be funny?  While watching, I quickly thought that it was probably the filmmakers' intent to create somewhat of a ""Spinal Tap"" for nerds or chess players.  If this is true, it seems that all they did was offer us a poisoned pawn.  At least my stomach feels that way at this point.  And maybe even my wallet.And I've seen many chess films:  ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"" featuring Bobby Fischer, and ""Game Over"" featuring Garry Kasparov, to name but a few.  Those first two were really good, and even ""Game Over"" had its moments, even though Mr. Kasparov made some very unsound and invalid remarks during the film, surprising since he has such a high IQ.  But this film decided to take a quirky approach, and that quirkiness doesn't really work.  No; it doesn't work at all.  I find that even the worst episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" is funnier that this stuff.The professional reviews on this film seemed to be really strong, and so I was really looking forward to ""Computer Chess.""  Instead, all that I can think about now is, ""What move was my worst?  Was it taking a peek at the reviews, or was it picking up the remote?""

1668227,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00EO2I6PQ,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 3]","Set in and around a computer chess tournament in an anonymous hotel in the Eighties, COMPUTER CHESS takes a gently humorous look at a group of geeks - some of them are involved in computers, others in some form of transcendental meditation. Shot in black-and-white, including the kind of shots (blurred screens, switches from black-and-white to color, abrupt changes of location) that suggest amateur film-making (even though the film is very professionally made), the film looks at how geeks approach what they do with extreme seriousness, even though what they do is manifestly absurd. Myles Paige is particularly good as Pappageorge, who thinks of himself as a computer whizkid but ends up having a weekend from hell at the computer convention. There are some very funny set pieces, especially when one computer geek finds himself in a bedroom with a husband-and-wife from the transcendental meditation group, who are both dedicated to the idea of free love.

As the movie opens, we are introduced to the topic of the day, very much documentary-style, and then we get to know the various characters that are part of the (small) computer chess community. There is the guy who has no hotel room. There is the only woman who is participating in the tournament, etc. etc. As the movie moves along, we understand each of their backgrounds a little better, and we wonder how the actual tournament will play out. To tell you more of the 'plot' would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it unfolds.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from actor-writer-director Andrew Bujalski (&#34;Mutual Appreciation&#34;, &#34;Funny Ha Ha&#34;), who seems to become more and more skilled at making these little movies with virtually no budget to speak of. Second, this movie is shot in black and white, but more importantly, the way we get to see this, is as if we were watching public access TV from back in the day. Third, when the movie started, I was sure that I was watching a documentary. In fact I did a double-take of the DVD jacket to re-check whether this was fact or fiction. Last but not least, yes there is a movie 'plot', but far more important are the observations of the people and their environments within they exist: what exactly is &#34;artificial intelligence&#34;? is chess the same as war? etc.Bottom line: there is indie (like the Weinsteins), and then there is indie-indie, and that is where this movie resorts under.

1668235,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B00EO2I6PQ,"technoguy ""jack""","[1, 1]","Computer Chess is an interesting attempt to capture the feelings of an other era(the 80s) through a simpler technology(Sony ATC-3260 tube camera).It's a paradox, because computer chess was about developing computer software programmes to take on human beings in games of chess.This film depicts a conference held in a hotel where different programmers meet in an annual tournament to find a winner.At the same time in the hotel there is a bizarre cult of seekers into sexual and spiritual awakening, using group awareness exercises. We are going back to the simpler forms of computer technology,when programmers instilled their intelligence levels up into a computing chess programme.It's the early form of artificial intelligence.The fact that it's in black and white is because of the technical limitation of video but it strangely enhances the beauty of effect,with dull/shallow focus,grey palette and the blooms and smears of light.Necessity the mother of invention.The documentary format the best way into this world,a homage to it.We also get the clunky machinery involved.These nerd-voyagers are on the frontiers of new mental worlds.Their awkwardness showing their indifference to human reality,as the machines become more human,showing traits of consciousness and moods.Chess is really a Maguffin,since you do not actually see any games carried out in detail.Instead the film shows the point when human intelligence merges with computation,the eccentric frontier and its border guards,geniuses,weirdos,geeks of all persuasions,dope-freaks,conspiracy theorists,mavericks,folkies.There are times in the film that it seems a Magritte painting is coming to life,like where programmers become chess pieces,or hotel corridors look like something out of Last Year in Marienbad,the invasion of  fluffy cats,and the strange robot woman in the lobby.Peter Bishton(Reister) forms the film's central focus,reserved,introverted,awkward,floundering from one situation to the next,unable to express his anxieties,discomforts.His eye the still logical centre of the apocalyptic changes.The attempt of the one female in the tournament to flirt with him is funny.There is  a sub-plot of a man, Papageorge,without a hotel room,bedding down wherever he can,ending up sleeping under a table in the conference room,where he is woken by a couples' therapy group and subjected to a rebirthing.There's also a mix-up where the chess players have to share the conference room with the new agers.A couple of swingers attempt to seduce Peter without success.Machine-man who avoids social development clashes with more liberated forms of social behaviour.Minorities like ""the African"" and ""the woman"" stick out like sore thumbs.Drab realism mutates into surrealistic effects,blips.bleeps,jumps,split screens,speeded-up film,coloured loops of repeated footage.Machines fall victim to glitches;TSAR 3.0's propensity for `committing suicide',pointlessly sacrificing Queens or chasing after pawns.Inconsistencies move in like inserted bugs,with technical hiccups, bizarre shot choices,streaking,haloed images, contributing to narrative dysfunction.There is a strain of paranoia,the suspicion of spooks from the Pentagon,lurking about the competition,looking to apply these technologies to the military-industrial-complex. The idea of computer dating is nascent.To the classic mind the grid square is a liberating system with endless possibilities,butto the hippies this shows the limits of a square existence.In their way these oddball independents are struggling to break free of limited mind-sets and bereborn. An image of a camera pointing at the sun,mirrors the Icarus-like hubris of computer geeks overstretching their equipment to soar.Bujalski has made quite a film layered like a seed-bed,germinating thoughts long afterwards.",5,Back to the future: liberation of the sixty four squared grid,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,3809,"['Computer', 'Chess', 'interesting', 'attempt', 'capture', 'feelings', 'other', 'era', '80s', 'simpler', 'technology', 'Sony', 'ATC-3260', 'tube', 'camera', '.It', 'paradox', 'computer', 'chess', 'was', 'developing', 'computer', 'software', 'take', 'human', 'beings', 'games', 'chess.This', 'film', 'conference', 'held', 'hotel', 'where', 'different', 'programmers', 'meet', 'annual', 'tournament', 'find', 'winner.At', 'same', 'time', 'hotel', 'bizarre', 'cult', 'seekers', 'sexual', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'using', 'group', 'awareness', 'exercises', 'are', 'going', 'back', 'simpler', 'forms', 'computer', 'technology', 'when', 'programmers', 'instilled', 'intelligence', 'levels', 'up', 'computing', 'chess', 'programme.It', 'early', 'form', 'artificial', 'intelligence.The', 'fact', 'black', 'white', 'technical', 'limitation', 'video', 'strangely', 'beauty', 'effect', 'dull/shallow', 'focus', 'grey', 'palette', 'blooms', 'smears', 'light.Necessity', 'mother', 'invention.The', 'documentary', 'format', 'best', 'way', 'world', 'homage', 'it.We', 'also', 'get', 'clunky', 'machinery', 'involved.These', 'nerd-voyagers', 'are', 'frontiers', 'new', 'mental', 'worlds.Their', 'awkwardness', 'showing', 'indifference', 'human', 'reality', 'machines', 'become', 'more', 'human', 'showing', 'traits', 'consciousness', 'moods.Chess', 'really', 'Maguffin', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'see', 'games', 'carried', 'out', 'detail.Instead', 'film', 'point', 'when', 'human', 'intelligence', 'merges', 'computation', 'eccentric', 'frontier', 'border', 'guards', 'geniuses', 'weirdos', 'geeks', 'persuasions', 'dope-freaks', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'mavericks', 'are', 'times', 'film', 'Magritte', 'painting', 'coming', 'life', 'where', 'programmers', 'become', 'chess', 'pieces', 'hotel', 'corridors', 'look', 'something', 'Last', 'Year', 'Marienbad', 'invasion', 'fluffy', 'cats', 'strange', 'robot', 'woman', 'lobby.Peter', 'Bishton', 'Reister', 'film', 'central', 'focus', 'reserved', 'introverted', 'awkward', 'floundering', 'one', 'situation', 'next', 'unable', 'express', 'anxieties', 'discomforts.His', 'eye', 'still', 'logical', 'centre', 'apocalyptic', 'changes.The', 'attempt', 'one', 'female', 'tournament', 'flirt', 'funny.There', 'sub-plot', 'man', 'Papageorge', 'hotel', 'room', 'bedding', 'down', 'wherever', 'can', 'ending', 'up', 'sleeping', 'table', 'conference', 'room', 'where', 'woken', 'couples', 'therapy', 'group', 'subjected', 'rebirthing.There', 'also', 'mix-up', 'where', 'chess', 'players', 'have', 'share', 'conference', 'room', 'new', 'agers.A', 'couple', 'swingers', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'Peter', 'success.Machine-man', 'who', 'social', 'development', 'clashes', 'more', 'liberated', 'forms', 'social', 'behaviour.Minorities', 'African', 'woman', 'out', 'sore', 'thumbs.Drab', 'realism', 'surrealistic', 'effects', 'blips.bleeps', 'jumps', 'split', 'screens', 'speeded-up', 'film', 'coloured', 'loops', 'repeated', 'footage.Machines', 'fall', 'victim', 'glitches', 'TSAR', '3.0', 'propensity', 'committing', 'suicide', 'pointlessly', 'sacrificing', 'Queens', 'chasing', 'pawns.Inconsistencies', 'move', 'inserted', 'bugs', 'technical', 'hiccups', 'bizarre', 'shot', 'choices', 'streaking', 'haloed', 'images', 'contributing', 'narrative', 'dysfunction.There', 'strain', 'paranoia', 'suspicion', 'spooks', 'Pentagon', 'lurking', 'competition', 'looking', 'apply', 'technologies', 'military-industrial-complex', 'idea', 'computer', 'dating', 'nascent.To', 'classic', 'mind', 'grid', 'square', 'liberating', 'system', 'endless', 'possibilities', 'butto', 'hippies', 'limits', 'square', 'existence.In', 'way', 'oddball', 'independents', 'are', 'struggling', 'break', 'free', 'limited', 'mind-sets', 'bereborn', 'image', 'camera', 'pointing', 'sun', 'Icarus-like', 'hubris', 'computer', 'geeks', 'overstretching', 'equipment', 'soar.Bujalski', 'made', 'quite', 'film', 'layered', 'seed-bed', 'germinating', 'thoughts', 'long', 'afterwards']",Computer Chess
1668236,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00EO2I6PQ,Turfseer,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***In 1984, I was invited by a friend to a poker game, who happened to have the latest in video equipment at the time and taped all the raunchy conversations between the games' participants, for most of the night. With a little editing, I mind's well submit this old tape to the Sundance Festival. Given the current mindset of most film critics today, with their preening and slavish devotion to anything in the least nostalgic, I might have a good chance of winning some kind of award.I can find no other explanation as to why the critics were taken in by 'Computer Chess', except for this love of nostalgia. Certainly it's not the Computer Chess plot that is at all engaging; creator Andrew Bujalski saw to that. But what he did do was shot the film on the old Portapak cameras, giving one the impression that this mockumentary, about a computer chess convention, actually took place in the early 1980s. As we gaze up on the screen, we see that Bujalski mimics old video--the dimensions aren't large enough to fill the entire theater screen (just like my old 1984 video appears, when I play it back on my computer today). Bujalski also populates the screen with images of beloved old computers and text from word processors, which none of us have seen in decades.So it's a sort of hypnotism that's going on here. It doesn't really matter what happens as far as the story is concerned. It's a meandering affair, where we can get the basic idea in the first fifteen minutes. Think 'The Big Bang Theory' meets 'Bobby Fischer'. A group of nerds have developed software programs, which they pit against one another over games of chess. The games take place at a low-rent hotel where there are two other groups in attendance: a new age group led by a guru from Africa and a bunch of swingers.Bujalski is actually aiming for laughs in this lightweight spoof. His main nerd is a boorish guy who discovers that the hotel never received his reservation, so he's forced to crash in different rooms of his fellow convention attendees, every night. Due to a mix up, the nerds must share their convention room with the new age group and there's also another bit, where a libidinous couple attempts to seduce another one of the nerds, without success.Computer Chess is strictly for those who have a nostalgic longing for the early 80s. It's a film with a little style but virtually no substance. While Bujalski looks sympathetically at his computer nerds, their machinations are of little consequence. For more sophisticated film-goers, avoid this lightweight debacle, like the plague.",1,"Lightweight computer nerd mockumentary, bamboozles critics, desperate for early 80s nostalgia",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2609,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***In', '1984', 'was', 'invited', 'friend', 'poker', 'game', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'latest', 'video', 'equipment', 'time', 'taped', 'raunchy', 'conversations', 'games', 'participants', 'most', 'night', 'little', 'editing', 'mind', 'well', 'submit', 'old', 'tape', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'Given', 'current', 'mindset', 'most', 'film', 'critics', 'today', 'preening', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'anything', 'least', 'nostalgic', 'might', 'have', 'good', 'chance', 'winning', 'kind', 'award.I', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'explanation', 'why', 'critics', 'were', 'taken', ""'Computer"", 'Chess', 'love', 'nostalgia', 'Certainly', 'not', 'Computer', 'Chess', 'plot', 'engaging', 'creator', 'Andrew', 'Bujalski', 'saw', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'was', 'shot', 'film', 'old', 'Portapak', 'cameras', 'giving', 'one', 'impression', 'mockumentary', 'computer', 'chess', 'convention', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'early', '1980s', 'gaze', 'up', 'screen', 'see', 'Bujalski', 'mimics', 'old', 'video', 'dimensions', 'are', ""n't"", 'large', 'enough', 'fill', 'entire', 'theater', 'screen', 'just', 'old', '1984', 'video', 'when', 'play', 'back', 'computer', 'today', 'Bujalski', 'also', 'screen', 'images', 'beloved', 'old', 'computers', 'text', 'word', 'processors', 'none', 'have', 'seen', 'decades.So', 'sort', 'hypnotism', 'going', 'here', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'meandering', 'affair', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'basic', 'idea', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Think', ""'The"", 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'meets', ""'Bobby"", 'Fischer', 'group', 'nerds', 'have', 'developed', 'software', 'programs', 'pit', 'one', 'games', 'chess', 'games', 'take', 'place', 'low-rent', 'hotel', 'where', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'groups', 'attendance', 'new', 'age', 'group', 'led', 'guru', 'Africa', 'bunch', 'swingers.Bujalski', 'actually', 'aiming', 'laughs', 'lightweight', 'spoof', 'main', 'nerd', 'boorish', 'guy', 'who', 'hotel', 'never', 'received', 'reservation', 'forced', 'crash', 'different', 'rooms', 'fellow', 'convention', 'attendees', 'night', 'Due', 'mix', 'up', 'nerds', 'must', 'share', 'convention', 'room', 'new', 'age', 'group', 'also', 'bit', 'where', 'libidinous', 'couple', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'one', 'nerds', 'success.Computer', 'Chess', 'strictly', 'who', 'have', 'nostalgic', 'longing', 'early', '80s', 'film', 'little', 'style', 'virtually', 'substance', 'Bujalski', 'sympathetically', 'computer', 'nerds', 'machinations', 'are', 'little', 'consequence', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'film-goers', 'avoid', 'lightweight', 'debacle', 'plague']",Computer Chess
