1411485,A3MCD82QVBLWRX,B004JHZ73K,Hunter,"[0, 3]","With no offense to the ""fans"" of this film, Reviews aren't made (or shouldn't be) to give the auteur/author a break.  They are made to evaluate the item so others have a fair idea of what it is prior to spending hard earned (and more so in these less than great times) money.  It is no one's fault than the producer of a film/book/whatever if it does not meet the wishes/needs of those it is supposed to be aimed at.  Complaining about those who feel it did not meet those needs is rather bad form.  Instead, help the filmmaker learn how to make the films the audience wants.Re: that.....When teaching students in media production class one of the first things I tell them is  When you get out in the real world, you are free to make the films you want to any time you have all the money required to make them or can get it from others willing to let you make the film your way.  But, if you rely on others for your funds, you had better expect to make money for them OR to be out of the business fairly quickly.  Art for arts sake or films for whyever you want to make them is great if that's what you want to do - as long as you are independently wealthy or have a rich and doting lover/parent/grandparent or similar.  Otherwise, you make them to get more money than they cost you to make.",2,Give him a break?,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,1291,"['offense', 'fans', 'film', 'Reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'give', 'auteur/author', 'break', 'are', 'made', 'evaluate', 'item', 'others', 'have', 'fair', 'idea', 'what', 'prior', 'spending', 'hard', 'earned', 'more', 'so', 'less', 'great', 'times', 'money', 'one', 'fault', 'producer', 'film/book/whatever', 'not', 'meet', 'wishes/needs', 'supposed', 'be', 'aimed', 'Complaining', 'who', 'feel', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'needs', 'rather', 'bad', 'form', 'Instead', 'help', 'filmmaker', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'films', 'audience', 'wants.Re', 'teaching', 'students', 'media', 'production', 'class', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'tell', 'When', 'get', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'free', 'make', 'films', 'want', 'time', 'have', 'money', 'required', 'make', 'can', 'get', 'others', 'willing', 'let', 'make', 'film', 'way', 'rely', 'others', 'funds', 'had', 'better', 'expect', 'make', 'money', 'OR', 'be', 'business', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Art', 'arts', 'sake', 'films', 'whyever', 'want', 'make', 'great', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'independently', 'wealthy', 'have', 'rich', 'doting', 'lover/parent/grandparent', 'similar', 'Otherwise', 'make', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'cost', 'make']",N/A
