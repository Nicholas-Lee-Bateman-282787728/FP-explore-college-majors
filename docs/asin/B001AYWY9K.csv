1169117,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B001AYWY9K,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[7, 8]","Life is a loud, noisy Hell, isn't it? Hmmmm... correction, life in New York City is a loud, noisy Hell? How do I know it? Well... I happen to be in New York City as I am writing this and, from my 15th floor hotel suite I can hear the loud police and ambulance sirens, the garbage trucks, the horns, the occasional helicopter and, louder than them all was Noise, the movie which I just watched.The cast:- Tim Robbins: the superhero, the Rectifier. Not quite getting Hegel, because he's constantly disturbed by car alarms. Tim does everything within and without the law to get things quieter and car alarms banned.- William Baldwin: the mayor's... something. It's not clear why he's in this movie but he's another name added to a rather prestigious cast.- William Hurt: the mayor himself. He seems to be 'pro noise' but we don't know why because he plays a rather small part too.- Bridget Moynahan: Tim's semi-Russian not-girlfriend, about to leave for London to study philosophy. She has a pretty good understanding of Hegelian dialectics.- many others: Tim's wife, his kid daughter, judges, cops, New YorkersThe main message seems to be that we should be mad as Hell (see above) and that we shouldn't take it any more but we don't because we're like sheep or cattle strolling into the slaughter house and little can be done to fix things except maybe getting a court order (clever). And, of course, the movie is supposed to be funny. There are secondary themes and digressions but the movie should be seen so I won't be going into any more details.In the end, after 90 minutes of constant anti-noise pleas and loud demonstrations I could not help but ask myself 'why?'. The movie does have its funny moments and noise pollution in New York is real but, somehow, I was left with the impression that someone really, really wanted to throw a lot of talent into a semi-low budget movie discussing an issue that was socially-responsible but not too controversial so... how about 'noise'?After a lot of thinking following my watching 'Noise', I now agree that noise, especially noise produced by car alarms is annoying. I also agree that we, New Yorkers, should never again behave like sheep and we should do something about loud car alarms. But... wait. I am NOT a New Yorker. In fact, I'll be leaving New York tomorrow. However, if anyone wants me to sign some anti-noise petition... I'll think about it.Final thoughts: Tim Robbins is a good actor and Bridget Moynahan is a fresh face. They both performed well. Noise is okay to watch on a movie channel or as a rental if nothing else worth watching is available. On the other hand, I doubt that Tim Robbins, William Hurt or William Baldwin would consider 'Noise' as a significant achievement in their careers. Three stars as in 'okay but...' seems to be fair.",3,"A quiet riot, sort of",1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,2806,"['Life', 'loud', 'noisy', 'Hell', ""n't"", 'Hmmmm', 'correction', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'loud', 'noisy', 'Hell', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'Well', 'happen', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'am', 'writing', '15th', 'floor', 'hotel', 'suite', 'can', 'hear', 'loud', 'police', 'ambulance', 'sirens', 'garbage', 'trucks', 'horns', 'occasional', 'helicopter', 'louder', 'was', 'Noise', 'movie', 'just', 'watched.The', 'cast', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'superhero', 'Rectifier', 'Not', 'quite', 'getting', 'Hegel', 'constantly', 'disturbed', 'car', 'alarms', 'Tim', 'everything', 'law', 'get', 'things', 'quieter', 'car', 'alarms', 'banned.-', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'mayor', 'something', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'movie', 'name', 'added', 'rather', 'prestigious', 'cast.-', 'William', 'Hurt', 'mayor', 'be', ""'pro"", 'noise', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'rather', 'small', 'part', 'too.-', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Tim', 'semi-Russian', 'not-girlfriend', 'leave', 'London', 'study', 'philosophy', 'pretty', 'good', 'understanding', 'Hegelian', 'dialectics.-', 'many', 'others', 'Tim', 'wife', 'kid', 'daughter', 'judges', 'cops', 'New', 'YorkersThe', 'main', 'message', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'mad', 'Hell', 'see', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'like', 'sheep', 'cattle', 'strolling', 'slaughter', 'house', 'little', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'fix', 'things', 'maybe', 'getting', 'court', 'order', 'clever', 'course', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'are', 'secondary', 'themes', 'digressions', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'going', 'more', 'end', '90', 'minutes', 'constant', 'anti-noise', 'pleas', 'loud', 'demonstrations', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'ask', 'movie', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'noise', 'pollution', 'New', 'York', 'real', 'somehow', 'was', 'left', 'impression', 'someone', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'throw', 'lot', 'talent', 'semi-low', 'budget', 'movie', 'discussing', 'issue', 'was', 'socially-responsible', 'not', 'too', 'controversial', 'so', 'how', ""'noise"", 'lot', 'thinking', 'following', 'watching', ""'Noise"", 'now', 'agree', 'noise', 'especially', 'noise', 'produced', 'car', 'alarms', 'annoying', 'also', 'agree', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'should', 'never', 'again', 'behave', 'sheep', 'should', 'do', 'something', 'loud', 'car', 'alarms', 'wait', 'am', 'NOT', 'New', 'Yorker', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'be', 'leaving', 'New', 'York', 'tomorrow', 'However', 'anyone', 'sign', 'anti-noise', 'petition', ""'ll"", 'think', 'it.Final', 'thoughts', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'good', 'actor', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'fresh', 'face', 'performed', 'well', 'Noise', 'okay', 'watch', 'movie', 'channel', 'rental', 'nothing', 'else', 'worth', 'watching', 'available', 'other', 'hand', 'doubt', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'William', 'Hurt', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'would', 'consider', ""'Noise"", 'significant', 'achievement', 'careers', 'Three', 'stars', ""'okay"", 'be', 'fair']",Noise

Robbins plays alawyer that is constantly annoyed with the noise of living in New York city. Added on top of the stresses of his home life and work, Robbins begins to take the fight to the source, becoming a high profile vandal known as the Rectefier. His attacks on his foe draw the ire of the mayor of New York City, and the battle between them for Robbins sanity follows a variety of interesting turns.Robbins acting in this is top notch, supported by several smaller names, most of whom held their weight, but was nearly poisoned by a few parts that felt overblown and outrageous.There are quite a few scenes that feel drastically out of place, and Robbins tailspin marriage and separated affair feels a bit overdone, almost to the point of softcore pornography.

Tim Robbins plays David, a man who is so distracted by the noise surrounding him in New York city that he cannot live a normal life.  His solution, to become the Rectifier, a vigilante sneak who gives people with those darn car alarms exactly what they deserve no matter what the cost.This movie was hilarious, if a bit sad at times.  This is not an action film but David nonetheless sees himself as a superhero of sorts.  In typical superhero style he has to loose everything to become the vigilante he wants to be.  The difference this time is losing it is his choice, kind of.Where the movie started to fail a little bit was when David's new love interest talks him into trying to get legislation against noise put into place.  This is a bit weird, and the movie takes itself a bit too seriously.Still as a dry, dark comedy this movie had me and my husband in stitches most of the time.  Just don't take it too seriously or try to get a message out of it.  If you need some sort of significant question to ponder from this movie it would be broader than the topics investigated in the movie.  I guess it would be this, ""What would happen if people stopped tolerating every annoyance they deal with in a day and started to really do something about?""

Their daughter is a product of their mutual and genuine love for each other and everything seems fine until one day during his wife's home rehearsal of the cello piece her husband gets annoyed by a car alarm.  It does not stop there.  Suddenly car alarms are everywhere waking up his young daughter in the late hours of the night, disturbing lovemaking between him and his wife.  It all escalates when one day our hero is caught by a police breaking into a car in order to shut off the car alarm by disabling the car battery.  His life seems to spiral from there on; first, he is fined for damage, then he is kicked out of the house by his wife and finally he looses his job.  Without family, job and in the new apartment, all that is left is to fight noises in the NYC.  Our hero becoimes known as a ""Rectifier"" (very funny!), man who takes on single handedly car alarms in the city, until the mayor decides that this battle is personal.  William Hurt is fantastic in his role of a mayor who is more concerned about being liked by his constituents than doing the right thing.  I loved the part of the movie where Robins vandalizes car  in a manner of their alarm tune - each swing corresponds to the tune of the alarm.  Robbins is funny, sexy adn totaly likable in his role.

Car alarms that go off in the middle of the night, or when he's trying to put his colicky baby to sleep, or when he's making love to his wife, or when he's just this close to grasping a particularly dense passage in a treatise by Hegel.  After years of putting up with this ubiquitous urban din and vainly pleading with the authorities to do something about it, David finally resorts to vigilantism, smashing out the windows and dismantling the alarms of the offending vehicles, even going so far as to leave a calling card in his wake identifying himself as The Rectifier.  Soon the mysterious noise-fighter has achieved near folk-hero status among his fellow Manhattanites and become a true thorn-in-the-side to the city's unctuous mayor, played amusingly by William Hurt.Sort of a dark comic, upscale version of ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Noise"" is a rage-against-the-machine fantasy that chooses as its target the relentless cacophony of city life.  David, who's a successful attorney in his day job, isn't quite as off the rails as Travis Bickle, but there are times when his obsessiveness begins to border on the psychotic.  Is David suffering from mental illness or is he simply acting out against the impotency and inadequacy he feels in all areas of his life?  Or does he just get off on hating and being angry all the time?  Whatever the underlying psychological reason, once he establishes himself as The Rectifier, David develops a whole new outlook on life.  And who among us can't identify at least to some extent with David`s frustration, for don't we all have something that forever gets under our skin and that we would do just about anything we could to get it to stop?  David just happens to be the one person to actually act on that impulse.Written and directed by Henry Bean, ""Noise"" is a satire of metropolitan neuroticism performed in a minor key.  Tim Robbins carries the film with his understated portrait of a man wound up so tight that he threatens at any moment to completely unravel.  He receives solid support from Bridget Moynihan as the wife who can't understand why the man she married has suddenly turned into a raving lunatic, and Margarita Levieva as an attractive newspaper reporter who uncovers The Rectifier's true identity and wants to explore what really makes this explosive man-of-the-people figure ""tick.""The humor isn't always as uproarious as it could be, but everyone, not just city-dwellers, should find something to appreciate in David Owens' amusingly extended rant.",3,"Honk your horn for ""Noise""",1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,2616,"['***1/2David', 'Owen', 'as', 'mad', 'hell', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'anymore', 'What', 's', 'mad', 'car', 'alarms', 'Car', 'alarms', 'go', 'off', 'middle', 'night', 'when', 'trying', 'put', 'colicky', 'baby', 'sleep', 'when', 'making', 'love', 'wife', 'when', 'just', 'close', 'grasping', 'particularly', 'dense', 'passage', 'treatise', 'Hegel', 'years', 'putting', 'up', 'ubiquitous', 'urban', 'din', 'vainly', 'pleading', 'authorities', 'do', 'something', 'David', 'finally', 'vigilantism', 'smashing', 'out', 'windows', 'dismantling', 'alarms', 'offending', 'vehicles', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'leave', 'calling', 'card', 'wake', 'identifying', 'Rectifier', 'Soon', 'mysterious', 'noise-fighter', 'achieved', 'folk-hero', 'status', 'fellow', 'Manhattanites', 'become', 'true', 'thorn-in-the-side', 'city', 'unctuous', 'mayor', 'played', 'amusingly', 'William', 'Hurt.Sort', 'dark', 'comic', 'upscale', 'version', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Noise', 'rage-against-the-machine', 'fantasy', 'target', 'relentless', 'cacophony', 'city', 'life', 'David', 'who', 'successful', 'attorney', 'day', 'job', ""n't"", 'quite', 'off', 'rails', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'obsessiveness', 'border', 'psychotic', 'David', 'suffering', 'mental', 'illness', 'simply', 'acting', 'out', 'impotency', 'inadequacy', 'areas', 'life', 'just', 'get', 'off', 'hating', 'being', 'angry', 'time', 'underlying', 'psychological', 'reason', 'once', 'Rectifier', 'David', 'whole', 'new', 'outlook', 'life', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'least', 'extent', 'David', 's', 'frustration', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'something', 'forever', 'skin', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'could', 'get', 'stop', 'David', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'actually', 'act', 'impulse.Written', 'directed', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'Noise', 'satire', 'metropolitan', 'neuroticism', 'performed', 'minor', 'key', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'film', 'understated', 'portrait', 'man', 'up', 'so', 'tight', 'moment', 'completely', 'unravel', 'solid', 'support', 'Bridget', 'Moynihan', 'wife', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'man', 'married', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'attractive', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'Rectifier', 'true', 'identity', 'explore', 'what', 'really', 'explosive', 'man-of-the-people', 'figure', 'tick', 'humor', ""n't"", 'always', 'as', 'uproarious', 'could', 'be', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'city-dwellers', 'should', 'find', 'something', 'appreciate', 'David', 'Owens', 'amusingly', 'extended', 'rant']",Noise

He gets out of jail and maintains his quest.I enjoyed the way the movie ended, that was genius and entertaining, however the rest of the movie was not.

1169130,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B001AYWY9K,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","Who can't identify with the harried, frazzled, infuriated protagonist of this film? Car alarms, back-up beepers, inane cellphone chatter -- we're all drowning in a surfeit of noise, and the overall quality of life degrades around us incessantly as a result. But what can we do about it?Well, David Owen (a wonderfully frustrated, about-to-erupt Tim Robbins) has the solution. In the guise of The Rectifier, he smashes into cars with yawping car alarms & shuts them off, leaving a small card with his symbol. Needless to say, this gets him in trouble with the law -- but an arrest or two isn't about to stop him in his seemingly quixotic crusade.Simply developed as a comedy, this would be a successful film. But writer/director Henry Bean takes it further, adding some rough edges & interesting layers of texture with Owen's personal life, philosophical musings, and reflections on the nature of contemporary life. Not all of this works -- I'd like to have seen some of it developed at greater length, while other threads seem to drift off into limbo entirely -- but it does take what might have been a competent but predictable premise into more challenging territory.I'd be remiss if I didn't single out William Hurt's performance as the smarmy, self-satisfied blowhard of a mayor. You just want to smack him or kick him down the stairs! His eventual comeuppance is one of the more satisfying examples of poetic justice I've seen in a long time.The film appeared & disappeared all too quickly, but I think it has genuine cult potential, much like ""Office Space."" Both films have something worthwhile & even sobering to say about everyday life in America, sweetened just a bit with comedy.Meanwhile, stop & think about the last time you enjoyed real silence, a space without intrusion by banality & stupidity & noise. You just might realize how precious & rare those times are, and just how much we need them. And if you're driven to take action of some sort ... more than a few of us will understand completely!",4,Sound off!,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,2013,"['Who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'harried', 'frazzled', 'infuriated', 'protagonist', 'film', 'Car', 'alarms', 'back-up', 'beepers', 'inane', 'cellphone', 'chatter', ""'re"", 'drowning', 'surfeit', 'noise', 'overall', 'quality', 'life', 'degrades', 'incessantly', 'result', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Well', 'David', 'Owen', 'wonderfully', 'frustrated', 'about-to-erupt', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'solution', 'guise', 'Rectifier', 'cars', 'yawping', 'car', 'alarms', 'shuts', 'off', 'leaving', 'small', 'card', 'symbol', 'Needless', 'say', 'trouble', 'law', 'arrest', 'two', ""n't"", 'about', 'stop', 'seemingly', 'quixotic', 'crusade.Simply', 'developed', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'successful', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'further', 'adding', 'rough', 'edges', 'interesting', 'layers', 'texture', 'Owen', 'personal', 'life', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'reflections', 'nature', 'contemporary', 'life', 'Not', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'developed', 'greater', 'length', 'other', 'threads', 'seem', 'drift', 'off', 'limbo', 'entirely', 'take', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'competent', 'predictable', 'premise', 'more', 'challenging', 'territory.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'single', 'out', 'William', 'Hurt', 'performance', 'smarmy', 'self-satisfied', 'blowhard', 'mayor', 'just', 'want', 'smack', 'kick', 'down', 'stairs', 'eventual', 'comeuppance', 'one', 'more', 'satisfying', 'examples', 'poetic', 'justice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'film', 'appeared', 'disappeared', 'too', 'quickly', 'think', 'genuine', 'cult', 'potential', 'much', 'Office', 'Space', 'films', 'have', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'even', 'sobering', 'say', 'everyday', 'life', 'America', 'sweetened', 'just', 'bit', 'comedy.Meanwhile', 'stop', 'think', 'last', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'real', 'silence', 'space', 'intrusion', 'banality', 'stupidity', 'noise', 'just', 'might', 'realize', 'how', 'precious', 'rare', 'times', 'are', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'need', ""'re"", 'driven', 'take', 'action', 'sort', 'more', 'few', 'will', 'understand', 'completely']",Noise
