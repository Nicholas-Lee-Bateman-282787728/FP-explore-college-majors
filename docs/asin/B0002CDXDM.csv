So says the guy in charge of the ""Horsemasters"" course.  This is foreshadowing.  Even a person who has never seen a movie before will probably guess that this perception will be corrected soon, once the course begins.Plot: EIght youngish adults, including Annette Funicello, are chosen to participate in the prestigious ""Horsemasters"" course of the title. This takes place in England.  They learn horsemanship.  They learn riding.  They learn life lessons.  They flirt.  That's pretty much it.Warning: This is a Disney movie.  Therefore: All the fun is strictly G-rated. So is any romance.  People burst randomly into song, though not too often.  It's not a musical.Other pros - at least if you're a horseperson - Everyone wears hats and boots when mounted.  Safety procedures around the horses are stressed.  I mention this only because so many horse movies have riders galloping through the fields with their hair flowing and other major infractions.  The hard hats are pretty flimsy by today's standards but at least they're worn.The actors spend most of their screentime on horseback, either doing dressage, stadium jumping or going cross-country  At the end, there's a hunt race competition followed by a hunt.  The horses are cute, especially the pinto.  There's also some cool aerial shots of the horses jumping (usually they're filmed from the ground).  If you have a couple hours to kill before your riding lesson, you could do worse than watch this film.",5,G-rated fun for horse crazy youngsters,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,1559,"['come', 'world', 'think', 'know', 'Emphasis', 'think', 'So', 'guy', 'charge', 'Horsemasters', 'course', 'foreshadowing', 'Even', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'guess', 'perception', 'will', 'be', 'corrected', 'soon', 'once', 'course', 'begins.Plot', 'EIght', 'youngish', 'adults', 'including', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'are', 'chosen', 'participate', 'prestigious', 'Horsemasters', 'course', 'title', 'place', 'England', 'learn', 'horsemanship', 'learn', 'riding', 'learn', 'life', 'lessons', 'flirt', 'pretty', 'much', 'it.Warning', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'fun', 'strictly', 'G-rated', 'So', 'romance', 'People', 'burst', 'randomly', 'song', 'not', 'too', 'often', 'not', 'musical.Other', 'pros', 'least', ""'re"", 'horseperson', 'Everyone', 'hats', 'boots', 'when', 'mounted', 'Safety', 'procedures', 'horses', 'are', 'stressed', 'mention', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'horse', 'movies', 'have', 'riders', 'galloping', 'fields', 'hair', 'flowing', 'other', 'major', 'infractions', 'hard', 'hats', 'are', 'pretty', 'flimsy', 'today', 'standards', 'least', ""'re"", 'worn.The', 'actors', 'spend', 'most', 'screentime', 'horseback', 'doing', 'dressage', 'stadium', 'jumping', 'going', 'cross-country', 'end', 'hunt', 'race', 'competition', 'followed', 'hunt', 'horses', 'are', 'cute', 'especially', 'pinto', 'also', 'cool', 'aerial', 'shots', 'horses', 'jumping', 'usually', ""'re"", 'filmed', 'ground', 'have', 'couple', 'hours', 'kill', 'riding', 'lesson', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'watch', 'film']",The Horsemasters
830148,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B0002CDXDM,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[3, 5]","I bought this movie on VHS because I am a life-long Annette Fan who is filling out his collection. I never saw this movie when it was originally released because it was only released theatrically in Europe. Here in the U.S.A.,the movie was shown on ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" and that's the presentation you get here. In those days, most families had only one TV and that TV was usually B&W. I imagine my folks wanted to see ""Bonanza"". This is one of only two movies where Annette gets top billing, the other being ""How to stuff a Wild Bikini"". (When she worked with Frankie Avalon, his name came first.) That is, she would get top billing if there had been any billing. This movie opens with the Title only. Credits don't appear until the end. Annette is lovely here in color with her hair naturally dark and her big brown eyes in strict contrast to all the English actors and actresses in this movie. We're supposed to be in England. Maybe it's a backlot. Quite frankly, this movie bored me to tears and I had to fast forward through much of it. If you like horses, riding acadamies, fox hunts and things of that nature, you may enjoy it. Personally, I couldn't care less about dressage and riding to the hounds. The cast includes Tommy Kirk, Janet Munro and several people whom while mostly older than Annette had yet to make their mark in a big way: Donald Pleasance ""The Man in the Glass Booth"", a very young Jean Marsh ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". I find it very interesting that the person you can't keep your eyes off is Annette! She definitely had presence and Star Quality and you can see it here in a movie made when she was perhaps 18 years old. Of course, Annette sings a song near the end,: ""Strummin' Song"" written by the Sherman Bros. Annette hands the song over midway to a red-haired Englishwoman. I wondered who that woman could be? I scanned the closing credits and it's none other that West End/Broadway stage star Millicent Martin! (Side by side by Sondheim). Still aside from the footage of Annette and the trivia, this movie doesn't have much going for it in my opinion. Annette herself, who never has an unkind word for anyone has written in her book that making this movie was an unpleasant experience. It seems that her horse (Annette is a horsewoman) did't take to her and threw her for real several times. Also, the director was unkind to her, referring to her as ""Mr.Disney's Pet"". If that director reads this, in my opinion his movie stinks and he is a bum! So, there! I give this movie One Star for Annette alone and a combined one star for everyone else's lame efforts.",2,Annette goes to a Riding Academy,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,2611,"['bought', 'movie', 'VHS', 'am', 'life-long', 'Annette', 'Fan', 'who', 'filling', 'out', 'collection', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'was', 'only', 'released', 'theatrically', 'Europe', 'Here', 'U.S.A.', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'presentation', 'get', 'here', 'days', 'most', 'families', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'TV', 'TV', 'was', 'usually', 'B', 'W', 'imagine', 'folks', 'wanted', 'see', 'Bonanza', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'where', 'Annette', 'top', 'billing', 'other', 'being', 'How', 'stuff', 'Wild', 'Bikini', 'When', 'worked', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'name', 'came', 'first', 'would', 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'had', 'been', 'billing', 'movie', 'Title', 'only', 'Credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'end', 'Annette', 'lovely', 'here', 'color', 'hair', 'naturally', 'dark', 'big', 'brown', 'eyes', 'strict', 'contrast', 'English', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movie', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'England', 'Maybe', 'backlot', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'movie', 'bored', 'tears', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'much', 'like', 'horses', 'riding', 'acadamies', 'fox', 'hunts', 'things', 'nature', 'may', 'enjoy', 'Personally', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'dressage', 'riding', 'hounds', 'cast', 'Tommy', 'Kirk', 'Janet', 'Munro', 'several', 'people', 'whom', 'mostly', 'older', 'Annette', 'had', 'yet', 'make', 'mark', 'big', 'way', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'Man', 'Glass', 'Booth', 'very', 'young', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'off', 'Annette', 'definitely', 'had', 'presence', 'Star', 'Quality', 'can', 'see', 'here', 'movie', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'perhaps', '18', 'years', 'old', 'course', 'Annette', 'song', 'end', 'Strummin', 'Song', 'written', 'Sherman', 'Bros.', 'Annette', 'song', 'midway', 'red-haired', 'Englishwoman', 'wondered', 'who', 'woman', 'could', 'be', 'scanned', 'closing', 'credits', 'none', 'other', 'West', 'End/Broadway', 'stage', 'star', 'Millicent', 'Martin', 'Side', 'side', 'Sondheim', 'Still', 'aside', 'footage', 'Annette', 'trivia', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'opinion', 'Annette', 'who', 'never', 'unkind', 'word', 'anyone', 'written', 'book', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'horse', 'Annette', 'horsewoman', ""did't"", 'take', 'threw', 'real', 'several', 'times', 'Also', 'director', 'was', 'unkind', 'referring', 'Mr.Disney', 'Pet', 'director', 'opinion', 'movie', 'stinks', 'bum', 'So', 'give', 'movie', 'One', 'Star', 'Annette', 'alone', 'combined', 'one', 'star', 'everyone', 'else', 'lame', 'efforts']",The Horsemasters
