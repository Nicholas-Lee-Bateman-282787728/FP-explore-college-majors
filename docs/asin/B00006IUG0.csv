Still, if you enjoy the hunt for an adequate sperm count, I suppose this could become your classic. I found it tacky, but there has to be one person who was not overwhelmed, and I guess that was me.

You can even make a movie that makes it almost comprehensible.  Now, &quot;Men With Brooms&quot; shows that you can make a good and funny movie about another boring sport: curling.While no one will be nominating &quot;Men With Brooms&quot; for any awards, it's a surprisingly watchable, funny movie that follows the good, old-fashioned 'reunite the underdogs' sports movie formula with a bit of &quot;Red Green&quot;esque Canadian men making gentle fun of themselves.  Sadly, I think it never saw an American release, but its worth adding to anyone's collection of funny sports movies.Even the performances in this movie break above the usual sports/romantic comedy level.  Paul Gross (who I have sadly never seen in &quot;Due South&quot;) plays a convincingly cynical sports star come home to small-town Ontario.  Leslie Nielsen breaks typecast for a crotchety, but still-funny former curling star, and Bob Bainborough (Dalton Humphrey on &quot;Red Green&quot;) steals his scenes as a curling announcer reminiscent of a less-grating Bob Uecker in &quot;Major League&quot;.I recommend this movie for sports nuts, romantic comedy fans, and people with a soft spot for Canadian humor.

Mitchell ""dedicated romantic""","[6, 6]","I was intrigued by the curling event at the last winter Olympics, but I didn't go out of my way to see Men with Brooms for several years.  To think that I wasted all that time.  This is a very funny romantic comedy and it taught me a great deal about the sport of curling.  I loved the soundtrack, the herd? of beavers, the clever dialog, the romance, the peek at Canadian life, and the tight storyline. Paul Gross did a great job directing this movie and acting one of the principal roles. I highly recommend that everyone go on and see some of his other work: Due South (this TV series is where I started - a very funny story of a Canadian mountie who moves to Chicago with his wolf to find his father's killer and stays to help the Chicago police), Slings and Arrows (a great comedy TV series about a Shakespearean festival theatre in Canada with a ghost, several love stories, quirky actors, backstage drama, and a heartless business manager. As a side benefit, I learned a lot about Shakespeare's plays and how to appreciate them.), Passchendaele (a beautifully filmed story of Canadians in a World War I battle and a love story related to it), Getting Married in Buffalo Jump (a terrific love story with a great deal of depth, set on an Alberta ranch), and H2O & it's sequel, Trojan Horse (I haven't seen H2O yet, but Trojan Horse is a wonderfully tense political drama involving the merging of Canada and the United States and centering on a Presidential election where you really don't know who the good guys are).",5,Paul Gross rules,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1522,"['was', 'intrigued', 'curling', 'event', 'last', 'winter', 'Olympics', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'way', 'see', 'Men', 'Brooms', 'several', 'years', 'think', 'wasted', 'time', 'very', 'funny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'taught', 'great', 'deal', 'sport', 'curling', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'herd', 'beavers', 'clever', 'dialog', 'romance', 'peek', 'Canadian', 'life', 'tight', 'storyline', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'acting', 'one', 'principal', 'roles', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'go', 'see', 'other', 'work', 'Due', 'South', 'TV', 'series', 'where', 'started', 'very', 'funny', 'story', 'Canadian', 'mountie', 'who', 'Chicago', 'wolf', 'find', 'father', 'killer', 'help', 'Chicago', 'police', 'Slings', 'Arrows', 'great', 'comedy', 'TV', 'series', 'Shakespearean', 'festival', 'theatre', 'Canada', 'ghost', 'several', 'love', 'stories', 'quirky', 'actors', 'backstage', 'drama', 'heartless', 'business', 'manager', 'side', 'benefit', 'learned', 'lot', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'how', 'appreciate', 'Passchendaele', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'story', 'Canadians', 'World', 'War', 'battle', 'love', 'story', 'related', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Buffalo', 'Jump', 'terrific', 'love', 'story', 'great', 'deal', 'depth', 'set', 'Alberta', 'ranch', 'H2O', 'sequel', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'H2O', 'yet', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'wonderfully', 'tense', 'political', 'drama', 'involving', 'merging', 'Canada', 'United', 'States', 'centering', 'Presidential', 'election', 'where', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'are']",N/A

717097,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00006IUG0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Let me tell you, nothing gets me up like the sport of curling. I go nuts with the foam finger and the thunder stick whenever I tune in to a curling match. Just watching the 42-pound granite stone wending its way down the ice sheet, its course being affected by brooms, in an effort to get into the house and as close as it can to the button, well, it's just something that's fraught with intensity and poetry.Okay, so I don't know what I'm talking about. Before this film, I knew nothing about curling. When I popped MEN WITH BROOMS in the dvd player, I was expecting something along the lines ofDodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Unrated Edition)or Balls of Fury since I figured curling to be as equally ignored and trivialized as dodgeball and table tennis are in these parts and would probably be also only televised on ESPN the Ocho. I did have a notion that MEN WITH BROOMS would be more clever and would resonate more. And it was, and it did. MEN WITH BROOMS is a winning Canadian picture, bolstered by a fine cast of Canadian actors, a sensitive yet hilarious story, and featuring as its centerpiece a sport which actually becomes interesting within the film's context, although I doubt I'll be going out of my way to cheer on this event in the Olympics.The death of a kindly curling coach reunites his four messed-up proteges, including that sunuvacanadian Chris Cutter (Paul Gross). Chris, a gifted skip (curling team captain & strategist), had ten years ago abandoned his sport, his teammates, his tiny town of Long Bay, and his girlfriend, who happens to be Coach Foley's daughter and now an astronaut. The coach's last wish was for his remnants to be cremated and placed in a curling stone, and that stone be used to win the local curling tournament and regain the Golden Broom trophy. The rest of the film shows how Chris and his teammates (a drug dealer, a mortician, and a husband with a low sperm count) try to get their act together and do the dead guy proud. Also, there are beavers.I've come to believe that whenever Paul Gross is involved in a project, that project instantly becomes credible and something worth experiencing.Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)andSlings & Arrows - Season 1are two fine examples. I'm not sure how many people know of Paul Gross, but he's big and very bankable in maple leaf territory. And he's got large talent. Gross wears several hats in MEN WITH BROOMS. Here he acts, he writes, and he directs. He does all these well.The picture enlists the services of striking actress Molly Parker and Gross's buddy Leslie Nielsen (of NAKED GUN fame and who guest-starred a bunch of times in DUE SOUTH), and they're invaluable. Molly soulfully plays Amy, the sister of Chris's ex-girlfriend, who for years has been secretly in love with Chris. Nielsen strays from typecasting and takes on the dark, ornery role of Chris's estranged dad and new coach. Basically, the cast is Canadian and therefore funny. The actors playing Chris's teammates are lovable and off the wall, from the clueless Eddie, to the henpecked Neil, to the shameless bon vivant Lennox. I also laughed at some of the stuff spouted by the game announcer amidst his beer-swilling (""That shot was impossible once - so, to do it again, mathematically, it's gotta be...twice as impossible!""). There were moments when I thought I was listening to Bob Eucker in MAJOR LEAGUE. Also worth a heads up: Canadian group The Tragically Hip provides two new songs, as well as a cameo appearance.What is curling? I could say it resembles the game of shuffleboard, but then people might ask, ""Well, and what's shuffleboard?"" I've since learned that curling is also called the roaring game (nicknamed so for the sound the stone makes as it travels the breadth of the ice). The game possibly originates from Scotland in the 16th century (although that's all up for debate). The brooms? The sweeping of the brooms causes friction and heating on ice which helps to determine the stone's direction and speed. And regarding the rules and complexities of the game, I quote from the film: ""Each team has 8 rocks. Each guy throws two. When all the rocks are thrown, whoever has their rock closest to the button, that team gets the points."" See, simple (But, here we go again: ""What's a button?""). Anyway, don't let the unfamiliar terminology or the initial inexplicability of curling stop you from watching this one. The movie does a good job of filling you in enough so that you can sit back and relax.The bonus extras? Not much here. There's a 4 and a half minute interview with Paul Gross (in which he doesn't talk about this film but does go into what made him want to be an actor and he also touches on Due South), a 5 minute featurette, and the theatrical trailer. Also, there are outtakes during the end credits.I might make fun of curling, but the film doesn't make the error of doing the same. MEN IN BROOMS is never less than sincere and affectionate in its treatment of the sport, which is wise because, apparently, Canadians are excellent curlers. I think this film is worth 4 stars: one, because it has Paul Gross; two, because I love underdog sports cinema; and three, because MEN WITH BROOMS is well-done, funny, quirky, and touching.Now, if only there's a good sports film out there about shuffleboard.",4,"""It's not the size of the army, it's the fury of its onslaught.""",1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,5305,"['Let', 'tell', 'nothing',

717098,ARI1LNCQQUM74,B00006IUG0,Heather M. Dumdei,"[30, 30]","A bunch of friends and I found this movie in an attempt to have a movie night of &quot;non-sport&quot; sport movies. We thought, &quot;Surely, a Canadian movie about curling made by and starring the star of ASPEN EXTREME and featuring Leslie Nielsen will have to be so bad, it'll amaze us.&quot; Well, we were amazed, but not by its badness. It wasn't what I would call a genuinely amazing movie, either. I guess it was amazing in how NOT bad it was. Paul Gross and company do trot out many of the underdog sports movie clich&eacute;s but always with just the faintest hint of tongue-in-cheek to keep the viewer from feeling like it's just another silly sports movie. Leslie Nielsen is also a nice touch. He gets to exercise his straight comedic talents for a change, and I personally think he's much more interesting when he does.

Near the beginning too many of the scenes were non-sequitors, leaving me with no clue what relevence they had to any previous scene. The characters were too complex to the point of seeming schitzophrenic. I constantly had to adjust the volume because the music was too loud and the dialogue was too quiet or slurred. I just generally had a hard time working out the details of what was going on in a lot of the early scenes. Of the parts of the film that did make sense, there were a few charming quirky moments, but the balance was shifted more towards dull, dark drama with a distinct film festival feel. There was some good music in the film. The parody curling rival in his silver suit could have been used to much greater comedic effect with some dialogue and facial expressions, but instead he's just presented as the goofy guy in the suit, and then becomes part of the scenery. It's a minor complaint but it's representative of the half-assed approach applied to a lot of the film. The competitive sporting element failed to engage me, it just made me wish I was watching The Mighty Ducks instead. It's hard to believe that the brooms actually have any effect on the trajectory of the curling stones. There are lots of shots of frantic sweeping, but it doesn't draw you into the competitive action because it doesn't look like it's doing anything.

So what is it about sports movies that always gets me? I don't know. Well, okay, I do in this case. I worship the ground Molly Parker walks on and will watch her in anything, even a movie about curling. Yes, curling, that odd Scots sport where you throw a rock and direct men with brooms to sweep the ground in front of it in various ways. I hadn't read any reviews of the movie before watching it, so I didn't know what the popular feeling about this movie was. I have done so since, and it seems that I'm quite in the minority on this, but I loved it.The story concerns a curling team who dispersed a decade before on the cusp of winning the Golden Broom after team captain Chris Cutter (Paul Gross of the much-beloved TV series Due South) flaked out and walked off the ice. On the death of their old coach, Donald Foley (The Changeling's James B. Douglas), the four get together with Foley's family for the reading of his will, and he charges them to reunite and win the trophy. And thus Lennox, Eddie Strombeck (Jed Rees, recently seen in The Ringer), Neil Bucyk (James Allido of Glitter), and James Lennox (Peter Outerbridge, previously paired with Parker in the amazing Kissed) are back together and on the ice. There's also a subplot about Cutter and his father (Leslie Nielsen), whom they decide to recruit as a coach, and one about Cutter and Foley's two daughters-- Julie(Michelle Nolden, soon to be seen in the upcoming adatation of All Hat), who Cutter left when he left town a decade previously, and Amy (Parker), a recovering alcoholic who's been carrying a torch for Cutter all their lives.Yes, it's all predictable. Yes, the dialogue could've used some work. Yes, the jokes are generally cheap. And yes, I realized the whole time I was being shamelessly manipulated. And I didn't care. I got to know these characters, even through all of the movie's flaws, and I got to be friends with them. And to me, that made it worthwhile. It's a minor movie, but it's a damn good minor movie.

""When you think about it, it's sort of bizarre--beaver, maple leaf. There is an oddball quality to it that is both noble, melancholy and laughable all at the same time, and I think that there is something really wonderful in that."" Which pretty much sums up ""Men With Brooms,"" a quirky Canadian comedy that sweeps audiences off its feet (bad curling pun intended).If ""Men With Brooms"" suffers from one particular ailment, it would be that it tries to be a number of different films rolled into one: a love story, a buddy film, a curling documentary of sorts, the quintessential Canadian comedy. But the strength of its original script and ensemble cast really shines. Big name Canadian talent includes Paul Gross (""Due South,"" ""Hamlet"" at Stratford), Molly Parker (""Five Senses,"" ""Rare Birds,"") and Leslie Nielsen (""Due South,"" ""Airplane,"" ""Naked Gun""), although all of the actors do a fantastic job.The basic premise is that Donald Foley, the beloved coach of the Long Bay, Ontario curling team has just died, and in his videotaped will he wants the team to reunite and attempt to win the Golden Broom, the most prestigious award in curling. The skip, Chris Cutter, left town ten years ago after losing an important game and leaving his fianc&eacute;e Julie, Donald's daughter, standing at the altar. Now he has to attempt the impossible by reuniting his old teammates (a drug dealer, a mortician in a lifeless marriage, and a frustrated husband with a single-digit sperm count) and attempting to win the Golden Broom, as well with making peace with his father (Leslie Neilsen), Julie and himself.In the ""quirky Canadian comedy"" tradition &agrave; la ""Rare Birds,"" ""Shipping News,"" and yes, ""Strange Brew,"" ""Men With Brooms"" exalts the quirky charm of the Canadian character. This is evident from the film's opening scene, which pans from a gorgeous shot of the Canadian wilderness to an avant-garde bagpiper (who makes several appearances throughout the film) and a whole lotta computer-generated beavers (yes, beavers!). The film's music, much like that of ""Due South,"" also serves to promote Canadian talent: The Tragically Hip (who also make an appearance as a curling team at the bonspiel), Sarah Harmer, Our Lady Peace, The New Pornographers, Sean McDonald, Big Sugar, Tom Wilson, the Matthew Good Band, Pepper Sands, Chantal Kreviazuk, Holly McNarland, and a beautiful country-rock love ballad by Paul Gross (who has released two albums, ""Two Houses"" and ""Love and Carnage"" as well as contributions to the ""Due South"" soundtracks). A very pleasing film on a number of levels and a darn tootin' lot o' fun, too, eh?!? There is some strong language and a number of implied sexual scenes, so if this offends you consider yourself forewarned.

So, I snatched up this film when I discovered that Gross and regular ""Due South"" guest star Leslie Nielson starred in it.I liked it. I really did. Gross is likable, as is the rest of the cast. I always love Nielson, and he does well in this film.But I couldn't help thinking that I was missing out on a lot of the jokes. There was a lot of humor or references that I suspect that only Canadians would appreciate. Not that I didn't enjoy this film--I certainly did. It was sweet and quirky. And even though I had no clue about this game with brooms that they were playing, I grasped enough to root for them. But that feeling of, ""I'm think I'm missing something here"" was in the back of my mind a lot of the time.Oh well, I still recommend this film.

I knew almost nothing about the sport of curling and still I loved this movie. It's funny, it's romantic; it's got action and angst and humor and a great story.Gross plays Chris Cutter, a guy who returns home 10 years after he walked out on his fellow curling teammates during a championship. He comes back for the coach's funeral. When the will is read, the coach asks the teammates to get together again and go for the golden broom (the most pretigious curling trophy in Canada).They all hem and haw, but decide to try. Their first match, against a group of octogenerians, is a disaster. So it's off to train in a hilarious sequence of events.Along the way, there is lots of angst between Paul and his former fiance (Michelle Nolden), whom he never said good-bye to when he left. There is also the fiance's baby sister (wonderfully portrayed by Molly Parker) who has always had a thing for Paul and still does. More angst. Yum.Paul's teammates are quite a group. Peter Outerbridge is charming and funny as the gang's womanizer who can't remember the names of women he sleeps with. Jed Rees is adorable as a loving, but frustratingly infertile husband. James Allodi is the down on his luck guy who must choose between curling and his wife, who aspires to high society. A wonderful group of people, who we come to care for.Paul Gross wrote the screenplay and directed it. He does a great job. Buy it!
