1290821,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B002UXYDBW,amerdale876,"[2, 6]","Is it funny? Yes ... from a guy's perspective. Is it lewd, crude, offensive and gross? Yes. Is it worth watching? Yes. Based on the non-fictionbookby self-proclaimed a$$hole Tucker Max, ""...Beer in Hell"" hits all the gross, degrading checks that would have most women rolling their eyes in disgust. Don't get me wrong this movie was pretty good ... but we've seen it before. It's as if the filmmakers took the Stifler (Seann William Scott) character and his storyline fromAmerican Wedding - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)(a.k.a. American Pie 3) and made it grosser and more from Stifler's point of view rather than Jim's (Jason Biggs).The book is much funnier than the film but don't think that Max has many redeeming qualities. He admits that he's a womanizer and makes no apologies for it. Does it make him misogynistic? This is briefly called into question in the film. The word actually means hatred of women. So, does Tucker Max hate women? No. In fact, if it weren't for them, he wouldn't fulfill his juvenile fantasies and conquests. But I can say that he's definitely disrespectful of women. He definitely has no respect for them. And yet, he still has women all over him. The quandary of this is brought to brilliant light by his best friends (Geoff Stults and Jesse Bradford -- the true pseudo-misogynist of the film). Nevertheless, if you're a guy this film is entertaining and funny. If you're a woman, you might not be so entertained. My favorite character in the film wasn't even male. I really enjoyed the character of Lara (Marika Dominczyk), who gave Bradford's character a run for his money and didn't put up with any of his crap. That's the kind of character I like.Upon viewing this film, you may not respect Tucker Max (I know I didn't) -- and he doesn't care whether you do or not -- but you will definitely react strongly to the situations. This love-it-or-hate-it film left me laughing in quite a few parts, but that's just me.

1290822,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002UXYDBW,B. E Jackson,"[6, 8]","First of all, I highly recommend that ALL women avoid I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.  The entire first 30 minutes of storytelling is devoted to nothing but the meanest, most offensive and obnoxious jokes targeted towards women you can possibly imagine.  We're talking a *highly* disrespectful movie here, folks.If you're a guy who acts this way towards women... I sure hope you have somebody forcing bars of soap down your throat.If that's not enough, the ignorant jokes keep on coming without any purpose or any desire to even create a storyline.  The jokes are also said in a quick-witted and creative way, and none of it is even remotely funny.  Sorry, but there comes a point where it's obvious a line has been crossed, and this movie is a perfect example of line crossing in its most brutal form.  Ugh.However, there IS a saving grace.  Since the storyline is about a group of young men going around strip joints and humiliating women with clever intelligent wording, it's the way the storyline unfolds and gradually improves (and most importantly, the message BEHIND the storyline and how it's totally wrong to disrespect women to this extent) that actually makes the film not a complete disaster, and even allows it to approach ""good"" in a few spots towards the conclusion.The final 45 minutes of storytelling involving a toilet/wedding incident really does save the movie from an easy 1-star rating.However, there's no denying that the first 30 minutes were designed with the intention of just completely making women look like horrible human beings in every conceivable way with no storyline to speak of, and it's completely unacceptable in my book.I really hope women despise this movie, and I hope most men out there hate it just as much.  Thank God the moral of the story saves it somewhat.  Besides that, the storyline itself barely qualifies as good and the acting is secondrate at best.",3,definitely low budget and quite offensive to women,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,1902,"['First', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ALL', 'women', 'avoid', 'Hope', 'Serve', 'Beer', 'Hell', 'entire', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'storytelling', 'devoted', 'nothing', 'meanest', 'most', 'offensive', 'obnoxious', 'jokes', 'targeted', 'towards', 'women', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'talking', '*highly*', 'disrespectful', 'movie', 'here', 'folks.If', ""'re"", 'guy', 'who', 'way', 'women', 'sure', 'hope', 'have', 'somebody', 'forcing', 'bars', 'soap', 'throat.If', 'not', 'enough', 'ignorant', 'jokes', 'keep', 'coming', 'purpose', 'desire', 'even', 'create', 'storyline', 'jokes', 'are', 'also', 'said', 'quick-witted', 'creative', 'way', 'none', 'even', 'remotely', 'funny', 'Sorry', 'there', 'point', 'where', 'obvious', 'line', 'been', 'crossed', 'movie', 'perfect', 'example', 'line', 'crossing', 'most', 'brutal', 'form', 'Ugh.However', 'saving', 'grace', 'storyline', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'going', 'strip', 'joints', 'humiliating', 'women', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'wording', 'way', 'storyline', 'unfolds', 'gradually', 'improves', 'most', 'importantly', 'message', 'storyline', 'how', 'totally', 'wrong', 'disrespect', 'women', 'extent', 'actually', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'disaster', 'even', 'approach', 'good', 'few', 'spots', 'conclusion.The', 'final', '45', 'minutes', 'storytelling', 'involving', 'toilet/wedding', 'incident', 'really', 'save', 'movie', 'easy', '1-star', 'rating.However', 'denying', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'designed', 'intention', 'just', 'completely', 'making', 'women', 'look', 'horrible', 'human', 'beings', 'conceivable', 'way', 'storyline', 'speak', 'completely', 'unacceptable', 'book.I', 'really', 'hope', 'women', 'despise', 'movie', 'hope', 'most', 'men', 'out', 'there', 'hate', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Thank', 'God', 'moral', 'story', 'somewhat', 'storyline', 'barely', 'good', 'acting', 'secondrate', 'best']",N/A

They are toxic, and above all dangerous individuals, this is illustrated by the fact that most serial murderers are indeed sociopaths.
